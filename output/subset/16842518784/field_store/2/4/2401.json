You wouldn't mind comin' into this 'ere grog-shop while I git change, would you?  Or if you'll lend me a sixpence I'll go in and git it for you.\"  \"No,\" said I, putting my fingers into my waistcoat pocket; \"but here is a sixpence for you, which you may keep, and never mind the change, if you'll walk along the streets with me a bit.\"  The urchin held out his dirty hand, and I put the coin into it.  He smiled, tossed the sixpence, caught it deftly, and transferred it to his right trousers pocket.  \"Vell, you are a rum 'un.  But I say, all square?  No dodges?  Honour bright?\"  \"No dodges.  Honour bright,\" I replied.  \"Come along.\"  At this point my attention was attracted by a sudden change in the behaviour of Dumps.  He went cautiously towards the boy, and snuffed as him for a moment.  \"I say, is he wicious?\" he asked, backing a little.  \"I think not, but--\"  I was checked in my speech by the little dog uttering a whine of delight and suddenly dancing round the boy, wagging its tail violently, and indeed wriggling its whole shapeless body with joy; as some dogs are wont to do when they meet with an old friend unexpectedly.  \"Why, he seems to know you,\" said I, in surprise.  \"Vell, he do seem to 'ave 'ad the honour of my acquaintance some'ow,\" returned the boy, whose tone of banter quickly passed away.  \"What d'ee call 'im?\"  \"Dumps,\" said I.  \"That won't do.  Has he a vite spot on the bridge of 'is nose?\" asked the boy earnestly.  \"I really cannot tell.  It is not long--\"  \"Here, Punch, come here!\" called the boy, interrupting.  At the name of Punch my doggie became so demonstrative in his affections that he all but leaped into the boy's arms, whined lovingly, and licked his dirty face all over.  \"The wery dog,\" said the boy, after looking at his nose; \"only growed so big that his own mother wouldn't know 'im.--Vy, where 'ave you bin all this long while, Punch?\"  \"D'you mean to say that you know the dog, and that his name is Punch?\"  \"Vell, you _are_ green.  Wouldn't any cove with half an eye see that the dog knows me, an' so, in course, I must know _him_?  An' ven I called 'im Punch didn't he answer?--hey?\"  I was obliged to admit the truth of these remarks.  After the first ebullition of joy at the meeting was over, we went along the street together.  \"Then the dog is yours?\" said I as we went along.  \"No, he ain't mine.  He was mine once--ven he was a pup, but I sold 'im to a young lady for--a _wery_ small sum.\"  \"For how much?\"  I asked.  \"For five bob.  Yes--on'y five bob!  I axed vun pound, but the young lady was so pleasant an' pritty that I come down to ten bob.  Then she said she was poor--and to tell 'ee the plain truth she looked like it-- an' she wanted the pup so bad that I come down to five.\"  \"And who was this young lady?\"  \"Blow'd if I knows.  She went off wi' my Punch, an' I never saw'd 'em more.\"  \"Then you don't know what induced her to sell Punch to a low fellow--but of course you know nothing about that,\" said I, in a musing tone, as I thought of the strange manner in which this portion of my doggie's history had come to light, but I was recalled from my reverie by the contemptuous tones of my little companion's voice, as he said--  \"But I _do_ know something about that.\"  \"Oh, indeed!  I thought you said you never saw the young lady again.\"  \"No more I did.  Neither did I ever see Punch again till to-day, but I know for certain that my young lady never sold no dog wotsomedever to no _low_ feller as ever walked in shoe leather or out of it!\"  \"Ah, I see,\" said I slowly, \"you mean--\"  \"Yes, out with it, that's just wot I do mean--that the low feller prigged the pup from her, an' I on'y vish as I 'ad a grip of his ugly nose, and I'd draw it out from his uglier face, I would, like the small end of a telescope, and then shut it up flat again--so flat that you'd never know he'd had no nose at all!\"  My little sharp-witted companion then willingly gave me an account of all he knew about the early history of my doggie.  The story was not long, but it began, so to speak, at the beginning.  Punch, or Dumps, as I continued to call him, had been born in a dry water-butt which stood in a back yard near the Thames.  This yard was, or had been, used for putting away lumber.  \"It was a queer place,\" said my little companion, looking up in my face with a droll expression--\"a sort o' place that, when once you had gone into it, you was sure to wish you hadn't.  Talk o' the blues, sir; I do assure _you_ that w'en I used to go into that yard of a night it gave me the black-an'-blues, it did.  There was a mouldiness an' a soppiness about it that beat the katticombs all to sticks.  It looked like a place that some rubbish had bin flung into in the days before Adam an' Eve was born, an' 'ad been forgotten tee-totally from that time to this.  Oh, it was awful!  Used to make my marrow screw up into lumps w'en I was used to go there.\"  \"But why did you go there at all if you disliked it so much?\"  I asked.  \"Vy? because I 'adn't got no better place to go to.  I was used to sleep there.  I slep' in the self-same water-butt where Punch was born. That's 'ow I come to scrape acquaintance with 'im.  I'd bin away from 'ome in the country for a week's slidin'.\"  \"A week's what?\"  \"Slidin'.  Don't you know what sliding on the ice is?\"  \"Oh!--yes.  Are you very fund of that?\"  \"I should think I was--w'en my boots are good enough to stick on, but they ain't always that, and then I've got to slide under difficulties. Sometimes I'm out o' boots an' shoes altogether, in vich case slidin's impossible; but I can look on and slide in spirit, vich is better than nuffin'.  But, as I was sayin' w'en you 'ad the bad manners to interrupt me, I 'ad bin away from 'ome for a week--\"  \"Excuse my interrupting you again, but where is your home, may I ask?\"  \"You may ask, but it 'ud puzzle me to answer for I ain't got no 'ome, unless I may say that London is my 'ome.  I come an' go where I pleases, so long's I don't worrit nobody.  I sleep where I like, if the bobbies don't get their eyes on me w'en I'm agoin' to bed, an' I heat wotever comes in my way if it ain't too tough.  In winter I sleeps in a lodgin' 'ouse w'en I can but as it costs thrippence a night, I finds it too expensive, an' usually prefers a railway arch, or a corner in Covent Garden Market, under a cart or a barrow, or inside of a empty sugar-barrel--anywhere so long's I'm let alone; but what with the rain, the wind, the cold, and the bobbies, I may be said to sleep under difficulties.  Vell, as I was agoin' to say w'en--\"  \"Excuse me once more--what is your name?\" said I.  \"Hain't got no name.\"  \"No name!  Come, you are joking.  What is your father's name?\"  \"Hain't got no father--never 'ad, as I knows on, nor mother neither, nor brother, nor sister, nor aunt, nor wife--not even a mother-in-law.  I'm a unit in creation, I is--as I once heerd a school-board buffer say w'en he was luggin' me along to school; but he was too green, that buffer was, for a school-boarder.  I gave 'im the slip at the corner of Watling Street, an' they've never bin able to cotch me since.\"  \"But you must be known by some name,\" said I.  \"What do your companions call you?\"  \"They call me bad names, as a rule.  Some o' the least offensive among 'em are Monkey-face, Screwnose, Cheeks, Squeaker, Roundeyes, and Slidder.  I prefers the last myself, an' ginerally answers to it.  But, as I was agoin' to say, I'd bin away for a veek, an' w'en I comed 'ome--\"  \"To which part of home? for London is a wide word, you know,\" I said.  \"Now, sir, if you go for to interrupt me like that I'll 'ave to charge a bob for this here valk; I couldn't stand it for sixpence.\"  \"Come, Slidder, don't be greedy.\"  \"Vell, sir, if you got as many kicks as I do, and as few ha'pence, p'r'aps you'd be greedy too.\"  \"Perhaps I should, my boy,\" said I, in a gentle tone.  \"But come, I will give you an extra sixpence if we get along well.  Let's have the rest of your story; I won't interrupt again.\"  \"It ain't my story, it's Punch's story,\" returned the waif, as he stooped to pat the gratified doggie.  \"Vell, w'en I com'd 'ome it was lateish and I was tired, besides bein' 'ungry; so I goes right off to my water-butt, intendin' to go to bed as usual, but no sooner did I put my head in, than out came a most awful growl.  The butt lay on its side, and I backed out double quick just in time, for a most 'orrible-lookin' terrier dog rushed at me.  Bein' used to dogs, I wasn't took by surprise, but fetched it a clip with one o' my feet in its ribs that sent it staggerin' to the palin' o' the yard.  It found a hole, bolted through, scurried up the lane yellin', and I never saw'd it more!  This was Punch's mother.  On goin' into the butt afterwards I found three dead pups and one alive, so I pitched the dead ones away an' shoved the live one into the breast of my coat, where he slep' till mornin'.  At first I 'ad a mind to drown the pup, but it looked so comfortable an' playful, an' was such a queer critter, that I called him Punch, an' became a father to 'im.  I got him bones an' other bits o' grub, an' kep' 'im in the water-butt for three veeks.  Then he began to make a noise v'en I left him; so, bein' sure the bobbies would rout 'im out at last, I took 'im an' sold 'im to the first pleasant lady that seemed to fancy 'im.\"  \"Well, Slidder,\" said I, as we turned down into the mean-looking alley where Mrs Willis, my little old woman, dwelt, \"I am greatly interested in what you have told me about my little dog, and I am interested still more in what you have told me about yourself.  Now, I want you to do"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21753"],["title","The Norsemen in the West (#1)"],["body","back, \"I want to see the ships come in.\"  \"You shall see that, my son; I will not keep you too long.\"  This was quite sufficient.  Olaf thoroughly believed in his aunt's truthfulness and wisdom.  He set to work to assist in clearing away the confusion--part of which, in the shape of toys and chips--was of his own creating--and became so busy that he almost forgot the ships--at least if he did remember them they did not weigh heavily on his mind.  \"Now, Olaf,\" said Gudrid, going to the window when the preparations were nearly completed, \"you may run down to the shore, for the ships will soon be on the strand.\"  The boy waited no second bidding, you may be sure.  He flew out of the house, and to his great surprise beheld the two ships--which so lately had appeared like sea-birds on the horizon--coming grandly up the fiord, their great square sails bulging out before a smart breeze.  All the men of the little colony were assembled on the shore--all, at least, who chanced to be at home at the time; but many of the inhabitants were absent--some fishing, some gone to Iceland, and others on viking-cruise.  There were probably about thirty men on the sands, besides a good many women and children.  It must not be supposed, however, that this was the whole of that Greenland colony.  It was only the part of it that had settled at Brattalid in Ericsfiord.  There was another portion, a few miles distant, named Heriulfness, nearly as large as that of Ericsfiord, which had been founded by Heriulf a friend and companion of Eric the Red. Heriulf had soon followed his friend Eric to the grave, leaving the management of the colony of Heriulfness to his son Biarne.  Biarne had not been present when the two sails were first observed, but he chanced to come over to Brattalid just before their arrival.  \"What, ho!  Biarne,\" shouted Leif, as the son of Heriulf went down to the beach, \"come up hither.\"  Leif stood on an elevated rock apart, and Biarne, a good deal excited, went up to him.  \"Why, what ails thee?\" asked Leif.  \"Nothing,\" replied Biarne, \"but I think I know whose ship that first one is.\"  \"Ay! is it the ship of a friend or a foe?\"  \"A friend,\" replied Biarne--\"at least he was a friend when I knew him in Norway, nigh twenty summers past, and I did not think him changeable. You and I, Leif, have often sailed these northern seas together and apart, but I do not think that in all our wanderings either of us has met before or since a finer man than Karlsefin, though he was a mere stripling when I knew him.\"  The Norseman's eyes flashed as he spoke of his friend, for, besides being a strong and handsome man, he possessed a warm enthusiastic heart. Indeed, he had been noted in the settlement for the strength of his affection for his father Heriulf, and his dutiful conduct towards him as long as the old man lived.  \"Karlsefin,\" repeated Leif, musing; \"I know him not.\"  \"Yet he knows you,\" said Biarne; \"when I met him in Norway I told him all about your discovery of Vinland.\"  \"Nay, thine own discovery of it,\" said Leif.  \"Not so,\" replied the other, with a blush, in which a frown mingled; \"I did but look upon the land--you went ashore and took possession.\"  \"Well, if I did so I have not retained it,\" replied Leif, with a laugh; \"but say, how know you that this is Karlsefin's ship?\"  \"I know by the cut of her figure-head and the colour of her sails. Karlsefin was always partial to stripes of white and blue.\"  \"Well, it may be as you say; we shall soon know.\"  Thus saying, Leif descended to the beach as the vessels approached and ran their keels straight on the sandy shores of the bay.  There was great bustle on board, and there were many men, besides some women, who could be seen looking over the bulwarks with keen interest, while Leif's men brought planks with which to make a gangway from the ship to the shore.  The ships which had thus come to Greenland were of the quaint build peculiar to the Norse vessels of those days--a peculiarity of build, by the way, which has not altogether disappeared, for to this day the great central mast, huge square sail, and high prow may be seen in the fiords of Norway.  Each of the vessels which now lay beached in Ericsfiord had a high forecastle and poop, with figure-heads on stem and stern-posts that towered higher still.  The ships were only half-decked, with benches for numerous rowers, and each had a crew of sixty men.  When the gangway was laid to the leading ship the first man who descended to the shore was of striking appearance.  It was not so much that he was tall and strong enough to have been a worthy foeman to the stoutest colonist in Ericsfiord, as that his demeanour was bland and courtly, while there was great intellectuality in his dark handsome countenance.  Unlike most Norsemen, his hair and beard were black and close-curling, and his costume, though simple, was rich in quality.  The moment he landed, Biarne stepped forward, exclaiming, \"Karlsefin!\"  The stranger's face lighted up with surprise and pleasure.  \"Biarne!\" he said, seizing his hand, \"I thought you were in Iceland.\"  \"So I was, but now I am in Greenland, and right glad to be the first to welcome my friend.\"  Hereupon the two shook hands fervently; but, not content with this, they seized each other in an embrace, and their bearded mouths met with a hearty masculine smack that did credit to their hearts, and which it might have gratified the feelings of an affectionate walrus to behold.    CHAPTER TWO.  STRONG EMOTIONS ARE SUCCEEDED BY SUPPER, AND FOLLOWED BY DISCUSSIONS ON DISCOVERY, WHICH END IN A WILD ALARM!  When Karlsefin had been introduced to Leif Ericsson, the former turned round and presented to him and Biarne his friend Thorward, the captain of the other ship.  Thorward was not a tall man, but was very broad and stout, and had a firm yet pleasing cast of countenance.  Both Thorward and Karlsefin were men of about thirty-five years of age.  \"Are you not on viking-cruise?\" asked Leif as they walked up to the house together, while the male members of his household and the men of the settlement assisted the crews to moor the ships.  \"No; my friend Thorward and I are not men of war.  We prefer the peaceful occupation of the merchant, and, to say truth, it is not unprofitable.\"  \"I would that more were of your way of thinking,\" said Leif.  \"I do not love the bloody game of war, and glad am I that we have got into a quiet corner here in Greenland, where there is small occasion for it.  Biarne, too, is of our way of thinking, as no doubt you already know.\"  \"He has often told me so, and, if I mistake not, has feathered his nest well by merchanting.\"  \"He has,\" answered Biarne for himself, with a laugh.  While they thus advanced, talking, little Olaf had kept walking in front of the tall stranger, looking up into his face with unbounded admiration.  He had never before seen any man so magnificent.  His father and Biarne, whom he had hitherto regarded as perfect specimens of mankind, were quite eclipsed.  Looking backward and walking forward is an unsafe process at any time.  So Olaf found it on the present occasion, for he tripped over a stone and in falling hit his little nose with such violence that it soon became a big nose, and bled profusely.  Karlsefin picked him up and set him on his legs.  \"My poor boy, don't cry,\" he said.  \"No fear of _him_ crying,\" observed Leif; \"he never cries,--save when his feelings are hurt.  When you touch these he _is_ addicted to blubbering.--Run, lad, and Gudrid will wash you.\"  Olaf bounded into the house, where he was carried off to a sleeping-room and there carefully sponged by the sympathetic Gudrid.  \"Oh!--\" he exclaimed, while his face was being washed.  \"Does it pain you much, dear?\" said the pretty aunt, interrupting him.  \"Oh!\" he continued, enthusiastically, \"I never did see such a splendid man before.\"  \"What splendid man, child?\"  \"Why, Karlsefin.\"  \"And who is Karlsefin?\"  \"The stranger who has come across the sea from Norway.\"  \"Indeed,\" said Gudrid.  Whether it was the sound of the stranger's voice in the adjoining room, or anxiety to complete her hospitable preparations, that caused Gudrid to bring her operations on Olaf to an abrupt termination, we cannot tell, but certain it is that she dried him rather quickly and hastened into the outer hall, where she was introduced to the two strangers in due form as widow Gudrid.  She had no difficulty in distinguishing which was Olaf's \"splendid man!\" She looked at Karlsefin and fell in love with him on the spot, but Gudrid was modest, and not sentimental.  It is only your mawkishly sentimental people who are perpetually tumbling into love, and out of it, and can't help showing it.  Cupid shot her right through the heart with one powerful dart, and took her unawares too, but she did not show the smallest symptom of having been even grazed.  She neither blushed nor stammered, nor looked conscious, nor affected to look unconscious. She was charmingly natural!  But this was not all: Karlsefin also fell in love on the spot,--over head and ears and hair, and hat to boot; neither did he show sign of it! After the trifling ceremonies usual on an introduction were over, he turned to continue his conversation with Leif and paid no further attention to Gudrid, while she busied herself in preparing supper.  It is true that he looked at her now and then, but of course he looked at everybody, now and then, in the course of the evening.  Besides, it is well-known what is said about the rights of the feline species in reference to royalty.  At supper Gudrid waited on the guests, Karlsefin therefore, necessarily paid her somewhat more attention in accepting her civilities, but Thorward was quite as attentive as he, so that the most sharp-witted match-maker in the world would have failed to note any symptom of anything whatever in regard to either of them.  Gudrid felt this a little, for she was accustomed to admiration from the"]]]
