Uncle Asher had horses in the races every year, but he was often 'done' by his jockeys. He knew it well enough, but he found it impossible to get the sort of jockey he wanted. Toots begged to ride a race, but he was a little shaver, and uncle was afraid. Finally, one day, just before a race was to come off, Uncle Asher discovered that his jockey had sold out. At the last moment he fired the fellow, and was forced to let Toots ride, or withdraw his horse. Toots rode, and won. The next time he rode he might have won, but the horse was doped.\"  \"He's just the chap you want!\" nodded Jack, with satisfaction. \"Put Nemo into the Bethany races, and let Toots ride him.\"  \"I'll think of it,\" said Frank.  A hostler approached the group.  \"Howdy do, Mr. Merriwell, sir?\" he said. \"One of your friends called to see your horse this morning, sir.\"  \"One of my friends?\" cried Frank, in surprise. \"Who was it?\"  \"He gave his name as Diamond, sir--Jack Diamond.\"  Merriwell immediately turned on Jack and asked:  \"Hello, how about this? Did you call to see Nemo this morning?\"  \"Not much!\" exclaimed Jack. \"This is the first time I have been here. The hostler is mistaken.\"  \"You must have misunderstood your visitor, Grody,\" said Frank. \"He could not have given his name as Jack Diamond, for this is Jack Diamond here.\"  The man stared at Jack, and then shook his head.  \"That's not the feller,\" he declared.  \"Of course not. Your visitor must have given you some other name.\"  \"Not on your life,\" returned Grody, promptly. \"He said his name was Jack Diamond, sir, and I will swear to that.\"  \"Well, this is somewhat interesting!\" came grimly from Frank. \"What did he do, Grody?\"  \"He looked Nemo over, sir.\"  \"Looked Nemo over how--in what way?\"  \"Why, I offered to take Nemo out of the stall, but he said no, not to bother, as he only wished to glance at the horse. He went to the stall, which same I showed him, and looked in. The door wasn't locked, for I had just been cleanin' the stall out. He opened the door and stood there some little time. First thing I knew he was gone. I went and looked into the stall, and he was examinin' Nemo's feet. He seemed wonderful interested in the horse, and I saw by the way he acted he knew something about horses.\"  \"The interest deepens,\" observed Frank. \"Go on, Grody.\"  \"When he came out of the stall he says to me, says he, 'Merriwell has struck a right good piece of horseflesh there.' Says I, 'In the best of my judgment he has, sir.' Says he, 'I understand he paid a fancy figure for the gelding, something like a thousand, he told me.' Says I, 'If he told you that I have no doubt he told you correct, sir.' Then says he, 'Does he mean to race him?' 'That,' says I, 'bein' a friend of Mr. Merriwell, is something what you should know as well as I, or better.' Then he says, says he, 'Horses is mighty uncertain property, for you never can tell what may happen to them.' In this I agreed with him, but there was something about him I didn't like much. Then he went away.\"  Frank whistled.  \"This is highly interesting,\" exclaimed Frank. \"What did this fellow look like, Grody? Can you describe him?\"  \"Well, I looked him over rather careful like, sir, but I don't know as I can describe him particular, except that he had on a checked suit and wore a red necktie, in which were a blazer, genuine, or to the contrary. I know horses, but I'm no judge of diamonds. He was smooth shaved, and his jaw were rather square and his hair short. The eyes of him never looked straight at me once. Somehow I didn't think he were a student, for he made one or two breaks in the words he said that made his talk different from your student's. He didn't have that sort of real gentleman way with him neither.\"  Frank turned to his friends.  \"Now what do you suppose this business means, fellows?\" he asked.  \"It means crookedness!\" declared Diamond, rather excitedly. \"I am dead sure of that!\"  \"It looks that way,\" admitted Browning.  \"But what sort of crookedness can it mean?\" asked Frank, bewildered. \"What is the game?\"  \"That will develop later; but there is some kind of a game on, be sure of that,\" asserted Jack. \"If not, why should anybody come here and give a fictitious name? That gives the whole thing away. Look out, Frank, all your enemies are not sleeping!\"  \"Well, it is time they let up on me,\" said Merriwell, seriously. \"They have brought nothing but disaster and disgrace on themselves thus far, and----\"  \"Some of them are looking for revenge, mark what I say.\"  \"I am tired of being bothered and harassed by petty enemies!\" exclaimed Frank. \"I have had considerable patience with the fellows who have worked against me, but there is a limit.\"  \"That's right, and they would have reached the limit with me long ago,\" declared Diamond.  \"Well, it is like this, Jack,\" said Frank; \"it is almost always true that not all of a man's enemies are bad fellows. To begin with, you remember that you were my enemy, and now we are friends, and this is not the first time such a thing has happened with me.\"  \"Well, if a man were bucking against me, I do not think I would wait to see how he would turn out before I bucked back.\"  \"Oh, I am not in the habit of doing that. You will remember that I bucked back pretty hard in your case.\"  Jack did remember it, and he felt that Merriwell was capable of holding his own with his foes.  \"You will do well to look out for your horse, all the same,\" said Diamond.  \"That's right,\" grunted Browning. \"If I were in your place, Merriwell, I'd watch out pretty sharp.\"  \"I will,\" said Frank. \"I'll have Toots come on here and keep watch over Nemo most of the time. When he is not here, Grody can take his place. If I have an enemy who thinks of stealing my horse, he'll have hard work to accomplish his design.\"  \"Unless he does it before you get things arranged,\" said Griswold. \"Put him up, Merriwell, and let's get out.\"  \"I am going for a ride,\" said Frank. \"Put the saddle on him, Grogan. Will see you later, fellows, if you are going now.\"  \"We'll wait till you leave,\" yawned Browning. \"There's no reason why we should tear our clothes hurrying away.\"  \"You are not liable to tear your clothes doing anything,\" laughed Frank.     CHAPTER II.  AN ADVENTURE ON THE ROAD.   Grody soon had Nemo saddled and bridled. The horse was eager to be away, as he showed by his tossing head, fluttering nostrils and restless feet.  \"Whoa, boy,\" said Frank, soothingly. \"Don't be so impatient. We'll get away in a moment.\"  He swung into the saddle, the stable doors rolled open, and away sprang the gelding.  The remaining lads hurried out of the stable to watch Frank ride, Grody accompanying them.  \"He seems like he were a part of the horse,\" declared the hostler, admiringly. \"That young gentleman were born to handle horses, he were.\"  \"He is, indeed, a graceful rider,\" nodded Diamond. \"I am sure he did not learn in any riding academy, for he rides naturally. The riding academies all turn out riders with an artificial and wooden style. There is no more distressing sight than the riders to be seen in Central Park, New York, almost any afternoon. They bounce around in the saddle like a lot of wooden figures, and it is plain enough that many of them do not bounce because they want to, but because they think it the proper thing. Southerners ride naturally and gracefully. Mr. Merriwell rides like a Southerner.\"  \"He rides like Buffalo Bill,\" said Browning, with an effort. \"Bill is the best rider I ever saw.\"  Diamond was watching Merriwell and the horse, a queer look on his face. Finally he exclaimed:  \"By Jove! there's something the matter with Nemo!\"  \"What is it?\" asked Griswold. \"I didn't notice anything.\"  \"The horse shows a suspicion of lameness,\" asserted Jack.  \"You have good eyes to detect it,\" observed Browning, doubtingly. \"I can't see that anything is the matter with the horse.\"  \"I'll wager he goes lame before Merriwell returns.\"  \"If he does, I shall think you have great discernment.\"  Merriwell turned a corner and disappeared.  \"Come, fellows,\" said Griswold, \"let's shuffle along.\"  \"Merriwell is altogether too generous,\" declared Diamond, as the trio walked away.  \"In what way?\" asked Browning.  \"With his enemies. I know you and I were both enemies to him in the beginning, and----\"  \"He threw us down hard.\"  \"That's all right; but there are enemies you have to hold down.\"  \"Merriwell didn't do a thing to Hartwick!\" exclaimed Griswold, grinning. \"He scared the fellow so he ran away from college, and nobody knows where he went.\"  \"Yes, but Merriwell gave him the opportunity to skip and escape the disgrace that must follow public exposure of his acts. Some fellows would have exposed him and brought about his expulsion.\"  \"That's right,\" chirped Griswold. \"Merriwell was as generous with Hartwick as he could be with such a fellow. He might have used him much worse than he did.\"  \"And do you fancy Hartwick thinks any more of Merriwell for not exposing him publicly?\" asked Jack.  \"Oh. I don't know.\"  \"Well, I will wager that he does not. More than that, I'll venture that Hartwick, wherever he may be, cherishes a fierce desire for revenge, and longs for the day when he will be able to get back at Frank. Merry will hear from that chap again.\"  And there the subject was dropped.  Frank enjoyed the ride upon Nemo's back, for the horse seemed intelligent and something of a comrade. The boy talked to his mount as if the animal could understand every word he uttered.  He had ridden beyond the limits of the city before he noticed that Nemo was limping the least bit.  \"What's the matter, old fellow?\" asked Frank, with concern. \"Have you hurt yourself some way?\"  Nemo shook his head. It almost seemed that the animal was answering the question in the negative.  \"You must have stepped on a stone,\" Merriwell declared. \"Why, you are really beginning to limp in earnest!\"  Frank "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21958"],["title","Frank Merriwell's Races (#2)"],["body","dismounted, after having decided it was Nemo's left hind leg or foot that was lame.  \"I'll make an inspection, and see if I can discover what is the matter,\" said the boy, anxiously.  He examined both of the horse's hind feet, but could not see that anything was wrong.  \"If that rascally shoer has blundered in his work he'll not get another chance at you, boy,\" Merriwell declared.  After patting Nemo's neck and fondling the fine creature a bit, Frank mounted once more.  But Nemo limped worse than ever.  \"This is singular,\" muttered the perplexed lad. \"I don't understand it at all. There's something wrong, for a fact.\"  He watched the horse, and decided that he had made no mistake in locating the lameness in the left hind leg.  Again he dismounted and made an examination, and again the result was far from satisfactory.  \"I wish you might speak and tell me what is the matter,\" said Frank, in dismay. \"I'll have you examined without delay by somebody who knows his business.\"  He rode slowly into the outskirts of the city.  Of a sudden there was a rattle of wheels and a clatter of hoofs behind him.  He turned and looked back, to see a carriage coming along the road at a reckless rate. Two persons were seated in the carriage, and the horse was covered with sweat.  \"Why are those fools driving like that?\" muttered Merriwell. \"Are they drunk, or is it a matter of life or death?\"  \"Get out of the road!\"  The command was hoarsely shouted, and Frank reined aside, having no desire to get in the way of the reckless driver.  Once more the boy on the horse turned to look back.  \"Drunk, sure enough,\" he decided. \"And they are two young fellows, too. Students on a tear, perhaps.\"  The occupants of the carriage had been drinking heavily, but they were not so drunk that they did not recognize the boy in advance when he turned in the saddle the second time.  \"Hey, Rolf!\" exclaimed the one who was not driving. \"It's Merriwell!\"  \"That's what it is!\" cried the driver. \"I haven't seen him for some time, but I know his face too well to ever forget it!\"  \"He's out on his new horse.\"  \"Sure.\"  \"Run him down! run him down! Throw him off! Now's our chance!\"  The driver was just intoxicated enough to be utterly reckless of consequences, and he snarled:  \"Hang me if I don't do it!\"  And then, when they were very near the boy and the horse, he suddenly reined toward Frank with the intention of running into Merriwell's mount.  In another moment there might have been a grand smash there on the road, but Frank had caught the words \"Run him down!\" and he gave Nemo a light cut with the whip, at the same time pulling him still farther into the ditch.  Nemo was not used to the whip, and he leaped like a flash. Such a spring would have unseated any but a most expert rider, but the boy in the saddle seemed to move as a part of the horse. Into the ditch they went, and past them spun the carriage containing the two reckless young men.  The carriage came very near upsetting. It careened and spun along on two wheels, threatening to hurl its occupants into the ditch, for the driver had reined the horse back toward the middle of the road. Both clung on for life.  \"Don't blame me!\" muttered Merriwell, through his teeth. \"You were looking for a smash.\"  But the carriage did not go over; it righted at last. One of the young men looked back and shook his fist at the boy on the horse, and then away they went in a cloud of dust.  \"If that was not Evan Hartwick, I am greatly mistaken!\" exclaimed Frank, as he reined Nemo back into the road. \"So he is back here as soon as this? I know what that means. He is looking for revenge on me.\"  Frank had seen the face of the driver as the carriage spun past, and he added:  \"Hartwick's companion is somebody I know. I did not obtain a fair look at him, but--great Scott! it was the card sharp, Rolf Harlow!\"  Harlow was a fellow who had entered Harvard, but had not completed his second year there, leaving suddenly for reasons not generally known.  A Yale man by the name of Harris, familiarly known as \"Sport,\" because of his gambling inclinations, had known Harlow, and had introduced him to a number of Yale students.  Harris and Harlow were both poker players, but they claimed that they played the game \"merely for amusement.\"  A number of Harris' acquaintances had been induced to enter into the game, and there had been some very \"hot sittings.\"  No one seemed to suspect that Harlow was crooked, for he almost always lost, although he never lost large sums.  Harris won almost continually. He seemed to be the luckiest fellow in the world in drawing cards. He would hold up one ace on a large jackpot and catch two more aces and a small pair. It seemed the greatest kind of \"bull luck.\"  Harry Rattleton, Merriwell's roommate, was following the game. Frank tried to induce him to keep away, but it was without avail.  Then Frank seemed to take an interest in the game, and it was not long before he proved that Harlow was a card manipulator, and caught him at one of his tricks.  That finished Harlow's career at plucking Yale \"fruit,\" and the fellow left New Haven suddenly.  Harris had remained under a cloud of suspicion since that time, as there seemed very little doubt but he had been in league with Harlow, and they had divided the plunder between them.  The proof had not been sufficient to incriminate Harris, but it had been enough to make him unpopular and cause him to be shunned.  He had seemed to take this very meekly, but some of Merriwell's friends declared that Harris had not forgotten or forgiven, and that he would strike back at Frank if the opportunity ever presented.  Now Harlow was back in New Haven, and Hartwick, who had been forced to leave college to escape expulsion, was also there.  That meant something.  \"Hartwick, Harlow and Harris--the three hard tickets. They are birds of a feather. All they need is Ditson to make a most delectable quartet!\"  So muttered Frank Merriwell, as he gazed at the receding cloud of dust.  Frank began to realize that there was more trouble in store for him.  \"I shall not deal gently with that gang this time,\" he declared, with a hard-set face. \"This little adventure has put me on my guard, and I don't propose to let them have much fun with me. Those two fools were just full enough to drive right into me with the hope of doing me an injury, without a thought of their own necks. They might have been thrown out and killed, but they did not hesitate because of that. The one thought was to do me some way--any way. Hartwick always was a desperate fellow, but I did not fancy Harlow could be such a chap. However, he was driving that horse, and the way he drove was proof enough that he is careless of life and limb at times.\"  For some time Frank paid very little attention to Nemo, but the lameness of the horse became so pronounced at last that he could not help observing it once more.  \"That worries me, old fellow,\" he admitted, with a troubled face. \"It is something I can't understand.\"  He rode slowly back to the stable.  It was growing dark when he arrived at the stable. A strange man was standing outside as Frank rode up. The man looked keenly at the boy and the horse, and then, as the doors rolled open, followed into the stable.  \"Horse is lame, eh?\" he said, questioningly. \"I didn't notice that when he went out. He wasn't lame then, was he?\"  Frank paid not the least attention to this question. The man was a stranger, and the boy did not care to talk with him.  \"I spotted that horse when yer rode out, young man,\" the stranger persisted. \"Fine lookin' critter--just the kind I've been wantin' some time for a saddle horse. Whose critter is it?\"  \"Grody,\" said Frank, utterly ignoring the man, \"I want you to see if you can tell what ails Nemo. He is lame in one of his hind feet. He was taken that way after I had been out a while. I think it possible there is something the matter with the way he is shod. Will you look after him without delay?\"  \"To be sure, sir--I'll not fail, sir,\" said Grody.  \"Then the horse belongs ter you, does it?\" asked the strange man, coming forward and addressing Frank in a point-blank manner. \"I am a horseman, and I know all about critters. If there's anything the matter--and there seems to be--I can tell what it is in five minutes. Shall I make an examination, young man?\"  \"No, sir!\" came sharply from Merriwell's lips. \"I do not propose to have strangers fooling around my horse. I do not know you, sir, so your offer is respectfully declined.\"     CHAPTER III.  TEACHING A RASCAL A LESSON.   \"Now hold on, young man, don't be so fast,\" said the stranger. \"You do not know me now, and I don't blame yer fer not wantin' anybody yer don't know doing anything fer yer horse; but here's my card--Professor James Colbath--and now I know you have heard of me. I am one of the greatest veterinary surgeons in the country.\"  Frank ignored the card, and the man began to show signs of anger.  \"This is no bluff!\" he exclaimed. \"It's on the level. I have nary doubt but I can find out what's the matter with the critter in five minutes, and if I don't give yer a square deal I don't want a cent for my services, that's all.\"  He would have lifted one of Nemo's feet, but Frank cried:  \"Drop that! I tell you I don't want you, and I won't have you! Get away from this horse!\"  The man growled and stiffened up.  \"All right,\" he said, somewhat savagely. \"I did think of trying to buy the critter off yer, but you're too flip. If the animal stays lame, don't blame me.\"  Although Frank had seemed to pay very little attention to the stranger, he was inspecting him closely. He saw the man had pulled his hat down over his eyes, and wore his coat collar turned up. He had a black beard that concealed his features to a great extent.  Grody was also looking the stranger over closely. He fancied he detected a familiar sound in the man's voice. The light in the stable was rather dim, and that served to"]]]
