Edw._ I see I must, and therefore am content:    Instead of ink, I'll write it with my tears.            [_Subscribes._ _Y. Mor._ The king is love-sick for his minion. _K. Edw._ 'Tis done: and now, accursed hand, fall off! _Lan._ Give it me: I'll have it publish'd in the streets. _Y. Mor._ I'll see him presently despatch'd away. _Archb. of Cant._ Now is my heart at ease. _War._ And so is mine. _Pem._ This will be good news to the common sort. _E. Mor._ Be it or no, he shall not linger here.                                         [_Exeunt all except King Edward._ _K. Edw._ How fast they run to banish him I love!    They would not stir, were it to do me good.    Why should a king be subject to a priest?    Proud Rome, that hatchest such imperial grooms,    With these thy superstitious taper-lights,    Wherewith thy antichristian churches blaze,    I'll fire thy crazed buildings, and enforce    The papal towers to kiss the lowly ground,    With slaughter'd priests make Tiber's channel swell,    And banks rais'd higher with their sepulchres!    As for the peers, that back the clergy thus,    If I be king, not one of them shall live.                    _Re-enter_ GAVESTON.  _Gav._ My lord, I hear it whisper'd everywhere,    That I am banish'd and must fly the land. _K. Edw._ 'Tis true, sweet Gaveston: O were it false!    The legate of the Pope will have it so,    And thou must hence, or I shall be depos'd.    But I will reign to be reveng'd of them;    And therefore, sweet friend, take it patiently.    Live where thou wilt, I'll send thee gold enough;    And long thou shalt not stay; or, if thou dost,    I'll come to thee; my love shall ne'er decline. _Gav._ Is all my hope turn'd to this hell of grief? _K. Edw._ Rend not my heart with thy too-piercing words:    Thou from this land, I from myself am banish'd. _Gav._ To go from hence grieves not poor Gaveston;    But to forsake you, in whose gracious looks    The blessedness of Gaveston remains;    For nowhere else seeks he felicity. _K. Edw._ And only this torments my wretched soul,    That, whether I will or no, thou must depart.    Be governor of Ireland in my stead,    And there abide till fortune call thee home.    Here, take my picture, and let me wear thine:                                                [_They exchange pictures._    O, might I keep thee here, as I do this,    Happy were I! but now most miserable. _Gav._ 'Tis something to be pitied of a king. _K. Edw._ Thou shalt not hence; I'll hide thee, Gaveston. _Gav._ I shall be found, and then 'twill grieve me more. _K. Edw._ Kind words and mutual talk makes our grief greater:    Therefore, with dumb embracement, let us part,    Stay, Gaveston; I cannot leave thee thus. _Gav._ For every look, my love drops down a tear:    Seeing I must go, do not renew my sorrow. _K. Edw._ The time is little that thou hast to stay,    And, therefore, give me leave to look my fill.    But, come, sweet friend; I'll bear thee on thy way. _Gav._ The peers will frown. _K. Edw._ I pass not for their anger.  Come, let's go:    O, that we might as well return as go!                 _Enter_ QUEEN ISABELLA.  _Q. Isab._ Whither goes my lord? _K. Edw._ Fawn not on me, French strumpet; get thee gone! _Q. Isab._ On whom but on my husband should I fawn? _Gav._ On Mortimer; with whom, ungentle queen,--    I judge no more--judge you the rest, my lord. _Q. Isab._ In saying this, thou wrong'st me, Gaveston:    Is't not enough that thou corrupt'st my lord,    And art a bawd to his affections,    But thou must call mine honour thus in question? _Gav._ I mean not so; your grace must pardon me. _K. Edw._ Thou art too familiar with that Mortimer,    And by thy means is Gaveston exil'd:    But I would wish thee reconcile the lords,    Or thou shalt ne'er be reconcil'd to me. _Q. Isab._ Your highness knows, it lies not in my power. _K. Edw._ Away, then! touch me not.--Come, Gaveston. _Q. Isab._ Villain, 'tis thou that robb'st me of my lord. _Gav._ Madam, 'tis you that rob me of my lord. _K. Edw._ Speak not unto her: let her droop and pine. _Q. Isab._ Wherein, my lord, have I deserv'd these words?    Witness the tears that Isabella sheds,    Witness this heart, that, sighing for thee, breaks,    How dear my lord is to poor Isabel! _K. Edw._ And witness heaven how dear thou art to me:    There weep; for, till my Gaveston be repeal'd,    Assure thyself thou com'st not in my sight.                                       [_Exeunt King Edward and Gaveston._ _Q. Isab._ O miserable and distressed queen!    Would, when I left sweet France, and was embarked,    That charming Circe, walking on the waves,    Had chang'd my shape! or at the marriage-day    The cup of Hymen had been full of poison!    Or with those arms, that twin'd about my neck,    I had been stifled, and not liv'd to see    The king my lord thus to abandon me!    Like frantic Juno, will I fill the earth    With ghastly murmur of my sighs and cries;    For never doted Jove on Ganymede    So much as he on cursed Gaveston:    But that will more exasperate his wrath;    I must entreat him, I must speak him fair,    And be a means to call home Gaveston:    And yet he'll ever dote on Gaveston;    And so am I for ever miserable.    _Re-enter_ LANCASTER, WARWICK, PEMBROKE, _the elder_        MORTIMER, _and the younger_ MORTIMER.  _Lan._ Look, where the sister of the king of France    Sits wringing of her hands and beats her breast! _War._ The king, I fear, hath ill-treated her. _Pem._ Hard is the heart that injures such a saint. _Y. Mor._ I know 'tis 'long of Gaveston she weeps. _E. Mor._ Why, he is gone. _Y. Mor._ Madam, how fares your grace? _Q. Isab._ Ah, Mortimer, now breaks the king's hate forth,    And he confesseth that he loves me not! _Y. Mor._ Cry quittance, madam, then, and love not him. _Q. Isab._ No, rather will I die a thousand deaths:    And yet I love in vain; he'll ne'er love me. _Lan._ Fear ye not, madam; now his minion's gone,    His wanton humour will be quickly left. _Q. Isab._ O, never, Lancaster! I am enjoin'd,    To sue unto you all for his repeal:    This wills my lord, and this must I perform,    Or else be banish'd from his highness' presence. _Lan._ For his repeal, madam! he comes not back,    Unless the sea cast up his shipwreck'd body. _War._ And to behold so sweet a sight as that,    There's none here but would run his horse to death. _Y. Mor._ But, madam, would you have us call him home? _Q. Isab._ Ay, Mortimer, for, till he be restor'd,    The angry king hath banish'd me the court;    And, therefore, as thou lov'st and tender'st me,    Be thou my advocate unto these peers. _Y. Mor._ What, would you have me plead for Gaveston? _E. Mor._ Plead for him that will, I am resolv'd. _Lan._ And so am I, my lord: dissuade the queen. _Q. Isab._ O, Lancaster, let him dissuade the king!    For 'tis against my will he should return. _War._ Then speak not for him; let the peasant go. _Q. Isab._ 'Tis for myself I speak, and not for him. _Pem._ No speaking will prevail; and therefore cease. _Y. Mor._ Fair queen, forbear to angle for the fish    Which, being caught, strikes him that takes it dead;    I mean that vile torpedo, Gaveston,    That now, I hope, floats on the Irish seas. _Q. Isab._ Sweet Mortimer, sit down by me a while,    And I will tell thee reasons of such weight    As thou wilt soon subscribe to his repeal. _Y. Mor._ It is impossible: but speak your mind. _Q. Isab._ Then, thus;--but none shall hear it but ourselves.                                                [_Talks to Y. Mor. apart._ _Lan._ My lords, albeit the queen win Mortimer,    Will you be resolute and hold with me? _E. Mor._ Not I, against my nephew. _Pem._ Fear not; the queen's words cannot alter him. _War._ No? do but mark how earnestly she pleads! _Lan._ And see how coldly his looks make denial! _War._ She smiles: now, for my life, his mind is chang'd! _Lan._ I'll rather lose his friendship, I, than grant. _Y. Mor._ Well, of necessity it must be so.--    My lords, that I abhor base Gaveston    I hope your honours make no question.    And therefore, though I plead for his repeal,    'Tis not for his sake, but to our avail;    Nay, for the realm's behoof, and for the king's. _Lan._ Fie, Mortimer, dishonour not thyself!    Can this be true, 'twas good to banish him?    And is this true, to call him home again?    Such reasons make white black, and dark night day. _Y. Mor._ My Lord of Lancaster, mark the respect. _Lan._ In no respect can contraries be true. _Q. Isab._ Yet, good my lord, hear what he can allege. _War._ All that he speaks is nothing; we are resolv'd. _Y. Mor._ Do you not wish that Gaveston were dead? _Pem._ I would he were! _Y. Mor._ Why, then, my lord, give me but leave to speak. _E. Mor._ But, nephew, do not play the sophister. _Y. Mor._ This which I urge is of a burning zeal    To mend the king and do our country good.    Know you not Gaveston hath store of gold,    Which may in Ireland purchase him such friends    As he will front the mightiest of us all?    And whereas he shall live and be belov'd,    'Tis hard for us to work his overthrow. _War._ Mark you but that, my lord of Lancaster. _Y. Mor._ But, were he here, detested as he is,    How easily might some base slave be suborn'd    To greet his lordship with a poniard,    And none so much as blame the murderer,    But rather praise him for that brave attempt,    And in the chronicle enrol his name    For purging of the realm of such a plague! _Pem._ He saith true. _Lan._ Ay, but how chance this was not done before? _Y. Mor._ Because, my lords, it was not thought upon.    Nay, more, when he shall know it lies in us    To banish him, and then to call him home,    'Twill make him vail the top flag of his pride,    And fear to offend the meanest nobleman. _E. Mor._ But how if he do not, nephew? _Y. Mor._ Then may we with some colour rise in arms;    For, howsoever we"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20289"],["title","Herein is Love (#1)"],["body","ough, at least, to set a good example, so that people will know what they're supposed to live up to and to do. After all, Jesus told us how we should live, and He did so in such simple words that even children can understand them. All we have to do--and it's written there for us to read--is to keep the commandments, imitate Jesus, and live a good life for ourselves and others.\"  \"Yes, but if it's that simple, why don't church people live better--\"  \"Not at all! _Not at all!_\" pronounced the stately Mr. Knowles with some disdain. \"I don't agree with any of you. Our difficulties today result from the ignorance of our people, and the answer to the problem is education. We need to teach, and teach again. Church people must know their faith and know why they believe in it. When I was a child I was drilled thoroughly in the knowledge of the Bible, and I once won a prize for knowing more Bible verses than any other child. We need more adult education, and our children must be filled with the truth so they can recite it forwards and backwards. In my estimation, there is too much emphasis now on persons and not enough on the content of the faith.\"  \"But didn't Jesus say, 'For God so loved the world--'\"  \"It seems to me,\" interrupted Professor Manby, \"that all of you are in too much of a hurry. Some scientists estimate that man has been eight million years coming to his present state of life. In contrast, civilized man is only four thousand years old. This being true, we should be more patient. Given time, man will solve his problems.\"  \"But has man's character developed in pace with his knowl--\"  At that moment the Reverend Mr. Gates, with several other members of the committee, came into the room, and after greeting everyone he said: \"Now let's get down to business. As you know, I've called this meeting in order that we may consider the purpose of our church in this community. I think we need a clearer understanding of why we are here. I wish we could be surer that we are serving God's purposes and not our own. I wish we all would assume as true that God's purposes for His church and for us are greater than anything we may think they are, and that we would hold our opinions and beliefs open to His correction and renewal.\"  \"How can we be any clearer about the purpose of this church than to keep it open and its organizations going, so that people can come to it if they want to,\" exclaimed Mr. Churchill abruptly.  Mr. Wise now got to his feet, and with a twinkle in his eye began speaking: \"You've all interrupted me several times, but now I'm going to speak my piece. I think Mr. Gates is right. We do need occasionally to rethink the reason for our existence as a church, lest it become a private club that caters to our own special needs. Our discussion so far tonight suggests that we want the church to be what we need it to be. We want God cut down to our own pattern and size. It may be that our church is too small for God, and that we'll turn out to be a religious, but godless, club.\"  \"But how could that happen to us?\" protested Mrs. Strait. \"If we do what's right, God will love us and use us as His obedient servants.\"  \"I wish Mr. Gates would set us straight on these matters. Were you going to say anything more, Pastor?\" inquired Mr. Clarke.  \"Yes, I'll have more to say,\" replied Mr. Gates slowly, \"but this is not my problem only. That's why I called you together. We need to help each other think this question through. But to do that, we all shall need the spirit of Christ to help us. We need to look at the concepts and meanings that we bring out of our lives in the light of Christ's teachings and example. He brought the gift of God's love, but He brought also a judgment that was most disturbing to religious people. Instead of our judging what is good for Christ, I pray that He will judge us, and help us to be the instruments of His love.\"  \"But you're our minister and teacher, so why don't you tell us what you think the job of the church is in this community? I'm sure we'd all support you in whatever you might suggest,\" urged Mr. Clarke.  \"Mr. Clarke, I am not the church. I appreciate your confidence in me, but I am only one member of the church. The fact that I am ordained does not make me any more responsible for the church than you are, and I refuse to assume your responsibilities for you. Instead, I want to use my role as an ordained member of the church, and such training and experience as I have had, to help you find _your_ role, so that together we can carry on the functions of the church in ways that will serve God and His people.\"  When Mr. Gates finished speaking there was silence. The reactions of his hearers were varied, showing anxiety, irritation, confusion, and blankness. And no wonder! The spontaneous discussion that had gone on before Mr. Gates' arrival had revealed how little their understandings of the church had prepared them to hear the question he was raising. The viewpoints they had brought to the meeting now closed their minds to the meanings he was trying to open to them.  What, then, were those concepts and meanings that made it so difficult for them to hear and understand their minister? Each of them represented a point of view that is widely prevalent in the church today and which keeps the church from being fully relevant and effective.   _Clericalism_  When Mr. Clarke thought about the church, he did so in terms of the clergy and their work in the church. We might call him a \"clericalizer\"; that is, one who thinks that only the minister does the work of the church. This idea is the basis of clericalism, the disease which saps the strength of the church because one part of the body, the ordained minister, is made to do the work of the rest of the body, the unordained members. In the discussion Mr. Gates took exception to this idea, and rightly so, for it results in a clergy that is overworked and frustrated. Indeed, they find it impossible to do all that needs to be done. And yet the idea has a hidden appeal for many of them, for it feeds their professional pride and arrogance. But the damage done by this disease does not cease there. It also makes for church people who are lazy, who feel that the church belongs to the clergy, and who are not themselves instruments through which God works in the world. God is kept from doing what He would do for them, because He cannot do through the clergy what He would do through the whole of His church.  Clericalism blocks the ministry of the church, because it tends to make lay members second-class citizens who feel incompetent on matters of religion. When the ordained member makes religious interpretation and action his professional monopoly, the lay member responds by exhibiting increasing ignorance and incompetence. Sometimes it seems as if lay people show less intelligence in the church than in their world. It is as though the practice of religion had a stupefying effect on them, whereas in other areas of living they are intelligent, informed, and perceptive. This clericalizing of the church's ministry produces in lay members the sense that religion is separate from life. They are heard to say to their ministers, \"You stick to religion and leave the affairs of the world to us.\" Religion thus becomes a Sunday business, and Sunday business is kept separate from weekday business.  Still another and related ill effect of clericalism is that it keeps laymen from discovering the religious significance of their work. Parents, for example, are not only parents entrusted with the physical, psychological, and social care of their children, but also are the teachers, pastors, and priests of their children. A teacher may serve God in his teaching, a doctor in his practice of medicine, a businessman in the conduct of his business, a milkman in the delivery of milk, and the garbageman in the collection of garbage. It is the business of the church to help these members find their ministry, but clericalism never allows them to make the discovery.  Clericalism, like any other concept, is more than a set of ideas. Mr. Clarke didn't just happen to hold that notion of the church. He held it because he needed it. His need grew out of his dependency, his timidity, and his fear of assuming responsibility. He needed to exalt the clergy. He wanted to be told what to believe and to do; and his \"doctrine\" of the ministry, namely, clericalism, justified him in his need. People who want to be told what to believe and to do inevitably will develop or drift toward a doctrine that is authenticated by their need.  Ministers also contribute to the prevalence of clericalism. All men have a very human and understandable need to be centrally important and indispensable, and ministers are tempted to exploit this need in the conduct of their work. It is only natural for them to think of the church as \"my church,\" of the people as \"my people,\" and of the ministry as \"my ministry.\" These images cause them to function as if everything depended upon them, and as if they wanted everyone to depend upon them. Indeed, they may even measure the success of their ministry by the number of people who depend upon them for guidance and support, rather than by the number who are achieving mature self-sufficiency. As a part of this same picture, some ministers are unable to accept suggestions, much less criticism. The clericalized image they hold of themselves is that of an \"answer man\"; that is, one who has all the answers to human problems, and always right answers.  Thus, clericalism is a condition contributed to by both the ordained and the lay members of the church, and it tragically diminishes the power of the church. It is a symptom of Mr. Clarke's fear and of our own. It shows that we are afraid to trust God and to let His Spirit work through the whole of His people.   _Churchism_  Mr. Churchill's ideas, on the other hand, represented a different concept, one which may be called churchism, or "]]]
