Presently I began to feel drowsy; my nerves seemed to get unstrung, and my circulation flagged.  It was long after the time I had generally been in the habit of being wound up; and I began to be afraid I was really going to be left to go to sleep.  That, by this time, I knew would be nothing short of a calamity.  I therefore gave a slight tug at my chain.  \"What's the matter?\" it said, looking down.  \"I've not been wound up.\"  \"I can't help that,\" said the chain.  \"Can't you let him know somehow?\"  I gasped, faintly.  \"How can I?  He's busy packing up books.\"  \"Couldn't you catch yourself in his fingers or something?  I'm in a bad way.\"  \"I'll see,\" said the chain.  Presently I felt an awful tug at my neck, and I knew the chain had managed to entangle itself somehow with his fingers.  \"Hullo!\"  I heard my master exclaim, \"I mustn't smash Charlie's chain before I give it to him.  I'd better put it and the watch away in my drawer till the morning.  Heigho! it'll be a sad day for me to-morrow!\"  As he spoke he drew me from the pocket, and, disengaging the chain from his button-hole, he laid us both in a drawer and shut it up.  I was in despair, and already was nearly swooning from weakness.  He had shut the drawer, and his hand was still on the knob, when all of a sudden he exclaimed,--  \"By the way, I must wind it up, or it'll stop!\"  With what joy and relief I saw the drawer again opened, and felt myself taken out and wound up!  Instantly new life seemed to infuse itself through my frame; my circulation revived, my nerves were strung again, and my drooping heart resumed its usual healthy throb.  Little did my master think of the difference this winding up made to my health and comfort.  \"Now you're happy!\" said the chain, as we found ourselves once more in the drawer.  \"Yes; I'm all right now, I'm glad to say,\" said I.  \"What's going to happen to us to-morrow?\"  I asked presently.  \"We're going to be given to the boy, and he's going to school;\" so the silver chain told me.  \"Nice time we shall have of it, I expect.\"  After that he went to sleep, and I fell to counting the seconds, and wondering what sort of life I was destined to lead.  About an hour after I heard two voices talking in the room.  \"Well,\" said one, and I recognised it at once as my master's, \"the packing's all finished at last.\"  \"Ah, Charles,\" said the other, and it seemed to be a woman's voice speaking amid tears, \"I never thought it would be so hard to part with him.\"  \"Tut, tut!\" said the first, \"you mustn't give way, Mary.  You women are so ready to break down.  He'll soon be back;\" but before my master had got to the end of his sentence he too had broken down.  For a long time they talked about their boy, their fine boy who had never before left his parents' roof, and was about now to step out into the treacherous world.  How they trembled for him, yet how proudly and confidently they spoke of his prospects; how lovingly they recalled all their life together, from the days when he could first toddle about, down to the present.  Many tears were mingled with their talk, and many a smothered sob bespoke a desperate effort to subdue their common sorrow.  At last they became quieter, then I heard my master say,--  \"I positively have never shown you the watch I got for him,\" and with that he opened the drawer and produced me.  \"Oh, Charles,\" cried the mother, \"how delighted he will be, and what a capital watch it is!\"  And she looked at me affectionately for a long time, for her son's sake, smiling through her tears, and then put me back.  Need I say that as these two knelt together that night, their only son was not forgotten in their prayers?  So ended the first day of my adventures.    CHAPTER TWO.  HOW I WAS PRESENTED TO A BOY, AND OF A CERTAIN JOURNEY WE TOOK TOGETHER.  Very early next morning, when my hands scarcely pointed to five o'clock, the little household was astir.  There was a noise of hurried going and coming, and of trunks being carried down stairs, and for the first time I heard mingled with the sedate voices of my master and his wife, another voice, cheery and musical, which I at once guessed to belong to my future lord and master.  It was not till after this bustle had been going on for a good while that I was taken out of the drawer and put back into the pocket in which I had spent so many anxious hours the day before.  But here I was destined not to remain long, as will be seen.  Breakfast was a sad meal to that little family.  Even the gay, high- spirited boy was sobered in anticipation of the coming parting, and as to his parents, they dared not open their lips for fear of breaking down.  Then there was a rumbling of wheels in the street, and a banging about of boxes at the hall door; then a last long embrace between mother and son.  She no longer resisted her grief, and he for the time forgot everything but her he was leaving; then father and son stepped into the cab and drove away.  I felt the father's heart beating quicker and his chest heaving deeper as we proceeded.  Presently his hand stole to the pocket where I lay hid, and he said--  \"Charlie, boy, I've said all I have to say to you.  You will remember our talk last night, I am sure, and I shall remember it too.  I have no greater wish than to see my boy brave and honest and true to himself. Remember always I am your father, and never hesitate to tell me whenever you are in trouble, or danger, or--and I hope this won't often be--in disgrace.  See here,\" said he, drawing me forth, \"this is a watch which your mother and I have got for you.  Think of us when you use it; and mind this, Charlie, make the best use of time, or time will become your enemy.\"  The poor man faltered out these words with a half-broken heart, as he handed me to his son.  The boy's eyes brightened and his face became radiant at the sight of his unexpected treasure.  What boy does not covet a watch of his own at some time or other?  \"Oh, father!\" he cried, \"how good and kind of you!  What a beauty!\"  The father smiled to see his son's delight, and helped to fasten the chain to his button-hole.  \"You and mother are bricks!\" exclaimed Charlie, feasting his eyes upon me, and half wild with delight.  \"How _did_ you know I was longing to have one?\"  \"Were you?\" inquired the father.  \"Of course I was, and you knew it.  What a swell I shall be!  And it will always be sure to remind me of home.\"  While this talk was going on I had leisure to examine my new owner. Picture to yourselves a curly-haired, bright-eyed boy of thirteen with honest, open face, good features, and winning smile.  He is big for his age, and strongly built.  At present his form is arrayed in a brand-new suit of grey; his collar is new and his tie is new, his boots are new and his socks are new; everything is new about him, down to the very guard of his hat, and he himself is the newest and purest of all.  Was ever such a radiant young hero turned loose into the world?  And now, over and above his other glories, he had me to crown all.  The graceful curve of my chain on his waistcoat gave that garment quite a distinguished appearance, and the consciousness of a silver watch in his pocket made him hold his head even higher than usual.  \"He is a beauty!\" again he broke out, \"exactly the kind I like most. I'll take ever such a lot of care of him.\"  And so saying, he began to swing me at the end of the chain, till I suddenly came sharply into collision with the door of the cab.  \"Hullo,\" exclaimed my young master, \"that won't do.  I'll put him away now.  It _was_ good of you, father.\"  With that we reached the railway station, and in the bustle that ensued I was for the time forgotten.  Charlie's trunks were duly labelled for Randlebury, and then came the hardest moment of all, when father and son must part.  \"I wonder if you'll be altered, Charlie, when I see you again.\"  \"Not for the worse I hope, anyhow,\" replied the boy, laughing.  \"Tickets, please!\" demanded the guard.  \"There goes the bell,\" said Charlie, pulling me out of his pocket. \"They're very punctual.  Hullo, we're off!  Good-bye, father.\"  \"Good-bye, boy, and God bless you.\"  And there was a close grasp of the hand, a last smile, a hasty wave from the window; and then we were off.  How many grown-up men are there who cannot recall at some time or other this crisis in their lives, this first good-bye from the home of their childhood, this stepping forth into the world with all that is familiar and dear at their backs, and all that is strange and unknown and wonderful stretching away like a vast landscape before them?  How many are there who would not give much to be back once more at that threshold of their career; and to have the chance of living over again the life they began there with such bright hopes and such careless confidence? Ah, if some of them could have seen whither that flower-strewn path was to lead them, would they not rather have chosen even to die on the threshold, than take so much as the first step forth from the innocent home of childhood!  But I am wandering from my story.  For half an hour after that last good-bye Charlie leaned back in the corner of his carriage and gave himself up to his loneliness, and I could feel his chest heaving to keep down the tears that would every now and then rise unbidden to his eyes.  But what boy of thirteen can be in the dumps for long?  Especially if he has a new watch in his pocket.  Charlie was himself again before we had well got clear of London, and his reviving spirits gradually recalled to his memory his father's parting gift, which had for a while been half forgotten amid other cares.  Now again I was produced, I was turned over and over, was listened to, was peeped into, was flourished about, was taken off my chain, and put on again with the supremest satisfaction.  At every station we came to, out I"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21035"],["title","The Adventures of a Three-Guinea Watch (#2)"],["body","from his pocket, to be compared with the railway time.  By the clock at Batfield I was a minute slow--a discrepancy which was no sooner discovered than I felt my glass face opened, and a fat finger and thumb putting forward my hand to the required time.  At Norbely I was two minutes fast by the clock, and then (oh, horrors!)  I found myself put back in the same rough-and-ready way.  At Maltby I was full half a minute behind the great clock, and on I went again.  At the next station the clock and I both gave the same time to a second, and then what must he do but begin to regulate me!  After a minute calculation he made the astounding discovery that I had lost a minute and a quarter in four hours, and that in order to compensate for this shortcoming it would be necessary for him to move my regulator forward the two hundred and fortieth part of an inch.  This feat he set himself to accomplish with the point of his scarf-pin while the train was jolting forward at the rate of thirty miles an hour!  I began to grow nervous.  If this was a sample of what I was to expect, I had indeed need be the healthy, hardy watch I was represented to be by my maker.  And yet I could not be angry with my brave, honest little tormentor.  It was a sight to see him during that long journey, in all the glory of a new suit, with a high hat on his head for the first time, and a watch in his pocket.  _In_ his pocket, did I say?  I was hardly ever so lucky. Every five minutes he whipped me out to see how the time was going.  If he polished me up once with his handkerchief, he did it twenty times, and each time with such vigour that I was nearly red-hot under the operation.  And no sooner was he tired of polishing me, than he took to paying his hat the same attention, till that wretched article of decoration must have trembled for its nap.  Then he would take to whistling and singing (what boy can help doing one or the other in a train?) and as I heard all his little artless songs and gay chirping, I thought it the pleasantest music one could possibly listen to.  And, not to let his hands be less busy than his throat, he would bring out the wonderful six-bladed knife his uncle had given him, and exploring all its wonders, and opening all its blades at the same time, together with the corkscrew, the gimlet, the pincers, and the button-hook, at different angles, would terrify the lives out of his fellow-passengers by twirling the awful bristling weapon in his fingers within a foot or so of their faces.  \"Mind, dear,\" said an old lady on the seat opposite, \"you'll cut your fingers off, I'm certain.\"  \"Oh, no, I won't,\" exclaimed he, taking out his handkerchief, and beginning to polish the blades one after another.  The old lady trembled as she watched him, and sighed with relief when the operation was over.  Presently, having nothing particular to do, he stared at her.  \"Would you like to know the time, ma'am?\" he inquired.  \"If you please,\" replied the good old soul.  \"Well, it's just seventeen minutes and nineteen seconds past three by my watch.  Would you like to see for yourself, ma'am?\"  And, pleased to have a confidant of his possessions, he loosed my chain, and flourished me bodily before the eyes of his new friend.  She took me kindly, and said, \"What a fine watch you've got, dear?\"  \"Yes,\" replied he, with lofty condescension; \"like to see his works?\"  \"You should be careful, you know,\" she said, \"watches so easily get out of order.\"  \"Oh, I won't hurt it,\" said he, proceeding to take off my coat and waistcoat.  \"There! there are his works.  Don't breathe hard, or you'll damp them.\"  So the old lady held her breath and peeped in, much to my young master's gratification.  \"And so you're going to school, my man?\" said she presently.  \"Yes; who told you!  Did my father tell you?\"  \"No, I guessed.\"  \"Did you though?  Can you guess what the name of the school is?\"  \"No, I can't do that.\"  \"Have a try.\"  \"Well, then, I guess Randlebury, because my boy is there, and it's the only one I can think of.\"  The boy stared at her.  \"How ever did you know that?\"  \"What!\" she exclaimed, \"you don't mean to tell me you _are_ going to Randlebury?\"  \"I am, though.\"  \"Well, I never,\" cried the good old soul, \"who would have believed it! Think of your going to the same school as my Tom.\"  \"Is Tom your boy's name?\"  \"Yes.\"  \"Is he a nice boy?\"  Such a question to ask any one's mother!  The old lady burst into tears instead of answering--a proceeding which greatly alarmed and disconcerted my master.  \"Don't cry,\" he said excitedly.  \"Look here!  I didn't mean--oh, don't! Look here, shall I tell you the time?  It's--it's sixteen minutes to four--I didn't mean, you know.  Of course he's a nice boy--oh, don't cry!\"  And he got into such a state that the old lady dried her eyes at once.  \"Never mind me, dear,\" said she, \"it wasn't you made me cry: it was thinking of my Tom.  You'll be a good friend to him, won't you, dear?\"  \"Perhaps he won't like me.\"  \"Now I'm sure he will,\" exclaimed the lady warmly; so warmly that I quite loved her for my little master's sake.  Both were silent for some time, and then Charlie asked,--  \"I say, has he got a watch?\"  \"No.\"  \"Oh, never mind,\" said he, in a tone of evident relief, \"I can tell him the time, you know, whenever he wants to know.\"  \"To be sure you can.\"  Then Charlie took to polishing me and the chain up again, an occupation which lasted until we arrived at Gunborough Junction, where passengers changed for Randlebury.  \"Good-bye, dear,\" said the old lady, as Charlie proceeded to get together his things.  \"Good-bye,\" said he.  \"Would you like to know the time before I go? It's eight past five.  Good-bye.\"  \"May I give you a kiss?\" said she.  Charlie blushed, but offered his cheek hurriedly.  \"And you promise to be a good friend to Tom,\" said she, kissing him, \"won't you?\"  \"All right,\" said the boy, jumping out on to the platform, and running to see after his luggage.  In a moment however he returned to the window and put his head in.  \"I say,\" said he, \"what's his name--Tom what?\"  \"Drift,\" said the old lady, \"Tom Drift!\"  \"Oh!\" replied my master, \"all right, good-bye;\" and next minute the train went on, and he was left standing surrounded by his luggage in the middle of the platform, like a lighthouse in the middle of an island.    CHAPTER THREE.  HOW MY MASTER AND I REACH RANDLEBURY IN STATE, AND OF A GREAT CALAMITY.  My master and I had nearly an hour to wait on the platform at Gunborough before the Randlebury train came up.  Part of this interval Charlie, for fear he might forget to do it at night, devoted to winding me up; an experiment which nearly closed my career for ever, for he first began to turn the key the wrong way; then, when he had discovered his mistake, he started in the other direction with a sudden dash, and finally overwound me to such an extent that I expected every second to hear my heart break with the strain.  Then he sat on his boxes, whistling to himself and drumming his heels on the platform.  The train came up at last, and in he jumped, finding himself and a grave elderly gentleman in joint possession of the carriage.  Charlie was too busy staring out of the window, whistling, and brushing the dust off his new hat, to take much notice of his companion until the train was fairly started; then, observing the gentleman look at his watch, the boy at once recognised a bond of sympathy and pulled out me.  \"I wonder if I'm the same as you?\" he said eagerly.  \"I hope you are not,\" said the gentleman, \"for I'm a quarter of an hour fast.\"  \"Are you though?\" said the boy, in astonishment.  \"Why don't you put it right?  I would.\"  \"It's a bad thing to put a watch back, my boy; besides, I rather like keeping mine a little fast.\"  \"Do you?  I say, do you think my watch is a good one?\" said Charlie, thrusting me into the hands of his astonished travelling companion.  \"I can't say, my boy.  I know nothing about watches.  It looks a nice one.\"  \"Yes, father gave it me.  I say, are you going to Randlebury?\"  \"Yes.\"  \"Do you know the school?  I'm going there.\"  \"Oh, yes; I know the school.  And you are going there, are you?\" inquired the gentleman, with interest.  \"Yes, I'm a new boy, you know.\"  \"And how do you like going to school?\"  \"Oh, all right; only I don't know what it'll be like.  Eat I say, I don't suppose there's many of the boys my age have got watches, do you?\"  The gentleman laughed.  \"I dare say not,\" he said.  Charlie was silent for a time, and then asked,--  \"I say, what sort of fellow's the head master; do you know?\"  \"I've seen him now and then,\" said the gentleman.  \"Is he awfully stuck-up and strict?\" asked the boy anxiously.  \"I really don't know,\" said the gentleman, biting his lips; \"I hope not.\"  \"So do I.  I wish my father was the head master,\" said Charlie, the tears for a moment starting to his eyes at the bare thought of such happiness.  The gentleman looked at him very kindly, and said,--  \"Cheer up, my little man; perhaps it won't be so bad after all.\"  Charlie smiled again as he said,--  \"Oh, yes, I've got to be brave, you know, because I promised father. But I say, if you ever come to the school, ask for me--my name's Charlie Newcome--will you? because I don't know any of the fellows; and besides,\" added he, brightening at the idea, \"we can see if our watches are going the same, you know.\"  The gentleman promised, and soon after this the train arrived at Randlebury.  The boy bid his companion farewell, and went off as before to look after his belongings.  As he was standing surrounded by his baggage, a man in the dress of a coachman came up to him and said,--  \"Are you the young party from London for the school?\"  \"Yes,\" replied the boy.  \"It's all right,\" said the man; \"give us hold of these things, and jump inside my trap.\"  \"How far is it?\" he asked of the man.  \"Better of three miles.\"  \"Is it, though?  I say, can't you put the things inside, and then I can ride"]]]
