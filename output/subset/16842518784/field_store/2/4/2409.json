The genus differs from Xylaria in having the fruiting bodies on the ends of branches, which in one species are dichotomous, or in the other two species sessile or subsessile and borne on a slender rhachis. There are conflicting accounts of the structure of these bodies. The original, by Ehrenberg, represents them as hollow bodies, with the perithecia imbedded in the walls. That also is as shown by Cooke and is the usual idea. Moeller, on the contrary, represents each body as a perithecium, and our examination confirms Moeller's view. If Moeller's account is true, as it seems to be, it is a strong reason why Thamnomyces should not be classed with Xylaria.  The usual Xylaria has a white, sterile, central portion known as the stroma, bearing a carbonous crust. The perithecia are generally imbedded in the outer portion of the stroma, the mouths opening through the carbonous crust. The walls of the perithecia are carbonous, and confluent with the crust. The genus Thamnomyces has a slender stem, entirely carbonous. This seems to have been the main difference between it and Xylaria in the old classification, but the character is fallacious.  There are Species of Xylaria that have no white stroma. The stem is slender and carbonous and bears the carbonous fruit bodies, superficial, but sessile and globose. Fries proposed for these species, the generic name Rhizomorpha, which Saccardo united with Thamnomyces as a section of Xylaria. In my view it is an entirely different idea from Thamnomyces and should form a section in itself in the genus Xylaria. There are Several species like Xylaria scopiformis that intimately connect Rhizomorpha with Xylaria.  We believe the genus Thamnomyces, in the true sense, embraces only three species as follows:   [Illustration: #Fig. 850.#]  THAMNOMYCES CHAMISSONIS (Fig. 850).--Stem Carbonous, black, smooth, repeatedly dichotomously branched, the ultimate branches bearing ovate, acute fruiting bodies. Structure of these bodies shown by Moeller is entirely carbonous, hollow, each forming a single, carbonous perithecium. Spores shown by different authors as of different shapes and sizes. In our specimens they are 9 × 20-28 mic., dark, and arctuate. They closely resemble the ordinary Xylaria spore.  This was originally named from Brazil by Ehrenberg, who gave a good illustration of it. It has therefore escaped all synonyms, excepting by Cooke, who discovered it was a new species and called it Thamnomyces dendroidea. Hennings also discovered it from Africa, first as a new variety, then as a new species, Thamnomyces camerunensis, but of course everything that came to Hennings must be \"new\" something. It grows on rotten, hard wood, and does not seem frequent in our American tropics. In Africa, however, I judge it is more abundant as numbers of African collections are in the museum at Berlin. We have only received it once, at nice specimen (Fig. 850) from R. H. Bunting, Gold Coast, Africa.   [Illustration: #Fig. 851.#]  THAMNOMYCES CHORDALIS (Fig. 851).--Stem long, slender, several proceeding from a common base, entirely carbonous, black, smooth. Fruiting bodies (or perithecia?) sessile along the stem, ovate, with slender apices, black. Spores oblong, arctuate, dark.  This, I believe, is only known from tropical America, but is apparently not rare as it is recorded a number of times, mostly from Brazil. Fries named it from French Guiana in 1830 and gave a characteristic description of it. A co-type with the fruit mostly gone is at Kew. Later Montagne got it also from French Guiana and gave a good figure and description under the name Thamnomyces rostratus. He thought it was different from Fries' species on account of the spores not being globose, but the \"globose\" spores of the original description is doubtless an error. The plants are surely the same. As Montagne's figure is characteristic, the plant when subsequently found has usually been recorded under his name. We present in our figure both Montagne's and Fries' type.   [Illustration: #Fig. 852.#]  THAMNOMYCES FUCIFORMIS (Fig. 852).--In general appearance, this is the same as Thamnomyces chordalis, but a much larger plant. The fruit bodies (perithecia?) are more slender and are short, stalked. Our figure, which is about half the spike, will show exactly the difference between the two species. The plant was named by Berkeley from specimens collected in Brazil by Spruce, and to this day is only known from this old collection. The name is from the habits, \"those of a fucus rather than a fungus,\" a far-fetched comparison, for my impression is there are no fuci that are carbonous, or have much resemblance to this plant.   RELATED PLANTS.  The following plants are compiled in the section Thamnomyces in Saccardo. None of them are true Thamnomyces, and most of them could go into Fries' genera Rhizomorpha. I do not believe, however, it is possible to keep Rhizomorpha separate from Xylaria. The type species Xylaria setosa is quite different from the normal type of Xylarias in having entirely carbonous, filiform stems and superficial perithecia, but both of these features merge into Xylaria through so many intermediate species that there is no drawing the line of demarcation.   [Illustration: #Fig. 853.#]  XYLARIA SETOSA (Fig. 853).--Stem densely fasciculate, filiform, black, entirely carbonous. Perithecia ovate, sparse, rarely developed. Spores (teste Fuckel), ovoid, dark, 10 × 16 mic.  This is a rare plant in Europe, growing on old sacks, matting, carpets, and similar refuse. It is generally found in cellars. I think it is not known on wood nor recorded in the United States. It resembles carbonized horse hair and was called \"horse hair usnea\" by old Dillenius. Our photograph of the specimen at Kew will give a good idea of it, although from the account it grows erect, and is not matted. Both Bulliard and Sowerby gave characteristic figures, both from plants growing in cellars, on old mats. It has had a great number of names, and is recorded in Saccardo as Xylaria hippotrichoides, the specific name proposed by Sowerby and used by Persoon. Some very recent juggler, I have forgotten who, dug up the old name setosa, which I adopt as being less cumbersome. Occasionally these jugglers do propose some improvement in names, and I believe in encouraging them, when their wonderful date dictionary discoveries are really better names. Saccardo gives the following synonyms: Sphaeria hippotrichoides, Ceratonema hippotrichoides, Hypoxylon loculiferum, Rhizomorpha tuberculosa, Cryptothamnium usneaeforme, Rhizomorpha setiformis, Chaenocarpus setosus, Chaenocarpus Simonini. The date expert must have had quite a job.      Xylaria adnata as described by Fuckel (Rhizomorpha adnata), and     unknown to me, is evidently very similar to the preceding plant,     but grows closely adnate to rotten beech wood.      Xylaria fragilis (Rhizomorpha fragilis) is imperfectly known     from old records in Europe. It is probably same as above.      Xylaria hispidissima (Rhizomorpha hispidissima) from East Indies     is known only from old description. It is an evident Xylaria and     seems to be same as recently collected, adventitious in a hot     house in Hungary, and distributed as Xylaria hungarica.      Xylaria annulata, described in 1820 from West Indies as     Thamnomyces annulatus and unknown otherwise, reads like     Thamnomyces chardalis, but the branches of the latter are not     known to be \"annulated under a lens.\"   [Illustration: #Fig. 854.#]  XYLARIA ANNULIPES, described and figured by Montagne as Thamnomyces annulipes from Brazil, is same as since named Xylaria marasmoides (Fig. 854) by Berkeley. Berkeley does not mention the rings on the stem as shown so plainly in Montagne's enlarged figure, nor can I note them with a lens on my photograph of Berkeley's or Montagne's types. Spegazzini refers marasmoides as a synonym for annulipes, no doubt correctly. Theissen refers it as a synonym for Xylaria aristata, an evident error. Xylaria vermiculus, recently published from Brazil by Sydow, as \"Saccardo n. sp. in litt.,\" is, both from description and photograph, evidently the same as Xylaria annulipes.   [Illustration: #Fig. 855.#]  XYLARIA MELANURA (Fig. 855), West Indies, described as Chaenocarpus melanurus and compiled in Saccardo in section Thamnomyces, is evidently same as Xylaria gracillima in sense of Berkeley and Montagne, but not I believe as to Fries. We present a photograph made from Léveillé's cotype.      Xylaria axillaris was not compiled in Thamnomyces in Saccardo,     but is evidently a very similar if not the same plant as Xylaria     setosa, and is only known from Currey's original account from     Africa. It is about a half inch high, with filiform stem, and     few, superficial perithecia. Spores are given as 25 to 32 mic.,     which are much larger than those of setosa.      Xylaria patagonica as named by Crombie as Thamnomyces and     compiled in Saccardo, Vol. 9, was based on Dillenius' old (1741)     figure t. 13, f. 11, from Patagonia, which, as far as the figure     goes, could be Xylaria setosa. Of course, nothing as known about     it.      Xylaria Schwackei, named by Hennings from Brazil, seems from     description to be Xylaria melanura.      Xylaria Warburgii, named by Hennings from New Guinea, seems from     the crude figure to be Xylaria carpophila.      Xylaria luzonensis, named from Philippines by Hennings, seems     from crude figure to be Xylaria multiplex in original sense of     Fries (not Thiessen).         *       *       *       *       *     [Illustration: #Fig. 856.# Engleromyces Goetzei.]  THE GENUS ENGLEROMYCES.

We have known since Borrow another great Englishman who held a similar faith, Charles Gordon; and the lives of both supply so many instances of what look like acts of special protection, that the question will present itself to the student of their lives whether there may not be some such connexion between faith and miracle, as our Saviour asserted.  At any rate, we shall never understand Borrow if we exclude from our notion of religion the idea of the miraculous, meaning by that word not the contravention of natural law, but the providential guidance of events.  There is one special side of this doctrine of Providence which must be referred to specially, because Borrow himself calls attention to it in the curious commentary which he annexed to \"The Romany Rye\"; the doctrine so familiar to the last generation in the poems of Browning, that trouble, to which \"man is born, as the sparks fly upward,\" is ordained by the Creator as a stimulus to endeavour, because \"where least man suffers, longest he remains.\"  Some of you may remember that he argues in that appendix that the old man who had learnt Chinese to distract his mind would have played but a sluggard's part in life if no affliction had befallen him, since he had never taken the pains to learn how to tell the time from a clock.  \"Nothing but extreme agony,\" says Borrow, \"could have induced such a man to do anything useful.\"  And every one will recall the passage in \"Lavengro\" where he speaks of the fit of horrors that attacked his hero, may we not say himself, when recovering from an illness.  \"In the recollection and prospect of such woe,\" he asks, \"Is it not lawful to exclaim, 'Better that I had never been born'\"?  And he replies, \"Fool, for thyself thou wast not born, but to fulfil the inscrutable decrees of thy Creator; and how dost thou know that this dark principle is not, after all, thy best friend; that it is not that which tempers the whole mass of thy corruption?  It may be, for what thou knowest, the mother of wisdom and of great works, it is the dread of the horror of the night that makes the pilgrim hasten on his way.  When thou feelest it nigh, let thy safety word be 'Onward!'  If thou tarry, thou art overwhelmed. Courage!  Build great works; 'tis urging thee.\"  In the passage just quoted Borrow speaks of God's \"inscrutable\" decrees. After sitting as a young man at the feet of William Taylor and learning from him some philosophy and much scepticism, he had come back to the old Hebrew idea that in religion reverence was the beginning of wisdom.  This did not mean that he had discarded Western science, or put a bridle upon his own insatiable curiosity.  No man was more ready to learn what could anyhow or anywhere be learned.  It meant that when all had been learned that science could teach, the really vital questions remained still without an answer, because natural science can throw no light on what nature itself really is.  The only clue within our reach to that first and last problem lay, in his judgment, with the simple-hearted and lowly- minded, those in whom this wonderful world still aroused wonder.  In thus calling to the soul of man not to lose its power of wonder, Borrow is in sympathy with the deepest thought of our time.           For ah! how surely,    How soon and surely will disenchantment come,    When first to herself she boasts to walk securely,    And drives the master spirit away from his home;    Seeing the marvellous things that make the morning    Are marvels of every day, familiar, and some    Have lost with use, like earthly robes, their adorning,    As earthly joys the charm of a first delight,    And some are fallen from awe to neglect and scorning. {12}  Let us say then with the ancient seer: \"As for me, I would seek unto God; which doeth great things and unsearchable, marvellous things without number.\"     Footnotes:   {12}  Robert Bridges, _Prometheus the Firegiver_, 824."]]]
