Soldiering is not made up of brass bands, swords, and red coats!\"  \"Having read a good deal of history I am well aware of that,\" retorted Miles, who was somewhat offended by the implication contained in the sergeant's remarks.  \"Well, then, you see,\" continued the sergeant, \"all the advantages that you have mentioned, and which my comrade certainly possesses, weigh nothing with him at all just now, because this sudden call to the wars separates him from his poor young wife.\"  \"Wife!\" exclaimed Miles; \"why, he seems to me little more than a boy-- except in size, and perhaps in gravity.\"  \"He is over twenty, and, as to gravity--well, most young fellows would be grave enough if they had to leave a pretty young wife after six months of wedded life.  You see, he married without leave, and so, even if it were a time of peace, his wife would not be recognised by the service.  In wartime he must of course leave her behind him.  It has been a hard job to prevent him from deserting, and now it's all I can do to divert his attention from his sorrow by stirring him up with tales of the recent wars.\"  At this point the inexorable bell rang, doors were banged, whistles sounded, and the journey was resumed.  Arrived at Portsmouth, Miles was quickly involved in the bustle of the platform.  He had made up his mind to have some private conversation with the sergeant as to the possibility of entering her Majesty's service as a private soldier, and was on the point of accompanying his military travelling companions into the comparative quiet of the street when a porter touched his cap--  \"Any luggage, sir?\"  \"Luggage?--a--no--no luggage!\"  It was the first moment since leaving home that the thought of luggage had entered into his brain!  That thought naturally aroused other thoughts, such as lodgings, food, friends, funds, and the like.  On turning to the spot where his military companions had stood, he discovered that they were gone.  Running to the nearest door-way he found it to be the wrong one, and before he found the right one and reached the street the two soldiers had vanished from the scene.  \"You seem to be a stranger here, sir.  Can I direct you?\" said an insinuating voice at his elbow.  The speaker was an elderly man of shabby-genteel appearance and polite address.  Miles did not quite like the look of him.  In the circumstances, however, and with a strangely desolate feeling of loneliness creeping over him, he did not see his way to reject a civil offer.  \"Thank you.  I am indeed a stranger, and happen to have neither friend nor acquaintance in the town, so if you can put me in the way of finding a respectable lodging--a--a _cheap_ one, you will greatly oblige me.\"  \"With pleasure,\" said the man, \"if you will accompany--\"  \"Stay, don't trouble yourself to show me the way,\" interrupted Miles; \"just name a house and the street, that will--\"  \"No trouble at all, sir,\" said the man.  \"I happen to be going in the direction of the docks, and know of excellent as well as cheap lodgings there.\"  Making no further objection, Miles followed his new friend into the street.  For some time, the crowd being considerable and noisy, they walked in silence.  At the time we write of, Portsmouth was ringing with martial music and preparations for war.  At all times the red-coats and the blue-jackets are prominent in the streets of that seaport; for almost the whole of our army passes through it at one period or another, either in going to or returning from \"foreign parts.\"  But at this time there was the additional bustle resulting from the Egyptian war.  Exceptional activity prevailed in its yards, and hurry in its streets.  Recruits, recently enlisted, flocked into it from all quarters, while on its jetties were frequently landed the sad fruits of war in the form of wounded men.  \"Have you ever been in Portsmouth before?\" asked the shabby-genteel man, on reaching a part of the town which was more open and less crowded.  \"Never.  I had no idea it was so large and bustling,\" said Miles.  \"The crowding and bustling is largely increased just now, of course, in consequence of the war in Egypt,\" returned the man.  \"Troops are constantly embarking, and others returning.  It is a noble service!  Men start in thousands from this port young, hearty, healthy, and full of spirit; they return--those of them who return at all--sickly, broken-down, and with no spirit at all except what they soon get poured into them by the publicans.  Yes; commend me to the service of my Queen and country!\"  There was a sneering tone in the man's voice which fired his companion's easily roused indignation.  \"Mind what you say about our Queen while in _my_ company,\" said Miles sternly, stopping short and looking the man full in the face.  \"I am a loyal subject, and will listen to nothing said in disparagement of the Queen or of her Majesty's forces.\"  \"Bless you, sir,\" said the man quickly, \"I'm a loyal subject myself, and wouldn't for the world say a word against her Majesty.  No more would I disparage her troops; but, after all, the army ain't perfect, you know. Even _you_ must admit that, sir.  With all its noble qualities there's room for improvement.\"  There was such an air of sincerity--or at least of assumed humility--in the man's tone and manner that Miles felt it unjustifiable to retain his indignation.  At the same time, he could not all at once repress it, and was hesitating whether to fling off from the man or to forgive him, when the sound of many voices, and of feet tramping in regular time, struck his ear and diverted his attention.  Next moment the head of a regiment, accompanied by a crowd of juvenile admirers, swept round the corner of the street.  At the same instant a forest of bayonets gleamed upon the youth's vision, and a brass band burst with crashing grandeur upon his ear, sending a quiver of enthusiasm into the deepest recesses of his soul, and stirring the very marrow in his bones!  Miles stood entranced until the regiment had passed, and the martial strains were softened by distance; then he looked up and perceived that his shabby companion was regarding him with a peculiar smile.  \"I think you've a notion of being a soldier,\" he said, with a smile.  \"Where is that regiment going?\" asked Miles, instead of answering the question.  \"To barracks at present; to Egypt in a few days.  There'll be more followin' it before long.\"  It was a distracting as well as an exciting walk that Miles had through the town, for at every turn he passed couples or groups of soldiers, or sailors, or marines, and innumerable questions sprang into and jostled each other in his mind, while, at the same moment, his thoughts and feelings were busy with his present circumstances and future prospects. The distraction was increased by the remarks and comments of his guide, and he would fain have got rid of him; but good-feeling, as well as common-sense, forbade his casting him off without sufficient reason.  Presently he stopped, without very well knowing why, in front of a large imposing edifice.  Looking up, he observed the words SOLDIERS' INSTITUTE in large letters on the front of it.  \"What sort of an Institute is that?\" he asked.  \"Oh! it's a miserable affair, where soldiers are taken in cheap, as they say, an' done for,\" returned the shabby man hurriedly, as if the subject were distasteful to him.  \"Come along with me and I'll show you places where soldiers--ay, and civilians too--can enjoy themselves like gentlemen, an' get value for their money.\"  As he spoke, two fine-looking men issued from a small street close to them, and crossed the road--one a soldier of the line, the other a marine.  \"Here it is, Jack,\" exclaimed the soldier to his friend; \"Miss Sarah Robinson's Institoot, that you've heard so much about.  Come an' I'll show you where you can write your letter in peace--\"  Thus much was overheard by Miles as they turned into a side-street, and entered what was obviously one of the poorer districts of the town.  \"Evidently that soldier's opinion does not agree with yours,\" remarked Miles, as they walked along.  \"More's the pity!\" returned the shabby man, whose name he had informed his companion was Sloper.  \"Now we are getting among places, you see, where there's a good deal of drinking going on.\"  \"I scarcely require to be told that,\" returned Miles, curtly; for he was beginning to feel his original dislike to Mister Sloper intensified.  It did not indeed require any better instructor than eyes and ears to inform our hero that the grog-shops around him were full, and that a large proportion of the shouting and swearing revellers inside were soldiers and seamen.  By this time it was growing dark, and most of the gin-palaces were beginning to send forth that glare of intense and warm light with which they so knowingly attract the human moths that constitute their prey.  \"Here we are,\" said Sloper, stopping in front of a public-house in a narrow street.  \"This is one o' the _respectable_ lodgin's.  Most o' the others are disreputable.  It's not much of a neighbourhood, I admit.\"  \"It certainly is not very attractive,\" said Miles, hesitating.  \"You said you wanted a cheap one,\" returned Sloper, \"and you can't expect to have it cheap and fashionable, you know.  You've no occasion to be afraid.  Come in.\"  The arguments of Mr Sloper might have failed to move Miles, but the idea of his being _afraid_ to go anywhere was too much for him.  \"Go in, then,\" he said, firmly, and followed.  The room into which he was ushered was a moderately large public-house, with a bar and a number of tables round the room, at which many men and a few women were seated; some gambling, others singing or disputing, and all drinking and smoking.  It is only right to say that Miles was shocked.  Hitherto he had lived a quiet and"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21720"],["title","Charlie to the Rescue (#1)"],["body","thought!  Barking cur and yelling boys!  It reached the edge of the pool, spread out all its legs with a caterwaul of despair, and went headlong into the water.  Shank Leather gazed--something like glee mingled with his look of consternation.  Not so our hero.  Pity was bursting his bosom.  With one magnificent bound he went into the pool, caught the kitten in his right hand, and carried it straight to the bottom.  Next moment he re-appeared on the surface, wildly beating the water with one hand and holding the kitten aloft in the other.  Shank, to do him justice, plunged into the river up to his waist, but his courage carried him no further.  There he stuck, vainly holding out a hand and shouting for help.  But no help was near, and it seemed as if the pair of strugglers were doomed to perish when a pitiful eddy swept them both out of the deep pool into the foaming rapid below.  Shank followed them in howling despair, for here things looked ten times worse: his comrade being tossed from billow to breaker, was turned heels over head, bumped against boulders, stranded on shallows, overturned and swept away again--but ever with the left arm beating wildly, and the right hand with the kitten, held high in air.  But the danger, except from being dashed against the boulders, was not really as great as it seemed, for every time that Brooke got a foothold for an instant, or was driven on a rock, or was surged, right-end-up, on a shoot of water, he managed to gasp a little air--including a deal of water.  The kitten, of course, had the same chances, and, being passive, perhaps suffered less.  At the foot of the rapid they were whirled, as if contemptuously, into an eddy.  Shank was there, as deep as he dared venture.  He even pushed in up to the arm-pits, and, catching his comrade by the hair, dragged him to bank.  \"O Charlie, I've saved ye!\" he exclaimed, as his friend crawled out and sat down.  \"Ay, an' you've saved the kitten too!\" replied his friend, examining the poor animal.  \"It's dead,\" said Shank; \"dead as mutton.\"  \"No, only stunned.  No wonder, poor beast!\"  With tender care the rescuer squeezed the water from the fur of the rescued.  Then, pulling open his vest and shirt, he was about to place the kitten in his bosom to warm it.  \"No use doin' that,\" said Leather.  \"You're as wet an' nigh as cold as itself.\"  \"That's true.  Sit down here,\" returned Brooke, in a tone of command which surprised his comrade.  \"Open your shirt.\"  Again Shank obeyed wonderingly.  Next moment he gave a gasp as the cold, wet creature was thrust into his warm bosom.  \"It makes me shiver all over,\" he said.  \"Never mind,\" replied his friend coolly, as he got up and wrung the water out of his own garments.  \"It's beginning to move, Charlie,\" said Shank, after a few minutes.  \"Give it here, then.\"  The creature was indeed showing feeble symptoms of revival, so Brooke-- whose bosom was not only recovering its own heat, but was beginning to warm the wet garments--thrust it into his own breast, and the two friends set off homeward at a run.  At the nearest house they made inquiry as to the owner of the kitten, but failed to find one.  Our hero therefore resolved to carry it home. Long before that haven was reached, however, his clothes were nearly dry, and the rescued one was purring sweetly, in childlike innocence-- all the horrors, sufferings, and agonies of the past forgotten, apparently, in the enjoyment of the present.    CHAPTER TWO.  THE SHIPWRECK.  We have no intention of carrying our reader on step by step through all the adventures and deeds of Charlie Brooke.  It is necessary to hasten over his boyhood, leaving untold the many battles fought, risks run, and dangers encountered.  He did not cut much of a figure at the village school--though he did his best, and was fairly successful--but in the playground he reigned supreme.  At football, cricket, gymnastics, and, ultimately, at swimming, no one could come near him.  This was partly owing to his great physical strength, for, as time passed by he shot upwards and outwards in a way that surprised his companions and amazed his mother, who was a distinctly little woman--a neat graceful little woman--with, like her stalwart son, a modest opinion of herself.  As a matter of course, Charlie's school-fellows almost worshipped him, and he was always so willing to help and lead them in all cases of danger or emergency, that \"Charlie to the rescue!\" became quite a familiar cry on the playground.  Indeed it would have been equally appropriate in the school, for the lad never seemed to be so thoroughly happy as when he was assisting some boy less capable than himself to master his lessons.  About the time that Charlie left school, while yet a stripling, he had the shoulders of Samson, the chest of Hercules, and the limbs of Apollo. He was tall also--over six feet--but his unusual breadth deceived people as to this till they stood close to him.  Fair hair, close and curly, with bright blue eyes and a permanent look of grave benignity, completes our description of him.  Rowing, shooting, fishing, boxing, and swimming seemed to come naturally to him, and all of them in a superlative degree.  Swimming was, perhaps, his most loved amusement and in this art he soon far outstripped his friend Leather.  Some men are endowed with exceptional capacities in regard to water.  We have seen men go into the sea warm and come out warmer, even in cold weather.  Experience teaches that the reverse is usually true of mankind in northern regions, yet we once saw a man enter the sea to all appearance a white human being, after remaining in it upwards of an hour, and swimming away from shore; like a vessel outward bound, he came back at last the colour of a boiled lobster!  Such exceptional qualities did Charlie Brooke possess.  A South Sea Islander might have envied but could not have excelled him.  It was these qualities that decided the course of his career just after he left school.  \"Charlie,\" said his mother, as they sat eating their mid-day meal alone one day--the mother being, as we have said, a widow, and Charlie an only child--\"what do you think of doing, now that you have left school? for you know my income renders it impossible that I should send you to college.\"  \"I don't know what to think, mother.  Of course I intend to do something.  If you had only influence with some one in power who could enable a fellow to get his foot on the first round of any sort of ladder, something might be done, for you know I'm not exactly useless, though I can't boast of brilliant talents, but--\"  \"Your talents are brilliant enough, Charlie,\" said his mother, interrupting; \"besides, you have been sent into this world for a purpose, and you may be sure that you will discover what that purpose is, and receive help to carry it out if you only ask God to guide you. Not otherwise,\" she added, after a pause.  \"Do you _really_ believe, mother, that _every_ one who is born into the world is sent for a purpose, and with a specific work to do?\"  \"I do indeed, Charlie.\"  \"What! all the cripples, invalids, imbeciles, even the very infants who are born to wail out their sad lives in a few weeks, or even days?\"  \"Yes--all of them, without exception.  To suppose the opposite, and imagine that a wise, loving, and almighty Being would create anything for _no_ purpose seems to me the very essence of absurdity.  Our only difficulty is that we do not always see the purpose.  All things are ours, but we must ask if we would have them.\"  \"But I _have_ asked, mother,\" said the youth, with an earnest flush on his brow.  \"You know I have done so often, yet a way has not been opened up.  I believe in _your_ faith, mother, but I don't quite believe in my own.  There surely must be something wrong--a screw loose somewhere.\"  He laid down his knife and fork, and looked out at the window with a wistful, perplexed expression.  \"How I wish,\" he continued, \"that the lines had been laid down for the human race more distinctly, so that we could not err!\"  \"And yet,\" responded his mother, with a peculiar look, \"such lines as _are_ obviously laid down we don't always follow.  For instance, it is written, `Ask, and it shall be given you,' and we stop there, but the sentence does not stop: `Seek, and ye shall find' implies care and trouble; `Knock, and it shall be opened unto you' hints at perseverance, does it not?\"  \"There's something in that, mother,\" said Charlie, casting another wistful glance out of the window.  \"Come, I will go out and `seek'!  I see Shank Leather waiting for me.  We agreed to go to the shore together, for we both like to watch the waves roaring in on a breezy day like this.\"  The youth rose and began to encase his bulky frame in a great pilot-cloth coat, each button of which might have done duty as an afternoon tea-saucer.  \"I wish you would choose any companion to walk with but young Leather,\" said the widow, with a sigh.  \"He's far too like his father to do you any good.\"  \"Mother, would you have me give up an old playmate and school-fellow because he is not perfect?\" asked the youth in grave tones as he tied on a sou'-wester.  \"Well, no--not exactly, but--\"  Not having a good reason ready, the worthy woman only smiled a remonstrance.  The stalwart son stooped, kissed her and was soon outside, battling with the storm--for what he styled a breezy day was in reality a wild and stormy one.  Long before the period we have now reached Mrs Brooke had changed her residence to the sea-coast in the small town of Sealford.  Her cottage stood in the centre of the village, about half-a-mile from the shore, and close to that of her bosom friend, Mrs Leather, who had migrated along with her, partly to be near her and partly for the sake of her son Shank, who was anxious to retain the companionship of his friend Brooke. Partly, also, to get her tippling husband away from old comrades and scenes, in the faint hope that she might rescue him "]]]
