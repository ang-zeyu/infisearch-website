They had just left the lee of       the vessel (the moon still shining brightly) when she made a long       and heavy roll to windward, and Henderson, at the same moment,       starting up in his seat bawled out to his crew to back water. He       would say nothing else—repeating his cry impatiently, back water!       back water! The men put back as speedily as possible, but by this       time the ship had gone round, and gotten fully under headway,       although all hands on board were making great exertions to take       in sail. In despite of the danger of the attempt, the mate clung       to the main-chains as soon as they came within his reach. Another       huge lurch now brought the starboard side of the vessel out of       water nearly as far as her keel, when the cause of his anxiety       was rendered obvious enough. The body of a man was seen to be       affixed in the most singular manner to the smooth and shining       bottom (the Penguin was coppered and copper-fastened), and       beating violently against it with every movement of the hull.       After several ineffectual efforts, made during the lurches of the       ship, and at the imminent risk of swamping the boat I was finally       disengaged from my perilous situation and taken on board—for the       body proved to be my own. It appeared that one of the       timber-bolts having started and broken a passage through the       copper, it had arrested my progress as I passed under the ship,       and fastened me in so extraordinary a manner to her bottom. The       head of the bolt had made its way through the collar of the green       baize jacket I had on, and through the back part of my neck,       forcing itself out between two sinews and just below the right       ear. I was immediately put to bed—although life seemed to be       totally extinct. There was no surgeon on board. The captain,       however, treated me with every attention—to make amends, I       presume, in the eyes of his crew, for his atrocious behaviour in       the previous portion of the adventure.        In the meantime, Henderson had again put off from the ship,       although the wind was now blowing almost a hurricane. He had not       been gone many minutes when he fell in with some fragments of our       boat, and shortly afterward one of the men with him asserted that       he could distinguish a cry for help at intervals amid the roaring       of the tempest. This induced the hardy seamen to persevere in       their search for more than half an hour, although repeated       signals to return were made them by Captain Block, and although       every moment on the water in so frail a boat was fraught to them       with the most imminent and deadly peril. Indeed, it is nearly       impossible to conceive how the small jolly they were in could       have escaped destruction for a single instant. She was built,       however, for the whaling service, and was fitted, as I have since       had reason to believe, with air-boxes, in the manner of some       life-boats used on the coast of Wales.        After searching in vain for about the period of time just       mentioned, it was determined to get back to the ship. They had       scarcely made this resolve when a feeble cry arose from a dark       object that floated rapidly by. They pursued and soon overtook       it. It proved to be the entire deck of the Ariel’s cuddy.       Augustus was struggling near it, apparently in the last agonies.       Upon getting hold of him it was found that he was attached by a       rope to the floating timber. This rope, it will be remembered, I       had myself tied around his waist, and made fast to a ringbolt,       for the purpose of keeping him in an upright position, and my so       doing, it appeared, had been ultimately the means of preserving       his life. The Ariel was slightly put together, and in going down       her frame naturally went to pieces; the deck of the cuddy, as       might have been expected, was lifted, by the force of the water       rushing in, entirely from the main timbers, and floated (with       other fragments, no doubt) to the surface—Augustus was buoyed up       with it, and thus escaped a terrible death.        It was more than an hour after being taken on board the Penguin       before he could give any account of himself, or be made to       comprehend the nature of the accident which had befallen our       boat. At length he became thoroughly aroused, and spoke much of       his sensations while in the water. Upon his first attaining any       degree of consciousness, he found himself beneath the surface,       whirling round and round with inconceivable rapidity, and with a       rope wrapped in three or four folds tightly about his neck. In an       instant afterward he felt himself going rapidly upward, when, his       head striking violently against a hard substance, he again       relapsed into insensibility. Upon once more reviving he was in       fuller possession of his reason—this was still, however, in the       greatest degree clouded and confused. He now knew that some       accident had occurred, and that he was in the water, although his       mouth was above the surface, and he could breathe with some       freedom. Possibly, at this period the deck was drifting rapidly       before the wind, and drawing him after it, as he floated upon his       back. Of course, as long as he could have retained this position,       it would have been nearly impossible that he should be drowned.       Presently a surge threw him directly athwart the deck, and this       post he endeavored to maintain, screaming at intervals for help.       Just before he was discovered by Mr. Henderson, he had been       obliged to relax his hold through exhaustion, and, falling into       the sea, had given himself up for lost. During the whole period       of his struggles he had not the faintest recollection of the       Ariel, nor of the matters in connexion with the source of his       disaster. A vague feeling of terror and despair had taken entire       possession of his faculties. When he was finally picked up, every       power of his mind had failed him; and, as before said, it was       nearly an hour after getting on board the Penguin before he       became fully aware of his condition. In regard to myself—I was       resuscitated from a state bordering very nearly upon death (and       after every other means had been tried in vain for three hours       and a half) by vigorous friction with flannels bathed in hot       oil—a proceeding suggested by Augustus. The wound in my neck,       although of an ugly appearance, proved of little real       consequence, and I soon recovered from its effects.        The Penguin got into port about nine o’clock in the morning,       after encountering one of the severest gales ever experienced off       Nantucket. Both Augustus and myself managed to appear at Mr.       Barnard’s in time for breakfast—which, luckily, was somewhat       late, owing to the party over night. I suppose all at the table       were too much fatigued themselves to notice our jaded       appearance—of course, it would not have borne a very rigid       scrutiny. Schoolboys, however, can accomplish wonders in the way       of deception, and I verily believe not one of our friends in       Nantucket had the slightest suspicion that the terrible story       told by some sailors in town of their having run down a vessel at       sea and drowned some thirty or forty poor devils, had reference       either to the Ariel, my companion, or myself. We two have since       very frequently talked the matter over—but never without a       shudder. In one of our conversations Augustus frankly confessed       to me, that in his whole life he had at no time experienced so       excruciating a sense of dismay, as when on board our little boat       he first discovered the extent of his intoxication, and felt       himself sinking beneath its influence.     CHAPTER 2         In no affairs of mere prejudice, pro or con, do we deduce       inferences with entire certainty, even from the most simple data.       It might be supposed that a catastrophe such as I have just       related would have effectually cooled my incipient passion for       the sea. On the contrary, I never experienced a more ardent       longing for the wild adventures incident to the life of a       navigator than within a week after our miraculous deliverance.       This short period proved amply long enough to erase from my       memory the shadows, and bring out in vivid light all the       pleasurably exciting points of color, all the picturesqueness, of       the late perilous accident. My conversations with Augustus grew       daily more frequent and more intensely full of interest. He had a       manner of relating his stories of the ocean (more than one half       of which I now suspect to have been sheer fabrications) well       adapted to have weight with one of my enthusiastic temperament       and somewhat gloomy although glowing imagination. It is strange,       too, that he most strongly enlisted my feelings in behalf of the       life of a seaman, when he depicted his more terrible moments of       suffering and despair. For the bright side of the painting I had       a limited sympathy. My visions were of shipwreck and famine; of       death or captivity among barbarian hordes; of a lifetime dragged       out in sorrow and tears, upon some gray and desolate rock, in an       ocean unapproachable and unknown. Such visions or desires—for       they amounted to desires—are common, I have since been assured,       to the whole numerous race of the melancholy among men—at the       time of which I speak I regarded them only as prophetic glimpses       of a destiny which I felt myself in a measure bound to fulfil.

In a few weeks young Nicholas could do both in a very creditable manner.  Having thus gained the knowledge he desired, dressed in a decent suit of clothes, he went round to various offices in Liverpool offering to fill any vacant situation for which he might be considered fit.  Although he met with numerous rebuffs, he persevered, and was finally taken into the small counting-house of which Mr Peter Crank's father was the head.  To the firm, through all its various changes, he had remained attached, and though frequently offered opportunities of bettering himself, had refused to leave it.  \"No, no; I'll stick to my old friends,\" he always answered; \"their interests are mine, and although I am but a poor clerk, I believe I can forward them.\"  From the first, during all his leisure moments, of which he had not many, he continued to study hard, and to improve himself, spending a portion of his wages in books, which he obtained from Mr Vellum, who allowed him also the run of his library.  He was raised from grade to grade until he became head clerk, and during the illness of Mr Crank and the absence of Mr Trunnion, he so well managed the affairs of the firm, that they felt bound to offer him a partnership in the business, to the success of which he had so greatly contributed.  Notwithstanding his rise in the social circle, Nicholas Swab continued to be the same unostentatious, persevering, painstaking man which he had been from the first--upright in all his dealings, and generous to those who required a helping hand.  Some of the transactions of the firm would not, it must be confessed, stand the test of the present code of morality.  The slave trade had, until lately, been lawful, and the firm had engaged in it with as little hesitation as it would in any other mercantile business.  It had been in the habit of buying negroes in the cheapest market, and disposing of them in the dearest, without for a moment considering how they were obtained.  When the traffic was pronounced illegal, it withdrew its own vessels, but still had no hesitation in supplying the means for fitting out others which it knew were about to proceed to the African coast, although no particular inquiries were made on the subject.  It was not very long before the time of which I speak that the fact dawned on the minds of the partners that the traffic was hateful in the sight of God, as well as in that of a large number of their countrymen, and that it was the main cause of the cruel wars and miseries unspeakable from which the dark-skinned children of Africa had long suffered.  Being really conscientious men, they had agreed to abandon all connection with the traffic, and to employ their vessels in carrying on a lawful trade on the coast.  To do this, however, was not at first so easy as might be supposed.  One of the vessels especially, which they had contributed to fit out and to supply with goods, although not belonging to them, was commanded by Mr Trunnion's brother--a Captain Roderick Trunnion, of whose character I had heard from time to time mysterious hints thrown out not much to his credit.  He occasionally made his appearance at Liverpool.  He seemed to me to be a fine, bold, dashing fellow, ready to do and dare anything he might think fit.  He was like several privateer captains I had met with, who set their own lives and those of their followers at slight value, provided they could carry out their undertakings.  He gave, I believe, his brother, Mr Thomas Trunnion, the partner in our firm, considerable cause for anxiety and annoyance.  The last time he had been on shore, in order to recover his brother's confidence he endeavoured to make himself agreeable to the other partners.  Mr Swab, however, I know, did not trust him, as he privately told Harry Bracewell on one occasion.  \"And don't you,\" he added; \"he is without principles; he always did what he chose regardless of God or man.  And he doesn't believe in God, or that any man has a grain of honesty, nor does he, except when it suits him, boast of having any himself.\"  Captain Trunnion, however, appeared to have insinuated himself into the good graces of our senior partner, at whose house he was a frequent visitor.  He had a strong attraction there; for Lucy, Mr Crank's, only child, was a sweet, amiable, pretty girl, and Captain Trunnion believed that, could he win her, he should not only obtain a charming wife, but become possessed, some day or other, of Mr Crank's property.  Which influenced him most I cannot say.  All I know is, that he did not make any progress in the affections of Miss Lucy, for a very good reason, which he was not long in suspecting--that she had already given her heart to some one else.  That some one was my friend Harry Bracewell Captain Trunnion had, however, gone away without suspecting who was his rival.  My father and mother resided in Chester, so that I was received into the house, as a lodger, of Mrs Bracewell; thus it was that I became more intimate with Harry than I might otherwise have been.  I also had an opportunity of being constantly in the society of the widow's only daughter, Mary--a charming little unaffected girl, full of life and spirits, who treated me as her brother's friend, almost like a brother. For a long time I also thought only of her as a sister, although, somehow or other, I began at last to entertain the hope that, when I had by steady industry obtained the means of making her my wife, she would not feel it necessary to refuse me; and as my family was a respectable one, I had no reason to fear that any objection would be raised by Mrs Bracewell or Harry.  Of my own family I need not speak, except of one member--my brother Charley, who had gone to sea before I entered the office, and was now a midshipman of some years' standing.  He had lately joined the \"Rover\" frigate, employed on the African station.  Charley and I had been fast friends and companions, as brothers should be, when we were together, and when separated we constantly corresponded with each other.  I cannot say that I had any special fondness for mercantile pursuits, or at all events for the work of an office, having to sit for ten or twelve hours of the day on a high stool at a desk, but yet I was thoroughly impressed with the fact that I must gain my own livelihood, and that by working hard alone could I expect to do so.  Had the choice been given me, I should have preferred a life in the open air, with the opportunity of travelling about and seeing the world; but my father did not wish to have more than one son in the navy, and Charley had been devoted as an offering to Neptune.  I was, however, very happy in my situation.  Understanding what I was to do, I took a pleasure in doing it well; and I spent my evenings happily in the society of Mrs Bracewell and her son and daughter.  We had generally music and singing, now and then two or three visitors.  Occasionally we went out to Mr Crank's parties and those of other friends, so that our lives were in no respects dull.  I enter into these details in order that more interest may be taken in the rest of my narrative than might otherwise have been the case.  About an hour after Harry had reported the arrival of the vessel, as I was engaged in Mr Trunnion's private room in taking down letters at his dictation, the mate of the \"Arrow\" was announced.  As Mr Crank was out, Mr Trunnion desired him to come in and give an account of his voyage. As I was not desired to quit the room, I continued transcribing the notes which I had taken down, but I glanced round at the mate as he entered.  His appearance showed that he had suffered from the fever which had carried off so many of his shipmates.  His cheek was pale and hollow, his eye dull, and his figure emaciated; even his voice sounded weak and hollow.  \"Sit down,\" said Mr Trunnion in a kind voice, showing that he was struck by the sickly look of the poor mate.  \"I should like to hear full particulars of your voyage.  It has been a successful one judging by the manifest, which I have been looking over, although fatal to so many long in our employment.  You have managed well, too, in bringing home the `Arrow.'  We are well satisfied--I can tell you that at once.\"  The mate then began an account of the transactions connected with the vessel from the time of her arrival on the Coast of Africa, the number of places visited, and the trade transactions at each.  They were very interesting to me I know at the time, but I did not note them.  Mr Magor then described how one after the other the captain and crew died, until he and three others were alone left.  \"I doubted indeed whether I should have been able to bring the vessel home,\" he continued.  \"We had a narrow escape of being captured by a picarooning craft which swept alongside us during a calm.  A number of the crew, headed by their captain, had actually made their way on board, and having bound me and three of my men, were proceeding to get off the hatches to take the cargo out of the hold, when a man-of-war, bringing up a strong breeze from the south, hove in sight.  The pirates on discovering her hurried on board their own craft, carrying away two of my Kroomen, and casting off the grapplings with which they had made her fast alongside, got out their long sweeps and pulled away for their lives.  As soon as the remaining Kroomen had set me and the other white men free, we ran out our guns and began firing at her.  She returned our shot; and as she had more guns and heavier metal than ours, we judged it prudent not to follow her.  When the breeze came, which it did soon afterwards, she stood away under all sail before the wind.  She showed that she was a fast craft, for she had almost got out of sight before the man-of-war came up with us.  The latter pursued her, but whether she was overtaken or not I cannot say, as we continued our voyage towards England, and I saw no more of either"]]]
