Did ye say that the sodgers ill-used the bairns?\"  \"Na!--ane o' them was inclined to be impident, but the ither, a guid-lookin' young felly, accordin' to Jean, took their pairt an' quarrelled wi' his comrade, sae that they cam to loggerheeds at last, but what was the upshot naebody kens, for the bairns took to their heels an' left them fechtin'.\"  \"An' what if they sud fin' yer hoose an' the bairns unproteckit?\" asked the shepherd.  \"They're no likely to fin' the hoose in a nicht like this, man; an' if they do, they'll fin' naebody but Ramblin' Peter there, for I gied the lassies an' the women strick orders to tak' to the hidy-hole at the first soond o' horses' feet.\"  By this time the men had reached a secluded hollow in the hill, so completely enclosed as to be screened from observation on all sides. They halted here a few moments, for two dark forms were seen in the uncertain light to be moving about just in front of them.  \"It's them,\" whispered Andrew.  \"Whae?\" asked the shepherd.  \"Alexander McCubine an' Edward Gordon.\"  \"Guid an' safe men baith,\" responded Quentin; \"ye better gie them a cry.\"  Andrew did so by imitating the cry of a plover.  It was replied to at once.  \"The stanes are big, ye see,\" explained Andrew, while the two men were approaching.  \"It'll tak' the strength o' the fowr o' us to lift some o' them.\"  \"We've got the cairn aboot finished,\" said McCubine as he came up.  He spoke in a low voice, for although there was no probability of any one being near, they were so accustomed to expect danger because of the innumerable enemies who swarmed about the country, that caution had almost become a second nature.  Without further converse the four men set to work in silence.  They completed a circular heap, or cairn, of stones three or four feet high, and levelled the top thereof to serve as a table or a pulpit at the approaching assembly.  In front of this, and stretching towards a sloping brae, they arranged four rows of very large stones to serve as seats for the communicants, with a few larger stones between them, as if for the support of rude tables of plank.  It took several hours to complete the work.  When it was done Andrew Black surveyed it with complacency, and gave it as his opinion that it was a \"braw kirk, capable o' accommodatin' a congregation o' some thoosands, mair or less.\"  Then the two men, Gordon and McCubine, bidding him and the shepherd good-night, went away into the darkness from which they had emerged.  \"Whar'll they be sleepin' the nicht?\" asked the shepherd, as he and Andrew turned homeward.  \"I' the peat-bog, I doot, for I daurna tak' them hame whan the dragoons is likely to gie us a ca'; besides, the hidy-hole wull be ower fu' soon. Noo, lad,\" he added, as they surmounted a hillock, from which they had a dim view of the surrounding country, \"gang ye doon an' see if ye can fin' oot onything mair aboot thae sodgers.  I'll awa' hame an see that a's right there.\"  They parted, the shepherd turning sharp off to the right, while the farmer descended towards his cottage.  He had not advanced above half the distance when an object a little to the left of his path induced him to stop.  It resembled a round stone, and was too small to have attracted the attention of any eye save one which was familiar with every bush and stone on the ground.  Grasping a stout thorn stick which he carried, Andrew advanced towards the object in question with catlike caution until quite close to it, when he discovered that it was the head of a man who was sleeping soundly under a whin-bush.  A closer inspection showed that the man wore an iron headpiece, a soldier's coat, and huge jack-boots.  \"A dragoon and a spy!\" thought Andrew, while he raised his cudgel, the only weapon he carried, and frowned.  But Andrew was a merciful man; he could not bring himself to strike a sleeping man, even though waking him might entail a doubtful conflict, for he could see that the trooper's hand grasped the hilt of his naked sword.  For a few moments he surveyed the sleeper, as if calculating his chances, then he quietly dropped his plaid, took off his coat, and untying his neckcloth, laid it carefully on one side over a bush.  Having made these preparations, he knelt beside Will Wallace--for it was he--and grasped him firmly by the throat with both hands.  As might have been expected, the young trooper attempted to spring up, and tried to use his weapon; but, finding this to be impossible at such close quarters, he dropped it, and grappled the farmer with all his might; but Andrew, holding on to him like a vice, placed his knee upon his chest and held him firmly down.  \"It's o' nae manner o' use to strive, ye see,\" said Andrew, relaxing his grip a little; \"I've gotten ye, an' if ye like to do my biddin' I'll no be hard on ye.\"  \"If you will let me rise and stand before me in fair fight, I'll do your business if not your bidding,\" returned Wallace in a tone of what may be termed stern sulkiness.  \"Div ye think it's likely I'll staund before you in fair fecht, as you ca'd--you wi' a swurd, and me wi' a bit stick, my lad?  Na, na, ye'll hae to submit, little though ye like it.\"  \"Give me the stick, then, and take you the sword, I shall be content,\" said the indignant trooper, making another violent but unsuccessful effort to free himself.  \"It's a fair offer,\" said Andrew, when he had subdued the poor youth a second time, \"an' reflec's favourably on yer courage, but I'm a man o' peace, an' have no thirst for bloodshed--whilk is more than ye can say, young man; but if ye'll let me tie yer hands thegither, an' gang peaceably hame wi' me, I's promise that nae mischief'll befa' ye.\"  \"No man shall ever tie my hands together as long as there is life in my body,\" replied the youth.  \"Stop, stop, callant!\" exclaimed Andrew, as Will was about to renew the struggle.  \"The pride o' youth is awful.  Hear what I've gotten to say to ye, man, or I'll hae to throttle ye ootright.  It'll come to the same thing if ye'll alloo me to tie ane o' _my_ hands to ane o' yours.  Ye canna objec' to that, surely, for I'll be your prisoner as muckle as you'll be mine--and that'll be fair play, for we'll leave the swurd lyin' on the brae to keep the bit stick company.\"  \"Well, I agree to that,\" said Wallace, in a tone that indicated surprise with a dash of amusement.  \"An' ye promise no' to try to get away when you're tied to--when _I'm_ tied to _you_?\"  \"I promise.\"  Hereupon the farmer, reaching out his hand, picked up the black silk neckcloth which he had laid aside, and with it firmly bound his own left wrist to the right wrist of his captive, talking in a grave, subdued tone as he did so.  \"Nae doot the promise o' a spy is hardly to be lippened to, but if I find that ye're a dishonourable man, ye'll find that I'm an uncomfortable prisoner to be tied to.  Noo, git up, lad, an' we'll gang hame thegither.\"  On rising, the first thing the trooper did was to turn and take a steady look at the man who had captured him in this singular manner.  \"Weel, what d'ye think o' me?\" asked Andrew, with what may be termed a grave smile.  \"If you want to know my true opinion,\" returned Wallace, \"I should say that I would not have thought, from the look of you, that you could have taken mean advantage of a sleeping foe.\"  \"Ay--an' I would not have thought, from the look o' _you_,\" retorted Andrew, \"that ye could hae sell't yersel' to gang skulkin' aboot the hills as a spy upon the puir craters that are only seekin' to worship their Maker in peace.\"  Without further remark Andrew Black, leaving his coat and plaid to keep company with the sword and stick, led his prisoner down the hill.  Andrew's cottage occupied a slight hollow on the hillside, which concealed it from every point of the compass save the high ground above it.  Leading the trooper up to the door, he tapped gently, and was promptly admitted by some one whom Wallace could not discern, as the interior was dark.  \"Oh, Uncle Andrew!  I'm glad ye've come, for Peter hasna come back yet, an' I'm feared somethin' has come ower him.\"  \"Strike a light, lassie.  I've gotten haud o' a spy here, an' canna weel do't mysel'.\"  When a light was procured and held up, it revealed the pretty face of Jean Black, which underwent a wondrous change when she beheld the face of the prisoner.  \"Uncle Andrew!\" she exclaimed, \"this is nae spy.  He's the man that cam' to the help o' Aggie an' me against the dragoon.\"  \"Is that sae?\" said Black, turning a look of surprise on his prisoner.  \"It is true, indeed, that I had the good fortune to protect Jean and her friend from an insolent comrade,\" answered Wallace; \"and it is also true that that act has been partly the cause of my deserting to the hills, being starved for a day and a night, and taken prisoner now as a spy.\"  \"Sir,\" said Andrew, hastily untying the kerchief that bound them together, \"I humbly ask your pardon.  Moreover, it's my opeenion that if ye hadna been starvin' ye wadna have been here 'e noo, for ye're uncommon teuch.  Rin, lassie, an' fetch some breed an' cheese.  Whar's Marion an' Is'b'l?\"  \"They went out to seek for Peter,\" said Jean, as she hastened to obey her uncle's mandate.  At that moment a loud knocking was heard at the door, and the voice of Marion, one of the maid-servants, was heard outside.  On the door being opened, she and her companion Isabel burst in with excited looks and the information, pantingly given, that the \"sodgers were comin'.\"  \"Haud yer noise, lassie, an' licht the fire--pit on the parritch pat. Come, Peter, let's hear a' aboot it.\"  Ramblin' Peter, who had been thus named because of his inveterate tendency to range over the neighbouring hills, was a quiet, undersized, said-to-be weak-minded boy of sixteen years, though he looked little more than fourteen.

CHAPTER TWO.  SPORT BEGINS IN EARNEST.  Time, which is ever on the wing, working mighty changes in the affairs of man, soon transported our hero from Mrs Pry's dingy little back parlour in London to the luxuriant wilds of Africa.  There, on the evening of a splendid day, he sat down to rest under the grateful shade of an umbrageous tree, in company with Major Garret and Lieutenant Wilkins, both of whom had turned out to be men after Tom Brown's own heart.  They were both bronzed strapping warriors, and had entered those regions not only with a view to hunting lions, but also for the purpose of making collections of the plants and insects of the country, the major being a persevering entomologist, while the lieutenant was enthusiastically botanical.  To the delight of these gentlemen they found that Tom, although not deeply learned on these subjects, was nevertheless extremely intelligent and appreciative.  The major was very tall, thin; strong, wiry, and black-bearded.  The lieutenant was very short, thickset, deep-chested, and powerful.  Tom himself was burly, ruddy, broad, and rather above middle size.  \"Now this is what I call real felicity,\" observed the major, pulling out a pipe which he proceeded to fill.  Tom Brown followed his example, and Bob Wilkins, who was not a smoker, and had a somewhat facetious disposition, amused himself by quizzing his comrades and carving a piece of wood with his penknife.  \"Does the real felicity, major, result from the tobacco or the surrounding circumstances?\" asked Wilkins.  \"From both, Bob,\" replied the other with a smile, \"and you need not spoil my felicity by repeating your well-known set of phrases about the evils of smoking, for I know them all by heart, and I dare say so does Tom.\"  \"Impossible,\" said Wilkins; \"I have not yet been two weeks in his company; he cannot, therefore, have heard a tithe of the irresistible arguments which I bring to bear on that pernicious practice, and which I hope some day to throw into shape and give to the public in the form of a bulky volume.\"  \"Which will end in smoke,\" interrupted the major.  \"In a literal sense, too,\" added Tom Brown, \"for it will be sold as waste-paper and be made up into matches.\"  \"We shall see,\" retorted Wilkins, cutting carefully round the right nostril of a baboon's head which he had carved on the end of a walking-stick; \"meanwhile, major, as you are better acquainted than we are with this outlandish country, and have taken on yourself the leadership of the party, will you condescend to give Tom Brown and me some idea of your intended movements--that is, if smoke and felicity will permit you to do so?\"  \"With pleasure, my dear fellow,\" said the major puffing vigorously for a few moments to get his pipe well alight.  \"It was my intention to make for Big Buffalo's Village, or kraal as they call it here, and, getting the assistance of some of his sable Majesty's subjects, hunt the country in his neighbourhood, but I heard from Hicks this morning, before we left the camp, that a band of traders, at a kraal not far from us, are about to start for the Zulu country, and it struck me that we might as well join forces and advance together, for I prefer a large party to a small one--there is generally more fun to be got out of it.\"  \"Would it be well to tie ourselves to any one?\" asked Tom Brown.  \"I have always found that a small party is more manageable than a large one however, I do but throw out the suggestion in all humility.\"  \"He shall not necessarily be tied to them,\" replied the major, re-lighting his pipe, which had a bad habit of going out when he talked; \"we may keep company as long as we find it agreeable to do so, and part when we please.  But what say you to the change of plan?  I think it will bring us into a better hunting country.\"  \"Whatever you think best, major, will please me,\" said Tom, \"for I'm ignorant of everything here and place myself entirely under your directions.\"  \"And I am agreeable,\" added Bob Wilkins.  \"You are neither agreeable nor grammatical,\" said the major.  \"Well, if you insist on it, I'm agreed.  But do put your pipe out, Tom, and let us resume our march, for we have a long way to go, and much work to do before reaching the camp to-night.\"  Thus admonished, Tom Brown made an extinguisher of the end of his forefinger, put his short clay pipe in his waistcoat pocket, and, shouldering his rifle, followed his companions into the forest, on the edge of which they had been resting.  The country through which they passed was extremely beautiful, particularly in the eyes of our hero, for whom the magnificence of tropical vegetation never lost its charms.  The three sportsmen had that morning left their baggage, in a wagon drawn by oxen, in charge of Hicks the trader, who had agreed to allow them to accompany him on a trading expedition, and to serve them in the capacity of guide and general servant.  They had made a detour through the forest with a party of six natives, under the guidance of a Caffre servant named Mafuta, and were well repaid for the time thus spent, by the immense variety of insects and plants which the naturalists found everywhere.  But that which delighted them most was the animal life with which the whole region teemed.  They saw immense herds of wolves, deer of various kinds, hyenas, elands, buffalo, and many other wild beasts, besides innumerable flocks of water-fowl of all kinds.  But they passed these unmolested, having set their hearts that day on securing higher game.  As Wilkins said, \"nothing short of a lion, an elephant, a rhinoceros, or hippopotamus\" would satisfy them and that they had some chance of securing one or more of these formidable brutes was clear, because their voices had been several times heard, and their footprints had been seen everywhere.  About an hour after resuming their walk, the major went off in hot pursuit of an enormous bee, which he saw humming round a bush.  About the same time, Wilkins fell behind to examine one of the numerous plants that were constantly distracting his attention, so that our hero was left for a time to hunt alone with the natives.  He was walking a considerable distance in advance of them when he came to a dense thicket which was black as midnight, and so still that the falling of a leaf might have been heard.  Tom Brown surveyed the thicket quietly for a few seconds, and observing the marks of some large animal on the ground, he beckoned to the Caffre who carried his spare double-barrelled gun.  Up to this date our hero had not shot any of the large denizens of the African wilderness, and now that he was suddenly called upon to face what he believed to be one of them, he acquitted himself in a way that might have been expected of a member of the Brown family!  He put off his shoes, cocked his piece, and entered the thicket alone--the natives declining to enter along with him.  Coolly and very quietly he advanced into the gloomy twilight of the thicket, and as he went he felt as though all the vivid dreams and fervid imaginings about lions that had ever passed through his mind from earliest infancy were rushing upon him in a concentrated essence!  Yet there was no outward indication of the burning thoughts within, save in the sparkle of his dark brown eye, and the flush of his brown cheek.  As he wore a brown shooting-coat, he may be said to have been at that time Brown all over!  He had proceeded about fifty yards or so when, just as he turned a winding in the path, he found himself face to face with an old buffalo-bull, fast asleep, and lying down not ten yards off.  To drop on one knee and level his piece was the work of an instant, but unfortunately he snapped a dry twig in doing so.  The eyes of the huge brute opened instantly, and he had half risen before the loud report of the gun rang through the thicket.  Leaping up, Tom Brown took advantage of the smoke to run back a few yards and spring behind a bush, where he waited to observe the result of his shot.  It was more tremendous then he had expected.  A crash on his right told him that another, and unsuspected, denizen of the thicket had been scared from his lair, while the one he had fired at was on his legs snuffing the air for his enemy. Evidently the wind had been favourable, for immediately he made a dead-set and charged right through the bush behind which our hero was"]]]
