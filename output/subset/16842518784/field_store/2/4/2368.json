The next chapter will carry you, good reader, into the midst of a pitched battle.    CHAPTER TWO.  DESCRIBES A TREMENDOUS BATTLE AND A GLORIOUS VICTORY.  Before following our brilliant lifeboat--this gaudy, butterfly-like thing of red, white, and blue--to the field of battle, let me observe that the boats of the Royal National Lifeboat Institution have several characteristic qualities, to which reference shall be made hereafter, and that they are of various sizes.  [A full and graphic account of the Royal National Lifeboat Institution--its boats, its work, and its achievements--may be found in an interesting volume by its late secretary, Richard Lewis, Esquire, entitled _History of the Lifeboat and its Work_--published by Macmillan and Company.]  One of the largest size is that of Ramsgate.  This may be styled a privileged boat, for it has a steam-tug to wait upon it named the Aid. Day and night the Aid has her fires \"banked up\" to keep her boilers simmering, so that when the emergency arises, a vigorous thrust of her giant poker brings them quickly to the boiling point, and she is ready to take her lifeboat in tow and tug her out to the famed and fatal Goodwin Sands, which lie about four miles off the coast--opposite to Ramsgate.  I draw attention to this boat, first because she is exceptionally situated with regard to frequency of call, the means of going promptly into action, and success in her work.  Her sister-lifeboats of Broadstairs and Margate may, indeed, be as often called to act, but they lack the attendant steamer, and sometimes, despite the skill and courage of their crews, find it impossible to get out in the teeth of a tempest with only sail and oar to aid them.  Early in December, 1863, an emigrant ship set sail for the Antipodes; she was the Fusilier, of London.  It was her last voyage, and fated to be very short.  The shores of Old England were still in sight, the eyes of those who sought to \"better their circumstances\" in Australia were yet wet, and their hearts still full with the grief of parting from loved ones at home, when one of the most furious storms of the season caught them and cast their gallant ship upon the dangerous Sands off the mouth of the Thames.  This happened on the night of the 3rd, which was intensely dark, as well as bitterly cold.  Who can describe or conceive the scene that ensued! the horror, the shrieking of women and children, and the yelling of the blast through the rigging,--for it was an absolute hurricane,--while tons of water fell over the decks continually, sweeping them from stem to stern.  The Fusilier had struck on that part of the sands named the Girdler.  In the midst of the turmoil there was but one course open to the crew-- namely, to send forth signals of distress.  Guns were fired, rockets sent up, and tar-barrels set a-blaze.  Then, during many hours of agony, they had to wait and pray.  On that same night another good ship struck upon the same sands at a different point--the Demerara of Greenock--not an emigrant ship, but freighted with a crew of nineteen souls, including a Trinity pilot. Tossed like a plaything on the Sands--at that part named the Shingles-- off Margate, the Demerara soon began to break up, and the helpless crew did as those of the Fusilier had done and were still doing--they signalled for aid.  But it seemed a forlorn resource.  Through the thick, driving, murky atmosphere nothing but utter blackness could be seen, though the blazing of their own tar-barrels revealed, with awful power, the seething breakers around, which, as if maddened by the obstruction of the sands, leaped and hissed wildly over them, and finally crushed their vessel over on its beam-ends.  Swept from the deck, which was no longer a platform, but, as it were, a sloping wall, the crew took refuge in the rigging of one of the masts which still held fast.  The mast overhung the caldron of foam, which seemed to boil and leap at the crew as if in disappointed fury.  By degrees the hull of the Demerara began to break up.  Her timbers writhed and snapped under the force of the ever-thundering waves as if tormented.  The deck was blown out by the confined and compressed air. The copper began to peel off, the planks to loosen, and soon it became evident that the mast to which the crew were lashed could not long hold up.  Thus, for ten apparently endless hours the perishing seamen hung suspended over what seemed to be their grave.  They hung thus in the midst of pitchy darkness after their blazing tar-barrels had been extinguished.  And what of the lifeboat-men during all this time?  Were they asleep? Nay, verily!  Everywhere they stood at pierheads, almost torn from their holdfasts by the furious gale, or they cowered under the lee of boats and boat-houses on the beach, trying to gaze seaward through the blinding storm, but nothing whatever could they see of the disasters on these outlying sands.  There are, however, several sentinels which mount guard night and day close to the Goodwin and other Sands.  These are the Floating Lights which mark the position of our extensive and dangerous shoals.  Two of these sentinels, the Tongue lightship and the Prince's lightship, in the vicinity of the Girdler Sands, saw the signals of distress.  Instantly their guns and rockets gleamed and thundered intelligence to the shore. Such signals had been watched for keenly that night by the brave men of the Margate lifeboat, who instantly went off to the rescue.  But there are conditions against which human courage and power and will are equally unavailing.  In the teeth of such a gale from the west-nor'-west, with the sea driving in thunder straight on the beach, it was impossible for the Margate boat to put out.  A telegram was therefore despatched to Ramsgate.  Here, too, as at Broadstairs, and everywhere else, the heroes of the coast were on the lookout, knowing well the duties that might be required of them at any moment.  The stout little Aid was lying at the pier with her steam \"up.\"  The Ramsgate lifeboat was floating quietly in the harbour, and her sturdy lion-like coxswain, Isaac Jarman, was at the pier-head with some of his men, watching.  The Ramsgate men had already been out on service at the sands that day, and their appetite for saving life had been whetted. They were ready for more work.  At a quarter past eight p.m. the telegram was received by the harbour-master.  The signal was given.  The lifeboat-men rushed to their boats.  \"First come, first served,\" is the rule there.  She was over-manned, and some of the brave fellows had to leave her.  The tight little tug took the boat in tow, and in less than half an hour rushed out with her into the intense darkness, right in the teeth of tempest and billows.  The engines of the Aid are powerful, like her whole frame.  Though fiercely opposed she battled out into the raging sea, now tossed on the tops of the mighty waves, now swallowed in the troughs between. Battered by the breaking crests, whelmed at times by \"green seas,\" staggering like a drunken thing, and buffeted by the fierce gale, but never giving way an inch, onward, steadily if slowly, until she rounded the North Foreland.  Then the rescuers saw the signals going up steadily, regularly, from the two lightships.  No cessation of these signals until they should be answered by signals from the shore.  All this time the lifeboat had been rushing, surging, and bounding in the wake of her steamer.  The seas not only roared around her, but absolutely overwhelmed her.  She was dragged violently over them, and sometimes right through them.  Her crew crouched almost flat on the thwarts, and held on to prevent being washed overboard.  The stout cable had to be let out to its full extent to prevent snapping, so that the mist and rain sometimes prevented her crew from seeing the steamer, while cross seas met and hurled her from side to side, causing her to plunge and kick like a wild horse.  About midnight the Tongue lightship was reached and hailed.  The answer given was brief and to the point: \"A vessel in distress to the nor'-west, supposed to be on the high part of the Shingles Sand!\"  Away went the tug and boat to the nor'-west, but no vessel could be found, though anxious hearts and sharp and practised eyes were strained to the uttermost.  The captain of the Aid, who knew every foot of the sands, and who had medals and letters from kings and emperors in acknowledgment of his valuable services, was not to be balked easily. He crept along as close to the dangerous sands as was consistent with the safety of his vessel.  How intently they gazed and listened both from lifeboat and steamer, but no cry was to be heard, no signal of distress, nothing but the roaring of the waves and shrieking of the blast, and yet they were not far from the perishing!  The crew of the Demerara were clinging to their quivering mast close by, but what could their weak voices avail in such a storm?  Their signal fires had long before been drowned out, and those who would have saved them could not see more than a few yards around.  Presently the booming of distant cannon was heard and then a faint line of fire was seen in the far distance against the black sky.  The Prince's and the Girdler lightships were both firing guns and rockets to tell that shipwreck was taking place near to them.  What was to be done? Were the Shingles to be forsaken, when possibly human beings were perishing there?  There was no help for it.  The steamer and lifeboat made for the vessels that were signalling, and as the exhausted crew on the quivering mast of the Demerara saw their lights depart, the last hope died out of their breasts.  \"Hope thou in God, for thou shalt yet praise Him,\" perchance occurred to some of them: who knows?  Meanwhile the rescuers made for the Prince's lightship and were told that a vessel in "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21718"],["title","The Big Otter (#1)"],["body","pines, this hole in the snow suggested a tomb rather than a bed.  At one end of it we piled up the firewood.  Extending from that towards the other end, we spread a carpet of pine-branches, full six inches thick.  To do all this took a considerable amount of time and labour, and when Lumley stood up at last to strike a light with flint, steel, and tinder, we felt pretty well exhausted.  The night had by that time become profoundly dark, insomuch that we had to grope for the various articles we required.  \"We've been rather late of beginning to make the camp,\" said I, as I watched the sparks.  \"Never mind, Max, my boy, we shall soon be all right,\" replied my friend, as one of the sparks at last caught on the tinder.  In a few seconds the spark was blown into a blaze, and placed in the midst of a handful of dry moss and thin chips.  This was applied to some dry twigs under our piled-up logs, and a vivid tongue of flame shot upward.  Blessed fire!  Marvellous light!  It is a glorious, wonder-working influence, well chosen by the Almighty as one of his titles.  There is no change in Nature so intense as that from darkness to light as well in physical as in spiritual things.  No sudden change from heat to cold, or from calm to storm; no transformation ever achieved in the most gorgeous of pantomimes, could have the startling effect, or produce the splendid contrast that resulted from the upward flash of that first tongue of fire.  It was a vivid tongue, for the materials had been well laid; a few seconds later it was a roaring tongue, with a host of lesser tongues around it--all dancing, leaping, cheering, flashing, as if with ineffable joy at their sudden liberation, and the resulting destruction of dismal darkness.  Our snow-abyss was no longer black and tomb-like.  Its walls sparkled as though encrusted with diamonds; its carpet of pine-branches shone vividly green; the tree-stems around rose up like red-hot pillars, more or less intense in colour, according to distance; the branching canopy overhead appeared to become solid with light, and the distance around equally solid with ebony blackness, while we, who had caused the transformation, stood in the midst of the ruddy blaze like jovial red-hot men!  \"There's nothing like a fire,\" I remarked with some enthusiasm.  \"Except supper,\" said Lumley.  \"Gross creature!\"  I responded, as he went about the preparation of supper with a degree of zest which caused me to feel that my epithet was well deserved.  \"Gross creature!\" he repeated some time afterwards with a pleasant smile of intense enjoyment, as he sat in front of the blaze sipping a can of hot tea, and devouring pemmican and biscuit with avidity.  \"No, Max, I am not a gross creature.  Your intellects are probably benumbed by the cold.  If phrenologists are right in dividing the human brain into compartments, wherein the different intellectual powers are said to be located, I should think that some of those chambers lying nearest to the top of the skull are apt to freeze at a temperature of forty below zero, in which case the perfect working of the half-paralysed machine can scarcely be looked for.  Hold your head to the fire, and thaw it while I expound this to you.\"  \"Stay,\" said I, holding out my tin pannikin for more tea; \"inward heat as well as outward is necessary to my thorough comprehension of _your_ expositions.\"  \"True, Max, all the faculties of such mind as you possess, in their most active condition, are required to enable you to take in the simplest proposition.  Just give my bird a turn, like a good fellow.\"  He referred to a ptarmigan which, plucked, split open, roughly cleaned, and impaled on a stick, was roasting in front of the fire.  I turned his bird and my own, while he continued:--  \"To gratify the appetite with thorough and hearty appreciation after working hard for your food, or walking far to find it, is not gross. Grossness consists in eating heavily when you have not toiled, and stimulating with fire-water, pepper, or mustard, your sluggish appetite. To call me a gross creature, then--\"  He stopped short, and, looking up, performed that operation with the nose which is styled sniffing.  \"What do I smell?\"  \"My bird--burnt!\"  I shouted, snatching at the stick on which it was impaled.  In doing so I capsized our can of tea.  Lumley looked at it with a sigh, while I regarded with a groan the breast of my bird burnt to a cinder.  \"Max, you should remember that a fire strong enough to subdue forty degrees below zero is intense--also, that our supply of tea is limited. All this comes of your unwisely calling me a gross creature.\"  \"No, it comes of the intense application of my unthawed intellect to your absurd expositions.\"  \"Whatever it comes of,\" returned Lumley, \"we must remedy the evil. Here, fall upon my ptarmigan.  I'm not quite ready for it, being still engaged with the pemmican.  Meanwhile, I'll replenish the kettle.\"  So saying, he took up the kettle, went to the margin of our hole, and filled it with fresh snow well pressed down.  This being put on the fire, soon melted; more snow was added, till water enough was procured, and then fresh tea was put in to boil.  We were not particular, you see, as to the mode of infusion.  While my friend was thus engaged, I had plucked, split, cleansed and impaled another bird.  In a marvellously short time--for our fire was truly intense--the tea and ptarmigan were ready, and we proceeded with supper as comfortably as before.  \"Now I shall continue,\" said Lumley, with a satisfied clearing of the throat, \"the exposition of grossness,--\"  \"Oh, pray spare me that,\" said I, quickly, \"but tell me, if you can, why it is that such a tremendous fire as that does not melt our snow walls.\"  \"Put your head nearer to it, Max, for some of the phrenological chambers must still be frozen, else it would be clear to you that the intensity of the cold is the reason.  You see that only a small part of the snow quite close to the fire is a little softened.  If the fire were hotter it would melt more of it--melt the whole hole and us too.  But the cold is so great that it keeps the walls cool and us also--too cool indeed, for while my face and knees are roasting my back is freezing, so I shall rise and give _it_ a turn.  Now,\" he continued, rising and turning his back to the blaze as he spoke, \"I will resume my remarks on gross--\"  \"You've no objection to my making our bed while you lecture?\" said I, also rising.  Lumley had not the least objection, so, while he held forth, I spread a large green blanket over our carpet of pine-brush.  A bundle of the same under the blanket formed a pretty good pillow.  Wrapping myself tightly round in another blanket (for physical heat evaporates quickly in the frozen regions) I lay down.  My friend lay down beside me, our feet being towards the fire.  After a silent interval, while lying thus, gazing up through the overhanging branches at the stars that twinkled in the clear frosty sky, our thoughts became more serious.  The grandeur of creation led us to think and speak of the Creator--for we were like-minded friends, and no subject was tabooed.  We conversed freely about whatever chanced to enter our minds--of things past, present, and to come.  We spoke of God the Saviour, of redemption and of sin.  Then, with that discursive tendency to which most minds are prone, we diverged to home and civilised lands, contrasting these with life in the wild-woods of the Great Nor'-west.  After that we became sleepy, and our converse was more discursive--at times even incoherent--in the midst of which Lumley reverted to his unfinished exposition of grossness, and, in the enthusiasm of his nature, was slowly working himself back into a wakeful condition, when I put an abrupt end to the discourse by drawing a prolonged snore.  It was a deceptive snore, unworthy of success, yet it succeeded.  My friend turned round and, with a contented sigh, went to sleep.  After a brief space the snore which had been a fiction became a reality, and thus, on our bed of snow, in the depths of an Arctic night, in the heart of the frozen wilderness, and while the mighty fire burned slowly down, we unitedly took our departure for the land of Nod.    CHAPTER TWO.  THE WINTER PACKET.  On returning next morning towards the outpost from our encampment in the woods, Lumley and I made a discovery which excited us greatly.  It was nothing more than a track in the snow, but there was a revelation in the track which sent the blood tingling through our veins.  It was not the track of a Polar bear.  We should have been somewhat surprised, no doubt, but not greatly excited by that.  Neither was it the track of a deer or an Arctic fox.  It was only the track of a sledge!  \"Is that all?\" exclaims the reader.  No, that is not all.  But, in order that you may understand it better, let me explain.  Fort Dunregan, in which we dwelt, stood more than a thousand miles distant from the utmost verge of civilised life in Canada.  We were buried, so to speak, in the heart of the great northern wilderness.  Our nearest neighbour lived in an outpost between one and two hundred miles distant, similar to our own in all respects but even more lonely, being in charge of a certain Scotsman named Macnab, whose army of occupation consisted of only six men and two Indian women!  The forests around us were not peopled.  Those vast solitudes were indeed here and there broken in upon, as it were, by a few families of wandering Red-Indians, who dwelt in movable tents--were here to-day and away to-morrow--but they could not be said to be peopled, except by deer and bears and foxes and kindred spirits.  Of course, therefore, we were far beyond the every day influences of civilised life.  We had no newspapers, no mails; no communication whatever, in short, with the outer world except twice in the year.  The one occasion was in summer, when a brigade of boats arrived with our outfit of goods for the"]]]
