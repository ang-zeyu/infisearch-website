I disown England; I disowned her when I came out here to throw meself into the arrums of the brave, suffering, pathriotic race around me, and placed my sword at their service.\"  \"Then you are a soldier, I presume?\" said my father.  \"I was tin years in the arrmy, sor,\" said our visitor, drawing himself up and clapping his hand upon his chest.  \"Look at thim,\" he continued, pointing to his followers drawn up in line.  \"A part of my following, and as fine irrigular cavalry as ever threw leg over saddle.--Look here, young man, ye're in luck, for ye'll have the honour of serving in Captain Eustace Moriarty's troop.\"  \"You are Captain Eustace Moriarty?\" said my father.  \"I am, sor.\"  \"Then I must tell you, sir,\" said my father, \"that though I have taken up land here and made it my home, I claim my rights as an Englishman not to make myself a traitor by taking up arms against my Queen.\"  \"A thraitor!\" cried the captain.  \"Bah!  That for the Queen;\" and he snapped his fingers.  \"But ye're not asked to serve now.  That can wait till ye're wanted.  It's the bhoy we want, and maybe after a bit it'll be you.\"  \"My son thinks as I do,\" said my father sternly.  \"Does he, now?\" said the captain mockingly.  \"Then I shall have to tache him to think as I do, and it won't take long.  D'ye hear me, bhoy?\"  \"I hear what you say, sir,\" I replied.  \"Of course I think as my father does, and I refuse to serve against England.\"  \"I expected it,\" said the man, with cool insolence.  \"It's what I expected from a young Saxon.  But look here, me bhoy; ye've got to serrve whether ye like it or whether ye don't.  What's more, ye've got to come at once.  So get yer horse, and clap the saddle on.  Fetch him his rifle and his cartridge-bolt, and let there be no more nonsense.\"  \"You heard what my son said, sir,\" said my father haughtily.  \"If it were against a black enemy of the country we should both be willing.\"  \"Didn't I tell ye it was again' a black inimy?\" said the man mockingly.  \"I heard you insult the Queen and her Government, sir,\" said my father; \"and, once more, my son refuses to serve.\"  \"The coward!--the white-livered cub!\" cried the captain contemptuously.  \"What!\"  I cried, springing forward; but my father flung his hand across my chest, and Bob rushed in past Aunt Jenny, as if to take refuge from the scene.  \"Quite right, old man,\" said the captain, coolly stroking his beard. \"And look here, bhoy whether ye like it or not, ye're a sojer now; I'm yer shuperior officer, and it's time of war.  If a man strikes his shuperior officer, he's stood up with a handkerchief tied across his eyes to prevent him from winking and spoiling the men's aim, and then the firing-party does the rest.\"  As he spoke he made a sign, and half-a-dozen of the mounted Boers rode up.  \"Sargint,\" he said, \"the young colt's a bit fractious.  Ye'll take him in hand.  Fasten his hands behind him ready.  Two of ye go round to the pen there and pick out the most likely horse, saddle and bridle him, and bring him here.  Ye've got some green-leather thongs.  Then put him upon the horse with his face to the tail, and tie his ankles underneath. It'll be a fine lesson for the bhoy in rough-riding.\"  The men were quick enough.  Before I had even thought of trying to make my escape, two of the Boers were off their horses and made me their prisoner, while the rest of the little troop rode closer up and surrounded us.  Then other two of the men rode off behind the house, and I stood breathing hard, biting my lips, and feeling as if something hot was burning my chest as I tried hard to catch my father's averted eyes.  Just then the Irish renegade captain burst into a hearty laugh, and I wrenched myself round to look, and felt better.  A minute before, I had seen Bob disappear into the house, and had mentally denounced him as a miserable little coward; but my eyes flashed now as I saw him hurry out with three rifles over his right shoulder, a bandolier belt across his left, and two more, well filled with cartridges, hanging to the barrels of the rifles.  \"Bedad!\" said the captain, \"and he's worth fifty of his big, hulking brother!  But ye're too shmall, darlint.  Wait a year or two longer, and ye shall fight under me like a man.\"  Bob made a rush for father; but one of the Boers leaned down and caught him by the shoulder, while another snatched the rifles from his hands, and laid them across the pommel of the saddle in which he sat.  \"Give up, Bob; give up,\" cried father sternly, as my brother began to struggle with all his might.  \"It is no use to fight against fate.\"  \"Hear him now,\" said the captain.  \"He can talk sinse at times.\"  \"Yes,\" said my father, \"at times;\" and he gave the captain a look which made him turn away his eyes.--\"Val, my boy, I cannot have you exposed to the ignominy of being bound.\"  \"Sure, no,\" cried the captain.  \"I forgot to say a wurrud about stirrup-leathers across his back if he didn't behave himself.\"  \"Fate is against us for the present, my boy,\" continued my father, \"and you must ride with this party till I have applied to the proper quarters to get the matter righted.\"  \"Now, man, be aloive,\" said the captain, and I winced and looked vainly round for a way of escape; but I was seized by the wrist by another dismounted Boer, who slipped a raw-hide noose over my wrist, just as two more came riding back, leading my own horse, Sandho, between them.  The poor beast, who followed me like a dog, uttered a shrill neigh as soon as he caught sight of me, springing forward to reach my side.  \"Stop!\" cried my father loudly; \"there is no need for that.  My son will ride with you, sir.\"  \"Indade, sir, I'm obleeged to ye for the inforrmation,\" said the captain mockingly; \"but sure it's a work of shupererrogation, me dear friend, for I knew it, and that he was going to ride backward.  If, however, he gives up sinsibly, he may ride with his back to the horse's tail, and ye needn't tie his ankles togither.  Have ye ever ridden that horse before?\"  \"He has ridden it hundreds of times, ever since it was a foal,\" said my father quickly, for I felt choked.--\"Stop, man,\" he added angrily; \"your captain said my son was not to be bound.\"  \"Sure I didn't say a wurrud about his wrists, old man,\" cried the captain contemptuously.  \"Ye want too much.  I've let him off about the ankles, and let him ride face forward, so be contint.  Make his wrists fast behind him.\"  I was compelled to resign myself to my fate, and stood fighting hard to keep down all emotion while my wrists were secured firmly behind my back, the thin raw-hide cutting painfully into the flesh.  By this time Sandho was bridled and saddled, and just then my father turned to Bob.  \"Take in those rifles, my boy,\" he said.  The captain turned sharply and gave my father a searching look; but he contented himself with nodding, and my brother snatched the rifles from where they lay across the Boer's knees, and rushed indoors with them.  I knew well enough why, poor fellow: it was to hide the tears struggling to rise, and of which he was ashamed.  Just then I had harder work than ever to control my own feelings, for Aunt Jenny hurried towards me, but was kept back by my captors; and I saw her go to my father and throw her arms about his neck, while he bent over her and seemed to be trying to whisper comfort.  \"There, up with ye, me bhoy,\" cried the captain.  \"Ye can't mount, though, with yer hands behind yer like a prishner.--Lift him on, two of ye, like a sack.\"  \"That they shan't,\" I said between my teeth; and feeling now that what was to como was inevitable, I took a couple of steps to my horse's side.  \"Stand!\"  I said aloud as I raised one foot to the stirrup; and Sandho stood as rigid as if of bronze, while I made a spring, raised myself up, and threw my leg over.  \"Well done, bhoy!\" cried the captain as I sank into the saddle.--\"You, Hooger, take his rein.  Unfasten one end from the bit so as to give ye double length, and ye'd better buckle it to your saddle-bow.--Now look here, me fine fellow,\" he continued, addressing me, \"ye'll give me none of your nawnsense; for, look ye, my bhoys are all practised shots with the rifle.  They can bring down a spring-bok going at full speed, so they can easily bring ye down and yer nag too.  There's twenty of them, and I'm a good shot meself, so ye know what to expect if ye thry to escape.\"  I said nothing, for I was thinking with agony about poor Aunt Jenny, who was now coming up to me, and the captain laughed as he saw her pain-wrung countenance.  \"Good-bye, Val, my boy,\" said my father slowly; \"and bear up like a man.\"  That was all, and he"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21312"],["title","Glyn Severn's Schooldays (#1)"],["body","his hands in a very objectionable way, he gave them a rub together, doubled his fists, and threw himself into a fighting attitude, jerking his head to and fro in the most approved manner; and, bringing forth a roar of delight from the little crowd around him, as quick as lightning he delivered two sharp blows right and left to a couple of unoffending schoolfellows, picking out, though, two who were not likely to retaliate.  \"That'll be it, boys, the pair together--one down and t'other come on. Both together if they like.  They want putting in their places.  I mean to strike against it.\"  \"Hit hard then, Sleggy,\" cried one of his parasites.  \"I will,\" was the reply.  \"There you have it;\" and to the last speaker's disgust he received a sharp blow in the chest which sent him staggering back.  \"Now, don't you call me Sleggy again, young man.  Next time it will be one in the mouth.--Yes, boys,\" he continued, drawing himself up, \"I do mean to hit hard, and let the Principal and the masters see that we are not going to have favouritism here.  Indian prince, indeed!  Yah! who's he?  Why, I could sell him for a ten-pun note, stock and lock and bag and baggage, to Madame Tussaud's.  That's about all he's fit for. Dressed up to imitate an English gentleman!  Look at him!  His clothes don't fit, even if they are made by a proper tailor.\"  \"It's he who doesn't fit his clothes,\" cried one of the circle.  \"Well done, Burney!\" cried Slegge approvingly.  \"That's it.  Look at his hands and feet.  Bah!  I haven't patience with it.  The Doctor ought to be ashamed of himself, taking a nigger like that!  Why didn't he come dressed like a native, instead of disguised as an English lad?  And he's no more like it than chalk's like cheese.  Yes, I say the Doctor ought to be ashamed of himself, bringing a fellow like that into an establishment for the sons of gentlemen; and I'll tell him so before I have done.\"  \"Do,\" said the lad nearest to him; \"only do it when we are all there.  I should like to hear you give the Doctor a bit of your mind.\"  Slegge turned round upon him sharply.  \"Do you mean that,\" he said, \"or is it chaff?\"  \"Mean it?  Of course!\" cried the boy hastily.  \"Lucky for you, then,\" continued Slegge.  \"I suppose you haven't forgotten me giving you porridge before breakfast this time last year?\"  \"Here, what a chap you are!  I didn't mean any harm.  But I say, Slegge, old chap, you did scare them off.  I wish the Principal wouldn't have any more new boys.  I say, though, you don't mean to get the wickets pitched this morning, do you?\"  \"Of course I do,\" cried Slegge.  \"Do you want to go idling and staring over the wall and look at the show?\"  \"Well, I--I--\"  \"There, that will do,\" cried Slegge.  \"I know.  Just as if there weren't monkeys enough in the collection without you!\"  At this would-be witticism on the part of the tyrant of the school there was a fresh roar of laughter, which made the unfortunate against whom it was directed writhe with annoyance, and hurry off to conciliate his schoolfellow by getting the wickets pitched.    CHAPTER TWO.  DECLARATION OF WAR.  Meanwhile the two lads, who had retired from the field, strolled off together across the playground down to the pleasant lawn-like level which the Doctor, an old lover of the Surrey game, took a pride in having well kept for the benefit of his pupils, giving them a fair amount of privilege for this way of keeping themselves in health.  But to quote his words in one of his social lectures, he said:  \"You boys think me a dreadful old tyrant for keeping you slaving away at your classics and mathematics, because you recollect the work that you are often so unwilling to do, while the hours I give you for play quite slip your minds.  Now, this is my invariable rule, that you shall do everything well: work hard when it's work, and play hard when it's play.\"  The two lads, Glyn Severn and his companion of many years, Aziz Singh, a dark English boy in appearance and speech, but maharajah in his own right over a powerful principality in Southern India, strolled right away over the grass to the extreme end of the Doctor's extensive grounds, chatting together as boys will talk about the incidents of the morning.  \"Oh,\" cried the Indian lad angrily, \"I wish you hadn't stopped me.  I was just ready.\"  \"Why, what did you want to do, Singhy?\" cried the other.  \"Fight,\" said the boy, with his eyes flashing and his dark brows drawn down close together.  \"Oh, you shouldn't fight directly after breakfast,\" said Glyn Severn, laughing good-humouredly.  \"Why not?\" cried the other fiercely.  \"I felt just then as if I could kill him.\"  \"Then I am glad I lugged you away.\"  \"But you shouldn't,\" cried the young Indian.  \"You nearly made me hit you.\"  \"You had better not,\" said Glyn, laughing merrily.  \"Yes, of course; I know, and I don't want to.\"  \"That's right; and you mustn't kill people in England because you fall out with them.\"  \"No, of course not; I know that too.  But I don't like that boy.  He keeps on saying nasty things to us, and--and--what do you call it?  I know--bullies you, and says insulting things to me.  How dare he call me a nigger and say my father was a mahout?\"  \"The insulting brute!\" said Glyn.  \"Why should he do it?\" cried Singh.  \"Oh, it's plain enough.  It's because he is big and strong, and he wants to pick a quarrel with us.\"  \"But what for?\" cried Singh.  \"We never did him any harm.\"  \"Love of conquest, I suppose, so as to make us humble ourselves to him same as the other fellows do.  He wants to be cock of the school.\"  \"Oh--oh!\" cried Singh.  \"It does make me feel so hot.  What did he say to me: was I going to ride on the elephant?--Yes.  Well, suppose I was. It wouldn't be the first time.\"  \"Not by hundreds,\" cried Glyn.  \"I say, used it not to be grand?  Don't you wish we were going over the plains to-day on the back of old Sultan?\"  He pronounced it Sool-tann.  \"Ah, yes!\" cried Singh, with his eyes flashing now.  \"I do, I do! instead of being shut up in this old school to be bullied by a boy like that.  I should like to knock his head off.\"  \"No, you wouldn't.  There, don't think anything more about it.  He isn't worth your notice.\"  \"No, I suppose not,\" said the Indian boy;--\"but what makes me so angry is that he despises me, and has treated me ever since we came here as if I were his inferior.  It is not the first time he has called me a nigger.--There, I won't think anything more about it.  Tell me, what's this grand procession to-day?  Is it to be like a durbar at home, when all the rajahs and nawabs come together with their elephants and trains?\"  \"Oh, no, no, no!\" cried Glyn, laughing.  \"Nothing of the kind.\"  \"Then, why are they making all this fuss?  It said on the bills we saw yesterday in the town, `Ramball's Wild-Beast Show.  Grand Procession.'\"  \"I don't know much about it,\" said Glyn; \"only here in England in country places they make a great fuss over things like this.  I asked Wrench yesterday, and he said that this was a menagerie belonging to a man who lives near and keeps his wild-beasts at a big farm-like place just outside the town.\"  \"But why a procession?\" said Singh impatiently.  \"Oh, he takes them all round the country, going from town to town, and they are away for months, and now they are coming back.\"  \"Menagerie! beast show!\" said Singh thoughtfully.  \"They are all tame, of course?\"  \"Yes, of course,\" said Glyn.  \"It said lions and tigers and elephants and camels, and a lot more things on the bills.  I should like to see them.\"  \"You English are a wonderful people.  My father used to have tigers-- three of them--a tiger, a tigress, and a nearly full-grown cub.  But they were so fierce he got tired of keeping them, and when the tigress killed one of the keepers, you remember, he asked your father about it, and they settled that it would be best to kill them.\"  \"Of course, I remember,\" said Glyn; \"and they had a tiger-hunt, and let one out at a time, and had beaters to drive them out of the nullahs, and shot all three.\"  \"Yes,\" said Singh thoughtfully; \"and my father wouldn't let me go with him on his elephant, because he said it wouldn't be safe.  Then these will all be tame tigers and lions?  Well, I shall like to see them all the same, because it will make me feel like being at home once more.  I say, when is your father coming down again?\"  \"Don't know,\" said Glyn quietly.  \"I did ask in my last weekly letter.\"  \"Ah!\" said the Indian boy with a sigh, \"I wish I were you.\"  \"Well, let's change,\" said Glyn laughing.  \"You envy me!  Why, I ought to envy you.\"  \"Why?\" said Singh, staring.  \"Why, because you are a maharajah, a prince; and when you grow old enough you are going back to Dour to rule over your subjects and be one of the biggest pots in Southern India.\"  \"Well, what of that?\" said Singh quietly.  \"What good will that do me? But of course the Colonel will come too.\"  \"Ah, that remains to be seen,\" said Glyn.  \"That'll be years to come, and who knows what will happen before then?\"  \"I don't care what happens,\" cried Singh hotly.  \"He's coming back to India when I go.  Why, he told me himself that my father made him my guardian, and that he promised to look after me as long as he lived.  He said he promised to be a father to me.  It was that day when I got into a passion about something, and made him so cross.  But I was very sorry afterwards,\" said the boy quietly, \"he's such a good old fellow, and made me like him as much as I did my own father.\"  \"Well,\" said Glyn merrily, \"you have always had your share of him.  It has made me feel quite jealous sometimes.\"  \"Jealous!  Why?\" said Singh wonderingly.  \"Because he seemed to like you better than he did me.\"  \"What a shame!\" cried Singh.  \"Oh, I say, you don't mean that, do you, Glyn, old chap?  Why, you don't know how fond he is of you.\"  \"Don't I?\"  \"No; you should hear what he says about you sometimes.\"  \"Says about me?  What does he say about me?\"  \"Oh,"]]]
