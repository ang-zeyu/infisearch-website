Why don't you try something new?\"  \"Such as?\"  \"How should I know? Anything that comes along. Good gracious, Mr. Marson; here you are in the biggest city in the world, with chances for adventure simply shrieking to you on every side.\"  \"I must be deaf. The only thing I have heard shrieking to me on every side has been Mrs. Bell--for the week's rent.\"  \"Read the papers. Read the advertisement columns. I'm sure you will find something sooner or later. Don't get into a groove. Be an adventurer. Snatch at the next chance, whatever it is.\"  Ashe nodded.  \"Continue,\" he said. \"Proceed. You are stimulating me.\"  \"But why should you want a girl like me to stimulate you? Surely London is enough to do it without my help? You can always find something new, surely? Listen, Mr. Marson. I was thrown on my own resources about five years ago--never mind how. Since then I have worked in a shop, done typewriting, been on the stage, had a position as governess, been a lady's maid--\"  \"A what! A lady's maid?\"  \"Why not? It was all experience; and I can assure you I would much rather be a lady's maid than a governess.\"  \"I think I know what you mean. I was a private tutor once. I suppose a governess is the female equivalent. I have often wondered what General Sherman would have said about private tutoring if he expressed himself so breezily about mere war. Was it fun being a lady's maid?\"  \"It was pretty good fun; and it gave me an opportunity of studying the aristocracy in its native haunts, which has made me the Gossip's established authority on dukes and earls.\"  Ashe drew a deep breath--not a scientific deep breath, but one of admiration.  \"You are perfectly splendid!\"  \"Splendid?\"  \"I mean, you have such pluck.\"  \"Oh, well; I keep on trying. I'm twenty-three and I haven't achieved anything much yet; but I certainly don't feel like sitting back and calling myself a failure.\"  Ashe made a grimace.  \"All right,\" he said. \"I've got it.\"  \"I meant you to,\" said Joan placidly. \"I hope I haven't bored you with my autobiography, Mr. Marson. I'm not setting myself up as a shining example; but I do like action and hate stagnation.\"  \"You are absolutely wonderful!\" said Ashe. \"You are a human correspondence course in efficiency, one of the ones you see advertised in the back pages of the magazines, beginning, 'Young man, are you earning enough?' with a picture showing the dead beat gazing wistfully at the boss' chair. You would galvanize a jellyfish.\"  \"If I have really stimulated you-----\"  \"I think that was another slam,\" said Ashe pensively. \"Well, I deserve it. Yes, you have stimulated me. I feel like a new man. It's queer that you should have come to me right on top of everything else. I don't remember when I have felt so restless and discontented as this morning.\"  \"It's the Spring.\"  \"I suppose it is. I feel like doing something big and adventurous.\"  \"Well, do it then. You have a Morning Post on the table. Have you read it yet?\"  \"I glanced at it.\"  \"But you haven't read the advertisement pages? Read them. They may contain just the opening you want.\"  \"Well, I'll do it; but my experience of advertisement pages is that they are monopolized by philanthropists who want to lend you any sum from ten to a hundred thousand pounds on your note of hand only. However, I will scan them.\"  Joan rose and held out her hand.  \"Good-by, Mr. Marson. You've got your detective story to write, and I have to think out something with a duke in it by to-night; so I must be going.\" She smiled. \"We have traveled a good way from the point where we started, but I may as well go back to it before I leave you. I'm sorry I laughed at you this morning.\"  Ashe clasped her hand in a fervent grip.  \"I'm not. Come and laugh at me whenever you feel like it. I like being laughed at. Why, when I started my morning exercises, half of London used to come and roll about the sidewalks in convulsions. I'm not an attraction any longer and it makes me feel lonesome. There are twenty-nine of those Larsen Exercises and you saw only part of the first. You have done so much for me that if I can be of any use to you, in helping you to greet the day with a smile, I shall be only too proud. Exercise Six is a sure-fire mirth-provoker; I'll start with it to-morrow morning. I can also recommend Exercise Eleven--a scream! Don't miss it.\"  \"Very well. Well, good-by for the present.\"  \"Good-by.\"  She was gone; and Ashe, thrilling with new emotions, stared at the door which had closed behind her. He felt as though he had been wakened from sleep by a powerful electric shock.  Close beside the sheet of paper on which he had inscribed the now luminous and suggestive title of his new Gridley Quayle story lay the Morning Post, the advertisement columns of which he had promised her to explore. The least he could do was to begin at once.  His spirits sank as he did so. It was the same old game. A Mr. Brian MacNeill, though doing no business with minors, was willing--even anxious--to part with his vast fortune to anyone over the age of twenty-one whose means happened to be a trifle straitened. This good man required no security whatever; nor did his rivals in generosity, the Messrs. Angus Bruce, Duncan Macfarlane, Wallace Mackintosh and Donald MacNab. They, too, showed a curious distaste for dealing with minors; but anyone of maturer years could simply come round to the office and help himself.  Ashe threw the paper down wearily. He had known all along that it was no good. Romance was dead and the unexpected no longer happened. He picked up his pen and began to write \"The Adventure of the Wand of Death.\"    CHAPTER II  In a bedroom on the fourth floor of the Hotel Guelph in Piccadilly, the Honorable Frederick Threepwood sat in bed, with his knees drawn up to his chin, and glared at the day with the glare of mental anguish. He had very little mind, but what he had was suffering.  He had just remembered. It is like that in this life. You wake up, feeling as fit as a fiddle; you look at the window and see the sun, and thank Heaven for a fine day; you begin to plan a perfectly corking luncheon party with some of the chappies you met last night at the National Sporting Club; and then--you remember.  \"Oh, dash it!\" said the Honorable Freddie. And after a moment's pause: \"And I was feeling so dashed happy!\"  For the space of some minutes he remained plunged in sad meditation; then, picking up the telephone from the table at his side, he asked for a number.  \"Hello!\"  \"Hello!\" responded a rich voice at the other end of the wire.  \"Oh, I say! Is that you, Dickie?\"  \"Who is that?\"  \"This is Freddie Threepwood. I say, Dickie, old top, I want to see you about something devilish important. Will you be in at twelve?\"  \"Certainly. What's the trouble?\"  \"I can't explain over the wire; but it's deuced serious.\"  \"Very well. By the way, Freddie, congratulations on the engagement.\"  \"Thanks, old man. Thanks very much, and so on--but you won't forget to be in at twelve, will you? Good-by.\"  He replaced the receiver quickly and sprang out of bed, for he had heard the door handle turn. When the door opened he was giving a correct representation of a young man wasting no time in beginning his toilet for the day.  An elderly, thin-faced, bald-headed, amiably vacant man entered. He regarded the Honorable Freddie with a certain disfavor.  \"Are you only just getting up, Frederick?\"  \"Hello, gov'nor. Good morning. I shan't be two ticks now.\"  \"You should have been out and about two hours ago. The day is glorious.\"  \"Shan't be more than a minute, gov'nor, now. Just got to have a tub and then chuck on a few clothes.\"  He disappeared into the bathroom. His father, taking a chair, placed the tips of his fingers together and in this attitude remained motionless, a figure of disapproval and suppressed annoyance.  Like many fathers in his rank of life, the Earl of Emsworth had suffered much through that problem which, with the exception of Mr. Lloyd-George, is practically the only fly in the British aristocratic amber--the problem of what to do with the younger sons.  It is useless to try to gloss over the fact--in the aristocratic families of Great Britain the younger son is not required.  Apart, however, from the fact that he was a younger son, and, as such, a nuisance in any case, the honorable Freddie had always annoyed his father in a variety of ways. The Earl of Emsworth was so constituted that no man or thing really had the power to trouble him deeply; but Freddie had come nearer to doing it than anybody else in the world. There had been a consistency, a perseverance, about his irritating performances that had acted on the placid peer as dripping water on a stone. Isolated acts of annoyance would have been powerless to ruffle his calm; but Freddie had been exploding bombs under his nose since he went to Eton.  He had been expelled from Eton for breaking out at night and roaming the streets of Windsor in a false mustache. He had been sent down from Oxford for pouring ink from a second-story window on the junior dean of his college. He had spent two years at an expensive London crammer's and failed to pass into the army. He had also accumulated an almost record series of racing debts, besides as shady a gang of friends--for the most part vaguely connected with the turf--as any young man of his age ever contrived to collect.  These things try the most placid of parents; and finally Lord Emsworth had put his foot down. It was the only occasion in his life when he had acted with decision, and he did it with the accumulated energy of years. He stopped his son's allowance, haled him home to Blandings Castle, and kept him there so relentlessly that until the previous night, when they had come up together by an afternoon train, Freddie had not"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20425"],["title","The Peace Egg and Other tales (#1)"],["body"," \"It will be a legacy of peace,\" he thought, on his death-bed. \"The old man cannot hold out when she and her children are constantly in sight. And it may please GOD that I shall know of the reunion I have not been permitted to see with my eyes.\"  And thus it came about that the Captain's regiment went to India without him, and that the Captain's wife and her father lived on opposite sides of the same road.   MASTER ROBERT.  The eldest of the Captain's children was a boy. He was named Robert, after his grandfather, and seemed to have inherited a good deal of the old gentleman's character, mixed with gentler traits. He was a fair, fine boy, tall and stout for his age, with the Captain's regular features, and (he flattered himself) the Captain's firm step and martial bearing. He was apt--like his grandfather--to hold his own will to be other people's law, and (happily for the peace of the nursery) this opinion was devoutly shared by his brother Nicholas. Though the Captain had sold his commission, Robin continued to command an irregular force of volunteers in the nursery, and never was colonel more despotic. His brothers and sister were by turn infantry, cavalry, engineers, and artillery, according to his whim, and when his affections finally settled upon the Highlanders of \"The Black Watch,\" no female power could compel him to keep his stockings above his knees, or his knickerbockers below them.  The Captain alone was a match for his strong-willed son.  \"If you please, sir,\" said Sarah, one morning, flouncing in upon the Captain, just as he was about to start for the neighbouring town,--\"if you please, sir, I wish you'd speak to Master Robert. He's past my powers.\"  \"I've no doubt of it,\" thought the Captain, but he only said, \"Well, what's the matter?\"  \"Night after night do I put him to bed,\" said Sarah, \"and night after night does he get up as soon as I'm out of the room, and says he's orderly officer for the evening, and goes about in his night-shirt, and his feet as bare as boards.\"  The Captain fingered his heavy moustache to hide a smile, but he listened patiently to Sarah's complaints.  \"It ain't so much _him_ I should mind, sir,\" she continued, \"but he goes round the beds and wakes up the other young gentlemen and Miss Dora, one after another, and when I speak to him, he gives me all the sauce he can lay his tongue to, and says he's going round the guards. The other night I tried to put him back in his bed, but he got away and ran all over the house, me hunting him everywhere, and not a sign of him, till he jumps out on me from the garret-stairs and nearly knocks me down. 'I've visited the outposts, Sarah,' says he; 'all's well,' And off he goes to bed as bold as brass.\"  \"Have you spoken to your mistress?\" asked the Captain.  \"Yes, sir,\" said Sarah. \"And missis spoke to him, and he promised not to go round the guards again.\"  \"Has he broken his promise?\" asked the Captain, with a look of anger, and also of surprise.  \"When I opened the door last night, sir,\" continued Sarah, in her shrill treble, \"what should I see in the dark but Master Robert a-walking up and down with the carpet-brush stuck in his arm. 'Who goes there?' says he. 'You owdacious boy!' says I. 'Didn't you promise your ma you'd leave off them tricks?' 'I'm not going round the guards,' says he; 'I promised not. But I'm for sentry-duty to-night.' And say what I would to him, all he had for me was, 'You mustn't speak to a sentry on duty.' So I says, 'As sure as I live till morning, I'll go to your pa,' for he pays no more attention to his ma than to me, nor to any one else.\"  \"Please to see that the chair-bed in my dressing-room is moved into your mistress's bedroom,\" said the Captain. \"I will attend to Master Robert.\"  With this Sarah had to content herself, and she went back to the nursery. Robert was nowhere to be seen, and made no reply to her summons. On this the unwary nursemaid flounced into the bedroom to look for him, when Robert, who was hidden beneath a table, darted forth, and promptly locked her in.  \"You're under arrest,\" he shouted, through the keyhole.  \"Let me out!\" shrieked Sarah.  \"I'll send a file of the guard to fetch you to the orderly room, by and by,\" said Robert, \"for 'preferring frivolous complaints.'\" And he departed to the farmyard to look at the ducks.  That night, when Robert went up to bed, the Captain quietly locked him into his dressing-room, from which the bed had been removed.  \"You're for sentry-duty to-night,\" said the Captain. \"The carpet-brush is in the corner. Good-evening.\"  As his father anticipated, Robert was soon tired of the sentry game in these new circumstances, and long before the night had half worn away he wished himself safely undressed and in his own comfortable bed. At half-past twelve o'clock he felt as if he could bear it no longer, and knocked at the Captain's door.  \"Who goes there?\" said the Captain.  \"Mayn't I go to bed, please?\" whined poor Robert.  \"Certainly not,\" said the Captain. \"You're on duty.\"  And on duty poor Robert had to remain, for the Captain had a will as well as his son. So he rolled himself up in his father's railway-rug, and slept on the floor.  The next night he was very glad to go quietly to bed, and remain there.   IN THE NURSERY.  The Captain's children sat at breakfast in a large, bright nursery. It was the room where the old bachelor had died, and now _her_ children made it merry. This was just what he would have wished.  They all sat round the table, for it was breakfast-time. There were five of them, and five bowls of boiled bread-and-milk smoked before them. Sarah (a foolish, gossiping girl, who acted as nurse till better could be found) was waiting on them, and by the table sat Darkie, the black retriever, his long, curly back swaying slightly from the difficulty of holding himself up, and his solemn hazel eyes fixed very intently on each and all of the breakfast bowls. He was as silent and sagacious as Sarah was talkative and empty-headed. The expression of his face was that of King Charles I. as painted by Vandyke. Though large, he was unassuming. Pax, the pug, on the contrary, who came up to the first joint of Darkie's leg, stood defiantly on his dignity (and his short stumps). He always placed himself in front of the bigger dog, and made a point of hustling him in doorways and of going first down-stairs. He strutted like a beadle, and carried his tail more tightly curled than a bishop's crook. He looked as one may imagine the frog in the fable would have looked, had he been able to swell himself rather nearer to the size of the ox. This was partly due to his very prominent eyes, and partly to an obesity favoured by habits of lying inside the fender, and of eating meals proportioned more to his consequence than to his hunger. They were both favourites of two years' standing, and had very nearly been given away, when the good news came of an English home for the family, dogs and all.  Robert's tongue was seldom idle, even at meals. \"Are you a Yorkshirewoman, Sarah?\" he asked, pausing, with his spoon full in his hand.  \"No, Master Robert,\" said Sarah.  \"But you understand Yorkshire, don't you? I can't, very often; but Mamma can, and can speak it, too. Papa says Mamma always talks Yorkshire to servants and poor people. She used to talk Yorkshire to Themistocles, Papa said, and he said it was no good; for though Themistocles knew a lot of languages, he didn't know that. And Mamma laughed, and said she didn't know she did.\"--\"Themistocles was our man-servant in Corfu,\" Robin added, in explanation. \"He stole lots of things, Themistocles did; but Papa found him out.\"  Robin now made a rapid attack on his bread-and-milk, after which he broke out again.  \"Sarah, who is that tall old gentleman at church, in the seat near the pulpit? He wears a cloak like what the Blues wear, only all blue, and is tall enough for a Lifeguardsman. He stood when we were kneeling down, and said _Almighty and most merciful Father_ louder than anybody.\"  Sarah knew who the old gentleman was, and knew also that the children did not know, and that their parents did not see fit to tell them as yet. But she had a passion for telling and hearing news, and would rather gossip with a child than not gossip at all. \"Never you mind, Master Robin,\" she said, nodding sagaciously. \"Little boys aren't to know everything.\"  \"Ah, then, I know you don't know,\" replied Robert; \"if you did, you'd tell. Nicholas, give some of your bread to Darkie and Pax. I've done mine. _For what we have received, the Lord make us truly thankful._ Say your grace and put your chair away, and come along. I want to hold a court-martial!\" And seizing his own chair by the seat, Robin carried it swiftly to its corner. As he passed Sarah, he observed tauntingly, \"You pretend to know, but you don't.\"  \"I do,\" said Sarah.  \"You don't,\" said Robin.  \"Your ma's forbid you to contradict, Master Robin,\" said Sarah; \"and if you do I shall tell her. I know well enough who the old gentleman is, and perhaps I might tell you, only you'd go straight off and tell again.\"  \"No, no, I wouldn't!\" shouted Robin. \"I can keep a secret, indeed I can! Pinch my little finger, and try. Do, do tell me, Sarah, there's a dear Sarah, and then I shall know you know.\" And he danced round her, catching at her skirts.  To keep a secret was beyond Sarah's powers.  \"Do let my dress be, Master Robin,\" she said, \"you're ripping out all the gathers, and listen while I whisper. As sure as you're a living boy, that gentleman's your own grandpapa.\"  Robin lost his hold on Sarah's dress; his arms fell by his side, and he stood with his brows knit for some minutes, thinking. Then he said, emphatically, \"What lies you do tell, Sarah!\"  \"Oh, Robin!\" cried Nicholas, who had drawn near, his thick curls standing stark with curiosity, \"Mamma said 'lies' wasn't a proper word, and you promised not to say it again.\"  \"I forgot,\" said Robin. \"I didn't mean to break my"]]]
