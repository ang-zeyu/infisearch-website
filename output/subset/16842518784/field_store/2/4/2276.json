Now, then, what is it?\"  \"Well, sir, you boast of knowing me thoroughly.  Let me tell you that I know you, and your position here.\"  \"And find it is in every respect a strong one, sir.  Well?\"  \"You live here, close at hand to an enemy who covets your lands, and with whom you have fought again and again.  You and your ancestors were always enemies with the Edens.\"  \"Quite right, sir.  Well, what is that to you?\"  \"This, Sir Morton Darley.  The war is over.  I and my brave fellows are idle, our swords rusting in their sheaths.\"  \"More shame to the brave fellows who do not keep their weapons bright. Well, this is a long preamble to tell me that you have all been dismissed from the king's service.  Go on.\"  The captain stared and scowled, but he could not fully meet the searching eyes which looked him down.  \"Well,\" he said, rather blunderingly now, \"knowing what I did of my old officer's state--\"  \"`Old officer' is better, Captain Purlrose.  Go on, sir.\"  \"I said, here am I, a brave soldier, with a handful of stout followers, eager to do good, honest work; why should I not go and offer my sword to Sir Morton Darley?  He is sorely pressed.\"  \"Wrong,\" said Sir Morton.  \"He would be glad of our help,\" continued the man, without heeding the interruption; \"we could garrison his castle and help him to drive his enemy from the field.  Twelve of them, all well-tried soldiers, who can make him king of the country round.  That, sir, is why I have come, to confer a favour more than ask one.  Now, sir, what do you say?  Such a chance for you may never occur again.\"  \"Hah!\" ejaculated Sir Morton; \"and all this out of pure good fellowship!\"  \"Of course; save that a retainer who risks his life in his chief's service is worthy of his hire.\"  \"Naturally, sir.  So that is your meaning--your object in coming?\"  \"That is it, Sir Morton.  We can put your castle in a state of defence, make raids, and harass the enemy, fetch in stores from the surrounding country, and make you a great man.  Think of how you can humble the Edens.\"  Sir Morton frowned as he looked back at the past, and then from thence up to his present position, one in which he felt that he played a humble part in presence of his stronger enemy; and Ralph watched him, read in his face that he was about to accept his visitor's proposal, and with a feeling of horror at the thought of such a gang being hired to occupy a part of the castle, and brought, as it were, into a kind of intimacy, he turned quickly to his father, laid his hand upon his arm, and whispered eagerly:  \"Father, pray, pray don't do this.  They are a terribly villainous set of ruffians.\"  The captain twitched his big ears in his efforts to catch what was said; but he could only hear enough to make out that the son was opposing the plans, and he scowled fiercely at the lad.  \"Wait, wait,\" said Sir Morton.  \"But do go out and look at the rest of the men, father,\" whispered Ralph.  \"There is no need.\"  \"Then you will not agree, father?\"  \"Most certainly not, my boy.\"  Purlrose could not catch all this, but he scowled again.  \"Look here, young cockerel,\" he cried, \"don't you try and set my old officer against me.\"  \"No need,\" said Sir Morton hotly.  \"Ah, that's because hard times have made me and my poor gallant fellows look a little shabby.\"  \"Not that, sir.  Your old character stands in your way.\"  \"Oh, this is hard--this is hard.  You rich, and with everything comfortable, while I am poor, and unrewarded for all my labour and risk by an ungrateful Scot.\"  \"Don't insult your sovereign, sir!\" cried Sir Morton.  \"Oh, this is hard--this is hard.\"  \"Look here, Michael Purlrose, if you had been an officer and a gentleman in distress, I would have helped you.\"  \"Do you mean to say that I am not an officer, and a gentleman in distress, sir?\" cried the captain, clapping his hand to the hilt of his sword, a movement imitated by Ralph, angrily.  But Sir Morton stood back, unmoved.  \"Let your sword alone, boy,\" he said sternly.  \"You, Michael Purlrose, knowing you as I do of old, for a mouthing, cowardly bully, do you think that I am going to be frightened by your swagger?  Yes, I tell you that you are no gentleman.\"  \"Oh, this is too much,\" cried the visitor.  \"It is enough to make me call in my men.\"  \"Indeed!\" said Sir Morton coolly.  \"Why call them in to hear me recapitulate your disgrace?  As to your appeals to me for help, and your claim, which you profess to have upon me, let me remind you that you were engaged as a soldier of fortune, and well paid for your services, though you and yours disgraced the royal army by your robberies and outrages.  All you gained you wasted in riot and drunkenness, and now that you are suffering for your follies, you come and make claims upon me.\"  \"Oh, this is too hard upon a poor soldier who has bled in his country's service.  Did I not once save your life, when you were at your last gasp?\"  \"No, sir; it was the other way on.  I saved yours, and when I was surrounded, and would have been glad of your help, you ran away.\"  \"Ha-ha-ha!\" cried Ralph, bursting into a roar of laughter.  \"Ah-h-ah!\" cried the captain fiercely, as he half drew his sword; but he drove it back with a loud clang into its sheath directly.  \"Stay there, brave blade, my only true and trusted friend.  He is the son of my old companion-in-arms, and I cannot draw upon a boy.\"  Ralph laughed aloud again, and the captain scowled, and rolled his eyes fiercely; but he did not startle the lad in the least, and after a long, fierce stare, the man turned to Sir Morton.  \"Don't be hard upon an old brother-soldier, Morton Darley,\" he said.  \"No, I will not,\" said Sir Morton quietly.  \"You and your men can refresh yourselves in the hall, and when you start on your way, I will give you a pound or two to help you.\"  \"Oh, as if I were a common wayside beggar.  Comrade, this is too hard. Can you not see that my beard is getting grizzled and grey?\"  \"Yes; but I do not see what that has to do with it.\"  \"Think again, old comrade.  Twelve brave and true men have I with me. Take us as your gentlemen and men at arms to protect you and yours against those who are unfriendly.  You must have enemies.\"  Sir Morton started and glanced at his son, for these words touched a spring in his breast.  With thirteen fighting men to increase his little force, what might he not do?  The Edens' stronghold, with its regularly coming-in wealth, must fall before him; and, once in possession, Sir Edward Eden might petition and complain; but possession was nine points of the law, and the king had enough to do without sending a force into their wild out-of-the-way part of the world to interfere.  Once he had hold of the Black Tor, he could laugh at the law, and see the old enemy of his house completely humbled.  Sir Morton hesitated and turned his head, to find his son watching him keenly, while Captain Purlrose stood with his left hand resting on the hilt of his sword, making the scabbard cock out behind, and lift up the back of his ragged cloak, as with his right he twisted up and pointed one side of his rusty-grey fierce moustache.  The man was watching Sir Morton keenly, and his big ears twitched, as he tried to catch the whispered words which passed between father and son.  \"What do you say, Ralph, lad?  With the help of these men I could easily make Eden bite the dust.  Then the Black Tor would be mine, and afterwards yours; with all the rich revenue to be drawn from the lead-mine.  It is very tempting, boy.\"  \"Yes, father,\" said the boy hotly, and his face flushed as he spoke; \"but that's what it is--a miserable temptation.  We'll humble the Edens, and have the Black Tor and the lead-mine; but we'll win all with our swords like gentlemen, or fail.  We could not go and take the place with a set of ruffians like those outside, and helped by such a man as yonder bully.  You couldn't do it, father.  Say no.\"  \"Hah!  More insults,\" cried Purlrose, who had caught a word here and there.  \"But no; lie still, good sword: he is a beardless boy, and the son of the brave comrade I always honoured, whate'er my faults.\"  Ralph turned upon him angrily; but his father laid a hand upon the boy's shoulder, and pressed it hard.  \"Right, Ralph, lad,\" he said warmly, and he looked proudly in the boy's eyes.  \"I could not do it in that way.\"  \"Hah!\" ejaculated the lad, with a sigh of content.  \"No, Purlrose,\" continued Sir Morton.  \"I shall not avail myself of your services.  Go into the hall and refresh yourself and your men.  Come to me afterward, and I will help you as I said.\"  \"With a mouthful of bread, and a few pence, and after all this weary journey across these wild moors.  But I see: it is all through the words of this beardless boy.  Suppose I tell you that, now I have come, I mean to stay?\" he added threateningly.  \"Shall I get the men together, father?\" said Ralph quickly.  \"No, boy, there is no need,\" said Sir Morton firmly.  \"I am not afraid of Michael Purlrose's threats.\"  \"What!\" cried the man.  \"You do not know me yet.\"  \"Better than you know yourself, sir,\" said Sir Morton, rising.  \"That is the way to the hall.  Have the goodness to go first.\"  The captain threw his cloak back over his right shoulder, slapped his right hand heavily upon his rusty breast-plate, and then, with a flourish, caught at the hilt of his sword, and again half drew it from its sheath, to stand scowling at Ralph, the intentness of his gaze seeming to affect his eyes, so that they began to lean towards each other, as if for help, till his look"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/213"],["title","The Man from Snowy River (#1)"],["body","to face.    Then they halted for a moment, while he swung the dreaded lash,     But they saw their well-loved mountain full in view,    And they charged beneath the stockwhip with a sharp and sudden dash,     And off into the mountain scrub they flew.     Then fast the horsemen followed, where the gorges deep and black     Resounded to the thunder of their tread,    And the stockwhips woke the echoes, and they fiercely answered back     From cliffs and crags that beetled overhead.    And upward, ever upward, the wild horses held their way,     Where mountain ash and kurrajong grew wide;    And the old man muttered fiercely, 'We may bid the mob good day,     _NO_ man can hold them down the other side.'     When they reached the mountain's summit, even Clancy took a pull,     It well might make the boldest hold their breath,    The wild hop scrub grew thickly, and the hidden ground was full     Of wombat holes, and any slip was death.    But the man from Snowy River let the pony have his head,     And he swung his stockwhip round and gave a cheer,    And he raced him down the mountain like a torrent down its bed,     While the others stood and watched in very fear.     He sent the flint stones flying, but the pony kept his feet,     He cleared the fallen timber in his stride,    And the man from Snowy River never shifted in his seat --     It was grand to see that mountain horseman ride.    Through the stringy barks and saplings, on the rough and broken ground,     Down the hillside at a racing pace he went;    And he never drew the bridle till he landed safe and sound,     At the bottom of that terrible descent.     He was right among the horses as they climbed the further hill,     And the watchers on the mountain standing mute,    Saw him ply the stockwhip fiercely, he was right among them still,     As he raced across the clearing in pursuit.    Then they lost him for a moment, where two mountain gullies met     In the ranges, but a final glimpse reveals    On a dim and distant hillside the wild horses racing yet,     With the man from Snowy River at their heels.     And he ran them single-handed till their sides were white with foam.     He followed like a bloodhound on their track,    Till they halted cowed and beaten, then he turned their heads for home,     And alone and unassisted brought them back.    But his hardy mountain pony he could scarcely raise a trot,     He was blood from hip to shoulder from the spur;    But his pluck was still undaunted, and his courage fiery hot,     For never yet was mountain horse a cur.     And down by Kosciusko, where the pine-clad ridges raise     Their torn and rugged battlements on high,    Where the air is clear as crystal, and the white stars fairly blaze     At midnight in the cold and frosty sky,    And where around the Overflow the reedbeds sweep and sway     To the breezes, and the rolling plains are wide,    The man from Snowy River is a household word to-day,     And the stockmen tell the story of his ride.     Old Pardon, the Son of Reprieve       You never heard tell of the story?     Well, now, I can hardly believe!    Never heard of the honour and glory     Of Pardon, the son of Reprieve?    But maybe you're only a Johnnie     And don't know a horse from a hoe?    Well, well, don't get angry, my sonny,     But, really, a young un should know.     They bred him out back on the 'Never',     His mother was Mameluke breed.    To the front -- and then stay there -- was ever     The root of the Mameluke creed.    He seemed to inherit their wiry     Strong frames -- and their pluck to receive --    As hard as a flint and as fiery     Was Pardon, the son of Reprieve.     We ran him at many a meeting     At crossing and gully and town,    And nothing could give him a beating --     At least when our money was down.    For weight wouldn't stop him, nor distance,     Nor odds, though the others were fast,    He'd race with a dogged persistence,     And wear them all down at the last.     At the Turon the Yattendon filly     Led by lengths at the mile-and-a-half,    And we all began to look silly,     While _HER_ crowd were starting to laugh;    But the old horse came faster and faster,     His pluck told its tale, and his strength,    He gained on her, caught her, and passed her,     And won it, hands-down, by a length.     And then we swooped down on Menindie     To run for the President's Cup --    Oh! that's a sweet township -- a shindy     To them is board, lodging, and sup.    Eye-openers they are, and their system     Is never to suffer defeat;    It's 'win, tie, or wrangle' -- to best 'em     You must lose 'em, or else it's 'dead heat'.     We strolled down the township and found 'em     At drinking and gaming and play;    If sorrows they had, why they drowned 'em,     And betting was soon under way.    Their horses were good 'uns and fit 'uns,     There was plenty of cash in the town;    They backed their own horses like Britons,     And, Lord! how _WE_ rattled it down!     With gladness we thought of the morrow,     We counted our wagers with glee,    A simile homely to borrow --     'There was plenty of milk in our tea.'    You see we were green; and we never     Had even a thought of foul play,    Though we well might have known that the clever     Division would 'put us away'.     Experience 'docet', they tell us,     At least so I've frequently heard,    But, 'dosing' or 'stuffing', those fellows     Were up to each move on the board:    They got to his stall -- it is sinful     To think what such villains would do --    And they gave him a regular skinful     Of barley -- green barley -- to chew.     He munched it all night, and we found him     Next morning as full as a hog --    The girths wouldn't nearly meet round him;     He looked like an overfed frog.    We saw we were done like a dinner --     The odds were a thousand to one    Against Pardon turning up winner,     'Twas cruel to ask him to run.     We got to the course with our troubles,     A crestfallen couple were we;    And we heard the 'books' calling the doubles --     A roar like the surf of the sea;    And over the tumult and louder     Rang 'Any price Pardon, I lay!'    Says Jimmy, 'The children of Judah     Are out on the warpath to-day.'     Three miles in three heats: -- Ah, my sonny,     The horses in those days were stout,    They had to run well to win money;     I don't see such horses about.    Your six-furlong vermin that scamper     Half-a-mile with their feather-weight up;    They wouldn't earn much of their damper     In a race like the President's Cup.     The first heat was soon set a-going;     The Dancer went off to the front;    The Don on his quarters was showing,     With Pardon right out of the hunt.    He rolled and he weltered and wallowed --     You'd kick your hat faster, I'll bet;    They finished all bunched, and he followed     All lathered and dripping with sweat.     But troubles came thicker upon us,     For while we were rubbing him dry    The stewards came over to warn us:     'We hear you are running a bye!    If Pardon don't spiel like tarnation     And win the next heat -- if he can --    He'll earn a disqualification;     Just think over _THAT_, now, my man!'     Our money all gone and our credit,     Our horse couldn't gallop a yard;    And then people thought that _WE_ did it!     It really was terribly hard.    We were objects of mirth and derision     To folk in the lawn and the stand,    And the yells of the clever division     Of 'Any price Pardon!' were grand.     We still had a chance for the money,     Two heats still remained to be run;    If both fell to us -- why, my sonny,     The clever division were done.    And Pardon was better, we reckoned,     His sickness was passing away,    So he went to the post for the second     And principal heat of the day.     They're off and away with a rattle,     Like dogs from the leashes let slip,    And right at the back of the battle     He followed them under the whip.    They gained ten good lengths on him quickly     He dropped right away from the pack;    I tell you it made me feel sickly     To see the blue jacket fall back.     Our very last hope had departed --     We thought the old fellow was done,    When all of a sudden he started     To go like a shot from a gun.    His chances seemed slight to embolden     Our hearts; but, with teeth firmly set,    We thought, 'Now or never!  The old 'un     May reckon with some of 'em yet.'     Then loud rose the war-cry for Pardon;     He swept like the wind down the dip,    And over the rise by the garden,     The jockey was done with the whip    The field were at sixes and sevens --     The pace at the first had been fast --    And hope seemed to drop from the heavens,     For Pardon was coming at last.     And how he did come!  It was splendid;     He gained on them yards every bound,    Stretching out like a greyhound extended,     His girth laid right down on the ground.    A shimmer of silk in the cedars     As into the running they wheeled,    And out flashed the whips on the leaders,     For Pardon had collared the field.     Then right through the ruck he came sailing --     I knew that the battle was won --    The son of Haphazard was failing,     The Yattendon filly was done;    He cut down the Don and the Dancer,     He raced clean away from the mare --    He's in front!  Catch him now if you can, sir!     And up went my hat in the air!     Then loud from the lawn and the garden     Rose offers of 'Ten to one _ON!_'    'Who'll bet on the field?  I back Pardon!'     No use; all the money was gone.    He came for the third heat light-hearted,     A-jumping and dancing about;    The others were done ere they started     Crestfallen, and tired, and worn out.     He won it, and ran it much faster     Than even the first, I believe    Oh, he was the daddy, the master,     Was Pardon, the son of Reprieve.    He showed 'em the method to"]]]
