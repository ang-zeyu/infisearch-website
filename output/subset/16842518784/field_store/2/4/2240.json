She was very long in proportion to her beam; low in the water, and her lines were as fine as it had been possible to make them.  She had a very light, elegant-looking stern, adorned with a great deal of carved scroll-work about the cabin windows; and her gracefully-curved cut-water was surmounted by an exquisitely-carved full-length figure of Peneus' lovely daughter, with both arms outstretched, as in the act of flight, and with twigs and leaves of laurel just springing from her dainty finger-tips.  There was a great deal of brass-work about the deck fittings, which gleamed and flashed brilliantly in the sun; and, the paint being new and fresh, she looked altogether superlatively neat, in spite of the fact that the operations of rigging and of shipping stores were both going on simultaneously.  Having satisfied for the time being my curiosity with regard to the hull of my future home, I next cast a glance aloft at her spars.  She was rigged only as far as her topmast-heads, her topgallant-masts being then on deck in process of preparation for sending aloft.  When I had last seen her she was under the masting-shears getting her lower-masts stepped; and it then struck me that they were fitting her with rather heavy spars.  But now, as I looked aloft, I was fairly startled at the length and girth of her masts and yards.  To my eye--by no means an unaccustomed one--her spars seemed taunt enough for a ship of nearly double her size; and the rigging was heavy in the same proportion.  I stood there on the wharf watching with the keenest interest the scene of bustle and animation on board until the bell rang the hour of noon, and all hands knocked off work and went to dinner; by which time the three topgallant-masts were aloft with the rigging all ready for setting up when the men turned-to again.  The addition of these spars to the length of her already lofty masts gave the _Daphne_, in my opinion, more than ever the appearance of being over-sparred; an opinion in which, as it soon appeared, I was not alone.  Most of the men left the dockyard and went home (as I suppose) to their dinner; but half a dozen or so of riggers, instead of following the example of the others, routed out from some obscure spot certain small bundles tied up in coloured handkerchiefs, and, bringing these on shore, seated themselves upon some of the boxes and casks with which the wharf was lumbered, and, opening the bundles, produced therefrom their dinners, which they proceeded to discuss with quite an enviable appetite.  For a few minutes the meal proceeded in dead silence; but presently one of them, glancing aloft at the _Daphne's_ spars, remarked in a tone of voice which reached me distinctly--I was standing within a few feet of the party:  \"Well, Tom, bo'; what d'ye think of the hooker _now_?\"  The man addressed shook his head disapprovingly.  \"The more I looks at her the less I likes her,\" was his reply.  \"I'm precious glad _I_ ain't goin' to sea in her,\" observed another.  \"Same here,\" said the first speaker.  \"Why, look at the _Siren_ over there!  She's a 38-gun frigate, and her mainmast is only two feet longer than the _Daphne's_--as I happen to know, for I had a hand in the buildin' of both the spars.  The sloop's over-masted, that's what _she_ is.\"  I turned away and bent my steps homeward.  The short snatch of conversation which I had just heard, confirming as it did my own convictions, had a curiously depressing effect upon me, which was increased when, a few minutes afterwards, I caught a glimpse of the distant buoy which marked the position of the sunken _Royal George_. For the moment my enthusiasm was all gone; a foreboding of disaster took possession of me, and but for very shame I felt more than half-inclined to tell my father I had altered my mind, and would rather not go to sea. I had occasion afterwards to devoutly wish I had acted on this impulse.  When, however, I was awakened next morning by the sun shining brilliantly in at my bed-room window, my apprehensions had vanished, my enthusiasm was again at fever-heat, and I panted for the moment--not to be very long deferred--when I should don my uniform and strut forth to sport my glories before an admiring world.  Punctual almost to a moment--for once at least in his life--Mr Shears sent home the uniform whilst we were sitting down to luncheon; and the moment that I decently could I hastened away to try it on.  The breeches were certainly rather wrinkly above the knees, and the jacket was somewhat uncomfortably tight across the chest when buttoned over; it also pinched me a good deal under the arm-pits, whilst the sleeves exhibited a trifle too much--some six inches or so--of my wristbands and shirt-sleeves; and when I looked at myself in the glass I found that there was a well-defined ridge of loose cloth running across the back from shoulder to shoulder.  With these trifling exceptions, however, I thought the suit fitted me fairly well, and I hastened down- stairs to exhibit myself to my sister Eva.  To my intense surprise and indignation she no sooner saw me than she burst into an uncontrollable fit of laughter, and was heartless enough to declare that I looked \"a perfect fright.\"  Thoroughly disgusted with such unsisterly conduct I mustered all my dignity, and without condescending to ask for an explanation walked in contemptuous silence out of the room and the house.  A regimental band was to play that afternoon on Southsea Common, and thither I accordingly decided to direct my steps.  There were a good many people about the streets, and I had not gone very far before I made the discovery that everybody was in high good-humour about something or other.  The people I met wore, almost without exception, genial smiling countenances, and many a peal of hearty laughter rang out from hilarious groups who had already passed me.  I felt anxious to know what it was that thus set all Portsmouth laughing, and glanced round to see if I could discover an acquaintance of whom I might inquire; but, as usual in such cases, was unsuccessful.  When I reached the Common I found, as I expected I should, a large and fashionably dressed crowd, with a good sprinkling of naval and military uniforms, listening to the strains of the band.  Here, for the first five minutes or so, I failed to notice anything unusual in the behaviour of the people; but the humorous item of news must have reached them almost simultaneously with my own arrival upon the scene, for very soon I detected on the faces of those who passed me the same amused smile which I had before encountered in the streets.  I stood well back out of the thick of the crowd; both because I could hear the music better, and also to afford any friend of mine who might chance to be present an opportunity to see me in my imposing new uniform.  It was whilst I was standing thus in the most easy and nonchalant attitude I could assume that a horrible discovery forced itself upon me. I happened to be regarding with a certain amount of languid interest a couple of promenaders, consisting of a very lovely girl and a somewhat foppish ensign, when I suddenly caught the eye of the latter fixed upon me.  He raised his eye-glass to his eye, and, in the coolest manner in the world, deliberately surveyed me through it, when, in an instant, a broad smile of amusement--the smile which I by this time knew so well-- overspread his otherwise inanimate features.  I glanced hurriedly behind me to see if I could discover the cause of his risibility, and, failing to do so, turned round again, just in time to see him, with his eye- glass still bearing straight in my direction, bend his head and speak a few words to his fair companion.  Thereupon she, too, glanced in my direction, looked steadfastly at me for a moment, and then burst into an uncontrollable fit of laughter which she vainly strove to stifle in her pocket-handkerchief.  For a second or two I was utterly lost in astonishment at this unaccountable behaviour, and then all the hideous truth thrust itself upon me.  They were laughing at _me_.  Having at length fully realised this I turned haughtily away and at once left the ground.  I hurried homeward in a most unenviable state of mind, with the conviction every moment forcing itself more obtrusively upon me, that for some inconceivable reason I was the laughing-stock of everybody I met, when, just as I turned once more into the High Street I observed two midshipmen approaching on my own side of the way, and some half a dozen yards or so behind them a certain Miss Smith, a parlour boarder in the ladies' seminary opposite my father's house--a damsel not more than six or seven years my senior, with whom I was slightly acquainted, and for whom I had long cherished a secret but ardent passion.  With that sensitiveness which is so promptly evoked by even the bare suspicion of ridicule I furtively watched the two \"young gentlemen\" as they approached; but they had been talking and laughing loudly when I first caught sight of them, and although I saw that they were aware of my presence I failed to detect the sudden change of manner which I had dreaded to observe.  Whether they were speaking of me or not I could not, of course, feel certain; but I rather fancied from the glances they cast in my direction that they were.  As they drew nearer I observed that the eyes of one of them were intently and inquiringly gazing into mine, and they continued so to do until the pair had fairly passed me.  Being by this time in a decidedly aggressive frame of mind I returned this pertinacious gaze with a haughty and contemptuous stare, which, however, I must confess, did not appear to very greatly intimidate the individual at whom it was levelled, for, unless I was greatly mistaken, there was a twitching about the corners of his mouth which suggested a strong, indeed an almost uncontrollable disposition to laughter, whilst his eyes fairly beamed with merriment.  As"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21060"],["title","The Congo Rovers: A Story of the Slave Squadron (#2)"],["body","passed me this individual half halted for an instant, passed on again a step or two, and then turning abruptly to the right-about, dashed after me and seized me by the hand, which he shook effusively, exclaiming as he did so:  \"It _is_--I'm _sure_ it is!  My _dear_ Lord Henry, how are you?  This is indeed an unexpected pleasure!\"  At this moment Miss Smith passed, giving me as she did so a little start of recognition, followed by a bow and a beaming smile, which I returned in my most fascinating manner.  I was once more happy.  This little incident, trifling though it was in itself, sufficed to banish in an instant the unpleasant reflections which a moment before had been rankling in my breast, for had not my fair divinity seen me in the uniform of the gallant defenders of our country?  And had she not also heard and seen me mistaken for a lord? If this had no power to soften and subdue that proud heart and bring it in sweet humility to my feet, then--well I should like to know what would, that's all.  I allowed my fair enslaver to pass out of ear-shot, and then said to the midshipman who had so unexpectedly addressed me:  \"Excuse me, sir, but I think you are mistaking me for someone else.\"  \"Oh, no, I'm not,\" he retorted.  \"I know you well enough--though I must say you are greatly altered for the better since I saw you last a year ago.  You're Lord Henry de Vere Montmorenci.  Ah, you sly dog! you thought to play a trick upon your old friend Fitz-Jones, did you?  But what brings you down here, Montmorenci?  Have you come down to join?\"  This was a most remarkable, and at the same time gratifying occurrence, for I could not keep feeling elated at being thus mistaken for a noble, and greeted with such enthusiasm by a most agreeable and intelligent brother officer, and--evidently--a scion of some noble house to boot. For a single instant an almost invincible temptation seized me to personate the character with which I was accredited, but it was as promptly overcome; my respect for the truth (temporarily) conquered my vanity, and I answered:  \"I assure you, my dear sir, you are mistaken.  I am _not_ Lord Henry de Vere Montmorenci, but plain Richard Hawkesley, just nominated to the _Daphne_.\"  \"Well, if you persist in saying so, I suppose I must believe you,\" answered Fitz-Jones.  \"But, really, the resemblance is most extraordinary--truly remarkable indeed.  There is the same lofty intellectual forehead, the same proud eagle-glance, the same haughty carriage; the same--now, tell me, Tomnoddy, upon your honour as an officer and a gentleman, did you ever in your life before see such an extraordinary resemblance?\"  \"I never did; it is really most remarkable,\" answered the other midshipman in a strangely quivering voice which, but for his solemn countenance, I should have considered decidedly indicative of suppressed laughter.  \"It really is most singular, positively _marvellous_,\" resumed Fitz- Jones.  Then he added hurriedly:  \"By the way, do you know my friend Tomnoddy?  No!  Then allow me to introduce him.  Lord Tomnoddy--Mr Richard Hawkesley, just nominated to the _Daphne_.  And I suppose I ought also to introduce myself.  I am Lord Montague Fitz-Jones.  You have, of course, heard of the Fitz-Jones family--the Fitz-J-o-h-n-e-s's, you know?\"  I certainly had not; nor had I, up to that moment, any idea that Lord Tomnoddy was other than a mythical personage; but I did not choose to parade my ignorance in such matters, so I replied by a polite bow.  There was silence between us for a moment; and then Fitz-Jones--or Fitz- Johnes, rather--raised his hand to his forehead with a thoughtful air and murmured:  \"Hawkesley!  Hawkesley!  I'm _positive_ I've heard that name before. Now, where was it?  Um--ah--eh?  Yes; I have it.  You're the handsome heartless fellow who played such havoc with my cousin Lady Mary's affections at the state ball last year.  Now, don't deny it; I'm positive I'm right.  Do you know,\" he continued, glaring at me in a most ferocious manner--\"do you know that for the last six months I've been looking for you in order that I might shoot you?\"  Somehow I did not feel very greatly alarmed at this belligerent speech, and vanity having by this time conquered my natural truthfulness, I determined to sustain my unexpected reputation as a lady-killer at all hazards.  I therefore drew myself up, and, assuming my sternest look, replied that I should be happy to give him the desired opportunity whenever he might choose.  Fitz-Johnes' ferocious glare continued for a moment or two; then his brow cleared, and, extending his hand, he grasped mine, shook the member violently, and exclaimed:  \"That was spoken like a gentleman and a brave man!  Give me your hand, Hawkesley.  I respect you, sir; I esteem you; and I forgive you all.  If there is one thing which touches me more than another, one thing which I _admire_ more than another, it is to see a man show a bold front in the face of deadly peril.  Ah! _now_ I can understand Lady Mary's infatuation.  Poor girl!  I pity her.  And I suppose that pretty girl who passed just now is another victim to your fascinating powers.  Ah, well! it's not to be wondered at, I'm sure.  Tomnoddy, do you remember, by the by--?\"  But Lord Tomnoddy was now standing with his back turned toward us, and his face buried in his pocket-handkerchief.  His head was bowed, his shoulders were heaving convulsively, and certain inarticulate sounds which escaped him showed that he was struggling to suppress some violent emotion.  Lord Fitz-Johnes regarded his companion fixedly for a moment, then linked his arm in mine, drew me aside, and whispered hastily:  \"Don't take any notice of him; he'll be all right again in a minute. It's only a little revulsion of feeling which has overcome him.  He's frightfully tender-hearted--far too much so for a sailor; he can't bear the sight of blood; and he knew that if I called you out I should choose him for my second; and--you twig, eh!\"  I thought I did, but was not quite sure, so I bowed again, which seemed quite as satisfactory as words to Fitz-Johnes, for he said, with his arm still linked in mine:  \"That's all right.  Now let's go and cement our friend ship over a bottle of wine at the `Blue Posts,' what do you say?\"  I intimated that the proposal was quite agreeable to me; and we accordingly wheeled about and directed our steps to the inn in question, which, in my time, was _the_ place of resort, _par excellence_, of all midshipmen.  Lord Tomnoddy now removed his handkerchief from his eyes; and, sure enough, he _had_ been weeping, for I detected him in the very act of drying his tears.  He must have possessed a truly wonderful command over his features, though, for I could not detect the faintest trace of that deep feeling which had overpowered him so shortly before; on the contrary, he laughed uproariously at a very feeble joke which I just then ventured to let off; and thereafter, until I parted with them both an hour later, was the merriest of the party.  We arrived in due course at the \"Blue Posts,\" and, walking into a private parlour, rang for the waiter.  On the appearance of that individual, Fitz-Johnes, with a truly lordly air, ordered in three bottles of port; sagely remarking that he made a point of never drinking less than a bottle himself; and as his friend Hawkesley was _known_ to have laid down the same rule, the third bottle was a necessity unless Lord Tomnoddy was to go without.  Lord Tomnoddy faintly protested against the ordering of so much wine; but Fitz-Johnes was firm in his determination, insisting that he should regard it as nothing short of a deliberate insult on Tomnoddy's part if that individual declined his hospitality.  After a considerable delay the wine and glasses made their appearance, the waiter setting them down, and then pausing respectfully by the table.  \"Thank you; that will do.  You need not wait,\" said Fitz-Johnes.  \"The money, if you please, sir,\" explained the waiter.  \"Oh, ah! yes, to be sure.  The money.\"  And Fitz-Johnes plunged his hand into his breeches pocket and withdrew therefrom the sum of twopence halfpenny, together with half a dozen buttons (assorted); a penknife minus its blades; the bowl of a clay tobacco pipe broken short off; three pieces of pipe-stem evidently originally belonging to the latter; and a small ball of sewing twine.  Carefully arranging the copper coins on the edge of the table he returned the remaining articles to their original place of deposit, and then plunged his hand into his other pocket, from which he produced-- nothing.  \"How much is it?\" he inquired, glancing at the waiter.  \"Fifteen shillings, if you please, sir,\" was the reply.  \"Lend me a sovereign, there's a good fellow; I've left my purse in my other pocket,\" he exclaimed to Lord Tomnoddy.  \"I would with pleasure, old fellow, if I had it.  But, unfortunately, I haven't a farthing about me.\"  Thereupon the waiter proceeded deliberately to gather up the glasses again, and was about to take them and the wine away, when I interposed with a proposal to pay.  \"No,\" said Fitz-Johnes fiercely; \"I won't hear of it; I'll perish at the stake first.  But if you really don't mind _lending_ me a sovereign until to-morrow--\"  I said I should be most happy; and forthwith produced the coin, which Fitz-Johnes, having received it, flung disdainfully down upon the table with the exclamation:  \"There, caitiff, is the lucre.  Now, avaunt! begone!  Thy bones are marrowless; and you have not a particle of speculation about you.\"  The waiter, quite unmoved, took up the sovereign, laid down the change-- which Fitz-Johnes promptly pocketed--and retired from the room, leaving us to discuss our wine in peace; which we did, I taking three glasses, and my companions disposing of the remainder.  Fitz-Johnes now became very communicative on the subject of his cousin Lady Mary; and finally the recollection came to him suddenly that she had sent him her "]]]
