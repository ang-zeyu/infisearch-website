They're sure to nab me at last, too, and then I shall have to go away whether I will or no, so I've made up my mind as a last resource, to--\" Ruby paused.  \"Well?\" said Minnie.  \"Well, in fact to do what will take me away for a short time, but--\" Ruby stopped short, and, turning his head on one side, while a look of fierce anger overspread his face, seemed to listen intently.  Minnie did not observe this action for a few seconds, but, wondering why he paused, she looked up, and in surprise exclaimed--\"Ruby! what do you--\"  \"Hush!  Minnie, and don't look round,\" said he in a low tone of intense anxiety, yet remaining immovably in the position which he had assumed on first sitting down by the girl's side, although the swelled veins of his neck and his flushed forehead told of a fierce conflict of feeling within.  \"It's the press-gang after me again.  I got a glance of one o' them out of the tail of my eye, creeping round the rocks.  They think I haven't seen them.  Darling Minnie--one kiss.  Take care of mother if I don't turn up soon.\"  \"But how will you escape?\"  \"Hush, dearest girl!  I want to have as much of you as I can before I go.  Don't be afraid.  They're honest British tars after all, and won't hurt _you_, Minnie.\"  Still seated at the girl's side, as if perfectly at his ease, yet speaking in quick earnest tones, and drawing her closely to him, Ruby waited until he heard a stealthy tread behind him.  Then he sprang up with the speed of thought, uttered a laugh of defiance as the sailors rushed towards him, and leaping wildly off the cliff, fell a height of about fifty feet into the sea.  Minnie uttered a scream of horror, and fell fainting into the arms of the bewildered lieutenant.  \"Down the cliffs--quick! he can't escape if you look alive.  Stay, one of you, and look after this girl.  She'll roll over the edge on recovering, perhaps.\"  It was easy to order the men down the cliffs, but not so easy for them to obey, for the rocks were almost perpendicular at the place, and descended sheer into the water.  \"Surround the spot,\" shouted the lieutenant.  \"Scatter yourselves--away! there's no beach here.\"  The lieutenant was right.  The men extended themselves along the top of the cliffs so as to prevent Ruby's escape, in the event of his trying to ascend them, and two sailors stationed themselves in ambush in the narrow pass at the spot where the cliffs terminate in the direction of the town.  The leap taken by Ruby was a bold one.  Few men could have ventured it; indeed, the youth himself would have hesitated had he not been driven almost to desperation.  But he was a practised swimmer and diver, and knew well the risk he ran.  He struck the water with tremendous force and sent up a great mass of foam, but he had entered it perpendicularly, feet foremost, and in a few seconds returned to the surface so close to the cliffs that they overhung him, and thus effectually concealed him from his pursuers.  Swimming cautiously along for a short distance close to the rocks, he came to the entrance of a cavern which was filled by the sea.  The inner end of this cave opened into a small hollow or hole among the cliffs, up the sides of which Ruby knew that he could climb, and thus reach the top unperceived, but, after gaining the summit, there still lay before him the difficulty of eluding those who watched there.  He felt, however, that nothing could be gained by delay, so he struck at once into the cave, swam to the inner end, and landed.  Wringing the water out of his clothes, he threw off his jacket and vest in order to be as unencumbered as possible, and then began to climb cautiously.  Just above the spot where Ruby ascended there chanced to be stationed a seaman named Dalls.  This man had lain down flat on his breast, with his head close to the edge of the cliff, so as to observe narrowly all that went on below, but, being a stout, lethargic man, he soon fell fast asleep!  It was just at the spot where this man lay that Ruby reached the summit.  The ascent was very difficult.  At each step the hunted youth had to reach his hand as high above his head as possible, and grasp the edge of a rock or a mass of turf with great care before venturing on another step.  Had one of these points of rock, or one of these tufts of grass, given way, he would infallibly have fallen down the precipice and been killed.  Accustomed to this style of climbing from infancy, however, he advanced without a sensation of fear.  On reaching the top he peeped over, and, seeing that no one was near, prepared for a rush.  There was a mass of brown turf on the bank above him.  He grasped it with all his force, and swung himself over the edge of the cliff.  In doing so he nearly scalped poor Dalls, whose hair was the \"turf\" which he had seized, and who, uttering a hideous yell, leaped upon Ruby and tried to overthrow him.  But Dalls had met his match.  He received a blow on the nose that all but felled him, and instantly after a blow on each eye, that raised a very constellation of stars in his brain, and laid him prone upon the grass.  His yell, however, and the noise of the scuffle, were heard by those of the press-gang who were nearest to the scene of conflict.  They rushed to the rescue, and reached the spot just as Ruby leaped over his prostrate foe and fled towards Arbroath.  They followed with a cheer, which warned the two men in ambush to be ready.  Ruby was lithe as a greyhound.  He left his pursuers far behind him, and dashed down the gorge leading from the cliffs to the low ground beyond.  Here he was met by the two sailors, and by the lieutenant, who had joined them.  Minnie was also there, having been conducted thither by the said lieutenant, who gallantly undertook to see her safe into the town, in order to prevent any risk of her being insulted by his men.  On hearing the shout of those who pursued Ruby, Minnie hurried away, intending to get free from the gang, not feeling that the lieutenant's protection was either desirable or necessary.  When Ruby reached the middle of the gorge, which we have dignified with the name of \"pass\", and saw three men ready to dispute his passage, he increased his speed.  When he was almost up to them he turned aside and sprang nimbly up the almost perpendicular wall of earth on his right. This act disconcerted the men, who had prepared to receive his charge and seize him, but Ruby jumped down on the shoulders of the one nearest, and crushed him to the ground with his weight.  His clenched fist caught the lieutenant between the eyes and stretched him on his back--the third man wisely drew aside to let this human thunderbolt pass by!  He did pass, and, as the impetuous and quite irresistible locomotive is brought to a sudden pause when the appropriate brakes are applied, so was he brought to a sudden halt by Minnie a hundred yards or so farther on.  \"Oh! don't stop,\" she cried eagerly, and hastily thrusting him away. \"They'll catch you!\"  Panting though he was, vehemently, Ruby could not restrain a laugh.  \"Catch me! no, darling; but don't be afraid of them.  They won't hurt you, Minnie, and they can't hurt me--except in the way of cutting short our interview.  Ha! here they come.  Goodbye, dearest; I'll see you soon again.\"  At that moment five or six of the men came rushing down the pass with a wild cheer.  Ruby made no haste to run.  He stood in an easy attitude beside Minnie; leisurely kissed her little hand, and gently smoothed down her golden hair.  Just as the foremost pursuer came within fifteen yards or so of them, he said, \"Farewell, my lassie, I leave you in good hands\"; and then, waving his cap in the air, with a cheer of more than half-jocular defiance, he turned and fled towards Arbroath as if one of the nor'-east gales, in its wildest fury, were sweeping him over the land.    CHAPTER THREE.  OUR HERO OBLIGED TO GO TO SEA.  When Ruby Brand reached the outskirts of Arbroath, he checked his speed and walked into his native town whistling gently, and with his hands in his pockets, as though he had just returned from an evening walk.  He directed his steps to one of the streets near the harbour, in which his mother's cottage was situated.  Mrs Brand was a delicate, little old woman--so little and so old that people sometimes wondered how it was possible that she could be the mother of such a stalwart son.  She was one of those kind, gentle, uncomplaining, and unselfish beings, who do not secure much popularity or admiration in this world, but who secure obedient children, also steadfast and loving friends.  Her favourite book was the Bible; her favourite hope in regard to earthly matters, that men should give up fighting and drinking, and live in peace; her favourite theory that the study of _truth_ was the object for which man was "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21747"],["title","The Lonely Island: The Refuge of the Mutineers (#1)"],["body"," like a little black speck on the glowing sky where the sun had just disappeared.  \"And how do you propose to escape _him_?\" said the midshipman, pointing significantly to the shark, which at the moment gave a wriggle with its tail as if it understood the allusion and enjoyed it.  \"I'll take my chance of that,\" said Christian, bitterly, and with a countenance so haggard yet so fierce that his young companion felt alarmed.  \"See here,\" he added, tearing open his vest and revealing within it a deep sea-lead suspended round his neck; \"I had rather die than live in the torments of the last three weeks.  If I fail to escape, you see, there will be no chance of taking me alive.\"  \"_Better try to take the ship_!\" whispered a voice behind him.  Christian started and grew paler, but did not turn his head to see who had spoken.  The midshipman at his side had evidently not heard the whisper.  \"I cannot help thinking you are wrong,\" said Stewart.  \"We have only to bear it a little longer, and then we shall have justice done to us in England.\"  Well would it have been for Fletcher Christian, and well for all on board the _Bounty_, if he had taken the advice of his young friend, but his spirit had been tried beyond its powers of endurance--at least so he thought--and his mind was made up.  What moral suasion failed to effect, however, the weather accomplished.  It prevented his first intention from being carried out.  While the shades of evening fell and deepened into a night of unusual magnificence, the profound calm continued, and the ship lay motionless on the sea.  The people, too, kept moving quietly about the deck, either induced thereto by the sweet influences around them, or by some indefinable impression that a storm sometimes succeeds a calm as well in the moral as the material world.  As the ship had no way through the water, it was impossible for the rash youth to carry out his plan either during the first or middle watches.  He was therefore compelled to give it up, at least for that night, and about half-past three in the morning he lay down to rest a few minutes, as he was to be called by Stewart to relieve the watch at four o'clock.  He had barely fallen into a troubled slumber when he was awakened by Stewart, and rose at once to go on deck.  He observed in passing that young Hayward, the mate of his watch, had lain down to take a nap on the arm-chest.  Mr Hallet, the other midshipman of the watch, had also gone to sleep somewhere, for he was not to be seen.  Whether the seriously reprehensible conduct of these two officers roused his already excited spirit to an ungovernable pitch, or their absence afforded a favourable opportunity, we cannot tell, but certain it is that Fletcher Christian opened his ear at that time to the voice of the tempter.  \"_Better try to take the ship_,\" seemed burning in words of fire into his brain.  Quick to act as well as to conceive, he looked lustily and earnestly at the men of his watch.  The one who stood nearest him, looking vacantly out upon the sea, was Matthew Quintal.  To him Christian revealed his hastily adopted plan of seizing the ship, and asked if he would join him.  Quintal was what men call a deep villain.  He was quite ripe for mutiny, but from some motive known only to himself he held back, and expressed doubt as to the possibility of carrying out the plan.  \"I did not expect to find cowardice in _you_,\" said Christian, with a look of scornful indignation.  \"It is not cowardice, sir,\" retorted Quintal.  \"I will join if others do.  Try some one else.  Try Martin there, for instance.\"  Isaac Martin was a raw-boned, sallow, six-foot man of about thirty, who had been undeservedly flogged by Bligh.  Christian went to him at once, and put the question, \"Will you join me in taking the ship?\"  \"The very thing, Mr Christian.  I'm with you,\" answered Martin, promptly.  The eager readiness of this man at once decided Quintal.  Christian then went to every man in his watch, all of whom had received more or less harsh treatment from the Captain, and most of whom were more than willing to join the conspirators.  Those who hesitated, whatever might have been their motives, had not sufficient regard for their commander to warn him of his danger.  Perhaps the very suddenness of the proposal, as well as fear of the mutineers, induced them to remain silent.  In passing along the deck Christian encountered a man named William Brown. He was assistant-botanist, or gardener, to the expedition, and having been very intimate with Christian, at once agreed to join him.  Although a slenderly made young man, Brown was full of vigour and resolution.  \"We must look sharp,\" said Christian to him, in that low eager whisper in which the conversation among the mutineers had hitherto been carried on.  \"It will soon be daylight.  You know the men as well as I do.  Go below and gain over those whom you feel sure of influencing.  Don't waste your time on the lukewarm or cowardly.  Away with you.  Here, Williams,\" he added, turning to another man who was already in the plot, \"go below and send up the gunner's mate, I want him; then call John Adams,--I feel sure that Reckless Jack will join; but do it softly.  No noise or excitement.\"  In a few seconds John Mills, the gunner's mate, a strongly-built middle-aged man, came on deck, and agreeing at once to join, was sent to fetch the keys of the arm-chest from the armourer, under pretence of getting out a musket to shoot a shark which was alongside.  Meanwhile John Williams went to the hammock of John Adams and roused him.  \"I don't half like it,\" said Adams, when he was sufficiently awake to understand the message of his mate.  \"It's all very true what you say, Williams; the ship _has_ been little better than a hell since we left Spithead, and Captain Bligh don't deserve much mercy, but mutiny is wrong any way you look at it, and I've got my doubts whether any circumstances can make it right.\"  The reasoning of Adams was good, but his doubts were cleared away, if not solved, by the abrupt entrance of Christian, who went to the arm-chest just opposite Adams's hammock and began to distribute arms to all the men who came for them.  Seeing this, and fearing to be left on the weaker side, Adams rose, armed himself with a cutlass, and went on deck.  The morning of the 28th of April was now beginning to dawn.  Before that the greater part of the ship's company had been gained over and armed; yet all this was done so quietly and with such firmness that the remainder of the crew were ignorant of what was going on.  No doubt a few who might have given the alarm were afraid to do so.  Among those who were asleep was one deserving of special notice, namely, Peter Heywood, a midshipman who was true as steel at heart, but whose extreme youth and inexperience, coupled with the surprise and alarm of being awakened to witness scenes of violence, produced a condition of inaction which resulted in his being left, and afterwards classed, with the mutineers.  Shortly after five o'clock the armed men streamed quietly up the fore-hatch and took possession of the deck.  Sentinels were placed below at the doors of the officers' berths, and above at the hatchways.  Then Fletcher Christian, John Adams, Matthew Quintal, William McCoy, Isaac Martin, and several others went aft, armed with muskets, bayonets, and cutlasses.  Leaving Martin in charge of the quarter-deck, they descended to Captain Bligh's cabin.  The commander of the _Bounty_, all ignorant of the coming storm which his ungentlemanly and cruel conduct had raised, was sleeping calmly in his berth.  He was roughly awakened and bidden to rise.  \"What is the reason of such violence?\" he demanded, addressing Christian, as they half forced him out of bed.  \"Silence, sir,\" said Christian, sternly; \"you know the reason well enough.  Tie his hands, lads.\"  Disregarding the order to be silent, Bligh shouted \"murder!\" at the top of his voice.  \"Hold your tongue, sir, else you're a dead man,\" said Christian, seizing him by the tied hands with a powerful grasp, and holding a bayonet to his breast.  Of course no one responded to the Captain's cry, the hatchways, etcetera, being guarded.  They gave him no time to dress, but hurried him on deck, where, amid much confusion and many abusive cries, preparations were being made for getting out a boat, for it was resolved to set Bligh and his friends adrift.  At first there was some disputing among the mutineers as to which boat should be given to them. Eventually the launch was decided on.  \"Hoist her out, bo's'n.  Do it smartly and instantly, or look-out for yourself.\"  The order was given sternly, for the boatswain was known to be friendly to Bligh.  He obeyed at once, with the assistance of willing men who were only too glad to get rid of their tyrannical commander.  \"Now, Mr Hayward and Mr Hallet, get into the boat,\" said Christian, who seemed to be torn with conflicting emotions.  His tone and look were sufficient for those young midshipmen.  They obeyed promptly.  Mr Samuel the clerk and several more of the crew were then ordered into the boat.  At this point Captain Bligh attempted to interfere.  He demanded the intentions of the mutineers, but was told to hold his tongue, with threats of instant death if he did not obey.  Particular persons were then called on to go into the boat, and some of these were allowed to collect twine, canvas, lines, sails, cordage, and other things to take with them.  They were also allowed an eight-and-twenty gallon cask of water, fifty pounds of bread, a small quantity of rum and wine, a quadrant, and a compass.  When all the men obnoxious to the mutineers were in the boat, Captain Bligh was ordered into it.  Isaac Martin had been placed as a guard over the Captain, and appeared to favour him, as he enabled him to moisten his parched lips with a shaddock.  For this he was removed, and Adams took his place.  Bligh looked round, but no friendly eye"]]]
