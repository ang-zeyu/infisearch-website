CHAPTER TWO.  The house on fire was, as we have said, an elegant mansion--one of those imposing edifices, with fresh paint outside, and splendid furniture within, which impress the beholder with the idea of a family in luxurious circumstances.  No one could tell how the fire originated.  In the daily \"report\" of fires, made next day by the chief of the Red Brigade, wherein nine fires were set down as having occurred within the twenty-four hours, the cause of this fire in Ladbroke Square was reported \"unknown.\"  Of the other eight, the supposed causes were, in one case, \"escape of gas,\" in another, \"paraffin-lamp upset,\" in another \"intoxication,\" in another, \"spark from fire,\" in another, \"candle,\" in another, \"children playing with matches,\" and so on; but in this mansion none of these causes were deemed probable.  The master of the house turned off the gas regularly every night before going to bed, therefore it could not have been caused by escape of gas.  Paraffin-lamps were not used in the house.  Candles were; but they were always carefully handled and guarded.  As to intoxication, the most suspicious of mortals could not have dreamed of such a cause in so highly respectable a family.  The fires were invariably put out at night, and guards put on in every room, therefore, no spark could have been so audacious as to have leaped into being and on to the floor.  There were, indeed, \"matches\" in the house, but there were no children, except one old lady, who, having reached her second childhood, might perhaps have been regarded as a child.  It is true there was a certain Betty, a housemaid, whose fingers were reported by the cook to be \"all thumbs,\" and who had an awkward and incurable tendency to spill, and break, and drop, and fall over things, on whom suspicion fastened very keenly at first; but Betty, who was young and rather pretty, asserted so earnestly that she had been unusually happy that night in having done nothing whatever of a condemnable nature, and backed her asseverations with such floods of tears, that she was exonerated, and, as we have said, the cause was reported \"unknown.\"  It was not, however, so completely unknown as was at first supposed. There was a certain grave, retiring, modest individual who knew the gentleman of the house and his doings a little more thoroughly than was agreeable to the said gentleman, and who had become aware, in some unaccountable way, which it is impossible to explain, that he, the said gentleman, had very recently furnished the house in a sumptuous style, and had insured it much beyond its value.  The said individual's knowledge ultimately resulted in the said gentleman being convicted and transported for arson!  But with all this we have nothing to do.  Whatever the uncertainty that afterwards arose as to the cause of the fire, there could be no uncertainty as to the fire itself at the time.  It blazed and roared so furiously, that the inside of the house resembled a white-hot furnace. Flames spouted from the windows and chimneys, glaring fiercely on the spectators, who assembled rapidly from all quarters, as if defying them all, and daring the firemen to do their worst.  Sparks enough to have shamed all the Roman candles ever made in or out of Rome were vomited forth continuously, and whirled away with volumes of dense black smoke into the wintry sky.  \"It's well alight,\" observed a chimney-sweep to a policeman.  The policeman made no reply, although it did seem as if it would have been quite safe, even for a policeman, to admit that the sweep was thoroughly correct.  It _was_ \"well alight,\" so well, that it seemed absolutely ridiculous to suppose that the firemen could make any impression on it at all.  But the firemen did not appear to think the attempt ridiculous.  \"Never give in\" was, or might have been, their motto.  It was their maxim to attack the enemy with promptitude and vigour, no matter what his strength might be.  When he crept out like a sneaking burglar from under a hearth-stone, or through an over-heated flue, they would \"have at him\" with the hand-pumps and quench him at once.  When he came forth like a dashing party of skirmishers, to devastate a wood-yard, or light up a music-hall with unusual brilliancy, they sent an engine or two against him without delay, and put him down in an hour or two.  When he attacked \"in force,\" they despatched engine after engine--manuals and steamers-- to the front, until he was quelled, and if the prey already seized could not be wrenched from his grasp, they, at all events, killed him before he could destroy more.  When he boldly and openly declared war, attacking the great combustible warehouses of Tooley Street, threatening a descent on the shipping, and almost setting the Thames on fire, they sent out the whole available army from every quarter of the metropolis with all their engines of war--manuals, steamers, and floating batteries, or spouteries, and fought him tooth and nail, till he gave in.  They might be terribly over-matched--as in the case of the great fire when the gallant Braidwood fell--they might lose men, and might have to fight day and night for weeks, but they would \"never say die,\" until the enemy had died and left them, tired and torn, but still tough and triumphant victors on the field of battle.  Before the engine from Regent Street came on the ground, two manual engines from Kensington and Notting Hill had arrived, and opened water on the foe.  At first their shot fell harmlessly on the roaring furnace; but by the time the \"steamer\" had got ready for action, some little effect was beginning to be produced.  When this great gun, so to speak, began to play, and sent a thick continuous stream through the windows, like an inexhaustible water mitrailleuse, clouds of white steam mingled with the black smoke, and varied the aspect of the fire, but did not appear to lessen its fury in any degree.  Just then another manual engine dashed into the square at full gallop, and formed up.  Before it had well taken a position, another \"steamer,\" with three horses, came swinging round the corner, and fell into the ranks.  The panting steeds were unharnessed, the bold charioteers leaped down, the suction-pipe was dipped into the water-trough, and the hose attached.  As two engines cannot \"drink\" at the same plug, a canvas trough with an iron frame is put over the plug, having a hole in its bottom, which fits tightly round the plug.  It quietly fills, and thus two or more engines may do their work convivially--dip in their suction-pipes, and \"drink\" simultaneously at the same fountain.  \"Down with her!\" shouted the man who held the \"branch,\" or nozzle, at the end of the hose.  A steam whistle gives a shrill, short reply; the engine quivers under the power of man's greatest servant, and another battery opens on the foe.  But London firemen are not content to play at long bowls.  While the artillery goes thus vigorously into action, the helmets of the men are seen gleaming and glancing everywhere amid the smoke, searching for weak points, turning the enemy's flanks, and taking him in rear.  Hose are dragged through neighbouring houses, trailing their black coils like horrid water snakes, through places were such things were never meant to be.  If too short, additional lengths are added, again and again, till the men who hold the branches gain points of vantage on adjoining roofs or outhouses, until, at last from below, above, in front, and behind, cataracts of water dash into the glowing furnace.  The fire-escape had been first to reach the ground after the alarm was given, this being the instrument nearest to the scene of conflagration. It happened that night to be in charge of David Clazie, a brother of Comrade Bob.  Being a smart young fellow, David, had--with the assistance of two early risers who chanced to be at hand, and the policeman on the beat--run up his escape, and put it in position before the fire had gained its full force.  The gentleman of the house had already got out, and fled in his night garments; but the fire had rendered the staircase impassable, so that the cook, the many-thumbed Betty, and the old lady, who was the gentleman's mother, were imprisoned in the upper floor.  David Clazie did not learn this from the gentleman, however.  That amiable character had received such a fright, that he had taken himself off, no one--except the individual aforementioned--knew whither. Fortunately, Betty announced the fact of her existence by rushing to a window and shrieking.  David ran his escape towards the window, mounted the ladder, carried the damsel down, bore her, kicking, into a neighbouring house, and left her in fits.  Meanwhile the cook rushed to the same window, shrieked, and fell back half-suffocated with the smoke which just then surrounded her.  A policeman gallantly ran up the escape, jumped into the room, gathered up the cook with great difficulty--for she was unusually fat and the smoke very suffocating-- carried her down, bore her to the same house where Betty lay, and left her there in violent hysterics.  As neither of them could answer questions, it could not be ascertained whether there were any more people in the burning house.  David therefore explored it as far as was possible in the circumstances, and much more than was safe for himself, but found no one.  After nearly choking himself, therefore, he drew aside the escape to prevent its being burned.  When the engines came up, however, it was again brought into play, to enable the firemen to get up with their \"branches\" to the upper windows.  \"Try that window, Dashwood,\" said the officer of the station to which Joe belonged, pointing to a window on the second floor.  \"There ain't much smoke coming out.\"  Before he had done speaking, Joe and a comrade had pushed the escape towards the window in question.  He ascended and leaped"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21696"],["title","Red Rooney: The Last of the Crew (#1)"],["body","bear-skin, which yet retained a little of its first owner's warmth, he wrapped the Kablunet in it from head to foot, leaving an opening in front of his mouth for breathing purposes.  With his knife--a stone one--he cut off a little lump of blubber from the seal, and placed that in the opening, so that the stranger might eat on reviving, if so inclined, or let it alone, if so disposed.  Then, turning his face towards the land, he scurried away over the ice like a hunted partridge, or a hairy ball driven before an Arctic breeze.  He made such good use of his short legs that in less than an hour he reached a little hut, which seemed to nestle under the wing of a great cliff in order to avoid destruction by the glittering walls of an impending glacier.  The hut had no proper doorway, but a tunnel-shaped entrance, about three feet high and several feet long.  Falling on his knees, the Eskimo crept into the tunnel and disappeared.  Gaining the inner end of it, he stood up and glared, speechless, at his astonished wife.  She had cause for surprise, for never since their wedding-day had Nuna beheld such an expression on the fat face of her amiable husband.  \"Okiok,\" she said, \"have you seen an evil spirit?\"  \"No,\" he replied.  \"Why, then, do you glare?\"  Of course Nuna spoke in choice Eskimo, which we render into English with as much fidelity to the native idiom as seems consistent with the agreeable narration of our tale.  \"Hoi!\" exclaimed Okiok, in reply to her question, but without ceasing to glare and breathe hard.  \"Has my husband become a walrus, that he can only shout and snort?\" inquired Nuna, with the slightest possible twinkle in her eyes, as she raised herself out of the lamp-smoke, and laid down the stick with which she had been stirring the contents of a stone pot.  Instead of answering the question, Okiok turned to two chubby and staring youths, of about fifteen and sixteen respectively, who were mending spears, and said sharply, \"Norrak, Ermigit, go, harness the dogs.\"  Norrak rose with a bound, and dived into the tunnel.  Ermigit, although willing enough, was not quite so sharp.  As he crawled into the tunnel and was disappearing, his father sent his foot in the same direction, and, having thus intimated the necessity for urgent haste, he turned again to his wife with a somewhat softened expression.  \"Give me food, Nuna.  Little food has passed into me since yesterday at sunrise.  I starve.  When I have eaten, you shall hear words that will make you dream for a moon.  I have seen,\"--he became solemn at this point, and lowered his voice to a whisper as he advanced his head and glared again--\"I have seen a--a--Kablunet!\"  He drew back and gazed at his wife as connoisseurs are wont to do when examining a picture.  And truly Nuna's countenance _was_ a picture-round, fat, comely, oily, also open-mouthed and eyed, with unbounded astonishment depicted thereon; for she thoroughly believed her husband, knowing that he was upright and never told lies.  Her mental condition did not, however, interfere with her duties.  A wooden slab or plate, laden with a mess of broiled meat, soon smoked before her lord.  He quickly seated himself on a raised platform, and had done some justice to it before Nuna recovered the use of her tongue.  \"A Kablunet!\" she exclaimed, almost solemnly.  \"Is he dead?\"  Okiok paused, with a lump of blubber in his fingers close to his mouth.  \"No; he is alive.  At least he was alive when I left him.  If he has not died since, he is alive still.\"  Having uttered this truism, he thrust the blubber well home, and continued his meal.  Nuna's curiosity, having been aroused, was not easily allayed.  She sat down beside her spouse, and plied him with numerous questions, to which Okiok gave her brief and very tantalising replies until he was gorged, when, throwing down the platter, he turned abruptly to his wife, and said impressively--  \"Open your ears, Nuna.  Okiok is no longer what he was.  He has been born only to-day.  He has at last seen with his two eyes--a Kablunet!\"  He paused to restrain his excitement.  His wife clasped her hands and looked at him excitedly, waiting for more.  \"This Kablunet,\" he continued, \"is very white, and not so ruddy as we have been told they are.  His hair is brown, and twists in little circles.  He wears it on the top of his head, and on the bottom of his head also--all round.  He is not small or short.  No; he is long and broad,--but he is thin, very thin, like the young ice at the beginning of winter.  His eyes are the colour of the summer sky.  His nose is like the eagle's beak, but not so long.  His mouth--I know not what his mouth is like; it is hid in a nest of hair.  His words I understand not.  They seem to me nonsense, but his voice is soft and deep.\"  \"And his dress--how does he dress?\" asked Nuna, with natural feminine curiosity.  \"Like ourselves,\" replied Okiok, with a touch of disappointment in his tone.  \"The men who said the Kablunets wear strange things on their heads and long flapping things on their legs told lies.\"  \"Why did you not bring him here?\" asked Nuna, after a few moments' meditation on these marvels.  \"Because he is too heavy to lift, and too weak to walk.  He has been starving.  I wrapped him in the skin of a bear, and left him with a piece of blubber at his nose.  When he wakes up he will smell; then he will eat.  Perhaps he will live; perhaps he will die.  Who can tell?  I go to fetch him.\"  As the Eskimo spoke, the yelping of dogs outside told that his sons had obeyed his commands, and got ready the sledge.  Without another word he crept out of the hut and jumped on the sledge, which was covered with two or three warm bearskins.  Ermigit restrained the dogs, of which there were about eight, each fastened to the vehicle by a single line. Norrak handed his father the short-handled but heavy, long-lashed whip.  Okiok looked at Norrak as he grasped the instrument of punishment.  \"Jump on,\" he said.  Norrak did so with evident good-will.  The whip flashed in the air with a serpentine swing, and went off like a pistol.  The dogs yelled in alarm, and, springing away at full speed, were soon lost among the hummocks of the Arctic sea.    CHAPTER TWO.  DESCRIBES A RESCUE AND A HAPPY FAMILY.  While the Eskimos were thus rushing to his rescue, poor Red Rooney-- whose shipmates, we may explain at once, had thus contracted his Christian name of Reginald--began to recover from his swoon, and to wonder in a listless fashion where he was.  Feeling comparatively comfortable in his bear-skin, he did not at first care to press the inquiry; but, as Okiok had anticipated, the peculiar smell near his nose tended to arouse him.  Drawing his hand gently up, he touched the object in front of his mouth.  It felt very like blubber, with which substance he was familiar.  Extending his tongue, he found that it also tasted like blubber.  To a starving man this was enough.  He pulled the end of the raw morsel into his mouth and began to chew.  Ah, reader, turn not up your refined nose!  When you have been for several months on short allowance, when you have scraped every shred of meat off the very last bones of your provisions, and sucked out the last drop of marrow, and then roasted and eaten your spare boots, you may perhaps be in a position to estimate and enjoy a morsel of raw blubber.  Regardless of time, place, and circumstance, our poor wanderer continued to chew until in his great weakness he fell into a sort of half slumber, and dreamed--dreamed of feasting on viands more delightful than the waking imagination of man has ever conceived.  From this state of bliss he was rudely awakened by a roughish poke in the back.  The poke was accompanied by a snuffing sound which caused the blood of the poor man to curdle.  Could it be a bear?  He was not left long in doubt.  After giving him another poke on the shoulder, the creature walked round him, snuffing as it went, and, on reaching the air-hole already referred to, thrust its snout in and snorted.  Rooney turned his face aside to avoid the blast, but otherwise lay quite still, knowing well that whatever animal his visitor might be, his only hope lay in absolute inaction.  Venturing in a few seconds to turn his face round and peep through the opening, he found that the animal was in very deed a large white bear, which, having found and abstracted the remains of the blubber he had been chewing, was at that moment licking its lips after swallowing it.  Of course, finding the morsel satisfactory, the bear returned to the hole for more.  It is easier to conceive than to describe the poor man's feelings at that moment, therefore we leave the reader to conceive them.  The natural and desperate tendency to spring up and defend himself had to be combated by the certain knowledge that, encased as he was, he could not spring up, and had nothing wherewith to defend himself except his fingers, which were no match for the claws of a Polar bear.  The blood which a moment before had begun apparently to curdle, now seemed turned into liquid fire; and when the snout again entered and touched his own, he could contain himself no longer, but gave vent to a yell, which caused the startled bear to draw sharply back in alarm. Probably it had never heard a yell through the medium of its nose before, and every one must know how strong is the influence of a new sensation.  For some minutes the monster stood in silent contemplation of the mysterious hole.  Rooney of course lay perfectly still.  The success of his involuntary explosion encouraged hope.  What the bear might have done next we cannot tell, for at that moment a shout was heard.  It was followed by what seemed a succession of pistol shots and the howling of dogs.  It was the arrival of Okiok on the scene with his sledge and team.  Never was an arrival more opportune.  The bear looked round with a distinct expression of indignation on his countenance.  Possibly the voice of"]]]
