Ten years ought to make a change, but I find that it doesn't. I'll be glad to feel the pavements beneath my shoes again.\"  \"Sure!\" said Rufus Shepley.  \"Confound the fog! Ah, there's a building I know! And there are a few I never saw before. We're beginning to get in, aren't we? Ought to dock before noon, don't you think?\"  \"Sure thing!\"  \"A hotel, a bath, fresh clothes--and then for hour after hour of walking around and taking in the sights!\" Prale said.  \"Better engage a taxi if you expect to take 'em all in before night, my boy,\" Shepley said.  \"I forgot! We haven't any too many taxis in Honduras. I had a car of my own, but sold it before I came away.\"  \"You let the busy auto agents know that, and you'll have a regiment of them----\"  \"And there!\" Sidney Prale cried. \"Now I know that I am home! There is the Old Girl in the Harbor!\"  Prale removed his cap, and a mist came into his eyes that did not come from the foggy billows through which the ship was plowing. The sun was shining through the murk at last, and it touched the Statue of Liberty. The great figure seemed like a live thing for a moment; the mist made it appear that her garments were waving in the breeze.  \"Now I know that I am home!\" Sidney Prale repeated.  \"She sure is a great old girl!\" Rufus Shepley agreed. \"Always glad to see her!\"  \"Well, I've got to get ready to land; I'm not going to waste any time,\" Prale said. \"I'm glad that I met you--and perhaps we'll meet again in the city.\"  \"Hope we do!\" said Shepley, grasping Prale's hand. \"Our factories are out in Ohio, but the company headquarters are in New York, of course. Here's my business card, my boy. And I generally put up at the Graymore.\"  Sidney Prale took the card, thanked Rufus Shepley, and hurried down the deck toward his stateroom, one of the best on the ship. Rufus Shepley looked after him sharply.  \"Went straight to Honduras and stayed there for ten years, eh?\" Rufus Shepley said to himself. \"Um! Looks bad! I never put much stock in those Honduras chaps--but this one seems to be all right. Never can tell, though!\"  Sidney Prale, still smiling, and humming a Spanish love song, reached his stateroom and threw open the door; and just inside, he came to a stop, astonished.  Somebody had been in that stateroom and had been going through his things. The contents of his suit case were spilled on the floor. A bag was wide open; he had left it closed and in a corner less than an hour before.  Prale went down on his knees and made a quick inspection. There did not seem to be anything missing. A package of papers--business documents for the greater part--had been examined, he could tell at a glance, but none had been taken.  \"Peculiar!\" Prale told himself. \"Some sneak thief, I suppose. No sense in complaining to the ship's officers at this late hour, especially since nothing has been stolen. Makes a man angry, though!\"  He put the suit case on the table and began repacking the things that had been scattered on the floor. Then he gathered up his toilet articles, bits of clothing he had left out until the last minute, a few souvenirs of Honduras he had been showing a tourist the evening before. He turned toward the berth to pick up his light overcoat.  There was a sheet of paper pinned to the pillow, paper that might have been taken from an ordinary writing tablet. Sidney Prale took it up and glanced at it. A few words of handwriting were upon the paper, words that looked as if they had been scrawled hurriedly with a pencil that needed sharpening badly.  \"Retribution is inevitable and comes when you least expect it.\"  The smile fled from Sidney Prale's lips, and the Spanish love song he had been humming died in his throat. He frowned, and read the message again.  \"Now what the deuce does this mean?\" he gasped.     CHAPTER II  THE GIRL ON THE SHIP   Sidney Prale folded the piece of paper carefully and slipped it into his wallet. Winning a fortune in ten years in a foreign country had taught Prale many things, notably that everything has its cause and effect, and that things that seem trifles may turn out to be of great importance later.  He finished his packing, locked the suit case, put on coat and hat and went out upon the deck. The _Manatee_ was docking. A throng was on the wharf. Prale glanced at the buildings in the distance and forgot for the time being the scrap of paper, because of his happiness at being home again and his eagerness to land. Returning to New York after an absence of so many years was in the nature of an adventure. There would be exploring trips to make, things to find, surprises at every turn and on every side.  The passengers were crowding forward now, preparing to go ashore. Sidney Prale picked up his suit case and started through the jostling crowd. Already those on board were calling greetings to relatives and friends on the wharf, and Prale's face grew solemn for a moment because there was nobody to welcome him.  \"Not a friend in the world,\" he had said to Rufus Shepley that morning.  \"A man with a million dollars has a million friends,\" Shepley had replied. \"The only trouble is, you can't enjoy that sort of friends except by getting rid of them, unless you happen to be a miser.\"  Well, that was something, Sidney Prale told himself now. He had ample funds, at least, and perhaps he could enjoy himself after ten years of battling with financial sharks, of inspecting and working mines, of cutting through dense forests and locating growths that could be turned into wealth.  Prale put his suit case against the rail to wait until he could move forward again. He looked down at the throng on the wharf, and up and down the rail at his fellow passengers. Then he saw the girl again!  He had seen her before. The first time had been at Tegucigalpa, at a ball given by some society people for charity. He had known her at once for an American, and finally had obtained an introduction. Her name was Kate Gilbert, and she lived in New York. It was understood that she was of a wealthy family and traveling for her health. She was accompanied only by a middle-aged maid, a giant of a woman who seemed to be maid and chaperon and general protector in one.  That night at Tegucigalpa, Prale had talked to her and had danced with her twice. He judged her to be about twenty-eight, some ten years younger than himself. She was small and charming, not one of the helpless butterfly sort, but a woman who gave indication that she could care for herself if necessary.  Prale had been surprised to find her aboard the _Manatee_, but she had told him that she was going home, that her health had been much benefited, and that she felt she could not remain away longer. It had seemed to Prale that she avoided him purposely, and that puzzled him a bit. He could not understand why any woman should absolutely dislike him. His record in Honduras was a clean one; it was known that he did not care much for women, and surely she had learned that he was a man of means, and did not think he might be a fortune hunter wishing to marry a prominent heiress.  He had not spoken to her half a dozen times during the voyage. She made the acquaintance of others aboard and, for the first few days, had been busy in their company. The last three days had been stormy ones, and Kate Gilbert had not been much in evidence. Prale judged that she was a poor sailor.  Now she stopped beside him, the middle-aged maid standing just behind her.  \"Well, we're home, Mr. Prale!\" she said.  \"I suppose that you are glad to get home?\"  \"Surely!\" she replied. \"And I'll be angry if there are not half a dozen to meet me when I land. I've been trying to spot some friends in that crowd, but it is a hopeless task.\"  \"I hope you'll not be disappointed,\" Prale said.  As he spoke, he glanced past her at the middle-aged maid, and surprised a peculiar expression on the face of the woman. She had been looking straight at him, and her lips were almost curled into a sneer, while her eyes were flashing with something akin to anger.  Prale did not understand that. Why should the dragon be incensed with him? He was making no attempt to lay siege to the heart of Miss Kate Gilbert. He was no fortune hunter after an heiress. The expression on the face of the maid amused Prale even while he wondered what it could mean.  \"Picked your hotel?\" Kate Gilbert was asking.  \"Not yet, but I hope to get in somewhere,\" Prale told her. \"May I be of assistance to you when we land?\"  \"Marie will help me, thanks--and there will be others on the wharf,\" she answered.  A cold look had come into her face again, and she turned half away from him and looked down at the crowd on the wharf. Sidney Prale looked straight at her, despite the glare of the middle-aged maid. Kate Gilbert was a woman who would appeal to a majority of men, but there seemed to be something peculiar about her, Prale told himself. He knew that she had avoided him purposely during the voyage, and that she had spoken to him purposely now, yet had asked nothing except whether he had chosen a hotel.  Why should Kate Gilbert wish to know where he was going to stop? Perhaps it had been only an idle question, he explained to himself. In her happiness at getting home, she had merely wished to speak to somebody, and none of her shipboard friends happened to be near.  He turned from her and glanced at the maid again. She was not the sort to be named Marie, Prale told himself. Marie called up a vision of a petite, trim woman from sunny France, and this Marie was nothing of the sort. She appeared more to be a peasant used to hard labor, Prale decided.  And he could not understand the expression on the woman's face as she looked at him. It was almost one of loathing.  \"Got me mixed up with somebody else, or somebody has been giving me a bad reputation,\" Prale mused. \"Enough to make a man shiver--that look of hers.\"  Kate Gilbert,"]]]
