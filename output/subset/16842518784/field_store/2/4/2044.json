I must, for the need of myself, live my own life, for work is for the worker, at the last. Each man must please himself, and Nature has placed her approbation on this by supplying the greatest pleasure men ever know as a reward for doing good work. I hate this fast-growing tendency to chain men to machines in big factories and deprive them of all joy in their efforts--the plan will lead to cheap men and cheap products. I set my face against it and plead for the dignity and health of the open air, and the olden time.\"  This sort of talk led straight to Wagner's arrest in the streets of Dresden on the charge of inciting a riot; and it was the identical line of argument that caused the arrest of Morris in Trafalgar Square, London, when he was taken struggling to the station-house.  Wagner was exiled and Morris merely \"cautioned,\" placed under police surveillance and ostracized. The difference in time explains the difference in punishment. A century earlier and both men would have forfeited their heads.  In all of Wagner's operas the scene is laid at a time when the festivals, games and religious ceremonies were touched with the thought of beauty. Men were strong, plain, blunt and honest. Affectation, finesse, pretense and veneer were unknown. Art had not resolved itself into the possession of a class of idlers and dilettantes who hired long-haired men and fussy girls in Greek gowns to make pretty things for them. All worked with their hands, through need, and when they made things they worked for utility and beauty. They gave things a beautiful form, because men and women worked together, and for each other. And wherever men and women work together we find Beauty. Men who live only with other men are never beautiful in their work, or speech, or lives, neither are women. But at this early time life was largely communal, natural, and Art was the possession of all, because all had a share in its production. Observe the setting of any Wagner opera where Walter Damrosch has his way and get that flavor of bold, free, wholesome, honest Beauty. And yet no stage was ever large enough to quite satisfy Wagner, and all the properties, if he had had his way, would have been works of Art, thought out in detail and materialized for the purpose by human hands.  Now turn to \"The Story of the Glittering Plain,\" \"Gertha's Lovers,\" \"News From Nowhere\" or \"The Hollow Land,\" by William Morris, and note the same stage-setting, the same majesty, dignity and sense of power. Observe the great underlying sense of joy in life, the gladness of mere existence. A serenity and peace pervades the work of both of these men; they are mystic, fond of folklore and legend; they live in the open, are deeply religious without knowing it, have nothing they wish to conceal, and are one with Nature in all her many moods and manifestations--sons of God!         *       *       *       *       *  In the history of letters there is a writer by the name of Green, who exists simply because he reviled a contemporary poet by the name of Shakespeare. Green's name is embalmed in immortal amber with that of Richard Quiney, who wrote a letter to the author of \"The Tempest\" begging the favor of a loan of forty pounds.  There are several ways of winning fame. Joseph Jefferson has written in classic style of Count Johannes and James Owen O'Connor, who played \"Hamlet\" to large and enthusiastic audiences, behind a wire screen; then there was John Doe, who fired the Alexandrian Library, and Richard Roe, the man who struck Billy Patterson. Besides these we have the Reverend Obadiah Simmons of Nashville, Tennessee, who, in Eighteen Hundred Sixty, produced a monograph proving that negroes had no souls, the value of which work, to be sure, is slightly vitiated when we remember that the same arguments were used, in Seventeen Hundred One, by Bishop Volberg, in showing that women were in a like predicament.  And now Henry T. Finck has compiled a list of more than one hundred names of musical critics who placed themselves on record in opposition to Richard Wagner and his music. Only such men as proved themselves past masters in density and adepts in abuse are given a place in this Academy of Immortals.  No writer, musician or artist who ever lived brought down on his head an equal amount of contumely and disparagement as did Richard Wagner. Turner, Millet and Rodin have been let off lightly compared with the fate that was Wagner's; and even the shrill outcry that was raised in Boston at sight of MacMonnies' Bacchante was a passing zephyr to the storm that broke over the head of Wagner in Paris, when, after one hundred sixteen rehearsals, \"Tannhauser\" was produced.  The derisive laughter, catcalls, shouts, hisses and uproar that greeted the play were only the shadow of the criticisms that filled the daily press, done by writers who mistook their own anserine limitations for inanity on the part of the composer. They scorned the melody they could not appreciate, like men who deny the sounds they can not hear; or those who might revile the colors they could not distinguish. And worse than all this, the aristocratic hoodlums refused to allow any one else to enjoy, and would not tolerate the thought that that which to them was \"jumbling discord, seven times confounded\" might be a succession of harmonies to one whose perceptions were more fully developed.  Wagner himself only escaped personal violence by discreetly keeping out of sight. The result of the Paris experiment was that the poor man lost nearly a year's time, all of his modest savings were gone, creditors dogged his footsteps, and the unanimous tone of the critics, for a time, almost made him doubt his own sanity. What if the critics were really right?  And this, we must remember, was in Eighteen Hundred Sixty-one, when Wagner was forty-eight years of age.  That even a strong man should doubt his value when he finds a world of learned men arrayed against him is not strange. Every man who works in a creative way craves approbation. Some one must approve. After the first fever of ecstasy there comes the reaction, when the pulse beats slow and the mind is filled with doubt and melancholy. This desire for approval is not a weakness--it seems to stand as a natural need of every human soul. When the great Peg Woffington played, you remember, she begged Sir Henry Vane to stand in the wings so as to meet her when she came off the stage, take her in his arms just for an instant, kiss her on the forehead and say, \"Well done!\"  Shallow people may smile at such a scene as this, but those who have delved in the realm of creative art know this fervent need of a word of encouragement from One who Understands.  The one man who held the mirror up to Nature for Wagner was Franz Liszt. Were it not for the steadfast love and faith of this noble soul, Wagner must surely have fallen by the way. Wagner worked first to please himself, and having pleased himself he knew it would please Franz Liszt, and having pleased Franz Liszt he knew it would please all those as great, noble, excellent and pure in heart as Franz Liszt. To speak to an audience made up of such as Liszt, and have them approve, was the sublime dream and hope of Richard Wagner.  Some of the enemies of Wagner, having placed themselves on record against the man, have sought to make out that Wagner and Liszt often quarreled, but this canard has now all been exploded. Such another friendship between two strong men I can not recall. That of Goethe and Schiller seems a mere acquaintanceship, and the friendship of Carlyle and Emerson a literary correspondence with an eye on posterity, as compared with this bond of brotherhood that existed between Wagner and Liszt.  During the ten years of Wagner's exile in Switzerland he received barely enough from his work in music to support him, and several times he would have been in sore need were it not for the \"loans\" made him by Liszt. He did not even own a piano, and never heard his scores played, except when Liszt made a semi-yearly visit. At such times a piano would be borrowed, and the friends would revel in the new scores, and occasionally talk the entire night away.  When Liszt would go home after such visits, Wagner would go off on long tramps, climbing the mountains, lonely and bereft, sure that the mood for high and splendid work would never come again. Then some morning the mist would roll away, the old spirit would come back, and he would apply himself with all the intense fire and burning imagination of which his spirit was capable.  When the score was done it was sent straight to Liszt, before the ink was dry.  The \"Lohengrin\" manuscript was sent along in parts, and Liszt was the first man to interpret it. On one such occasion we find Liszt writing: \"Your 'Walkure' has arrived--and gladly would I sing to you with a thousand voices your 'Lohengrin Chorus'--a wonder, a wonder! Dearest Richard, you are surely a divine man, and my highest joy is to follow you in your flight and be one with you in spirit!\"  On this occasion, when the \"Lohengrin Chorus\" first found voice, the only auditor was the Princess von Wittgenstein, who added a postscript to Liszt's letter, thus: \"I wept bitter tears over the scene between Siegmund and Sieglinde! This is beautiful--like heaven, like earth--like eternity!\" Was ever a woman so blest in privilege--to be the near, dear friend of Franz Liszt and hear him play the music of Richard Wagner from the manuscript, and then add her precious word of appreciation for the work of the weary exile! The quotation given is only a sample of the messages that Liszt was constantly sending to his exiled friend. And we must understand that at this time Liszt had a world-wide reputation as a composer himself, and was the foremost pianist of his time. And Wagner--Wagner was only an obscure dreamer, with a penchant for erratic music!  The \"Lohengrin\" was "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20320"],["title","Jack Harkaway's Boy Tinker Among The Turks (#1)"],["body","has been a good thirty years or so in the seraglio.\"  Mr. Figgins took the liveliest interest in this narrative.  He was growing rapidly convinced of the truth of Jack's descriptions of these singular manners and customs of the country in which they were.  Yet he eyed Jack as one who has a lingering doubt.  \"Ahem!\" said Mr. Figgins, \"I don't think that I shall join you on your visit ashore in the morning.\"  \"We'll see in the morning,\" said Jack; \"it's a pity to put off your trip for the sake of such a trifling danger as that of having a wife or so given to you.\"  \"It's no use,\" said Mr. Figgins, \"my mind is fully made up; I shall not visit the pasha.\"  \"It will be taken as a grave insult to go ashore without paying your respects to his excellency.\"  \"I can't help that,\" returned the orphan, resolutely; \"I won't visit him.\"  \"Mr. Figgins,\" said Jack, in a voice of deep solemnity, \"these Turks are cruel, vindictive, and revengeful. The last Englishman who refused was, by order of the pasha, skinned alive, placed on the sunny side of a wall, and blown to death by flies.\"  \"Surely the Turks are not such barbarians,\" said Mr. Figgins.  \"You'll find they are. They'd think no more of polishing you off than of killing a fly.\"  If that rascal Jack intended to make poor Mr. Figgins uneasy, he certainly succeeded very well.  Mr. Figgins looked supremely miserable.  \"Good night, Mr. Figgins. Think it over.\"  \"I tell you I----\"  \"Never mind, don't decide too rashly. Pleasant dreams.\"  \"Pleasant dreams,\" said the orphan. \"I shall have the nightmare.\"  The orphan's pillow was haunted that night by visions of a terrible nature.  He fancied himself in the presence of a turbaned Turk, a powerful pasha, who was sitting cross-legged on an ottoman, smoking a pipe, of endless length, and holding in his hand a drawn sword--a scimitar that looked ready to chop his head off.  Beside this terrible Turk stood five ladies, in baggy trousers, and long veils.  No words were spoken, but instinctively the orphan knew that he had to decide between the scimitar and the quintet of wives--wall-flowers of the pasha's harem.  Silently, in mute horror, the orphan was about to submit to the least of the two evils, and choose a wife.  Then he awoke suddenly.  What an immense relief it was to find it only a dream after all.  \"I don't quite believe that young Harkaway,\" said the orphan, dubiously; \"he is such a dreadful practical joker. But I won't go on shore, nevertheless. It's not very interesting to see these savages, after all; they really are nothing more than savages.\"  And after a long and tedious time spent in endeavouring to get to sleep again, he dropped off.  But only to dream again about getting very much married.                    *          *          *          *  He slept far into the morning, for his dreams had disturbed him much, and he was tired out.  When he awoke, there was someone knocking at his cabin door.  \"Come in.\"  \"It's only me, Mr. Figgins,\" said a familiar voice.  \"Come in, captain.\"  Captain Deering entered.  \"Not up yet, Mr. Figgins?\" he said, in surprise. \"We've got visitors aboard already.\"  \"Dear me.\"  \"Distinguished visitors. The pasha and his suite.\"  \"You don't say so?\" exclaimed the orphan, sitting up.  \"Fact, sir,\" returned the captain. \"It must be ten years since I last had the honour of an interview with his excellency.\"  \"You know him, then, Captain Deering?\"  \"Rather. Been here often. Know every inch of the country,\" said the captain.  \"What sort of a man is the pasha?\" said the orphan, thinking of Jack's statement.  \"Oh, a decent fellow enough, unless he's riled,\" was the reply.  \"Do you speak the language?\" said the orphan.  \"Like a native.\"  \"Is he as much married as they say?\" demanded Mr. Figgins.  The captain smiled.  \"His excellency has a weakness that way; but,\" he added, in a warning voice, \"you must not make any allusion to that.\"  \"I won't see him,\" said Mr. Figgins. \"I don't intend to visit him.\"  \"But I have come to fetch you to pay your respects.\"  \"Where?\"  \"Here, on board, in the state saloon.\"  \"But----\"  \"Make haste, Mr. Figgins,\" interrupted Captain Deering. \"It is no joke to make a pasha wait. Look alive. I'll come and fetch you in five minutes. Up you get.\"  And then Captain Deering departed.  Mr. Figgins was sorely perplexed now.  But he arose and began to dress himself as quickly as possible.  \"After all,\" he said to himself, \"it is just as well. I should certainly like to see the pasha, and this is a bit of luck, for there's no danger here at any rate, if what that young Harkaway said was true.\"  He went to the cabin door and shouted out for Tinker.  \"Tinker!\"  \"He's engaged,\" answered Captain Deering, who was close by.  \"I want him.\"  \"He's away, attending his excellency in the saloon,\" returned Captain Deering.  \"Bogey then.\"  \"Bogey's there too.\"  \"Never mind.\"  \"Are you nearly ready?\"  \"Yes\"  \"Look sharp. I wouldn't have his excellency put out of temper for the world; it would be sure to result in the bowstringing of a few of his poor devils of slaves when he got ashore again, and you wouldn't care to have that on your conscience.\"  Mr. Figgins very hurriedly completed his toilet.  \"What a fiend this wretched old bigamist must be,\" he said to himself. \"I'm precious glad that young Harkaway warned me, after all. I might have got into some trouble if I had gone ashore without knowing this.\"  \"Stop,\" said the captain. \"Have you any thing to take his excellency as a present?\"  This made the orphan feel somewhat nervous.  It tended to confirm what young Jack had said.  \"It is, then, the custom to make presents?\" he said.  \"Yes.\"  \"What shall I give?\"  \"Any thing. That's a very nice watch you wear.\"  \"Must I give that?\"  \"Yes. His excellency is sure to present you with a much richer one--that's Turkish etiquette.\"  This again corroborated Jack's words.  Yet it was a far more pleasant way of putting it than Jack had thought fit to do.  Mr. Figgins only objected to a present of wives.  Any thing rich in the way of jewellery was quite another matter.  \"On entering the presence, you have only to prostrate yourself three times; the third time you work it so that you just touch his excellency's toe with your lips.\"  \"I hope his excellency's boots will be clean.\"  \"His excellency would not insult you by letting you kiss his boot. No boot or stocking does he wear.\"  Mr. Figgins made an awfully wry face at this.  \"Ugh! I don't like the idea of kissing a naked toe.\"  \"You'll soon get used to it,\" said the captain, cheerfully, \"when you've kissed as many pashas' toes as I have. Hold your tongue--here we are.\"  He pushed open the saloon door and ushered Mr. Figgins into the presence of his excellency.     CHAPTER LXI.  MORE ABOUT CHIVEY AND HIS MASTER--THE FATAL PIT--IS IT THE END?--ARTFUL CHIVEY AND THE ARTFULLER NOTARY--DIAMOND CUT DIAMOND--HOW THE TIGER PREPARED TO SPRING--HERBERT MURRAY IN DANGER.   Before we proceed to describe the orphan's presentation to that arch polygamist, the Turkish pasha, and the remarkable result of that interview, we must look around and see if we are not neglecting any of the characters whose eventful careers we have undertaken to chronicle.  We are losing sight of one at least, who has a very decided claim upon our attention.  This person is none other than Herbert Murray.  The reader will not have forgotten under what circumstances we parted company with this unscrupulous son of an unscrupulous father.  Goaded to desperation by his villainous servant, Herbert Murray turned upon the traitor and hurled him down the gravel pit.  Then the assassin walked away from the scene.  But ere he had got far, his steps were arrested by the sound of a groan.  A groan that came from the gravel pit.  \"Was it my fancy?\"  No.  Surely not.  There it was again.  A low moan--a wail of anguish.  Back he went, muttering to himself--  \"Not dead?\"  He went round nearly to the bottom of the pit, and peered over.  There was Chivey leaning upon his elbow groaning with the severity of his bruises, and the dreadful shock he had received.  \"You've done for me, now,\" he moaned, as he caught sight of his master.  \"No; but I shall,\" retorted the assassin.  And he took a deliberate aim with the pistol.  \"I expected this,\" said Chivey, faintly; \"but remember murder is a hanging matter.\"  \"I shall escape,\" retorted Murray, coldly.  \"But you can't,\" said Chivey, with a grin of triumph, even as he groaned.  There was something in his manner which made Murray uneasy.  \"Twenty-four hours after I'm missing,\" gasped Chivey, \"your forgery will be in the hands of the police; they can get you back for forgery, and while you're in the dock of the Old Bailey, if not before, to stand your trial for forgery, they will have a clue to my murder.\"  His words caused Murray a singular thrill.  \"What do you mean by that, traitor?\" he demanded.  \"Mean? Why, I know you too well to trust you. I tell you I have taken every possible precaution,\" retorted Chivey, \"so that you are safe only while I live. I know my man too well not to take every precaution. Now,\" he added, sinking back exhausted, \"now, my young sweet and pleasant, fire away.\"  Murray paused, and concealed his pistol.  Was it true about these precautions?  Chivey was vindictive as he was cunning.  He had shown this in every action.  \"Supposing I spare you?\" said Murray.  \"You can't,\" retorted the tiger; \"I'm done for.\"  \"So much the better.\"  \"So you say now,\" returned Chivey, his voice growing fainter and fainter. \"Wait and remember my words--I'll be revenged.\"  He gasped for breath.  Then all was still.  Was he dead?  Murray trembled with fear at the thought.  The words of the revengeful tiger rang in his ear.  And he strode away.  Silent and moody as befits one bearing the brand of Cain.                    *          *          *          *  Chivey was far from being as badly hurt as he at first appeared.  He had no bones broken, his worst injuries"]]]
