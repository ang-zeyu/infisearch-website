The woods aren't afire, are they?\" And she lifted her nose and sniffed at the air. But she could find no trace of smoke.  Somehow Nimble began to feel ill at ease. He edged away from his mother and tried to hide behind Jimmy Rabbit. And that was a ridiculous thing to do; because Nimble was ever so much the bigger of the two.  Presently his mother gave him a sharp look. And then he, too, raised his muzzle and sniffed.  \"I don't smell any smoke,\" he stammered.  \"Do you know why there's such a crowd here?\" she asked him sternly.  \"I think,\" he said, \"they expect to go to the garden patch with us.\"  And his mother wondered, then, why she hadn't guessed the secret instantly.     VI  AN UNEXPECTED PARTY   Nimble's mother's plans went all awry. She had expected to give her son a treat by taking him quietly to Farmer Green's carrot patch, so that he might have his first taste of carrots. So it wasn't strange that it upset her a bit when she found that there were dozens of other forest folk all ready and waiting to go along with them. One extra member of the party wouldn't have displeased her, especially when that one was Jimmy Rabbit. But she had never gone near the farm buildings with more than two others. And she didn't intend to break her rule now.  Besides, it annoyed her above all to know that her son had spread the news of the excursion far and wide.  \"Did you _invite_ these people?\" she asked Nimble in a low voice.  \"No! Oh, no!\"  \"Then what brings them here?\" she demanded.  \"Their legs, I suppose,\" he replied.  \"Be careful!\" she said. \"Be very careful!\"  Then Nimble began to whine. And that was something he almost never did.  \"They said they'd like to come,\" he told his mother. \"And I said maybe you wouldn't mind.\"  \"Well, I do mind,\" she declared firmly. \"When I take a child to the carrot patch for the first time I don't want company. One of this crowd is more than likely to rouse old dog Spot. And we can't have him ranging around while we're dining.\"  \"Then tell everybody to go home!\" Nimble suggested. \"Tell them to go 'way!\"  \"No!\" said his mother. \"That wouldn't be polite.\"  She was silent for a few moments. And then she explained to Jimmy Rabbit and to the owners of the pairs of eyes that still stared at her out of the darkness. She explained that on account of an unexpected party she wasn't going to the carrot patch that night.  \"When are you going?\" asked the owner of one pair of specially bright eyes.  \"Ha!\" Nimble's mother exclaimed. \"Is that Cuffy Bear speaking?\"  \"Yessum!\" said the same voice.  \"I fear,\" she told him, \"I may not be able to go for a long time.\"  \"Never mind!\" Cuffy cried. \"I can go any night--that is, until I den up for the winter.\"  And every one in the company declared that he hadn't a single engagement that would prevent him from visiting the garden whenever Nimble's mother should say the word.  \"Well,\" said she, \"it won't be to-night, anyhow.\" And with that she turned around and began to walk along the runway again, away from the pasture fence.  As Nimble followed her Jimmy Rabbit skipped alongside him and whispered in his ear.  \"Don't fail to let me know when the time comes!\"  But Nimble said never a word. Somehow he suspected that he had made a great mistake.  He _knew_ he had, a little later.     VII  THE STRANGE LIGHT   Weeks went by; and still Nimble's mother said no more about visiting Farmer Green's carrot patch. Nimble himself did not dare to mention carrots now. It was his own fault that the excursion had been postponed. And much as he still wanted a taste of carrots the whole affair was something he didn't care to talk about.  Anyhow, it was lucky that he liked water lilies. For his mother took him to the lake behind Blue Mountain every night, almost. And there they splashed in the shallows and ate all they wanted.  Most of those nights were much alike. But there was one that Nimble remembered for many a day afterward.  It was not a dark night; neither was it a light one. It was a half-and-half sort of night. There was a moon. But it was far from full. And it was not high in the sky. The light from it came slanting down upon the lake, throwing the shadows of the trees far out upon the water.  Where those shadows reached out darkly Nimble and his mother stood with the water lapping their sleek bodies. And they were eating so busily that neither of them noticed a blurred shape that glided slowly nearer and nearer to them, without making the slightest sound.  All at once a shaft of dazzling light swept along the shore. Nimble was so surprised and puzzled that he stopped eating to stand still and gaze at it.  [Illustration: Never Had Nimble Run So Fast Before.                                           _Page_ 42]  But only for a moment! Instantly his mother flung her tail upward, so that the under side of it gleamed white even in the half light. And that--as Nimble knew right well--that was the danger signal.  Almost before Nimble knew what was happening his mother made for the shore. As she plunged through the water her tail, still aloft like a flag, twitched from side to side.  Nimble needed no urging to follow it. Soon they scrambled, dripping, out of the lake to dive headlong into the cover of the overhanging willows.  In those few seconds the light darted swiftly towards them. But it was not quite quick enough. Only the ripples told where they had been standing. Only the gently waving branches of the willows showed where Nimble and his mother had vanished.  A noise like a thunder-clap crashed upon Nimble's ears and rolled and tumbled in the distance, tossed from the mountain to the hills across the lake, and back again. It frightened Nimble much more than did the odd whistle that whined just above his head a moment before the thunder peal.  Never had he run so fast before. Never had his mother set such a pace for him. Usually, when startled, she stopped after going a short distance and looked back to try to get a glimpse of whoever or whatever had alarmed her. To be sure, she always stopped in a good place, like the edge of Cedar Swamp, where she could duck out of sight if need be.  But this time Nimble's mother ran on and on without pausing.  \"Haven't you forgotten something?\" her son gasped after a while.  \"Forgotten something? What do you mean?\" she asked.  \"Haven't you forgotten to stop?\" Nimble inquired.  A queer look came over her face.  \"I declare,\" she said, \"I do believe I'd Have run all night if you hadn't reminded me.\" She fell into a walk. And neither of them said another word until they reached the swamp, which was one of his mother's favorite hiding places. Then Nimble spoke again.  \"I waved my flag too,\" he said proudly.     VIII  MRS. DEER EXPLAINS   For the first time in his life Nimble felt quite grown up. He forgot that he had not yet lived a whole summer. He had made a suggestion to his mother which she had promptly acted upon. It had never happened before. And that was enough to cause him great pleasure.  Then there was something else that made Nimble believe himself to be a person of some account: A strange affair had happened at the lake. He had seen it all. He had taken part in it himself. Really it was no wonder that he began to talk quite importantly.  \"It was lucky I was with you,\" he remarked to his mother as they rested amid the tangle of Cedar Swamp.  \"It was lucky we weren't any further out in the lake,\" she exclaimed. \"If you hadn't been with me no doubt I'd have gone where the water was much deeper. And that light would have caught me before I could have reached the shore.\"  What his mother said made Nimble feel bigger than ever. He wasn't quite sure what had happened back there, where they had been surprised while eating water lilies. But he meant to find out, for he thought it would make a good story to tell his friends.  \"Would the moon have burnt us if it had hit us?\" he inquired.  \"What in the world are you talking about?\" his mother asked him.  He looked puzzled at her question.  \"Wasn't that the moon that lit up the lake along the shore?\" he demanded.  \"Certainly not!\" she replied.  \"Didn't the moon fall into the water?\" he asked.  \"No, indeed!\" his mother cried. She was astonished at his question.  Nimble was disappointed. He had thought he had a wonderful tale to tell. And he couldn't understand yet why everything wasn't as he had supposed.  \"I was sure the moon fell into the lake and blew up,\" he explained. \"What was that terrible noise we heard if it wasn't the moon bursting into pieces?\"  His mother didn't laugh. Instead she was quite solemn as she answered Nimble's last question.  \"That--\" she said--\"that was a gun that you heard. And the light that you saw came from a lantern in a boat.\"  It was very hard for Nimble to believe what she told him.  \"I thought I heard a piece of the moon whistle past my head,\" he went on.  \"A bullet!\" his mother declared. As she spoke she moved a little distance, to a spot where the trees were not so thick. And she raised her nose towards the sky. \"There!\" she said. \"There's the moon! It's still up there where you've always seen it.\"  Nimble looked; and at last he knew that his mother had made no mistake. But somehow he was more frightened than ever.  \"Then--\" he faltered--\"then there must have been men in the boat--men that turned the light upon the shore--and fired the gun!\"  \"They were men--yes!\" said his mother. \"And they were lawbreakers, too. I hope the game warden will catch them at their tricks.\"  \"What is a game warden?\" Nimble asked her.  \"He's a man,\" she answered. \"He's a man that looks after all of us forest folk and he's the best friend we've got.... Goodness, child! Are you never going to stop asking questions?\"     IX  A SPIKE HORN   Nimble didn't mind losing his spots, when he grew older. He had something else that gave him much more pleasure than they ever had. He had a new toy.

Her parents decided to settle in St. Petersburg, the capital of the Almighty Tsar, and there to embark in business.  It was here that a great change took place in the life of the young dreamer.  It was an eventful period--the year of 1882--in which Emma Goldman, then in her 13th year, arrived in St. Petersburg.  A struggle for life and death between the autocracy and the Russian intellectuals swept the country.  Alexander II had fallen the previous year. Sophia Perovskaia, Zheliabov, Grinevitzky, Rissakov, Kibalchitch, Michailov, the heroic executors of the death sentence upon the tyrant, had then entered the Walhalla of immortality.  Jessie Helfman, the only regicide whose life the government had reluctantly spared because of pregnancy, followed the unnumbered Russian martyrs to the etapes of Siberia.  It was the most heroic period in the great battle of emancipation, a battle for freedom such as the world had never witnessed before.  The names of the Nihilist martyrs were on all lips, and thousands were enthusiastic to follow their example. The whole INTELLIGENZIA of Russia was filled with the ILLEGAL spirit: revolutionary sentiments penetrated into every home, from mansion to hovel, impregnating the military, the CHINOVNIKS, factory workers, and peasants.  The atmosphere pierced the very casemates of the royal palace.  New ideas germinated in the youth.  The difference of sex was forgotten.  Shoulder to shoulder fought the men and the women.  The Russian woman!  Who shall ever do justice or adequately portray her heroism and self-sacrifice, her loyalty and devotion? Holy, Turgeniev calls her in his great prose poem, ON THE THRESHOLD.  It was inevitable that the young dreamer from Konigsberg should be drawn into the maelstrom.  To remain outside of the circle of free ideas meant a life of vegetation, of death.  One need not wonder at the youthful age.  Young enthusiasts were not then--and, fortunately, are not now--a rare phenomenon in Russia.  The study of the Russian language soon brought young Emma Goldman in touch with revolutionary students and new ideas.  The place of Marlitt was taken by Nekrassov and Tchernishevsky.  The quondam admirer of the good Queen Louise became a glowing enthusiast of liberty, resolving, like thousands of others, to devote her life to the emancipation of the people.  The struggle of generations now took place in the Goldman family. The parents could not comprehend what interest their daughter could find in the new ideas, which they themselves considered fantastic utopias.  They strove to persuade the young girl out of these chimeras, and daily repetition of soul-racking disputes was the result.  Only in one member of the family did the young idealist find understanding--in her elder sister, Helene, with whom she later emigrated to America, and whose love and sympathy have never failed her.  Even in the darkest hours of later persecution Emma Goldman always found a haven of refuge in the home of this loyal sister.  Emma Goldman finally resolved to achieve her independence.  She saw hundreds of men and women sacrificing brilliant careers to go V NAROD, to the people.  She followed their example.  She became a factory worker; at first employed as a corset maker, and later in the manufacture of gloves.  She was now 17 years of age and proud to earn her own living.  Had she remained in Russia, she would have probably sooner or later shared the fate of thousands buried in the snows of Siberia.  But a new chapter of life was to begin for her.  Sister Helene decided to emigrate to America, where another sister had already made her home.  Emma prevailed upon Helene to be allowed to join her, and together they departed for America, filled with the joyous hope of a great, free land, the glorious Republic.   America!  What magic word.  The yearning of the enslaved, the promised land of the oppressed, the goal of all longing for progress. Here man's ideals had found their fulfillment: no Tsar, no Cossack, no CHINOVNIK.  The Republic!  Glorious synonym of equality, freedom, brotherhood.  Thus thought the two girls as they travelled, in the year 1886, from New York to Rochester.  Soon, all too soon, disillusionment awaited them.  The ideal conception of America was punctured already at Castle Garden, and soon burst like a soap bubble.  Here Emma Goldman witnessed sights which reminded her of the terrible scenes of her childhood in Kurland.  The brutality and humiliation the future citizens of the great Republic were subjected to on board ship, were repeated at Castle Garden by the officials of the democracy in a more savage and aggravating manner.  And what bitter disappointment followed as the young idealist began to familiarize herself with the conditions in the new land!  Instead of one Tsar, she found scores of them; the Cossack was replaced by the policeman with the heavy club, and instead of the Russian CHINOVNIK there was the far more inhuman slave-driver of the factory.  Emma Goldman soon obtained work in the clothing establishment of the Garson Co.  The wages amounted to two and a half dollars a week.  At that time the factories were not provided with motor power, and the poor sewing girls had to drive the wheels by foot, from early morning till late at night.  A terribly exhausting toil it was, without a ray of light, the drudgery of the long day passed in complete silence--the Russian custom of friendly conversation at work was not permissible in the free country.  But the exploitation of the girls was not only economic; the poor wage workers were looked upon by their foremen and bosses as sexual commodities.  If a girl resented the advances of her \"superiors\", she would speedily find herself on the street as an undesirable element in the factory.  There was never a lack of willing victims: the supply always exceeded the demand.  The horrible conditions were made still more unbearable by the fearful dreariness of life in the small American city.  The Puritan spirit suppresses the slightest manifestation of joy; a deadly dullness beclouds the soul; no intellectual inspiration, no thought exchange between congenial spirits is possible.  Emma Goldman almost suffocated in this atmosphere.  She, above all others, longed for ideal surroundings, for friendship and understanding, for the companionship of kindred minds.  Mentally she still lived in Russia. Unfamiliar with the language and life of the country, she dwelt more in the past than in the present.  It was at this period that she met a young man who spoke Russian.  With great joy the acquaintance was cultivated.  At last a person with whom she could converse, one who could help her bridge the dullness of the narrow existence.  The friendship gradually ripened and finally culminated in marriage.  Emma Goldman, too, had to walk the sorrowful road of married life; she, too, had to learn from bitter experience that legal statutes signify dependence and self-effacement, especially for the woman. The marriage was no liberation from the Puritan dreariness of American life; indeed, it was rather aggravated by the loss of self-ownership.  The characters of the young people differed too widely.  A separation soon followed, and Emma Goldman went to New Haven, Conn.  There she found employment in a factory, and her husband disappeared from her horizon.  Two decades later she was fated to be unexpectedly reminded of him by the Federal authorities.  The revolutionists who were active in the Russian movement of the 80's were but little familiar with the social ideas then agitating Western Europe and America.  Their sole activity consisted in educating the people, their final goal the destruction of the autocracy.  Socialism and Anarchism were terms hardly known even by name.  Emma Goldman, too, was entirely unfamiliar with the significance of those ideals.  She arrived in America, as four years previously in Russia, at a period of great social and political unrest.  The working people were in revolt against the terrible labor conditions; the eight-hour movement of the Knights of Labor was at its height, and throughout the country echoed the din of sanguine strife between strikers and police.  The struggle culminated in the great strike against the Harvester Company of Chicago, the massacre of the strikers, and the judicial murder of the labor leaders, which followed upon the historic Haymarket bomb explosion.  The Anarchists stood the martyr test of blood baptism.  The apologists of capitalism vainly seek to justify the killing of Parsons, Spies, Lingg, Fischer, and Engel. Since the publication of Governor Altgeld's reason for his liberation of the three incarcerated Haymarket Anarchists, no doubt is left that a fivefold legal murder had been committed in Chicago, in 1887.  Very few have grasped the significance of the Chicago martyrdom; least of all the ruling classes.  By the destruction of a number of labor leaders they thought to stem the tide of a world-inspiring idea.  They failed to consider that from the blood of the martyrs grows the new seed, and that the frightful injustice will win new converts to the Cause.  The two most prominent representatives of the Anarchist idea in America, Voltairine de Cleyre and Emma Goldman--the one a native American, the other a Russian--have been converted, like numerous others, to the ideas of Anarchism by the judicial murder.  Two women who had not known each other before, and who had received a widely different education, were through that murder united in one idea.  Like most working men and women of America, Emma Goldman followed the Chicago trial with great anxiety and excitement.  She, too, could not believe that the leaders of the proletariat would be killed.  The 11th of November, 1887, taught her differently.  She realized that no mercy could be expected from the ruling class, that between the Tsarism of Russia and the plutocracy of America there was no difference save in"]]]
