Won't you shake hands?\"  Bob was silent.  \"Come, some, Bob!\" cried several of the bigger boys, \"don't be sulky, man; shake hands and be friends.  Martin has licked you this time, and you'll lick him next time, no doubt, and that's all about it.\"  \"Arrah, then, ye're out there, intirely.  Bob Croaker'll niver lick Martin Rattler though he wos to live to the age of the great M'Thuselah!\" said a deep-toned voice close to the spot where the fight had taken place.  All eyes were instantly turned in the direction whence it proceeded, and the boys now became aware, for the first time, that the combat had been witnessed by a sailor, who, with a smile of approval beaming on his good-humoured countenance, sat under the shade of a neighbouring tree smoking a pipe of that excessive shortness and blackness that seems to be peculiarly beloved by Irishmen in the humbler ranks of life.  The man was very, tall and broad-shouldered, and carried himself with a free-and-easy swagger, as he rose and approached the group of boys.  \"He'll niver bate ye, Martin, avic, as long as there's two timbers of ye houldin' togither.\"  The seaman patted Martin on the head as he spoke; and, turning to Bob Croaker, continued:  \"Ye ought to be proud, ye spalpeen, o' bein' wopped by sich a young hero as this.  Come here and shake hands with him: d'ye hear?  Troth an' it's besmearin' ye with too much honour that same.  There, that'll do.  Don't say ye're sorry now, for it's lies ye'd be tellin' if ye did.  Come along, Martin, an I'll convarse with ye as ye go home.  Ye'll be a man yet, as sure as my name is Barney O'Flannagan.\"  Martin took the white kitten in his arms and thrust its wet little body into his equally wet bosom, where the warmth began soon to exercise a soothing influence on the kitten's depressed spirits, so that, ere long, it began to purr.  He then walked with the sailor towards the village, with his face black and blue, and swelled, and covered with blood, while Bob Croaker and his companions returned to the school.  The distance to Martin's residence was not great, but it was sufficient to enable the voluble Irishman to recount a series of the most wonderful adventures and stories of foreign lands; that set Martin's heart on fire with desire to go to sea; a desire which was by no means new to him, and which recurred violently every time he paid a visit to the small sea-port of Bilton, which lay about five miles to the southward of his native village.  Moreover, Barney suggested that it was time Martin should be doing for himself (he was now ten years old), and said that if he would join his ship, he could get him a berth, for he was much in want of an active lad to help him with the coppers.  But Martin Rattler sighed deeply, and said that, although his heart was set upon going to sea, he did not see how it was to be managed, for his aunt would not let him go.  Before they separated, however, it was arranged that Martin should pay the sailor's ship a visit, when he would hear a good deal more about foreign lands; and that, in the meantime, he should make another attempt to induce Aunt Dorothy Grumbit to give her consent to his going to sea.    CHAPTER FOUR.  A LESSON TO ALL STOCKING-KNITTERS--MARTIN'S PROSPECTS BEGIN TO OPEN UP.  In the small sea-port of Bilton, before mentioned, there dwelt an old and wealthy merchant and ship-owner, who devoted a small portion of his time to business, and a very large portion of it to what is usually termed \"doing good.\"  This old gentleman was short, and stout, and rosy, and bald, and active, and sharp as a needle.  In the short time that Mr Arthur Jollyboy devoted to business, he accomplished as much as most men do in the course of a long day.  There was not a benevolent society in the town, of which Arthur Jollyboy, Esquire, of the Old Hulk (as he styled his cottage), was not a member, director, secretary, and treasurer, all in one, and all at once!  If it had been possible for man be ubiquitous, Mr Jollyboy would have been so naturally; or, if not naturally, he would have made himself so by force of will.  Yet he made no talk about it.  His step was quiet, though quick; and his voice was gentle, though rapid; and he was chiefly famous for _talking_ little and _doing_ much.  Some time after the opening of our tale, Mr Jollyboy had received information of Mrs Grumbit's stocking movement.  That same afternoon he put on his broad-brimmed white hat and, walking out to the village in which she lived, called upon the vicar, who was a particular and intimate friend of his.  Having ascertained from the vicar that Mrs Grumbit would not accept of charity, he said abruptly,--\"And why not--is she too proud?\"  \"By no means,\" replied the vicar.  \"She says that she would think shame to take money from friends as long as she can work, because every penny that she would thus get would be so much less to go to the helpless poor; of whom, she says, with much truth, there are enough and to spare. And I quite agree with her as regards her principle; but it does not apply fully to her, for she cannot work so as to procure a sufficient livelihood without injury to her health.\"  \"Is she clever?\" inquired Mr Jollyboy.  \"Why, no, not particularly.  In fact, she does not often exert her reasoning faculties, except in the common-place matters of ordinary and every-day routine.\"  \"Then she's cleverer than most people,\" said Mr Jollyboy, shortly.  \"Is she obstinate?\"  \"No, not in the least,\" returned the vicar with a puzzled smile.  \"Ah, well, good-bye, good-bye; that's all I want to know.\"  Mr Jollyboy rose, and, hurrying through the village, tapped at the cottage door, and was soon closeted with Mrs Dorothy Grumbit.  In the course of half an hour, Mr Jollyboy drew from Mrs Grumbit as much about her private affairs as he could, without appearing rude.  But he found the old lady very close and sensitive on that point.  Not so, however, when he got her upon the subject of her nephew.  She had enough, and more than enough, to say about him.  It is true she began by remarking, sadly, that he was a very bad boy; but, as she continued to talk about him, she somehow or other gave her visitor the impression that he was a very _good_ boy!  They had a wonderfully long and confidential talk about Martin, during which Mr Jollyboy struck Mrs Grumbit nearly dumb with horror by stating positively what he would do for the boy,--he would send him to sea!  Then, seeing that he had hit the wrongest possible nail on the head, he said that he would make the lad a clerk in his office, where he would be sure to rise to a place of trust; whereat Mrs Grumbit danced, if we may so speak, into herself for joy.  \"And now, ma'am, about these stockings.  I want two thousand pairs as soon as I can get them!\"  \"Sir?\" said Mrs Grumbit.  \"Of course, not for my own use, ma'am; nor for the use of my family, for I have no family; and if I had, that would be an unnecessarily large supply.  The fact is, Mrs Grumbit, I am a merchant and I send very large supplies of home-made articles to foreign lands, and two thousand pairs of socks are a mere driblet.  Of course I do not expect you to make them all for me, but I wish you to make as many pairs as you can.\"  \"I shall be very happy--\" began Mrs Grumbit.  \"But, Mrs Grumbit, there is a peculiar formation which I require in my socks that will give you extra trouble, I fear; but I must have it, whatever the additional expense may be.  What is your charge for the pair you are now making?\"  \"Three shillings,\" said Mrs Grumbit.  \"Ah! very good.  Now, take up the wires if you please, ma'am, and do what I tell you.  Now, drop that stitch,--good; and take up this one,-- capital; and pull this one across that way,--so; and that one across this way,--exactly.  Now, what is the result?\"  The result was a complicated knot; and Mrs Grumbit, after staring a few seconds at the old gentleman in surprise, said so, and begged to know what use it was of.  \"Oh, never mind, never mind.  We merchants have strange fancies, and foreigners have curious tastes now and then.  Please to make all my socks with a hitch like that in them all round, just above the ankle. It will form an ornamental ring.  I'm sorry to put you to the trouble, but of course I pay extra for fancy-work.  Will six shillings a-pair do for these?\"  \"My dear sir,\" said Mrs Grumbit, \"it is no additional--\"  \"Well, well, never mind,\" said Mr Jollyboy.  \"Two thousand pairs, remember, as soon as possible,--close knitted, plain stitch, rather coarse worsted; and don't forget the hitch, Mrs Grumbit, don't forget the hitch.\"  Ah! reader, there are many Mrs Grumbits in this world, requiring _hitches_ to be made in their stockings!  At this moment the door burst open.  Mrs Dorothy Grumbit uttered a piercing scream, Mr Jollyboy dropped his spectacles and sat down on his hat and Martin Rattler stood before them with the white kitten in his arms.  For a few seconds there was a dead silence, while an expression of puzzled disappointment passed over Mr Jollyboy's ruddy countenance.  At last he said--  \"Is this, madam, the nephew who, you told me a little ago, is not addicted to fighting?\"  \"Yes,\" answered the old lady faintly, and covering her eyes with her hands, \"that is Martin.\"  \"If my aunt told you that, sir, she told you the truth,\" said Martin, setting down the blood-stained white kitten, which forthwith began to stretch its limbs and lick itself dry.  \"I don't ever fight if I can help it but I couldn't help it to-day.\"  With a great deal of energy, and a revival of much of his former indignation, when he spoke of the kitten's sufferings, Martin recounted all the circumstances of the fight; during the recital of which Mrs Dorothy Grumbit took his hand in hers and patted it, gazing the while into his swelled visage, and weeping plentifully, but very silently. When he had"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21751"],["title","The Middy and the Moors: An Algerine Story (#1)"],["body","vessel.  He could not but feel, however, that the chances of this latter event occurring were small indeed, for a passing ship or boat would not only be going at great speed, but would be very unlikely to see his cockle-shell in the darkness, or to hear his cry in the roaring gale. Still he grasped that hope as the drowning man is said to clutch at a straw.  And the hope was quickly fulfilled, for scarcely had another half-hour elapsed when he observed a sail--the high-peaked sail peculiar to some Mediterranean craft--rise, ghost-like, out of the driving foam and spray.  The vessel was making almost straight for him; he knew that it would pass before there could be time to heave a rope.  At the risk of being run down he rowed the punt in front of it, as if courting destruction, but at the same time guided his little craft so skilfully that it passed close to leeward, where the vessel's bulwarks were dipping into the water.  Our middy's aim was so exact that the vessel only grazed the boat as it flew past.  In that moment young Foster sprang with the agility of a cat, capsized the boat with the impulse, caught the bulwarks and rigging of the vessel, and in another moment stood panting on her deck.  \"Hallo!  Neptune, what do _you_ want here?\" cried a gruff voice at Foster's elbows.  At the same time a powerful hand grasped his throat, and a lantern was thrust in his face.  \"Let go, and I will tell you,\" gasped the youth, restraining his indignation at such unnecessary violence.  The grasp tightened, however, instead of relaxing.  \"Speak out, baby-face,\" roared the voice, referring, in the latter expression, no doubt, to our hero's juvenility.  Instead of speaking out, George Foster hit out, and the voice with the lantern went down into the lee scuppers!  Then, the glare of the lantern being removed from his eyes, George saw, by the light of the binnacle lamp, that his adversary, a savage-looking Turk--at least in dress--was gathering himself up for a rush, and that the steersman, a huge negro, was grinning from ear to ear.  \"Go below!\" said a deep stern voice in the Arabic tongue.  The effect of this order was to cause the Turk with the broken lantern to change his mind, and retire with humility, while it solemnised the negro steersman's face almost miraculously.  The speaker was the captain of the vessel; a man of grave demeanour, herculean mould, and clothed in picturesque Eastern costume.  Turning with quiet politeness to Foster, he asked him in broken French how he had come on board.  The youth explained in French quite as much broken as that of his interrogator.  \"D'you speak English?\" he added.  To this the captain replied in English, still more shattered than his French, that he could, \"a ver' leetil,\" but that as he, (the youth), was a prisoner, there would be no occasion for speech at all, the proper attitude of a prisoner being that of absolute silence and obedience to orders.  \"A prisoner!\" ejaculated Foster, on recovering from the first shock of surprise.  \"Do you know that I am an officer in the Navy of his Majesty the King of Great Britain?\"  A gleam of satisfaction lighted up the swarthy features of the Turk for a moment as he replied--  \"Ver goot.  Ransum all de more greater.\"  As he spoke, a call from the look-out at the bow of the vessel induced him to hurry forward.  At the same instant a slight hissing sound caused Foster to turn to the steersman, whose black face was alive with intelligence, while an indescribable hitch up of his chin seemed to beckon the youth to approach with caution.  Foster perceived at once that the man wished his communication, whatever it was, to be unobserved by any one; he therefore moved towards him as if merely to glance at the compass.  \"Massa,\" said the negro, without looking at Foster or changing a muscle of his now stolid visage, \"you's in a dreffle fix.  Dis yer am a pirit. But _I's_ not a pirit, bress you!  I's wuss nor dat: I's a awrful hyperkrite! an' I wants to give you good adwice.  Wotiver you doos, _don't resist_.  You'll on'y git whacked if you do.\"  \"Thank you, Sambo.  But what if I do resist in spite of being whacked?\"  \"Den you bery soon change your mind, das all.  Moreober, my name's not Sambo.  It am Peter de Great.\"  As he said so Peter the Great drew himself up to his full height, and he drew himself up to six feet four when he did that!  The captain coming aft at that moment put an abrupt end to the conversation.  Two powerful Moorish seamen accompanied him.  These, without uttering a word, seized Foster by the arms.  In the strength of his indignation our middy was on the point of commencing a tremendous struggle, when Peter the Great's \"_don't resist_,\" and the emphasis with which it had been spoken, came to mind, and he suddenly gave in.  His hands were tied behind his back, and he was led down into a small, dimly-lighted cabin, where, being permitted to sit down on a locker, he was left to his own reflections.  These were by no means agreeable, as may well be supposed, for he now knew that he had fallen into the hands of those pests, the Algerine pirates, who at that time infested the Mediterranean.  With the thoughtlessness of youth Foster had never troubled his mind much about the piratical city of Algiers.  Of course he knew that it was a stronghold on the northern coast of Africa, inhabited by Moorish rascals, who, taking advantage of their position, issued from their port and pounced upon the merchantmen that entered the Mediterranean, confiscating their cargoes and enslaving their crews and passengers, or holding them to ransom.  He also knew, or had heard, that some of the great maritime powers paid subsidies to the Dey of Algiers to allow the vessels of their respective nations to come and go unmolested, but he could scarcely credit the latter fact.  It seemed to him, as indeed it was, preposterous.  \"For,\" said he to the brother middy who had given him the information, \"would not the nations whom the Dey had the impudence to tax join their fleets together, pay him an afternoon visit one fine day, and blow him and his Moors and Turks and city into a heap of rubbish?\"  What the middy replied we have now no means of knowing, but certain it is that his information was correct, for some of the principal nations did, at that time, submit to the degradation of this tax, and they did _not_ unite their fleets for the extinction of the pirates.  Poor George Foster now began to find out that the terrible truths which he had refused to believe were indeed great realities, and had now begun to affect himself.  He experienced an awful sinking of the heart when it occurred to him that no one would ever know anything about his fate, for the little boat would be sure to be found bottom up, sooner or later, and it would of course be assumed that he had been drowned.  Shall it be said that the young midshipman was weak, or wanting in courage, because he bowed his head and wept when the full force of his condition came home to him?  Nay, verily, for there was far more of grief for the prolonged agony that was in store for his mother and sister than for the fate that awaited himself.  He prayed as well as wept.  \"God help me--and them!\" he exclaimed aloud.  The prayer was brief but sincere,--perhaps the more sincere because so brief.  At all events it was that acknowledgment of utter helplessness which secures the help of the Almighty Arm.  Growing weary at last, he stretched himself on the locker, and, with the facility of robust health, fell into a sound sleep.  Youth, strength, and health are not easily incommoded by wet garments!  Besides, the weather was unusually warm at the time.  How long he slept he could not tell, but the sun was high when he awoke, and his clothes were quite dry.  Other signs there were that he had slept long, such as the steadiness of the breeze and the more regular motion of the vessel, which showed that the gale was over and the sea going down.  There was also a powerful sensation in what he styled his \"bread-basket\"--though it might, with equal truth, have been called his meat-and-vegetable basket--which told him more eloquently than anything else of the lapse of time.  Rising from his hard couch, and endeavouring to relieve the aching of the bound arms by change of position, he observed that the cabin hatch was open, and that nothing prevented his going on deck, if so disposed. Accordingly, he ascended, though with some difficulty, owing to his not having been trained to climb a ladder in a rough sea without the use of his hands.  A Moor, he observed, had taken his friend Peter the Great's place at the tiller, and the captain stood near the stern observing a passing vessel. A stiffish but steady breeze carried them swiftly over the waves, which, we might say, laughingly reflected the bright sunshine and the deep-blue sky.  Several vessels of different rigs and nationalities were sailing in various directions, both near and far away.  Going straight to the captain with an air of good-humoured _sang froid_ which was peculiar to him, Foster said--  \"Captain, don't you think I've had these bits of rope-yarn on my wrists long enough?  I'm not used, you see, to walking the deck without the use of my hands; and a heavy lurch, as like as not, would send me slap into the lee scuppers--sailor though I be.  Besides, I won't jump overboard without leave, you may rely upon that.  Neither will I attempt, single-handed, to fight your whole crew, so you needn't be afraid.\"  The stern Moor evidently understood part of this speech, and he was so tickled with the last remark that his habitual gravity gave place to the faintest flicker of a smile, while a twinkle gleamed for a moment in his eye.  Only for a moment, however.  Pointing over the side, he bade his prisoner \"look.\"  Foster looked, and beheld in the far distance a three-masted vessel that seemed to bear a strong resemblance to a British man-of-war.  \"You promise,\" said"]]]
