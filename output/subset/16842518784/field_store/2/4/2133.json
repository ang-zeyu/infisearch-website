Already the Beacon Hill house had become a real home, and Uncle Bob dearer each moment she stayed in it.  \"You know, Uncle Bob, you would be really perfect if only you liked dolls and could tie hair ribbons,\" said Jean teasingly.  Uncle Bob shook his head ruefully.  \"I never could care for sawdust people,\" said he, \"when there were so many interesting real ones in the world. As for the hair ribbons, perhaps I might learn to tie those in time, although I doubt if I ever could make as perky a bow as Hannah does. I like the _perk_ but I haven't the faintest idea how to get it.\"  Jean laughed.  She and her uncle had many a joke together.  \"He is better at a joke than Uncle Tom is,\" confided Jean to Hannah.  In fact Uncle Bob joked so much that it was hard to tell when he was serious, and so one day when he came into the library where Jean was and swept all the dolls on the couch over into the corner, laughingly demanding how Jean would like to go to Europe, she paid no attention to him.  \"Seems to me you are not a very enthusiastic or grateful young woman,\" said he at last tweaking a curl that hung low on her cheek. \"Here I am inviting you to tour the world with me and all you say is: 'I'll think about it!' How's that for gratitude?\"  \"If you had any intention of taking me I might be more grateful,\" Jean answered, fastening the gown of the doll she was dressing, and holding her at arm's length to enjoy the effect.  \"But I am entirely serious, my young friend; I never was more so. I am imploring you to go to Italy, for go I must, and I have no mind to leave you behind.\"  \"To Italy? To real Italy, Uncle Bob? Do you mean it?\"  \"I surely do, dear child. Behold me, solemn as an owl. Ah, now you begin to listen. It would serve you right if I should refuse to take such an ungrateful lady. What say you? Should you like to go?\"  \"Like it! I'd love it! I've never been on an ocean trip in all my life.\"  \"You may not care to go on another after you've been on this one,\" chuckled Uncle Bob. \"However, the fact remains that we are going. I have charge of decorating a very beautiful house in the suburbs and I am going over to Florence to order some marble stairways and fireplaces. That is my excuse. Incidentally we can make a pleasant trip out of it and see many places besides Italy.\"  \"Could we go to Venice?\" burst out Jean. \"Venice is in Italy, isn't it? I'd like of all places to see Venice with its water streets and its gondolas.\"  \"Yes, honey, you certainly shall see Venice and ride in all the gondolas you like.\"  \"Splendid!\" cried Jean, clapping her hands. \"When can we start? Let's go right away,\" and springing up from the couch she whirled toward the door.  \"Slowly, slowly!\" protested Uncle Bob. \"Come back here to me a moment, you flyaway. Many things must be decided before we sail for Italy. In the first place there is Hannah; what shall we do with her?\"  \"Oh, Hannah must come along with us,\" Jean answered. \"She'll have to. We never could think of going to Europe and leaving good old Hannah, who is so kind to both of us, now could we? Besides, she has to fix my hair every morning, and mend my clothes. I'd be coming to pieces all over Europe if Hannah didn't go.\"  \"Well, then, that settles it. Hannah goes. I never could consent to escort a young lady who might drop to pieces at any moment and strew her belongings all along the route from Italy to Scotland. Now about Esther, the waitress. She wants to go West and visit her brother; this will be just the chance. Suppose we tie a long string to her and let her go. Then we come to Beacon.\"  \"Beacon would go with us, of course,\" Jean replied quickly. \"You may be sure I'd never leave Beacon at home. I'd rather not go myself.\"  \"But, girlie, we couldn't very well----\"  \"Why, Uncle Bob! You don't mean to say you thought of leaving Beacon! If you did I simply sha'n't go. That's all there is about it. I shall never, never be parted from Beacon--never!\"  \"Listen, dear. Beacon wouldn't enjoy going. We could not get for him the food to which he is accustomed, nor would they admit him to the picture galleries which we shall visit. I doubt if he would even care for the gondolas.\"  \"No, I'm sure he would not like the gondolas,\" admitted Jean smiling faintly, \"because Hannah and I tried him on the swan-boats in the Public Garden and he hated them; he just barked and snarled all the time, and wriggled about so in my arms that he nearly went overboard and carried me with him.\"  \"That's just it! That is precisely the way he would feel on shipboard. Now my plan is this. We'll send him out to Pittsburgh for Uncle Tom to take care of until you get back. Then when you go out there in October your doggie will be nicely settled in his other home and waiting for you. In fact,\" confessed Uncle Bob a little sheepishly, \"I wrote Uncle Tom and asked how he would feel about adding a puppy to his household. This is his answer:      \"'_European plan excellent. Send Beacon. Next best thing to     Jean._'\"  \"Dear Uncle Tom! He is awfully good, isn't he?\"  \"Yes, he is. I fancy he will decide so, too, when he finds all his sofa cushions torn, and his shoes chewed up,\" chuckled Uncle Bob. \"Let him take his turn at it.\"  Beacon provided for, the remainder of the European plan seemed simple enough. To be sure there was Hannah, who at first flatly refused to be separated from the golden dome of the State House or from the Boston \"Evening Transcript.\" At last, however, after much persuasion she consented to suffer these deprivations for the common good, and brought herself to purchasing the necessary clothing for Jean and herself. To these she added French, German and Italian dictionaries because, as she explained: \"We might get lost or parted from your Uncle Bob somehow, and you never can tell what will happen in those heathen countries where the poor people cannot speak English. How men and women can live in places where they talk those dreadful languages and use that queer money when they might come over here to Boston----\"  \"That's right, Hannah,\" agreed Uncle Bob, playfully urging her on.  \"And all that strange weather! Why, I read only the other day that in Italy they just have summer all the year round. So foolish! They never get any snow at all--think of that! It is such a slack and lazy way to do always to be wearing one set of things and never getting out any winter flannels. I shouldn't know where I was if I didn't chalk off the seasons by my house cleaning, preserving, getting out the furs, and putting them away. I just know those Italians live without any system. How could they be expected to have any when it's summer all the time?\"  She sniffed scornfully.  In fact Hannah sniffed a good many times before the great ship which was carrying them to Naples docked beneath the shadow of Vesuvius. The staterooms she termed little coops, and the berths nothing more nor less than shelves.  \"When I go to bed, Mr. Bob, I feel exactly as if I was a sheet put away in the linen closet.\"  Uncle Bob and Jean both laughed. Hannah kept them royally entertained.  \"As for these clocks that strike every hour but the right one--I've nothing to say,\" she went on. \"If the captain prefers to ring two when he means nine, well and good. He runs the ship and it is his lookout, although I will say it is hard on the rest of us. He explains that it has something to do with the watch--whose watch I don't know; his own, I suppose. Evidently he has some queer way of telling time, some theory he is free to work out when he is here in the middle of the ocean away from land. Be glad, Jean, that you learned to tell time properly, and that you live with people who are content to use the old method and do not set themselves up to invent a system that is a puzzle to every one but themselves.\"  Thus Hannah measured every new experience, applying to it the Beacon Hill standard. If it conformed to what was done in Boston it was quite correct, but if it varied in the least it was condemned as \"ridiculous.\"  To Jean, on the contrary, the voyage was one of unending delight. She proved herself an excellent sailor, and was never tired of playing shuffle-board on the deck or pacing to and fro with Uncle Bob in the fresh breeze. And when at last Gibraltar was reached and she actually beheld the coasts of Spain, Africa and Italy, her wonder grew until she said she had to pinch herself to be sure she was alive and not dreaming. It was a journey of marvels.  \"I feel exactly as if I had gone down the rabbit hole with Alice,\" she exclaimed, squeezing Uncle Bob's arm as they were disembarking at Naples.  Uncle Bob was in such a hurry to reach Florence that the travelers did not stay long in Naples--only long enough to visit the famous Aquarium with its myriad of strange sea creatures, and to take a flying glimpse of the Museum. It was at the latter place that Jean saw the celebrated Naples Vase which, Uncle Bob told her, was found over a hundred years ago in a tomb in Pompeii.  \"It probably was made by very skilful Grecian workmen about the year 70 A. D. Think how wonderful it is that there were artists living many thousands of years ago who knew how to make such a beautiful thing. Look closely at it, Jean, for it is one of the art treasures of the world.\"  Jean looked.  The vase, scarcely more than a foot in height, was of dark blue glass, and had upon it in white a design of delicate Grecian figures.  \"It was first made with a coating of white opaque glass entirely over the blue,\" Uncle Bob explained. \"Then the artist with extreme care and some sharp instrument cut this beautiful picture of the harvest gatherers. Notice, too, how the pattern is repeated on the handles. It is a pity the base or foot of the vase is missing; it was probably of gold and was doubtless stolen at some time. There is now made in England a kind of pottery called Wedgwood, which has much this same effect although, of"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/207"],["title","The Spell of the Yukon and Other Verses (#1)"],["body"," the pine-gloom,     When the scroll of the Lord is unfurled,    And the wind and the wave are silent,     And world is singing to world.     The Law of the Yukon       This is the law of the Yukon, and ever she makes it plain:    \"Send not your foolish and feeble; send me your strong and your sane --    Strong for the red rage of battle; sane for I harry them sore;    Send me men girt for the combat, men who are grit to the core;    Swift as the panther in triumph, fierce as the bear in defeat,    Sired of a bulldog parent, steeled in the furnace heat.    Send me the best of your breeding, lend me your chosen ones;    Them will I take to my bosom, them will I call my sons;    Them will I gild with my treasure, them will I glut with my meat;    But the others -- the misfits, the failures -- I trample under my feet.    Dissolute, damned and despairful, crippled and palsied and slain,    Ye would send me the spawn of your gutters -- Go! take back your spawn again.     \"Wild and wide are my borders, stern as death is my sway;    From my ruthless throne I have ruled alone for a million years and a day;    Hugging my mighty treasure, waiting for man to come,    Till he swept like a turbid torrent, and after him swept -- the scum.    The pallid pimp of the dead-line, the enervate of the pen,    One by one I weeded them out, for all that I sought was -- Men.    One by one I dismayed them, frighting them sore with my glooms;    One by one I betrayed them unto my manifold dooms.    Drowned them like rats in my rivers, starved them like curs on my plains,    Rotted the flesh that was left them, poisoned the blood in their veins;    Burst with my winter upon them, searing forever their sight,    Lashed them with fungus-white faces, whimpering wild in the night;     \"Staggering blind through the storm-whirl, stumbling mad through the snow,    Frozen stiff in the ice-pack, brittle and bent like a bow;    Featureless, formless, forsaken, scented by wolves in their flight,    Left for the wind to make music through ribs that are glittering white;    Gnawing the black crust of failure, searching the pit of despair,    Crooking the toe in the trigger, trying to patter a prayer;    Going outside with an escort, raving with lips all afoam,    Writing a cheque for a million, driveling feebly of home;    Lost like a louse in the burning... or else in the tented town    Seeking a drunkard's solace, sinking and sinking down;    Steeped in the slime at the bottom, dead to a decent world,    Lost 'mid the human flotsam, far on the frontier hurled;    In the camp at the bend of the river, with its dozen saloons aglare,    Its gambling dens ariot, its gramophones all ablare;    Crimped with the crimes of a city, sin-ridden and bridled with lies,    In the hush of my mountained vastness, in the flush of my midnight skies.    Plague-spots, yet tools of my purpose, so natheless I suffer them thrive,    Crushing my Weak in their clutches, that only my Strong may survive.     \"But the others, the men of my mettle, the men who would 'stablish my fame    Unto its ultimate issue, winning me honor, not shame;    Searching my uttermost valleys, fighting each step as they go,    Shooting the wrath of my rapids, scaling my ramparts of snow;    Ripping the guts of my mountains, looting the beds of my creeks,    Them will I take to my bosom, and speak as a mother speaks.    I am the land that listens, I am the land that broods;    Steeped in eternal beauty, crystalline waters and woods.    Long have I waited lonely, shunned as a thing accurst,    Monstrous, moody, pathetic, the last of the lands and the first;    Visioning camp-fires at twilight, sad with a longing forlorn,    Feeling my womb o'er-pregnant with the seed of cities unborn.    Wild and wide are my borders, stern as death is my sway,    And I wait for the men who will win me -- and I will not be won in a day;    And I will not be won by weaklings, subtle, suave and mild,    But by men with the hearts of vikings, and the simple faith of a child;    Desperate, strong and resistless, unthrottled by fear or defeat,    Them will I gild with my treasure, them will I glut with my meat.     \"Lofty I stand from each sister land, patient and wearily wise,    With the weight of a world of sadness in my quiet, passionless eyes;    Dreaming alone of a people, dreaming alone of a day,    When men shall not rape my riches, and curse me and go away;    Making a bawd of my bounty, fouling the hand that gave --    Till I rise in my wrath and I sweep on their path      and I stamp them into a grave.    Dreaming of men who will bless me, of women esteeming me good,    Of children born in my borders of radiant motherhood,    Of cities leaping to stature, of fame like a flag unfurled,    As I pour the tide of my riches in the eager lap of the world.\"     This is the Law of the Yukon, that only the Strong shall thrive;    That surely the Weak shall perish, and only the Fit survive.    Dissolute, damned and despairful, crippled and palsied and slain,    This is the Will of the Yukon, -- Lo, how she makes it plain!     The Parson's Son            _This is the song of the parson's son, as he squats in his shack alone,         On the wild, weird nights, when the Northern Lights           shoot up from the frozen zone,         And it's sixty below, and couched in the snow the hungry huskies moan:_     \"I'm one of the Arctic brotherhood, I'm an old-time pioneer.    I came with the first -- O God! how I've cursed      this Yukon -- but still I'm here.    I've sweated athirst in its summer heat, I've frozen and starved in its cold;    I've followed my dreams by its thousand streams,      I've toiled and moiled for its gold.     \"Look at my eyes -- been snow-blind twice; look where my foot's half gone;    And that gruesome scar on my left cheek,      where the frost-fiend bit to the bone.    Each one a brand of this devil's land,      where I've played and I've lost the game,    A broken wreck with a craze for `hooch', and never a cent to my name.     \"This mining is only a gamble; the worst is as good as the best;    I was in with the bunch and I might have come out right on top with the rest;    With Cormack, Ladue and Macdonald -- O God! but it's hell to think    Of the thousands and thousands I've squandered on cards and women and drink.     \"In the early days we were just a few, and we hunted and fished around,    Nor dreamt by our lonely camp-fires of the wealth that lay under the ground.    We traded in skins and whiskey, and I've often slept under the shade    Of that lone birch tree on Bonanza, where the first big find was made.     \"We were just like a great big family, and every man had his squaw,    And we lived such a wild, free, fearless life beyond the pale of the law;    Till sudden there came a whisper, and it maddened us every man,    And I got in on Bonanza before the big rush began.     \"Oh, those Dawson days, and the sin and the blaze,      and the town all open wide!

But we all were mad, both the good and the bad, and as for the women, well --    No spot on the map in so short a space has hustled more souls to hell.     \"Money was just like dirt there, easy to get and to spend.    I was all caked in on a dance-hall jade, but she shook me in the end.    It put me queer, and for near a year I never drew sober breath,    Till I found myself in the bughouse ward with a claim staked out on death.     \"Twenty years in the Yukon, struggling along its creeks;    Roaming its giant valleys, scaling its god-like peaks;    Bathed in its fiery sunsets, fighting its fiendish cold --    Twenty years in the Yukon... twenty years -- and I'm old.     \"Old and weak, but no matter, there's `hooch' in the bottle still.    I'll hitch up the dogs to-morrow, and mush down the trail to Bill.    It's so long dark, and I'm lonesome -- I'll just lay down on the bed;    To-morrow I'll go... to-morrow... I guess I'll play on the red.     \"... Come, Kit, your pony is saddled.      I'm waiting, dear, in the court...   ...

Our Father, which art in heaven, hallowed be Thy name...\"          _This was the song of the parson's son, as he lay in his bunk alone,         Ere the fire went out and the cold crept in,           and his blue lips ceased to moan,         And the hunger-maddened malamutes had torn him flesh from bone._     The Call of the Wild       Have you gazed on naked grandeur where there's nothing else to gaze on,     Set pieces and drop-curtain scenes galore,    Big mountains heaved to heaven, which the blinding sunsets blazon,     Black canyons where the rapids rip and roar?    Have you swept the visioned valley      with the green stream streaking through it,     Searched the Vastness for a something you have lost?    Have you strung your soul to silence?  Then for God's sake go and do it;     Hear the challenge, learn the lesson, pay the cost.     Have you wandered in the wilderness, the sagebrush desolation,     The bunch-grass levels where the cattle graze?    Have you whistled bits of rag-time at the end of all creation,     And learned to know the desert's little ways?    Have you camped upon the foothills, have you galloped o'er the ranges,     Have you roamed the arid sun-lands through and through?    Have you chummed up with the mesa?  Do you know its moods and changes?     Then listen to the Wild -- it's calling you.     Have you known the Great White Silence, not a snow-gemmed twig aquiver?     (Eternal truths that shame our soothing lies.)    Have you broken trail on snowshoes? mushed your huskies up the river,     Dared the unknown, led the way, and clutched the prize?
