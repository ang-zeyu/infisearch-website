At the time when the regiment received its uniforms, Terence had ordered that twenty suits of the men's peasant clothes should be retained in store and, specially intelligent men being chosen, twenty of these were sent forward towards the river Alberche, to discover Victor's position. They brought in news that he had placed his troops behind the river, and that Cuesta, who had at one time an advanced guard at Oropesa, had recalled it to Almaraz. Parties of Victor's cavalry were patrolling the country between Talavera and Oropesa.  Terence had sent Bull, with five hundred men, to occupy all the passes across the Sierras, with orders to capture any orderlies or messengers who might come along; and a day later four men brought in a French officer, who had been captured on the road leading south. He was the bearer of a letter from Soult to the king, and was at once sent, under the escort of four troopers, to headquarters.  The men who had brought in the officer reported that they had learned that Wilson, with his command of four thousand men, was in the mountains north of the Escurial; and that spies from that officer had ascertained that there was great alarm in Madrid, where the news of the British advance towards Plasencia was already known; and that it was feared that this force, with Cuesta's army at Almaraz and Venegas' army in La Mancha, were about to combine in an attack upon the capital. This, indeed, was Sir Arthur's plan, and had been arranged with the Supreme Junta. The Junta, however, being jealous of Cuesta, had given secret instructions to Venegas to keep aloof.  On his arrival at Plasencia, the English general had learned at once the hollowness of the Spanish promises. He had been assured of an ample supply of food, mules, and carts for transport; and had, on the strength of these statements, advanced with but small supplies, for little food and but few animals could be obtained in Portugal. He found, on arriving, that no preparations whatever had been made; and the army, thus early in the campaign, was put on half rations. Day after day passed without any of the promised supplies arriving, and Sir Arthur wrote to the Supreme Junta; saying that although, in accordance with his agreement, he would march to the Alberche, he would not cross that river unless the promises that had been made were kept, to the letter.  He had, by this time, learned that the French forces north of the mountains were much more formidable than the Spanish reports had led him to believe; but he still greatly underrated Soult's army, and was altogether ignorant that Ney had evacuated Galicia, and was marching south with all speed, with his command. Del Parque had failed in his promise to garrison Bejar and Banos, and these passes were now only held by a few hundreds of Cuesta's Spaniards.  A week after taking up his position north of Oropesa, Terence received orders to move with his two battalions, and to take post to guard these passes; with his left resting on Bejar, and his right in communication with Wilson's force. The detachments were at once recalled. A thousand men were posted near Bejar, and the rest divided among the other passes by which a French army from the north could cross the Sierra.  As soon as this arrangement was made, Terence rode to Wilson's headquarters. He was received very cordially by that officer.  \"I am heartily glad to see you, Colonel O'Connor,\" the latter said. \"Of course, I have heard of the doings of your battalions; and am glad, indeed, to have your support. I sent a messenger off, only this morning, to Sir Arthur; telling him that, from the information brought in by my spies, I am convinced that Soult is much stronger than has been supposed; and that, if he moves south, I shall scarce be able to hold the passes of Arenas and San Pedro Barnardo; and that I can certainly spare no men for the defence of the more westerly ones, by which Soult is likely to march from Salamanca. However, now you are there, I shall feel safe.\"  \"No doubt I could hinder an advance, Sir Robert,\" Terence said, \"but I certainly could not hope to bar the passes to a French army. I have no artillery and, though my men are steady enough against infantry, I doubt whether they would be able to withstand an attack heralded by a heavy cannonade. With a couple of batteries of artillery to sweep the passes, one might make a fair stand for a time against a greatly superior force; but with only infantry, one could not hope to maintain one's position.\"  \"Quite so, and Sir Arthur could not expect it. My own opinion is that we shall have fifty thousand men coming down from the north. I have told the chief as much; but naturally he will believe the assurances of the Spanish juntas, rather than reports gathered by our spies; and no doubt hopes to crush Victor altogether, before Soult makes any movement; and he trusts to Venegas' advance, from the south towards the upper Tagus, to cause Don Joseph to evacuate Madrid, as soon as he hears of Victor's defeat.  \"But I have, certainly, no faith whatever in either Venegas or Cuesta. Cuesta is loyal enough, but he is obstinate and pig headed and, at present, he is furious because the Supreme Junta has been sending all the best troops to Venegas, instead of to him; and he knows, well enough, that that perpetual intriguer Frere is working underhand to get Albuquerque appointed to the supreme command. As to Venegas, he is a mere tool of the Supreme Junta and, as likely as not, they will order him to do nothing but keep his army intact.  \"Then again, the delay at Plasencia has upset all Sir Arthur's arrangements. Had he pressed straight forward on the 28th of last month, when he crossed the frontier, disregarding Cuesta altogether, he could have been at Madrid long before this; for I know that at that time Victor's force had been so weakened that he had but between fourteen and fifteen thousand men, and must have fallen back without fighting. Now he has again got the troops that had been taken from him, and will be further reinforced before Sir Arthur arrives on the Alberche; and of course Soult has had plenty of time to get everything in readiness to cross the mountains, and fall upon the British rear, as soon as he hears that they are fairly on their way towards Madrid. Here we are at the 20th, and our forces will only reach Oropesa today.  \"Victor is evidently afraid that Sir Arthur will move from Oropesa towards the hills, pass the upper Alberche, and so place himself between him and Madrid; for a strong force of cavalry reconnoitred in this direction, this morning.\"  \"Would it not be as well, sir,\" said Terence, \"if we were to arrange some signals by which we could aid each other? That hill top can be seen from the hill beyond which is the little village where I have established myself. I noticed it this morning, before I started. If you would keep a lookout on your hill, I would have one on mine. We might each get three bonfires, a hundred yards apart, ready for lighting. If I hear of any great force approaching the defiles I am watching, I could summon your aid either by day or night by these fires; and in the same way, if Soult should advance by the line that you are guarding, you could summon me. My men are really well trained in this sort of work, and you could trust them to make an obstinate defence.\"  \"I think that your idea is a very good one, and will certainly carry it out. You see, we are really both of us protecting the left flank of our army, and can certainly do so more effectually if we work together.  \"We might, too, arrange another signal. One fire might mean that, for some reason or other, we are marching away. I may have orders to move some distance towards Madrid, so as to compel Victor to weaken himself by detaching a force to check me; you may be ordered, as the army advances, to leave your defiles in charge of the Spaniards, and to accompany the army. Two fires might mean, spies have reported a general advance of the French coming by several routes. Thus, you see, we should be in readiness for any emergency.  \"I should be extremely glad of your help, if Soult comes this way. My own corps of 1200 men are fairly good soldiers, and I can rely upon them to do their best; but the other 3000 have been but recently raised, and I don't think that any dependence can be placed upon them, in case of hard fighting; but with your two battalions, we ought to be able to hold any of these defiles for a considerable time.\"  Two days later, Terence received orders to march instantly with his force down into the valley, to follow the foot of the hills until he reached the Alberche, when he was to report his arrival, wait until he received orders, and check the advance of any French force endeavouring to move round the left flank of the British. The evening before, one signal fire had announced that Wilson was on the move and, thinking that he, too, might be summoned, Terence had called in all his outposts, and was able to march a quarter of an hour after he received the order.  He had learned, on the evening he returned from his visit to Sir Robert, from men sent down into the plain for the purpose, that Cuesta's army and that of Sir Arthur had advanced together from Oropesa. He was glad at the order to join the army, as he had felt that, should Soult advance, his force, unprovided as it was with guns, would be able to offer but a very temporary resistance; especially if the French Marshal was at the head of a force anything like as strong as was reported by the peasantry. As to this, however, he had very strong doubts, having come to distrust thoroughly every report given by the Spaniards. He knew that they were as ready, under the influence of fear, to exaggerate the force of an enemy as they were, at other times, to magnify their own numbers. Sir Arthur must, he thought, be far better informed than he himself could be; "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20208"],["title","Boy Scouts in the Philippines; Or, The Key to the Treaty Box (#1)"],["body","boat was at the transport's side. Full of enthusiasm, and with high hopes for the immediate future, the boys and the Major descended to the shaky little craft and the transport steamed off, her rails lined with soldiers and civilians cheering the boys and wishing them good luck.  The last voice they heard as the boat crossed the bar and swung into the sluggish current of the river was that of Captain Helmer, who had made chums and companions of the boys on the way over.  \"Good hunting!\" he cried, through his megaphone, and the marine band struck up \"Home, Sweet Home,\" \"just to give us a cheerful mood on entering this desolate land!\" as Major Ross declared.  \"Do they all think we're goin' huntin'?\" asked Jimmie, as the windrows of salt water heaped up by the transport grew smaller and lapped on the beach.  \"Sure they do,\" replied Jack. \"Do you think the Major told them we were going into the jungles to catch a few recruits for the federal prison at Manila? Nice thing, that would be!\"  \"There are just two persons, so far as I know, outside of the Secret Service headquarters at Washington, who know what we are up to,\" Major Ross said. \"These are Colonel Hill, of the Canal Zone force, and Captain Godwin, who is to receive us here.\"  The brown oarsmen tugged and strained at the oars, and the waters of the river came up to the rim of the native boat and crept in and spread themselves over the rotten floor. The boys were all glad when the prow touched the little dock at the lone pueblo where Uncle Sam's flag snapped in a breeze which was coming over the trees, bringing with it a musty smell of decaying undergrowth.  Captain Godwin met them at the landing with great hand outstretched. He was a stout, brown-faced man of fifty, with muscles like iron and a mind all stuffed and tucked in with the glory of the United States. He was proud of the service he had passed the greater part of his life in, and was proud of the record for efficiency he had made. A kindly, bluff, seasoned old man of war, with soft blue eyes and a hard hand.  \"I should have sent the _Manhattan_ after you,\" he said, after introductions had been made, \"only there's something the matter with her batteries.\"  \"You bet there is!\" laughed Jimmie. \"The only battery that never gets under foot or loses a shoe is at the foot of Broadway, in little old New York!\"  \"Hardly at the foot of Broadway,\" Jack began, but Jimmie interrupted.  \"Never mind,\" he said, \"if we know where it is! You go an' fix up this motor boat of the name of _Manhattan_, an' we'll have a ride.\"  \"The boat will be ready by to-morrow morning,\" the Captain said, smiling at the friendly arguments of the two boys. \"I presume you have your instructions?\" he added.  \"I have them here,\" Major Ross said, rather sternly, as he took a sealed packet from his pocket.  \"When and where are you to open that packet?\" asked the Captain.  \"On my arrival at this place,\" was the dignified reply.  The Major seemed to be of opinion that the Captain was stepping on his official rights.  \"Then we'll go up to the house and you look them over while I see what can be found to celebrate this auspicious event! I don't often have the pleasure of meeting four happy, husky, hungry boys fresh from the United States!\"  \"You're the goods, all right!\" shouted Jimmie. \"But how did you guess we were hungry?\"  Captain Godwin laughed and clapped both his broad palms on his knees.  \"How did I know?\" he roared. \"That's a good one! As if the boys weren't always as hungry as black bears!\"  \"There are two Black Bears in the party!\" Jimmie said.  \"And two Wolves!\" Jack added.  Captain Godwin looked from face to face in smiling wonder, and the boys thrust all kinds of Boy Scout signs and words at him.  \"I see,\" the Captain said, then. \"I've heard of the Boy Scouts! And now we'll go up to the house. Never saw a Black Bear or a Wolf that wasn't hungry!\"  The jolly Captain gave instructions to his servants and they promised, with many native grimaces and a waste of tribal vocabulary, to have a satisfying breakfast ready in half an hour. Then Godwin drew Major Ross and Ned to one side, his good-natured face assuming a grave expression as he seated them in a private room of the rambling and wobbly old house.  \"There's something unexpected here,\" he began, as the Major sat with his sealed instructions in hand, \"and I wish you would open your packet immediately. To tell you the truth, I'm not a little worried.\"  The Major opened the packet and glanced hastily through several typed sheets. Then his keen eyes grew puzzled and he arose to his feet and looked out of the window.  \"Something here I don't understand,\" he said. \"Where's this Lieutenant Rowe?\"  \"You are to confer with him here?\" asked the Captain, and Major Ross nodded assent. \"Do you know what information he possesses?\" continued the Captain, \"what papers he has in his possession?\"  \"My instructions say he has important documents.\"  \"Well,\" said the Captain, arising to his feet, \"now I'll take you to the place where I last saw Lieutenant Rowe. He came here in the launch _Manhattan_, which you are to have use of, last night, and went to bed without talking much with me. I suspect that he brought the boat from Manila, though I can't be sure. Anyway, he brought with him only two young men who did not seem to know much about the boat--Americans.\"  \"Have you seen him, the Lieutenant, or either of the young men, this morning?\" asked the Major, impatiently. \"And why do you say you will take us to the place where you saw him last? What is wrong here?\"  \"I don't know,\" was the reply. \"There are no known hostile elements here, and yet the little nipa hut where Rowe and his men lodged last night was found empty this morning--empty and the contents in disorder, the floor spotted with blood.\"     CHAPTER II.  IT'S UP TO THE BOY SCOUTS.   \"Do you mean that he has been murdered?\" asked the Major, his face, flushed before, looking gray and old.  \"I don't know,\" was the reply. \"I have tried to look on the bright side of the thing, but there's a subconscious warning in the back of my brain somewhere. I've tried to be jolly, this morning, but I've about reached the end of my store of optimism. It looks to me as if the Lieutenant had been made way with.\"  \"This leaves me stranded,\" the Major said. \"I am ordered to act only after acquiring later information concerning the situation, the same to be delivered by Lieutenant Rowe. In the absence of that information, what am I to do? My present orders may be all wrong.\"  \"Perhaps,\" Ned suggested, \"it may be well to visit this hut and see what we can discover there. The Lieutenant may have gone out for a morning's hunt.\"  \"No such good luck as that,\" replied the Captain. \"Why, the little furniture the hut contains is broken to bits, and the floor is streaked with blood! There was a fight in there last night, depend upon it!\"  \"And no one heard anything unusual during the night?\" asked Ned.  \"Not that I know of.\"  \"Are the usual residents of this place, so far as you know, all here this morning?\" was the next question.  \"I will ascertain that,\" said the Captain. \"I learned of the strange happening only a few minutes before your arrival.\"  The three left the house, the only one of size there, and proceeded down a mushy street between huts and thickets until they came to a little nipa hut set high on poles. They climbed the bamboo stairs and stood on the swaying porch in front, seeing no one about the place.  The door stood wide open, and Captain Godwin was first to enter. There was only one room in the hut, but there were two alcoves opening from it--narrow little alcoves in which, evidently, bedding and articles not wanted for immediate use were tucked away during the day.  As the Captain had stated, the apartment was in disorder. The mosquito wiring had been torn from the three windows and the door and now lay in a tangle on the floor. Bamboo chairs had been broken, and there was a faint odor of whisky in the room. Major Ross glanced casually over the interior and turned away.  \"I can't stop here now,\" he said impatiently. \"I've got to write a report of this happening and get it to Manila. I suppose I can depend on one of your men to deliver a letter for me?\" he added, turning to Captain Godwin.  \"Yes, but it will mean a great delay,\" replied Godwin. \"It will take at least a week for a man in a swift canoe to go to Manila and return here.\"  \"It is unfortunate,\" grumbled the Major, \"but I must, I suppose, endure the delay. Unless,\" he continued, a sudden smile coming to his face as he thought of the cozy club-life he had formerly enjoyed at Manila, \"unless I go with the messenger and receive my instructions verbally.\"  \"And in the meantime--\"  Captain Godwin was about to protest against being left alone there under such tragic circumstances, but Ned caught his eyes and stopped him. He had no idea what the boy had in mind in checking his expression of regret at the proposed departure of the Major, but he liked the appearance of the lad and closed his teeth on the words he was about to say.  \"And in the meantime,\" he repeated, \"we can look about for some traces of the missing man,\" the Captain completed the sentence.  \"Exactly,\" replied the Major. \"I regret exceedingly the peril of the situation so far as Lieutenant Rowe and his companions are concerned, and sincerely hope that they are all alive and not in serious trouble, but it appears to me that my place is at Manila at this time, and not here. We must start in on this remarkable case right, and I must confer with my superior officers.\"  \"We can put in the time very well, looking up clues in the vicinity,\" said Ned. He wanted to handle the matter in his own way, knowing that while Major Ross might be an expert in military matters, he did not possess a particle of the detective instinct so necessary at that time.  \"Yes,\" the Major replied, with his mind fixed on a few days of lazy routine at Manila, with"]]]
