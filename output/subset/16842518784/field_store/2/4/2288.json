Still, as I had undertaken to do so, I should not have felt justified in lying down.  I should probably have let the fire out, and the smoke from that was at all events useful to keep mosquitoes and sandflies somewhat at bay.  Should the fire go out it was no more than possible that a pack of dingoes might creep up, and while we were in darkness drive the horses away, or carry off our saddle-bags, or tear our saddles and sleeping-rugs to pieces.  I persevered therefore, stopping every now and then to amuse myself by looking up at the star-lighted sky and trying to make out the various constellations, conspicuous among which was the brilliant cross of the southern hemisphere.  Except the occasional croak of a frog, the cry of a night bird, or the chirp of a cricket, not a sound had reached my ears; when suddenly, as I was watching the moon rising above the rocks on one side of the camp, the most unearthly shrieks and yells rent the air.  Guy, awakening, started to his feet.  \"What's the matter?\" he exclaimed.  \"I dreamed that savages were upon us, and expected the next moment to have a spear through me.\"  \"I haven't seen any savages, but those sounds seem scarcely human, I wonder Bracewell hasn't been awakened by them.  We must rouse up Toby and learn what he thinks they are.\"  The fearful noise still continued.  We stood with our arms ready expecting every moment to see a herd of savages rush in upon us, for that the sounds were produced by natives we could have no doubt.  We quickly made Toby spring to his feet.  \"What's all that noise about?\" asked Guy.  \"He-he-he, ho-ho-ho! dat corroborree,\" answered Toby who did not appear, as we expected would be the case, at all astonished at the uproar.  Bracewell at length awoke and confirmed what Toby had said, that the savages were indulging in one of their native dances.  \"I should like to go and see it,\" I exclaimed; \"can we do so without risk of being discovered?\"  Taking Toby to guide us, while Bracewell remained in camp, we set out. We were scarcely prepared for the strange and weird sight which we saw as we looked over some low bushes we had just reached.  Before us was an open glade, beyond which the moon was rising brightly.  In the centre of the glade burned a fire.  Seated on the ground were a number of figures rattling sticks together.  Suddenly there burst forth out of the darkness a score of skeleton-like figures who threw themselves into every possible attitude, now stretching out their legs, now springing up and clapping their hands, and all the time shrieking, laughing and singing, and following a big black fellow who acted as fugleman and stood on one side with stick in hand to direct the proceedings.  Not for a moment did they cease, though every now and then we might have fancied that they had disappeared had we not distinguished their black backs turned towards us.  We watched until we grew weary of the sight, but the dancers appeared in no way tired; and as we saw no chance of their giving in, we retreated to our own camp, pretty well tired out and assured that they would not molest us during the night.    CHAPTER TWO.  The night passed as Bracewell had predicted, without a visit from the natives; and as he assured us that they were not at all likely to attack four armed men in the day-time, we, being anxious to become better acquainted with them, agreed before setting off to pay a visit to their camp.  They were sure indeed to find ours out; so that it would be as well to show that we had no fear of them, and to gain their friendship. On examining the birds we had cooked the previous evening we found they had been nearly devoured by the white ants, a large nest of which we discovered a short distance from the camp.  We had therefore to look out for some fresh provisions.  Bracewell was a much better shot than either of us; and, taking my gun, in a few minutes he killed a small kangaroo which he found as it was about to spring out of the bush where it had spent the night, scarcely a hundred yards from the camp.  Having skinned it in the most scientific fashion, the joints were put on to roast.  We had now an abundance for our noon-day meal; for, as the animal was about four feet long, including the tail which was nearly half its length, it afforded us a good supply of meat.  We should have preferred starting at day-break, but without food we none of us felt inclined to commence our journey.  Toby indeed gave us to understand that he could not think of leaving while so much good meat remained to be eaten.  Having given him as much as we all three consumed, we packed up the remainder in our saddle-bags and then--I insisting that Bracewell should mount my horse while I walked--we set off for the native village which we caught sight of a short distance to the north of our camp.  The inhabitants were lying about in front of it, evidently enjoying the _otium cum dignitate_.  The men mostly stretched on the ground surrounded by their dogs, while the women were squatting outside their leafy bowers.  The huts, if so they can be called, were placed in a semi-circle, and were formed by thick boughs stuck in the ground joining at the top on which other boughs were lightly thrown.  They were scarcely more than four feet in height and might be described rather as screens than huts, as their only object appeared to be to keep off the wind from the inhabitants and the small fires which burnt before them.  On the outside were stuck their spears ready for instant use.  Except some pieces of opossum skin round their loins, the men wore no garments, though several of them had fillets bound round their brows.  Two or three were smoking short clay pipes obtained from shepherds or hut-keepers with whom they had come in contact.  Several of the men started up, and seizing their spears advanced as they saw us approach, but the greater number lay gorged with food on the ground, not apparently noticing us.  Bracewell, who could speak Toby's lingo, told him to say to the black fellows, that we wished to be their friends; that their corroborree had afforded us a good deal of amusement; and that if we could kill a kangaroo we would give it to them to make another feast the next night.  As soon as Toby had translated what had been said, the blacks began chattering away in the most extraordinary fashion.  As they ceased Toby informed us that they were highly pleased with our offer.  They wished to remain friends with the white men, and if we chose to stop with them we should be welcome.  Of course, we had no inclination to do this, but we asked if two or three of them would accompany us to carry home any game we might kill.  They however declined the invitation, saying that they were well filled already, of which fact their distended condition was sufficient evidence.  \"Well then, as we cannot turn back, you will have to go without a kangaroo, even though we may shoot one,\" said Bracewell, and telling Toby to wish them a friendly farewell we rode on.  As I was very active and had been accustomed to running at school, I easily kept up with the horses.  At length however, as the sun grew hotter, I should have been glad enough to remount.  Bracewell, observing that I was becoming fatigued, insisted on getting off his horse, but of this I would not hear.  He however dismounted, when Guy made him get on again and put me on his own horse.  Before long, however, my brother was nearly knocked up, and seeing this I proposed that he should remount, and that I should ride Toby's horse.  Toby made a wry face, for, although better able to run than any of us, he considered that it was more dignified to ride.  As we rode along we kept a look-out for kangaroos, as we should have been glad to kill one for ourselves, although our black friends were not likely to benefit by it.  We had gone some way when we caught sight of a dark object appearing just above a thick mass of leaves some two hundred yards away.  Standing up in my stirrups I saw that it was the head of a kangaroo who was engaged in pulling off the foliage.  I called to Bracewell and my brother, hoping that if we could get nearer before the creature moved away, we might shoot it.  Throwing the halter of the baggage-horse, which I had been leading, to Toby, I rode towards the spot, unslinging my rifle and as I did so ramming down a ball.  The creature was more wide-awake than I had supposed.  I had just got near enough to fire, when it broke from its cover in fine style and, after taking a few jumps to see in what direction to go, it started forward over the open ground without apparent effort.  \"That's a large _boomer_, an old one!\" shouted Bracewell, \"he'll give us a long run.  If we had dogs we should soon however catch him.\"  In the excitement of the chase, forgetting that we ran great risk of knocking up our horses, away we started.  Although the animal had only two legs to run on and had an enormous tail to carry, which does not, I really believe, help it, though it serves to balance itself in its upright position, so far did it get ahead of us that it was useless firing.  I had scarcely noticed the direction it was taking, but on looking round I found that it was leading us back to the spot from which we had come.  How far it had got I cannot say, when four or five black fellows started up with spears in their hands uttering loud shouts and shrieks.  The _boomer_ saw that it had no chance of escape in that direction, being perhaps better acquainted with its black enemies than with the strange creatures on four legs which had been pursuing it.  It therefore stopped and gave us time to approach before it bounded round and made off to the right.  I had thrown myself from my horse, for I had no notion at that time of firing from my saddle.  I took a steady aim and pulled the trigger.

Some way up that river is the the town of Pisania, where an English factory had been established, and a few Europeans were settled, with a medical man, Dr Laidley.  Leaving this place, he proceeded to Tisheet, a place in the Great Desert, hoping from thence to reach Timbuctoo; but, robbed by a Moorish chief, of everything he possessed, he wandered alone through the desert, till, exhausted by hunger and thirst, he sat down under a tree and died.  The news of his fate was brought to Dr Laidley soon afterwards by some negroes.  These expeditions threw no light on the interior of the continent.  A fresh volunteer, however, Mungo Park, then unknown to fame, was soon to commence those journeys which have immortalised his name, and which contributed so greatly to solve one of the chief African problems--the course of the Niger.    CHAPTER TWO.  TRAVELS OF MUNGO PARK.  PARENTAGE--RETURNS FROM INDIA--SENT OUT BY THE AFRICAN ASSOCIATION-- SAILS FOR AFRICA--ARRIVES AT PISANIA--STARTS WITH A COME EASTWARD--MUMBO JUMBO--ARRIVES AT KOOJAR--REACHES CAPITAL OF BONDOU--WELCOMED AT THE CAPITAL OF KAARTA BY KING DAISY--SEIZED AT THE TOWN OF DALLI BY MOORISH SOLDIERS, AND CARRIED CAPTIVE TO BENOWM--BARBAROUSLY TREATED BY ALI-- TAKEN TO VISIT ALI'S WIFE FATIMA--SHE COMPASSIONATES HIM--ALMOST STARVED--DIFFICULTY OF OBTAINING WATER--HIS SERVANTS TAKEN FROM HIM--ALI ATTACKED BY DAISY--PARK AGAIN FALLS INTO ALI'S HANDS--RESOLVES TO ESCAPE.  Mungo Park, who long ranked as the chief of African travellers, was born on the 10th of September, 1771, at Fowlshiels, a farm occupied by his father on the banks of the Yarrow, not far from the town of Selkirk, in Scotland.  The elder Mr Park, also called Mungo, was a substantial yeoman of Ettrick Forest, and was distinguished for his unremitting attention to the education of his children, the greater number of whom he saw respectably settled in life.  The young Mungo, after receiving with his brothers a course of education at home under a private tutor, was sent to the Grammar School at Selkirk, and at the age of fifteen was apprenticed to Mr Thomas Anderson, a surgeon of that town.  Hence he removed to the University of Edinburgh, and during his vacations made a tour with his brother-in-law, Mr Dickson, a distinguished botanist.  On going to London he was introduced by his relative to Sir Joseph Banks, whose interest procured for him the appointment of assistant surgeon to the \"Worcester,\" East Indiaman.  Returning from India, he offered his services to the African Association, who, notwithstanding the failure of the first expeditions they had sent out, still determined to persevere in their efforts.  Possessed of unbounded courage and perseverance, he was admirably fitted for the task he undertook, and his offer was gladly accepted.  Having received his final instructions from the African Association, he sailed from Portsmouth on the 22nd of May, 1795, on board the \"Endeavour,\" an African trader bound for the Gambia, where he arrived on the 21st of the following month.  His directions were to make his way to the Niger, by Bambook or any other route, to ascertain the course of that river, and to visit the principal towns in its neighbourhood, particularly Timbuctoo and Houssa, and afterwards to return by way of the Gambia or any other route he might deem advisable.  Houssa is not a city, as was then supposed, but a kingdom or province.  The vessel anchored on the 21st of June at Jillifree, where he landed and from thence proceeded up the Gambia to Pisania.  The only white residents were Dr Laidley and two merchants of the name of Ainsley, with their numerous black domestics.  It is in the dominions of the King of Yany, who afforded them protection.  Assisted by Dr Laidley, Park here set to work to learn the Mandingo tongue, and to collect information from certain black traders called Seedees.  During his residence at Pisania he was confined for two months by a severe fever, from which he recovered under the constant care of his host.  A coffle, or caravan, being about to start for the interior of Africa, Park, having purchased a hardy and spirited horse and two asses, arranged to accompany it.  He obtained also the services of Johnson, a negro who spoke both English and Mandingo.  Dr Laidley also provided him with a negro boy named Demba, a sprightly youth who spoke, besides Mandingo, the language of a large tribe in the interior.  His baggage consisted only of a small stock of provisions, beads, amber and tobacco, for the purchase of food on the road; a few changes of linen, an umbrella, pocket compass, magnetic compass and thermometer, with a fowling-piece, two pair of pistols and other small articles.  Four Mahommedan blacks also offered their services as his attendants.  They were going to travel on foot, driving their horses before them.  These six attendants regarded him with great respect, and were taught to consider that their safe return to the countries of the Gambia would depend on his preservation.  Dr Laidley and the Mr Ainsleys accompanied him for the two first days, secretly believing that they should never see him again.  Taxes are demanded from travellers at every town, by the chiefs.  Madina was the first town of any size he reached.  He was here received by King Jatta, a venerable old man, who had treated Major Haughton with great kindness.  He was seated on a mat before his hut, a number of men and women ranged on either side, who were singing and clapping their hands.  Park, saluting him respectfully, informed him of the purport of his visit.  The king replied that he not only gave him leave to pass, but would offer up his prayers for his safety.  He warned him, however, of the dangers he would encounter, observing that the people in the east differed greatly from those of his country, who were acquainted with white men and respected them.  The king having provided a guide, Park took his departure, reaching Konjowar the next night.  Here, having purchased a sheep, he found Johnson and one of his negroes quarrelling about the horns.  It appeals that these horns are highly valued as being easily converted into sheaths for keeping secure certain charms, called _saphies_.  These _saphies_ are sentences from the Koran, which the Mahommedan priests write on scraps of paper and sell to the natives, who believe that they possess extraordinary virtues.  They indeed consider the art of writing as bordering on magic; and it is not in the doctrines of the Prophet, but in the arts of the magician that their confidence is placed.  On the 8th, entering Koloa, a considerable town, he observed hanging on a tree a masquerading habit, made of bark, which he was told belonged to Mumbo Jumbo, a sort of wood demon, held greatly in awe, especially by the female part of the community.  This strange bugbear is common to all the Mandingo towns, and much employed by the pagan negroes in keeping their women in subjection.  As the Kaffirs, or pagan Africans, are not restricted in the number of their wives, every one marries as many as he can conveniently maintain; and it frequently happens that the ladies disagree among themselves, their quarrels sometimes reaching to such a height that the authority of the husband can no longer preserve peace in his household,--in such cases the interposition of Mumbo Jumbo is called in and is always decisive.  This strange minister of justice, who is supposed to be either the husband or some person instructed by him, disguised in the dress which has just been mentioned, and armed with the rod of public authority, announces his coming by loud and dismal screams in the woods near the town.  He begins the pantomime at the approach of night, and as soon as it is dark he enters the town and proceeds to the _bentang_, or public meeting-house, at which all the inhabitants immediately assemble.  The women do not especially relish this exhibition; for, as the person in disguise is entirely unknown to them, every married female suspects that the visit may possibly be intended for her; but they dare not refuse to appear when summoned.  The ceremony commences with songs and dances, which continue till midnight, about which time Mumbo fixes on the offender.  The unfortunate victim being thereupon immediately seized, is stripped naked, tied to a post, and receives a severe switching with Mumbo's rod, amidst the derisive shouts of the whole assembly, the rest of the women being the loudest in their exclamations against their unhappy sister.  Daylight puts an end to the unmanly revel.  The desert was now to be passed, in which no water was to be procured. The caravan therefore travelled rapidly till they arrived at Koojar, the frontier town of Woolli, on the road to Bondou, from which it is separated by another intervening wilderness of two days' journey.  While crossing the desert, they came to a tree, adorned with scraps of cloth, probably at first hung up to inform other travellers that water was to be found near it; but the custom has been so sanctioned by time that nobody presumes to pass without hanging up something.  Park followed the example and suspended a handsome piece of cloth on one of the boughs.  Finding, however, a fire, which the negroes thought had been made by banditti, they pushed on to another watering-place, where, surrounded by their cattle, they lay down on the bare ground, out of gun-shot from the nearest bush, the negroes agreeing to keep watch by turns, to prevent surprise.  They soon after reached Koorkarany, a Mahommedan town, which contained a mosque, and was surrounded by a high wall.  The _maraboo_, or priest, a"]]]
