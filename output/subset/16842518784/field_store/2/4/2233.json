It must be confessed that as he sat and listened to the noise, and marked how little Fellsgarth appeared to recognise his existence, he felt a trifle uneasy and nervous.  He wasn't sure now that he knew everything.  All these fellows seemed to be so thoroughly at home, and to know so exactly what to do; he wished he could do the same.  He wished, for instance, he could spin a fork round with his first finger and thumb while he talked, as Yorke, the captain, was doing.  He did once privately try, while he was not talking, but it was a dismal failure.  The fork fell with a great clatter to the floor and attracted general attraction his way.  He picked the weapon up with as easy an air as he could assume, whistling _sotto voce_ to himself as he did it, so as to appear unconcerned.  \"Look out, I say; you mustn't whistle at meal-times, it's bad manners,\" said a voice at his side.  He turned round and perceived a pleasant-looking youth of the species junior, in a red tie and wrist studs to match.  This youth evidently knew what was what at Fellsgarth; and a further glance at him convinced Fisher minor that he had met him in a good hour. For all dinner-time he had been exercised as to whether it was the thing to wear the jacket opened or buttoned.  Yorke wore his buttoned, so did a good many of the Sixth; and Fisher minor had consequently buttoned up too.  But his new friend, who was pronounced in all his ways and evidently an authority on etiquette, wore his open.  Fisher minor therefore furtively slipped his fingers down and opened his coat.  \"You're a new kid, I suppose,\" said he of the red necktie.  \"Yes, I'm Fisher minor.\"  \"What, son of Fisher the boat-builder?  I didn't know he had one so old.\"  \"No, oh no.  That's my brother up there, talking to the Dux.\"  \"The who?  I don't see any ducks.\"  \"I mean Yorke, you know, the captain.\"  \"Why ever do you call him ducks?  You'd better let him catch you calling him names like that.  Oh, you're a brother of old Fisher?  You look it.\"  Fisher minor was alarmed at the tone in which this observation was made. It seemed to imply that Fisher major was not quite all that could be desired, and yet the younger brother did not exactly know what it was in the elder which called for repudiation.  However, he was spared the pain of deciding by a new voice on his other side.  \"What's that, Wally?  Does this kid say he belongs to Fisher?  Oh, my stars, what form we're coming to!\"  Fisher minor glanced round, and experienced a shock as he did so.  For the new speaker was so like the last that he was tempted to suppose the latter had suddenly changed seats and contrived to substitute a blue necktie for a red, and button his jacket during the feat.  But when he looked back, the owner of the red tie was still in his place.  After considerable wagging of his head, he was forced to admit that he was seated between two different persons.  \"Why, he can't help that,\" said the gentleman addressed as Wally.  Fisher minor laughed feebly, and really wished his brother would pay a little more attention to the \"form.\"  \"Of course,\" said Wally, talking across to his twin brother, \"fellows can't tell what asses they look until they're told.  Don't you remember the chap last term who always wore his trousers turned up, till the prefects made him turn them down or go on the Modern side.\"  \"Catch us taking any of your cast-off louts on our side,\" retorted the other brother, who evidently belonged to the slighted side; \"yes-- shocking bad form it was--and when he turned them down at last, they found seventy-four nibs, fifty matches, and nobody knows how many candle-ends.\"  All this time Fisher minor, with panic at his heart, was furiously trying to turn down his trouser-ends with his feet.  What a lucky escape for him to get this warning in time!  During the walk round the grounds he had turned his ends up, and had quite forgotten to put them down again when he came in.  Now, no coaxing would get them down without manual assistance.  He sat clawing with one foot after another, lacerating his shins and his garments in vain.  At length in despair he dropped his fork again, and under cover of this diversion attempted to stoop and adjust the intractable folds.  In his flurry he naturally forgot the fork; so that when, after a minute and a half, he emerged without it into the upper world, his two companions were not a little perplexed.  \"What have you been up to down there?  Do you generally eat your grub under the table?\" asked Wally.  \"All I can say is, it's the best place for him if he wears his hair like that,\" said the other in tones of alarm.  \"Young kid, I never noticed that before!  Whatever induces you to part it on the right?  Did you ever hear of a Fellsgarth fellow-- Oh, I say, what a wigging you'll get!  Look at me and Wally and Yorke and all of 'em.  Whew! it makes one ill to see it!  Just look round for yourself.\"  As more than half of those present appeared to have no parting at all, and most of the rest parted on the left, Fisher minor realised with horror that he had been guilty of a terrible solecism.  The alarm depicted in the faces of both the twins was proof enough that the matter was a critical one.  It was no time for shuffling.  He had had enough of that over his trouser-ends.  He must throw himself on the mercy of his critics.  \"I quite forgot--of course,\" said he hurriedly; \"I--I--\"  \"Look here,\" said Wally, hurriedly shoving a pocket-comb into his hands; \"you'd better go downstairs again and change it sharp, or you'll be spotted.  Cut along.\"  So Fisher minor began with shame to look once more for his fork, and in doing so crawled well under the table, and sitting down proceeded nervously and painfully to open up a parting on the left side of his head.  It was an arduous task, and not made easier by the unjustifiable conduct of the twins, who having got their man safe under hatches began to kick out in an unceremonious fashion and basely betray his retreat to their friends and neighbours.  \"Pass him on!\"  \"Hack it through!\"  \"Ware cats!\" was the cry, in the midst of which the luckless Fisher minor, finding a return to his old place effectually barred, and wearying of the ceremony of running a gauntlet of all the legs along the table before it was half over, made a hasty selection of what seemed to him the mildest pair within reach, and clutching at them convulsively, hung on for dear life.  The owner of the limbs in question was Ranger, a prefect of his house and more or less of a grandee at Fellsgarth.  As he was unaware of the cause of the excitement around him, this sudden assault from below took him aback, and he started up from his chair in something as near a panic as a Fellsgarth prefect could be capable of.  Naturally his parasite followed him.  To Ranger's credit, he took in the situation rapidly, and did not abuse his opportunities.  \"What's this?\" he demanded, lifting up Fisher minor, with his hair all on end and the pocket-comb still in his hand, by the coat-collar.  \"Who does this belong to?\"  No one in particular owned the object in question.  \"What are you?\" asked the prefect.  \"I'm Fisher minor; I got under the table, somehow.\"  \"So I should suppose.  Afraid of the draughts, I suppose.\"  \"It was Wally and his brother put me there.  I didn't mean--\"  \"Oh--Wally, was it?  Here, young Wheatfield, you shouldn't leave your property about like this.  It's against rules.  Here, hook on, and don't go chucking it about any more.\"  \"All serene,\" said the twin.  \"Come along, kid.  Done with my comb?  You look ever so much better form now; doesn't he, you chaps?  How came you to lose your way downstairs?\"  Fisher minor owned himself utterly unable to account for the misadventure, and discreetly remained silent until the signal was given to return thanks and separate every boy to his own house.  As he was wandering across the court, very dismal and apprehensive of what more was in store for him, a lean youth with a pale face and very showily attired accosted him.  \"Hullo, kid, are you a new chap?\"  \"Yes,\" replied Fisher minor, eyeing the stranger suspiciously.  \"What side are you on?\"  Fisher stared interrogatively.  \"Well, then, are you Modern or Classic?\"  \"I don't know, really,\" said Fisher minor, wishing he knew which he ought to proclaim himself.  Then making a bold venture, he said, \"I believe Modern.\"  \"Good job for you,\" said the youth; \"saves me the trouble of kicking you.  Can you lend me a bob?  I'll give it you back to-morrow as soon as I've unpacked.\"  It did strike Fisher minor as queer that any one should pack shillings up in a trunk, but he was too pleased to oblige this important and fashionable-looking personage to raise any question.  \"Yes.  Can you give me change out of a half-crown?  Or you can pay me the lot back to-morrow, I shan't be wanting it till then,\" said he.  \"All serene, kid; I'm glad you are our side.  I shall be able to give you a leg-up with the fellows.  Whose house are you in?\"  \"Wakefield's, the same as my brother.\"  \"What--then you must be a Classic!  They're all Classics at Wakefield's. Why can't you tell the truth when you're asked, instead of a howling pack of lies?\"  \"I didn't know, really, I thought--\"  \"Come, that's a good one.  Any idiot knows what side he's on at Fellsgarth.\"  Fisher minor was greatly confused to stand convicted thus of greenness.  \"You see,\" said he, putting on a little \"side\" to cover his shame, \"I was bound to be stuck on the same side as my brother, you know.\"  \"Nice for you.  Not a gentleman among them.  All paupers and prigs,\" said this young Modern, waxing eloquent.  \"You'll suit them down to the ground.\""]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21037"],["title","The Cock-House at Fellsgarth (#2)"],["body","that Fisher minor had just lent the speaker half a crown, these taunts struck him as not exactly grateful.  At the same time he writhed under the reproach, and felt convinced that Classics were not at all the \"form\" at Fellsgarth.  \"Why,\" pursued the other, pocketing his coin in order to release his hands for a little elocution, \"we could boy 'em up twice over.  The workhouse isn't in it with Wakefield's.  There's not a day but they come cadging to us, wanting to borrow our tin, or our grub, or something. There, look at that chap going across there!  He's one of 'em.  Regular casual-ward form about him.  He's the meanest, stingiest lout in all Fellsgarth.\"  \"Why,\" exclaimed Fisher minor, looking in alarm towards this prodigy of baseness, \"why, that's--that's Fisher, my brother!\"  The Modern youth's jaw fell with a snap, and his cheeks lost what little colour they had.  \"What?  Why didn't you tell me!  Look here, you needn't tell him what I said.  It was quite between ourselves, you know.  I must be cutting, I say.  See you again some day.\"  And he vanished, leaving Fisher minor considerably more bewildered, and poorer by a cool half-crown, than he had been five minutes ago.    CHAPTER TWO.  LAMB'S SINGING.  Wakefield's house, as Fisher minor entered it under his brother's wing, hardly seemed to the new boy as disreputable a haunt as his recent Modern friend had led him to expect.  Nor did the sixty or seventy fellows who clustered in the common room strike him as exactly the lowest stratum of Fellsgarth society.  Yorke, the captain, for instance, with his serene, well-cut face, his broad shoulders and impressive voice hardly answered to the description of a lout.  Nor did Ranger, of the long legs, with speed written in every inch of his athletic figure, and gentleman in every line of his face, look the sort of fellow to be mistaken for a cad.  Even Fisher major, about whom the younger brother had been made to feel decided qualms, could hardly have been the hail- fellow-well-met he was with everybody, had he been all the new boy's informant had recently described him.  Indeed, Fisher minor, when presently he gathered himself together sufficiently to look round him, was surprised to see so few traces of the \"casual-ward\" in his new house.  True, most of the fellows might be poor--which, of course, was highly reprehensible; and some of them might not be connected with the nobility, which showed a great lack of proper feeling on their part.  But as a rule they held up their heads and seemed to think very well of themselves and one another; while their dress, if it was not in every case as fashionable as that of the temporary owner of Fisher minor's half-crown, was at least passably well fitting.  Fisher minor, for all his doubts about the company he was in, could not help half envying these fellows, as he saw with what glee and self- satisfaction they entered into their own at Wakefield's.  They were all so glad to be back, to see again the picture of Cain and Abel on the wall, to scramble for the corner seat in the ingle-bench, to hear the well-known creak on the middle landing, to catch the imperturbable tick of the dormitory clock, to see the top of Hawk's Pike looming out, down the valley, clear and sharp in the falling light.  Fisher minor and Ashby, as they sat dismally and watched all the fun, wondered if the time would ever come when they would feel as much at home as all this.  It was a stretch of imagination beyond their present capacity.  To their alarm, Master Wally Wheatfield presently recognised them from across the room, and came over patronisingly to where they sat.  \"Hullo, new kids! thinking of your mas, and the rocking-horses, and Nurse Jane, and all that?  Never mind, have a good blub, it'll do you good.\"  Considering how near, in strict secrecy, both the young gentlemen addressed were to the condition indicated by the genial twin, this exhortation was not exactly kind.  They tried to look as if they did not mind it, and Fisher minor naturally did his best to appear knowing.  \"I don't mind,\" said he, with a snigger; \"they're all milksops at home. I'd sooner be here.\"  \"I wouldn't,\" put in the sturdy Ashby.  \"I think it's horrid not to see a face you know.\"  \"There you are; what did I say!  Screaming for his mammy,\" gibed Wally.  \"And if I was,\" retorted Master Ashby, warming up, \"she's a lot better worth it than yours, so now!\"  Master Wally naturally fired up at this.  Such language was hardly respectful from a new junior to an old.  \"I'll pull your nose, new kid, if you cheek me.\"  \"And I'll pull yours, if you cheek my mother.\"  \"Booh, booh, poor baby!  Who's cheeking your mother?  I wouldn't cheek her with a pair of tongs.  Something better to do.  I say, are both you kids Classics?\"  \"Yes,\" they replied.  \"I thought you must be Moderns, you're both so precious green.  All right, there'll be lamb's singing directly, then you'll have to sit up.\"  \"What's lamb's singing?\" said Ashby.  \"Don't you know?\" replied Wally, glad to have recovered the whip hand. \"It's this way.  Every new kid has to sing in his house the first-night. You'll have to.\"  \"Oh,\" faltered Ashby, \"I can't; I don't know anything.\"  \"Can't get out of it; you must,\" said the twin, charmed to see the torture he was inflicting.  \"So must you, Hair-parting.\"  Fisher minor was too knowing a hand to be caught napping.  He had had the tip about lamb's singing from his brother last term, and was prepared.  He joined in, therefore, against Ashby.  \"What, didn't you know that, kid?  You must be green.  _I_ knew it all along.\"  \"That's all right,\" said Wheatfield.  \"Now I'm going.  I can't fool away all my evening with you.  By the way, mind you don't get taking up with any Modern kids.  It's not allowed, and you'll get it hot if you do.  My young brother,\" (each twin was particularly addicted to casting reflections on his brother's age) \"is a Modern.  Don't you have anything to do with him.  And whatever you do, don't lend any of them money, or there'll be a most awful row.  That's why we always call up subscriptions for the house clubs on first-night.  It cleans the fellows out, and then they can't lend any to the Moderns.  You'll have to shell out pretty soon, as soon as Lamb's singing is over.  Ta, ta.\"  This last communication put Fisher minor in a terrible panic.  He had evidently committed a gross breach of etiquette in lending that Modern boy (whose name he did not even know) a half-crown; and now, when the subscriptions were called for, he would have to declare himself before all Wakefield's a pauper.  \"I say,\" said he to Ashby, dropping the patronising for the pathetic, \"could you ever lend me half-a-crown?  I've--I've lost mine--I'll pay it you back next week faithfully.\"  \"I've only got five bob,\" said Ashby; \"to last all the term, and half a crown of that will go in the clubs to-night.\"  \"But you'll get it back in a week--really you will,\" pleaded Fisher minor, \"and I'll--\"  But here there was a sudden interruption.  Every one, from the captain down, looked towards the new boys, and a shout of \"lamb's singing,\" headed by Wally Wheatfield, left little doubt as to what it all meant.  \"Pass up the new kids down there,\" called one of the prefects. Whereupon Fisher minor and Ashby, rather pale and very nervous, were hustled up to the top of the room, where sat the grandees in a row round the table on which the sacrifice was to take place.  For the benefit of the curious it may be explained that \"lamb's singing,\" the name applied to the musical performances of new boys at Fellsgarth on first-night, is supposed to have derived its title from the frequency with which these young gentlemen fell back upon \"Mary had a little lamb\" as their theme on such occasions.  \"Isn't one of them your minor?\" asked Yorke of Fisher senior.  \"Yes,\" said the latter rather apologetically; \"the one with the light hair.  He's not much to look at.  The fact is, I only know him slightly. They say at home he's a nice boy.\"  \"Does he spend much of his time under tables, as a rule?\" asked Ranger, recognising the lost property which had hung on to his legs at dinner- time.  \"If so, I'll take the other one for my fag.\"  \"He's bagged already,\" said Denton.  \"Fisher and I put our names down for him an hour ago.\"  \"Well, that's cool.  If Fisher wanted a fag he might as well have taken his own minor.\"  \"Fisher major knew better,\" said the gentleman in question.  \"It might raise awkward family questions if I had him.\"  \"Wouldn't it be fairer to toss up?\" suggested the captain.  \"Or I don't mind swopping Wally Wheatfield for him; if you really--\"  Ranger laughed.  \"No, thank you, I draw the line at Wally.  I wouldn't deprive you of him for the world.  I suppose I must have this youngster.  Let's hear him sing first.\"  \"Yes, lamb's singing.  Now, you two, one at a time.  Who's first? Alphabetical order.\"  Ashby, with an inward groan, mounted the rostrum.  If anything could have been more cruel than the noise which greeted his appearance, it was the dead silence which followed it.  Fellows sat round, staring him out of countenance with critical faces, and rejoicing in his embarrassment.  \"What's the title!\" demanded some one.  \"I don't know any songs,\" said Ashby presently, \"and I can't sing.\"  \"Ho, ho! we've heard that before.  Come, forge ahead.\"  \"I only know the words of one that my con--somebody I know--sings, called the _Vigil_.  I don't know the tune.\"  \"That doesn't matter--out with it.\"  So Ashby, pulling himself desperately together, plunged recklessly into the following appropriate ditty; which, failing its proper tune, he manfully set at the top of his voice, and with all the energy he was capable of, to the air of the _Vicar of Bray_--    The stealthy night creeps o'er the lea,   My darling, haste away with me.   Beloved, come I see where I stand,   With arms outstretched upon the strand.    The night creeps on; my love is late,   O love, my"]]]
