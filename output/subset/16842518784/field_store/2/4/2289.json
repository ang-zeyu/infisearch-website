Moving on at noon of the 21st of December, the traveller...  This page and the next page are missing.  This page and the previous page are missing.  His fellow-travellers considered it necessary to journey by night till they could reach a more hospitable part of the country.  They accordingly started as soon as the people in the village had gone to sleep.  The stillness of the air, the howling of the wild beasts and the deep solitude of the forest made the scene solemn and impressive.  Not a word, except in a whisper, was uttered; and his companions pointed out to him the wolves and hyaenas, as they glided like shadows from one thicket to another.  The inhabitants of Bondou are called Foulahs.  They are naturally of a mild and gentle disposition; but the uncharitable maxims of the Koran have made them less hospitable to strangers and more reserved in their behaviour than the Mandingoes.  Leaving Bondou, the caravan entered the kingdom of Kajaaga.  The inhabitants, whose complexion is jet-black, are called Serrawoollies. The _dooty_, or chief man of Joag, the frontier town, though a rigid Mahommedan, treated Park very civilly; but while he was staying there a party of horseman, sent by the king, arrived to conduct him to Maana, his residence.  When there, the king demanded enormous duties, and Park had to pay him the five drachms of gold which he had received from the King of Bondou, besides which his baggage was opened and everything of value taken.  His companions now begged him to turn back, and Johnson declared it would be impossible to proceed without money.  He had fortunately concealed some of his property; but they were afraid of purchasing provisions, lest the king should rob him of his few remaining effects.  They therefore resolved to combat hunger during the day and wait for another opportunity of obtaining food.  While seated on the ground, with his servant-boy by his side, a poor woman came up with a basket on her head, and asked Park if he had had his dinner.  The boy replied that the king's people had robbed him of all his money.  On hearing this the good old woman, with a look of unaffected benevolence, took the basket from her head, and presented him with a few handfuls of ground nuts, walking away before he had time to thank her.  Leaving Joag in company with thirty persons and six loaded asses, he rode on cheerfully for some hours till the caravan reached a species of tree for which Johnson had frequently inquired.  On seeing it he produced a white chicken which he had purchased at Joag, tied it by a leg to one of the branches, and then told his companions that they might safely proceed, as the journey would be prosperous.  This incident shows the power of superstition over the minds of negroes; for though this man had resided seven years in England, it was evident that he still retained the superstitions imbibed in his youth.  Koomakary was the birthplace of one of Park's companions from Pisania, a blacksmith, who had been attentive to him on the road.  On approaching the place shouts were raised and muskets were fired.  The meeting between the long-absent blacksmith and his relations was very tender. The younger ones having embraced him, his aged mother was led forth, leaning upon a staff.  Every one made way for her as she stretched out her hands to bid her son welcome.  Being totally blind, she stroked his arms, hands and face with great care, and seemed highly delighted that her ears once more could hear the music of his voice.  \"It was evident,\" observes Park, \"that, whatever may be the difference between the negro and European, there is none in the genuine sympathies and characteristic feelings of our common nature.\"  The king, Dembo Sego, gave the traveller an audience, and appeared well-disposed towards him.  An escort was also sent to conduct him to the frontiers of Kaarta.  The capital of that province was reached on the 12th of February, and as soon as he arrived a messenger came from the king, bidding him welcome, and a large hut was at once provided for his accommodation.  The people, however crowded in till it was completely full; when the first visitors went, another took their place--in this way the hut being filled and emptied thirteen different times.  Park found the king, whose name was Daisy, surrounded by a number of attendants, the fighting men on his right-hand and the women and children on his left.  A bank of earth, on which was spread a leopard-skin, formed the throne.  Daisy seemed perfectly satisfied with the account the traveller gave of himself, but warned him of the dangers in his way on account of the war which was then raging, and advised him to return to Kason, there to remain till it was over.  Wise as this advice was, the approaching hot months made it important for him to proceed, dreading as he did having to spend the rainy season in the interior of Africa.  Daisy presented him with food, and sent a party of horse men to conduct him to Jarra, while three of his sons, with about two hundred horsemen, undertook to accompany him part of the way.  He had evidence of the disturbed state of the country while staying at the next town he entered.  A body of Moors approached the gates and carried off the cattle, and one of the horsemen was shot by a Moor.  The wounded man was brought in, when, as he was borne along, his mother went before, clapping her hands and enumerating the good qualities of her son.  The ball had passed through both his legs, and as he and his friends would not consent to have one of them amputated, he died the same night.  Going forward, on the 18th they passed through Simbug, the frontier village of Ludamar.  It was from hence Major Haughton wrote his last letter, with a pencil, to Dr Laidley.  After leaving the place, when endeavouring to make his way across the desert, he was murdered by some savage Mahommedans, who robbed him of everything he possessed.  At this time, while Daisy was employed in fortifying a strong position among the hills, his territory was overrun by his enemy, Mansong.  On the evening of the 5th of March Park reached the town of Dalli.  Here the people crowded in so disagreeable a manner to see the white stranger, that his host proposed, in order to avoid them, going in the cool of the evening to a negro village called Samee, at a short distance off.  As he was now within two days' journey of the heathen kingdom of Goumba, he had no apprehensions from the Moors, and readily accepted the invitation.  His landlord was proud of the honour of entertaining a white man, and Park spent the forenoon very pleasantly with these poor negroes, their gentleness of manner presenting a striking contrast to the rudeness and barbarity of the Moors.  While thus enjoying himself, greatly to his dismay a party of Moorish soldiers suddenly appeared in the place.  They were sent, they said, by their chief, Ali, to convey the white stranger to his camp at Benowm. If he would come willingly it would be better for him, but come he must, as they had orders to convey him by force; because Fatima, Ali's wife, having heard much about Christians, was anxious to see one.  Park, unable to resist, was compelled to accompany them.  The journey occupied many days, during which both Park and his attendants suffered much from thirst.  On the evening of the 12th they came in sight of Benowm, which presented to the eye a number of dirty-looking tents scattered without order over a large space of ground.  Among the tents appeared large herds of camels, cattle and goats.  As soon as he was seen the people who were drawing water threw down their buckets and, rushing towards him, began to treat him with the greatest discourtesy; one pulled at his clothes, another took off his hat, while a third stopped him to examine his waistcoat buttons.  At length the king's tent was reached, where a number of men and women were assembled.  Ali was seated on a black leather cushion, clipping a few hairs from his upper lip, a female attendant holding up a looking-glass before him.  He enquired whether the stranger could speak Arabic, and being answered in the negative he remained silent.  The ladies, however, asked a thousand questions, inspected his apparel, searched his pockets, and obliged him to unbutton his waistcoat to display the whiteness of his skin.  In the evening the priests announced prayer.  Before they departed his Moorish guide told him that Ali was about to present him with something to eat.  On looking round he saw some boys bringing a wild hog, which they tied to one of the tent ropes, when Ali made signs to him to kill and dress it for supper.  Though very hungry, he did not think it prudent to eat any part of an animal so much detested by the Moors, and therefore replied that he never touched such food.  The hog was then untied, in the hopes that it would run at the stranger, the Moors believing that a great enmity subsists between hogs and Christians.  In this, however, they were disappointed, for the animal no sooner regained his liberty than he began to attack indiscriminately every person who came in his way, and at last took shelter under the couch upon which the king was sitting.  Park was after this conducted to a hut, where he found another wild hog--tied there to a stick for the purpose of annoying him.  It attracted a number of boys, who amused themselves by beating it with sticks, till they so irritated the animal that it ran and bit at every person within reach.  A number of people came in and made him take off his stockings to exhibit his feet, and then his jacket and waistcoat to show them how his clothes were put off and on.  Day after day he was treated in the same manner.  He was also compelled to undertake various offices.  First, he was told to shave the head of one of the young princes, but, unaccustomed to use a razor, he soon "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/214"],["title","In the Days When the World Was Wide, and Other Verses (#1)"],["body","world was wide.   'Twas honest metal and honest wood, in the days of the Outward Bound,  When men were gallant and ships were good -- roaming the wide world round.  The gods could envy a leader then when 'Follow me, lads!' he cried --  They faced each other and fought like men    in the days when the world was wide.   They tried to live as a freeman should -- they were happier men than we,  In the glorious days of wine and blood, when Liberty crossed the sea;  'Twas a comrade true or a foeman then, and a trusty sword well tried --  They faced each other and fought like men    in the days when the world was wide.   The good ship bound for the Southern seas when the beacon was Ballarat,  With a 'Ship ahoy!' on the freshening breeze,    'Where bound?' and 'What ship's that?' --  The emigrant train to New Mexico -- the rush to the Lachlan Side --  Ah! faint is the echo of Westward Ho!    from the days when the world was wide.   South, East, and West in advance of Time -- and, ay! in advance of Thought  Those brave men rose to a height sublime -- and is it for this they fought?  And is it for this damned life we praise the god-like spirit that died  At Eureka Stockade in the Roaring Days    with the days when the world was wide?   We fight like women, and feel as much; the thoughts of our hearts we guard;  Where scarcely the scorn of a god could touch,    the sneer of a sneak hits hard;  The treacherous tongue and cowardly pen, the weapons of curs, decide --  They faced each other and fought like men    in the days when the world was wide.   Think of it all -- of the life that is!  Study your friends and foes!  Study the past!  And answer this:  'Are these times better than those?'  The life-long quarrel, the paltry spite, the sting of your poisoned pride!  No matter who fell it were better to fight    as they did when the world was wide.   Boast as you will of your mateship now -- crippled and mean and sly --  The lines of suspicion on friendship's brow    were traced since the days gone by.  There was room in the long, free lines of the van    to fight for it side by side --  There was beating-room for the heart of a man    in the days when the world was wide.        .    .    .    .    .   With its dull, brown days of a-shilling-an-hour    the dreary year drags round:  Is this the result of Old England's power?    -- the bourne of the Outward Bound?  Is this the sequel of Westward Ho! -- of the days of Whate'er Betide?  The heart of the rebel makes answer 'No!    We'll fight till the world grows wide!'   The world shall yet be a wider world -- for the tokens are manifest;  East and North shall the wrongs be hurled that followed us South and West.  The march of Freedom is North by the Dawn!  Follow, whate'er betide!  Sons of the Exiles, march!  March on!  March till the world grows wide!     Faces in the Street     They lie, the men who tell us in a loud decisive tone  That want is here a stranger, and that misery's unknown;  For where the nearest suburb and the city proper meet  My window-sill is level with the faces in the street --      Drifting past, drifting past,      To the beat of weary feet --  While I sorrow for the owners of those faces in the street.   And cause I have to sorrow, in a land so young and fair,  To see upon those faces stamped the marks of Want and Care;  I look in vain for traces of the fresh and fair and sweet  In sallow, sunken faces that are drifting through the street --      Drifting on, drifting on,      To the scrape of restless feet;  I can sorrow for the owners of the faces in the street.   In hours before the dawning dims the starlight in the sky  The wan and weary faces first begin to trickle by,  Increasing as the moments hurry on with morning feet,  Till like a pallid river flow the faces in the street --      Flowing in, flowing in,      To the beat of hurried feet --  Ah!  I sorrow for the owners of those faces in the street.   The human river dwindles when 'tis past the hour of eight,  Its waves go flowing faster in the fear of being late;  But slowly drag the moments, whilst beneath the dust and heat  The city grinds the owners of the faces in the street --      Grinding body, grinding soul,      Yielding scarce enough to eat --  Oh!  I sorrow for the owners of the faces in the street.   And then the only faces till the sun is sinking down  Are those of outside toilers and the idlers of the town,  Save here and there a face that seems a stranger in the street,  Tells of the city's unemployed upon his weary beat --      Drifting round, drifting round,      To the tread of listless feet --  Ah!  My heart aches for the owner of that sad face in the street.   And when the hours on lagging feet have slowly dragged away,  And sickly yellow gaslights rise to mock the going day,  Then flowing past my window like a tide in its retreat,  Again I see the pallid stream of faces in the street --      Ebbing out, ebbing out,      To the drag of tired feet,  While my heart is aching dumbly for the faces in the street.   And now all blurred and smirched with vice the day's sad pages end,  For while the short 'large hours' toward the longer 'small hours' trend,  With smiles that mock the wearer, and with words that half entreat,  Delilah pleads for custom at the corner of the street --      Sinking down, sinking down,      Battered wreck by tempests beat --  A dreadful, thankless trade is hers, that Woman of the Street.   But, ah! to dreader things than these our fair young city comes,  For in its heart are growing thick the filthy dens and slums,  Where human forms shall rot away in sties for swine unmeet,  And ghostly faces shall be seen unfit for any street --      Rotting out, rotting out,      For the lack of air and meat --  In dens of vice and horror that are hidden from the street.   I wonder would the apathy of wealthy men endure  Were all their windows level with the faces of the Poor?  Ah! Mammon's slaves, your knees shall knock, your hearts in terror beat,  When God demands a reason for the sorrows of the street,      The wrong things and the bad things      And the sad things that we meet  In the filthy lane and alley, and the cruel, heartless street.   I left the dreadful corner where the steps are never still,  And sought another window overlooking gorge and hill;  But when the night came dreary with the driving rain and sleet,  They haunted me -- the shadows of those faces in the street,      Flitting by, flitting by,      Flitting by with noiseless feet,  And with cheeks but little paler than the real ones in the street.   Once I cried:  'Oh, God Almighty! if Thy might doth still endure,  Now show me in a vision for the wrongs of Earth a cure.'  And, lo! with shops all shuttered I beheld a city's street,  And in the warning distance heard the tramp of many feet,      Coming near, coming near,      To a drum's dull distant beat,  And soon I saw the army that was marching down the street.   Then, like a swollen river that has broken bank and wall,  The human flood came pouring with the red flags over all,  And kindled eyes all blazing bright with revolution's heat,  And flashing swords reflecting rigid faces in the street.      Pouring on, pouring on,      To a drum's loud threatening beat,  And the war-hymns and the cheering of the people in the street.   And so it must be while the world goes rolling round its course,  The warning pen shall write in vain, the warning voice grow hoarse,  But not until a city feels Red Revolution's feet  Shall its sad people miss awhile the terrors of the street --      The dreadful everlasting strife      For scarcely clothes and meat  In that pent track of living death -- the city's cruel street.     The Roaring Days     The night too quickly passes   And we are growing old,  So let us fill our glasses   And toast the Days of Gold;  When finds of wondrous treasure   Set all the South ablaze,  And you and I were faithful mates   All through the roaring days!   Then stately ships came sailing   From every harbour's mouth,  And sought the land of promise   That beaconed in the South;  Then southward streamed their streamers   And swelled their canvas full  To speed the wildest dreamers   E'er borne in vessel's hull.   Their shining Eldorado,   Beneath the southern skies,  Was day and night for ever   Before their eager eyes.  The brooding bush, awakened,   Was stirred in wild unrest,  And all the year a human stream   Went pouring to the West.   The rough bush roads re-echoed   The bar-room's noisy din,  When troops of stalwart horsemen   Dismounted at the inn.  And oft the hearty greetings   And hearty clasp of hands  Would tell of sudden meetings   Of friends from other lands;  When, puzzled long, the new-chum   Would recognise at last,  Behind a bronzed and bearded skin,   A comrade of the past.   And when the cheery camp-fire   Explored the bush with gleams,  The camping-grounds were crowded   With caravans of teams;  Then home the jests were driven,   And good old songs were sung,  And choruses were given   The strength of heart and lung.  Oh, they were lion-hearted   Who gave our country birth!  Oh, they were of the stoutest sons   From all the lands on earth!   Oft when the camps were dreaming,   And fires began to pale,  Through rugged ranges gleaming   Would come the Royal Mail.  Behind six foaming horses,   And lit by flashing lamps,  Old 'Cobb and Co.'s', in royal state,   Went dashing past the camps.   Oh, who would paint a goldfield,   And limn the picture right,  As we have often seen it   In early morning's light;  The yellow mounds of mullock   With spots of red and white,  The scattered quartz that glistened   Like diamonds in light;  The azure line of ridges,   The bush of darkest green,  The little homes of calico   That dotted all the scene.   I hear the fall of timber   From distant flats and fells,  The pealing of the anvils   As clear as little bells,  The rattle of the cradle,   The clack of windlass-boles,"]]]
