Old Slegge's along with them, and he'll be getting up a quarrel again. I don't want to fight; but if he keeps on aggravating like he did this morning I suppose I shall have to.\"  \"But if we go now,\" said Singh, \"it will look as if we are frightened. We seemed to run away before, only you made me come.\"  \"Oh, it doesn't matter what seems,\" cried Severn irritably.  \"We know we are not frightened, and that's enough.  Come on.\"  The two boys began to move slowly away; but they had not gone far before Slegge shouted after them, \"Hi, you, sirs!  I want you to come and field.\"  \"Then want will be your master,\" said Severn between his teeth.--\"Come on, Singh.  Don't look round.  Let's pretend we can't hear.\"  They walked steadily on for a few paces, Severn making-believe to be talking earnestly to his companion, when:  \"Do you hear, there, you, sirs?  Come here directly.  I want you to field!\"  \"I dare say you do; cheeky great bully!\" said Glyn softly.  \"I shan't come and field for you.  The Doctor did not give us a holiday to-day to come and be your slaves.\"  \"Hi, there!  Are you coming, or am I to come and fetch you?\" shouted Slegge, without any effect, and the big lad turned to Burney and gave him an order.  The next minute the boy, armed with a stump, came running at full speed across the grass, shouting to the two companions to stop, but without their paying the slightest heed or increasing their pace.  The consequence was that the lad soon overtook them, to cry, rather out of breath, \"Did you hear the captain call to you to come and field?\"  Singh glanced at Glyn, who gave him a sharp look as he replied, \"Yes, I heard him quite plainly.\"  The messenger stared with open eyes and mouth, as if it was beyond his comprehension.  \"Then, why don't you come?\" he cried.  \"Because we are going up to the house,\" replied Glyn coolly, \"to our dormitory.\"  \"That you are not,\" cried Burney.  \"The rules say that the fellows are not to go up to their rooms between hours, and you have been here long enough to know that.  Now then, no nonsense.  Here, you, Singh, you've got to come and field while old Slegge practises batting, and Tompkins has got to bowl.\"  As the boy spoke in an unpleasant dictatorial way he made a thrust at Singh with the pointed stump he held; but quick as thought and before it was driven home, this third-part of a wicket was wrenched from his hand by Severn and sent flying through the air.  \"How dare you!\" shouted Burney, and he made a rush at Glyn to collar him and make him prisoner; but before he could reach the offending lad a foot was thrust out by Singh, over which he tripped and fell sprawling upon his face.  \"Oh!\" he shouted, half-beside himself with rage; and, scrambling up, he made a rush with clenched fists at the two boys, who now stood perfectly still awaiting his onslaught.  It was a thoroughly angry charge, but not a charge home; for Burney stopped some three or four yards short of the distance, with his rage evaporating fast and beginning to feel quite discreet.  For quite a minute the opponents stood gazing fiercely, and then what had threatened to become a cuffing encounter became verbal.  \"Look here,\" cried Burney, \"you two will get it for this.  What am I to say to the captain?\"  \"Tell him to bowl for himself,\" said Singh sharply.  \"Here!  Hi!  Burney, bring 'em along!\" came from across the field and from between Slegge's hands.  \"Tell these beggars they had better not keep me waiting much longer!\"  \"All right!\" shouted back Burney; and then to the two lads, \"There, you hear.  Come on at once, and as you are new chaps I won't tell on you. You had better come, or he'll pay you out by keeping you on bowling so that you can't go and see the show.\"  \"Yes,\" said Glyn quietly.  \"Go back and tell him what Singh said.\"  \"What!\" cried Burney, staring with wonder.  \"Tell the captain he's to bowl for himself?\"  \"Yes,\" said Glyn coolly, \"as long as he likes.--Come along, Singh;\" and, throwing his arm over his Indian companion's shoulder, the two lads fell into military step and marched slowly towards the Doctor's mansion-like house.  \"I am afraid it means a fight, Singh,\" said Glyn quietly.  \"Well, I dare say we can get over it.  I am not going to knuckle down to that fellow. Are you?\"  \"Am I?\" cried the boy, flashing a fierce look at his English companion. \"What do you think?\"  Glyn laughed softly and merrily.  \"Shall I tell you?\" he said.  \"Yes, of course,\" cried the Indian boy hotly.  \"Well, I think you will.\"  \"What!\"  \"When you can't lift hand or foot, and your eyes are closing up so as you can hardly see.\"  \"And I won't give up then!\" cried the boy passionately.  \"Well, don't get into a wax about it, old chap,\" said Glyn in a dry, slow way.  \"I don't suppose you'll have to, for the big chuckle-headed bully will have to lick me first, and I dare say I can manage to tire him so that you can easily lick him in turn.\"  \"You are not going to fight him,\" cried Singh hotly.  \"Yes, I am.\"  \"You are not.  He insulted my dead father.  A mahout indeed!\"  \"So he did mine,\" said Glyn.  \"A shabby half-pay military officer indeed!  I'll make _him_ look shabby before I have done.\"  \"Now, look here,\" cried Singh, \"don't be a beast, Glynny, and make me more angry than I am.  I am bad enough as it is.\"  \"So am I, so don't you get putting on the Indian tyrant.  Recollect you are in England now.  This is my job, and I know if father were here he'd say I was to have the first go in.  He's such a big fellow that I believe he'll lick me easily.  But, as I said before, I shall pretty well tire him out, and then you being the reserve, he'll come at you, and then he'll find out his mistake.  And I say, Singhy, old chap, I do hope that my eyes won't be so closed that I can't see.  Now then, come up to our room.  It's a holiday, and the rules won't count to-day.  Come on, and we'll talk it over.\"  \"But--\" began Singh.  \"Now, don't be obstinate.  You promised father you'd try and give way to me over English matters.  Now, didn't you?\"  \"Well,\" said the lad hesitatingly, \"I suppose I did.\"  \"Come on, then.  You see war's begun, and we have got to settle our plan of campaign.\"  The young Maharajah nodded his head and smiled.  \"Yes,\" he said, \"come up to our room.  We ought to dress, oughtn't we, to see the procession?  I say, I don't know how it is, I always like fighting against any one who tries to bully.  I am not sorry that war has begun.\"  \"Neither am I,\" said the English lad quietly, \"for things have been very unpleasant ever since we came here, and when we've got this over perhaps we shall be at peace.\"    CHAPTER THREE.  THE PRINCE'S REGALIA.  The bedroom shared by Glyn Severn and Singh was one of a series, small and particularly comfortable, in the new annexe the Doctor had built expressly for lecture-room and dormitories when his establishment began to increase.  The comfortably furnished room just sufficed for two narrow beds and the customary furniture; and as soon as the two lads had entered, Singh hurried to his chest of drawers, unlocked one, took out a second bunch of keys to that he carried in his pocket, and was then crossing to a sea-going portmanteau standing in one corner, when Glyn, who was looking very thoughtful and abstracted, followed, and as Singh knelt down and threw open the travelling-case, laid his hand upon the lad's shoulder. \"What are you going to do?\" he said shortly.  \"Only look out two or three things that there's not room for in the drawer.\"  \"What for?\"  \"Why, to dress for the procession.\"  \"Stuff and nonsense!  You are quite right as you are,\" cried Glyn half-mockingly.  \"You must learn to remember that you are in England, where nobody dresses up except soldiers.  Why, what were you going to do?\"  \"I was going to put on a white suit and belt.\"  \"Nonsense!\" cried Glyn.  \"This isn't India, but Devonshire.  Why, if you were to come down dressed like that the boys would all laugh at you, and the crowd out in the road shout and cheer.\"  \"Well, of course,\" said Singh; \"they'd see I was a prince.\"  \"Oh, what a rum fellow you are!\" cried Glyn, gripping his companion's shoulders and laughingly shaking him to and fro.  \"I thought that I had made you understand that now we are over here you were to dress just the same as an English boy.  Why, don't you know that when we had a king in England he used to dress just like any ordinary gentleman, only sometimes he would wear a star on his breast.\"  \"Oh, but surely,\" began Singh, in a disappointed tone, \"he must have--\"  \"Yes, yes, yes; sometimes,\" cried Glyn.  \"I know what you mean.  On state occasions, or when he went to review troops, he would wear grand robes or a field-marshal's uniform.\"  \"But didn't he wear his crown?\"  \"No,\" cried Glyn, bursting out laughing.  \"That's only put on for a little while when he's made king.\"  \"What does he do with it, then, at other times?\"  \"Nothing,\" cried Glyn merrily.  \"It's kept shut up in a glass case at the Tower, for people to go and see.\"  \"England seems a queer place,\" said Singh quietly.  \"Very,\" cried Glyn drily.  \"You never want those Indian clothes, and you ought to have done as I told you--left them behind.\"  \"But the Colonel didn't say so,\" replied the boy warmly.  \"He said that some day he might take me with him to Court.  It was when "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21315"],["title","The King's Sons (#1)"],["body"," the eldest brother; \"we can shoot an arrow with any of you. Pick out your four best men, Jarl Cerda, and we'll shoot against them.\"  \"Yes,\" said another.  \"You know we can shoot well.\"  \"Do I not?\" said the jarl; \"for I taught you.\"  \"Yes, yes; they can all shoot well,\" came in concert.  \"Oh, yes, they can shoot,\" said the leader; \"but I have no time to prove it.\"  \"Of course not,\" cried Alfred.  \"Never mind that.  Lead on.\"  \"I'm afraid we should never catch the Danes if you boys came,\" said the jarl solemnly.  \"Why?\" cried Bald, the eldest.  \"Yes, why shouldn't we?\" cried Ethelred.  \"Don't ask him,\" said Alfred, frowning.  \"Why?\"  \"Look at his eyes and the corners of his mouth.  He's laughing at us.\"  The big jarl's shoulders began to shake, and his lids half-closed in his mirth, while the eyes of all four boys flashed in their anger.  \"Why, of course I'm laughing, my boys,\" he said; \"but it's not out of a desire to mock at you.  I know you, my brave little fellows, and I hope to come back safe, and to see you all grow up to stark men who will deal well with the Norsemen.  But you must wait a bit.\"  \"No, no,\" cried Alfred.  \"We can stand back and shoot.\"  \"So can the Danes, my boy; and their arrows are sharp.\"  \"But we can shoot sharper and quicker than they,\" said Ethelred.  \"Oh, do take us, Jarl Cerda.\"  \"No, my boy,\" said the stout Saxon noble firmly; \"I cannot take you. The King stood by and picked out my men, and he said I was to take these and no more.  Would you have me give pain to our good Queen Osburga by breaking the King's commands?\"  \"No,\" said Alfred, with a quick, old-fashioned look.  \"We cannot do that, boys.\"  \"Come, that's bravely spoken, Alfred, boy; I like that,\" said the jarl, leaning down from his horse to pat the youngest boy on the shoulder. \"Look here, if I come back safely after beating the Danes I'll bring you one of their winged helmets for a prize.\"  \"You will?\" cried Alfred.  \"I promise you I will, my boy,\" cried the big Saxon noble, \"and trophies for your brothers too.--There, we must go on.  Good-bye, my brave boys. Give them a shout, my lads.\"  The men waved sword and spear in the air as they marched off and Alfred and his brothers stood watching them till the last twinkling spear had disappeared in the distance, and then the boys turned away with a sigh.  \"Oh, I wish I was a man!\" said Alfred sadly.  \"No use to wish,\" said the next brother.  \"Here, let's go on down the stream to get some fish.\"  The disappointment was soon forgotten, and the boys dashed off downhill as hard as they could go, neither of them hearing a shout, nor seeing the little monk come panting up, to stand gazing ruefully after them and wiping the great drops of perspiration off his face and head.  \"Oh, dear!\" he said; \"it's a fine thing to be young and strong, and--\"  He paused for a few moments to look down at his plump proportions.  \"--And light,\" he added sadly.  \"I can't run as they do.\"  He stood perfectly still as he spoke, watching the deep crease in the valley, whose bottom was hidden by clumps of willow and beds of reeds with their dark purply waving blooms.  \"I suppose I must go after them,\" he sighed.  \"What can they want down there?\"  The little monk sighed again and then started off to follow the boys, trying hard to walk slowly and steadily; but it was all in vain.  The hill-side sloped very steeply to the broad bed of willows and reeds far below, making the way very bad for so heavy and inactive a man.  Worse still: walking over the short grass in the hot sun had made the bottoms of the monk's sandals as slippery as glass, and so it was that before he had gone far down the slope he began to talk to himself, at first slowly--then quickly--then in a loud excited way--and lastly he uttered a shout and a cry for help.  \"Here,\" he said, at first, \"I want to go down slowly.  It's too hot to walk fast.  Steady!  Why, I am going faster!\"  Then there was a minute's pause, and the monk cried excitedly:  \"I don't want to run.\"  Then: \"Oh, dear me, however am I to stop myself?\"  And directly after: \"Oh, do stop me, somebody, or I shall be broken all to bits.\"  And lastly: \"Here, help, help, help!\"  Then there was a loud crashing sound, some water flew up, the monk uttered a final \"Oh!\" and lay perfectly still, listening, for all at once a familiar voice cried:  \"Oh, come here, quick!  A sheep has gone plosh into the pool.\"  Boys were as much boys then as they are now, for directly after these words were uttered Alfred--the Little then--came hurrying as fast as the water would let him wade--splash, splash, splash!--from where he and his brothers had been busily making a dam across the little stream to turn the rushing water aside into another channel so as to leave the unfortunate trout helpless and ready for capture, and as soon as he caught sight of his teacher lying perfectly still he burst into a fit of hearty laughter.  \"Come and look!  Come and look!\" he shouted.  His brothers wanted no further telling, but came splashing up out of the stream to the open shallow muddy bed where the reeds grew, and as soon as they saw the monk's condition they began to indulge in a bare-legged triumphal war-dance, shrieking with laughter the while.  \"Bad boys; bad, thoughtless, wicked boys!\" grunted Father Swythe; but he lay perfectly still with arms and legs spread apart as far as they would go.  \"Why don't you stand up and walk out?\" cried Fred, at last, taking compassion on his tutor's awkward plight.  \"Because I'm so heavy, boy: I should sink.\"  \"Oh, no.  It isn't deep there.  I've often waded about there to look for moorhens' nests.\"  \"Yes, my boy; but you're young and light.  I'm very heavy.\"  \"Yes,\" cried one of the others, in high delight; \"there's an arrow depth of water where you are, and quite a bow length of thick mud under that.\"  \"Oh, dear!\" groaned the monk; \"don't laugh at me, my boys.  Can't you help me out?\"  \"Yes, I'll get you out,\" cried Alfred, and he waded towards his unfortunate tutor, trampling the reeds down with his bare feet, but sinking in up to his knees at every step.  \"Mind you don't get into a hole, Fred!\" cried Bald.  \"Mind the big luces!\" shouted Bert.  \"There's a monster lives among those reeds.\"  \"Oh, they all swam away when Father Swythe fell in,\" cried Red.  \"You have got to mind your toes.  The big eels are down amongst the mud.\"  The monk groaned at this, and raised his dripping hands above the water, to grasp with each a handful of reeds.  \"The eels will go deeper into the mud,\" said Alfred sturdily.  \"Now then, catch hold of my hands, and I'll pull you out.\"  The monk raised one hand very cautiously, and Alfred seized it tightly and began to back, pulling with all his might; but he pulled in vain, for he did not move his tutor an inch.  \"Here, I know,\" cried Alfred.  \"You two come and join hands and pull.\"  \"I'm afraid I'm too heavy,\" said Father Swythe.  \"I shan't help,\" said Bald maliciously.  \"Let him stop where he is.\"  The monk groaned again, and the three boys outside the reeds laughed with malicious glee.  \"If we pull him out he'll only take us back and begin to teach us to read.\"  \"Yes, yes, yes,\" sighed Father Swythe; \"I came to fetch you in.  The Queen sent me.\"  \"Then we won't help you,\" said Bert; laughing.  \"Let's go and finish getting our fish, and then go back.  When they ask where he is we'll tell them, and then some of the shepherds can come with wattle hurdles and get him out.\"  \"Oh, dear!\" groaned the monk.  \"After all my teaching, for you boys to be as bad as this!  Why, if you leave me I shall be drowned!\"  \"Oh, no,\" said Red merrily.  \"You've only to keep holding your face up.\"  \"Yes,\" said Bert; \"and that will send your legs down till you'll be standing up in the mud and water.\"  \"And all the big flies and things will come and buzz about and settle on your crown.  Come along, Fred, and finish the dam.\"  \"If we finish the dam,\" said Alfred seriously, \"all the water will run in here and make it deeper.\"  \"Well, then he can swim out.  You can swim, can't you?\"  \"No, no, no,\" said the monk sadly.  \"I never learned.\"  \"What a pity!\" said Red, laughing.  \"You ought to have learned to swim instead of learning so much Latin,\" cried Bert.  \"There isn't time to learn everything, my boys,\" said the monk sadly. \"I'm obliged to try and teach you all: the King and Queen sent for me that I might.  Please help me out.\"  \"We're not going to,\" cried Bald.  \"Come along, boys.  He ought to have learned to swim.\"  Bald began to move away, and the monk groaned again.  \"Come along, Fred,\" cried Bert, and the monk turned his head sidewise so as to look piteously at the youngest boy.  \"No, I'm not coming.  I'm going to stop and help Father Swythe.\"  \"Hah!\" sighed the monk, and he squeezed Alfred's hand.  \"No, you're not,\" cried Bald fiercely; \"you're coming with us.  Come along.  He will not sink.\"  \"I shan't come!\" said Alfred sturdily.  \"What?  Here, boys, let's fetch him out.\"  There was a rush made towards where the boy stood knee-deep, and he snatched his hand free from the monk's grasp, turned half-round, stooped a little, and as his eldest brother came wading in among the reeds he scooped up the water and saluted him with a heavy shower right in the face, drenching him so that he turned tail and hurried back, the other two laughingly backing out of reach.  \"Oh, you!\" shouted.  Bald.  \"Come out, or I'll hold you right under the water till you can't breathe.\"  \"Come along then,\" cried Alfred boldly, and he sent another shower of water after his brother, wetting him behind now.  \"You'll be just as wet as I shall first.\"  \"You come out!\"  \"I shan't!  You come here, if you dare!\"  \"Come and help me, boys,\" cried Bald; but the others only laughed.  \"Come yourself, if you dare!  Father Swythe will help me, and we'll duck you.\"  \"Urrr!\" growled Bald, stamping with rage.  Then: \"Never mind, boys: let them stop together.  Give him a Latin lesson, Father Swythe.\"  \"You stop a "]]]
