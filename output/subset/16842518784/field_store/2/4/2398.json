New, beautiful, and ever-changing scenes were being constantly opened up to the view of the _voyageurs_, whose plaintive and beautiful canoe-songs were rolling over the waters.  Suddenly the song ceased as the distant roar of a waterfall struck their ears, and the steersmen-- for there are usually two, one in the bow and one in the stern--prepared to land and \"_make a portage_,\"--that is, carry the canoe and lading past the falls by land, and re-launch and re-load in the smooth water below.  The approach to the landing-place at the head of the fall was somewhat difficult, owing to a point of rock which projected into the stream in the direction of the fall, and round which point it was necessary to steer with some dexterity, in order to avoid being drawn into the strong current.  The fearless guides, however, had often passed the place in former years in safety, and accordingly dashed at the point with reckless indifference, their paddles flinging a circle of spray over their heads as they changed from side to side with graceful but vigorous rapidity.  The swift stream carried them quickly round the point of danger, and they had almost reached the quiet eddy near the landing-place when the stem of the canoe was caught by the current, which instantly whirled it out from the shore and carried it down stream like an arrow.  Another moment, and the gushing water dragged them to the verge of the fall, which thundered and foamed among frightful chasms and rocks many feet below.  It was the work of a moment.  The stern of the canoe almost overhung the abyss, and the voyageurs plied their paddles with the desperation of men who felt that their lives depended on the exertions of the next awful minute.  For a few seconds the canoe remained stationary, and seemed to tremble on the brink of destruction-- the strength of the water and the power of the men being almost equally balanced--then, inch by inch, it began slowly to ascend the stream.  The danger was past!  A few nervous strokes, and the canoe shot out of the current like an arrow, and floated in safety in the still water below the point.  The whole thing, from beginning to end, occurred in a few seconds; but who can describe or comprehend the tumultuous gush of feeling aroused during those brief moments in the bosoms of the _voyageurs_?  The sudden, electric change from tranquil safety to the verge of what appeared certain destruction--and then, deliverance!  It was one of those thrilling incidents which frequently occur to those who thread the wildernesses of this world, and is little thought of by them beyond the moment of danger; yet it was one of those solemn seasons, more or less numerous in the history of all men, when the Almighty speaks to his careless creatures in a voice that cannot be mistaken, however much it may be slighted; awakening them, with a rough grasp, to behold the slender cord that suspends them over the abyss of eternity.  The canoes used by the Eskimos who inhabit the Polar Regions are made of a light framework of wood, which is covered entirely over with seal-skin--a round hole being left in the centre, in which the Eskimo sits.  Round this hole there is a loose piece of skin, which is drawn up by the man and fastened round his waist.  The machine is thus completely water-tight.  No waves can dash into, although they can sweep over it; and if by chance it should upset, the Eskimo can turn it and himself up into the proper position by one dexterous sweep of his long, double-bladed paddle.  The paddle, which varies from ten to fifteen feet, is simply a pole with a blade at each end.  It is grasped in the centre, and each end dipped alternately on either side of the _kayak_, as this canoe is called.  Eskimo kayaks are first-rate sea-boats.  They can face almost any sort of weather.  They are extremely light, and are propelled by the natives very swiftly.  In these frail canoes the natives of the Polar Regions pursue seals and whales, and even venture to attack the walrus in his native element.  The kayak is used exclusively by the men.  The oomiak, or women's canoe, is of much larger and clumsier construction, somewhat like a boat.  It is open above, and can hold a large family of women and children.  Like the kayak, it is a framework of wood covered with seal-skin, and is propelled by means of short paddles of the spoon form.  The famous \"Rob Roy\" canoe, which is now so much in vogue among boys and young men of aquatic tendency, is constructed and managed on precisely the same principles with the Eskimo kayak; the only difference between the two being that the \"Rob Roy\" canoe is made of thin wood instead of skin, and is altogether a more elegant vessel.  An account of it will be found in our chapter on \"Boats.\"  The South Sea islanders also use a canoe which they propel with a double-bladed paddle similar to that of the Eskimos.  They are wonderfully expert and fearless in the management of this canoe, as may be seen from the annexed woodcut.  In order to show that the paddle of the canoe is more natural to man than the oar, we present a picture of the canoe used by the Indians of the Amazon in South America.  Here we see thar the savages of the south, like their brethren of the north, sit with their faces to the bow and urge their bark forward by neans of short paddles, without using the gunwale as a fulcrum.  The oar is decidedly a more modern and a more scientific instrument than the paddle, but the latter is better suited to some kinds of navigation than the former.  Very different indeed from the light canoes just described are the canoes of the South Sea islanders.  Some are large, and some are small; some long, some short; a few elegant, a few clumsy; and one or two peculiarly remarkable.  Most of them are narrow, and liable to upset; in order to prevent which catastrophe the natives have ingeniously, though clumsily, contrived a sort of \"_outrigger_,\" or plank, which they attach to the side of the canoe to keep it upright.  They also fasten two canoes together to steady them.  One of these _double canoes_ is thus described by Cheever in his \"Island World of the Pacific:\"--\"A double canoe is composed of two single ones of the same size placed parallel to each other, three or four feet apart, and secured in their places by four or five pieces of wood, curved just in the shape of a bit-stock.  These are lashed to both canoes with the strongest cinet, made of cocoa-nut fibre, so as to make the two almost as much one as same of the double ferry-boats that ply between Brooklyn and New York.  A flattened arch is thus made by the bow-like cross-pieces over the space between the canoes, upon which a board or a couple of stout poles laid lengthwise constitute an elevated platform for passengers and freight, while those who paddle and steer sit in the bodies of the canoes at the sides.  A slender mast, which may be unstepped in a minute, rises from about the centre of this platform, to give support to a very simple sail, now universally made of white cotton cloth, but formerly of mats.\"  The double canoes belonging to the chiefs of the South Sea islanders are the largest,--some of them being nearly seventy feet long, yet they are each only about two feet wide and three or four feet deep.  The sterns are remarkably high--fifteen or eighteen feet above the water.  The war canoes are also large and compactly built; the stern being low and covered, so as to afford shelter from stones and darts.  A rude imitation of a head or some grotesque figure is usually carved on the stern; while the stem is elevated, curved like the neck of a swan, and terminates frequently in the carved figure of a bird's head.  These canoes are capable of holding fifty warriors.  Captain Cook describes some as being one hundred and eight feet long.  All of them, whether single or double, mercantile or war canoes, are propelled by paddles, the men sitting with their faces in the direction in which they are going.  As may be supposed, these canoes are often upset in rough weather; but as the South Sea islanders are expert swimmers, they generally manage to right their canoes and scramble into them again.  Their only fear on such occasions is being attacked by sharks.  Ellis, in his interesting book, \"Polynesian Researches,\" relates an instance of this kind of attack which was made upon a number of chiefs and people--about thirty-two--who were passing from one island to another in a large double canoe:--\"They were overtaken by a tempest, the violence of which tore their canoes from the horizontal spars by which they were united. It was in vain for them to endeavour to place them upright again, or to empty out the water, for they could not prevent their incessant overturning.  As their only resource, they collected the scattered spars and boards, and constructed a raft, on which they hoped they might drift to land.  The weight of the whole number who were collected on the raft was so great as to sink it so far below the surface that they stood above their knees in water.  They made very little progress, and soon became exhausted by fatigue and hunger.  In this condition they were attacked by a number of sharks.  Destitute of a knife or any other weapon of defence, they fell an easy prey to these rapacious monsters. One after another was seized and devoured, or carried away by them, and the survivors, who with dreadful anguish beheld their companions thus destroyed, saw the number of their assailants apparently increasing, as each body was carried off until only two or three remained.  \"The raft, thus lightened of its load, rose to the surface of the water, and placed them beyond the reach of the voracious jaws of their relentless destroyers.  The tide and current soon carried them to the shore, where they landed to tell the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21750"],["title","Martin Rattler (#1)"],["body","panes as Martin flew across it.  The paling that fenced it off from the fields beyond was low, but too high for a jump.  Never a boy in all the school had crossed that paling at a spring, without laying his hands upon it; but Martin did.  We do not mean to say that he did anything superhuman; but he rushed at it like a charge of cavalry, sprang from the ground like a deer, kicked away the top bar, tumbled completely over, landed on his head, and rolled down the slope on the other side as fast as he could have run down,--perhaps faster.  It would have required sharper eyes than yours or mine to have observed how Martin got on his legs again, but he did it in a twinkling, and was half across the field almost before you could wink, and panting on the heels of Bob Croaker.  Bob saw him coming and instantly started off at a hard run, followed by the whole school.  A few minutes brought them to the banks of the stream, where Bob Croaker halted, and, turning round, held the white kitten up by the nape of the neck.  \"O spare it! spare it, Bob!--don't do it--please don't, don't do it!\" gasped Martin, as he strove in vain to run faster.  \"There you go!\" shouted Bob, with a coarse laugh, sending the kitten high into the air, whence it fell with a loud splash into the water.  It was a dreadful shock to feline nerves, no doubt, but that white kitten was no ordinary animal.  Its little heart beat bravely when it rose to the surface, and, before its young master came up, it had regained the bank.  But, alas! what a change!  It went into the stream a fat, round, comfortable ball of eider-down.  It came out a scraggy blotch of white paint, with its black eyes glaring like two great glass beads!  No sooner did it crawl out of the water than Bob Croaker seized it, and whirled it round his head, amid suppressed cries of \"Shame!\" intending to throw it in again; but at that instant Martin Rattler seized Bob by the collar of his coat with both hands, and, letting himself drop suddenly, dragged the cruel boy to the ground, while the kitten crept humbly away and hid itself in a thick tuft of grass.  A moment sufficed to enable Bob Croaker, who was nearly twice Martin's weight, to free himself from the grasp of his panting antagonist, whom he threw on his back, and doubled his fist, intending to strike Martin on the face; but a general rush of the boys prevented this.  \"Shame, shame, fair-play!\" cried several; \"don't hit him when he's down!\"  \"Then let him rise up and come on!\" cried Bob, fiercely, as he sprang up and released Martin.  \"Ay, that's fair.  Now then, Martin, remember the kitten!\"  \"Strike men of your own size!\" cried several of the bigger boys, as they interposed to prevent Martin from rushing into the unequal contest.  \"So I will,\" cried Bob Croaker, glaring round with passion.  \"Come on any of you that likes.  I don't care a button for the biggest of you.\"  No one accepted this challenge, for Bob was the oldest and the strongest boy in the school, although, as is usually the case with bullies, by no means the bravest.  Seeing that no one intended to fight with him, and that a crowd of boys strove to hold Martin Rattler back, while they assured him that he had not the smallest chance in the world, Bob turned towards the kitten, which was quietly and busily employed in licking itself dry and said, \"Now Martin, you coward, I'll give it another swim for your impudence.\"  \"Stop, stop!\" cried Martin, earnestly.  \"Bob Croaker, I would rather do anything than fight.  I would give you everything I have to save my kitten; but if you won't spare it unless I fight, I'll do it.  If you throw it in before you fight me, you're the greatest coward that ever walked.  Just give me five minutes to breathe and a drink of water, and I'll fight you as long as I can stand.\"  Bob looked at his little foe in surprise.  \"Well, that's fair.  I'm you're man; but if you don't lick me I'll drown the kitten, that's all.\" Having said this, he quietly divested himself of his jacket and neckcloth, while several boys assisted Martin to do the same, and brought him a draught of water in the crown of one of their caps.  In five minutes all was ready, and the two boys stood face to face and foot to foot, with their fists doubled and revolving, and a ring of boys around them.  Just at this critical moment the kitten, having found the process of licking itself dry more fatiguing than it had expected, gave vent to a faint mew of distress.  It was all that was wanting to set Martin's indignant heart into a blaze of inexpressible fury.  Bob Croaker's visage instantly received a shower of sharp, stinging blows, that had the double effect of taking that youth by surprise and throwing him down upon the green sward.  But Martin could not hope to do this a second time.  Bob now knew the vigour of his assailant, and braced himself warily to the combat, commencing operations by giving Martin a tremendous blow on the point of his nose, and another on the chest. These had the effect of tempering Martin's rage with a salutary degree of caution, and of eliciting from the spectators sundry cries of warning on the one hand, and admiration on the other, while the young champions revolved warily round each other, and panted vehemently.  The battle that was fought that day was one of a thousand.  It created as great a sensation in the village school as did the battle of Waterloo in England.  It was a notable fight; such as had not taken place within the memory of the oldest boy in the village, and from which, in after years, events of juvenile history were dated,--especially pugilistic events, of which, when a good one came off it used to be said that, \"such a battle had not taken place since the year of the Great Fight.\" Bob Croaker was a noted fighter, Martin Rattler was, up to this date, an untried hero.  Although fond of rough play and boisterous mischief, he had an unconquerable aversion to _earnest_ fighting, and very rarely indeed returned home with a black eye,--much to the satisfaction of Aunt Dorothy Grumbit, who objected to all fighting from principle, and frequently asserted, in gentle tones, that there should be no soldiers or sailors (fighting sailors, she meant) at all, but that people ought all to settle everything the best way they could without fighting, and live peaceably with one another, as the Bible told them to do.  They would be far happier and better off, she was sure of that; and if everybody was of her way of thinking, there would be neither swords, nor guns, nor pistols, nor squibs, nor anything else at all!  Dear old lady. It would indeed be a blessing if her principles could be carried out in this warring and jarring world.  But as this is rather difficult, what we ought to be careful about is, that we never fight except in a good cause and with a clear conscience.  It was well for Martin Rattler, on that great day, that the formation of the ground favoured him.  The spot on which the fight took place was uneven, and covered with little hillocks and hollows, over which Bob Croaker stumbled, and into which he fell,--being a clumsy boy on his legs--and did himself considerable damage; while Martin, who was firmly knit and active as a kitten, scarcely ever fell, or, if he did, sprang up again like an India-rubber ball.  Fair-play was embedded deep in the centre of Martin's heart, so that he scorned to hit his adversary when he was down or in the act of rising; but the thought of the fate that awaited the white kitten if he were conquered, acted like lightning in his veins, and scarcely had Bob time to double his fists after a fall, when he was knocked back again into the hollow, out of which he had risen.  There were no _rounds_ in this fight; no pausing to recover breath.  Martin's anger rose with every blow, whether given or received; and although he was knocked down flat four or five times, he rose again, and without a second's delay rushed headlong at his enemy.  Feeling that he was too little and light to make much impression on Bob Croaker by means of mere blows, he endeavoured as much as possible to throw his weight against him at each assault; but Bob stood his ground well, and after a time seemed even to be recovering strength a little.  Suddenly he made a rush at Martin, and, dealing him a successful blow on the forehead, knocked him down; at the same time he himself tripped over a molehill and fell upon his face.  Both were on their legs in an instant.  Martin grew desperate.  The white kitten swimming for its life seemed to rise before him, and new energy was infused into his frame.  He retreated a step or two, and then darted forward like an arrow from a bow.  Uttering a loud cry, he sprang completely in the air and plunged--head and fists together, as if he were taking a dive--into Bob Croaker's bosom!  The effect was tremendous.  Bob went down like a shock of grain before the sickle; and having, in their prolonged movements, approached close to the brink of the stream, both he and Martin went with a sounding splash into the deep pool and disappeared. It was but for a moment, however.  Martin's head emerged first, with eyes and mouth distended to the utmost.  Instantly, on finding bottom, he turned to deal his opponent another blow; but it was not needed. When Bob Croaker's head rose to the surface there was no motion in the features, and the eyes were closed.  The intended blow was changed into a friendly grasp; and, exerting himself to the utmost, Martin dragged his insensible school fellow to the bank, where, in a few minutes, he recovered sufficiently to declare in a sulky tone that he would fight no more!  \"Bob Croaker,\" said Martin, holding out his hand, \"I'm sorry we've had to fight.  I wouldn't have done it, but to save my kitten.  You compelled me to do it, you know that.  Come, let's be friends again.\"  Bob made no reply, but slowly and with some difficulty put on his vest and jacket.  \"I'm sure,\" continued Martin, \"there's"]]]
