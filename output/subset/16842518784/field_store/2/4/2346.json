Tim knew that he had a plan of some sort in his head, and, having perfect faith in his capacity, forbore to advise him, or even to speak.  He merely drew his hunting-knife, and urged his steed to its utmost speed, for every moment of time was precious.  The said hunting-knife was one of which Little Tim was peculiarly fond.  It had been presented to him by a Mexican general for conspicuous gallantry in saving the life of one of his officers in circumstances of extreme danger.  It was unusually long and heavy, and, being double-edged, bore some resemblance to the short, sword of the ancient Romans.  \"It'll do some execution before I go down,\" thought Tim, as he regarded the bright blade with an earnest look.  But Tim was wrong.  The blade was not destined to be tarnished that day.  In a very few minutes the two horsemen galloped to the thicket which had concealed the enemy.  Entering this they dashed through it as fast as possible until they reached the other side, whence they could see the combatants on the plain beyond.  All along they had heard the shouts and yells of battle.  For one moment Whitewing drew up to breathe his gallant steed, but the animal was roused by that time, and it was difficult to restrain him. His companion's horse was also nearly unmanageable.  \"My brother's voice is strong.  Let him use it well,\" said the chief abruptly.  \"Ay, ay,\" replied the little trapper, with an intelligent chuckle; \"go ahead, my boy.  I'll give it out fit to bu'st the bellows.\"  Instantly Whitewing shot from the wood, like the panther rushing on his prey, uttering at the same time the tremendous war-cry of his tribe. Little Tim followed suit with a roar that was all but miraculous in its tone and character, and may be described as a compound of the steam-whistle and the buffalo bull, only with something about it intensely human.  It rose high above the din of battle.  The combatants heard and paused.  The two horsemen were seen careering towards them with furious gesticulations.  Red Indians seldom face certain death. The Blackfoot men knew that an attack by only two men would be sheer insanity; the natural conclusion was that they were the leaders of a band just about to emerge from the thicket.  They were thus taken in rear.  A panic seized them, which was intensified when Little Tim repeated his roar and flourished the instrument of death, which he styled his \"little carving-knife.\"  The Blackfeet turned and fled right and left, scattering over the plains individually and in small groups, as being the best way of baffling pursuit.  With that sudden access of courage which usually results from the exhibition of fear in a foe, Bald Eagle's men yelled and gave chase. Bald Eagle himself, however, had the wisdom to call them back.  At a council of war, hastily summoned on the spot, he said--  \"My braves, you are a parcel of fools.\"  Clearing his throat after this plain statement, either for the purpose of collecting his thoughts or giving his young warriors time to weigh and appreciate the compliment, he continued--  \"You chase the enemy as thoughtlessly as the north wind chases the leaves in autumn.  My wise chief Whitewing, and his friend Leetil Tim-- whose heart is big, and whose voice is bigger, and whose scalping-knife is biggest of all--have come to our rescue _alone_.  Whitewing tells me there is no one at their backs.  If our foes discover their mistake, they will turn again, and the contempt which they ought to pour on themselves because of their own cowardice they will heap on _our_ heads, and overwhelm us by their numbers--for who can withstand numbers?  They will scatter us like small dust before the hurricane.  Waugh!\"  The old man paused for breath, for the recent fight had taken a good deal out of him, and the assembled warriors exclaimed \"Waugh!\" by which they meant to express entire approval of his sentiments.  \"Now it is my counsel,\" he continued, \"that as we have been saved by Whitewing, we should all shut our mouths, and hear what Whitewing has got to say.\"  Bald Eagle sat down amid murmurs of applause, and Whitewing arose.  There was something unusually gentle in the tone and aspect of the young chief on this occasion.  \"Our father, the ancient one who has just spoken words of wisdom,\" he said, stretching forth his right hand, \"has told you the truth, yet not quite the truth.  He is right when he says that Leetil Tim and I have come to your rescue, but he is wrong when he says we come alone.  It is true that there are no men at our backs to help us, but is not Manitou behind us--in front--around?  It was Manitou who sent us here, and it was He who gave us the victory.\"  Whitewing paused, and there were some exclamations of approval, but they were not so numerous or so decided as he could have wished, for red men are equally unwilling with white men to attribute their successes directly to their Creator.  \"And now,\" he continued, \"as Bald Eagle has said, if our foes find out their mistake, they will, without doubt, return.  We must therefore take up our goods, our wives, and our little ones, and hasten to meet our brothers of Clearvale, who are even now on their way to help us.  Our band is too small to fight the Blackfeet, but united with our friends, and with Manitou on our side for our cause is just, we shall be more than a match, for them.  I counsel, then, that we raise the camp without delay.\"  The signs of approval were much more decided at the close of this brief address, and the old chief again rose up.  \"My braves,\" he said, \"have listened to the words of wisdom.  Let each warrior go to his wigwam and get ready.  We quit the camp when the sun stands there.\"  He printed to a spot in the sky where the sun would be shining about an hour after daybreak, which was already brightening the eastern sky.  As he spoke the dusky warriors seemed to melt from the scene as if by magic, and ere long the whole camp was busy packing up goods, catching horses, fastening on dogs little packages suited to their size and strength, and otherways making preparation for immediate departure.  \"Follow me,\" said Whitewing to Little Tim, as he turned like the rest to obey the orders of the old chief.  \"Ay, it's time to be lookin' after her,\" said Tim, with something like a wink of one eye, but the Indian was too much occupied with his own thoughts to observe the act or appreciate the allusion.  He strode swiftly through the camp.  \"Well, well,\" soliloquised the trapper as he followed, \"I niver did expect to see Whitewing in this state o' mind.  He's or'narily sitch a cool, unexcitable man.  Ah! women, you've much to answer for!\"  Having thus apostrophised the sex, he hurried on in silence, leaving his horse to the care of a youth, who also took charge of Whitewing's steed.  Close to the outskirts of the camp stood a wigwam somewhat apart from the rest.  It belonged to Whitewing.  Only two women were in it at the time the young Indian chief approached.  One was a good-looking young girl, whose most striking feature was her large, earnest-looking, dark eyes.  The other was a wrinkled old woman, who might have been any age between fifty and a hundred, for a life of exposure and hardship, coupled with a somewhat delicate constitution, had dried her up to such an extent that, when asleep, she might easily have passed for an Egyptian mummy.  One redeeming point in the poor old thing was the fact that all the deep wrinkles in her weather-worn and wigwam-smoked visage ran in the lines of kindliness.  Her loving character was clearly stamped upon her mahogany countenance, so that he who ran might easily read.  With the characteristic reserve of the red man, Whitewing merely gave the two women a slight look of recognition, which was returned with equal quietness by the young woman, but with a marked rippling of the wrinkles on the part of the old.  There still remained a touch of anxiety caused by the recent fight on both countenances.  It was dispelled, however, by a few words from Whitewing, who directed the younger woman to prepare for instant flight.  She acted with prompt, unquestioning obedience, and at the same time the Indian went to work to pack up his goods with all speech.  Of course Tim lent efficient aid to tie up the packs and prepare them for slinging on horse and dog.  \"I say, Whitewing,\" whispered Tim, touching the chief with his elbow, and glancing at the young woman with approval--for Tim, who was an affectionate fellow and anxious about his friend's welfare, rejoiced to observe that the girl was obedient and prompt as well as pretty--\"I say, is that her?\"  Whitewing looked with a puzzled expression at his friend.  \"Is that _her_--_the_ girl, you know?\" said Little Tim, with a series of looks and nods which were intended to convey worlds of deep meaning.  \"She is my sister--Brighteyes,\" replied the Indian quietly, as he continued his work.  \"Whew!\" whistled the trapper.  \"Well, well,\" he murmured in an undertone, \"you're on the wrong scent this time altogether, Tim.  Ye think yerself a mighty deal cliverer than ye are.  Niver mind, the one that he says he loves more nor life'll turn up soon enough, no doubt. But I'm real sorry for the old 'un,\" he added in an undertone, casting a glance of pity on the poor creature, who bent over the little fire in the middle of the tent, and gazed silently yet inquiringly at what was going on.  \"She'll niver be able to stand a flight like this.  The mere joltin' o' the nags 'ud shake her old bones a'most out of her skin. There are some Redskins now, that would leave her to starve, but Whitewing'll niver do that.  I know him better.  Now then\"--aloud--\"have ye anything more for me to do?\"  \"Let my brother help"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21695"],["title","Life in the Red Brigade: London Fire Brigade (#1)"],["body","  To Mary's accustomed ear this raised some disagreeable idea.  She cast a look of anxiety into the closet, wiped her hands quickly, and taking up a pair of dry boots which had been standing near the fire, placed them beside her husband's coat. This was barely accomplished when the hurried cab was heard to pull up at the neighbouring fire-station.  Only a few seconds elapsed when racing footsteps were heard outside.  Mary seized her husband's arm--  \"Up, Joe, up,\" she cried and darted across the room, leaped on a chair, and laid violent hands on the tongue of the door-bell, thereby preventing a furious double ring from disturbing the rosebud!  At the first word \"up,\" the bed in the closet groaned and creaked as the fireman bounded from it, and the house shook as he alighted on the floor.  Next moment he appeared buttoning his braces, and winking like an owl in sunshine.  One moment sufficed to pull on the right boot, another moment affixed the left.  Catching up his half-dried coat with one hand, and flinging on his sailor's cap with the other, he darted from the house, thrust himself into his coat as he ran along and appeared at the station just as four of his comrades drew the fire-engine up to the door, while two others appeared with three horses, which they harnessed thereto--two abreast, one in front--with marvellous rapidity.  The whole affair, from the \"Up, Joe, up,\" of Mrs Dashwood, to the harnessing of the steeds, was accomplished in less than five minutes.  By that time Joe and several of his mates stood ready belted, and armed with brass helmets on their heads, which flashed back the rays of the neighbouring street lamp and the engine lanterns.  There was wonderfully little noise or fuss, although there was so much display of promptitude and energy; the reason being that all the men were thoroughly drilled, and each had his particular duty to perform; there was, therefore, no room for orders, counter-orders, or confusion.  The moment the call was given, Bob Clazie, having received no telegraphic \"stop,\" had at once run to ring up the men, who, like Dashwood, had been sleeping close at hand.  He rang up the driver of the engine first.  At the same moment his comrade on duty had run round to the stable, where the horses stood ready harnessed, and brought them out.  Thus the thing was done without a moment's delay.  The driver, when roused, flung on his coat and helmet, and ran to the engine.  It was a steam fire-engine; that is, the pumps were worked by steam instead of by hand.  The firing was ready laid, and the water kept nearly at the boiling point by means of a jet of gas.  He had scarcely applied a light to the fire and turned off the gas, when four comrades ran into the shed, seized the red-painted engine, and dragged her out, as we have seen.  Much shorter time did it take to do all this than is required to describe it.  When the driver mounted his box, the others sprang on the engine. Crack! went the whip, fire flew from the paving-stones, fire poured from the furnace, the spirited steeds tore round the corner into Regent Street, and off they went to the fire, in the dark winter morning, like a monster rocket or a vision of Roman gladiators whirled away by a red fiery dragon!  Mrs Dashwood heard them go, and turned with a little sigh to her washing-tub.  She was very proud of Joe, and she had good reason to be, for he was one of the best men in the Red Brigade, and, what was of more importance to her, he was one of the best husbands in the world. Perhaps this was largely owing to the fact that she was one of the best of wives!  His career as a fireman had been short, but he had already become known as one of the daring men, to whom their Chief looked when some desperate service had to be performed.  On several occasions he had, while in charge of the fire-escape, been the means of saving life. Upon the whole, therefore, it is not surprising that Mary was proud of her husband--almost as proud of him as she was of the little rosebud; but in regard to this she was never quite sure of the exact state of her mind.  Meditating on Joe, and giving an occasional glance at May, whose sweet upturned face seemed nothing short of angelic, Mrs Dashwood continued energetically to scrub the fairy-like habiliments, and make the soapsuds fly.  Meanwhile, the red engine whirled along its fiery course at full gallop, like a horrible meteor, clattering loudly in the deserted streets of the great city.  So it would have sped in its wild career even if it had been broad day, for the loss of a single moment in reaching a fire is important; but in this case the men, instead of sitting like brazen-headed statues, would have stood up and increased the din of their progress by shouting continuously to clear the crowded thoroughfares.  As it was, they had it all to themselves.  Sometimes the corner of a window-blind was hastily lifted, showing that some wakeful one had curiosity enough to leap out of bed to see them pass.  Here and there a policeman paused, and followed them with his eye as long as the tail of sparks from the furnace was visible.  Occasionally a belated toper stopped in his staggering progress to gaze at them, with an idiotical assumption of seriousness and demand, \"Wash ey maki'n sh' a 'orrible row for?\"  Now and then a cat, with exploratory tendencies, put up its back and greeted them with a glare and a fuff, or a shut-out cur gave them a yelping salute; but the great mass of the London population let them go by without notice, as they would have treated any other passing thunderbolt with which they had nothing to do.  And yet they _had_ something to do with that engine, or, rather, it had to do with them.  But for it, and the rest of the Red Brigade, London would have long ago been in ashes.  It is only by unremitting vigilance and incessant action that the London fires can be kept within bounds. There are nearly two thousand fires in the year in the metropolis, and the heroic little army which keeps these in check numbers only three hundred and seventy-eight men.  That this force is much too small for the work to be done is proved by the fact, that the same men have sometimes to turn out three, four or five times in a night, to work of the most trying and dangerous nature.  There is no occupation in which the lives of the men employed are so frequently risked, and their physical endurance so severely tried, as that of a London fireman.  As there are, on the average, five fires every night all the year round, it follows that he is liable to be called out several times every night; and, in point of fact, this actually takes place very often.  Sometimes he has barely returned from a fire, and put off his drenched garments, when he receives another \"call,\" and is obliged to put them on again, and go forth weary--it may be fasting--to engage in another skirmish with the flames.  In all weathers and at all seasons--hot or cold, wet or dry--he must turn out at a moment's notice, to find himself, almost before he is well awake, in the midst of stifling smoke, obliged to face and to endure the power of roasting flames, to stand under cataracts of water, beside tottering walls and gables, or to plunge through smoke and flames, in order to rescue human lives.  Liability to be called _occasionally_ to the exercise of such courage and endurance is severe enough; it is what every soldier is liable to in time of war, and the lifeboat-man in times of storm; but to be liable to such calls several times every day and night all round the year is hard indeed, and proves that the Red Brigade, although almost perfect in its organisation and heroic in its elements, is far too small.  Paris has about seven hundred fires a year; New York somewhere about three hundred; yet these cities have a far larger body of firemen than London, which with little short of two thousand fires a year, does her work of extinction with only three hundred and seventy-eight men!  She succeeds because every man in the little army is a hero, not one whit behind the Spartans of old.  The London fireman, Ford, who, in 1871, at one great fire rescued six lives from the flames, and perished in accomplishing the noble deed, is a sample of the rest.  All the men of the Brigade are picked men--picked from among the strapping and youthful tars of the navy, because such men are accustomed to strict discipline; to being \"turned out\" at all hours and in all weathers, and to climb with cool heads in trying circumstances, besides being, as a class, pre-eminently noted for daring anything and sticking at nothing. Such men are sure to do their work well, however hard; to do it without complaining, and to die, if need be, in the doing of it.  But ought they to be asked to sacrifice so much?  Surely Londoners would do well to make that complaint, which the men will _never_ make, and insist on the force being increased, not only for the sake of the men, but also for the sake of themselves; for, although there _are_ three hundred and seventy-eight heroes who hold the fiery foe so well in check, there are limits to heroic powers of action, and it stands to reason that double the number would do it better.  But we are wandering from our point.  The engine has been tearing all this time at racing speed along the Bayswater Road.  It turns sharp round a corner near Notting Hill Gate--so sharp that the feat is performed on the two off wheels, and draws from Bob Clazie the quiet remark, \"Pretty nigh on our beam-ends that time, Joe.\"  A light is now seen glaring in the sky over the house-tops; another moment, and the engine dashes into Ladbroke Square, where a splendid mansion is in a blaze, with the flames spouting from the windows of the second floor.  The engine pulls up with a crash; the reeking horses are removed and led aside.  \"Look alive, lads!\" is the only word uttered, and the helmeted heroes, knowing their work well, go into action with that cool promptitude"]]]
