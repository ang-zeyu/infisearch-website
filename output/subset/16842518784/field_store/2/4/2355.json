Mr Green joined us.  Thereafter we came to the residence of a Mr Priest, who also joined us with his son, and thus we sped on over the flat sandy plains, inhaling the sweet scent of mimosa blossom, glowing in the fervid sunshine, and picking up comrades here and there, until about noon we reached the scene of our intended operations.  This was a vast, almost level plain named the Plaat River Flats.  It lay between two rivers, was eight or ten miles wide and upwards of twenty miles in length--a mighty ocean, as it were, of short, compact Karroo, with a boundless horizon like the sea in all directions save one, where a great South African mountain range intercepted the view.  Here and there a few clumps of mimosa bushes rose like islets, and lent additional interest to the scene.  We \"outspanned\", that is, we unyoked, and \"off-saddled\" here for luncheon, and found shelter from the sun under a mimosa, which was large enough to merit being styled a tree.  Its thorns were from four to six inches in length.  The party had now swelled to fourteen--all stout hardy descendants of the English, Scotch, or Dutch settlers, who had originally peopled the land; good rifle shots, and splendid horsemen.  One of them was conspicuous by his brawny arms, which were burnt to a deep brown in consequence of his preferring to hunt and work at all times with shirt sleeves rolled up above the elbows.  Another struck me as having the broadest pair of shoulders I ever saw in a man of his size.  \"Capital water here,\" said Green to me, on alighting beside the mimosa-thorn.  \"Indeed,\" said I, thirsting for some, \"where is it?\"  \"Here! come; I'll show you.\"  He led me to a spot among the bushes where lay a small pond of thin mud the colour of weak tea with milk.  \"There you are,\" said Green.  I looked at him inquiringly.  He looked at me and smiled.  I laughed.  Green grinned, and assured me that it was \"first-rate water.\"  He dipped a cup, as he spoke, and drank it.  So did his comrades, with evident satisfaction, though the liquid was so opaque that I could not see the bottom of a tea-cup when it was full.  There could be no further doubt on the point.  These reckless and jovial South Africans--European by extraction though they were, and without a drop of black blood in their veins--had actually accommodated themselves to circumstances so far as to consider liquid mud good water!  More than that, I found that most of the party deemed it a sufficient beverage, for they were all temperance men, if not total abstainers.  Still further, I followed their example, drank of that yellow pond, and actually enjoyed it.  Subsequently I made the discovery that there were small animals in it; after that I preferred it in the form of tea, which was quickly infused by our active Hottentots.  The discovery above referred to was made when Green, (or Brownarms, or Broadshoulders, I forget which), was quaffing a cup of the cold element. Having drained it he spat out the last mouthful, and along with it a lively creature like a small shrimp, with something like a screw-propeller under its tail!  Enjoying our tea under the shade of the mimosa, we rested for an hour, and then, saddling our steeds and slinging on rifles and cartridge-pouches, we mounted, and sallied forth upon the plain.  A glorious sensation of freedom came over me as I felt my horse's springy step,--a sensation which brought powerfully back the memory of those days when I first galloped over the American prairies.  Surely there must be a sympathy, a mesmeric influence, between a horse and his rider which sends a thrill through each.  Hobson had lent me his own favourite horse, Rob Roy.  He was a charming creature; well made, active, willing, and tender in the mouth, but, best of all, he \"trippled\" splendidly.  Trippling is a favourite gait in South Africa, especially among the Dutch farmers.  It is something between pacing and ambling, a motion so easy that one scarce rises at all from the saddle.  We trippled off into the vast plain towards the horizon, each horseman diverging a little from his comrades, like a fleet of fishing-boats putting out to sea. Most of the party rode without coats, for the sky was cloudless, and we looked for a broiling day.  Brownarms, I observed, had his sleeves rolled up, as usual, to the shoulder.  Six-foot Johnny rode a cream-coloured pony, which, like himself, enjoyed itself intensely, and seemed ready for anything.  Each man grasped his rifle by the middle with the right hand, and rested the stock on his thigh.  Being a stranger to the work, I had been supplied with a Hottentot as well as a horse,--to guide me and carry my rifle; but I scorned to ride without my weapon, and did not at first see the necessity of a guide in the circumstances.  Ultimately I was only too glad to avail myself of his services!  The South Africans call Hottentots \"boys,\" whatever their age or size may be.  My \"boy\" was named Michael.  He was a small wiry man of twenty or thirty,--more or less,--with a dirty brown face, dirty brown garments, and a dirty brown horse.  Though a bad one to look at, it was a marvellous horse to go.  Michael had a cavernous red mouth, and magnificent white teeth.  Likewise he was gifted with a strong sense of the ludicrous, as I have reason to know.  We advanced slowly into the plain at first, and gradually scattered until some of the party began to look like mere specks in the distance. Presently I saw two or three of them break into a gallop, and observed a few moving spots of white on the horizon.  I looked anxiously at my boy. He returned the gaze with glittering eyes and said \"bok.\"  \"Boks! are they?\" said I, applying my spur and making a leap over an ant-bear hole.  Rob Roy stretched his legs with a will, but a howl from Michael caused me to look round.  He was trending off in another direction, and pointing violently towards something.  He spoke nothing but Dutch.  My acquaintance with that tongue was limited to the single word \"Ja.\"  He was aware of this, and his visage became all eyes and mouth in his frantic effort to assure me it would be wise were I to follow his lead.  I turned at once and galloped alongside of him in faith.  It soon became clear what he aimed at.  The horsemen on the far off horizon were driving the springboks towards the stream which bounded one side of the great plain, Mike was making for the bushes that bordered that stream in the hope of reaching them before the boks should observe us.  Oh! it was a glorious burst, that first race over the wild Karroo, on a spirited steed, in the freshness of early morning--    With the silent bushboy alone by my side,  for he _was_ silent, though tremendously excited.  His brown rags fluttered in the self-made breeze, and his brown pony scrambled over the ground quite as fast as Rob Roy.  We reached a clump of underwood in time, and pulled up, panting, beside a bush which was high enough to conceal the horses.  Anxiously we watched here, and carefully did I look to my rifle,--a double-barrelled breech-loading \"Soaper-Henry,\"--to see that it was loaded and cocked, and frequently did I take aim at stump and stone to get my hand and eye well \"in,\" and admiringly, with hope in every lineament, did Michael observe me.  \"See anything of them, Mike?\"  I asked.  I might as well have asked a baboon.  Mike only grinned, but Mike's grin once seen was not easily forgotten.  Suddenly Mike caught sight of something, and bolted.  I followed.  At the same moment pop! pop! went rifles in different parts of the plain. We could not see anything distant for the bushes, but presently we came to the edge of an open space, into which several springboks were trotting with a confusedly surprised air.  \"Now, Sar,--now's you chance,\" said Mike, using the only English sentence he possessed, and laying hold of the bridle of my horse.  I was on the ground and down on one knee in such a hurry, that to this day I know not by what process I got off the horse.  Usually, when thus taken by surprise, the springboks stop for a moment or two and gaze at the kneeling hunter.  This affords a splendid though brief chance to take good aim, but the springboks were not inquisitive that day.  They did not halt.  I had to take a running shot, and the ball fell short, to my intense mortification.  I had sighted for three hundred yards.  Sighting quickly for five hundred, while the frightened animals were scampering wildly away, I put a ball in the dust just between the legs of one.  The leap which that creature gave was magnificent.  Much too high to be guessed at with a hope of being believed!  The full significance of the animal's name was now apparent.  Charging a breech-loader is rapid work, but the flock was nine hundred or a thousand yards off before I could again take aim.  In despair I fired and sent a bullet into the midst of them, but without touching one.  I now turned to look at the \"boy,\" who was sitting on his pony with both eyes nearly shut, and a smile so wide that the double row of his teeth were exposed to the very last grinders!  But he became extremely grave and sympathetic as I turned towards him, and made a remark in Dutch which was doubtless equivalent to \"better luck next time.\"  Remounting I rode to the edge of the clump of bushes and found several of my companions, some of whom carried the carcasses of springboks at their cruppers.  Hope revived at once, and I set off with them in search of another flock.  \"You've failed, I see,\" remarked my friend Jonathan Hobson in a sympathetic tone.  Ah! what a blessed thing is sympathy!  \"Yes,\" said I; \"my shots fell short.\"  \"Don't let that discourage you,\" returned Jonathan, \"you're not used to the Karroo.  Distance is very deceptive.

Its name is dynamite.\"  \"And what may that be, Jeff?  Something very awful, I daresay,\" remarked my mother, with a look of interest, as she sipped her tea.  \"Very awful, indeed,\" said I; \"at least its effects are sometimes tremendous.\"  \"What! worse than gunpowder?\"  \"Ay, much worse, though I should prefer to say _better_ than gunpowder.\"  \"Dear me!\" rejoined my mother, lifting her eyebrows a little, in surprise.  \"Yes, much better,\" I continued; \"gunpowder only bursts things--\"  \"Pretty well that, Jeff, in the way of violence, isn't it?\"  \"Yes, but nothing to dynamite, for while powder only bursts things, dynamite shatters them.\"  \"How very dreadful!  What _is_ dynamite?\"  \"That is just what I am about to explain,\" said I.  \"You must know, then, that it is a compound.\"  \"Dear, dear,\" sighed my mother; \"how many compounds you have told me about, Jeff, since you took to chemistry!  Are there no uncompounded things--no simple things in the world?\"  \"Why, yes, mother; _you_ are a simple thing, and I only wish there were a good many more simple things like you in the world--\"  \"Don't be foolish, Jeff, but answer my question.\"  \"Well, mother, there are indeed some simple elements in creation, but dynamite is not one of them.  It is composed of an excessively explosive oil named nitro-glycerine (itself a compound), and an earth called kieselguhr.  The earth is not explosive, and is only mixed with the nitro-glycerine to render that liquid less dangerous; but the compound is named dynamite, in which form it is made up and sold in immense quantities for mining purposes.  Here is some of it,\" I added, pulling from my pocket a cartridge nearly two inches in length, and about an inch in diameter.  \"It is a soft, pasty substance, done up, as you see, in cartridge-paper, and this little thing, if properly fired, would blow a large boulder-stone to atoms.\"  \"Bless me, boy, be careful!\" exclaimed my mother, pushing back her chair in some alarm.  \"There is no danger,\" I said, in reassuring tones, \"for this cartridge, if opened out and set on fire by a spark or flame, would not, in the first place, light readily, and, in the second place, it would merely burn without exploding; but if I were to put a detonator inside and fire it by means of _that_, it would explode with a violence that far exceeds the force of gunpowder.\"  \"And what is this wonderful detonator, Jeff, that so excites the latent fury of the dynamite?\"  I was much amused by the pat way in which my mother questioned me, and became more interested as I continued my explanation.  \"You must know,\" I said, \"that many powders are violently explosive, and some more so than others.  This violence of explosion is called detonation, by which is meant the almost instantaneous conversion of the ultimate molecules of an explosive compound (i.e. the whole concern) into gas.\"  \"I see; you mean that it goes off quickly,\" said my mother, in a simple way that was eminently characteristic.  \"Well, yes; but much more quickly than gunpowder does.  It were better to say that a powder detonates when it _all_ explodes at the _same_ instant.  Gunpowder appears to do so, but in reality it does not.  One of the best detonators is fulminate of mercury.  Detonating caps are therefore made of this, and one such cap put into the middle of that cartridge of dynamite and set fire to, by any means, would convert the cartridge itself into a detonator, and explode it with a _shattering_ effect.  \"A human being,\" I continued, \"sometimes illustrates this principle figuratively--I mean the violent explosion of a large cartridge by means of a small detonator.  Take, for example, a schoolmaster, and suppose him to be a dynamite cartridge.  His heart is a detonating cap.  The schoolroom and boys form a galvanic battery.  His brain may be likened to a conducting-wire.  He enters the schoolroom; the chemical elements are seething in riot, books are being torn and thrown, ink spilt, etcetera.  Before opening the door, the good man is a quiet piece of plastic dynamite, but the instant his eye is touched, the electric circuit is, as it were, completed; the mysterious current flashes through the brain, and fires his detonating heart.  Instantly the gleaming flame shoots with lightning-speed to temples and toes.  The entire man becomes a detonator, and he explodes in a violent hurricane of kicks, cuffs, and invective!  Now, without a detonator--a heart--the man might have burned with moderate wrath, but he could not have exploded.\"  \"Don't try illustration, Jeff,\" said my plain-spoken mother, gently patting my arm; \"it is not one of your strong points.\"  \"Perhaps not; but do you understand me?\"  \"I think I do, in a hazy sort of way.\"  Dear mother! she always professes to comprehend things hazily, and indeed I sometimes fear that her conceptions on the rather abstruse matters which I bring before her are not always correct; but it is delightful to watch the profound interest with which she listens, and the patient efforts she makes to understand.  I must in justice add that she sometimes, though not often, displays gleams of clear intelligence, and powers of close incisive reasoning, that quite surprise me.  \"But now, to return to what we were speaking of--my future plans,\" said I; \"it seems to me that it would be a good thing if I were to travel for a year or so and see the world.\"  \"You might do worse, my boy,\" said my mother.  \"With a view to that,\" I continued, \"I have resolved to purchase a yacht, but before doing so I must complete the new torpedo that I have invented for the navy; that is, I hope it may be introduced into our navy.  The working model in the outhouse is all but ready for exhibition.  When finished, I shall show it to the Lords of the Admiralty, and after they have accepted it I will throw study overboard for a time and go on a cruise.\"  \"Ah, Jeff, Jeff,\" sighed my mother, with a shake of her head, \"you'll never leave off till you get blown up.  But I suppose you must have your way.  You always had, dear boy.\"  \"But never in opposition to your wishes, had I?  Now be just, mother.\"  \"Quite true, Jeff, quite true.  How comes it, I wonder, that you are so fond of fire, smoke, fumes, crash, clatter, and explosions?\"  \"Really,\" said I, somewhat amused by the question, \"I cannot tell, unless it be owing to something in that law of compensation which appears to permeate the universe.  You have such an abhorrence of fire, fumes, smoke, crash, clatter, and explosions, that your only son is bound, as it were, to take special delight in chemical analysis and combination, to say nothing of mechanical force and contrivance, in order that a balance of some sort may be adjusted which would otherwise be thrown out of order by your--pardon me--comparative ignorance of, and indifference to such matters.\"  \"Nay, Jeff,\" replied my mother, gently, with a look of reproof on her kind face; \"ignorance if you will, but not indifference.  I cannot be indifferent to anything that interests you.\"  \"True; forgive me; I should have said `dislike.'\"  \"Yes, that would have been correct, Jeff, for I cannot pretend to like the bursting, smoking, and ill-smelling things you are so fond of; but you know I am interested in them.  You cannot have forgotten how, when you were a boy, I used to run at your call to witness your pyrotechnic, hydraulic, mechanic, and chemic displays--you see how well I remember the names--and how the--\"  \"The acids,\" I interrupted, taking up the theme, \"ruined your carpets and table-cloths, and the smoke stifled and blinded, while the noise and flames terrified you; no, mother, I have not forgotten it, nor the patient way you took the loss of your old silk dress, or--\"  \"Ah! yes,\" sighed the dear old lady, with quite a pitiful look, \"if it had been any other than my wedding dress, which--but--well, it's of no use regretting now; and you know, Jeff, I would not have checked you for worlds, because I knew you were being led in the right way, though, in my folly, I sometimes wished that the way had been a little further removed from smoke and smells.  But, after all, you were very careful, dear boy--wonderfully so, for your years, and your little accidents did not give me much pain beyond the day of their occurrence.  The poisoning of the cat, to be sure, was sad, though unavoidable, and so was the destruction by fire of the cook's hair; but the flooding of the house, after the repairs you executed on the great cistern, and the blowing out of the laundry window at the time the clothes-boiler was cracked, with other trifles of that sort, were--\"  The remainder of my mother's speech was cut short by a clattering of hoofs.  Next moment my sister Bella came round the corner of the house at full gallop, her fresh face beaming with the exercise, and her golden hair streaming in the breeze.  She pulled up, leaped off her pony, and ran into the room.  As she did so, I observed a tall, soldierly man appear in the avenue, advancing with rapid strides.  Well did I know his grave, handsome face.  \"Here comes Nicholas!\" said I, turning round; but Bella had fled.  I observed that my friend, instead of coming straight to the room from the window of which my mother and I had saluted him, turned sharp off to the library.  I was running to the door to welcome him, when my mother called me back. I turned and looked at her.  She smiled.  So did I.  Without uttering a word we both sat down to finish our breakfast.  \"Ah!  Jeff,\" said my mother, with a little sigh, \"how I wish you would fall in love with some one!\"  \"Fall in love, mother!  What nonsense!  How could I?  No doubt there are plenty loveable girls, and there _is_ one charming little--well, no matter--\"  At that moment Nicholas entered the room, heartily saluted my mother, and cut short our conversation.
