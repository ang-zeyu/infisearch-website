What Karlsefin thought, he did not show and never mentioned, therefore we cannot tell.  Now, good reader, pray do not run away with the notion that this love affair is the plot on which the story is to hinge!  Nothing of the kind. It ran its course much more rapidly, and terminated much more abruptly, than you probably suppose--as the sequel will show.  During supper there was not much conversation, for all were hungry, but afterwards, when cans of home-brewed ale were handed round, the tongues began to move.  Leif soon observed that Karlsefin merely sipped his beer, but never once drank.  \"You do not drink,\" he said, pushing a large silver tankard towards him; \"come, fill up.\"  \"Thanks, I drink but sparingly,\" said Karlsefin, taking up the large tankard and admiring the workmanship.  \"In good sooth ye do,\" cried Biarne, with a laugh; \"a mouse could hardly slake his thirst with all that you have yet imbibed.\"  \"I have been so long at sea,\" rejoined Karlsefin, smiling, \"that I have lost my relish for beer.  We had nothing but water with us.  Where got you this tankard, Leif, it is very massive and the workmanship such as one seldom meets with save in kings' houses?\"  \"It belonged to a king!\" replied Leif, with a look of pride.  \"Good King Olaf Tryggvisson gave it to me on an occasion when I chanced to do him some small service.  Many winters have passed since then.\"  \"Indeed, Leif! then you must be a favourite with King Olaf,\" exclaimed Karlsefin, \"for I am the bearer of another gift to you from his royal hand.\"  \"To me?\"  \"Ay.  Hearing that I meant to sail over to Greenland this summer, he asked me to bear you his remembrances, and gave me two slaves to present to you in token of his continued friendship.\"  Leif's face beamed with satisfaction, and he immediately filled and quaffed a bumper of ale to King Olaf's health, which example was followed by Biarne and the guests, as well as by the house-carls who sat on benches in various parts of the hall drinking their ale and listening to the conversation.  Even little Olaf--who had been named after the king of Norway--filled his tankard to the brim with milk, and quaffed it off with a swagger that was worthy of a descendant of a long line of sea-kings, who could trace their lineage back to Odin himself.  \"The slaves,\" continued Karlsefin, \"are from the land of the Scots. Wouldst like to see a Scotsman, Gudrid?\" he added, turning to the widow who sat near him.  \"I should like it much.  I have heard of the Scots in Iceland.  'Tis said they are a well-favoured race, stout warriors, and somewhat fond of trading.\"  Leif and Biarne both laughed loud and long at this.  \"In good truth they are a stout race, and fight like very wild-cats, as Biarne and I can testify; as to their being well-favoured, there can be no question about that; though they are rather more rugged than the people farther south, and--yes, they _are_ good traders, and exceedingly cautious men.  They think well before they speak, and they speak slowly--sometimes they won't speak at all.  Ha! ha!  Here, I drink to the land of the Scot.  It is a grand good land, like our own dear old Norway.\"  \"Brother-in-law,\" exclaimed Gudrid, reproachfully, \"do you forget that you are an Icelander?\"  \"Forget!\" exclaimed Leif, tossing back his yellow locks, and raising the tankard again to pledge his native land; \"no, I shall only forget Iceland when I forget to live; but I don't forget, also, that it is only about 130 years since my great-grandfather and his companions came over from Norway to Iceland.  Before that it was an unpeopled rock in the Northern Sea, without name or history.  [Iceland was colonised by Norsemen about the year 874.] 'Twas as little known then as Vinland is known now.\"  \"By the way, Biarne,\" said Karlsefin, turning to his friend, \"the mention of Vinland reminds me that, when you and I met last, you did not give me a full account of that discovery, seeing that you omitted to mention your own share in it.  Tell me how was it, and when and where was it?  Nay, have I unintentionally touched on a sore point?\" he added, on observing a slight shade of annoyance pass over Biarne's usually cheerful countenance.  \"He _is_ a little sore about it,\" said Leif, laughing.  \"Come, Biarne, don't be thin-skinned.  You know the saying, A dutiful son makes a glad father.  You had the best of reasons for acting as you did.\"  \"Ay, but people don't believe in these best of reasons,\" retorted Biarne, still annoyed, though somewhat mollified by Leif's remarks.  \"Never mind, 'tis long past now.  Come, give us the saga.  'Tis a good one, and will bear re-telling.\"  \"Oh yes,\" exclaimed Olaf, with sparkling eyes, for the boy dearly loved anything that bore the faintest resemblance to a saga or story, \"tell it, Biarne.\"  \"Not I,\" said Biarne; \"Leif can tell it as well as I, if he chooses.\"  \"Well, I'll try,\" said Leif, laying his huge hand on the table and looking earnestly at Karlsefin and Thorward.  The latter was a very silent man, and had scarcely uttered a word all the evening, but he appeared to take peculiar interest in Vinland, and backed up the request that Leif would give an account of its discovery.  \"About twenty summers ago,\" said Leif, \"my father, Eric the Red, and his friend Heriulf, Biarne's father, came over here from Iceland.  [A.D. 986.] Biarne was a very young man at the time--little more than a boy-- but he was a man of enterprise, and fond of going abroad, and possessed a merchant-ship of his own with which he gathered wealth, and, I will say it, reputation also--though perhaps I should not say that to his face.  \"He was a good son, and used to be by turns a year abroad and a year with his father.  He chanced to be away in Norway when Heriulf and my father Eric came over to Greenland.  On returning to Iceland he was so much disappointed to hear of his father's departure that he would not unload his ship, but resolved to follow his old custom and take up his winter abode with his father.  `Who will go with me to Greenland?' said he to his men.  `We will all go,' replied the men.  `Our expedition,' said Biarne, `will be thought foolish, as none of us have ever been on the Greenland sea before.'  `We mind not that,' said the men--so away they sailed for three days and lost sight of Iceland.  Then the wind failed; after that a north wind and a fog set in, and they knew not where they were sailing to; and this lasted many days.  At length the sun appeared.  Then they knew the quarters of the sky, and, after sailing a day and a night, made the land.  \"They saw that it was without mountains, was covered with wood, and that there were small hills inland.  Biarne saw that this did not answer to the description of Greenland; he knew he was too far south, so he left the land on the larboard side, and sailed two days and nights before they got sight of land again.  The men asked Biarne if this was Greenland, but he said it was not, `For on Greenland,' he says, `there are great snowy mountains, but this is flat and covered with trees.' Here the wind fell and the men wanted to go ashore, `Because,' said they, `we have need of wood and water.'  Biarne replied, `Ye are not in want of either;' and the men blamed him for this,--but the season was far spent, he knew not how long it might take him to find Greenland, so he had no time to spare.--Was it not so?\" said Leif, appealing to his friend.  \"It was so,\" replied Biarne, nodding gravely.  \"Well then,\" continued Leif, \"it must be told that he ordered them to hoist the sail, which they did, and, turning the bow from the land, kept the sea for three days and nights, with a fine breeze from the south-west, when a third time land was seen, with high snowy mountains. Still Biarne would not land, for it was not like what had been reported of Greenland.  They soon found it to be an island, and, turning from it, stood out to sea, when the breeze increased to a gale, forcing them to take in a reef; so they sailed for three days and nights more, and made land the fourth time.  This turned out to be Greenland, and quite close to Heriulf's dwelling at Heriulfness.  Biarne then gave up seafaring, and dwelt with his old father as long as he lived; but since his death he has been sometimes at sea and sometimes at home.  Now, these lands which Biarne discovered, were what I have since called Vinland.\"  \"Yes,\" exclaimed Biarne, with a look of indignation; \"and when I afterwards fared to Norway they blamed me for not going on shore and exploring these lands--as if I, at the end of autumn, could afford to put off time in explorations, when it was all I could do to make my port before the winter set in!\"  He finished off by striking the table with his fist, seizing his tankard, and draining it to the bottom.  \"I have often observed,\" said Karlsefin, quietly, \"that people who sit by their firesides at home, and do nothing, are usually very severe and noisy in their remarks on those who fare abroad and do great things; but that arises not so much from ill-will as ignorance.\"  \"But what of your own doings, Leif?\" said Thorward, breaking in here impatiently.  \"Well, I didn't do much,\" replied Leif.  \"I only took possession, and didn't keep it.  This was the way of it.  Fourteen years after this voyage of Biarne, [about the year A.D. 1000] I was seized with a desire to see these new lands.  I bought Biarne's ship from him, set sail with a good crew, and found the lands, just as Biarne had described them, far away to the south of Greenland.  I landed and gave names to some places. At the farthest south point we built huts and spent the winter, but returned home in spring.  I called this part Vinland, and this is the reason why: We had a German with us named Tyrker, who is with me here still.  One day Tyrker was lost; I was very anxious about him, fearing that he had been killed by wild"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21754"],["title","The Ocean and Its Wonders (#1)"],["body","advantage to man in the matter of commerce.  A ship does not sink so deep in the sea as it does in a fresh-water lake; hence it can carry more cargo with greater facility.  It is easier to swim in salt than in fresh water.  The only disadvantage to commerce in the saltness of the sea is the consequent unfitness of its water for drinking.  Many and harrowing are the accounts of instances in which sailors have been reduced to the most terrible extremities for want of fresh water; and many a time, since navigation began, have men been brought to feel the dread reality of that condition which is so forcibly expressed in the poem of the \"Ancient Mariner\":--    \"Water, water everywhere,   And not a drop to drink.\"  Science, however, at length enabled us to overcome this disadvantage of saltness.  By the process of distillation, men soon managed to procure enough water at least to save their lives.  One captain of a ship, by accident, lost all his fresh water; and, before he could put into port to replenish, a gale of wind, which lasted three weeks, drove him far out to sea.  He had no distilling apparatus on board, and it seemed as if all hope of the crew escaping the most horrible of deaths were utterly taken away.  In this extremity the captain's inventive genius came to his aid.  He happened to have on board an old iron pitch-pot, with a wooden cover.  Using this as a boiler, a pipe made of a pewter plate, and a wooden cask as a receiver, he set to work, filled the pot with sea water, put an ounce of soap therein to assist in purifying it, and placed it on the fire.  When the pot began to boil, the steam passed through the pipe into the cask, where it was condensed into water, minus the saline particles, which, not being evaporable, were left behind in the pitch-pot.  In less than an hour a quart of fresh water was thus obtained; which, though not very palatable, was sufficiently good to relieve the thirst of the ship's crew.  Many ships are now regularly supplied with apparatus for distilling sea water; and on the African coasts and other unhealthy stations, where water is bad, the men of our navy drink no other water than that which is distilled from the sea.  The salts of the ocean have something to do with the creating of oceanic currents; which, in their turn, have a powerful influence on climates. They also retard evaporation to some extent, and have some effect in giving to the sea its beautiful blue colour.  The ocean covers about two-thirds of the entire surface of the Earth. Its depth has never been certainly ascertained; but from the numberless experiments and attempts that have been made, we are warranted in coming to the conclusion that it nowhere exceeds five miles in depth, probably does not quite equal that.  Professor Wyville Thompson estimates the average depth of the sea at about two miles.  Of the three great oceans into which the sea is naturally divided--the Atlantic, the Pacific, and the Arctic--the Atlantic is supposed to be the deepest.  There are profundities in its bosom which have never yet been sounded, and probably never will be.  The difficulty of sounding great depths arises from the fact that, after a large quantity of line has been run out, the shock of the lead striking the bottom cannot be felt.  Moreover, there is sufficient force in the deep-sea currents to sweep out the line after the lead has reached the bottom so that, with the ordinary sounding-lines in use among navigators, it is impossible to sound great depths.  Scientific men have, therefore, taxed their brains to invent instruments for sounding the deep sea--for touching the bottom in what sailors call \"blue water.\"  Some have tried it with a silk thread as a plumb-line, some with spun-yarn threads, and various other materials and contrivances.  It has even been tried by exploding petards and ringing bells in the deep sea, when it was supposed that an echo or reverberation might be heard, and, from the known rate at which sound travels through water, the depth might thus be ascertained.  Deep-sea leads have been constructed having a column of air in them, which, by compression, would show the aqueous pressure to which they had been subjected; but the trial proved to be more than the instrument could stand.  Captain Maury, of the American Navy--whose interesting book has been already referred to--invented an instrument for sounding the deep sea. Here is his own description of it:--\"To the lead was attached, upon the principle of the screw-propeller, a small piece of clock-work for registering the number of revolutions made by the little screw during the descent; and it having been ascertained by experiment in shoal water that the apparatus, in descending, would cause the propeller to make one revolution for every fathom of perpendicular descent, hands provided with the power of self-registering were attached to a dial, and the instrument was complete.  It worked beautifully in moderate depths, but failed in blue water, from the difficulty of hauling it up if the line used were small, and from the difficulty of getting it down if the line used were large enough to give the requisite strength for hauling it up.\"  One eccentric old sea captain proposed to sound the sea with a torpedo, or shell, which should explode the instant it touched the bottom.  Another gentleman proposed to try it by the magnetic telegraph, and designed an instrument which should telegraph to the expectant measurers above how it was getting on in the depths below.  But all these ingenious devices failed, and it is probable that the deepest parts of the ocean-bed still remained untouched by man.  At last an extremely simple and remarkably successful deep-sea sounding apparatus was invented by Mr Brooke, an American officer.  It consisted of nothing more than thin twine for a sounding-line, and a cannon ball for a sinker.  The twine was made for the purpose, fine but very strong, and was wound on a reel to the extent of ten thousand fathoms.  The cannon ball, which was from thirty-two to sixty-eight pounds' weight, had a hole quite through it, into which was fixed a sliding rod, the end of which, covered with grease, projected several inches beyond the ball. By an ingenious and simple contrivance, the cannon ball was detached when it reached the bottom of the sea, and the light rod was drawn up with specimens of the bottom adhering to the grease.  With this instrument the Americans went to work with characteristic energy, and, by always using a line of the same size and make, and a sinker of the same shape and weight, they at last ascertained the law of descent.  This was an important achievement, because, having become familiar with the precise rate of descent at all depths, they were enabled to tell very nearly when the ball ceased to carry out the line, and when it began to go out in obedience to the influence of deep-sea currents.  The greatest depth reached by Brooke's sounding-line is said to have been a little under five miles in the North Atlantic.  The value of investigations of this kind does not appear at first sight, to unscientific men.  But those who have paid even a little attention to the methods and processes by which grand discoveries have been made, and useful inventions have been perfected, can scarcely have failed to come to the conclusion that _the search after_ TRUTH, _pure and simple, of any kind, and of every kind, either with or without reference to a particular end_, is one of the most useful as well as elevating pursuits in which man can engage.  _All_ truth is worth knowing and labouring after.  No one can tell to what useful results the discovery of even the smallest portion of truth may lead.  Some of the most serviceable and remarkable inventions of modern times have been the result of discoveries of truths which at first seemed to have no bearing whatever on those inventions.  When James Watt sat with busy reflective mind staring at a boiling kettle, and discovered the expansive power of steam, no one could have for a moment imagined that in the course of years the inventions founded on the truth then discovered would result in the systematic driving of a fleet of floating palaces all round the world at the rate of from twelve to fifteen or twenty miles an hour!  Instances of a similar kind might be multiplied without end.  In like manner, deep-sea sounding may lead to great, as yet unimagined, results.  Although yet in its infancy, it has already resulted in the discovery of a comparatively shallow plateau or ridge in the North Atlantic Ocean, rising between Ireland and Newfoundland; a discovery which has been turned to practical account, inasmuch as the plateau has been chosen to be the bed of our electric telegraph between Europe and America.  The first Atlantic cable was laid on it; and although that cable suffered many vicissitudes at first, as most contrivances do in their beginnings, communication between the two continents was successfully established.  Soundings taken elsewhere showed that somewhat similar plateaus existed in other parts of the Atlantic, and now the whole of Western Europe is being bound more firmly, by additional cables, to the eastern seaboard of America.  This great and glorious achievement has been the result of the discovery of two truths,--of a truth in science on the one hand, and a truth in regard to the structure of the bed of the sea on the other.  The study of electricity and of deep-sea soundings was begun and carried on for the sake of the discovery of _truth_ alone, and without the most distant reference to the Atlantic Telegraph,--yet that telegraph has been one of the results of that study.  Who can tell how many more shall follow? And even were no other result ever to follow, this one may prove to be of the most stupendous importance to the human race.  Another discovery that has been made by deep-sea sounding is, that the lowest depths of the ocean are always in a state "]]]
