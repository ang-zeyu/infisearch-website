He proved himself a faithful and loyal subject to four successive sovereigns; stood unshaken by the tempests of the most turbulent times; and died full of days in the possession of great riches, high hereditary honors, and universal esteem, in 1574.  A splendid canopy was supported over the infant by four lords, three of them destined to disastrous fates. One was her uncle, the elegant, accomplished, viscount Rochford, whom the impartial suffrage of posterity has fully acquitted of the odious crime for which he suffered by the mandate of a jealous tyrant.  Another was lord Hussey; whom a rash rebellion brought to the scaffold a few years afterwards. The two others were brothers of that illustrious family of Howard, which furnished in this age alone more subjects for tragedy than \"Thebes or Pelops' line\" of old. Lord William, uncle to Catherine Howard, was arbitrarily adjudged to perpetual imprisonment and forfeiture of goods for concealing her misconduct; but Henry was pleased soon after to remit the sentence: he lived to be eminent in the state under the title of lord Howard of Effingham, and died peacefully in a good old age. Lord Thomas suffered by the ambition so frequent in his house, of matching with the blood royal. He formed a secret marriage with the lady Margaret Douglas, niece to the king; on discovery of which, he was committed to a close imprisonment, whence he was only released by death.  After the ceremony of baptism had been performed by Stokesly bishop of London, a solemn benediction was pronounced upon the future queen by Cranmer, that learned and distinguished prelate, who may indeed be reproached with some too courtly condescensions to the will of an imperious master, and what is worse, with several cruel acts of religious persecution; but whose virtues were many, whose general character was mild and benevolent, and whose errors and weaknesses were finally expiated by the flames of martyrdom.  In the return from church, the gifts of the sponsors, consisting of cups and bowls, some gilded, and others of massy gold, were carried by four persons of quality: Henry Somerset second earl of Worcester, whose father, notwithstanding his illegitimacy, had been acknowledged as a kinsman by Henry VII., and advanced to the peerage; lord Thomas Howard the younger, a son of the duke of Norfolk who was restored in blood after his father's attainder, and created lord Howard of Bindon; Thomas Ratcliffe lord Fitzwalter, afterwards earl of Sussex; and sir John Dudley, son of the detested associate of Empson, and afterwards the notorious duke of Northumberland, whose crimes received at length their due recompense in that ignominious death to which his guilty and extravagant projects had conducted so many comparatively innocent victims.  We are told, that on the same day and hour which gave birth to the princess Elizabeth, a son was born to this \"bold bad man,\" who received the name of Robert, and was known in after-times as earl of Leicester. It was believed by the superstition of the age, that this coincidence of their nativities produced a secret and invincible sympathy which secured to Dudley, during life, the affections of his sovereign lady. It may without superstition be admitted, that this circumstance, seizing on the romantic imagination of the princess, might produce a first impression, which Leicester's personal advantages, his insinuating manners, and consummate art of feigning, all contributed to render deep and permanent.  The personal history of Elizabeth may truly be said to begin with her birth; for she had scarcely entered her second year when her marriage--that never-accomplished project, which for half a century afterwards inspired so many vain hopes and was the subject of so many fruitless negotiations, was already proposed as an article of a treaty between France and England.  Henry had caused an act of succession to be passed, by which his divorce was confirmed, the authority of the pope disclaimed, and the crown settled on his issue by Anne Boleyn. But, as if half-repenting the boldness of his measures, he opened a negotiation almost immediately with Francis I., for the purpose of obtaining a declaration by that king and his nobility in favor of his present marriage, and the intercession of Francis for the revocation of the papal censures fulminated against him. And in consideration of these acts of friendship, he offered to engage the hand of Elizabeth to the duke d'AngoulÃªme, third son of the French king. But Francis was unable to prevail upon the new pope to annul the acts of his predecessor; and probably not wishing to connect himself more closely with a prince already regarded as a heretic, he suffered the proposal of marriage to fall to the ground.  The doctrines of Zwingle and of Luther had at this time made considerable progress among Henry's subjects, and the great work of reformation was begun in England. Several smaller monasteries had been suppressed; the pope's supremacy was preached against by public authority; and the parliament, desirous of widening the breach between the king and the pontiff, declared the former, head of the English church. After some hesitation, Henry accepted the office, and wrote a book in defence of his conduct. The queen was attached, possibly by principle, and certainly by interest, to the antipapal party, which alone admitted the validity of the royal divorce, and consequently of her marriage; and she had already engaged her chaplain Dr. Parker, a learned and zealous reformist, to keep a watchful eye over the childhood of her daughter, and early to imbue her mind with the true principles of religious knowledge.  But Henry, whose passions and interests alone, not his theological convictions, had set him in opposition to the old church establishment, to the ceremonies and doctrines of which he was even zealously attached, began to be apprehensive that the whole fabric would be swept away by the strong tide of popular opinion which was now turned against it, and he hastened to interpose in its defence. He brought to the stake several persons who denied the real presence, as a terror to the reformers; whilst at the same time he showed his resolution to quell the adherents of popery, by causing bishop Fisher and sir Thomas More to be attainted of treason, for refusing such part of the oath of succession as implied the invalidity of the king's first marriage, and thus, in effect, disallowed the authority of the papal dispensation in virtue of which it had been celebrated.  Thus were opened those dismal scenes of religious persecution and political cruelty from which the mind of Elizabeth was to receive its early and indelible impressions.  The year 1536, which proved even more fertile than its predecessor in melancholy incidents and tragical catastrophes, opened with the death of Catherine of Arragon; an event equally welcome, in all probability, both to the sufferer herself, whom tedious years of trouble and mortification must have rendered weary of a world which had no longer a hope to flatter her; and to the ungenerous woman who still beheld her, discarded as she was, with the sentiments of an enemy and a rival. It is impossible to contemplate the life and character of this royal lady, without feelings of the deepest commiseration. As a wife, the bitter humiliations which she was doomed to undergo were entirely unmerited; for not only was her modesty unquestioned, but her whole conduct towards the king was a perfect model of conjugal love and duty. As a queen and a mother, her firmness, her dignity, and her tenderness, deserved a far other recompense than to see herself degraded, on the infamous plea of incest, from the rank of royalty, and her daughter, so long heiress to the English throne, branded with illegitimacy, and cast out alike from the inheritance and the affections of her father. But the memory of this unhappy princess has been embalmed by the genius of Shakespeare, in the noble drama of which he has made her the touching and majestic heroine; and let not the praise of magnanimity be denied to the daughter of Anne Boleyn, in permitting those wrongs and those sufferings which were the price of her glory, nay of her very existence, to be thus impressively offered to the compassion of her people.  Henry was moved to tears on reading the tender and pious letter addressed to him by the dying hand of Catherine; and he marked by several small but expressive acts, the respect, or rather the compunction, with which the recollection of her could not fail to inspire him. Anne Boleyn paid to the memory of the princess-dowager of Wales--such was the title now given to Catherine--the unmeaning compliment of putting on yellow mourning; the color assigned to queens by the fashion of France: but neither humanity nor discretion restrained her from open demonstrations of the satisfaction afforded her by the melancholy event.  Short was her unfeeling triumph. She brought into the world a few days afterwards, a dead son; and this second disappointment of his hopes completed that disgust to his queen which satiety, and perhaps also a growing passion for another object, was already beginning to produce in the mind of the king.  It is traditionally related, that at Jane Seymour's first coming to court, the queen, espying a jewel hung round her neck, wished to look at it; and struck with the young lady's reluctance to submit it to her inspection, snatched it from her with violence, when she found it to contain the king's picture, presented by himself to the wearer. From this day she dated her own decline in the affections of her husband, and the ascendancy of her rival. However this might be, it is certain that the king about this time began to regard the conduct of his once idolized Anne Boleyn with an altered eye. That easy gaiety of manner which he had once remarked with delight, as an "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2151"],["title","The Works of Edgar Allan Poe â Volume 5 (#1)"],["body"," great British plates, and then imagine we have done a fine       thing. Now the slightest thought will be sufficient to convince any one       who has an eye at all, of the ill effect of numerous looking-glasses, and       especially of large ones. Regarded apart from its reflection, the mirror       presents a continuous, flat, colourless, unrelieved surface,âa thing       always and obviously unpleasant. Considered as a reflector, it is potent       in producing a monstrous and odious uniformity: and the evil is here       aggravated, not in merely direct proportion with the augmentation of its       sources, but in a ratio constantly increasing. In fact, a room with four       or five mirrors arranged at random, is, for all purposes of artistic show,       a room of no shape at all. If we add to this evil, the attendant glitter       upon glitter, we have a perfect farrago of discordant and displeasing       effects. The veriest bumpkin, on entering an apartment so bedizzened,       would be instantly aware of something wrong, although he might be       altogether unable to assign a cause for his dissatisfaction. But let the       same person be led into a room tastefully furnished, and he would be       startled into an exclamation of pleasure and surprise.            It is an evil growing out of our republican institutions, that here a man       of large purse has usually a very little soul which he keeps in it. The       corruption of taste is a portion or a pendant of the dollar-manufacture.       As we grow rich, our ideas grow rusty. It is, therefore, not among _our       _aristocracy that we must look (if at all, in Appallachia), for the       spirituality of a British _boudoir. _But we have seen apartments in       the tenure of Americans of moderns [possibly âmodestâ or âmoderateâ]       means, which, in negative merit at least, might vie with any of the _or-moluâd       _cabinets of our friends across the water. Even _now_, there is       present to our mindâs eye a small and not, ostentatious chamber with whose       decorations no fault can be found. The proprietor lies asleep on a sofaâthe       weather is coolâthe time is near midnight: we will make a sketch of       the room during his slumber.            It is oblongâsome thirty feet in length and twenty-five in breadthâa       shape affording the best(ordinary) opportunities for the adjustment of       furniture. It has but one doorâby no means a wide oneâwhich is       at one end of the parallelogram, and but two windows, which are at the       other. These latter are large, reaching down to the floorâhave deep       recessesâand open on an Italian _veranda. _Their panes are of a       crimson-tinted glass, set in rose-wood framings, more massive than usual.       They are curtained within the recess, by a thick silver tissue adapted to       the shape of the window, and hanging loosely in small volumes. Without the       recess are curtains of an exceedingly rich crimson silk, fringed with a       deep network of gold, and lined with silver tissue, which is the material       of the exterior blind. There are no cornices; but the folds of the whole       fabric (which are sharp rather than massive, and have an airy appearance),       issue from beneath a broad entablature of rich giltwork, which encircles       the room at the junction of the ceiling and walls. The drapery is thrown       open also, or closed, by means of a thick rope of gold loosely enveloping       it, and resolving itself readily into a knot; no pins or other such       devices are apparent. The colours of the curtains and their fringeâthe       tints of crimson and goldâappear everywhere in profusion, and       determine the _character _of the room. The carpetâof Saxony       materialâis quite half an inch thick, and is of the same crimson       ground, relieved simply by the appearance of a gold cord (like that       festooning the curtains) slightly relieved above the surface of the _ground,       _and thrown upon it in such a manner as to form a succession of short       irregular curvesâone occasionally overlaying the other. The walls       are prepared with a glossy paper of a silver gray tint, spotted with small       Arabesque devices of a fainter hue of the prevalent crimson. Many       paintings relieve the expanse of paper. These are chiefly landscapes of an       imaginative castâsuch as the fairy grottoes of Stanfield, or the       lake of the Dismal Swamp of Chapman. There are, nevertheless, three or       four female heads, of an ethereal beauty-portraits in the manner of Sully.       The tone of each picture is warm, but dark. There are no âbrilliant       effects.â _Repose _speaks in all. Not one is of small size.       Diminutive paintings give that _spotty _look to a room, which is the       blemish of so many a fine work of Art overtouched. The frames are broad       but not deep, and richly carved, without being _dulled _or filagreed.       They have the whole lustre of burnished gold. They lie flat on the walls,       and do not hang off with cords. The designs themselves are often seen to       better advantage in this latter position, but the general appearance of       the chamber is injured. But one mirrorâand this not a very large oneâis       visible. In shape it is nearly circularâand it is hung so that a       reflection of the person can be obtained from it in none of the ordinary       sitting-places of the room. Two large low sofas of rosewood and crimson       silk, gold-flowered, form the only seats, with the exception of two light       conversation chairs, also of rose-wood. There is a pianoforte (rose-wood,       also), without cover, and thrown open. An octagonal table, formed       altogether of the richest gold-threaded marble, is placed near one of the       sofas. This is also without coverâthe drapery of the curtains has       been thought sufficient.. Four large and gorgeous Sevres vases, in which       bloom a profusion of sweet and vivid flowers, occupy the slightly rounded       angles of the room. A tall candelabrum, bearing a small antique lamp with       highly perfumed oil, is standing near the head of my sleeping friend. Some       light and graceful hanging shelves, with golden edges and crimson silk       cords with gold tassels, sustain two or three hundred magnificently bound       books. Beyond these things, there is no furniture, if we except an Argand       lamp, with a plain crimson-tinted ground glass shade, which depends from       He lofty vaulted ceiling by a single slender gold chain, and throws a       tranquil but magical radiance over all.      A TALE OF JERUSALEM        Intensos rigidam in frontem ascendere canos      Passus eratââ                     âLucanâ_De Catone_       ââa bristly _bore_.                     _Translation._             âLet us hurry to the walls,â said Abel-Phittim to Buzi-Ben-Levi and Simeon       the Pharisee, on the tenth day of the month Thammuz, in the year of the       world three thousand nine hundred and forty-oneââlet us hasten to the       ramparts adjoining the gate of Benjamin, which is in the city of David,       and overlooking the camp of the uncircumcised; for it is the last hour of       the fourth watch, being sunrise; and the idolaters, in fulfilment of the       promise of Pompey, should be awaiting us with the lambs for the       sacrifices.â                  Simeon, Abel-Phittim, and Duzi-Ben-Levi were the Gizbarim, or       sub-collectors of the offering, in the holy city of Jerusalem.            âVerily,â replied the Pharisee; âlet us hasten: for this generosity in the       heathen is unwonted; and fickle-mindedness has ever been an attribute of       the worshippers of Baal.â                  âThat they are fickle-minded and treacherous is as true as the       Pentateuch,â said Buzi-Ben-Levi, âbut that is only toward the people of       Adonai. When was it ever known that the Ammonites proved wanting to their       own interests? Methinks it is no great stretch of generosity to allow us       lambs for the altar of the Lord, receiving in lieu thereof thirty silver       shekels per head!â                  âThou forgettest, however, Ben-Levi,â replied Abel-Phittim, âthat the       Roman Pompey, who is now impiously besieging the city of the Most High,       has no assurity that we apply not the lambs thus purchased for the altar,       to the sustenance of the body, rather than of the spirit.â                  âNow, by the five corners of my beard!â shouted the Pharisee, who belonged       to the sect called The Dashers (that little knot of saints whose manner of       _dashing _and lacerating the feet against the pavement was long a       thorn and a reproach to less zealous devoteesâa stumbling-block to less       gifted perambulators)ââby the five corners of that beard which, as a       priest, I am forbidden to shave!âhave we lived to see the day when a       blaspheming and idolatrous upstart of Rome shall accuse us of       appropriating to the appetites of the flesh the most holy and consecrated       elements? Have we lived to see the day whenââ            âLet us not question the motives of the Philistine,â interrupted       Abel-Phittim, âfor to-day we profit for the first time by his avarice or       by his generosity; but rather let us hurry to the ramparts, lest offerings       should be wanting for that altar whose fire the rains of heaven can not       extinguish, and whose pillars of smoke no tempest can turn aside.â                  That part of the city to which our worthy Gizbarim now hastened, and which       bore the name of its architect, King David, was esteemed the most strongly       fortified district of Jerusalem; being situated upon the steep and lofty       hill of Zion. Here, a broad, deep, circumvallatory trench, hewn from the       solid rock, was defended by a wall of great strength erected upon its       inner edge."]]]
