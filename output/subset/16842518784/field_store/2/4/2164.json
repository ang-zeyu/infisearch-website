DEATH OF A SHIP   That sigh of displaced air was not as loud as a breeze, but it echoed monstrously in Shann's ears. He could not believe in his luck as that sound grew fainter, drew away into the valley he had just left. With infinite caution he raised his head from his arm, still hardly able to accept the fact that he had not been sighted, that the Throgs and their flyer were gone.  But that black plate was spinning out into the sun haze. One of the beetles might have suspected that there were Terran fugitives and ordered a routine patrol. After all, how could the aliens know that they had caught all but one of the Survey party in camp? Though with all the Terran scout flitters grounded on the field, the men dead in their bunks, the surprise would seem to be complete.  As Shann moved, Taggi and Togi came to life also. They had gone to earth with speed, and the man was sure that both beasts had sensed danger. Not for the first time he knew a burning desire for the formal education he had never had. In camp he had listened, dragging out routine jobs in order to overhear reports and the small talk of specialists keen on their own particular hobbies. But so much of the information Shann had thus picked up to store in a retentive memory he had not understood and could not fit together. It had been as if he were trying to solve some highly important puzzle with at least a quarter of the necessary pieces missing, or with unrelated bits from others intermixed. How much control did a trained animal scout have over his furred or feathered assistants? And was part of that mastery a mental rapport built up between man and animal?  How well would the wolverines obey him now, especially when they would not return to camp where cages stood waiting as symbols of human authority? Wouldn't a trek into the wilderness bring about a revolt for complete freedom? If Shann could depend upon the animals, it would mean a great deal. Not only would their superior hunting ability provide all three with food, but their scouting senses, so much keener than his, might erect a slender wall between life and death.  Few large native beasts had been discovered on Warlock by the Terran explorers. And of those four or five different species, none had proved hostile if unprovoked. But that did not mean that somewhere back in the wild lands into which Shann was heading there were no heretofore unknowns, perhaps slyer and as vicious as the wolverines when they were aroused to rage.  Then there were the \"dreams,\" which had afforded the prime source of camp discussion and dispute. Shann brushed coarse sand from his boots and thought about the dreams. Did they or did they not exist? You could start an argument any time by making a definite statement for or against the peculiar sort of dreaming reported by the first scout to set ship on this world.  The Circe system, of which Warlock was the second of three planets, had first been scouted four years ago by one of those explorers traveling solo in Survey service. Everyone knew that the First-In Scouts were a weird breed, almost a mutation of Terran stock--their reports were rife with strange observations.  So an alarming one concerning Circe (a yellow sun such as Sol) and her three planets was not so rare. Witch, the world nearest in orbit to Circe, was too hot for human occupancy without drastic and too costly world-changing. Wizard, the third out from the sun, was mostly bare rock and highly poisonous water. But Warlock, swinging through space between two forbidding neighbors, seemed to be just what the settlement board ordered.  Then the Survey scout, even in the cocoon safety of his well-armed ship, began to dream. And from those dreams a horror of the apparently empty world developed, until he fled the planet to preserve his sanity. There had been a second visit to Warlock in check; worlds so well adapted to human emigration could not be lightly thrown away. And this time there was a negative report, no trace of dreams, no registration of any outside influence on the delicate and complicated equipment the ship carried. So the Survey team had been dispatched to prepare for the coming of the first pioneers, and none of them had dreamed either--at least, no more than the ordinary dreams all men accepted.  Only there were those who pointed out that the seasons had changed between the first and second visits to Warlock. That first scout had planeted in summer; his successors had come in fall and winter. They argued that the final release of the world for settlement should not be given until the full year on Warlock had been sampled.  But the pressure of Emigrant Control had forced their hands, that and the fear of just what had eventually happened--an attack from the Throgs. So they had speeded up the process of declaring Warlock open. Only Ragnar Thorvald had protested that decision up to the last and had gone back to headquarters on the supply ship a month ago to make a last appeal for a more careful study.  Shann stopped brushing the sand from the tough fabric above his knee. Ragnar Thorvald ... He remembered back to the port landing apron on another world, remembered with a sense of loss he could not define. That had been about the second biggest day of his short life; the biggest had come earlier when they had actually allowed him to sign on for Survey duty.  He had tumbled off the cross-continent cargo carrier, his kit--a very meager kit--slung over his thin shoulder, a hot eagerness expanding inside him until he thought that he could not continue to throttle down that wild happiness. There was a waiting starship. And he--Shann Lantee from the Dumps of Tyr, without any influence or schooling--was going to blast off in her, wearing the brown-green uniform of Survey!  Then he had hesitated uncertainly, had not quite dared cross the few feet of apron lying between him and that compact group wearing the same uniform--with a slight difference, that of service bars and completion badges and rank insignia--with the unconscious self-assurance of men who had done this many times before.  But after a moment that whole group had become in his own shy appraisal just a background for one man. Shann had never before known in his pinched and limited childhood, his lost boyhood, anyone who aroused in him hero worship. And he could not have put a name to the new emotion that added so suddenly to his burning desire to make good, not only to hold the small niche in Survey which he had already so painfully achieved, but to climb, until he could stand so in such a group talking easily to that tall man, his uncovered head bronze-yellow in the sunlight, his cool gray eyes pale in his brown face.  Not that any of those wild dreams born in that minute or two had been realized in the ensuing months. Probably those dreams had always been as wild as the ones reported by the first scout on Warlock. Shann grinned wryly now at the short period of childish hope and half-confidence that he could do big things. Only one Thorvald had ever noticed Shann's existence in the Survey camp, and that had been Garth.  Garth Thorvald, a far less impressive--one could say \"smudged\"--copy of his brother. Swaggering with an arrogance Ragnar never showed, Garth was a cadet on his first mission, intent upon making Shann realize the unbridgeable gulf between a labor hand and an officer-to-be. He had appeared to know right from their first meeting just how to make Shann's life a misery.  Now, in this slit of valley well away from the domes, Shann's fists balled. He pounded them against the earth in a way he had so often hoped to plant them on Garth's smoothly handsome face, his well-muscled body. One didn't survive the Dumps of Tyr without learning how to use fists, and boots, and a list of tricks they didn't teach in any academy. He had always been sure that he could take Garth if they mixed it up. But if he had loosed the tight rein he had kept on his temper and offered that challenge, he would have lost his chance with Survey. Garth had proved himself able to talk his way out of any scrape, even minor derelictions of duty, and he far out-ranked Shann. The laborer from Tyr had had to swallow all that the other could dish out and hope that on his next assignment he would not be a member of young Thorvald's team. Though, because of Garth Thorvald, Shann's toll of black record marks had mounted dangerously high and each day the chance for any more duty tours had grown dimmer.  Shann laughed, and the sound was ugly. That was one thing he didn't have to worry about any longer. There would be no other assignments for him, the Throgs had seen to that. And Garth ... well, there would never be a showdown between them now. He stood up. The Throg ship had disappeared; they could push on.  He found a break in the cliff wall which was climbable, and he coaxed the wolverines after him. When they stood on the heights from which the falls tumbled, Taggi and Togi rubbed against him, cried for his attention. They, too, appeared to need the reassurance they got from contact with him, for they were also fugitives on this alien world, the only representatives of their kind.  Since he did not have any definite goal in view, Shann continued to be guided by the stream, following its wanderings across a plateau. The sun was warm, so he carried his jacket slung across one shoulder. Taggi and Togi ranged ahead, twice catching skitterers, which they devoured voraciously. A shadow on a sun-baked rock sent the Terran skidding for cover until he saw that it was cast by one of the questing falcons from the upper peaks. But that shook his confidence, so he again sought cover, ashamed at his own carelessness.  In the late afternoon he reached the far end of the plateau, faced a climb to peaks which still bore cones of snow, now tinted a soft peach by the sun. Shann studied that possible path and distrusted his own"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20789"],["title","The Grammar School Boys Snowbound; or, Dick & Co. at Winter Sports (#1)"],["body","ne, I know, Ben, if you want him to,\" proposed Dave Darrin, coming slowly into the circle. \"But perhaps you don't want to fight Dick. You tried it once before, and got most beautifully pounded.\"  \"Yah!\" snarled Ben.  \"Well, didn't you?\" demanded Dave.  \"Yah!\" sneered Ben. \"See here, Darrin, Prescott may be fresh, but he ain't as bad as you are!\"  \"So it's I you want to fight with, is it?\" laughed Dave. \"Come right on to the shore, then, and don't try any bluffing.\"  But Ben Alvord didn't care about putting up his guard before either of these spirited youngsters of the Central Grammar School. After sputtering a little Ben skated away by himself. Hen got up, after dabbing his upper lip with his handkerchief and finding that the scratch amounted to nothing. No further effort was made to molest Hen.  \"Now, when you talk, say something pleasant. Don't talk so disagreeably all the time,\" advised Prescott in a low tone. \"At least, not unless you're really hunting trouble.\"  \"This is the meanest crowd I ever saw,\" declared Hen Dutcher stiffly. \"And you started it all, Dave Darrin, by nicknaming me 'Anvil Chorus!'\"  \"You're at it again, Hen,\" sighed Dick. \"Why can't you stop saying disagreeable things?\"  Toby Ross, who had skated close enough to hear this last, now skated away again to join a crowd of boys a little way off. Toby spoke to them laughingly. Then, over the ice, came a mocking chorus:  \"Oh, you Anvil!\"  \"There, you see,\" muttered Dutcher angrily, \"you've gone and fastened the nickname on me!\"  \"Anvil! Anvil!\" yelled other tormentors.  \"You're all of you about the meanest crowd of fellows I ever saw,\" grunted Hen, as he started slowly to skate away.  \"And that's all the thanks you get, Dick, for trying to use him a bit decently,\" jeered Greg Holmes.  \"Oh, well, I'm sorry for the fellow,\" muttered Prescott. \"Hen is one of those fellows who are never popular with any crowd and can never understand why.\"  Harry Hazelton and Dan Dalzell now skated up from town and joined their chums. Dick & Co. were at last united.  \"Let's try a two-mile swift skate up river, fellows,\" urged Dick. \"Ready? Go!\"  Away went the six, moving along over the ice like young human whirlwinds. Dick & Co. were known to be the best skaters of all the Grammar School boys in town.  Dick & Co. will need no introduction to the readers of the first volume in this series, entitled \"THE GRAMMAR SCHOOL BOYS OF GRIDLEY.\" Our readers have met all six of the young men, namely, Dick Prescott, Dave Darrin, Greg Holmes, Dan Dalzell, Tom Reade and Harry Hazelton. It would be hard to find six manlier boys of thirteen--now all of them close to their fourteenth birthdays.  Readers of the previous volume know on what grounds it can be claimed that these six were real leaders of the little Grammar School world of Gridley. Dick & Co. were ardent lovers of all forms of outdoor sports. All were keen for baseball. As runners these six youngsters were just beginning to develop as a result of self-training. The September before Dick Prescott had organized, at the Central Grammar School, a football squad. Things were moving well in this line until delegations came over from the North and South Grammars, to see about organizing a Grammar School football league. The delegates from the two other schools, however, displayed lack of harmony, and the football idea fell through.  Now, however, winter was on in earnest, and Dick & Co. were in their element, for, of all sports, they loved those that went with winter. All six were fearless coasters; no hill was too steep, too long or too dangerous. On the ice Dick & Co. felt all the bounding pulse of life.  This day was the twenty-fourth of December. School had closed in order to give the Gridley youngsters a free hand on the last day before Christmas.  The river had been frozen in fine condition for more than a week. Not more than four inches of snow had fallen, but all the boys knew that the season gave promise of more snow ere long.  As Dick & Co. skated along the number of other skaters became fewer. At last they reached a part of the river where they had the ice all to themselves.  \"There's Payson's orchard, Greg,\" sang out Dave Darrin. \"The place where you got grabbed last fall, by Dexter and Driggs, and carried off to be shut up in that cave.\"  \"Say, we ought to hunt up that cave, fellows,\" called Greg. \"Whee! It might make a bully place for a winter camp. Now, that we've got the two weeks and more of holiday vacation, wouldn't it be fine to slip off and camp a few days in that cave?\"  \"Nothing doing,\" retorted Tom Reade.  \"Why not?\" Dan asked.  \"You remember that I went off, yesterday after school, on a sleigh ride with Jim Foley?\"  \"Yes.\"  \"Well, we went by that cave,\" Tom continued. \"Nothing would do but that we stop. Jim had a lantern on the sleigh. We lit the lantern and got into the cave. Whew! We nearly got drowned. I meant to tell you fellows about it, but forgot it.\"  \"How did you come near getting drowned in a cave?\" Greg demanded.  \"Why, the outlandish place isn't weather-tight,\" responded Tom. \"You know, the flooring slopes slightly upward from the entrance. There are a lot of cracks that rain and snow-water leak through. It was all little rivulets inside the place. Camp? Huh! It'd make a better extra reservoir for the town water-works, that place would!\"  \"Too bad!\" muttered Greg. \"I have had a notion that it would be huge fun to camp out in such a place.\"  \"I've got another idea about that,\" spoke up Dan.  \"Fire away!\" begged Reade.  \"A cousin of mine who visited me last summer told me about the kind of camp he and some of his chums had. It was a sort of manufactured cave. The fellows dug an oblong hole in the ground. Just like a cellar in shape, you know. It was eight feet wide and twelve feet long. When they had it all dug out the fellows laid boards over the hole for a roof. Then they piled dirt back on top of the boards, and on top of the dirt they laid the sods that they first dug up. At a corner in one end the fellows left a square hole in the roof, to use for an entrance. For a door they made a square board cover to fit over the entrance hole. At the upper end of the cave they dug into the dirt wall and made a stove. They dug another hole down from above to connect with it, and that made a dandy stove and chimney. My cousin and his chums used to do a lot of cooking there. Then they laid down more old boards to make a floor, and boarded most of the wall space, too. Last of all, they took up an old table and old chairs, and they had just a dandy camp! Say, fellows, why couldn't we have a camp like that?\"  \"It would do all right for springtime,\" declared Tom Reade, \"but we couldn't work it in winter.\"  \"Why not?\" challenged Dan.  \"Not unless, Danny, you want to be the strong man who's going to dig down into the ground through two or three feet of frost.\"  Dan looked a bit crestfallen.  \"Besides,\" declared Dick thoughtfully, \"every time there was a thaw or a big rain the cave you're talking about making would be nothing but a big cistern, half-full of water. But we could dig and fit up such a cave somewhere in the woods in springtime, fellows.\"  \"Only we don't have much vacation in the spring,\" broke in Greg disappointedly, \"and it certainly would be grand to go into camp right after Christmas Day, if we could be warm enough and have enough to eat.\"  \"It would be great sport,\" nodded Dick.  \"Then let's do it,\" glowed Greg.  \"I suppose you have the camping place all picked out, and permission to use it,\" smiled Prescott.  \"Well, no,\" admitted Greg. \"But why can't we fix up some sort of place?\"  \"How?\" Dave Darrin wanted to know. \"If we try going into camp at this time of the year we want, first of all, some place above ground, with enough daylight and sunlight. We want a weather-tight place that we can keep properly warm.\"  \"All of that,\" agreed Dick.  \"Why can't we build a place, out in the woods somewhere?\" Greg insisted.  \"For one thing,\" objected Tom Reade quizzically, \"there are no leaves at this time of the year.\"  \"What do we want leaves for?\" queried Greg.  \"To lay on the roof, like shingles.\"  \"Bosh!\" snapped Holmes. \"We'd build our camp of wood.\"  \"Well, where'll we get the wood?\" came from Dave.  \"We can carry it from home,\" proposed Greg.  \"No lumber pile in our yard. Is there in yours?\" Dave insisted.  \"We can use the boards from old boxes and things,\" went on Greg desperately.  \"Oh, excuse me!\" mimicked Tom Reade. \"I am not camping out in any grocery boxes at this cold time of the year.\"  \"You might go home nights, then,\" hinted Greg disdainfully.  \"The whole camping idea is a great one, if we could only put it through,\" declared Dick.  \"Then let's put it through,\" pressed Greg Holmes. \"Where there's a will there's a way, you know.\"  \"The trouble is that we need a pocketbook more than a will,\" returned Prescott doubtfully. \"It would take lumber to build a winter camp, even if we could prove ourselves good enough carpenters.\"  \"How much money would it take?\"  \"Well, I don't believe a hundred dollars would go far,\" declared Reade.  \"Make it a thousand, then,\" laughed Darrin. \"We fellows couldn't raise either sum in a year.\"  \"It's too bad,\" sighed Harry Hazelton. \"A good camp, at this time of the year, would be huge fun!\"  \"Yes; it would,\" agreed Dick. \"I don't see the way now, but we may find it. We can keep on hoping.\"  \"Hey, you boobs!\" called a disagreeable voice across the ice.  All of the six Grammar School boys slowed down and turned around. They found themselves looking at a solitary skater who had slowed down. He was Fred Ripley, son of Lawyer Ripley, one of the wealthy men of the town. Fred was never over polite to those whom he considered as his \"inferiors.\" Besides, young Ripley was now in his freshman year at the Gridley High School. As such, he naturally looked down on mere Grammar School boys, none of whom, perhaps, would ever reach the dignity of \"attending High.\"  \"What do"]]]
