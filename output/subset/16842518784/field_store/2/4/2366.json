Having refilled and relighted it, he drew his blanket over his shoulder, laid his head upon a tuft of grass, and continued to smoke until he fell asleep, and allowed the pipe to fall from his lips.  The Indian followed his example, with this difference, that he laid aside his pipe, and drew the blanket over his head and under his feet, and wrapped it round him in such a way that he resembled a man sewed up in a sack.  Heywood was thus compelled to shut his sketch-book; so he also wrapped himself in his blanket, and was soon sound asleep.  The camp-fire gradually sank low.  Once or twice the end of a log fell, sending up a bright flame and a shower of sparks, which, for a few seconds, lighted up the scene again and revealed the three slumbering figures.  But at last the fire died out altogether, and left the encampment in such thick darkness that the sharpest eye would have failed to detect the presence of man in that distant part of the lone wilderness.    CHAPTER FOUR.  MOSQUITOES--CAMP-FIRE TALK.  There is a certain fly in the American forests which is worthy of notice, because it exercises a great influence over the happiness of man in those regions.  This fly is found in many other parts of the world, but it swarms in immense numbers in America, particularly in the swampy districts of that continent, and in the hot months of summer.  It is called a mosquito--pronounced _moskeeto_--and it is, perhaps, the most tormenting, the most persevering, savage, vicious little monster on the face of the earth.  Other flies go to sleep at night; the mosquito never does.  Darkness puts down other flies--it seems to encourage the mosquito.  Day and night it persecutes man and beast, and the only time of the twenty-four hours in which it seems to rest is about noon, when the heat puts _it_ down for a little.  But this period of rest strengthens it for a renewal of war during the remainder of the day and night.  In form the mosquito very much resembles the gnat, but is somewhat larger.  This instrument of torture is his nose, which is quite as long as his body, and sharper than the finest needle.  Being unable to rest because of the mosquitoes, Heywood resolved to have a chat.  \"Come, Jasper,\" said he, looking up into his companion's grave countenance, \"although we have been many weeks on this journey now, you have not yet told me what has brought you here, or what the end of your trip is going to be.\"  \"I've come here a-hunting,\" said Jasper, with the look and tone of a man who did not wish to be questioned.  \"Nay, now, I know that is not the reason,\" said Heywood, smiling; \"you could have hunted much nearer home, if you had been so minded, and to as good purpose.  Come, Jasper, you know I'm your friend, and that I wish you well.  Let me hear what has brought you so far into the wilderness-- mayhap I can give you some good advice if you do.\"  \"Well, lad, I don't mind if I do.  Though, for the matter of good advice, I don't feel much in need of any just at this time.\"  Jasper shook the ashes out of his pipe, and refilled it as he spoke; then he shook his head once or twice and smiled, as if his thoughts amused him.  Having lighted the pipe, he stretched himself out in a more comfortable way before the blaze, and said--  \"Well, lad, I'll tell ye what it is--it's the old story; the love of woman has brought me here.\"  \"And a very good old story it is,\" returned Heywood, with a look of interest.  \"A poor miserable set of creatures we should be without that same love of woman.  Come, Jasper, I'm glad to hear you're such a sensible fellow.  I know something about that subject myself.  There's a pretty blue-eyed girl, with golden hair, down away in Canada that--\" Heywood stopped short in his speech and sighed.  \"Come, it ain't a hopeless case, is it?\" said Jasper, with a look of sympathy.  \"I rather fear it is; but I hope not.  Ah, what should we do without hope in this world?\"  \"That's true,\" observed Jasper, with much gravity, \"we could not get on at all without hope.\"  \"But come, Jasper,\" said the artist, \"let's hear about your affair, and I'll tell you about mine some other time.\"  \"Well, there is not much to tell, but I'll give ye all that's of it. You must know, then, that about two years ago I was in the service of the Hudson's Bay Company, at one o' their outposts in the McKenzie's River district.  We had little to eat there and little to do, and I felt so lonesome, never seein' a human bein' except the four or five men at the fort an' a few Indians, that I made up my mind to quit.  I had no reason to complain o' the Company, d'ye see.  They always treated me handsomely, and it was no fault o' theirs that the livin' in that district was poor and the post lonesome.  \"Well, on my way down to Lake Winnipeg, I fell in with a brigade o' boats goin' to the Saskatchewan district, and we camped together that night.  One o' the guides of the Saskatchewan brigade had his daughter with him.  The guide was a French-Canadian, and his wife had been a Scotch half-caste, so what the daughter was is more than I can tell; but I know what she looked like.  She just looked like an angel.  It wasn't so much that she was pretty, but she was so sweet, and so quiet lookin', and so innocent!  Well, to cut the matter short, I fell in love at once. D'ye know what it is, Heywood, to fall in love at first sight?\"  \"Oh! don't I?\" replied the artist with sudden energy.  \"An' d'ye know,\" continued Jasper, \"what it is to be fallen-in-love-with, at first sight?\"  \"Well, no, I'm not so sure about that,\" replied Heywood sadly.  \"I do, then,\" said Jasper, \"for that sweet critter fell in love with me right off--though what she saw in me to love has puzzled me much. Howsoever, she did, and for that I'm thankful.  Her name is Marie Laroche.  She and I opened our minds to each other that night, and I took the guide, her father, into the woods, and told him I wanted his daughter; and he was agreeable; but he would not hear of my takin' her away then and there.  He told me I must go down to Canada and get settled, and when I had a house to put his daughter in, I was to come back into the wilderness here and be married to her, and then take her home--so here I am on my way to claim my bride.  But there's one thing that puzzles me sorely.\"  \"What is that?\" asked Heywood.  \"I've never heard from Marie from that day to this,\" said Jasper.  \"That is strange,\" replied the other; \"but perhaps she cannot write.\"  \"That's true.  Now, you speak of it, I do believe she can't write a line; but, then, she might have got some one to write for her.\"  \"Did you leave your address with her?\"  \"How could I, when I had no address to leave?\"  \"But did you ever send it to her?\"  \"No, I never thought of that,\" said Jasper, opening his eyes very wide. \"Come, that's a comfort--that's a good reason for never havin' heard from her.  Thankee, lad, for putting me up to it.  And, now, as we must be up and away in another hour, I'll finish my nap.\"  So saying, Jasper put out his pipe and once more drew his blanket over him.  Heywood followed his example, and while he lay there gazing up at the stars through the trees, he heard the worthy hunter muttering to himself, \"That's it; that accounts for my not hearin' from her.\"  A sigh followed the words, very soon a snore followed the sigh, and ere many minutes had passed away, the encampment was again buried in darkness and repose.    CHAPTER FIVE.  JOURNEYING IN THE WILDERNESS.  It seemed to Heywood that he had not been asleep more than five minutes, when he was aroused by Jasper laying his heavy hand on his shoulder.  On rubbing his eyes and gazing round him, he found that the first streak of dawn was visible in the eastern sky, that the canoe was already in the water, and that his companions were ready to embark.  It is usually found that men are not disposed to talk at that early hour.  Heywood merely remarked that it was a fine morning, to which Jasper replied by a nod of his head.  Nothing more was said.  The artist rolled up his blanket in a piece of oiled-cloth, collected his drawing materials and put them into their bag, got into his place in the centre of the canoe, and immediately went to sleep, while Jasper and the Indian, taking their places in the bow and stern, dipped the paddles into the water and shot away from the shore.  They looked mysterious and ghostly in the dim morning light; and the whole scene around them looked mysterious and ghostly too, for the water in the lake seemed black, and the shores and islands looked like dark shadows, and a pale thin mist rolled slowly over the surface of the water and hung overhead.  No sound was heard except the light plash of the paddles as the two backwoodsmen urged their little canoe swiftly along.  By degrees the light of day increased, and Jasper awakened Heywood in order that he might behold the beautiful scenery through which they passed.  They were now approaching the upper end of the lake, in which there were innumerable islands of every shape and size--some of them not more than a few yards in length, while some were two or three hundred yards across, but all were clothed with the most beautiful green foliage and shrubbery.  As the pale yellow of the eastern sky began to grow red, ducks and gulls bestirred themselves.  Early risers among them first began to chirp, and scream, and whistle their morning song,--for there are lazy ones among the birds, just as there are among men.  Sometimes, when the canoe rounded a point of rocks a flock of geese were found floating peacefully among the sedges, sound asleep, with their heads under their wings.  These would leap into the air and fly off in great alarm, with much difficulty and tremendous splutter, reminding one of the proverb, \"The more haste the less speed.\"  At other times they would come upon a flock of ducks so suddenly, that they had no time to take wing,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21716"],["title","The Battery and the Boiler: Adventures in Laying of Submarine Electric Cables (#1)"],["body","before the Christian era, Thales, one of the Greek sages, discovered that he hid himself in amber, a substance which in Greek is named _electron_--hence his name Electricity; but the ancients knew little about his character, though Thales found that he could draw him from his hiding-place by rubbing him with silk and some other substances.  When thus rubbed he became attractive, and drew light creatures towards him--not unlike human sparks!  He also showed himself to be fickle, for, after holding these light creatures tight for a brief space, he let them go and repelled them.  It was not till the days of good Queen Bess, towards the end of the sixteenth century, that a Dr Gilbert discovered that the wild fellow lay lurking in other substances besides amber--such as sulphur, wax, glass, etcetera.  It is now known that Electricity permeates all substances more or less, and only waits to be roused in order to exhibit his amazing powers.  He is fond of shocking people's feelings, and has surprised his pursuers rather frequently in that way.  Some of them, indeed, he has actually shocked to death!  It would take a huge volume to give a detailed account of all the qualities, powers, and peculiarities of this wild Spark.  We will just touch on a few facts which are necessary to the elucidation of our tale.  A great event in the world's history happened in the year 1745.  It was nothing less than the capture and imprisonment of wild, daring, dashing Electricity.  To the Dutch philosophers belongs the honour of catching him.  They caught him--they even bottled him, like ordinary spirits, and called his prison a _Leyden Jar_.  From that date our Spark became the useful and obedient slave of man. Yet is he ever ready, when the smallest conceivable door, hole, or chink is left open, to dash out of the prison-house man has made for him, and escape into his native earth.  He has no hope now, however, of escaping altogether, for he cannot resist the allurement of rubbing, by which, as well as by chemical action and other means, we can summon him, like the genii of Aladdin's lamp, at any moment, from the \"vasty deep,\" and compel him to do our work.  And what sort of work, it may be asked, can this volatile fellow perform?  We cannot tell all--the list is too long.  Let us consider a few of them.  If we fabricate tea-pots, sugar-basins, spoons, or anything else of base metal, he can and will, at our bidding, cover the same with silver or yellow gold.  If we grow dissatisfied with our candles and gas, he will, on being summoned, and properly directed by the master minds to whom he owns allegiance, kindle our lamps and fill our streets and mansions with a blaze of noonday splendour.  If we grow weary of steam, and give him orders, he will drive our tram-cars and locomotives with railway speed, _minus_ railway smoke and fuss.  He is a very giant in the chemist's laboratory, and, above all, a swift messenger to carry the world's news.  Even when out and raging to and fro in a wild state, more than half-disposed to rend our mansions, and split our steeples, and wreck our ships, we have only to provide him with a tiny metal stair-case, down which he will instantly glide from the upper regions to the earth without noise or damage.  Shakespeare never imagined, and Mercury never accomplished, the speed at which he travels; and he will not only carry our news, or express our sentiments and wishes far and wide over the land, but he will rush with them, over rock, sand, mud, and ooze, along the bottom of the deep deep sea!  And this brings us to a point.  Some of the master minds before mentioned, having conceived the idea that telegraphic communication might be carried on under water, set about experimenting.  Between the years 1839 and 1851 enterprising men in the Old World and the New suggested, pondered, planned, and placed wires under water, along which our Spark ran more or less successfully.  One of the difficulties of these experiments consisted in this, that, while the Spark runs readily along one class of substances, he cannot, or will not, run along others.  Substances of the first class, comprising the metals, are called conductors; those of the second class, embracing, among other things, all resinous substances, are styled non-conductors.  Now, water is a good conductor.  So that although the Spark will stick to his wires when insulated on telegraph-posts on land, he will bolt from them at once and take to flight the moment he gets under water.  This difficulty was overcome by coating the wires with gutta-percha, which, being a non-conductor, imprisoned the Spark, and kept him, as it were, on the line.  A copper wire covered in this manner was successfully laid between England and France in 1850.  When tested, this cable did not work well. Minute imperfections, in the form of air-holes in the gutta-percha, afforded our Spark an opportunity to bolt; and he did bolt, as a matter of course--for electricity has no sense of honour, and cannot be trusted near the smallest loop-hole.  The imperfections were remedied; the door was effectually locked, after which the first submarine cable of importance was actually laid down, and worked well.  French and English believers turned up hands and eyes in delighted amazement, as they held converse across the sea, while unbelievers were silenced and confounded.  This happy state of things, however, lasted for only a few hours. Suddenly the intercourse ceased.  The telegraphists at both ends energised with their handles and needles, but without any result.  The cable was dumb.  Our Spark had evidently escaped!  There is no effect without a cause.  The cause of that interruption was soon discovered.  Early that morning a French fisherman had sauntered down to the port of Boulogne and embarked in his boat.  A British seaman, having nothing to do but smoke and meditate, was seated on a coil of rope at the time, enjoying himself and the smells with which that port is not unfamiliar. He chanced to be a friend of that French fisherman.  \"You're early afloat, Mounseer,\" he said.  \"Oui, monsieur.  Vill you com'?  I go for feesh.\"  \"Well, _wee_; I go for fun.\"  They went accordingly and bore away to the northward along the coast before a light breeze,--past the ruined towers which France had built to guard her port in days gone by; past the steep cliffs beyond Boulogne; past the lovely beach of Wimereux, with its cottages nestled among the sand-hills, and its silted-up harbour, whence Napoleon the First had intended to issue forth and descend on perfidious Albion--but didn't; past cliffs, and bays, and villages further on, until they brought up off Cape Grisnez.  Here the Frenchman let down his trawl, and fished up, among other curiosities of the deep, the submarine cable!  \"Behold! fat is dis?\" he exclaimed, with glaring eyes, uplifted brows, shoulders shrugged, hands spread out, and fingers expanded.  \"The sea-sarpint grow'd thin,\" suggested the Englishman.  \"Non; c'est seaveed--veed de most 'strordinair in de vorld.  Oui, donnez-moi de hache, de hax, mon ami.\"  His friend handed him the axe, wherewith lie cut off a small portion of the cable and let the end go.  Little did that fisherman know that he had also let our Spark go free, and cruelly dashed, for a time at least, the budding hopes of two nations--but so it was.  He bore his prize in triumph to Boulogne, where he exhibited it as a specimen of rare seaweed with its centre filled with gold, while the telegraph clerks at both ends sat gazing in dismay at their useless instruments.  Thus was the first submarine electric cable destroyed.  And with the details of its destruction little Robin was intimately acquainted, for cousin Sam had been a member of the staff that had worked that telegraph--at least he had been a boy in the office,--and in after years he so filled his cousin's mind with the importance of that cable, and the grandeur and difficulty of the enterprise, that Robin became powerfully sympathetic--so much so that when Sam, in telling the story, came to the point where the Frenchman accomplished its destruction, Robin used to grieve over it as though he had lost a brother, or a kitten, or his latest toy!  We need scarcely add that submarine cable telegraphy had not received its death-blow on that occasion.  Its possibility had been demonstrated. The very next year (1851) Mr T.R. Crampton, with Messrs. Wollaston, Kuper, and others, made and laid an improved cable between Dover and Calais, and ere long many other parts of the world were connected by means of snaky submarine electric cables.    CHAPTER THREE.  EARLY ASPIRATIONS.  One pleasant summer afternoon, Mr Wright, coming in from the office, seated himself beside his composed little wife, who was patching a pair of miniature pantaloons.  \"Nan,\" said the husband, with a perplexed look, \"what _are_ we to do with our Robin when he grows up?\"  \"George,\" answered the composed wife, \"don't you think it is rather soon to trouble ourselves with that question?  Robin is a mere child yet.  We must first give him a good education.\"  \"Of course, I know that,\" returned the perplexed husband, \"still, I can't help thinking about what is to be done after he has had the good education.  You know I have no relation in the world except brother Richard, who is as poor as myself.  We have no influential friends to help him into the Army or the Navy or the Indian Civil Service; and the Church, you know, is not suitable for an imp.  Just look at him _now_!\"  Mrs Wright looked through the window, over one of those sunny landscapes which are usually described as \"smiling,\" across a winding rivulet, and at last fixed her gorgeous eyes on a tall post, up which a small black object was seen to be struggling.  \"What can he be up to?\" said the father.  \"He seems to be up the telegraph-post,\" said the mother, \"investigating the wires, no doubt.  I heard him talking about telegraphy to Madge this morning--re"]]]
