Moreover, they were not what he expected to hear from the lips of a Dogrib.  \"I never liked fighting,\" he said in a low voice, \"though I have always been able to fight.  It does nobody any good, and it always does everybody much harm, for it loses much blood, and it leaves many women and children without food-providers--which is uncomfortable for the men who have enough of women and children of their own to hunt for.  But,\" continued the youth with emphasis, \"I always thought that the men of the woods loved fighting.\"  \"Some of them do, but I hate it!\" said the Indian with a sudden look of such ferocity that the Eskimo might have been justified in doubting the truth of the statement.  The flash, however, quickly disappeared, and a double wreath of smoke issued from his nose as he remarked quietly, \"Fighting lost me my father, my two brothers, and my only son.\"  \"Why, then, do you still come against us with fire-spouters?\" asked Cheenbuk.  \"Because my people will have it so,\" returned the red man.  \"I do what I can to stop them, but I am only one, and there are many against me.\"  \"I too have tried to stop my people when they would fight among themselves,\" returned the Eskimo in a tone of sympathy; \"but it is easier to kill a walrus single-handed than to turn an angry man from his purpose.\"  The Indian nodded assent, as though a chord had been struck which vibrated in both bosoms.  \"My son,\" he said, in a patronising tone, \"do not cease to try.  Grey hairs are beginning to show upon my head; I have seen and learned much, and I have come to know that only he who tries, and tries, and tries again to do what he knows is right will succeed.  To him the Great Manitou will give his blessing.\"  \"My father,\" replied the other, falling in readily with the fictitious relationship, \"I will try.\"  Having thus come to a satisfactory agreement, this Arctic Peace Society prepared to adjourn.  Each wiped his knife on the grass and sheathed it as he rose up.  Then they shook hands again after the fashion of the pale-faces, and departed on their respective ways.  The red man returned to the wigwams of his people, while the young Eskimo, descending the river in his kayak, continued to hunt the white-whale and pursue the feathered tribes which swarmed in the creeks, rivulets, and marshes that bordered the ice-encumbered waters of the polar seas.    CHAPTER TWO.  WARUSKEEK.  Alas for the hopes and efforts of good men!  At the very time that Cheenbuk and the Indian were expressing their detestation of war, elsewhere a young Eskimo was doing his best to bring about that unhappy and ruinous condition of things.  He was an unusually strong young Arctic swashbuckler, with considerably more muscle than brains, a restless spirit, and what may be styled a homicidal tendency.  He was also tyrannical, like many men of that stamp, and belonged to the same tribe as Cheenbuk.  Walrus Creek was the summer residence of the tribe of Eskimos to which Cheenbuk belonged.  It was a narrow inlet which ran up into a small island lying some distance off the northern shores of America, to discover and coast along which has been for so many years the aim and ambition of Arctic explorers.  How it came by its name is not difficult to guess.  Probably in ages past some adventurous voyagers, whose names and deeds have not been recorded in history, observing the numbers of walruses which scrambled out of the sea to sun themselves on the cliffs of the said creek, had named it after that animal, and the natives had adopted the name.  Like other aborigines they had garbled it, however, and handed it down to posterity as Waruskeek, while the walruses, perhaps in order to justify the name, had kept up the custom of their forefathers, and continued to sun themselves there as in days of yore. Seals also abounded in the inlet, and multitudes of aquatic birds swarmed around its cliffs.  The Eskimo village which had been built there, unlike the snow-hut villages of winter, was composed chiefly of huts made of slabs of stone, intermingled with moss and clay.  It was exceeding dirty, owing to remnants of blubber, shreds of skins, and bones innumerable, which were left lying about.  There might have been about forty of these huts, at the doors of which--or the openings which served for doors--only women and children were congregated at the time we introduce them to the reader.  All the men, with the exception of a few ancients, were away hunting.  In the centre of the village there stood a hut which was larger and a little cleaner than the others around it.  An oldish man with a grey beard was seated on a stone bench beside the door.  If tobacco had been known to the tribe, he would probably have been smoking.  In default of that he was thrown back upon meditation.  Apparently his meditations were not satisfactory, for he frowned portentously once or twice, and shook his head.  \"You are not pleased to-day, Mangivik,\" said a middle-aged woman who issued from the hut at the moment and sat down beside the man.  \"No, woman, I am not,\" he answered shortly.  Mangivik meant no disrespect by addressing his wife thus.  \"Woman\" was the endearing term used by him on all occasions when in communication with her.  \"What troubles you?  Are you hungry?\"  \"No.  I have just picked a walrus rib clean.  It is not that.\"  He pointed, as he spoke, to a huge bone of the animal referred to.  \"No, it is not that,\" he repeated.  \"What then?  Is it something you may not tell me?\" asked the woman in a wheedling tone, as she crossed her legs and toyed with the flap of her tail.  Lest the civilised reader should be puzzled, we may here remark that the costume of the husband and wife whom we have introduced--as, indeed, of most if not all Eskimo men and women--is very similar in detail as well as material.  Mangivik wore a coat or shirt of seal-skin with a hood to it, and his legs were encased in boots of the same material, which were long enough to cover nearly the whole of each leg and meet the skirt of the coat.  The feet of the boots were of tough walrus-hide, and there was a short peak to the coat behind.  The only difference in the costume of the woman was that the hood of her coat was larger, to admit of infants and other things being carried in it, and the peak behind was prolonged into a tail with a broad flap at the end.  This tail varied a little in length according to the taste of the wearer--like our ladies' skirts; but in all cases it was long enough to trail on the ground-- perhaps we should say the ice--and, from the varied manner in which different individuals caused it to sweep behind them, it was evident that the tail, not less than the civilised skirt, served the purpose of enabling the wearers to display more or less of graceful motion.  \"There is nothing that I have to hide from my woman,\" said the amiable Eskimo, in reply to her question.  \"Only I am troubled about that jump-about man Gartok.\"  \"Has he been here again?\" asked the wife, with something of a frown on her fat face.  \"He is just as you say, a jump-about like the little birds that come to us in the hot times, which don't seem to know what they want.\"  \"He is too big to look like them,\" returned the husband.  \"He's more like a mad walrus.  I met him on one of the old floes when I was after a seal, and he frightened it away.  But it is not that that troubles me. There are two things he is after: he wants to stir up our young men to go and fight with the Fire-spouters, and he wants our Nootka for a wife.\"  \"The dirty walrus!\" exclaimed Mrs Mangivik, with as much vigour as if she had been civilised, \"he shall _never_ have Nootka.  As for fighting with the Fire-spouters, I only hope that if he does go to do so, he will get killed and never come back.\"  \"H'm!\" grunted Mangivik, \"if he does get killed he's not likely to come back.\"  \"Who is not likely to come back?\" asked a young girl, with an affectionate expression in her pretty brown eyes, issuing from the hut at that moment and seating herself close to the old man.  The girl's face, on the whole, was unusually pretty for that of an Eskimo, and would have been still more so but for the grease with which it was besmeared--for the damsel had just been having a little refreshment of white-whale blubber.  Her figure was comparatively slim and graceful, and would have been obviously so but for the ill-fitting coat and clumsy boots with which it was covered.  \"Your mother and I were talking of a bad man, Nootka,\" said Mangivik.  \"Ay, a very very bad man,\" exclaimed Mrs Mangivik, with a decided nod of her head.  \"If he is so very bad,\" returned Nootka, \"it would be good that he should never come back.  Who is it?\"  \"Gartok,\" answered her mother, with the air of one who has mentioned the most hateful thing in creation.  Nootka laughed.  \"Surely you are not fond of him!\" exclaimed Mangivik, regarding his daughter with a look of anxiety.  \"You know that I'm not,\" answered the girl, playfully hitting her sire on the back with the flap of her tail.  \"Of course not--of course not; you could not be fond of an ugly walrus like him,\" said the father, replying to her pleasantry by fondly patting her knee.  Just then a young man was seen advancing from the beach, where he had left his kayak.  \"It is Oolalik,\" said Mrs Mangivik, shading her eyes with her hand from the sun, which, in all the strength of its meridian splendour, was shining full on her fat face.  \"He must have made a good hunt, or he would not have come home before the others.\"  As she spoke Nootka arose hastily and re-entered the hut, from out of which there issued almost immediately the sounds and the savoury odours of roasting flesh.  Meanwhile Oolalik came up and gave vent to a polite grunt, or some such sound, which was the Eskimo method of expressing a friendly salutation.  Mangivik and his wife grumped in reply.  \"Y"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21710"],["title","The Crew of the Water Wagtail (#1)"],["body","disposed.  You'll join us in that, Grummidge, won't you?  And we'll make you skipper--or first mate, if you're too modest to take command.\"  This sally was received with a subdued laugh, and with marks of such decided approval, that Grummidge was carried with the current--at all events, he held his tongue after that.  An earnest undertoned discussion followed, and it was finally arranged that Big Swinton should sound Master Trench about the propriety of running to Newfoundland instead of returning on their track to Norway. The seaman was not slow to act.  That afternoon, while at the helm, he made the suggestion to the skipper, but met with a sharp rebuke and an order to attend to his duty.  No word did Big Swinton reply, but that very night he entered the cabin with a dozen men and seized the skipper, his son, and Paul Burns, while they slept.  Of course, being greatly outnumbered, they were overcome and bound.  The two officers of the vessel were also seized by another party on deck, and all the five were imprisoned in the hold.  Next morning they were brought on deck, and made to stand in a row before Big Swinton, who had, in the meantime, been appointed by the mutineers to the command of the ship.  \"Now, Master Trench,\" said Swinton, \"we are no pirates.  We have no desire to kill you, so that whether you are killed or not will depend on yourself.  If you agree to navigate this ship to Newfoundland--good; if not we will heave you overboard.\"  \"Heave away then,\" growled the skipper, his nature being such that the more he was defied the more defiant he became.  \"Well, Master Trench, you shall have your way.  Get the plank ready, boys,\" said Swinton, turning to the men.  \"Now stand aside and let the first mate choose.\"  The same question being put to the two mates, they returned similar answers, and were ordered to prepare to walk the plank.  \"You don't understand navigation, I fancy, Master Burns,\" said Swinton to Paul, \"but as you can set broken bones, and things of that sort, we will spare you if you agree to serve us.\"  \"Thank you,\" replied Paul, with quiet urbanity.  \"I prefer to accompany Master Trench, if you have no objection.\"  There was a slight laugh at the coolness of this reply, which enraged the new skipper.  \"Say you so?\" he exclaimed, jumping up.  \"Come, then, shove out the plank, lads, and bring them on one at a time.\"  \"Stop!\" cried little Oliver, at this point.  \"You've forgot _me_.\"  \"No, my little man, I haven't,\" returned Swinton, with a cynical smile. \"You shall accompany your amiable father; but first I'll give you a fair chance,\" he added, in a bantering tone: \"will _you_ navigate the ship?\"  \"Yes, I will,\" answered Oliver promptly.  \"Indeed!\" exclaimed the new skipper, taken aback by the boy's boldness, and at a loss for a reply.  \"Yes, indeed,\" retorted Oliver, \"only put me in command, with an auger, and I'll navigate the ship to the bottom of the sea, with you and all your cowardly crew on board of her!\"  \"Well said, little master,\" cried Grummidge, while a general laugh of approval went round.  Seeing that there was a symptom of better feeling among some of the men, Master Trench was about to make an appeal to them, when--  \"Land ho!\" was shouted by the look-out in stentorian tones.    CHAPTER TWO.  THE ADVENTURERS LAND ON THE ISLAND.  The excitement caused by the sight of land was tremendous.  Nearly every one ran to the bow or leaped on the bulwarks, and the prisoners were left unguarded.  Seeing this, Grummidge quietly cut their bonds unobserved, and then hurried forward to gaze with the rest.  Even the man at the tiller left his post for a moment to get a better view of the land.  On returning, he found Master Trench occupying his place, and Paul Burns standing beside him with a handspike in his grasp.  Oliver had also armed himself with a marlinespike in default of a better weapon.  \"Go for'ard, my man,\" said the skipper, in a quiet voice, \"an' tell your mates to get ready the anchor and stand by the cable.  Haste ye, if you value life.\"  The man slunk away without a word.  \"We seem far from land yet, Master Trench; why such haste?\" asked Paul.  \"Look over the stern,\" was the skipper's curt reply.  Paul and Oliver both did so, and saw that another squall was bearing down on them.  \"Is it Newfoundland?\" asked Paul.  \"Ay, and an ugly coast to make in a squall.  Hallo! there--if ye would not be food for fishes lay aloft and take in all sail!\"  The skipper, as his wont was, gave the order in a stern tone of command, and resigned the tiller to Grummidge, who came aft at the moment.  The men saw with surprise that a heavy squall was bearing down on them from the eastward.  Mutiny flew, as it were, out at the hawseholes, while discipline re-entered by the cabin windows.  Even Big Swinton was cowed for the moment.  It may be that the peculiar way in which Paul Burns eyed him and toyed with the handspike had some effect on him.  Possibly he was keenly alive to the danger which threatened them.  At all events, he went to work like the rest!  And there was occasion for haste.  Before the sails were properly secured, the squall struck them; the foremast was snapped off close to the deck; for a time the ship became unmanageable and drifted rapidly towards the land.  \"Is that a small island that I see on the weather bow, Olly?\" said the skipper to his son.  \"Look, your eyes are better than mine.\"  \"Yes, father.  It looks like a small one.\"  \"Steer for that, Grummidge.  We'll take shelter in its lee.\"  The sails were braced, and the direction of the vessel was changed, while the wreck of the foremast was being cleared away; but, just as they were drawing near to the island, the wind chopped round, and the hoped-for shelter they were approaching became suddenly a lee shore.  \"Nothing can save us now,\" muttered Grummidge, \"the _Water Wagtail_ is going to her doom.\"  \"You're right, my man.  Before another hour goes by, she will have wagged her tail for the last time,\" said Master Trench, somewhat bitterly.  They were both right.  In less than an hour after that the ship was hurled upon the outlying rocks of a low island.  Shaken and strained as she had been during her disastrous voyage, it took but a short time to break her up, but the bow had been thrust high between two rocks and remained fast.  Circumstances do not change character, but they often bring it to the front.  Heroes and poltroons may remain unknown until a sudden incident or change of condition reveals them.  As the crew of the wrecked ship clustered on the fragment of the bow, and gazed on the tumultuous flood of foaming water that seethed between them and the shore, their hearts failed them for fear.  Some sternly compressed their lips, and looked like men who had made up their minds to \"die game.\"  A few even looked defiant, as if daring Fate to do her worst, though the pallor of their countenances gave the lie to the expression of their features; but many of them, in the terror of the moment, cried aloud for mercy, and wildly promised amendment if their lives should be spared.  A few were composed and grave.  Brave men, though bad.  Possibly some of these prayed.  If so, they had the sense to do it silently to Him who knows the secrets of all hearts.  \"No man can cross that and live,\" said the skipper, in a low, sad tone.  \"It is my intention to try, Master Trench,\" said Paul Burns, grasping the end of a light line and tying it round his waist.  Little Oliver looked quickly and anxiously at his friend.  His heart sank, for he saw at a glance that it was not possible to follow him. The deed, if done at all, must be done by his friend alone.  Great, therefore, was the rebound of joy in the boy's heart when Paul said--  \"Now, Olly, attend to me.  My life, under God, may depend on close attention to my signals and the management of the line.  I can trust your father and the men to haul me back to the ship if need be, but I will trust only you to pay out and read my signals.  Observe, now, let there be no _slack_ to the line; keep it just taut but without any pull on it, so that you may _feel_ the signals at once.  One pull means _pay out faster_, two pulls mean _haul me aboard_, three pulls is _all right and fix the big hawser to the line so that I may haul it ashore_.  Now, Olly, I trust to you to read my signals and act promptly.\"  Oliver's heart was too full to speak.  He looked at his friend with swimming eyes and nodded his head.  \"Men,\" said Paul to the crew, \"let me beg you to obey the boy's orders smartly.  If God wills it so, we shall all be saved.\"  He leaped over the side as he concluded.  Another moment and he was seen to rise and buffet the plunging waters manfully.  Great as was the muscular strength of the young man, it seemed absolute feebleness to those who looked on; nevertheless he made headway towards the shore, which was strewn with great boulders with a low cliff behind them.  It was among these boulders that his chief danger and difficulty lay, for his strong frame would have been as nothing if dashed against them.  Quickly he was lost to view in the hurly-burly of foam and spray.  With the utmost care did Oliver Trench perform his duty.  It required both vigour of hand and delicacy of touch to keep the line right, but it was manipulated by hands whose vigour and touch were intensified by love.  \"Ease off!\" he cried, looking back impatiently at the strong fellows who held the slack of the line.  The men obeyed so readily that the line ran out too fast and the boy had much ado to check it.  Just as he got it sufficiently taut, he felt what seemed to him like _two_ pulls--\"haul me in!\"  Could it be?  He was not certain.  In an agony of anxiety he held on, and was about to give the signal to haul in, when his father, who watched his every movement, instantly said, \"Give him another second or two, Olly.\"  Just then there was a strong single pull at the line.  \"Pay out!--faster!\" shouted Oliver, and, at the "]]]
