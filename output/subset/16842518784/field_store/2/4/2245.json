I was unnerved for the moment at the importance of my discovery.  \"When I looked again, after the few moments my eye took to become accustomed to the new form of light, the scene showed itself as before, except that the girl had gone.  \"For over a week, each night at the same time I watched that cave. The girl came always, and sat by the pool as I had first seen her. Once she danced with the wild grace of a wood nymph, whirling in and out the shadows, and falling at last in a little heap beside the pool.  \"It was on the tenth night after I had first seen her that the accident happened. I had been watching, I remember, an unusually long time before she appeared, gliding out of the shadows. She seemed in a different mood, pensive and sad, as she bent down over the pool, staring into it intently. Suddenly there was a tremendous cracking sound, sharp as an explosion, and I was thrown backward upon the floor.  \"When I recovered consciousness--I must have struck my head on something--I found the microscope in ruins. Upon examination I saw that its larger lens had exploded--flown into fragments scattered around the room. Why I was not killed I do not understand. The ring I picked up from the floor; it was unharmed and unchanged.  \"Can I make you understand how I felt at this loss? Because of the war in Europe I knew I could never replace my lens--for many years, at any rate. And then, gentlemen, came the most terrible feeling of all; I knew at last that the scientific achievement I had made and lost counted for little with me. It was the girl. I realized then that the only being I ever could care for was living out her life with her world, and, indeed, her whole universe, in an atom of that ring.\"  The Chemist stopped talking and looked from one to the other of the tense faces of his companions.  \"It's almost too big an idea to grasp,\" murmured the Doctor.  \"What caused the explosion?\" asked the Very Young Man.  \"I do not know.\" The Chemist addressed his reply to the Doctor, as the most understanding of the group. \"I can appreciate, though, that through that lens I was magnifying tremendously those peculiar light-radiations that I have described. I believe the molecules of the lens were shattered by them--I had exposed it longer to them that evening than any of the others.\"  The Doctor nodded his comprehension of this theory.  Impressed in spite of himself, the Banker took another drink and leaned forward in his chair. \"Then you really think that there is a girl now inside the gold of that ring?\" he asked.  \"He didn't say that necessarily,\" interrupted the Big Business Man.  \"Yes, he did.\"  \"As a matter of fact, I do believe that to be the case,\" said the Chemist earnestly. \"I believe that every particle of matter in our universe contains within it an equally complex and complete a universe, which to its inhabitants seems as large as ours. I think, also that the whole realm of our interplanetary space, our solar system and all the remote stars of the heavens are contained within the atom of some other universe as gigantic to us as we are to the universe in that ring.\"  \"Gosh!\" said the Very Young Man.  \"It doesn't make one feel very important in the scheme of things, does it?\" remarked the Big Business Man dryly.  The Chemist smiled. \"The existence of no individual, no nation, no world, nor any one universe is of the least importance.\"  \"Then it would be possible,\" said the Doctor, \"for this gigantic universe that contains us in one of its atoms, to be itself contained within the atom of another universe, still more gigantic, and so on.\"  \"That is my theory,\" said the Chemist.  \"And in each of the atoms of the rocks of that cave there may be other worlds proportionately minute?\"  \"I can see no reason to doubt it.\"  \"Well, there is no proof, anyway,\" said the Banker. \"We might as well believe it.\"  \"I intend to get proof,\" said the Chemist.  \"Do you believe all these innumerable universes, both larger and smaller than ours, are inhabited?\" asked the Doctor.  \"I should think probably most of them are. The existence of life, I believe, is as fundamental as the existence of matter without life.\"  \"How do you suppose that girl got in there?\" asked the Very Young Man, coming out of a brown study.  \"What puzzled me,\" resumed the Chemist, ignoring the question, \"is why the girl should so resemble our own race. I have thought about it a good deal, and I have reached the conclusion that the inhabitants of any universe in the next smaller or larger plane to ours probably resemble us fairly closely. That ring, you see, is in the same--shall we say--environment as ourselves. The same forces control it that control us. Now, if the ring had been created on Mars, for instance, I believe that the universes within its atoms would be inhabited by beings like the Martians--if Mars has any inhabitants. Of course, in planes beyond those next to ours, either smaller or larger, changes would probably occur, becoming greater as you go in or out from our own universe.\"  \"Good Lord! It makes one dizzy to think of it,\" said the Big Business Man.  \"I wish I knew how that girl got in there,\" sighed the Very Young Man, looking at the ring.  \"She probably didn't,\" retorted the Doctor. \"Very likely she was created there, the same as you were here.\"  \"I think that is probably so,\" said the Chemist. \"And yet, sometimes I am not at all sure. She was very human.\" The Very Young Man looked at him sympathetically.  \"How are you going to prove your theories?\" asked the Banker, in his most irritatingly practical way.  The Chemist picked up the ring and put it on his finger. \"Gentlemen,\" he said. \"I have tried to tell you facts, not theories. What I saw through that ultramicroscope was not an unproven theory, but a fact. My theories you have brought out by your questions.\"  \"You are quite right,\" said the Doctor; \"but you did mention yourself that you hoped to provide proof.\"  The Chemist hesitated a moment, then made his decision. \"I will tell you the rest,\" he said.  \"After the destruction of the microscope, I was quite at a loss how to proceed. I thought about the problem for many weeks. Finally I decided to work along another altogether different line--a theory about which I am surprised you have not already questioned me.\"  He paused, but no one spoke.  \"I am hardly ready with proof to-night,\" he resumed after a moment. \"Will you all take dinner with me here at the club one week from to-night?\" He read affirmation in the glance of each.  \"Good. That's settled,\" he said, rising. \"At seven, then.\"  \"But what was the theory you expected us to question you about?\" asked the Very Young Man.  The Chemist leaned on the back of his chair.  \"The only solution I could see to the problem,\" he said slowly, \"was to find some way of making myself sufficiently small to be able to enter that other universe. I have found such a way and one week from to-night, gentlemen, with your assistance, I am going to enter the surface of that ring at the point where it is scratched!\"     CHAPTER II  INTO THE RING   The cigars were lighted and dinner over before the Doctor broached the subject uppermost in the minds of every member of the party.  \"A toast, gentlemen,\" he said, raising his glass. \"To the greatest research chemist in the world. May he be successful in his adventure to-night.\"  The Chemist bowed his acknowledgment.  \"You have not heard me yet,\" he said smiling.  \"But we want to,\" said the Very Young Man impulsively.  \"And you shall.\" He settled himself more comfortably in his chair. \"Gentlemen, I am going to tell you, first, as simply as possible, just what I have done in the past two years. You must draw your own conclusions from the evidence I give you.  \"You will remember that I told you last week of my dilemma after the destruction of the microscope. Its loss and the impossibility of replacing it, led me into still bolder plans than merely the visual examination of this minute world. I reasoned, as I have told you, that because of its physical proximity, its similar environment, so to speak, this outer world should be capable of supporting life identical with our own.  \"By no process of reasoning can I find adequate refutation of this theory. Then, again, I had the evidence of my own eyes to prove that a being I could not tell from one of my own kind was living there. That this girl, other than in size, differs radically from those of our race, I cannot believe.  \"I saw then but one obstacle standing between me and this other world--the discrepancy of size. The distance separating our world from this other is infinitely great or infinitely small, according to the viewpoint. In my present size it is only a few feet from here to the ring on that plate. But to an inhabitant of that other world, we are as remote as the faintest stars of the heavens, diminished a thousand times.\"  He paused a moment, signing the waiter to leave the room.  \"This reduction of bodily size, great as it is, involves no deeper principle than does a light contraction of tissue, except that it must be carried further. The problem, then, was to find a chemical, sufficiently unharmful to life, that would so act upon the body cells as to cause a reduction in bulk, without changing their shape. I had to secure a uniform and also a proportionate rate of contraction of each cell, in order not to have the body shape altered.  \"After a comparatively small amount of research work, I encountered an apparently insurmountable obstacle. As you know, gentlemen, our living human bodies are held together by the power of the central intelligence we call the mind. Every instant during your lifetime your subconscious mind is commanding and directing the individual life of each cell that makes up your body. At death this power is withdrawn; each cell is thrown under its own individual command, and dissolution of the body takes place.  \"I found, therefore, that I could not "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21094"],["title","The Girl in the Golden Atom (#2)"],["body","upon the cells separately, so long as they were under control of the mind. On the other hand, I could not withdraw this power of the subconscious mind without causing death.  \"I progressed no further than this for several months. Then came the solution. I reasoned that after death the body does not immediately disintegrate; far more time elapses than I expected to need for the cell-contraction. I devoted my time, then to finding a chemical that would temporarily withhold, during the period of cell-contraction, the power of the subconscious mind, just as the power of the conscious mind is withheld by hypnotism.  \"I am not going to weary you by trying to lead you through the maze of chemical experiments into which I plunged. Only one of you,\" he indicated the Doctor, \"has the technical basis of knowledge to follow me. No one had been before me along the path I traversed. I pursued the method of pure theoretical deduction, drawing my conclusions from the practical results obtained.  \"I worked on rabbits almost exclusively. After a few weeks I succeeded in completely suspending animation in one of them for several hours. There was no life apparently existing during that period. It was not a trance or coma, but the complete simulation of death. No harmful results followed the revivifying of the animal. The contraction of the cells was far more difficult to accomplish; I finished my last experiment less than six months ago.\"  \"Then you really have been able to make an animal infinitely small?\" asked the Big Business Man.  The Chemist smiled. \"I sent four rabbits into the unknown last week,\" he said.  \"What did they look like going?\" asked the Very Young Man. The Chemist signed him to be patient.  \"The quantity of diminution to be obtained bothered me considerably. Exactly how small that other universe is, I had no means of knowing, except by the computations I made of the magnifying power of my lens. These figures, I know, must necessarily be very inaccurate. Then, again, I have no means of judging by the visual rate of diminution of these rabbits, whether this contraction is at a uniform rate or accelerated. Nor can I tell how long it is prolonged, for the quantity of drug administered, as only a fraction of the diminution has taken place when the animal passes beyond the range of any microscope I now possess.  \"These questions were overshadowed, however, by a far more serious problem that encompassed them all.  \"As I was planning to project myself into this unknown universe and to reach the exact size proportionate to it, I soon realized such a result could not be obtained were I in an unconscious state. Only by successive doses of the drug, or its retardent about which I will tell you later, could I hope to reach the proper size. Another necessity is that I place myself on the exact spot on that ring where I wish to enter and to climb down among its atoms when I have become sufficiently small to do so. Obviously, this would be impossible to one not possessing all his faculties and physical strength.\"  \"And did you solve that problem, too?\" asked the Banker.  \"I'd like to see it done,\" he added, reading his answer in the other's confident smile.  The Chemist produced two small paper packages from his wallet. \"These drugs are the result of my research,\" he said. \"One of them causes contraction, and the other expansion, by an exact reversal of the process. Taken together, they produce no effect, and a lesser amount of one retards the action of the other.\" He opened the papers, showing two small vials. \"I have made them as you see, in the form of tiny pills, each containing a minute quantity of the drug. It is by taking them successively in unequal amounts that I expect to reach the desired size.\"  \"There's one point that you do not mention,\" said the Doctor. \"Those vials and their contents will have to change size as you do. How are you going to manage that?\"  \"By experimentation I have found,\" answered the Chemist, \"that any object held in close physical contact with the living body being contracted is contracted itself at an equal rate. I believe that my clothes will be affected also. These vials I will carry strapped under my armpits.\"  \"Suppose you should die, or be killed, would the contraction cease?\" asked the Doctor.  \"Yes, almost immediately,\" replied the Chemist. \"Apparently, though I am acting through the subconscious mind while its power is held in abeyance, when this power is permanently withdrawn by death, the drug no longer affects the individual cells. The contraction or expansion ceases almost at once.\"  The Chemist cleared a space before him on the table. \"In a well-managed club like this,\" he said, \"there should be no flies, but I see several around. Do you suppose we can catch one of them?\"  \"I can,\" said the Very Young Man, and forthwith he did.  The Chemist moistened a lump of sugar and laid it on the table before him. Then, selecting one of the smallest of the pills, he ground it to powder with the back of a spoon and sprinkled this powder on the sugar.  \"Will you give me the fly, please?\"  The Very Young Man gingerly did so. The Chemist held the insect by its wings over the sugar. \"Will someone lend me one of his shoes?\"  The Very Young Man hastily slipped off a dancing pump.  \"Thank you,\" said the Chemist, placing it on the table with a quizzical smile.  The rest of the company rose from their chairs and gathered around, watching with interested faces what was about to happen.  \"I hope he is hungry,\" remarked the Chemist, and placed the fly gently down on the sugar, still holding it by the wings. The insect, after a moment, ate a little.  Silence fell upon the group as each watched intently. For a few moments nothing happened. Then, almost imperceptibly at first, the fly became larger. In another minute it was the size of a large horse-fly, struggling to release its wings from the Chemist's grasp. A minute more and it was the size of a beetle. No one spoke. The Banker moistened his lips, drained his glass hurriedly and moved slightly farther away. Still the insect grew; now it was the size of a small chicken, the multiple lens of its eyes presenting a most terrifying aspect, while its ferocious droning reverberated through the room. Then suddenly the Chemist threw it upon the table, covered it with a napkin, and beat it violently with the slipper. When all movement had ceased he tossed its quivering body into a corner of the room.  \"Good God!\" ejaculated the Banker, as the white-faced men stared at each other. The quiet voice of the Chemist brought them back to themselves. \"That, gentlemen, you must understand, was only a fraction of the very first stage of growth. As you may have noticed, it was constantly accelerated. This acceleration attains a speed of possibly fifty thousand times that you observed. Beyond that, it is my theory, the change is at a uniform rate.\" He looked at the body of the fly, lying inert on the floor. \"You can appreciate now, gentlemen, the importance of having this growth cease after death.\"  \"Good Lord, I should say so!\" murmured the Big Business Man, mopping his forehead. The Chemist took the lump of sugar and threw it into the open fire.  \"Gosh!\" said the Very Young Man, \"suppose when we were not looking, another fly had----\"  \"Shut up!\" growled the Banker.  \"Not so skeptical now, eh, George?\" said the Big Business Man.  \"Can you catch me another fly?\" asked the Chemist. The Very Young Man hastened to do so. \"The second demonstration, gentlemen,\" said the Chemist, \"is less spectacular, but far more pertinent than the one you have just witnessed.\" He took the fly by the wings, and prepared another lump of sugar, sprinkling a crushed pill from the other vial upon it.  \"When he is small enough I am going to try to put him on the ring, if he will stay still,\" said the Chemist.  The Doctor pulled the plate containing the ring forward until it was directly under the light, and every one crowded closer to watch; already the fly was almost too small to be held. The Chemist tried to set it on the ring, but could not; so with his other hand he brushed it lightly into the plate, where it lay, a tiny black speck against the gleaming whiteness of the china.  \"Watch it carefully, gentlemen,\" he said, as they bent closer.  \"It's gone,\" said the Big Business Man.  \"No, I can still see it,\" said the Doctor. Then he raised the plate closer to his face. \"Now it's gone,\" he said.  The Chemist sat down in his chair. \"It's probably still there, only too small for you to see. In a few minutes, if it took a sufficient amount of the drug, it will be small enough to fall between the molecules of the plate.\"  \"Do you suppose it will find another inhabited universe down there?\" asked the Very Young Man.  \"Who knows,\" smiled the Chemist. \"Very possibly it will. But the one we are interested in is here,\" he added, touching the ring.  \"Is it your intention to take this stuff yourself to-night?\" asked the Big Business Man.  \"If you will give me your help, I think so, yes. I have made all arrangements. The club has given us this room in absolute privacy for forty-eight hours. Your meals will be served here when you want them, and I am going to ask you, gentlemen, to take turns watching and guarding the ring during that time. Will you do it?\"  \"I should say we would,\" cried the Doctor, and the others nodded assent.  \"It is because I wanted you to be convinced of my entire sincerity that I have taken you so thoroughly into my confidence. Are those doors locked?\" The Very Young Man locked them.  \"Thank you,\" said the Chemist, starting to disrobe. In a moment he stood before them attired in a woolen bathing-suit of pure white. Over his shoulders was strapped tightly a narrow leather harness, supporting two silken pockets, one under each armpit. Into each of these he placed one of the vials, first laying four pills from one of them upon the table.  At this point the Banker rose from his chair"]]]
