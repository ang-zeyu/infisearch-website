Meanwhile the mate, who was accustomed to his captain's habits, and needed no instructions, had caused the sailors to lay their shields and swords out of sight at their feet, so that they might approach the pirates in the character of simple traders who were completely cowed by the appearance of the foe.  To increase this aspect of fear, the sail was lowered as they drew near, and the oars were used to complete the distance that yet intervened between the two vessels.  This humble and submissive approach did not, however, throw the pirates quite off their guard.  They stood to their arms and prepared to spring on board their victim when close enough.  As the pirate vessel lay motionless on the water she presented her broadside to the trader.  The captain took care to steer so that this relative position should be maintained.  The pirate chief, a huge man in rude armour, with a breast-plate of thick bull-hide and a shield of the same on his left arm, gave orders to pull the oars on one side of his vessel so that the two might be brought alongside.  They were about fifty yards apart at the moment.  Before the order could be carried into effect, however, Arkal uttered a low hiss.  Instantly the double banks of oars bent almost to the breaking point, and the _Penelope_ leaped forward like a sentient creature.  Each man seized sword and shield and sprang up, and Bladud, forgetting both helmet and shield in the hurry of the moment, poised the mighty javelin which had so astonished its owner's enemies in days gone by, and in another moment hurled it shrieking through the air.  It flew straight as a thunderbolt at the pirate chief; pierced through shield and breastplate, and came out at his back, sending him headlong into the arms of his horrified crew.  The whole incident was so sudden that the pirates had scarcely time to recover from their surprise when the bow of the _Penelope_ crashed into the side of their vessel and stove it in, for the trader, like some of the war-vessels of the period, was provided with a ram for this very purpose.  As the _Penelope_ recoiled from the shock, a yell of rage burst from the pirates, and a volley of javelins and stones followed, but, owing to the confusion resulting from the shock, these were ill-directed, and such of them as found their mark were caught on the shields.  Before another discharge could be made, the pirate vessel heeled over and sank, leaving her crew of miscreants struggling in the sea.  Some of them--being, strange to say, unable to swim--were drowned.  Others were killed in the water, while a few, taking their swords in their teeth, swam to the trader and made desperate attempts to climb on board.  Of course they failed, and in a few minutes nothing remained of the pirate vessel to tell of the tragedy that had been enacted, except an oar or two and a few spars left floating on the sea.  \"Would that all the sea-robbers in these parts could be as easily and thoroughly disposed of,\" remarked the captain, as he gave orders to re-hoist the sail.  \"Ho!  Bladud, my worthy prince, come aft here.  What detains you?\"  But Bladud did not answer to the call.  A stone from the enemy had fallen on his defenceless head and knocked him down insensible.  Four of the men now raised him up.  As they did so, one of the men--the small seaman, Maikar--was found underneath him in a state of semi-consciousness.  While they carried Bladud aft, the little sailor began to gasp and sneeze.  \"Not killed, I see,\" remarked the mate, looking into his face with some anxiety.  \"No, not quite,\" sighed Maikar, drawing a long breath, and raising himself on one elbow, with a slightly dazed look, \"but I never was so nearly burst in all my life.  If an ox had fallen on me he could not have squeezed me flatter.  Do, two of you, squeeze me the other way, to open me out a little; there's no room in me left to breathe--scarcely room to think.\"  \"Oh! your battles are not yet over, I see,\" said the mate, going off to the stern of the vessel, where he found Bladud just recovering consciousness and smiling at the remarks of the captain, who busied himself in stanching the wound, just over his frontal bone, from which blood was flowing freely.  \"H'm! this comes of sheer recklessness.  I told you to take off your helmet, but I did not tell you to keep it off.  Man, you launched that javelin well!--better than I could have done it myself.  Indeed, I doubt if my old grandfather could have done it with such telling effect-- straight through and through.  I saw full a hand-breadth come out at the villain's back.  What say you, mate?  Little Maikar wounded?\"  \"No, not wounded, but nearly burst, as he says himself; and no wonder, for Bladud fell upon him.\"  \"Didn't I tell you, mate,\" said the captain, looking up with a grin, \"that nothing will kill little Maikar?  Go to, man, you pretend to be a judge of men; yet you grumbled at me for engaging him as one of our crew.  Do you feel better now, prince?\"  \"Ay, greatly better, thank you,\" replied Bladud, putting his hand gently on the bandages with which the captain had skilfully bound his head.  \"That is well.  I think, now, that food will do you service.  What say you?\"  \"Nay, with your leave, I prefer sleep,\" said the prince, stretching himself out on the deck.  \"A little rest will suffice, for my head is noted for its thickness, and my brain for its solidity--at least so my good father was wont to say; and I've always had great respect for his opinion.\"  \"Ah, save when it ran counter to your own,\" suggested Arkal; \"and especially that time when you ran away from home and came out here in the long ship of my trading friend.\"  \"I have regretted that many a time since then, and I am now returning home to offer submission.\"  \"D'you think that he'll forgive you?\"  \"I am sure he will, for he is a kind man; and I know he loves me, though he has never said so.\"  \"I should like to know that father of yours.  I like your description of him--so stern of face, yet so kind of heart, and with such an unchangeable will when he sees what is right.  But what _is_ right, and what is wrong?\"  \"Ay--what is--who can tell?  Some people believe that the gods make their will known to man through the Delphic Oracle.\"  \"Boh!\" exclaimed the captain with a look of supreme contempt.  The turn of thought silenced both speakers for a time; and when Captain Arkal turned to resume the conversation, he found that his friend was sound asleep.  CHAPTER THREE.  ON THE VOYAGE.  Weather has always been, and, we suppose, always will be, capricious. Its uncertainty of character--in the Levant, as in the Atlantic, in days of old as now, was always the same--smiling to-day; frowning to-morrow; playful as a lamb one day; raging like a lion the next.  After the rough handling experienced by the _Penelope_ at the beginning of her voyage, rude Boreas kindly retired, and spicy breezes from Africa rippled the sea with just sufficient force to intensify its heavenly blue, and fill out the great square-sail so that there was no occasion to ply the oars.  One dark, starlight but moonless night, a time of quiet talk prevailed from stem to stern of the vessel as the grizzled mariners spun long yarns of their prowess and experiences on the deep, for the benefit of awe-stricken and youthful shipmates whose careers were only commencing.  \"You've heard, no doubt, of the great sea-serpent?\" observed little Maikar, who had speedily recovered from the flattening to which Bladud had subjected him, and was busy enlivening a knot of young fellows in the bow of the ship.  \"Of course we have!\" cried one; \"father used to tell me about it when I was but a small boy.  He never saw it himself, though he had been to the Tin Isles and Albion more than once; but he said he had met with men who had spoken with shipmates who had heard of it from men who had seen it only a few days before, and who described it exactly.\"  \"Ah!\" remarked another, \"but I have met a man who had seen it himself on his first voyage, when he was quite a youth; and he said it had a bull's head and horns, with a dreadful long body all over scales, and something like an ass's tail at the end.\"  \"Pooh!--nonsense!\" exclaimed little Maikar, twirling his thumbs, for smoking had not been introduced into the world at that period--and thumb-twirling would seem to have served the ancient world for leisurely pastime quite as well, if not better--at least we are led to infer so from the fact that Herodotus makes no mention of anything like a vague, mysterious sensation of unsatisfied desire to fill the mouth with smoke in those early ages, which he would certainly have done had the taste for smoke been a natural craving, and thumb-twirling an unsatisfactory occupation.  This absolute silence of the \"Father of History,\" we think, almost proves our point.  \"Nonsense!\" repeated little Maikar.  \"The youth of the man who told you about the serpent accounts for his wild description, for youth is prone to strange imaginings and--\"  \"It seems to me,\" interrupted a grave man, who twirled his thumbs in that slow, deliberate way in which a contemplative man smokes--\"it seems to me that there's no more truth about the great sea-serpent than there is about the golden fleece.  I don't believe in either of them.\"  \"Don't you?  Well, all I can say is,\" returned the little man, gazing fixedly in the grave comrade's face, \"that I saw the great sea-serpent with my own eyes!\"  \"No! did you?\" exclaimed the group, drawing their heads closer together with looks of expectancy.  \"Ay, that did I, mates; but you mustn't expect wild descriptions about monsters with bulls' horns and asses' tails from me.  I like truth, and the truth is, that the brute was so far away at the time we saw it, that not a man of us could tell exactly what it was like, and when we tried the description, we were"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21758"],["title","Hudson Bay (#1)"],["body","in my dormitory, soon enlightened me on that point.  We were going rapidly down the Thames with a fair breeze, and had actually set sail for the distant shores of Hudson Bay.  What took place during the next five or six days I know not.  The demon of sea-sickness had completely prostrated my faculties, bodily and mental.  Some faint recollections I have of stormy weather, horrible noises, and hurried dinners; but the greater part of that period is a miserable blank in my memory.  Towards the sixth day, however, the savoury flavour of a splendid salmon-trout floated past my dried-up nostrils like \"Afric's spicy gale,\" and caused my collapsed stomach to yearn with strong emotion.  The ship, too, was going more quietly through the water; and a broad stream of sunshine shot through the small window of my berth, penetrated my breast, and went down into the centre of my heart, filling it with a calm, complacent pleasure quite indescribable.  Sounds, however, of an attack upon the trout roused me, and with a mighty effort I tumbled out of bed, donned my clothes, and seated myself for the first time at the cabin table.  Our party consisted of the captain; Mr Carles, a chief factor in the Company's service; the doctor; young Mr Wiseacre, afore-mentioned; the first and second mates; and myself.  The captain was a thin, middle-sized, offhand man; thoroughly acquainted with his profession; good-humoured and gruff by turns; and he always spoke with the air of an oracle.  Mr Carles was a mild, good-natured man, of about fifty-five, with a smooth, bald head, encircled by a growth of long, thin hair.  He was stoutly built, and possessed of that truly amiable and captivating disposition which enters earnestly and kindly into the affairs of others, and totally repudiates self.  From early manhood he had roughed life in the very roughest and wildest scenes of the wilderness, and was now returning to those scenes after a short visit to his native land. The doctor was a nondescript; a compound of gravity, fun, seriousness, and humbug--the latter predominating.  He had been everywhere (at least, so he said), had seen everything, knew everybody, and played the fiddle. It cannot be said, I fear, that he played it well; but, amid the various vicissitudes of his chequered life, the doctor had frequently found himself in company where his violin was almost idolised and himself deified; especially when the place chanced to be the American backwoods, where violins are scarce, the auditors semi-barbarous Highlanders, and the music Scotch reels.  Mr Wiseacre was nothing!  He never spoke except when compelled to do so; never read, and never cared for anything or anybody; wore very long hair, which almost hid his face, owing to a habit which he had of holding his head always down: and apparently lived but to eat, drink, and sleep.  Sometimes, though very rarely, he became so far facetious as to indulge in a wink and a low giggle; but beyond this he seldom soared.  The two mates were simply _mates_.  Those who know the population of the sea will understand the description sufficiently; those who don't, will never, I fear, be made to understand by description.  They worked the ship, hove the log, changed the watch, turned out and tumbled in, with the callous indifference and stern regularity of clock work; inhabited tarpaulin dreadnoughts and sou'-westers; came down to meals with modest diffidence, and walked the deck with bantam-cock-like assurance. Nevertheless, they were warm-hearted fellows, both of them, although the heat didn't often come to the surface.  The first mate was a _broad_ Scotchman, in every sense of the term; the second was a burly little Englishman.  \"How's the wind, Collins?\" said the captain, as the second mate sat down at the dinner-table, and brushed the spray from his face with the back of his brown hand.  \"Changed a point to the s'uthard o' sou'-west, sir,\" he answered, \"and looks as if it would blow hard.\"  \"Humph!\" ejaculated the captain, while he proceeded to help the fish. \"I hope it'll only keep quiet till we get into blue water, and then it may blow like blazes for all I care,--Take some trout, doctor?  It's the last you'll put your teeth through for six weeks to come, _I_ know; so make the most of it.--I wish I were only through the Pentland Firth, and scudding under full sail for the ice--I do.\"  And the captain looked fiercely at the compass which hung over his head, as if he had said something worthy of being recorded in history, and began to eat.  After a pause of five minutes or so--during which time the knives and forks had been clattering pretty vigorously, and the trout had become a miserable skeleton--the captain resumed his discourse.  \"I tell you what it is now, gentlemen; if there's not going to be a change of some sort or other, I'm no sailor.\"  \"It does look very threatening,\" said Mr Carles, peering through the stern window.  \"I don't much like the look of these clouds behind us. Look there, doctor!\" he continued, pointing towards the window.  \"What do you think of that?\"  \"Nothing!\" replied the doctor, through a mouthful of duff and potatoes. \"A squall, I fancy; wish it'd only wait till after dinner.\"  \"It never does,\" said the captain.  \"I've been to sea these fifteen years, and I always find that squalls come on at breakfast or dinner, like an unwelcome visitor.  They've got a thorough contempt for tea-- seem to know it's but swipes, and not worth pitching into one's lap; but dinner's sure to bring 'em on, if they're in the neighbourhood, and make 'em bu'st their cheeks at you.  Remember once, when I was cruising in the Mediterranean, in Lord P---'s yacht, we'd been stewing on deck under an awning the whole forenoon, scarce able to breathe, when the bell rang for dinner.  Well, down we all tumbled--about ten ladies and fifteen gentlemen, or thereabouts--and seated ourselves round the table.  There was no end of grub of every kind.  Lord P--- was eccentric in that way, and was always at some new dodge or other in the way of cookery.  At this time he had invented a new dumpling.  Its jacket was much the same as usual--inch-thick duff; but its contents were beyond anything I ever saw, except the maw of an old shark.  Well, just as the steward took off the cover, _hiss-iss_ went the wind overhead, and one of those horrible squalls that come rattling down without a moment's warning in those parts, struck the ship, and gave her a heel over that sent the salt-cellars chasing the tumblers like all-possessed; and the great dumpling gave a heavy lurch to leeward, rolled fairly over on its beam-ends, and began to course straight down the table quite sedate and quiet-like.  Several dives were made at it by the gentlemen as it passed, but they all missed; and finally, just as a youngster made a grab at it with both hands that bid fair to be successful, another howl of the squall changed its course, and sent it like a cannon-shot straight into the face of the steward, where it split its sides, and scattered its contents right and left.  I don't know how it ended, for I bolted up the companion, and saw the squall splitting away to leeward, shrieking as it went, just as if it were rejoicing at the mischief it had done.\"  The laugh which greeted the captain's anecdote had scarce subsided when the tough sides of the good _Prince Rupert_ gave a gentle creak, and the angle at which the active steward perambulated the cabin became absurdly acute.  Just then the doctor cast his eye up at the compass suspended above the captain's head.  \"Hallo!\" said he--But before he could give utterance to the sentiments to which \"hallo\" was the preface, the hoarse voice of the first mate came rolling down the companion-hatch,--\"A squall, sir! scoorin' doon like mad!  Wund's veered richt roond to the nor'-east.\"  The captain and second mate sprang hastily to their feet and rushed upon deck, where the rest of us joined them as speedily as possible.  On gaining the quarter-deck, the scene that presented itself was truly grand.  Thick black clouds rolled heavily overhead, and cast a gloom upon the sea which caused it to look like ink.  Not a breath of wind swelled the sails, which the men were actively engaged in taking in. Far away on our weather-quarter the clouds were thicker and darker; and just where they met the sea there was seen a bright streak of white, which rapidly grew broader and brighter, until we could perceive that it was the sea lashed into a seething foam by the gale which was sweeping over it.  \"Mind your helm!\" shouted the captain.  \"Ay, ay, sir!\" sang out the man at the wheel.  And in another moment the squall burst upon us with all its fury, laying the huge vessel over on its side as if it had been a feather on the wave, and causing her to fly through the black water like a dolphin.  In a few minutes the first violence of the squall passed away, and was succeeded by a steady breeze, which bore us merrily along over the swelling billows.  \"A stiff one, that,\" said the captain, turning to the doctor, who, with imperturbable nonchalance, was standing near him, holding on to a stanchion with one hand, while the other reposed in his breeches pocket.  \"I hope it will last,\" replied the doctor.  \"If it does, we'll not be long of reaching the blue water you long so much for.\"  Young Wiseacre, who during the squall had been clutching the weather-shrouds with the tenacity of a drowning man, opened his eyes very wide on hearing this, to him, insane wish, and said to me in an undertone, \"I say, do you think the doctor is quite right in his mind?\"  \"I have no doubt of it,\" replied I.  \"Why do you ask?\"  \"Because I heard him say to the captain he wished that this would last.\"  \"Is that all?\" said I, while a very vile spirit of vanity took possession of me, inducing me to speak in a tone which indicated a tranquillity of mind that I certainly did not enjoy.  \"Oh, this is nothing at all!  I see you've never been on salt"]]]
