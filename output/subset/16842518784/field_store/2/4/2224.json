All the wild riotous singing, all the brave flashing of wings and tail, all the mad dashing in and out among the thickets or soaring upward above the tree-tops, are impelled by the perfectly natural instinct of mating and rearing young.  And where, pray, dwells the soul so poor that it does not thrill in response to the appeals of the ardent lover, even if it be a bird, or feel sympathy upon beholding expressions of parental love and solicitude.  Most people, therefore, are interested in such spring bird life as comes to their notice, the extent of this interest depending {4} in part on their opportunity for observation, but more especially, perhaps, on their individual taste and liking for things out of doors.  It would seem safe to assume that there is hardly any one who does not know by sight at least a few birds.  Nearly every one in the eastern United States and Canada knows the Robin, Crow, and English Sparrow; in the South most people are acquainted with the Mockingbird and Turkey Buzzard; in California the House Finch is abundant about the towns and cities; and to the dwellers in the Prairie States the Meadowlark is very familiar.  Taking such knowledge, however slight, as a basis, there is no reason why any one, if he so desires, should not, with a little effort, get on neighbourly terms with a large number of birds of the region, and spring is a most favourable time to begin such an effort.  One may learn more about a bird's habits by closely observing its movements for a few hours at this season than by watching it for a month later on. The life that centres about the nest is most {5} absorbing.  Few sights are more stimulating to interest in outdoor life than spying on a pair of wild birds engaged in nest building.  Nest hunting, therefore, soon becomes a part of the bird student's occupation, and I heartily recommend such a course to beginners, _provided_ great care is exercised not to injure the nests and their contents.  _Caution in Nest Hunting._--A thoughtful person will, of course, be careful in approaching a wild bird's nest, otherwise much mischief may be done in a very short time.  I have known \"dainty eggs\" and \"darling baby-birds\" to be literally visited to death by well-meaning people, with the best of intentions.  The parents become discouraged by constantly recurring alarms and desert the nest, or a cat will follow the path made through the weeds and leave nothing in the nest worth observing.  Even the bending of limbs, or the pushing aside of leaves, will produce a change in the surroundings, which, however slight, may be sufficient to draw the attention of some feathered enemy.  {6}  When one stumbles on the nest of a Quail, Meadowlark, or Oven-bird, it is well not to approach it closely, because all over the country many night-prowling animals have the habit of following by scent the footsteps of any one who has lately gone along through the woods or across the fields.  One afternoon by the rarest chance I found three Quails' nests containing eggs.  The next morning I took out a friend to share the pleasure of my discoveries.  We found every nest destroyed and the eggs eaten.  My trail the evening before lay through cultivated fields, and it was thus easy for us to find in the soft ground the tracks of the fox or small dog that, during the night, had followed the trail with calamitous results to the birds.  When finding the nests I had made the mistake of going to within a few inches of them.  Had I stopped six feet away the despoiler that followed probably never would have known there was a nest near, for unless a dog approaches within a very few feet of a _brooding_ Quail it seems not to possess the power of smelling it.  [Illustration: The Fox that Followed the Footsteps]  {7}  _Going Afield._--It is rarely necessary to go far afield to begin the study of birds.  Often one may get good views of birds from one's open window, as many species build their nests close to the house when the surroundings are favourable.  Last spring {8} I counted eighteen kinds of birds one morning while sitting on the veranda of a friend's house, and later found the nests of no less than seven of them within sight of the house.  When one starts out to hunt birds it is well to bear in mind a few simple rules.  The first of these is to go quietly.  One's good sense would of course tell him not to rush headlong through the woods, talking loudly to a companion, stepping upon brittle twigs, and crashing through the underbrush.  Go quietly, stopping to listen every few steps.  Make no violent motions, as such actions often frighten a bird more than a noise.  Do not wear brightly coloured clothing, but garments of neutral tones which blend well with the surroundings of field and wood.  It is a good idea to sit silently for a time on some log or stump, and soon the birds will come about you, for they seldom notice a person who is motionless.  A great aid to field study is a good _Field Glass_.  A glass enables one to see the colours of small birds hopping about the shrubbery, or moving through the branches of trees.  With its {9} aid one may learn much of their movements, and even observe the kind of food they consume.  A very serviceable glass may be secured at a price varying from five to ten dollars.  The National Association of Audubon Societies, New York City, sells a popular one for five dollars.  If you choose a more expensive, high-powered binocular, it will be found of greater advantage when watching birds at a distance, as on a lake or at the seashore.  _Notebooks._--The bird student should early acquire the custom of making notes on such subjects as are of special interest.  In listening to the song or call of some unknown bird, the notes can usually be written down in characters of human speech so that they may be recalled later with sufficient accuracy to identify the singer.  It is well to keep a list of the species observed when on a trip.  For many years in my field excursions I have kept careful lists of the birds seen and identified, and have found these notes to be of subsequent use and pleasure.  In college and summer-school work I {10} have always insisted on pupils cultivating the notebook habit, and results have well justified this course.  In making notes on a bird that you do not know it is well to state the size by comparing it with some bird you know, as, for example, \"smaller than an English Sparrow,\" \"about the size of a Robin,\" and so on.  Try to determine the true colours of the birds and record these.  Also note the shape and approximate length of the bill.  This, for example, may be short and conical like a Canary's, awl-shaped like the bill of a Warbler, or very long and slender like that of a Snipe.  By failing to observe these simple rules the learner may be in despair when he tries to find out the name of his strange bird by examining a bird book, or may cause some kindly friend an equal amount of annoyance.  [Illustration: Heads and feet of various birds]  As a further aid to subsequent identification it is well to record the place where the bird was seen, for example: \"hopping up the side of a tree,\" \"wading in a marsh,\" \"circling about in the air,\" or \"feeding {12} on dandelions.\"  Such secondary information, while often a valuable aid to identification, would in itself hardly be sufficient to enable an ornithologist to render the service desired.  That a young correspondent of mine entertained a contrary view was evident from a letter I received a few weeks ago from an inexperienced boy enthusiast, who was a member of a newly formed nature-study class. Here is the exact wording of the communication: \"Dear Sir: 10 A. M. Wind East.  Cloudy.  Small bird seen on ground in orchard.  Please name.  _P. S._ All the leaves have fallen.\"  _Reporting Blanks._--A convenient booklet of reporting blanks and directions for using them is issued by the National Association of Audubon Societies, New York City.  This is very useful in recording descriptions of birds.  (See sample, page 13.)  The blanks may be sent to the office of the National Association and the species described will be named.  [Illustration: Sample page of reporting-blank]  Bird Books.--There are a number of inexpensive {14} books which contain illustrations of birds in natural colours.  One of these will be of the greatest aid to the beginner in bird study.  Among the most useful are the Reed's, \"Bird Guides,\" one covering the birds of the eastern and the other those of the western part of the United States.  The pictures alone will be of great use in learning the names of feathered neighbours, while an intelligent study of the text will reveal the identity of many others.  Local lists of such birds as are found in a neighbourhood, or a county, are always a great aid in determining, with a fair degree of accuracy, just what species may or may not be expected to appear in a given"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21007"],["title","The Bird Study Book (#2)"],["body","y.  Such lists are usually first published in _The Auk_, _The Condor_, or other ornithological publications, and in many cases are printed and distributed later as separate pamphlets.  There have been published also many State lists of birds, usually accompanied by detailed information regarding abundance and distribution of all the species known to occur in the State.   Every bird {15} student should, if possible, get a copy of his own State bird book.  Any reader who may wish to learn if such a list of the birds of his neighbourhood or State has been published is at liberty to address the question to the author of this book.  _Movements of Birds._--One does not get very far in the work of bird study without discovering that certain movements are characteristic of various families; and when the observer is able to recognize this difference in manner a long step has been taken in acquiring the power of identifying species.  After watching for a time the actions of a Downy Woodpecker as it clings to the side of a tree, or hops along its bark, one is quick to recognize the Woodpecker _manner_ when some other species of that family is encountered.  Recalling the ceaseless activities of a Yellow Warbler the observer feels, without quite knowing why, that he has discovered another Warbler of some kind when a Redstart or Chestnut-sided Warbler appears.  Once identify a Barn Swallow coursing through the air, and a long {16} stride is made toward the identification of the Cliff or Tree Swallow when one swings into view. The flight of the Flicker, the Goldfinch, the Nighthawk, and the Sparrow Hawk, is so characteristic in each case that I have often been able to name the bird for a student upon being told its approximate size and the character of its flight.  Who can see a Wild Duck swimming, or a Gull flying, without at once referring it to the group of birds to which it belongs?  Thus the first step is taken toward learning the names of the species, and the grouping of them into families.  _Artificial Cover in Hiding._--When studying the larger or the shyer species it is sometimes well to hide one's self from view with whatever articles are at hand that resemble the natural surroundings.  This may be done by covering with hay if in a field, or by holding some leafy branches about you if in the woods.  On a lonely island in Pamlico Sound I once got some fishermen to cover me with sand and sea-shells, and in that way managed to get a close view of {17} the large flocks of Cormorants that came there to roost every night.  The island was small and perfectly barren, and any other method of attempted concealment would have failed utterly.  Another time, while crouched among some boulders watching for a flock of Gambel's Quails to come to a water-hole in the Santa Catalina Mountains of Arizona, a Canyon Wren alighted on my back, for I was covered with an old tent fly so spotted with mildew that it closely resembled the neighbouring rocks.  A moment later it flew to a point scarcely more than a foot from my face, when, after one terrified look, it departed.  [Illustration: A ferocious young eagle]  _The Umbrella Blind._--A device now often used by ornithologists is the umbrella blind, which is easy to construct.  Take a stout umbrella, remove the handle, and insert the end in a hollow brass rod five feet long.  Sharpen the rod at the other end and thrust it into the ground. Over the raised umbrella throw a dark green cloth cut and sewed so as to make a curtain that will reach the ground all round.  A {19} draw-string will make it fit over the top.  Get inside, cut a few vertical observation slits six inches long, and your work is done. Erect this within ten feet of a nest, and leave it alone for a few hours.  The birds will quickly get accustomed to it so that later you may go inside and watch at close range without disturbing them in the least.  This blind is often used for close bird photography.  I have taken pictures of Herring Gulls at a distance of only six feet with the aid of such a blind.  If you wish to use it on a windy day it may be stayed by a few guy-lines from the top and sides.  [Illustration: The Umbrella Blind]  The foregoing instructions include all the necessary aids to a beginner in bird study who desires to start afield properly equipped.  To summarize them, all that is really necessary is a field glass, a notebook for memoranda, inconspicuous clothing, and a desire to listen and learn.  In the next chapter we shall discuss some of the things to be learned in the study of the life about the nest.  {20}  _NOTE.--The following publications will be found of great aid to the student in identifying wild birds:_  _\"Handbook of Birds of Eastern North America,\" by Frank M. Chapman, published by D. Appleton Or Company, price $3.65, postpaid._  _\"Handbook of Birds of Western United States,\" by Florence Merriam Bailey, published by Houghton, Mifflin Company, price $3.68, postpaid._  _\"Water and Game Birds: Birds of Prey\" and \"Land Birds East of the Rockies: From Parrots to Blue Birds,\" by Chester A. Reed, published by Doubleday, Page & Company, price of each in sock cloth, $1.10, postpaid; inflexible leather, $1.35, postpaid._  _Educational Leaflets, published by the National Association of Audubon Societies, New York City, a series of nearly one hundred, price 2 cents each._     {21}  CHAPTER II  THE LIFE ABOUT THE NEST  In view of the fact that birds display much activity about their nests there is a great advantage in studying the nesting bird.  Once locate an occupied nest, and by quietly watching for a time, your field glass and bird guide will usually enable you to learn the owner's name.  If you do not know where any nest is to be found go out and hunt for one. This in itself will be an exciting sport, although it should be pursued with good judgment.  Children unattended should not be permitted to hunt nests in spring.  A very excellent way to find one is to keep a sharp watch upon birds at the time when they are engaged in nest building.  _Nest Hunting._--By noticing every bird suspected of being interested in domestic affairs, you are pretty {22} sure to see one before long with grass, twigs, rootlets, or something of the kind in its bill.  Now watch closely, for you are in a fair way to discover a nest.  The bird may not go directly to the spot.  If it suspects it is being watched it may hop from twig to twig and from bush to bush for many minutes before revealing its secret, and if it becomes very apprehensive it may even drop its burden and begin a search for insects with the air of one who had never even dreamed of building a nest.  Even when unsuspicious it will not always go directly to the nest.  From an outhouse I once watched a Blue Jay, with a twig, change its perch more than thirty times before going to the fork where its nest was being built.  Sometimes a bird may be induced to reveal its secret by placing in its sight tempting nesting material.  By this means Mrs. Pearson last summer found a Redstart's nest.  Discovering a female industriously hopping about near the camp, and suspecting what it was seeking, she dropped some ravellings of a white cotton string from the veranda railing, letting {23} them fall where the bird could see them.  These proved most acceptable, and the Redstart immediately appropriated them, one at a time, with the result that she soon betrayed her nest.  Early morning is the best time of the day to find birds working at their nests, for then they are most active.  Perhaps a reason for this is that the broken twigs, leaves, and dead grasses, wet with the dews of night, are more pliable, and consequently more easily woven into place.  For nesting sites birds as a rule prefer the open country.   Rolling meadowlands, with orchards, thickets, and occasional streams, are ideal places for birds in spring.  _Number and Colour of Eggs._--The full complement of eggs laid by a bird is known as a set or clutch.  The number varies greatly with different species.  The Leach's Petrel, Murre, and some other sea birds, have but one egg.  The Turkey Vulture, Mourning Dove, Hummingbird, Whip-poor-will, and Nighthawk lay two.  Various Thrushes, such as the {24} Robin, Veery, and Wood Thrush, deposit from three to five, four being the most usual number.  Wild Ducks, Turkeys, and Grouse range from eight to a dozen or more; while Quails sometimes lay as many as eighteen.  Eggs are variously coloured, and some are so marked that the blending of their colours with those of their surroundings renders them inconspicuous.  Thus those of the Killdeer, Sandpiper, and Nighthawk, for example, are not easily distinguished from the ground on which they lie.  Many eggs that are laid in holes or other dark places are white without markings of any kind, as illustrated by those of the Chimney Swift, Belted Kingfisher, and all Woodpeckers.  In such instances Nature shows no disposition to be lavish with her colouring matter where it is not needed.  _Behaviour When Nest Is Discovered._--After the young are hatched it is even easier to find nests by watching the parents.  The nestlings are hungry at all hours, and the old ones are visiting the nest at frequent intervals throughout the day.  Birds {25} behave very differently when their nests are discovered.  A Cuckoo will glide away instantly and will make no effort to dispute your possession of her treasures.  A Crow will also fly off, and so will a Wild Duck and some others.  On the other hand, the Mockingbird, Robin, or Shrike, will raise a great outcry and bring about her half the birds of the neighbourhood to pour out on you their vials of wrath, unless you have the good judgment to retire at once to a respectful distance.  Warblers will flit from bush to bush uttering cries of distress and showing their uneasiness.  The Mourning Dove, Nighthawk, and many others will feign lameness and seek to lead you away in a vain pursuit.  A still larger number"]]]
