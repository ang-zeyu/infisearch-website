And since she saw him before he saw her, he had no chance to hide. He was sorry; for he _just knew_--from the look in her eye--that she was going to ask him a question. And sure enough, she did!  \"You're a harvestman,\" she began, quite out of breath from hurrying. \"Why don't you go to work?\"  \"What can I do?\" Daddy inquired with a blank look.  \"Do!\" she exclaimed. \"I should think Farmer Green would be glad to have your help in harvesting his crops. He's mowing his oats now. And there's no one to help him except the hired man--unless you count Johnnie, and _he_ spends most of his time at the swimming-hole.\"  Daddy Longlegs thanked Mrs. Ladybug politely for her suggestion. But he said that he was not acquainted with Farmer Green. And he disliked working for strangers. And he thought he would spend the rest of the summer making friends with his neighbors.  \"Next year,\" he told her, \"I may make some arrangement with Farmer Green to work for him regularly.\"  But that answer did not satisfy little Mrs. Ladybug in the least.  \"You'd be far better off with something steady to do,\" she insisted. And she said so much that just to get rid of her Daddy Longlegs promised to see Farmer Green at once and offer his services.  He was sorry, as soon as she had gone, that he had agreed to do that. But being a person of his word he never once thought of not keeping his promise, though he wished he had simply put his hand behind his ear and not answered Mrs. Ladybug's question at all.  But it was too late, then, to do that.     VII  TRYING TO HELP   IT was true that Farmer Green had almost more work than he could do just then, even with the aid of the hired man and Johnnie. And he often wished that he might find somebody else to help him.  \"I'd hire anybody I could find that had two legs,\" he remarked to his wife as he started away from the house after finishing his dinner. \"I want to get the oats harvested before there's a rain. And I don't like the looks of the sky to-day.\"  Now, Daddy Longlegs reached the farmhouse just in time to hear what Farmer Green said. And he spoke up at once--as loudly as he could.  \"I'd be willing to work for you,\" he said. \"I'm a harvestman. And you ought to be glad to hire me, for I have eight legs instead of only two.\"  Perhaps Daddy's voice was too thin and high for Farmer Green to hear. Anyhow, he paid not the slightest heed to Daddy's offer, but strode off across the farmyard while his caller cried \"Stop! Please stop!\" at the top of his lungs.  Then Daddy heard a noise, which he was sure was thunder--though it was only Farmer Green calling to the hired man to hurry.  \"Well, I've tried to go to work, anyhow,\" Daddy Longlegs assured himself. \"And if the oats get wet Farmer Green can't blame me.\"  He went back to the stone wall then. And seeing Mr. Chippy perched on the wild grapevine, Daddy told him what had happened. \"Farmer Green must be deaf at times, the same as you are,\" little Mr. Chippy observed. \"If I were you I'd write him a letter.\"  Daddy Longlegs pretended not to hear Mr. Chippy's suggestion. The truth was, being only a few months old Daddy did not know how to write. But of course he did not care to have Mr. Chippy know that.  Well, while he pondered upon the situation Daddy Longlegs changed his mind about working for Farmer Green. In the beginning he had not wanted to help with the harvesting. He had taken up Mrs. Ladybug's suggestion only to keep her quiet. But now, having found that going to work for Farmer Green was no easy matter to arrange, Daddy Longlegs began to long to do the very thing he had wished to avoid.  At last he decided that he would go over to the oat field at once and do what he could to help with the harvesting--without saying anything more to anybody.  \"Farmer Green can't help but be pleased,\" he thought, as he started off across the farmyard in the same direction in which Johnnie Green's father had gone when he called to the hired man to hurry.  Daddy had not gone far before he met Buster Bumblebee. \"How far is it to the oat field?\" Daddy asked him.  \"Oh! It's not ten minutes' journey,\" said Buster. \"I've just come from the clover-patch myself; and that's twice as far.\"  Daddy Longlegs thanked him. And then he turned and tottered on again. For a long time he walked as fast as he could. It seemed to him that he must have been travelling at least half an hour. But he saw not the slightest sign of the oat field, though he climbed a fence and peered across the rolling meadow.  Then he happened to catch sight of Chirpy Cricket hopping through the grass. And Daddy called to him and asked him how far it was to the oat field.  \"It's a good half-day's journey from here,\" said Chirpy Cricket cheerfully. But Daddy Longlegs did not feel the least bit cheerful when he heard that.  \"For the land's sake!\" he exclaimed. \"Are you sure you're not mistaken? Buster Bumblebee told me a long time ago that it was only a ten-minute trip.\"  \"Ah! So it is--for him!\" said Chirpy Cricket. \"You must remember that he flies very fast. But I have to hop along much more slowly. And as for you, at the pace you were travelling before you stopped to speak to me you wouldn't reach the oat field before to-morrow morning! No--not even if you walked all night!\"     VIII  IN NEED OF NEW SHOES   DADDY LONGLEGS couldn't help feeling discouraged when Chirpy Cricket told him that he wouldn't be able to reach the oat field before the next morning.  \"I declare,\" he said, \"if I had known it was such a long journey I wouldn't have tried to go there to help Farmer Green with his harvesting. I've already walked so far that my shoes are all worn out. And I can neither go on nor go back until I get some new ones.\" He looked very doleful--for he didn't know what to do. But Chirpy Cricket laughed merrily--as was his custom.  \"Cheer up!\" he cried. \"You're in luck! Jimmy Rabbit has a shoe shop in this very meadow. Just follow me and I'll show you where it is!\"  So off they went. And soon they arrived at the shoe shop, in front of which they found Jimmy Rabbit all smiles and bows.  \"Here's a friend of mine who needs some new shoes,\" Chirpy Cricket announced.  \"Come right in!\" cried Jimmy Rabbit. \"Any friend of Chirpy Cricket's is a friend of mine too. And if I can't fit your feet with shoes it won't be my fault. Only yesterday I sold a pair of shoes to old Mr. Crow. And his feet are enormous, as every one knows.\"  \"Well, I want more than just _one_ pair,\" Daddy Longlegs piped up. \"I want four--making eight shoes in all. And I flatter myself that my feet are very small,\" he added.  Jimmy Rabbit looked a bit surprised at that remark. He was not accustomed to seeing eight-legged people in his shop. But he made no comment, though he couldn't help staring at his new customer.  Meanwhile Chirpy Cricket had hopped away, after telling Daddy that he was leaving him in good hands. And then Jimmy Rabbit went to work briskly. He began setting shoes of all sorts and sizes before Daddy Longlegs. And soon he was not only placing them in front of Daddy, but on both sides of him--and behind him as well.  Jimmy Rabbit was so spry, and most of the shoes were so big, that in no time at all Daddy Longlegs was completely surrounded by a wall of shoes, which rapidly grew higher and higher.  \"Stop! stop!\" cried Daddy Longlegs. But Jimmy Rabbit was so busy that he didn't hear him. And he kept piling more and more shoes around his tiny visitor, until Daddy Longlegs was lost in a small mountain of big, little, and medium-sized shoes of many different colors.  Not till then did Jimmy Rabbit pause for breath. And when he saw that his customer had disappeared he was more than surprised.  \"Where can he have gone?\" Jimmy exclaimed. \"I didn't see him go out. He was sitting right here only a moment ago. And now he's certainly not in my shop.\"  Even at that very moment Daddy Longlegs was frantically crying \"Help! help!\" But his thin, weak voice was quite muffled by the great heap of shoes that buried him.  After waiting for a few minutes Jimmy Rabbit closed--and locked--his door, and went skipping off to Farmer Green's garden, where the cabbages grew.     IX  LOCKED IN!   POOR Daddy Longlegs! Buried as he was under dozens of shoes--all of them many times bigger than he was--he couldn't help being alarmed when he heard Jimmy Rabbit walk out of the shoe shop and lock the door behind him.  Daddy wished that he had told Mrs. Ladybug in the beginning that he wouldn't help Farmer Green with his harvesting. Then he would never have started on his long journey to the oat field and worn out his shoes. And if he hadn't worn out his shoes, of course he would never have visited Jimmy Rabbit's shoe shop and got himself into such terrible trouble.  He soon saw that he might call for help until his voice was cracked worse than ever without its doing him the least bit of good. So he stopped shouting and began to climb out of the pile of shoes that surrounded him. And he was very glad, then, that he had eight long legs to help him. But when he found himself free of the shoes he seemed but little better off than before. There he was, a prisoner in the shoe shop! And the daylight was fast fading.  If Daddy Longlegs had been half as wise as his neighbors believed him he wouldn't have stayed in his prison two minutes. But after trying the door and the two windows and finding that he couldn't open them he made up his mind that there was nothing for him to do except to wait until Jimmy Rabbit came back the following day.  And there was the chimney all the time! Daddy Longlegs could have crawled up it just as easily as Santa Claus could have crept down it! But because he had never left anybody's house or shop by way of the chimney, Daddy Longlegs never once thought of doing such a thing.  And his thinking that Jimmy Rabbit wouldn't come back until the next morning shows that Daddy"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21427"],["title","Comic History of the United States (#1)"],["body","rdue. We owe the hired girl for three weeks; and how are we going to get funds enough to do any discovering, when you remember that we have got to pay for an extra session this fall for the purpose of making money plenty?\"  [Illustration: COLUMBUS AT COURT.]  But Isabella came and sat by him in her winning way, and with the moistened corner of her handkerchief removed a spot of maple syrup from the ermine trimming of his reigning gown. She patted his hand, and, with her gentle voice, cheered him and told him that if he would economize and go without cigars or wine, in less than two hundred years he would have saved enough to fit Columbus out.  A few weeks later he had saved one hundred and fifty dollars in this way. The queen then went at twilight and pawned a large breastpin, and, although her chest was very sensitive to cold, she went without it all the following winter, in order that Columbus might discover America before immigration set in here.  Too much cannot be said of the heroism of Queen Isabella and the courage of her convictions. A man would have said, under such circumstances, that there would be no sense in discovering a place that was not popular. Why discover a place when it is so far out of the way? Why discover a country with no improvements? Why discover a country that is so far from the railroad? Why discover, at great expense, an entirely new country?  But Isabella did not stop to listen to these croaks. In the language of the Honorable Jeremiah M. Rusk, \"She seen her duty and she done it.\" That was Isabella's style.  Columbus now began to select steamer-chairs and rugs. He had already secured the Niña, Pinta, and Santa Maria, and on the 3d of August, 1492, he sailed from Palos.  Isabella brought him a large bunch of beautiful flowers as he was about to sail, and Ferdinand gave him a nice yachting-cap and a spicy French novel to read on the road.  He was given a commission as viceroy or governor of all the lands he might discover, with hunting and shooting privileges on same.  [Illustration: COLUMBUS'S STEAMER-CHAIR.]  He stopped several weeks at the Canary Islands, where he and his one hundred and twenty men rested and got fresh water. He then set out sailing due west over an unknown sea to blaze the way for liberty.  Soon, however, his men began to murmur. They began also to pick on Columbus and occupy his steamer-chair when he wanted to use it himself. They got to making chalk-marks on the deck and compelling him to pay a shilling before he could cross them. Some claimed that they were lost and that they had been sailing around for over a week in a circle, one man stating that he recognized a spot in the sea that they had passed eight times already.  Finally they mutinied, and started to throw the great navigator overboard, but he told them that if they would wait until the next morning he would tell them a highly amusing story that he heard just before he left Palos.  Thus his life was saved, for early in the morning the cry of \"Land ho!\" was heard, and America was discovered.  A saloon was at once started, and the first step thus taken towards the foundation of a republic. From that one little timid saloon, with its family entrance, has sprung the magnificent and majestic machine which, lubricated with spoils and driven by wind, gives to every American to-day the right to live under a Government selected for him by men who make that their business.  Columbus discovered America several times after the 12th of October, 1492, and finally, while prowling about looking for more islands, discovered South America near the mouth of the Orinoco.  He was succeeded as governor by Francisco de Bobadilla, who sent him back finally in chains. Thus we see that the great are not always happy. There is no doubt that millions of people every year avoid many discomforts by remaining in obscurity.  [Illustration: COLUMBUS HAVING TROUBLE WITH HIS SAILORS.]  The life of Columbus has been written by hundreds of men, both in this country and abroad, but the foregoing facts are distilled from this great biographical mass by skilful hands, and, like the succeeding pages, will stand for centuries unshaken by the bombardment of the critic, while succeeding years shall try them with frost and thaw, and the tide of time dash high against their massive front, only to recede, quelled and defeated.[1]   [Footnote 1: The author acknowledges especially the courtesy of San Diego Colon Columbus, a son of the great navigator, whose book \"Historiadores Primitivos\" was so generously loaned the author by relatives of young Columbus.  I have refrained from announcing in the foregoing chapter the death of Columbus, which occurred May 20, 1506, at Valladolid, the funeral taking place from his late residence, because I dislike to give needless pain.                                                                B. N.]     [Illustration:]  CHAPTER II.  OTHER DISCOVERIES--WET AND DRY.   America had many other discoverers besides Columbus, but he seems to have made more satisfactory arrangements with the historians than any of the others. He had genius, and was also a married man. He was a good after-dinner speaker, and was first to use the egg trick, which so many after-dinner speakers have since wished they had thought of before Chris did.  In falsifying the log-book in order to make his sailors believe that they had not sailed so far as they had, Columbus did a wrong act, unworthy of his high notions regarding the pious discovery of this land. The artist has shown here not only one of the most faithful portraits of Columbus and his crooked log-book, but the punishment which he should have received.  The man on the left is Columbus; History is concealed just around the corner in a loose wrapper.  Spain at this time regarded the new land as a vast jewelry store in charge of simple children of the forest who did not know the value of their rich agricultural lands or gold-ribbed farms. Spain, therefore, expected to exchange bone collar-buttons with the children of the forest for opals as large as lima beans, and to trade fiery liquids to them for large gold bricks.  The Montezumas were compelled every little while to pay a freight-bill for the Spanish confidence man.  Ponce de Leon had started out in search of the Hot Springs of Arkansas, and in 1512 came in sight of Florida. He was not successful in his attempt to find the Fountain of Youth, and returned an old man so deaf that in the language of the Hoosier poet referring to his grandfather,--    \"So remarkably deaf was my grandfather Squeers   That he had to wear lightning-rods over his ears   To even hear thunder, and oftentimes then   He was forced to request it to thunder again.\"  Balboa crossed the Isthmus of Darien, and, rolling up his pantalettes, waded into the Pacific Ocean and discovered it in the name of Spain. It was one of the largest and wettest discoveries ever made, and, though this occurred over three centuries ago, Spain is still poor.  Balboa, in discovering the Pacific, did so according to the Spanish custom of discovery, viz., by wading into it with his naked sword in one hand and the banner of Castile, sometimes called Castile's hope (see Appendix), in the other. He and his followers waded out so as to discover all they could, and were surprised to discover what is now called the undertow.  [Illustration: BALBOA DRYING HIS CLOTHES.]  The artist has shown the great discoverer most truthfully as he appeared after he had discovered and filed on the ocean. No one can look upon this picture for a moment and confuse Balboa, the discoverer of the Pacific, with Kope Elias, who first discovered in the mountains of North Carolina what is now known as moonshine whiskey.  De Narvaez in 1528 undertook to conquer Florida with three hundred hands. He also pulled considerable grass in his search for gold. Finally he got to the gulf and was wrecked. They were all related mostly to Narvaez, and for two weeks they lived on their relatives, but later struck shore--four of them--and lived more on a vegetable diet after that till they struck the Pacific Ocean, which now belonged to Spain.  De Soto also undertook the conquest of Florida after this, and took six hundred men with him for the purpose. They wandered through the Gulf States to the Mississippi, enduring much, and often forced to occupy the same room at night. De Soto in 1541 discovered the Mississippi River, thus adding to the moisture collection of Spain.  After trying to mortgage his discovery to Eastern capitalists, he died, and was buried in the quiet bosom of the Great Father of waters.  Thus once more the list of fatalities was added to and the hunger for gold was made to contribute a discovery.  Menendez later on founded in 1565 the colony of St. Augustine, the oldest town in the United States. There are other towns that look older, but it is on account of dissipation. New York looks older, but it is because she always sat up later of nights than St. Augustine did.  Cortez was one of the coarsest men who visited this country. He did not marry any wealthy American girls, for there were none, but he did everything else that was wrong, and his unpaid laundry-bills are still found all over the Spanish-speaking countries. He was especially lawless and cruel to the Peruvians: \"recognizing the Peruvian at once by his bark,\" he would treat him with great indignity, instead of using other things which he had with him. Cortez had a way of capturing the most popular man in a city, and then he would call on the tax-payers to redeem him on the instalment plan. Most everybody hated Cortez, and when he held religious services the neighbors did not attend. The religious efforts made by Cortez were not successful. He killed a great many people, but converted but few.  The historian desires at this time to speak briefly of the methods of Cortez from a commercial stand-point.
