A month ago she didn't know of Jill's existence. Now, you know and I know that Jill is one of the best and brightest. As far as we are concerned, everything in the good old garden is lovely. Why, dash it, Jill and I were children together. Sported side by side on the green, and what not. I remember Jill, when she was twelve, turning the garden hose on me and knocking about seventy-five per cent off the market value of my best Sunday suit. That sort of thing forms a bond, you know, and I've always felt that she was a corker. But your mater's got to discover it for herself. It's a dashed pity, by Jove, that Jill hasn't a father or a mother or something of that species to rally round just now. They would form a gang. There's nothing like a gang! But she's only got that old uncle of hers. A rummy bird. Met him?\"  \"Several times. I like him.\"  \"Oh, he's a genial old buck all right. A very bonhomous lad. But you hear some pretty queer stories about him if you get among people who knew him in the old days. Even now I'm not so dashed sure I should care to play cards with him. Young Threepwood was telling me only the other day that the old boy took thirty quid off him at picquet as clean as a whistle. And Jimmy Monroe, who's on the Stock Exchange, says he's frightfully busy these times buying margins or whatever it is chappies do down in the City. Margins. That's the word. Jimmy made me buy some myself on a thing called Amalgamated Dyes. I don't understand the procedure exactly, but Jimmy says it's a sound egg and will do me a bit of good. What was I talking about? Oh, yes, old Selby. There's no doubt he's quite a sportsman. But till you've got Jill well established, you know, I shouldn't enlarge on him too much with the mater.\"  \"On the contrary,\" said Derek, \"I shall mention him at the first opportunity. He knew my father out in India.\"  \"Did he, by Jove! Oh, well, that makes a difference.\"  Barker entered with the toast, and Derek resumed his breakfast.  \"It may be a little bit awkward,\" he said, \"at first, meeting mother. But everything will be all right after five minutes.\"  \"Absolutely! But, oh, boy! that first five minutes!\" Freddie gazed portentously through his eye-glass. Then he seemed to be undergoing some internal struggle, for he gulped once or twice. \"That first five minutes!\" he said, and paused again. A moment's silent self-communion, and he went on with a rush. \"I say, listen. Shall I come along, too?\"  \"Come along?\"  \"To the station. With you.\"  \"What on earth for?\"  \"To see you through the opening stages. Break the ice, and all that sort of thing. Nothing like collecting a gang, you know. Moments when a feller needs a friend and so forth. Say the word, and I'll buzz along and lend my moral support.\"  Derek's heavy eyebrows closed together in an offended frown, and seemed to darken his whole face. This unsolicited offer of assistance hurt his dignity. He showed a touch of the petulance which came now and then when he was annoyed, to suggest that he might not possess so strong a character as his exterior indicated.  \"It's very kind of you,\" he began stiffly.  Freddie nodded. He was acutely conscious of this himself.  \"Some fellows,\" he observed, \"would say 'Not at all!' I suppose. But not the Last of the Rookes! For, honestly, old man, between ourselves, I don't mind admitting that this is the bravest deed of the year, and I'm dashed if I would do it for anyone else.\"  \"It's very good of you, Freddie....\"  \"That's all right. I'm a Boy Scout, and this is my act of kindness for to-day.\"  Derek got up from the table.  \"Of course you mustn't come,\" he said. \"We can't form a sort of debating society to discuss Jill on the platform at Charing Cross.\"  \"Oh, I would just hang around in the offing, shoving in an occasional tactful word.\"  \"Nonsense!\"  \"The wheeze would simply be to....\"  \"It's impossible.\"  \"Oh, very well,\" said Freddie, damped. \"Just as you say, of course. But there's nothing like a gang, old son, nothing like a gang!\"   II  Derek Underhill threw down the stump of his cigar, and grunted irritably. Inside Charing Cross Station business was proceeding as usual. Porters wheeling baggage-trucks moved to and fro like Juggernauts. Belated trains clanked in, glad to get home, while others, less fortunate, crept reluctantly out through the blackness and disappeared into an inferno of detonating fog-signals. For outside the fog still held. The air was cold and raw and tasted coppery. In the street traffic moved at a funeral pace, to the accompaniment of hoarse cries and occasional crashes. Once the sun had worked its way through the murk and had hung in the sky like a great red orange, but now all was darkness and discomfort again, blended with that odd suggestion of mystery and romance which is a London fog's only redeeming quality.  The fog and the waiting had had their effect upon Derek. The resolute front he had exhibited to Freddie at the breakfast-table had melted since his arrival at the station, and he was feeling nervous at the prospect of the meeting that lay before him. Calm as he had appeared to the eye of Freddie and bravely as he had spoken, Derek, in the recesses of his heart, was afraid of his mother. There are men--and Derek Underhill was one of them--who never wholly emerge from the nursery. They may put away childish things and rise in the world to affluence and success, but the hand that rocked their cradle still rules their lives.  Derek turned to begin one more walk along the platform, and stopped in mid-stride, raging. Beaming over the collar of a plaid greatcoat, all helpfulness and devotion, Freddie Rooke was advancing towards him, the friend that sticketh closer than a brother. Like some loving dog, who, ordered home sneaks softly on through alleys and by-ways, peeping round corners and crouching behind lamp-posts, the faithful Freddie had followed him after all. And with him, to add the last touch to Derek's discomfiture, were those two inseparable allies of his, Ronny Devereux and Algy Martyn.  \"Well, old thing,\" said Freddie, patting Derek encouragingly on the shoulder, \"here we are after all! I know you told me not to roll round and so forth, but I knew you didn't mean it. I thought it over after you had left, and decided it would be a rotten trick not to cluster about you in your hour of need. I hope you don't mind Ronny and Algy breezing along too. The fact is, I was in the deuce of a funk--your jolly old mater always rather paralyses my nerve-centres, you know--so I roped them in. Met 'em in Piccadilly, groping about for the club, and conscripted 'em both, they very decently consenting. We all toddled off and had a pick-me-up at that chemist chappie's at the top of the Hay-market, and now we're feeling full of beans and buck, ready for anything. I've explained the whole thing to them, and they're with you to the death! Collect a gang, dear boy, collect a gang! That's the motto. There's nothing like it!\"  \"Nothing!\" said Ronny.  \"Absolutely nothing!\" said Algy.  \"We'll just see you through the opening stages,\" said Freddie, \"and then leg it. We'll keep the conversation general you know.\"  \"Stop it getting into painful channels,\" said Ronny.  \"Steer it clear,\" said Algy, \"of the touchy topic.\"  \"That's the wheeze,\" said Freddie. \"We'll ... Oh, golly! There's the train coming in now!\" His voice quavered, for not even the comforting presence of his two allies could altogether sustain him in this ordeal. But he pulled himself together with a manful effort. \"Stick it, old beans!\" he said doughtily. \"Now is the time for all good men to come to the aid of the party!\"  \"We're here!\" said Ronny Devereux.  \"On the spot!\" said Algy Martyn.   III  The boat-train slid into the station. Bells rang, engines blew off steam, porters shouted, baggage-trucks rattled over the platform. The train began to give up its contents, now in ones and twos, now in a steady stream. Most of the travellers seemed limp and exhausted, and were pale with the pallor that comes of a choppy Channel crossing. Almost the only exception to the general condition of collapse was the eagle-faced lady in the brown ulster, who had taken up her stand in the middle of the platform and was haranguing a subdued little maid in a voice that cut the gloomy air like a steel knife. Like the other travellers, she was pale, but she bore up resolutely. No one could have told from Lady Underhill's demeanour that the solid platform seemed to heave beneath her feet like a deck.  Derek approached, acutely conscious of Freddie, Ronny, and Algy, who were skirmishing about his flank.  \"Well, mother! So there you are at last!\"  \"Well, Derek!\"  Derek kissed his mother. Freddie, Ronny, and Algy shuffled closer, like leopards. Freddie, with the expression of one who leads a forlorn hope, moved his Adam's apple briskly up and down several times, and spoke.  \"How do you do, Lady Underhill?\"  \"How do you do, Mr. Rooke?\"  Lady Underhill bowed stiffly and without pleasure. She was not fond of the Last of the Rookes. She supposed the Almighty had had some wise purpose in creating Freddie, but it had always been inscrutable to her.  \"Like you,\" mumbled Freddie, \"to meet my friends. Lady Underhill. Mr. Devereux.\"  \"Charmed,\" said Ronny affably.  \"Mr. Martyn.\"  \"Delighted,\" said Algy with old-world courtesy.  Lady Underhill regarded this mob-scene with an eye of ice.  \"How do you do?\" she said. \"Have you come to meet somebody?\"  \"I--er--we--er--why--er--\" This woman always made Freddie feel as if he were being disembowelled by some clumsy amateur. He wished that he had defied the dictates of his better nature and remained in his snug rooms at the Albany, allowing Derek to go through this business by himself. \"I--er--we--er--came to meet _you_, don't you know!\"  \"Indeed! That was very kind of you!\"  \"Oh, not at all.\"  \"Thought we'd welcome you back to the old homestead,\" said"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20533"],["title","Jill the Reckless (#2)"],["body","beaming.  \"What could be sweeter?\" said Algy. He produced a cigar-case, and extracted a formidable torpedo-shaped Havana. He was feeling delightfully at his ease, and couldn't understand why Freddie had made such a fuss about meeting this nice old lady. \"Don't mind if I smoke, do you? Air's a bit raw to-day. Gets into the lungs.\"  Derek chafed impotently. These unsought allies were making a difficult situation a thousand times worse. A more acute observer than young Mr. Martyn, he noted the tight lines about his mother's mouth and knew them for the danger-signal they were. Endeavouring to distract her with light conversation, he selected a subject which was a little unfortunate.  \"What sort of crossing did you have, mother?\"  Lady Underhill winced. A current of air had sent the perfume of Algy's cigar playing about her nostrils. She closed her eyes, and her face turned a shade paler. Freddie, observing this, felt quite sorry for the poor old thing. She was a pest and a pot of poison, of course, but all the same, he reflected charitably, it was a shame that she should look so green about the gills. He came to the conclusion that she must be hungry. The thing to do was to take her mind off it till she could be conducted to a restaurant and dumped down in front of a bowl of soup.  \"Bit choppy, I suppose, what?\" he bellowed, in a voice that ran up and down Lady Underhill's nervous system like an electric needle. \"I was afraid you were going to have a pretty rough time of it when I read the forecast in the paper. The good old boat wobbled a bit, eh?\"  Lady Underhill uttered a faint moan. Freddie noticed that she was looking deucedly chippy, even chippier than a moment ago.  \"It's an extraordinary thing about that Channel crossing,\" said Algy Martyn meditatively, as he puffed a refreshing cloud. \"I've known fellows who could travel quite happily everywhere else in the world--round the Horn in sailing-ships and all that sort of thing--yield up their immortal soul crossing the Channel! Absolutely yield up their immortal soul! Don't know why. Rummy, but there it is!\"  \"I'm like that myself,\" assented Ronny Devereux. \"That dashed trip from Calais gets me every time. Bowls me right over. I go aboard, stoked to the eyebrows with sea-sick remedies, swearing that this time I'll fool 'em, but down I go ten minutes after we've started and the next thing I know is somebody saying, 'Well, well! So this is Dover!'\"  \"It's exactly the same with me,\" said Freddie, delighted with the smooth, easy way the conversation was flowing. \"Whether it's the hot, greasy smell of the engines....\"  \"It's not the engines,\" contended Ronny Devereux. \"Stands to reason it can't be. I rather like the smell of engines. This station is reeking with the smell of engine-grease, and I can drink it in and enjoy it.\" He sniffed, luxuriantly. \"It's something else.\"  \"Ronny's right,\" said Algy cordially. \"It isn't the engines. It's the way the boat heaves up and down and up and down and up and down....\" He shifted his cigar to his left hand in order to give with his right a spirited illustration of a Channel steamer going up and down and up and down and up and down. Lady Underhill, who had opened her eyes, had an excellent view of the performance, and closed her eyes again quickly.  \"Be quiet!\" she snapped.  \"I was only saying....\"  \"Be quiet!\"  \"Oh, rather!\"  Lady Underhill wrestled with herself. She was a woman of great will-power and accustomed to triumph over the weaknesses of the flesh. After a while her eyes opened. She had forced herself, against the evidence of her senses, to recognize that this was a platform on which she stood and not a deck.  There was a pause. Algy, damped, was temporarily out of action, and his friends had for the moment nothing to remark.  \"I'm afraid you had a trying journey, mother,\" said Derek. \"The train was very late.\"  \"Now, _train_-sickness,\" said Algy, coming to the surface again, \"is a thing lots of people suffer from. Never could understand it myself.\"  \"I've never had a touch of train-sickness,\" said Ronny.  \"Oh, I have,\" said Freddie. \"I've often felt rotten on a train. I get floating spots in front of my eyes and a sort of heaving sensation, and everything kind of goes black....\"  \"Mr. Rooke!\"  \"Eh?\"  \"I should be greatly obliged if you would keep those confidences for the ear of your medical adviser.\"  \"Freddie,\" intervened Derek hastily, \"my mother's rather tired. Do you think you could be going ahead and getting a taxi?\"  \"My dear old chap, of course! Get you one in a second. Come along, Algy. Pick up the old waukeesis, Ronny.\"  And Freddie, accompanied by his henchmen, ambled off, well pleased with himself. He had, he felt, helped to break the ice for Derek and had seen him safely through those awkward opening stages. Now he could totter off with a light heart and get a bite of lunch.  Lady Underhill's eyes glittered. They were small, keen, black eyes, unlike Derek's, which were large and brown. In their other features the two were obviously mother and son. Each had the same long upper lip, the same thin, firm mouth, the prominent chin which was a family characteristic of the Underhills, and the jutting Underhill nose. Most of the Underhills came into the world looking as though they meant to drive their way through life like a wedge.  \"A little more,\" she said tensely, \"and I should have struck those unspeakable young men with my umbrella. One of the things I have never been able to understand, Derek, is why you should have selected that imbecile Rooke as your closest friend.\"  Derek smiled tolerantly.  \"It was more a case of him selecting _me_. But Freddie is quite a good fellow really. He's a man you've got to know.\"  \"_I_ have not got to know him, and I thank heaven for it!\"  \"He's a very good-natured fellow. It was decent of him to put me up at the Albany while our house was let. By the way, he has some seats for the first night of a new piece this evening. He suggested that we might all dine at the Albany and go on to the theatre.\" He hesitated a moment. \"Jill will be there,\" he said, and felt easier now that her name had at last come into the talk. \"She's longing to meet you.\"  \"Then why didn't she meet me?\"  \"Here, do you mean? At the station? Well, I--I wanted you to see her for the first time in pleasanter surroundings.\"  \"Oh!\" said Lady Underhill shortly.  It is a disturbing thought that we suffer in this world just as much by being prudent and taking precautions as we do by being rash and impulsive and acting as the spirit moves us. If Jill had been permitted by her wary fiancé to come with him to the station to meet his mother it is certain that much trouble would have been avoided. True, Lady Underhill would probably have been rude to her in the opening stages of the interview, but she would not have been alarmed and suspicious; or, rather, the vague suspicion which she had been feeling would not have solidified, as it did now into definite certainty of the worst. All that Derek had effected by his careful diplomacy had been to convince his mother that he considered his bride-elect something to be broken gently to her.  She stopped and faced him.  \"Who is she?\" she demanded. \"Who is this girl?\"  Derek flushed.  \"I thought I made everything clear in my letter.\"  \"You made nothing clear at all.\"  \"By your leave!\" chanted a porter behind them, and a baggage-truck clove them apart.  \"We can't talk in a crowded station,\" said Derek irritably. \"Let me get you to the taxi and take you to the hotel.... What do you want to know about Jill?\"  \"Everything. Where does she come from? Who are her people? I don't know any Mariners.\"  \"I haven't cross-examined her,\" said Derek stiffly. \"But I do know that her parents are dead. Her father was an American.\"  \"American!\"  \"Americans frequently have daughters, I believe.\"  \"There is nothing to be gained by losing your temper,\" said Lady Underhill with steely calm.  \"There is nothing to be gained, as far as I can see, by all this talk,\" retorted Derek. He wondered vexedly why his mother always had this power of making him lose control of himself. He hated to lose control of himself. It upset him, and blurred that vision which he liked to have of himself as a calm, important man superior to ordinary weaknesses. \"Jill and I are engaged, and there is an end to it.\"  \"Don't be a fool,\" said Lady Underhill, and was driven away by another baggage-truck. \"You know perfectly well,\" she resumed, returning to the attack, \"that your marriage is a matter of the greatest concern to me and to the whole of the family.\"  \"Listen, mother!\" Derek's long wait on the draughty platform had generated an irritability which overcame the deep-seated awe of his mother which was the result of years of defeat in battles of the will. \"Let me tell you in a few words all that I know of Jill, and then we'll drop the subject. In the first place, she is a lady. Secondly, she has plenty of money....\"  \"The Underhills do not need to marry for money.\"  \"I am not marrying for money!\"  \"Well, go on.\"  \"I have already described to you in my letter--very inadequately, but I did my best--what she looks like. Her sweetness, her lovableness, all the subtle things about her which go to make her what she is, you will have to judge for yourself.\"  \"I intend to!\"  \"Well, that's all, then. She lives with her uncle, a Major Selby....\"  \"Major Selby? What regiment?\"  \"I didn't ask him,\" snapped the goaded Derek. \"And, in the name of heaven, what does it matter? If you are worrying about Major Selby's social standing, I may as well tell you that he used to know father.\"  \"What! When? Where?\"  \"Years ago. In India, when father was at Simla.\"  \"Selby? Selby? Not Christopher Selby?\"  \"Oh, you remember him?\"  \"I certainly remember him! Not that he and I ever met, but your father often spoke of him.\"  Derek was relieved. It was abominable that this sort of thing should matter, but one had to face facts, and, as far as"]]]
