I was the worst of them all.\"  There was something terrible in the tone and manner in which this was uttered, as if the breast of the speaker were torn with conflicting feelings.  \"She must have met wi' the missionaries some time or other,\" whispered Reuben.  \"Is the old woman the only one of all the tribe left alive?\" asked Swiftarrow.  \"Ay, the only one--no, not the _only_ one; my son is yet alive.  He went to set a bear-trap not _very_ long since; but he should have come back before now.  He will be back soon.\"  The deep sigh which followed proved that the poor old woman was hoping against hope.  \"How long is't since he left you, mother?\" asked Lawrence eagerly.  \"Two suns have risen and set since he left, and he had not far to go.\"  \"Father, I'll go seek for this man,\" said Lawrence; \"something may have befallen him.\"  Reuben made no objection, and the youth set off immediately in a direction which was pointed out by the old woman.  After he was gone his father and the Indian shifted one of the cleanest looking of the empty tents to a considerable distance from the spot where the terrible work of death had been done, and removing the old woman from the neighbourhood of the pestilential atmosphere, placed her therein, kindled a fire and cooked her a little food, of which she evidently stood much in need.  Meanwhile Lawrence sped through the pathless forest with the light step of a strong youth and the precision of a practised hunter.  About four miles from the Indian camp he came upon the track of a bear, the footprints of which proved that it was an unusually large one.  He followed it up closely, and was led by it to a spot where some trees had been cut down, and not far from which he saw what appeared to him to be the remains of a trap.  Almost at the same moment of his making this discovery he heard a growl, and saw the bear itself--a monster of the brown species, which differs from the ordinary black bear of America in being more carnivorous and much larger, as well as more savage and bold. No sooner did it see the youth than it rushed upon him with great fury. A piece of broken line was drawn tight round its neck, and another piece round its fore-leg, while four arrows stuck in its shoulder and side, showing plainly that it had broken loose from a snare and had been attacked by man.  But Lawrence had no time to think on these things.  He had barely time to throw forward and cock his gun when the bear was upon him.  It rose on its hind-legs, and in doing so towered high above the youth, who, whatever his feelings might have been, looked undismayed. With an unflinching eye he took aim at the monster's heart, and shot it dead.  So close was it to him that he singed the hair on its breast and had to leap to one side to avoid being struck as it fell.  Reloading quickly, the young hunter advanced towards the trap, where his worst fears were realised, for near to it he found the body of an Indian torn limb from limb, and mostly eaten, except the head, which remained entire.  It was evident that the poor man, having set several snares for bears, had gone to visit them, and found this brown bear caught by the head and leg.  He seemed to have tried to kill it with arrows, but must have been afraid to go near enough to use his weapons with effect, and the enraged animal, having broken the snare, flew upon him and tore him to pieces.  Brown bears of this kind are very powerful.  One traveller in these regions saw the footprints of a large one, which, having seized a moose-deer in a river, dragged it for a quarter of a mile along the sandy banks, and afterwards devoured it all except part of the hind-quarters; and the moose which had been treated in this unceremonious way, judging from the size and hardness of the bones, must have been upwards of a year old, when it would weigh as much as an ox of the same age.  Collecting the scattered remnants of the unfortunate Indian, who was no other than the old woman's son, Lawrence covered them over with leaves and sticks.  He then skinned the bear and cut off its claws, which he carried away as trophies, along with one or two choice steaks cut from the creature's flank.  He also collected the weapons and part of the dress of the Indian, with which he returned to the camp.  \"Heyday!  Lawrence, what have you got there, lad?\" said Reuben, as his son came up and threw the bundle on the ground.  \"A brown bear, father.\"  \"Well done!\" exclaimed Reuben, with a look of pride, for although his son had shot many a black bear in the forest, he had never before stood face to face with such a monster as that whose skin and claws now lay at his feet.  \"It would have been well, father,\" said Lawrence gravely, \"if the man who first saw this had owned a gun.  His arrows were no better than needles in such a hide.  See here!\"  He drew from his breast the bloody portions of dress which had belonged to the slaughtered Indian.  \"The son of the old woman has gone to the happy hunting-grounds,\" said Swiftarrow, referring to the heaven of the Indian, as he lifted and examined the dress.  \"Ay, ay,\" said Reuben sadly, \"'tis the chances of the wilderness.  You'd better tell the poor old creetur', Swiftarrow; you understand her ways and lingo better than me.\"  Silently the Indian went to the old woman, and laid the bloody garments before her.  At first she did not understand what had happened. Suddenly the truth flashed upon her, and she looked quickly up into the grave countenance of the Indian, but death and sorrow appeared to have already done their worst on her, for she neither spoke nor wept for some time.  She took up the shreds of cloth and turned them over tenderly; but neither sign nor groan escaped her.  Evidently she had been already so stunned by the horrors which had surrounded her for some time, that this additional blow did not tell--at least, not at first--but Reuben observed, while trying to comfort her some time afterwards, that a few tears were coursing slowly down her withered cheeks.  That night, round the camp-fire, the pioneers held earnest counsel, and resolved, sadly but firmly, that their projected journey must be given up for that season.  \"It's a hard thing to do,\" said Reuben, as he lay at full length before the fire after supper, \"to give up our plans after comin' so far; but it ain't possible to carry that old 'ooman along with us an' it's not to be thought of to leave her behind to starve, so there's nothin' for it but to go back an' take her wi' us to the settlements.  I would feel like a murderer if I was to leave one o' God's creeturs to perish in the wilderness.  What think you, Lawrence?\"  \"I think you are right, father,\" replied the youth, with a deep sigh.  \"An' what says Swiftarrow?\"  \"Go back,\" was the Indian's prompt and laconic answer.  \"Well, then, we're all agreed, so we'll turn back on our trail to-morrow; but I shall try again next year if I'm above ground.  I once know'd a Yankee who had what he called a motto, an' it was this, `Never give in, 'xcept w'en yer wrong.'  I think I'll take to that motto.  It seems to me a good 'un.\"  In proof, we presume, of his sincerity, Reuben Guff rolled himself in his blanket, stretched his feet towards the fire, pillowed his head on a bundle of moss, and at once _gave in_ to the seductive influences of sleep; an example which was so irresistible that his companions followed it without delay.    CHAPTER THREE.  INTRODUCES THE KING OF PIONEERS.  Discarding space and ignoring time, we seize you by the hand, reader, and bound away with you still deeper into the northern wilderness, away into that remote region which, at the time we write of, was the _ultima thule_ of the fur-traders of Canada,--beyond which lay the great unknown world, stretching to the pole.  Here, amid the grand scenery of the Rocky Mountains, lies the Athabasca Lake, also styled the Lake of the Hills.  We prefer the latter name, as being more romantic.  This is no pretty pond such as we in England are wont to visit and delight in during our summer holidays.  It is a great sheet of water; a grand fresh-water sea, 200 miles long and 15 miles broad--a fitting gem for the bosom of the mighty region on which it glitters.  A year has fled since the period of our last chapter, and here, in a birch-bark canoe on the waters of the Lake of the Hills, we find our pioneers--Reuben Guff, his son Lawrence, and his Indian friend Swiftarrow.  There is also a young Indian woman in the canoe-- Swiftarrow's wife.  The kind-hearted red man adopted the old woman who had been rescued on their previous trip, but, not finding her a good substitute for his own mother, he bethought him of adding a young squaw to his establishment. While he meditated on this step, the old woman died.  About the same time Reuben Guff made proposals to him to join him on a second \"v'yage of diskivery.\"  The Indian agreed; got married off-hand, and took his bride along with him.  We now find them all four at the Lake of the Hills.  It may be as well to observe, in passing, that Indian brides are usually more robust than those of civilised communities.  They are quite competent to follow their lords on the most arduous canoe voyages, and, besides being able to wield the paddle with great dexterity, are exceedingly useful in managing what may be styled the domestic matters of the camp.  They also keep up a constant supply of the Indian's indispensable foot-gear--moccasins--which are so slender in their nature that a pair may be completely worn-out in a single day of hard hunting.  The brown bride, therefore, was not a hindrance to the party, but a useful member of it, as well as a pleasant companion.  True, her companionship consisted chiefly in answering \"yes\" and \"no\" when spoken to, and in smiling pleasantly at all times; but this was sufficient to satisfy the moderate demands of her male friends "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21692"],["title","The Pirate City: An Algerine Tale (#1)"],["body"," piratical-looking craft to lie over as if she were about to capsize.  The vessel which they were pursuing also bent over to the breeze and crowded all sail; for well did Francisco, its owner and padrone, know, from past experience, that Algerine corsairs were fast sailers, and that his only hope lay in showing them his heels!  He had often given them the slip before--why should he not again?  While thus doing his best to escape, however, the bluff merchant did not neglect to make preparations for defence.  \"Clear away the big gun,\" he said to Mariano, who acted as his first officer, Lucien being the scrivano or supercargo of the vessel; \"'tis a good piece, and has turned the flight of many a pirate with its first bark.\"  The latter part of this remark was addressed to Bacri, who stood, leaning over the taffrail, looking anxiously at the vessel in chase.  \"If it be Sidi Hassan,\" muttered the Jew half aloud, \"there is little chance--\"  \"What say you?\" demanded Francisco.  \"I say that if it be the vessel of a man whom I happen to know, you will have to trust to your sails for deliverance--fighting will be of no avail.\"  Francisco looked at the Jew with some surprise, not unmingled with contempt.  \"A warlike spirit, it seems, does not always consort with a powerful frame,\" he said; \"but how come you to have scraped acquaintance with these pirates, whose existence is a blight upon the commerce of the Mediterranean, and a disgrace to our age?\"  \"None should know better than thyself that a trader, like any other traveller, becomes acquainted with strange bedfellows,\" replied Bacri, with a quiet smile.  \"As to a warlike spirit, of what use would it be in a despised Israelite to display such?\"  \"There is truth in that,\" returned the padrone in a more respectful tone; \"nevertheless, if fighting becomes needful, I trust that one furnished with such thews and sinews will not fail to lend effective aid.\"  \"That he will not, I dare say; and here is a cutlass for him, wherewith to carve a name and fame,\" said Mariano, coming aft at the moment and presenting the weapon to Bacri, who took it with a half-humorous smile, and laid it on the seat beside him.  \"Hast got the big gun ready, boy?\" demanded Francisco.  \"Ay--loaded her almost to the muzzle.  I ordered her to be double-shotted, and that big black rascal Manqua slily crammed in a handful of nails without leave.  I only hope she won't burst.\"  \"Burst!\" exclaimed the padrone, with a laugh; \"if you were to load her even beyond the muzzle she wouldn't burst.  I remember once loading her with a full dose of canister, and clapped two round shot on the top of that, after which the same negro you have mentioned, (for he has a tendency in that way), shoved in a handspike without orders, and let the whole concern fly at a pirate boat, which it blew clean out of the water: she well-nigh burst the drums of our ears on that occasion, but showed no sign whatever of bursting herself.\"  \"Nevertheless,\" said Bacri earnestly, \"I advise you to trust entirely to your sails.\"  \"We haven't another stitch of canvas to set,\" said Francisco in reply; \"and if we had, the old schooner couldn't stand it, for, as you may see, the strain is already as much as she can bear.\"  This was indeed the case, for the vessel was by that time flying before a stiff breeze, with all the sail set that she could carry, while the water dashed in clouds from her bows, and rushed over her lee bulwarks.  But the sailing powers of the pirate-vessel were superior to those of the trading schooner.  In a short time she was close alongside, and fired a shot across her bows to cause her to heave-to.  This, however, the determined skipper resolved not to do.  In reply he sent on board the pirates the varied contents of the big gun, which cut the halyards of their smaller sail, and brought it down on the deck.  This result was celebrated by a hearty cheer from the schooner's crew.  The pirates, in return, discharged a broadside which cut away the foremast of the schooner, thus rendering escape impossible.  \"Now, men,\" cried Francisco, when the disaster occurred, \"you must this day make your choice--victory or slavery--for there is no mercy in the breasts of these scoundrels.\"  He waited for no reply, but at once sprang to the big gun, which had been re-loaded with a charge so miscellaneous that the sable Manqua grinned with satisfaction as he endeavoured to ram it home.  Meanwhile Mariano and Lucien placed the men, who were armed to the teeth, at the gangways, and along the weather-side of the schooner, to be in readiness to repel the foe when they should attempt to board.  There was no hesitation on the part of the pirates, although they saw plainly the vigorous preparations which were being made to receive them. Bearing down on the crippled vessel at full speed, in spite of the bellowing discharge from the great gun, and a well-delivered volley of small shot, which stretched many of them on the deck, they ran straight against her, threw grappling-irons into the rigging, and sprang on board with a fierce yell.  The melee that followed was sharp, but very short and decisive.  The Sicilian crew fought with the courage of desperate men, but were almost instantly overpowered by numbers.  Mariano had singled out the pirate captain as his own special foe.  In making towards the spot where he expected that he would board, he observed the tall Jew standing by the wheel with his arms crossed on his breast, and regarding the attack with apparent indifference.  \"What!\" cried Mariano, anger mingling with his surprise, \"do you stand idle at such a moment?\"  \"You will miss your chance,\" returned Bacri, giving a glance and a nod towards the side of the vessel where the pirate captain stood ready to spring.  Almost at the instant that the brief hint was given, Mariano had sprung to the bulwarks, and parried the thrust of a boarding-spike, which act unfortunately disconcerted his aim in discharging his pistol.  Next moment he had seized the pirate by the throat, and fell with him to the deck, where a fierce struggle ensued.  We have said that the Sicilian youth was powerfully made, but the pirate captain was more than a match for him in size, if not in courage; nevertheless, the superior activity of Mariano, coupled with the fact that he chanced to fall uppermost, gave him an advantage which would in a few moments have cost the pirate his life, had not a blow from behind rendered his youthful adversary insensible.  Rising hastily and regaining the yataghan which had fallen from his grasp in the struggle, the pirate captain was about to rush again into the fight, but, perceiving that although one or two of the schooner's crew still showed resistance, his men were almost everywhere in possession of the deck, he desisted, and turned with a look of surprise to the man who had freed him from his antagonist.  \"_You_ here, Bacri!\" he said.  \"Truly my fate is a hard one when it condemns me to be rescued by a dog of a Jew.\"  \"It might have been harder, Sidi Hassan, if it had condemned you to be slain by the hand of a Christian,\" replied the Jew, with an air of humility that scarcely harmonised with his towering height and his breadth of shoulder.  Hassan uttered a short laugh, and was about to reply when a shout from his men caused him to run to the forward part of the vessel, where Francisco, Lucien, and the warlike negro already referred to were still fighting desperately, surrounded by pirates, many of whom were badly wounded.  It was well for the three heroes that their foes had discharged all their pistols at the first rush.  Some of them, now rendered furious by the unexpectedly successful opposition made by the dauntless three, as well as by the smarting of their wounds, were hastily re-loading their weapons, when their captain came forward.  It was obvious that mercy or forbearance had been driven from their breasts, and that a few seconds more would put a bloody end to the unequal contest.  \"Spare them, Sidi Hassan,\" said the Jew in a deeply earnest tone.  \"Why should I spare them?\" returned the captain quietly; \"they deserve to die, and such men would prove to be but troublesome slaves.\"  The Jew bent towards Hassan's ear and whispered.  \"Ha! sayest thou so?\" exclaimed the pirate, with a piercing glance at his companion.  \"May I trust thee, Jew?\"  \"You may trust me,\" replied the Jew, apparently quite unmoved by the insolent tones of the other.  \"Stand back, men!\" cried Hassan, springing between the combatants; \"death by sword or pistol is too good for these Christian dogs; we shall reserve them for something better.\"  Then, turning to Francisco, \"Lay down your arms.\"  \"We will lay down our arms,\" answered the bluff merchant, who was not at all sorry to obtain this brief period of breathing-time, \"when we have laid you and a few more of your ruffians on the deck.\"  Hassan turned to his men and gave them an order in the Turkish language.  Several of them hurried aft, and immediately returned, dragging along with them poor Mariano, who was just recovering from the blow given to him by Bacri.  On seeing the plight of his father and brother he made a desperate effort to free himself, but quickly found that he was as helpless as a child in the grasp of the three powerful men who held him.  Hassan drew a pistol and put its muzzle to the youth's temple, then, turning to Francisco, said:--  \"Lay down your arms, else I scatter his brains on the deck.  Take your choice, but see that you be quick about it.\"  There was that in the pirate captain's tone and look which induced instant compliance.  Francisco and his companions, at once laying down their weapons, were seized and had their arms pinioned.  Mariano was also bound, and then their conquerors proceeded to clear the decks of the dead and wounded.  This was soon accomplished; a prize crew was placed in the schooner; the captives, still pinioned, were transferred to the deck of the pirate-vessel,"]]]
