We had hardly learned each other's names when one of them said something about the \"blank Yankees\"; but instantly, seeing something that might perhaps have appeared like Southern blood in my face, added, \"_You_ are not a _Yankee!_\"  I replied, \"Yes, I am from Illinois.\" \"Oh,\" said he, \"we don't call Western men Yankees.\"  In that remark I found my mission at West Point, as in after life, to be, as far as possible, a peacemaker between the hostile sections.  If the great West could have been heard, and its more dispassionate voice heeded, possibly peace might have been preserved.  My experience at West Point did not differ in many particulars from the general average of cadet life, but a few incidents may be worthy of special mention.  My experience in camp was comparatively limited. The first summer I was on guard only once.  Then the corporal of the grand rounds tried to charge over my post without giving the countersign, because I had not challenged promptly.  We crossed bayonets, but I proved too strong for him, and he gave it up, to the great indignation of the officer of the day, who had ordered him to charge, and who threatened to report me, but did not.  That night I slept on the ground outside the guard tents, and caught cold, from which my eyes became badly inflamed, and I was laid up in the hospital during the remainder of my encampment.  On that account I had a hard struggle with my studies the next year.  While sitting on the east porch of the hospital in the afternoon, I attracted the kind attention of General Winfield Scott, who became from that time a real friend, and did me a great service some years later.                                         CHARACTER OF THE WEST POINT TRAINING  In our third-class encampment, when corporal of the guard, I had a little misunderstanding one night with the sentinel on post along Fort Clinton ditch, which was then nearly filled by a growth of bushes.  The sentinel tore the breast of my shell-jacket with the point of his bayonet, and I tumbled him over backward into the ditch and ruined his musket.  But I quickly helped him out, and gave him my musket in place of his, with ample apologies for my thoughtless act.  We parted, as I thought, in the best of feeling; but many years later, a colonel in the army told me that story, as an illustration of the erroneous treatment sometimes accorded to sentinels in his time, and I was thus compelled to tell him I was that same corporal, to convince him that he had been mistaken as to the real character of the treatment he had received.  That third-class year I lived in the old North barracks, four of us in one room.  There, under the malign influence of two men who were afterward found deficient, I contracted the bad habit of fastening a blanket against the window after \"taps,\" so that no one could see us \"burning the midnight oil\" over pipes and cards. The corps of cadets was not as much disciplined in our day as it is now.  If it had been, I doubt if I should have graduated.  As it was, I got 196 demerits out of a possible 200 one year.  One more \"smoking in quarters\" would have been too much for me.  I protest now, after this long experience, that nothing else at West Point was either so enjoyable or so beneficial to me as smoking. I knew little and cared less about the different corps of the army, or about the value of class standing.  I became quite indignant when a distinguished friend rather reproved me for not trying to graduate higher--perhaps in part from a guilty conscience, for it occurred just after we had graduated.  I devoted only a fraction of the study hours to the academic course--generally an hour, or one and a half, to each lesson.  But I never intentionally neglected any of my studies.  It simply seemed to me that a great part of my time could be better employed in getting the education I desired by the study of law, history, rhetoric, and general literature. Even now I think these latter studies have proved about as useful to me as what I learned of the art and science of war; and they are essential to a good general education, no less in the army than in civil life.  I have long thought it would be a great improvement in the Military Academy if a much broader course could be given to those young men who come there with the necessary preparation, while not excluding those comparatively young boys who have only elementary education.  There is too much of the \"cast-iron\" in this government of law under which we live, but \"mild steel\" will take its place in time, no doubt.  The conditions and interests of so vast a country and people are too varied to be wisely subjected to rigid rules.  But I must not be misunderstood as disparaging the West Point education.  As it was, and is now, there is, I believe, nothing equal to it anywhere in this country.  Its methods of developing the reasoning faculties and habits of independent thought are the best ever devised.  West Point _training_ of the mind is practically perfect.  Its general discipline is excellent and indispensable in the military service.  Even in civil life something like it would be highly beneficial.  In my case that discipline was even more needed than anything else.  The hardest lesson I had to learn was to submit my will and opinions to those of an accidental superior in rank, who, I imagined, was my inferior in other things, and it took me many years to learn it.  Nothing is more absolutely indispensable to a good soldier than perfect subordination and zealous service to him whom the national will may have made the official superior for the time being.  I now think it one of the most important lessons of my own experience that, while I had no difficulty whatever in securing perfect subordination and obedience in a large public school when I was only seventeen years old, or ever afterward in any body of troops, from a squad of cadets up to a body of men, others did not find it by any means so easy to discipline me.  What I needed to learn was not so much how to command as how to obey.  My observation of others has also taught much the same lesson. Too early independence and exercise of authority seem to beget some degree of disrespect for the authority of others.  I once knew a young major-general who, in his zeal to prevent what he believed to be the improper application of some public funds, assumed to himself the action which lawfully belonged to the Secretary of War. The question thus raised was considered paramount to that of the proper use of the funds.  The young officer lost his point, and got a well-merited rebuke.  But it is not to be expected that complete military education can be obtained without complete military experience.  The rules of subordination and obedience _in_ an army are so simple that everybody learns them with the utmost ease. But the relations between the army and its administrative head, and with the civil power, are by no means so simple.  When a too confident soldier rubs up against them, he learns what \"military\" discipline really means.  It sometimes takes a civilian to \"teach a soldier his place\" in the government of a republic.  If a soldier desires that his own better judgment shall control military policy, he must take care not to let it become known that the judgment is his.  If he can contrive to let that wise policy be invented by the more responsible head, it will surely be adopted.  It should never be suspected by anybody that there is any difference of opinion between the soldier and his civil chief; and nobody, not even the chief, will ever find it out if the soldier does not tell it.  The highest quality attributed to Von Moltke was his ability to make it clearly understood by the Emperor and all the world that the Emperor himself commanded the German army.                                                A TRIP TO NEW YORK ON A WAGER  My constitutional habit once led me into a very foolish exploit at West Point.  A discussion arose as to the possibility of going to New York and back without danger of being caught, and I explained the plan I had worked out by which it could be done.  (I will not explain what the plan was, lest some other foolish boy try it.) I was promptly challenged to undertake it for a high wager, and that challenge overcame any scruple I may have had.  I cared nothing for a brief visit to New York, and had only five dollars in my pocket which Jerome N. Bonaparte loaned me to pay my way.  But I went to the city and back, in perfect safety, between the two roll- calls I had to attend that day.  Old Benny Havens of blessed memory rowed me across the river to Garrison's, and the Cold Spring ferryman back to the Point a few minutes before evening parade.  I walked across the plain in full view of the crowd of officers and ladies, and appeared in ranks at roll-call, as innocent as anybody.  It is true my up-train did not stop at Garrison's or Cold Spring, but the conductor, upon a hint as to the necessity of the case, kindly slackened the speed of the express so that I could jump off from the rear platform.  In due time I repaid Bonaparte the borrowed five dollars, but the wager was never paid.  The only other bet I made at West Point was on Buchanan's election; but that was in the interest of a Yankee who was not on speaking terms with the Southerner who offered the wager.  I have never had any disposition to wager anything on chance, but have always had an irresistible inclination to back my own skill whenever it has been challenged.  The one thing most to be condemned in war is the leaving to chance anything which by due diligence might be foreseen.  In the preparations for defense, especially, there is no longer any need that anything be left to chance or uncertainty.                                                   THE WEST POINT BIBLE-CLASS  I attended the Bible-class regularly every Sunday after I went to West Point, and"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21418"],["title","The Eugenic Marriage, Volume 4 (of 4) (#1)"],["body","walk. They dress him in a warm room taking plenty of time to put on the extra clothes, during which time the baby frets and perspires. When all is ready they place upon the hot, almost bald head of the baby a light artistically decorated airy creation which is sold in the shops as children's caps. The child is then taken out of doors and because of the inadequate covering of the hot perspiring head, catches cold and the mother never knows how it came.\" Every baby and child should wear under such caps a skull cap of thin flannel, especially in cold weather. In summer or windy day a light silk handkerchief folded under the cap is a very excellent protection.  D. Subjecting a Baby to Different Temperatures Suddenly, is liable to be followed by a cold--for example, taking the child from a warm room to a cold room, or through a cold hall, holding the child at an open window for a few moments.  E. The Practice of Wearing Rubbers Needs Some Consideration.--They should never be worn indoors for even five minutes. They should not therefore be kept on in school, nor should they be worn by women in stores when they go shopping. When it is actually raining, or snowing, or when there is slush or wet mud they are needful; but they should not be worn simply because the weather is threatening or damp. Children should not put them on to play--worn for any length of time when active they are harmful. If worn to and from school they should be taken off at once when in school or at home. Wearing rubbers prevents free evaporation of the natural secretion of the skin, keeps the feet moist and invites colds and catarrh. In damp weather, or when children play during winter months, they should be shod with stout shoes with cork insoles.  The same argument applies to storm coats of rubber, water-proof material. They should not be worn as overcoats all day, but only when going to and from school or business when it is actually storming.  Underclothing or hosiery should not be heavy enough to cause moisture of the skin. Health demands a dry skin at all times. The necessary degree of body heat should be attained by the quality of the outer clothing, not by the quantity of the underclothing. Many men and women wear heavy underclothing which causes moisture when indoors, with the result that they get surface chills when they go outside if the weather is cold and as a result catch cold. The underclothing should be just heavy enough to be comfortable indoors and the extra warmth necessary when outside should be supplied by a good overcoat or furs.  F. Direct Infection.--A baby may catch cold if kissed or \"hugged\" by an adult who has a cold.  Catching cold while bathing is possible, but scarcely probable, if ordinary precautions are taken. It is very bad practice to permit children to use one another's handkerchiefs or the handkerchief of an adult. Certain children are predisposed to attacks of \"cold in the head\" or acute coryza or nasal catarrh (these being the medical names for this condition). Sometimes this is an inherited characteristic. There is no doubt, however, that most of these children acquire the habit by bad sanitary and hygienic surroundings. These children do not as a rule get enough fresh air. They are kept indoors most of the time in stuffy, overheated, badly ventilated rooms, unless the weather is absolutely perfect. The windows in their bedrooms are always kept closed, because they are \"liable to catch cold.\" They are overdressed and perspire easily and as a result \"catch cold.\" These conditions all tend to create an unhealthy condition of the nasal mucous membrane and of the throat, and this is rendered worse if the child lives in a damp, changeable climate, such as that of New York City. In these susceptible children the exciting cause of an attack may be trivial; exposure, cold or wet feet, inadequate head covering (as already pointed out), a draught of cold air even may excite sneezing and a nasal discharge; hence we have:  Acute Nasal Catarrh (Acute Coryza, Acute Rhinitis, \"Cold in the Head\", \"Snuffles\").--Acute nasal catarrh may accompany measles, diphtheria, influenza, and whooping cough.  Symptoms.--The onset is sudden with sneezing, and difficulty in breathing through the nose. In a few hours, or it may be not for a day or two, a mucous, watery, nasal discharge appears. There are redness and slight swelling of the nose and upper lip, caused by the discharge. There is no fever as a general rule except in very young infants, in whom the fever may be very high. The discharge interferes with the nursing and the child suffers from lack of nourishment. The inflammation may extend to the eyes and ears, causing painful complications, or to the throat and bronchi, causing hoarseness and cough. Less frequently we have disturbances of the digestive tract with vomiting, or diarrhea.  The mild form of the disease lasts for two or three days, the severe form from one to two weeks.  Repeated attacks are said to contribute to the production of adenoid growths.  An acute attack of this disease is seldom a serious affliction in older children; it may be, however, very serious and even dangerous in very young infants. The tendency of the disease to extend downward, causing bronchitis or pneumonia, explains in part the possible danger to a baby. Another reason is because it may seriously interfere with suckling and with breathing in these little patients. It may even cause sudden attacks of strangulation. An infant, therefore, suffering with an acute attack of rhinitis requires constant attention. It may be necessary to feed it with a spoon, and if necessary mother's milk should be so fed. Plenty of fresh air should be provided. It may be essential to keep the mouth open in order that it may get enough fresh air. Every effort should be made to keep the nostrils open. The secretions must be removed from time to time. Causing the child to sneeze by tickling the nose with a camel's hair brush will clear the nose for the time being. The physician may be compelled to use a solution of cocaine for this purpose.  Treatment of Acute Rhinitis (\"Taking Cold\", Nasal Catarrh, Acute Coryza, \"Snuffles\").--A child suffering with an acute attack of \"cold in the head\" should be kept indoors in a room with a constant, uniform temperature; the particular reason for this is, that, if a child is exposed to cold at any time during an attack of \"cold in the head,\" it may cause the disease to invade the chest,--a tendency which it has at all times. The bowels must be kept open; if they do not move every day of their own accord they must be made to move by means of an enema of sweet oil or of soap-suds. The amount of food should be reduced to suit the circumstances and the condition of the patient.  We treat the local condition in the nose with a menthol mixture. The following is a very good one: Menthol, 30 grains; Camphor, 30 grains; White Vaseline, 1 ounce. Put some of this on the end of the finger and push it gently into each nostril. When the nostrils become blocked and the child cannot breathe through the nose, tickle the nose with a feather until it sneezes; this will clear the passage. Immediately after the sneeze place the menthol mixture in each nostril. When the child is about to sneeze place a handkerchief before the nose, as this discharge is full of germs and will infect others when dry. Internal remedies should not be used unless the child is distinctly sick and is running a fever, in which case a physician should look the child over and prescribe whatever is called for.  The upper lip and the nostrils of the child should be protected, because the discharge very quickly irritates the parts and renders them raw and painful. Vaseline or cold cream is very suitable for this purpose.  Mothers should not wash out the nose of a child with any solution advised for this purpose where force is used, as, for example, with a syringe. Any forceful irrigation of the nose is dangerous, because it would carry the infection into the deeper parts and set up a more serious condition.  If the above treatment is carefully carried out and the child unexposed to a fresh cold, two or three days will be sufficient to cure the disease.  It is not, however, the treatment of an acute attack of \"cold in the head\" that is important; it is intelligently to follow out a plan which will prevent these attacks from repeating themselves that is of consequence. The tendency to take cold is a real condition in childhood and a very common one. When mothers appreciate that it is possible to prevent this condition and to cure it when it is seemingly an established habit, more interest will undoubtedly be taken in the subject. Too frequently it is looked upon as an unfortunate affliction, but it is never regarded as a condition that is caused by neglect and ignorance.  It is an exceedingly common occurence to find a mother worrying over her child's cold, dosing it with cod liver oil or some other unnecessary tonic, rubbing it with camphorated oil or plastering it over with certain useless patent plasters, dressing it with extra pieces of flannel on its chest and extra clothes pinned snugly around it, then shutting it up in a warm, stuffy, unsanitary, ill-smelling room, in order to keep it from \"catching a fresh cold.\" Can you imagine anything else she could do to defeat her purpose?  No quantity of cod liver oil, no medicine, no coddling, will remove the tendency to \"catch cold.\" The child's life must be lived amidst sanitary surroundings and hygienic conditions first; then other expedients may be utilized if necessary. These children must be kept out of doors most of the time, unless during the severest wet weather. They should sleep in a room the windows of which are open at the top and bottom every night in the year. They should not, however, be in a draught. The rooms in which they live should be of a uniform temperature, never too hot and never too cold, between 68° and 70°"]]]
