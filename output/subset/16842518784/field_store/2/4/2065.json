But she does tell--ahem! _you know what_.\"  \"You wicked boy!\" cried the enraged Sarah; \"how dare you to say such a thing! and everybody in the place knows he's your ma's own pa.\"  \"I'll go and ask her,\" said Robin, and he was at the door in a moment; but Sarah, alarmed by the thought of getting into a scrape herself, caught him by the arm.  \"Don't you go, love; it'll only make your ma angry. There; it was all my nonsense.\"  \"Then it's not true?\" said Robin, indignantly. \"What did you tell me so for?\"  \"It was all my jokes and nonsense,\" said the unscrupulous Sarah. \"But your ma wouldn't like to know I've said such a thing. And Master Robert wouldn't be so mean as to tell tales, would he, love?\"  \"I'm not mean,\" said Robin, stoutly; \"and I don't tell tales; but you do, and you tell _you know what_, besides. However, I won't go this time; but I'll tell you what--if you tell tales of me to Papa any more, I'll tell him what you said about the old gentleman in the blue cloak.\" With which parting threat Robin strode, off to join his brothers and sister.  Sarah's tale had put the court-martial out of his head, and he leaned against the tall fender, gazing at his little sister, who was tenderly nursing a well-worn doll. Robin sighed.  \"What a long time that doll takes to wear out, Dora!\" said he. \"When will it be done?\"  \"Oh, not yet, not yet!\" cried Dora, clasping the doll to her, and turning away. \"She's quite good, yet.\"  \"How miserly you are,\" said her brother; \"and selfish, too; for you know I can't have a military funeral till you'll let me bury that old thing.\"  Dora began to cry.  \"There you go, crying!\" said Robin, impatiently. \"Look here: I won't take it till you get the new one on your birthday. You can't be so mean as not to let me have it then!\"  But Dora's tears still fell. \"I love this one so much,\" she sobbed. \"I love her better than the new one.\"  \"You want both; that's it,\" said Robin, angrily. \"Dora, you're the meanest girl I ever knew!\"  At which unjust and painful accusation Dora threw herself and the doll upon their faces, and wept bitterly. The eyes of the soft-hearted Nicholas began to fill with tears, and he squatted down before her, looking most dismal. He had a fellow-feeling for her attachment to an old toy, and yet Robin's will was law to him.  \"Couldn't we make a coffin, and pretend the body was inside?\" he suggested.  \"No, we couldn't,\" said Robin. \"I wouldn't play the Dead March after an empty candle-box. It's a great shame--and I promised she should be chaplain in one of my night-gowns, too.\"  \"Perhaps you'll get just as fond of the new one,\" said Nicholas, turning to Dora.  But Dora only cried, \"No, no! He shall have the new one to bury, and I'll keep my poor, dear, darling Betsy.\" And she clasped Betsy tighter than before.  \"That's the meanest thing you've said yet,\" retorted Robin; \"for you know Mamma wouldn't let me bury the new one.\" And, with an air of great disgust, he quitted the nursery.   \"A MUMMING WE WILL GO.\"  Nicholas had sore work to console his little sister, and Betsy's prospects were in a very unfavourable state, when a diversion was caused in her favour by a new whim which put the military funeral out of Robin's head.  After he left the nursery he strolled out of doors, and, peeping through the gate at the end of the drive, he saw a party of boys going through what looked like a military exercise with sticks and a good deal of stamping; but, instead of mere words of command, they all spoke by turns, as in a play. In spite of their strong Yorkshire accent, Robin overheard a good deal, and it sounded very fine. Not being at all shy, he joined them, and asked so many questions that he soon got to know all about it. They were practising a Christmas mumming-play, called \"The Peace Egg.\" Why it was called thus they could not tell, as there was nothing whatever about eggs in it, and so far from being a play of peace, it was made up of a series of battles between certain valiant knights and princes, of whom St. George of England was the chief and conqueror. The rehearsal being over, Robin went with the boys to the sexton's house (he was father to the \"King of Egypt\"), where they showed him the dresses they were to wear. These were made of gay-coloured materials, and covered with ribbons, except that of the \"Black Prince of Paradine,\" which was black, as became his title. The boys also showed him the book from which they learned their parts, and which was to be bought for one penny at the post-office shop.  \"Then are you the mummers who come round at Christmas, and act in people's kitchens, and people give them money, that Mamma used to tell us about?\" said Robin.  St. George of England looked at his companions as if for counsel as to how far they might commit themselves, and then replied, with Yorkshire caution, \"Well, I suppose we are.\"  \"And do you go out in the snow from one house to another at night? and oh, don't you enjoy it?\" cried Robin.  \"We like it well enough,\" St. George admitted.  Robin bought a copy of \"The Peace Egg.\" He was resolved to have a nursery performance, and to act the part of St. George himself. The others were willing for what he wished, but there were difficulties. In the first place, there are eight characters in the play, and there were only five children. They decided among themselves to leave out the \"Fool,\" and Mamma said that another character was not to be acted by any of them, or indeed mentioned; \"the little one who comes in at the end,\" Robin explained. Mamma had her reasons, and these were always good. She had not been altogether pleased that Robin had bought the play. It was a very old thing, she said, and very queer; not adapted for a child's play. If Mamma thought the parts not quite fit for the children to learn, they found them much too long; so in the end she picked out some bits for each, which they learned easily, and which, with a good deal of fighting, made quite as good a story of it as if they had done the whole. What may have been wanting otherwise was made up for by the dresses, which were charming.  Robin was St. George, Nicholas the Valiant Slasher, Dora the Doctor, and the other two Hector and the King of Egypt. \"And now we've no Black Prince!\" cried Robin in dismay.  \"Let Darkie be the Black Prince,\" said Nicholas. \"When you wave your stick he'll jump for it, and then you can pretend to fight with him.\"  \"It's not a stick, it's a sword,\" said Robin. \"However, Darkie may be the Black Prince.\"  \"And what's Pax to be?\" asked Dora; \"for you know he will come if Darkie does, and he'll run in before everybody else too.\"  \"Then he must be the Fool,\" said Robin, \"and it will do very well, for the Fool comes in before the rest, and Pax can have his red coat on, and the collar with the little bells.\"   CHRISTMAS EVE.  Robin thought that Christmas would never come. To the Captain and his wife it seemed to come too fast. They had hoped it might bring reconciliation with the old man, but it seemed they had hoped in vain.  There were times now when the Captain almost regretted the old bachelor's bequest. The familiar scenes of her old home sharpened his wife's grief. To see her father every Sunday in church, with marks of age and infirmity upon him, but with not a look of tenderness for his only child, this tried her sorely.  \"She felt it less abroad,\" thought the Captain. \"An English home in which she frets herself to death is, after all, no great boon.\"  Christmas Eve came.  \"I'm sure it's quite Christmas enough now,\" said Robin. \"We'll have 'The Peace Egg' to-night.\"  So as the Captain and his wife sat sadly over their fire, the door opened, and Pax ran in shaking his bells, and followed by the nursery mummers. The performance was most successful. It was by no means pathetic, and yet, as has been said, the Captain's wife shed tears.  \"What is the matter, Mamma?\" said St. George, abruptly dropping his sword and running up to her.  \"Don't tease Mamma with questions,\" said the Captain; \"she is not very well, and rather sad. We must all be very kind and good to poor dear Mamma;\" and the Captain raised his wife's hand to his lips as he spoke. Robin seized the other hand and kissed it tenderly. He was very fond of his mother. At this moment Pax took a little run, and jumped on to Mamma's lap, where, sitting facing the company, he opened his black mouth and yawned, with a ludicrous inappropriateness worthy of any clown. It made everybody laugh.  \"And now we'll go and act in the kitchen,\" said Nicholas.  \"Supper at nine o'clock, remember,\" shouted the Captain. \"And we are going to have real frumenty and Yule cakes, such as Mamma used to tell us of when we were abroad.\"  \"Hurray!\" shouted the mummers, and they ran off, Pax leaping from his seat just in time to hustle the Black Prince in the doorway. When the dining-room door was shut, St. George raised his hand, and said \"Hush!\"  The mummers pricked their ears, but there was only a distant harsh and scraping sound, as of stones rubbed together.  \"They're cleaning the passages,\" St. George went on, \"and Sarah told me they meant to finish the mistletoe, and have everything cleaned up by supper-time. They don't want us, I know. Look here, we'll go _real mumming_ instead. That _will_ be fun!\"  The Valiant Slasher grinned with delight.  \"But will mamma let us?\" he inquired.  \"Oh, it will be all right if we're back by supper-time,\" said St. George, hastily. \"Only of course we must take care not to catch cold. Come and help me to get some wraps.\"  The old oak chest in which spare shawls, rugs, and coats were kept was soon ransacked, and the mummers' gay dresses hidden by motley wrappers. But no sooner did Darkie and Pax behold the coats, &c., than they at once began to leap and bark, as it was their custom to do when they saw any one dressing to go out. Robin was sorely afraid that this would betray them; but though the Captain and his wife heard the barking they did not guess the cause.  "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20426"],["title","Form and Function: A Contribution to the History of Animal Morphology (#1)"],["body","ascribed to the final cause this work became really a treatise on the functions of the parts, a discussion of the problems of the relation of form to function, and the adaptedness of structure.  Aristotle was quite well aware that each of the big groups of animals was built upon one plan of structure, which showed endless variations \"in excess and defect\" in the different members of the group. But he did not realise that this fact of community of plan constituted a problem in itself. His interest was turned towards the functional side of living things, form was for him a secondary result of function.  Yet he was not unaware of facts of form for which he could not quite find a place in his theory of organic form, facts of form which were not, at first sight at least, facts of function. Thus he was aware of certain facts of \"correlation,\" which could not be explained off-hand as due to correlation of the functions of the parts. He knew, for instance, that all animals without front teeth in the upper jaw have cotyledons, while most that have front teeth on both jaws and no horns have no cotyledons (_De Gen._, ii. 7).  Speaking generally, however, we find in Aristotle no purely morphological concepts. What then does morphology owe to Aristotle? It owes to him, _first_, a great mass of facts about the structure of animals; _second_, the first scientific classification of animals;[6] _third_, a clear enunciation of the fact of community of plan within each of the big groups; _fourth_, an attempt to explain certain instances of the correlation of parts; _fifth_, a pregnant distinction between homogeneous and heterogeneous parts; _sixth_, a generalisation on the succession of forms in development; and _seventh_, the first enunciation of the idea of the _Échelle des êtres_.  (1) What surprises the modern reader of the _Historia Animalium_ perhaps more than anything else is the extent and variety of Aristotle's knowledge of animals. He describes more than 500 kinds.[7] Not only does he know the ordinary beasts, birds, and fishes with which everyone is acquainted, but he knows a great deal about cuttlefish, snails and oysters, about crabs, crawfish (_Palinurus_), lobsters, shrimps, and hermit crabs, about sea-urchins and starfish, sea-anemones and sponges, about ascidians (which seem to have puzzled him not a little!). He has noticed even fish-lice and intestinal worms, both flat and round. Of the smaller land animals, he knows a great many insects and their larvæ. The extent of his anatomical knowledge is equally surprising, and much of it is clearly the result of personal observation. No one can read his account of the internal anatomy of the chameleon (_Hist. Anim._, ii.), or his description of the structure of cuttlefish (_Hist. Anim._, iv), or that touch in the description of the hermit crab (_Hist. Anim._, iv.)--\" Two large eyes ... not ... turned on one side like those of crabs, but straight forward\"--without being convinced that Aristotle is speaking of what he has seen. Naturally he could not make much of the anatomy of small insects and snails, and, to tell the truth, he does not seem to have cared greatly about the minutiæ of structure. He was too much of a Greek and an aristocrat to care about laborious detail.  Not only did he lay a foundation for comparative anatomy, but he made a real start with comparative embryology. Medical men before him had known many facts about human development; Aristotle seems to have been the first to study in any detail the development of the chick. He describes this as it appears to the naked eye, the position of the embryo on the yolk, the palpitating spot at the third day, the formation of the body and of the large sightless eyes, the veins on the yolk, the embryonic membranes, of which he distinguished two.  (2) Aristotle had various systems of classifying animals. They could be classified, he thought, according to their structure, their manner of reproduction, their manner of life, their mode of locomotion, their food, and so on. Thus you might, in addition to structural classifications, divide animals into gregarious, solitary and social, or land animals into troglodytes, surface-dwellers, and burrowers (_Hist. Anim._, i.).  He knew that dichotomous classifications were of little use for animals (_De Partibus_, i. 3) and he explicitly and in so many words accepted the principle of all \"natural\" classification, that affinities must be judged by comparing not one but the sum total of characters. As everyone knows, he was the first to distinguish the big groups of animals, many of which were already distinguished roughly by the common usages of speech. Among his Sanguinea he did little more than define with greater exactitude the limits of the groups established by the popular classification. Among the \"exsanguineous\" animals, however, corresponding to our Invertebrates, he established a much more definite classification than the popular, which is apt to call them indiscriminately \"shellfish,\" \"insects,\" or \"creeping things.\" He went beyond the superficialities of popular classification, too, in clearly separating Cetacea from fishes. He had some notion of species and genera in our sense. He distinguished many species of cuttlefish--_Octopus (Polypus)_ of which there were many kinds, _Eledone (Moschites)_ which he knew to have only one row of suckers while _Octopus_ has two, _Argonauta, Nautilus, Sepia_, and apparently _Loligo media_ (= his Teuthis) and _L. vulgaris_(or _forbesii_) which seems to be his Teuthos. He had a grasp of the principles which should be followed in judging of the natural affinities of species. For example, he knew that the cuckoo resembles a hawk. \"But,\" he says, \"the hawk has crooked talons, which the cuckoo has not, nor does it resemble the hawk in the form of its head, but in these respects is more like the pigeon than the hawk, which it resembles in nothing but its colour; the markings, however, upon the hawk are like lines, while the cuckoo is spotted\" (_Hist. Anim._, Cresswell's trans., p. 147, London, 1862).  The groups he distinguished were--man, viviparous quadrupeds, oviparous quadrupeds, birds, fishes, Cetacea, Cephalopoda, Malacostraca (= higher Crustacea), Insecta (= annulose animals), Testacea (= molluscs, echinoderms, ascidians). A class of Acalephæ, including sea-anemones and sponges, was grouped with the Testacea. The first five groups were classed together as sanguineous, the others as exsanguineous, from the presence or absence of red blood.  Besides these classes \"there are,\" he says, \"many other creatures in the sea which it is not possible to arrange in any class from their scarcity\" (Creswell, _loc. cit._, p. 90).  (3) Aristotle's greatest service to morphology is his clear recognition of the unity of plan holding throughout each of the great groups.  He recognises this most clearly in the case of man and the viviparous quadrupeds, with whose structure he was best acquainted. In the _Historia Animalium_ he takes man as a standard, and describes his external and internal parts in detail, then considers viviparous quadrupeds and compares them with man. \"Whatever parts a man has before, a quadruped has beneath; those that are behind in man form the quadruped's back\" (Cresswell, _loc. cit._, p. 26). Apes, monkeys, and Cynocephali combine the characteristics of man and quadrupeds. He notices that all viviparous quadrupeds have hair. Oviparous quadrupeds resemble the viviparous, but they lack some organs, such as ears with an external pinna, mammæ, hair. Oviparous bipeds, or birds, also \"have many parts like the animals described above.\" He does not, however, seem to realise that a bird's wings are the equivalent of a mammal's arms or fore-legs. Fishes are much more divergent; they possess no neck, nor limbs, nor testicles (meaning a solid ovoid body such as the testis in mammals), nor mammæ. Instead of hair they have scales.  Speaking generally, the Sanguinea differ from man and from one another in their parts, which may be present or absent, or exhibit differences in \"excess and defect,\" or in form. Unity of plan extends to all the principal systems of organs. \"All sanguineous animals have either a bony or a spinous column. The remainder of the bones exist in some animals; but not in others, for if they have the limbs they have the bones belonging to them\" (Cresswell, _loc. cit._, p. 60). \"Viviparous animals with blood and feet do not differ much in their bones, but rather by analogy, in hardness, softness, and size\" (Cresswell, _loc. cit._, p. 59). The venous system, too, is built upon the same general plan throughout the Sanguinea. \"In all sanguineous animals, the nature and origin of the principal veins are the same, but the multitude of smaller veins is not alike in all, for neither are the parts of the same nature, nor do all possess the same parts\" (Cresswell, _loc. cit._, p. 56). It will be noticed in the first and last of these three quotations that Aristotle recognises the fact of correlation between systems of organs,--between limbs and bones, and between blood-vessels and the parts to which they go.  Sanguineous animals all possess certain organs--heart, liver, spleen, kidneys, and so on. Other organs occur in most of the classes--the oesophagus and the lungs. \"The position which these parts occupy is the same in all animals [sc. Sanguinea]\" (Cresswell, _loc. cit._, p. 39).  Unity of plan is observable not only in the Sanguinea, but also within each of the other large groups. Aristotle recognises that all his cuttlefish are alike in structure. Among his Malacostraca he compares point by point the external parts of the carabus (_Palinurus_), and the astacus (_Homarus_), and he compares also the general internal anatomy of the various \"genera\" he distinguishes. As regards Testacea, he writes, \"The nature of their internal structure is similar in all, especially in the turbinated animals, for they differ in size and"]]]
