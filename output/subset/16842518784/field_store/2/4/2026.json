INTROSPECTION THE ONLY MEANS OF DISCOVERING NATURE OF CONSCIOUSNESS.--What, then, is mind? What is the thing that we call consciousness? No mere definition can ever make it clearer than it is at this moment to each of us. The only way to know what mind is, is to look in upon our own consciousness and observe what is transpiring there. In the language of the psychologist, we must _introspect_. For one can never come to understand the nature of mind and its laws of working by listening to lectures or reading text books alone. There is no _psychology_ in the text, but only in your living, flowing stream of thought and mine. True, the lecture and the book may tell us what to look for when we introspect, and how to understand what we find. But the statements and descriptions about our minds must be verified by our own observation and experience before they become vital truth to us.  HOW WE INTROSPECT.--Introspection is something of an art; it has to be learned. Some master it easily, some with more difficulty, and some, it is to be feared, never become skilled in its use. In order to introspect one must catch himself unawares, so to speak, in the very act of thinking, remembering, deciding, loving, hating, and all the rest. These fleeting phases of consciousness are ever on the wing; they never pause in their restless flight and we must catch them as they go. This is not so easy as it appears; for the moment we turn to look in upon the mind, that moment consciousness changes. The thing we meant to examine is gone, and something else has taken its place. All that is left us then is to view the mental object while it is still fresh in the memory, or to catch it again when it returns.  STUDYING MENTAL STATES OF OTHERS THROUGH EXPRESSION.--Although I can meet only my own mind face to face, I am, nevertheless, under the necessity of judging your mental states and knowing what is taking place in your consciousness. For in order to work successfully with you, in order to teach you, understand you, control you or obey you, be your friend or enemy, or associate with you in any other way, I must _know_ you. But the real you that I must know is hidden behind the physical mask that we call the body. I must, therefore, be able to understand your states of consciousness as they are reflected in your bodily expressions. Your face, form, gesture, speech, the tone of voice, laughter and tears, the poise of attention, the droop of grief, the tenseness of anger and start of fear,--all these tell the story of the mental state that lies behind the senses. These various expressions are the pictures on the screen by which your mind reveals itself to others; they are the language by which the inner self speaks to the world without.  LEARNING TO INTERPRET EXPRESSION.--If I would understand the workings of your mind I must therefore learn to read the language of physical expression. I must study human nature and learn to observe others. I must apply the information found in the texts to an interpretation of those about me. This study of others may be _uncritical_, as in the mere intelligent observation of those I meet; or it may be _scientific_, as when I conduct carefully planned psychological experiments. But in either case it consists in judging the inner states of consciousness by their physical manifestations.  The three methods by which mind may be studied are, then: (1) text-book _description and explanation_; (2) _introspection_ of my own conscious processes; and (3) _observation_ of others, either uncritical or scientific.   2. THE NATURE OF CONSCIOUSNESS  INNER NATURE OF THE MIND NOT REVEALED BY INTROSPECTION.--We are not to be too greatly discouraged if, even by introspection, we cannot discover exactly _what_ the mind is. No one knows what electricity is, though nearly everyone uses it in one form or another. We study the dynamo, the motor, and the conductors through which electricity manifests itself. We observe its effects in light, heat, and mechanical power, and so learn the laws which govern its operations. But we are almost as far from understanding its true nature as were the ancients who knew nothing of its uses. The dynamo does not create the electricity, but only furnishes the conditions which make it possible for electricity to manifest itself in doing the world's work. Likewise the brain or nervous system does not create the mind, but it furnishes the machine through which the mind works. We may study the nervous system and learn something of the conditions and limitations under which the mind operates, but this is not studying the mind itself. As in the case of electricity, what we know about the mind we must learn through the activities in which it manifests itself--these we can know, for they are in the experience of all. It is, then, only by studying these processes of consciousness that we come to know the laws which govern the mind and its development. _What_ it is that thinks and feels and wills in us is too hard a problem for us here--indeed, has been too hard a problem for the philosophers through the ages. But the thinking and feeling and willing we can watch as they occur, and hence come to know.  CONSCIOUSNESS AS A PROCESS OR STREAM.--In looking in upon the mind we must expect to discover, then, not a _thing_, but a _process_. The _thing_ forever eludes us, but the process is always present. Consciousness is like a stream, which, so far as we are concerned with it in a psychological discussion, has its rise at the cradle and its end at the grave. It begins with the babe's first faint gropings after light in his new world as he enters it, and ends with the man's last blind gropings after light in his old world as he leaves it. The stream is very narrow at first, only as wide as the few sensations which come to the babe when it sees the light or hears the sound; it grows wider as the mind develops, and is at last measured by the grand sum total of life's experience.  This mental stream is irresistible. No power outside of us can stop it while life lasts. We cannot stop it ourselves. When we try to stop thinking, the stream but changes its direction and flows on. While we wake and while we sleep, while we are unconscious under an an√¶sthetic, even, some sort of mental process continues. Sometimes the stream flows slowly, and our thoughts lag--we \"feel slow\"; again the stream flows faster, and we are lively and our thoughts come with a rush; or a fever seizes us and delirium comes on; then the stream runs wildly onward, defying our control, and a mad jargon of thoughts takes the place of our usual orderly array. In different persons, also, the mental stream moves at different rates, some minds being naturally slow-moving and some naturally quick in their operations.  Consciousness resembles a stream also in other particulars. A stream is an unbroken whole from its source to its mouth, and an observer stationed at one point cannot see all of it at once. He sees but the one little section which happens to be passing his station point at the time. The current may look much the same from moment to moment, but the component particles which constitute the stream are constantly changing. So it is with our thought. Its stream is continuous from birth till death, but we cannot see any considerable portion of it at one time. When we turn about quickly and look in upon our minds, we see but the little present moment. That of a few seconds ago is gone and will never return. The thought which occupied us a moment since can no more be recalled, just as it was, than can the particles composing a stream be re-collected and made to pass a given point in its course in precisely the same order and relation to one another as before. This means, then, that we can never have precisely the same mental state twice; that the thought of the moment cannot have the same associates that it had the first time; that the thought of this moment will never be ours again; that all we can know of our minds at any one time is the part of the process present in consciousness at that moment.  [Illustration: FIG. 1]  [Illustration: FIG. 2]  THE WAVE IN THE STREAM OF CONSCIOUSNESS.--The surface of our mental stream is not level, but is broken by a wave which stands above the rest; which is but another way of saying that some one thing is always more prominent in our thought than the rest. Only when we are in a sleepy reverie, or not thinking about much of anything, does the stream approximate a level. At all other times some one object occupies the highest point in our thought, to the more or less complete exclusion of other things which we might think about. A thousand and one objects are possible to our thought at any moment, but all except one thing occupy a secondary place, or are not present to our consciousness at all. They exist on the margin, or else are clear off the edge of consciousness, while the one thing occupies the center. We may be reading a fascinating book late at night in a cold room. The charm of the writer, the beauty of the heroine, or the bravery of the hero so occupies the mind that the weary eyes and chattering teeth are unnoticed. Consciousness has piled up in a high wave on the points of interest in the book, and the bodily sensations are for the moment on a much lower level. But let the book grow dull for a moment, and the make-up of the stream changes in a flash. Hero, heroine, or literary style no longer occupies the wave. They forfeit their place, the wave is taken by the bodily sensations, and we are conscious of the smarting eyes and shivering body, while these in turn give way to the next object which occupies the wave. Figs. 1-3 illustrate these changes.  [Illustration: FIG. 3]  CONSCIOUSNESS LIKENED TO A FIELD.--The consciousness of any moment has been less happily likened to a field, in the center of which there is an elevation higher than the surrounding level. This center is where consciousness"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20223"],["title","Two Boys in Wyoming: A Tale of Adventure (#1)"],["body"," closed behind them, and, drawing their chairs close together, they talked in low tones, as if some dreadful penalty would follow a discovery of what was passing between them. Had any one been able to see the two attractive countenances, he would not have had to be told that the same thought was in the mind of each.  \"I tell you, Jack,\" said Fred, with impressive solemnity, \"it would be a shame; it will never do; we must not allow it.\"  \"Allow what?\"  \"Why you heard your father say that he never expected to go out to Wyoming to look at that ranch he has bought.\"  \"I could have told you that much, without waiting for him to say it. It will be just like him to give it away for a song.\"  \"And who knows but that it contains valuable gold or silver mines? I have heard of treasures being bought in that way.\"  \"That may be,\" was the thoughtful response of Jack, \"though I believe most of Wyoming--that is the valleys and plains--is a grazing country.\"  \"I don't know much about the country, but I have read enough to learn that the greatest discoveries of gold and silver have been in places where no one expected to find them. What I am getting at, Jack, is that your father should make up his mind not to part with his interest in the ranch till he knows all about it.\"  \"How is he to learn, when he won't go near it? Of course he can write to the people out there, but likely they will not tell him the truth.\"  \"He must send some one whom he can trust, and let him investigate.\"  \"That does seem to be a sensible plan,\" remarked Jack, as if the thought had not been in his mind from the first.  \"A sensible plan!\" repeated the enthusiastic Fred, \"it is the _only_ plan; nothing else can make it sure that he is not being swindled out of a big fortune.\"  Jack was silent a moment, while he looked steadily into the brown eyes of his chum, who half-smilingly met the scrutiny. Then the whole scheme burst forth.  \"And whom can your father trust before _us_? He must see that the best thing he can do is to send us out there to make a full investigation. We won't charge him anything like what he would have to pay other folks.\"  \"Of course not; only our travelling expenses and supplies.\"  \"What do you mean by supplies?\"  \"Say a Winchester rifle and a revolver apiece, with the proper ammunition; what sort of supplies did you think I meant?\"  \"I thought it was food, while we were out hunting.\"  Jack turned up his nose.  \"If we can't keep ourselves supplied with food, when we are in a country that has the finest game in the world, we deserve to starve.\"  \"My sentiments exactly;\" and as if the coincidence required something in the nature of a compact, the boys shook hands over it.  \"What a splendid treat it would be for us to spend some weeks out in Wyoming!\" exclaimed Jack Dudley, his eyes sparkling and his cheeks glowing; \"it looks as if it were providential that father got hold of that ranch.\"  \"There can't be any doubt about it; but how much more providential it will be if we are sent to learn all that should be learned about it! I wonder if that can be brought about?\"  Enough has been told for the reader to understand the plot formed by these two youths. There could be no question of the grand treat it would prove to both, provided their parents could be persuaded to take the same view of the matter; _there_ was the rub.  Jack crossed his legs and thoughtfully scratched his head. Unconsciously Fred did the same.  \"It's a tougher problem than we ever attacked in Euclid,\" remarked the younger. Then a bright thought struck him.  \"Don't I look a little pale, Jack?\"  \"You look as if a month's vacation in the autumn would be acceptable; but the fact is, Fred, I never saw you look better than you do this minute.\"  Fred sighed.  \"I am afraid I can't work that on father. He's too good a doctor for me to worry him about my health.\"  \"How about _me_?\"  Fred shook his head.  \"You look as strong as an oak knot, and you are, too; no, we can't make them think we are in need of a month in Wyoming. We shall have to try another tack. Now, there is no doubt that if we spend the month of September putting in extra work on our studies, we can stand the following month in laying off. We shall come back with new vigor and appetite, and soon catch up with our class.\"  \"There isn't a particle of doubt about that, but it still remains that we must convince our fathers that it will be a wise course to send us away from home. We can't do it by looking pale and weak, for we can't look pale and weak. We must fix on something else or it's no go.\"  \"Why not fall back on what we first talked about?\"  \"What's that?\"  \"Make your father think it will be a prudent thing for him to send you out there to look after his property.\"  \"Suppose I should convince him on that point, how about _you_?\"  \"You will need some one to look after you, and I'm just the fellow.\"  \"We are both satisfied in our own minds; in fact we were from the first; but our fathers are very hard-headed men.\"  Now, a couple of boys may be very shrewd, but it often happens that their parents are a good deal shrewder, a fact which my young readers will do well to remember.  Unsuspected by Jack Dudley and Fred Greenwood, their parents read on the instant the momentous problem which assumed form in the brains of their sons. When the younger signalled to his chum to follow him out of the room, the two gentlemen understood what it meant as clearly as if they overheard all the conversation that followed. Waiting until they were beyond hearing, Doctor Greenwood looked at his friend and remarked, with a smile:  \"They are hit hard.\"  \"No doubt of it; their hearts are set on making a visit to the ranch, and it would be singular if it were otherwise. We can feel for them, for we were once boys.\"  \"Yes, John, and it's longer ago than we like to recall. What do you think of it?\"  \"You know we have always agreed that many parents injure their children by undue indulgence.\"  \"True, and we have been indulgent to ours, but not improperly so. A great deal depends upon the children themselves. Jack and Fred are obedient, studious, and have good principles. If we should say 'No' to this scheme of theirs they would be disappointed, almost beyond what we can understand, but neither would protest or sulk. They would study just as hard as ever. It is that which appeals to us. If they were sullen and dissatisfied we wouldn't care; but, John, you and I have each been blessed with model sons, and they are entitled to privileges which it would not be safe to grant to other boys. I confess I feel like sending both out to Wyoming for an outing.\"  \"Of course it would spoil the enjoyment of Jack unless he could take Fred with him, but what excuse shall we make, Doc?\"  How reluctant a father is to appear weak and too conciliatory toward his child! These two men had virtually decided to grant the fervent wish of their sons, but it must be done in a common-sense way. They could not say \"Boys, since you have set your hearts on this we grant it,\" but they must fix upon some scheme that would made it seem a necessity that they should go thither.  And now observe how ludicrously similar their thoughts were to those that were agitating their offspring up stairs.  \"I have been thinking,\" observed the physician, \"of suggesting to them that they are in need of an extension of their vacation; but what a farce it would be! School opens next Monday, and they are the types of rugged health, strength and activity. If I undertook to make such a proposition I couldn't keep my face straight, and I am sure both would burst out laughing.\"  \"I know _I_ should, if I were present.\"  \"Parents must not make dunces of themselves before their children,\" was the philosophical remark of the physician; \"some other plan must be adopted.\"  Mr. Dudley leaned forward in his chair and slapped the shoulder of the physician, his face aglow.  \"I have it, Doc!\"  \"Let me hear it, for I admit that I am cornered.\"  \"I will take the ground that, since I have become part owner of this large tract of land, my first duty is to learn the truth about it. I can write to parties out there, but they are all strangers to me, and there is no saying how much reliance can be placed on their reports. What is necessary is an agent who will make an intelligent and honest report; and surely we can trust our own sons to do that.\"  \"But, John,\" remarked the doctor, with his pleasant smile, \"there are scores of people right here at home who will do that for you. Suppose Jack reminds you of the fact?\"  \"If he hasn't any more sense than to make such a suggestion, then, by gracious! I'll punish him by sending some one else.\"  \"Little fear of Jack saying anything of that nature. Even if he undertook to do so, Fred would place his hand over his mouth. But, John, let's understand the matter before we say anything to them. Your plan of sending out Jack to inspect the property is a good one. It sounds business-like, and must strike them that way; so that difficulty is removed. You and I don't know anything about the region, nor the best time for hunting game, but it is fair to believe that the month of October will be suitable. Suppose we keep them in school throughout September, and then give them a month's leave of absence, to examine and report upon your property. If all goes well, they are to appear here, ready to resume their studies on the first Monday in November.\"  \"I can suggest no improvement upon that. No doubt the young rascals are up-stairs, plotting how to bring us round to their way of thinking. Suppose you call them down, Doc. Shall you or I unfold our brilliant scheme?\"  \"You, by all means, since the property is yours.\"  The physician opened the door of his office and called \"Fred!\" There was instant response, \"Yes, sir.\" \"I would like to see you and Jack for a few minutes in the office.\"  \"Yes, sir; we are coming.\"  And a minute later they arrived, handsome, glowing and expectant.  \"Mr."]]]
