It is true not only of this government, but also of all others.\"  A middle-aged, heavy-faced man in a general's uniform entered and began to talk earnestly to one of the other generals.  \"That is General Markham,\" said Talbot, \"who is specially interesting not because of himself, but on account of his wife. She is years younger than he, and is said to be the most brilliant woman in Richmond. She has plans for the General, but is too smart to say what they are. I doubt whether the General himself knows.\"  Raymond and Winthrop presently stopped playing and Talbot promptly introduced his new friend.  \"We should know each other since we belong to the same army,\" said Raymond. \"You fight and I write, and I don't know which of us does the more damage; but the truth is, I've but recently joined the Army of Northern Virginia. I've been following the army in the West, but the news didn't suit me there and I've come East.\"  \"I hope that you have many victories to chronicle,\" said Prescott.  \"It's been a long time since there's been a big battle,\" resumed the editor, \"and so I've come up to Richmond to see a little life.\"  He glanced about the room.  \"And I see it here,\" he added. \"I confess that the fleshpots of Richmond are pleasant.\"  Then he began to talk of the life in the capital, the condition of the army and the Confederate States, furnishing a continual surprise to Prescott, who now saw that beneath the man's occasional frivolity and epicurean tastes lay a mind of wonderful penetration, possessing that precious quality generally known as insight. He revealed a minute knowledge of the Confederacy and its chieftains, both civil and military, but he never risked an opinion as to its ultimate chances of success, although Prescott waited with interest to hear what he might say upon this question, one that often troubled himself. But however near Raymond might come to the point, he always turned gracefully away again.  They were sitting now in a cheerful corner as they talked, but at the table nearest them was a man of forty, with immense square shoulders, a heavy red face and an overbearing manner. He was playing faro and losing steadily, but every time he lost he marked the moment with an angry exclamation. The others, players and spectators alike, seemed to avoid him, and Winthrop, who noticed Prescott's inquiring glance, said:  \"That's Redfield, a member of our Congress,\" and he named the Gulf State from which Redfield came. \"He belonged to the Legislature of his State before the war, which he advocated with all the might of his lungs--no small power, I assure you--and he was leader in the shouting that one Southern gentleman could whip five Yankees. I don't know whether he means that he's the Southern gentleman, as he's never yet been on the firing line, but he's distinguishing himself just now by attacking General Lee for not driving all the Yankees back to Washington.\"  Redfield at length left the game, uttering with an oath his opinion that fair play was impossible in the Nonpareil, and turned to the group seated near him, regarding the Richmond editor with a lowering brow.  \"I say, Winthrop,\" he cried, \"I've got a bone to pick with you. You've been hitting me pretty hard in that rag of yours. Do you know what a public man down in the Gulf States does with an editor who attacks him! Why, he goes around to his office and cowhides the miserable little scamp until he can't lie down comfortably for a month.\"  A slight pink tint appeared in the cheeks of Winthrop.  \"I am not well informed about the custom in the Gulf States, Mr. Redfield,\" he said, \"but here I am always at home to my enemies, as you ought to know.\"  \"Oh, nonsense!\" exclaimed Raymond. \"You two can't fight. We can't afford to lose Redfield. He's going to lead a brigade against the Yankees, and if he'll only make one of those fiery speeches of his it will scare all the blue-backs out of Virginia.\"  Redfield's red face flushed to a deeper hue, and he regarded the speaker with aversion, but said nothing in reply, fearing Raymond's sharp tongue. Instead, he turned upon Prescott, who looked like a mild youth fit to stand much hectoring.  \"You don't introduce me to your new friend,\" he said to Talbot.  \"Mr. Redfield, Captain Prescott,\" said Talbot. \"Mr. Redfield is a Member of Congress and Captain Prescott comes from the Army of Northern Virginia, though by way of North Carolina, where he has been recently on some special duty.\"  \"Ah, from the Army of Northern Virginia,\" said Redfield in a heavy growl. \"Then can you tell me, Mr. Prescott, why General Lee does not drive the Yankees out of Virginia?\"  A dark flush appeared on Prescott's face. Usually mild, he was not always so, and he worshiped General Lee.  \"I think it is because he does not have the help of men like yourself,\" he replied.  A faint ray of a smile crossed the face of Raymond, but the older man was not pleased.  \"Do you know, sir, that I belong to the Confederate Congress?\" he exclaimed angrily; \"and moreover, I am a member of the Military Committee. I have a right to ask these questions.\"  \"Then,\" replied Prescott, \"you should know that it is your duty to ask them of General Lee and not of me, a mere subaltern.\"  \"Now, Mr. Redfield,\" intervened Raymond, \"don't pick a quarrel with Captain Prescott. If there's to be a duel, Winthrop has first claim on you, and I insist for the honour of my profession that he have it. Moreover, since he is slender and you are far from it, I demand that he have two shots to your one, as he will have at least twice as much to kill.\"  Redfield growled out other angry words, which stopped under the cover of his heavy mustache, and then turned abruptly away, leaving Prescott in some doubt as to his personal courage but none at all as to his ill will.  \"It is the misfortune of the South,\" said Raymond, \"to have such men as that, who think to settle public questions by personal violence. They give us a bad name which is not wholly undeserved. In fact, personal violence is our great sin.\"  \"And the man has a lot of power. That's the worst of it,\" added Talbot. \"The boys at the front are hauled around so much by the politicians that they are losing confidence in everybody here in Richmond. Why, when President Davis himself came down and reviewed us with a great crowd of staff officers before Missionary Ridge, the boys all along the line set up the cry: 'Give us somethin' to eat, Mr. Jeff; give us somethin' to eat! We're hungry! We're hungry!' And that may be the reason why we were thrashed so badly by Grant not long after.\"  Prescott saw that the rain had almost ceased, and as he suggested that he must hurry on, the others rose to go with him from the house. He left them at the next corner, glad to have made such friends, and quickened his footsteps as he continued alone.     CHAPTER II  A MAN'S MOTHER   It was a modest house to which Prescott turned his steps, built two stories in height, of red brick, with green shutters over the windows, and in front a little brick-floored portico supported on white columns in the Greek style. His heart gave a great beat as he noticed the open shutters and the thin column of smoke rising from the chimney. The servants at least were there! He had been gone three years, and three years of war is a long time to one who is not yet twenty-five. There was no daily mail from the battlefield, and he had feared that the house would be closed.  He lifted the brass knocker and struck but once. That was sufficient, as before the echo died his mother herself, come before the time set, opened the door. Mrs. Prescott embraced her son, and she was even less demonstrative than himself, though he was generally known to his associates as a reserved man; but he knew the depth of her feelings. One Northern mother out of every ten had a son who never came back, but it was one Southern mother in every three who was left to mourn.  She only said: \"My son, I feared that I should never see you again.\" Then she noticed the thinness of his clothing and its dampness. \"Why, you are cold and wet,\" she added.  \"I do not feel so now, mother,\" he replied.  She smiled, and her smile was that of a young girl. As she drew him toward the fire in a dusky room it seemed to him that some one else went out.  \"I heard your footsteps on the portico,\" she said.  \"And you knew that it was me, mother,\" he interrupted, as he reached down and patted her softly on the cheek.  He could not remember the time when he did not have a protecting feeling in the presence of his mother--he was so tall and large, and she so small. She scarcely reached to the top of his shoulder, and even now, at the age of forty-five, her cheeks had the delicate bloom and freshness of a young girl's.  \"Sit by the fire here,\" she said, as she pushed him into an armchair that she pulled directly in front of the grate.  \"No, you must not do that,\" she added, taking the poker from his hand. \"Don't you know that it is a delight for me to wait upon you, my son come from the war!\"  Then she prodded the coals until they glowed a deep red and the room was suffused with generous warmth.  \"What is this bundle that you have?\" she asked, taking it from him.  \"A new uniform, mother, that I have just bought, and in which I hope to do you credit.\"  She flitted about the room attending to his wants, bringing him a hot drink, and she would listen to no account of himself until she was sure that he was comfortable. He followed her with his eyes, noting how little she had changed in the three years that had seemed so long.  She was a Northern woman, of a Quaker family in Philadelphia, whom his father had married very young and brought to live on a great place in Virginia. Prescott always believed she had never appreciated the fact that she was entering a new social world when she left Philadelphia; and there, on the estate of her husband, a just and generous man, she saw slavery under its most favourable"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21322"],["title","The Tale of Betsy Butterfly (#1)"],["body","same time. And, much to his surprise, Spot found his head inside the butterfly net. The long broomstick handle thumped him sharply on his back. And the silly fellow took fright at once.  With yelps of terror he scurried out of the flower garden. And Johnnie picked himself up just in time to see Spot tearing across the meadow toward the woods.  \"Spot! Spot! Come back!\" Johnnie Green shouted. But old Spot paid no attention to his young master. Perhaps he was too scared to hear him.  Spot wanted to get rid of that net that covered his head. And he knew of no better place to go than the woods where he hoped to be able to free himself from his odd muzzle by rubbing against a tree or nosing among some bushes.  Johnnie ran a little way after him. But when he saw Spot duck into the woods he turned back sadly towards the house. For all he knew, old Spot might run a mile further before he stopped.  Johnnie would have to make a new net if he wanted to catch any more butterflies for his collection.  And the trouble was, he had no more mosquito netting.  A good many of the field people saw old Spot as he dashed off with the butterfly net over his head. And they enjoyed a hearty laugh at the strange sight.  As for Betsy Butterfly, she had learned to watch out for Johnnie Green. And she knew that another time he would have to be twice as spry as he had shown himself, if he expected to capture her.  Old Spot didn't come home till afternoon. When he appeared at last he looked very sheepish. He hoped no one had noticed his fright. And he wouldn't go near the flower garden again for a whole week.     IV  BUSYBODIES   LITTLE Mrs. Ladybug said that she wished Betsy Butterfly no ill luck. But she thought that perhaps it would have been a good thing for her if Johnnie Green had caught her and put her in his collection.  On hearing that strange remark Mehitable Moth turned quite pale. She never wanted Johnnie Green's name mentioned by anyone, because she lived in constant terror for fear he might mistake her for one of the Butterfly family and capture her.  \"What _do_ you mean?\" she asked Mrs. Ladybug, while fat Jennie Junebug waddled nearer them, in order to hear everything they said. Though Jennie was sleepy, having stayed out very late the night before, the promise of a bit of gossip made her brighten up at once.  \"I mean--\" said Mrs. Ladybug--\"I mean that Johnnie Green would certainly have brushed Betsy Butterfly before adding her to his collection.\" And then, seeing a blank look on the faces of her hearers, she cried. \"Don't tell me you haven't noticed how untidy Betsy Butterfly is! Can it be possible that the airs she gives herself, and her fine manners, have deceived you?\"  \"What is it?\" asked Mehitable Moth breathlessly. And as for Jennie Junebug, her breath was coming so fast that she couldn't say a word.  \"I'll tell you exactly what I mean,\" Mrs. Ladybug continued. \"I stopped and spoke to Betsy Butterfly this very morning. And I stepped up close to her, because I wanted to see if she really does paint her wings, as my friend Miss Moth, here, suspects,\" Mrs. Ladybug explained to Jennie Junebug. \"And what do you think? I saw that Betsy Butterfly was _completely covered with dust_, from head to foot!\"  Mehitable Moth looked rather uncomfortable. She was somewhat dusty herself. And she thought that Mrs. Ladybug might be giving her a sly dig.  \"Perhaps Betsy had been on a journey,\" she ventured.  \"Ah! But there is no dust to-day, on account of the rain we had last night,\" Mrs. Ladybug replied. \"I'm convinced that the dust I saw on Betsy Butterfly was _weeks old_.\"  \"The idea!\" Jennie Junebug exclaimed. \"I should think she'd be ashamed of herself. Did you tell her how untidy she looked?\"  Mrs. Ladybug shook her head.  \"No!\" she answered. \"But I've been thinking the matter over. And I believe it's my duty to speak to her about it. I don't see what she's thinking of, to go about looking like that!\"  Miss Moth looked more uneasy than ever, especially when Mrs. Ladybug said:  \"Wouldn't you like to come with me while I look for Betsy?\"  \"I must go home now, thank you!\" said Mehitable. And she hurried away without another word.  But Jennie Junebug spoke up at once and said she would be delighted to accompany Mrs. Ladybug.  \"Really,\" Jennie confided to her companion, \"it's a good thing to have backs as hard and slippery as yours and mine. For the dust can't stick to us as it does to some.\"  \"There's no excuse for not keeping oneself neat,\" Mrs. Ladybug said severely. \"And I shall give Betsy Butterfly a piece of my mind.\"     V  NO JOKER   MUCH to Mrs. Ladybug's surprise, she did not find Betsy Butterfly in the flower garden.  \"It's too bad she's not here,\" Mrs. Ladybug remarked to her friend Jennie Junebug, who accompanied her. \"We'll have to look in the meadow. And it may take a long time to find Betsy there.\"  Jennie Junebug yawned right in Mrs. Ladybug's face.  \"Then I can't come with you,\" she said. \"I'm getting terribly sleepy again. And since I expect to be up all night, I'm going to take a nap.\"  Mrs. Ladybug looked at Jennie with great disapproval as that fat young person crept under a leaf and went to sleep.  \"Things have come to a pretty pass when ladies stay out all night!\" she muttered. \"It was not that way when I was a girl. But times have changed for the worse.\"  The longer Mrs. Ladybug stared at her sleeping friend, the more she thought that she ought to wake her up. \"If I rouse her she'll be so drowsy to-night that she'll simply have to go to bed,\" Mrs. Ladybug thought.  So she poked Jennie Junebug several times.  But Jennie Junebug only stirred slightly and murmured something in her sleep.  And seeing that it was useless to try to awaken her Mrs. Ladybug set out for the meadow alone.  The sun hung low in the west when Mrs. Ladybug found Betsy Butterfly among a clump of milk-weed blossoms. But Mrs. Ladybug did not care what time it was. She was satisfied when she saw that Betsy was just as dusty as ever. For, to tell the truth, little Mrs. Ladybug was so jealous of the beautiful Betsy that she _wanted_ to say something disagreeable to her.  \"Hasn't this been a lovely day?\" Betsy Butterfly cried happily, as soon as she noticed Mrs. Ladybug. \"I've enjoyed every moment of it. Ever since I saw you in the flower garden this morning I've been here in the meadow, flitting from one blossom to another.\"  \"You might better have spent a little of your time in a different way,\" Mrs. Ladybug remarked with a frown.  Betsy Butterfly looked up in surprise, withdrawing her long tongue from the blossom in which she had just buried it.  \"_Ugh!_\" A shudder shook prim Mrs. Ladybug. \"Please coil your tongue!\" she begged. \"I can't bear the sight of it. But I must say that I ought not to expect good manners in a person who goes about looking as untidy as you do.\"  Betsy Butterfly laughed gaily.  \"I didn't know you were such a joker!\" she exclaimed.  \"Oh, I'm not joking,\" Mrs. Ladybug said. \"I mean every word I say.\"  \"Then I wouldn't talk so much, if I were you,\" Betsy Butterfly advised her with a merry twinkle in her eye. And before Mrs. Ladybug could say another word Betsy Butterfly flew away and left her spluttering and choking.  \"She insulted me!\" Mrs. Ladybug screamed, as soon as she was able to speak. \"She insulted me. And then she hurried off because she didn't dare stay!\"  But Mrs. Ladybug was mistaken about one thing. Betsy Butterfly knew that she had just time to reach home before sunset. So that was why she left so suddenly. For she never was willing to travel when the sun was not shining.  \"I'll see Betsy in the morning,\" Mrs. Ladybug promised herself savagely. \"I'll make it my business to follow her everywhere she goes, until I've given her a good talking to.\"     VI  MRS. LADYBUG'S ADVICE   LITTLE did Betsy Butterfly guess what Mrs. Ladybug intended to say to her. And if she had known what it was she would have been merely amused. For Betsy was entirely too sweet-tempered to take offense at anybody's fault-finding--least of all that of Mrs. Ladybug, who was really a good-hearted soul, when she wasn't jealous. And when Betsy went to the flower garden early the next morning she felt kindly towards the whole world, not even excepting Johnnie Green, though he had tried to capture her.  Well, Mrs. Ladybug was waiting for Betsy Butterfly among the flowers. She had been in such haste to reach the garden early that she had not stopped to have her breakfast. And like many people who have not drunk their morning cup of coffee, she was in a very peevish mood.  \"Now, Miss Pert, I want you to listen to me!\" That was Mrs. Ladybug's greeting to Betsy Butterfly on one of the most delightful days of the whole summer. \"It's my unpleasant duty--\" said Mrs. Ladybug, who by that time was enjoying herself thoroughly--\"it's my unpleasant duty to tell you that people are talking about you. They say that you're going about _covered with dust_! And as a friend, I advise you to give yourself a thorough brushing each morning, and as often thereafter as may be necessary.\"  Betsy Butterfly had listened in amazement to Mrs. Ladybug's words. And she had hard work not to laugh, too, because she thought Mrs. Ladybug's advice decidedly funny.  \"Thank you very much!\" Betsy said most politely. \"I'll remember what you've told me.\"  Somehow Mrs. Ladybug thought that Betsy meant she would follow her advice. And she looked quite pleased.  \"I shall expect a great improvement in your appearance the next time I see you,\" she announced. And with the manner of a person who has just done somebody a good turn she hurried away to get the breakfast that was waiting for her, somewhere.  Then Betsy Butterfly enjoyed a good laugh.  \"How ridiculous!\" she said to herself. \"But I won't tell Mrs. Ladybug of her mistake, because she might feel upset if I did.\" And you can see, just by that, how kind-hearted Betsy was. She did not even tell her own family about the joke, for fear of"]]]
