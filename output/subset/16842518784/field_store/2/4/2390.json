He did not wish to alarm her, and tried to smile as he said that the struggle would be brief--it would soon be over.  \"But tell me, where lies the danger?\" persisted Pauline.  \"I do not quite see it.\"  \"`Where ignorance is bliss,' dear, `'tis folly to be wise,'\" returned Dominick, with an unsuccessful effort to look more at ease.  \"Nay, brother, but I am not ignorant that danger exists--only ignorant as to the amount and nature of it.  Surely there cannot be much risk in pushing our boat through that white foam that lines the shore with so soft a fringe.\"  \"I should think not,\" broke in the pert and inexperienced Otto; \"why, Pina,\" (thus he abridged his sister's name), \"there's as much danger, I should think, in pushing through a tub of soap-suds.\"  \"Come, Dom,\" returned the girl, \"explain it to me; for if you don't point out where the danger really lies, if you leave me in this state of partial ignorance, I shall be filled with alarm instead of bliss from this moment till we reach the shore.\"  \"Well, well, sister,\" said Dominick, when thus urged; \"if you must have it, I will explain.\"  He went on to show that when the boat came near the shore the waves would grasp it, instead of letting it slip back; would carry it swiftly in on their crests, so that the great difficulty in such a case would be to keep the boat's head pointing to the land, and if he failed to do so, they would infallibly be overturned and have to swim ashore.  \"Well, that would be unpleasant, Dom,\" said the ignorant, as well as innocent, Pauline, \"but it would not matter much, for we can all swim-- thanks to you for insisting on teaching us long ago.\"  \"We will try our best,\" said Dominick, who thereupon relapsed into silence, wisely resolving to let his sister retain all the \"bliss\" of \"ignorance\" that was possible under the circumstances.  Indeed, there was not much more time for conversation, for the power of the waves was beginning to be felt by the little craft, and the clumsy oar did not act with as much precision or force as was desirable, while Dominick's weakness rendered the steering difficult.  Pauline now began to realise the danger somewhat more clearly from experience, and even Otto showed symptoms of surprise that amounted very nearly to alarm, as the boat at one point made a sudden rush on a wave-top as if it meant to try a race with it, and then as suddenly slipped back into the hollow behind, as if it had been disheartened, feeling that there was no chance.  At last they reached the point of greatest danger.  The huge waves, as we have said, commenced out at sea in long, gentle undulations.  Nearer the shore they advanced in the shape of glassy walls, one after another, like successive lines of indomitable infantry in time of war.  Further in, the tops of these waves began to gurgle and foam, and gather real, instead of seeming, motion, as they rushed towards their fall.  It was here that the boat showed symptoms of becoming unmanageable.  \"Why, the water's beginning to boil!\" exclaimed Otto, in some anxiety.  \"Hold on, boy, and keep quiet,\" said his brother.  As he spoke, the water gurgled up, so that it seemed as if about to pour inboard all round.  At the same time the boat made a rush shoreward as if suddenly endowed with life.  Dominick struggled manfully to keep the stern to the sea.  He succeeded, but in another moment the boat slipped back.  It had not been fairly caught, and the wave passed on to fall with a roar like thunder a hundred yards or so ahead.  \"The next will do it,\" said Dominick, with an anxious glance behind, where a crystal wall was coming grandly on--unnaturally high, it seemed to them, owing to their position in the hollow.  No need to tell Otto now to hold on!  No need to explain difficulty or danger to Pauline!  As her brother stood at the oar, quivering as much from weakness as exertion, she understood it all.  But she was brave, and she could swim.  This latter fact lent her additional confidence. Best of all, she had faith in God, and her spirit was calmed, for, whether life or death lay before her, she knew that her soul was \"safe.\"  As Dominick had prophesied, the next wave took them fairly in its grasp. For a few moments the water hissed and gurgled round them.  The steersman seemed to lose control for a second or two, but quickly recovered.  Then there was a bound, as if the boat had been shot from a catapult, and the billow fell.  A tremendous roar, tumultuous foam all round, increasing speed!  The land appeared to be rushing at them, when Dominick's oar snapped suddenly, and he went overboard.  A shriek from Pauline and a shout from Otto rose high above the din of raging water, as the boat broached-to and hurled its remaining occupants into the sea.  Even in that trying moment Dominick did not lose presence of mind.  He could swim and dive like a water-rat.  Pushing towards his brother and sister, who were heading bravely for the shore, he shouted, \"Dig your fingers and toes deep into the sand, and hold on for life, if--\" (he corrected himself) \"_when_ you gain the beach.\"  It was well they were forewarned, and that they were constitutionally obedient.  A few minutes later, and they were all swept up high on the beach in a wilderness of foam.  The return of that wilderness was like the rushing of a millrace.  Sand, stones, sticks, and seaweed went back with it in dire confusion.  Prone on their knees, with fingers and toes fixed, and heads down, the brothers and sister met the rush.  It was almost too much for them.  A moment more, and strength as well as breath would have failed; but the danger passed, and Dominick sprang to his feet.  \"Up, up! and run!\" he shouted, as he caught Pauline round the waist and dragged her on.  Otto needed no help.  They were barely in time.  The succeeding wave roared after them as if maddened at having lost its prey, and the foaming water was up with them, and almost round their knees, ere its fury was quite spent.  \"Safe!\" exclaimed Dominick.  \"Thank God!\" murmured Pauline, as she sank exhausted on the sand.  Otto, who had never seen his sister in such a state before, ran to her, and, kneeling down, anxiously seized one of her hands.  \"Never fear, lad,\" said his brother in reassuring tones, \"she'll soon come round.  Lend a hand to lift her.\"  They bore the fainting girl up the beach, and laid her on a grassy spot under a bush.  And now Dominick was glad to find that he had been mistaken in supposing that the coral reef was a mere sandbank, destitute of vegetation.  Indeed, before landing, he had observed that there were a few trees on the highest part of it.  He now perceived that there was quite a little grove of cocoa-nut palms, with a thicket of underwood around them, which, if not extensive, was at all events comparatively dense.  He pointed out the fact to Otto, who was chafing his sister's hands.  \"Ay,\" responded Otto, \"and the island on the other side must be a goodish big one, for I got a glimpse of it through the trees as we came rushing in on that monstrous wave.\"  In a short time Pauline recovered, and Dominick returned to the water's edge with Otto.  \"Our first care must be,\" he said, \"to save our little boat if we can, for it is the only means we have of escaping from this island.\"  \"Escaping!\" repeated Otto, in surprise.  \"I don't want to escape from it, Dom.\"  \"Indeed! why not?\"  \"Why, because I've dreamed about being cast on a desolate island hundreds of times, and I've read about Robinson Crusoe, and all the other Crusoes, and I've longed to be cast on one, and now I am cast on one, so I don't want to escape.  It'll be the greatest fun in the world. I only hope I won't wake up, as usual, to find that it's all a dream!\"  Dominick laughed (not scornfully, by any means) at the boy's enthusiasm; nevertheless he had strong sympathy with him, for the period had not passed so long ago when he himself entertained a very vivid impression of the romance of such a situation, and he did not trouble his mind about the stern realities.  \"I sincerely hope it may come up to your expectations, Otto, my boy; nevertheless we must secure the boat for fishing purposes, even though we don't try to escape in it.\"  \"For fishing! why, we have neither hooks nor lines.\"  \"True, lad; but we have got fingers and brains.  It strikes me that we shall have occasion to use all our powers and possessions if we are not to starve here, for the reef seems to have very little vegetation on it, and there is sure to be a lagoon of water on the other side, separating it from the island beyond.\"  \"I wonder if there is fresh water on the reef,\" said Otto, with a very sudden look of solemnity and pursing of the mouth.  \"You may well ask that.  I hope there is.  We will go and settle the point the moment we have secured the boat, if--\"  He stopped, for he saw at that moment that the sea had taken good care to secure the boat to itself as a plaything.  Having dashed it into small pieces, it was by that time busily engaged in tossing these about among the foam, now hurling the splinters high upon the shore, anon sending up long watery tongues to lick them back, and then casting them under the incoming rollers, to be further reduced into what is usually styled matchwood.  There was a small bay close at hand, where the sandy beach was strewn with rocks, in which the sea appeared to play this game with unusual vigour.  It was a sort of hospital for marine incurables, into which the sea cast its broken toys when tired of smashing them up, and left them there to rot.  Regarding this spot with a thoughtful look, Dominick remarked that the wreck which lay on the rocks off the tail of the island was by no means the first that had taken place there.  \"And won't be the last, I fancy,\" said Otto.  \"Probably not.  Indeed, from the appearance of this bay,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21742"],["title","Jarwin and Cuffy (#1)"],["body"," condition, he was utterly incapable of contending with such a surf.  Being a man of promptitude, his first act, on making this discovery, was to lower the sail.  This was, fortunately, done in time; had he kept it up a few minutes longer, he must inevitably have passed the only opening in the reef that existed on that side of the island.  This opening was not more than fifty yards wide.  To the right and left of it the breakers on the reef extended, in lines of seething foam.  Already the raft was rolling in the commotion caused by these breakers, as it drifted towards the opening.  Jarwin was by no means devoid of courage.  Many a time, in days gone by, when his good ship was tossing on the stormy sea, or scudding under bare poles, had he stood on the deck with unshaken confidence and a calm heart, but now he was face to face with the seaman's most dreaded enemy--\"breakers ahead!\"--nay, worse, breakers around him everywhere, save at that one narrow passage, which appeared so small, and so involved in the general turmoil, as to afford scarcely an element of hope.  For the first time in his life Jarwin's heart sank within him--at least so he said in after years while talking of the event--but we suspect that John was underrating himself.  At all events, he showed no symptoms of fear as he sat there calmly awaiting his fate.  As the raft approached the reef, each successive roller lifted it up and dropped it behind more violently, until at last the top of one of the glittering green walls broke just as it passed under the end of the raft nearest the shore.  Jarwin now knew that the next billow would seal his fate.  There was a wide space between each of those mighty waves.  He looked out to sea, and beheld the swell rising and taking form, and increasing in speed as it came on.  Calmly divesting himself of his coat and boots, he sat down beside his dog, and awaited the event.  At that moment he observed, with intense gratitude to the Almighty, that the raft was drifting so straight towards the middle of the channel in the reef, that there seemed every probability of being carried through it; but the hope thus raised was somewhat chilled by the feeling of weakness which pervaded his frame.  \"Now, Cuffy,\" said he, patting the terrier gently, \"rouse up, my doggie; we must make a brave struggle for life.  It's neck or nothing this time. If we touch that reef in passing, Cuff, you an' I shall be food for the sharks to-night, an' it's my opinion that the shark as gits us won't have much occasion to boast of his supper.\"  The sailor ceased speaking abruptly.  As he looked back at the approaching roller he felt solemnised and somewhat alarmed, for it appeared so perpendicular and so high from his low position, that it seemed as if it would fall on and overwhelm the raft.  There was, indeed, some danger of this.  Glancing along its length, Jarwin saw that here and there the edge was lipping over, while in one place, not far off, the thunder of its fall had already begun.  Another moment, and it appeared to hang over his head; the raft was violently lifted at the stern, caught up, and whirled onward at railway speed, like a cork in the midst of a boiling cauldron of foam.  The roar was deafening.  The tumultuous heaving almost overturned it several times.  Jarwin held on firmly to the mast with his right arm, and grasped the terrier with his left hand, for the poor creature had not strength to resist such furious motion.  It all passed with bewildering speed.  It seemed as if, in one instant, the raft was hurled through the narrows, and launched into the calm harbour within.  An eddy, at the inner side of the opening, swept it round, and fixed the end of one of the largest spars of which it was composed on the beach.  There were fifty yards or so of sandy coral-reef between the beach outside, that faced the sea, and the beach inside, which faced the land; yet how great the difference!  The one beach, buffeted for ever, day and night, by the breakers--in calm by the grand successive rollers that, as it were, symbolised the ocean's latent power--in storm by the mad deluge of billows which displayed that power in all its terrible grandeur.  The other beach, a smooth, sloping circlet of fair white sand, laved only by the ripples of the lagoon, or by its tiny wavelets, when a gale chanced to sweep over it from the land.  Jarwin soon gained this latter beach with Cuffy in his arms, and sat down to rest, for his strength had been so much reduced that the mere excitement of passing through the reef had almost exhausted him.  Cuffy, however, seemed to derive new life from the touch of earth again, for it ran about in a staggering drunken sort of way; wagged its tail at the root,--without, however, being able to influence the point,--and made numerous futile efforts to bark.  In the midst of its weakly gambols the terrier chanced to discover a dead fish on the sands.  Instantly it darted forward and began to devour it with great voracity.  \"Halo!  Cuffy,\" shouted Jarwin, who observed him; \"ho! hold on, you rascal! share and share alike, you know.  Here, fetch it here!\"  Cuffy had learned the first great principle of a good and useful life-- whether of man or beast--namely, prompt obedience.  That meek but jovial little dog, on receiving this order, restrained its appetite, lifted the fish in its longing jaws, and, carrying it to his master, humbly laid it at his feet.  He was rewarded with a hearty pat on the head, and a full half of the coveted fish--for Jarwin appeared to regard the \"share-and-share-alike\" principle as a point of honour between them.  The fish was not good, neither was it large, and of course it was raw, besides being somewhat decayed; nevertheless, both man and dog ate it, bones and all, with quiet satisfaction.  Nay, reader, do not shudder! If you were reduced to similar straits, you would certainly enjoy, with equal gusto, a similar meal, supposing that you had the good fortune to get it.  Small though it was, it sufficed to appease the appetite of the two friends, and to give them a feeling of strength which they had not experienced for many a day.  Under the influence of this feeling, Jarwin remarked to Cuffy, that \"a man could eat a-most anything when hard put to it,\" and that \"it wos now high time to think about goin' ashore.\"  To which Cuffy replied with a bark, which one might imagine should come from a dog in the last stage of whooping-cough, and with a wag of his tail--not merely at the root thereof, but a distinct wag--that extended obviously along its entire length to the extreme point.  Jarwin observed the successful effort, laughed feebly, and said, \"Brayvo, Cuffy,\" with evident delight; for it reminded him of the days when that little shred of a door-mat, in the might of its vigour, was wont to wag its tail so violently as to convulse its whole body, insomuch that it was difficult to decide whether the tail wagged the body, or the body the tail!  But, although Jarwin made light of his sufferings, his gaunt, wasted frame would have been a sad sight to any pitiful spectator, as with weary aspect and unsteady gait he moved about on the sandy ridge in search of more food, or gazed with longing eyes on the richly-wooded island.  For it must be remembered that our castaway had not landed on the island itself, but on that narrow ring of coral-reef which almost encircled it, and from which it was separated by the lagoon, or enclosed portion of the sea, which was, as we have said, about a quarter of a mile wide.  John Jarwin would have thought little of swimming over that narrow belt of smooth water in ordinary circumstances, but now he felt that his strength was not equal to such a feat.  Moreover, he knew that there were sharks in these waters, so he dismissed the idea of swimming, and cast about in his mind how he should manage to get across.  With Jarwin, action soon followed thought.  He resolved to form a small raft out of portions of the large one.  Fortunately his clasp-knife had been attached, as seamen frequently have it, to his waist-belt, when he forsook his ship.  This was the only implement that he possessed, but it was invaluable.  With it he managed to cut the thick ropes that he could not have untied, and, in the course of two hours--for he laboured with extreme difficulty--a few broken planks and spars were lashed together. Embarking on this frail vessel with his dog, he pushed off, and using a piece of plank for an oar, sculled himself over the lagoon.  It was touching, even to himself, to observe the slowness of his progress.  All the strength that remained in him was barely sufficient to move the raft.  But the lagoon was as still as a mill-pond.  Looking down into its clear depths, he could see the rich gardens of coral and sea-weed, among which fish, of varied and brilliant colours, sported many fathoms below.  The air, too, was perfectly calm.  Very slowly he left the reef astern; the middle of the lagoon was gained; then, gradually, he neared the island-shore, but oh! it was a long, weary pull, although the space was so short, and, to add to the poor man's misery, the fish which he had eaten caused him intolerable thirst.  But he reached the shore at last.  The first thing that greeted his eye as he landed was the sparkle of a clear spring at the foot of some cocoanut-trees.  He staggered eagerly towards it, and fell down beside a hollow in the rock, like a large cup or bowl, which had been scooped out by it.  Who shall presume to describe the feelings of that shipwrecked sailor as he and his dog drank from the same cup at that sparkling crystal fountain?  Delicious odours of lime and citron trees, and well-nigh forgotten herbage, filled his nostrils, and the twitter of birds thrilled his ears, seeming to bid him welcome to the land, as he sank down on the soft grass, and raised his eyes in thanksgiving to heaven. An irresistible tendency to sleep then seized him.  \"If there's a "]]]
