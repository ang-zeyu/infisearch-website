But, in the vicinity of the gate of Benjamin, the       wall arose by no means from the margin of the fosse. On the contrary,       between the level of the ditch and the basement of the rampart sprang up a       perpendicular cliff of two hundred and fifty cubits, forming part of the       precipitous Mount Moriah. So that when Simeon and his associates arrived       on the summit of the tower called Adoni-Bezek—the loftiest of all the       turrets around about Jerusalem, and the usual place of conference with the       besieging army—they looked down upon the camp of the enemy from an       eminence excelling by many feet that of the Pyramid of Cheops, and, by       several, that of the temple of Belus.            “Verily,” sighed the Pharisee, as he peered dizzily over the precipice,       “the uncircumcised are as the sands by the seashore—as the locusts in the       wilderness! The valley of the King hath become the valley of Adommin.”                  “And yet,” added Ben-Levi, “thou canst not point me out a Philistine—no,       not one—from Aleph to Tau—from the wilderness to the battlements—who       seemeth any bigger than the letter Jod!”                  “Lower away the basket with the shekels of silver!” here shouted a Roman       soldier in a hoarse, rough voice, which appeared to issue from the regions       of Pluto—“lower away the basket with the accursed coin which it has       broken the jaw of a noble Roman to pronounce! Is it thus you evince your       gratitude to our master Pompeius, who, in his condescension, has thought       fit to listen to your idolatrous importunities? The god Phœbus, who is a       true god, has been charioted for an hour—and were you not to be on the       ramparts by sunrise? Ædepol! do you think that we, the conquerors of the       world, have nothing better to do than stand waiting by the walls of every       kennel, to traffic with the dogs of the earth? Lower away! I say—and       see that your trumpery be bright in color and just in weight!”                  “El Elohim!” ejaculated the Pharisee, as the discordant tones of the       centurion rattled up the crags of the precipice, and fainted away against       the temple—“El Elohim!—who is the god Phœbus?—whom doth       the blasphemer invoke? Thou, Buzi-Ben-Levi! who art read in the laws of       the Gentiles, and hast sojourned among them who dabble with the Teraphim!—is       it Nergal of whom the idolater speaketh?—or Ashimah?—or       Nibhaz,—or Tartak?—or Adramalech?—or Anamalech?—or       Succoth-Benith?—or Dagon?—or Belial?—or Baal-Perith?—or       Baal-Peor?—or Baal-Zebub?”                  “Verily it is neither—but beware how thou lettest the rope slip too       rapidly through thy fingers; for should the wicker-work chance to hang on       the projection of yonder crag, there will be a woful outpouring of the       holy things of the sanctuary.”                  By the assistance of some rudely constructed machinery, the heavily laden       basket was now carefully lowered down among the multitude; and, from the       giddy pinnacle, the Romans were seen gathering confusedly round it; but       owing to the vast height and the prevalence of a fog, no distinct view of       their operations could be obtained.            Half an hour had already elapsed.            “We shall be too late!” sighed the Pharisee, as at the expiration of this       period he looked over into the abyss—“we shall be too late! we shall be       turned out of office by the Katholim.”                  “No more,” responded Abel-Phittim—“no more shall we feast upon the       fat of the land—no longer shall our beards be odorous with frankincense—our       loins girded up with fine linen from the Temple.”                  “Raca!” swore Ben-Levi, “Raca! do they mean to defraud us of the purchase       money? or, Holy Moses! are they weighing the shekels of the tabernacle?”                  “They have given the signal at last!” cried the Pharisee—“they       have given the signal at last! pull away, Abel-Phittim!—and thou,       Buzi-Ben-Levi, pull away!—for verily the Philistines have either       still hold upon the basket, or the Lord hath softened their hearts to       place therein a beast of good weight!” And the Gizbarim pulled away, while       their burden swung heavily upward through the still increasing mist.                   “Booshoh he!”—as, at the conclusion of an hour, some object at the       extremity of the rope became indistinctly visible—“Booshoh he!” was       the exclamation which burst from the lips of Ben-Levi.            “Booshoh he!—for shame!—it is a ram from the thickets of       Engedi, and as rugged as the valley of Jehosaphat!”                  “It is a firstling of the flock,” said Abel-Phittim, “I know him by the       bleating of his lips, and the innocent folding of his limbs. His eyes are       more beautiful than the jewels of the Pectoral, and his flesh is like the       honey of Hebron.”                  “It is a fatted calf from the pastures of Bashan,” said the Pharisee, “the       heathen have dealt wonderfully with us——let us raise up our       voices in a psalm—let us give thanks on the shawm and on the       psaltery—on the harp and on the huggab—on the cythern and on the sackbut!”                  It was not until the basket had arrived within a few feet of the Gizbarim       that a low grunt betrayed to their perception a _hog_ of no common size.            “Now El Emanu!” slowly and with upturned eyes ejaculated the trio, as,       letting go their hold, the emancipated porker tumbled headlong among the       Philistines, “El Emanu!—God be with us—it is _the unutterable       flesh!”_     THE SPHINX         During the dread reign of the cholera in New York, I had accepted the       invitation of a relative to spend a fortnight with him in the retirement       of his _cottage ornée_ on the banks of the Hudson. We had here around       us all the ordinary means of summer amusement; and what with rambling in       the woods, sketching, boating, fishing, bathing, music, and books, we       should have passed the time pleasantly enough, but for the fearful       intelligence which reached us every morning from the populous city. Not a       day elapsed which did not bring us news of the decease of some       acquaintance. Then as the fatality increased, we learned to expect daily       the loss of some friend. At length we trembled at the approach of every       messenger. The very air from the South seemed to us redolent with death.       That palsying thought, indeed, took entire possession of my soul. I could       neither speak, think, nor dream of any thing else. My host was of a less       excitable temperament, and, although greatly depressed in spirits, exerted       himself to sustain my own. His richly philosophical intellect was not at       any time affected by unrealities. To the substances of terror he was       sufficiently alive, but of its shadows he had no apprehension.            His endeavors to arouse me from the condition of abnormal gloom into which       I had fallen, were frustrated, in great measure, by certain volumes which       I had found in his library. These were of a character to force into       germination whatever seeds of hereditary superstition lay latent in my       bosom. I had been reading these books without his knowledge, and thus he       was often at a loss to account for the forcible impressions which had been       made upon my fancy.            A favorite topic with me was the popular belief in omens—a belief       which, at this one epoch of my life, I was almost seriously disposed to       defend. On this subject we had long and animated discussions—he       maintaining the utter groundlessness of faith in such matters,—I       contending that a popular sentiment arising with absolute       spontaneity—that is to say, without apparent traces of       suggestion—had in itself the unmistakable elements of truth, and       was entitled to as much respect as that intuition which is the       idiosyncrasy of the individual man of genius.            The fact is, that soon after my arrival at the cottage there had occurred       to myself an incident so entirely inexplicable, and which had in it so       much of the portentous character, that I might well have been excused for       regarding it as an omen. It appalled, and at the same time so confounded       and bewildered me, that many days elapsed before I could make up my mind       to communicate the circumstances to my friend.            Near the close of exceedingly warm day, I was sitting, book in hand, at an       open window, commanding, through a long vista of the river banks, a view       of a distant hill, the face of which nearest my position had been denuded       by what is termed a land-slide, of the principal portion of its trees. My       thoughts had been long wandering from the volume before me to the gloom       and desolation of the neighboring city. Uplifting my eyes from the page,       they fell upon the naked face of the bill, and upon an object—upon       some living monster of hideous conformation, which very rapidly made its       way from the summit to the bottom, disappearing finally in the dense       forest below. As this creature first came in sight, I doubted my own       sanity—or at least the evidence of my own eyes; and many minutes       passed before I succeeded in convincing myself that I was neither mad nor       in a dream. Yet when I described the monster (which I distinctly saw, and       calmly surveyed through the whole period of its progress), my readers, I       fear, will feel more difficulty in being convinced of these points than       even I did myself.

That means you're a pretty important person, Trigger! Mantelish, for all his idiosyncrasies, is undoubtedly the greatest living biologist in the League. And the Plasmoid Project here at the school is without question the League's most important current undertaking.\"  \"So I've been told,\" said Trigger. \"That's why I want to find out what's gone haywire with it.\"  \"In a moment,\" Plemponi said. \"In a moment.\" He located his napkin, wiped his lips carefully. \"Now I've mentioned all this simply to make it very, very clear that we'll do anything we can to keep you satisfied. We're delighted to have you with us. We are honored!\" He beamed at her. \"Right?\"  Trigger smiled. \"If you say so. And thanks very much for all the lovely compliments, Doctor. But now let's get down to business.\"  Plemponi glanced over at Mihul and looked evasive. \"That being?\" he asked.  \"You know,\" Trigger said. \"But I'll put it into specific questions if you like. Where's Commissioner Tate?\"  \"I don't know.\"  \"Where is Mantelish?\"  He shook his head. \"I don't know that either.\" He began to look unhappy.  \"Oh?\" said Trigger. \"Who does know then?\"  \"I'm not allowed to tell you,\" Doctor Plemponi said firmly.  Trigger raised an eyebrow. \"Why not?\"  \"Federation security,\" Plemponi said, frowning. He added, \"I wasn't supposed to tell you that either, but what could I do?\"  \"Federation security? Because of the plasmoids?\"  \"Yes.... Well.... I'd--I don't know.\"  Trigger sighed. \"Is it just me you're not supposed to tell these things to?\"  \"No, no, no,\" Plemponi said hastily. \"Nobody. I'm not supposed to admit to anyone that I know anything of the whereabouts of Holati Tate or Professor Mantelish.\"  \"Fibber!\" Trigger said quietly. \"So you know!\"  Plemponi looked appealingly at Mihul. She was grinning. \"My lips are sealed, Trigger! I can't help it. Please believe me.\"  \"Let _me_ sum it up then,\" Trigger said, tapping the arm of her chair with a finger tip. \"Eight weeks ago I get pulled off my job in the Manon System and sent here to arrange the organizational details of this Plasmoid Project. The only reason I took on the job, as a temporary assignment, was that Commissioner Tate convinced me it was important to him to have me do it. I even let him talk me into doing it under the assumed name of Ruya Farn and\"--she reached up and touched the side of her head--\"and to dye my hair. For no sane reason that I could discover! He said the U-League had requested it.\"  Doctor Plemponi coughed. \"Well, you know, Trigger, how sensitive the League is to personal notoriety.\"  The eyebrow went up again. \"Notoriety?\"  \"Not in the wrong sense!\" Plemponi said hastily. \"But your name _has_ become much more widely known than you may believe. The news viewers mentioned you regularly in their reports on Harvest Moon and the Commissioner. Didn't they, Mihul?\"  Mihul nodded. \"You made good copy, kid! We saw you in the solidopics any number of times.\"  \"Well, maybe,\" Trigger said. \"The cloak and dagger touches still don't make much sense to me. But let's forget them and go on.  \"When we get here, I manage to see Mantelish just once to try to find out what his requirements will be. He's pretty vague about them. Commissioner Tate is in and out of the Project--usually out. He's also turned pretty vague. About everything. Three weeks ago today I'm told he's gone. Nobody here can, or will, tell me where he's gone or how he can be contacted. The same thing in the Maccadon Precol office. Same thing at the Evalee Home office. Same thing at the U-League--any office. Then I try to contact Mantelish. I'm informed he's with Tate! The two of them have left word I'm to carry on.\"  She spread her hands. \"Carry on with what? I've done all I can do until I get further instructions from the people supposedly directing this supposedly very urgent and important project! Mantelish doesn't even seem to have a second in command....\"  Plemponi nodded. \"I was told he hadn't selected his Project assistants yet.\"  \"Except,\" said Trigger, \"for that little flock of Junior Scientists who keep themselves locked in with the plasmoids. They know less than nothing and would be too scared to tell me that if I asked them.\"  Plemponi looked confused for a moment. \"The last sentence--\" He checked himself. \"Well, let's not quibble. Go on.\"  Trigger said, \"That's it. Holati didn't need me on this job to begin with. There's nothing involved about the organizational aspects. Unless something begins to happen--and rather soon--there's no excuse for me to stay here.\"  \"Couldn't you,\" Plemponi suggested, \"regard this as a kind of well-earned little vacation?\"  \"I've tried to regard it as that. Holati impressed on me that one of us had to remain in the area of the Project at all times, so I haven't even been able to leave the school grounds. I've caught up with my reading, and Mihul has put me through two of her tune-up commando courses. But the point is that I'm not on vacation. I don't believe Precol would feel that any of my present activities come under the heading of detached duty work!\"  There was a short silence. Plemponi stared down at his empty tray, said, \"Excuse me,\" got up and walked over to the wall chef with the tray.  \"Wrong slot,\" Trigger told him.  He looked back. \"Eh?\"  \"You want to put it in the disposal, don't you?\"  \"Thanks,\" Plemponi said absently. \"Always doing that. Confusing them....\" He dropped the tray where it belonged, shoved his hands into the chef's cleaning recess and waved them around, then came back, still looking absent-minded, and stopped before Trigger's chair. He studied her face for a moment.  \"Commissioner Tate gave me a message for you,\" he said suddenly.  Trigger's eyes narrowed slightly. \"When?\"  \"The day after he left.\" Plemponi lifted a hand. \"Now wait! You'll see how it was. He called in and said, and I quote, 'Plemp, you don't stand much of a chance at keeping secrets from Trigger, so I'll give you no unnecessary secrets to keep. If this business we're on won't let us get back to the Project in the next couple of weeks, she'll get mighty restless. When she starts to complain--but no earlier--just tell her there are reasons why I can't contact her at present, or let her know what I'm doing, and that I _will_ contact her as soon as I possibly can.' End of quote.\"  \"That was all?\" asked Trigger.  \"Yes.\"  \"He didn't say a thing about how long this situation might continue?\"  \"No. I've given you the message word for word. My memory is excellent, Trigger.\"  \"So it could be more weeks? Or months?\"  \"Yes. Possibly. I imagine....\" Plemponi had begun to perspire.  \"Plemp,\" said Trigger, \"will you give Holati a message from me?\"  \"Gladly!\" said Plemponi. \"What--oh, oh!\" He flushed.  \"Right,\" said Trigger. \"You can contact him. I thought so.\"  Doctor Plemponi looked reproachful. \"That was unfair, Trigger! You're quick-witted.\"  Trigger shrugged. \"I can't see any justification for all this mystery, that's all.\" She stood up. \"Anyway, here's the message. Tell him that unless somebody--rather promptly--gives me a good sane reason for hanging around here, I'll ask Precol to transfer me back to the Manon job.\"  Plemponi tut-tutted gloomily. \"Trigger,\" he said, \"I'll do my best about the message. But otherwise--\"  She smiled nicely at him. \"I know,\" she said, \"your lips are sealed. Sorry if I've disturbed you, Plemp. But I'm just a Precol employee, after all. If I'm to waste their time, I'd like to know at least why it's necessary.\"  Plemponi watched her walk out of the room and off down the adjoining hall. In his face consternation struggled with approval.  \"Lovely little figure, hasn't she?\" he said to Mihul. He made vague curving motions in the air with one hand, more or less opposing ones with the other. \"That sort of an up-and-sideways lilt when she walks.\"  \"Uh-huh,\" said Mihul. \"Old goats.\"  \"Eh?\" said Doctor Plemponi.  \"I overheard you discussing Trigger's lilt with Mantelish.\"  Plemponi sat down at his desk. \"You shouldn't eavesdrop, Mihul,\" he said severely. \"I'd better get that message promptly to Tate, I suppose. She meant what she said, don't you think?\"  \"Every bit of it,\" said Mihul.  \"Tate warned me she might get very difficult about this time. She's too conscientious, I feel.\"  \"She also,\" said Mihul, \"has a boy friend in the Manon System. They've been palsy ever since they went through the school here together.\"  \"Ought to get married then,\" Plemponi said. He shuddered. \"My blood runs cold every time I think of how close those grabbers got to her yesterday!\"  Mihul shrugged. \"Relax! They never had a chance. The characters Tate has guarding her are the fastest-moving squad I ever saw go into action.\"  \"That,\" Plemponi said reflectively, \"doesn't sound much like our Maccadon police.\"  \"I don't think they are. Imported talent of some kind, for my money. Anyway, if someone wants to pick up Trigger Argee here, he'd better come in with a battleship.\"  Plemponi glanced nervously across the balcony at the cloudless blue sky about the quadrangle.  \"The impression I got from Holati Tate,\" he said, \"is that somebody might.\"     2   There was a tube portal at the end of the hall outside Doctor Plemponi's office. Mihul stepped into the portal, punched the number of her personal quarters, waited till the overhead light flashed green a few seconds later, and stepped out into another hall seventeen floors below Plemponi's office and a little over a mile and a half away from it.  Mihul crossed the hall, went into her apartment, locked the door behind her and punched a shield button. In her bedroom, she opened a wall safe and swung out a high-powered transmitter. She switched the transmitter to active.  \"Yes?\" said a voice.  \"Mihul here,\" said Mihul. \"Quillan or the Commissioner....\"  \"Quill"]]]
