An Englishman is like a bull-dog.  He won't suffer himself to be seized by the throat and choked if he can help it!\"  The Turk, who was evidently a renegade Briton, made no reply whatever to this address; but, after casting the lashings loose, returned to his former occupation.  Foster proceeded to thank the captain for his courtesy and make him acquainted with the state of his appetite, but he was evidently not in a conversational frame of mind.  Before a few words had been spoken the captain stopped him, and, pointing down the skylight, said, sharply--  \"Brukfust!  Go!\"  Both look and tone admonished our hero to obey.  He descended to the cabin, therefore, without finishing his sentence, and there discovered that \"brukfust\" consisted of two sea-biscuits and a mug of water.  To these dainties he applied himself with infinite relish, for he had always been Spartan-like as to the quality of his food, and hunger makes almost any kind of dish agreeable.  While thus engaged he heard a hurried trampling of feet on deck, mingled with sharp orders from the captain.  At first he thought the sounds might have reference to taking in a reef to prepare for a squall, but as the noise rather increased, his curiosity was roused, and he was about to return on deck when Peter the Great suddenly leaped into the cabin and took hurriedly from the opposite locker a brace of highly ornamented pistols and a scimitar.  \"What's wrong, Peter?\" asked Foster, starting up.  \"We's a-goin' to fight!\" groaned the negro.  \"Oh!  I's a awrful hyperkrite!  You stop where you am, massa, else you'll get whacked.\"  Despite the risk of being \"whacked,\" the youth would have followed the negro on deck, had not the hatch been slammed in his face and secured. Next moment he heard a volley of musketry on deck.  It was instantly replied to by a distant volley, and immediately thereafter groans and curses showed that the firing had not been without effect.  That the pirate had engaged a vessel of some sort was evident, and our hero, being naturally anxious to see if not to share in the fight, tried hard to get out of his prison, but without success.  He was obliged, therefore, to sit there inactive and listen to the wild confusion overhead.  At last there came a crash, followed by fiercer shouts and cries.  He knew that the vessels had met and that the pirates were boarding.  In a few minutes comparative silence ensued, broken only by occasional footsteps and the groaning of the wounded.    CHAPTER TWO.  AMONG PIRATES--ENSLAVED.  When George Foster was again permitted to go on deck the sight that he beheld was not calculated to comfort him in his misfortunes.  Several Moorish seamen were going about with bared legs and arms, swishing water on the decks and swabbing up the blood, with which they were bespattered.  Most of these men were more or less wounded and bandaged, for the crew of the merchantman they had attacked had offered a desperate resistance, knowing well the fate in store for them if captured.  The said merchantman, a large brig, sailed close alongside of the pirate vessel with a prize crew on board.  Her own men, who were Russians, had been put in chains in the fore part of their vessel under the forecastle, so as to be out of sight.  Her officers and several passengers had been removed to the pirate's quarter-deck.  Among them were an old gentleman of dignified bearing, and an elderly lady who seemed to be supported, physically as well as mentally, by a tall, dark-complexioned, noble-looking girl, who was evidently the daughter of the old gentleman, though whether also the daughter of the elderly lady young Foster could not discover, there being little or no resemblance between them.  The memory of his mother and sister strongly inclined the sympathetic midshipman to approach the party and offer words of consolation to the ladies.  As he advanced to them for that purpose, a doubt as to which language he should use assailed him.  French, he knew, was the language most likely to be understood, but a girl with such magnificent black eyes must certainly be Spanish!  His knowledge of Spanish was about equal to that of an ill-trained parrot, but what of that?  Was he not a Briton, whose chief characteristic is to go in for anything and stick at nothing?  We do not venture to write down what he said, but when he had said it the blank look of the elderly lady and the peculiar look of the girl induced him to repeat the speech in his broken--his very much broken-- French, whereupon the old gentleman turned to him gravely and said--  \"My vife is Engleesh, an' my datter is Danish--no, not joost--vell, she is 'af-an'-'af.  Speak to dem in your nattif tong.\"  \"_You_ are not English, anyhow, old boy,\" thought Foster, as he turned with a mingled feeling of confusion and recklessness to the elderly lady.  \"Pardon me, madam,\" he said, \"but from the appearance of--of--your--\"  He was interrupted at this point by the captain, who, flushed and blood-bespattered from the recent fight, came aft with a drawn scimitar in his hand, and sternly ordered the young midshipman to go forward.  It was a humiliating position to be placed in; yet, despite the \"stick-at-nothing\" spirit, he felt constrained to obey, but did so, nevertheless, with an air of defiant ferocity which relieved his feelings to some extent.  The said feelings were utterly ignored by the pirate captain, who did not condescend even to look at him after the first glance, but turned to the other captives and ordered them, in rather less stern tones, to \"go below,\" an order which was promptly obeyed.  On reaching the fore part of the vessel, Foster found several of the crew engaged in bandaging each other's wounds, and, from the clumsy way in which they went to work, it was very clear that they were much more accustomed to inflict wounds than to bandage them.  Now it must be told that, although George Foster was not a surgeon, he had an elder brother who was, and with whom he had associated constantly while he was studying and practising for his degree; hence he became acquainted with many useful facts and modes of action connected with the healing art, of which the world at large is ignorant.  Perceiving that one of the pirates was bungling a very simple operation, he stepped forward, and, with that assurance which results naturally from the combination of conscious power and \"cheek,\" took up the dressing of the wound.  At first the men seemed inclined to resent the interference, but when they saw that the \"Christian\" knew what he was about, and observed how well and swiftly he did the work, they stood aside and calmly submitted.  Foster was interrupted, however, in the midst of his philanthropic work by Peter the Great, who came forward and touched him on the shoulder.  \"Sorry to 't'rupt you, sar, but you come wid me.\"  \"Mayn't I finish this operation first?\" said Foster, looking up.  \"No, sar.  My orders is prumptory.\"  Our amateur surgeon dropped the bandage indignantly and followed the negro, who led him down into the hold, at the further and dark end of which he saw several wounded men lying, and beside them one or two whose motionless and straightened figures seemed to indicate that death had relieved them from earthly troubles.  Amongst these men he spent the night and all next day, with only a couple of biscuits and a mug of water to sustain him.  Next evening Peter the Great came down and bade him follow him to the other end of the hold.  \"Now, sar, you go in dere,\" said the negro, stopping and pointing to a small door in the bulkhead, inside of which was profound darkness.  Foster hesitated and looked at his big conductor.  \"'Bey orders, sar!\" said the negro, in a loud, stern voice of command. Then, stooping as if to open the little door, he added, in a low voice, \"Don' be a fool, massa.  _Submit_!  Das de word, if you don' want a whackin'.  It's a friend advises you.  Dere's one oder prisoner dere, but he's wounded, an' won't hurt you.  _Go_ in! won't you?\"  Peter the Great accompanied the last words with a violent thrust that sent the hapless middy headlong into the dark hole, but as he closed and fastened the door he muttered, \"Don' mind my leetle ways, massa.  You know I's bound to be a hyperkrite.\"  Having thus relieved his conscience, Peter returned to the deck, leaving the poor prisoner to rise and, as a first consequence, to hit his head on the beams above him.  The hole into which he had been thrust was truly a \"black hole,\" though neither so hot nor so deadly as that of Calcutta.  Extending his arms cautiously, he touched the side of the ship with his left hand; with the other he felt about for some time, but reached nothing until he had advanced a step, when his foot touched something on the floor, and he bent down to feel it, but shrank hastily back on touching what he perceived at once was a human form.  \"Pardon me, friend, whoever you are,\" he said quickly, \"I did not mean to--I did not know--are you badly hurt?\"  But no reply came from the wounded man--not even a groan.  A vague suspicion crossed Foster's mind.  The man might be dying of his wounds.  He spoke to him again in French and Spanish, but still got no reply!  Then he listened intently for his breathing, but all was as silent as the tomb.  With an irresistible impulse, yet instinctive shudder, he laid his"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21752"],["title","My Doggie and I (#1)"],["body","that shaggy creature cocked its ears and turned its head from side to side slowly, and gazed with its lustrous eyes while I was speaking, went far to convince me it really did understand what I said.  Of course it only wagged its rear tuft of hair in reply, and whimpered slightly.  Refer to its rear tuft advisedly, because, at a short distance, my doggie, when in repose, resembled an elongated and shapeless mass; but, when roused by a call or otherwise, three tufts of hair instantly sprang up--two at one end, and one at the other end--indicating his ears and tail.  It was only by these signs that I could ascertain at any time his exact position.  I was about to continue my remarks to Dumps when the door opened and my landlady appeared bearing the dinner tray.  \"Oh!  I beg parding, sir,\" she said, drawing back, \"I didn't 'ear your voice, sir, till the door was open, an' I thought you was alone, but I can come back a--\"  \"Come in, Mrs Miff.  There is nobody here but my little dog--one that I have just bought, a rather shaggy terrier--what do you think of him?\"  \"Do 'e bite, sir?\" inquired Mrs Miff, in some anxiety, as she passed round the table at a respectful distance from Dumps.  \"I think not.  He seems an amiable creature,\" said I, patting his head. \"Do you ever bite, Dumps?\"  \"Well, sir, I never feel quite easy,\" rejoined Mrs Miff in a doubtful tone, as she laid my cloth, with, as it were, one eye ever on the alert: \"you never knows w'en these 'airy creatures is goin' to fly at you.  If you could see their heyes you might 'ave a guess what they was a thinkin' of; an' then it is so orkard not knowin' w'ich end of the 'airy bundle is the bitin' end, you can't help bein' nervish a little.\"  Having finished laying the cloth, Mrs Miff backed out of the room after the manner of attendants on royalty, overturning two chairs with her skirts as she went, and showing her full front to the enemy.  But the enemy gave no sign, good or bad.  All the tufts were down flat, and he stood motionless while Mrs Miff retreated.  \"Dumps, what do you think of Mrs Miff?\"  The doggie ran to me at once, and we engaged in a little further conversation until my landlady returned with the viands.  To my surprise Dumps at once walked sedately to the hearth-rug, and lay down thereon, with his chin on his paws--at least I judged so from the attitude, for I could see neither chin nor paws.  This act I regarded as another evidence of good breeding.  He was not a beggar, and, therefore, could not have spent his childhood with the man from whom I had bought him.  \"I wish you could speak, Dumps,\" said I, laying down my knife and fork, when about half finished, and looking towards the hearth-rug.  One end of him rose a little, the other end wagged gently, but as I made no further remark, both ends subsided.  \"Now, Dumps,\" said I, finishing my meal with a draught of water, which is my favourite beverage, \"you must not suppose that you have got a greedy master; though I don't allow begging.  There, sir, is your corner, where you shall always have the remnants of my dinner--come.\"  The dog did not move until I said, \"come.\"  Then, with a quick rush he made for the plate, and very soon cleared it.  \"Well, you have been well trained,\" said I, regarding him with interest; \"such conduct is neither the result of instinct nor accident, and sure am I, the more I think of it, that the sulky fellow who sold you to me was not your tutor; but, as you can't speak, I shall never find out your history, so, Dumps, I'll dismiss the subject.\"  Saying this, I sat down to the newspaper with which I invariably solaced myself for half an hour after dinner, before going out on my afternoon rounds.  This was the manner in which my doggie and I began our acquaintance, and I have been thus particular in recounting the details, because they bear in a special manner on some of the most important events of my life.  Being, as already mentioned, a medical student, and having almost completed my course of study, I had undertaken to visit in one of the poorest districts in London--in the neighbourhood of Whitechapel; partly for the purpose of gaining experience in my profession, and partly for the sake of carrying the Word of Life--the knowledge of the Saviour-- into some of the many homes where moral as well as physical disease is rife.  Leanings and inclinations are inherited not less than bodily peculiarities.  My father had a particular tenderness for poor old women of the lowest class.  So have I.  When I see a bowed, aged, wrinkled, white-haired, feeble woman in rags and dirt, a gush of tender pity almost irresistibly inclines me to go and pat her head, sit down beside her, comfort her, and give her money.  It matters not what her antecedents may have been.  Worthy or unworthy, there she stands now, with age, helplessness, and a hopeless temporal future, pleading more eloquently in her behalf than could the tongue of man or angel.  True, the same plea is equally applicable to poor old men, but, reader, I write not at present of principles so much as of feelings.  My weakness is old women!  Accordingly, on my professional visiting list--I had at that time a considerable number of these.  One of them, who was uncommonly small, unusually miserable, and pathetically feeble, lay heavy on my spirit just then.  She had a remarkably bad cold at the time, which betrayed itself chiefly in a frequent, but feeble, sneeze.  As I rose to go out, and looked at my doggie--who was, or seemed to be, asleep on the rug--a sudden thought occurred to me.  \"That poor old creature,\" I muttered, \"is very lonely in her garret; a little dog might comfort her.  Perhaps--but no.  Dumps, you are too lively for her, too bouncing.  She would require something feeble and affectionate, like herself.  Come, I'll think of that.  So, my doggie, you shall keep watch here until I return.\"    CHAPTER TWO.  INTRODUCES A YOUNG HERO.  The day had become very sultry by the time I went out to visit my patients.  The sky was overcast with dark thunderous clouds, and, as there seemed every chance of a heavy shower, I returned to my lodgings for an umbrella.  \"Oh, Mr Mellon!\" exclaimed my landlady, as I entered the lobby, \"was there ever a greater blessin'--oh!--\"  \"Why, what's the matter, Mrs Miff?\"  \"Oh, sir! that 'orrid little dog as you brought 'as gone mad!\"  \"Is that the blessing you refer to, Mrs Miff?\"  \"No, sir; but your comin' back is, for the creetur 'as bin rampagin' round the room, an yellin' like a thing possessed by demons.  I'm so glad you've come!\"  Feeling sure that the little dog, unaccustomed, perhaps, to be left alone in a strange place, was merely anxious to be free, I at once went to my room-door and opened it.  Dumps bounced out, and danced joyfully round me.  Mrs Miff fled in deadly silence to her own bedroom, where she locked and bolted herself in.  \"Dumps,\" said I, with a laugh, \"I shall have to take you with me at the risk of losing you.  Perhaps the memory of the feed I've given you, and the hope of another, may keep you by me.  Come, we shall see.\"  My doggie behaved much better than I had anticipated.  He did indeed stop at several butchers' shops during our walk, and looked inquiringly in.  He also evinced a desire to enter into conversation with one or two other sociable dogs, but the briefest chirp or whistle brought him at once obediently to my heel, just as if he had known and obeyed me all his life.  When we reached the poorer parts of the city, I observed that the free-and-easy swagger, and the jaunty hopping of each hind-leg alternately, gave place to a sedate walk and a wary turn of the head, which suggested keen suspicious glances of the unseen eyes.  \"Ah!\" thought I, \"evidently he has suffered hardships and bad treatment in places like this.\"  I stooped and patted his head.  He drew closer to me, as if seeking protection.  Just then a low grumbling of thunder was heard, and soon after the rain came down so heavily that, the umbrella forming an insufficient protection, Dumps and I sought shelter in the mouth of an alley.  The plump was short-lived, and the little knots of people who had sought shelter along with us melted quickly away.  My doggie's aspect was not improved by this shower.  It had caused his hairy coat to cling to his form, producing a drowned-rat aspect which was not becoming; but a short run and some vigorous shakes soon restored his rotundity.  In a few minutes thereafter we reached a narrow square or court at the end of a very dirty locality, in one corner of which was a low public-house.  Through the half-open swing-door could be seen the usual melancholy crowd of unhappy creatures who had either already come under the full influence and curse of strong drink, or were far on the road to ruin.  It was a sight with which I had become so familiar that, sad though it was, I scarce gave it a thought in passing.  My mind was occupied with the poor old woman I was about to visit, and I would have taken no further notice of the grog-shop in question if the door had not opened violently, and a dirty ragged street-boy, or \"waif,\" apparently about eight or nine years of age, rushed out with a wild cry that may be described as a compound cheer-and-yell.  He came out in such blind haste that he ran his ragged head with great violence against my side, and almost overturned me.  \"Hallo, youngster!\"  I exclaimed sternly.  \"Hallo, oldster!\" he replied, in a tone of the most insolent indignation, \"wot ever do you mean by runnin' agin my 'ead like that? Hain't you got no genteel boys in the West-end to butt agin, that you come all the way to Vitechapel to butt agin _me_?  I've a good mind to 'and you over to the p'leece.  Come, you owes me a copper for that.\"  The ineffable insolence of this waif took me quite by surprise.  He spoke with extreme volubility, and assumed the commanding air of a man of six-feet-four, though only a boy of four-feet-six.  I observed, however,"]]]
