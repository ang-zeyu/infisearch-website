But why do you ask!\"  \"For the reason that I think it would be a grand thing to hunt them up.\"  Harry laughed, and then slowly said: \"That would be a big thing to undertake. But what about going home?\"  \"I hadn't forgotten that. I meant that when we came back it would be proper for us to undertake.\"  \"Well, haven't you had enough trouble during the past two years?\" And Harry laughed, just as though they hadn't gone through sufficient trials to last a life time.  \"I wouldn't mind going through the same experiences, when I remember what we have learned and what all of us have accomplished,\" responded George, as he looked through the window, reflectively, and watched the natives at work.         *       *       *       *       *  It will be difficult to understand the force of the above conversation, unless the reader knows the situation in which the boys were placed at the time it took place, and the locality of the scene where the conversation was held.  Over two years previously two boys, George Mayfield and Harry Crandall, were members of a school training ship which left the Harbor of New York, for a cruise in southern waters, the object being to instruct the crew of seventy boys in the art of seamanship, as well as to give them a foundation knowledge in the arts and sciences.  On board they became intimate with a gray-haired Professor, who became very ill. They were particularly attracted to him, and waited upon him, until they reached the Pacific Ocean, where, for some reason the ship met a catastrophe, and the crew were compelled to take to open boats.  The two boys, with several companions, and the Professor, were together in one of the life boats, and after leaving the sinking ship a terrific gale, one of the great monsoons, separated them from the companion boats, and for six days they were driven about in the vast ocean, absolutely helpless. During this time all their young companions were washed overboard, and they were driven to the point of despair, when they were cast ashore on an island.  They were thus placed on an unknown land, with nothing but their scanty clothing, and devoid even of a knife. There is no indication that the land was inhabited, and for the first three months, while recuperating, they had no opportunity to go far from the spot where they landed.  After the Professor had regained his health, they began to make a few necessary things, and hunt for the food which was necessary to preserve life. As they grew bolder, however, they fashioned crude implements, like bows and arrows, and primitive articles of utility.  They made a few trips into the interior, and then saw the first indications which pointed to the presence of inhabitants. From some of the traces it was evident that the people must be savages, and then they saw the necessity of preparing themselves to meet hostile neighbors.  Then began the most remarkable series of adventures on the part of the boys, under the instruction of the Professor, to provide not only the necessaries of life, but many of the luxuries. While engaged in the different enterprises they undertook numerous excursions, all of which confirmed them in the first intimations that they had landed on an island, and that it contained one or more savage tribes.  To recount all that the boys did, even in the briefest space, would be impossible in this book, and it is not necessary, in order to relate the happenings from this time on; but some things are necessary, because we shall have to deal with incidents which took place during their adventures, and this volume also brings into the scene several characters, in addition to the three which have been named, as the principal participants.  The incidents referred to were called by the boys \"the mysteries.\" When they landed on the island they erected a flag pole, and improvised a flag which was kept at half mast, and mounted on a high point, so that it would attract passing ships, if their island chanced to be in the path of vessels. During one of their excursions the flag pole and staff disappeared.  For the purpose of making one of the trips by water a boat was built, and they sailed it up a large stream, only to find that within ten miles of their home was an immense cataract, or falls, around which they could not porter the vessel. It was left below the falls in a secure position, and ten days later, when they went for it, were surprised at its disappearance.  Later on it was found miles away, but the little closets which they had built in to hold their food and clothing, had disappeared, and they were still more startled to find a pair of oars, which they could not have made, attached to the boat.  In repairing the boat a note was discovered, written by some one who could not have been a member of their ill-fated vessel. This added to their perplexities, for it indicated that white people had been on the island, as well as savages.  Then they found strange ropes, evidently fashioned by a crude hand; a skull of a well-developed man was picked up on the shore not far from their home; part of the wreckage of a vessel was discovered; a herd of yaks was captured and a mysterious brand deciphered on one of them.  But in their wanderings they found the entrance to a cavern, and this was explored, resulting in finding that it was formerly a pirates' lair, and they were astounded at finding immense wealth in its hidden recesses.  They industriously searched the island, and found numerous ores which were dug out and smelted and from which they were able to build many things that added to their comfort; and finally, firearms were constructed, and powder made.  They spent much of the time in chemical experiments, in hunting for and gathering the different vegetables, and fibres, and from the latter learned how to weave cloth, to make felt, and to turn skins into leather from the animals which they hunted.  Their adventures were not wholly devoid of the amusing things of life. In one of the expeditions they captured a young Orang-outang. This was carefully taught to do many things, and it became not only a valuable assistant, and a wonderful scout in their wanderings, but it afforded them immense amusement, which was appreciated by the boys.  And now, having been provided with suitable weapons, they determined to go on voyages of discovery, being prompted in this course, because they found in the wreckage along one of the rivers, and far in the interior, a life boat which was a companion to their own which had been lost when they were stranded in the great tempest.  It was evident to them that some of their companions were on the island, and probably, captives. This made the quest a most exciting one, so every energy was bent toward the end of helping the unfortunates.  On the initial expedition, after the completion of the first weapons, they came into contact with several tribes of savages, one of whom was captured, after being wounded. It developed that he was a chief of one of the tribes which at that time were at war with each other.  Returning from this trip they discovered at their home a distinguished looking white man in rags, totally devoid of intellect, and unable to speak. It was evident that he had met with some accident, but he was entirely harmless, and obediently took up and performed every sort of manual labor,--in fact, was an expert in any sort of mechanical operation required of him.

I can not tell the photograph (Fig. 837) I made of the type from the photograph of Camillea Cyclops. From Montagne's sectional figure, the perithecia are arranged in the same manner, and the two plants are surely cogeneric and, I believe, identical. A close reading of Montagne's description discloses but one point of difference. He records that in Hypoxylon macromphalum the ostioles are prominent, and in a close examination of my photograph, I do note minute points on the disc that are absent from Camillea cyclops. Still I believe they are the same plant.  [Illustration: #Fig. 837.#]   SECTION 2. PHYLACIA.   This might be made a genus, corresponding to Hypoxylon as to stroma, but having the stroma hollow and filled with a pulverulent mass. In reality, I think it is a better Camillea, the perithecia arranged the same way, not permanent, but broken up at an early stage. Of course, it is only an inference. Léveillé states that it has the spores borne on hyphae (acrogenous), but I do not place much value on Léveillé's statements. Patouillard, after admitting that he saw nothing but this powdery mass, adds \"it is probable that the spores were contained in logettes with fugacious walls, of which only the marks on the inner side of the cavity remain.\" It would have been better if he had stopped there, but he goes on to propose afterwards that Hypoxylon Bomba should be held distinct from Camillea under the name Phylacia, because it presents a form \"stylospored\" and a form \"ascospored.\" He does not give the reason for the assertion that it is \"stylospored,\" not even citing the uncertain testimony of Léveillé. Phylacia might be held distinct from Camillea on the ground of the powdery mass and the early disappearance of the perithecia and ascus walls. There is nothing new about that. It was done years ago by Fries who called the \"genus\" Leveilleana, which is a tip for some future name-juggler. All that is really known about its early structure is only from inference, and that inference is contrary to its having been \"stylospored.\"  [Illustration: #Fig. 838.#  #Fig. 839.#  #Fig. 840.#                Camillea Sagraena. Fig. 838, a cluster natural size;                Fig. 839, broken specimen as often seen; Fig 840, two                long stipe specimens.]   CAMILLEA SAGRAENA (Figs. 838-840).--Plants oblong about 3-4 mm., stipitate or substipitate at the base, growing densely caespitose, in patches, black, smooth, the apices usually obscurely mammillate. Stipes usually short, but sometimes 6-8 mm. long, and when growing in clusters, the bases consolidated by a carbonous stroma. Interior of the receptacle in two compartments (Fig. 841 ×6), the lower filled with soft tissue, black around the edges, but _white_ in the center. The upper compartment filled with a mass of spores mixed with a few fragments of hyphae. Spores narrowly elliptical, 6 × 12, straight, pale colored.  [Illustration: #Fig. 841.#]  In Cuba I made abundant collections of this species. It grew in patches from the thin bark, usually on the branches of a dead tree. I do not know the name of the tree, but I think it was only on one kind, one of the few softwood trees of Cuba. Camillea Sagraena is undoubtedly a common species in the American tropics. It has never been well described, and the white tissue of the interior lower half, which is a very rare occurrence in similar black, carbonous plants, has never been noted. A \"new genus\" might be based on this feature. It is quite fragile and the broken bases as shown (Fig. 839) are often all that remain of it when old. Camillea surinamensis as named by Berkeley from specimens from Surinam, type at Kew, is exactly the same species. Berkeley does not record it from Cuba, but from Nicaragua, and the specimen is supposed to be illustrated by Ellis in his plate 38. It may have been the plant, but if so, it was so inaccurately drawn that it would never be recognized. In addition to my abundant collections from Cuba, I have a scanty collection also from Cuba from E. B. Sterling.  [Illustration: #Fig. 844.#  #Fig. 845.#                Camillea Bomba. Fig. 844 on bark; Fig. 845 on hard wood.]   CAMIILLEA BOMBA (Figs. 844, 845).--Plants globose, sessile, 4-6 mm. in diameter, black, smooth, without any disc. Dehiscing by irregular fracture. Stroma hollow on the interior (Fig. 846 ×6) filled with a brown powder, composed of spores mixed with abundant hyphae remnants of the perithecia and asci. Spores 6-7 × 10-12, elliptical, pale colored.  [Illustration: #Fig. 846.#]  This seems to be a frequent species in tropical America. I collected it in Cuba and have specimens from Miss Barrett, Jamaica, and L. J. K. Brace, Bahamas. The latter specimens grew erumpent from thin bark, and the broken bark forms a kind of cup at the base of the stroma. A thin, black mycelial stroma underlies the bark. Those I collected in Cuba were somewhat larger, and more irregular. Some grew in same manner, erumpent from thin bark and the broken bark forms a kind of cup at the base of the stroma, others on the naked, hard wood and grew more compact. In the latter case the black stroma at the base was thicker and more in evidence. There is no question but that Camillea Bomba is cogeneric with Camillea Sagraena, but the gleba of the latter consists almost entirely of spores, while in the former there is considerably more hyphae remnants than spores.   CAMILLEA GLOBOSA (Fig. 847).--Plants densely caespitose, sessile, globose, black, smooth. 7-8 mm. in diameter. Opening by irregular fracture. Stroma hollow, filled with a brown mass of spores and hyphae remnants. Spores elliptical.  Léveillé named this from a specimen from Tolima, Columbia, South America. The type Fig. 847 is all than is known to me. Léveillé spins a long story about it having spores borne on filaments, merely a wrong deduction, I think, from his having found filaments (of the perithecia walls?) mixed with the spores. Saccardo, who evidently did not take much stock in Léveillé's story, omitted the species, suggesting that it was a form of Camillea turbinata. Saccardo's conclusions were almost as bad as Léveillé's.  We have not examined any specimens of Camillea globosa, but suspect a section would show two divisions of the gleba, as in the next. In fact, with the exception of the stipe, it appears to be the same plant, and abundant collections may show them as only sessile and stipitate forms of the same thing.  [Illustration: #Fig. 847.#]   CAMILLEA POCULIFORMIS (Figs. 848 and 849).--Plants caespitose, stipitate, globose or obovate, smooth, black, 8-15 mm. in diameter. Stroma somewhat flattened at apex, opening circumscissally[2] or breaking irregularly. Stipe 8-10 cm. long, 2-3 mm. thick, black. Stroma hollow, the interior in two divisions, a narrow layer above, the fertile portion with a few spores in abundant, hyphae remnants, the lower (corresponding to the sterile base of a Lycoperdon) of matted hyphae. Spores short, elliptical, 9 × 14, pale colored, scantily found.  [Illustration: #Fig. 848.# Camillea poculiformis.]  [Illustration: #Fig. 849.#]  The pulverulent mass is rather firm, and remains after the peridium breaks up. Camillea poculiformis was named Corynelia poculiformis in Weigel's old exsiccatae, about a hundred years ago. It came from South America. Years later Montagne published it as Hypoxylon poculiformis, and Léveillé as Phylacia poculiformis. I can not trace it from Fries' writings, though no doubt Fries had it and doubtless named it. The old specimens of Weigel's exsiccatae are found in most museums of Europe, and all the publishing has been done on this one collection. I have a nice collection (Fig. 848), made by T. J. Collins in Guatemala.   SPECULATIONS.      The scanty knowledge we have of the real structure of this group     of plants leaves much to speculation. They are all evidently     closely related plants, and I think best classified under one     general head, or genus, Camillea. They are quite different from     the Hypoxylons of the temperate region, although we do not     question that the tropical species are included in Saccardo     mostly under Hypoxylon. When we come to compare what little we     know of the species we find several differences on which     \"genera\" could be based, and no doubt will be in time. In the     original sense, Camillea might be restricted to the two     cylindrical species, C. Leprieurii and C. Bacillum.      Then we have the short, cylindrical or globose forms with     persistent or semi-persistent perithecia, Camillea Labellum, C.     Cyclops and C. turbinata with the intermediate species C.     mucronata. The above will form one, or two, genera, according to     taste.      In the following plants we find no perithecia in the ripe     specimens, hence of course they will in time be considered a     genus. We believe there are two distinct differences between the     few species we know, corresponding with the old ideas of Bovista     and Lycoperdon in the puff balls. Camillea Sagraena and C.     poculiformis, with two divisions of the gleba, a fertile and a     sterile portion, and Camillea Bomba and C. globosa (?) with     homogenous gleba. The species Camillea Sagraena differs from the     other in having the fertile portion composed largely of spores     (scanty in others) and in having part of the sterile portion of     uncolored hyphae. Of course, it will form a \"genus.\" Thus the     genus Camillea can be easily divided into five \"genera\" and we     make the suggestion for the benefit of those engaged in breaking     up the old genera, and proposing new names to which to add their     own. Who will rise to the occasion?         *       *       *       *       *     THE GENUS THAMNOMYCES.   This is included in Saccardo as part of Xylaria, but we feel is well entitled to generic rank.
