This was a serious moment--a great hush was felt, nobody dared to move; but he really didn't play badly. And old Hale would tell stories which no one could understand, and de Maratray would play ping-pong with extraordinary agility. It would all have been great fun if people had not been killing each other so near. Why, during that time, the Boche did not bomb Amiens, I cannot understand, it was thick every week-end with the British Army. One could hardly jamb oneself through the crowd in the Place Gambetta or up the Rue des Trois Cailloux. It was a struggling mass of khaki, bumping over the uneven cobblestones. What streets they were! I remember walking back from dinner one night with a Major, the agricultural expert of the Somme, and he said, \"Don't you think the pavement is very hostile to-night?\"  I shall never forget my first sight of the Somme battlefields. It was snowing fast, but the ground was not covered, and there was this endless waste of mud, holes and water. Nothing but mud, water, crosses and broken Tanks; miles and miles of it, horrible and terrible, but with a noble dignity of its own, and, running through it, the great artery, the Albert-Bapaume Road, with its endless stream of men, guns, food lorries, mules and cars, all pressing along with apparently unceasing energy towards the front. Past all the little crosses where their comrades had fallen, nothing daunted, they pressed on towards the Hell that awaited them on the far side of Bapaume. The mud, the cold, the noise, the misery, and perhaps death;--on they went, plodding through the mud, those wonderful men, perhaps singing one of their cheer-making songs, such as:--    \"I want to go home.                                                 (p. 019)   I want to go home.   I don't want to go to the trenches no more,   Where the Whizz-bangs and Johnsons do rattle and roar.   Take me right over the sea,   Where the Allemande can't bayonet me.   Oh, my!   I don't want to die,   I want to go home.\"  [Illustration: V. _Warwickshires entering Péronne._]  How did they do it? \"I want to go home.\"--Does anyone realise what those words must have meant to them then? I believe I do now--a little bit. Even I, from my back, looking-on position, sometimes felt the terrible fear, the longing to get away. What must they have felt? \"From battle, murder and sudden death, Good Lord, deliver us.\"  On up the hill past the mines to Pozières. An Army railway was then running through Pozières, and the station was marked by a big wooden sign painted black and white, like you see at any country station in England, with POZIÈRES in large Roman letters, but that's all there was of Pozières except a little red in the mud. I remember later, at the R.F.C. H.Q., Maurice Baring showed me a series of air-photographs of Pozières as it was in 1914, with its peaceful little streets and rows of trees. What a contrast to the Pozières as it was in 1917--MUD. Further on, the Butte stood out on the right, a heap of chalky mud, not a blade of grass round it then--nothing but mud, with a white cross on the top. On the left, the Crown Prince's dug-out and Gibraltar--I suppose these have gone now--and Le Sars and Grévillers, at that time General Birdwood's H.Q., where the church had been knocked into a fine shape. I tried to draw it, but was much put off by air fighting. It seemed a favourite spot for this.  Bapaume must always have been a dismal place, like Albert, but        (p. 020) Péronne must have been lovely, looking up from the water; and the main _Place_ must have been most imposing, but then it was very sad. The Boche had only left it about three weeks, and it had not been \"cleaned up.\" But the real terribleness of the Somme was not in the towns or on the roads. One felt it as one wandered over the old battlefields of La Boisselle, Courcelette, Thiepval, Grandcourt, Miraumont, Beaumont-Hamel, Bazentin-le-Grand and Bazentin-le-Petit--the whole country practically untouched since the great day when the Boche was pushed back and it was left in peace once more.  A hand lying on the duckboards; a Boche and a Highlander locked in a deadly embrace at the edge of Highwood; the \"Cough-drop\" with the stench coming from its watery bottom; the shell-holes with the shapes of bodies faintly showing through the putrid water--all these things made one think terribly of what human beings had been through, and were going through a bit further on, and would be going through for perhaps years more--who knew how many?  I remember an officer saying to me, \"Paint the Somme? I could do it from memory--just a flat horizon-line and mud-holes and water, with the stumps of a few battered trees,\" but one could not paint the smell.  Early one morning in Amiens I got a message from Colonel John Buchan asking me to breakfast at the \"Hôtel du Rhin.\" While we were having breakfast, there was a great noise outside--an English voice was cursing someone else hard and telling him to get on and not make an ass of himself. Then a Flying Pilot was pushed in by an Observer. The Pilot's hand and arm were temporarily bound up, but blood was         (p. 021) dropping through. The Observer had his face badly scratched and one of his legs was not quite right. They sat at a table, and the waiter brought them eggs and coffee, which they took with relish, but the Pilot was constantly drooping towards his left, and the drooping always continued, till he went crack on the floor. Then the Observer would curse him soundly and put him back in his chair, where he would eat again till the next fall. When they had finished, the waiter put a cigarette in each of their mouths and lit them. After a few minutes four men walked in with two stretchers, put the two breakfasters on the stretchers, and walked out with them--not a word was spoken.  [Illustration: VI. _No Man's Land._]  I found out afterwards that the Pilot had been hit in the wrist over the lines early that morning and missed the direction back to his aerodrome. Getting very weak, he landed, not very well, outside Amiens. He got his wrist bound up and had asked someone to telephone to the aerodrome to tell them that they were going to the \"Rhin\" for breakfast, and would they send for them there?  After I had been in Amiens for about a fortnight, going out to the Somme battlefields early in the morning and coming back when it got dark, I received a message one evening from the Press \"Major\" to go to his château and ring up the \"Colonel\" at Rollencourt, which I did. The following was the conversation as far as I remember:--  \"Is that Orpen?\"  \"Yes, sir.\"  \"What do you mean by behaving this way?\"  \"What way, please, sir?\"  \"By not reporting to me.\"  \"I'm sorry, sir, but I do not understand.\"                            (p. 022)  \"Don't you know you must report to me, and show me what work you have been doing?\"  \"I've practically done nothing yet, sir.\"  \"What have you been doing?\"  \"Looking round, sir.\"  \"Are you aware you are being paid for your services?\"  \"Yes, sir.\"  \"Well, report to me and show me your work regularly.--Tell the Major to speak to me.\"  The Major spoke, and I clearly heard him say my behaviour was damnable.  This wonderful Colonel expected me to work all day, and apparently, in the evening, to take what I had done and show it to him--the distance by motor to him and back was something like 110 miles!  I saw there was nothing for it, if I wanted to do my work, but to fight, so I decided to lay my views of people and things before those who were above the Colonel. This I did, and had comparative peace, but the seed of hostility was sown in the Colonel's Intelligence (F) Section, G.H.Q., as I think it was then called, and they made me suffer as much as was in their power.         *       *       *       *       *  \"BEAUMONT-HAMEL\"                                                      (p. 023)  A MEMORY OF THE SOMME (SPRING 1917)    A fair spring morning--not a living soul is near,   Far, far away there is the faint grumble of the guns;   The battle has passed long since--   All is Peace.   At times there is the faint drone of aeroplanes as   They pass overhead, amber specks, high up in the blue;   Occasionally there is the movement of a rat in the   Old battered trench on which I sit, still in the   Confusion in which it was hurriedly left.   The sun is baking hot.   Strange odours come from the door of a dug-out   With its endless steps running down into blackness.   The land is white--dazzling.   The distance is all shimmering in heat.   A few little spring flowers have forced their way   Through the chalk.    He lies a few yards in front of the trench.   We are quite alone.   He makes me feel very awed, very small, very ashamed.   He has been there a long, long time--   Hundreds of eyes have seen him,   Hundreds of bodies have felt faint and sick   Because of him.   Then this place was Hell,   But now all is Peace.   And the sun has made him Holy and Pure--   He and his garments are bleached white and clean.   A daffodil is by his head, and his curly, golden                    (p. 024)   Hair is moving in the slight breeze.   He, the man who died in \"No Man's Land,\" doing   Some great act of bravery for his comrades and   Country--   Here he lies, Pure and Holy, his face upward turned;   No earth between him and his Maker.   I have no right to be so near.  [Illustration: VII. _Three Weeks in France.

POL (MAY-JUNE 1917)   About this time Freddie Fane (Major Fane, A.P.M.) sent me up to his old division, which was then fighting in front of Péronne.

Did they not give up their ships, and pay us tribute, and scurry out of Sardinia that Rome might spare them?  I--I who am talking to you have seen their armies: naked barbarians from the deserts, naked barbarians from the woods--not one well-armed man in five--a rabble with a score of languages, to whom no general can talk. _They_ to destroy the army of Rome--in her own land!--what crime have we committed that the gods should deal with us thus?\"  \"But the great beasts that tear up the ranks?\" put in a young butcher, one of the circle that had been drawn together about the veteran.  \"How did his elephants save Pyrrhus--and then we saw them for the first time?\" retorted the cripple.  \"You forget, that was before Rome had become the prey of demagogues; before she had Flaminii for consuls.\"  All turned toward the new speaker--the young patrician whom his companion had called Lucius.  He was a man perhaps twenty-five years of age, of middle height, sparely built but as if of tempered steel, with strong, commanding features and dark hawklike eyes that were now glittering with passion.  It was not a handsome face except so far as strength and pride make masculine beauty, but it was the face of one whom a man might trust and a woman love.  The butcher was on the point of returning an angry retort, half to hide his awe of the other's rank, when a friend caught him by the arm.  \"Do you not see it is Lucius Sergius Fidenas?\" he whispered.  The result of the warning was still doubtful, when a sudden commotion in the crowd about them drew the attention of all to a short, thick-set man of middle age, in the light panoply of a mounted legionary.  Cries went up from all about:--  \"It is Marcus Decius.\"  \"He is from the army.\"  \"Tell us! what news?\"  For answer the newcomer turned from one to the other of his questioners, with a dazed expression on his pale, drawn face.  \"What shall I say, neighbours?\" he muttered at last.  \"My horse fell just out there on the Flaminian road, and I came here on foot.  I have eaten nothing for a day.\"  But they paid no attention to his wants, thronging around with almost threatening gestures and crying:--  \"What news?  What news--not of yourself--of the army?--of the battle?\"  \"There was no battle, and there is no army,\" said the man, dully.  Sergius forced his way to the front and threw one arm about the soldier.  Then, turning to the crowd:--  \"Stand back!\" he cried, \"and give him air.  Do you not see the fellow is fainting?\"  \"No battle--and yet no army,\" repeated Decius, in a murmurous monotone, when, for a moment, there were silence and space around him.  \"We marched by the Lake Trasimenus, and the fog lay thick upon us.  Then came a noise of shouts and clash of arms and shrieks, but we saw nothing--only sometimes a great, white, naked body swinging a huge sword, and again a black man buried in his horse's mane that waved about him as he rushed by--only these things and our own men falling--falling without ever a chance to strike or to see whence we were stricken.\"  The crowd shuddered.  \"And the elephants?\"  \"I did not see them.  They say they are all dead.\"  \"And the consul?\"  \"I do not know.\"  Just then the cripple from the steps was pushed forward.  \"Flaminius is dead.  He died fighting, as a Roman consul should.  But you?  What are you, to let the pulse-eaters at him.  You should have seen how _we_ dealt with them off the Aegusian Islands.\"  \"Or at Drepana?\" sneered the horseman, roused from his lethargy by the other's taunt.  \"That was what a _patrician_ consul brought us to,\" muttered the cripple, glancing at Sergius.  \"Do you know what the Claudian did? When the sacred chickens would not eat, he cried out, 'Then they shall drink,' and ordered them thrown overboard.  How could soldiers win when an impious commander had first challenged the gods?\"  \"And what about Flaminius ordering our standards to be dug up when they could not be drawn from the earth?\" retorted the other.  \"Did he do that?\" asked several, and for a moment the feeling that had been with the cripple, and against the victim of this latest disaster, seemed divided.  Sergius perceived only too clearly that, in the present temper of men's minds, the faintest spark could light fires of riot and murder that might leave but a heap of ashes and corpses for the Carthaginian to gain.  Taking advantage of the momentary lull, he said in conciliatory tones:--  \"Flaminius neglected the auspices, and disaster came upon us for his impiety, but it appears that he died like a brave soldier, and he is a whip-knave who strikes at such.  As for this man, he needs succour and care.  Stand aside, then, that I may take him where his wants may be ministered to.  There will soon be plenty of fugitives to fill your ears with tales.\"  \"Not many, master, not many,\" murmured Decius, as the young man forced a way for them through the crowd.  \"Some are taken, but most lie in the defile of Trasimenus or under the waters of the Lake.\"  Sergius hurried on, thinking of Varbo the butcher's dream, and of Arates the Greek soothsayer's interpretation.     II.  WORDS.  Three days had passed since the awful news from the shore of Lake Trasimenus had plunged Rome into horror and despair.  Every hour had brought in stragglers: horse, foot, fugitives from the country-side, each bearing his tale of slaughter.  Crowds gathered at the gates, swarming about every newcomer, vociferous for his story, and then cursing and threatening the teller because it was what they knew it must be.  In the atrium of Titus Manlius Torquatus, on the brow of the Palatine, overlooking the New Way, was gathered a company of three: the aged master of the house, a type of the Roman of better days, and a worthy descendant of that Torquatus who had won the name; his son Caius, the youth who had been with Sergius in the Forum; and Lucius Sergius himself.  All were silent and serious.  The elder Torquatus sat by a square fountain ornamented with bronze dolphins, that lay in the middle of the mosaic paving of the apartment. The walls were painted half yellow, half red, after the manner of Magna Grascia, while around them were ranged the statues of the Manlian nobles.  The roof was supported in the Tuscan fashion by four beams crossing each other at right angles, and including between them the open space above the fountain.  It was the old man who spoke first.  \"Do not think, my Lucius, but that I see the justice of your prayer, or that I wish otherwise than that Marcia should wind wool about your doorposts.  Still there is much to be said for delay.  Surely these days are not auspicious ones for marriages, and surely better will come.  You have my pledge, as had my dead friend Marcus Marcius in the matter of her name.  Do you think it was nothing for me to call a daughter other than Manlia--and for a plebeian house at that?  Yet she is Marcia.  Doubt not that I will keep this word as well.\"  \"Aye, but, father,\" persisted Sergius, \"is it not something that she should be mine to protect in time of peril?\"  \"And who so able to protect as Lucius,\" put in Caius, with an admiring glance, for Caius Torquatus was six years younger than his friend, and admired him with all the devotion of a younger man.  \"Has it come that our house cannot protect its women?\" cried the elder Torquatus.  \"What more shameful than that our daughter should be carried thus across a Sergian threshold--going like a slave to her master!\"  He spoke proudly and sternly.  Then, turning to Sergius, he went on more gently: \"Were you to remain in the city, my son, there might be more force in what you claim; but you will go out with one of the new legions that they will doubtless raise, and you will believe an old man who says that it is not well for a soldier in the field to have a young wife at home.\"  Sergius flushed and was silent, lest his answer should savour of pride or disrespect toward an elder.  Suddenly they became conscious of a commotion in the street.  Shrill cries were borne to their ears, and, a moment later, blows fell upon the outer door, followed by the grinding noise as it turned upon its pivots.  A freedman burst into the atrium.  Titus Torquatus rose from his seat, and half raised his staff as if to punish the unceremonious intrusion.  Then he noted the excitement under which the man seemed to be labouring, and stood stern and silent to learn what news could warrant such a breach of decorum.  \"It is Maharbal, they say--\" and the speaker's voice came almost in gasps--\"Maharbal and the Numidians--\"  \"Not at the gates!\" cried both young men, springing to their feet; but the other shook his head and went on:--  \"No, not that--not _yet_, but he has cut up four thousand cavalry in Umbria with Caius Centenius.  The consul had sent them from Gaul--\"  \"Be silent!\" commanded the elder Torquatus.  \"Surely I hear the public crier in the street.  Is he not summoning the Senate?  Velo,\" he said, turning to the freedman; \"you are pardoned for your intrusion.  Go, now, and bear orders from me to arm my household, and that my clients and freedmen wait upon me in the morning.  It is possible that the Republic may call for every man; and though I fear Titus Manlius Torquatus cannot strike the blows he struck in Sicily, yet even _his_ sword might avail to pierce light armour; and he is happy in that he can give those to the State whose muscles shall suffice to drive the point through heavy buckler and breastplate.\"  \"Shall it be permitted that I attend you to the Senate House?\" asked Caius.  His father inclined "]]]
