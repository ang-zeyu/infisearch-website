I saw my little sister sold,   So will they do to me; My Heavenly Father, let me die,   For then I shall be free.     THE BEREAVED FATHER.  Words by Miss Chandler. Music by G.W.C.   [Music]  Ye've gone from me, my gentle ones!   With all your shouts of mirth; A silence is within my walls,   A darkness round my hearth,   A darkness round my hearth.  Woe to the hearts that heard, unmoved,   The mother's anguish'd shriek! And mock'd, with taunting scorn, the tears   That bathed a father's cheek.  Woe to the hands that tore you hence,   My innocent and good! Not e'en the tigress of the wild,   Thus tears her fellow's brood.  I list to hear your soft sweet tones,   Upon the morning air; I gaze amidst the twilight's gloom,   As if to find you there.  But you no more come bounding forth   To meet me in your glee; And when the evening shadows fall,   Ye are not at my knee.  Your forms are aye before my eyes,   Your voices on my ear, And all things wear a thought of you,   But you no more are here.  You were the glory of my life,   My blessing and my pride! I half forgot the name of slave,   When you were by my side!  Woe for your lot, ye doom'd ones! woe   A seal is on your fate! And shame, and toil, and wretchedness,   On all your steps await!     SLAVE GIRL MOURNING HER FATHER.  Parodied from Mrs. Sigourney by G.W.C.   [Music]  They say I was but four years old   When father was sold away; Yet I have never seen his face   Since that sad parting day. He went where brighter flowrets grow   Beneath the Southern skies; Oh who will show me on the map   Where that far country lies?  I begged him, \"father, do not go!   For, since my mother died, I love no one so well as you;\"   And, clinging to his side, The tears came gushing down my cheeks   Until my eyes were dim; Some were in sorrow for the dead,   And _some_ in love for him.  He knelt and prayed of God above,   \"My little daughter spare, And let us both here meet again,   O keep her in thy care.\" He does not come!--I watch for him   At evening twilight grey, Till every shadow wears his shape,   Along the grassy way.  I muse and listen all alone,   When stormy winds are high, And think I hear his tender tone,   And call, but no reply; And so I've done these four long years,   Without a friend or home, Yet every dream of hope is vain,--   Why don't my father come?  Father--dear father, are you sick,   Upon a stranger shore?-- The people say it must be so--   O send to me once more, And let your little daughter come,   To soothe your restless bed, And hold the cordial to your lips,   And press your aching head.  Alas!--I fear me he is dead!--   Who will my trouble share? Or tell me where his form is laid,   And let me travel there? By mother's tomb I love to sit,   Where the green branches wave; Good people! help a friendless child   To find her father's grave.     The Slave and her Babe.  WORDS BY CHARLOTTE ELIZABETH.  \"Can a woman forget her sucking child?\"  _Air--\"Slave Girl mourning her Father.\"_   O, massa, let me stay, to catch   My baby's sobbing breath; His little glassy eye to watch,   And smooth his limbs in death, And cover him with grass and leaf,   Beneath the plantain tree! It is not sullenness, but grief--   O, massa, pity me!  God gave me babe--a precious boon,   To cheer my lonely heart, But massa called to work too soon,   And I must needs depart. The morn was chill--I spoke no word,   But feared my babe might die, And heard all day, or thought I heard,   My little baby cry.  At noon--O, how I ran! and took   My baby to my breast! I lingered--and the long lash broke   My sleeping infant's rest. I worked till night--till darkest night,   In torture and disgrace; Went home, and watched till morning light,   To see my baby's face.  The fulness from its cheek was gone,   The sparkle from its eye; Now hot, like fire, now cold, like stone,   I _knew_ my babe must die. I worked upon plantation ground,   Though faint with woe and dread, Then ran, or flew, and here I found--   See massa, almost dead.  Then give me but one little hour--   O! do not lash me so! One little hour--one little hour--   And gratefully I'll go. Ah me! the whip has cut my boy,   I heard his feeble scream; No more--farewell my only joy,   My life's first gladsome dream!  I lay thee on the lonely sod,   The heaven is bright above; These Christians boast they have a God,   And say his name is Love: O gentle, loving God, look down!   My dying baby see; The mercy that from earth is flown,   Perhaps may dwell with THEE!     THE NEGRO'S APPEAL.  Words by Cowper. Tune--\"Isle of Beauty.\"   [Music]  Forced from home and all its pleasures,   Afric's coast I left forlorn; To increase a stranger's treasures,   O'er the raging billows borne. Christian people bought and sold me,   Paid my price in paltry gold: But though slave they have enrolled me   _Minds_ are never to be sold.  Is there, as ye sometimes tell me,   Is there one who reigns on high? Has he bid you buy and sell me,   Speaking from his throne--the sky? Ask him, if your knotted scourges,   Matches, blood-extorting screws, Are the means that duty urges   Agents of his will to use.  Hark! he answers--wild tornadoes,   Strewing yonder sea with wrecks, Wasting towns, plantations, meadows,   Are the voice with which he speaks. He, foreseeing what vexations   Afric's sons should undergo, Fixed their tyrant's habitations,   Where his whirlwinds answer--No!  By our blood in Afric' wasted,   Ere our necks received the chain; By the miseries that we tasted,   Crossing in your barks the main: By our sufferings, since ye brought us   To the man-degrading mart, All sustained by patience, taught us   Only by a broken heart--  Deem our nation brutes no longer,   Till some reason ye shall find, Worthier of regard and stronger   Than the _color_ of our kind. Slaves of gold! whose sordid dealings   Tarnish all your boasted powers; Prove that you have human feelings,   Ere you proudly question ours.     NEGRO BOY SOLD FOR A WATCH.[1]  [Footnote 1: An African prince having arrived in England, and having been asked what he had given for his watch, answered, \"What I will never give again--I gave a fine boy for it.\"]  Words by Cowper. Arranged by G.W.C. from an old theme.   [Music]  When avarice enslaves the mind,   And selfish views alone bear sway Man turns a savage to his kind,   And blood and rapine mark his way. Alas! for this poor simple toy,   I sold the hapless Negro boy.  His father's hope, his mother's pride,   Though black, yet comely to the view I tore him helpless from their side,   And gave him to a ruffian crew-- To fiends that Afric's coast annoy,   I sold the hapless Negro Boy.  From country, friends, and parents torn,   His tender limbs in chains confined, I saw him o'er the billows borne,   And marked his agony of mind; But still to gain this simple toy,   I gave the weeping Negro Boy.  In isles that deck the western wave   I doomed the hapless youth to dwell, A poor, forlorn, insulted slave!   A BEAST THAT CHRISTIANS BUY AND SELL! And in their cruel tasks employ   The much-enduring Negro Boy.  His wretched parents long shall mourn,   Shall long explore the distant main In hope to see the youth return;   But all their hopes and sighs are vain: They never shall the sight enjoy,   Of their lamented Negro Boy.  Beneath a tyrant's harsh command,   He wears away his youthful prime; Far distant from his native land,   A stranger in a foreign clime. No pleasing thoughts his mind employ,   A poor, dejected Negro Boy.  But He who walks upon the wind,   Whose voice in thunder's heard on high, Who doth the raging tempest bind,   And hurl the lightning through the sky, In his own time will sure destroy   The oppressor of the Negro Boy.     I AM MONARCH OF NOUGHT I SURVEY.  A Parody. Air \"Old Dr. Fleury.\"   I am monarch of nought I survey,   My wrongs there are none to dispute; My master conveys me away,   His whims or caprices to suit. O slavery, where are the charms   That \"patriarchs\" have seen in thy face; I dwell in the midst of alarms,   And serve in a horrible place.  I am out of humanity's reach,   And must finish my life with a groan; Never hear the sweet music of speech   That tells me my body's my own. Society, friendship, and love,   Divinely bestowed upon some, Are blessings I never can prove,   If slavery's my portion to come.  Religion! what treasures untold,   Reside in that heavenly word! More precious than silver or gold,   Or all that this earth can afford. But I am excluded the light   That leads to this heavenly grace; The Bible is clos'd to my sight,   Its beauties I never can trace.  Ye winds, that have made me your sport,   Convey to this sorrowful land, Some cordial endearing report,   Of freedom from tyranny's hand. My friends, do they not often send,   A wish or a thought after me? O, tell me I yet have a friend,   A friend I am anxious to see.  How fleet is a glance of the mind!   Compared with the speed of its flight; The tempest itself lags behind,   And the swift-winged arrows of light. When I think of Victoria's domain,   In a moment I seem to be there, But the fear of being taken again,   Soon hurries me back to despair.  The wood-fowl has gone to her nest,   The beast has lain down in his lair; To me, there's no season of rest,   Though I to my quarter repair. If mercy, O Lord, is in store,   For those who in slavery pine; Grant me when life's troubles are o'er,   A place in thy kingdom divine.     THE AFRIC'S DREAM.  Words by Miss Chandler. \"Emigrant's Lament,\" arranged by G.W.C.   [Music]  Why did ye wake me from my sleep? It was a dream of bliss, And ye have torn me from that land, to pine again in this; Methought, beneath yon whispering tree, that I was laid to rest, The turf, with all its with'ring flowers, upon my cold heart pressed.  My chains, these hateful chains, were gone--oh, would that I might die, So from my swelling pulse I could forever cast them by! And on, away, o'er land and sea, my joyful spirit"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22089"],["title","The Liberty Minstrel (#2)"],["body","ssed, Till, 'neath my own banana tree, I lighted down at last.  My cabin door, with all its flowers, was still profusely gay, As when I lightly sported there, in childhood's careless day! But trees that were as sapling twigs, with broad and shadowing bough, Around the well-known threshhold spread a freshening coolness now.  The birds whose notes I used to hear, were shouting on the earth, As if to greet me back again with their wild strains of mirth; My own bright stream was at my feet, and how I laughed to lave My burning lip, and cheek, and brow, in that delicious wave!  My boy, my first-born babe, had died amid his early hours, And there we laid him to his sleep among the clustering flowers; Yet lo! without my cottage-door he sported in his glee, With her whose grave is far from his, beneath yon linden tree.  I sprang to snatch them to my soul; when breathing out my name, To grasp my hand, and press my lip, a crowd of loved ones came! Wife, parents, children, kinsmen, friends! the dear and lost ones all, With blessed words of welcome came, to greet me from my thrall.  Forms long unseen were by my side; and thrilling on my ear, Came cadences from gentle tones, unheard for many a year; And on my cheeks fond lips were pressed, with true affection's kiss-- And so ye waked me from my sleep--but 'twas a dream of bliss!     SONG OF THE COFFLE GANG.[2]  [Footnote 2: This song is said to be sung by Slaves, as they are chained in gangs, when parting from friends for the far off South--children taken from parents, husbands from wives, and brothers from sisters.]  Words by the Slaves. Music by G.W.C.   [Music]    See these poor souls from Africa,   Transported to America; We are stolen, and sold to Georgia, will you go along with me? We are stolen and sold to Georgia, go sound the jubilee.    See wives and husbands sold apart,   The children's screams!--it breaks my heart; There's a better day a coming, will you go along with me? There's a better day a coming, go sound the jubilee.    O gracious Lord! when shall it be,   That we poor souls shall all be free? Lord, break them Slavery powers--will you go along with me? Lord, break them Slavery powers, go sound the jubilee.    Dear Lord! dear Lord! when Slavery'll cease,   Then we poor souls can have our peace; There's a better day a coming, will you go along with me? There's a better day a coming, go sound the jubilee.     HARK! I HEAR A SOUND OF ANGUISH.  Air, \"Calvary.\"   [Music]  Hark! I hear a sound of anguish   In my own, my native land; Brethren, doomed in chains to languish,   Lift to heaven the suppliant hand,           And despairing,           And despairing,   Death the end of woe demand.  Let us raise our supplication   For the wretched suffering slave, All whose life is desolation,   All whose hope is in the grave;           God of mercy!   From thy throne, O hear and save.  Those in bonds we would remember   As if we with them were bound; For each crushed, each suffering member   Let our sympathies abound,           Till our labors   Spread the smiles of freedom round.  Even now the word is spoken;   \"Slavery's cruel power must cease, From the bound the chain be broken,   Captives hail the kind release,\"           While in splendor   Comes to reign the Prince of Peace.     BROTHERS BE BRAVE FOR THE PINING SLAVE.  Air--\"Sparkling and Bright.\"   [Music]  Solo.  Heavy and cold in his dungeon hold,   Is the yoke of the oppressor; Dark o'er the soul is the fell control   Of the stern and dread transgressor.  Chorus.      Oh then come all to bring the thrall       Up from his deep despairing,     And out of the jaw of the bandit's law,       Retake the prey he's tearing:     O then come all to bring the thrall       Up from his deep despairing,     And out of the jaw of the bandit's law,       Retake the prey he's tearing.  Brothers be brave for the pining slave,   From his wife and children riven; From every vale their bitter wail   Goes sounding up to Heaven.     Then for the life of that poor wife,       And for those children pining;     O ne'er give o'er till the chains no more       Around their limbs are twining.  Gloomy and damp is the low rice swamp,   Where their meagre bands are wasting; All worn and weak, in vain they seek   For rest, to the cool shade hasting;     For drivers fell, like fiends from hell,       Cease not their savage shouting;     And the scourge's crack, from quivering back,       Sends up the red blood spouting.  Into the grave looks only the slave,   For rest to his limbs aweary; His spirit's light comes from that night,   To us so dark and dreary.     That soul shall nurse its heavy curse       Against a day of terror,     When the lightning gleam of his wrath shall stream       Like fire, on the hosts of error.  Heavy and stern are the bolts which burn   In the right hand of Jehovah; To smite the strong red arm of wrong,   And dash his temples over;     Then on amain to rend the chain,       Ere bursts the vallied thunder;     Right onward speed till the slave is freed--       His manacles torn asunder.  E.D.H.     THE QUADROON MAIDEN.  Words by Longfellow. Theme from the Indian Maid.   [Music]  The Slaver in the broad lagoon,   Lay moored with idle sail; He waited for the rising moon,   And for the evening gale.  The Planter under his roof of thatch,   Smoked thoughtfully and slow; The Slaver's thumb was on the latch,   He seemed in haste to go.  He said, \"My ship at anchor rides   In yonder broad lagoon; I only wait the evening tides,   And the rising of the moon.\"  Before them, with her face upraised,   In timid attitude, Like one half curious, half amazed,   A Quadroon maiden stood.  And on her lips there played a smile   As holy, meek, and faint, As lights, in some cathedral aisle,   The features of a saint.  \"The soil is barren, the farm is old,\"   The thoughtful Planter said, Then looked upon the Slaver's gold,   And then upon the maid.  His heart within him was at strife,   With such accursed gains; For he knew whose passions gave her life,   Whose blood ran in her veins.  But the voice of nature was too weak:   He took the glittering gold! Then pale as death grew the maiden's cheek,   Her hands as icy cold.  The Slaver led her from the door,   He led her by the hand, To be his slave and paramour   In a far and distant land.     Domestic Bliss.  BY REV. JAMES GREGG.   Domestic bliss; thou fairest flower   That erst in Eden grew, Dear relic of the happy bower,   Our first grand parents knew!  We hail thee in the rugged soil   Of this waste wilderness, To cheer our way and cheat our toil,   With gleams of happiness.  In thy mild light we travel on,   And smile at toil and pain; And think no more of Eden gone,   For Eden won again.  Such, Emily, the bliss, the joy   By Heaven bestowed on you; A husband kind, a lovely boy,   A father fond and true.  Religion adds her cheering beams,   And sanctifies these ties; And sheds o'er all the brighter gleams,   She borrows from the skies.  But ah! reflect; are _all_ thus blest?   Hath home such charms for _all_? Can such delights as these invest   Foul slavery's wretched thrall?  Can those be happy in these ties   Who wear her galling chain? Or taste the blessed charities   That in the household reign?  Can those be blest, whose hope, whose life,   Hang on a tyrant's nod; To whom nor husband, child, nor wife   Are known--yea, scarcely God?  Whose ties may all be rudely riven,   At avarice' fell behest; Whose only hope of _home_ is heaven,   The grave their only rest.  Oh! think of those, the poor, th' oppressed,   In your full hour of bliss; Nor e'er from prayer and effort rest,   While earth bears woe like this.     O PITY THE SLAVE MOTHER.  Words from the Liberator. Air, Araby's Daughter.   [Music]  I pity the slave mother, careworn and weary,   Who sighs as she presses her babe to her breast; I lament her sad fate, all so hopeless and dreary,   I lament for her woes, and her wrongs unredressed. O who can imagine her heart's deep emotion,   As she thinks of her children about to be sold; You may picture the bounds of the rock-girdled ocean,   But the grief of that mother can never be known.  The mildew of slavery has blighted each blossom,   That ever has bloomed in her pathway below; It has froze every fountain that gushed in her bosom,   And chilled her heart's verdure with pitiless woe: Her parents, her kindred, all crushed by oppression;   Her husband still doomed in its desert to stay; No arm to protect from the tyrant's aggression--   She must weep as she treads on her desolate way.  O, slave-mother, hope! see--the nation is shaking!   The arm of the Lord is awake to thy wrong! The slave-holder's heart now with terror is quaking   Salvation and Mercy to Heaven belong! Rejoice, O rejoice! for the child thou art rearing,   May one day lift up its unmanacled form, While hope, to thy heart, like the rain-bow so cheering,   Is born, like the rain-bow, 'mid tempest and storm.     How long! O! how long!   How long will the friend of the slave plead in vain? How long e'er the Christian will loosen the chain? If he, by our efforts, more hardened should be, O Father, forgive him! we trust but in thee. That 'we're all free and equal,' how senseless the cry, While millions in bondage are groaning so nigh! O where is our freedom? equality where? To this none can answer, but echo cries, where?  O'er this stain on our country we'd fain draw a veil, But history's page will proclaim the sad tale, That Christians, unblushing, could shout 'we are free,' Whilst they the oppressors of millions could be. They can feel for themselves, for the Pole they can feel, Towards Afric's children their hearts are like steel; They are deaf to their call, to their wrongs they are blind; In error they slumber nor seek truth to find.  Though scorn and oppression on our pathway attend, Despised and reviled, we the slave will befriend; Our Father, thy blessing! we look but to thee, Nor cease from our labors till"]]]
