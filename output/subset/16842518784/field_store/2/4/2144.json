We have plenty of brandy, if we don't have anything else.\"  \"You can say that again, Kurt.\" That was one of the distillery people; he'd remember the name in a moment. \"When this new crop gets pressed and fermented....\"  \"I don't know where in Gehenna I'm going to vat mine till it ferments,\" Klem Zareff said.  \"Or why,\" another planter added. \"Lorenzo, what are you going to be paying for wine?\"  Lorenzo Menardes; that was the name. The distiller said he was worrying about what he'd be able to get for brandy.  \"Oh, please,\" Fawzi interrupted. \"Not today; not when our boy's home and is going to tell us how we can solve all our problems.\"  \"Yes, Conn.\" That was Morgan Gatworth, the lawyer. \"You did find out where Merlin is, didn't you?\"  That set them all off. He was still holding his drink; he downed it in one gulp, barely tasting it, and handed the glass to Tom Brangwyn for a refill, and caught a frown on his father's face. One did not gulp drinks in Kurt Fawzi's office.  Well, neither did one blast everybody's hopes with half a dozen words, and that was what he was trying to force himself to do. He wanted to blurt out the one quick sentence and get it over with, but the words wouldn't come out of his throat. He lowered the second drink by half; the brandy was beginning to warm him and dissolve the cold lump in his stomach. Have to go easy, though. He wasn't used to this kind of drinking, and he wanted to stay sober enough to talk sense until he'd told them what he had to.  \"I hope,\" he said, \"that you don't expect me to show you the cross on the map, where the computer is buried.\"  All the eyes around him began to look troubled. Most of them had been expecting precisely that. His father was watching him anxiously.  \"But it's still here on Poictesme, isn't it?\" one of the melon planters asked. \"They didn't take it away with them?\"  \"Most of you gentlemen,\" he said, \"contributed to sending me to school on Terra, to study cybernetics and computer theory. It wouldn't do us any good to find Merlin if none of us could operate it. Well, I've done that. I can use any known type of computer, and train assistants. After I graduated, I was offered a junior instructorship to computer physics at the University.\"  \"You didn't mention that, son,\" his father said.  \"The letter would have come on the same ship I did. Besides, I didn't think it was very important.\"  \"I think it is.\" There was a catch in old Dolf Kellton's voice. \"One of my boys from the Academy offered a place on the faculty of the University of Montevideo, on Terra!\" He finished his drink and held out his glass for more, something he almost never did.  \"Conn means,\" Kurt Fawzi explained, \"that it had nothing to do with Merlin.\"  All right; now tell them the truth.  \"I was also to find out anything I could about a secret giant computer used during the War by the Third Fleet-Army Force, code-named Merlin. I went over all the records available to the public; I used your letter, Professor, and the head of our Modern History department secured me access to non-public material, some of it still classified. For one thing, I have locations and maps and plans of every Federation installation built here between 842 and 854, the whole period of the War.\" He turned to his father. \"There are incredible things still undiscovered; most of the important installations were built in duplicate, sometimes triplicate, as a precaution against space attack. I know where all of them are.\"  \"Space attack!\" Klem Zareff was indignant. \"There never was a time we could have attacked Poictesme. Even if we'd had the ships, we were fighting a purely defensive war. Aggression was no part of our policy--\"  He interrupted: \"Excuse me, Colonel. The point I was trying to make is that, with all I was able to learn, I could find nothing, not one single word, about any giant strategic planning computer called Merlin, or any Merlin Project.\"  There! He'd gotten that out. Now go on and tell them about the old man in the dome-house on Luna. The room was silent, except for the small insectile hum of the electric clock. Then somebody set a glass on the table, and it sounded like a hammer blow.  \"Nothing, Conn?\"  Kurt Fawzi was incredulous. Judge Ledue's hand shook as though palsied as he tried to relight his cigar. Dolf Kellton was looking at the drink in his hand as though he had no idea what it was. The others found their voices, one by one.  \"Of course, it was the most closely guarded secret ...\"  \"But after forty years ...\"  \"Hah, don't tell me about security!\" Colonel Zareff barked. \"You should have seen the lengths our staff went to. I remember, once, on Mephistopheles ...\"  \"But there _was_ a computer code-named Merlin,\" Judge Ledue was insisting, to convince himself more than anybody else. \"Its memory-bank contained all human knowledge. It was capable of scanning all its data instantaneously, and combining, and forming associations, and reasoning with absolute accuracy, and extrapolating to produce new facts, and predicting future events, and ...\"  And if you'd asked such a computer, \"Is there a God?\" it would have simply answered, \"Present.\"  \"We'd have won the War, except for Merlin,\" Zareff was declaring.  \"Conn, from what you've learned of computers generally, how big would Merlin have to be?\" old Professor Kellton asked.  \"Well, the astrophysics computer at the University occupied a volume of a hundred thousand cubic feet. For all Merlin was supposed to do, I'd say something of the order of three million to five million.  \"Well, it's a cinch they didn't haul that away with them,\" Lester Dawes, the banker, said.  \"Oh, lots of places on Poictesme where they could have hid a thing like that,\" Tom Brangwyn said. \"You know, a planet's a mighty big place.\"  \"It doesn't have to be on Poictesme, even,\" Morgan Gatworth pointed out. \"It could be anywhere in the Trisystem.\"  \"You know where I'd have put it?\" Lorenzo Menardes asked. \"On one of the moons of Pantagruel.\"  \"But that's in the Gamma System, three light years away,\" Kurt Fawzi objected. \"There isn't a hypership on this planet, and it would take half a lifetime to get there on normal-space drive.\"  Conn was lifting his glass to his lips. He set it down again and rose to his feet.  \"Then,\" he said, \"we will build a hypership. On Koshchei there are shipyards and hyperdrive engines and everything we will need. We only need one normal-space interplanetary ship to get out there, and we're in business.\"  \"Well, I don't know we need one,\" Judge Ledue said. \"That was only an idea of Lorenzo's. I think Merlin's right here on Poictesme.\"  \"We don't know it is,\" Conn replied. \"And we don't know we won't need a ship. Merlin may be on Koshchei; that's where the components would be fabricated, and the Armed Forces weren't hauling anything any farther than they had to. Koshchei's only two and a half minutes away by radio; that's practically in the next room. Look; here's how they could have done it.\"  He went on talking, about remote controls and radio transmission and positronic brains and neutrino-circuits. They believed it all, even the little they understood. They would believe anything he told them about Merlin--except the truth.  \"But this will take money,\" Lester Dawes said. \"And after that infernal deluge of unsecured paper currency thirty years ago ...\"  \"I have no doubt,\" Judge Ledue began, \"that the Planetary Government at Storisende would give assistance. I have some slight influence with President Vyckhoven ...\"  \"Huh-_uh_!\" That was one of Klem Zareff's fellow planters. \"We don't want Jake Vyckhoven or any of this First-Families-of-Storisende oligarchy in this at all. That's the gang that bankrupted the Government with doles and work relief, and everybody else with worthless printing-press money after the War, and they've been squatting in a circle deploring things ever since. Some of these days Blackie Perales and his pirates'll sack Storisende, for all they'd be able to do to stop him.\"  \"We get a ship out to Koshchei, and the next thing you know we'll be the Planetary Government,\" Tom Brangwyn said.  Rodney Maxwell finished the brandy in his glass and set it on the table, then went to the pile of belts and holsters and began rummaging for his own. Kurt Fawzi looked up in surprise.  \"Rod, you're not leaving are you?\" he asked.  \"Yes. It's only half an hour till time for dinner, and I think Conn and I ought to have a little fresh air. Besides, you know, we haven't seen each other for six years.\" He buckled on the heavy automatic and settled the belt over his hips. \"You didn't have a gun, did you, Conn?\" he asked. \"Well, let's go.\"     III   It wasn't until they were down to the main level and outside in the little plaza to the east of the Airlines Building that his father broke the silence.  \"That was quite a talk you gave them, Conn. They believed every word of it. I even caught myself starting to believe it once or twice.\"  Conn stopped short; his father halted beside him. \"Why didn't you tell them the truth, son?\" Rodney Maxwell asked.  The question, which he had been throwing at himself, angered him. \"Why didn't I just grab a couple of pistols and shoot the lot of them?\" he retorted. \"It wouldn't have killed them any deader, and it wouldn't have hurt as much.\"  \"There is no Merlin. Is that it?\"  He realized, suddenly, that his father had known, or suspected that all along. He started to say something, then checked himself and began again:  \"There never was one. I was going to tell them, but you saw them. I couldn't.\"  \"You're sure of it?\"  \"The whole thing's a myth. I'm quoting the one man in the Galaxy who ought to know. The man who commanded the Third Force here during the War.\"  \"Foxx Travis!\" His father's voice was soft with wonder. \"I saw him once, when I was eight years old. I thought he'd died long ago. Why, he must be over a hundred.\"  \"A hundred and twelve.

And Otto Harkaman.  Harkaman was a Space Viking. That would have set him apart, even if he hadn't topped the tallest of them by a head. He wore a short black jacket, heavily gold-braided, and black trousers inside ankle-boots; the dagger on his belt was no mere dress-ornament. His tousled red-brown hair was long enough to furnish extra padding in a combat-helmet, and his beard was cut square at the bottom.  He had been fighting on Durendal, for one of the branches of the royal house contesting fratricidally for the throne. The wrong one; he had lost his ship, and most of his men and, almost, his own life. He had been a penniless refugee on Flamberge, owning only the clothes he stood in and his personal weapons and the loyalty of half a dozen adventurers as penniless as himself, when Duke Angus had invited him to Gram to command the _Enterprise_.  \"A pleasure, Lord Trask. I've met your lovely bride-to-be, and now that I meet you, let me congratulate both.\" Then, as they were having a drink together, he put his foot in it by asking: \"You're not an investor in the Tanith Adventure, are you?\"  He said he wasn't, and would have let it go at that. Young Basil Gorram had to get his foot in, too.  \"Lord Trask does not approve of the Tanith Adventure,\" he said scornfully. \"He thinks we should stay home and produce wealth, instead of exporting robbery and murder to the Old Federation for it.\"  The smile remained on Otto Harkaman's face; only the friendliness was gone. He unobtrusively shifted his drink to his left hand.  \"Well, our operations are definable as robbery and murder,\" he agreed. \"Space Vikings are professional robbers and murderers. And you object? Perhaps you find me personally objectionable?\"  \"I wouldn't have shaken your hand or had a drink with you if I did. I don't care how many planets you raid or cities you sack, or how many innocents, if that's what they are, you massacre in the Old Federation. You couldn't possibly do anything worse than those people have been doing to one another for the past ten centuries. What I object to is the way you're raiding the Sword-Worlds.\"  \"You're crazy!\" Basil Gorram exploded.  \"Young man,\" Harkaman reproved, \"the conversation was between Lord Trask and myself. And when somebody makes a statement you don't understand, don't tell him he's crazy. Ask him what he means. What _do_ you mean, Lord Trask?\"  \"You should know; you've just raided Gram for eight hundred of our best men. You raided me for close to forty vaqueros, farm-workers, lumbermen, machine-operators, and I doubt I'll be able to replace them with as good.\" He turned to the elder Gorram. \"Alex, how many have you lost to Captain Harkaman?\"  Gorram tried to make it a dozen; pressed, he admitted to a score and a half. Roboticians, machine-supervisors, programmers, a couple of engineers, a foreman. There was grudging agreement from the others. Burt Sandrasan's engine-works had lost almost as many, of the same kind. Even Lothar Ffayle admitted to losing a computerman and a guard-sergeant.  And after they were gone, the farms and ranches and factories would go on, almost but not quite as before. Nothing on Gram, nothing on any of the Sword-Worlds, was done as efficiently as three centuries ago. The whole level of Sword-World life was sinking, like the east coastline of this continent, so slowly as to be evident only from the records and monuments of the past. He said as much, and added:  \"And the genetic loss. The best Sword-World genes are literally escaping to space, like the atmosphere of a low-gravity planet, each generation begotten by fathers slightly inferior to the last. It wasn't so bad when the Space Vikings raided directly from the Sword-Worlds; they got home once in a while. Now they're conquering planets in the Old Federation for bases, and staying there.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Everybody had begun to relax; this wouldn't be a quarrel. Harkaman, who had shifted his drink back to his right hand, chuckled.  \"That's right. I've fathered my share of brats in the Old Federation, and I know Space Vikings whose fathers were born on Old Federation planets.\" He turned to Basil Gorram. \"You see, the gentleman isn't crazy, at all. That's what happened to the Terran Federation, by the way. The good men all left to colonize, and the stuffed shirts and yes-men and herd-followers and safety-firsters stayed on Terra and tried to govern the galaxy.\"  \"Well, maybe this is all new to you, captain,\" Rovard Grauffis said sourly, \"but Lucas Trask's dirge for the Decline and Fall of the Sword-Worlds is an old song to the rest of us. I have too much to do to stay here and argue.\"  Lothar Ffayle evidently did intend to stay and argue.  \"All you're saying, Lucas, is that we're expanding. You want us to sit here and build up population pressure like Terra in the First Century?\"  \"With three and a half billion people spread out on twelve planets? They had that many on Terra alone. And it took us eight centuries to reach that.\"  That had been since the Ninth Century, Atomic Era, at the end of the Big War. Ten thousand men and women on Abigor, refusing to surrender, had taken the remnant of the System States Alliance navy to space, seeking a world the Federation had never heard of and wouldn't find for a long time. That had been the world they had called Excalibur. From it, their grandchildren had colonized Joyeuse and Durendal and Flamberge; Haulteclere had been colonized in the next generation from Joyeuse, and Gram from Haulteclere.  \"We're not expanding, Lothar; we're contracting. We stopped expanding three hundred and fifty years ago, when that ship came back to Morglay from the Old Federation and reported what had been happening out there since the Big War. Before that, we were discovering new planets and colonizing them. Since then, we've been picking the bones of the dead Terran Federation.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Something was going on by the escalators to the landing stage. People were moving excitedly in that direction, and the news cars were circling like vultures over a sick cow. Harkaman wondered, hopefully, if it mightn't be a fight.  \"Some drunk being bounced.\" Nikkolay, Lucas' cousin, commented. \"Sesar's let all Wardshaven in here, today. But, Lucas, this Tanith adventure; we're not making any hit-and-run raid. We're taking over a whole planet; it'll be another Sword-World in forty or fifty years.\"  [Illustration]  \"Inside another century, we'll conquer the whole Federation,\" Baron Rathmore declared. He was a politician and never let exaggeration worry him.  \"What I don't understand,\" Harkaman said, \"is why you support Duke Angus, Lord Trask, if you think the Tanith adventure is doing Gram so much harm.\"  [Illustration]  \"If Angus didn't do it, somebody else would. But Angus is going to make himself King of Gram, and I don't think anybody else could do that. This planet needs a single sovereignty. I don't know how much you've seen of it outside this duchy, but don't take Wardshaven as typical. Some of these duchies, like Glaspyth or Didreksburg, are literal snake pits. All the major barons are at each other's throats, and they can't even keep their own knights and petty-barons in order. Why, there's a miserable little war down in Southmain Continent that's been going on for over two centuries.\"  \"That's probably where Dunnan's going to take that army of his,\" a robot-manufacturing baron said. \"I hope it gets wiped out, and Dunnan with it.\"  \"You don't have to go to Southmain; just go to Glaspyth,\" somebody else said.  \"Well, if we don't get a planetary monarchy to keep order, this planet will decivilize like anything in the Old Federation.\"  \"Oh, _come_, Lucas!\" Alex Gorram protested. \"That's pulling it out too far.\"  \"Yes, for one thing, we don't have the Neobarbarians,\" somebody said. \"And if they ever came out here, we'd blow them to Em-See-Square in nothing flat. Might be a good thing if they did, too; it would stop us squabbling among ourselves.\"  Harkaman looked at him in surprise. \"Just who do you think the Neobarbarians are, anyhow?\" he asked. \"Some race of invading nomads; Attila's Huns in spaceships?\"  \"Well, isn't that who they are?\" Gorram asked.  \"Nifflheim, no! There aren't a dozen and a half planets in the Old Federation that still have hyperdrive, and they're all civilized. That's if 'civilized' is what Gilgamesh is,\" he added. \"These are homemade barbarians. Workers and peasants who revolted to seize and divide the wealth and then found they'd smashed the means of production and killed off all the technical brains. Survivors on planets hit during the Interstellar Wars, from the Eleventh to the Thirteenth Centuries, who lost the machinery of civilization. Followers of political leaders on local-dictatorship planets. Companies of mercenaries thrown out of employment and living by pillage. Religious fanatics following self-anointed prophets.\"  \"You think we don't have plenty of Neobarbarian material here on Gram?\" Trask demanded. \"If you do, take a look around.\"  Glaspyth, somebody said.  \"That collection of over-ripe gallows-fruit Andray Dunnan's recruited,\" Rathmore mentioned.  Alex Gorram was grumbling that his shipyard was full of them; agitators stirring up trouble, trying to organize a strike to get rid of the robots.  \"Yes,\" Harkaman pounced on that last. \"I know of at least forty instances, on a dozen and a half planets, in the last eight centuries, of anti-technological movements. They had them on Terra, back as far as the Second Century Pre-Atomic. And after Venus seceded from the First Federation, before the Second Federation was organized.\"  \"You're interested in history?\" Rathmore asked.  \"A hobby. All spacemen have hobbies. There's very little work aboard ship in hyperspace; boredom is the worst enemy. My guns-and-missiles officer, Vann Larch, is a painter. Most of his work was"]]]
