We were in the semi-darkness of a beautiful, moonlit night.  \"Don't go to sleep, Jac!\"  I became aware that Georg and his father were smiling at me.  I sat up, snapping my wits into alertness. \"No. Of course not. I guess I'm tired. You've no idea what the office was like tonight. Roaring.\"  \"I can imagine,\" Georg said. \"You were at Park Sixty when the President fell, weren't you?\"  \"Yes. But I wasn't supposed to be. I wasn't assigned to that. How did you guess?\"  \"Elza saw you. She had our finder on you--I couldn't push her away from it.\" His slow smile was quizzical.  \"On me? In all that crowd. She must have searched about very carefully to----\"  I stopped; I could feel my cheeks burning, and was glad of the dimness there under the trees.  \"She did,\" said Georg.  \"I sent for you, Jac,\" Dr. Brende interjected abstractedly, \"because----\"  But Georg checked him. \"Not now, father. Someone--anyone--might pick you up. Your words--or read your lips--there's light enough here to register on a finder.\"  The doctor nodded. \"He's afraid--you see, Jac, it's these Venus----\"  \"Father--please. It's a long chance--but why take any? We can insulate in the house.\"  The chance that someone who shouldn't be, was tuned to us as we sat there in that lonely grove! With the doctor's widespread reputation--his more than national prominence--it did not seem to me to be such a long chance either, on this, of all nights.  \"As you say, no use in putting private things into the public air,\" I remarked; and I felt then as though a thousand hostile eyes and ears were watching and listening. \"We can talk of what everybody knows,\" Georg commented. \"The Martian Ruler of the Little People was assassinated an hour ago. You heard that coming up?\"  \"No,\" I said; but I had imagined as much. \"Did they say--\"  \"They said nothing,\" Dr. Brende put in. \"The flash of a dozen helioed words--no more.\"  \"It went dark, like Venus?\"  \"No. Just discontinued. I judge they're excited up there--the Bureau disorganized perhaps--I don't know. That was the last we got at the house, just before you came down. There may be something in there now--you Inter-Allied people are pretty reliable.\"  The ruler of the Venus Central State, the leading monarch of Mars, and our three chief executives of Earth--murdered almost simultaneously! It was incredible--any one of the murders would have been incredible--yet it was true.  There had been times--in the Inter-Allied Office, particularly--when I had been insulated from aerial eavesdropping. But never had I felt the need of it more than now. A constraint fell over me; I seemed afraid to say anything. I think we all three felt very much like that; and it was a relief when Elza arrived with my dainty little meal.  \"Any word from Mars, Elza?\" her father asked.  She sat down beside me, helping me to the food.  \"I did not look,\" she answered.  She did not look, because she was busy preparing my meal! Dear little Elza! And because of my accursed extravagance--my poverty--no word of love had ever passed between us!  I thought I had never seen Elza so beautiful as this moment. A slim little thing, perfectly formed and matured, and inches shorter than I. Thick brown hair braided, and hanging below her waist. A face--pretty as her mother's must have been--yet intellectual as her father's.  I had taken Elza to the great music festivals of the city, and counted her the best dressed girl in all the vast throng. Tonight she was dressed simply. A grey-blue, tubular sort of skirt, clinging close to the lines of her figure and split at the side for walking; a tight-fitting bodice, light in color (a man knows little of the technicalities of such things); throat bare, with a flaring rolled collar behind--a throat like a rose-petal with the moonlight on it; arms bare, save for the upper, triangular sleeves.  It must suffice; I can only say she was adorable. Almost in silence I ate my meal, with her beside me.  Georg went into the house once, to consult the news-tape. It was crowded with Earth events--excitement, confusion everywhere--inconsequential reports, they seemed, by comparison with what had gone before. But of helios from Mars, or Venus, there were none reported. Of Venus, the tape said nothing save that each of our westward stations was vainly calling in turn, as the planet dropped toward its horizon.  I finished my meal--too leisurely for Georg and the doctor; and then we all went into the house, to the insulated room where at last we could talk openly.  As we entered the main corridor, we heard the low voice of the Inter-Allied news-announcer, coming from the disc in a room nearby.  _\"And Venus----\"_  The words caught our attention. We hurried in, and stood by the Inter-Allied equipment. Georg picked up the pile of tape whereon the announcer's words were being printed. He ran back over it.  \"Another helio from Venus!\" he exclaimed. \"Ten minutes ago.\"  And then I saw his lips go tight together. He made no move to hide the tape from Elza, but she was beside him and already reading it. Her fingers switched off the announcer's droning voice.  _\"Pacific Coastal Station,\"_ Elza read. In the sudden silence of the room her voice was low, clear, and steady, though her hands were trembling. _\"P.C.S. 10.42 Venus helio. 'Defeat! Beware Tarrano! Notify your Dr. Brende in Eurasia, danger.'\"_  We men stared at each other. But Elza went on reading.  _\"P.C.S. 10.44 Venus helio. 'Lost! No more! Smashing apparatus!' The Venus sending station went dark at 10.44.30. Hawaiian station will call later, but have little hope of re-establishing connection. Tokyohama 10.46 Official, via Potomac National Headquarters. Excitement here continues. Levels crowded----\"_  Elza dropped the tape. \"That's all of importance. Venus Central Station warning _you_, father.\"  A buzz across the room called the doctor to his personal receiver. It was a message in code from Potomac National Headquarters. We watched the queer-looking characters printing on the tape. Very softly, in a voice hardly above a whisper, Georg decoded it.  _\"Dr. Brende, see P.C.S. 10.42, warning you, probably of Venus immigrants now here. Do you need guard? Or will you come to Washington at once for personal safety?\"_  \"Father!\" cried Elza.  Georg burst out. \"Enough of this. We cannot--dare not talk in here. Father, come----\"  We went out into the corridor again, across which was the small room insulated from all aerial vibrations. In the corridor a figure was standing--the one other member of the Brende household--the maid-servant, a girl about Elza's age. I knew her well, of course, but this evening I had forgotten her existence. She was standing in the corridor. Did I imagine it, or had she been gazing up at the mechanism ten feet above the floor--the mechanism controlling the insulated room?  \"You wish me, Miss Elza? I thought I heard you call.\"  \"No, Ahla, not 'til later.\"  With a gesture of respect, the girl withdrew, passing from our sight down the incline which led to the lower part of the house.  It was a very small incident, but in view of what was transpiring, it gave me a shock nevertheless.  For Elza's maid was a Venus girl!     CHAPTER III  _Spy in the House_   The insulated room was small, with a dome-shaped ceiling, no windows, and but one small, heavy door through which we entered, closing it carefully behind us.  \"At last,\" Dr. Brende exclaimed. \"Now we can talk freely.\"  But I was not satisfied. \"That girl, Ahla--can you trust her?\"  They all looked at me in surprise. When one is close to danger, sometimes one recognizes it least; with Ahla in this household for over a year now, they could not imagine her an enemy.  \"I saw her looking up at the insulator,\" I added swiftly. \"Out there in the corridor. Am I talking wild? Perhaps I am. But she seemed startled; and she was standing just under the insulator, wasn't she?\"  \"But--\" began Elza.  \"Wait,\" I exclaimed. \"When I first saw the President fall, at Park Sixty, I felt that a Venus man had done it. These other murders--they're all the same. Done by Venus men of the Cold Country.\"  \"Ahla's country,\" Elza murmured.  \"Yes. Exactly. And the Venus Central State has been attacked and has fallen. An assassination on Mars, and three here on Earth--all simultaneously. It's one gigantic plot, I tell you--and the Cold Country of Venus is at the bottom of it.\"  Georg jumped to his feet. \"I'll see if the room has been tampered with.\"  He was back presently. \"The insulator is intact. I set the alarm bell. If she touches it--\"  \"Where is she?\"  \"In the cookery, where she should be. I told her we would eat in an hour. That ought to keep her busy.\"  Dr. Brende made an attempt at a smile. \"I think we are all a little overwrought--though with reason, no doubt. Sit down, Jac. Elza, come here by me. Don't look so solemn, child.\"  He drew Elza to him, with his arm about her. I would have spoken, but his gesture checked me. \"I have much to say, Jac. I think I understand these events, perhaps better than any of you. Let me go back two years--when I was in the Venus Central State.\"  I nodded my remembrance; and he went on:  \"At that time the authorities there were greatly perturbed. They were menaced by rebellion in the Cold Country. They would not let the Cold Country people into the Central State, for it is already overcrowded. You did not know that, did you?\"  \"You mean the threatened rebellion?\" I asked. \"They were trying to keep it secret, but we heard rumors.\"  \"Just so. And Jac, I will tell you why they kept it secret. The Central State was encouraging emigration to the Earth. The Venus Cold Country is a poor place to live in--and on a whole its inhabitants are miserable people. Villainous, too, I should say. The Central State did not want them within its borders; and so it kept secret its troubles with them--and encouraged emigration to the Earth.  \"We--as you know--make no distinction between Venus people.

Eventually his uncle Aubrey was restored by Act of Parliament to the earldom, and became the tenth Earl. Kensington had, however, been settled on the widowed Duchess of Ireland, and at her death in 1411 it went to the King. By a special gift in 1420 it was restored to the twelfth Earl. In 1462 he was beheaded by King Edward IV., and his eldest son with him. The thirteenth Earl was restored to the family honours and estates under King Henry VII., but he was forced to part with \"Knotting Barnes or Knotting barnes, sometimes written Notting or Nutting barns.\" This is said to have been more valuable than the original manor itself. It formed the third subordinate manor in Kensington. The thirteenth Earl was succeeded by his nephew, who died young. The titles went to a collateral branch, and the Manor of Kensington was settled on the two widowed Countesses, and later upon three sisters, co-heiresses of the fourteenth Earl.  We have now to trace the histories of the secondary manors after their severance from the main estate. The Abbot's manor still survives in the name of St. Mary Abbots Church. About 1260 it was discovered that Aubrey de Vere had not obtained the consent of the Archbishop of Canterbury or the Bishop of London before granting the manor to the Abbot. Thereupon a great dispute arose as to the Abbot's rights over the land in question, and it was finally decided that the Abbot was to retain half the great tithes, but that the vicarage was to be in the gift of the Bishop of London. The Abbot's manor was leased to William Walwyn in the beginning of the sixteenth century. It afterwards was held by the Grenvilles, who had obtained the reversion. In 1564 the tithes and demesne lands were separated from the manor and rectory, which were still held by the Grenvilles. The tithes passed through the hands of many people in succession, as did also the manor. In 1595 one Robert Horseman was the lessee under the Crown. The Queen sold the estate to Walter (afterwards Sir Walter) Cope, and a special agreement was made by which Robert Horseman still retained his right to live in the manor house. This is important, as it led to the foundation of Holland House by Cope, who had no suitable residence as lord of the manor.  West Town, created out of lands known as the Groves, was granted by the fifth Earl, as we have seen, to his chaplain Simon Downham. This grant is described by Mr. Loftie thus: \"It appears to have been that piece of land which was intercepted between the Abbot's manor and the western border of the parish, and would answer to Addison Road and the land on either side of it.\" Robins, in his \"History of Paddington,\" mentions an inquisition taken in 1481, in which \"The Groves, formerly only three fields, had extended themselves out of Kensington into Brompton, Chelsea, Tybourn, and Westbourne.\"  The manor passed later to William Essex. It was bought from him in 1570 by the Marquis of Winchester, Lord High Treasurer of England. He sold it to William Dodington, who resold it to Christopher Barker, printer to Queen Elizabeth, who was responsible for the \"Breeches\" Bible. It was bought from him by Walter Cope for £1,300.  Knotting Barnes was sold by the thirteenth Earl, whose fortunes had been impoverished by adhesion to the House of Lancaster. It was bought by Sir Reginald Bray, who sold it to the Lady Margaret, Countess of Richmond, mother of King Henry VII. This manor seems to have included lands lying without the precincts of Kensington, for in an indenture entered into by the Lady and the Abbot of Westminster in regard to the disposal of her property we find mentioned \"lands and tenements in Willesden, Padyngton, Westburn, and Kensington, in the countie of Midd., which maners, lands, and tenements the said Princes late purchased of Sir Reynolds Bray knight.\" The Countess left the greater part of her property to the Abbey at Westminster, and part to the two Universities at Oxford and Cambridge. On the spoliation of the monasteries, King Henry VIII. became possessed of the Westminster property; he took up the lease, granting the lessee, Robert White, other lands in exchange, and added it to the hunting-ground he purposed forming on the north and west of London. At his death King Edward VI. inherited it, and leased it to Sir William Paulet. In 1587 it was held by Lord Burghley. In 1599 it was sold to Walter Cope.  Earl's Court or Kensington Manor we traced to the three sisters of the last Earl. One of these died childless, the other two married respectively John Nevill, Lord Latimer; and Sir Anthony Wingfield. Family arrangements were made to prevent the division of the estate, which passed to Lucy Nevill, Lord Latimer's third daughter. She married Sir W. Cornwallis, and left one daughter, Anne, who married Archibald, Earl of Argyll, who joined with her in selling the manor to Sir Walter Cope in 1609. Sir Walter Cope had thus held at one time or another the whole of Kensington. He now possessed Earl's Court, West Town, and Abbot's Manor, having sold Notting Barns some time before. His daughter and heiress married Sir Henry Rich, younger son of the first Earl of Warwick. Further details are given in the account of Holland House (p. 76).  PERAMBULATION.--We will begin at the extreme easterly point of the borough, the toe of the boot which the general outline resembles. We are here in Knightsbridge. The derivation of this word has been much disputed. Many old writers, including Faulkner, have identified it with Kingsbridge--that is to say, the bridge over the Westbourne in the King's high-road. The Westbourne formed the boundary of Chelsea, and flowed across the road opposite Albert Gate. The real King's bridge, however, was not here, but further eastward over the Tyburn, and as far back as Henry I.'s reign it is referred to as Cnightebriga. Another derivation for Knightsbridge is therefore necessary. The old topographer Norden writes: \"Kingsbridge, commonly called Stone bridge, near Hyde Park Corner, where I wish no true man to walk too late without good guard, as did Sir H. Knyvett, Kt., who valiantly defended himself, being assaulted, and slew the master-thief with his own hands.\" This, of course, has reference to the more westerly bridge mentioned above, but it seems to have served as a suggestion to later topographers, who have founded upon it the tradition that two knights on their way to Fulham to be blessed by the Bishop of London quarrelled and fought at the Westbourne Bridge, and killed each other, and hence gave rise to the name. This story may be dismissed as entirely baseless; the real explanation is much less romantic. The word is probably connected with the Manor of Neyt, which was adjacent to Westminster, and as pronunciation rather than orthography was relied upon in early days, this seems much the most likely explanation. Lysons says: \"Adjoining to Knightsbridge were two other ancient manors called Neyt and Hyde.\" We still have the Hyde in Hyde Park, and Neyt is thus identified with Knightsbridge.  Until the middle of the nineteenth century Knightsbridge was an outlying hamlet. People started from Hyde Park Corner in bands for mutual protection at regular intervals, and a bell was rung to warn pedestrians when the party was about to start. In 1778, when Lady Elliot, after the death of her husband, Sir Gilbert, came to Knightsbridge for fresh air, she found it as \"quiet as Teviotdale.\" About forty years before this the Bristol mail was robbed by a man on foot near Knightsbridge. The place has also been the scene of many riots. In 1556, at the time of Wyatt's insurrection, the rebel and his followers arrived at the hamlet at nightfall, and stayed there all night before advancing on London. As already explained, the Borough of Kensington does not include Knightsbridge, but only touches it, and the part we are now in belongs to Westminster.  The Albert Gate leading into the park was erected in 1844-46, and was, of course, called after Prince Albert. The stags on the piers were modelled after prints by Bartolozzi, and were first set up at the Ranger's Lodge in the Green Park. Part of the foundations of the old bridge outside were unearthed at the building of the gate, and, besides this bridge, there was another within the park. The French Embassy, recently enlarged, stands on the east side of the gate--the house formerly belonged to Mr. Hudson, the \"railway king\"--and to the west are several large buildings, a bank, Hyde Park Court, etc., succeeded by a row of houses. Here originally stood a famous old tavern, the Fox and Bull, said to have been founded in the time of Queen Elizabeth; if so, it must have retained its popularity uncommonly long, for it was noted for its gay company in the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. It is referred to in the _Tatler_ (No. 259), and was visited by Sir Joshua Reynolds and George Morland, the former of whom painted the sign, which hung until 1807. It is said that the Elizabethan house had wonderfully carved ceilings and immense fire-dogs, still in use in 1799. The inn was later the receiving office of the Royal Humane Society, and to it was brought the body of Shelley's wife after she had drowned herself in the Serpentine.  In the open space opposite is an equestrian statue of Hugh Rose--Lord Strathnairn--by Onslow Ford, R.A. Close by is a little triangular strip of green, which goes by the dignified name of Knightsbridge Green. It has a dismal reminiscence, having been a burial-pit for those who died of the plague. The last maypole was on the green in 1800, and the pound-house remained until 1835.  The entrance to Tattersall's overlooks the green. This famous horse-mart was founded by Richard Tattersall, who had been stud-groom to the last Duke of Kingston. He started a horse market in 1766 at Hyde Park Corner, and his son carried it on after him. Rooms were fitted up at the market for the use of the Jockey Club, which held its meetings there"]]]
