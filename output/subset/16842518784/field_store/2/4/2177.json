And his headquarters in the fertile Santa Cruz Valley was a ranch which was also a fort, a fort even the Apaches avoided after they had suffered two overwhelming defeats there.  That was Rennie’s Range—cultivated fields, fruit orchards, _manadas_ of fine horses. _Don_ Cazar supplied Tucson and the army posts with vegetables and superb hams. He had organized a matchless company of Pima Indian Scouts after the army pulled out in ’61, had fought Apaches, but had sided with neither Union nor Confederate forces. During the war years he had more or less withdrawn within the borders of the Range, offering refuge to settlers and miners fleeing Indian attacks. _Don_ Cazar was a legend now, and a man did not quickly claim kinship with a legend.  \"Want a room, Kirby?\" Topham paused beside his table.  \"No. I have to stay close to the mare.\"  \"Yes. I can understand that. Kells is good with horses, so you needn’t worry. Ever raced that colt of yours?\"  \"Not officially.\" Drew smiled. There was that lieutenant with the supply wagons. The man hadn’t talked so loudly about Johnny Rebs after Shiloh showed his heels to the roan the soldiers had bragged up.  \"This is a sporting town when the wagons come in, and they’re due tomorrow. Johnny Shannon just rode in to report. Might be some racing. You aim to stay on in Tubacca?\"  \"Have to until Shadow can trail again. How’s the prospect for a job?\"  \"With cattle—horses—teaming?\"  \"Horses, I guess.\"  \"Well, _Don_ Cazar—Rennie—runs the best _manadas_. You might hit him for work. He’ll be riding in to meet the wagons. Carmencita, did you bring all that was left of the supplies?\" Topham’s quizzical eyebrows lifted in greeting to the waitress’s loaded tray. \"I’d say, young man, that you are facing a full-time job now, getting all that inside of you.\"  Drew ate steadily, consuming eggs and beans, tortillas, and fruit. Topham joined three men at the next table, substantial town citizens, Drew judged. The owner of the cantina raised his glass.  \"Gentlemen, I give you another successful trading trip!\"  \"Saw Johnny ride in,\" one of the men returned. \"Kid seems to be settlin’ down, ain’t he? That ought to be good news for Rennie.\"  \"One believes in reformations when they are proven by time, _Señor_ Cahill,\" the man wearing rich but somber Spanish clothing replied.  \"It sure must go hard with a man to have his son turn out a wild one,\" commented the third.  Drew’s cup was at his lips, but he did not drink. Whose son? Rennie’s?  \"No son by blood, that much comfort _Don_ Cazar has. But foster ties are also strong. And the boy is still very young—\"  \"A rattler with only one button on the tail carries as much poison as a ten-button one. Rennie ought to cut losses and give that kid the boot. The way he’s going he could involve Hunt in a real mess,\" Cahill said.  \"You are _Don_ Cazar’s good friend, _Don_ Reese, his _compadre_ of many years. Can you not do something?\"  \"_Don_ Lorenzo, all men have blind spots. And Johnny Shannon is Rennie’s. Bob Shannon helped free Hunt out of Mex prison in the war and was killed doing it. Soon as Hunt set up here he sent for the boy and tried to give him a father.\"  \"It is a great pity he has no child of his own blood. I have seen him stand here in Tubacca giving toys and candy to the little ones. Yet he has only this wild one under his roof, and perhaps that Juanito will break his heart in the end....\"  Drew put down his cup. It was very hard not to turn and ask questions. Dropping some coins on the table, he rose and started back to the stable, to the world of Shiloh and Shadow where he was unable to betray Drew Rennie. But there was so much Drew Kirby must learn—and soon!      2   Two lighted lanterns hung from pegs along the center of the stable, and Callie had mounted a barrel to put up a third as Drew entered. There were the soft peaceful sounds of horses crunching fodder, hoofs rustling in straw. Shadow turned her head and nickered as Drew came up to her box stall. She was answered by a blowing from Shiloh, a bray out of Croaker.  \"It’s all right, girl—pretty lady—\" Drew fondled her mane, stroked the satin-smooth arch of neck. Callie dropped from his barrel perch.  \"She sure is right purty, Mister Kirby. Mister Kells said as to tell you he’s sleepin’ on a cot in th’ tack room over there, should you be needin’ him.\" Callie pointed. \"Me, I’m beddin’ down in the last stall. I put your gear up right over here, so’s you can hear if she gits to movin’—\"  \"Thanks.\" Drew felt in a pocket, tossed Callie the coin his fingers found.  The boy caught the piece, his eyes round as he looked at it. \"Lordy! Thanks, Mister Kirby! You must be near as shiny as _Don_ Cazar—or Mister Topham!\"  \"Shiny?\"  Callie laughed. \"Silver-shiny! Ain’t too many men as goes round Tubacca throwin’ out good money thataway. ’Less it’s ringin’ down on th’ bar, or slidin’ ’cross some table ’cause they found out as how they was holdin’ Jacks against some other fella’s Kings. You want anything—you jus’ holler, Mister Kirby!\"  \"Mister?\" Drew thought he did not have the advantage of Callie by more than four or five years.  \"Oh—Captain Kirby, maybe? Or Lieutenant? Johnny Shannon—now he was a lieutenant with Howard’s Rangers.\" Callie gave Drew a shrewd measuring look.  \"Sergeant.\" Drew corrected automatically and then asked: \"How did you know I’d been in the army?\"  \"Well, you wear them two shootin’ irons army style, belted high an’ butt to front. Must use a flip-hand draw as do all th’ hoss soldiers. Listen, Mister Kirby, iffen you rode with th’ Rebs, you better keep your lip buttoned up when th’ Blue Bellies hit town. There’s been a pile of fightin’ an’ folks is gittin’ mad ’bout it—\"  \"Blue Bellies?\" Drew was wrenched back months, a year, by that old army slang. \"Union troops stationed here?\" He had unconsciously tensed, his body responding nerve and muscle to past training and alarms. But there were no Yanks or Rebs any more, no riders or marchers in blue and gray—just United States troops.  \"There’s a garrison out to the Mesa camp. An’ Cap’n Bayliss, he don’t take kindly to Rebs. You see, it’s this way.... Out in th’ breaks there’s a bunch of Rebs-leastways they claim as how they’s Rebs—still holdin’ out. They hit an’ run, raidin’ ranches an’ mines; they held up a coach a while back. An’ so far they’ve ridden rings round th’ cap’n. Now he thinks as how any Reb blowin’ in town could be one of ’em, comin’ to sniff out some good pickin’s. So anyone as can’t explain hisself proper to th’ cap’n gits locked up out at camp till he can—\"  \"Trifle highhanded, ain’t he?\"  \"Well, th’ cap’n’s for law an’ order, an’ he’s army. But folks ain’t likin’ it too much. So far he’s been doin’ it though.\"  Drew frowned. So even this far away from the scene of old battles the war still smoldered; the black bitterness of defeat was made harder by the victor. Drew’s hand rubbed across the bulge beneath his shirt. In one pocket of the money belt were his papers, among them the parole written out in Gainesville which could prove he had ridden with General Forrest’s command, far removed from any Arizona guerrilla force. But to produce that would change Drew Kirby to Drew Rennie, and that he did not want to do.  \"I rode with General Forrest, attached to General Buford’s Scouts,\" he said absently.  \"General Forrest!\" Callie glowed. \"Lordy, Mister Kirby, that’s sure somethin’, it sure is! Only don’t be sayin’ that round Cap’n Bayliss neither. He has him a big hate for General Forrest—seems like Bayliss was a colonel once till th’ General outsmarted him back east. An’ there was a big smoke-up ’bout it. They cut th’ cap’n’s spurs for him, an’ he ended th’ war out here. Now he ain’t no patient man; he’s th’ kind as uses his hooks hard when he’s ridin’.  \"You know, you sure can tell a lot ’bout a man when you give a look at his hoss after he’s come off th’ trail. That there Shiloh colt o’ yours, an’ this here lady hoss, an’ that old mule ... anyone can see as how they’s always been handled nice an’ easy. They ain’t got no spite ’gainst nobody as wants to rub ’em down an’ give ’em a feed. But some hosses what git brung in here—they’s white-eyed an’ randy, does you give ’em a straight stare. For that there’s always a reason. Mostly you can see what it is when you look good an’ steady at th’ men who was ridin’ ’em!\"  Drew laughed. \"Glad I passed your test, Callie. Guess I’ll turn in now. Been a long day travelin’—\"  \"Sure thing. An’ from up there you can hear this little old mare, does she need you.\"  The Kentuckian’s pack had been hoisted into the mow, and Callie had even humped up the fragrant hay to mattress his bedroll. A window was open to the night, and as Drew stretched out wearily, he could hear the distant tinkle of a guitar, perhaps from the Four Jacks. Somewhere a woman began to sing, and the liquid Spanish words lulled him asleep.    He roused suddenly, his hand flashing under his head before he returned to full consciousness, fingers tightening on the Colt he had placed there. Not the mare—no—rather the pound of running feet and then a cry....  \"No, _señor_, no! _No es verdad_—it is not true! Teodoro, he meant no harm—!\"  Drew scrambled to the window. Out in the alley below, three figures reeled in the circle of light afforded by the door lantern. The Kentuckian marked the upward swing of a quirt lash, saw a smaller shape fling up an arm in a vain attempt to ward off the blow. Another, the one who cried out, was belaboring the flogger with empty fists, and the voice was that of a girl!  To slide down the loft ladder was again nearer instinct than planned action. Shiloh snorted as Drew’s boots rapped on the stable floor. The Kentuckian had no idea of the reason for that fight, but he ran out with the vague notion that an impartial referee was needed.  \"You there—what’s goin’ on!\" Sergeant Rennie came to life again in the snapped demand.

Those would be precisely the cases      with which psychical research would deal.   This conception of mental action forms, as will be seen, the foundation of the theory of dreams which Professor Bergson first presented in a lecture before the _Institut psychologique_, March 26, 1901. It was published in the _Revue scientifique_ of June 8, 1901. An English translation, revised by the author and printed in _The Independent_ of October 23 and 30, 1913, here appears for the first time in book form.  In this essay Professor Bergson made several contributions to our knowledge of dreams. He showed, in the first place, that dreaming is not so unlike the ordinary process of perception as had been hitherto supposed. Both use sense impressions as crude material to be molded and defined by the aid of memory images. Here, too, he set forth the idea, which he, so far as I know, was the first to formulate, that sleep is a state of disinterestedness, a theory which has since been adopted by several psychologists. In this address, also, was brought into consideration for the first time the idea that the self may go through different degrees of tension--a theory referred to in his _Matter and Memory_.  Its chief interest for the general reader will, however, lie in the explanation it gives him of the cause of some of his familiar dreams. He may by practice become the interpreter of his own visions and so come to an understanding of the vagaries of that mysterious and inseparable companion, his dream-self.                                               EDWIN E. SLOSSON.    NEW YORK CITY,   FEBRUARY 10, 1914.     DREAMS   The subject which I have to discuss here is so complex, it raises so many questions of all kinds, difficult, obscure, some psychological, others physiological and metaphysical; in order to be treated in a complete manner it requires such a long development--and we have so little space, that I shall ask your permission to dispense with all preamble, to set aside unessentials, and to go at once to the heart of the question.  A dream is this. I perceive objects and there is nothing there. I see men; I seem to speak to them and I hear what they answer; there is no one there and I have not spoken. It is all _as if_ real things and real persons were there, then on waking all has disappeared, both persons and things. How does this happen?  But, first, is it true that there is nothing there? I mean, is there not presented a certain sense material to our eyes, to our ears, to our touch, etc., during sleep as well as during waking?  Close the eyes and look attentively at what goes on in the field of our vision. Many persons questioned on this point would say that nothing goes on, that they see nothing. No wonder at this, for a certain amount of practise is necessary to be able to observe oneself satisfactorily. But just give the requisite effort of attention, and you will distinguish, little by little, many things. First, in general, a black background. Upon this black background occasionally brilliant points which come and go, rising and descending, slowly and sedately. More often, spots of many colors, sometimes very dull, sometimes, on the contrary, with certain people, so brilliant that reality cannot compare with it. These spots spread and shrink, changing form and color, constantly displacing one another. Sometimes the change is slow and gradual, sometimes again it is a whirlwind of vertiginous rapidity. Whence comes all this phantasmagoria? The physiologists and the psychologists have studied this play of colors. \"Ocular spectra,\" \"colored spots,\" \"phosphenes,\" such are the names that they have given to the phenomenon. They explain it either by the slight modifications which occur ceaselessly in the retinal circulation, or by the pressure that the closed lid exerts upon the eyeball, causing a mechanical excitation of the optic nerve. But the explanation of the phenomenon and the name that is given to it matters little. It occurs universally and it constitutes--I may say at once--the principal material of which we shape our dreams, \"such stuff as dreams are made on.\"  Thirty or forty years ago, M. Alfred Maury and, about the same time, M. d'Hervey, of St. Denis, had observed that at the moment of falling asleep these colored spots and moving forms consolidate, fix themselves, take on definite outlines, the outlines of the objects and of the persons which people our dreams. But this is an observation to be accepted with caution, since it emanates from psychologists already half asleep. More recently an American psychologist, Professor Ladd, of Yale, has devised a more rigorous method, but of difficult application, because it requires a sort of training. It consists in acquiring the habit on awakening in the morning of keeping the eyes closed and retaining for some minutes the dream that is fading from the field of vision and soon would doubtless have faded from that of memory. Then one sees the figures and objects of the dream melt away little by little into phosphenes, identifying themselves with the colored spots that the eye really perceives when the lids are closed. One reads, for example, a newspaper; that is the dream. One awakens and there remains of the newspaper, whose definite outlines are erased, only a white spot with black marks here and there; that is the reality. Or our dream takes us upon the open sea--round about us the ocean spreads its waves of yellowish gray with here and there a crown of white foam. On awakening, it is all lost in a great spot, half yellow and half gray, sown with brilliant points. The spot was there, the brilliant points were there. There was really presented to our perceptions, in sleep, a visual dust, and it was this dust which served for the fabrication of our dreams.  Will this alone suffice? Still considering the sensation of sight, we ought to add to these visual sensations which we may call internal all those which continue to come to us from an external source. The eyes, when closed, still distinguish light from shade, and even, to a certain extent, different lights from one another. These sensations of light, emanating from without, are at the bottom of many of our dreams. A candle abruptly lighted in the room will, for example, suggest to the sleeper, if his slumber is not too deep, a dream dominated by the image of fire, the idea of a burning building. Permit me to cite to you two observations of M. Tissié on this subject:  \"B---- Léon dreams that the theater of Alexandria is on _fire_; the flame lights up the whole place. All of a sudden he finds himself transported to the midst of the fountain in the public square; a line of _fire_ runs along the chains which connect the great posts placed around the margin. Then he finds himself in Paris at the exposition, which is on _fire_. He takes part in terrible scenes, etc. He wakes with a start; his eyes catch the rays of light projected by the dark lantern which the night nurse flashes toward his bed in passing. M---- Bertrand dreams that he is in the marine infantry where he formerly served. He goes to Fort-de-France, to Toulon, to Loriet, to Crimea, to Constantinople. He sees lightning, he hears thunder, he takes part in a combat in which he sees _fire_ leap from the mouths of cannon. He wakes with a start. Like B., he was wakened by a flash of light projected from the dark lantern of the night nurse.\" Such are often the dreams provoked by a bright and sudden light.  Very different are those which are suggested by a mild and continuous light like that of the moon. A. Krauss tells how one day on awakening he perceived that he was extending his arm toward what in his dream appeared to him to be the image of a young girl. Little by little this image melted into that of the full moon which darted its rays upon him. It is a curious thing that one might cite other examples of dreams where the rays of the moon, caressing the eyes of the sleeper, evoked before him virginal apparitions. May we not suppose that such might have been the origin in antiquity of the fable of Endymion--Endymion the shepherd, lapped in perpetual slumber, for whom the goddess Selene, that is, the moon, is smitten with love while he sleeps?  I have spoken of visual sensations. They are the principal ones. But the auditory sensations nevertheless play a rôle. First, the ear has also its internal sensations, sensations of buzzing, of tinkling, of whistling, difficult to isolate and to perceive while awake, but which are clearly distinguished in sleep. Besides that we continue, when once asleep, to hear external sounds. The creaking of furniture, the crackling of the fire, the rain beating against the window, the wind playing its chromatic scale in the chimney, such are the sounds which come to the ear of the sleeper and which the dream converts, according to circumstances, into conversation, singing, cries, music, etc. Scissors were struck against the tongs in the ears of Alfred Maury while he slept. Immediately he dreamt that he heard the tocsin and took part in the events of June, 1848. Such observations and experiences are numerous. But let us hasten to say that sounds do not play in our dreams so important a rôle as colors. Our dreams are, above all, visual, and even more visual than we think. To whom has it not happened--as M. Max Simon has remarked--to talk in a dream with a certain person, to dream a whole conversation, and then, all of a sudden, a singular phenomenon strikes the attention of the dreamer. He perceives that he does not speak, that he has not spoken, that his interlocutor has not uttered a single word, that it was a simple exchange of thought between them, a very clear conversation, in which, nevertheless, nothing has been heard. The phenomenon is easily enough explained. It is in general necessary "]]]
