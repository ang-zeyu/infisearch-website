Dragging her violently on deck, they were about to cast her into the sea, when Buzzby, who stood with his hands bound, suddenly burst his bonds and sprang towards her.  A blow from the butt of a pistol, however, stretched him insensible on the deck.  \"Where is my husband?--my boy?\" screamed Mrs Ellice wildly.  \"They've gone before you, or they'll soon follow,\" said a savage fiercely, as he raised her in his powerful arms, and hurled her overboard.  A loud shriek was followed by a heavy plunge.  At the same moment two of the men raised the captain, intending to throw him overboard also, when a loud boom arrested their attention, and a cannon-shot ploughed up the sea close in front of their bows.  While the fight was raging, no one had observed the fact that the breeze had freshened, and a large man-of-war, with American colours at her peak, was now within gunshot of the ship.  No sooner did the pirates make this discovery than they rushed to their boats, with the intention of pulling to their schooner, but those who had been left in charge, seeing the approach of the man-of-war, and feeling that there was no chance of escape for their comrades, or, as is more than probable, being utterly indifferent about them, crowded all sail, and slipped away, and it was now hull-down on the horizon to leeward.  The men in the boats rowed after her with the energy of despair, but the Americans gave chase, and we need scarcely add that, in a very short time, all were captured.  When the man-of-war rejoined the West-Indiaman, the night had set in and a stiff breeze had arisen, so that the long and laborious search that was made for the body of poor Mrs Ellice, proved utterly fruitless. Captain Ellice, whose wound was very severe, was struck down as if by a thunderbolt, and for a long time his life was despaired of.  During his illness Fred nursed him with the utmost tenderness, and, in seeking to comfort his father, found some relief to his own stricken heart.  Months passed away.  Captain Ellice was conveyed to the residence of his sister in Grayton, and, under her care, and the nursing of his little niece, Isobel, he recovered his wonted health and strength.  To the eyes of men, Captain Ellice and his son were themselves again, but those who judge of men's hearts by their outward appearance and expressions, in nine cases out of ten judge very wide of the mark indeed.  Both had undergone a great change.  The brilliancy and glitter of this world had been completely and rudely dispelled, and both had been led to enquire whether there was not something better to live for than mere present advantage and happiness; something that would stand by them in those hours of sickness and sorrow which must inevitably, sooner or later, come upon all men.  But Captain Ellice could not be induced to resume the command of his old ship, or voyage again to the West Indies.  He determined to change the scene of his future labours and sail to the frozen seas, where the aspect of every object--even the ocean itself--would be very unlikely to recall the circumstances of his loss.  Some time after his recovery, Captain Ellice purchased a brig, and fitted her out as a whaler, determined to try his fortune in the northern seas.  Fred pleaded hard to be taken out, but his father felt that he had more need to go to school than to sea; so he refused, and Fred, after sighing very deeply once or twice, gave in with a good grace.  Buzzby, too, who stuck to his old commander like a leech, was equally anxious to go, but Buzzby, in a sudden and unaccountable fit of tenderness, had, just two months before, married a wife, who might be appropriately described as \"fat, fair, and forty,\" and Buzzby's wife absolutely forbade him to go.  Alas!  Buzzby was no longer his own master.  At the age of forty-five he became--as he himself expressed it--an abject slave, and he would as soon have tried to steer in a slipper bath, right in the teeth of an equinoctial hurricane, as have opposed the will of his wife.  He used to sigh gruffly when spoken to on this subject, and compare himself to a Dutch galliot that made more lee-way than head-way, even with a wind on the quarter.  \"Once,\" he would remark, \"I was clipper-built and could sail right in the wind's eye, but ever since I tuck this craft in tow I've gone to leeward like a tub.  In fact, I find there's only one way of going ahead with my Poll, and that is right before the wind!  I used to yaw about a good deal at first, but she tuck that out o' me in a day or two.  If I put the helm only so much as one stroke to starboard, she guv' a tug at the tow-rope that brought the wind dead aft again; so I've gi'n it up, and lashed the tiller right amidships.\"  So Buzzby did not accompany his old commander; he did not even so much as suggest the possibility of it, but he shook his head with great solemnity as he stood with Fred, and Mrs Bright, and Isobel, at the end of the pier, gazing at the brig, with one eye very much screwed up, and a wistful expression in the other, while the graceful craft spread out her canvas and bent over to the breeze.    CHAPTER TWO.  DEPARTURE OF THE POLE STAR FOR THE FROZEN SEAS--SAGE REFLECTIONS OF MRS. BRIGHT, AND SAGACIOUS REMARKS OF BUZZBY--ANXIETIES, FEARS, SURMISES, AND RESOLUTIONS--ISOBEL--A SEARCH PROPOSED--DEPARTURE OF THE DOLPHIN FOR THE FAR NORTH.  Digressions are bad at the best, and we feel some regret that we should have been compelled to begin our book with one; but they are necessary evils, sometimes, so we must ask our reader's forgiveness, and beg him, or her, to remember that we are still at the commencement of our story, standing at the end of the pier, and watching the departure of the _Pole Star_ whale-ship, which is now a scarcely distinguishable speck on the horizon.  As it disappeared Buzzby gave a grunt, Fred and Isobel uttered a sigh in unison, and Mrs Bright resumed the fit of weeping which for some time she had unconsciously suspended.  \"I fear we shall never see him again,\" sobbed Mrs Bright, as she took Isobel by the hand and sauntered slowly home, accompanied by Fred and Buzzby, the latter of whom seemed to regard himself in the light of a shaggy Newfoundland or mastiff, who had been left to protect the family. \"We are always hearing of whale-ships being lost, and, somehow or other, we _never_ hear of the crews being saved, as one reads of when ships are wrecked in the usual way on the sea-shore.\"  Isobel squeezed her mother's hand, and looked up in her face with an expression that said plainly: \"Don't cry so, Mamma, I'm _sure_ he will come back,\" but she could not find words to express herself, so she glanced towards the mastiff for help.  Buzzby felt that it devolved upon him to afford consolation under the circumstances, but Mrs Bright's mind was of that peculiar stamp which repels advances in the way of consolation unconsciously, and Buzzby was puzzled.  He screwed up first the right eye and then the left, and smote his thigh repeatedly; and assuredly, if contorting his visage could have comforted Mrs Bright, she would have returned home a happy woman, for he made faces at her violently for full five minutes; but it did her no good, perhaps because she didn't see him, her eyes being suffused with tears.  \"Ah! yes,\" resumed Mrs Bright, with another burst, \"I _know_ they will never come back, and your silence shows that you think so too; and to think of their taking two years' provisions with them _in case of accidents_!--doesn't that prove that there are _going_ to be accidents? and didn't I hear one of the sailors say that she was a crack ship, a number one?  I don't know what he meant by a number one; but if she's a cracked ship I _know_ she will never come back; and although I told my dear brother of it, and advised him not to go, he only laughed at me, which was very unkind, I'm sure--\"  Here Mrs Bright's feelings overcame her again.  \"Why, Aunt,\" said Fred, scarce able to restrain a laugh, despite the sadness that lay at his heart, \"when the sailor said it was a crack ship, he meant that it was a _good_ one, a first-rate one.\"  \"Then why did he not say what he meant?  But you are talking nonsense, boy; do you think that I will believe a man means to say a thing is good when he calls it cracked? and I'm sure nobody would say a cracked tea-pot was as good as a whole one; but tell me, Buzzby, do you think they ever _will_ come back?\"  \"Why, ma'am, in coorse I do,\" replied Buzzby vehemently; \"for why? if they don't, they're the first that ever went out o' this port in my day as didn't.  They've a good ship and lots o' grub, and it's like to be a good season; and Captain Ellice has, for the most part, good luck; and they've started with a fair wind, and kep' clear of a Friday, and what more could ye wish?  I only wish as I was aboard along with them, that's all.\"  Buzzby delivered himself of this oration with the left eye shut and screwed up, and the right one open.  Having concluded, he shut and screwed up the right eye, and opened the left--he reversed the engine, so to speak, as if he wished to back out from the scene of his triumph, and leave the course clear for others to speak.  But his words were thrown away on Mrs Bright, who was emphatically a weak-minded woman, and never exercised her reason at all, except in a spasmodic, galvanic sort of way, when she sought to defend or to advocate some unreasonable conclusion of some sort, at which her own weak mind had arrived somehow. So she shook her head, and sobbed good-bye to Buzzby, as she ascended the sloping avenue that led to her pretty cottage, on the green hill that overlooked the harbour and the sea beyond.  As for John Buzzby, having been absent from home full half an hour beyond his usual dinner-hour, he felt that, for a man who had lashed his helm amidships, he "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21712"],["title","The Young Fur Traders (#1)"],["body","state of my health is such as to render it expedient for me to retire from the service, and I herewith beg to hand in my resignation.  I shall hope to be relieved early next spring.--I have the honour to be, gentlemen, your most obedient humble servant, F. KENNEDY.  \"There!\" exclaimed the old gentleman, in a tone that would lead one to suppose he had signed the death-warrant, and so had irrevocably fixed the certain destruction, of the entire council--\"there!\" said he, rising from his chair, and sticking the quill into the ink-bottle with a _dab_ that split it up to the feather, and so rendered it _hors de combat_ for all time coming.  To this letter the council gave a short reply, accepting his resignation, and appointing a successor.  On the following spring old Mr Kennedy embarked his wife and children in a bark canoe, and in process of time landed them safely in Red River Settlement.  Here he purchased a house with six acres of land, in which he planted a variety of useful vegetables, and built a summer-house after the fashion of a conservatory, where he was wont to solace himself for hours together with a pipe, or rather with dozens of pipes, of Canada twist tobacco.  After this he put his two children to school.  The settlement was at this time fortunate in having a most excellent academy, which was conducted by a very estimable man.  Charles and Kate Kennedy, being obedient and clever, made rapid progress under his judicious management, and the only fault that he had to find with the young people was that Kate was a little too quiet and fond of books, while Charley was a little too riotous and fond of fun.  When Charles arrived at the age of fifteen and Kate attained to fourteen years, old Mr Kennedy went into his conservatory, locked the door, sat down on an easy-chair, filled a long clay pipe with his beloved tobacco, smoked vigorously for ten minutes, and fell fast asleep.  In this condition he remained until the pipe fell from his lips and broke in fragments on the floor.  He then rose, filled another pipe, and sat down to meditate on the subject that had brought him to his smoking apartment.  \"There's my wife,\" said he, looking at the bowl of his pipe, as if he were addressing himself to it, \"she's getting too old to be looking after everything herself (_puff_), and Kate's getting too old to be humbugging any longer with books; besides, she ought to be at home learning to keep house, and help her mother, and cut the baccy (_puff_), and that young scamp Charley should be entering the service (_puff_). He's clever enough now to trade beaver and bears from the red-skins; besides, he's (_puff_) a young rascal, and I'll be bound does nothing but lead the other boys into (_puff_) mischief, although, to be sure, the master _does_ say he's the cleverest fellow in the school; but he must be reined up a bit now.  I'll clap on a double curb and martingale. I'll get him a situation in the counting-room at the fort (_puff_), where he'll have his nose held tight to the grindstone.  Yes, I'll fix both their flints to-morrow;\" and old Mr Kennedy gave vent to another puff so thick and long that it seemed as if all the previous puffs had concealed themselves up to this moment within his capacious chest, and rushed out at last in one thick and long-continued stream.  By \"fixing their flints\" Mr Kennedy meant to express the fact that he intended to place his children in an entirely new sphere of action; and with a view to this he ordered out his horse and cariole [A sort of sleigh.] on the following morning, went up to the school, which was about ten miles distant from his abode, and brought his children home with him the same evening.  Kate was now formally installed as housekeeper and tobacco-cutter; while Charley was told that his future destiny was to wield the quill in the service of the Hudson's Bay Company, and that he might take a week to think over it.  Quiet, warm-hearted, affectionate Kate was overjoyed at the thought of being a help and comfort to her old father and mother; but reckless, joyous, good-humoured, hare-brained Charley was cast into the depths of despair at the idea of spending the livelong day, and day after day, for years it might be, on the top of a long-legged stool.  In fact, poor Charley said that he \"would rather become a buffalo than do it.\"  Now this was very wrong of Charley, for, of course, he didn't _mean_ it.  Indeed, it is too much a habit among little boys, ay, and among grown-up people too, to say what they don't mean, as no doubt you are aware, dear reader, if you possess half the self-knowledge we give you credit for; and we cannot too strongly remonstrate with ourself and others against the practice--leading, as it does, to all sorts of absurd exaggerations, such as gravely asserting that we are \"broiling hot\" when we are simply \"rather warm,\" or more than \"half dead\" with fatigue when we are merely \"very tired.\"  However, Charley _said_ that he would rather be \"a buffalo than do it,\" and so we feel bound in honour to record the fact.  Charley and Kate were warmly attached to each other.  Moreover, they had been, ever since they could walk, in the habit of mingling their little joys and sorrows in each other's bosoms; and although, as years flew past, they gradually ceased to sob in each other's arms at every little mishap, they did not cease to interchange their inmost thoughts, and to mingle their tears when occasion called them forth.  They knew the power, the inexpressible sweetness, of sympathy.  They understood experimentally the comfort and joy that flow from obedience to that blessed commandment to \"rejoice with those that do rejoice, and weep with those that weep.\"  It was natural, therefore, that on Mr Kennedy announcing his decrees, Charley and Kate should hasten to some retired spot where they could commune in solitude; the effect of which communing was to reduce them to a somewhat calmer and rather happy state of mind. Charley's sorrow was blunted by sympathy with Kate's joy, and Kate's joy was subdued by sympathy with Charley's sorrow; so that, after the first effervescing burst, they settled down into a calm and comfortable state of flatness, with very red eyes and exceedingly pensive minds.  We must, however, do Charley the justice to say that the red eyes applied only to Kate; for although a tear or two could without much coaxing be induced to hop over his sun-burned cheek, he had got beyond that period of life when boys are addicted to (we must give the word, though not pretty, because it is eminently expressive) _blubbering_.  A week later found Charley and his sister seated on the lump of blue ice where they were first introduced to the reader, and where Charley announced his unalterable resolve to run away, following it up with the statement that _that_ was \"the end of it.\"  He was quite mistaken, however, for that was by no means the end of it.  In fact it was only the beginning of it, as we shall see hereafter.    CHAPTER TWO.  THE OLD FUR-TRADER ENDEAVOURS TO \"FIX\" HIS SON'S \"FLINT,\" AND FINDS THE THING MORE DIFFICULT TO DO THAN HE EXPECTED.  Near the centre of the colony of Red River, the stream from which the settlement derives its name is joined by another, called the Assiniboine.  About five or six hundred yards from the point where this union takes place, and on the banks of the latter stream, stands the Hudson's Bay Company's trading-post, Fort Garry.  It is a massive square building of stone.  Four high and thick walls enclose a space of ground on which are built six or eight wooden houses, some of which are used as dwellings for the servants of the Hudson's Bay Company, and others as stores, wherein are contained the furs, the provisions which are sent annually to various parts of the country, and the goods (such as cloth, guns, powder and shot, blankets, twine, axes, knives, etcetera, etcetera,) with which the fur-trade is carried on.  Although Red River is a peaceful colony, and not at all likely to be assaulted by the poor Indians, it was, nevertheless, deemed prudent by the traders to make some show of power; and so at the corners of the fort four round bastions of a very imposing appearance were built, from the embrasures of which several large black-muzzled guns protruded.  No one ever conceived the idea of firing these engines of war; and, indeed, it is highly probable that such an attempt would have been attended with consequences much more dreadful to those _behind_ than to those who might chance to be in front of the guns.  Nevertheless they were imposing, and harmonised well with the flagstaff, which was the only other military symptom about the place.  This latter was used on particular occasions, such as the arrival or departure of a brigade of boats, for the purpose of displaying the folds of a red flag on which were the letters H.B.C.  The fort stood, as we have said, on the banks of the Assiniboine River, on the opposite side of which the land was somewhat wooded, though not heavily, with oak, maple, poplar, aspens, and willows; while at the back of the fort the great prairie rolled out like a green sea to the horizon, and far beyond that again to the base of the Rocky Mountains. The plains at this time, however, were a sheet of unbroken snow, and the river a mass of solid ice.  It was noon on the day following that on which our friend Charley had threatened rebellion, when a tall elderly man might have been seen standing at the back gate of Fort Garry, gazing wistfully out into the prairie in the direction of the lower part of the settlement.  He was watching a small speck which moved rapidly over the snow in the direction of the fort.  \"It's very like our friend Frank Kennedy,\" said he to himself (at least we presume so, for there was no one else within earshot to whom he could have said it, except the door-post, which every one knows is proverbially a deaf subject).  \"No man in the settlement drives so furiously.
