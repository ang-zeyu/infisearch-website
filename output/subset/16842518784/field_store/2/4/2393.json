Nay, we owe an apology to the pigs for the comparison.  _Sties_ appear to be places of abode suited to the nature and tastes of their occupants, and the grumps who inhabit them seem not only to rejoice in them (for this alone would be no argument, inasmuch as the same may be affirmed of men who rejoice in low taverns), but to be utterly incapable of higher enjoyment out of them.  Let a pig out of his stye, afford him every conceivable opportunity of intellectual and physical improvement, and he will carefully search out the nearest mudhole--unhappy until he finds it--will thrust not only his nose but his body into it, and will find supreme enjoyment in wallowing in the mire; and no blame to him for this; he is grumpish by nature.  Yes, a low tavern is beneath the level of a pig-stye!  Nevertheless, as it is possible that, _for a time_, man may, through sin, or circumstances, or both, be reduced to such a condition as to take shelter in a pig-stye, without exposing himself to the charge of being a pig; so, it is possible that a man may frequent a low tavern, _not_ without detriment, but, without becoming thereby worthy of being classed with the lowest of the low.  Do not misunderstand us, gentle reader.  We do not wish in the slightest degree to palliate the coarse language, the debasement, the harsh villainy, which shock the virtuous when visiting the haunts of poverty.  Our simple desire is to assure the sceptical that goodness and truth are sometimes found in strange questionable places, although it is undoubtedly true that they do not deliberately search out such places for an abode, but prefer a pure atmosphere and pleasant companionship if they can get it.  It must not be supposed, then, that our friend John Bax--sometimes called \"captain,\" sometimes \"skipper,\" not unfrequently \"mister,\" but most commonly \"Bax,\" without any modification--was a hopeless castaway, because he was found by his friend Guy Foster in a room full of careless foul-mouthed seamen, eating his bread and cheese and drinking his beer in an atmosphere so impregnated with tobacco smoke that he could scarcely see, and so redolent of gin that he could scarcely smell the smoke!  In those days there were not so many sailors' homes and temperance coffee-houses as there are now.  In the locality about which we write there were none.  If Jack wanted his lunch or his dinner he found the low tavern almost the only place in which he could get it comfortably. Tobacco smoke was no objection to him;--he rather liked it.  Swearing did not shock him;--he was used to it.  Gentle folk are apt to err here too.  Being _shocked_ at gross sin does not necessarily imply goodness of heart; it implies nothing more than the being unused to witness gross sin.  Goodness of heart _may_ go along with this capacity of being shocked, so, equally, may badness of heart; but neither of them is implied by it.  What a grand thing is truth--simple abstract truth! and yet how little do we appreciate it in regard to the inconceivably important matter of _reasoning_.  We analyse our chemicals and subject them to the severest tests in order to ascertain their true properties;--truth is all we aim at; but how many of us can say that we analyse our thoughts and subject our reasoning to the test of logic in order simply to ascertain _the truth_.  \"Smoke for ever!  I say, Bill, open that there port a bit, else we'll be choked,\" cried a stentorian voice, as Guy entered the little apartment, where some dozen of noisy sailors were creating the cloud, which was a little too strong for them.  For some moments Guy glanced round inquiringly, unable to pierce the dim curtain that enshrouded everything, as with a veil of dirty gauze.  \"Lost your reckoning, I guess,\" drawled a Yankee skipper.  \"Never mind, let go your anchor, my lad,\" cried a voice from the densest quarter of the smoke, \"it's not a bad berth, and good holdin' ground.\"  \"What'll you take to drink, my boy, supposin' you gits the offer?\" inquired another man, giving him a facetious poke in the ribs.  \"Is John Bax here?\" inquired Guy.  \"Hallo, messmate--here you are, port your helm and heave a-head--steady! rocks to leeward; starboard hard! ah, I knew you'd never clear these rocks without touchin',\" said Bax, as his young friend tripped over three or four spittoons, and plunged into the corner from which the sailor's deep bass voice issued.  \"There now, sit down; what'll you have?\"  \"Nothing, Bax; what a horrible hole to feed in!  Couldn't you come out and talk with me in the fresh air?\"  It must indeed have been a wonderfully impure place when Guy could venture by contrast to speak of the air outside as being fresh.  \"Couldn't do it, my lad,\" replied Bax, with his mouth full.  \"I haven't had a bit since six o'clock this morning, and I'm only half through.\"  The fact was evident, for a large plate of biscuit and cheese stood on the small table before the seaman, with a tumbler of hot gin and water. So Guy sat down, and, observing that the waiter stood at his elbow, ordered half a pint of stout.  Guy did not drink spirits, but he had no objection to beer, so he took occasion to remonstrate with Bax on his tendency to drink gin, and recommended beer instead, as it would \"do him more good.\"  It did not occur to Guy that a young man in robust health does not require physical good to be done to him at all, beyond what food, and rest, and exercise can achieve, and that, therefore, artificial stimulant of any kind is unnecessary!  \"Skipper ahoy!\" shouted, a gruff voice in the doorway.  \"Ay, ay!\" cried several of the party in reply.  \"Is John Bax in this here port?\"  \"Here you are,\" replied the man in request, \"port your helm, old boy! rocks on the lee bow, look out!\"  \"Steady, so,\" said a fat burly seaman, as he steered in obedience to these sailing directions, and finally \"cast anchor\" beside our two friends.  \"How are ye, Captain Bluenose?\" said Bax, holding out his hand.  \"Same to you, lad,\" replied the Captain, seizing the offered hand in his own enormous fist, which was knotty and fleshy, seamed with old cuts and scars, and stained with tar.  \"Hallo!  Guy, is this you?\" he added, turning suddenly to the youth.  \"Why, who'd 'a thought to see _you_ here?  I do b'lieve I han't seen ye since the last time down at the coast.  But, I say, Guy, my boy, you han't took to drinkin', have ye?\"  \"No, Captain,\" said Guy, with a smile, \"nothing stronger than beer, and not much of that.  I merely came here to meet Bax.\"  Captain Bluenose--whose name, by the way, had no reference to his nose, for that was small and red--scratched his chin and stared into vacancy, as if he were meditating.  \"Why, boy,\" he said at length, \"seems to me as if you'd as good cause to suspec' me of drinkin' as I have to suspec' you, 'cause we're both _here_, d'ye see?  Howsever, I've been cruisin' after the same craft, an' so we've met, d'ye see, an' that's nat'ral, so it is.\"  \"Well, and now you have found me, what d'ye want with me?\" said Bax, finishing the bread and cheese, and applying to the gin and water.  \"Shipmet, I'm goin' home, and wants a berth a-board the `Nancy,'\" said Bluenose.  \"Couldn't do it, Captain,\" said Bax, shaking his head, \"'gainst rules.\"  \"I'll go as a hextra hand--a suppernummerary,\" urged the Captain.  \"Why, Captain,\" said Guy, \"is it not strange that I should have come here to make the very same request?  Come, Bax, you're a good fellow, and will take us both.  I will guarantee that my uncle will not find fault with you.\"  \"Ah, that alters the case,\" said Bax, \"if you choose to take the responsibility on your own shoulders, Guy, you're welcome to the best berth a-board the old `Nancy.'  D'ye know, I've a fondness for that old craft, though she is about as unseaworthy a schooner as sails out o' the port of London.  You see, she's the only craft bigger than a Deal lugger that I ever had command of.  She's my first love, is the old `Nancy,' and I hope we won't have to part for many a day.\"  \"Quite right, young man,\" said Captain Bluenose, nodding his head approvingly, and filling his pipe from a supply of tobacco he always carried in the right pocket of his capacious blue waistcoat.  The Captain gazed with a look of grave solemnity in the manly countenance of the young sailor, for whom he entertained feelings of unbounded admiration.  He had dandled Bax on his knee when he was a baby, had taught him to make boats and to swim and row when he became a boy, and had sailed with him many a time in the same lugger when they put off in wild storms to rescue lives or property from ships wrecked on the famous Goodwin Sands.  \"Quite right, young man,\" repeated the Captain, as he lighted his pipe, \"your sentiments does you credit.  W'en a man's got his first love, d'ye see, an' finds as how she's all trim and ship-shape, and taut, and well ballasted, and all that sort o' thing, stick to her to the last, through thick and thin.  That's wot _I_ say, d'ye see?  There's no two ways about it, for wot's right can't be wrong.  If it can, show me how, and then I'll knock under, but not before.\"  \"Certainly not, Captain,\" cried Bax, laughing, \"never give in--that's my motto.\"  \"There,\" said Bluenose, gravely, \"you're wrong--'cause why?  You're not right, an' w'en a man's not right he ought always to give in.\"  \"But how is a fellow to know when he's right and when he's wrong?\" asked Bax.  \"Con-sideration,\" said Bluenose.  \"Bravo!  Captain,\" cried Guy, with a laugh, \"if it be true that `brevity is the soul of wit,' you must be the wittiest fellow on Deal beach.\"  \"I dun-know,\" retorted the Captain, slowly, \"whether it's the soul or the body o' wit, an' wot's more, I don't care; but it's a fact, d'ye see, that consideration'll do it; least-wise if consideration won't, nothin' will.  See now, here it is,\"--(he became very earnest at this point),--\"w'en a thing puzzles people, wot does people do?"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21745"],["title","The Life of a Ship (#1)"],["body"," began to move.  Another second and the _Fair Nancy_ rushed down the incline, plunged heavily into the water like some awful sea-monster, and floated out upon her ocean home amid the deafening cheers of the people, especially of little Davy, who sat on the top of the post waving his red cap and shouting with delight.  After the launch Davy and all the people returned home, and the _Fair Nancy_ was towed to the \"shear-hulk\" to have her masts put in.  The shear-hulk is a large ship in which is placed machinery for lifting masts into other ships.  Every one who has looked at the thick masts of a large vessel, must see at a glance that they could never be put there by any number of men.  Machinery is used to do it, and the shear-hulk contains that machinery; so that when a ship has to get her masts put up she is dragged alongside of this vessel.  In the meantime Davy renewed his prayer to his father to let him go to sea, and at last the old man consented.  His mother cried a good deal at first, and hoped that Davy would not think of it; but his father said that it would do him good, and if he became tired of it after the first voyage he could give it up. Davy was overjoyed at this, and went immediately to his friend the fisherman, Ben Block, who was very much delighted too, and took him to a shop to buy clothes and a sea-chest for the voyage.  \"You see, lad,\" said Ben, \"the ship is bound for Quebec with a mixed cargo, and is to come back loaded with timber; and as the season is coming on, you'll need to get ready quick.\"  \"That I shall,\" replied Davy, as they entered a shop.  \"Ho! shopman, give me a straw hat, and a blue jacket, and a pair o' duck trousers, and--\"  \"Stop! stop!\" cried Ben, \"you're sailing too fast.  Take in a reef, my lad.\"  Ben meant by this that he was to proceed a little slower. \"You'll want a `sou'-wester,'\" (an oilskin hat), \"and a `dread-nought,'\" (a thick, heavy coat), \"and things o' that sort.\"  After Davy had bought all he wanted, and ordered a sea-chest, he went home to his mother, who was very sad at the thought of parting with him. When the day of departure came she gave him a great deal of good advice, which Davy promised, with tears in his eyes, to remember.  Then she gave him a little Bible and a kiss, and sent him away.  His father took him to the beach, where the ship's boat was waiting for him; and, as the old man took off his cap, and raising his eyes to heaven, prayed for a blessing on his little son, Davy, with watery eyes, looked around at the big ships floating on the water, and, for the first time, wished that he was not going to sea.  In a few minutes he was on board the \"outward-bound\" ship.  This is what we say of ships when they are going out to sea; when they return from a voyage we say that they are \"homeward-bound.\"  The _Fair Nancy_ was a noble ship, and as she hoisted her snow-white sails to a strong wind, (a stiff breeze, as Ben Block called it), she looked like a white cloud. The cloud seemed to grow smaller and smaller as Davy's father and mother watched it from the shore; then it became like a little white spot on the faraway sea; then it passed over the line where the water meets the sky, and they saw it no more!  After Davy had cried a great deal, and wished very often that he had not been so determined to leave home, he dried his eyes and began to take great interest in the curious things he saw around him.  What surprised him most of all was, that although he actually was at sea, he could not see the sea at all!  This was because the sides of the ship, which are called \"bulwarks,\" were so high that they quite prevented the little boy from seeing overboard.  Davy soon found an opening in the bulwarks, however, which his friend Ben called the \"gang-way,\" through which he could see the water and the ships and boats that were sailing there. And when he mounted the high part of the deck in front of the ship, which is called the \"forecastle,\" or when he went upon the high deck at the stern of the ship, which is called the \"poop,\" then he could see all round.  And what a wonderful and new sight it was to Davy!  His cottage was gone!  The beach, and the pier where the nets used to hang, were gone.  The trees and fields were all gone, and there was nothing but sea, sea, sea, all round, so that the _Fair Nancy_ seemed the only solid thing in the whole wide world!  But poor Davy did not look or wonder long at this, for the breeze freshened, and the waves rose, and the ship plunged, and Davy felt very queer about the stomach!  There is a man in every ship called the \"steward,\" and everybody loves that man, because he goes about from morning till night trying to do people good and to make them happy.  He looks after breakfasts, dinners, teas, and suppers. He answers every one who calls, and gets for everybody anything that they want.  He is never ill, never in a hurry, never in a bad temper; in fact, he is a very charming man.  Now, when the steward saw Davy with a pale face, and red eyes, and awfully seasick, he went up to him with a smile, and said, \"Sick, my lad? you'll soon get used to it.  Always sick when you first go to sea. Come below and I'll give you summat to do you good, and tumble you into your hammock.\"  By going below the good steward meant going below the deck into the cabin.  A ship is just like a large house, divided into a number of rooms--some of which are sitting rooms, some store and provision rooms, some kitchens and pantries, closets and cupboards; and there are two or three flats in some ships, so that you can go up or down stairs at your pleasure.  When Davy went down the ladder or stair, which is called the \"companion,\" and followed the steward through many rooms full of all kinds of things that seemed to be all in confusion, and saw the sailors sitting, and smoking, and laughing, and talking on chests and tables, he almost believed that he was in a house on shore; but then he remembered that houses on shore don't dance about and roll, first on one side and then on the other, and plunge forwards and then backwards; so he sighed and put his hands to his breast, which felt very uncomfortable.  \"Here's your hammock,\" said the steward; \"all the sailors sleep in these things, and this one is yours.\"  So saying, he lifted Davy from the ground and tossed him into bed.  The \"hammock\" is a long piece of canvas drawn in round an iron ring at each end.  To this ring a number of cords are attached, and the hammock is slung by them to the beams of the ship. In the bed thus formed the blankets are put; and a very snug bed it is, as it swings about with the ship.  Davy soon fell asleep, but he was quickly wakened again by the horrible noises on deck.  Ropes were thrown about, men's feet were stamping, pieces of wood were falling, doors were banging, masts were creaking, the wind was howling; in short, Davy thought it must be a terrible storm and that they should all be lost. But the steward said to him, in passing, \"It's only a stiff breeze, youngster;\" so he turned round and went to sleep again.  For two days and two nights did Davy lie there--very sick!  On the morning of the third day he awoke much refreshed, and felt strongly inclined to eat his blankets!  As he lay wondering how he was to get down out of his hammock without breaking his neck, he heard his friend Ben Block conversing with a man in another hammock who had never been to sea before and was very, very sick.  \"Oh! dear me,\" sighed the sick man, \"where are we now?\"  \"Don't know,\" answered Ben; \"we've been drove pretty far out of our course to the nor'ard, I guess.  It's a dead calm.\"  \"A dead what?\" said the sick man faintly.  \"Why, a dead calm,\" replied Ben.  \"When there's no wind it's a calm, and when there's no motion at all, either in the air or in the water, except the swell o' the sea, it's a dead calm.  D'ye understand?\"  \"Is it fine weather, Ben?\" cried Davy cheerfully.  \"Yes, lad, it is,\" replied the sailor.  On hearing this Davy sprang, or, as the sailors call it, tumbled out of bed.  He tried to get out of it; but not being used to hammocks, he was awkward and fell plump on the floor!  However, he was not hurt; and throwing on his jacket, he ran up on deck.  Well might Davy's heart leap and his voice shout at the beautiful sight that met his gaze when he reached the forecastle.  The sea was like one wide beautiful mirror, in which all the clouds were clearly reflected. The sun shone brightly and glittered on the swell on which the ship rolled slowly; and the only sound that could be heard was the gentle flapping of the loose sails, now and then, against the masts.  \"Have you had breakfast, youngster?\" inquired the captain of the ship, laying his hand on Davy's head.  \"No, sir, not yet,\" answered the boy.  \"Run below, then, and get it, and after you've done come to me.  We must put you to work now, lad, and make a sailor of you.\"  The steward soon gave Davy as much food as he could eat; then he sprang up the companion ladder, and, running to the poop where the captain was, touched his cap, saying--  \"I'm ready, sir.\"  \"Very good, my lad,\" said the captain, sitting down on the skylight, or window on the deck, which gives light to the cabin below.  \"Do you see that little thing on top of the mainmast like a button?\"  \"Do you mean the truck?\" said Davy.  \"Oh, you know its name, do you? well, do you think you could climb up to it?\"  \"I'll try,\" cried Davy, springing towards the mast.  \"Stay!\" shouted the captain; \"not so fast, boy.  You'd tumble down and break your neck if you tried to climb to the truck the first time you ever went up the mast.  But you may go to the `maintop.'  That's where you see the lower mast joined to the top mast.  Climb up by those rope ladders--the `shrouds,' we call them.\"  Away went Davy, and was soon halfway up the shrouds; but he went too fast, and had to stop for breath.  Then he came to the mass of woodwork and ropes at the head of the lower mast.  Here "]]]
