If the French soldiers and the French priests had won in that struggle, Ohio and the whole West might now be something like the Province of Quebec as it was then. The Indians would have been converted to the Catholic faith, and they would still be found in almost as great numbers as ever throughout the vast region where hardly one of their blood remains.  But this was not to be. The French built their forts with a keen eye for the strongest points in the wilderness, and the priests planted the cross even beyond the forts. But all around and between the forts and the missions, the traders from our colonies, which afterwards became our states, stole into the country claimed for the king of France. At that time, there was peace between the king of France and the king of England in Europe, and they pretended that there was peace between their nations in America. They were very civil to each other through their ministers and ambassadors, over there, but their governors and captains here never ceased to fight and trick for the ownership of the West. From their forts, built to curb the English settlers, the French set the savages on to harass the frontier of our colonies, which their war parties wasted with theft and fire and murder. Our colonies made a poor defense, because they were suspicious of one another. New England was suspicious of New York, New York of Pennsylvania, Pennsylvania of Virginia, and the mother country was suspicious of them all. She was willing that the French should hold Canada, and keep the colonies from joining together in a revolt against her, when she could easily have taken that province and freed them from the inroads of the Canadian Indians. The colonies would not unite against the common enemy, for fear one would have more advantage than another from their union; but their traders went out singly, through the West, and trading companies began to be formed in Pennsylvania and Virginia. While CÃ©loron was in Ohio claiming the whole land for the king of France, the king of England was granting a great part of the same to a company of Virginians, with the right to settle it and fortify it The Virginia Company sent its agents to visit the Miamis at Pickawillany a year later, and bound them to the English by gifts of brandy, tobacco, beads, gay cloths, and powder.  The allied tribes, who had their capital at Pickawillany, numbered some two thousand in all. The Miamis themselves are said to have been of the same family as the great Iroquois nation of the East, who had beaten their rivals of the Algonquin nation, and forced them to bear the name of women. But many of the Ohio Indians were Delawares, who were of the Algonquin family; they were by no means patient of the name of women, and they and their friends now took the side of the French against the English. When at last the West, together with the whole of Canada, fell to the English and there presently began to be trouble between the American colonists and the English king, all the Indians, both Iroquois and Algonquins took part against the Americans. A little victory for either side, however, with gifts of brandy and tobacco, would turn their savage hearts toward the victors; and one must not be too confident in saying that the Indians were always for the French against the English, or always for the English against the Americans.  [Illustration: Pichawillany, Chief town of the Miamis 030]  In fact, one must speak mostly of the Indians in words that have a double sense. The old explorers, missionaries, soldiers, and traders all talk of nations, towns, villages, kings, half-kings, queens, and princes, but these words present false images to our minds. Calling the chief town of the Miamis at Pickawillany their capital gives the notion of some such capital as Columbus or Washington; but if we imagine the chief town of the Miamis as it really was, we see some hundreds of wigwams in straggling clusters along the banks of the river, in the shadow of the ancient woods, or in the sunshine of the beautiful meadows, as the earliest white visitors to Ohio called the small prairies which they came upon in the heart of the forests. We see a large council house of bark, as nearly in the midst of the scattered huts as may be, where the Miamis hold their solemn debates, receive embassies from other tribes, welcome their warriors home from their forays, and celebrate their feasts and dances. We see fields bordering the village, where the squaws plant their corn and beans, and the maple groves where they make their sugar. Among the men and boys we see the busy idleness of children, all day long, except when the grown-up children go out upon a hunt, or take the warpath. Sometimes we see an English trader coming with his merchandise and presents, or a captive brought in to be tortured and burnt, or adopted into the tribe.  The tribes in the Ohio country were far abler than those that the English first met to the eastward, and they were fiercer than the fiercest which the Americans have at last brought under control in the plains of the Far West. Pitiless as Sioux and Apache and Comanche have shown themselves in their encounters with the whites in our day, they were surpassed in ferocity by the Shawnees, the Wyandots, and the Miamis whom the backwoodsmen met in a thousand fights, a century or a century and a half ago. The Ohio Indians were unspeakably vicious, treacherous, and filthy, but they were as brave as they were vile, and they were as sagacious as they were false. They produced men whom we must call orators, statesmen, and generals, even when tested by the high standards of civilization. They excelled us in the art of war as it was adapted to the woods, and they despised the stupid and wasteful courage of the disciplined English soldier. Till the white men studied war from them they were always beaten in their fights with the red men, and it was hardly the fault of the Indians if the pioneers learned from them to be savages: to kill women and children as well as armed men, to tomahawk and scalp the wounded, to butcher helpless prisoners. But this befell, and it is this which makes many of the stories of Ohio so bloody. We must know their hideous facts fully if we would know them truly, or if we would realize the life that once passed in the shadows of our woods.  The region that we now call Ohio was wonderfully varied and pleasant. The many rivers that watered it cleared their space to the sky where they ran, and here and there the meadows or prairies smiled to the sun in grass and flowers. But everywhere else there was the gloom of forests unbroken since the Mound Builders left the land. The long levels that bordered the great lake at the north, the noble hills that followed the course of the Beautiful River, the gently varied surfaces of the center, and the southwest, the swamps and morasses of the northwest, were nearly everywhere densely wooded. Our land was a woodland, and its life, when it first became known to the white man, was the stealthy and cruel life of the forest. Where the busy Mound Builders once swarmed, scanty tribes of savages lurked in the leafy twilight, hunting and fishing, and warring upon one another. They came and went upon their errands of death and rapine by trails unseen to other eyes, till the keen traders of Pennsylvania and Virginia began to find their way over them to their villages, and to traffic with the savages for the furs which formed their sole wealth.  All is dim and vague in any picture of the time and place that we can bring before us. There are the fathomless forests, broken by the prairies and rivers; there are the Indian towns widely scattered along the larger streams throughout the whole region; there are the French posts on the northern border, with each a priest and a file of soldiers, and a few Canadian farmers and traders. Under the cover of peace between the French king and the English king, there is a constant grapple between the French soldiers and the English settlers for the possession of the wilds which shall one day be the most magnificent empire under the sun; there are the war parties of Indians falling stealthily upon the English borders to the eastward; there is the steady pressure of the backwoodsman westward, in spite of every hardship and danger, in spite of treaties, in spite of rights and promises. These are the main features of the picture whose details the imagination strives to supply, with a teasing sense of the obscurity resting upon the whole. It is all much farther off than ancient Rome, much stranger than Greece; but it is the beginning of a mighty history, which it rests with the children of this day, and their children after them, to make the happiest and noblest chapter in the history of the world. It is a part of that greater history, and I should like my young readers to remember that the Ohio stories which I hope to tell them are important chiefly because they are human stories, and record incidents in the life of the whole race. They cannot be taken from this without losing their finest meanings.     III. OHIO BECOMES ENGLISH.  Neither the French nor the English had any right to the Ohio country which they both claimed. If it belonged to any people of right, it belonged to the savages, who held it in their way before the whites came, and who now had to choose which nation should call itself their master. They chose the French, and they chose wisely for themselves as savages; for, as I have said, if the French had prevailed in the war that was coming, the Indians could have kept their forests and lived their forest life as before. The French would have been satisfied in the West as they had been in the North, with their forts and trading stations, and the Indians could have hunted, and fished, and trapped, as they had always done. In fact, the French people would often have become like them. They understood the Indians and liked them; sometimes they mated with"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21383"],["title","Adventures in Australia (#1)"],["body","down serving to impede the progress, enables the hunter to keep it in view, till it reaches its home.  We ate the honey with a small supply of biscuit, and found it far more satisfactory food than the tough parrots had proved.  Having taken a last drink and filled up our waterbottles, we parted on friendly terms with the natives; when, saddling our horses, we continued our journey.  \"There is little chance of our reaching another river with more water in it than the last, to camp by,\" observed my brother; \"I see none marked down on the maps for leagues ahead.\"  We passed through the same sort of scenery as before, with the same dreary views on either side, so that we might have fancied that we had already crossed the country a dozen times.  We at length came to the bed of a stream, no longer however containing water, though I doubt not that we should have obtained it by digging beneath the surface.  The appearance of the bee-hunters had warned us that there were natives about, and we had been cautioned against trusting them.  We heard that they had at different times murdered a number of unfortunate hut-keepers and shepherds up the country, so that we were inclined to form very unfavourable opinions of the aborigines.  Toby, to be sure, was faithful enough, but then he was semi-civilised.  We now asked him if he thought that there were many natives in the neighbourhood to whom the bee-hunters belonged.  He shook his head--\"May be!\" he said; \"bad mans, keep out of him way.\"  This advice we were ready enough to adopt, and we had no fear, should we meet them on the open ground, of keeping them at bay; but we wished especially to avoid being caught asleep, either at night or resting during the noon-day heat.  We had, at this time, literally no experience about Australia.  We had read a few books, to be sure, but Mr Strong had not described the country, and only advised our father to send us out without incumbrances of any description--a small stock of serviceable clothes, a few books and a box of pills apiece.  We followed out his injunctions almost to the letter, adding only some well-made tools, a fowling-piece each, and a supply of ammunition, to which we added on our arrival a few necessaries for travelling in the bush.  Thus we found that one animal could carry all our worldly possessions, a few odd articles for immediate use being packed in our saddle-bags.  We were now, as the day was wearing on, looking out for a convenient place to camp.  We tried to make Toby understand that we wished for one in which we could not easily be surprised by natives, or if surprised, where we could defend ourselves with some hope of success.  The nature of the ground had changed since the morning, and we now entered a rocky and wild-looking district.  Here we should have no difficulty, we thought, in selecting a spot for our camp.  We were looking about, when we spied in the distance what appeared to be the figure of a man standing against a tree.  My brother instantly rode forward and I following him saw a person who, to all appearance, though in bush costume, was a gentleman, bound with his hands behind his back, and secured firmly to a tree.  He was deadly pale and seemed so much exhausted that he did not even speak to us as we approached.  To leap from our horses and release him without asking questions, was the work of a minute.  Having put him on his feet and waited until he had somewhat recovered, we inquired how he had been placed in the position in which we had found him.  \"Some rascally bushrangers surprised, and `stuck me up,'\" he answered. \"I had just dismounted, when three of them, who had been lying in ambush, suddenly sprang on me, and before I could draw my revolver, knocked me down.  \"I fully believed that they intended to murder me, but they contented themselves with carrying off my horse and arms and ammunition and everything I had about me; having lashed me to this tree, and then galloped away, leaving me to the chance of dying of thirst and starvation, or being gnawed to death by the dingoes.  Had you not come up, such might have been my fate; and, believe me, I am deeply grateful to you for rescuing me from it.\"  We had been aware of the possibility that we might meet with natives, but had not thought of the likelihood of encountering bushrangers, indeed we fancied that the country was no longer infested by such characters.  We, of course, having assured the stranger that we were very glad to have been of use to him, invited him to accompany us until he could obtain another horse, and offered to let him ride one of ours by turns.  \"I should like however to try and catch the fellows who robbed you;\" exclaimed Guy.  \"Is there any chance of overtaking them?  Surely they will encamp not far from this, and if we follow their tracks we might come upon them as suddenly as they surprised you.\"  \"Very little chance of that,\" observed the stranger.  \"They are desperate fellows, and, knowing that every man's hand is against them, keep a strict watch.  They are aware that it is possible that I might be released, and will probably ere this have got a good many miles away, I am, however, grateful to you for your offer, though I am sorry to delay you.  I confess that, without a gun or flint and steel, I should be very sorry to perform the rest of the journey on foot by myself.  I am going to the north-west, and I judge, from the direction you were riding, that our roads lie the same way.\"  Guy told him that we were bound for Mr Strong's station, which we understood was nearly a hundred miles off; and at the rate we could travel with our baggage-horse, we did not expect to reach it for three or four days.  Observing how ill the stranger looked I suggested that we should at once look out a good spot for camping.  \"I can help you, as I know the country,\" said the stranger.  \"A short distance further on there is a water-hole in what during the rainy season is sometimes a torrent; we can there obtain all the requisites for a camp.\"  I now insisted that he should mount my horse, and we set out.  Pushing forward, we soon reached the spot he spoke of.  Our new companion, after examining the ground, told us that the bushrangers had been there, and after watering their horses had ridden on, as he supposed they would, and that we need have no apprehensions of an attack from them.  We soon hobbled the horses in the usual fashion, fastening their legs together with leathern straps in such a way as to make it impossible for them to move beyond a slow walk, so that if they were inclined to stray they could not go far.  Toby quickly lighted a fire, while the stranger by our advice rested near it.  Guy and I taking our guns went out in different directions in search of game, which is usually to be found near a water-hole in Australia.  We soon came back, Guy with a brace of pigeons and I with three parrots, so that we had ample food for all hands.  As we had damper and tea, we enjoyed a satisfactory meal which greatly revived our new friend.  While we were seated round the fire--Toby watching the horses--the stranger inquired if we were related to Mr Strong.  This led us to give him a brief sketch of our history.  \"May I ask your name?\" he said.  \"Mine is Norman Bracewell.\"  \"And ours is Thurston,\" said my brother.  \"What!  Guy Thurston?\" exclaimed Bracewell, leaning forward and grasping Guy's hand; \"I thought from the first that I knew your features.  We were at school together. `Little Guy' we used to call you, and you haven't forgotten me?\"  \"No indeed!\" said Guy warmly, \"you always stood my friend when the big fellows tried to bully me, and I have a perfect recollection of your countenance.  I have often wished to know what had become of you, but could only hear that you had gone abroad.\"  \"I thought of writing to let you know, in case you should ever come out to Australia; but I fancied that that was so unlikely and the chances of meeting you so small that I did not carry out my intention.  You must stop at my hut.  The longer you stay the better.  We will have many a talk about old times and I think I can put you up to all sorts of information which will be useful to you in the country.  To tell you the truth, I doubt if you will find your cousin, Mr Strong, as I heard that he had gone northwards to occupy a new station, some hundreds of miles off, and if so you will probably find no one to give you a welcome at his house except some old hut-keeper.\"  On hearing this, Guy and I gladly agreed to stop a few days with Bracewell until we could obtain some definite information as to the movements of our cousin.  We told him of our meeting with the two bee-hunters.  \"This proves that there are some natives in the neighbourhood.  They may be honest, but they may also be ill-disposed, as are many of the blacks in this region.  I advise that we keep a strict watch at night, and I offer to stand guard part of the time,\" observed Bracewell.  We agreed to keep a watch, but after the trying time he had gone through we thought that he ought to have a quiet night's rest so as to be the better able to continue his journey the next morning.  Toby had put up a rough hut of boughs, which would afford two of us at a time sufficient shelter from the night air.  Of rain there was no fear. Toby erected a hut for himself with a few boughs stuck upright in the ground, which formed all the protection he required.  I undertook to keep the first watch, and I promised my brother that I would call him when I could no longer remain with my eyes open.  From past experience we knew that it would not do to trust Toby, who would be very certain to be down as soon as he found that our eyes were off him. Guy and Bracewell were quickly asleep and I commenced walking to and fro, keeping a look-out on every side and sometimes stopping to throw a few sticks on the fire.  I could see the horses safely feeding hear at hand, and so perfect was the silence which reigned "]]]
