He grew melancholy, gazing out of the window-slit.  Not a very cheerful view--just the plain and the sky--but he liked it. He used to think, if he could only fly out of that window, up to the sky or down to the plain, how nice it would be! Perhaps when he died--his nurse had told him once in anger that he would never leave the tower till he died--he might be able to do this.  \"And I wish I had somebody to tell me all about it; about that and many other things; somebody that would be fond of me, like my poor white kitten.\"  Here the tears came into his eyes, for the boy's one friend had been a little white kitten, which the deaf mute, kindly smiling, once took out of his pocket and gave him. For four weeks it was his constant companion and plaything, till one moonlight night it took a fancy for wandering, climbed on to the parapet of the tower, dropped over and disappeared. It was not killed, he hoped; indeed, he almost fancied he saw it pick itself up and scamper away, but he never caught sight of it again.  \"Yes, I wish I had a person, a real live person, who would be fond of me and kind to me. Oh, I want somebody--dreadfully, dreadfully!\"  As he spoke, there sounded behind him a slight tap-tap-tap, as of a cane, and twisting himself around, what do you think he saw? A curious little woman, no bigger than he might himself have been, had his legs grown, but she was not a child--she was an old woman with a sweet smile and a soft voice, and was carrying a cane.  \"My own little boy,\" she said, \"I could not come to you until you had said you wanted me, but now you do want me, here I am.\"  \"And you are very welcome, madam,\" replied the Prince. \"May I ask you who you are? Perhaps my mother?\"  [Illustration: AND TWISTING HIMSELF AROUND, WHAT DO YOU THINK HE SAW? [PAGE 16.]]  \"No, I am not your mother, though she was a dear friend of mine.\"  \"Will you tell her to come and see me then?\"  \"She cannot; but I daresay she knows all about you and loves you. I love you, too, and I want to help you, my poor little boy.\"  \"Why do you call me poor?\" asked Prince Dolor in surprise.  The little old woman sighed and glanced down at his legs and feet, which he did not know were different from those of other children, and then to his sweet, bright face.  \"I beg your pardon, My Prince,\" said she.  \"Yes, I am a prince, and my name is Dolor; will you tell me yours, madam?\"  The little old woman laughed like a chime of silver bells.  \"I have so many that I don't know which to choose. It was I who gave you yours, and you will belong to me all your days. I am your godmother.\"  \"Hurrah!\" cried the little prince; \"I am glad I belong to you, for I like you very much.\"  So they sat down and played and talked together.  \"Are you very lonesome here?\" asked the little old woman.  \"Not particularly, thank you, godmother. I have my lessons to do, and my books to read.\"  \"And you want for nothing?\"  \"Nothing. Yes, godmother, please bring me a little boy to play with?\"  \"Just the thing, alas, which I cannot give you.\"  His godmother took him in her arms and kissed him. By-and-by he kissed her at first awkwardly and shyly, then with all the strength of his warm little heart.  \"Promise me that you will never go away, godmother.\"  \"I must, but I will leave you a travelling cloak that will take you wherever you want to go, and show you all that you wish to see.\"  \"I don't need a cloak, for I never go out.\"  \"Hush! the nurse is coming.\"  A grumpy voice and a rattle of plates and dishes was heard.  \"It's my nurse, bringing my dinner; but I don't want dinner. I only want you. Will her coming drive you away, godmother?\"  \"Only for a while, only wish for me and I will return.\"  When the door opened, Prince Dolor shut his eyes; opening them again, nobody but his nurse was in the room, as his godmother had melted away.  \"Such a heap of untidy books; and what's this rubbish?\" said she, kicking a little bundle that lay beside them.  \"Give it to me,\" cried the Prince; and reaching after it, he hid it under his pinafore.  It was, though she did not know this, his wonderful travelling-cloak.     CHAPTER IV.   The cloak outside, was the commonest looking bundle imaginable--Dolor touched it; it grew smaller, and he put it into his trouser's pocket and kept it there until he had a chance to look at it.  It seemed but a mere piece of cloth, dark green in color, being worn and shabby, though not dirty.  Prince Dolor examined it curiously; spread it out on the floor, then arranged it on his shoulders. It felt comfortable; but was the only shabby thing the Prince had ever seen in his life.  \"And what use will it be to me?\" said he sadly, \"and what in the world shall I do with it?\"  He folded it carefully and put it away in a safe corner of his toy-cupboard. After a time he nearly forgot the cloak and his godmother. Sometimes though, he recalled her sweet pleasant face; but as she never came, she gradually slipped out of his memory, until something happened which made him remember her, and want her as he had never wanted anything before.  Prince Dolor fell ill. He caught a complaint common to the people of Nomansland, called the doldrums, which made him restless, cross and disagreeable. Even when a little better, he was too weak to enjoy anything, but lay all day alone.  \"I wonder what my godmother meant when she looked at my legs and sighed so bitterly? Why can't I walk like my nurse. It would be very nice to move about quickly or fly like a bird. How nice it must be to be a bird. If legs are no good, why can one not have wings? I am so tired and no one cares for me, except perhaps my godmother. Godmother, dear, have you forsaken me?\"  He stretched himself wearily, gathered himself up, and dropped his head upon his hands; as he did so, he felt somebody kiss him on the back of his neck, and turning, found that he was resting on the warm shoulder of the little old woman.  How glad he was to see her. He put both his arms around her neck and kissed her lovingly.  \"Stop, stop!\" cried she, pretending to be smothered. \"Only just let me have breath to speak one word. Tell me what has happened to you since I saw you.\"  \"Nothing has happened,\" answered the Prince somewhat dolefully.  \"And are you very unhappy, my boy?\"  \"So unhappy, that I was just thinking whether I could not jump down to the bottom of the tower.\"  \"You must be content to stay where you are,\" said the little old woman, \"for you are a prince, and must behave as such--where is your traveling-cloak?\"  Prince Dolor blushed. \"I--I put it away in the cupboard; I suppose it is there still.\"  \"You have never used it; you dislike it?\"  He hesitated, not wishing to be impolite. \"Don't you think it's just a little old and shabby for a prince?\"  The old woman laughed very sweetly.  \"Why, if all the princes in the world craved for it, they couldn't get it, unless I gave it to them. Old and shabby! It's the most valuable thing imaginable! I thought I would give it to you, because--because you are different from other people.\"  \"Am I?\" asked the prince with tears in his eyes.  She touched his poor little legs. \"These are not like the legs of other little boys.\"  \"Indeed!--my nurse never told me that.\"  \"I tell you, because I love you.\"  \"Tell me what, dear godmother?\"  \"That you will never be able to walk, or run, or jump, but your life may be a very happy life for all that. Do not be afraid.\"  \"I am not afraid,\" said the boy, and his lip began to quiver, though he did not cry.  Though he did not wholly understand, he began to guess what his godmother meant. He had never seen any real live boys, but he had seen pictures of them; running and jumping; which he had admired and tried hard to imitate, but always failed. Now, he began to understand that we cannot always have things as we want them, but as they are, and that we must learn to bear them and make the best of them.  She comforted him and whispered in her sweet, strong, cheerful voice--\"Never mind!\"  \"No, I don't think I do mind, that is, I won't mind.\"  \"That is right, My Prince! Let us put our shoulders to the wheel--\"  \"We are in Hopeless Tower and there is no wheel to put our shoulders to,\" said the child sadly.  \"You little matter-of-fact goose! Well for you that you have a godmother called--'Stuff and Nonsense.'\"  \"Stuff and Nonsense! What a funny name!\"  \"Some people give it to me, but they are not my most intimate friends. You may give me any name you please; but I am your godmother. I have few godchildren; those I have love me dearly, and find me the greatest blessing in all the world.\"  \"I can well believe it,\" cried the little lame Prince.  \"Bring the cloak out of the rubbish cupboard, and shake the dust off it, quick!\" said she to Prince Dolor. \"Spread it out on the floor, and wait till the split closes and the edges turn up. Then open the skylight, set yourself on the cloak, and say, 'Abracadabra, dum dum dum,' and--see what will happen!\"  The Prince burst into a fit of laughing. It all seemed so exceedingly silly, and his godmother laughed too.  \"Believe me or not, it doesn't matter,\" said she. \"Here is the cloak; when you want to go travelling on it, say, Abracadabra dum dum dum; when you want to come back again, say, Abracadabra tum tum ti. That's all, good-bye.\"  A puff of pleasant air and his godmother was gone.  \"How rosy your Royal Highness's cheeks are! You seem to have grown better,\" said the nurse entering the room.  \"I have,\" replied the Prince--he felt kindly, even to his grim nurse. \"Let me have my dinner, and you go to your sewing.\"  The instant she was gone, Prince Dolor sprang from his sofa, and with one or two of his frog-like jumps, he reached the cupboard where he kept his toys, and looked everywhere for his traveling-cloak.  Alas! It was not there.  While he was ill, his nurse, had made a grand clearance of all his \"rubbish,\" all the treasures of"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24054"],["title","Dead Giveaway (#1)"],["body","sn't as hard to find as it might be.  But don't think I haven't been watching your work. I've read every one of your articles in the various journals, and I have copies of all four of your books nestled securely in my library. Columbia should be--and apparently is--proud to have a man of your ability on its staff. At the rate you've been going, it won't be long before you get an invitation from the Advanced Study Board to study for your Scholar's degree.  As a matter of fact, I'd like to make you an offer right now to do some original research with me. I may not be a top-flight genius like Metternick or Dahl, but my reputation does carry some weight with the Board. (_That, Turnbull thought, was a bit of needless modesty; Duckworth wasn't the showman that Metternick was, or the prolific writer that Dahl was, but he had more intelligence and down-right wisdom than either._) So if you could manage to get a few months leave from Columbia, I'd be honored to have your assistance. (_More modesty, thought Turnbull. The honor would be just the other way round._)  The problem, in case you're wondering, has to do with the Centaurus Mystery; I think I've uncovered a new approach that will literally kick the supports right out from under every theory that's been evolved for the existence of that city. Sound interesting?  I'm mailing this early, so it should reach you in the late afternoon mail. If you'll be at home between 1900 and 2000, I'll call you and give you the details. If you've got a pressing appointment, leave details with the operator.      All the best,             Jim Duckworth         *       *       *       *       *  Turnbull slid the letter back into its tube and picked up the second letter, dated 22 August 2187, one day later.         *       *       *       *       *  Dear Dave,  I called last night, and the operator said your phone has been temporarily disconnected. I presume these letters will be forwarded, so please let me know where you are. I'm usually at home between 1800 and 2300, so call me collect within the next three or four days.      All the best,               Jim         *       *       *       *       *  The third letter was dated 10 November 2187. Turnbull wondered why it had been sent. Obviously, the manager of the Excelsior had sent Duckworth a notice that Dr. Turnbull was off-planet and could not be reached. He must have received the notice on the afternoon of 22 August. That would account for his having sent a second letter before he got the notice. Then why the third letter?         *       *       *       *       *  Dear Dave,  I know you won't be reading this letter for six months or so, but at least it will tell you where I am. I guess I wasn't keeping as close tabs on your work as I thought: otherwise I would have known about the expedition to Lobon. You ought to be able to make enough credit on that trip to bring you to the attention of the Board.  And don't feel too bad about missing my first letters or the call. I was off on a wild goose chase that just didn't pan out, so you really didn't miss a devil of a lot.  As a matter of fact, it was rather disappointing to me, so I've decided to take a long-needed sabbatical leave and combine it with a little research on the half-intelligent natives of Mendez. I'll see you in a year or so.      As ever,           Jim Duckworth         *       *       *       *       *  Well, that was that, Turnbull thought. It galled him a little to think that he'd been offered a chance to do research with Scholar Duckworth and hadn't been able to take it. But if the research hadn't panned out.... He frowned and turned back to the first letter.  A theory that would \"literally kick the supports right out from under every theory that's been evolved for the existence of that city,\" he'd said. Odd. It was unlike Duckworth to be so positive about anything until he could support his own theory without much fear of having it pulled to pieces.  Turnbull poured himself a second glass of sherry, took a sip, and rolled it carefully over his tongue.  The Centaurus Mystery. That's what the explorers had called it back in 2041, nearly a century and a half before, when they'd found the great city on one of the planets of the Alpha Centaurus system. Man's first interstellar trip had taken nearly five years at sublight velocities, and _bing!_--right off the bat, they'd found something that made interstellar travel worthwhile, even though they'd found no planet in the Alpha Centaurus system that was really habitable for man.  They'd seen it from space--a huge domed city gleaming like a great gem from the center of the huge desert that covered most of the planet. The planet itself was Marslike--flat and arid over most of its surface, with a thin atmosphere high in CO_2 and very short on oxygen. The city showed up very well through the cloudless air.  From the very beginning, it had been obvious that whoever or whatever had built that city had not evolved on the planet where it had been built. Nothing more complex than the lichens had ever evolved there, as thousands of drillings into the crust of the planet had shown.  Certainly nothing of near-humanoid construction could ever have come into being on that planet without leaving some trace of themselves or their genetic forebears except for that single huge city.  How long the city had been there was anyone's guess. A thousand years? A million? There was no way of telling. It had been sealed tightly, so none of the sand that blew across the planet's surface could get in. It had been set on a high plateau of rock, far enough above the desert level to keep it from being buried, and the transparent dome was made of an aluminum oxide glass that was hard enough to resist the slight erosion of its surface that might have been caused by the gentle, thin winds dashing microscopic particles of sand against its smooth surface.  Inside, the dry air had preserved nearly every artifact, leaving them as they had been when the city was deserted by its inhabitants at an unknown time in the past.  That's right--deserted. There were no signs of any remains of living things. They'd all simply packed up and left, leaving everything behind.  Dating by the radiocarbon method was useless. Some of the carbon compounds in the various artifacts showed a faint trace of radiocarbon, others showed none. But since the method depends on a knowledge of the amount of nitrogen in the atmosphere of the planet of origin, the rate of bombardment of that atmosphere by high-velocity particles, and several other factors, the information on the radioactivity of the specimens meant nothing. There was also the likelihood that the carbon in the various polymer resins came from oil or coal, and fossil carbon is useless for radio-dating.  Nor did any of the more modern methods show any greater success.  It had taken Man centuries of careful comparison and cross-checking to read the evolutionary history written in the depths of his own planet's crust--to try to date the city was impossible. It was like trying to guess the time by looking at a faceless clock with no hands.  There the city stood--a hundred miles across, ten thousand square miles of complex enigma.  It had given Man his first step into the ever-widening field of Cultural Xenology.  Dave Turnbull finished his sherry, got up from the breakfast nook, and walked into the living room, where his reference books were shelved. The copy of Kleistmeistenoppolous' \"City of Centaurus\" hadn't been opened in years, but he took it down and flipped it open to within three pages of the section he was looking for.  \"It is obvious, therefore, that every one of the indicators points in the same direction. The City was not--_could not have been_--self-supporting. There is no source of organic material on the planet great enough to support such a city; therefore, foodstuffs must have been imported. On the other hand, it is necessary to postulate _some_ reason for establishing a city on an otherwise barren planet and populating it with an estimated six hundred thousand individuals.  \"There can be only one answer: The race that built the City did so for the same reason that human beings built such megalopolises as New York, Los Angeles, Tokyo, and London--because it was a focal point for important trade routes. Only such trade routes could support such a city; only such trade routes give reason for the City's very existence.  \"And when those trade routes changed or were supplanted by others in the course of time, the reason for the City's existence vanished.\"  Turnbull closed the book and shoved it back into place. Certainly the theory made sense, and had for a century. Had Duckworth come across information that would seem to smash that theory?  The planet itself seemed to be perfectly constructed for a gigantic landing field for interstellar ships. It was almost flat, and if the transhipping between the interstellar vessels had been done by air, there would be no need to build a hard surface for the field. And there were other indications. Every fact that had come to light in the ensuing century had been in support of the Greek-German xenologist's theory.  Had Duckworth come up with something new?  If so, why had he decided to discard it and forget his new theory?  If not, why had he formulated the new theory, and on what grounds?  Turnbull lit a cigarette and looked sourly at the smoke that drifted up from its tip. What the devil was eating him? He'd spent too much time away from Earth, that was the trouble. He'd been too deeply immersed in his study of Lobon for the past year. Now all he had to do was get a little hint of something connected with cultural xenology, and his mind went off on dizzy tizzies.  Forget it. Duckworth had thought he was on to something, found out that he wasn't, and discarded the whole idea. And if someone like Scholar James Duckworth had decided it wasn't worth fooling with, then why was a common "]]]
