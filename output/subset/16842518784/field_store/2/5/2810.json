Me next!\" screamed Marjorie. \"I'm fainting, too!\" With a thud, she fell in a heap beside Kitty.  \"The saints presarve us!\" exclaimed the frightened Irishman. \"Whativer is the matther wid these childher? Is it pizened ye are?\"  \"No, only starving,\" said Marjorie, but her faint voice was belied by the merry twinkle in her eyes, which she couldn't suppress at the sight of the man's consternation.  \"Aha! It's shammin' ye are! I see now.\"  \"It's a game,\" explained Kingdon. \"We're shipwrecked on a desert island, and you're a passing captain of a small sailing vessel. Will you take us aboard?\"  \"Shure, sir,\" said the other, his face aglow with Irish wit and intelligence. \"I persave yer manin'. 'Deed I will resky ye, but how will ye get through the deep wathers to me ship forninst?\"  \"You wade over, and carry this lady,\" said King, pointing to Kitty, \"and the rest of us will swim.\"  \"Thot's a foine plan; come along, miss;\" and in a moment Kitty was swung up to the brave rescuer's shoulder, while King and Midget were already \"swimming\" across the grass to the rescue ship.  All clambered into the wagon, and the butcher drove them in triumph to the back door. Here they jumped out, and, after thanking their kind rescuer, they scampered into the house.  \"Such a fun!\" said Rosy Posy, as her mother bathed her heated little face. \"Us was all shipperecked, an' I was Buffaro Bill, an' Boffin was my big wild bear!\"  \"You two are sights!\" said Mrs. Maynard; laughing as she looked at the muddied, grass-stained, and torn condition of Kingdon and Marjorie. \"I'm glad you had your play-clothes on, but I don't see why you always have to have such rough-and-tumble plays.\"  \"'Cause we're a rough-and-tumble pair, Mothery,\" said King; \"look at Kitty there! she kept herself almost spick and span.\"  \"Well, I'm glad I have all sorts of children,\" said Mrs. Maynard. \"Go and get into clean clothes, and be ready for luncheon promptly on time. I'm expecting Miss Larkin.\"  \"Larky! Oh!\" groaned Kingdon. \"I say, Mothery, can't we--us children, I mean--have lunch in the playroom?\" He had sidled up to his mother and was caressing her cheek with his far-from-clean little hands.  \"No,\" said Mrs. Maynard, smiling as she kissed the brown fingers, \"no, my boy, I want all my olive-branches at my table to-day. So, run along now and get civilized.\"  \"Come on, Mops,\" said Kingdon, in a despairing tone, and, with their arms about each other, the two dawdled away.  Kitty had already gone to Nurse to be freshened up. Kitty loved company, and was always ready to put on her best manners.  But King and Midget had so much talking to do, and so many plans to make, that they disliked the restraint that company necessarily put upon their own conversation.  \"I do detest old Larky,\" said the boy, as they went away.  \"I don't mind her so much,\" said Marjorie, \"except when she asks me questions.\"  \"She's always doing that.\"  \"Yes, I know it. But I promised Mother I'd be extra good to-day, and try to talk politely to her. Of course, I can do it if I try.\"  \"So can I,\" said King, with an air of pride in his own powers. \"All right, Mops, let's be 'specially 'stremely good and treat Miss Larkin just lovely.\"  Nearly an hour later the four shipwrecked unfortunates, now transformed into clean, well-dressed civilians, were grouped in the library to await Miss Larkin's arrival.  The lady was an old friend of Mrs. Maynard's, and though by no means elderly, was yet far from being as young as she tried to look and act.  She came tripping in, and after greeting her hostess effusively, she turned to the children.  \"My, my!\" she said. \"What a group of little dears! How you have grown,--every one of you. Kingdon, my dear boy, would you like to kiss me?\"  The request was far from acceptable to King, but the simper that accompanied it so repelled him that he almost forgot his determination to be very cordial to the unwelcome guest. But Midge gave him a warning pinch on his arm, and with an unintelligible murmur of consent, he put up his cheek for the lady's salute.  \"Oh, what a dear boy!\" she gurgled. \"I really think I shall have to take you home with me! And, now, here's Marjorie. How are you, my dear? Do you go to school now? And what are you learning?\"  Miss Larkin's questions always irritated Marjorie, but she answered politely, and then stepped aside in Kitty's favor.  \"Sweet little Katharine,\" said the visitor. \"You are really an angel child. With your golden hair and blue eyes, you're a perfect cherub; isn't she, Mrs. Maynard?\"  \"She's a dear little girl,\" said her mother, smiling, \"but not always angelic. Here's our baby, our Rosamond.\"  \"No, I'se Buffaro Bill!\" declared Rosy Posy, assuming a valiant attitude, quite out of keeping with her smiling baby face and chubby body.  \"Oh, what delicious children! Dear Mrs. Maynard, how good of you to let me come to see them.\"  As Miss Larkin always invited herself, this speech was literally true, but as she and Mrs. Maynard had been schoolmates long ago, the latter felt it her duty to give her friend such pleasure as she could.  At the luncheon table, Miss Larkin kept up a running fire of questions.  This, she seemed to think, was the only way to entertain children.  \"Do you like to read?\" she asked of Marjorie.  \"Yes, indeed,\" said Midget, politely.  \"And what books do you like best?\"  \"Fairy stories,\" said Marjorie, promptly.  \"Oh, tut, tut!\" and Miss Larkin shook a playful finger. \"You should like history. Shouldn't she, now?\" she asked, appealing to Kingdon.  \"We like history, too,\" said Kingdon. \"At least, we like it some; but we both like fairy stories better.\"  \"Ah, well, children will be children. Do you like summer or winter best?\"  This was a poser. It had never occurred to Marjorie to think which she liked best.  \"I like them both alike,\" she said, truthfully.  \"Oh, come now; children should have some mind of their own! Little Miss Kitty, I'm sure you know whether you like summer or winter best.\"  Kitty considered.  \"I like winter best for Christmas, and summer for Fourth of July,\" she said at last, with the air of one settling a weighty matter.  But Miss Larkin really cared nothing to know about these things; it was only her idea of making herself entertaining to her young audience.  \"And you, Baby Rosamond,\" she went on, \"what do you like best in all the world?\"  \"Boffin,\" was the ready reply, \"an' Buffaro Bill, 'cause I'm it.\"  They all laughed at this, for in the Maynard family Rosy Posy's high estimation of herself was well known.  Although it seemed as if it never would, the luncheon at last came to an end.  Mrs. Maynard told the children they might be excused, and she and Miss Larkin would chat by themselves.  Decorously enough, the four left the room, but once outside the house, King gave a wild whoop of joy and turned a double somersault.  Midget threw herself down on a veranda-seat, but with a beaming face, she said:  \"Well, we behaved all right, anyway; but I was 'most afraid I'd be saucy to her one time. It's _such_ a temptation, when people talk like that.\"  \"She talked all the time,\" said Kitty. \"I don't see when she ate anything.\"  \"She didn't,\" said King. \"I suppose she'd rather talk than eat. She's not a bit like us.\"  \"No,\" said Marjorie, emphatically, \"she's not a bit like us!\"     CHAPTER III  PICNIC PLANS   One entire day out of each month Mr. Maynard devoted to the entertainment of his children.  This was a long-established custom, and the children looked forward eagerly to what they called an Ourday.  The day chosen was always a Saturday, and usually the first Saturday of the month, though this was subject to the convenience of the elders.  The children were allowed to choose in turn what the entertainment should be, and if possible their wishes were complied with.  As there had been so much bustle and confusion consequent upon their return from the summer vacation, the September \"Ourday\" did not occur until the second Saturday.  It was Marjorie's turn to choose the sport, for, as she had been away at Grandma Sherwood's all summer, she had missed three Ourdays.  So one morning, early in the week, the matter was discussed at the breakfast table.  \"What shall it be, Midget?\" asked her father. \"A balloon trip, or an Arctic expedition?\"  Marjorie considered.  \"I want something outdoorsy,\" she said, at last, \"and I think I'd like a picnic best. A real picnic in the woods, with lunch-baskets, and a fire, and roasted potatoes.\"  \"That sounds all right to me,\" said Mr. Maynard; \"do you want a lot of people, or just ourselves?\"  It was at the children's pleasure on Ourdays to invite their young friends or to have only the family, as they chose. Sometimes, even, Mrs. Maynard did not go with them, and Mr. Maynard took his young brood off for a ramble in the woods, or a day at the seashore or in the city. He often declared that but for this plan he would never feel really acquainted with his own children.  \"I don't want a lot of people,\" said Marjorie, decidedly; \"but suppose we each invite one. That makes a good-sized picnic.\"  As it was Marjorie's Ourday, her word was law, and the others gladly agreed.  \"I'll ask Dick Fulton,\" said Kingdon. \"I haven't seen much of him since I came home.\"  \"And I'll ask Gladys Fulton, of course,\" said Midget. As Gladys was her most intimate friend in Rockwell, no one was surprised at this.  \"I'll ask Dorothy Adams,\" said Kitty; but Rosy Posy announced: \"I won't ask nobody but Boffin. He's the nicest person I know, an' him an' me can walk with Daddy.\"  \"Next, where shall the picnic be?\" went on Mr. Maynard.  \"I don't know whether I like Pike's Woods best, or the Mill Race,\" said Marjorie, uncertainly.  \"Oh, choose Pike's Woods, Mops,\" put in Kingdon. \"It's lovely there, now, and it's a lot"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23534"],["title","...Or Your Money Back (#1)"],["body","it looked as though Howley was going to let the fifty-one grand just sit there.  Howley nodded apologetically and pulled off everything but two thousand dollars worth of chips.  The third time around, the croupier had his eyes directly on Howley as he repeated the chant: \"Thirteen, Black, Odd, and Low.\" Everybody else at the table was watching Howley, too. The odds against Howley--or anyone else, for that matter--hitting the same number three times in a row are just under forty thousand to one.  Howley didn't want to overdo it. He left two thousand on thirteen, raked in the rest, and twisted the dial on his gadget over a notch.  Everyone at the table gasped as the little ball dropped.  \"That was a near miss,\" whispered a woman standing nearby.  The croupier said: \"Fourteen, Red, Even, and Low.\" And he raked in Howley's two thousand dollars with a satisfied smile. He had seen runs of luck before.  Howley deliberately lost two more spins the same way. Nobody who was actually cheating would call too much attention to himself, and Howley wanted it to look as though he were trying to cover up the fact that he had a sure thing.  He took the gadget out of his pocket and deliberately set it to the green square marked 00. Then he put it back in his pocket and put two thousand dollars on the Double Zero.         *       *       *       *       *  There was more than suspicion in the croupier's eyes when he raked in all the bets on the table except Howley's. It definitely didn't look good to him. A man who had started out with a fifty-dollar bet had managed to run it up to one hundred seventy-four thousand two hundred dollars in six plays.  Howley looked as innocent as possible under the circumstances, and carefully dropped the dial on his gadget back a few notches. Then he bet another two thousand on High, an even money bet.  Naturally, he won.  He twisted the dial back a few more notches and won again on High.  Then he left it where it was and won by betting on Red.  By this time, of course, things were happening. The croupier had long since pressed the alarm button, and five men had carefully surrounded Howley. They looked like customers, but they were harder-looking than the average, and they were watching Howley, not the wheel. Farther back from the crowd, three of the special deputies from the sheriff's office were trying to look inconspicuous in their gray uniforms and white Stetsons and pearl-handled revolvers in black holsters. You can imagine how inconspicuous they looked.  Howley decided to do it up brown. He reset his gadget as surreptitiously as possible under the circumstances, and put his money on thirteen again.  \"Thirteen, Black, Odd, and Low,\" said the croupier in a hollow voice.  The five men in evening dress and the three deputies moved in closer.  Howley nonchalantly scraped in his winnings, leaving the two thousand on the thirteen spot.  There was a combination of hostility and admiration in every eye around the table when the croupier said, \"Thirteen, Black, Odd, and Low\" for the fifth time in the space of minutes. And everyone of those eyes was turned on Jason Howley.  The croupier smiled his professional smile. \"I'm sorry, ladies and gentlemen; we'll have to discontinue play for a while. The gentleman has broken the bank at this table.\" He turned the smile on Howley. \"Congratulations, sir.\"  Howley smiled back and began stacking up over three hundred thousand dollars worth of plastic disks. It made quite a pile.  One of the deputies stepped up politely. \"I'm an officer, sir,\" he said. \"May I help you carry that to the cashier's office?\"  Howley looked at the gold star and nodded. \"Certainly. Thanks.\"  [Illustration]  The other two deputies stepped up, too, and the three of them walked Howley toward the cashier's office. Behind them came the five men in dinner jackets.  \"You'll have to step into the office to cash that much, sir,\" said one of the deputies as he opened the door. Howley walked in as though he hadn't a care in the world. He put his chips on the desk, and the deputies followed suit, while one of the dinner-jacketed men closed the door.  Then one of the deputies said: \"I believe this gentleman is carrying a gun.\"  He had his own revolver out and had it pointed at Howley's middle. \"Carrying a concealed weapon is illegal in this city,\" he went on. \"I'm afraid we'll have to search you.\"  Howley didn't object. He put his hands up high and stood there while his pockets were frisked.  \"Well, well,\" said the deputy coolly. \"What on Earth is this?\"  It was Howley's gadget, and the dial still pointed to Thirteen--Black, Odd, and Low.         *       *       *       *       *  The next morning, I went down to the jail in response to a phone call from Howley. The special deputies had turned him over to the city police and he was being held \"under suspicion of fraud.\" I knew we could beat that down to an \"attempt to defraud,\" but the object was to get Howley off scott-free. After Howley told me the whole story, I got busy pushing the case through. As long as he was simply being held on suspicion, I couldn't get him out on bail, so I wanted to force the district attorney or the police to prefer charges.  Meanwhile, I made sure that Howley's gadget had been impounded as evidence. I didn't want anyone fiddling with it before the case went to court--except, of course, the D. A. and his men. There wasn't much I could do to keep it out of _their_ hands.  After throwing as much weight around as I could, including filing a petition for a writ of habeas corpus with Judge Grannis, I went over to Howley's hotel with a signed power of attorney that Howley had given me, and I got a small envelope out of the hotel safe. It contained a baggage check.  I went over to the bus depot, turned over the check to the baggage department, and went back to my office with a small suitcase. I locked myself in and opened the case. Sure enough, it contained three dozen of the little gadgets.  Then I sat down to wait. By noon, Judge Grannis had issued the writ of habeas corpus, and, rather than release Jason Howley, the police had booked him, and District Attorney Thursby was getting the case ready for the grand jury. There was over a quarter of a million dollars at stake, and the men behind the Golden Casino were bringing pressure to bear. If Howley wasn't convicted, they'd have to give him his money--and that was the last thing they wanted to do. A quarter of a million bucks isn't small potatoes, even to a gambling syndicate.  It wasn't until early on the morning of the third day after Howley's arrest that I got a tip-off from one of my part-time spies. I scooped up the phone when it rang and identified myself.  \"Counselor? Look, this is Benny.\" I recognized the voice and name. Benny was one of the cabbies that I'd done favors for in the past.  \"What's the trouble, Benny?\"  \"Oh, no trouble. I just got a little tip you might be interested in.\"  \"Fire away.\"  \"Well, the D.A. and some of his boys went into the Golden Casino about ten minutes ago, and now they're closin' up the place. Just for a little while, I understand. Hour, maybe. They're chasin' everyone out of the roulette room.\"  \"Thanks, Benny,\" I said, \"thanks a lot.\"  \"Well, I knew you was working on that Howley case, and I thought this might be important, so I--\"  \"Sure, Benny. Come by my office this afternoon. And thanks again.\"  I hung up and started moving.  Within ten minutes, I was pulling up and parking across the street from the Golden Casino. I locked the car and dodged traffic to get across the street, as though I'd never heard of laws against jaywalking.  There were still plenty of people in the Casino. The bar was full, and the dice and card games were going full blast. The slot machines were jingling out their infernal din while fools fed coins into their insatiable innards.  But the roulette room was closed, and a couple of be-Stetsoned deputies were standing guard over the entrance. I headed straight for them.  Both of them stood pat, blocking my way, so I stopped a few feet in front of them.  \"Hello, counselor,\" said one. \"Sorry, the roulette room's closed.\"  I knew the man slightly. \"Let me in, Jim,\" I said. \"I want to see Thursby.\"  The men exchanged glances. Obviously, the D.A. had given them orders.  \"Can't do it, counselor,\" said Jim. \"We're not to let anyone in.\"  \"Tell Thursby I'm out here and that I want to see him.\"  He shrugged, opened the door, stuck his head inside, and called to District Attorney Thursby to tell him that I was outside. I could hear Thursby's muffled \"Damn!\" from within. But when he showed up at the door, his face was all smiles.  \"What's the trouble?\" he asked pleasantly.  I smiled back, giving him my best. \"No trouble at all, Thursby. I just wanted to watch the experiment.\"  \"Experiment?\" He looked honestly surprised, which was a fine piece of acting. \"We're just checking to see if the table's wired, that's all. If it is, your client may be in the clear; maybe we can hang it on the croupier.\"  \"And get a conspiracy charge on my client, too, eh? Well, if you don't mind, I'd like to watch that table check myself. You know how it is.\"  Thursby hesitated, then he scowled. \"Oh, all right. Come on in. But stay out of the way.\"  I grinned. \"Sure. All I want to do is protect my client's interests.\"  Thursby just grunted and opened the door wider to let me in. He was a shrewd lawyer, a good D.A., and basically honest, even if he did have a tendency to bend under pressure from higher up.         *       *       *       *       *  They were checking the table, all right. They had three specialists going over it with everything from fine tooth combs to Geiger counters. They found nothing. No magnets, no wires, no mechanical gimmicks. Nothing.  It took them an hour to take that table apart, check it, and put it back together again. When it was all over, Thursby glanced at me, then said: \"O.K., boys; that does it. Let's go.\"  The"]]]
