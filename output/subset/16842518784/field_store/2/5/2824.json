If Barcelona has ideas of arranging a fix--\"  \"If Barcelona has such notions, Wally Wilson would know about it.\"  \"Everybody,\" I said, \"entertains notions of cleaning up a bundle by having the hundred-to-one shot come in by a length. Even Barcelona must have wild dreams now and then--\"  \"Come off it,\" he snapped. \"Something's up and I want to know what's cooking.\"         *       *       *       *       *  \"Lieutenant, you're now asking me to describe to you how someone might rig the Kentucky Derby in a world full of expert telepaths and perceptives and manipulators, a large number of which will be rather well-paid to lend their extrasensory power to the process of keeping the Derby pure.\"  He eyed me sourly. \"Remember, 'Fireman' O'Leary?\"  \"That's an unfair allegation,\" I replied. \"The rumor that he started the Chicago Fire is absolutely unfounded.\"  \"As I recall, 'Fireman' O'Leary came by his nickname about one hundred years after the holocaust that started on DeKoven Street in 1871. It seems that 'Fireman' O'Leary was most useful in helping the fillies home at Washington Park by assaulting them in the region of the bangtail with small bollops of pure incandescence. He was a pyrotic.\"  \"That is a false accusation--\"  \"It was never proved,\" admitted the lieutenant, \"because any one who accused anybody of making use of extrasensory faculties in 1971 would have been tossed into that establishment out on Narragansett Avenue where the headshrinkers once plied their mystic trade.\"  \"Things are different now.\"  \"Indeed they are, Wally. Which is why I'm here. No one but a fumbling idiot would try anything as crude as speeding a dog over the line by pyrotics or by jolting the animals with a bolt of electrical energy.\"  \"So--?\"  \"So considering the sad and sorry fact that human nature does not change very much despite the vast possibility for improvement, we must anticipate a fix that has been contrived and executed on a level that takes full cognizance of the widespread presence of psi-function.\"  \"But again, why me?\"  \"Was not 'Fireman' O'Leary an ancestor of yours?\"  \"He was my maternal grandparent.\"  \"And so you do indeed come from a long line of horse operators, don't you?\"  \"I resent your invidious implications.\"  \"And wasn't 'Wireless' Wilson the paternal ancestor from whom the family name has come?\"  \"I fail to see ... the allegation that my father's father employed telepathy to transmit track information faster than the wire services has never been proved.\"  He smiled knowingly. \"Wally,\" he said slowly, \"if you feel that allegations have somehow impugned the pure name of your family, you could apply for a review of their several appearances in court. It's possible that 'Fireman' O'Leary did _not_ use his pyrotic talent to enhance the running speed of some tired old dogs.\"  \"But--\"  \"So I think we understand one another, Wally. There is also reason to believe that psionic talent tends to run in families. You're a psi-man and a good one.\"  \"If I hear of anything--\"  \"You'll let me know,\" he said flatly. \"And if Flying Heels, Moonbeam, _and-or_ Lady Grace even so much as succeed in staying on their feet for the whole race, I'll be back demanding to know how you--Wally Wilson--managed to hold them up!\"  After which the good Lieutenant Delancey left me to my thoughts--which were most uncomfortable.  Barcelona had to be kept cheerful. But the dogs he'd picked could only come in first unassisted if they happened to be leading the field that started the _next_ race, and even then the post time would have to be delayed to give them a longer head start. That meant that _if_ our three platers came awake, _everybody_ would be looking for the fix.  Anybody who planned a caper would sure have to plan it well.  Barcelona hadn't planned the fix, he merely stated a firm desire and either Barcelona got what he wanted or I got what I didn't want, and I had to do it real good or Delancey would make it real hot for me.  I was not only being forced to enter a life of crime, I was also being forced to perform cleverly.  It wasn't fair for the law to gang up with the crooks against me.  And so with a mind feeling sort of like the famous sparrow who'd gotten trapped for three hours in a badminton game at Forest Hills, I built a strong highball, and poured it down while my halluscene set was warming up. I needed the highball as well as the relaxation, because I knew that the \"Drama\" being presented was the hundred and umpty-umpth remake of \"Tarzan of the Apes\" and for ninety solid minutes I would be swinging through trees without benefit of alcohol. Tarzan, you'll remember, did not learn to smoke and drink until the second book.         *       *       *       *       *  The halluscene did relax me and kept my mind from its worry even though the drama was cast for kids and therefore contained a maximum of tree-swinging and ape-gymnastics and a near dearth of Lady Jane's pleasant company. What was irritating was the traces of wrong aroma. If one should not associate the African jungle with the aroma of a cheap bar, one should be forgiven for objecting to Lady Jane with a strong flavor of tobacco and cheap booze on her breath.  And so I awoke with this irritating conflict in my senses to discover that I'd dropped out of my character as Tarzan and my surroundings of the jungle, but I'd somehow brought the stench of cheap liquor and moist cigarettes with me.  There was an occupant in the chair next to mine. He needed a bath and he needed a shave but both would have been wasted if he couldn't change his clothing, too. His name was Gimpy Gordon.  I said, \"Get out!\"  He whined, \"Mr. Wilson, you just gotta help me.\"  \"How?\"  \"Fer years,\" he said, \"I been living on peanuts. I been runnin' errands for hard coins. I been--\"  \"Swiping the take of a Red Cross box,\" I snapped at him.  \"Aw, Mr. Wilson,\" he whined, \"I simply gotta make a stake. I'm a-goin' to send it back when I win.\"  \"Are you going to win?\"  \"Can't I?\"  For a moment I toyed with the idea of being honest with the Gimp. Somehow, someone should tell the duffer that all horse players die broke, or that if he could make a living I'd be out of business.  Gimpy Gordon was one of Life's Unfortunates. If it were to rain gold coins, Gimpy would be out wearing boxing gloves. His mental processes meandered because of too much methyl. His unfortunate nickname did not come from the old-fashioned reason that he walked with a limp, but from the even more unfortunate reason that he _thought_ with a limp. In his own unhealthy way he was--could we call it \"Lucky\" by any standard of honesty? In this world full of highly developed psi talent, the Gimp _could_ pick a pocket and get away with it because he often literally could not remember where and how he'd acquired the wallet for longer than a half minute. And it was a sort of general unwritten rule that any citizen so utterly befogged as to permit his wealth to be lifted via light fingers should lose it as a lesson!  But then it did indeed occur to me that maybe I could make use of the Gimp.  I said, \"What can I do, Gimpy?\"  \"Mr. Wilson,\" he pleaded, \"is it true that you're workin' for Barcelona?\"  \"Now, you know I can't answer that.\"  I could read his mind struggling with this concept. It was sort of like trying to read a deck of Chinese Fortune Cards being shuffled before they're placed in the machine at the Penny Arcade. As the drunk once said after reading the Telephone Directory: \"Not much plot, but _egad_! What a cast of characters!\" The gist of his mental maundering was a childlike desire to have everything sewed up tight. He wanted to win, to be told that he'd win, and to have all the rules altered ad hoc to assure his winning.  Just where he'd picked up the inside dope that Barcelona favored Flying Heels, Moonbeam, and Lady Grace in the Derby I could not dig out of him. Just how Gimpy had made the association between this clambake and me--good old Wally Wilson--I couldn't dig either. But here he was with his--by now--sixty-five bucks carefully heisted, lifted, pinched and fingered, and by the great Harry, Gimpy was not a-goin' to lay it across the board on those three rejects from a claiming race unless he had a cast-iron assurance that they'd come in across the board, one, two, and three.  I said slowly, \"_If_ I were even thinking of working for Mr. Barcelona,\" I told him, \"I would be very careful never, never to mention it, you know.\"         *       *       *       *       *  This bundle of The Awful Truth hit him and began to sink in with the inexorable absorption of water dropping down into a bucket of dry sand. It took some time for the process to climax. Once it reached Home Base it took another period of time for the information to be inspected, sorted out, identified, analyzed, and in a very limited degree, understood.  [Illustration]  He looked up at me. \"I couldn't cuff a hundred, could I?\"  I shook my head. I didn't have to veil my mind because I knew that Gimpy was about as talented a telepath as a tallow candle. Frankly between me and thee, dear reader, I do not put anybody's bet on the cuff. I do a fair-to-middling brisk trade in booking bets placed and discussed by telepathy, but the ones I accept and pay off on--if they're lucky--are those folks who've been sufficiently foresighted to lay it on the line with a retainer against which their losses can be assessed.  On the other hand I could see in Gimpy's mind the simple logic that told him that as a bookmaker I'd be disinclined to lend him money which he'd use to place with me against a sure-thing long shot. If I were to \"Lend\" him a century for an on-the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23599"],["title","The Big Fix (#2)"],["body","-cuff bet on a 100:1 horse, especially one that I knew was sure to come in, I might better simply hand him one hundred times one hundred dollars as a gift. It would save a lot of messy bookkeeping.  So the fact that I wouldn't cuff a bet for Gimpy gave him his own proof that I was confirming the fix.  Then I buttered the process.  \"Gimp, do you know another good bookmaker?\"  \"Sure. But you're the best.\"  \"Know one that'll take a bet from you--one that you don't like?\"  \"Sure, Mr. Wilson.\"  \"Then,\" I said hauling a thousand out of my wallet, \"Put this on _our horses_ for me.\"  He eyed the grand. \"But won't Mr. Barcelona be unhappy? Won't that run down the track odds?\"  I laughed. \"The whole world knows them dogs as also-rans,\" I said. \"Gimpy, they put long shots like those into races just to clip the suckers who think there is a real hundred-to-one chance that a 100:1 horse will outrun favorites.\"  \"Well, if you say so, Mr. Wilson.\"  \"I say so.\"  \"Thanks. I'll pay it back.\"  He would. I'd see to that.  Gimpy Gordon scuttled out of my bailiwick almost on a dead run. He was positively radiating merriment and joy and excitement. The note in his hand represented a sum greater than he had ever seen in one piece at any time of his life, and the concept of the riches he would know when they paid off on the Kentucky Derby was vague simply because Gimpy could not grasp the magnitude of such magnificence. Oddly, for some unexpected reason or from some unknown source hidden deep in his past, his mind pronounced it \"Darby.\"         *       *       *       *       *  I returned to my African jungle still bored with the lack of anything constructive. I returned at about the point where Tarzan and Jane were going through that silly, \"Me Tarzan; You Jane\" routine which was even more irritating because the program director or someone had muffed the perfume that the Lady Jane wore. Instead of the wholesome freshness of the free, open air, Jane was wearing a heady, spicy scent engineered to cut its way through the blocking barrier of stale cigar smoke, whisky-laden secondhand air, and a waft of cooking aroma from the kitchen of the standard cosmopolitan bistro.  Worse, it got worse instead of better. Where a clever effects-director might have started with the heavy sophisticated scent and switched to something lighter and airier as Jane was moved away from civilization, this one had done it backwards for some absolutely ridiculous reason. It finally got strong enough to distract me out of my characterization, and I came back to reality to realize once more that reality had been strong enough to cut into the concentration level of a halluscene. There was strong woman-presence in my room, and as I looked around I found that Tomboy Taylor had come in--just as Gimpy Gordon had--and was sitting in the other halluscene chair. She was probably playing Lady Jane to my Tarzan.  Tomboy Taylor had changed to a short-skirted, low-necked cocktail dress; relaxed with her eyes closed in my halluscene chair she looked lovely. She looked as vulnerable as a soft kitten. Remembering that it's the soft vulnerable ones that claw you if you touch, I refrained.  I went to my little bar and refilled my highball glass because swinging through the jungle makes one thirsty, and while I was pouring I took a sly peek into Tomboy Taylor's mind.  She was not halluscening. She was watching me. And when I made contact with her, she radiated a sort of overall aura of amusement-emotion, covered up her conscious deliberation, and blocked any probing by directing me mentally, \"Make it two, Wally.\"  I built her one, handed it to her, and then said, \"Folks these days sure have forgotten how to use doorbells.\"  \"If you don't want people coming in, Wally, you should restrict your mindwarden a little. It's set to admit anybody who does not approach the door with vigorous intent to commit grave physical harm. When the thing radiates 'Come in and relax' is a girl supposed to stand outside twiggling on the doorbell?\"  I dropped the subject thinking that maybe I shouldn't have brought it up in the first place. It's one that can't be answered by logic, whereas a firm emotional statement of like or dislike stops all counter-argument and I'd made the mistake of questioning my own judgment.  So I eyed her and said, \"Tomboy, you did not come here to indulge in small talk.\"  \"No,\" she admitted. \"I'm here to keep track of you, Wally.\"  \"Oh?\"  \"Our great and good friend wants me to make notes on how clever you are at arranging things.\"  \"You mean Barcelona sent you.\"  \"That's about it.\"  I looked at her askance. \"And how long are you going to stay?\"  She smiled. \"Until Flying Heels, Moonbeam, and Lady Grace come across the finish line One, Two, and Three at Churchill Downs on Derby Day.\"  I grinned at her. \"Considering that trio of turtles, Tomboy, it may be for years and it may be forever.\"  She held up her glass in a sort of a toast. \"Or,\" she said, \"'Til death do us part!\"  A little bitterly I said, \"One might think that Barcelona doesn't trust me.\"  She replied, \"It isn't a matter of trust. Barcelona holds you among his very closest friends. He is well aware of the fact that you would do anything for him, that you prize his friendship so highly yourself that you would go to the most desperate lengths to keep it firm and true. Yet he realizes that the simple desire he has recently expressed does place you in a delicate mental attitude. You are likely to feel that he shouldn't have expressed this desire since you feel obligated to fulfill it. He feels that maybe this obligation to maintain friendship at all costs may cause resentment. Since Barcelona does not want you to resent him, he sent me to be your companion in the hope that I might get some forewarning should your friendship for him begin to weaken.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Just why in this day and age she didn't just come out and say--or think--flatly that she was there to keep me in line, I don't know. But there she was, talking all around the main point and delivering the information by long-winded inference.  Even so, without her Pittsburgh stogie, Tomboy Taylor was a mighty attractive dish, and I knew that she could also be a bright and interesting conversationalist if she wanted to be. Under other circumstances I might have enjoyed the company, but it was no pleasure to know that every grain of her one hundred and fourteen pounds avoirdupois was Barcelona's Personal Property. At that moment I realized that I was not too much concerned with what Barcelona's reaction might be. Instead, I was wishing that things were different so that any activity between us would be for our own personal gain and pleasure rather than the order of or the fight against one Joseph Barcelona. There was one consolation. Tomboy Taylor had not come equipped with a box of Pittsburgh stogies with which to make my appreciation of beauty throw up its lunch.  She said, sweetly, \"The better to ensnare you, my dear.\"  But as she spoke, for just a moment her thick woolly mind shield thinned out enough for me to catch a strange, puzzled grasp for understanding. As if for the first time she had been shown how admiration for physical attractiveness could be both honest and good. That my repugnant attitude over her Pittsburgh stogies was not so much based upon the spoiling of beauty by the addition of ugliness, but the fact that the act itself cheapened her in my eyes.  Then she caught me peeking and clamped down a mind screen that made the old so-called \"Iron Curtain\" resemble a rusty sieve.  \"I'm the one that's supposed to keep track of you, you remember,\" she said, once more covering up and leaping mentally to the attack.  \"I'll remember,\" I said. \"But will you tell me something?\"  \"Maybe,\" she said in a veiled attitude.  \"Is your boy friend really interested in cleaning up, or is he interested in watching me squirm out of a trap he set for me?\"  \"In the first place,\" she said, \"I may have been seen in Barcelona's presence but please remember that my association with Mr. Joseph Barcelona has always been strictly on a financial plane. This eliminates the inference contained under the phrase 'Boy Friend.' Check?\"  \"O.K., Tomboy, if that's the--\"  \"That's not only the way I want it,\" she said, \"but that's the way it always has been and always will be. Second, I have been getting tired of this nickname 'Tomboy'. If we're going to be racked this close together, you'll grate on my nerves less if you use my right name. It's just plain 'Nora' but I'd like to hear it once in a while.\"  I nodded soberly. I held out a hand but she put her empty highball glass in it instead of her own little paw. I shrugged and mixed and when I returned and handed it to her I said, \"I'll make you a deal. I'll call you 'Nora' just so long as you maintain the manners and attitude of a female, feminine, lady-type woman. I'll treat you like a woman, but you've got to earn it. Is that a deal?\"  She looked at me, her expression shy and as defenseless as a bruiser-type caught reading sentimental poetry. I perceived that I had again touched a sensitive spot by demanding that she be more than physically spectacular. Her defenses went down and I saw that she really did not know the answer to my question. I did. It had to do with something that only the achievement of a God-like state--or extreme old age--would change.  This time it was not so much the answer to why little boys walk high fences in front of little girls. It had much more to do with the result of what happens between little boys when the little girl hides her baseball bat and straightens the seams of her stockings when one certain little boy comes into sight. Joseph Barcelona did not admire my ability. He had, therefore, caused me to back myself into a corner where I'd be taken down a peg, shown-up as a second-rater--with the little girl as a witness.  And why had Barcelona been so brash as to send the"]]]
