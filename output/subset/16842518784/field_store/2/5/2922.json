He made his report to the ship's captain. \"We're within easy range of her, sir,\" he finished. \"Shall we pick her up?\"  \"Might be a Rat trick,\" said the captain. \"But we'll have to take the chance. Beam a call to Earth, and let's go out there dead slow. If the detectors show anything funny, we turn tail and run. We're in no position to fight a Rat ship.\"  \"You think this might be a Rat trap, sir?\"  The captain grinned. \"If you are referring to the _Muldoon_ as a rat trap, Mr. Blake, you're both disrespectful and correct. That's why we're going to run if we see anything funny. This ship is already obsolete by our standards; you can imagine what it is by theirs.\" He paused. \"Get that call in to Earth. Tell 'em this ship is using a distress signal that was obsolete six months ago. And tell 'em we're going out.\"  \"Yes, sir,\" said the signal officer.  It wasn't a trap. As the _Muldoon_ approached the source of the signal, their detectors picked up the ship itself. It was a standard lifeboat from a battleship of the _Shannon_ class.  \"You don't suppose that's from the _Shane_, do you?\" the captain said softly as he looked at the plate. \"She's the only ship of that class that's missing. But if that's a _Shane_ lifeboat, what took her so long to get here?\"  \"She's cut her engines, sir!\" said the observer. \"She evidently knows we're coming.\"  \"All right. Pull her in as soon as we're close enough. Put her in Number Two lifeboat rack; it's empty.\"         *       *       *       *       *  When the door of the lifeboat opened, the captain of the _Muldoon_ was waiting outside the lifeboat rack. He didn't know exactly what he had expected to see, but it somehow seemed fitting that a lean, bearded man in a badly worn uniform and a haggard look about him should step out.  The specter saluted. \"Lieutenant Alfred Pendray, of the _Shane_,\" he said, in a voice that had almost no strength. He held up a pouch. \"Microfilm,\" he said. \"Must get to Earth immediately. No delay. Hurry.\"  \"Catch him!\" the captain shouted. \"He's falling!\" But one of the men nearby had already caught him.  In the sick bay, Pendray came to again. The captain's questioning gradually got the story out of Pendray.  \"... So I didn't know what to do then,\" he said, his voice a breathy whisper. \"I knew I had to get that stuff home. Somehow.\"  \"Go on,\" said the captain, frowning.  \"Simple matter,\" said Pendray. \"Nothing to it. Two equations. Little ship goes thirty times as fast as big ship--big _hulk_. Had to get here before 22 June. _Had_ to. Only way out, y'unnerstand.  \"Anyway. Two equations. Simple. Work 'em in your head. Big ship takes ten months, little one takes ten days. But can't stay in a little ship ten days. No shielding. Be dead before you got here. See?\"  \"I see,\" said the captain patiently.  \"_But_--and here's a 'mportant point: If you stay on the big ship for eight an' a half months, then y' only got to be in the little ship for a day an' a half to get here. Man can live that long, even under that radiation. See?\" And with that, he closed his eyes.  \"Do you mean you exposed yourself to the full leakage radiation from a lifeboat engine for thirty-six hours?\"  But there was no answer.  \"Let him sleep,\" said the ship's doctor. \"If he wakes up again, I'll let you know. But he might not be very lucid from here on in.\"  \"Is there anything you can do?\" the captain asked.  \"No. Not after a radiation dosage like that.\" He looked down at Pendray. \"His problem was easy, mathematically. But not psychologically. That took real guts to solve.\"  \"Yeah,\" said the captain gently. \"All he had to do was _get_ here alive. The problem said nothing about his staying that way.\""]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24149"],["title","The Ambulance Made Two Trips (#1)"],["body","chicken! He couldn't come to work and plant a fire bomb to set fire to the place!... I know it must be upsetting to have things like that automobile accident and my truck not blowing up and now Jacaro's pants instead of my business going up in flames. But I told you--\"  He stopped and listened. Once he grinned.  \"Wait!\" he said after a moment. He covered the transmitter and turned to Fitzgerald. \"What hospital is Jacaro in?\"  Fitzgerald said sourly: \"He wasn't burned bad. Just blistered. They lent him some pants and he went home cussing.\"  \"Thanks,\" said Brink. He uncovered the transmitter. \"He went home,\" he told the instrument. \"You can ask him about it. In a way I'm sure it wasn't his fault. I'm quite sure his eyelids twitched when he started out. I think the men who drove the car the other day had twitching eyelids, too. You should ask--\"  The detective heard muted noises, as it a man shouted into a transmitter somewhere.  Brink said briskly: \"No, I don't see any reason to change my mind.... No.... I know it was luck, if you want to put it that way, but.... No. I wouldn't advise that! Please take my advice about when your eyelid twitches--\"  Fitzgerald heard the crash of the receiver hung up at some distant place. Brink rubbed his ear. He turned back.  \"Hm-m-m,\" he said. \"Your pipe's gone out.\"  It was. Sergeant Fitzgerald puffed ineffectually. Brink reached out his finger and tapped the bowl of the detective's pipe. Instantly fragrant smoke filled the detective's mouth. He sputtered.  \"Now.... where were we?\" asked Brink.  \"Who was that?\" demanded Fitzgerald ferociously. \"That was Big Jake Connors!\"  \"You may be right.\" Brink told him. \"He's never exactly given me his name. He just calls up every so often and talks nonsense.\"  \"What sort of nonsense?\"  \"He wants to be a partner in this business,\" said Brink without emotion. \"He's been saying that things will happen to it otherwise. I don't believe it. Anyhow nothing's happened so far.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Detective Sergeant Fitzgerald tried at one and the same time to roar and to swallow. He accomplished neither. He put his finger in the bowl of his pipe. He jerked it out, scorched.  \"Look!\" he said almost hoarsely, \"I was tellin' you when the phone rang! We got a police force here in town! This's what we've been tryin' to get! You come along with me to Headquarters an' swear to a complaint--\"  Brink said interestedly: \"Why?\"  \"That guy Big Jake Connors!\" raged the detective. \"That's why! Tryin' to threaten you into givin' him a share in your business! Tryin' to burn it down or blow it up when you won't! He was just a small-town crook, once. He went to the big town an' came back with ideas. He's usin' 'em!\"  Brink looked at him expectantly.  \"He started a beer business,\" said the detective bitterly. \"Simultaneous other beer dealers started havin' trouble. Empty kegs smashed. Trucks broke down. Drivers in fights. They hadda go outta business!\"  \"What did the cops do?\" asked Brink.  \"They listened to their wives!\" snarled Fitzgerald. \"They begun to find little grabbag packages in the mail an' with the milk. Fancy perfume. Tricky stockin's. Fancy underwear they shoulda been ashamed for anybody to know they had it on underneath. The cops weren't bribed, but their wives liked openin' the door of a mornin' an' findin' charmin' little surprises.\"  \"Ah,\" said Brink.  \"Then there were juke boxes,\" went on the detective. \"He went in that business--an' trouble started. People'd drive up to a beer joint, go in, get in a scuffle an'--bingo! The juke box smashed. Always the juke box. Always a out-of-town customer. Half the juke boxes in town weren't workin', on an average. But the ones that were workin' were always Big Jake's. Presently he had the juke-box business to himself.\"  Brink nodded, somehow appreciatively.  \"Then it was cabs,\" said Fitzgerald. \"A lot of cops felt bad about that. But their wives wouldn't be happy if anything happened to dear Mr. Big Jake who denied that he gave anybody anything, so it was all right to use that lovely perfume.... Cabs got holes in their radiators. They got sand in their oil systems. They had blowouts an' leaks in brake-fluid lines. Cops' wives were afraid Big Jake would get caught. But he didn't. He started insurin' cabs against that kinda accident. Now every cab-driver pays protection-money for what they call insurance--or else. An' cops' wives get up early, bright-eyed, to see what Santa Claus left with the milk.\"  \"You seem,\" said Brink with a grin, \"to hint that this Big Jake is ... well ... dishonest.\"  \"Dishonest!\" Fitzgerald's face was purplish, from many memories of wrongs. \"There was a guy named Burdock who owned this business before you. Y'know what happened to him?\"  \"Yes,\" said Brink. \"He's my brother-in-law. Connors or somebody insisted on having a share of the business and threatened dreadful things if he didn't. He didn't. So acid got spilled on clothes. Machinery got smashed. Once a whole delivery-truck load of clothes disappeared and my brother-in-law had to pay for any number of suits and dresses. It got him down. He's recovering from the nervous strain now, and my sister ... eh, asked me to help out. So I offered to take over. He warned me I'd have the same trouble.\"  \"And you've got it!\" fumed the detective. \"But anyhow you'll make a complaint. We'll get out some warrants, and we'll have somethin' to go on--\"  \"But nothing's happened to complain about,\" said Brink, quite reasonably. \"One broken window's not worth a fuss.\"  \"But somethin's goin' to happen!\" insisted the detective. \"That guy Big Jake is poison! He's takin' over the whole town, bit by bit! You've been lucky so far, but your luck could run out--\"  Brink shook his head.  \"No-o-o,\" he said matter-of-factly. \"I'm grateful to you, Mr. Fitzgerald, but I have a special kind of luck. I won't tell you about it because you wouldn't believe but--but I can give you some of it. If you don't mind, I will.\"  He went to the slightly dusty, partly-plastic machine. On its shelf were some parts of metal, and some of transparent plastic, and some grayish, granular substance it was hard to identify. There was an elaborate diagram of something like an electronic circuit inside, but it might have been a molecular diagram from organic chemistry. Brink made an adjustment and pressed firmly on a special part of the machine, which did not yield at all. Then he took a slip of plastic out of a slot in the bottom.  \"You can call this a good-luck charm,\" he said pleasantly, \"or a talisman. Actually it's a psionic unit. One like it works very well, for me. Anyhow there's no harm in it. Just one thing. If your eyelids start to twitch, you'll be headed for danger or trouble or something unpleasant. So if they do twitch, stop and be very, very careful. Please!\"  He handed the bit of plastic to Fitzgerald, who took it without conscious volition.  Then Brink said briskly: \"If there isn't anything else--\"  \"You won't swear out a warrant against Big Jake?\" demanded Fitzgerald bitterly.  \"I haven't any reason to,\" said Brink amiably. \"I'm doing all right. He hasn't harmed me. I don't think he will.\"  \"O.K.!\" said the detective bitterly. \"Have it your way! But he's got it in for you an' he's goin' to keep tryin' until he gets you! An' whether you like it or not, you're goin' to have some police protection as soon as I can set it up.\"  He stamped out of the cleaning-and-drying plant. Automatically, he put the bit of plastic in his pocket. He didn't know why. He got into his car and drove downtown. As he drove, he looked suspiciously at his pipe. He fumed. As he fumed, he swore. He did not like mysteries. But there was no mystery about his dislike for Big Jake Connors. He turned aside from the direct route to Headquarters to indulge it. He drove to a hospital where four out-of-town hoods had been carried two days before. He marched inside and up to a second-floor corridor door with a uniformed policeman seated outside it.         *       *       *       *       *  \"Hm-m-m. Donnelly,\" he growled. \"How about those guys?\"  \"Not so good,\" said the patrolman. \"They're gettin' better.\"  \"They would,\" growled Fitzgerald.  \"A lawyer's been to see 'em twice,\" said the patrolman. \"He's comin' back after lunch.\"  \"He would,\" grunted the detective.  \"They want out,\" said the cop.  \"I'm not surprised,\" said Detective Sergeant Fitzgerald.  He went into the sick room. There were four patients in it, none of them looking exactly like gentle invalids. There were two broken noses of long-ago dates, three cauliflower ears, and one scar of a kind that is not the result of playing lawn tennis. Two were visibly bandaged, and the others adhesive-taped. All of them looked at Fitzgerald without cordiality.  \"Well, well, well!\" he said. \"You fellas still here!\" There was silence. \"In union there is strength,\" said Fitzgerald. \"As long as you stay in one room everybody's sure the others haven't started rattin'. Right?\"  One of the four snarled silently at him.  \"It was just a accident,\" pursued the detective. \"You four guys are ridin' along peaceable, merrily takin' the air, when quite inadvertently one of you almost blows the head off of another, and he's so astonished at there bein' a gun in the car that he wrecks it. And when they get you guys in the hospital there ain't one of you knows anything about four sawed-off shotguns and a tommy gun in the car with you. Strange! Strange! Strange!\"  Four faces regarded him with impassive dislike. The bandaged ones were prettier than the ones that weren't.  \"That tommy gun business,\" explained Fitzgerald, \"is a federal affair. It's against Fed law to carry 'em around loaded. And your friend Big Jake hasn't been leavin' presents on the White House steps. Y'know, you guys could be in trouble!\"  Three pairs of eyes and an odd one--the other was hidden under a bandage--stared at him stonily.  \"Y'see,\" explained Fitzgerald again, \"Big Jake's"]]]
