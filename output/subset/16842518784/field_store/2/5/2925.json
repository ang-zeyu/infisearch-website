She stood a head taller than this dried up stranger; she knew the Earthwoman's strength would be no match for hers.  \"My name is Mryna Brill,\" she said quietly. \"I came up in a god-car from Rythar.\"  \"Rythar?\" The woman's mouth fell open. She whispered the word as if it were profanity. Suddenly she turned and ran down the rim corridor, screaming in terror.  _She's afraid of me_! Mryna thought. And that made no sense at all.  Mryna knew she had to get back to the god-car quickly. Since the Earthmen had built up the taboos in order to get their sacrifice ores from Rythar, they would do everything they could to prevent her return. She ran toward an intersecting spoke corridor. An alarm bell began to clang, and the sound vibrated against the metal walls. An armed man sprang from a side room and fired his weapon at Mryna. The discharge burned a deep groove in the wall.  So they would even kill her--these men who pretended to be gods!  Before the man could fire again, Mryna swung down a side corridor, and at once the sensation of weightlessness overtook her. She could not move quickly. She saw the armed man at the mouth of the corridor. Frantically she pushed open the door of a room, which was crowded with consoles of transmission machines. Three men were seated in front of the speakers. They jumped and came toward her, clumsily fighting the weightlessness.  Mryna caught at the door jamb and swung herself toward the ceiling. At the same time the armed man fired. The discharge missed her and washed against the transmission machinery. Blue fire exploded from the room. The three men screamed in agony. Concussion threw Mryna helplessly toward the rim again.  And the Guardian Wheel was plunged into darkness. Mryna's head swam; her shoulder seethed with pain where she had banged into the wall. She tried to creep toward the circular room, but she had lost her sense of direction and she found herself back on the rim.  The clanging bell had stopped when the lights went out, but Mryna heard the panic of frightened voices. Far away someone was screaming. Running feet clattered toward her. Mryna flattened herself against the outer wall. An indistinct body of men shot past her.  \"From Rythar,\" one of them was saying. \"A woman from Rythar!\"  \"And we've blasted the communication center. We've no way of sending the warning back to Earth--\"  They were gone.   Mryna moved back into the spoke corridor. She felt her way silently toward the circular hub room and the god-car. Suddenly very close she heard voices which she recognized--the man and the woman who had been talking in the supply room.  \"You're still all right, Dick,\" the woman said. \"She hasn't been here long enough to--\"  \"We don't know that. We don't know how it spreads or how quickly. We can't take the chance.\"  \"Then ... then we've no choice?\" Her voice was a small whisper, choked with terror.  \"None. These have been standing emergency orders for twenty years. We always faced the possibility that one of them would escape. If we'd been allowed to use a different policy of education--but the politicians wouldn't permit that. The Wheel has to be destroyed, and we must die with it.\"  \"Couldn't we wait and make sure?\"  \"It works too fast. None of us would be able to do the job--afterward.\"   The voices moved away. Mryna floated toward the hub room. She found the air lock and pulled herself into the god-car. The metal lock hissed closed and light came on. Then she knew she had made a mistake. This ship was not the one she had used when she came up from Rythar. The tiny cabin was fitted with a sleeping lounge, a food cabinet and a file of reading films. Above the lounge a mica viewplate gave her a broad view of the sky.  Mryna remembered that the man in the supply room had said he was waiting for an auto-pickup; he was on his way back to Earth. Mryna had taken his ship instead of her own. In panic she tried to open the door again, but she found no way to do it. Machinery beneath her feet began to hum. She felt a slight lurch as the pickup left the hub of the Guardian Wheel.  It swung in a wide arc. Through the viewplate she saw the enormous Wheel growing small behind her, silhouetted against the mist of Rythar. Suddenly the wheel glowed red with a soundless explosion. Its flaming fragments died in the void.  Mryna dropped weakly on the lounge. Nausea spun through her mind. The man had said they would destroy themselves. Because Mryna had come aboard? But why were they afraid of her? What possible harm could she do them? Mryna had left Rythar to discover the truth, and the truth was insanity. Was truth always like this--a bitter disillusionment, an empty horror?  She had something else to say to the people of Rythar now: not that the gods were men, but that men were mad. Believe in the taboos; send up the sacrificial ores. It was a small price to pay to keep that madness away from Rythar.  And Mryna knew she could not go back. With the Wheel gone, she could never return to Rythar; the auto-pickup was carrying her inexorably toward Earth. The scream of the machinery slowly turned shrill, hammering against her eardrums. The stars visible in the viewplate blurred and winked out. Mryna felt a twist of vertigo as the shuttle shifted from conventional speed into a time warp. And then the sound was gone. The ship was floating in an impenetrable blackness.  Mryna had no idea how much time passed subjectively. When she became hungry, she took food from the cabinet. She slept when she was tired. To pass the time, she turned the reading films through the projector.  Most of the film stored in the shuttle covered material Mryna already knew. The Earthmen, clearly, had not denied any information to Rythar. Only one thing had been restricted--astronomy. And that would have made no difference, if Mryna had not found the text in the ruins of the Old Village. The people on Rythar never saw the stars; they had no way of knowing--or caring--what lay above the rain mist.  Mryna was more interested in the history of Earth, which she had never known before. She studied the pictures of the great industrial centers and the crowded countryside. She was awed by the mobs in the city streets and the towering buildings. Yet she liked her own world more--the forests and the clear-running brooks; the vast, uncrowded, open spaces.  It puzzled her that the people of Earth would give the Rytharian paradise to a handful of children, when their own world was so overcrowded. Was this another form of the madness that had driven the people in the Wheel to destroy themselves? That made a convenient explanation, yet Mryna's mind was too logical to accept it.  One film referred to the founding of the original colony on Rythar, a planet in the Sirian System which had been named for its discoverer. Rythar, according to the film, was one of a score of colonies established by Earth. It was unbelievably rich in deposits of uranium.  That, Mryna surmised, was the name of the sacrificial ore they sent up in the god-cars.  The atmosphere and gravity of Rythar duplicated that of Earth; Rythar should have become the largest colony in the system. The government of Earth had originally planned a migration of ten million persons.  \"But after twelve months the survey colony was destroyed by an infection,\" Mryna read on the projection screen, \"which has never been identified. It is called simply the Sickness. The origin of this plague is unknown. No adult in the survey colony survived; children born on Rythar are themselves immune, but are carriers of the Sickness. The first rescue team sent to save them died within eight hours. No human being, aside from these native-born children, has ever survived the Sickness.\"   Now Mryna had the whole truth. She knew the motivation for their madness of self-destruction. It was not insanity, but the sublime courage of a few human beings sacrificing themselves to save the rest of their civilization. They smashed the Guardian Wheel to keep the Sickness there. And Mryna had already escaped before that happened! She was being hurled through space toward Earth and she would destroy that, too.  If she killed herself, that would in no way alter the situation. The ship would still move in its appointed course. Her body would be aboard; perhaps the very furnishings in the cabin were now infected with the germ of the Sickness. When the ship touched Earth, the fatal poison would escape.  Dully Mryna turned up another frame on the film, and she read what the Earthmen had done to help Rythar. They built the Guardian Wheel to isolate the Sickness. Sealed in metal immunization suits, volunteers had descended to the plague world and reared the surviving children of the colonists until they were old enough to look out for themselves. The answer house had been set up as an instructional device.  \"As nearly as possible, the scientists in charge attempted to create a normal social situation for the plague carriers. They could never be allowed to leave Rythar, but when they matured enough to know the truth, Rythar could be integrated into the colonial system. Rytharian uranium is already a significant trade factor in the colonial market. An incidental by-product of the Guardian Wheel is the hospital facility, where advanced cases of certain cancers and lung diseases have been cured in a reduced gravity or by exposure to cosmic radiation.\"  Mryna shut off the projection. The words made sense, but the results did not. And she knew precisely why Earth had failed. When they matured--in those three words she had her answer.  And now it didn't matter. There was nothing she could do. Her ship was a poisoned arrow aimed directly at the heart of man's civilization.   Mryna had slept twice when the auto-pickup lurched out of the time drive and she was able to see the stars again. Directly ahead of her she saw an"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24159"],["title","Customs and Fashions in Old New England (#1)"],["body","hearbs and      flowers, then pour on three Gallons of the Strongest Ale, and let      it stand all night, in the morning put in three ounces of Cloves      beaten, sixpennyworth of beaten Saffron, and on the top of them six      ounces of shaved Hartshorne, then set on the Limbeck, and close it      with paste and so receive the water by pintes, which will be nine      in all, the first is the strongest, whereof take in the morning two      spoonfuls in four spoonfuls of small Beer, the like in the      Afternoon.\"  Truly, the poor rickety child deserved to be cured. Snails also were used externally:       \"To anoint the Ricketed Childs Limbs and to recover it in a short      time, though the child be so lame as to go upon crutches:       \"Take a peck of Garden Snailes and bruse them, put them into a      course Canvass bagg, and hang it up, and set a dish under to      receive the liquor that droppeth from them, wherewith anoint the      Childe in every Joynt which you perceive to be weak before the fire      every morning and evening. This I have known make a Patient Childe      that was extream weak to go alone using it only a week time.\"  There were also \"unguents to anoynt the Ricketted Childs breast,\" and various drinks to be given \"to the patient childe fasting,\" as they termed him in what appears to us a half-comic, though wholly truthful appellation.  For worms and fits there were some frightful doses of senna and rhubarb and snails, with a slight redeeming admixture of prunes; and as for \"Collick\" and \"Stomack-Ach,\" I feel sure every respectable Puritan patient child died rather than swallow the disgusting and nauseous compounds that were offered to him for his relief.  Puritan babies also wore medical ornaments, \"anodyne necklaces.\" I find them advertised in the _Boston Evening Post_ as late as 1771--\"Anodine Necklaces for the Easy breeding of Childrens Teeth,\" worn as nowadays children wear strings of amber beads to avert croup.  Another medicine \"to make children's teeth come without paine\" was this: \"Take the head of a Hare boyled a walm or two or roahed; and with the braine thereof mingle Honey and butter and therewith anoynt the Childes gums as often as you please.\" Still further advice was to scratch the child's gums with an osprey bone, or to hang fawn's teeth or wolf's fangs around his neck--an ugly necklace.  The first scene of gayety upon which the chilled baby opened his sad eyes was when his mother was taken from her great bed and \"laid on a pallat,\" and the heavy curtains and valances of harrateen or serge were hung within and freshened with \"curteyns and vallants of cheney or calico.\" Then, or a day or two later, the midwife, the nurses, and all the neighboring women who had helped with advice or work in the household during the first week or two of the child's life, were bidden to a dinner. This was also a French fashion, as \"_Les Caquets de l'Accouchée_,\" the popular book of the time of Louis XIII., proves.  Doubtless at this New England amphidromia the \"groaning beer\" was drunk, though Sewall \"brewed my Wives Groaning Beer\" two months before the child was born. By tradition, \"groaning cake,\" to be used at the time of the birth of the child, and given to visitors for a week or two later, also was made; but I find no allusion to it under that name in any of the diaries of the times. At this women's dinner good substantial viands were served. \"Women din'd with rost Beef and minc'd Pyes, good Cheese and Tarts.\" When another Sewall baby was scarcely two weeks old, seventeen women were dined at Judge Sewall's on equally solid meats, \"Boil'd Pork, Beef, Fowls, very good Rost Beef, Turkey, Pye and Tarts.\" Madam Downing gave her women \"plenty of sack and claret.\" A survival of this custom existed for many years in the fashion of drinking caudle at the bedside of the mother.  As might be expected of a man who diverted himself in attending the dissection of an Indian, which gruesome gayety exhilarated him into spending a tidy sum--for him--on drinks and feeing \"the maid;\" and in visiting his family tomb; and who, when he took his wife on a pleasure trip to Dorchester \"to eat cherries and rasberries,\" spent his entire day within-doors reading that cheerful book, Calvin on Psalms;--in the house of such a pleasure-seeker but small provision was made for the entertainment or amusement of his children. They were sometimes led solemnly to the house of some old, influential, or pious person, who formally gave them his blessing. He took them also to some of the funerals of the endless procession of dead Bostonians that files sombrely through the pages of his diary, to the funeral of their baby brother, little Stephen Sewall, when \"Sam and his sisters (who were about five and six years old) cryed much coming home and at home, so that I could hardly quiet them. It seems they looked into Tomb, and Sam said he saw a great Coffin there, his Grandfathers.\" These were not the only tears that Sam and Betty and Hannah shed through fear of death. When Betty was a year older her father wrote:       \"It falls to my daughter Elizabeths Share to read the 24 of Isaiah      which she doth with many Tears not being very well, and the      Contents of the Chapter and Sympathy with her draw Tears from me      also.\"  Two days later, Sam, who was then about ten years old, also showed evidence of the dejection of soul around him.       \"Richard Dumer, a flourishing youth of 9 years old dies of the      Small Pocks. I tell Sam of it and what need he had to prepare for      Death, and therefore to endeavor really to pray, when he said over      the Lord's Prayer: He seemed not much to mind, eating an Aple; but      when he came to say Our Father he burst out into a bitter Cry and      said he was afraid he should die. I pray'd with him and read      Scriptures comforting against Death, as O death where is thy sting,      &c. All things yours. Life and Immortality brought to light by      Christ.\"  In January, 1695, Judge Sewall writes:       \"When I came in, past 7 at night, my wife met me in the Entry and      told me Betty had surprised them. I was surprised with the      Abruptness of the Relation. It seems Betty Sewall had given some      signs of dejection and sorrow; but a little while after dinner she      burst out into an amazing cry, which caus'd all the family to cry      too; Her Mother ask'd the reason, she gave none; at last said she      was afraid she should goe to Hell, her Sins were not pardon'd. She      was first wounded by my reading a sermon of Mr. Norton's Text, Ye      shall seek me and shall not find me. And those words in the sermon,      Ye shall seek me and die in your Sins ran in her mind and terrified      her greatly. And staying at home she read out of Mr. Cotton      Mather--Why hath Satan filled thy Heart, which increased her Fear.      Her Mother asked her whether she pray'd. She answered yes but      fear'd her prayers were not heard because her sins were not      pardon'd.\"  A fortnight later he writes:       \"Betty comes into me as soon as I was up and tells me the disquiet      she had when wak'd; told me she was afraid she should go to Hell,      was like Spira, not Elected. Ask'd her what I should pray for, she      said that God would pardon her Sin and give her a new heart. I      answer'd her Fears as well as I could and pray'd with many Tears on      either part. Hope God heard us.\"  Three months later still he makes this entry:       \"Betty can hardly read her chapter for weeping, tells me she is      afraid she is gon back, does not taste that sweetness in reading      the Word which once she did; fears that what was once upon her is      worn off. I said what I could to her and in the evening pray'd with      her alone.\"  Poor little \"wounded\" Betty! She did not die in childhood as she feared, but lived to pass through many gloomy hours of morbid introspection and of overwhelming fear of death, to marry and become the mother of eight children; but was always buffeted with fears and tormented with doubts, which she despairingly communicated to her solemn and far from comforting father; and at last she faced the dread foe Death at the age of thirty-five. Judge Sewall wrote sadly the day of her funeral: \"I hope God has delivered her now from all her fears;\" every one reading of her bewildered and depressed spiritual life must sincerely hope so with him. In truth, the Puritan children were, as Judge Sewall said, \"stirred up dreadfully to seek God.\"  Here is the way that one of Sewall's neighbors taught his little daughter when she was four years old:       \"I took my little daughter Katy into my Study and there I told my      child That I am to Dy Shortly and Shee must, when I am Dead,      Remember every Thing, that I now said unto her. I sett before her      the sinful condition of her Nature and I charged her to pray in      secret places every day. That God for the sake of Jesus Christ      would give her a New Heart. I gave her to understand that when I am      taken from her she must look to meet with more Humbling      Afflictions than she does now she has a Tender Father to provide      for her.\"  I hardly understand why Cotton Mather, who was really very gentle to his children, should have taken upon himself to trouble this tender little blossom with dread of his death. He lived thirty years longer, and, indeed, survived sinful little Katy. Another child of his died when two years and seven months old, and made a most edifying end in prayer and praise. His pious and incessant teachings did not, however, prove wholly satisfactory in their results, especially as shown in the career of his son Increase, or \"Cressy.\"  No age appeared to be too young for these remarkable exhibitions of religious feeling. Phebe Bartlett was barely four years old when she passed through her amazing ordeal of conversion, a painful example of religious precocity. The \"pious and ingenious"]]]
