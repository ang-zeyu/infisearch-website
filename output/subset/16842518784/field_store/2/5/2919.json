And hence he decided 'twas better to wait, Since his appetite grew when he supped rather late. Pretty soon he was hungry, and stalked to the bank. Where some pondfish were leaping--a fish of low rank. \"Bah, Bah!\" said the Bird. \"Sup on these? No--not I. I'm known as a Heron: as such I live high.\" Then some gudgeon swam past that were tempting to see, But the Heron said hautily: \"No--not for me. For those I'd not bother to open my beak, If I had to hang 'round come next Friday a week.\" Thus bragged the big Bird. But he's bound to confess That he opened his elegant beak for much less. Not another fish came. When he found all else fail, He was happy to happen upon a fat snail.    The Raven Who Would Rival The Eagle.  An Eagle swooped from out the sky, And carried off a sheep. A Raven seeing him, said: \"I Could do that too if I should try. His meal comes mighty cheap.\"  Of all that well-fed flock was one As fat as fat could be. The Raven rose, and lit upon Her back. She seemed to weigh a ton-- So very fat was she.  And, oh! Her wool was wondrous thick: It would have made a mat. The Raven's claws are caught, and stick! He's played himself a pretty trick-- To fly with one so fat.  \"Ba, ba!\" \"Caw, caw!\" cry bird and beast. The shepherd comes at last: Sir Raven who would find a feast Is from the woolly one released, And in a cage kept fast.    The Miller, His Son And The Ass.  A Miller and Son once set out for the fair, To sell a fine ass they had brought up with care; And the way that they started made everyone stare.  To keep the Ass fresh, so the beast would sell dear On a pole they slung him. It surely seemed queer: He looked, with heels up, like some huge chandelier.  One person who passed them cried out in great glee. \"Was there anything ever so silly?\" said he. \"Can you guess who the greatest Ass is of those three?\"  The Miller at once put the brute on the ground; And the Ass, who had liked to ride t'other way round, Complained in language of curious sound.  No matter. The Miller now made his Son ride, While he followed after or walked alongside. Then up came three merchants. The eldest one cried;  \"Get down there, young fellow! I never did see Such manners:--a gray-beard walks where you should be. He should ride, you should follow. Just take that from me!\"  \"Dear Sirs,\" quoth the Miller, \"I'd see you content.\" He climbed to the saddle; on foot the boy went... Three girls passed. Said one: \"Do you see that old Gent? There he sits, like a bishop. I say it's a shame, While that boy trudging after seems more than half lame.\" \"Little girl,\" said the Miller, \"go back whence you came.\"  Yet this young creature so worked on his mind That he wanted no woman to call him unkind: And he said to his Son: \"Seat yourself here--behind.\"  With the Ass bearing double they jogged on again, And once more met a critic, who said: \"It is plain Only dunces would give their poor donkey such pain. He will die with their weight: it's a shame and a sin. For their faithful servant they care not a pin. They'll have nothing to sell at the fair but his skin.\"  \"Dear me!\" said the Miller, \"what am I to do? Must I suit the whole world and the world's father, too? Yet it must end some time--so I'll see the thing through.\"  Both Father and Son now decided to walk, While the Ass marched in front with a strut and a stalk; Yet the people who passed them continued to talk.  Said one to another: \"Look there, if you please, How they wear out their shoes, while their Ass takes his ease. Were there ever, d'ye think, three such asses as these?\" Said the Miller: \"You're right. I'm an Ass! It is true. Too long have I listened to people like you. But now I am done with the whole kit and crew.  \"Let them blame me or praise me, keep silent or yell, My goings and comings they cannot compel. I will do as I please!\"...So he did--and did well."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24119"],["title","Make Mine Homogenized (#1)"],["body","the kitchen window in a blizzard of flying glass and buried itself, edgewise, in the wall over the stove. Hetty slammed backwards headfirst into a heap of shattered eggs. A torrent of broken plaster, and crockery fragments rained on her stunned figure. Through dazed eyes, she saw a column of purple-reddish fire rising from the yard.  A woman who has been thrown twenty-three times from a pitching bronco and kicked five times in the process, doesn't stay dazed long. Pawing dripping egg yokes and plaster from her face, Hetty Thompson struggled to her feet and staggered to the kitchen door.  \"Barneeey,\" she bawled, \"you all right?\"  The column of weird-colored flame had quickly died and only a few flickering pieces of wood from the cauldron fire burned in scattered spots about the yard. Of the cauldron, there wasn't a sign.  \"Barney,\" she cried anxiously, \"where are you?\"  \"Here I am, Miz Thompson.\" Barney's blackened face peered around the corner of the tractor shed. \"You O.K., Miz Thompson?\"  \"What in thunderation happened?\" Hetty called out. \"You try to build a fire with dynamite for kindling?\"  Shaken but otherwise unharmed, Barney painfully limped over to the ranch house porch.  \"Don't ask me what happened, m'am,\" he said. \"I just poured that milk into the slop pot and then put the lid back on and walked off. I heered this big '_whoosh_' and turned around in time to see the lid fly off and the kettle begin to tip into the fire and then there was one helluva blast. It knocked me clean under the tractor shed.\" He fumbled in his pocket for a cigarette and shakily lighted it.  Hetty peered out over the yard and then looking up, gasped. Perched like a rakish derby hat on the arm of the towering pump windmill was the slop cauldron. \"Well I'll be....\" Hetty Thompson said.  \"You sure you didn't pour gas on that fire to make it burn faster, Barney Hatfield?\" she barked at the handy man.  \"No siree,\" Barney declaimed loudly, \"there weren't no gas anywhere near that fire. Only thing I poured out was that there bad milk.\" He paused and scratched his head. \"Reckon that funny milk coulda done that, Miz Thompson? There ain't no gas made what'll blow up nor burn so funny as that did.\"  Hetty snorted. \"Whoever heard of milk blowing up, you old idiot?\" A look of doubt spread. \"You put all that milk in there?\"  \"No'm, just the one bucket.\" Barney pointed to the other pail beside the kitchen door, now half-empty and standing in a pool of liquid sloshed out by the blast wave. Hetty studied the milk pail for a minute and then resolutely picked it up and walked out into the yard.  \"Only one way to find out,\" she said. \"Get me a tin can, Barney.\"  She poured about two tablespoons of the milk into the bottom of the can while Barney collected a small pile of kindling. Removing the milk pail to a safe distance, Hetty lighted the little pile of kindling, set the tin can atop the burning wood and scooted several yards away to join Barney who had been watching from afar. In less than a minute a booming _whoosh_ sent a miniature column of purple, gaseous flame spouting from the can. \"Well whadda you know about that?\" Hetty exclaimed wonderingly.  The can had flown off the fire a few feet but didn't explode. Hetty went back to the milk pail and collecting less than a teaspoon full in the water dipper, walked to the fire. Standing as far back as she could and still reach over the flames, she carefully sprinkled a few drops of the liquid directly into the fire and then jumped back. Miniature balls of purple flame erupted from the fire before she could move. Pieces of flaming kindling flew in all directions and one slammed Barney across the back of the neck and sent a shower of sparks down his back.  The handy man let out a yowl of pain and leaped for the watering trough beside the corral, smoke trailing behind him. Hetty thoughtfully surveyed the scene of her experiment from beneath raised eyebrows. Then she grunted with satisfaction, picked up the remaining milk in the pail and went back to the ranch house. Barney climbed drippingly from the horse trough.  The kitchen was a mess. Splattered eggs were over everything and broken glass, crockery and plaster covered the floor, table and counters. Only one egg remained unbroken. That was the golden egg. Hetty picked it up and shook it. There was a faint sensation of something moving inside the tough, metallic-looking shell. It shook almost as a normal egg might, but not quite. Hetty set the strange object on a shelf and turned to the task of cleaning up.                       *      *      *      *      *  Johnny Culpepper, the ranch's other full-time hand and Hetty's assistant manager, drove the pickup into the yard just before noon. He parked in the shade of the huge cottonwood tree beside the house and bounced out with an armload of mail and newspapers. Inside the kitchen door, he dumped the mail on the sideboard and started to toss his hat on a wall hook when he noticed the condition of the room. Hetty was dishing out fragrant, warmed-over stew into three lunch dishes on the table. She had cleaned up the worst of the mess and changed into a fresh shirt and jeans. Her iron-gray hair was pulled back in a still-damp knot at the back after a hasty scrubbing to get out the gooey mixture of eggs and plaster.  \"Holy smoke, Hetty,\" Johnny said. \"What happened here? Your pressure kettle blow up?\" His eyes widened when he saw the lid of the slop cauldron still embedded in the wall over the stove. His gaze tracked back and took in the shattered window.  \"Had an accident,\" Hetty said matter-of-factly, putting the last dishes on the table. \"Tell you about it when we eat. Now you go wash up and call Barney. I want you to put some new glass in that window this afternoon and get that danged lid outta the wall.\"  Curious and puzzled, Johnny washed at the kitchen sink and then walked to the door to shout for Barney. On the other side of the yard, Barney released the pump windmill clutch. While Johnny watched from the porch, the weight of the heavy slop cauldron slowly turned the big windmill and as the arm adorned by the kettle rotated downward, the cast-iron pot slipped off and fell to the hard-packed ground with a booming clang.  \"Well, for the luvva Pete,\" Johnny said in amazement. \"Hey, Barney, time to eat. C'mon in.\"  Barney trudged across the yard and limped into the kitchen to wash. They sat down to the table. \"Now just what have you two been up to,\" Johnny demanded as they attacked the food-laden dishes.  Between mouthfuls, the two older people gave him a rundown on the morning's mishaps. The more Johnny heard, the wilder it sounded. Johnny had been a part of the Circle T since he was ten years old. That was the year Hetty jerked him out of the hands of a Carson City policeman who had been in the process of hauling the ragged and dirty youngster to the station house for swiping a box of cookies from a grocery store. Johnny's mother was dead and his father, once the town's best mechanic, had turned into the town's best drunk.  During the times his father slept one off, either in the shack the man and boy occupied at the edge of town, or in the local lockup, Johnny ran wild.  Hetty took the boy to the ranch for two reasons. Mainly it was the empty ache in her heart since the death of Big Jim Thompson a year earlier following a ranch tractor accident that had crushed his chest. The other was her well-hidden disappointment that she had been childless. Hetty's bluff, weathered features would never admit to loneliness or heartache. Beneath the surface, all the warmth and love she had went out to the scared but belligerent youngster. But she never let much affection show through until Johnny had become part of her life. Johnny's father died the following winter after pneumonia brought on by a night of lying drunk in the cold shack during a blizzard. It was accepted without legal formality around the county that Johnny automatically became Hetty's boy.  She cuffed and comforted him into a gawky-happy adolescence, pushed him through high school and then, at eighteen, sent him off to the University of California at Davis to learn what the pundits of the United States Department of Agriculture had to say about animal husbandry and ranch management.                       *      *      *      *      *  When Hetty and Barney had finished their recitation, Johnny wore a look of frank disbelief. \"If I didn't know you two better, I'd say you both been belting the bourbon bottle while I was gone. But this I've got to see.\"  They finished lunch and, after Hetty stacked the dishes in the sink, trooped out to the porch where Johnny went through the same examination of the milk. Again, a little fire was built in the open safety of the yard and a few drops of the liquid used to produce the same technicolored, combustive effects.  \"Well, what do you know,\" Johnny exclaimed, \"a four hundred octane Guernsey cow!\"  Johnny kicked out the fire and carried the milk pail to the tractor shed. He parked the milk on a workbench and gathered up an armful of tools to repair the blast-torn kitchen. He started to leave but when the milk bucket caught his eye, he unloaded the tools and fished around under the workbench for an empty five-gallon gasoline can. He poured the remaining milk into the closed gasoline can and replaced the cap. Then he took his tools and a pane of glass from an overhead rack and headed for the house.  Hetty came into the kitchen as he was prying at the cauldron lid in the wall.  \"You're going to make a worse mess before you're through,\" she said, \"so I'll just let you finish and then clean up the whole mess afterwards. I got other things to do anyway.\"  She jammed a man's old felt hat on her head and left the house. Barney was unloading the last of the supplies Johnny had brought from Carson in the truck. Hetty shielded her eyes against the metallic glare of the afternoon sun. \"Gettin' pretty dry, Barney. Throw "]]]
