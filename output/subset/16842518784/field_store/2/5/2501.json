Now the sides were growing slippery from the rain, so the ascent became more difficult than ever.  \"We're in a pickle,\" sighed Sam.  \"Oh, we've got to get out somehow,\" answered his big brother. \"We can't stay here forever.\"  The opening was almost square, with three sides of rough rock. In trying to climb up some of the rocks Tom gave one a shove and it slid from sight, revealing an opening beyond.  \"Hullo! another hole!\" cried the youth, leaping back in consternation. \"Why, the old mountain is fairly honeycombed with them.\"  \"I was never on this side of the mountain before,\" said Dick. \"They used to tell some queer stories about this side.\"  \"Didn't they say some parts were haunted?\" asked Sam.  \"Yes, and it was said that, years ago, many travelers coming this way disappeared.\"  \"Well, why shouldn't they, with so many holes around?\" came from Tom. \"If we get out alive we'll be lucky.\"  With great care they got down on their hands and knees and examined the opening beyond the rocks.  \"I believe it's a big cave,\" announced Dick a few minutes later. \"And if it is, I'm rather inclined to look around inside. Perhaps it will lead to some opening on the mountainside where we can get out.\"     CHAPTER III  A MYSTERIOUS CAVE   At first Sam and Tom demurred to entering the cave--which looked dark and forbidding. But Dick insisted that he was going ahead, and rather than be left behind they went along.  \"We'll light some kind of a torch,\" said the eldest Rover. \"Got some matches?\"  \"Yes, I brought along a pocketful,\" answered Sam. \"Didn't know but what we'd want to build a campfire this noon.\"  \"We'll want one now--to dry our clothing by,\" said Tom. \"Let us pick up the driest of the sticks.\"  This they did, and having entered the cave, they made a good-sized blaze. This sent a ruddy glow around the cavern, and as the boys moved about fantastic shadows went dancing on the rocky walls, adding to the weirdness of the scene.  From the fire each of the youths provided himself with a torch, and thus equipped they moved around the cave with care, taking precautions not to fall into any more holes. They soon found the opening on the mountainside long and narrow and running downward.  \"We don't want to get lost,\" cautioned Sam.  \"Oh, we can always go back to the fire,\" answered Dick.  \"Unless it goes out on us.\"  \"It won't burn itself out for an hour--I saw to that before we left it.\"  As the boys advanced into the cave they came across a heap of bones. Dick examined them carefully.  \"Skeletons?\" queried Sam, and his voice trembled slightly.  \"Yes--of lambs and pigs,\" was the dry answer. \"Somebody has been making this a rendezvous and living on the fat of the land.\"  \"Maybe that accounts for Jerry Burden's losses,\" suggested Tom. \"He said he lost a lamb last spring, and two pigs.\"  \"Yes, and old Richard Feltham lost a pig and some chickens,\" added Dick. \"Maybe this has been a hangout for tramps.\"  \"Do you think they are here still?\" questioned Sam. \"We don't want to have any trouble.\"  \"I am sure I don't know, Sam. But this proves one thing.\"  \"That we can get out of the cave?\"  \"Exactly. See, here is an old coat and a pair of old shoes. Somebody has been in the habit of coming here--and he wasn't in the habit of getting in the way we got in.\"  They moved on, and soon reached a larger opening. Here they found a bit of old harness and, further on, where the ground was soft, the tracks of wagon wheels.  \"Somebody has been in the habit of driving right in here!\" exclaimed Tom. \"We are sure to get out!\" and his face showed his relief.  \"Hark! what's that?\" cried Sam, and shrank back as a strange rumbling was heard. \"Is it an earthquake, or a landslide?\"  \"It's thunder, that's all,\" said Dick, a minute later, as they listened.  \"To be sure--the storm was on us when we fell into the first hole,\" answered the youngest Rover.  \"Perhaps we can be glad we are under shelter--if the storm is going to be a bad one,\" came from Tom. \"But, come on, I want to see daylight again.\"  He moved on and then gave a cry of astonishment.  \"Look!\"  His brothers did so. On one side of the cave were piled thirty or forty packing cases. The majority of them were empty, but three, directed to one Jackson Dwight, Carwell, were full and nailed up.  \"Well, I never!\" murmured Sam. \"Dick----\"  \"The freight thieves!\" ejaculated the eldest Rover. \"Don't you remember what was in the paper before we went south, and what was in again only yesterday? They have been missing freight from Carwell and Boxton and half a dozen other stations for over a year. The thieves must have brought their stuff here and then taken some of it from the packing cases and carted it away again.\"  \"It certainly looks like it,\" answered Tom. \"Only three full cases left. I wonder when these were taken?\"  \"Most likely only a short time ago,\" said Dick. \"The cases look new.\"  \"Do you suppose any of the freight thieves are around? If they are we want to keep out of their way--if they are desperate characters.\"  They moved on, and then Dick called a sudden halt.  \"I can see daylight ahead,\" he said. \"And somebody is moving around. Let us put out the torches.\"  His suggestion was speedily followed, and the three Rover boys advanced with caution. At its outer end the cave became broader while the roof was only about ten feet high.  \"Hullo, here's another surprise,\" whispered Dick, as they came closer to the opening. \"Look at that!\"  He pointed to one side of the cave and there the others saw an automobile runabout standing and on the seat two men dressed for a tour. They were talking to a third man, who was lounging against a front wheel, smoking a brier-root pipe.  \"Maybe they are the freight thieves,\" whispered Tom. \"Let us get out of sight and listen to what they have to say.\"  It was an easy matter to keep out of sight, for the walls of the cave were very uneven at this point. They got behind a projection, and by crawling up a rocky ledge managed to reach a point above and to one side of the runabout and not over a dozen feet from it.  \"Then you weren't going to stop here, Merrick?\" asked the man leaning against the wheel.  \"Not now, Dangler,\" was the reply of the man with the pipe. \"The storm drove us in here.\"  \"When do you expect to meet this Randolph Rover?\"  \"Very soon.\"  \"He ought to be easy--he is so simple minded.\"  \"Oh, I think we can work him right enough,\" put in the third man, who was tall and thin-cheeked.  \"Well, if you do, don't forget that I get my share, Pike,\" said the man called Dangler.  \"Haven't you always gotten your share?\" demanded Pike.  \"I suppose I have.\"  \"And haven't we given you the information whenever any valuable freight was coming this way?\" put in the man called Merrick.  \"Yes, and got your full share of the proceeds, while I ran the risk,\" growled Dangler. \"It's getting dangerous--I'm going to quit--after the next big haul,\" went on the man with the pipe.  \"All right--as you wish,\" answered Merrick. \"I wish this storm would let up. The road will be something fierce for our runabout.\"  \"And bad for my wagon,\" growled Dangler in return.  The boys listened to the conversation with deep interest. The reference to their uncle amazed them, and they wondered what the two men in the runabout had in mind to do. By their talk it was evident they meant to accomplish something unlawful.  \"They are going to play Uncle Randolph some trick,\" whispered Sam. \"We must get home and warn him.\"  \"What we ought to do is to have the whole crowd arrested,\" answered Tom. \"They are all implicated in the theft of freight.\"  \"That's the talk,\" said Dick. \"The question is, How can we do it? We are no match for those three men, and more than likely they are armed.\"  After this the three men conversed in such a low tone the boys could not hear a quarter of what was said. But they learned enough to know that Merrick and Pike were going to meet their uncle and play him false in some way, and they heard the words \"traction bonds\" and \"coupons\" several times.  \"Uncle Randolph had ten thousand dollars' worth of traction company bonds,\" said Dick. \"He bought them only a short while ago. They pay five and a half per cent. interest and he thought them a first-class investment.\"  \"Oh, we'll have to warn him,\" said Sam. \"He is so open-hearted he would trust most anybody.\"  Merrick had descended from the runabout and gone out of the cave. Now he came back, said something to the others, and started up the auto. In another moment he had the machine turned around. Then it spun out of the cave and down a fairly good road in the direction of Carwell. The man named Dangler followed the runabout to the road and watched it disappear around a turn bordered by trees. The storm was now rolling away to the westward and the rain had ceased.  \"They have gone!\" cried Tom. \"Where to?\"  \"Perhaps to our farm--to see Uncle Randolph,\" answered Sam. \"We ought to follow them as quickly as we can.\"  \"I think we had better capture the fellow left behind,\" said Dick. \"We ought to be able to do it.\"  \"That's the talk,\" said Tom. \"Sure we can do it, being three to one.\"  Dangler watched the runabout and then gazed up and down the mountain for several minutes. Then of a sudden he started in a direction opposite to that taken by the machine.  \"He is going away!\" cried Sam.  \"Come on after him!\" called his big brother, and ran from the cave with the others at his heels. Just as he did this Dangler glanced back and saw them.  \"Hey, you!\" he cried in consternation.  \"Stop!\" called out Dick. \"We want you.\"  At this command Dangler was more amazed than ever. But of a sudden he appeared to realize something of what had happened and commenced to run.  \"Stop!\" cried Tom and Sam, but at this the man only ran the faster.  \"Come on--we've got to catch that rascal!\" exclaimed Dick, and started to sprint. The others followed as quickly as they could, "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22164"],["title","A Modern Tomboy: A Story for Girls (#1)"],["body","not just kept our heads above water? My dear Lucy, you little know what might have happened but for your mother's pluck and bravery.\"  \"I know,\" said Lucy, softened on the spot. \"But if she only wouldn't--wouldn't make so free with them when they come, and if there might be a little order, and if they could have been postponed till the resident governesses had arrived. But now they are there, all of them, as merry and jocular as you like, running about the place, racing here and there, and devouring all our best fruit, tramping in and out of the greenhouses and conservatory, and making such a noise just over your study. It would be much better to give up Sunnyside--anything would be better than this.\"  \"I don't think so, and you will find after a time that you will like your school friends. Your education will be finished without any extra cost whatever. We are being very well paid for these girls, we know they are all ladies, and your mother will be happy and in her element. How could you turn your dear mother into a precise, stately woman? It isn't in her, and you would not wish it to be.\"  \"I don't know,\" said Lucy. \"I think I would. But, father, you always make me ashamed of myself. You, who suffer so much, are so good, so patient.\"  \"If I am good and patient it is because of my dear wife and my dear daughter,\" said the man sadly. \"And now, Lucy darling, go back to them all and try to help your mother. The governesses will come to-morrow, and the day after lessons will begin. In a week's time you will see perfect order arising out of chaos, and you will be surprised at your present feelings.\"  Lucy raised her father's hand to her lips. She loved her mother, but she adored him, with his slight stoop, his scholarly face, his gentle smile, his kindly eyes. There were few men more beloved than Professor Merriman. He had given some really great books to the world, and was a scholar in the truest and best sense of the word. When he instructed Lucy, which he did now and then, she regarded those moments as the happiest and most sacred of her life.  \"Well, whatever happens, I have got him,\" she thought as she turned to go back to the house. \"And if it adds any years to his precious life, surely I can endure anything. But I do hope he won't get to like any of those girls. Perhaps he will. Perhaps he will even offer to teach some of them. I sincerely trust none of them are clever. Oh, who is this queer little creature coming to meet me?\"  The queer little creature in question, dressed in brown holland, with a small brown hat and cotton gloves, was no other than Phyllis Flower. She ran up to Lucy, and stood in front of her, and said, \"Is your father really the great Professor Ralph Merriman?\"  \"Yes,\" said Lucy, coloring and smiling, for it was delightful to her to hear the appreciative tone in Phyllis's voice.  \"I thought so, but I was not quite sure. Agnes Sparkes and I were arguing about it. Agnes said it couldn't be, but I said it was. I am very glad. I hope we shall see him sometimes.\"  \"He is not well,\" said Lucy. \"He can't be disturbed.\"  \"We would none of us dream of disturbing him; but we would love to look at him sometimes, and perhaps sometimes to hear him speak.\"  \"I dare say you will see him. When he is well enough he will dine with us,\" said Lucy. \"But you must not expect\"----  \"Oh, we expect nothing--nothing certainly from you,\" said Phyllis Flower, flushing angrily, for there was a tone in Lucy's voice which she could scarcely stand. Then she, continued, \"Why are you determined not to be nice to us, Miss Merriman?\"  \"You had better call me Lucy,\" said the girl after a pause. \"We are all girls together. You are at school and I am at school.\"  \"How old are you, Lucy?\"  \"I am fifteen.\"  \"And I am thirteen and a half. How old do you think I look?\"  \"Oh, any age. You are so thin.\"  \"And wizened,\" laughed Phyllis. \"Well, never mind. I dare say I shall grow tall enough by-and-by. Now, my dear,\" she continued after a pause, \"you have nothing whatever to be jealous of in me. I am not clever, I am not good-looking; in short, I am nothing at all, just the most ordinary person. But I can tell you something about the characters of your other school-fellows if you like. Would you care? There is plenty of time. Shall we walk up and down for a little?\"  Lucy could not resist the temptation. Phyllis, who was quite as frank and free as Mrs. Merriman herself, laid her hand on Lucy's arm. Lucy shuddered, but submitted.  \"The person who has got the greatest character among us is Rosamund Cunliffe. She will rule us all.\"  \"She won't rule me,\" interrupted Lucy angrily.  \"You can't help it, my dear. She has always ruled every one with whom she comes in contact; and she does it quite nicely, too, for she isn't unamiable. She simply has a strong character.\"  \"I hardly know what she is like,\" said Lucy.  \"Oh, you must have observed her--that tall, dark, pretty-looking girl, with rosy cheeks and a pretty mouth.\"  \"Yes, I think I know whom you mean.\"  \"And she is clever, too. But I don't think it is her beauty or her talent that makes her curious charm. It is something beyond all this. I never saw her do a really unamiable thing, and yet I think she must love power very much. You will soon find out for yourself what she is like. As for Janey Denton, she is just a good sort, something like me. And Laura Everett is very proud of her family, and she is clever. And Annie Millar is Laura's shadow, and does nothing whatever except what Laura wishes. Then there is Agnes Sparkes. She is supposed to be my friend, and she is very pretty, fair, and lively and clever. But of all the girls who have come here to-day the two who will make their mark in the world are beyond doubt Rosamund Cunliffe and Laura Everett. Now, I think I will let you find out the rest for yourself.\"     CHAPTER II.  ROSAMUND TAKES THE LEAD.   Before that day had come to an end, Lucy had discovered how true were Phyllis Flower's words. For Rosamund Cunliffe, without making herself in the least disagreeable, without saying one single rude thing, yet managed to take the lead, and that so effectively that even Lucy herself found that she could not help following in her train.  For instance, after dinner, when the girls--all of them rather tired, and perhaps some of them a little cross, and no one exactly knowing what to do--clustered about the open drawing-room windows, it was Rosamund who proposed that the rugs should be rolled back and that they should have a dance.  Lucy opened her eyes. Nobody before had ever dared to make such a suggestion in the house of Sunnyside. Lucy, it is true, had dancing lessons from a master who came once a week to instruct her and other girls in the winter season, and she had occasionally gone to a children's party. But beyond that she had never danced, looking forward to it, however, as a possible recreation by-and-by.  Rosamund's clear voice was now heard.  \"Let us push back the sofas. This is a splendid room. We can roll up the rugs in a twinkling. Where is Mrs. Merriman? She will play the dance music. Oh, there are seven of us--one too many. Perhaps you will play for us, Lucy?\"  \"But I don't know any dance music,\" said Lucy; \"and then mother would not like the rugs being disturbed. The room is arranged just as father and mother wish it to be. I think perhaps\"----  She colored painfully.  \"We will do nothing without leave, of course,\" said Phyllis Flower. \"I'll just run and find Mrs. Merriman and ask her.\"  Before Lucy could prevent her, Phyllis had darted out of the room, returning in a minute or two with the required permission.  \"It's all right, girls,\" she said; \"we can trip it on the light fantastic toe as long as ever we please, and the rugs may go to Hong-kong for all Mrs. Merriman cares.\"  Lucy colored with rage. Rosamund gave a quiet smile--a smile which seemed to denote power. Phyllis's dancing eyes lit for a moment on Lucy's face. Those eyes said in the most provoking manner, \"I told you so.\" And then some one went to the piano, and a minute or two later all the girls, Lucy included, were dancing round and round the room in the merry waltz.  Even Lucy enjoyed it when once it had begun, and the little performer at the piano played well, and kept excellent time. And by-and-by Lucy forgot herself, and could not help laughing when Rosamund seized her round the waist and whirled her round and round, and taught her to reverse, and instructed her in one or two other matters unknown to Lucy up to the present.  The dance lasted for over an hour; and just in the midst of it, when Lucy was really laughing in quite a heart-whole manner, she raised her eyes and saw no less a person than Mr. Merriman himself standing in the doorway. He was smiling, and his eyes were fixed on Rosamund's face.  The moment Rosamund saw him she stopped at once, and said to Lucy, \"Is that your father, the great professor?\"  \"Yes,\" said Lucy.  \"Please introduce him to me.\"  Lucy longed to say, \"It will tire him; I can't do it.\" She longed to give any sort of excuse, but none would come to her lips. She was forced to take Rosamund up to Mr. Merriman.  \"This is Rosamund Cunliffe,\" she said, \"and she wants to know you, father.\"  \"I am very much pleased to see you, Miss Cunliffe,\" said Mr. Merriman; and then Rosamund stood in the doorway and talked.  Lucy went back and tried to dance with another girl, and the dance music still went on. But she could not help straining her ears and trying to catch the subject of Rosamund's conversation. Why, she was absolutely laughing, and the Professor, who was generally so grave and quiet, was laughing also. What did it all mean?  \"Father, aren't you tired?--Miss Cunliffe, you are tiring father,\" said Lucy at last, running up to the door and trying to speak calmly.  \"No, my dear,\" said her father. \"On the contrary, I am intensely interested.--You must tell me that story again, Miss Cunliffe. Would you like to come and see my"]]]
