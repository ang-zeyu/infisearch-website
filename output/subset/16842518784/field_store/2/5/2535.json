KIDD TURNS PIRATE. -- DOWNFALL OF THE      BUCCANEERS' POWER.   In May, 1636, a stanch little sloop of some twenty tons was standing along Long Island Sound on a trading expedition. At her helm stood John Gallop, a sturdy colonist, and a skilful seaman, who earned his bread by trading with the Indians that at that time thronged the shores of the Sound, and eagerly seized any opportunity to traffic with the white men from the colonies of Plymouth or New Amsterdam. The colonists sent out beads, knives, bright clothes, and sometimes, unfortunately, rum and other strong drinks. The Indians in exchange offered skins and peltries of all kinds; and, as their simple natures had not been schooled to nice calculations of values, the traffic was one of great profit to the more shrewd whites. But the trade was not without its perils. Though the Indians were simple, and little likely to drive hard bargains, yet they were savages, and little accustomed to nice distinctions between their own property and that of others. Their desires once aroused for some gaudy bit of cloth or shining glass, they were ready enough to steal it, often making their booty secure by the murder of the luckless trader. It so happened, that, just before John Gallop set out with his sloop on the spring trading cruise, the people of the colony were excitedly discussing the probable fate of one Oldham, who some weeks before had set out on a like errand, in a pinnace, with a crew of two white boys and two Indians, and had never returned. So when, on this May morning, Gallop, being forced to hug the shore by stormy weather, saw a small vessel lying at anchor in a cove, he immediately ran down nearer, to investigate. The crew of the sloop numbered two men and two boys, beside the skipper, Gallop. Some heavy duck-guns on board were no mean ordnance; and the New Englander determined to probe the mystery of Oldham's disappearance, though it might require some fighting. As the sloop bore down upon the anchored pinnace, Gallop found no lack of signs to arouse his suspicion. The rigging of the strange craft was loose, and seemed to have been cut. No lookout was visible, and she seemed to have been deserted; but a nearer view showed, lying on the deck of the pinnace, fourteen stalwart Indians, one of whom, catching sight of the approaching sloop, cut the anchor cable, and called to his companions to awake.  This action on the part of the Indians left Gallop no doubt as to their character. Evidently they had captured the pinnace, and had either murdered Oldham, or even then had him a prisoner in their midst. The daring sailor wasted no time in debate as to the proper course to pursue, but clapping all sail on his craft, soon brought her alongside the pinnace. As the sloop came up, the Indians opened the fight with fire-arms and spears; but Gallop's crew responded with their duck-guns with such vigor that the Indians deserted the decks, and fled below for shelter. Gallop was then in a quandary. The odds against him were too great for him to dare to board, and the pinnace was rapidly drifting ashore. After some deliberation he put up his helm, and beat to windward of the pinnace; then, coming about, came scudding down upon her before the wind. The two vessels met with a tremendous shock. The bow of the sloop struck the pinnace fairly amidships, forcing her over on her beam-ends, until the water poured into the open hatchway. The affrighted Indians, unused to warfare on the water, rushed upon deck. Six leaped into the sea, and were drowned; the rest retreated again into the cabin. Gallop then prepared to repeat his ramming manoeuvre. This time, to make the blow more effective, he lashed his anchor to the bow, so that the sharp flukes protruded; thus extemporizing an iron-clad ram more than two hundred years before naval men thought of using one. Thus provided, the second blow of the sloop was more terrible than the first. The sharp fluke of the anchor crashed through the side of the pinnace, and the two vessels hung tightly together. Gallop then began to double-load his duck-guns, and fire through the sides of the pinnace; but, finding that the enemy was not to be dislodged in this way, he broke his vessel loose, and again made for the windward, preparatory to a third blow. As the sloop drew off, four or five more Indians rushed from the cabin of the pinnace, and leaped overboard but shared the fate of their predecessors, being far from land. Gallop then came about, and for the third time bore down upon his adversary. As he drew near, an Indian appeared on the deck of the pinnace, and with humble gestures offered to submit. Gallop ran alongside, and taking the man on board, bound him hand and foot, and placed him in the hold. A second redskin then begged for quarter; but Gallop, fearing to allow the two wily savages to be together, cast the second into the sea, where he was drowned. Gallop then boarded the pinnace. Two Indians were left, who retreated into a small compartment of the hold, and were left unmolested. In the cabin was found the mangled body of Mr. Oldham. A tomahawk had been sunk deep into his skull, and his body was covered with wounds. The floor of the cabin was littered with portions of the cargo, which the murderous savages had plundered. Taking all that remained of value upon his own craft, Gallop cut loose the pinnace; and she drifted away, to go to pieces on a reef in Narragansett Bay.  This combat is the earliest action upon American waters of which we have any trustworthy records. The only naval event antedating this was the expedition from Virginia, under Capt. Samuel Argal, against the little French settlement of San Sauveur. Indeed, had it not been for the pirates and the neighboring French settlements, there would be little in the early history of the American Colonies to attract the lover of naval history. But about 1645 the buccaneers began to commit depredations on the high seas, and it became necessary for the Colonies to take steps for the protection of their commerce. In this year an eighteen-gun ship from Cambridge, Mass., fell in with a Barbary pirate of twenty guns, and was hard put to it to escape. And, as the seventeenth century drew near its close, these pests of the sea so increased, that evil was sure to befall the peaceful merchantman that put to sea without due preparation for a fight or two with the sea robbers.  It was in the low-lying islands of the Gulf of Mexico, that these predatory gentry--buccaneers, marooners, or pirates--made their headquarters, and lay in wait for the richly freighted merchantmen in the West India trade. Men of all nationalities sailed under the \"Jolly Roger,\"--as the dread black flag with skull and cross-bones was called,--but chiefly were they French and Spaniards. The continual wars that in that turbulent time racked Europe gave to the marauders of the sea a specious excuse for their occupation. Thus, many a Spanish schooner, manned by a swarthy crew bent on plunder, commenced her career on the Spanish Main, with the intention of taking only ships belonging to France and England; but let a richly laden Spanish galleon appear, after a long season of ill-fortune, and all scruples were thrown aside, the \"Jolly Roger\" sent merrily to the fore, and another pirate was added to the list of those that made the highways of the sea as dangerous to travel as the footpad infested common of Hounslow Heath. English ships went out to hunt down the treacherous Spaniards, and stayed to rob and pillage indiscriminately; and not a few of the names now honored as those of eminent English discoverers, were once dreaded as being borne by merciless pirates.  But the most powerful of the buccaneers on the Spanish Main were French, and between them and"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22307"],["title","The Grammar School Boys of Gridley; or, Dick & Co. Start Things Moving (#1)"],["body","in bad weather, but the basements were always crowded at such times, and many of the young people preferred to pass the recess time in the schoolroom.  \"Old Dut's getting rather too fresh these days,\" growled Greg Holmes to his chum. Then whispered in Dick's ear:  \"We'll get hunk with him to-night. Some of us will go around and play the wreck scene in his flower gardens.\"  \"Nothing doing,\" retorted Dick briefly.  \"I know a good one,\" whispered Dave Darrin, his dark eyes flashing with anticipated mischief. \"We'll switch Old Dut's new gate off and play Moses in the bulrushes at the river bank.\"  \"Say,\" demanded Dick, gazing curiously at his tempters, \"since when have you thought I don't know enough to pay back my own grudges!\"  \"Have you got a scheme?\" demanded Tom Reade eagerly, while Harry Hazelton and Dan Dalzell, sure that Dick had a \"corker\" of a scheme, grinned as happily as though they had already seen it put through with a rush.  \"Have you got a scheme?\" insisted Dave.  \"Maybe,\" replied Dick evasively.  \"Any of you fellows going down to the basement?\" asked Hazelton after a moment.  \"What's the use?\" questioned Dick. \"Tramp down three flights of stairs, and then climb the flights again in ten minutes.\"  With that Dick sauntered into the schoolroom. Old Dut was seated at his desk, a half dozen of the girls standing about, eating apples or candy, and talking with the principal.  \"Only girls over there by Prin's desk,\" thought Dick with some dissatisfaction. He wandered about for a few minutes, but at last went up to Old Dut's desk as though being reluctantly drawn there by some magnet.  \"Get next,\" nudged Dave Darrin, poking Hazelton in the side. As Dave sauntered over to the desk Harry followed. Tom Reade seemed interested in the scene. Greg Holmes and Dan Dalzell strolled over, arm in arm.  Seeing such an invasion of boys, the girls gave back for a few feet, though they did not quit the scene.  \"Funny the Detroits didn't win the championship this year, isn't it?\" Dick asked innocently.  \"The Detroits haven't any show,\" returned Darrin half disgustedly. \"They've got nearly a month to play yet, but the Detroits are no good this year.\"  \"If all the Detroits were in a class with Pendleton, their new pitcher, this year,\" Dick contended, \"the Detroits would show class enough.\"  Old Dut looked up with interest. A thoroughly skilled and capable teacher, he had always believed in encouraging sports and athletics.  \"That Pendleton fellow is more than a wonder with a ball,\" Dick went on warmly. \"I saw him pitch a game against the New Yorks this summer, and I dreamed about it for a week after.\"  \"What's Pendleton's strong point?\" followed up Dave Darrin.  \"Everything in the pitching line,\" Dick answered.  \"But what is his best point of all, Prescott?\" broke in Old Dut.  Even that experienced school principal had tumbled into the trap that Dick Prescott had so ingeniously laid for him.  \"Well, sir,\" replied Dick, wheeling around to the principal, every trace of resentment gone from his young face, \"I should say that Pendleton's most noticeable trick is the way he twists and handles the ball when he's getting ready to drive in his curve. I watched Pendleton's work that day, and I think I stole the principle on which he uses his right wrist.\"  \"Show me,\" unsuspiciously invited Old Dut.  Dick started to curve an imaginary ball in his right hand, then glanced over the principal's desk. A small, but thick, heavy book lay there.  \"Well, I should say,\" Prescott resumed, \"that Pendleton handles the ball about like this.\"  Picking up the book, Dick used both hands in trying to give it the right preliminary curve.  \"But his delivery is, of course, the great feature,\" the lad went on. \"When Pendleton has the ball curved just right, he raises his right and lets it go like this!\"  Dick was facing the bevy of girls. They were so certain he was going to hurl the book in their direction that they scattered with little cries of alarm.  So forcefully had young Prescott prepared for the throw that the book did leave his hand, though the boy made a frantic effort--apparently--to recover the missile.  Not toward the retreating girls, however, did the book fly. It spun nearly at right angles, and----  Smack! it went, full into the face of Principal E. Dutton Jones.  \"Oh, I beg your pardon, sir!\" cried Dick in a voice ringing with remorse. \"That must hurt you very much, sir.\"  \"It is nothing,\" replied Old Dut gamely, though the unexpected shock had nearly taken his breath. Then he put one hand up to his injured face. \"Why, I believe my nose is bleeding,\" he added, making a quick dive for his handkerchief.  In truth the nose was bleeding. Old Dut made a specialty of low-cut vests and white, immaculate shirt-fronts. Before the handkerchief was in place, three bright, crimson drops had fallen, rendering the shirt-front a gruesome sight to look at.  \"Oh, sir, I hope you will excuse me,\" followed up Dick.  \"Oh, yes; certainly,\" dryly returned the principal, as he rose and made for his private room. There was a handbowl in there, with hot and cold water, and the principal of the Central Grammar School of Gridley was soon busy repairing his personal appearance.  No sooner had he vanished behind the open door than Dave Darrin, Tom Reade, Dan Dalzell, Greg Holmes, Harry Hazelton and several other boys grinned broadly in their huge delight. Dick Prescott, however, admirable actor that he was, still wore a look of concern on his rather fine young face.  \"One thing I've learned to-day, which I ought to have known before,\" grimly mused Old Dut, as he sopped a wet towel to his injured nose. \"Dick Prescott doesn't need any guardian. He can look out for himself!\"  \"Wasn't it awful?\" repeated a girl's voice out in the schoolroom.  \"No,\" replied her companion. \"I don't think it was. After what he did it served him just right!\"  \"I'm getting the usual sympathy that is awarded to the vanquished,\" smiled Old Dut to himself. \"That's Laura Bentley's voice. She didn't laugh when I was having my innings with Dick. She flushed up and looked indignant.\"  Before Old Dut felt that he was in shape to present himself, all of the eight grades had received seven minutes' additional recess.  At last studies were resumed. Old Dut, however, noted that whenever one of the boys or girls looked up and caught sight of his expansive, crimsoned shirt-front, a smile always followed.     CHAPTER II  A BRUSH ON THE STREET   By the time that the noon dismissal bell rang the rain had ceased, and the sun was struggling out.  Out in the coatroom Dick snatched his hat from the nail as though he were in haste to get away.  \"I'll race you home, as far as we go together,\" proposed Dave Darrin.  \"Go you!\" hovered on the tip of Prescott's tongue, but just then another thought popped into Dick's mind. It was a manly idea, and he had learned to act promptly on such impulses.  \"Wait a moment,\" he answered Darrin. \"I've got something to do.\"  With that Dick marched back into the schoolroom. Old Dut, looking up from the books that he was placing in a tidy pile on the platform desk, smiled.  \"I came back to ask, sir, if your nose pains?\"  Old Dut shot a keen glance at young Prescott, for long experience had taught the school-teacher that malice sometimes lurks behind the most innocent question from a boy. Then he answered:  \"I'm glad to be able to report, Master Prescott, that my nose is causing me no trouble whatever.\"  \"I'm very glad of that, sir. I've been a bit uncomfortable, since recess, thinking that perhaps my--that my act had broken your nose, and that you were just too game to let any one know. I'm glad no real harm was done, sir.\"  Then Dick turned, anxious to get out into the open as quickly as possible.  \"One moment, Master Prescott!\"  Dick wheeled about again.  \"Are you sure that the book-throwing was an accident?\"  \"I--I am afraid it wasn't, sir,\" Dick confessed, reddening.  \"Then, if you threw the book into my face on purpose, why did you do it!\"  \"I was a good deal provoked, Mr. Jones.\"  \"Oh! Provoked over the funny story that I told you this forenoon?\"  \"Not over the story, sir; but your manner of telling it.\"  Old Dut had hard work to keep back the smile that struggled for an appearance on his face.  \"Revenge, was it, Master Prescott?\"  \"Well, I felt that it was due me, Mr. Jones, to get even for the show that you made of me before the class.\"  \"Master Prescott, we won't go into the details of whether I was justified in illustrating my story this morning in the manner that I did, or whether you were right in coming back at me after the fashion that you did. But I am going to offer one thought for your consideration. It is this--that the man who devotes too much thought to 'getting even' with other folks is likely to let slip a lot of good, solid chances for getting ahead in the world. I don't blame any fellow for protecting his own rights and dignity, but just think over what I said, won't you, about the chap who spends too much of his time thinking up ways to get even with others?\"  \"There's a good idea in that, sir,\" Dick assented.  \"Of course you've heard, Master Prescott, that 'revenge is sweet?'\"  \"Yes; I have.\"  \"And I believe, Master Prescott, that the saying is often true. But did it ever strike you, in this connection, that sweet things often make one sick at his stomach? I believe this is just as true of revenge as it is of other sweets. And now run along, or you won't have time to do justice to the pudding that your mother has undoubtedly been baking for you this morning.\"  As Dick hastened from the room he found Dave Darrin waiting for him. Out in the corridor beyond these two encountered Holmes, Dalzell, Hazelton and Reade, for these six boys of the \"top grade\" generally stuck together in all things concerning school life.  \"Was Old Dut blowing you up for showing him how to pitch a book?\" inquired Greg.  \"No; Old Dut doesn't seem to hold that in for me very hard,\" "]]]
