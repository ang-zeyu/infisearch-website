The number of the delegates rose in 1898 to two hundred and eighty, in 1899 to three hundred and seventy, and in 1900 to four hundred and twenty. At every succeeding congress the regulations for election were more strictly enforced, the mandates more closely examined, and at the present moment the congress, which has become a permanent institution of the Zionist Jewdom, and which met for the fifth time in December, 1901, again in Basel, can with justice claim to be the real representative of one hundred and eighty thousand electors.  He who desires to know what the Jews who have been represented at the congress have done up to the present time to realize the programme of Zionism drawn up by the first congress, has only to compare the various points of this programme with the facts we are going to record.  \"(1.) The well-regulated promotion of the settlement of Palestine by Jewish agriculturists, artisans, and manufacturers.\"  Zionism rejects on principle all colonization on a small scale, and the idea of \"sneaking\" into Palestine. The Zionists have therefore devoted themselves preëminently to a zealous and tireless advocacy of the uniting of the already existing Jewish colonies in Palestine with those who until now have given them their aid and who of late have inclined towards the withdrawal of their support from them. The Zionists have also prepared the way for founding factories in the Holy Land, which will give employment to the Jewish workmen there, and have assured, by according a yearly subvention, the future existence of the model Hebraic school in Jaffa, which was about to close its doors for want of funds. They take care that the existing and promising beginnings of a Jewish colonization shall be looked after and maintained till the movement will be possible on a large scale.  \"(2.) The organization and knitting together of the whole Jewish community by the means of proper local and general institutions in accordance with the law of the different countries.\"  The Zionist Jewish community is at present organized in both hemispheres in about nine hundred societies, which display great activity. In the matter of organization covering the whole of Jewdom, Zionism possesses national federations of its societies,--the \"great\" and the \"smaller committee of action,\" and the congress which maintains a permanent secretarial office in Vienna. The cost of this apparatus is covered by the voluntary yearly offerings of the Zionists, to which offerings the name of the old Jewish coinage is applied, and which accordingly are known as \"shekels,\"--their amount being in America forty cents, and in Western lands a unit of the coinage (one mark, one franc, one shilling, etc.). The payment of the shekel gives the right of vote for the congress. Zionism possesses its official organ, \"Die Welt,\" published in German in Vienna. Its ideas are further set forth in about forty other periodicals in the Hebrew, German, Russian, Polish, Italian, English, French, and Roumanian languages, and in the Jewish-German and Judeo-Spanish jargons. Its American organ is the periodical, \"The Maccabæan.\" It has founded numerous schools, Toynbee Halls, and educational institutes, and has recently begun to acquire a share in the administration of the Jewish communities, in order to devote their resources, more than has heretofore been the case with the anti-national or unthinking leaders, to the promoting of national Jewish instruction, education, and culture.  \"(3.) Strengthening of the Jewish self-respect and national consciousness.\"  The Zionist societies use every effort that the members and the Jewish masses in general may know the history of their nation, and become acquainted with the sacred and profane literature in the Hebrew tongue. They teach the Jews to hold their heads high, to be proud of their descent, and to despise the Anti-Semitic lies, calumnies, and insults. They care, in the measure of their strength, for the amelioration of the hygiene of the Jewish proletariat, for its economic improvement by means of association and solidarity, for well-directed education of children, and for the instruction of the women. They give the young students a goal for their efforts and an ideal in life. They preach the duty of leading a faultless, spiritual life, the rejection of a crude materialism, into which the assimilation Jews, on account of the want of a worthy ideal, are only too apt to sink, and strict self-control in word and deed. They found athletic societies in order to promote the long neglected physical development of the rising generation. They give a new impulse to the celebration of Jewish historical feasts and memorial days. In many instances they even make themselves outwardly conspicuous by wearing insignia. The Zionist regards it as contemptible to conceal his nationality. He wishes to be recognized as a Jew, and as he always behaves himself in a natural, unaffected way, plays no comedy of imitation, wishes to deceive nobody about his extraction and identity, intrudes upon no one under a false flag, his relations to his Christian neighbors and fellow-countrymen are sounder, truer, more frank and dignified than those of the assimilation Jew, who makes painful and useless efforts, which disgust every Christian possessing a modicum of good taste, to hide the fact that he is a Jew.  \"(4.) Preparatory steps to obtain the consent of the governments necessary to achieve the aims of Zionism.\"  Several of the governments whose opinion will eventually be decisive in the matter have been, by means of memorials, reliably informed of the aims of Zionism; and there has been no want of very important encouragements and promising expressions of sympathy with its tendencies.  For the moment the committee of action is trying to obtain from Turkey a charter for the colonization of such land in Palestine as can be disposed of, and which at present is lying waste, and for the opening of its neglected resources. The exploiting of such a charter is not possible without considerable sums of money. In order to be armed financially for the time that Turkey will accord such a charter, the second Zionist congress (1898) decided to found a national Jewish bank institute, the \"Jewish Colonial Trust,\" with its headquarters in London. This resolution was carried out the following year (1899). The bank has been brought into being. Its capital in shares is two million pounds sterling. It can, by the statutes, start business when one eighth of this capital, two hundred and fifty thousand pounds sterling, has been actually paid up. This has already been done.  Another financial instrument of Zionism is the \"National Fund,\" created by the fifth congress (1901), which is raised by voluntary subscription and which is to amount to two hundred thousand pounds sterling. The half of this sum is to be devoted to the purchase of land in Palestine, the other half to remain an intangible common property of the Jewish people, which will by means of compound interest and gifts continually increase, so that at important junctures the interest may be used for great national purposes.   V.  I have taken pains to show, in as brief and as objective a manner as possible, what Zionism is, what it desires to do, how it came into being, and how it has developed up to the present. I have also repeatedly mentioned that its most violent opponents have arisen from the Jewish community.  Many of them content themselves with libeling and insulting the leaders of the Zionist movement. This kind of hostility they who are vilified can afford to despise. Men who, without expecting the slightest advantage to themselves, out of the purest, most unselfish love for the unhappy ones of their race, out of reverence for their forefathers, out of a general spirit of philanthropy, have made the greatest sacrifices in money, time, strength, and health, in order to elevate their people and to free millions of innocent, persecuted men from the bitterest misery, have the right smilingly to shrug their shoulders when irresponsible fanatics or pitiable paid scribes reproach them with self-interest or with vanity.  Besides these opponents of a lower type, there are others who do not merely lie and slander, but also seek to argue. They delight in comparing the apostles of Zionism with the false Messiahs like the notorious Sabbathai Levi, who have appeared only too often in Jewish history, and who have always done the greatest mischief to the Jewish people they have deceived. To compare Zionism with the vagaries or impostures of false Messiahs of the Sabbathai Levi kind, presupposes great foolishness or great bad faith. Zionism is precisely characterized by the complete absence of any mystical element. It promises its adherents no miracles; on the contrary, it continually impresses on them that their emancipation from a situation they find intolerable can only be the result of their own work, the fruit of their long, strenuous, and combined efforts.  People declare Zionism to be a dream, and deny that its practical realization is possible. To objections of this category the Zionists have a hundred times given a sufficient answer. This simple negative criticism can be passed over. Its only real refutation is in deeds, such as the Zionists have already performed and as they intend further to perform.  The one point which probably forever excludes the possibility of an understanding between Zionist and non-Zionist Jews is the question of the Jewish nationality. Whoever maintains and believes that the Jews are not a nation can indeed be no Zionist; he cannot join a movement which is only justified when it is admitted that it desires to create normal conditions of existence for a people living and suffering under abnormal conditions. He who, on the contrary, is convinced that the Jews are a people must necessarily become Zionist, as only the return to their own country"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24187"],["title","A Transmutation of Muddles (#1)"],["body","to translate should it be necessary. Melin and Voorhis sat at his left, their backs to the hut. To the other side of the table, Eemakh brought two Kappans who were explained to Mayne as being the tribal high priest, Igrillik, and Kaynox, who represented a sort of district overlord.  \"I meant to land up by _their_ city,\" Voorhis put in, \"but we hit some bad winds up in the stratosphere. We got knocked around a bit in the storm, and set down where we could.\"  \"Well, tell me about the details,\" said Mayne. \"I want to get this straight from the start, if I can. By the way, Lieutenant Haruhiku, explain to the chief that a special envoy is on the way, that we want his friendship, and that he will be dealt with fairly.\"  He waited out the exchange of choppy speech between the pilot and Eemakh.  \"He says he is sure he will be fairly dealt with,\" reported Haruhiku.  \"I wonder what he meant by that,\" murmured Mayne. \"If we make a deal here, and thereby with his overlord, will that cover enough territory to be official?\"  \"As much as you can get together anywhere on this world, sir.\"  Mayne nodded, then turned to Captain Voorhis.  \"Now about this so-called crash?\" he prompted.  \"Well, there was this storm, like I said. Trouble was we didn't expect to hit it and ... well ... somebody took it in his head to blow some of the fuel tanks for a crash landing. That's why I'm not claimin' anythin' on the fuel,\" he finished, turning to Melin.  \"We are perfectly willing to pay on that item,\" replied the insurance man.  \"Anyhow,\" continued Voorhis, \"I set down here where we saw the open spot, an' then of course we were stuck with nothin' to lift off with. It looked all right. We'd unload our goods, an' if the local crowd couldn't use them all, why they'd pass the rest on at a profit to themselves. So we come out to palaver, an' then they won't let us go back in the ship. We were just lucky my com man had sent out a landing report when it looked like we piled up, or the Space Force patrol never woulda heard of us.\"  \"Was there any trouble?\" asked Mayne. \"Any unnecessary hostility?\"  Voorhis considered, rubbing the back of his head thoughtfully.  \"Well ... I suppose, lookin' at it their way, they coulda been a lot rougher. A couple of punches got thrown, an' one of my boys got a spear busted over his head, but mostly they acted ... well ... maybe more like cops than cannibals.\"  \"Just enforcing the native laws, eh?\"         *       *       *       *       *  Voorhis did not swallow that quite so graciously. He did not know or care what the local laws might be, but he thought it suspicious in the extreme that he should have plopped down exactly upon the spot chosen by the natives for a temple.  \"So do they have to use my ship to hang it on?\" he finished plaintively.  \"The company is in agreement with you there, captain,\" Melin put in. \"You see, Judge, our point is that nothing is really lost or seriously damaged, neither ship nor cargo. They are merely being withheld from their rightful owner, and we believe that puts the responsibility for recovery upon the Terran government. Captain Voorhis has our entire sympathy--\"  \"Yeah!\" said Voorhis. \"An' if I get my head sliced off tryin' to get at that undamaged cargo, you'll come to my funeral! I say it's a loss!\"  \"Now, gentlemen!\" interrupted Mayne. \"Let me get on with this. Both of you, I'm sure, realize that I'm not a lawyer in spite of being a special judge. If the colonies way out here had enough lawyers to spare, I certainly wouldn't be sticking my head into this. Nevertheless, any decision I make here will be regarded as legally binding by the government of Rigel IX, so let us remain level-headed.\"  \"Very well, Judge,\" said Melin. \"Here are the figures on--\"  \"Please round them off,\" said Mayne. \"If I have to listen to a long list in centicredits, I'll probably go off to see what kind of beer they brew here.\"  \"You wouldn't like it,\" muttered Voorhis, staring sourly at the village.  \"No doubt,\" grinned Mayne.  Melin swallowed and returned to an inner pocket a sheaf of papers he had withdrawn.  \"Speaking very loosely,\" he went on, as if hating to do anything loosely, \"the coverage was about as follows: for the _Gemsbok_ herself, two million; but that was really a nominal figure accorded as a sort of courtesy. Otherwise, at her true worth, the authorities would hardly have permitted Captain Voorhis to take her into space--\"  \"Get on with it,\" urged Mayne, to forestall any wrangle.  \"Er ... yes. Then on the cargo, the purchase cost of two hundred thousand credits.\"  Voorhis visibly flinched and began to acquire a ruddy hue.  \"And, finally, on the fuel load, the cost price of three hundred thousand. Of course, Judge, there are detailed clauses as to normal use of fuel. He was actually insured against defects, premature explosions, accidental loss, et cetera.\"  Mayne did some addition in his head.  \"So your company,\" he said aloud, \"is prepared to pay two and a half million for the loss sustained by Captain Voorhis. What seems to be wrong with that?\"  Both men began to talk but Melin, struggling less with temper, got the lead.  \"Actually,\" he said, \"we feel liable for only three hundred thousand.\"  _Now it will get tough_, thought Mayne. He silently awaited elucidation.  The combined stares of all parties, including the enigmatic glance of Eemakh, calmed the spluttering Voorhis. Melin continued.  \"In the first place, the true value of the ship, even if we consider her to be incapacitated--which we do not--is only about one hundred and fifty thousand.\"  \"She's worth more than that as scrap!\" bellowed Voorhis.  \"No, captain, just about that. It is exactly how we valued her. Do you have any idea, Judge, of how old that crock is?\"  \"Let's not go into that just yet,\" suggested Mayne.  \"As to the fuel,\" said Melin, \"I am willing, as a gesture of good will, to stick my company's neck out--and mine with it, you may be sure--and honor a full claim.\"  \"Even though he used about half the fuel getting here?\" asked Mayne.  \"We'll ignore that. We admit that he is out of fuel, and we want to--\"  \"You want to give me a moon and take a star,\" said Voorhis.  \"Just a minute!\" Mayne held up his hand. \"That's the ship and the fuel. What about the cargo?\"  \"Why, as to that, Judge, we do not admit that it is lost. It is right over there, easily accessible. We consider it more the job of the Space Force to restore rightful possession than it is the responsibility of the company to reimburse Captain Voorhis for the inflated value he sets upon it.\"  \"I begin to see,\" murmured Mayne. \"You can't stick each other, so you're out to slip _me_ the bill.\"  That aroused a babble of denials. Mayne eventually made himself heard and demanded to know how the spacer's evaluation differed from Melin's. Voorhis pulled himself together, glowering at the insurance man.         *       *       *       *       *  \"In the first place,\" he growled, \"I don't want his lousy payment for fuel. I said I'd take the blame for that, an' I will. On the ship ... well, maybe she ain't worth two million. Maybe she ain't been for a few years now--\"  Melin made a show of counting on his fingers.  \"... But they charged me premiums by that figure an' I say they oughta pay by that figure.\"  \"But can you prove she's a total loss, captain?\" asked Mayne.  Voorhis grimaced and spat upon the ground.  \"Try to get near her, Judge! You'll get proof fast enough!\"  \"Well ... about the cargo, then?\"  \"_That's_ where he's gouging me!\" exploded Voorhis. \"The idea of using the cost as of loading on Rigel IX! Hell, you know the margin of profit there is in trading on these new planets, twenty to one at least. I figured to lift off with four million worth of ores, gems, curios, and whatnot.\"  \"So your point is that the mere transportation of the goods through space to this planet increased their value. What about that, Mr. Melin?\"  Melin shifted uncomfortably on his bench. Mayne would have liked to change his own position, but feared splinters.  \"There is an element of truth in that,\" admitted Melin. \"Still, it would be rash to expect such a return every time a tramp spaceship lands to swap with some aboriginal easy marks.\"  \"I suppose,\" said Mayne, \"that our orange-eyed friends speak no Terran?\"  \"I hope not!\" exclaimed Voorhis.  \"Well, anyway,\" Melin said after a startled pause, \"how can we be expected to pay off on hopes? He wants the paper figure for the ship; but he refuses the paper figure for the cargo.\"  Mayne shrugged. He turned to Haruhiku.  \"If Captain Voorhis and Mr. Melin don't mind, lieutenant, I'd like to get the chief's view of all this.\"  \"Hah!\" grunted Voorhis, clapping both hands to his head.  Melin contented himself with rolling his eyes skyward.  With Haruhiku translating, Mayne began to get acquainted with the Kappans. The visitor from the neighboring city chose mostly to listen attentively, but Igrillik, the priest, occasionally leaned over to whisper sibilantly into Eemakh's recessed ear. Mayne fancied he saw a resemblance between the two, despite Igrillik's professional trappings--a long robe of rough material that had been dyed in stripes and figures of several crude colors, and a tall cap to which were attached a number of pairs of membraneous wings.  [Illustration]  The first thing that Mayne learned was that the _Gemsbok_ was not a spaceship; it was a symbol, a sign sent to the Kappans by the great god Meeg.  \"And why did he send it?\" asked Mayne.  He had sent it as a sign that he was impatient with his children. They had vowed him a temple, they had set aside the necessary land, and yet they had not begun the work.  \"Is that why they're all over there, slaving away so feverishly?\"  It was indeed the reason. After all, Meeg was the god of the inner moon, the one that passed so speedily across the sky. If he could guide the strangers' ship directly to his own plot of ground, he might just as easily have caused it to land in the"]]]
