It is dated 1526, two years before the death of Dürer, and has helped to extend the fame of the universal scholar and approved man of letters, who in his own age filled a sphere not unlike that of Voltaire in a later century. There is another portrait of Erasmus by Holbein, often repeated, so that two great artists have contributed to his renown. That by Dürer is admired. The general fineness of touch, with the accessories of books and flowers, shows the care in its execution; but it wants expression, and the hands are far from graceful.  Another most interesting portrait by Dürer, executed in the same year with the Erasmus, is PHILIP MELANCTHON, the St. John of the Reformation, sometimes called the teacher of Germany. Luther, while speaking of himself as rough, boisterous, stormy, and altogether warlike, says, \"but Master Philippus comes along softly and gently, sowing and watering with joy according to the rich gifts which God has bestowed upon him.\" At the date of the print he was twenty-nine years of age, and the countenance shows the mild reformer.  [Sidenote: Caracci.]  Agostino Caracci, of the Bolognese family, memorable in art, added to considerable success as painter undoubted triumphs as engraver. His prints are numerous, and many are regarded with favor; but out of the long list not one is so sure of that longevity allotted to art as his portrait of TITIAN, which bears date 1587, eleven years after the death of the latter. Over it is the inscription, _Titiani Vicellii Pictoris celeberrimi ac famosissimi vera effigies_, to which is added beneath, _Cujus nomen orbis continere non valet_! Although founded on originals by Titian himself, it was probably designed by the remarkable engraver. It is very like, and yet unlike the familiar portrait of which we have a recent engraving by Mandel, from a repetition in the gallery of Berlin. Looking at it, we are reminded of the terms by which Vasari described the great painter, _guidicioso, bello e stupendo_. Such a head, with such visible power, justifies these words, or at least makes us believe them entirely applicable. It is bold, broad, strong, and instinct with life.  This print, like the Erasmus of Dürer, is among those selected for exhibition at the British Museum, and it deserves the honor. Though only paper with black lines, it is, by the genius of the artist, as good as a picture. In all engraving nothing is better.  [Sidenote: Goltzius.]  Contemporary with Caracci was Hendrik Goltzius, at Harlem, excellent as painter, but, like the Italian, pre-eminent as engraver. His prints show mastery of the art, making something like an epoch in its history. His unwearied skill in the use of the burin appears in a tradition gathered by Longhi from Wille, that, having commenced a line, he carried it to the end without once stopping, while the long and bright threads of copper turned up were brushed aside by his flowing beard, which at the end of a day's labor so shone in the light of a candle that his companions nicknamed him \"the man with the golden beard.\" There are prints by him which shine more than his beard. Among his masterpieces is the portrait of his instructor, THEODORE COERNHERT, engraver, poet, musician, and vindicator of his country, and author of the national air, \"William of Orange,\" whose passion for liberty did not prevent him from giving to the world translations of Cicero's Offices and Seneca's Treatise on Beneficence. But that of the ENGRAVER HIMSELF, as large as life, is one of the most important in the art. Among the numerous prints by Goltzius, these two will always be conspicuous.  [Illustration: JAN LUTMA.  (Etched by Rembrandt from his own Design.)]  [Sidenote: Pontius.]  [Sidenote: Rembrandt.]  [Sidenote: Visscher.]  In Holland Goltzius had eminent successors. Among these were Paul Pontius, designer and engraver, whose portrait of RUBENS is of great life and beauty, and Rembrandt, who was not less masterly in engraving than in painting, as appears sufficiently in his portraits of the BURGOMASTER SIX, the two COPPENOLS, the ADVOCATE TOLLING, the goldsmith LUTMA, all showing singular facility and originality. Contemporary with Rembrandt was Cornelis Visscher, also designer and engraver, whose portraits were unsurpassed in boldness and picturesque effect. At least one authority has accorded to this artist the palm of engraving, hailing him as Corypheus of the art. Among his successful portraits is that of a CAT; but all yield to what are known as the GREAT BEARDS, being the portraits of WILLIAM DE RYCK, an ophthalmist at Amsterdam, and of GELLIUS DE BOUMA, the Zutphen ecclesiastic. The latter is especially famous. In harmony with the beard is the heavy face, seventy-seven years old, showing the fulness of long-continued potation, and hands like the face, original and powerful, if not beautiful.  [Illustration: THE SLEEPING CAT.  (Engraved by Cornelis Visscher from his own Design.)]  [Sidenote: Vandyck.]  In contrast with Visscher was his companion Vandyck, who painted portraits with constant beauty and carried into etching the same Virgilian taste and skill. His aquafortis was not less gentle than his pencil. Among his etched portraits I would select that of SNYDERS, the animal painter, as extremely beautiful. M. Renouvier, in his learned and elaborate work, _Des Types et des Maniéres des Maîtres Graveurs_, though usually moderate in praise, speaks of these sketches as \"possessing a boldness and delicacy which charm, being taken, at the height of his genius, by the painter who knew the best how to idealize the painting of portraits.\"  Such are illustrative instances from Germany, Italy, and Holland. As yet, power rather than beauty presided, unless in the etchings of Vandyck. But the reign of Louis XIV. was beginning to assert a supremacy in engraving as in literature. The great school of French engravers which appeared at this time brought the art to a splendid perfection, which many think has not been equalled since, so that Masson, Nanteuil, Edelinck, and Drevet may claim fellowship in genius with their immortal contemporaries, Corneille, Racine, La Fontaine, and Molière.  [Illustration: THE SUDARIUM OF ST. VERONICA.  (Engraved by Claude Mellan from his own Design.)]  [Sidenote: Mellan.]  The school was opened by Claude Mellan, more known as engraver than painter, and also author of most of the designs he engraved. His life, beginning with the sixteenth century, was protracted beyond ninety years, not without signal honor, for his name appears among the \"Illustrious Men\" of France, in the beautiful volumes of Perrault, which is also a homage to the art he practiced. One of his works, for a long time much admired, was described by this author:       \"It is a Christ's head, designed and shaded, with his crown      of thorns and the blood that gushes forth from all parts, by      one single stroke, which, beginning at the tip of the nose,      and so still circling on, forms most exactly everything that      is represented in this plate, only by the different      thickness of the stroke, which, according as it is more or      less swelling, makes the eyes, nose, mouth, cheeks, hair,      blood, and thorns; the whole so well represented and with      such expressions of pain and affliction, that nothing is      more dolorous or touching.\"[4]  This print is known as the SUDARIUM OF ST. VERONICA. Longhi records that it was thought at the time \"inimitable,\" and was praised \"to the skies;\" but people think differently now. At best it is a curiosity among portraits. A traveler reported some time ago that it was the sole print on the walls of the room occupied by the director of the Imperial Cabinet of Engravings at St. Petersburgh.  [Sidenote: Morin.]  Morin was a contemporary of Mellan, and less famous at the time. His style of engraving was peculiar, being a mixture of strokes and dots, but so harmonized as to produce a pleasing effect. One of the best engraved portraits in the history of the art is his CARDINAL BENTIVOGLIO; but here he translated Vandyck, whose picture is among his best. A fine impression of this print is a choice possession.  [Illustration: CARDINAL BENTIVOGLIO.  (Painted by Anthony Van Dyck, and Engraved by Jean Morin.)]  [Sidenote: Masson.]  Among French masters Antoine Masson is conspicuous for brilliant hardihood of style, which, though failing in taste, is powerful in effect. Metal, armor, velvet, feather, seem as if painted. He is also most successful in the treatment of hair. His immense skill made him welcome difficulties, as if to show his ability in overcoming them. His print of HENRI DE LORRAINE, COMTE D'HARCOURT, known as _Cadet à la Perle_, from the pearl in the ear, with the date 1667, is often placed at the head of engraved portraits, although not particularly pleasing or interesting. The vigorous countenance is aided by the gleam and sheen of the various substances entering into the costume. Less powerful, but having a charm of its own, is that of BRISACIER, known as the GRAY-HAIRED MAN, executed in 1664. The remarkable representation of hair in this print has been a model for artists, especially for Longhi, who recounts that he copied it in his head of Washington. Somewhat similar is the head of CHARRIER, the criminal judge at Lyons. Though inferior in hair, it surpasses the other in expression.  [Sidenote: Nanteuil.]  Nanteuil was an artist of different character, being to Masson as Vandyck to Visscher, with less of vigor than beauty. His original genius was refined by classical studies, and quickened by diligence. Though dying at the age of forty-eight, he had executed as many as two hundred and eighty plates, nearly all portraits. The favor he enjoyed during life was not diminished with time. His works illustrate the reign of Louis XIV., and are still admired. Among these are portraits of the KING, ANNIE OF AUSTRIA, JOHN BAPTISTE VAN STEENBERGHEN, the Advocate-General of"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22574"],["title","The Best Portraits in Engraving (#2)"],["body","nd, a heavy Dutchman, FRANÇOIS DE LA MOTTE LE VAYER, a fine and delicate work, TURENNE, COLBERT, LAMOIGNON, the poet LORET, MARIDAT DE SERRIÈRE, LOUISE-MARIE DE GONZAGUE, LOUIS HESSELIN, CHRISTINE OF SWEDEN--all masterpieces; but above these is the POMPONE DE BELLIÈVRE, foremost among his masterpieces, and a chief masterpiece of art, being, in the judgment of more than one connoisseur, the most beautiful engraved portrait that exists. That excellent authority, Dr. Thies, who knew engraving more thoroughly and sympathetically than any person I remember in our country, said in a letter to myself, as long ago as March, 1858:       \"When I call Nanteuil's Pompone the handsomest engraved      portrait, I express a conviction to which I came when I      studied all the remarkable engraved portraits at the royal      cabinet of engravings at Dresden, and at the large and      exquisite collection there of the late King of Saxony, and      in which I was confirmed or perhaps, to which I was led, by      the director of the two establishments, the late Professor      Frenzel.\"  And after describing this head, the learned connoisseur proceeds:--       \"There is an air of refinement, _vornehmheit_, round the      mouth and nose as in no other engraving. Color and life      shine through the skin, and the lips appear red.\"  It is bold, perhaps, thus to exalt a single portrait, giving to it the palm of Venus; nor do I know that it is entirely proper to classify portraits according to beauty. In disputing about beauty, we are too often lost in the variety of individual tastes, and yet each person knows when he is touched. In proportion as multitudes are touched, there must be merit. As in music a simple heart-melody is often more effective than any triumph over difficulties, or bravura of manner, so in engraving the sense of the beautiful may prevail over all else, and this is the case with the Pompone, although there are portraits by others showing higher art.  No doubt there have been as handsome men, whose portraits were engraved, but not so well. I know not if Pompone was what would be called a handsome man, although his air is noble and his countenance bright. But among portraits more boldly, delicately, or elaborately engraved, there are very few to contest the palm of beauty.  [Illustration: POMPONE DE BELLIÈVRE.  (Painted by Charles Le Brun, and Engraved by Robert Nanteuil.)]  And who is this handsome man to whom the engraver has given a lease of fame? Son, nephew, and grandson of eminent magistrates, high in the nobility of the robe, with two grandfathers chancellors of France, himself at the head of the magistry of France, first President of Parliament according to inscription on the engraving, _Senatus Franciæ Princeps_, ambassador to Italy, Holland, and England, charged in the latter country by Cardinal Mazarin with the impossible duty of making peace between the Long Parliament and Charles the First, and at his death, great benefactor of the General Hospital of Paris, bestowing upon it riches and the very bed on which he died. Such is the simple catalogue, and yet it is all forgotten.  A Funeral Panegyric pronounced at his death, now before me in the original pamphlet of the time,[5] testifies to more than family or office. In himself he was much, and not of those who, according to the saying of St. Bernard, give out smoke rather than light. Pure glory and innocent riches were his, which were more precious in the sight of good men, and he showed himself incorruptible, and not to be bought at any price. It were easy for him to have turned a deluge of wealth into his house; but he knew that gifts insensibly corrupt,--that the specious pretext of gratitude is the snare in which the greatest souls allow themselves to be caught,--that a man covered with favors has difficulty in setting himself against injustice in all its forms, and that a magistrate divided between a sense of obligations received and the care of the public interest, which he ought always to promote, is a paralytic magistrate, a magistrate deprived of a moiety of himself. So spoke the preacher, while he portrayed a charity tender and prompt for the wretched, a vehemence just and inflexible to the dishonest and wicked, with a sweetness noble and beneficent for all; dwelling also on his countenance, which had not that severe and sour austerity that renders justice to the good only with regret, and to the guilty only with anger; then on his pleasant and gracious address, his intellectual and charming conversation, his ready and judicious replies, his agreeable and intelligent silence, his refusals, which were well received and obliging; while, amidst all the pomp and splendor accompanying him, there shone in his eyes a certain air of humanity and majesty, which secured for him, and for justice itself, love as well as respect. His benefactions were constant. Not content with giving only his own, he gave with a beautiful manner still more rare. He could not abide beauty of intelligence without goodness of soul, and he preferred always the poor, having for them not only compassion but a sort of reverence. He knew that the way to take the poison from riches was to make them tasted by those who had them not. The sentiment of Christian charity for the poor, who were to him in the place of children, was his last thought, as witness especially the General Hospital endowed by him, and presented by the preacher as the greatest and most illustrious work ever undertaken by charity the most heroic.  Thus lived and died the splendid Pompone de Bellièvre, with no other children than his works. Celebrated at the time by a Funeral Panegyric now forgotten, and placed among the Illustrious Men of France in a work remembered only for its engraved portraits, his famous life shrinks, in the voluminous _Biographie Universelle_ of Michaud, to the seventh part of a single page, and in the later _Biographie Généralle_ of Didot disappears entirely. History forgets to mention him. But the lofty magistrate, ambassador, and benefactor, founder of a great hospital, cannot be entirely lost from sight so long as his portrait by Nanteuil holds a place in art.  [Sidenote: Edelinck.]  Younger than Nanteuil by ten years, Gérard Edelinck excelled him in genuine mastery. Born at Antwerp, he became French by adoption, occupying apartments in the Gobelins, and enjoying a pension from Louis XIV. Longhi says that he is the engraver whose works, not only according to his own judgment, but that of the most intelligent, deserve the first place among exemplars, and he attributes to him all perfections in highest degree, design, chiaro-oscuro, ærial perspective, local tints, softness, lightness, variety, in short everything which can enter into the most exact representation of the true and beautiful without the aid of color. Others may have surpassed him in particular things, but, according to the Italian teacher, he remains by common consent \"the prince of engraving.\" Another critic calls him \"king.\"  It requires no remarkable knowledge to recognize his great merits. Evidently he is a master, exercising sway with absolute art, and without attempts to bribe the eye by special effects of light, as on metal or satin. Among his conspicuous productions is the TENT OF DARIUS, a large engraving on two sheets, after Le Brun, where the family of the Persian monarch prostrate themselves before Alexander, who approaches with Hephæstion. There is also a HOLY FAMILY, after Raffaelle, and the BATTLE OF THE STANDARD, after Leonardo da Vinci; but these are less interesting than his numerous portraits, among which that of PHILIPPE DE CHAMPAIGNE is the chief masterpiece; but there are others of signal merit, including especially that of MADAME HELIOT, or _La Belle Religieuse_, a beautiful French coquette praying before a crucifix; MARTIN VAN DER BOGAERT, a sculptor; FREDERIC LÉONARD, printer to the king; MOUTON, the Lute-player; MARTINUS DILGERUS, with a venerable beard white with age; JULES HARDOUIN MANSART, the architect; also a portrait of POMPONE DE BELLIÈVRE which will be found among the prints of Perrault's Illustrious Men.  The PHILIPPE DE CHAMPAIGNE is the head of that eminent French artist after a painting by himself, and it contests the palm with the Pompone. Mr. Marsh, who is an authority, prefers it. Dr. Thies, who places the latter first in beauty, is constrained to allow that the other is \"superior as a work of the graver,\" being executed with all the resources of the art in its chastest form. The enthusiasm of Longhi finds expression in unusual praise:       \"The work which goes the most to my blood, and with regard      to which Edelinck, with good reason, congratulated himself,      is the portrait of Champaigne. I shall die before I cease to      contemplate it with wonder always new. Here is seen how he      was equally great as designer and engraver.\"[6]  [Illustration: MARTIN VAN DER BOGAERT.  (Painted by Hyacinthe Rigaud, and Engraved by Gérard Edelinck.)]  And he then dwells on various details; the skin, the flesh, the eyes living and seeing, the moistened lips, the chin covered with a beard unshaven for a few days, and the hair in all its forms.  Between the rival portraits by Nanteuil and Edelinck it is unnecessary to decide. Each is beautiful. In looking at them we recognize anew the transient honors of public service. The present fame of Champaigne surpasses that of Pompone. The artist outlives the magistrate. But does not the poet tell us that \"the artist never dies?\"  [Sidenote: Drevet.]  As Edelinck passed from the scene, the family of Drevet appeared, especially the son, Pierre Imbert Drevet, born in 1697, who developed a rare excellence, improving even upon the technics of his predecessor, and gilding his refined gold. The son was born engraver, for at the age of thirteen he produced an engraving of exceeding merit. He manifested a singular skill in rendering different substances,"]]]
