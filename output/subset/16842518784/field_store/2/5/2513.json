The windows stood open, and sunshine and fresh air came in to join the revel. Babies crowed and prattled, mammas chatted together, old people found they had not forgotten how to laugh, and boys and girls rejoiced over the discovery of a new delight for holidays. It was good to be there, and in spite of all the discussion in papers and parlors, no harm came to the young mariners, but much careful training of various sorts, and well-earned wages that went into pockets which sorely needed a silver lining.   HOW THE VOYAGE ENDED.  So the good ship \"Pinafore\" sailed and sailed for many prosperous weeks, and when at last she came into port and dropped anchor for the season she was received with a salute of general approbation for the successful engagement out of which she came with her flags flying and not one of her gallant crew killed or wounded. Well pleased with their share of the glory, officers and men went ashore to spend their prize money with true sailor generosity, all eager to ship again for another cruise in the autumn.  But long before that time Able Seaman James Nelson had sent his family into the country, mother begging Will to take good care of her dear boy till he could join them, and Kitty throwing kisses as she smiled good-by, with cheeks already the rosier for the comforts \"brother\" had earned for her. Jimmy would not desert his ship while she floated, but managed to spend his Sundays out of town, often taking Will with him as first mate; and, thanks to her lively tongue, friends were soon made for the new-comers. Mrs. Nelson found plenty of sewing, Kitty grew strong and well in the fine air, and the farmer with whom they lived, seeing what a handy lad the boy was, offered him work and wages for the autumn, so all could be independent and together. With this comfortable prospect before him, Jimmy sang away like a contented blackbird, never tiring of his duty, for he was a general favorite, and Kitty literally strewed his way with flowers gathered by her own grateful little hands.  When the last day came, he was in such spirits that he was found doing double-shuffles in corners, hugging the midshipmite, who was a little girl of about Kitty's age, and treating his messmates to peanuts with a lavish hand. Will had her hornpipe, also, when the curtain was down, kissed every one of the other \"sisters, cousins, and aunts,\" and joined lustily in the rousing farewell cheers given by the crew.  A few hours later, a cheerful-looking boy might have been seen trudging toward one of the railway-stations. A new hat, brave in blue streamers, was on his head; a red balloon struggled to escape from one hand; a shabby carpet-bag, stuffed full, was in the other; and a pair of shiny shoes creaked briskly, as if the feet inside were going on a very pleasant errand.  About this young traveller, who walked with a sailor-like roll and lurch, revolved a little girl chattering like a magpie, and occasionally breaking into song, as if she couldn't help it.  \"Be sure you come next Saturday; it won't be half such fun if you don't go halves,\" said the boy, beaming at her as he hauled down the impatient balloon, which seemed inclined to break from its moorings  \"'Yes, I know That is so!'\"  hummed the girl with a skip to starboard, that she might bear a hand with the bag. \"Keep some cherries for me, and don't forget to give Kit the doll I dressed for her.\"  \"I shouldn't have been going myself if it hadn't been for you, Will. I never shall forget that,\" said Jimmy, whom intense satisfaction rendered rather more sedate than his friend.  \"Running away to sea is great fun,  'With a tar that ploughs the water!'\"  sung Will in spite of herself.  \"'And a gallant captain's daughter,'\"  echoed Jimmy, smiling across the carpet-bag. Then both joined in an irrepressible chorus of \"Dash it! Dash it!\" as a big man nearly upset them and a dog barked madly at the balloon.  Being safely landed in the train, Jimmy hung out of the window till the last minute, discussing his new prospects with Will, who stood on tiptoe outside, bubbling over with fun.  \"I'll teach you to make butter and cheese, and you shall be my dairy-woman, for I mean to be a farmer,\" he said, just as the bell rang.  \"All right, I'd like that ever so much.\" And then the irrepressible madcap burst out, to the great amusement of the passengers,--  \"'For you might have been a Roosian, A Frenchman, Turk or Proosian,         Or an Ital-i-an.'\"  And Jimmy could not resist shouting back, as the train began to move,--  \"'But in spite of all temptations To belong to other nations,     I'm an Amer-i-can.'\"  Then he subsided, to think over the happy holiday before him and the rich cargo of comfort, independence, and pleasure he had brought home from his successful cruise in the \"Pinafore.\"     II.  TWO LITTLE TRAVELLERS.   The first of these true histories is about Annie Percival,--a very dear and lovely child, whose journey interested many other children, and is still remembered with gratitude by those whom she visited on a far-off island.  Annie was six when she sailed away to Fayal with her mother, grandmamma, and \"little Aunt Ruth,\" as she called the young aunty who was still a school-girl. Very cunning was Annie's outfit, and her little trunk was a pretty as well as a curious sight, for everything was so small and complete it looked as if a doll was setting off for Europe. Such a wee dressing-case, with bits of combs and brushes for the curly head; such a cosey scarlet wrapper for the small woman to wear in her berth, with slippers to match when she trotted from state-room to state-room; such piles of tiny garments laid nicely in, and the owner's initials on the outside of the trunk; not to mention the key on a ribbon in her pocket, as grown up as you please.  I think the sight of that earnest, sunshiny face must have been very pleasant to all on board, no matter how seasick they might be, and the sound of the cheery little voice, as sweet as the chirp of a bird, especially when she sung the funny song about the \"Owl and the pussy-cat in the pea-green boat,\" for she had charming ways, and was always making quaint, wise, or loving remarks.  Well, \"they sailed and they sailed,\" and came at last to Fayal, where everything was so new and strange that Annie's big brown eyes could hardly spare time to sleep, so busy were they looking about. The donkeys amused her very much, so did the queer language and ways of the Portuguese people round her, especially the very droll names given to the hens of a young friend. The biddies seemed to speak the same dialect as at home, but evidently they understood Spanish also, and knew their own names, so it was fun to go and call Rio, Pico, Cappy, Clarissa, Whorfie, and poor Simonena, whose breast-bone grew out so that she could not eat and had to be killed.  But the thing which made the deepest impression on Annie was a visit to a charity-school at the old convent of San Antonio. It was kept by some kind ladies, and twenty-five girls were taught and cared for in the big, bare place, that looked rather gloomy and forlorn to people from happy Boston, where charitable institutions are on a noble scale, as everybody knows.  Annie watched all that went on with intelligent interest, and when they were shown into the play-room she was much amazed and afflicted to find that the children had nothing to play with but a heap of rags, out of which they made queer dolls, with ravelled twine for hair, faces rudely drawn on the cloth, and funny boots on the shapeless legs. No other toys appeared, but the girls sat on the floor of the great stone room,--for there was no furniture,--playing contentedly with their poor dolls, and smiling and nodding at \"the little Americana,\" who gravely regarded this sad spectacle, wondering how they could get on without china and waxen babies, tea-sets, and pretty chairs and tables to keep house with.  The girls thought that she envied them their dolls, and presently one came shyly up to offer two of their best, leaving the teacher to explain in English their wish to be polite to their distinguished guest. Like the little gentlewoman she was, Annie graciously accepted the ugly bits of rag with answering nods and smiles, and carried them away with her as carefully as if they were of great beauty and value.  But when she was at home she expressed much concern and distress at the destitute condition of the children. Nothing but rags to play with seemed a peculiarly touching state of poverty to her childish mind, and being a generous creature she yearned to give of her abundance to \"all the poor orphans who didn't have any nice dollies.\" She had several pets of her own, but not enough to go round even if she sacrificed them, so kind grandmamma, who had been doing things of this sort all her life, relieved the child's perplexity by promising to send twenty-five fine dolls to Fayal as soon as the party returned to Boston, where these necessaries of child-life are cheap and plenty.  Thus comforted, Annie felt that she could enjoy her dear Horta and Chica Pico Fatiera, particular darlings rechristened since her arrival. A bundle of gay bits of silk, cloth, and flannel, and a present of money for books, were sent out to the convent by the ladies. A treat of little cheeses for the girls to eat with their dry bread was added, much to Annie's satisfaction, and helped to keep alive her interest in the school of San Antonio.  After many pleasant adventures during the six months spent in the city, our party came sailing home again all the better for the trip, and Annie so full of tales to tell that it was a never-failing source of amusement to hear her hold forth to her younger brother in her pretty way, \"splaining and 'scribing all about it.\""]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22239"],["title","Security (#1)"],["body","s. It's been a sort of specialty of mine, in fact. I wrote my thesis on the theory of dielectric polarization and since then--no, that's classified.\"  \"M-hm.\" Berg took another sip of his drink. \"And right now you're just a cog in a computer-development Project. You see, I do know a few things about you. However, we've decided--higher up, you know, in fact on the very top level--to take you off it for the time being and put you on this other job, one concerning your specialty. Furthermore, you won't be part of a great organizational machine, but very much on your own. The fewer who know of this, the better.\"  Lancaster wasn't sure he liked that. Once the job was done--if he were possessed of all information on it--he might be incarcerated or even shot as a Security risk. Things like that had happened. But there wasn't much he could do about it.  \"Have no fears.\" Berg seemed to read his thoughts. \"Your reward may be a little delayed for Security reasons, but it will come in due time.\" He leaned forward, earnestly. \"I repeat, this project is _top secret_. It's a vital link in something much bigger than you can imagine, and few men below the President even know of it. Therefore, the very fact that you've worked on it--that you've done any outside work at all--must remain unknown, even to the chiefs of your Project.\"  \"Good stunt if you can do it,\" shrugged Lancaster. \"But I'm hot. Security keeps tabs on everything I do.\"  \"This is how we'll work it. You have a furlough coming up in two weeks, don't you--a three months' furlough? Where were you going?\"  \"I thought I'd visit the Southwest. Get in some mountain climbing, see the canyons and Indian ruins and--\"  \"Yes, yes. Very well. You'll get your ticket as usual and a reservation at the Tycho Hotel in Phoenix. You'll go there and, on your first evening, retire early. Alone, I need hardly add. We'll be waiting for you in your room. There'll be a very carefully prepared duplicate--surgical disguise, plastic fingerprinting tips, fully educated in your habits, tastes, and mannerisms. He'll stay behind and carry out your vacation while we smuggle you away. A similar exchange will be affected when you return, you'll be told exactly how your double spent the summer, and you'll resume your ordinary life.\"  \"Ummm--well--\" It was too sudden. Lancaster had to hedge. \"But look--I'll be supposedly coming back from an outdoor vacation, with a suntan and well rested. Somebody's going to get suspicious.\"  \"There'll be sun lamps where you're going, my friend. And I think the chance to work independently on something that really interests you will prove every bit as restful to your nerves as a summer's travel. I know the scientific mentality.\" Berg chuckled. \"Yes, indeed.\"         *       *       *       *       *  The exchange went off so smoothly that it was robbed of all melodrama, though Lancaster had an unexpectedly eerie moment when he confronted his double. It was his own face that looked at him, there in the impersonal hotel room, himself framed against blowing curtains and darkness of night. Then Berg gestured him to follow and they went down a cord ladder hanging from the window sill. A car waited in the alley below and slid into easy motion the instant they had gotten inside.  There was a driver and another man in the front seat, both shadows against the moving blur of street lamps and night. Berg and Lancaster sat in the rear, and the secret agent chatted all the way. But he said nothing of informational content.  When the highway had taken them well into the loneliness of the desert, the car turned off it, bumped along a miserable dirt track until it had crossed a ridge, and slowed before a giant transcontinental dieselectric truck. A man emerged from its cab, waving an unhurried arm, and the car swung around to the rear of the van. There was a tailgate lowered, forming a ramp; above it, the huge double doors opened on a cavern of blackness. The car slid up the ramp, and the man outside pushed it in after them and closed the doors. Presently the truck got into motion.  \"This is _really_ secret!\" whistled Lancaster. He felt awed and helpless.  \"Quite so. Security doesn't like the government's right hand to know what its left is doing.\" Berg smiled, a dim flash of teeth in his shadowy face. Then he was serious. \"It's necessary, Lancaster. You don't know how strong and well-organized the subversives are.\"  \"They--\" The physicist closed his mouth. It was true--he hadn't the faintest notion, really. He followed the news, but in a cursory fashion, without troubling to analyze the meaning of it. Damn it all, he had enough else to think about. Just as well that elections had been suspended and bade fair to continue indefinitely in abeyance. If he, a member of the intelligentsia, wasn't sufficiently acquainted with the political and military facts of life to make rational decisions, it certainly behooved the ill-educated masses to obey.  \"We might as well stretch ourselves,\" said the driver. \"Long way to go yet.\" He climbed out and switched on an overhead light.         *       *       *       *       *  The interior of the van was roomy, even allowing for the car. There were bunks, a table and chairs, a small refrigerator and cookstove. The driver, a lean saturnine man who seemed to be forever chewing gum, began to prepare coffee. The other sat down, whistling tunelessly. He was young and powerfully built, but his right arm ended in a prosthetic claw. All of them were dressed in inconspicuous civilian garb.  \"Take us about ten hours, maybe,\" said Berg. \"The spaceship's 'way over in Colorado.\"  He caught Lancaster's blank stare, and grinned. \"Yes, my friend, your lab is out in space. Surprised?\"  \"Mmm--yeah. I've never been off Earth.\"  \"Sokay. We run at acceleration, you won't be spacesick.\" Berg drew up a chair, sat down, and tilted it back against a wall. The steady rumble of engines pulsed under his words:  \"It's interesting, really, to consider the relationship between government and military technology. The powerful, authoritarian governments have always arisen in such times as the evolution of warfare made a successful fighting machine something elaborate, expensive, and maintainable by professionals only. Like in the Roman Empire. It took years to train a legionnaire and a lot of money to equip an army and keep it in the field. So Rome became autarchic. However, it was not so expensive a proposition that a rebellious general couldn't put some troops up for a while--or he could pay them with plunder. So you did get civil wars. Later, when the Empire had broken up and warfare relied largely on the individual barbarian who brought his own weapons with him, government loosened. It had to--any ruler who got to throwing his weight around too much would have insurrection on his hands. Then as war again became an art--well, you see how it goes. There are other factors, of course, like religion--ideology in general. But by and large, it's worked out the way I explained it. Because there are always people willing to fight when government encroaches on what they consider their liberties, and governments are always going to try to encroach. So the balance struck depends on comparative strength. The American colonists back in 1776 relied on citizen levies and weapons were so cheap and simple that almost anyone could obtain them. Therefore government stayed loose for a long time. But nowadays, who except a government can make atomic bombs and space rockets? So we get absolute states.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Lancaster looked around, feeling the loneliness close in on him. The driver was still clattering the coffee pot. The one-armed man was utterly blank and expressionless. And Berg sat there, smiling, pouring out those damnable cynicisms. Was it some kind of test? Were they probing his loyalty? What kind of reply was expected?  \"We're a democratic nation and you know it,\" he said. It came out more feebly than he had thought.  \"Oh, well, sure. This is just a state of emergency which has lasted unusually long, seventy-two years to be exact. If we hadn't lost World War III, and needed a powerful remilitarization to overthrow the Soviet world--but we did.\" Berg took out a pack of cigarettes. \"Smoke? I was just trying to explain to you why the subversives are so dangerous. They have to be, or they wouldn't stand any kind of chance. When you set out to upset something as big as the United States government, it's an all or nothing proposition. They've had a long time now to organize, and there's a huge percentage of malcontents to help them out.\"  \"Malcontents? Well, look, Berg--I mean, you're the expert and of course you know your business, but a natural human grumble at conditions doesn't mean revolutionary sentiments. These aren't such bad times. People have work, and their needs are supplied. They aren't hankering to have the Hemispheric Wars back again.\"  \"The standard revolutionary argument,\" said Berg patiently, \"is that the rebels aren't trying to overthrow the nation at all, but simply to restore constitutional and libertarian government. It's common knowledge that they have help and some subsidies from outside, but it's contended that these are merely countries tired of a world dominated by an American dictatorship and, being small Latin-American and European states, couldn't possibly think of conquering us. Surely you've seen subversive literature.\"  \"Well, yes. Can't help finding their pamphlets. All over the place. And--\" Lancaster closed his mouth. No, damned if he was going to admit that he knew three co-workers who listened to rebel propaganda broadcasts. Those were silly, harmless kids--why get them in trouble, maybe get them sent to camp?         *       *       *       *       *  \"You probably don't appreciate the hold that kind of argument has on all too many intellectuals--and a lot of the common herd, too,\" said Berg. \"Naturally you wouldn't--if"]]]
