He'll get along. He's improving. Why, he did as good a job of transplanting as any man this spring. Last year, he bruised the seedlings, but I gave him a good dressing down and he remembered it. He'll be all right.\"  \"I'm not talking about that, Ank,\" said the old man, \"I mean him and Zillia. He's really got a case on with that girl.\"  \"Anything wrong with that? A young fellow's got a right to fall in love, hasn't he? And Zillia seems pretty keen on him, too. If her father doesn't object, everything ought to go along pretty smoothly.\"  \"Her father might not object,\" said Blejjo, looking down at his feet as they paced off the dusty road. \"But there's others who might object.\"  \"Who, for instance?\"  Blejjo was silent for several steps. Then he said: \"Well, Kevenoe, for one.\"  Anketam thought that over in silence. Kevenoe was on The Chief's staff at the castle. Like many staff men--including, Anketam thought wryly, his own brother Russat, on occasion--he tended to lord it over the farmers who worked the land. \"Kevenoe has an eye on Zillia?\" he asked after a moment.  \"I understand he's asked Chief Samas for her as soon as she's eighteen. That would be this fall, after harvest.\"  \"I see,\" Anketam said thoughtfully. He didn't ask how the old man had come about his knowledge. Old Blejjo had little to do, and on the occasions that he had to do some work around The Chief's castle, he made it a point to pick up gossip. But he was careful with his information; he didn't go spreading it around for all to hear, and he made it a point to verify his information before he passed it on. Anketam respected the old man. He was the only one in the village who called him \"Ank,\" outside of Memi.  \"Do you think The Chief will give her to Kevenoe?\" he asked.  Blejjo nodded. \"Looks like it. He thinks a great deal of Kevenoe.\"  \"No reason why he shouldn't,\" said Anketam. \"Kevenoe's a good man.\"  \"Oh, I know that,\" said the old man. \"But Basom won't like it at all. And I don't think Zillia will, either.\"  \"That's the way things happen,\" said Anketam. \"A man can't expect to go through life having everything his own way. There's other girls around for Basom. If he can't have the prettiest, he'll have to be satisfied with someone else.\" He chuckled. \"That's why I picked Memi. She's not beautiful and never was, but she's a wonderful wife.\"  \"That's so,\" said Blejjo. \"A wise man is one who only wants what he knows he can have. Right now\"--he took off his hat and wiped his bald head--\"all I want is a dip in that river.\"  \"Swim first and then fish?\"  \"I think so, don't you? Basom was right about this hot sun.\"  \"I'll go along with you,\" agreed Anketam.  They made their way to the river, to the shallow place at the bend where everyone swam. There were a dozen and more kids there, having a great time in the slow moving water, and several of the older people soaking themselves and keeping an eye on the kids to make sure they didn't wander out to where the water was deep and the current swift.  Anketam and Blejjo took off their clothes and cooled themselves in the water for a good half hour before they dressed again and went on upriver to a spot where Blejjo swore the fish were biting.  They were. In the next four hours, the two men had caught six fish apiece, and Blejjo was trying for his seventh. Here, near the river, there was a slight breeze, and it was fairly cool beneath the overhanging branches of the closely bunched trees.  Blejjo had spotted a big, red-and-yellow striped beauty loafing quietly in a back eddy, and he was lowering his hook gently to a point just in front of the fish when both men heard the voice calling.  \"Anketam! Anketam! Blejjo! Where you at?\"  Blejjo went on with his careful work, knowing that Anketam would take care of whatever it was.  Anketam recognized the voice. He stood up and called: \"Over here, Basom! What's the trouble?\"  A minute later, Basom came running through the trees, his feet crashing through the underbrush.  Blejjo sat up abruptly, an angry look on his face. \"Basom, you scared my fish away.\"  \"Fish, nothing,\" said Basom. \"I ran all the way here to tell you!\" He was grinning widely and panting for breath at the same time.  \"You suddenly got an awful lot of energy,\" Blejjo said sourly.  \"What happened?\" Anketam asked.  \"The invasion!\" Basom said between breaths. \"Kevenoe himself came down to tell us! They've started the invasion! The war's on!\"  \"Than what are you looking so happy about?\" Anketam snapped.  \"That's what I came to tell you.\" Basom's grin didn't fade in the least. \"They landed up in the Frozen Country, where our missiles couldn't get 'em, according to Kevenoe. Then they started marching down on one of the big towns. Tens of thousands of 'em! And we whipped 'em! Our army cut 'em to pieces and sent 'em running back to their base! We won! We _won_!\"   III  The battle had been won, but the war wasn't won yet. The invaders had managed to establish a good-sized base up in the Frozen Country. They'd sneaked their ships in and had put up a defensive system that stopped any high-speed missiles. Not that Xedii had many missiles. Xedii was an agricultural planet; most manufactured articles were imported. It had never occurred to the government of Xedii that there would be any real need for implements of war.  The invaders seemed to be limiting their use of weapons, too. They wanted to control the planet, not destroy it. Through the summer and into the autumn, Anketam listened to the news as it filtered down from the battlegrounds. There were skirmishes here and there, but nothing decisive. Xedii seemed to be holding her own against the invaders.  After the first news of the big victory, things settled back pretty much to normal.  The harvest was good that year, but after the leaves were shredded and dried, they went into storage warehouses. The invaders had set up a patrol system around Xedii which prevented the slow cargo ships from taking off or landing. A few adventurous space officers managed to get a ship out now and then, but those few flights could hardly be called regular trade shipments.  The cool of winter had come when Chief Samas did something he had never done before. He called all the men in the barony to assemble before the main gate of the castle enclosure. He had a speech to make.  For the first time, Anketam felt a touch of apprehension. He got his crew together, and they walked to the castle in silence, wondering what it was that The Chief had to say.  All the men of the barony, except those who couldn't be spared from their jobs, were assembled in front of Chief Samas' baronial castle.  The castle itself was not a single building. Inside the four-foot-high thorn hedge that surrounded the two-acre area, there were a dozen buildings of hard, irridescent plastic shining in the sun. They all looked soft and pleasant and comfortable. Even the thorn hedge, filled as it was by the lacy leaves that concealed the hard, sharp thorns, looked soft and inviting.  Anketam listened to the soft murmur of whispered conversation from the men around him. They stood quietly outside the main gate that led into the castle area, waiting for The Chief to appear, and wondering among themselves what it was that The Chief had to say.  \"You think the invaders have won?\"  Anketam recognized the hoarse whisper from the man behind him. He turned to face the dark, squat, hard-looking man who had spoken. \"It couldn't be, Jacovik. It couldn't be.\"  The other supervisor looked down at his big, knuckle-scarred hands instead of looking at Anketam. He was not a handsome man, Jacovik; his great, beaklike nose was canted to one side from a break that had come in his teens; his left eye was squinted almost closed by the scar tissue that surrounded it, and the right only looked better by comparison. His eyebrows, his beard, and the fringe of hair that outlined his bald head made an incongruous pale yellow pattern against the sunburnt darkness of his face. In his youth, Jacovik had been almost pathologically devoted to boxing--even to the point of picking fights with others in his village for no reason at all, except to fight. Twice, he had been brought up before The Chief's court because of the severe beating he had given to men bigger than he, and he had finally killed a man with his fists.  Chief Samas had given him Special Punishment for that, and a final warning that the next fight would be punished by death.  Anketam didn't know whether it was that threat, or the emotional reaction Jacovik had suffered from killing a man, or simply that he had had some sense beaten into his head, but from that moment on Jacovik was a different man. He had changed from a thug into a determined, ambitious man. In twenty-two years, he had not used his fists except to discipline one of his crew, and that had only happened four times that Anketam knew of. Jacovik had shown that he had ability as well as strength, that he could control men by words as well as by force, and The Chief had made him a supervisor. He had proved himself worthy of the job; next to Anketam, he was the best supervisor in the barony.  Anketam had a great deal of respect for the little, wide-shouldered, barrel-chested man who stood there looking at the scars on the backs of his hands.  Jacovik turned his hands over and looked at the calloused palms. \"How do we know? Maybe the Council of Chiefs has given up. Maybe they've authorized the President to surrender. After all, we're not fighters; we're farmers. The invaders outnumber us. They've got us cut off by a"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24180"],["title","Alarm Clock (#1)"],["body","one and running out to spend the pins quick, so's I can get in no traps.\"  He looked at Holme thoughtfully.  \"I just now think of something, kid. You can make yourself a nice bit, real easy. Don't cost hardly nothing to set up and there ain't much risk. You work more'n a year, learning all about tools, huh? They teach you all about making tools, huh?\"  \"Sure.\" Holme laughed shortly. \"Got to make all your own hand tools before you get through. Why?\"  Marlo grinned broadly.  \"I could tell you a lotta guys, need real special tools. Need tools you don't buy in no store, like maybe a good can opener a guy can carry easy. And they pay real good, you make what they want and keep your mouth shut.\" He rubbed his chin.  \"Nice,\" he went on. \"Real nice. And all you need is maybe a few tools you can buy anywhere. And maybe you gotta build up a little forge. Guy knew his way around, he could make a nice pile that way.\"  Stan looked at the man thoughtfully.  \"Sounds interesting,\" he broke in, \"but suppose they find some fabricator operator out in the woods, heating up metal instead of working on a regular job? They'd be curious, don't you think? Especially if the guy's already picked up a record.\"  \"Naw.\" Marlo turned toward him. \"So he's a graduate--who ain't? See, they show this guy up here, he's supposed to be a fabmeister. Only maybe he don't like punching keys. Maybe he don't like to chase them meters, huh? So maybe he'd rather use muscle hardware, see?\" He grinned.  \"Some guy sets himself up a shack up valley, see? Starts a fixit joint. Looks real legit. Even with muscle hardware, he can put out jobs faster'n them people can get parts from way down Talburg way, see.  \"And he gets in with the joes, too. They got their troubles getting things made up for 'em. So this guy gives them a hand. Even working cheap, he picks up some change there, too, and one way or another, the guy's got a living, see?\" He glanced back at Holme.  \"Only now and then, here comes a few guys in the back door, they want a special job, see, for real special pay. And there's your ice cream and cake. And maybe a little stack for later on.\"  \"I don't know.\" Stan picked up a book. \"I'd rather try playing 'em on the table for a while. It might beat getting flashed and dropped back in.\"  Big Carl shrugged and crawled back into his bunk.  \"Aagh, can happen to anybody,\" he said. \"Just keep this under your hair. Smart kids like you can make out pretty good, you just use your heads. Ain't nothing down Talburg way, though.\" He yawned.  \"Well, I've had it. Got into it with that Wanzor again, out on the pile. Give one of them joes a boost, he gets three meters high.\" He yawned again and turned toward the wall.         *       *       *       *       *  Stan flipped the pages of the book. He had still been unable to put his finger on the point at which Kellonia had ceased to be a planet of free citizens and become the planetary prison he had found himself on.  There had been no sudden change--no dramatic incident, such as the high spots in the history of his native Khloris. Here, things had just drifted from freedom to servitude, with the people dropping their rights as a man discards outworn clothing.  He leaned back, lowering the book. Kell's planet, he remembered, had been one of the first star colonies to be founded after the discovery of the interstellar drive. Settlers had flocked to get passage to the new, fertile world.  During the first three hundred years, people had spread over the planet, but the frontier stage had passed and the land of promise had stabilized, adopted laws, embraced the arts and sciences. One by one, frontier farms had given way to mechanized food-producing land, worked by trained technical teams and administered by professional management.  Kellonia had entered the age of industrialized culture, with the large individual owner a disappearing species.  Unnoticed and unregretted, the easy freedom of the frontier was discarded and lost. One by one, the rights enjoyed by the original settlers became regarded as privileges. One by one, the privileges were restricted, limited by license, eliminated as unsuitable or even dangerous to the new Kellonian culture.  Little by little, the large group became the individual of law and culture, with the single person becoming a mere cipher.  Members of groups--even members of the governing council itself--found themselves unable to make any but the most minor decisions. Precedent dictated each move. And precedent developed into iron-hard tradition.  In fact, Stan thought, the culture seemed now to be completely self-controlled--self-sustaining. The people were mere cells, who conformed--or were eliminated.  Again, he picked up the book, looking casually through its pages. Detail was unimportant here. There was, he realized with a feeling of frustration, only a sort of dull pattern, with no significant detail apparent.         *       *       *       *       *  He awoke a little groggily, looked around the cell, then jumped hastily out of his bunk. Usually he was awake before the bell rang.  Pete Karzer was coming back from the washstand. He looked over.  \"You up, Graham?\" he said in his whispery voice. \"Hey, you know I'm getting out this morning. Guess you'll want to swap blankets again, huh?\"  \"That's right, too. No use turning in a good blanket, is there?\"  \"Don't make sense.\" Pete massaged the back of his neck.  \"Never could figure that swap,\" he said. \"Don't get me wrong, it was real good, being able to sleep warm, but you caught me good when I tried to swipe that blanket of yours. Ain't never seen a guy move so quick. And I ain't so dumb I don't know when I'm licked.\" He grinned ruefully.  \"So I'm down, like I been hit with a singlejack. Then you go and hand over a good blanket for that beat thing I been using. How come?\"  Stan shrugged. \"I told you,\" he said. \"Where I come from, it's a lot colder than it is here, so I don't need a blanket. I'd have offered a swap sooner, but I didn't want to look like some greasy doormat.\"  \"Wasn't no grease about that swap.\" Pete grinned and rubbed his neck again. \"I found out real quick who was the big man. Where'd you learn that stuff anyway?\"  \"Oh, picked it up--here and there.\" Stan glanced down at the floor.  There would be no point in explaining the intensive close combat training he'd been put through at school. Such training would make no sense to his cellmates. To the good citizens of Kellonia, it would seem horrifyingly illegal. He glanced up again.  \"You know how it is,\" he went on. \"A guy learns as he goes.\"  Big Carl Marlo swung his legs over the side of his bunk.  \"Looks like you learned real good,\" he said. He examined Stan.  \"Pete tells me about this deal. I kinda miss the action this time, but Pete tells me he's got the blanket and he's all set to plug you good, you should maybe try a hassle.  \"Only all at once, you're on him. He feels a couple quick ones, then he don't know nothing till next day. You can maybe do things like that any time?\"  Stan shrugged. \"Guy never knows what he can do till he tries. I know a few other tricks, if that's what you mean.\"  Marlo nodded. \"Yeah. Know something, kid? Ain't no use you waste your time being no fabricator nurse. You got a good profesh already, know what I mean?\"  Stan looked at him questioningly.  \"Sure.\" Marlo nodded. \"So you come here, like maybe you're a tourist, see. But the joes get you and they bring you up here. Going to teach you a trade--fabricator nurse, see. Only they don't know it but you're one guy they don't have to teach, 'counta you got something better. All you gotta do is find your way around.\"  \"I have? Do you really think....\"  \"Sure. Look, there's a lot of antique big-timers around, see. These old guys figure they need some guy can push the mugs. Pay real good, too, and they couldn't care less you're a graduate. Maybe makes it even better, see. You get in with one of those old guys, you got it made. All legit, too. Oughta look into that, you get out.\"  Stan smiled. \"The first day I was on this planet, they went through my bags while I was out looking over the town. They found a paper knife and a couple of textbooks.\" He shrugged.  \"So I came back to the hotel and someone hit me with a flasher. I came to in a cell.\" He glanced around.  \"Somebody finally told me they'd given me two to five years for carrying a dangerous weapon and subversive literature. Now what would I get if I went out and really messed some guy up?\"  Marlo waved a hand carelessly.  \"Depends on who you work for,\" he declared. \"You got the right boss, you get a bonus. Worse the guy's gaffed, the bigger the payoff, see?\"  Stan reached for his bag of toilet articles.  \"That's legitimate?\"  \"Sure.\" Mario smiled expansively. \"Happens all the time. Even the big outfits need musclers. Staffmen, see? Sorta keep production up.  \"Lot of guys get real big jobs that way. Start out, they're Staff Assistance Specialists, like they roust the mugs when they got to. Then pretty quick, they're all dressed up fancy, running things. Real good deal.\" He shrugged.  \"Need a heavy man once in a while, even in my business. Like maybe some guy's got a good pad, he doesn't want a lot of prowlers shaking up the neighbors. You know, gets the law too close, and a guy can't work so good with a lot of joes hanging around. Might even decide to make a search, then where'd you be?\" He spread his hands.  \"But there's some Johnny Raw, keeps coming around. And maybe this is a pretty rough boy, you can't get on him personal, see. So the only answer, you get some good heavy guy to teach this ape some ethics. Lotta staffmen pick up extra pins this way.\"  \"I think I get the idea. But suppose the law gets into this deal?\"  Marlo spread his hands. \"Well, this is a civil case, see, so long as the chump don't turn in his ticket. So, anything comes up, you put an ambassador on the job. He talks to the determinators and the joes don't worry you none."]]]
