Now, my dear Watson, is it beyond the limits of human ingenuity to furnish an explanation which would cover both of these big facts?  If it were one which would also admit of the mysterious note with its very curious phraseology, why, then it would be worth accepting as a temporary hypothesis.  If the fresh facts which come to our knowledge all fit themselves into the scheme, then our hypothesis may gradually become a solution.\"  \"But what is our hypothesis?\"  Holmes leaned back in his chair with half-closed eyes.  \"You must admit, my dear Watson, that the idea of a joke is impossible. There were grave events afoot, as the sequel showed, and the coaxing of Scott Eccles to Wisteria Lodge had some connection with them.\"  \"But what possible connection?\"  \"Let us take it link by link.  There is, on the face of it, something unnatural about this strange and sudden friendship between the young Spaniard and Scott Eccles.  It was the former who forced the pace.  He called upon Eccles at the other end of London on the very day after he first met him, and he kept in close touch with him until he got him down to Esher.  Now, what did he want with Eccles?  What could Eccles supply?  I see no charm in the man.  He is not particularly intelligent--not a man likely to be congenial to a quick-witted Latin. Why, then, was he picked out from all the other people whom Garcia met as particularly suited to his purpose?  Has he any one outstanding quality?  I say that he has.  He is the very type of conventional British respectability, and the very man as a witness to impress another Briton.  You saw yourself how neither of the inspectors dreamed of questioning his statement, extraordinary as it was.\"  \"But what was he to witness?\"  \"Nothing, as things turned out, but everything had they gone another way.  That is how I read the matter.\"  \"I see, he might have proved an alibi.\"  \"Exactly, my dear Watson; he might have proved an alibi.  We will suppose, for argument's sake, that the household of Wisteria Lodge are confederates in some design.  The attempt, whatever it may be, is to come off, we will say, before one o'clock.  By some juggling of the clocks it is quite possible that they may have got Scott Eccles to bed earlier than he thought, but in any case it is likely that when Garcia went out of his way to tell him that it was one it was really not more than twelve.  If Garcia could do whatever he had to do and be back by the hour mentioned he had evidently a powerful reply to any accusation. Here was this irreproachable Englishman ready to swear in any court of law that the accused was in the house all the time.  It was an insurance against the worst.\"  \"Yes, yes, I see that.  But how about the disappearance of the others?\"  \"I have not all my facts yet, but I do not think there are any insuperable difficulties.  Still, it is an error to argue in front of your data.  You find yourself insensibly twisting them round to fit your theories.\"  \"And the message?\"  \"How did it run?  'Our own colours, green and white.'  Sounds like racing.  'Green open, white shut.'  That is clearly a signal.  'Main stair, first corridor, seventh right, green baize.'  This is an assignation.  We may find a jealous husband at the bottom of it all. It was clearly a dangerous quest.  She would not have said 'Godspeed' had it not been so.  'D'--that should be a guide.\"  \"The man was a Spaniard.  I suggest that 'D' stands for Dolores, a common female name in Spain.\"  \"Good, Watson, very good--but quite inadmissable.  A Spaniard would write to a Spaniard in Spanish.  The writer of this note is certainly English.  Well, we can only possess our soul in patience until this excellent inspector come back for us. Meanwhile we can thank our lucky fate which has rescued us for a few short hours from the insufferable fatigues of idleness.\"          *           *           *  An answer had arrived to Holmes's telegram before our Surrey officer had returned.  Holmes read it and was about to place it in his notebook when he caught a glimpse of my expectant face. He tossed it across with a laugh.  \"We are moving in exalted circles,\" said he.  The telegram was a list of names and addresses:  Lord Harringby, The Dingle; Sir George Ffolliott, Oxshott Towers; Mr. Hynes Hynes, J.P., Purdley Place; Mr. James Baker Williams, Forton Old Hall; Mr. Henderson, High Gable; Rev. Joshua Stone, Nether Walsling.  \"This is a very obvious way of limiting our field of operations,\" said Holmes.  \"No doubt Baynes, with his methodical mind, has already adopted some similar plan.\"  \"I don't quite understand.\"  \"Well, my dear fellow, we have already arrived at the conclusion that the message received by Garcia at dinner was an appointment or an assignation.  Now, if the obvious reading of it is correct, and in order to keep the tryst one has to ascend a main stair and seek the seventh door in a corridor, it is perfectly clear that the house is a very large one.  It is equally certain that this house cannot be more than a mile or two from Oxshott, since Garcia was walking in that direction and hoped, according to my reading of the facts, to be back in Wisteria Lodge in time to avail himself of an alibi, which would only be valid up to one o'clock.  As the number of large houses close to Oxshott must be limited, I adopted the obvious method of sending to the agents mentioned by Scott Eccles and obtaining a list of them. Here they are in this telegram, and the other end of our tangled skein must lie among them.\"          *           *           *  It was nearly six o'clock before we found ourselves in the pretty Surrey village of Esher, with Inspector Baynes as our companion.  Holmes and I had taken things for the night, and found comfortable quarters at the Bull.  Finally we set out in the company of the detective on our visit to Wisteria Lodge.  It was a cold, dark March evening, with a sharp wind and a fine rain beating upon our faces, a fit setting for the wild common over which our road passed and the tragic goal to which it led us.     2.  The Tiger of San Pedro   A cold and melancholy walk of a couple of miles brought us to a high wooden gate, which opened into a gloomy avenue of chestnuts. The curved and shadowed drive led us to a low, dark house, pitch-black against a slate-coloured sky. From the front window upon the left of the door there peeped a glimmer of a feeble light.  \"There's a constable in possession,\" said Baynes.  \"I'll knock at the window.\"  He stepped across the grass plot and tapped with his hand on the pane.  Through the fogged glass I dimly saw a man spring up from a chair beside the fire, and heard a sharp cry from within the room.  An instant later a white-faced, hard-breathing policeman had opened the door, the candle wavering in his trembling hand.  \"What's the matter, Walters?\" asked Baynes sharply.  The man mopped his forehead with his handkerchief and gave a long sigh of relief.  \"I am glad you have come, sir.  It has been a long evening, and I don't think my nerve is as good as it was.\"  \"Your nerve, Walters?  I should not have thought you had a nerve in your body.\"  \"Well, sir, it's this lonely, silent house and the queer thing in the kitchen.  Then when you tapped at the window I thought it had come again.\"  \"That what had come again?\"  \"The devil, sir, for all I know.  It was at the window.\"  \"What was at the window, and when?\"  \"It was just about two hours ago.  The light was just fading.  I was sitting reading in the chair.  I don't know what made me look up, but there was a face looking in at me through the lower pane. Lord, sir, what a face it was!  I'll see it in my dreams.\"  \"Tut, tut, Walters.  This is not talk for a police-constable.\"  \"I know, sir, I know; but it shook me, sir, and there's no use to deny it.  It wasn't black, sir, nor was it white, nor any colour that I know but a kind of queer shade like clay with a splash of milk in it.  Then there was the size of it--it was twice yours, sir.  And the look of it--the great staring goggle eyes, and the line of white teeth like a hungry beast.  I tell you, sir, I couldn't move a finger, nor get my breath, till it whisked away and was gone.  Out I ran and through the shrubbery, but thank God there was no one there.\"  \"If I didn't know you were a good man, Walters, I should put a black mark against you for this.  If it were the devil himself a constable on duty should never thank God that he could not lay his hands upon him. I suppose the whole thing is not a vision and a touch of nerves?\"  \"That, at least, is very easily settled,\" said Holmes, lighting his little pocket lantern.  \"Yes,\" he reported, after a short examination of the grass bed, \"a number twelve shoe, I should say.  If he was all on the same scale as his foot he must certainly have been a giant.\"  \"What became of him?\"  \"He seems to have broken through the shrubbery and made for the road.\"  \"Well,\" said the inspector with a grave and thoughtful face, \"whoever he may have been, and whatever he may have wanted, he's gone for the present, and we have more immediate things to attend to.  Now, Mr. Holmes, with your permission, I will show you round the house.\"  The various bedrooms and sitting-rooms had yielded nothing to a careful search.  Apparently the tenants had brought little or nothing with them, and all the furniture down to the smallest details had been taken over with the house.  A good deal of clothing with the stamp of Marx and Co., High Holborn, had been left behind.  Telegraphic inquiries had been already made which showed that Marx knew nothing of his customer save that he was a good payer.  Odds and ends, some pipes, a few novels, two of them in Spanish, an old-fashioned pinfire revolver, and a guitar were among the personal property.  \"Nothing in all this,\" said Baynes, stalking, candle in hand, from room to room.  \"But now, Mr. Holmes, I"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23430"],["title","Rollo in Rome (#1)"],["body","in going across the Pontine Marshes.\"  \"Must we keep awake?\" asked Rollo.  \"So they say,\" replied Mr. George. \"They say you are more likely to catch the fever while you are asleep than while you are awake.\"  \"I don't see why we should be,\" said Rollo.  \"Nor do I,\" said Mr. George.  If Mr. George really did not know or understand a thing, he never pretended to know or understand it.  \"It may be a mere notion,\" said Mr. George, \"but it is a very prevailing one, at any rate; so I thought it would be well enough for us to have something to keep us awake.\"  \"We will take some bread and butter too,\" said Rollo.  Mr. George said that that would be an excellent plan. So they each of them cut one of the breakfast rolls which were on the table in two, and after spreading the inside surfaces well with butter, they put the parts together again. The waiter brought them a quantity of clean wrapping paper, and with this they wrapped up both the chicken and the rolls, and Rollo put the three parcels into his bag.  \"And now,\" said Rollo, \"what are we to do for drink?\"  \"We might take some oranges,\" suggested Mr. George.  \"So we will,\" said Rollo. \"I will go out into the square and buy some.\"  Rollo, accordingly, went out into the square, and for what was equivalent to three cents of American money he bought six oranges. He put the oranges into his pockets, and returned to the hotel.  He found Mr. George filling a flat bottle with coffee. He had poured some coffee out of the coffee pot into the pitcher of hot milk, which had still a considerable quantity of hot milk remaining in it, and then, after putting some sugar into it, and waiting for the sugar to dissolve, he had commenced pouring it into the flat bottle.  [Illustration: PREPARING FOR THE JOURNEY.]  \"We may like a little coffee too,\" said Mr. George, \"as well as the oranges. We can drink it out of my drinking cup.\"  Rollo put his oranges into Mr. George's bag, for his own bag was now full. When all was ready, and the hotel bill was paid, Mr. George and Rollo got into a carriage which the waiter had sent for to come to the door, and set off for the diligence office. It was only half past seven when they arrived there. Rollo saw what time it was by the great clock which was put up on the front of one of the buildings towards the court yard.  \"We are too early by half an hour,\" said Rollo.  \"Yes,\" said Mr. George, \"in travelling over new ground we must always plan to be too early, or we run great risk of being too late.\"  \"Never mind,\" said Rollo, \"I am glad that we are here before the time, for now I can go around and see the other diligences getting ready to go off.\"  So Rollo began to walk about under the portico, or piazza, to the various diligences which were getting ready to set out on the different roads. There was one where there was a gentleman and two ladies who were quite in trouble. I suppose that among the girls who may read this book there may be many who may think that it must necessarily be a very agreeable thing to travel about Europe, and that if they could only go,--no matter under what circumstances,--they should experience an almost uninterrupted succession of pleasing sensations. But the truth is, that travelling in Europe, like every other earthly source of pleasure, is very far from being sufficient of itself to confer happiness. Indeed, under almost all the ordinary circumstances in which parties of travellers are placed, the question whether they are to enjoy themselves and be happy on any particular day of their journey, or to be discontented and miserable, depends so much upon little things which they did not at all take into the account, or even foresee at all in planning the journey, that it is wholly uncertain when you look upon a party of travellers that you meet on the road, whether they are really having a good time or not. You cannot tell at all by the outward circumstances.  There was a striking illustration of this in the case of the party that attracted Rollo's attention in the court of the diligence office. The gentleman's name was Howland. One of the ladies was his young wife, and the other lady was her sister. The sister's name was Louise. Mr. Howland intended to have taken the whole _coupé_ for his party; but when he went to the office, the day before, to take the places, he found that one of the seats of the _coupé_ had been engaged by a gentleman who was travelling alone.  \"How unlucky!\" said Mr. Howland to himself. \"We must have three seats, and it won't do for us to be shut up in the interior, for there we cannot see the scenery at all.\"  So he went home, and asked his wife what it would be best to do. \"We cannot have three seats together,\" said he, \"unless we go up upon the _banquette_.\"  But the bride said that she could not possibly ride on the _banquette_. She could not climb up to such a high place.  Now, Mrs. Howland's real reason for not being willing to ride on the banquette, was not the difficulty of climbing up, for at all the diligence offices they have convenient step ladders for the use of the passengers in getting up and down. The real reason was, she thought it was not genteel to ride there. And in fact it is not genteel. There is no part of the diligence where people who attach much importance to the fashion of the thing are willing to go, except the coupé.  \"And we don't want to ride in the interior,\" said Mr. Howland.  \"No,\" said the bride, \"that is worse than the banquette.\"  \"Nor to wait till another day,\" added Mr. Howland.  \"No,\" said Mrs. Howland. \"We must go to-morrow, and we must have the _coupé_. The gentleman who has engaged the third seat will give it up to us, I am sure, when he knows that it is to oblige a lady. You can engage the two seats in the coupé, and one more, either on the banquette or in the interior, and then when the time comes to set out we will get the gentleman to let us have his seat. You can pay him the difference.\"  \"But, Angelina,\" said Mr. Howland, \"I should not like to ask such a thing of the gentleman. He has taken pains to go a day or two beforehand to engage his seat, so as to make sure of a good one, and I don't think we ought to expect him to give it up to accommodate strangers.\"  \"O, he won't mind,\" said Mrs. Howland. \"He would as lief change as not. And if he won't, we can arrange it in some way or other.\"  So Mr. Howland engaged the two places in the coupé, and one on the banquette. When the morning came, he brought his two ladies to the diligence station in good season. He was very unwilling to ask the gentleman to give up his seat; but his wife, who was a good deal accustomed to have her own way, and who, besides, being now a bride, considered herself specially entitled to indulgences, declared that if her husband did not ask the gentleman, she would ask him herself.  \"Very well,\" said Mr. Howland, \"I will ask him then.\"  So Mr. Howland went to the gentleman, and asked him. He was standing at the time, with his umbrella and walking stick in his hand, near one of the pillars of the portico, smoking a cigar. He looked at Mr. Howland with an expression of some surprise upon his countenance on hearing the proposition, took one or two puffs from his cigar before replying, and then said quietly that he preferred the seat that he had taken in the coupé.  \"It would be a very great favor to us, if you would exchange with us,\" said Mrs. Howland, who had come up with her husband, and stood near. \"We are three, and we want very much to be seated together. We will very gladly pay the difference of the fare.\"  The gentleman immediately, on being thus addressed by Mrs. Howland, took the cigar out of his mouth, raised his hat, and bowed very politely.  \"Are you and this other lady the gentleman's party?\" he asked.  \"Yes, sir,\" said Mrs. Howland.  \"Then I cannot possibly think of giving up my seat in the coupé,\" replied the gentleman. \"I am a Russian, it is true, but I am not a bear, as I should very justly be considered, if I were to leave a compartment in the coach when _two_ such beautiful ladies as you were coming into it, especially under the influence of any such consideration as that of saving the difference in the fare.\"  The gentleman said this in so frank and good-natured a way that it was impossible to take offence at it, though Mr. Howland felt, that by making the request and receiving such a reply, he had placed himself in a very ridiculous position.  \"I prize my seat more than ever,\" said the Russian, still addressing the ladies; \"I prize it incalculably, and so I cannot think of going up upon the banquette. But if the gentleman will go up there, I will promise to take the very best care of the ladies possible, while they are in the coupé.\"  Mrs. Howland then took Louise aside, and asked, in a whisper, whether she should have any objection to ride in the interior, in case Mr. Howland could exchange the place on the banquette for one within. Louise was quite troubled that her sister should make such a proposal. She said she should not like very well to go in there among so many strangers, and in a place, too, where she could not see the scenery at all. Besides, Louise thought that it would have been more generous in Angelina, if she thought it necessary for one or the other of them to ride inside, to have offered to take a seat there herself, instead of putting it off upon her sister, especially since it was not so proper, she thought, for her, being a young lady, to ride among strangers, as for one who was married.  Mr. Howland then suggested that they should all ascend to the banquette. The persons who had the other two seats there would of course be willing to change for the coupé; or at least, since the coupé was considered the best place, there would be no indelicacy in asking them to do it.  But the bride would not listen to this proposal. She never could climb up there, in the world, she said.  By this time the coach was ready, and the conductor began to call"]]]
