There was, indeed, no fear of that, for as the schooner approached the islands, numerous openings were observed.  It also became evident that the gentlemen had mistaken the distance from the broken water, for they were much longer of reaching the outer skerries than they had expected, and the foam, which at first appeared like a white line, soon grew into immense masses, which thundered on these weather-worn rocks with a deep, loud, continuous roar, and burst upwards in great spouts like white steam many yards into the air.  \"Captain, are the islands as numerous everywhere along the coast as they are here?\" said Fred.  \"'Deed ay, an' more,\" answered the Captain, \"some places ye'll sail for fifty or sixty miles after getting among the skerries before reachin' the main.\"  They were now within a hundred yards of the islands, towards a narrow channel, between two of which the Captain steered.  Every one was silent, for there was something awful in the aspect of the great dark waves of the raging sea, as they rolled heavily forward and fell with crash after crash in terrific fury on the rocks, dashing themselves to pieces and churning the water into foam, so that the whole sea resembled milk.  To those who were unaccustomed to the coast, it seemed as if the schooner were leaping forward to certain destruction; but they knew that a sure hand was at the helm, and thought not of the danger but the sublimity of the scene.  \"Stand by the weather-braces,\" cried McNab.  The schooner leaped as he spoke into the turmoil of roaring spray.  In ten seconds she was through the passage, and there was a sudden and almost total cessation of heaving motion.  The line of islands formed a perfect breakwater, and not a wave was formed, even by the roaring gale, bigger than those we find on such occasions in an ordinary harbour.  As isle after isle was passed the sea became more and more smooth, and, although the surface was torn up and covered with foam, no great rollers heaved the vessel about.  The tight little craft still bent over to the blast, but she cut through perfectly flat water now.  A delightful feeling of having come to the end of a rough voyage filled the hearts of all on board.  Sam Sorrel raised his head, and began to look less yellow and more cheerful.  Tittles began to wag the stump of his miserable tail, and, in short, every one began to look and to feel happy.  Thus did the _Snowflake_ approach the coast of Norway.  Now, it is by no means an uncommon occurrence in this world that a calm should follow close on the heels of a storm.  Soon after the _Snowflake_ had entered the islands the storm began to abate, as if it felt that there was no chance of overwhelming the little yacht now.  That night, and the greater part of the following day, a dead calm prevailed, and the schooner lay among the islands with her sails flapping idly from the yards.  A little after midnight all on board were asleep, save the man at the helm and Captain McNab, who seemed to be capable of existing without sleep for any length of time when occasion required.  The schooner now lay in a latitude so far north that the light of the sun never quite left the sky in clear weather.  A sweet soft twilight rested on the rocky islands and on the sea, and no sound disturbed the stillness except the creaking of the yards or the cries of seamews.  Yes, by the way, there was another sound.  It proceeded from the cabin where our three friends lay sleeping on the sofas.  The sound was that of snoring, and it issued from the wide-open mouth of Sam Sorrel, who lay sprawling on his back, with Tittles coiled up at his feet.  It is probable that Sam would have snored on for hours, but for a piece of carelessness on his part.  Just before going to rest he had placed a tin can of water close to his head in such a way that it was balanced on the edge of a shelf.  A slight roll of the schooner, caused by the entrance of a wave through an opening in the islands, toppled this can over and emptied its contents on the sleeper's face.  He leaped up with a roar, of course.  Tittles jumped up with a yelp, while Grant and Temple turned round with a growl at having been awakened, and went off to sleep again.  But sleep was driven away from the eyes of Sam Sorrel.  He made one or two efforts to woo it back in vain, so in despair he jumped up, put his sketch-book in his pocket, seized a double-barrelled fowling-piece, and went on deck, followed by Tittles.  The little boat was floating under the quarter, and a great mountainous island lay close off the starboard bow.  Getting into the boat, Sam rowed to the island, and was soon clambering up the heights with the activity of a squirrel.  Sam paused now and then to gaze with admiration on the magnificent scene that lay spread out far below him; the innumerable islands, the calm water bathed in the soft light of early morning, and the schooner floating just under his feet like a little speck or a sea-gull on the calm sea.  Pulling out his book and pencil, he sat down on a rock and began to draw.  Suddenly the artist was startled by the sound of a heavy pair of wings overhead.  Thousands of seagulls flew above him, filling the air with their wild cries, but Sam did not think it possible that they could cause the sound which he had, heard.  While he was still in doubt an enormous eagle sailed majestically past him.  It evidently had not seen him, and he sat quite still, scarce daring to draw his breath.  In a moment the gigantic bird sailed round the edge of a precipitous cliff, and was gone.  Sam at once rose and hurried forward with his gun.  He was much excited, for eagles are very difficult to approach--they are so shy and wary. Few men who go to Norway ever get the chance of a shot at the king of birds.  Judge, then, of the state of Sam Sorrel's mind when, on turning a corner of rock, he suddenly beheld the eagle standing on the edge of a great precipice about a hundred yards in advance of him.  But his hopes were much cast down when he observed that between him and the eagle there was a space of open ground, so that he could not creep farther forward without being seen.  How was he to advance?  What was he to do?  Such a chance might not occur again during the whole voyage.  No time was to be lost, so he resolved to make a rush forward and get as near as possible before the bird should take to flight.  No sooner thought than done.  He rushed down the mountain-side like a madman.  The eagle sprang up in alarm just as he reached the side of a rounded rock.  Halting suddenly, he took aim, and fired both barrels. The eagle gave a toss of its head and a twirl of its tail, and, sailing slowly away round a neighbouring cliff, disappeared from view.  A deep groan burst from the poor artist as he exclaimed, \"Oh dear, I've missed it!\"  But Sam was wrong.  He had _not_ missed it.  On climbing to the other side of the cliff he found the eagle stretched on the ground in a dying state.  Its noble-looking eye scowled for a moment on him as he came up, then the head drooped forward and the bird died.  It measured six feet four inches from tip to tip of its expanded wings, and was as magnificent a specimen of the golden eagle as one could wish to see.  With a triumphant step Sam carried it down to the yacht, where he found his comrades still sound asleep; so he quietly fastened the eagle up over Grant's bed, with the wings expanded and the hooked beak close to the sleeper's nose!  The day that followed this event continued calm, but towards evening a light breeze sprang up, and before midnight the _Snowflake_ cast anchor in the harbour of Bergen.    CHAPTER THREE.  BERGEN--TALKING, SUPPING, AND SLEEPING UNDER DIFFICULTIES.  The city of Bergen is a famous and a strange old place.  In ancient days it was a stronghold of the Vikings--those notorious sea-warriors who were little better than pirates, and who issued from among the dark mountains of Norway in their great uncouth galleys and swept across the seas, landing on the coasts everywhere, to the terror of surrounding nations.  They were a bold, fearless set, the Norse Vikings of old.  They voyaged far and wide in open boats round the coasts of Europe, and across the stormy sea, long before the mariner's compass was invented, and they discovered Iceland and America long before Christopher Columbus was born.  They had free spirits, these fierce Norwegians of old, and there was much good as well as evil in them.  They had good and wise laws when nearly all the rest of the world was lawless; and many of the laws and customs which prevailed among them a thousand years ago exist at the present day.  The bold Vikings were great colonisers; among other parts of the world they overran and settled in a large portion of Great Britain, and much of their blood--more than many people are aware of-- flows in our own veins.  But I am wandering from my subject.  Let me return to it by repeating that Bergen, this ancient stronghold of the Vikings, is a famous and a strange old place.  It is built at the foot of a steep mountain-range which is so close to the margin of the sea that the city has barely room to stand.  One might fancy that the houses were crowding and jostling each other and squeezing themselves together, in order to avoid on the one hand being pushed up the mountain-side, and, on the other hand, being thrust into the sea.  Some of the smaller cottages and a few villas seem to have been beaten in this struggle for standing-room, for they appear to have been obliged to clamber up the mountain-side, and perch themselves on spots where there"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23263"],["title","The Fugitives: The Tyrant Queen of Madagascar (#1)"],["body","bounding and crashing into the gulf below.  Instantly the faces of the two men gleamed with intelligence; they nodded with energy, grinned with satisfaction, and pointed to the abyss in front of them with the air of men who had no doubt that their enemies were lying down there in quivering fragments.  Something of this James Ginger did indeed manage to see.  Curiosity was so powerfully developed in that sable spirit, that, at the imminent risk of his life, he reached out by means of a branch, and so elongated his black neck that he got one of his brilliant eyes to bear for a moment upon his foes.  He appreciated the situation instantly, and drew back to indulge in a smothered laugh which shut up both his eyes and appeared to gash his face from ear to ear.  \"What's wrong with you, Ebony?\" whispered Mark Breezy, who was in anything but a laughing mood just then.  \"Oh! nuffin', nuffin', massa; only dem brown niggers are sitch asses dat dey b'lieve a'most anyting.  Black niggers ain't so easy putt off de scent.  Dey tinks we's tumble ober de precipis an' busted ourselbes.\"  \"Lucky for us that they think so,\" said Hockins, in a soft tone of satisfaction.  \"But now, what are we to do?  It was bad enough clamberin' up here in blazin' excitement to save our lives, but it will be ten times worse gettin' down again in cold blood when they're gone.\"  \"Time enough to consider that when they _are_ gone,\" muttered Breezy. \"Hush!  Listen!\"  The sounds that reached their place of concealment told clearly enough that a number of the savages had descended the cliffs, presumably to look at the place over which the white men had fallen.  Then there was much eager conversation in an unknown tongue, mingled with occasional bursts of laughter--on hearing which latter the huge mouth of our negro enlarged in silent sympathy.  After a while the voices were heard to retire up the narrow track and become fainter until they died away altogether, leaving no sound save the murmur of the rushing river to fill the ears of the anxious listeners who stood like three statues in a niche on the face of that mighty precipice.  \"Now, you know,\" said Breezy, with a sigh of relief, \"this is very satisfactory as far as it goes, and we have reason to be thankful that we are neither speared nor dashed to pieces; nevertheless, we are in an uncomfortable fix here, for night is approaching, and we must retrace our steps somehow or other, unless we make up our minds to sleep standing.\"  \"That's so, doctor.  There's not room to lie down here,\" assented the sailor, glancing slowly round; \"an', to tell 'ee the plain truth, I feel as funky about trustin' myself again to that serpent-like creeper as I felt the first time I went up through the lubber-hole the year I went to sea.\"  \"What you's 'fraid ob, Mr 'Ockins?\" asked Ebony.  \"Afraid o' the nasty thing givin' way under my weight.  If it was a good stout rope, now, I wouldn't mind, but every crack it gave when I was comin' aloft made my heart jump a'most out o' my mouth.\"  \"What have 'ee found there, doctor?\" asked the seaman, on observing that his companion was groping behind a mass of herbage at the back part of the niche in which they stood.  \"There's a big hole here, Hockins.  Perhaps we may find room to stay where we are, after all, till morning.  Come here, Ebony, you've got something of the eel about you.  Try if you can wriggle in.\"  The negro at once thrust his head and shoulders into the hole, but could not advance.  \"Bery strange!\" he said, drawing out his head, and snorting once or twice like a dog that has half-choked himself in a rabbit-hole.  \"Seems to me dere's a big block o' wood dere stoppin' de way.\"  \"Strange indeed, Ebony.  A block of wood could not have grown there. Are you sure it is not a big root?\"  \"Sartin' sure, massa.  I hab studied roots since I was a babby.  Hold on, I try again.\"  The negro tried again, and with such vigour that he not only displaced the block of wood, but burst in several planks which concealed the entrance to a cavern.  They fell on the stone floor with a crash that aroused a multitude of echoes in the dark interior.  At the same moment something like a faint shriek or wail was heard within, causing the hearts of the three listeners to beat faster.  \"Did you hear that, Hockins?\"  \"Ay, I heard it sure enough.  What is it, think 'ee, lad!\" said the seaman to the negro.  Ebony, who was gazing into the dark cavern with glaring eyeballs and distended nostrils, replied--  \"My advice to you is, let's go back de way we come.  Dis no place for 'spectable Christians.\"  \"Do you fear ghosts?\" asked Mark, smiling, yet at the same time bringing his gun into a convenient position, with his finger ready on the trigger.  \"I fears nuffin,\" returned the negro with a proud look, while beads of perspiration stood on his brow.  \"Then ye're a braver man than I am, Ebony, for I fear that climbin' plant worse than a ghost; so here goes to find out what it is.\"  Although the sailor spoke thus boldly, and tried to look cool, it is certain that he also was afflicted with sensations of an unusual description, which, of course, he would have scorned to admit were the result of fear!  His power of will, however, was stronger than his fears.  Drawing his cutlass, he was about to enter the cavern, when Mark laid a hand on his shoulder.  \"Come, Hockins, you have accepted my lead hitherto.  It is not fair to take it out of my hands at this critical point.\"  So saying he glided past his comrade, and was almost lost to sight immediately in the deep gloom.  \"Softly, softly, doctor,\" whispered the seaman, as he followed, \"there may be holes or pits within--\"  \"All right; I'm feeling my way carefully.  Keep close.\"  As he spoke a slight, indescribable sound was heard--almost like a sigh.  \"Hist!  Did 'ee hear that?\" said Hockins in the lowest possible whisper.  \"Oh! massa, let's go back de way we come,\" urged Ebony, in the same low but earnest tone.  Mark Breezy did not reply, but the click of his gun as he cocked it showed that he was on the alert.  For nearly a minute the three men stood in absolute silence, listening for a repetition of the mysterious sound, and, though it did not recur, there was an indescribable feeling in the heart of each that they were not alone in that cavern.  \"Have you not flint and steel?\" asked Mark.  \"Yes; but to strike a light would only show our whereabouts if there _is_ any one here.\"  The seaman accidentally touched Ebony on the elbow as he spoke, and sent that worthy's heart, or something like it, into his throat with such violence as nearly to choke him.  \"Git along, massa,\" he said in a gaspy whisper, when able to articulate, \"we's got to go troo wid it _now_.\"  Acting on this advice the young man continued to advance cautiously, feeling his way step by step and fully expecting every moment to reach the inner wall of the cavern.  Presently the explorers were again brought to a stand by the sudden appearance of a light in the far distance.  As, however, it did not move, they continued to advance, and soon were convinced that it was daylight shining through an opening in that direction.  Every step convinced them more and more that they were right, and their spirits rose with the hope of escaping, though the light made no appreciable difference as yet in the darkness that surrounded them.  Suddenly a sharp, loud, short cry filled the cavern for an instant, and almost froze their blood!  The loudness and abrupt stoppage of the cry left the impression that the creature which uttered it had been suddenly and effectively killed, for it ended in a sharp gasp or gurgle, and then all was still,--but only for a moment, for the shock to Mark's nerves was such that his finger inadvertently pressed the trigger of his gun, which exploded with a deafening crash, and awoke shrieks and cries that were not to be accounted for by mere echoes.  This was too much for ordinary human beings.  Fabled knights of old in armour of proof might have stood it, but the two white men and the black, being ordinary heroes, regardless of pride and honour, went in for a regular stampede, and it is but simple justice to say that Ebony won, for he reached the outlet of the cavern first, and sprang through it into daylight like a black thunderbolt.  It is also due to his comrades to add that they were not far behind him.  Their courage, however, was soon restored.  Daylight has a celebrated power of restoring courage.  On clearing the bushes which concealed the entrance to the cave they simultaneously stopped, turned round, and resolutely faced their foe!  But no foe was to be seen!  Once again all was still as death.  After glaring for a few seconds at the spot whence the expected enemy should have issued, the three fugitives relaxed their frowning brows and turned inquiring eyes on each other.  \"Dis beats cockfightin' a'most,\" said Ebony, with a sigh of intense relief.  \"Ay, an' every other sort o' fightin' as I ever heard on,\" responded Hockins.  \"Come, friends,\" said their young leader, \"whatever it may have been, it behoves us to get as far away from this spot as possible, and that as fast as we can.\"    CHAPTER TWO.  HARKS BACK A LITTLE.  The spot where our adventurers found themselves on issuing from the mysterious cave was a peculiarly rugged one.  It formed a sort of hollow or depression in the forest-land, in which we introduced the three men as fugitives.  From this hollow there descended a narrow track or pathway to the extensive valley which had been seen from the summit of the precipice that barred their flight, and had so nearly proved fatal.  So confused was the nature of the ground here, and so intricate were the tracks--originally formed no doubt by wild animals, though made use of by wandering men--that it became impossible for Mark Breezy to know in what direction he was leading his comrades as he wound in and out among large rocks and fallen trees.  In fact it was more by"]]]
