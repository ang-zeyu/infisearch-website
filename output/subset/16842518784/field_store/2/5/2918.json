The Turks soon renounced their ancestral paganism for Islam, but Islam made little change in their natures. In judging these Turkish newcomers we must not consider them the same as the present-day Ottoman Turks of Constantinople and Asia Minor. The modern Osmanli are so saturated with European and Near Eastern blood, and have been so leavened by Western and Saracenic ideas, they that are a very different people from their remote immigrant ancestors. Yet, even as it is, the modern Osmanli display enough of those unlovely Turanian traits which characterize the unmodified Turks of central Asia, often called \"Turkomans,\" to distinguish them from their Ottoman kinsfolk to the west.  Now, what was the primitive Turkish nature? First and foremost, it was that of the professional soldier. Discipline was the Turk's watchword. No originality of thought, and but little curiosity. Few ideas ever penetrated the Turk's slow mind, and the few that did penetrate were received as military orders, to be obeyed without question and adhered to without reflection. Such was the being who took over the leadership of Islam from the Saracen's failing grasp.  No greater misfortune could have occurred both for Islam and for the world at large. For Islam it meant the rule of dull-witted bigots under which enlightened progress was impossible. Of course Islam did gain a great accession of warlike strength, but this new power was so wantonly misused as to bring down disastrous repercussions upon Islam itself. The first notable exploits of the immigrant Turkish hordes were their conquest of Asia Minor and their capture of Jerusalem, both events taking place toward the close of the eleventh century[4]. Up to this time Asia Minor had remained part of the Christian world. The original Arab flood of the seventh century, after overrunning Syria, had been stopped by the barrier of the Taurus Mountains; the Byzantine Empire had pulled itself together; and thenceforth, despite border bickerings, the Byzantine-Saracen frontier had remained substantially unaltered. Now, however, the Turks broke the Byzantine barrier, overran Asia Minor, and threatened even Constantinople, the eastern bulwark of Christendom. As for Jerusalem, it had, of course, been in Moslem hands since the Arab conquest of A.D. 637, but the caliph Omar had carefully respected the Christian \"Holy Places,\" and his successors had neither persecuted the local Christians nor maltreated the numerous pilgrims who flocked perennially to Jerusalem from every part of the Christian world. But the Turks changed all this. Avid for loot, and filled with bigoted hatred of the \"Misbelievers,\" they sacked the holy places, persecuted the Christians, and rendered pilgrimage impossible.  The effect of these twin disasters upon Christendom, occurring as they did almost simultaneously, was tremendous. The Christian West, then at the height of its religious fervour, quivered with mingled fear and wrath. Myriads of zealots, like Peter the Hermit, roused all Europe to frenzy. Fanaticism begat fanaticism, and the Christian West poured upon the Moslem East vast hosts of warriors in those extraordinary expeditions, the Crusades.  The Turkish conquest of Islam and its counterblast, the Crusades, were an immense misfortune for the world. They permanently worsened the relations between East and West. In the year A.D. 1000 Christian-Moslem relations were fairly good, and showed every prospect of becoming better. The hatreds engendered by Islam's first irruption were dying away. The frontiers of Islam and Christendom had become apparently fixed, and neither side showed much desire to encroach upon the other. The only serious debatable ground was Spain, where Moslem and Christian were continually at hand-grips; but, after all, Spain was mutually regarded as a frontier episode. Between Islam and Christendom, as a whole, intercourse was becoming steadily more friendly and more frequent. This friendly intercourse, if continued, might ultimately have produced momentous results for human progress. The Moslem world was at that time still well ahead of western Europe in knowledge and culture, but Saracenic civilization was ossifying, whereas the Christian West, despite its ignorance, rudeness, and barbarism, was bursting with lusty life and patently aspiring to better things. Had the nascent amity of East and West in the eleventh century continued to develop, both would have greatly profited. In the West the influence of Saracenic culture, containing, as it did, the ancient learning of Greece and Rome, might have awakened our Renaissance much earlier, while in the East the influence of the mediæval West, with its abounding vigour, might have saved Moslem civilization from the creeping paralysis which was overtaking it.  But it was not to be. In Islam the refined, easygoing Saracen gave place to the bigoted, brutal Turk. Islam became once more aggressive--not, as in its early days, for an ideal, but for sheer blood-lust, plunder, and destruction. Henceforth it was war to the knife between the only possible civilization and the most brutal and hopeless barbarism. Furthermore, this war was destined to last for centuries. The Crusades were merely Western counter-attacks against a Turkish assault on Christendom which continued for six hundred years and was definitely broken only under the walls of Vienna in 1683. Naturally, from these centuries of unrelenting strife furious hatreds and fanaticisms were engendered which still envenom the relations of Islam and Christendom. The atrocities of Mustapha Kemal's Turkish \"Nationalists\" and the atrocities of the Greek troops in Asia Minor, of which we read in our morning papers, are in no small degree a \"carrying on\" of the mutual atrocities of Turks and Crusaders in Palestine eight hundred years ago.  With the details of those old wars between Turks and Christians this book has no direct concern. The wars themselves should simply be noted as a chronic barrier between East and West. As for the Moslem East, with its declining Saracenic civilization bowed beneath the brutal Turkish yoke, it was presently exposed to even more terrible misfortunes. These misfortunes were also of Turanian origin. Toward the close of the twelfth century the eastern branches of the Turanian race were welded into a temporary unity by the genius of a mighty chieftain named Jenghiz Khan. Taking the sinister title of \"The Inflexible Emperor,\" this arch-savage started out to loot the world. He first overran northern China, which he hideously ravaged, then turned his devastating course toward the west. Such was the rise of the terrible \"Mongols,\" whose name still stinks in the nostrils of civilized mankind. Carrying with them skilled Chinese engineers using gunpowder for the reduction of fortified cities, Jenghiz Khan and his mounted hosts proved everywhere irresistible. The Mongols were the most appalling barbarians whom the world has ever seen. Their object was not conquest for settlement, not even loot, but in great part a sheer satanic lust for blood and destruction. They revelled in butchering whole populations, destroying cities, laying waste countrysides--and then passing on to fresh fields.  Jenghiz Khan died after a few years of his westward progress, but his successors continued his work with unabated zeal. Both Christendom and Islam were smitten by the Mongol scourge. All eastern Europe was ravaged and re-barbarized, the Russians showing ugly traces of the Mongol imprint to this day. But the woes of Christendom were as nothing to the woes of Islam. The Mongols never penetrated beyond Poland, and western Europe, the seat of Western civilization, was left unscathed. Not so Islam. Pouring down from the north-east, the Mongol hosts whirled like a cyclone over the Moslem world from India to Egypt, pillaging, murdering, and destroying. The nascent civilization of mediæval Persia, just struggling into the light beneath the incubus of Turkish harryings, was stamped flat under the Mongol hoofs, and the Mongols then proceeded to deal with the Moslem culture-centre--Bagdad. Bagdad had declined considerably from the gorgeous days of Haroun-al-Rashid, with its legendary million souls. However, it was still a great city, the seat of the caliphate and the unquestioned centre of Saracenic civilization. The Mongols stormed it (A.D. 1258), butchered its entire population, and literally wiped Bagdad off the face of the earth. And even this was not the worst. Bagdad was the capital of Mesopotamia. This \"Land between the Rivers\" had, in the very dawn of history, been reclaimed from swamp and desert by the patient labours of half-forgotten peoples who, with infinite toil, built up a marvellous system of irrigation that made Mesopotamia the perennial garden and granary of the world. Ages had passed and Mesopotamia had known many masters, but all these conquerors had respected, even cherished, the irrigation works which were the source of all prosperity. These works the Mongols wantonly, methodically destroyed. The oldest civilization in the world, the cradle of human culture, was hopelessly ruined; at least eight thousand years of continuous human effort went for naught, and Mesopotamia became the noisome land it still remains to-day, parched during the droughts of low water, soaked to fever-stricken marsh in the season of river-floods, tenanted only by a few mongrel fellahs inhabiting wretched mud villages, and cowed by nomad Bedouin browsing their flocks on the sites of ancient fields.  The destruction of Bagdad was a fatal blow to Saracenic civilization, especially in the East. And even before that dreadful disaster it had received a terrible blow in the West. Traversing North Africa in its early days, Islam had taken firm root in Spain, and had so flourished there that Spanish Moslem culture was fully abreast of that"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24108"],["title","Fables in Rhyme for Little Folks (#1)"],["body","try to talk the louder-- Bragging about his skill, and strength, and cunning. \"Pooh!\" said the Fox. \"You ought to see me running. Besides, I have a hundred tricks. You Cat, you! What can you do when Mr. Dog comes at you?\" \"To tell the truth,\" the Cat said, \"though it grieve me I've but one trick. Yet that's enough--believe me!\"  There came a pack of fox-hounds--yelping, baying. \"Pardon me\", said the Cat. \"I can't be staying. This is my trick.\" And up a tree he scurried, Leaving the Fox below a trifle worried.  In vain he tried his hundred tricks and ruses (The sort of thing that Mr. Dog confuses)-- Doubling, and seeking one hole, then another-- Smoked out of each until he thought he'd smother. At last as he once more came out of cover, Two nimble dogs pounced on him--All was over!    The Hen With The Golden Eggs.  To this lesson in greed, Pray, little ones, heed:  Each day, we are told, A most wonderful Hen Laid an egg made of gold For this meanest of men.  So greedy was he, He was not satisfied. \"What is one egg to me? I want all that' inside!\"  He cut off her head, And began to explore. But the poor hen was dead. And could lay eggs no more.    The Dog And His Image.  A foolish Dog, who carried in his jaw A juicy bone, Looked down into a stream, and there he saw Another one, Splash! In he plunged.. The image disappeared-- The meat he had was gone. Indeed, he nearly sank, And barely reached the bank.    The Acorn and the Pumpkin.  Once there was a country bumpkin Who observed a great big pumpkin To a slender stem attached; While upon an oak tree nourished, Little acorns grew and flourished. \"Bah!\" said he. \"That's badly matched.\"  \"If, despite my humble station, I'd a hand in this Creation, Pumpkins on the oaks would be; And the acorn, light and little, On this pumpkin stem so brittle Would be placed by clever Me.\"  Then, fatigued with so much thought, he Rest beneath the oak tree sought. He Soon in slumber found repose But, alas! An acorn, falling On the spot where he lay sprawling, Hit him--plump!--Upon the nose.  Up he jumped--a wiser bumpkin. \"Gosh!\" he said. \"Suppose a pumpkin Came a-fallin' on my face! After all, if I had made things, I'll allow that I'm afraid things Might be some what out of place.\"    The Raven And The Fox.  Mr. Raven was perched upon a limb, And Reynard the Fox looked up at him; For the Raven held in his great big beak A morsel the Fox would go far to seek.  Said the Fox, in admiring tones: \"My word! Sir Raven, you are a handsome bird. Such feathers! If you would only sing, The birds of these woods would call you King.\"  The Raven, who did not see the joke, Forgot that his voice was just a croak. He opened his beak, in his foolish pride-- And down fell the morsel the Fox had spied.  \"Ha-ha!\" said the Fox. \"And now you see You should not listen to flattery. Vanity, Sir is a horrid vice-- I'm sure the lesson is worth the price.\"    The City Mouse And The Country Mouse.  A City Mouse, with ways polite, A Country Mouse invited To sup with him and spend the night. Said Country Mouse: \"De--lighted!\" In truth it proved a royal treat, With everything that's good to eat.  Alas! When they had just begun To gobble their dinner, A knock was heard that made them run. The City Mouse seemed thinner. And as they scampered and turned tail, He saw the Country Mouse grow pale.  The knocking ceased. A false alarm! The City Mouse grew braver. \"Come back!\" he cried. \"No, no! The farm, Where I'll not quake or quaver, Suits me,\" replied the Country Mouse. \"You're welcome to your city house.\"    The Lion And The Gnat.   The Lion once said to the Gnat: \"You brat, Clear out just as quick as you can, now--s'cat! If you meddle with me I will not guarantee That you won't be slammed perfectly flat-- D'ye see?\"  Said the Gnat: \"Because you're called King--you thing!-- You fancy that you will make me take wing. Why, an ox weighs much more, Yet I drive him before When I get good and ready to sting. Now, roar!\"  Then loudly his trumpet he blew. And--whew! How fiercely and fast at his foe he flew. From the tail to the toes He draws blood as he goes. Then he starts in to sting and to chew His nose.  Sir Lion was mad with the pain. In vain He roared and he foamed and he shook his mane. All the beasts that were nigh Fled in fear from his cry. But the Gnat only stung him again-- In the eye.  He looked and laughed as he saw--Haw, Haw!-- The Lion self-torn by his tooth and claw, So His Majesty's hide With his own blood was dyed. Said the Gnat: \"Shall I serve you up raw-- Or fried?\"  It's finished. The Lion's loud roar is o'er. He's bitten and beaten, he's sick and sore. But a spider's web spread Trapped the Gnat as he sped With the news...He will never fight more-- He's dead!    The Dove And The Ant.  An Ant who in a brook would drink Fell off the bank. He tried To swim, and felt his courage sink-- This ocean seemed so wide. But for a dove who flew above He would have drowned and died.  The friendly Dove within her beak A bridge of grass-stem bore: On this the Ant, though worn and weak. Contrived to reach the shore Said he: \"The tact of this kind act I'll cherish evermore.\"  Behold! A barefoot wretch went by With slingshot in his hand. Said he: \"You'll make a pigeon pie That will be kind of grand.\" He meant to murder the gentle bird-- Who did not understand.  The Ant then stung him on the heel (So quick to see the sling). He turned his head, and missed a meal: The pigeon pie took wing. And so the Dove lived on to love-- Beloved by everything.    The Fox And The Grapes.  Rosy and ripe, and ready to box, The grapes hang high o'er the hungry Fox.-- He pricks up his ears, and his eye he cocks.  Ripe and rosy, yet so high!-- He gazes at them with a greedy eye, And knows he must eat and drink--or die.  When the jump proves to be beyond his power-- \"Pooh!\" says the Fox. \"Let the pigs devour Fruit of that sort. Those grapes are sour!\"    The Ass In The Lion's Skin.  An Ass in The Lion's skin arrayed Made everybody fear. And this was queer, Because he was himself afraid. Yet everywhere he strayed The people ran like deer.  Ah, ah! He is betrayed: No lion has that long and hairy ears.  Old Martin spied the tip; and country folk Who are not in the secret of the joke, With open mouths and eyes Stare at old Martin's prize-- A Lion led to mill, with neck in yoke.    The Fox And The Stork.  Old Father Fox, who was known to be mean, Invited Dame Stork in to dinner. There was nothing but soup that could scarcely be seen:-- Soup never was served any thinner. And the worst of it was, as I'm bound to relate, Father Fox dished it up on a flat china plate.  Dame Stork, as you know, has a very long beak: Not a crumb or drop could she gather Had she pecked at the plate every day in the week. But as for the Fox--sly old Father: With his tongue lapping soup at a scandalous rate, He licked up the last bit and polished the plate.  Pretty soon Mistress Stork spread a feast of her own; Father Fox was invited to share it. He came, and he saw, and he gave a great groan: The stork had known how to prepare it. She had meant to get even, and now was her turn: Father Fox was invited to eat from an urn.  The urn's mouth was small, and it had a long neck; The food in it smelled most delightful. Dame Stork, with her beak in, proceeded to peck; But the Fox found that fasting is frightful. Home he sneaked. On his way there he felt his ears burn When he thought of the Stork and her tall, tricky urn.    The Monkey And The Cat.  Jocko the Monkey, Mouser--his chum, the Cat, Had the same master. Both were sleek and fat, And mischievous. If anything went wrong, The neighbors where not blamed. Be sure of that.  Jocko, 'tis said was something of a thief; Mouser, if truth be told, would just as lief Much stolen cheese as chase the midnight mouse. The praise bestowed on either must be brief.  One day these rogues, stretched flat before the fire, Saw chestnuts roassting. \"Ah! Could we conspire To jerk them out,\" said Jocko, \"from the coals, We'd smash the shells and have our heart's desire.  \"Come, Brother Mouser! This day 'tis your turn To do some bold and desperate thing to earn A reputation. You, who are so quick, Snatch out the nuts before they start to burn.  \"Alas! That I, a Monkey, was not made To play with fire. But you are not afraid.\" So Mouser--pleased, like many a cat or man, With pretty words--sly Jocko's wish obeyed.  Into the fire he put a practiced paw: Out came a chestnut clinging to his claw-- Another and another. As they dropped Jocko devoured them, whether roast or raw.  A servant enters. Off the robbers run. Jocko, you may be sure, enjoyed the fun. But Mouser's paw is sadly singed--for what? Just to get nuts for Jocko. He got none.    The Hare And The Tortoise.  Said the Tortoise one day to the Hare: \"I'll run you a race if you dare. I'll bet you cannot Arrive at that spot As quickly as I can get there.\"  Quoth the Hare: \"You are surely insane. Pray, what has affected your brain? You seem pretty sick. Call a doctor in--quick, And let him prescribe for your pain.\"  \"Never mind,\" said the Tortoise. \"Let's run! Will you bet me?\" \"Why, certainly.\" \"Done!\" While the slow Tortoise creeps Mr. Hare makes four leaps, And then loafs around in the sun.  It seemed such a one-sided race, To win was almost a disgrace. So he frolicked about Then at last he set out-- As the Tortoise was as nearing the place.  Too late! Though he sped like a dart, The Tortoise was first. She was smart: \"You can surely run fast,\" She remarked. \"Yet you're last. It is better to get a good start.\"    The Heron Who Was Hard To Please.  A long-legged Heron, with long neck and beak, Set out for a stroll by the bank of a creek. So clear was the water that if you looked sharp You could see the pike caper around with the carp. The Heron might quickly have speared enough fish To make for his dinner a capital dish. But he was a very particular bird: His food fixed \"just so,\" at the hours he"]]]
