CHAPTER II  HE DOES A GOOD TURN AND MAKES A DISCOVERY   \"What became of the Schmitts?\" Tom asked.  \"It's aisy ter see ye've ben away from here,\" said Pete.  \"I've only been back five days,\" Tom explained.  \"Wal, if ye'd been here two weeks ago, ye'd know more'n ye know now about it. Ye're a jack ashore, that's what ye are. Ye've got ter be spruced up on the news. Did ye know the school house burned down?\"  \"Yes, I knew that.\"  \"Wal--about this Schmitt, here; thar wuz two detectives come out from Noo Yorrk--from the Fideral phad'ye call it. They wuz making inquiries about Schmitt. Fer th' wan thing he wuz an aly-_an_, 'n' they hed some raysons to think he wuz mixed up in plots. They wuz mighty close-mouthed about it, so I heerd, 'n' they asked more'n they told. Nivir within half a mile uv Schmitt did they go, but by gorry, he gits wind uv it 'n' th' nixt mornin' not so much as a sign uv him wuz thar left.  \"Cleared out, loike that,\" said Pete, clapping his hands and spreading his arms by way of illustrating how Adolf Schmitt had vanished in air.  \"Thar wuz th' grocery full uv stuff and all, 'n' the furnitoor upstairs, but Adolf 'n' the old wooman 'n' th' kids 'n' sich duds ez they cud cram inter their bags wuz gone--bury drawers lift wide open, ez if they'd went in a ghreat hurry.\"  Tom had listened in great surprise. \"What--do--you--know--about--that?\" he gasped when Pete at last paused.  \"It's iviry blessed worrd that I know. I'm thinkin' he wint ter Germany, mebbe.\"  \"How could he get there?\" Tom asked.  \"Wouldn't thim Dutch skippers in Noo Yorrk Harrbor help him out?\" Pete shouted. \"Gerrmany, Holland--'tis all th' same. Thar's ways uv gittin' thar, you kin thrust the Germans. They're comin' and goin' back all the toime.\"  \"What do you suppose they suspected him of?\" Tom asked, his astonishment still possessing him.  \"Nivir a worrd wud they say, but ye kin bet yer Uncle Sammy's not spyin' around afther people fer nuthin'. They searched the store aftherworrds, but nary a thing cud they find.\"  So that was the explanation of the now vacant store which had been so much a part of the life of Tom Slade and his poor, shiftless family. That was the end, so far as Bridgeboro was concerned, of the jovial, good-hearted grocer, and Fritzie and little Emmy and \"Mooder\" in her stiff, spotless white apron. It seemed almost unbelievable.  \"A Hun is a Hun,\" said Pete, \"'n' that's all thar is to't.\"  \"What did they do with all the stuff?\" Tom asked.  Pete shrugged his shoulders. \"Mister Temple, he owns th' buildin' an' he hed it cleared out, 'n' now he leaves them Red Cross ladies use it fer ter make bandages 'n' phwat all, 'n' collect money fer their campaign. He's a ghrand man, Mister Temple. Would ye gimme a lift wid this here table, now, while ye're here, Tommy?\"  As they carried the table across the sidewalk, a group of ladies came down the block and whom should Tom see among them but Mrs. Temple and her daughter Mary. As he looked at Mary (whom he used to tease and call \"stuck up\") he realized that he was not the only person in Bridgeboro who had been growing up, for she was quite a young lady, and very pretty besides.  \"Why, Thomas, how _do_ you do!\" said Mrs. Temple. \"I heard you were back----\"  \"And you never came to see us,\" interrupted Mary.  \"I only got back Tuesday,\" said Tom, a little flustered.  He told them briefly of his trip and when the little chat was over Pete Connigan had disappeared.  \"I wonder if you wouldn't be willing to move one or two things for us?\" Mrs. Temple asked. \"Have you time? I meant to ask the truckman, but----\"  \"He may be too old to be a scout any more, but he's not too old to do a good turn,\" teased Mary.  They entered the store where the marks of the departed store fixtures were visible along the walls and Schmitt's old counter stood against one side. Piles of Red Cross literature now lay upon it. Upon a rough makeshift table were boxes full of yarn (destined to keep many a long needle busy) and the place was full of the signs of its temporary occupancy.  \"If I hadn't joined the Red Cross already, I'd join now,\" said Tom, apologetically, displaying his button. \"A girl in our office got me to join.\"  \"Wasn't she mean,\" said Mary. \"I'm going to make you work anyhow, just out of spite.\"  Other women now arrived, armed with no end of what Tom called \"first aid stuff,\" and with bundles of long knitting needles, silent weapons for the great drive.  Tom was glad enough to retreat before this advancing host and carry several large boxes into the cellar. Then he hauled the old grocery counter around so that the women working at it could be seen from the street. The table, too, he pulled this way and that, to suit the changing fancy of the ladies in authority.  \"There, I guess that's about right,\" said Mrs. Temple, eying it critically; \"now, there's just one thing more--if you've time. There's a thing down in the cellar with little compartments, sort of----\"  \"I know,\" said Tom; \"the old spice cabinet.\"  \"I wonder if we could bring it up together,\" said Mrs. Temple.  \"I'll get it,\" Tom said.  \"You couldn't do it alone,\" said Mary. \"I'll help.\"  \"I can do it better without anybody getting in the way,\" said Tom with characteristic bluntness, and Mary and her mother were completely squelched.  \"Gracious, now he has grown,\" said Mrs. Temple, as Tom disappeared downstairs.  \"His eyes used to be gray; they've changed,\" said Mary.  As if that had anything to do with moving tables and spice cabinets!  The spice cabinet stood against the brick chimney and was covered with thick dust. Behind it was a disused stove-pipe hole stuffed with rags, which Tom pulled out to brush the dust off the cabinet before lifting it.  He had pushed it hardly two feet in the direction of the stairs when his coat caught on a nail and he struck a match to see if it had torn. The damage was slight, and, with his customary attention to details, he saw that the nail was one of several which had fastened a narrow strip of molding around the cabinet. About two feet of this molding had been torn away, leaving the nails protruding from the cabinet and Tom noticed not only that the unvarnished strip which the molding had covered was clean and white, but that the exposed parts of the nails were still shiny.  \"Huh,\" he thought, \"whoever pulled that off must have been in a great hurry not to hammer the nails in or even pull them out.\"  As he twisted the nails out, one by one, it occurred to him to wonder why the heavy, clinging coat of damp dust which covered the rest of the cabinet was absent from this white unsoiled strip and shiny nails. The cabinet, he thought, must have been in the cellar for some time, whereas the molding must have been wrenched from it very recently, for it does not take long for a nail to become rusty in a damp cellar.  He struck another match and looked about near the chimney, intending, if the strip of molding were there, to take it upstairs and nail it on where it belonged, for one of the good things which the scout life had taught Tom was that broken furniture and crooked nails sticking out spell carelessness and slovenliness.  But the strip was not to be found. A less observant boy would not have given two thoughts to the matter, but in his hasty thinking Tom reached this conclusion, that some one had very lately pulled this strip of molding off of the cabinet and had used it for a purpose, since it was nowhere to be seen.  With Pete's tale fresh in his mind, he struck match after match and peered about the cellar. Against the opposite wall he noticed a stick with curved tongs on one end of it, manipulated by a thin metal bar running to the other end. It was one of those handy implements used to lift cans down from high shelves. It stood among other articles, a rake, an old broom, but the deft little mechanical hand on the end of it was bright and shiny, so this, too, had not been long in the damp cellar.  For a moment Tom paused and thought. It never occurred to him that momentous consequences might hang upon his thinking. He was simply curious and rather puzzled.  He picked up the can lifter and stood looking at it. Then with a sudden thought he went back to the chimney, struck a match and, thrusting his head into the sooty hole, looked up. Four or five feet above, well out of arm's reach, something thin ran across from one side to the other of the spacious chimney. The can lifter was too long to be gotten wholly into the chimney, but Tom poked the end of it through the hole and upward until its angle brought it against the chimney wall.  It was right there that the crosspiece was wedged. In other words, it had been pushed as high, a little on this side, a little on that, as this handy implement would reach, and perhaps kept from falling in the process by the gripping tongs.  Not another inch could Tom reach with this stick. By hammering upward against the end of it, however, he was able to jam it up a trifle, thanks to its capacity for bending. Thus he dislodged the crosspiece and as it tumbled down he saw that it was the strip of molding from the cabinet.  But along with it there fell something else which interested him far more. This was a packet which had evidently been held against the side of the chimney by the stick. There were six bulging envelopes held together by a rubber band. The dampness of the chimney had not affected the live rubber and it still bore its powdery white freshness.  \"I wonder if they looked there,\" Tom thought. \"Maybe they just reached around--kind of. I should think they'd "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23663"],["title","Tom Slade on a Transport (#2)"],["body","noticed those shiny nails, though.\"  He put the packet safely in his pocket and, hauling the cabinet up on his back staggered up the stairs with it.  \"What in the world took you so long?\" said Mary Temple. \"Oh, look at your face!\"  \"I can't look at it,\" said matter-of-fact Tom.  \"It's too funny! You've got soot all over it. Come over here and I'll wash it off.\"  It was a curious thing about Tom Slade and a matter of much amusement to his friends, that however brave or noble or heroic his acts might be, he was pretty sure to get his necktie halfway around his neck and a dirty face into the bargain.     CHAPTER III  HE SCENTS DANGER AND RECEIVES A LETTER   Tom was greatly excited by his discovery. As he hurried to the office he opened the envelopes and what he found was not of a nature to modify his excitement. Here was German propaganda work with a vengeance. He felt that he had plunged into the very heart of the Teuton spy system. Evidently the recipient of these documents had considered them too precious to destroy and too dangerous to carry.  \"He might still think of a way to get them, maybe,\" thought Tom.  There was a paper containing a list of all the American cantonments and opposite each camp several names of individuals. Tom thought these might be spies in Uncle Sam's uniform. There was some correspondence about smuggling dental rubber out of the United States to make gas masks in Germany. There were requests for money. There was one letter giving information, in considerable detail, about aeroplane manufacture.  Another letter in the same handwriting interested Tom particularly, because of his interest in gas engines--the result of his many tussles with the obstreperous motor of the troop's cabin launch, _Good Turn_. Skimming hastily over some matter about the receipt of money through some intermediary, his interest was riveted by the following:       \"... I told you about having plans of high pressure motor. That's      for battle planes at high altitudes. I've got the drawings of the      other now--the low pressure one I told you about at S----'s. That's      for seaplanes, submarine spotting, and all that. Develops 400 H.P.      They're not putting those in the planes that are going over now,      but all planes going over next year will have them. B---- told me      what you said about me going across, but that's the only reason I      suggested it--because the information won't be of any particular      use to them after they bring down a plane. They'll see the whole      thing before their eyes then. But suit yourself. There's a lot of      new wrinkles on this motor. I'll tell you that, but there's no use      telling you about it when you don't know a gas engine from a      meat-chopper.       \"Sure, I could tend to the other matter too--it's the same idea as      a periscope. That's a cinch. I knew a chap worked on the      _Christopher Colon_. She used to run to Central America. Maybe I      could swing it that way. Anyway, I'll see you.       \"If you have to leave in a hurry, leave money and any directions at      S----'s.       \"I'm going to be laid off here, anyway, on account of my eardrums.       \"Hope B---- will give you this all right. Guess that's all now.\"  Tom read this twice and out of its scrappiness and incompleteness he gathered this much! that somebody who was about to be dismissed from an aeroplane factory for the very usual reason that he could not stand the terrific noise, had succeeded in either making or procuring plans of Uncle Sam's new aeroplane engine, the Liberty Motor.  He understood the letter to mean that it was very important that these drawings reach Germany before the motors were in service, since then it would be too late for the Germans to avail themselves of \"Yankee ingenuity,\" and also since they would in all probability succeed in capturing one of the planes.  He gathered further that the sender of the letter was prepared to go himself with these plans, working his way on an American ship, and to do something else (doubtless of a diabolical character) on the way. The phrase \"same idea as a periscope\" puzzled him. It appeared, also, that the sender of the letter, whoever he was and wherever he was (for no place or date or signature was indicated and the envelopes were not the original ones) had not sent his communications direct to this alien grocer, but to someone else who had delivered them to Schmitt.  \"It isn't anything for me to be mixed up in, anyway,\" Tom thought. He was almost afraid to carry papers of such sinister purport with him and he quickened his steps in order that he might turn them over to Mr. Burton, the manager of Temple Camp office.  But when he reached the office he did not carry out this intention, for there was waiting for him a letter which upset all his plans and made him forget for the time being these sinister papers. It took him back with a rush to his experiences on shipboard and he read it with a smile on his lips.       \"Dear Tommy--I don't know whether this letter will ever reach you,      for, for all I know, you're in Davy Jones's locker. Even my memo of      your address got pretty well soaked in the ocean and all I'm dead      sure of is that you live in North America somewhere near a bridge.\"  Tom turned the sheet to look at the signature but he knew already that the letter was from his erstwhile friend, Mr. Carleton Conne.       \"You'll remember that I promised to get you a job working for Uncle      Sam. That job is yours if you're alive to take it. It'll bring you      so near the war, if that's what you want, that you couldn't stick a      piece of tissue paper between.       \"If you get this all right and are still keen to work in transport      service, there won't be any difficulty on account of the experience      you've had.       \"Drop in to see me Saturday afternoon, room 509, Federal Building,      New York, if you're interested.       \"Best wishes to you.                                                     \"Carleton Conne.\"  So Mr. Conne was alive and had not forgotten him. Tom wished that the letter had told something about the detective's rescue and the fate of the spy, but he realized that Secret Service agents could hardly be expected to dwell on their adventures to \"ship's boy\" acquaintances, and was it not enough that Mr. Conne remembered him at all, and his wish to serve on an army transport?  He took the letter into the private office to show it to Mr. Burton, resolved now that he would say nothing about his discovery in Schmitt's cellar, for surely Mr. Conne would be the proper one to give the papers to.  \"You remember,\" he began, \"that I said if I ever heard from Mr. Conne and he offered me a job, I'd like to go. And you said it would be all right.\"  Mr. Burton nodded. \"And the expected--or the unexpected--has happened,\" he added, smiling, as he handed Mr. Conne's letter back to Tom.  \"It'll be all right, won't it?\" Tom asked.  \"I suppose it will have to be, Tom,\" Mr. Burton said pleasantly. \"That was our understanding, wasn't it?\"  \"Yes, sir--but I'm sorry--kind of.\"  \"I'm sorry, kind of, too; but I suppose there's no help for it. Some boys,\" he added, as he toyed with a paperweight, \"seem to be born to work in offices, and some to wander over the face of the earth. I would be the last to discourage you from entering war service in whatever form it might be. But I'm afraid you'd go anyway, Tom, war or no war. The world isn't big enough for some people. They're born that way. I'm afraid you're one of them. It's surprising how unimportant money is in traveling if one has the wanderlust. It'll be all right,\" he concluded with a pleasant but kind of rueful smile. He understood Tom Slade thoroughly.  \"That's another thing I was thinking about, too,\" said Tom. \"Pretty soon I'll be eighteen and then I want to enlist. If I enlist in this country I'll have to spend a whole lot of time in camp, and maybe in the end I wouldn't get sent to the firing line at all. There's lots of 'em won't even get across. If they find you've got good handwriting or maybe some little thing like that, they'll keep you here driving an army wagon or something. If I go on a transport I can give it up at either port. It's mostly going over that the fellers are kept busy anyway; coming back they don't need them. I found that out before. They'll give you a release there if you want to join the army. So if I keep going back and forth till my birthday, then maybe I could hike it through France and join Pershing's army. I'd rather be trained over there, 'cause then I'm nearer the front. You don't think that's sort of cheating the government, do you?\" he added.  Mr. Burton laughed. \"I don't think the government will object to that sort of cheating,\" he said.  \"I read about a feller that joined in France, so I know you can do it. You see, it cuts out a lot of red tape, and I'd kind of like hiking it alone--ever since I was a scout I've felt that way.\"  \"Once a scout, always a scout,\" smiled Mr. Burton, using a phrase of which he was very fond and which Tom had learned from him; \"and it wouldn't be Tom Slade if he didn't go about things in a way of his own, eh, Tom? Well, good luck to you.\"  Tom went out and in his exuberance he showed Mr. Conne's letter to Margaret Ellison, who also worked in Temple Camp office.  \"It's splendid,\" she said, \"and as soon as you _know_ you're going I'm going to hang a service flag in the window.\"  \"You can't hang out a service flag for a feller that's working on a transport,\" Tom said. \"He isn't in regular military service. When I'm enlisted I'll let you know.\"  \"You must be sure to write.\"  Tom promised and was delighted. So great was his elation, indeed, that on his way home to his room that evening he went through Terrace Avenue again, to see how the Red Cross women were getting on in their new quarters.  Mary Temple received him in a regular nurse's costume, which made Tom almost wish that he"]]]
