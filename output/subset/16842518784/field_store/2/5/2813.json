Till, as a mist, their beauty died,     Their singing shrill and fainter grew;     And daylight tremulous and wide     Flooded the moorland through and through;     Till Urdon's copper weathercock     Was reared in golden flame afar,     And dim from moonlit dreams awoke     The towers and groves of Arroar.         REVERIE       When slim Sophia mounts her horse        And paces down the avenue,     It seems an inward melody          She paces to.      Each narrow hoof is lifted high       Beneath the dark enclust'ring pines,     A silver ray within his bit         And bridle shines.      His eye burns deep, his tail is arched,       And streams upon the shadowy air,     The daylight sleeks his jetty flanks,         His mistress' hair.      Her habit flows in darkness down,       Upon the stirrup rests her foot,     Her brow is lifted, as if earth         She heeded not.      'Tis silent in the avenue,       The sombre pines are mute of song,     The blue is dark, there moves no breeze         The boughs among.      When slim Sophia mounts her horse       And paces down the avenue,     It seems an inward melody         She paces to.         THE THREE BEGGARS       'Twas autumn daybreak gold and wild,       While past St Ann's grey tower they shuffled,     Three beggars spied a fairy-child         In crimson mantle muffled.      The daybreak lighted up her face       All pink, and sharp, and emerald-eyed;     She looked on them a little space,         And shrill as hautboy cried:--      'O three tall footsore men of rags       Which walking this gold morn I see,     What will ye give me from your bags         For fairy kisses three?'      The first, that was a reddish man,       Out of his bundle takes a crust:     'La, by the tombstones of St Ann,         There's fee, if fee ye must!'      The second, that was a chesnut man,       Out of his bundle draws a bone:     'La, by the belfry of St Ann,         And all my breakfast gone!'      The third, that was a yellow man,       Out of his bundle picks a groat,     'La, by the Angel of St Ann,         And I must go without.'      That changeling, lean and icy-lipped,       Touched crust, and bone, and groat, and lo!     Beneath her finger taper-tipped         The magic all ran through.      Instead of crust a peacock pie,       Instead of bone sweet venison,     Instead of groat a white lilie         With seven blooms thereon.      And each fair cup was deep with wine:       Such was the changeling's charity,     The sweet feast was enough for nine,         But not too much for three.      O toothsome meat in jelly froze!       O tender haunch of elfin stag!     O rich the odour that arose!         O plump with scraps each bag!      There, in the daybreak gold and wild,       Each merry-hearted beggar man     Drank deep unto the fairy child,         And blessed the good St Ann.         THE DWARF       'Now, Jinnie, my dear, to the dwarf be off,         That lives in Barberry Wood,     And fetch me some honey, but be sure you don't laugh,--       He hates little girls that are rude, are rude,         He hates little girls that are rude.'      Jane tapped at the door of the house in the wood,         And the dwarf looked over the wall,     He eyed her so queer, 'twas as much as she could       To keep from laughing at all, at all,         To keep from laughing at all.      His shoes down the passage came clod, clod, clod,         And when he opened the door,     He croaked so harsh, 'twas as much as she could       To keep from laughing the more, the more,         To keep from laughing the more.      As there, with his bushy red beard, he stood,         Pricked out to double its size,     He squinted so cross, 'twas as much as she could       To keep the tears out of her eyes, her eyes,         To keep the tears out of her eyes.      He slammed the door, and went clod, clod, clod,         But while in the porch she bides,     He squealed so fierce, 'twas as much as she could       To keep from cracking her sides, her sides,         To keep from cracking her sides.      He threw a pumpkin over the wall,         And melons and apples beside,     So thick in the air, that to see 'em all fall,       She laughed, and laughed, till she cried, cried, cried,         Jane laughed and laughed till she cried.      Down fell her teardrops a pit-apat-pat,         And red as a rose she grew;--     'Kah! kah!' said the dwarf, 'is it crying you're at?       It's the very worst thing you could do, do, do,         It's the very worst thing you could do.'      He slipped like a monkey up into a tree,         He shook her down cherries like rain;     'See now,' says he, cheeping, 'a blackbird I be,       Laugh, laugh, little Jinnie, again-gain-gain,         Laugh, laugh, little Jinnie, again.'      Ah me! what a strange, what a gladsome duet         From a house i' the deeps of a wood!     Such shrill and such harsh voices never met yet       A-laughing as loud as they could-could-could,         A-laughing as loud as they could.      Come Jinnie, come dwarf, cocksparrow, and bee,         There's a ring gaudy-green in the dell,     Sing, sing, ye sweet cherubs, that flit in the tree;       La! who can draw tears from a well-well-well,         Who ever drew tears from a well!         ALULVAN       The sun is clear of bird and cloud,     The grass shines windless, grey, and still,     In dusky ruin the owl dreams on,     The cuckoo echoes on the hill;       Yet soft along Alulvan's walks         The ghost at noonday stalks.      His eyes in shadow of his hat     Stare on the ruins of his house;     His cloak, up-fasten'd with a brooch,     Of faded velvet grey as mouse,       Brushes the roses as he goes:         Yet wavers not one rose.      The wild birds in a cloud fly up     From their sweet feeding in the fruit;     The droning of the bees and flies     Rises gradual as a lute;       Is it for fear the birds are flown,         And shrills the insect-drone?      Thick is the ivy o'er Alulvan,     And crisp with summer-heat its turf;     Far, far across its empty pastures     Alulvan's sands are white with surf:       And he himself is grey as sea,         Watching beneath an elder-tree.      All night the fretful, shrill Banshee     Lurks in the chambers' dark festoons,     Calling for ever, o'er garden and river,     Through magpie changing of the moons:       'Alulvan, O, alas! Alulvan,         The doom of lone Alulvan!'         THE PEDLAR       There came a Pedlar to an evening house;     Sweet Lettice, from her lattice looking down,     Wondered what man he was, so curious     His black hair dangled on his tattered gown:     Then lifts he up his face, with glittering eyes,--     'What will you buy, sweetheart?--Here's honeycomb,     And mottled pippins, and sweet mulberry pies,     Comfits and peaches, snowy cherry bloom,     To keep in water for to make night sweet:     All that you want, sweetheart,--come, taste and eat!'      Ev'n with his sugared words, returned to her     The clear remembrance of a gentle voice:--     'And O! my child, should ever a flatterer     Tap with his wares, and promise of all joys     And vain sweet pleasures that on earth may be;     Seal up your ears, sing some old happy song,     Confuse his magic who is all mockery:     His sweets are death.' Yet, still, how she doth long     But just to taste, then shut the lattice tight,     And hide her eyes from the delicious sight!      'What must I pay?' she whispered. 'Pay!' says he,     'Pedlar I am who through this wood do roam,     One lock of hair is gold enough for me,     For apple, peach, comfit, or honeycomb!'     But from her bough a drowsy squirrel cried,     'Trust him not, Lettice, trust, oh trust him not!'     And many another woodland tongue beside     Rose softly in the silence--'Trust him not!'     Then cried the Pedlar in a bitter voice,     'What, in the thicket, is this idle noise?'      A late, harsh blackbird smote him with her wings,     As through the glade, dark in the dim, she flew;     Yet still the Pedlar his old burden sings,--     'What, pretty sweetheart, shall I show to you?     Here's orange ribands, here's a string of pearls,     Here's silk of buttercup and pansy glove,     A pin of tortoiseshell for windy curls,     A box of silver, scented sweet with clove:     Come now,' he says, with dim and lifted face,     'I pass not often such a lonely place.'      'Pluck not a hair!' a hidden rabbit cried,     'With but one hair he'll steal thy heart away,     Then only sorrow shall thy lattice hide:     Go in! all honest pedlars come by day.'     There was dead silence in the drowsy wood;     'Here's syrup for to lull sweet maids to sleep;     And bells for dreams, and fairy wine and food     All day thy heart in happiness to keep';--     And now she takes the scissors on her thumb,--     'O, then, no more unto my lattice come!'      O sad the sound of weeping in the wood!     Now only night is where the Pedlar was;     And bleak as frost upon a too-sweet bud     His magic steals in darkness, O alas!     Why all the summer doth sweet Lettice pine?     And, ere the wheat is ripe, why lies her gold     Hid 'neath fresh new-pluckt sprigs of eglantine?     Why all the morning hath the cuckoo tolled,     Sad to and fro in green and secret ways,     With lonely bells the burden of his days?      And, in the market-place, what man is this     Who wears a loop of gold upon his breast,     Stuck heartwise; and whose glassy flatteries     Take all the townsfolk ere they go to rest     Who come to buy and gossip? Doth his eye     Remember a face lovely in a wood?     O people! hasten, hasten, do not buy     His woful wares; the bird of grief doth brood     There where his heart should be; and far away     Dew lies on grave-flowers this selfsame day!         THE GREY WOLF       'A fagot, a fagot, go fetch for the fire, son!'       'O, Mother, the wolf looks in at the door!'

Blessin’s! Blessin’s!’ I dun’no’ how fur I hearn that sayin’. The rocks round the creek war repeatin’ it, whenst I crossed the f oot-bredge. I dun’no what the feller meant--mought hev been crazy.”  A tricksy gust stirred at the door as if a mischievous hand twitched the latch-string, but it hung within. There was a pause. The listening children on the hearth sighed and shifted their posture; one of the hounds snored sonorously in the silence.  “Nuthin’ crazy thar ‘ceptin’ you-uns!--one fool gal--that’s all!” said her grandmother, with her knitting-needles and her spectacles glittering in the firelight. “That is a pest camp. Ye mought hev cotch the smallpox. I be lookm’ fur ye ter break out with it any day. When the war is over an’ the men come back to the Cove, none of ‘em will so much as look at ye, with yer skin all pock-marked--fair an’ fine as it is now, like a pan of fraish milk.”  “But, granny, it won’t be sp’ilt! The camp war too fur off--an’ thar warn’t a breath o’ wind. I never went a-nigh ‘em.”  “I dun’no’ how fur smallpox kin travel--an’ it jes’ mulls and mulls in ye afore it breaks out--don’t it, S’briny?”  “Don’t ax me,” said Mrs. Brusie, with a worried air. “I ain’t no yerb doctor, nor nurse tender, nuther. Ethelindy is beyond my understandin’.”  She was beyond her own understanding, as she sat weeping slowly, silently. The aspect of those forlorn graves, that recorded the final ebbing of hope and life at the pest camp, had struck her recollection with a most poignant appeal. Strangers, wretches, dying alone, desolate outcasts, the terror of their kind, the epitome of repulsion--they were naught to her! Yet they represented humanity in its helplessness, its suffering, its isolated woe, and its great and final mystery; she felt vaguely grieved for their sake, and she gave the clay that covered them, still crude red clods with not yet a blade of grass, the fellowship of her tears.  A thrill of masculine logic stirred uneasily in the old man’s disused brain. “Tell me _one_ thing, Ethelindy,” he said, lifting his bleared eyes as he clasped his tremulous hands more firmly on the head of his stick--“tell me this--which side air you-uns on, ennyhow, Ethelindy?”  “I’m fur the Union,” said Ethelinda, still weeping, and now and then wiping her sapphire eyes with the back of her hand, hard and tanned, but small in proportion to her size. “I’m fur the Union--fust an’ last an’ all the time.”  The old man wagged his head solemnly with a blight of forecast on his wrinkled, aged face. “That thar sayin’ is goin’ ter be mighty hard ter live up to whilst Jerome Ackert’s critter company is a-raidin’ of Tanglefoot Cove.”  The presence of the “critter company” was indeed calculated to inspire a most obsequious awe. It was an expression of arbitrary power which one might ardently wish directed elsewhere. From the moment that the echoes of the Cove caught the first elusive strain of the trumpet, infinitely sweet and clear and compelling, yet somehow ethereal, unreal, as if blown down from the daylight moon, a filmy lunar semblance in the bland blue sky, the denizens of Tanglefoot began to tremulously confer together, and to skitter like frightened rabbits from house to house. Tanglefoot Cove is some four miles long, and its average breadth is little more than a mile. On all sides the great Smoky Mountains rise about the cuplike hollow, and their dense gigantic growths of hickory and poplar, maple and gum, were aglow, red and golden, with the largesse of the generous October. The underbrush or the jungles of laurel that covered the steeps rendered outlet through the forests impracticable, and indeed the only road was invisible save for a vague line among the dense pines of a precipitous slope, where on approach it would materialize under one’s feet as a wheel track on either side of a line of frosted weeds, which the infrequent passing of wagon-beds had bent and stunted, yet had not sufficed to break.  The blacksmith’s shop, the centre of the primitive civilization, had soon an expectant group in its widely flaring doors, for the smith had had enough of the war, and had come back to wistfully, hopelessly haunt his anvil like some uneasy ghost visiting familiar scenes in which he no more bears a part;--a minié-ball had shattered his stanch hammer-arm, and his duties were now merely advisory to a clumsy apprentice. This was a half-witted fellow, a giant in strength, but not to be trusted with firearms. In these days of makeweights his utility had been discovered, and now with the smith’s hammer in his hand he joined the group, his bulging eyes all a-stare and his loose lips hanging apart. The old justice of the peace, whose office was a sinecure, since the war had run the law out of the Cove, came with a punctilious step, though with a sense of futility and abated dignity, and at every successive note of the distant trumpet these wights experienced a tense bracing of the nerves to await helplessly the inevitable and, alas! the inexorable.  “They say that he is a tumble, tumble man,” the blacksmith averred, ever and anon rubbing the stump of his amputated hammer-arm, in which, though bundled in its jeans’ sleeve, he had the illusion of the sensation of its hand and fingers. He suddenly shaded his brow with his broad palm to eye that significant line which marked the road among the pines on the eastern slope, beyond the Indian corn that stood tall and rank of growth in the rich bottom-lands.  Ethelinda’s heart sank. All unprescient of the day’s impending event, she had come to the forge with the sley of her loom to be mended, and she now stood holding the long shaft in her mechanical clasp, while she listened spell-bound to the agitated talk of the group. The boughs of a great yellow hickory waved above her head; near by was the trough, and here a horse, brought to be shod, was utilizing the interval by a draught; he had ceased to draw in the clear, cold spring water, but still stood with his muzzle close to the surface, his lips dripping, gazing with un-imagined thoughts at the reflection of his big equine eyes, the blue sky inverted, the dappling yellow leaves, more golden even than the sunshine, and the glimmering flight of birds, with a stellular light upon their wings.  “A turrible man?--w-w-well,” stuttered the idiot, who had of late assumed all the port of coherence; he snatched and held a part in the colloquy, so did the dignity of labor annul the realization of his infirmity, “then I’d be obleeged ter him ef--ef--ef he’d stay out’n Tanglefoot Cove.”  “So would I.” The miller laughed uneasily. But for the corrugations of time, one might not have known if it were flour or age that had so whitened his long beard, which hung quivering down over the breast of his jeans coat, of an indeterminate hue under its frosting from the hopper. “He hev tuk up a tumble spite at Tanglefoot Cove.”  The blacksmith nodded. “They say that he ‘lowed ez traitors orter be treated like traitors. But _I_ be a-goin’ ter tell him that the Confederacy hev got one arm off’n me more’n its entitled to, an’ I’m willin’ ter call it quits at that.”  “‘Tain’t goin’ ter do him no good ter raid the Cove,” an ancient farmer averred; “an’ it’s agin’ the rebel rule, ennyhows, ter devastate the kentry they live off’n--it’s like sawin’ off the bough ye air sittin’ on.” His eyes dwelt with a fearful affection on the laden fields; his old stoop-shouldered back had bent yet more under the toil that had brought his crop to this perfection, with the aid of the children whose labor was scarcely worth the strenuosity requisite to control their callow wiles.  “Shucks! He’s a guerilla--he is!” retorted the blacksmith. “Accountable ter nobody! Hyar ter-day an’ thar ter-morrer. Rides light. Two leetle Parrott guns is the most weight he carries.”  The idiot’s eyes began to widen with slow and baffled speculation. “Whut--w-whut ails him ter take arter Tangle-foot? W-w--” his great loose lips trembled with unformed words as he gazed his eager inquiry from one to another. Under normal circumstances it would have remained contemptuously unanswered, but in these days in Tanglefoot Cove a man, though a simpleton, was yet a man, and inherently commanded respect.  “A bird o’ the air mus’ hev carried the matter that Tolhurst’s troops hed rid inter Tanglefoot Cove by mistake fur Greenbrier, whar they war ter cross ter jine the Fed’rals nigh the Cohuttas. An’ that guerilla, Ackert, hed been ridin’ a hundred mile at a hand-gallop ter overhaul him, an’ knowin’ thar warn’t but one outlet to Tanglefoot Cove, he expected ter capshur the Feds as they kem out agin. So he sot himself ter ambush Tolhurst, an’ waited fur him _up_ thar amongst the pines an’ the laurel--an’ he _waited_--an’ _waited!_ But Tolhurst never came! So whenst the guerilla war sure he hed escaped by ways unknownst he set out ter race him down ter the Cohutty Mountings. But Tolhurst had j’ined the main body o’ the Federal Army, an’ now Ackert is showing a clean pair o’ heels comin’ back. But he be goin’ ter take time ter raid the Cove--his hurry will wait fur that! Somebody in Tanglefoot--the Lord only knows who--showed Tolhurst that underground way out ter Greenbrier Cove, through a sorter cave or tunnel in the mountings.”  “Now--now--neighbor--_that’s_ guesswork,” remonstrated the miller, in behalf of Tanglefoot Cove repudiating the responsibility. Perhaps the semi-mercantile occupation of measuring toll sharpens the faculties beyond natural endowments, and he began to perceive a certain connection between cause and effect inimical to personal interest.  “Waal, that is the way they went, sartain sure,” protested the blacksmith. “I tracked ‘em, the ground bein’ moist, kase I wanted ter view the marks o’ their horses’ hoofs. They hev got some powerful triflin’ blacksmiths in the army--farriers, they call ‘em. I los’ the trail"]]]
