When the craft signalled to, however, was near enough, colored lights operated from the deck were used instead, that the messages might not be sent far enough into the night to be picked up by skulking enemy craft.  \"It looks like a night of tame sport, sir,\" said Fernald, just before he went below for a nap.  \"It has been quiet so far,\" Darrin agreed. \"But the most striking thing in naval service is that whatever starts comes without warning. We might have a whole week as quiet as to-night has been, and then run into twenty-four hours of work that would give both of us gray hair.\"  An hour after Fernald went below Dave had a steamer chair brought to the bridge, also a rug. The chair was placed where a canvas wind-shield would protect the sitter from the keen edge of the wind.  \"I'm going to doze right here, Mr. Ormsby,\" Dave explained to the ensign who was on bridge watch. \"I'm to be called the instant anything turns up.\"  Accustomed to such sleeps Darrin had barely closed his eyes when he was off in the Land o' Nod. Some time afterwards the sharp orders of Ensign Andrews, new officer of the bridge watch, caused Darrin to open his eyes, cast aside the rug and spring to his feet all in the same instant.  \"Torpedo coming on our starboard bow, sir,\" reported Mr. Andrews, turning and finding his chief at his post.  At that instant the \"Grigsby\" gave a sharp turn to port and sprang ahead under quickened speed.  Bump! Swift as the discovery had been made, quickly as the saving orders had been given, the oncoming torpedo bumped the hull of the \"Grigsby\" with a crash audible to those within a hundred feet of the point of impact. But it did not strike full on, the contact being only glancing, like that of a boat going alongside a landing stage. The watchers from the bridge saw the torpedo's wake as the deflected projectile continued on its harmless way.  \"We couldn't have had a much narrower squeak than that!\" Dave ejaculated. \"Andrews, I congratulate you.\"  \"I'm naturally interested in saving the ship, sir, and my own skin as well,\" replied Ensign Andrews with a grin.  Dave, not having taken his eyes from the faint streak on the water, called for highest speed and a complete turn. Then, ordering the rays of the searchlight to play over the water, Darrin sent the \"Grigsby\" racing, bow-on, toward the spot from which he judged the torpedo to have been launched. In the meantime Dalzell's \"Reed\" had turned her prow in the same general direction, steaming slowly after the \"Grigsby.\"  \"The Hun can't be located,\" Dave confessed, a few minutes later. \"That chap is like most of the other Hun submarine commanders. He'll launch a torpedo by stealth, but as soon as he knows the destroyer is after him he hunts depth and runs away.\"  Dave's next order was to send a wireless message, warning all mine-sweepers and other craft that an enemy submarine had been discovered in that location.  Though no word had been passed for Lieutenant Fernald, that executive officer, awakened by the bump and the abrupt change in the destroyer's course, hurried to the bridge.  \"Did you get a good rest, Fernald?\" Dave queried, half an hour later.  \"Fine, sir.\"  \"Then I am going to the chart-room to rest for a while. I got chilled dozing in that chair. Set the bell going in the chart-room if I'm wanted.\"  Then Dave slept on, without call, for a few hours, well knowing that Lieutenant Fernald could well fill his place. The first signs of dawn awakened Darrin. He sprang up, reaching for the bridge telephone.  \"All secure, sir,\" reported Fernald, from the bridge.  Dave therefore delayed long enough to make his toilet--a none too frequent luxury aboard a destroyer in the danger zone. Then, fully refreshed and ruddy, Darrin drew on his tunic and over that his sheepskin coat. Placing his uniform cap on his head he stepped out on deck before the sun had begun to rise up above the sea.  In the distance, in three different directions, as many British mine-sweepers could be seen patiently combing the seas for mines.  \"What number recovered?\" Dave signalled.  \"Three,\" replied one craft. \"Five,\" said another. \"One,\" came from the third sweeper.  \"Nine in all,\" Dave remarked to Fernald. \"We're in a mine field, then. We shall need to be vigilant.\"  The sun soon rose, strong and brilliant, only to pass behind a bank of clouds and leave the air damp and chilly. An hour later a fog settled over the English Channel, soon becoming so dense that one could not see beyond about three hundred yards.  Dave went below to a hurried breakfast. Returning, he sent Lieutenant Fernald to his meal and rest.  \"I'll remain on the bridge all day, unless this fog lifts,\" Darrin decided. He increased the number of lookouts and ordered slow speed, so that the long, narrow destroyer, capable of racing rapidly over the waves, now merely crept along.  When the watch was changed Dave barely returned the salutes of the departing and oncoming watch officers, for his whole attention was centered on the sea. Half an hour after that he started slightly, then stared hard.  Off the starboard bow he thought he made out something moving as slowly as the \"Grigsby\" herself was proceeding.  \"Pick that up, Mr. Ormsby, and see if it's anything more than a dream,\" ordered Dave, pointing.  Instantly the course of the destroyer was changed several points to starboard and speed increased a trifle.  Through the haze there soon developed the outlines of a steam craft, set low in the water, and of not more than two thousand tons. She was not a handsome craft, but, on the contrary, appeared ghostlike as she stood only half-revealed through the fog.  Undoubtedly the stranger had a lookout up forward, but no sign of one could be made out as the \"Grigsby\" gained on her.  Her markings indicated that she belonged to one of the neutral countries to the northward. The wet flag that she flew drooped so tightly around the staff that nothing could be learned from that bit of bunting.  \"One of the neutral traders,\" remarked Ensign Ormsby.  \"She must give an account of herself,\" Dave answered. \"Whatever she is, or carries, she doesn't look like a craft to be entrusted with a valuable cargo.\"  As the \"Grigsby\" ranged up alongside, an officer stepped out from the stranger's wheelhouse and came to the rail.  \"What craft is that?\" Dave demanded.  The skipper, if such he was, replied in broken English, naming a neutral country, and adding that the vessel was the \"Olga,\" bound for an English port with a cargo of wood pulp.  \"I knew she couldn't carry a costly cargo,\" Dave muttered, then commanded, through a megaphone:  \"Lie to and stand by to be inspected.\"  \"Vat?\" demanded the foreign skipper, in evident amazement.  Dave repeated the order.  \"But ve all right are,\" insisted the skipper, \"vot I told you iss our cargo.\"  \"Lie to, just the same,\" Dave commanded. \"We'll be aboard at once.\"  That made the skipper angry, but he dared not resist. The muzzles of two of the \"Grigsby's\" three-inch guns were pointed straight at him now, so the clumsy craft stopped and lay tossing on the choppy sea.  Ensign Burton and a boarding crew were told off for one of the power launches. At the last instant Dave decided to go with the party and took his place in the launch. He was first aboard the stranger when the launch had been made fast alongside.  It was now a younger officer who met him at the rail.  \"Where is your skipper?\" Darrin demanded.  \"He me has given der papers to you show,\" replied the younger officer. \"Come mit me to der cabin, please.\"  \"I must see this craft's master, and at once,\" Darrin insisted.  \"He here cannot be at dis minute,\" replied the foreign mate. \"To de cabin mit me come, please.\"  \"Your cargo is wood pulp, you say?\" Dave continued.  \"Yes, sir.\"  \"Where is it?\"  \"In our hold, already, sir,\" answered the mate.  \"Throw off that hatch,\" Dave directed, pointing. \"I am going to inspect your cargo.\"  The hatch was promptly uncovered. Leaving Burton and his men on deck, Dave descended into the hold by a ladder, followed by the mate and two of the \"Olga's\" seamen. A brief inspection proved that the hold was well filled with a cargo of wood pulp.  \"Now, you vill go to de after hold, please?\" asked the mate, as Darrin climbed up to the deck.  \"Yes,\" Dave nodded, and went aft, followed by four of his men, while Burton and the others remained forward. Here in the after hold the same kind of cargo was found. The \"Olga\" looked like a straight enough craft, but there was something in the manner of the mate that made Darrin suspicious.  Calling two of his seamen below Dave produced a tape measure.  \"Get the distance from the hatchway to the after end of this hold,\" he directed.  Then, wheeling, he noted that the mate's face had turned to a greenish color.  \"What ails you, man?\" Darrin demanded, eyeing the fellow sharply.  \"N-n-nutten, sir,\" stammered the mate.  One of the seamen reported the measurement he had taken.  \"Now, go on deck and measure aft from the hatchway,\" Dave commanded.  The instant that Darrin was left alone with the mate a pair of muscular arms encircled the throat of the young American naval commander from behind. In the same instant the mate sprang at him. The two assailants, taking him so by surprise, overcame Darrin with comparative ease. In the same moment they backed him through a small doorway opening into the hold forward.  Down on his back Dave Darrin was thrown, the skipper sitting on his chest, while the mate swiftly drew the door to and securely bolted it. In this stuffy apartment, lighted only by two swinging lanterns, Darrin realized that he must fight promptly if he expected to escape.  A steel tube was pressed against one of Dave's temples, while a hoarse, low voice proclaimed:  \"Say a vord, and you die shall!\"  It was the skipper who was holding a revolver to Darrin's head, and the returning mate bent over with an iron hatch bar in his right"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23038"],["title","Quiet Talks on the Crowned Christ of Revelation (#1)"],["body"," face looking down, and the face looking up! The one--the downward face--looked upon a cross, a Man hanging there with a mocking crown of thorns without and a breaking heart within, scowling priests, jeering crowds, deserting disciples, sneering soldiers, weeping women, heart-broken friends, a horror of darkness, a cave-tomb under imperial seal, and blackest night settling down over all.  The other--the upward face--looked upon a great burst of the upper glory, the countless angels singing swelling songs of worship, the wondrous winged cherubim, the redeemed hosts from Eden days on reverently bowing and exultantly singing, the exquisitely soft-green-rainbow-circled throne, the Father's face, once hidden, but to be hidden now never again, the _shared_ seat on the Father's throne,--what a contrast!  Here crucified--there crowned. Crucified on earth, one of the smaller globes of the universe. On the throne of the whole universe of globes--crowned! From the lowest depth to the one extreme height. From hate's worst to Love's best. From love poured out for men to love enthroned for those same men; love triumphant each time, on cross and on throne. What a contrast! What a coronation! What a welcome home to a throne!   The Music of a Name.  It is most intensely interesting to recall that, of course, this is just what the very word Christ means,--the Crowned One. We sometimes get so used to a word that it is easy to forget its real meaning. The word Christ has been used so generally for so many centuries as a _name_ that we forget that originally it was a title, and not a name.  And it still is a title, though used chiefly as a name. Some day the title-meaning will overlap the name-meaning. We may never cease thinking of it as a name, but there is a time coming when events will make the title-meaning so big as to clear over-shadow our thought and use of it as a name.  It helps to recall the distinctive meaning of the words we use for Him who walked amongst, and was one of us. Jesus is His _name_. It belongs to the _man_. It belongs peculiarly to the thirty-three years and a bit more that He was here, even though not exclusively used in that way in the Book.  There's a rare threefold sweetness of meaning in that five-lettered name. There is the meaning of the old word lying within the name, before it became a name, victory, victor, saviour-victor, Jehovah-victor. There is the swing and rhythm and murmur of music, glad joyous music, in its very beginnings as a common word.  Then it has come to stand wholly for a _personality_, the rarely gentle, winsome, strong personality of the Man of Bethlehem and Nazareth, and of those crowded service-days. And every memory of His personality sweetens and enriches the music in the old word.  And then the deepest significance, the richest rhythm, the sweetest melody, come from the meaning His experiences, His life, pressed into it. The sympathy, the suffering, the wilderness, the Cross, the Resurrection, all the experiences He went through, these give to this victory-word, Jesus, a meaning unknown before. They put the name Jesus actually above every name in the experiences of tense conflict and sweeping victory it stands for. This threefold chording makes music never to be broken nor forgotten.   \"There is no name so sweet on earth,    No name so sweet in heaven,  The name before His wondrous birth,    To Christ the Saviour given.\"  Lord is a title, of course. It was used of one who was a proprietor, an owner, or a master. It was commonly used as a title of honour for one in superior position, as a leader or teacher. In speaking of Jesus it is coupled with the title Christ as an interchangeable word,[10] as well as an additional title. But peculiarly it is the _personal title_ given Jesus by one who takes Him as his own personal Master,[11] while it still retains its broader meaning.  But _Christ_ is peculiarly _the official title_ of Jesus. There is only one Christ. Lord is used of men. It is used of both the Father and the Holy Spirit, as well as of Jesus. But the name Christ is used of only one person, and can mean only that one. There could be only one Christ.  The word or its equivalent was used occasionally in the Old Testament in a narrowed sense for the King of Israel, who is reverently spoken of as \"the Lord's anointed,\" that is, God's Messiah or Christ.[12]  But the one common thought of it among the Hebrew people, growing ever intenser as the Old Testament period merges into the time of the New, was that there was one coming, _the_ Messiah, _the_ Christ, God's chosen, the one anointed and empowered, to be their Deliverer. The one question that sets all hearts a-flutter about the rugged John of the deserts was this: \"Is he _the_ Christ?\"[13] In their thought there was only one to whom the title belonged.  And even so it is. Christ is the official title of _the One_ Chosen and anointed by God to be ruler over His Hebrew people, and over all the race, and the earth, and the universe,--God's King, to reign until all have been brought into full allegiance to the great loving Father.[14] The Christ is the Crowned One, God's Crowned One. The very word Christ tells that Christ is crowned.   Our Great Kinsman.  There is an intensely interesting question that crowds its way in here, and it proves an immensely practical question, too. _Why_ was Christ crowned? We can say at once that this was His due. He was given that which belonged to Him in good right. He was reinstated in His former position, with all the power and glory that were His before His errand to the earth.[15]  Then too this was His vindication after the shameful treatment of earth. Before the eyes of all the upper world, both loyal and disloyal eyes, this man whom earth hounded so shamelessly is vindicated; He is set right by the Father.[16]  But there is yet more than this. It is a more of a sort that concerns _us_ very closely, and it sets one's heart a-beating a bit faster. This crowning was part of a plan, a plan of which our earth is the centre. It was the second great part of a plan of which the suffering and dying were the first great part. Both were for the sake of us men and our earth-home, and the lower creation.  This is the thing being emphasized in the second great paragraph of the Hebrews.[17] Man was made the under-master of the earth and of the lower creation, but lost, weakly surrendered, his place of mastery. The new Man came to recover for man what had been lost and to realize this original lost plan.  And so He became our brother, sharer of our flesh and blood, tempted like as we, perfected in His human character by the experiences He went through, then tasted to the bitter dregs the death that belongs to our sin. And then following that, He was crowned with glory and honour. And so He rises to the place of mastery over all that belongs to perfect man. So He brings all creation into the glad subjection which is its natural happy state. It is for earth's sake, for the race's sake, and for the sake of our faithful companions and servants, the whole lower creation, that Christ has been crowned.  We think more about the personal meaning to ourselves of His having died and risen again. We need to remember, too, this broader meaning. The dying and rising secures our salvation personally. The crowning and the reigning will work out the redemption of all nature and of the lower creation,[18] and this in turn will mean much for men living on the earth in the Kingdom time, and for the race as a race.  This leads at once to another question that presses in. What is the _domain_ of the crowned Christ? If we take the crowning in the common meaning of that word, it means that there is some domain that Christ rules over. What is it that He is crowned over?  And the answer is so sweeping as to seem far-away and dreamy to us who are living on this sin-hurt earth. He is the crowned Ruler of the whole created universe and all intelligent beings in it. He has been placed over absolutely every \"rule and authority and power and dominion, and not only in this present age but in the coming age.\"[19] There is simply no limit in extent to His domain. Everything has been placed in subjection to Him and is now subject to His word, and His alone.  There is a striking passage in Philippians that fits in here.[20] In speaking of the exaltation of Jesus Christ, Paul is careful to explain particularly that every knee would bow, _in the heavens_, and, _on the earth_, and _under_ the earth or in the _world below_.  This threefold division is very striking. The heaven things are understood at once, and things of the earth sphere. But there is a third world to be taken into account, that strange uncanny world of evil spirit beings in rebellion against God's authority. It is spoken of repeatedly as principalities and powers, indicating numbers and organization, dignity, and power.[21] All of this is included in what has been placed under Christ's authority.[22]   Is Christ Reigning Now?  But there is still another question that has been impatiently pushing underneath for some time. And it also is an intensely practical one. Does this mean that Christ is actually ruling now over this domain of His? How about the affairs on the earth? Are all things here subject to Him? Is this the way He would have things go? And some of us think the evil spirits seem pretty free in their movements. This present order of things that we are living in the thick of, is this the reign of the crowned Christ? And some of us feel the stress of things so much that we can scarce keep patient for a thoughtful poised answer to our questions.  There are those, and good earnest folk they are, too, who tell us that Christ has come, and is constantly coming, more and more, into our common life. The higher ideals that are crowding for expression, the more spiritual conceptions of man and his brotherly relations, the constant striving toward better civilization, the"]]]
