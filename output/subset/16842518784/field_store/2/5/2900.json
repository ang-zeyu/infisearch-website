LII    YESTERDAY this Day's Foozling did prepare; TO-MORROW'S Slicing will not yield to Prayer:   Play! for you know not whence you came, nor why: Play! for you know not why you go, nor where.   LIII    I TELL you this--When, after youth was past, A kindly Heav'n gave me to Golf at last;   No Freedom but I gladly barter'd for The satisfying Bond that holds me fast.   LIV    AND this I know: there is a Charm about The quiet State of Golf, tho' fools may flout,   That with its magic has unlock'd the Door Of Happiness they only howl without.         *       *       *       *       *   LV    AS under cover of departing Day Slinks the defeated Duffer on his way,   Once more within the Maker's house alone I stood, surrounded by the Tools of Play.   LVI    CLUBS of all Sorts and Sizes, great and small, That stood along the floor and by the wall;   And some old batter'd Veterans were; and some Had swung perhaps, but never driv'n at all.   LVII    SAID one among them--\"Surely not for naught Tom Morris fashion'd me with anxious thought,   Has not my Form won many a Match and Cup? And yet--and yet--I am no longer bought.\"   LVIII    THEN said a Second--\"Hear the Codger croak! Sure he would make of Golf an ancient Joke;   But Me--just think! a modern Willie Park, My fickle Owner cannot sell nor soak!\"   LIX    AFTER a momentary silence spake A Brassie of a more ungainly make--   \"They sneer at me for leaning all awry: Well, then, I ask who won the last Sweepstake?\"   LX    WHEREAT some one of the loquacious Lot, I think a putting Niblick, or if not,   A driving Putter, or a goose-neck'd Cleek-- \"Pray, what is Golf then,--and the Golfer what?\"   LXI    \"WHY,\" said another, \"Some there are who say That Golf is but a Game that Golfers play,   And some that Life is but a mighty Green, And Golf the Art to use it day by day.\"   LXII    \"WELL,\" murmur'd one, \"let whoso make or buy, All in one Pickle we--like as we lie:   For let the right Good-Fellow come along, We all may lay the Ball dead by and by.\"   LXIII    SO one and one and one I heard them speak: \"Ah, Friends,\" said I, \"'tis not a Make we seek,   A Duffer arm'd with all the Clubs there be-- What is he to a Player with a Cleek?\"         *       *       *       *       *   LXIV    LATELY, agape beside the door of Fame, Sudden a Touch upon my shoulder came,   And thro' the Dusk an Angel Shape held out The greater Guerdon; and it was--the Game!   LXV    THE Game that can with Logic absolute The Dronings of the Soberheads confute,   Silence the scoffing ones, and in a trice Life's leaden metal into Gold transmute.   LXVI    INDEED, the brave Game I have loved so well Has little taught me how to buy or sell;   Has pawn'd my Greatness for an Hour of Ease, And barter'd cold Cash for--a Miracle.   LXVII    INDEED, indeed, Repentance oft before I swore--but it was Winter when I swore,   And then and then came Spring, and Club-in-hand I hasten'd forth for one Round--one Round more.   LXVIII    BUT much as Golf has play'd the Infidel, And robb'd me of my worldly Profit--Well,   I often wonder what the Grubbers earn One half so precious as the Joy they sell.   LXIX    WHAT! for a senseless Bank-Account to wreak Their manly Strength on Ledgers, till too weak   To swing a club?--So Caddies calmly tread In Mire the Ball Heav'n sent them here to seek.   LXX    WHAT! as a poor dull Drudge to waste the Force That might have made a Golfer, till the Source   Of Golf be dried--and Life grow all too brief To top a Ball around the Ladies' Course!   LXXI    YET, ah, that Golf should vanish with the green! What noble matches Winter might have seen;   And in Old Age what glorious Hazards foil'd, What Zest of painful Pleasures might have been!   LXXII    WOULD but the dim Face of old Winter yield One glimpse of green, like Youth to Age reveal'd,   Thro' which once more the failing Limbs might spring As springs the trampled Herbage of the Field.   LXXIII    AH! with the Green my fading life provide, Some ancient golfing Crony by my side:   Content to play one Round, or, meeker still, To mix a gentle Foursome satisfied.   LXXIV    THAT even the wavering Remnant of the Swing May bear some witness to my virtuous Spring,   And leave no True-believer passing-by Unedified by its Admonishing.   LXXV    WOULD but the god of Golfers ere too late Arrest the sure-advancing step of Fate,   What matter if we play the Odd or Like? Or--if we play--hole out in Four or Eight?   LXXVI    AH, let the Honor go to Fate, and let All difficulties by that Crack be met;   The Duffer still may win a Half or two, Content while Fate is only Dormie yet.   LXXVII    OR if ev'n this be taken, you and I May still fare onward calmly, honestly,   Nor care how many Down the Record stand: The Match is over--Let us play the Bye!   LXXVIII    YON rising Moon that leads us Home again, How oft hereafter will she wax and wane;   How oft hereafter rising wait for us At this same Turning--and for _One_ in vain.   LXXIX    AND when, like her, my Golfer, I have been And am no more above the pleasant Green,   And you in your mild Journey pass the Hole I made in One--ah! pay my Forfeit then!"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24022"],["title","A Christmas Carol (#1)"],["body","k, biting weather; foggy withal; and he could hear the people in the court outside go wheezing up and down, beating their hands upon their breasts, and stamping their feet upon the pavement stones to warm them. The City clocks had only just gone three, but it was quite dark already--it had not been light all day--and candles were flaring in the windows of the neighbouring offices, like ruddy smears upon the palpable brown air. The fog came pouring in at every chink and keyhole, and was so dense without, that, although the court was of the narrowest, the houses opposite were mere phantoms. To see the dingy cloud come drooping down, obscuring everything, one might have thought that nature lived hard by, and was brewing on a large scale.  The door of Scrooge's counting-house was open, that he might keep his eye upon his clerk, who in a dismal little cell beyond, a sort of tank, was copying letters. Scrooge had a very small fire, but the clerk's fire was so very much smaller that it looked like one coal. But he couldn't replenish it, for Scrooge kept the coal-box in his own room; and so surely as the clerk came in with the shovel, the master predicted that it would be necessary for them to part. Wherefore the clerk put on his white comforter, and tried to warm himself at the candle; in which effort, not being a man of strong imagination, he failed.  'A merry Christmas, uncle! God save you!' cried a cheerful voice. It was the voice of Scrooge's nephew, who came upon him so quickly that this was the first intimation he had of his approach.  'Bah!' said Scrooge. 'Humbug!'  He had so heated himself with rapid walking in the fog and frost, this nephew of Scrooge's, that he was all in a glow; his face was ruddy and handsome; his eyes sparkled, and his breath smoked again.  'Christmas a humbug, uncle!' said Scrooge's nephew. 'You don't mean that, I am sure?'  'I do,' said Scrooge. 'Merry Christmas! What right have you to be merry? What reason have you to be merry? You're poor enough.'  'Come, then,' returned the nephew gaily. 'What right have you to be dismal? What reason have you to be morose? You're rich enough.'  Scrooge, having no better answer ready on the spur of the moment, said, 'Bah!' again; and followed it up with 'Humbug!'  'Don't be cross, uncle!' said the nephew.  'What else can I be,' returned the uncle, 'when I live in such a world of fools as this? Merry Christmas! Out upon merry Christmas! What's Christmas-time to you but a time for paying bills without money; a time for finding yourself a year older, and not an hour richer; a time for balancing your books, and having every item in 'em through a round dozen of months presented dead against you? If I could work my will,' said Scrooge indignantly, 'every idiot who goes about with \"Merry Christmas\" on his lips should be boiled with his own pudding, and buried with a stake of holly through his heart. He should!'  'Uncle!' pleaded the nephew.  'Nephew!' returned the uncle sternly, 'keep Christmas in your own way, and let me keep it in mine.'  'Keep it!' repeated Scrooge's nephew. 'But you don't keep it.'  'Let me leave it alone, then,' said Scrooge. 'Much good may it do you! Much good it has ever done you!'  'There are many things from which I might have derived good, by which I have not profited, I dare say,' returned the nephew; 'Christmas among the rest. But I am sure I have always thought of Christmas-time, when it has come round--apart from the veneration due to its sacred name and origin, if anything belonging to it can be apart from that--as a good time; a kind, forgiving, charitable, pleasant time; the only time I know of, in the long calendar of the year, when men and women seem by one consent to open their shut-up hearts freely, and to think of people below them as if they really were fellow-passengers to the grave, and not another race of creatures bound on other journeys. And therefore, uncle, though it has never put a scrap of gold or silver in my pocket, I believe that it _has_ done me good and _will_ do me good; and I say, God bless it!'  The clerk in the tank involuntarily applauded. Becoming immediately sensible of the impropriety, he poked the fire, and extinguished the last frail spark for ever.  'Let me hear another sound from _you_,' said Scrooge, 'and you'll keep your Christmas by losing your situation! You're quite a powerful speaker, sir,' he added, turning to his nephew. 'I wonder you don't go into Parliament.'  'Don't be angry, uncle. Come! Dine with us to-morrow.'  Scrooge said that he would see him----Yes, indeed he did. He went the whole length of the expression, and said that he would see him in that extremity first.  'But why?' cried Scrooge's nephew. 'Why?'  'Why did you get married?' said Scrooge.  'Because I fell in love.'  'Because you fell in love!' growled Scrooge, as if that were the only one thing in the world more ridiculous than a merry Christmas. 'Good afternoon!'  'Nay, uncle, but you never came to see me before that happened. Why give it as a reason for not coming now?'  'Good afternoon,' said Scrooge.  'I want nothing from you; I ask nothing of you; why cannot we be friends?'  'Good afternoon!' said Scrooge.  'I am sorry, with all my heart, to find you so resolute. We have never had any quarrel to which I have been a party. But I have made the trial in homage to Christmas, and I'll keep my Christmas humour to the last. So A Merry Christmas, uncle!'  'Good afternoon,' said Scrooge.  'And A Happy New Year!'  'Good afternoon!' said Scrooge.  His nephew left the room without an angry word, notwithstanding. He stopped at the outer door to bestow the greetings of the season on the clerk, who, cold as he was, was warmer than Scrooge; for he returned them cordially.  'There's another fellow,' muttered Scrooge, who overheard him: 'my clerk, with fifteen shillings a week, and a wife and family, talking about a merry Christmas. I'll retire to Bedlam.'  This lunatic, in letting Scrooge's nephew out, had let two other people in. They were portly gentlemen, pleasant to behold, and now stood, with their hats off, in Scrooge's office. They had books and papers in their hands, and bowed to him.  'Scrooge and Marley's, I believe,' said one of the gentlemen, referring to his list. 'Have I the pleasure of addressing Mr. Scrooge, or Mr. Marley?'  'Mr. Marley has been dead these seven years,' Scrooge replied. 'He died seven years ago, this very night.'  'We have no doubt his liberality is well represented by his surviving partner,' said the gentleman, presenting his credentials.  [Illustration: THEY WERE PORTLY GENTLEMEN, PLEASANT TO BEHOLD]  It certainly was; for they had been two kindred spirits. At the ominous word 'liberality' Scrooge frowned, and shook his head, and handed the credentials back.  'At this festive season of the year, Mr. Scrooge,' said the gentleman, taking up a pen, 'it is more than usually desirable that we should make some slight provision for the poor and destitute, who suffer greatly at the present time. Many thousands are in want of common necessaries; hundreds of thousands are in want of common comforts, sir.'  'Are there no prisons?' asked Scrooge.  'Plenty of prisons,' said the gentleman, laying down the pen again.  'And the Union workhouses?' demanded Scrooge. 'Are they still in operation?'  'They are. Still,' returned the gentleman, 'I wish I could say they were not.'  'The Treadmill and the Poor Law are in full vigour, then?' said Scrooge.  'Both very busy, sir.'  'Oh! I was afraid, from what you said at first, that something had occurred to stop them in their useful course,' said Scrooge. 'I am very glad to hear it.'  'Under the impression that they scarcely furnish Christian cheer of mind or body to the multitude,' returned the gentleman, 'a few of us are endeavouring to raise a fund to buy the Poor some meat and drink, and means of warmth. We choose this time, because it is a time, of all others, when Want is keenly felt, and Abundance rejoices. What shall I put you down for?'  'Nothing!' Scrooge replied.  'You wish to be anonymous?'  'I wish to be left alone,' said Scrooge. 'Since you ask me what I wish, gentlemen, that is my answer. I don't make merry myself at Christmas, and I can't afford to make idle people merry. I help to support the establishments I have mentioned--they cost enough: and those who are badly off must go there.'  'Many can't go there; and many would rather die.'  'If they would rather die,' said Scrooge, 'they had better do it, and decrease the surplus population. Besides--excuse me--I don't know that.'  'But you might know it,' observed the gentleman.  'It's not my business,' Scrooge returned. 'It's enough for a man to understand his own business, and not to interfere with other people's. Mine occupies me constantly. Good afternoon, gentlemen!'  Seeing clearly that it would be useless to pursue their point, the gentlemen withdrew. Scrooge resumed his labours with an improved opinion of himself, and in a more facetious temper than was usual with him.  Meanwhile the fog and darkness thickened so, that people ran about with flaring links, proffering their services to go before horses in carriages, and conduct them on their way. The ancient tower of a church, whose gruff old bell was always peeping slyly down at Scrooge out of a Gothic window in the wall, became invisible, and struck the hours and quarters in the clouds, with tremulous vibrations afterwards, as if its teeth were chattering in its frozen head up there. The cold became intense. In the main street, at the corner of the court, some labourers were repairing the gas-pipes, and had lighted a great fire in a brazier, round which a party of ragged men and boys were gathered: warming their hands and winking their eyes before the blaze in rapture. The water-plug being left in solitude, its overflowings suddenly congealed, and turned to misanthropic ice. The brightness of the shops, where holly sprigs and berries crackled in"]]]
