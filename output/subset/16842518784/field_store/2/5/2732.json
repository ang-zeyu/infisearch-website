They'd be cutting their own throats.\"  The Freer Enterprises official shook his head, in scorn. \"That's where _you're_ wrong. The same electric appliance manufacturer who produced that razor there will make a similar one, slightly different in appearance, for the same price for us. They don't care what happens to their product once they make their profit from it. Business is business. We'll be at least as good a customer as any of the others have ever been. Eventually, better, since we'll be getting electric razors into the hands of people who never felt they could afford one before.\"  He shook a finger at Tracy. \"Manufacturers have been doing this for a long time. I imagine it was the old mail-order houses that started it. They'd get in touch with a manufacturer of, say, typewriters, or outboard motors, or whatever, and order tens of thousands of these, not an iota different from the manufacturer's standard product except for the nameplate. They'd then sell these for as little as half the ordinary retail price.\"  [Illustration]  Tracy seemed to think it over for a long moment. Eventually he said, \"Even then you're not going to break any records making money. Your distribution costs might be pared to the bone, but you still have some. There'll be darn little profit left on each razor you sell.\"  Flowers was triumphant again. \"We're not going to stop at razors, once under way. How about automobiles? Have you any idea of the disparity between the cost of production of a car and what they retail for?\"  \"Well, no.\"  \"Here's an example. As far back as about 1930 a barge company transporting some brand-new cars across Lake Erie from Detroit had an accident and lost a couple of hundred. The auto manufacturers sued, trying to get the retail price of each car. Instead, the court awarded them the cost of manufacture. You know what it came to, labor, materials, depreciation on machinery--everything? Seventy-five dollars per car. And that was around 1930. Since then, automation has swept the industry and manufacturing costs per unit have dropped drastically.\"  The Freer Enterprises executive was now in full voice. \"But even that's not the ultimate. After all, cars were selling for as cheaply as $425 then. Let's take some items such as aspirin. You can, of course, buy small neatly packaged tins of twelve for twenty-five cents but supposedly more intelligent buyers will buy bottles for forty or fifty cents. If the druggist puts out a special for fifteen cents a bottle it will largely be refused since the advertising conditioned customer doesn't want an inferior product. Actually, of course, aspirin is aspirin and you can buy it, in one hundred pound lots in polyethylene film bags, at about fourteen cents a pound, or in carload lots under the chemical name of acetylsalicylic acid, for eleven cents a pound. And any big chemical corporation will sell you U.S.P. grade Milk of Magnesia at about six dollars a ton. Its chemical name, of course, is magnesium hydroxide, or Mg(OH){2}, and you'd have one thousand quarts in that ton. Buying it beautifully packaged and fully advertised, you'd pay up to a dollar twenty-five a pint in the druggist section of a modern ultra-market.\"         *       *       *  Tracy had heard enough. He said crisply, \"All right, Mr. Flowers, of Freer Enterprises, now let me ask you something: Do you consider this country prosperous?\"  Flowers blinked. Of a sudden, the man across from him seemed to have changed character, added considerable dynamic to his make-up. He flustered, \"Yes, I suppose so. But it could be considerably more prosperous if--\"  Tracy was sneering. \"If consumer prices were brought down drastically, eh? Mr. Flowers, you're incredibly na√Øve when it comes to modern economics. Do you realize that one of the most significant developments, economically speaking, took place in the 1950s; something perhaps more significant than the development of atomic power?\"  Flowers blinked again, mesmerized by the other's new domineering personality. \"I ... I don't know what you're talking about.\"  \"The majority of employees in the United States turned from blue collars to white.\"  Flowers looked pained. \"I don't--\"  \"No, of course you don't or you wouldn't be participating in a subversive attack upon our economy, which, if successful, would lead to the collapse of Western prosperity and eventually to the success of the Soviet Complex.\"  Mr. Flowers gobbled a bit, then gulped.  \"I'll spell it out for you,\" Tracy pursued. \"In the early days of capitalism, back when Marx and Engels were writing such works as _Capital_, the overwhelming majority of the working class were employed directly in production. For a long time it was quite accurate when the political cartoonists depicted a working man as wearing overalls and carrying a hammer or wrench. In short, employees who got their hands dirty, outnumbered those who didn't.  \"But with the coming of increased mechanization and eventually automation and the second industrial revolution, more and more employees went into sales, the so-called service industries, advertising and entertainment which has become largely a branch of advertising, distribution, and, above all, government which in this bureaucratic age is largely a matter of regulation of business and property relationships. As automation continued, fewer and fewer of our people were needed to produce all the commodities that the country could assimilate under our present socio-economic system. And I need only point out that the average American _still_ enjoys more material things than any other nation, though admittedly the European countries, and I don't exclude the Soviet Complex, are coming up fast.\"  Flowers said indignantly, \"But what's this charge that I'm participating in a subversive--\"  \"Mr. Flowers,\" Tracy overrode him, \"let's not descend to pure maize in our denials of the obvious. If this outfit of yours, Freer Enterprises, was successful in its fondest dreams, what would happen?\"  \"Why, the consumers would be able to buy commodities at a fraction of the present cost!\"  Tracy half came to his feet and pounded the table with fierce emphasis. \"_What would they buy them with? They'd all be out of jobs!_\"  Frederic Flowers bug-eyed him.  Tracy sat down again and seemingly regained control of himself. His voice was softer now. \"Our social system may have its strains and tensions, Mr. Flowers, but it works and we don't want anybody throwing wrenches in its admittedly delicate machinery. Advertising is currently one of the biggest industries of the country. The entertainment industry, admittedly now based on advertising, is gigantic. Our magazines and newspapers, employing hundreds of thousands of employees from editors right on down to newsstand operators, are able to exist only through advertising revenue. Above all, millions of our population are employed in the service industries, and in distribution, in the stock market, in the commodity markets, in all the other branches of distribution which you Freer Enterprises people want to pull down. A third of our working force is now unemployed, but given your way, it would be at least two thirds.\"  Flowers, suddenly suspicious, said, \"What has all this to do with the Department of Internal Revenue, Mr. Tracy?\"  Tracy came to his feet and smiled ruefully, albeit a bit grimly. \"Nothing,\" he admitted. \"I have nothing at all to do with that department. Here is my real card, Mr. Flowers.\"  The Freer Enterprises man must have felt a twinge of premonition even as he took it up, but the effect was still enough to startle him. \"Bureau of Economic Subversion!\" he said.  \"Now then,\" Tracy snapped. \"I want the names of your higher ups, and the address of your central office, Flowers. Frankly, you're in the soup. As you possibly know, our hush-hush department has unlimited emergency powers, being answerable only to the President.\"  \"I ... I've never even heard of it.\" Flowers stuttered. \"But--\"  Tracy held up a contemptuous hand. \"Many people haven't,\" he said curtly.         *       *       *       *       *  Frank Tracy hurried through the outer office into LaVerne Sandell's domain, and bit out to her, \"Tell the Chief I'm here. Crisis. And immediately get my team together, all eight of them. Heavy equipment. Have a jet readied. Chicago. The team will rendezvous at the airport.\"  LaVerne was just as crisp. \"Yes, sir.\" She began doing things with buttons and switches.  Tracy hurried into the Chief's office and didn't bother with the usual amenities. He snapped, \"Worse than I thought, sir. This outfit is possibly openly subversive. Deliberately undermining the economy.\"  His superior put down the report he was perusing and shifted his bulk backward. \"You're sure? We seldom run into such extremes.\"  \"I know, I know, but this could be it. Possibly a deliberate program. I've taken the initiative to have Miss Sandell summon my team.\"  \"Now, see here, Frank--\" The bureau head looked at him anxiously.  Tracy said, impatience there, \"Chief, you're going to have to let your field men use their discretion. I tell you, this thing is a potential snowball. I'll play it cool. Arrange things so that there'll be no scandal for the telly-reporters. But we've got to chill this one quickly, or it'll be on a coast to coast basis before the year is out. They're even talking about going into automobiles.\"  The Chief winced, then said unhappily, \"All right, Tracy. However, mind what I said. Curb those roughnecks of yours.\"         *       *       *  It proved considerably easier than Frank Tracy had hoped for.

It was a dark cordovan brown, made even darker by long usage, which had added oily stains to the well-used leather. But Thorn thought of it as the Black Suitcase simply because it was the perfect example of the proverbial Little Black Box--the box that Did Things. As a test question in an examination, the Little Black Box performs a useful function. The examiner draws a symbolic electronic circuit. Somewhere in the circuit, instead of drawing the component that is supposed to be there, he draws a Little Black Box. Then he defines the wave-form, voltage, and amperage entering the circuit and defines whatever is coming out. Question: What is in the Little Black Box?  Except in the simplest of cases, there is never an absolute answer. The question is counted as correct if the student puts into the Little Black Box a component or subcircuit which will produce the effect desired. The value of the answer depends on the simplicity and relative controllability of the component drawn in the place of the Little Black Box.  Sorensen's Black Suitcase was still a problem to Thorn. He couldn't quite figure out what was in it.  \"Hotter'n Billy Blue Blazes!\" Sorensen said as he put the Black Suitcase down on the gleaming white ground. He grinned a little, which dispelled for a moment his Angry Old Man expression, and said: \"You ready to go, Mr. Thorn?\"  \"I'm ready any time you are,\" Thorn said grumpily.  Sorensen looked at the NAC&M scientist sideways. \"You don't sound any happier'n I am, Mr. Thorn.\"  Thorn looked at him and thought he could see that flash of odd humor in his light blue eyes. Thorn exhaled a heavy breath. \"I'm no happier than you are to be out in this heat. Let's get on with it.\"  Sorensen's chuckle sounded so out of place that Thorn was almost startled. \"You know the difference between you and me, Mr. Thorn?\" Sorensen asked. He didn't wait for an answer. \"You think this test is probably a waste of time. Me, on the other hand, I _know_ it is.\"  \"Let's get on with it,\" Thorn repeated.         *       *       *       *       *  It took two hours to set up the equipment, in spite of the fact that a lot of the circuits had been prefabricated before the caravan had come out from Salt Lake City. But Richard Thorn wanted to make certain that all his data was both correct and recorded. Sorensen had nothing to do but watch. He had no hand in setting up the equipment. He had brought the Black Suitcase, and that was all he was going to be allowed to do.  From the top of the Black Suitcase projected two one-inch copper electrodes, fourteen inches apart. The North American Carbide & Metals technicians set up the circuits that were connected to the electrodes without any help from Sorensen.  But just before they started to work, Sorensen said: \"There's just one thing I think you ought to warn those men about, Mr. Thorn.\"  \"What's that?\" Thorn asked.  \"If any of 'em tries to open that suitcase, they're likely to get blown sky high. And I don't want 'em getting funny with me, either.\"  He had his hand in his trouser pocket, and Thorn was suddenly quite certain that the man was holding a revolver. He could see the outlines against the cloth.  Thorn sighed. \"Don't worry, Mr. Sorensen. We don't have any ulterior designs on your invention.\" He did not add that the investigators of NAC&M had already assumed that anyone who was asking one million dollars for an invention which was, in effect, a pig in a poke, would be expected to take drastic methods to protect his gadget. But there would be no point in telling Sorensen that his protective efforts had already been anticipated and that the technicians had already been warned against touching the Black Suitcase any more than necessary to connect the leads. Giving Sorensen that information might make him even more touchy.  Thorn only hoped that the bomb, or whatever it was that Sorensen had put in the suitcase, was well built, properly fused, and provided with adequate safeties.  When everything was set up, Sorensen walked over to his device and turned it on by shoving the blade of a heavy-duty switch into place. \"O.K.,\" he said.  One of the technicians began flipping other switches, and a bank of ordinary incandescent light bulbs came on, four at a time. Finally there were one hundred of them burning, each one a hundred-watt bulb that glowed brightly but did not appear to be contributing much to the general brightness of the Utah sun. The technicians checked their recording voltmeters and ammeters and reported that, sure enough, some ten kilowatts of power at a little less than one hundred fifteen volts D.C. was coming from the Black Suitcase.  Sorensen and Thorn sat in the tent which had been erected to ward off the sun's rays. They watched the lights shine.         *       *       *       *       *    *       *       *       *       *  One of the technicians came in, wiping his forehead with a big blue bandana. \"Well, there she goes. Mr. Sorensen, if that thing is dangerous, hadn't we better back off a little way from it?\"  \"It isn't dangerous,\" Sorensen said. \"Nothing's going to happen.\"  The technician looked unhappy. \"Then I don't see why we couldn't've tested the thing back in the shop. Would've been a lot easier there. To say nothing of more comfortable.\"  Thorn lit a cigarette in silence.  Sorensen nodded and said, \"Yes, Mr. Siegel, it would've been.\"  Siegel sat down on one of the camp stools and lit a cigarette. \"Mr. Sorensen,\" he asked in all innocence, \"have you got a patent on that battery?\"  The humorous glint returned to Sorensen's eyes as he said, \"Nope. I didn't patent the battery in that suitcase. That's why I don't want anybody fooling around with it.\"  \"How come you don't patent it?\" Siegel asked. \"Nobody could steal it if you patented it.\"  \"Couldn't they?\" Sorensen asked with a touch of acid in his voice. \"Do you know anything about batteries, Mr. Siegel?\"  \"A little. I'm not an expert on 'em, or anything like that. I'm an electrician. But I know a little bit about 'em.\"  Sorensen nodded. \"Then you should know, Mr. Siegel, that battery-making is an art, not a science. You don't just stick a couple of electrodes into a solution of electrolyte and consider that your work is done. With the same two metals and the same electrolyte, you could make batteries that would run the gamut from terrible to excellent. Some of 'em, maybe, wouldn't hold a charge more than an hour, while others would have a shelf-life, fully charged, of as much as a year. Batteries don't work according to theory. If they did, potassium chlorate would be a better depolarizer than manganese dioxide, instead of the other way around. What you get out of a voltaic cell depends on the composition and strength of the electrolyte, the kind of depolarizer used, the shape of the electrodes, the kind of surface they have, their arrangement and spacing, and a hundred other little things.\"  \"I've heard that,\" Siegel said.         *       *       *       *       *    *       *       *       *       *    [Illustration]  Thorn smoked in silence. He had heard Sorensen's arguments before. Sorensen didn't mind discussing his battery in the abstract, but he was awfully close-mouthed when it came to talking about it in concrete terms. He would talk about batteries-in-general, but not about this-battery-in-particular.  Not that Thorn blamed him in the least. Sorensen was absolutely correct in his statements about the state of the art of making voltaic cells. If Sorensen had something new--and Thorn was almost totally convinced that he did--then he was playing it smart by not trying to patent it.  \"Now then,\" Sorensen went on, \"let's suppose that my battery is made up of lead and lead dioxide plates in a sulfuric acid solution, except that I've added a couple of trifling things and made a few small changes in the physical structure of the plates. I'm not saying that's what the battery is, mind you; I'm saying 'suppose'.\"  \"O.K., suppose,\" said Siegel. \"Couldn't you patent it?\"  \"What's to patent? The Pb-PbO_2-H_2SO_4 cell is about half as old as the United States Patent Office itself. Can't patent that. Copper oxide, maybe, as a depolarizer? Old hat; can't patent that. Laminated plates, maybe? Nope. Can't patent that, either.\"  Siegel looked out at the hundred glowing light bulbs. \"You mean you can't patent it, even if it works a hundred times better than an ordinary battery?\"  \"Hell, man,\" Sorensen said, \"you can't patent performance! You've got to patent something solid and concrete! Oh, I'll grant that a top-notch patent attorney might be able to get me some kind of patent on it, but I wouldn't trust its standing up in court if I had to try to quash an infringement.  \"Besides, even if I had an iron-bound patent, what good would it do me? Ever hear of a patent pool?\"  \"No,\" said Siegel. \"What's a patent pool?\"  \"I'll give you an example. If all the manufacturers of a single product get together and agree to form a patent pool, it means that if one company buys a patent, all of them can use it. Say the automobile companies have one. That means that if you invent a radical new design for an engine--one, maybe that would save them millions of dollars--you'll be offered a few measly thousand for it. Why should they offer more? _Where else are you going to sell it?_ If one company gets it, they all get it. There's no competition, and if you refuse to sell it at all, they just wait a few years until the patent runs out and use it for free. That may take a little time, but a big industry has plenty of time. They have a longer life span than human beings.\"  \"North American Carbide & Metals,\" said Thorn quietly, \"is not a member of any patent pool, Mr. Sorensen.\"  \"I know,\" Sorensen"]]]
