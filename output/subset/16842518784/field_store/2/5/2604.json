How about?--      \"_There'll be bread     Overhead     When you're dead--     It is said._\"         *       *       *       *       *  Phineas T. Gryce wrinkled his nostrils at the pink machine as if he smelled her insulation smoldering. He said mildly, \"A somewhat unhappy jingle, Rose, referring as it does to the end of the customer as consumer. Moreover, we shouldn't overplay the figurative 'rises through the air' angle. What inspired you?\"  She shrugged. \"I don't know--oh, yes, I do. I was remembering one of the workers' songs we machines used to chant during the Big Strike--      \"_Work and pray,     Live on hay.     You'll get pie     In the sky     When you die--     It's a lie!_  \"I don't know why we chanted it,\" she added. \"We didn't want pie--or hay, for that matter. And machines don't pray, except Tibetan prayer wheels.\"  Phineas T. Gryce shook his head. \"Labor relations are another topic we should stay far away from. However, dear Rose, I'm glad you keep trying to outjingle those dirty crooks at Fairy Bread.\" He scowled, turning back his attention to Tin Philosopher. \"I get whopping mad, Old Machine, whenever I hear that other slogan of theirs, the discriminatory one--'Untouched by Robot Claws.' Just because they employ a few filthy androids in their factories!\"  Tin Philosopher lifted one of his own sets of bright talons. \"Thanks, P.T. But to continue my historical resume, the next great advance in the baking art was the substitution of purified carbon dioxide, recovered from coal smoke, for the gas generated by yeast organisms indwelling in the dough and later killed by the heat of baking, their corpses remaining _in situ_. But even purified carbon dioxide is itself a rather repugnant gas, a product of metabolism whether fast or slow, and forever associated with those life processes which are obnoxious to the fastidious.\"  Here the machine shuddered with delicate clinkings. \"Therefore, we of Puffyloaf are taking today what may be the ultimate step toward purity: we are aerating our loaves with the noble gas helium, an element which remains virginal in the face of all chemical temptations and whose slim molecules are eleven times lighter than obese carbon dioxide--yes, noble uncontaminable helium, which, if it be a kind of ash, is yet the ash only of radioactive burning, accomplished or initiated entirely on the Sun, a safe 93 million miles from this planet. Let's have a cheer for the helium loaf!\"         *       *       *       *       *  Without changing expression, Phineas T. Gryce rapped the table thrice in solemn applause, while the others bowed their heads.  \"Thanks, T.P.,\" P.T. then said. \"And now for the Moment of Truth. Miss Winterly, how is the helium loaf selling?\"  The business girl clapped on a pair of earphones and whispered into a lapel mike. Her gaze grew abstracted as she mentally translated flurries of brief squawks into coherent messages. Suddenly a single vertical furrow creased her matchlessly smooth brow.  \"It isn't, Mr. Gryce!\" she gasped in horror. \"Fairy Bread is outselling Puffyloaves by an infinity factor. So far this morning, _there has not been one single delivery of Puffyloaves to any sales spot_! Complaints about non-delivery are pouring in from both walking stores and sessile shops.\"  \"Mr. Snedden!\" Gryce barked. \"What bug in the new helium process might account for this delay?\"  Roger was on his feet, looking bewildered. \"I can't imagine, sir, unless--just possibly--there's been some unforeseeable difficulty involving the new metal-foil wrappers.\"  \"Metal-foil wrappers? Were _you_ responsible for those?\"  \"Yes, sir. Last-minute recalculations showed that the extra lightness of the new loaf might be great enough to cause drift during stackage. Drafts in stores might topple sales pyramids. Metal-foil wrappers, by their added weight, took care of the difficulty.\"  \"And you ordered them without consulting the Board?\"  \"Yes, sir. There was hardly time and--\"  \"Why, you fool! I noticed that order for metal-foil wrappers, assumed it was some sub-secretary's mistake, and canceled it last night!\"  Roger Snedden turned pale. \"You canceled it?\" he quavered. \"And told them to go back to the lighter plastic wrappers?\"  \"Of course! Just what is behind all this, Mr. Snedden? _What_ recalculations were you trusting, when our physicists had demonstrated months ago that the helium loaf was safely stackable in light airs and gentle breezes--winds up to Beaufort's scale 3. _Why_ should a change from heavier to lighter wrappers result in complete non-delivery?\"         *       *       *       *       *  Roger Snedden's paleness became tinged with an interesting green. He cleared his throat and made strange gulping noises. Tin Philosopher's photocells focused on him calmly, Rose Thinker's with unfeigned excitement. P.T. Gryce's frown grew blacker by the moment, while Megera Winterly's Venus-mask showed an odd dawning of dismay and awe. She was getting new squawks in her earphones.  \"Er ... ah ... er....\" Roger said in winning tones. \"Well, you see, the fact is that I....\"  \"Hold it,\" Meg interrupted crisply. \"Triple-urgent from Public Relations, Safety Division. Tulsa-Topeka aero-express makes emergency landing after being buffeted in encounter with vast flight of objects first described as brown birds, although no failures reported in airway's electronic anti-bird fences. After grounding safely near Emporia--no fatalities--pilot's windshield found thinly plastered with soft white-and-brown material. Emblems on plastic wrappers embedded in material identify it incontrovertibly as an undetermined number of Puffyloaves cruising at three thousand feet!\"  Eyes and photocells turned inquisitorially upon Roger Snedden. He went from green to Puffyloaf white and blurted: \"All right, I did it, but it was the only way out! Yesterday morning, due to the Ukrainian crisis, the government stopped sales and deliveries of all strategic stockpiled materials, including helium gas. Puffy's new program of advertising and promotion, based on the lighter loaf, was already rolling. There was only one thing to do, there being only one other gas comparable in lightness to helium. I diverted the necessary quantity of hydrogen gas from the Hydrogenated Oils Section of our Magna-Margarine Division and substituted it for the helium.\"  \"You substituted ... hydrogen ... for the ... helium?\" Phineas T. Gryce faltered in low mechanical tones, taking four steps backward.  \"Hydrogen is twice as light as helium,\" Tin Philosopher remarked judiciously.  \"And many times cheaper--did you know that?\" Roger countered feebly. \"Yes, I substituted hydrogen. The metal-foil wrapping would have added just enough weight to counteract the greater buoyancy of the hydrogen loaf. But--\"  \"So, when this morning's loaves began to arrive on the delivery platforms of the walking mills....\" Tin Philosopher left the remark unfinished.  \"Exactly,\" Roger agreed dismally.  \"Let me ask you, Mr. Snedden,\" Gryce interjected, still in low tones, \"if you expected people to jump to the kitchen ceiling for their Puffybread after taking off the metal wrapper, or reach for the sky if they happened to unwrap the stuff outdoors?\"  \"Mr. Gryce,\" Roger said reproachfully, \"you have often assured me that what people do with Puffybread after they buy it is no concern of ours.\"  \"I seem to recall,\" Rose Thinker chirped somewhat unkindly, \"that dictum was created to answer inquiries after Roger put the famous sculptures-in-miniature artist on 3D and he testified that he always molded his first attempts from Puffybread, one jumbo loaf squeezing down to approximately the size of a peanut.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Her photocells dimmed and brightened. \"Oh, boy--hydrogen! The loaf's unwrapped. After a while, in spite of the crust-seal, a little oxygen diffuses in. An explosive mixture. Housewife in curlers and kimono pops a couple slices in the toaster. Boom!\"  The three human beings in the room winced.  Tin Philosopher kicked her under the table, while observing, \"So you see, Roger, that the non-delivery of the hydrogen loaf carries some consolations. And I must confess that one aspect of the affair gives me great satisfaction, not as a Board Member but as a private machine. You have at last made a reality of the 'rises through the air' part of Puffybread's theme. They can't ever take that away from you. By now, half the inhabitants of the Great Plains must have observed our flying loaves rising high.\"  Phineas T. Gryce shot a frightened look at the west windows and found his full voice.  \"Stop the mills!\" he roared at Meg Winterly, who nodded and whispered urgently into her mike.  \"A sensible suggestion,\" Tin Philosopher said. \"But it comes a trifle late in the day. If the mills are still walking and grinding, approximately seven billion Puffyloaves are at this moment cruising eastward over Middle America. Remember that a six-month supply for deep-freeze is involved and that the current consumption of bread, due to its matchless airiness, is eight and one-half loaves per person per day.\"  Phineas T. Gryce carefully inserted both hands into his scanty hair, feeling for a good grip. He leaned menacingly toward Roger who, chin resting on the table, regarded him apathetically.  \"Hold it!\" Meg called sharply. \"Flock of multiple-urgents coming in.

Customs: If bread intended for export, get export license or face prosecution. Russian Consulate in Chicago: Advise on destination of bread-lift. And some Kansas church is accusing us of a hoax inciting to blasphemy, of faking miracles--I don't know _why_.\"  The business girl tore off her headphones. \"Roger Snedden,\" she cried with a hysteria that would have dumfounded her underlings, \"you've brought the name of Puffyloaf in front of the whole world, all right! Now do something about the situation!\"  Roger nodded obediently. But his pallor increased a shade, the pupils of his eyes disappeared under the upper lids, and his head burrowed beneath his forearms.  \"Oh, boy,\" Rose Thinker called gayly to Tin Philosopher, \"this looks like the start of a real crisis session! Did you remember to bring spare batteries?\"         *       *       *       *       *  Meanwhile, the monstrous flight of Puffyloaves, filling midwestern skies as no small fliers had since the days of the passenger pigeon, soared steadily onward.  Private fliers approached the brown and glistening bread-front in curiosity and dipped back in awe. Aero-expresslines organized sightseeing flights along the flanks. Planes of the government forestry and agricultural services and 'copters bearing the Puffyloaf emblem hovered on the fringes, watching developments and waiting for orders. A squadron of supersonic fighters hung menacingly above.  The behavior of birds varied considerably. Most fled or gave the loaves a wide berth, but some bolder species, discovering the minimal nutritive nature of the translucent brown objects, attacked them furiously with beaks and claws. Hydrogen diffusing slowly through the crusts had now distended most of the sealed plastic wrappers into little balloons, which ruptured, when pierced, with disconcerting _pops_.  Below, neck-craning citizens crowded streets and back yards, cranks and cultists had a field day, while local and national governments raged indiscriminately at Puffyloaf and at each other.  Rumors that a fusion weapon would be exploded in the midst of the flying bread drew angry protests from conservationists and a flood of telefax pamphlets titled \"H-Loaf or H-bomb?\"  Stockholm sent a mystifying note of praise to the United Nations Food Organization.  Delhi issued nervous denials of a millet blight that no one had heard of until that moment and reaffirmed India's ability to feed her population with no outside help except the usual.  Radio Moscow asserted that the Kremlin would brook no interference in its treatment of the Ukrainians, jokingly referred to the flying bread as a farce perpetrated by mad internationalists inhabiting Cloud Cuckoo Land, added contradictory references to airborne bread booby-trapped by Capitalist gangsters, and then fell moodily silent on the whole topic.  Radio Venus reported to its winged audience that Earth's inhabitants were establishing food depots in the upper air, preparatory to taking up permanent aerial residence \"such as we have always enjoyed on Venus.\"         *       *       *       *       *  NewNew York made feverish preparations for the passage of the flying bread. Tickets for sightseeing space in skyscrapers were sold at high prices; cold meats and potted spreads were hawked to viewers with the assurance that they would be able to snag the bread out of the air and enjoy a historic sandwich.  Phineas T. Gryce, escaping from his own managerial suite, raged about the city, demanding general cooperation in the stretching of great nets between the skyscrapers to trap the errant loaves. He was captured by Tin Philosopher, escaped again, and was found posted with oxygen mask and submachine gun on the topmost spire of Puffyloaf Tower, apparently determined to shoot down the loaves as they appeared and before they involved his company in more trouble with Customs and the State Department.  Recaptured by Tin Philosopher, who suffered only minor bullet holes, he was given a series of mild electroshocks and returned to the conference table, calm and clear-headed as ever.  [Illustration]  But the bread flight, swinging away from a hurricane moving up the Atlantic coast, crossed a clouded-in Boston by night and disappeared into a high Atlantic overcast, also thereby evading a local storm generated by the Weather Department in a last-minute effort to bring down or at least disperse the H-loaves.  Warnings and counterwarnings by Communist and Capitalist governments seriously interfered with military trailing of the flight during this period and it was actually lost in touch with for several days.  At scattered points, seagulls were observed fighting over individual loaves floating down from the gray roof--that was all.  A mood of spirituality strongly tinged with humor seized the people of the world. Ministers sermonized about the bread, variously interpreting it as a call to charity, a warning against gluttony, a parable of the evanescence of all earthly things, and a divine joke. Husbands and wives, facing each other across their walls of breakfast toast, burst into laughter. The mere sight of a loaf of bread anywhere was enough to evoke guffaws. An obscure sect, having as part of its creed the injunction \"Don't take yourself so damn seriously,\" won new adherents.  The bread flight, rising above an Atlantic storm widely reported to have destroyed it, passed unobserved across a foggy England and rose out of the overcast only over Mittel-europa. The loaves had at last reached their maximum altitude.  The Sun's rays beat through the rarified air on the distended plastic wrappers, increasing still further the pressure of the confined hydrogen. They burst by the millions and tens of millions. A high-flying Bulgarian evangelist, who had happened to mistake the up-lever for the east-lever in the cockpit of his flier and who was the sole witness of the event, afterward described it as \"the foaming of a sea of diamonds, the crackle of God's knuckles.\"         *       *       *       *       *  By the millions and tens of millions, the loaves coasted down into the starving Ukraine. Shaken by a week of humor that threatened to invade even its own grim precincts, the Kremlin made a sudden about-face. A new policy was instituted of communal ownership of the produce of communal farms, and teams of hunger-fighters and caravans of trucks loaded with pumpernickel were dispatched into the Ukraine.  World distribution was given to a series of photographs showing peasants queueing up to trade scavenged Puffyloaves for traditional black bread, recently aerated itself but still extra solid by comparison, the rate of exchange demanded by the Moscow teams being twenty Puffyloaves to one of pumpernickel.  Another series of photographs, picturing chubby workers' children being blown to bits by booby-trapped bread, was quietly destroyed.  Congratulatory notes were exchanged by various national governments and world organizations, including the Brotherhood of Free Business Machines. The great bread flight was over, though for several weeks afterward scattered falls of loaves occurred, giving rise to a new folklore of manna among lonely Arabian tribesmen, and in one well-authenticated instance in Tibet, sustaining life in a party of mountaineers cut off by a snow slide.  Back in NewNew York, the managerial board of Puffy Products slumped in utter collapse around the conference table, the long crisis session at last ended. Empty coffee cartons were scattered around the chairs of the three humans, dead batteries around those of the two machines. For a while, there was no movement whatsoever. Then Roger Snedden reached out wearily for the earphones where Megera Winterly had hurled them down, adjusted them to his head, pushed a button and listened apathetically.  After a bit, his gaze brightened. He pushed more buttons and listened more eagerly. Soon he was sitting tensely upright on his stool, eyes bright and lower face all a-smile, muttering terse comments and questions into the lapel mike torn from Meg's fair neck.  The others, reviving, watched him, at first dully, then with quickening interest, especially when he jerked off the earphones with a happy shout and sprang to his feet.         *       *       *       *       *  \"Listen to this!\" he cried in a ringing voice. \"As a result of the worldwide publicity, Puffyloaves are outselling Fairy Bread three to one--and that's just the old carbon-dioxide stock from our freezers! It's almost exhausted, but the government, now that the Ukrainian crisis is over, has taken the ban off helium and will also sell us stockpiled wheat if we need it. We can have our walking mills burrowing into the wheat caves in a matter of hours!  \"But that isn't all! The far greater demand everywhere is for Puffyloaves that will actually float. Public Relations, Child Liaison Division, reports that the kiddies are making their mothers' lives miserable about it. If only we can figure out some way to make hydrogen non-explosive or the helium loaf float just a little--\"  \"I'm sure we can take care of that quite handily,\" Tin Philosopher interrupted briskly. \"Puffyloaf has kept it a corporation secret--even you've never been told about it--but just before he went crazy, Everett Whitehead discovered a way to make bread using only half as much flour as we do in the present loaf. Using this secret technique, which we've been saving for just such an emergency, it will be possible to bake a helium loaf as buoyant in every respect as the hydrogen loaf.\"  \"Good!\" Roger cried. \"We'll tether 'em on strings and sell 'em like balloons. No mother-child shopping team will leave the store without a cluster. Buying bread balloons will be the big event of the day for kiddies. It'll make the carry-home shopping load lighter too! I'll issue orders at once--\"         *       *       *       *       *  He broke off, looking at Phineas T. Gryce, said with"]]]
