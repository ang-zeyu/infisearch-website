The original compass consisted of a cup full of water, on which floated a thin circular board, with the needle resting on it; this was placed in a small shrine or temple in front of the helmsman, with a lantern probably fixed inside to throw light on the mysterious instrument during the night.  The most fearful oaths were administered to the initiated not to divulge the secret.  Every means, also, which craft could devise or superstition enforce was employed by the Phoenicians to prevent other people from gaining a knowledge of it, or of the mode by which their commerce beyond the Straits of Hercules was carried on, or of the currents, the winds, the tides, the seas, the shores, the people, or the harbours.  A story is told of a Phoenician vessel running herself on the rocks to prevent the Romans from finding the passage.  This secrecy was enforced by the most sanguinary code--death was the penalty of indiscretion; thus the secret of the compass was preserved from generation to generation among a few families of seamen unknown to the rest of the civilised world.  The ceremonies, especially, were kept up, though in a succession of ages they have undergone gradual alterations.  The lofty shores which form the two sides of the Straits of Gibraltar were known in ancient days as the Pillars of Hercules.  Here stood the temple of the god, and hither came the mariners before launching forth on the more perilous part of their voyage, to pay their vows, and probably to bind themselves by oaths to conceal the secrets to be revealed to them.  Perhaps in all cases the temple on shore was not visited, but, at all events, the oaths were administered to the seamen on board, ablutions were performed, and sacrifices offered up.  The introduction of Christianity did not abolish these observances, and through the ignorance and superstition of the mariners of those seas they were for century after century maintained, though the motive and origin were altogether forgotten.  A traveller, who wrote as recently as the seventeenth century, describes a ceremony which took place on board a ship in which he was sailing, when passing through the straits.  Just as the two lofty headlands were in sight on either side of the ship, an old seaman came forward with a book, and summoning all those whose names he declared not to be registered in it, made them swear that they in future voyages would compel their fellow-seamen to perform the same ceremonies in which they were about to engage.  Behind him appeared a band of veteran seamen dressed up in a variety of fantastic costumes, with a drum and other musical instruments.  These forthwith seized on all whose names were not registered as having before passed through the straits, and dragging them forward, thrust them into tubs, and soused them thoroughly with water.  No one was altogether exempt, but those who had before passed were allowed to escape a like process by the payment of a fine.  These same mariners, when they extended their voyages to the southern hemisphere, very naturally postponed the ceremony which they were in the habit of performing on passing the straits, till they crossed the line. They also, not altogether abandoning classical allusions, changed the name of their _dramatis personae_.  Hercules, who had no connection with the ocean, whatever he might have had to do with the Straits of Gibraltar, had to give place to Neptune, the long-honoured monarch of the main, and Amphitrite was introduced to keep him company.  We recognise in the duckings, the sacrificial ablutions, and in the shaving and fining, the oaths and the penalty.  When the hardy seamen of Great Britain first began to steer their ships across the line, they were undoubtedly accompanied by pilots and mariners of the Mediterranean.  These, of course, taught them the ceremonies they had been in the habit of performing.  The English, as may be supposed, made various additions and alterations suited to their rougher habits and ideas, and what at one time probably retained somewhat of the elegance of its classical origin, became the strange burlesque it now appears.  Another nautical custom still in vogue is also derived from remote antiquity.  At the present day, with doubtful propriety, in imitation of the rite of baptism, we christen a ship, as it is often called, by breaking a bottle of wine on her bows as she glides off the stocks.  The custom is of thoroughly heathen origin.  A similar ceremony was practised by the ancient Greeks when they launched a ship.  We ornament our vessels with flags; they decked theirs with garlands.  At the moment the ship was launched forth into the deep the priest of Neptune raised to his lips a goblet of wine, and after quaffing from it, he poured the remainder out as a libation to his deity.  The modern Greeks still perform the ceremony much in the manner of their ancestors.  Clearly, the custom we have of breaking a bottle of wine is derived from the libations of the ancients.  In most instances, at the present day, the ship is named at the moment she is launched by a young lady, who acts the part of the priest or priestess of old.  Of late years a religious service is usually performed at the launch of a man-of-war.  The heathen libation is not, however, omitted, and the whole ceremony presents a curious jumble of ancient and modern forms suited to the tastes of the day.  Still we are bound heartily to pray that the gallant sailors who will man the stout ship may be protected while in the performance of their duty to their country; and, still more, that they may be brought to a knowledge of the Gospel.  The Greeks invariably gave feminine names to their ships, choosing, whenever possible, appropriate ones; while the less courteous Romans bestowed masculine names on theirs.  Though we may not have followed the Greek rule, we to the present day always look upon a ship as of the feminine gender.  The mariner's compass, the most important instrument used in navigation, demands further notice.  The magnet, or loadstone, was known to the ancient Greeks many centuries before the Christian era.  The legend runs, that one Magnes a shepherd, feeding his flocks on Mount Ida, having stretched himself on the ground to sleep, left his crook, the upper part of which was made of iron, lying against a rock.  On awaking, and rising to depart, he found, when he attempted to take up his crook, that the iron adhered to the rock.  Having communicated this extraordinary fact to some neighbouring philosophers, they called the rock after the name of the shepherd, Magnes, the magnet.  The Chinese, of still more ancient date, so their traditions affirm, discovered a mountain rising out of the sea possessing an intensity of attraction so great that the nails and iron bands were drawn out of their ships, causing their immediate wreck.  Those sea-arabs whom we call Phoenicians had, at a very early date, made use of their knowledge of the property of the loadstone to turn towards the North Pole; though, like many other discoveries, as I have just mentioned, it was kept a profound secret among a select few, and concealed from the public by having an air of religious mystery thrown over it.  Lumps of loadstone formed into balls were preserved in their temples, and looked upon with awe, as possessing mystic properties.  With these round stones the point of a needle was rubbed, as often as it required fresh magnetising.  I have already described the compass used by the Phoenicians, and how, long after Islamism had gained the ascendency, it was possessed by their descendants.  At length the secret was divulged, and it came into general use among the mariners of the Mediterranean in the tenth and eleventh centuries.  Its original form was unaltered for nearly four centuries, when, in 1502, Flavio Gioja of Positano, near the town of Amalfi, on the coast of Calabria, a place celebrated for its maritime enterprise, improved upon the primitive rude and simple instrument by suspending the needle on a centre, and enclosing it in a box.  The advantages of his invention were so great that his instrument was universally adopted, and hence he gained the credit of being the inventor of the mariner's compass, of which he was only the improver.  Long before the compass was used at sea, it had been employed by the Chinese to direct the course of their caravans across the desert.  For this purpose a figure, placed in a waggon which led the caravan, was so constructed that the arm and hand moved with perfect freedom, the magnetic needle being attached to it; the hand, however, pointed to the south, the negative end being fixed in it.  The Chinese also used a needle which was freely suspended in the air, attached to a silken thread, and by this means they were able to determine the amount of the western variation of the needle.  It is possible that both the Chinese and Arabs discovered the magnetic powers of the loadstone, although the latter in their long voyages may have allowed the knowledge they possessed to have been drawn from them by the astute Chinese; or, _vice versa_, the Arabs may have obtained the knowledge which the Chinese already possessed, and kept it secret from the western nations.  We all remember the wonderful adventures of Sinbad the Sailor, as narrated in the Arabian Nights--how the ship in which he sailed was attracted by a magnetic mountain, which finally drew all the iron bolts and nails out of her.  Now it happens that the author places Sinbad's mountain in the same part of the world in which the Chinese say their magnetic mountain exists.  Ptolemy, in his geography, also describes a magnetic mountain existing in the Chinese Seas.  We may therefore, I think, come to the conclusion, that the mariner's compass was known to the ancients long before the Christian era, and that although"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23499"],["title","The Hunters' Feast: Conversations Around the Camp Fire (#1)"],["body","rst.  The contents of the hat-case were sundry brushes-- including one for the teeth--combs, razors, and pieces of soap.  The hat had been left at Saint Louis.  But the umbrella had _not_.  It was then under Thompson's arm, with its full proportions of whalebone and gingham.  Under that umbrella he had hunted tigers in the jungles of India--under that umbrella he had chased the lion upon the plains of Africa--under that umbrella he had pursued the ostrich and the vicuna over the pampas of South America; and now under that same hemisphere of blue gingham he was about to carry terror and destruction among the wild buffaloes of the prairies.  Besides the umbrella--strictly a weapon of defence--Mr Thompson carried another, a heavy double-barrelled gun, marked \"Bishop, of Bond Street,\" no bad weapon with a loading of buck-shot, and with this both barrels were habitually loaded.  So much for Mr Thompson, who may pass for Number 1 of the hunting party.  He was mounted on a strong bay cob, with tail cut short, and English saddle, both of which objects--the short tail and the saddle-- were curiosities to all of the party except Mr Thompson and myself.  Number 2 was as unlike Number 1 as two animals of the same species could possibly be.  He was a Kentuckian, full six inches taller than Thompson, or indeed than any of the party.  His features were marked, prominent and irregular, and this irregularity was increased by a \"cheekful\" of half-chewed tobacco.  His complexion was dark, almost olive, and the face quite naked, without either moustache or whisker; but long straight hair, black as an Indian's, hung down to his shoulders.  In fact, there was a good deal of the Indian look about him, except in his figure. That was somewhat slouched, with arms and limbs of over-length, loosely hung about it.  Both, however, though not modelled after the Apollo, were evidently full of muscle and tough strength, and looked as though their owner could return the hug of a bear with interest.  There was a gravity in his look, but that was not from any gravity of spirits; it was his swarth complexion that gave him this appearance, aided, no doubt, by several lines of \"ambeer\" proceeding from the corners of his mouth in the direction of the chin.  So far from being grave, this dark Kentuckian was as gay and buoyant as any of the party.  Indeed, a light and boyish spirit is a characteristic of the Kentuckian as well as of all the natives of the Mississippi Valley--at least such has been my observation.  Our Kentuckian was costumed just as he would have been upon a cool morning riding about the \"woodland\" of his own plantation, for a \"planter\" he was.  He wore a \"Jeans\" frock, and over that a long-tailed overcoat of the best green blanket, with side pockets and flaps.  His jeans pantaloons were stuck into a pair of heavy horse-leather pegged boots, sometimes known as \"nigger\" boots; but over these were \"wrappers\" of green baize, fastened with a string above the knees.  His hat was a \"broad-brimmed felt,\" costly enough, but somewhat crushed by being sat upon and slept in.  He bestrode a tall raw-boned stood that possessed many of the characteristics of the rider; and in the same proportion that the latter overtopped his companions, so did the steed out-size all the other horses of the cavalcade.  Over the shoulders of the Kentuckian were suspended, by several straps, pouch, horn, and haversack, and resting upon his toe was the butt of a heavy rifle, the muzzle of which reached to a level with his shoulder.  He was a rich Kentucky planter, and known in his native state as a great deer-hunter.  Some business or pleasure had brought him to Saint Louis. It was hinted that Kentucky was becoming too thickly settled for him-- deer becoming scarce, and bear hardly to be found--and that his visit to Saint Louis had something to do with seeking a new \"location\" where these animals were still to be met with in greater plenty.  The idea of buffalo-hunting was just to his liking.  The expedition would carry him through the frontier country, where he might afterwards choose his \"location\"--at all events the sport would repay him, and he was one of the most enthusiastic in regard to it.  He that looms up on the retrospect of my memory as Number 3 was as unlike the Kentuckian, as the latter was to Thompson.  He was a disciple of Esculapius--not thin and pale, as these usually are, but fat, red, and jolly.  I think he was originally a \"Yankee,\" though his long residence in the Western States had rubbed the Yankee out of him to a great extent.  At all events he had few of their characteristics about him.  He was neither staid, sober, nor, what is usually alleged as a trait of the true bred Yankee, \"stingy.\"  On the contrary, our doctor was full of talk and joviality--generous to a fault.  A fault, indeed; for, although many years in practice in various parts of the United States, and having earned large sums of money, at the date of our expedition we found him in Saint Louis almost without a dollar, and with no great stock of patients.  The truth must be told; the doctor was of a restless disposition, and liked his glass too well.  He was a singer too, a fine amateur singer, with a voice equal to Mario's.  That may partly account for his failure in securing a fortune.  He was a favourite with all--ladies included--and so fond of good company, that he preferred the edge of the jovial board to the bed-side of a patient.  Not from any fondness for buffalo-hunting, but rather through an attachment to some of the company, had the doctor volunteered.  Indeed, he was solicited by all to make one of us--partly on account of his excellent society, and partly that his professional services might be called into requisition before our return.  The doctor still preserved his professional costume of black--somewhat russet by long wear--but this was modified by a close-fitting fur cap, and wrappers of brown cloth, which he wore around his short thick legs. He was not over-well mounted--a very spare little horse was all he had, as his funds would not stretch to a better.  It was quite a quiet one, however, and carried the doctor and his \"medical saddle-bags\" steadily enough, though not without a good deal of spurring and whipping.  The doctor's name was \"Jopper\"--Dr John Jopper.  A very elegant youth, with fine features, rolling black eyes, and luxuriant curled hair, was one of us.  The hands were well formed and delicate; the complexion silky, and of nearly an olive tint; but the purplish-red broke through upon his cheeks, giving the earnest of health, as well as adding to the picturesque beauty of his face.  The form was perfect, and full of manly expression, and the pretty sky-blue plaited pantaloons and close-fitting jacket of the same material, sat gracefully on his well-turned limbs and arms.  These garments were of \"cottonade,\" that beautiful and durable fabric peculiar to Louisiana, and so well suited to the southern climate.  A costly Panama hat cast its shadow over the wavy curls and pictured cheek of this youth, and a cloak of fine broad cloth, with velvet facings, hung loosely from his shoulders.  A slight moustache and imperial lent a manlier expression to his chiselled features.  This young fellow was a Creole of Louisiana--a student of one of the Jesuit Colleges of that State--and although very unlike what would be expected from such a dashing personage, he was an ardent, even passionate, lover of nature.  Though still young, he was the most accomplished botanist in his State, and had already published several discoveries in the _Flora_ of the South.  Of course the expedition was to him a delightful anticipation.  It would afford the finest opportunity for prosecuting his favourite study in a new field; one as yet almost unvisited by the scientific traveller.  The young Creole was known as Jules Besancon.  He was not the only naturalist of the party.  Another was with us; one who had already acquired a world-wide fame; whose name was as familiar to the _savans_ of Europe as to his own countrymen.  He was already an old man, almost venerable in his aspect, but his tread was firm, and his arm still strong enough to steady his long, heavy, double-barrelled rifle.  An ample coat of dark blue covered his body; his limbs were enveloped in long buttoned leggings of drab cloth, and a cap of sable surmounted his high, broad forehead.  Under this his blueish grey eye glanced with a calm but clear intelligence, and a single look from it satisfied you that you were in the presence of a superior mind.  Were I to give the name of this person, this would readily be acknowledged. For certain reasons I cannot do this.  Suffice it to say, he was one of the most distinguished of modern zoologists, and to his love for the study we were indebted for his companionship upon our hunting expedition.  He was known to us as Mr A-- the \"hunter-naturalist.\" There was no jealousy between him and the young Besancon.  On the contrary, a similarity of tastes soon brought about a mutual friendship, and the Creole was observed to treat the other with marked deference and regard.  I may set myself down as Number 6 of the party.  Let a short description of me suffice.  I was then but a young fellow, educated somewhat better than common; fond of wild sports; not indifferent to a knowledge of nature; fond almost to folly of a good horse, and possessing one of the very best; not ill-looking in the face, and of middle stature; costumed in a light hunting-shirt of embroidered buckskin, with fringed cape and skirt; leggings of scarlet cloth, and cloth forage-cap, covering a flock of dark hair.  Powder-flask and pouch of tasty patterns; belt around the waist, with hunting-knife and pistols--revolvers.  A light rifle in one hand, and in the other a bridle-rein, which guided a steed of coal blackness; one that would have been celebrated in song by a troubadour of the olden time.
