The error seems to have come from the _Analytical Index of the Remembrancia_, which (p. 355) incorrectly catalogues the letter of March 31, 1602, as referring to the \"Boar's Head in Eastcheap.\" The letter itself, however, when examined, gives no indication whatever of Eastcheap, and other evidence shows conclusively that the inn was situated in Whitechapel just outside of Aldgate.]  Although Flecknoe referred to the Order of the Common Council as a \"banishment,\" it did not actually drive the players from the city. They were able, through the intervention of the Privy Council, and on the old excuse of rehearsing plays for the Queen's entertainment, to occupy the inns for a large part of each year.[3] John Stockwood, in a sermon preached at Paul's Cross, August 24, 1578, bitterly complains of the \"eight ordinary places\" used regularly for plays, referring, it seems, to the five inns and the three playhouses--the Theatre, Curtain, and Blackfriars--recently opened to the public.  [Footnote 3: See especially _The Acts of the Privy Council_ and _The Remembrancia_ of the City of London.]  Richard Reulidge, in _A Monster Lately Found Out and Discovered_ (1628), writes that \"soon after 1580\" the authorities of London received permission from Queen Elizabeth and her Privy Council \"to thrust the players out of the city, and to pull down all playhouses and dicing-houses within their liberties: which accordingly was effected; and the playhouses in Gracious Street [i.e., the Bell and the Cross Keys], Bishopsgate Street [i.e., the Bull], that nigh Paul's [i.e., Paul's singing school?], that on Ludgate Hill [i.e., the Bell Savage], and the Whitefriars[4] were quite put down and suppressed by the care of these religious senators.\"  [Footnote 4: There is some error here. The city had no jurisdiction over Whitefriars, or Blackfriars either; but there was a playhouse in Blackfriars at the time, and it was suppressed in 1584, though not by the city authorities. Possibly Reulidge should have written \"Whitechapel.\"]  [Illustration: MAP OF LONDON SHOWING THE INN-PLAYHOUSES  1. The Bell Savage; 2. The Cross Keys; 3. The Bell; 4. The Bull; 5. The Boar's Head.]  Yet, in spite of what Reulidge says, these five inns continued to be used by the players for many years.[5] No doubt they were often used surreptitiously. In _Martin's Month's Mind_ (1589), we read that a person \"for a penie may have farre better [entertainment] by oddes at the Theatre and Curtaine, and _any blind playing house_ everie day.\"[6] But the more important troupes were commonly able, through the interference of the Privy Council, to get official permission to use the inns during a large part of each year.  [Footnote 5: _The Remembrancia_ shows that the inn-playhouses remained for many years as sharp thorns in the side of the puritanical city fathers.]  [Footnote 6: Grosart, _Nash_, I, 179.]  There is not enough material about these early inn-playhouses to enable one to write their separate histories. Below, however, I have recorded in chronological order the more important references to them which have come under my observation.  1557. On September 5 the Privy Council instructed the Lord Mayor of London \"that some of his officers do forthwith repair to the Boar's Head without Aldgate, where, the Lords are informed, a lewd play called _A Sackful of News_ shall be played this day,\" to arrest the players, and send their playbook to the Council.[7]  [Footnote 7: Dasent, _Acts of the Privy Council_, VI, 168.]  1573. During this year there were various fencing contests held at the Bull in Bishopsgate.[8]  [Footnote 8: W. Rendle, _The Inns of Old Southwark_, p. 235.]  1577. In February the Office of the Revels made a payment of 10_d._ \"ffor the cariadge of the parts of ye well counterfeit from the Bell in gracious strete to St. Johns, to be performed for the play of _Cutwell_.\"[9]  [Footnote 9: A. Feuillerat, _Documents Relating to the Office of the Revels in the Time of Queen Elizabeth_, p. 277.]  1579. On June 23 James Burbage was arrested for the sum of Â£5 13_d._ \"as he came down Gracious Street towards the Cross Keys there to a play.\" The name of the proprietor of this inn-playhouse is preserved in one of the interrogatories connected with the case: \"Item. Whether did you, John Hynde, about xiii years past, in _anno_ 1579, the xxiii of June, about two of the clock in the afternoon, send the sheriff's officer unto the Cross Keys in Gratious Street, being then the dwelling house of Richard Ibotson, citizen and brewer of London,\" etc.[10] Nothing more, I believe, is known of this person.  [Footnote 10: Burbage _v._ Brayne, printed in C.W. Wallace, _The First London Theatre_, pp. 82, 90. Whether Burbage was going to the Cross Keys as a spectator or as an actor is not indicated; but the presumption is that he was then playing at the inn, although he was proprietor of the Theatre.]  1579. Stephen Gosson, in _The Schoole of Abuse_, writes favorably of \"the two prose books played at the Bell Savage, where you shall find never a word without wit, never a line without pith, never a letter placed in vain; the _Jew_ and _Ptolome_, shown at the Bull ... neither with amorous gesture wounding the eye, nor with slovenly talk hurting the ears of the chast hearers.\"[11]  [Footnote 11: Arber's _English Reprints_, p. 40.]  1582. On July 1 the Earl of Warwick wrote to the Lord Mayor requesting the city authorities to \"give license to my servant, John David, this bearer, to play his profest prizes in his science and profession of defence at the Bull in Bishopsgate, or some other convenient place to be assigned within the liberties of London.\" The Lord Mayor refused to allow David to give his fencing contest \"in an inn, which was somewhat too close for infection, and appointed him to play in an open place of the Leaden Hall,\" which, it may be added, was near the Bull.[12]  [Footnote 12: See The Malone Society's _Collections_, I, 55-57.]  1583. William Rendle, in _The Inns of Old Southwark_, p. 235, states that in this year \"Tarleton, Wilson, and others note the stay of the plague, and ask leave to play at the Bull in Bishopsgate, or the Bell in Gracechurch Street,\" citing as his authority merely \"City MS.\" The Privy Council on November 26, 1583, addressed to the Lord Mayor a letter requesting \"that Her Majesty's Players [i.e., Tarleton, Wilson, etc.] may be suffered to play within the liberties as heretofore they have done.\"[13] And on November 28 the Lord Mayor issued to them a license to play \"at the sign of the Bull in Bishopsgate Street, and the sign of the Bell in Gracious Street, and nowhere else within this City.\"[14]  [Footnote 13: See _The Remembrancia_, in The Malone Society's _Collections_, I, 66.]  [Footnote 14: C.W. Wallace, _The First London Theatre_, p. 11.]  1587. \"James Cranydge played his master's prize the 21 of November, 1587, at the Bellsavage without Ludgate, at iiij sundry kinds of weapons.... There played with him nine masters.\"[15]  [Footnote 15: _MS. Sloane_, 2530, f. 6-7, quoted by J.O. Halliwell in his edition of _Tarlton's Jests_, p. xi. The Bell Savage seems to have been especially patronized by fencers. George Silver, in his _Paradoxe of Defence_ (1599), tells how he and his brother once challenged two Italian fencers to a contest \"to be played at the Bell Savage upon the scaffold, when he that went in his fight faster back than he ought, should be in danger to break his neck off the scaffold.\"]  Before 1588. In _Tarlton's Jests_[16] we find a number of references to that famous actor's pleasantries in the London inns used by the Queen's Players. It is impossible to date these exactly, but Tarleton became a member of the Queen's Players in 1583, and he died in 1588.  [Footnote 16: First printed in 1611; reprinted by J.O. Halliwell for The Shakespeare Society in 1844.]       At the Bull in Bishops-gate-street, where the Queen's      Players oftentimes played, Tarleton coming on the stage, one      from the gallery threw a pippin at him.       There was one Banks, in the time of Tarleton, who served the      Earl of Essex, and had a horse of strange qualities; and      being at the Cross Keys in Gracious Street getting money      with him, as he was mightily resorted to. Tarleton then,      with his fellows playing at the Bell by, came into the Cross      Keys, amongst many people, to see fashions.       At the Bull at Bishops-gate was a play of Henry the Fifth.  The several \"jests\" which follow these introductory sentences indicate that the inn-yards differed in no essential way from the early public playhouses.  1588. \"John Mathews played his master's prize the 31 day of January, 1588, at the Bell Savage without Ludgate.\"[17]  [Footnote 17: _MS. Sloane_, 2530, f. 6-7, quoted by Halliwell in his edition of _Tarlton's Jests_, p. xi. There is some difficulty with the date. One of the \"masters\" before whom the prize was played was \"Rycharde Tarlton,\" whom Halliwell takes to be the famous actor of that name; but Tarleton the actor died on September 3, 1588. Probably Halliwell in transcribing the manuscript silently modernized the date from the Old Style.]  1589. In November Lord Burghley directed the Lord Mayor to \"give order for the stay of all plays within the city.\" In reply the Lord Mayor wrote:       According to which your Lordship's good pleasure, I      presently sent for such players as I could hear of; so as      there appeared yesterday before me the Lord Strange's      Players, to whom I specially gave in charge and required      them in Her Majesty's name to forbear playing until further      order might be given for their allowance in that respect.      Whereupon the Lord Admiral's Players very dutifully obeyed;      but the others, in very contemptuous manner"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22406"],["title","The Little People of the Snow (#1)"],["body","  Stood, with its huge gnarled roots of seeming strength,         Fast anchored, in the glistening bank; light sprays         Of myrtle, roses in their bud and bloom,         Drooped by the winding walks; yet all seemed wrought         Of stainless alabaster; up the trees         Ran the lithe jessamine, with stalk and leaf         Colorless as her flowers. \"Go softly on,\"         Said the snow-maiden; \"touch not, with thy hand,         The frail creation round thee, and beware         To sweep it with thy skirts. Now look above.         How sumptuously these bowers are lighted up         With shifting gleams that softly come and go!         These are the northern lights, such as thou seest         In the midwinter nights, cold, wandering flames,         That float, with our processions, through the air;         And here, within our winter palaces,         Mimic the glorious daybreak.\" Then she told         How, when the wind, in the long winter nights,         Swept the light snows into the hollow dell,         She and her comrades guided to its place         Each wandering flake, and piled them quaintly up,         In shapely colonnade and glistening arch,         With shadowy aisles between, or bade them grow         Beneath their little hands, to bowery walks         In gardens such as these, and, o'er them all,         Built the broad roof. \"But thou hast yet to see         A fairer sight,\" she said, and led the way         To where a window of pellucid ice         Stood in the wall of snow, beside their path.         \"Look, but thou mayst not enter.\" Eva looked,         And lo! a glorious hall, from whose high vault         Stripes of soft light, ruddy, and delicate green,         And tender blue, flowed downward to the floor         And far around, as if the aerial hosts,         That march on high by night, with beamy spears,         And streaming banners, to that place had brought         Their radiant flags to grace a festival.  [Illustration]  [Illustration]  [Illustration]  [Illustration]  [Illustration]  [Illustration]            And in all that hall a joyous multitude         Of those by whom its glistening walls were reared,         Whirled in a merry dance to silvery sounds,         That rang from cymbals of transparent ice,         And ice-cups, quivering to the skilful touch         Of little fingers. Round and round they flew,         As when, in spring, about a chimney-top,         A cloud of twittering swallows, just returned,         Wheel round and round, and turn and wheel again,         Unwinding their swift track. So rapidly         Flowed the meandering stream of that fair dance,         Beneath that dome of light. Bright eyes that looked         From under lily brows, and gauzy scarfs         Sparkling like snow-wreaths in the early sun,         Shot by the window in their mazy whirl.         And there stood Eva, wondering at the sight         Of those bright revellers and that graceful sweep         Of motion as they passed her;--long she gazed,         And listened long to the sweet sounds that thrilled         The frosty air, till now the encroaching cold         Recalled her to herself. \"Too long, too long         I linger here,\" she said, and then she sprang         Into the path, and with a hurried step         Followed it upward. Ever by her side         Her little guide kept pace. As on they went         Eva bemoaned her fault: \"What must they think--         The dear ones in the cottage, while so long,         Hour after hour, I stay without? I know         That they will seek me far and near, and weep         To find me not. How could I, wickedly,         Neglect the charge they gave me?\" As she spoke,         The hot tears started to her eyes; she knelt         In the mid path. \"Father! forgive this sin;         Forgive myself I cannot\"--thus she prayed,         And rose and hastened onward. When, at last,         They reached the outer air, the clear north breathed         A bitter cold, from which she shrank with dread,         But the snow-maiden bounded as she felt         The cutting blast, and uttered shouts of joy,         And skipped, with boundless glee, from drift to drift,         And danced round Eva, as she labored up         The mounds of snow, \"Ah me! I feel my eyes         Grow heavy,\" Eva said; \"they swim with sleep;         I cannot walk for utter weariness,         And I must rest a moment on this bank,         But let it not be long.\" As thus she spoke,         In half-formed words, she sank on the smooth snow,         With closing lids. Her guide composed the robe         About her limbs, and said, \"A pleasant spot         Is this to slumber in; on such a couch         Oft have I slept away the winter night,         And had the sweetest dreams.\" So Eva slept,         But slept in death; for when the power of frost         Locks up the motions of the living frame,         The victim passes to the realm of Death         Through the dim porch of Sleep. The little guide,         Watching beside her, saw the hues of life         Fade from the fair smooth brow and rounded cheek,         As fades the crimson from a morning cloud,         Till they were white as marble, and the breath         Had ceased to come and go, yet knew she not         At first that this was death. But when she marked         How deep the paleness was, how motionless         That once lithe form, a fear came over her.         She strove to wake the sleeper, plucked her robe,         And shouted in her ear, but all in vain;         The life had passed away from those young limbs.         Then the snow-maiden raised a wailing cry,         Such as a dweller in some lonely wild,         Sleepless through all the long December night,         Hears when the mournful East begins to blow.  [Illustration]  [Illustration]  [Illustration]  [Illustration]  [Illustration]            But suddenly was heard the sound of steps,         Grating on the crisp snow; the cottagers         Were seeking Eva; from afar they saw         The twain, and hurried toward them. As they came,         With gentle chidings ready on their lips,         And marked that death-like sleep, and heard the tale         Of the snow-maiden, mortal anguish fell         Upon their hearts, and bitter words of grief         And blame were uttered: \"Cruel, cruel one,         To tempt our daughter thus, and cruel we,         Who suffered her to wander forth alone         In this fierce cold.\" They lifted the dear child,         And bore her home and chafed her tender limbs,         And strove, by all the simple arts they knew,         To make the chilled blood move, and win the breath         Back to her bosom; fruitlessly they strove.         The little maid was dead. In blank despair         They stood, and gazed at her who never more         Should look on them. \"Why die we not with her?\"         They said; \"without her life is bitterness.\"  [Illustration]  [Illustration]            Now came the funeral day; the simple folk         Of all that pastoral region gathered round,         To share the sorrow of the cottagers.         They carved a way into the mound of snow         To the glen's side, and dug a little grave         In the smooth slope, and, following the bier,         In long procession from the silent door,         Chanted a sad and solemn melody.  [Illustration]            \"Lay her away to rest within the ground.         Yea, lay her down whose pure and innocent life         Was spotless as these snows; for she was reared         In love, and passed in love life's pleasant spring,         And all that now our tenderest love can do         Is to give burial to her lifeless limbs.\"            They paused. A thousand slender voices round,         Like echoes softly flung from rock and hill,         Took up the strain, and all the hollow air         Seemed mourning for the dead; for, on that day,         The little people of the snow had come,         From mountain-peak, and cloud, and icy hall,         To Eva's burial. As the murmur died,         The funeral train renewed the solemn chant.  [Illustration]            \"Thou, Lord, hast taken her to be with Eve,         Whose gentle name was given her. Even so,         For so Thy wisdom saw that it was best         For her and us. We bring our bleeding hearts,         And ask the touch of healing from Thy hand,         As, with submissive tears, we render back         The lovely and beloved to Him who gave.\"  [Illustration]  [Illustration]  [Illustration]            They ceased. Again the plaintive murmur rose.         From shadowy skirts of low-hung cloud it came,         And wide white fields, and fir-trees capped with snow,         Shivering to the sad sounds. They sank away         To silence in the dim-seen distant woods.         The little grave was closed; the funeral train         Departed; winter wore away; the spring         Steeped, with her quickening rains, the violet tufts,         By fond hands planted where the maiden slept.         But, after Eva's burial, never more         The Little People of the Snow were seen         By human eye, nor ever human ear         Heard from their lips, articulate speech again;         For a decree went forth to cut them off,         Forever, from communion with mankind.         The winter clouds, along the mountain-side,         Rolled downward toward the vale, but no fair form         Leaned from their folds, and, in the icy glens,         And aged woods, under snow-loaded pines,         Where once they made their haunt, was emptiness.  [Illustration]  [Illustration]  [Illustration]            But ever, when the wintry days drew near,         Around that little grave, in the long night,         Frost-wreaths were laid and tufts of silvery rime         In shape like blades and blossoms of the field,         As one would scatter flowers upon a bier.
