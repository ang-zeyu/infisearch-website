Why did you get so crusty when I sprang the idea of doing the wreck scene in his flower beds to-night?\"  \"Because the idea was too kiddish,\" returned Dick. \"Besides, Old Dut was talking to me a good deal along such lines.\"  \"Did you go and tell him what I wanted to do?\" flared Greg.  \"I didn't. But Old Dut pinned me down and asked me whether that book throwing were really an accident, and I had to admit that it wasn't. Now, listen!\"  Dick thereupon repeated his conversation with Principal Jones.  \"He's a wise man, all right,\" nodded Harry Hazelton.  \"I guess so,\" nodded Dave Darrin. \"After all, it would look rather kiddish in us to go slipping up to his front yard in the dark night, lifting off his front gate and carrying it down to the river.\"  \"It would be stealing, or wasting, property, also,\" agreed Tom Reade.  \"So, fellows,\" resumed Dick, \"I guess----\"  \"Hullo! What's going on down there?\" broke in Darrin hastily, as all six of the Grammar School boys looked ahead.  A woman's scream had caught their ear.  \"It's Mrs. Dexter,\" muttered Hazelton.  \"And that rascally husband of hers,\" added Greg Holmes.  \"Some new row, of course,\" broke in Dan Dalzell.  \"It's a shame!\" burst from Dick.  \"That Dexter fellow ought to be hung,\" growled Tom Reade. \"He's always bothering that woman, and she's one of the nicest ever. But now he won't let her alone, just because her grandfather had to die and leave Mrs. Dexter a lot of money.\"  The little city of Gridley was quite familiar with the domestic troubles of the Dexters. The woman was young and pretty, and good-hearted. Abner Dexter, on the other hand, was good-looking and shiftless. He had married Jennie Bolton because he believed her family to be wealthy, and Dexter considered himself too choice for work. But the Bolton money had all belonged to the grandfather, who, a keen judge of human nature, had guessed rightly the nature of Abner Dexter and had refused to let him have any money.  Dexter had left his wife and little daughter some two years before the opening of this story. Three months before old man Bolton had died, leaving several hundred thousand dollars to Mrs. Dexter. Then Dexter had promptly reappeared. But Mrs. Dexter no longer wanted this shiftless, extravagant man about, and had told him so plainly. Dexter had threatened to make trouble, and the wife had thereupon gone to court and had herself appointed sole guardian of her little daughter. At the same time she had turned some money over to her husband--common report said ten thousand dollars--on his promise to go away and not bother her again.  Plainly he had not kept his word. As Dick and his chums glanced down the quiet side street they saw husband and wife standing facing each other. The man was scowling, the woman half-tearful, half-defiant. Behind her, in her left hand, Mrs. Dexter held a small handbag.  \"I'd like to be big enough to be able to enjoy the pleasure of thrashing a fellow like that Dexter!\" growled Dave Darrin, his eyes flashing.  \"There's a man standing a little way below the pair,\" announced Dick. \"I wonder what he's doing, for he seems to be watching the couple intently. I hope he's on Mrs. Dexter's side.\"  Unconsciously Dick and his friends had halted to watch the proceedings ahead of them.  \"No, I won't,\" replied Mrs. Dexter sharply, to something that her husband had said.  Abner Dexter talked rapidly, a black scowl on his face meanwhile.  \"No, you won't! You don't dare!\" replied the woman, her voice sounding as though she had summoned all her courage by an effort.  Dexter suddenly sprang closer to the woman. The next instant both were struggling for possession of the little black bag that she carried.  \"Stop!\" cried Mrs. Dexter desperately. \"Help! He-lp!\"  \"Fellows, I don't know that we're bound to stand for that,\" muttered Dick Prescott quickly. \"She's calling for help. Come along.\"  Dick was off down the street like a streak, the others following, though Dave was closest to his chum.  \"Here, what are you doing, mister?\" demanded Dick, as he darted up to where the pair were struggling.  Dexter would have had the bag in his own possession by this time, had he not turned to see what the onrush of boys meant.  \"None of your business what I'm doing,\" he replied savagely. \"You schoolboys run along out of this.\"  \"Don't go! Help me,\" pleaded the woman. \"He's trying to rob me!\"  \"You boys clear out, or it will be worse for you!\" growled Dexter.  \"The lady wins!\" Dick announced coolly, though he was shaking somewhat from excitement. \"You let go of her and her property.\"  But Dexter, his face black with scowls, still clutched tightly with his right hand at the little handbag, to which Mrs. Dexter was clinging with both her hands.  \"You let go of that bag,\" challenged Dick, \"or six of us will sail into you. I think we can handle you. We'll try, anyway.\"  \"Yes; make him let go,\" begged Mrs. Dexter. \"I have money and jewels here, and he is trying to take them away from me.\"  \"Going to do as the lady wishes?\" inquired Dick, stepping closer.  Abner Dexter shot another angry glare at the sextette of Grammar School boys. They were closing in around him, and it looked as though they meant business.  \"Gus!\" called Dexter sharply.  The man who had been standing a short distance away now ran up to the spot.  \"Hullo, what do you want!\" asked Dick coolly. \"Are you the understudy in this game of robbery?\"  \"I'm an officer,\" retorted the fellow sharply.  \"Secretary to some Chinese laundry company, eh?\" jeered Dick.  \"I'm a police officer,\" retorted the man sharply, at the same time displaying a shield.  That put a different look on matters with some of young Prescott's friends. Dick, however, was a boy not easily daunted.  \"If you're an officer,\" he inquired, \"why don't you get busy and do your duty? Here's a man trying to rob his wife, just because she happens to have more money than he has.\"  \"A man can't legally steal from his wife, nor a woman from her husband,\" retorted the policeman bullyingly. \"There is no crime being committed here. But if you boys try to interfere you'll be disturbing the peace, and I'll run you all in.\"  Mrs. Dexter looked bewildered and frightened. She even let go of the handbag with one hand. Dick saw this, and quickly broke in:  \"Mrs. Dexter, don't you let Mr. Dexter have that handbag unless you want to do it. We'll stand by you.\"  \"Oh, will you?\" glared the policeman. \"You boys run along, or I'll gather you all in.\"  \"Where are you a policeman?\" inquired Dick Prescott, eyeing the fellow with interest. \"You're not a Gridley officer, for I know every one of them.\"  \"Never you mind where I'm from,\" jeered the man harshly. \"I'm a policeman. That'll have to be enough for you youngsters. If you don't trot fast down the street I'll gather you in.\"  Some of Dick's chums were now inclined to feel that they had broken in at the wrong place, but not so their young leader.  \"You haven't any right to make arrests in Gridley,\" retorted Dick defiantly. \"And, even if you had, you couldn't stop us from defending a woman. Tom, you and Greg stand by me. Dave, you lead the rest. We'll make Dexter let go of his wife's property and let her alone. If this man who says he's an officer interferes, Greg, Tom and I will devote our attention to him!\"  \"Great!\" snarled Dexter jeeringly. \"You're all young jailbirds!\"  \"Are you going to let go of Mrs. Dexter's property?\" challenged Dick.  \"I'm not.\"  \"Come on, fellows--let's sail into him.\"  Dick was an able general, having his small force under good discipline. There was a sudden rush of boys. True, they averaged only thirteen years of age, but there were six of them, and they were determined.  Dexter let go of the handbag in a hurry. He had to do so, in order to defend himself.  At the same moment the man named as \"Gus\" jumped into the fray.  \"Three to each man!\" yelled Dick, and thus the force was divided.  The self-styled policeman reached out with the flat of his hand, knocking Greg Holmes off his feet. But, as he did so, Dick dropped down in front of the man, wrapping both arms around the fellow's knees. Then Dick rose. It required the exertion of all his strength, but he succeeded in toppling Gus over onto his back.  At the same time Abner Dexter was having all he could do, for three very determined schoolboys were assailing him. At last Dexter turned to retreat, but Dan Dalzell thrust a foot before him and tripped him.  \"All down!\" yelled Dan. \"Set 'em up in the other alley!\"  Though downed for the moment, the two men were disposed to make a livelier fight of it than ever. It was a brisk, picturesque, rough-and-tumble fight that followed, in which the young boys got a deal of rough handling.  Frightened, yet fascinated, Mrs. Dexter tottered against the fence and stood looking on.  Things might yet have fared badly with Dick and his friends had not a newcomer arrived on the scene. He came running, and proved to be Policeman Whalen in uniform.  \"Here! What's on?\" demanded the Gridley officer. \"Let up on kicking them boys! I want you!\"  With that Whalen, who was a big and powerful man, grabbed Abner Dexter by the coat collar and pulled him to his feet. With this prisoner in tow, he moved up and seized Gus in similar fashion.  \"Now, what's the row?\" demanded Officer Whalen.  \"Arrest these boys for assault!\" quivered Dexter in a passion.  \"Yes, arrest them!\" insisted Gus. \"I'm an officer, too, and I was trying to take them in.\"  \"You didn't seem to be having very good luck at it,\" grinned Whalen. \"But I know these boys, and they're all good lads.\"  \"Arrest them, just the same! They were assaulting me,\" insisted Dexter angrily.  \"And what were you doing?\" insisted Whalen wonderingly.  \"He was trying to steal jewels and money from his wife,\" interposed Dick Prescott.  \"Bah!\""]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22323"],["title","Impressions of South Africa (#1)"],["body",", and kept its Cabinet (in which, however, men of Dutch blood are a minority) in power. Party feeling, both inside and outside the legislature, became, and has remained, extremely strong on both sides. The English generally have rallied to and acclaim Mr. Rhodes, whose connection with Dr. Jameson's expedition has made him the special object of Dutch hostility. There is, according to the reports which reach England, no longer any moderating third party: all are violent partisans. Nevertheless--and this is a remarkable and most encouraging fact--this violence did not diminish the warmth with which the whole Assembly testified its loyalty and affection towards the Queen on the occasion of the completion of the sixtieth year of her reign in 1897. And the Bond Ministry of Mr. Schreiner proposed and carried by a unanimous vote a grant of £30,000 per annum as a contribution by the Colony to the naval defence of the Empire, leaving the application of this sum to the unfettered discretion of the British Admiralty.  In the Orange Free State the explosion of Dutch sentiment was still stronger. Its first result was seen in the election of a President. In November, 1895, two candidates for the vacant office had come forward, and their chances were deemed to be nearly equal. When the news of the Jameson expedition was received, the chance of the candidate of British stock vanished. Since then, though there was not (so far as I gather) down till the last few weeks any indication of hostility to Britain, much less any social friction within the State, a disposition to draw closer to the threatened sister Republic showed itself at once. This led to the conclusion of a defensive alliance between the Free State and the Transvaal, whereby either bound itself to defend the other, if unjustly attacked. (The Transvaal is believed to have suggested, and the Free State to have refused, a still closer union.) As the Orange Free State had no reason to fear an attack, just or unjust, from any quarter, this was a voluntary undertaking on its part, with no corresponding advantage, of what might prove a dangerous liability, and it furnishes a signal proof of the love of independence which animates this little community.  We come now to the Transvaal itself. In that State the burgher party of constitutional reform was at once silenced, and its prospect of usefulness blighted. So, too, the Uitlander agitation was extinguished. The Reform leaders were in prison or in exile. The passionate anti-English feeling, and the dogged refusal to consider reforms, which had characterized the extreme party among the Boers, were intensified. The influence of President Kruger, more than once threatened in the years immediately preceding, was immensely strengthened.  The President and his advisers had a golden opportunity before them of using the credit and power which the failure of the Rising and the Expedition of 1895 had given them. They ought to have seen that magnanimity would also be wisdom. They ought to have set about a reform of the administration and to have proposed a moderate enlargement of the franchise such as would have admitted enough of the new settlers to give them a voice, yet not enough to involve any sudden transfer of legislative or executive power. Whether the sentiment of the Boers generally would have enabled the President to extend the franchise may be doubtful; but he could at any rate have tried to deal with the more flagrant abuses of administration. However, he attempted neither. The abuses remained, and though a Commission reported on some of them, and suggested important reforms, no action was taken. The weak point of the Constitution (as to which see p. 152) was the power which the legislature apparently possessed of interfering with vested rights, and even with pending suits, by a resolution having the force of law. This was a defect due, not to any desire to do wrong, but to the inexperience of those who had originally framed the Constitution, and to the want of legal knowledge and skill among those who had worked it, and was aggravated by the fact that the legislature consisted of one Chamber only, which was naturally led to legislate by way of resolution (besluit) because the process of passing laws in the stricter sense of the term involved a tedious and cumbrous process of bringing them to the knowledge of the people throughout the country. Upon this point there arose a dispute with the Chief Justice which led to the dismissal of that official and one of his colleagues, a dispute which could not be explained here without entering upon technical details. There is no reason to think that the President's action was prompted by any wish to give the legislature the means of wronging individuals, nor has evidence been produced to show that its powers have been in fact (at least to any material extent) so used. The matter cannot be fairly judged without considering the peculiar character of the Transvaal Constitution, for which the President is nowise to blame, and the statements often made in this country that the subjection of the judiciary to the legislature destroys the security of property are much exaggerated, for property has been, in fact, secure. It was, nevertheless, an error not to try to retain a man so much respected as the Chief Justice, and not to fulfil the promise given to Sir Henry de Villiers (who had been invoked as mediator) that the judiciary should be placed in a more assured position.  The idea which seems to have filled the President's mind was that force was the only remedy. The Republic was, he thought, sure to be again attacked from within or from without; and the essential thing was to strengthen its military resources for defence, while retaining political power in the hands of the burghers. Accordingly, the fortifications already begun at Pretoria were pushed on, a strong fort was erected to command Johannesburg, and munitions of war were imported in very large quantities, while the Uitlanders were debarred from possessing arms. Such precautions were natural. Any government which had been nearly overthrown, and expected another attack, would have done the like. But these measures of course incensed the Uitlanders, who saw that another insurrection would have less chance of success than the last, and resented the inferiority implied in disarmament, as Israel resented the similar policy pursued by the Philistine princes. The capitalists also, an important factor by their wealth and by their power of influencing opinion in Europe, were angry and restless, because the prospect of securing reforms which would reduce the cost of working the gold reefs became more remote.  This was the condition of things in the two Republics and the British Colonies when the diplomatic controversy between the Imperial Government and the South African Republic, which had been going on ever since 1895, passed in the early summer of 1899 into a more acute phase. The beginning of that phase coincided, as it so happened, with the expiry of the period during which the leaders of the Johannesburg rising of 1895 had promised to abstain from interference in politics, and the incident out of which it grew was the presentation to the Queen (in March 1899), through the High Commissioner, of a petition from a large number of British residents on the Witwatersrand complaining of the position in which they found themselves. The situation soon became one of great tension, owing to the growing passion of the English in South Africa and the growing suspicion on the part of the Transvaal Boers. But before we speak of the negotiations, let us consider for a moment what was the position of the two parties to the controversy.  The position of the Transvaal Government, although (as will presently appear) it had some measure of legal strength, was, if regarded from the point of view of actual facts, logically indefensible and materially dangerous. It was not, indeed, the fault of that Government that the richest goldfield in the world had been discovered in its territory, nor would it have been possible for the Boers, whatever they might have wished, to prevent the mines from being worked and the miners from streaming in. But the course they took was condemned from the first to failure. They desired to have the benefit of the gold-mines while yet retaining their old ways of life, not seeing that the two things were incompatible. Moreover, they--or rather the President and his advisers--committed the fatal mistake of trying to maintain a government which was at the same time undemocratic and incompetent. If it had been representative of the whole mass of the inhabitants it might have ventured, like the governments of some great American cities, to disregard both purity and efficiency. If, on the other hand, it had been a vigorous and skilful government, giving to the inhabitants the comforts and conveniences of municipal and industrial life at a reasonable charge, the narrow electoral basis on which it rested would have remained little more than a theoretic grievance, and the bulk of the people would have cared nothing for political rights. An exclusive government may be pardoned if it is efficient, an inefficient government if it rests upon the people. But a government which is both inefficient and exclusive incurs a weight of odium under which it must ultimately sink; and this was the kind of government which the Transvaal attempted to maintain. They ought, therefore, to have either extended their franchise or reformed their administration. They would not do the former, lest the new burghers should swamp the old ones, and take the control out of Boer hands. They were unfit to do the latter, because they had neither knowledge nor skill, so that even had private interests not stood in the way, they would have failed to create a proper administration. It was the ignorance, as well as the exclusive spirit of the Transvaal authorities, which"]]]
