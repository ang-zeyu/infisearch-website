But it soon became clear that if the Moslems were to hold their own with their neighbours (still more if they meant to hold their neighbours' own) they must learn how to navigate; and accordingly, in the first century of the Hijra, we find the Khalif 'Abd-el-Melik instructing his lieutenant in Africa to use Tunis as an arsenal and dockyard, and there to collect a fleet. From that time forward the Mohammedan rulers of the Barbary coast were never long without ships of some sort. The Aghlabī princes sailed forth from Tunis, and took Sicily, Sardinia, and Corsica. The Fātimī Khalifs waged war with the navies of 'Abd-er-Rahmān, the Great Khalif of Cordova, at a strength of two hundred vessels a side. The Almohades possessed a large and capacious fleet, in which they transported their armies to Spain, and their successors in North Africa, though less powerful, were generally able to keep up a number of vessels for offensive as well as commercial purposes.  During the later Middle Ages the relations between the rulers of the Barbary coast--the kings of Tunis, Tilimsān, Fez, &c.--and the trading nations of Christendom were amicable and just. Treaties show that both parties agreed in denouncing and (so far as they could) suppressing piracy and encouraging mutual commerce. It was not till the beginning of the sixteenth century that a change came over these peaceful conditions, and the way it happened was this.  When the united wisdom of Ferdinand and Isabella resolved on the expatriation of the Spanish Moors, they forgot the risk of an exile's vengeance.[1] No sooner was Granada fallen than thousands of desperate Moors left the land which for seven hundred years had been their home, and, disdaining to live under a Spanish yoke, crossed the strait to Africa, where they established themselves at various strong points, such as Shershēl, Oran, and notably at Algiers, which till then had hardly been heard of. No sooner were the banished Moors fairly settled in their new seats than they did what anybody in their place would have done: they carried the war into their oppressors' country. To meet the Spaniards in the open field was impossible in their reduced numbers, but at sea their fleetness and knowledge of the coasts gave them the opportunity of reprisal for which they longed.  Science, tradition, and observation inform us that primitive man had certain affinities to the beast of prey. By superior strength or ingenuity he slew or snared the means of subsistence. Civilized man leaves the coarsest forms of slaughter to a professional class, and, if he kills at all, elevates his pastime to the rank of sport by the refining element of skill and the excitement of uncertainty and personal risk. But civilized man is still only too prone to prey upon his fellows, though hardly in the brutal manner of his ancestors. He preys upon inferior intelligence, upon weakness of character, upon the greed and upon the gambling instinct of mankind. In the grandest scale he is called a financier; in the meanest, a pickpocket. This predatory spirit is at once so ancient and so general, that the reader, who is, of course, wholly innocent of such reprehensible tendencies, must nevertheless make an effort to understand the delights of robbery considered as a fine art. Some cynics there are who will tell us that the only reason we are not all thieves is because we have not pluck enough; and there must certainly be some fascination, apart from natural depravity or original sin, to make a man prefer to run countless risks in an unlawful pursuit sooner than do an honest day's work. And in this sentence we have the answer: It is precisely the risk, the uncertainty, the danger, the sense of superior skill and ingenuity, that attract the adventurous spirit, the passion for sport, which is implanted in the vast majority of mankind.  Our Moorish robbers had all this, and more, to attract them. Brave and daring men they had shown themselves often before in their tussles with the Spaniards, or in their wild sea courses and harryings of Christian shores, in Sardinia, perhaps, or Provence; but now they pursued a quest alluring beyond any that had gone before, a righteous vengeance upon those who had banished them from house and home, and cast them adrift to find what new anchorage they might in the world--a Holy War against the slaughterers of their kith and kin, and the blasphemers of their sacred Faith. What joy more fierce and jubilant than to run the light brigantine down the beach of Algiers and man her for a cruise in Spanish waters? The little ship will hold but ten oars a side, each pulled by a man who knows how to fight as well as to row--as indeed he must, for there is no room for mere landsmen on board a _firkata_. But if there be a fair wind off the land, there will be little rowing; the big lateen sail on her one mast will span the narrow waters between the African coast and the Balearic Isles, where a convenient look-out may be kept for Spanish galleons or perhaps an Italian polacca. Drawing little water, a small squadron of brigantines could be pushed up almost any creek, or lie hidden behind a rock, till the enemy hove in sight. Then oars out, and a quick stroke for a few minutes, and they are alongside their unsuspecting prey, and pouring in their first volley. Then a scramble on board, a hand-to-hand scuffle, a last desperate resistance on the poop, under the captain's canopy, and the prize is taken, the prisoners ironed, a jury crew sent on board, and all return in triumph to Algiers, where they are received with acclamations.  Or it might be a descent on the shores of their own beloved Andalusia. Then the little vessels are run into the crevices between the rocks, or even buried in the sand, and the pirates steal inland to one of the villages they know so well, and the loss of which they will never cease to mourn. They have still friends a-many in Spain, who are willing enough to help them against the oppressor and to hide them when surprised. The sleeping Spaniards are roused and then grimly silenced by the points of swords; their wives and daughters are borne away on the shoulders of the invaders; everything valuable is cleared; and the rovers are soon sailing merrily into the roads at Algiers, laden with spoil and captives, and often with some of the persecuted remnant of their race, who thankfully rejoin their kinsmen in the new country. To wreak such vengeance on the Spaniard added a real zest to life.  [Illustration: CARAVEL OF THE FIFTEENTH CENTURY.  (_Jurien de la Gravière._)]  With all their skill and speed, their knowledge of the coasts, and the help of their compatriots ashore, there was still the risk of capture. Sometimes their brigantines \"caught a Tartar\" when they expected an easy victim, and then the Moors found the tables turned, and had to grace their captors' triumph, and for years, perhaps for ever, to sit on the banks of a Venetian or Genoese galley, heavily chained, pulling the infidel's oar even in the chase of the true believers, and gazing to satiety upon the weals which the lash kept raw on the bare back of the man in front. But the risk added a zest to the Corsair's life, and the captive could often look forward to the hope of recapture, or sometimes of ransom by his friends. The career of the pirate, with all its chances, was a prosperous one. The adventurers grew rich, and their strong places on the Barbary coast became populous and well garrisoned; and, by the time the Spaniards began to awake to the danger of letting such troublesome neighbours alone, the evil was past a cure. For twenty years the exiled Moors had enjoyed immunity, while the big Spanish galleys were obstinately held in port, contemptuous of so small a foe. At last Don Pedro Navarro was despatched by Cardinal Ximenes to bring the pirates to book. He had little difficulty in taking possession of Oran and Bujēya; and Algiers was so imperfectly fortified, that he imposed his own terms. He made the Algerines vow to renounce piracy; and, to see that they kept their word, he built and garrisoned a strong fort, the \"Peñon de Alger,\"[2] to stop their boats from sallying forth. But the Moors had still more than one strong post on the rocky promontories of Barbary, and having tasted the delights of chasing Spaniards, they were not likely to reform, especially as the choice lay between piracy and starvation. Dig they would not, and they preferred to beg by force, like the \"gentlemen of the road.\" So they bided their time, till Ferdinand the Catholic passed away to his account, and then, in defiance of the Peñon, and reckless of all the pains and penalties of Spanish retribution, they threw up their allegiance, and looked about for allies.  Help was not far off, though in this case it meant mastery. The day of the Moorish pirates was over; henceforth they might, and did, triumphantly assault and batter Spanish and Venetian ships, but they would do this under the captaincy of the allies they had called in, under the leadership of the Turkish Corsairs. The Moors had shown the way, and the Corsairs needed little bidding to follow it.  FOOTNOTES:  [1] See S. Lane-Poole, _The Story of the Moors in Spain_, 232-280.  [2] Algiers is in Arabic, Al-Gezaïr (\"the Islands\"), said to be so called from that in its bay; or, more probably, Al-Gezaïr is a grammarian's explanation of the name Tzeyr or Tzier, by which the Algerians commonly called their city, and which is, I suspect, a corruption of the Roman city _Caesarea_ (Augusta), which occupied almost the same site. It should be remarked that the Algerians pronounce the _gīm_ hard: not Al-Jezaīr. Europeans spelt the name in all sorts of ways: Arger, Argel, Argeir, Algel, &c., down to the French Alger and our Algiers.     II.  THE LAND OF THE CORSAIRS.

But the dream was soon to be snapt.  One evening Alan came home to find his wife much worse than she had ever been.  He learnt the cause.  She had been sitting with a sick person, and from the hot, sickroom had passed out into the damp evening air.  And this was the result.  The village-doctor was sent for at once; and when, on the next morning, Alan anxiously, tremblingly, asked him the candid truth, it was with an open letter in his hand, with which his fingers nervously played.  It was marked \"On Her Majesty's Service.\"  He must hold himself in readiness to sail within a fortnight.  And the doctor's answer was a fearful crowning to this unexpected tidings.  \"She may linger on for a month,\" he said, \"six weeks at most.  You will have to bid her good-bye for ever when you go.  No skill can make her live till you come home.\"  Alan never uttered a word, but his face was very pale, and a great shudder passed over his frame.  \"It is very, very sad for you,\" said the little doctor, \"I pity you from my heart.\"  And then he jolted away down the lane in his shaky trap, drawn by his broken-winded pony.  And Alan turned into the farm, and was soon by his wife's side.  So the fortnight passed, and the good-bye was said; and this is why that good-bye was so unutterably sad; and this is all that Harry could not understand.     CHAPTER III.  SAD INFORMATION.  Mother and son--Returning fortitude--Self-devoted.   It was drawing close upon the half-yearly examination at the Grammar School, and Harry was beginning to grow very frightened and nervous, for a new boy had been put into his class since the last examination, and he feared the newcomer would supplant him, and get to the head.  So, as soon as the sad good-bye, told of in the first chapter of this little tale, was said, and Harry had tried in vain to comfort his mother, he got his books and set to work.  And the clock ticked, and Harry pored over his delectus; and in the corner Mrs Campbell sat and wept.  Presently she called Harry to her.  \"Harry, dear, I am better now; I won't cry any more.  Come and sit by me.\"  And so Harry went.  And then she talked quietly to him about his work at school, and how she hoped that one day he would be able to go to Oxford.  It was well for her, poor thing, she had these little makeshifts for conversation.  That which lay nearest her heart, was now too much well-nigh for words to express.  \"You are young now, dear boy, but still old enough to know that your after-life depends on yourself; and if you work steadily on, you can win a scholarship.\"  \"What is a scholarship, mamma?\"  \"A sum of money, dear, which is allowed you every year while you are at Oxford, to help to pay your expenses.  Because, you know, papa couldn't afford to pay all the money it would cost while you were there.\"  \"And why couldn't you pay it, mamma?\"  \"I shall not be here then, dear boy,\" said Mrs Campbell, very softly.  \"But you will be wherever I am, mamma.\"  \"I shall be sleeping in the churchyard, darling boy; over yonder, under the tall, grey tower.\"  Harry burst out impetuously:  \"No, you shan't die, mamma!  Why should you die?  I won't let you go!\"  And Harry sobbed as though his heart would break.  For his sake, Mrs Campbell seemed to win strength and quietness.  And taking him gently by the hand she led him upstairs to bed, sat by him till he was heavily asleep, his face all stained with tears, and then went wearily downstairs again, took her writing desk, and began a letter to her husband.     CHAPTER IV.  WILTON SCHOOL.  The examination--Wilton school--Harry's class-room--Absorbed--Prized possessions--Too busy--Cribbing--Misplaced sympathy--Harry blushes.   The morning sun shone brightly over Wilton as Harry started to school; brightly over the dancing waters of the roadstead; and the seawind sang gaily through the wave-washed piles of the pier.  The school-bell was ringing lustily as Harry passed through the iron gates into the playground.  Everything was in bustle and confusion.  Bats and balls were laid aside; jackets thrust on hastily; rough heads smoothed by hot hands.  From their different house-doors the masters were emerging, putting on, as they came, gowns, some brand-new, some rusty and worn. The whole stream was setting in one and the same direction, towards the doors of the school-buildings.  And by the time the bell's last clang had ceased, masters and boys were duly assembled in their respective places in the big school-room.  Prayers over, Dr Palmer announced, amid breathless silence, the regulations respecting the examination, which was unexpectedly to begin, in part, that morning.  Who does not remember those anxious, nervous days, before the examination; the anticipation worse, if possible, than the actual realisation; the visions of questions unanswered, translations sent up full of mistakes, sums that never would come out right, problems that never would be proved?  For the first few days questions, to be answered on paper, would be set to the whole school according to their respective work and classes.  On the fifth day the examiner would arrive; he would commence at the bottom of the school, and, taking two classes each day, examine them _vivâ voce_.  This was the substance of Dr Palmer's speech; and then the business of the morning began.  The different classes and their masters filed away into their particular rooms, Dr Palmer and the senior form being left alone in the big school-room.  The greater portion of the school-buildings, it should be stated, had been converted some years ago from the remains of an old monastery. Standing on a slight eminence, and backed by a deep belt of firs, broad meadows sloped from it, straight down to a grey shingly beach, where the boys used to bathe.  Three sides only had left their ruins behind; and these were accordingly rebuilt, as closely after the original style as was possible.  There was the shadowy row of cool cloisters, edging the square smooth-shaven plot of grass, which no boy was allowed to cross.  Then all round the building above the cloisters were various class-rooms; and at the end of one wing stood the chapel, and at the other, the big school-room.  Harry's class-room was in one corner, and consequently was darker than most of the others; but this the boys liked in the summer; it was such a contrast after the glaring sun that streamed in through the windows of the big school-room.  And Harry's place, too, in the room, he specially liked; close to the window, he could look out, through its ivied frame, across the smooth green lawn, away down the meadows to the distant sea.  And who can wonder that the sight of the heaving billows brought thoughts of his father to him many a time and oft?  But many a time, too, those dreams were snapt by the voice of Mr Prichard, his master--  \"Campbell, attend to your work;\" or, \"Campbell, don't look out of the window;\" or, when in a facetious mood, \"Campbell, you cannot learn your delectus by the light of nature.\"  But this morning, Harry was far too occupied to stare about.  Not that he was thinking specially of what his mother had told him the night before, that she would soon be gone away from him; childlike, he had almost forgotten that, or at any rate the examination, for the time being, absorbed his whole attention.  And like us all, he could not realise the sorrow his mother's words conveyed.  Who of us, indeed, does not feel, even when standing over the grave of some dear one dead, even when decking the green mound with flowers--feel it is well-nigh impossible fully to realise that those hands, now laid white beneath the mould, will never again be clasped in ours on earth.  So it is no wonder that Harry was in his usual good spirits; with this only difference, that the examination into whose depths he had now plunged, was filling him with nervous excitement and terrified interest.  Each boy had a desk and stool to himself, and to the little boys the desk-key was a proud possession.  The sixteen desks were ranged in even rows, Mr Prichard's being at the opposite end, it so happened, to Harry's place.  By Harry sat Egerton the new boy, the dreaded rival; and as they bent, side by side, over their desks, their pens and inky fingers scrambling as hard as possible over their papers, many eyes were turned upon them, to see which appeared to be getting on best.  Harry himself was too busy to take any notice of Egerton; and the morning was half-gone, and he had scarcely looked from his desk.  But a sudden impulse or wish to rest awhile, made him pause and lay down his pen.  And this is what met his eyes.  Mr Prichard was standing with his back to the boys, writing some directions on the class notice-board, not hurrying himself, and quite lost in what he was doing.  He was an absent man, was Mr Prichard.  All the boys were busy writing, or scratching their heads (a process commonly supposed to assist meditation), save one, and that was Egerton.  But he was not idle.  He was busy, a great deal too much so.  In his lap lay an open book.  His desk, of course, concealed this from Mr Prichard, and from the rest of the room, except Harry; who, as he sat in the same row with him, alone could see; for Egerton's jacket, carefully pulled forward, screened his proceedings from the boy on his other side.  His eyes were greedily fixed on the book; then he would write a little, then look again, then write again.  He was cribbing.  Harry was so thunderstruck that he stared open-mouthed at him.  Just then he heard Mr Prichard's voice, sterner than usual: \"Campbell, what are you looking at, sir?\"  Poor Harry's heart sank within him.  He could not, would not, tell; that would be sneaking.  And yet he knew from the way in which Mr Prichard spoke that he suspected him of looking over Egerton's paper.  The fact was, Mr Prichard had turned round suddenly, and catching Harry's eyes strained eagerly in the direction of"]]]
