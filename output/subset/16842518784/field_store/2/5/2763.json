Being hungry, the small boy, thrusting his cold hands deep into his empty trouser-pockets, turned his fat little face and round blue eyes full on the window, and stared at the tarts and pies like a famishing owl.  Being poor--so poor that he possessed not the smallest coin of the realm--he stared in vain; and, being light of heart as well as stout of limb, he relieved his feelings by whistling at the food with inexpressible energy.  The air selected by the young musician was Jim Crow--a sable melody high in public favour at that time--the familiar strains of which he delivered with shrill and tuneful precision, which intensified as he continued to gaze, until they rose above the din of cabs, vans, and 'busses; above the house-tops, above the walls of the great cathedral, and finally awakened the echoes of its roof, which, coming out, from the crevices and cornices where they usually slept, went dancing upwards on the dome, and played around the golden cross that glimmered like a ghost in the dark wintry sky.  The music also awakened the interest of a tall policeman whose beat that night chanced to be St. Paul's Churchyard.  That sedate guardian of the night, observing that the small boy slightly impeded the thoroughfare, sauntered up to him, and just as he reached that point in the chorus where Mr Crow is supposed to wheel and turn himself about, spun him round and gave him a gentle rap on the head with his knuckles, at the same time advising him to move on.  \"Oh!\" exclaimed the small boy, looking up with an expression of deep concern on his countenance, as he backed off the pavement, \"I _hope_ I didn't hurt you, bobby; I _really_ didn't mean to; but accidents will happen, you know, an' if you won't keep your knuckles out of a feller's way, why--\"  \"Come,\" muttered the policeman, \"shut up your potato-trap for fear you catch cold.  Your mother wants you; she's got some pap ready for you.\"  \"Ha!\" exclaimed the small boy, with his head a little on one side, as though he were critically inspecting the portrait of some curious animal, \"a prophet it is--a blue-coated prophet in brass buttons, all but choked with a leather stock--if not conceit.  A horacle, six fut two in its stockin's.  I say, bobby, whoever brought you up carried you up much too high, both in body and notions.  Wot _wouldn't_ they give for 'im in the Guards, or the hoss-marines, if he was only eight inches wider across the shoulders!\"  Seeing that the policeman passed slowly and gravely on without condescending to take further notice of him, the small boy bade him an affectionate farewell; said that he would not forget to mention him favourably at head-quarters, and then continued his progress through the crowded streets at a smart pace, whistling Jim Crow at the top of his shrill pipe.  The small boy had a long walk before him; but neither his limbs, spirits, nor lips grew weary by the way.  Indeed, his energies seemed to increase with every step, if one might judge from the easy swagger of his gait, and the various little touches of pleasantry in which he indulged from time to time; such as pulling the caps over the eyes of boys smaller than himself, winking at those who were bigger, uttering Indian war-whoops down alleys and lanes that looked as if they could echo, and chaffing all who appeared to be worthy of his attentions. Those eccentricities of humour, however, did not divert his active mind from the frequent and earnest study of the industrial arts, as these were exhibited and exemplified in shop-windows.  \"Jolly stuff that, ain't it?\" observed another small boy, in a coat much too long for him, as they met and stopped in front of a chocolate-shop at the top of Holborn Hill, where a steam-engine was perpetually grinding up such quantities of rich brown chocolate, that it seemed quite unreasonable, selfish, and dog-in-the-manger-ish of the young man behind the counter to stand there, and neither eat it himself, nor let anyone else touch it.  \"Yes, it's very jolly stuff,\" replied the first small boy, regarding his questioner sternly.  \"I know you'd like some, wouldn't you?  Go in now an' buy two pen'orth, and I'll buy the half from you w'en you come out.\"  \"_Walker_!\" replied the boy in the long coat.  \"Just so; and I'd advise you to become a walker too,\" retorted the other; \"run away now, your master's bin askin' after you for half an hour, _I_ know, and more.\"  Without waiting for a reply, the small boy (our small boy) swaggered away whistling louder than ever.  Passing along Holborn, he continued his way into Oxford Street, where the print-shop windows proved irresistibly attractive.  They seemed also to have the effect of stimulating his intellectual and conceptive faculties, insomuch that he struck out several new, and, to himself, highly entertaining pieces of pleasantry, one of which consisted of asking a taciturn cabman, in the meekest of voices:  \"Please, sir, you couldn't tell me wot's o'clock, could you?\"  The cabman observed a twinkle in the boy's eye; saw through him; in a metaphorical sense, and treated him with silent contempt.  \"Oh, I beg pardon, sir,\" continued the small boy, in the same meek tone, as he turned to move humbly away; \"I forgot to remember that cabbies don't carry no watches, no, nor _change_ neither, they're much too wide awake for that!\"  A sudden motion of the taciturn cabman caused the small boy to dart suddenly to the other side of the crowded street, where he resumed his easy independent air, and his interrupted tune.  \"Can you direct me to Nottin' Hill Gate, missus?\" he inquired of an applewoman, on reaching the neighbourhood of Tottenham Court Road.  \"Straight on as you go, boy,\" answered the woman, who was busying herself about her stall.  \"Very good indeed,\" said the small boy, with a patronising air; \"quite correctly answered.  You've learnt geography, I see.\"  \"What say?\" inquired the woman, who was apparently a little deaf.  \"I was askin' the price o' your oranges, missus.\"  \"One penny apiece,\" said the woman, taking up one.  \"They ain't biled to make 'em puff out, are they?\"  To this the woman vouchsafed no reply.  \"Come, missus, don't be cross; wot's the price o' yer apples now?\"  \"D'you want one?\" asked the woman testily.  \"Of course I does.\"  \"Well, then, they're two a penny.\"  \"Two a penny!\" cried the small boy, with a look of surprise; \"why, I'd 'a said they was a penny apiece.  Good evenin', missus; I never buys cheap fruit--cheap and nasty--no, no; good evenin'.\"  It seemed as if the current of the small boy's thoughts had been diverted by this conversation, for he walked for some time with his eyes cast on the ground, and without whistling, but whatever the feelings were that might have been working in his mind, they were speedily put to flight by a facetious butcher, who pulled his hat over his eyes as he passed him.  \"Now then, pig-sticker, what d'ye mean by that?\" he shouted, but as the butcher walked on without deigning to reply, he let off his indignation by yelling in at the open door of a tobacco-shop and making off at a brisk run.  From this point in his progress, he became still more hilarious and daring in his freaks, and turned aside once or twice into narrow streets, where sounds of shouting or of music promised him fresh excitement.  On turning the corner of one of those streets, he passed a wide doorway, by the side of which was a knob with the word FIRE in conspicuous letters above it, and the word BELL below it.  The small boy paused, caught his breath as if a sudden thought had struck him, and glanced round.  The street was comparatively quiet; his heart beat high; he seized the bell with both hands, pulled it full out, and bolted!  Now it chanced that one of the firemen of the station happened to be standing close to the door, inside, at the time.  He, guessing the meaning of the ring at once, darted out and gave chase.  The small boy fled on the wings of terror, with his blue eyes starting from their sockets.  The fireman was tall and heavy, but he was also strong and in his prime, so that a short run brought him up with the fugitive, whom he seized with a grip of iron.  \"Now, then, young bottle-imp, what did you mean by that?\"  \"Oh! please, sir,\" gasped the small boy, with a beseeching look, \"I _couldn't_ help it.\"  There was such a tone of truthfulness in this \"_couldn't_\" that it tickled the fireman.  His mouth relaxed in a quiet smile, and, releasing his intended victim, he returned to the station, while the small boy darted away in the direction of Oxford Street.  He had scarcely reached the end of the street, however, when a man turned the corner at full speed and ran him down--ran him down so completely that he sent him head-over-heels into the kennel, and, passing on, darted at the fire-bell of the station, which he began to pull violently.  The man was tall and dishevelled, partially clad in blue velvet, with stockings which had once been white, but were now covered from garter to toe with mud.  One shoe clung to his left foot, the other was fixed by the heel in a grating over a cellar-window in Tottenham Court Road. Without hat or coat, with his shirt-sleeves torn by those unfortunates into whose arms he had wildly rushed, with his hair streaming backwards, his eyes blood-shot, his face pale as marble, and perspiration running down his cheeks, not even his own most intimate friends would have recognised Hopkins--the staid, softspoken, polite, and gentle Hopkins-- had they seen him that night pulling like a maniac at the fire-bell.  And, without doubt, Hopkins _was_ a maniac that night--at least he was afflicted with temporary insanity!    CHAPTER THREE.  FIRE!!!  \"Hallo, that'll do, man!\" cried the same stalwart fireman who had seized the small boy, stepping out and laying his hand on Hopkins's shoulder, whereabouts is it?  Hopkins heard him not.

If you went down to the beach, however,--close under the fishing village of Sunland--you found that there was just enough of light to make the darkness visible.  Tremendous waves came rolling madly into the bay, their white crests gleaming against the black sky until they came down like thunder on the sand.  The wind roared and whistled over the bay, cutting off the foam-tops of the billows, and hurling them against the neighbouring cliffs.  Mingled rain and hail filled the shrieking blast, and horrid uproar seemed to revel everywhere.  \"God have mercy on those at sea,\" was uttered by many a lip that night. It was a most suitable prayer!  Some there were, doubtless, who uttered it with a little shudder as they turned in their beds, but said and did nothing more.  Others there were, weak in body perhaps, but strong in spirit, who reflected, with some degree of comfort, that they had given of their gold to help those whose business it is to help the perishing. And there were others who had little gold to give, but who gladly gave their strong, stalwart bodies, and risked their precious lives to save the perishing.  Many of these last were on the beach at Sunland that night, with oilskin coats and caps, cowering in the lee of boats and rocks, or leaning against the furious gale as they tried to gaze out to sea through the blinding sleet and spray.  Among these fishermen were two young men--tall and strong--who seemed to despise shelter, and stood at the very edge of the raging sea.  One was a black-bearded man of the Coastguard.  The other, as his dress betokened, was a Jack-tar of the Royal Navy.  \"There, she shows a light,\" said the naval youth, as a flame, like that of a blazing tar-barrel, shot suddenly up against the dark sky and showed the rigging of a wreck, far out in the bay where the war of wind and waves was fiercest.  Scarcely had this light appeared when the Coastguardsman laid his hand on the young sailor's shoulder and pointed towards the cliffs far away to the left of the bay.  There a rocket had cut the heavens with a line of vivid fire.  While they gazed, another sprang up into the sky.  \"A vessel on the rocks!\" said the Coastguardsman, (he had to shout in the other's ear, so loud was the gale); \"my duty lies there.  Will you go with me, or stay to see the lifeboat start?\"  \"I'll stick by the lifeboat,\" shouted the man-of-war's man, and they parted.  Ah! it was grand to see that lifeboat go into action.  She could be easily seen, though the night was so dark, for she was painted pure white and bright blue, with a scarlet strip round her--a \"thing of light,\" but by no means a light thing!  She was so large, and stout, and heavy, that she required a strong carriage on four wheels to transport her from her boat-house to the edge of the sea, which foamed, and hissed, and leaped up at her bow as if to taste the morsel which it hoped soon to swallow.  While the boat was yet on its carriage, her stout coxswain, or captain, clambered in.  \"Now then, my jolly volunteers,\" he shouted, \"jump up, and on wi' your life-belts.\"  At that word our handsome young sailor laid his hands on the edge of the boat and vaulted into her as if he had been made of india-rubber.  Ten more men followed his example, and quickly put on their belts.  \"Nobody's allowed to go off without a life-belt,\" said the coxswain to the young sailor, \"besides, it's against rules to let you go.\"  \"How's that?\" asked the youth; \"you called for volunteers.\"  \"Yes, but our volunteer-crew is already made up, so you must jump out. Thank you all the same, my fine fellow.\"  The man-of-war's man was too well disciplined to think of resistance, even for a moment.  With a look of disappointment and an active bound, he leaped out upon the sand.  At that moment one of the men raised an oar, which was blown round by a sudden blast, and its end struck another of the crew on the temple, rendering him almost insensible.  He had to be put out at once, and another volunteer was called for.  Like a flash of light, our youthful seaman again vaulted into the boat.  His services were now accepted, and a cork life-belt was given to him, which he quickly put on.  Meanwhile crowds of men, and even some women and boys, stood ready at the launching-ropes.  The word was given.  There was a strong and a long pull altogether, and the lifeboat sprang into the sea as if it had been alive, with her crew seated and the oars out.  A huge wave caught her bow and raised her up almost perpendicular.  She seemed as if about to dance a reel upon her rudder.  Our man-of-war's man had rode in many a wild sea, but never before had he seen the like of that.  Nevertheless, he clung to his seat like a limpet, and pulled at his oar with all his might.  The others were more accustomed to that special work.  Just as she seemed about to topple over, the boat dropped forward and plunged out to sea.  The next wave caught her in the same way, but with less power.  Another stroke of the short, stout oars, and they had got fairly off into deep water.  Then did the heart of the young sailor beat wildly, for, besides rejoicing in that fierce struggle with the storm, he knew that his mission was one of mercy as well as danger.  But how much more wildly did his heart beat when he reached the wreck, and, by the light of the blazing tar-barrel, beheld about twenty human beings--some of them women and children--clinging to the wreck, which was buried in foaming water by every sea.  One by one they were got into the lifeboat with great difficulty.  Then the boat was pushed off and rowed towards the land.  What a deep-toned shout there was on shore when her light form was dimly seen coming in on the crest of a great billow!  And what a mighty cheer rang out when she drew closer, and the man at the bow-oar stood up and cried, \"Thank God, _all_ saved!\"  Just then a monster wave fell on the stern of the boat and filled it. One little girl was swept overboard and went away with the backward rush of water, as the boat was hauled out of danger.  Every one saw this, and a terrible cry went up, but only one man moved.  Our young sailor sprang after the child.  He knew that it was almost certain death to enter that surf without a rope, but a spirit of self-sacrifice--founded on the great example of Jesus--urged him on.  He had no time to think--only to act.  He caught the child and was dragged along with her into the wild sea.  At that moment another Coastguardsman, who chanced to be a friend of the man-of-war's man, came upon the scene.  Seeing what had occurred, he seized the end of a rope which some men had just brought down, tied it round his waist, dashed into the sea, caught the sailor and the girl in the wide grasp of his strong arms--and then all three were hauled to the land in safety.  The poor child was nearly insensible, and had to be carried to a neighbouring cottage; and the young sailor staggered so from exhaustion that his friend and another man were obliged to support him as he went.  \"Who is he?\" inquired one of the fisherwomen, as she followed behind.  The Coastguardsman looked over his shoulder with a proud glance in his sparkling eye, and said aloud, \"His name is Richard Thorogood.\"  A statement which was received with three loud and ringing cheers.    CHAPTER THREE.  But what of the wreck under the Sunland cliffs, which had sent up rocket-signals of distress on that same dismal night?  When our Coastguardsman with the black beard reached the scene, he found, as he had expected, that his comrades of the Coastguard had not been idle.  They had brought down the famous rocket apparatus, with which so many lives are saved every year on our stormy shores.  The wreck was in a very different position from that in the bay. Instead of being far away from shore, among rolling billows that raged over the flat sands, this vessel, a brig, lay hard and fast among the rocks, not a hundred yards from the foot of the cliffs.  Against these frowning cliffs the wild waves thundered as if they wished to beat them down.  Failing in that, they fell back and seemed to go mad with disappointment; leaping, hissing, and whirling among the rocks on which the brig had been cast.  The brig was so near, that the men on shore could see the forms of her crew as they clung to the rigging, frantically waving their arms and sending up shrieks of despair and loud cries for help.  Truly there was urgent need for help, for the sea broke over the vessel so furiously that it was evident she must soon go to pieces.  There was only one little spot of partial shelter at the foot of the cliffs where man could stand on that fearful night.  Here the men of the Coastguard had set up the rocket apparatus.  The rocket was in position, and about to be fired, when our black-bearded Coastguardsman arrived. The light was applied.  Suddenly the group of spray-washed men, and a few pale-faced spectators who had ventured to descend, and part of the overhanging cliffs, burst into intense light as the great rocket went out to sea with a wild roar.  It was like a horrid fiery serpent, and carried a line tied to its tail!  It plunged into the waves, and all was dark again, but there was no cheer from the wreck.  The aim had not been good, and the rocket-line had missed its mark.  \"Fetch another! look alive!\" shouted our black-bearded friend, as he seized, set up, and aimed a second rocket.  Again the light burst forth, and the rocket sprang out in the teeth of the gale.  It fell beyond the brig, and the line caught in the rigging! The wrecked crew seemed to understand what was required of them, for they immediately began to haul on the rocket-line.  To the shore-end of it was fastened, by the men on the rocks, a block or pulley with a double or endless line, called a \"whip,\" through it.  When the men in the brig had hauled this block on board they fastened it to the stump of the main mast.  Then the rescuers on shore tied a thick cable or"]]]
