Walpole's friends always justified his treatment of Chesterfield by asserting that Chesterfield was one of a party who were caballing against the minister at the time of the excise scheme, and while Chesterfield was a member of the Government.  Chesterfield, it was declared, used actually to attend certain private meetings and councils of Walpole's enemies to concert measures against him.  There is nothing incredible or even unlikely in this; but even if it were utterly untrue, we may assume that sooner or later Walpole would have got rid of Chesterfield.  {9} Walpole's besetting weakness was that he could not endure any really capable colleague.  The moment a man showed any capacity for governing, Walpole would appear to have made up his mind that that man and he were not to govern together.  [Sidenote: 1733--Walpole's animosity]  Walpole made a clean sweep of the men in office whom he believed to have acted against him.  He even went so far as to deprive of their commissions in the army two peers holding no manner of office in the Administration, but whom he believed to have acted against him.  To strengthen himself in the House of Lords he conferred a peerage on his attorney-general and on his solicitor-general.  Philip Yorke, the Attorney-general, became Lord Hardwicke and Chief-justice of the King's Bench; Charles Talbot was made Lord Chancellor under the title of Lord Talbot.  Both were men of great ability.  Hardwicke stood higher in the rank at the bar than Talbot, and in the ordinary course of things he ought to have had the position of Lord Chancellor.  But Talbot was only great as a Chancery lawyer, and knew little or nothing of common law, and it would have been out of the question to make him Lord Chief-justice.  So Walpole devised a characteristic scheme of compromise.  Hardwicke was induced to accept the office of Lord Chief-justice on the salary being raised from 3000 pounds to 4000 pounds, and with the further condition that an additional thousand a year was to be paid to him out of the Lord Chancellor's salary.  This curious transaction Walpole managed through the Queen, and the Queen managed to get the King to regard it as a clever device of his own mention.  It is worth while to note that the only charge ever made against Hardwicke by his contemporaries was a charge of avarice; he was stingy even in his hospitality, his enemies said--a great offence in that day was to be parsimonious with one's guests; and malignant people called him Judge Gripus.  For aught else, his public and private character were blameless.  Hardwicke was the stronger man of the two; Talbot the more subtle and {10} ingenious.  Both were eloquent pleaders and skilled lawyers, each in his own department.  Hervey says that \"no one could make more of a good cause than Lord Hardwicke, and no one so much of a bad cause as Lord Talbot.\"  Hardwicke lived to have a long career of honor, and to win a secure place in English history.  Lord Talbot became at once a commanding influence in the House of Lords. \"Our new Lord Chancellor,\" the Earl of Strafford, England's nominal and ornamental representative in the negotiation for the peace of Utrecht, writes to Swift, \"at present has a great party in the House.\"  But the new Lord Chancellor did not live long enough for his fame.  He was destined to die within a few short years, and to leave the wool-sack open for Lord Hardwicke.  [Sidenote: 1734--The Patriots]  The House of Commons has hardly ever been thrilled to interest and roused to passion by a more heated, envenomed, and, in the rhetorical sense, brilliant debate than that which took place on March 13, 1734. The subject of the debate was the motion of a country gentleman, Mr. William Bromley, member for Warwick, \"that leave be given to bring in a bill for repealing the Septennial Act, and for the more frequent meeting and calling of Parliaments.\"  The circumstances under which this motion was brought forward gave it a peculiar importance as a party movement.  Before the debate began it was agreed, upon a formal motion to that effect, \"that the Sergeant-at-arms attending the House should go with the mace into Westminster Hall, and into the Court of Bequests, and places adjacent, and summon the members there to attend the service of the House.\"  The general elections were approaching; the Parliament then sitting had nearly run its course.  The Patriots had been making every possible preparation for a decisive struggle against Walpole.  They had been using every weapon which partisan hatred and political craft could supply or suggest.  The fury roused up by the Excise Bill had not yet wholly subsided.  Public opinion still throbbed and heaved like a sea the morning after a storm.  {11} The Patriots had been exerting their best efforts to make the country dissatisfied with Walpole's foreign policy.  The changes were incessantly rung upon the alleged depredations which the Spaniards were committing on our mercantile marine.  Long before the time for the general elections had come, the Patriot candidates were stumping the country.  Their progress through each county was marked by the wildest riots.  The riots sometimes called for the sternest military repression.  On the other hand, the Patriots themselves were denounced and discredited by all the penmen, pamphleteers, and orators who supported the Government on their own account, or were hired by Walpole and Walpole's friends to support it. So effective were some of these attacks, so damaging was the incessant imputation that in the mouths of the Patriots patriotism meant nothing but a desire for place and pay, that Pulteney and his comrades found it advisable gradually to shake off the name which had been put on them, and which they had at one time willingly adopted.  They began to call themselves \"the representatives of the country interest.\"  The final struggle of the session was to take place on the motion for the repeal of the Septennial Act.  We have already given an account of the passing of that Act in 1716, and of the reasons which in our opinion justified its passing.  It cannot be questioned that there is much to be said in favor of the principle of short Parliaments, but in Walpole's time the one great object of true statesmanship was to strengthen the power of the House of Commons; to enable it to stand up against the Crown and the House of Lords.  It would be all but impossible for the House of Commons to maintain this position if it were doomed to frequent and inevitable dissolutions.  Frequent dissolution of Parliament means frequently recurring cost, struggle, anxiety, wear and tear, to the members; and; of course, it meant all this in much higher measure during the reign of George the Second than it could mean in the reign of Victoria.  Walpole had {12} devoted himself to the task of strengthening the representative assembly, and he was, therefore, well justified in resisting the motion made by Mr. Bromley on March 13, 1734, for the repeal of the Septennial Act.  Our interest now, however, is not so much with the political aspect of the debate as with its personal character.  One illustration of the corruption which existed at the time may be mentioned in passing.  It was used as an argument against long Parliaments, but assuredly at that day it might have been told of short Parliaments as well.  Mr. Watkin Williams Wynn mentioned the fact that a former member of the House of Commons, afterwards one of the judges of the Common Pleas, \"a gentleman who is now dead, and therefore I may name him,\" declared that he \"had never been in the borough he represented in Parliament, nor had ever seen or spoken with any of his electors.\"  Of course this worthy person, \"afterwards one of the judges of the Common Pleas,\" had simply sent down his agent and bought the place.  \"I believe,\" added Mr. Wynn, \"I could without much difficulty name some who are now in the same situation.\"  No doubt he could.  [Sidenote: 1734--A supposititious minister]  Sir William Wyndham came on to speak.  Wyndham was now, of course, the close ally of Bolingbroke.  He hated Walpole.  He made his whole speech one long denunciation of bribery and corruption, and gave it to be understood that in his firm conviction Walpole only wanted a long Parliament because it gave him better opportunities to bribe and to corrupt.  He went on to draw a picture of what might come to pass under an unscrupulous minister, sustained by a corrupted septennial Parliament.  \"Let us suppose,\" he said, \"a gentleman at the head of the Administration whose only safety depends upon his corrupting the members of this House.\"  Of course Sir William went on to declare that he only put this as a supposition, but it was certainly a thing which might come to pass, and was within the limits of possibility.  If it did come to pass, could not such a minister promise himself more success in a septennial than he {13} could in a triennial Parliament? \"It is an old maxim,\" Wyndham said, \"that every man has his price.\" This allusion to the old maxim is worthy of notice in a debate on the conduct and character of Walpole.  Evidently Wyndham did not fall into the mistake which posterity appears to have made, and attribute to Walpole himself the famous words about man and his price.  Suppose a case \"which, though it has not happened, may possibly happen.  Let us suppose a man abandoned to all notions of virtue and honor, of no great family, and of but a mean fortune, raised to be chief Minister of State by the concurrence of many whimsical events; afraid or unwilling to trust to any but creatures of his own making, and most of these equally abandoned to all notions of virtue or honor; ignorant of the true interest of his country, and consulting nothing but that of enriching and aggrandizing himself and his favorites.\"  Sir"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23471"],["title","A History of the Four Georges and of William IV, Volume III (#1)"],["body","had not the faintest desire to start a seraglio in England.  He had no German mistresses.  He did not care about fat women.  He was devoted to his mother--perhaps a good deal too devoted, but even the excess of devotion might have been pardonable in the public opinion of England; certainly it was only his own weakness and perversity that made it for a while not pardonable.  He was of the country squire's order of mind; his tastes were wholly those of the stolid, well-intentioned, bucolic country squire.  He would probably have been a very respectable and successful sovereign if only he had not been plagued by the ambition to be a king.  It is curious to remember that the accession of George {5} the Third was generally and joyfully welcomed.  A hopeful people, having endured with increasing dislike two sovereigns of the House of Hanover, were quite prepared to believe that a third prince was rich in all regal qualities; in all public and private virtues.  It would, perhaps, have been unreasonable on the part of any dispassionate observer of public affairs to anticipate that a third George would make a worse monarch than his namesakes and immediate predecessors.  The dispassionate observer might have maintained that there were limits to kingly misgovernment in a kingdom endowed with a Constitution and blessed with a measure of Parliamentary representation, and that those limits had been fairly reached by the two German princes who ruled reluctantly enough over the fortunes of England.  This same dispassionate observer might reasonably, assuming him to possess familiar knowledge of certain facts, have hazarded the prediction that George the Third would be a better king than his grandfather and his great-grandfather.  He was certainly a better man.  There was so much of a basis whereupon to build a hope of better things.  The profligacy of his ancestors had not apparently vitiated his blood and judgment.  His young life had been a pure life.  He was in that way a pattern to princes.  He had been, which was rare with his race, a good son.  He was to be--and there was no more rare quality in one of his stock--a good husband, a good father.  He was in his way a good friend to his friends.  He was sincerely desirous to prove himself a good king to his people.  The youth of George the Third had passed under somewhat agitated conditions.  George the Second's straight-forward hatred for his son's wife opened a great gulf between the Court and Leicester House, which no true courtier made any effort to bridge.  While the young Prince knew, in consequence, little or nothing of the atmosphere of St. James's or the temper of those who breathed that atmosphere, attempts were not wanting to sunder him from the influence of his mother.  Some of the noblemen and clergymen to whom the early instruction of the young {6} Prince was entrusted labored with a persistency which would have been admirable in some other cause to sever him not merely from all his father's friends but even from his father's wife.  There was indeed a time when their efforts almost succeeded in alienating the young Prince from his mother.  The wildest charges of Jacobitism were brought against the immediate servants of the Princess, charges which those who made them wholly failed to substantiate.  The endeavor to remove the Prince from the tutelage of his mother was abandoned.  The education of the Prince was committed to more sympathetic care.  The change had its advantage in keeping George in the wholesome atmosphere of Leicester House instead of exposing him to the temptations of a profligate Court.  It had its disadvantages in leaving him entirely under the influence of a man to whose guidance, counsel, and authority the Princess Dowager absolutely submitted herself.  [Sidenote: 1760--Lord Bute]  Observers of the lighter sort are pleased to insist upon the trifles which have the most momentous influence upon the fortunes of peoples and the fates of empires.  A famous and facile French playwright derived the downfall of a favorite and of a political revolution from the spilling of a glass of water.  There are times when the temptation to pursue this thread of fancy is very great.  Suppose, for instance, it had not chanced to rain on a certain day at Clifden, when a cricket match was being played in which Frederick, Prince of Wales, happened to be interested.  A fretted Prince would not have had to retire to his tent like Achilles, would not have insisted on a game of whist to cheer his humor.  There would have been no difficulty in forming a rubber. There would have been no need to seek for a fourth hand.  No wistful gentleman-in-attendance seeking the desirable would have had to ask the aid of a strange nobleman perched in an apothecary's chariot.  Had this strange nobleman not been so sought and found, had the apothecary not been wealthy enough to keep a chariot, and friendly enough to offer a poor Scotch gentleman a seat in it, it is possible that the {7} American Colonies might yet form portion and parcel of the British Empire, that Chatham's splendid dreams might have become still more splendid realities, that the name of Wilkes might never have emerged from an obscurity of debauch to association with the name of liberty. For the nobleman who made the fourth hand in the Prince of Wales's rubber was unfortunately a man of agreeable address and engaging manners, manners that pleased infinitely the Prince of Wales, and cemented a friendship most disastrous in its consequences to England, to the English people, and to an English king.  The name of the engaging nobleman was Lord Bute.  At the time of this memorable game of whist Lord Bute was thirty-six years old.  He was well educated, well read, tall of body, pleasing of countenance, quick in intelligence, and curious in disposition.  These qualities won the heart of the Prince of Wales, and lifted the young Scotch nobleman from poverty and obscurity to prominence and favor. The Prince appointed Bute a Lord of the Bedchamber and welcomed him to his most intimate friendship.  The death of the Prince of Wales two years later had no disastrous effect upon the rising fortunes of the favorite.  The influence which Bute had exercised over the mind of Frederick he exercised over the mind of Frederick's wife and over the mind of Frederick's heir.  Scandal whispered, asserted, insisted then and has insisted ever since, that the influence which Lord Bute exercised over the Princess of Wales was not merely a mental influence. How far scandal was right or wrong there is no means, there probably never will be any means, of knowing.  Lord Bute's defenders point to his conspicuous affection for his wife, Edward Wortley Montagu's only daughter, in contravention of the scandal.  Undoubtedly Bute was a good husband and a good father.  Whether the scandal was justified or not, the fact that it existed, that it was widely blown abroad and very generally believed, was enough.  As far as the popularity of the Princess was concerned it might as well have been justified.  For years no caricature was so popular as that which displayed the Boot and the {8} Petticoat, the ironic popular symbols of Lord Bute and the Princess.  By whatever means Lord Bute gained his influence over the Princess of Wales, he undoubtedly possessed the influence and used it with disastrous effect.  He moulded the feeble intelligence of the young Prince George; he guided his thoughts, directed his studies in statecraft, and was to all intents and purposes the governor of the young Prince's person.  The young Prince could hardly have had a worse adviser.  Bute was a man of many merits, but his defects were in the highest degree dangerous in a person who had somehow become possessed of almost absolute power.  In the obscurity of a private life, the man who had borne poverty with dignity at an age when poverty was peculiarly galling to one of his station might have earned the esteem of his immediate fellows.  In the exaltation of a great if an unauthorized rule, and later in the authority of an important public office, his defects were fatal to his fame and to the fortunes of those who accepted his sway.  For nearly ten years, from the death of Frederick, Prince of Wales, to the death of George the Second, Bute was all-powerful in his influence over the mother of the future King and over the future King himself.  When the young Prince came to the throne Lord Bute did not immediately assume ostensible authority.  He remained the confidential adviser of the young King until 1761.  In 1761 he took office, assuming the Secretaryship of State resigned by Lord Holdernesse.  From a secretaryship to the place of Prime Minister was but a step, and a step soon taken.  Although he did not occupy office very long, he held it long enough to become perhaps the most unpopular Prime Minister England has ever had.  [Sidenote: 1760--Hannah Lightfoot and Lady Sarah Lennox]  The youth of George the Third was starred with a strange romance.  The full truth of the story of Hannah Lightfoot will probably never be known.  What is known is sufficiently romantic without the additions of legend.  Hannah Lightfoot was a beautiful Quaker girl, the daughter of a decent tradesman in Wapping.  Association with the family of an uncle, a linendraper, who lived near the {9} Court, brought the girl into the fashionable part of the town.  The young Prince saw her by accident somehow, somewhere, in the early part of 1754, and fell in love with her.  From that moment the girl disappears from certain knowledge, and legend busies itself with her name.  It is asserted that she was actually married to the young Prince; that William Pitt, afterwards Earl of Chatham, was present at the marriage; that she bore the Prince several children.  Other versions have it that she was married as a mere form to a man named Axford, who immediately left her, and that after this marriage she lived with the"]]]
