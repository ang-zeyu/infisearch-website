She was the fairest thing on earth, worthy indeed of the deathless gods who had created her. Perfect, too, was the happiness that she brought with her to Epimethus. Before her coming, as he well knew now, the fair world had been incomplete. Since she came the fragrant flowers had grown more sweet for him, the song of the birds more full of melody. He found new life in Pandora and marvelled how his brother could ever have fancied that she could bring to the world aught but peace and joyousness.  Now when the gods had entrusted to the Titan brothers the endowment of all living things upon the earth, they had been careful to withhold everything that might bring into the world pain, sickness, anxiety, bitterness of heart, remorse, or soul-crushing sorrow. All these hurtful things were imprisoned in a coffer which was given into the care of the trusty Epimethus.  To Pandora the world into which she came was all fresh, all new, quite full of unexpected joys and delightful surprises. It was a world of mystery, but mystery of which her great, adoring, simple Titan held the golden key. When she saw the coffer which never was opened, what then more natural than that she should ask Epimethus what it contained? But the contents were known only to the gods. Epimethus was unable to answer. Day by day, the curiosity of Pandora increased. To her the gods had never given anything but good. Surely there must be here gifts more precious still. What if the Olympians had destined her to be the one to open the casket, and had sent her to earth in order that she might bestow on this dear world, on the men who lived on it, and on her own magnificent Titan, happiness and blessings which only the minds of gods could have conceived? Thus did there come a day when Pandora, unconscious instrument in the hands of a vengeful Olympian, in all faith, and with the courage that is born of faith and of love, opened the lid of the prison-house of evil. And as from coffers in the old Egyptian tombs, the live plague can still rush forth and slay, the long-imprisoned evils rushed forth upon the fair earth and on the human beings who lived on it--malignant, ruthless, fierce, treacherous, and cruel--poisoning, slaying, devouring. Plague and pestilence and murder, envy and malice and revenge and all viciousness--an ugly wolf-pack indeed was that one let loose by Pandora. Terror, doubt, misery, had all rushed straightway to attack her heart, while the evils of which she had never dreamed stung mind and soul into dismay and horror, when, by hastily shutting the lid of the coffer, she tried to undo the evil she had done.  And lo, she found that the gods had imprisoned one good gift only in this Inferno of horrors and of ugliness. In the world there had never been any need of Hope. What work was there for Hope to do where all was perfect, and where each creature possessed the desire of body and of heart? Therefore Hope was thrust into the chest that held the evils, a star in a black night, a lily growing on a dung-heap. And as Pandora, white-lipped and trembling, looked into the otherwise empty box, courage came back to her heart, and Epimethus let fall to his side the arm that would have slain the woman of his love because there came to him, like a draught of wine to a warrior spent in battle, an imperial vision of the sons of men through all the aeons to come, combatting all evils of body and of soul, going on conquering and to conquer. Thus, saved by Hope, the Titan and the woman faced the future, and for them the vengeance of the gods was stayed.                            \"Yet I argue not     Against Heav'n's hand or will, nor bate a jot     Of heart or hope; but still bear up and steer     Right onward.\"  So spoke Milton, the blind Titan of the seventeenth century; and Shakespeare says:      \"True hope is swift, and flies with swallow's wings;     Kings it makes gods, and meaner creatures kings.\"  Upon the earth, and on the children of men who were as gods in their knowledge and mastery of the force of fire, Jupiter had had his revenge. For Prometheus he reserved another punishment. He, the greatly-daring, once the dear friend and companion of Zeus himself, was chained to a rock on Mount Caucasus by the vindictive deity. There, on a dizzy height, his body thrust against the sun-baked rock, Prometheus had to endure the torment of having a foul-beaked vulture tear out his liver, as though he were a piece of carrion lying on the mountain side. All day, while the sun mercilessly smote him and the blue sky turned from red to black before his pain-racked eyes, the torture went on. Each night, when the filthy bird of prey that worked the will of the gods spread its dark wings and flew back to its eyrie, the Titan endured the cruel mercy of having his body grow whole once more. But with daybreak there came again the silent shadow, the smell of the unclean thing, and again with fierce beak and talons the vulture greedily began its work.  Thirty thousand years was the time of his sentence, and yet Prometheus knew that at any moment he could have brought his torment to an end. A secret was his--a mighty secret, the revelation of which would have brought him the mercy of Zeus and have reinstated him in the favour of the all-powerful god. Yet did he prefer to endure his agonies rather than to free himself by bowing to the desires of a tyrant who had caused Man to be made, yet denied to Man those gifts that made him nobler than the beasts and raised him almost to the heights of the Olympians. Thus for him the weary centuries dragged by--in suffering that knew no respite--in endurance that the gods might have ended. Prometheus had brought an imperial gift to the men that he had made, and imperially he paid the penalty.      \"Three thousand years of sleep-unsheltered hours,     And moments aye divided by keen pangs     Till they seemed years, torture and solitude,     Scorn and despair,--these are mine empire.     More glorious far than that which thou surveyest     From thine unenvied throne, O, Mighty God!     Almighty, had I deigned to share the shame     Of thine ill tyranny, and hung not here     Nailed to this wall of eagle-baffling mountain,     Black, wintry, dead, unmeasured; without herb,     Insect, or beast, or shape or sound of life.     Ah me! alas, pain, pain ever, for ever!\"          Shelley.      \"Titan! to whose immortal eyes     The sufferings of mortality     Seen in their sad reality,     Were not as things that gods despise;     What was thy pity's recompense?     A silent suffering, and intense;     The rock, the vulture, and the chain,     All that the proud can feel of pain,     The agony they do not show,     The suffocating sense of woe,     Which speaks but in its loneliness,     And then is jealous lest the sky     Should have a listener, nor will sigh     Until its voice is echoless.\"          Byron.      \"Yet, I am still Prometheus, wiser grown     By years of solitude,--that holds apart     The past and future, giving the soul room     To search into itself,--and long commune     With this eternal silence;--more a god,     In my long-suffering and strength to meet     With equal front the direst shafts of fate,     Than thou in thy faint-hearted despotism ...     Therefore, great heart, bear up! thou art but type     Of what all lofty spirits endure that fain     Would win men back to strength and peace through love:     Each hath his lonely peak, and on each heart     Envy, or scorn or hatred tears lifelong     With vulture beak; yet the high soul is left;     And faith, which is but hope grown wise, and love     And patience, which at last shall overcome.\"          Lowell.     PYGMALION   In days when the world was young and when the gods walked on the earth, there reigned over the island of Cyprus a sculptor-king, and king of sculptors, named Pygmalion. In the language of our own day, we should call him \"wedded to his art.\" In woman he only saw the bane of man. Women, he believed, lured men from the paths to which their destiny called them. While man walked alone, he walked free--he had given no \"hostages to fortune.\" Alone, man could live for his art, could combat every danger that beset him, could escape, unhampered, from every pitfall in life. But woman was the ivy that clings to the oak, and throttles the oak in the end. No woman, vowed Pygmalion, should ever hamper him. And so at length he came to hate women, and, free of heart and mind, his genius wrought such great things that he became a very perfect sculptor. He had one passion, a passion for his art, and that sufficed him. Out of great rough blocks of marble he would hew the most perfect semblance of men and of women, and of everything that seemed to him most beautiful and the most worth preserving.  When we look now at the Venus of Milo, at the Diana of Versailles, and at the Apollo Belvidere in the Vatican, we can imagine what were the greater things that the sculptor of Cyprus freed from the dead blocks of marble. One day as he chipped and chiselled there came to him, like the rough sketch of a great picture, the semblance of a woman. How it came he knew not. Only he knew that in that great mass of pure white stone there seemed to be imprisoned the exquisite image of a woman, a woman that he must set free. Slowly, gradually, the woman came. Soon he knew that she was the most beautiful thing that his art had ever wrought. All that he had ever thought that a woman _should_ be, this woman was. Her form and features were all most perfect, and so perfect were they, that he felt very sure that, had she been a woman indeed, most perfect would have been the soul within. For her he worked as he had never worked before. There came, at last, a day when he felt that another touch would be insult to the exquisite thing he had created. He laid his chisel aside and sat down to gaze at the Perfect"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22696"],["title","Colonel Crockett's Co-operative Christmas (#1)"],["body"," out of gear, like it must have been when Joshua held up the moon--or was it the sun?  You remember reading me once about--I reckon it was Mr. Aldrich's pleasing idea of the last man on earth; everybody killed off by a pestilence or something, and him setting there by his lonely little lonesome; and what would he have done if he had heard his door-bell ring? Well, I reckon he'd have done what I'd have done if I'd met a friend--given one wild whoop, wrapped his arms round his neck, kissed him on both cheeks, and died with a faint gurgle of joy. I'd of been glad to have died so, too.  Finally, I swore that if I ever foresaw myself being corralled again in a strange city on Christmas, I'd put on a sandwich board or something and march up and down the streets with a sign like this:                                  I'm lonely!                          I'm homesick for a real                                 Christmas!                           There must be others.                            Let's get together!                          Meet me at the Fountain                              in Union Square!                   We'll hang our stockings on the trees.                    Perhaps some snow will fall in 'em.                            Come one--Come all!                           Both great and small!   I bet such a board would stir up a procession of exiles a mile and a half long. And we'd get together and have a good crying match on each other's shoulders, and wring each other's hands, while the band played Old Lang's Sign.  But it's over now. I've lived through the game of Christmas solitaire in a big city, and I feel as relieved as a man just getting out of a dentist's office. He's minus a few molars, and aches considerable, but he's full of a pleasing emptiness.  But let me say right here, and put it in black and white: If I'm ever dragged away from home again on Christmas, I'll take laughing-gas enough for a day and two nights, or I'll take some violent steps to get company, if I have to hire a cayuse and a lariat and rustle Broadway, rounding up a herd of other unbranded stray cattle.  Well, this is a long letter for me, honey, and I will close. Love and kisses to the sweet little kids and to the best wife a fellow ever had.  Your loving  AUSTIN.   P. S. I pulled off the deal all right. The syndicate buys the mine. I get $500,000 in cash and $500,000 in stock, and I start for home in three days. We'll hang up our stockings on New Year's Day.     Between Letters   The Fates accepted Colonel Crockett's challenge, and, by an irresistible syndication of events, forced him to be alone in New York again the very next Christmas. After a series of masterly financial strokes, he had felt rich enough in his two millions to spend a year abroad with his family. A cablegram called him to America early in December, to a directors' meeting. Expecting to return at once, he had left his family in Italy. A legal complication kept him postponing his trip from day to day; and finally an important hearing, in which he was a valued witness, was postponed by the referee--or deferee--till after the holidays. The Colonel saw himself confronted with another Christmas far away from any of his people. The first two days he spent in violent profanity, and in declining invitations which he received from business acquaintances to share their homes. Then he set out to make the occasion memorable. Once more we may leave the account to him.     LETTER TWO   _New York, N. Y., Dec. 28, 1905._  FRIEND WIFE:  Well, I've been and went and gone and done it! And golly, but it was fun--barring wishing you and the little ones had of been here, too. Next year we'll arrange it so, for I'm going to do it again. You remember Artemus Ward's man who \"had been dead three weeks and liked it.\" Well, that's me. This camping out in New York is getting to be a habit. I'm sending you a bundle of newspaper clippings as big as a stovepipe--all about Yours Truly.  As soon as I saw that circumstances had organized a pool to corner me and my Christmases, I spent a couple of days sending up rain-making language. Then I settled down to work like a bronco does to harness after kicking off the dashboard and snapping a couple of traces.  \"If I've got to be alone this Christmas,\" I says to myself, \"I'll make it the gol-blamedest, crowdedest solitude ever heard of this side of the River.\"  I looked for the biggest place in town under one roof. Madison Square Garden was _it_. You remember it. We was there to the Horse Show--so-called. You recollect, I reckon, that the Garden holds right smart of people. At a political meeting once they got 14,000 people into it, and there was still room for Grover Cleveland to stand and make a speech.  Well, feeling kind o' flush and recklesslike, I decided to go and see the manager, or janitor, or whatever he is. And go I did. I says to him: \"Could I rent your cute little shack for one evening--Christmas night?\"  \"Certainly, sir,\" he says. \"There happens to be nothing doing this Christmas.\"  \"How much would it set me back?\" I says very polite.  \"Only one thousand plunks,\" says he smiling.  \"But, my dear Gaston,\" I says with a low bow, \"I don't want to buy your little Noah's Ark for the baby. I only want to borrow it for one evening.\"  \"One thou. is our bargain-counter limit,\" he says. \"I couldn't make it less for the poor old Czar of Rooshy.\"  I kind o' hesitated, remembering the time when a thousand dollars would have kept me comfortable for about three years. It's hard to get over the habit of counting your change. Then Mr. Janitor, seeing me kind o' groggy, says, a little less polite:  \"If that's more than you care to pay for a single room you can get a cot for five cents on the Bowery; for a quarter you can get a whole suite.\"  [Illustration: \"ONLY ONE THOUSAND PLUNKS,\" SAYS HE]  That riled me. I flashed a wad of bills on him that made his eyes look like two automobile lamps. He could see it wasn't Confederate money, either. Then I shifted my cigar to detract attention while I swallowed my Adam's apple, and I says:  \"I was only hesitating, my boy, because I wondered if your nice young Garden would be big enough. You haven't got a couple more to rent at the same price?\"  He wilted and caved in like a box of ice cream does just before you get home with it. Then he began to bow lower, and we cut for a new deal. He took the lead.  He says what might I be wanting to use the Garden for?  \"Oh, I won't bulge the walls or strain the floor,\" I says. \"I only want it for a Christmas tree. I am going to invite my friends to a little party.\"  \"Whew, but you must be popular!\" he says. \"Who the dickens are you? Brother Teddy, or Mother Eddy?\"  \"I'm Colonel D. Austin Crockett, of Waco,\" I says as meek as I could.  \"Pleased to meet you, Colonel,\" he says. \"What you running for?--District Attorney? Or are you starting a new Mutual Benefit Life Assassination?\"  \"Neither,\" I says; \"I'm a stranger in New York.\"  \"But these friends of yours?\" he gasped. \"Is all Waco coming up here on an excursion? Is the town going to move bodily?\"  \"Mr. Prosecutor,\" I says, \"if you'll stop cross-examining a minute, and let me tell how it all happened, it will save right smart of time. I am a stranger here to about four million people. They are strangers to me. We ought to know each other. So I'm going to give a little Madison Square Garden warming and invite 'em in.\"  \"What are you going to sell 'em--prize poultry, or physical culture?\"  \"I've nothing to sell. I'm just going to entertain 'em.\"  \"Well, I've heard of Southern hospitality,\" he says, \"but this beats me. How much you going to charge a head?\"  \"Nothing. Everything is to be free. Admission included.\"  \"Not on your dear old Lost Cause!\" he exclaims. \"Leastways not in our little doll's house. Not for ten thousand dollars! Why, man, do you realize that if you offered these New York, Brooklyn, Bronx, Hackensack and Hoboken folks a free show, more'n two thousand women would get trampled to death? Did you ever see a bargain-counter crowd on Twenty-third Street? Well, that's only for a chance to get something they don't want at a fishbait price. But if you offered them a free, 'take-one' chance--holy keewhiz!--I can just see it now! The Garden ain't half big enough in the first place. There's enough Take-One'ers in these parts to fill the old Coliseum. And they'd make the wild animals look like a cage of rabbits or white mice.\"  Well, the upshot of it was, he persuaded me to charge an admission; so we set it at $1.00 a head \"on the hoof.\" I wrote out a card and sent it to all the papers to print at advertising rates. It cost right smart, but it looked neat:       TO EVERY STRANGER IN NEW YORK, AND HIS LADY      If you are not otherwise engaged on Christmas night, the honor of     your presence at Madison Square Garden is requested by      DAVID AUSTIN CROCKETT      _Colonel Fifth Texas Cavalry, C. S. A._      Music, Dancing, Refreshments, Souvenirs. For the purpose of keeping     out the undesirable element a charge of $1.00 will be made.   I knew that them magic words, \"Refreshments\" and \"Souvenirs,\" would hit 'em hard. In order to whet the public interest, I asked the papers where I advertised to give the thing some editorial or other reference. But they was very cold and said the best they could do was to send their dramatic critics to criticise the show afterward. A lot of good that would do me! So I took more space in advertising.  In a day or two I was visited at the hotel by one of the most imperent young fellows I ever met up with. He sent up a card, \"_James J. James, Publicity Expert._\" I said to show him in, and he sort of oozed through the door--he was that oily. He looked about to see if we was alone; then winked slow and important, and says:  \"What's your game, Colonel? It looks pretty slick, but I can't quite make it out. It's a new bunco, all right, but slick as it looks, it ain't quite so slick as it "]]]
