After an hour or so spent in wandering on the beach picking up shells, and gazing wistfully out to sea, Henry Stuart appeared to grow tired of waiting, for he laid himself down on the shore, turned his back on the ocean, pillowed his head on a tuft of grass, and deliberately went to sleep.  Now was the time for the savage to wreak his vengeance on his enemy, but, fortunately, that villain, despite his subtlety and cunning, had not conceived the possibility of the youth indulging in such an unnatural recreation as a nap in the forenoon.  He had, therefore, retired to his native jungle, and during the hour in which Henry was buried in repose, and in which he might have accomplished his end without danger or uncertainty, he was seated in a dark cave moodily resolving in his mind future plans of villany, and indulging the hope that on the youth's returning homewards he would be more successful in finding a favourable opportunity to take his life.  During this same hour it was that our low-hulled little schooner hove in sight on the horizon, ran swiftly down before the breeze, cast anchor in the bay, and sent her boat ashore, as we have seen, with the captain, the surly man called Dick, and our friend John Bumpus.  It happened that, just as the boat ran under the shelter of a rocky point and touched the strand, Keona left his cave for the purpose of observing what young Stuart was about.  He knew that he could not have retraced his homeward way without passing within sight of his place of concealment.  A glance of surprise crossed his dark visage as he crept to the edge of the underwood and saw the schooner at anchor in the bay.  This was succeeded by a fiendish grin of exultation as his eye fell on the slumbering form of the youth.  He instantly took advantage of the opportunity; and so deeply was he engrossed with his murderous intention, that he did not observe the captain of the schooner as he turned a projecting rock, and suddenly appeared upon the scene.  The captain, however, saw the savage, and instantly drew back, signing, at the same time, to his two men to keep under cover.  A second glance shewed him the sleeping form of Henry, and, almost before he had time to suspect that foul play was going on, he saw the savage glide from the bushes to the side of the sleeper, raise his spear, and poise it for one moment, as if to make sure of sending it straight to the youth's heart.  There was not a moment to lose.  The captain carried a short carbine in his hand, with which he took aim at the savage--going down on one knee to make a surer shot, for the carbine of those days was not to be depended on at a distance much beyond a hundred yards; and as the actors in this scene were separated by even more than that distance, there was a considerable chance of missing the savage and hitting the young man.  This, however, was not a moment to calculate chances.  The captain pulled the trigger, and the crash of the shot was followed by a howl from the savage, as his uplifted arm dropt to his side, and the spear fell across the face of the sleeper.  Henry instantly awoke, and sprang up with the agility of a panther.  Before he could observe what had occurred, Keona leapt into the bushes and disappeared.  Henry at once bounded after him; and the captain, giving vent to a lusty cheer, rushed across the beach, and sprang into the forest, closely followed by surly Dick and John Bumpus, whose united cheers of excitement and shouts of defiance awoke the echoes of the place with clamorous discords.    CHAPTER THREE.  A ROUGH WALK ENLIVENED BY RAMBLING TALK--BUMPUS IS \"AGREEABLE.\"  It is said, in the proverbial philosophy of nautical men, that \"a stern chase is a long one.\"  The present instance was an exception to the general rule.  Keona was wounded.  Young Stuart was fleet as the antelope, and strong as a young lion.  In these circumstances it is not surprising that, after a run of less than a quarter of a mile, he succeeded in laying his hands on the neck of the savage and hurling him to the ground, where he lay panting and helpless, looking up in the face of his conqueror with an expression of hopeless despair--for savages and wicked men generally are wont to judge of others by themselves, and to expect to receive such treatment from their enemies as they themselves would in similar circumstances accord.  The fear of instant death was before his eyes, and the teeth of Keona chattered in his head, while his face grew more hideous than ever, by reason of its becoming livid.  His fears were groundless.  Henry Stuart was not a savage.  He was humane by nature; and, in addition to this, he had been trained under the influence of that Book which teaches us that the most philosophical, because the most effective, method of procedure in this world, is to \"overcome evil with good.\"  \"So, you scoundrel,\" said Henry, placing his knee on Keona's chest, and compressing his throat with his left hand, while, with his right, he drew forth a long glittering knife, and raised it in the air--\"So you are not satisfied with what I gave you the last time we met, but you must needs take the trouble to cross my path a second time, and get a taste of cold steel, must you?\"  Although Keona could speak no English, he understood it sufficiently to appreciate the drift of the youth's words, even though he had failed to comprehend the meaning of the angry frown and the glittering knife. But, however much he might have wished to reply to the question, Henry took care to render the attempt impossible, by compressing his windpipe until he became blue in the face, and then black.  At the same time, he let the sharp point of his knife touch the skin just over the region of the heart.  Having thus convinced his vanquished foe that death was at the door, he suddenly relaxed his iron gripe; arose, sheathed his knife, and bade the savage get up.  The miserable creature did so, with some difficulty, just as the captain and his men arrived on the scene.  \"Well met, Henry,\" cried the former, extending his hand to the youth, \"had I been a moment later, my lads I fear that your life's blood would have been on the sea shore.\"  \"Then it was you who fired the shot, Captain Gascoyne?  This is the second time I have to thank you for saving my life,\" said the young man, returning the grasp of the captain's hand.  \"Truly, it is but a small matter to have to thank me for.  Doubtless, if my stout man, John Bumpus, had carried the carbine, he would have done you as good service.  And methinks, Henry, that you would have preferred to owe your life to either of my men, rather than to me, if I may judge by your looks.\"  \"You should not judge by looks, captain,\" replied the youth quickly--\"especially the looks of a man who has just had a hand to hand tussle with a savage.  But, to tell the plain truth, Captain Gascoyne, I would indeed rather have had to thank your worthy man, John Bumpus, than yourself for coming to my aid, for although I owe you no grudge, and do not count you an enemy, I had rather see your back than your face--and you know the reason why.\"  \"You give me credit, boy, for more knowledge than I possess,\" replied Gascoyne, while an angry frown gathered for a moment on his brow; but passed away almost as quickly as it came; \"I know not the cause of your unreasonable dislike to one who has never done you an injury.\"  \"Never done me an injury!\" cried Henry, starting and turning with a look of passion on his companion; then, checking himself by a strong effort, he added in a milder tone--\"But a truce to such talk, and I ask your forgiveness for my sharp words just after your rendering me such good service in the hour of need.  You and I differ in our notions on one or two points--that is all; there is no need for quarrelling.  See, here is a note from my mother, who sent me to the bay to meet you.\"  During this colloquy, Dick and Bumpus had mounted guard over the wounded savage, just out of ear-shot of their captain.  Neither of the sailors ventured to hold their prisoner, because they deemed it an unmanly advantage to take of one who was so completely (as they imagined) in their power.  They kept a watchful eye on him, however; and while they affected an easy indifference of attitude, held themselves in readiness to pounce upon him if he should attempt to escape.  But nothing seemed farther from the mind of Keona than such an attempt.  He appeared to be thoroughly exhausted by his recent struggle and loss of blood, and his body was bent as if he were about to sink down to the ground.  There was, however, a peculiar glance in his dark eyes that induced John Bumpus to be more on his guard than appearances seemed to warrant.  While Gascoyne was reading the letter to which we have referred, Keona suddenly placed his left leg behind surly Dick, and, with his unwounded fist, hit that morose individual such a tremendous back-handed blow on the nose, that he instantly measured his length on the ground.  John Bumpus made a sudden plunge at the savage on seeing this, but the latter ducked his head, passed like an eel under the very arms of the sailor, and went off into the forest like a deer.  \"Hold!\" shouted Captain Gascoyne, as John turned in a state of mingled amazement and anger to pursue.  \"Hold on, Bumpus, let the miserable rascal go.\"  John stopped, looked over his shoulder, hesitated, and finally came back with a rolling air of nautical indifference, and his hands thrust into his breeches pockets.  \"You know best, capting,\" said he, \"but I think it a pity to let sich a dirty varmint go clear off, to dodge about in the bushes, and mayhap treat us to a pisoned arrow, or a spear-thrust on the sly. Howsomedever, it aint no consarn wotever to Jo Bumpus.  How's your beak, Dick, my boy?\"  \"None the better for your askin',\" replied the surly mariner, who was tenderly stroking the injured"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23385"],["title","Saved (#1)"],["body","know'd that no boat that ever wos built could live in that sea.\"  \"Ye don't know much yet, Bill, 'bout anything a'most,\" replied an old man near him.  \"Why, I've see'd boats in the East, not much better than two planks, as could go through a worse surf than that.\"  \"May be so,\" retorted Bill, \"but I know--hallo! is that her coming off?\"  \"That's her,\" cried several voices--\"all right, my hearties.\"  \"Not so sure o' that,\" observed another of the excited band of men who watched every motion of the little craft intently,--\"there--why--I do believe there are more in her now than went out in her, what think 'ee, Dick?\"  Dick did not reply, for by that time the boat, having got clear of the wreck, was making for the shore, and the observers were all too intent in using their eyes to make use of their tongues.  Coming as she did before the wind, the progress of the lifeboat was very different from what it had been when she set out.  In a few minutes she became distinctly visible, careering on the crest of the waves towards the harbour mouth, and then it was ascertained beyond doubt that some at least, if not all, of the crew of the brig had been rescued.  A short sharp Hurrah! burst from the men on the outlook when this became certain, but they relapsed into deep silence again, for the return of the boat was more critical than its departure had been.  There is much more danger in running before a heavy sea than in pulling against it. Every roaring billow that came into the bay near the Cove like a green wall broke in thunder on the sands before reaching the wreck, and as it continued its furious career towards the beach it seemed to gather fresh strength, so that the steersman of the lifeboat had to keep her stern carefully towards it to prevent her from turning broadside on--or, as it is nautically expressed, broaching to.  Had she done so, the death of all on board would have been almost inevitable.  Knowing this, the men on the pier gazed with breathless anxiety as each wave roared under the boat's stern, lifted it up until it appeared perpendicular; carried it forward a few yards with fearful velocity, and then let it slip back into the trough of the sea.  But the boat was admirably managed, and it was seen, as she drew near, that the steering oar was held in the firm grip of Captain Boyns.  On it came before the gale with lightning speed towards the harbour mouth; and here a new danger had to be faced, for the entrance was narrow, and the seas were sweeping not into but athwart it, thereby rendering the danger of being dashed against the pier-end very great indeed.  \"Missed it!\" burst from several mouths as the boat flew round the head of the breakwater and was overwhelmed by a heavy sea which rendered her for one moment unmanageable, but almost as soon as filled she was again emptied through the discharging tubes in her floor.  \"No fear of father missing it,\" exclaimed young Harry Boyns, with a proud look and flashing eye as he saw the stalwart form of the captain standing firm in the midst of the foam with his breast pressed hard against the steering oar.  \"Back your starboard oars!  Hold water hard!\" shouted several voices.  \"She's round! hurrah!\" cried Harry, as the boat almost leaped out of the foam and sprang into the comparatively smooth water at the harbour mouth.  The rowers gave vent to a short shout of triumph, and several worn, exhausted seamen in the bottom of the boat were seen to wave their hands feebly.  At the same time, Captain Boyns shouted in a deep loud voice--\"All saved, thank God!\" as they swept towards the land.  Then did there arise from the hundreds of people assembled on and near the pier a ringing cheer, the like of which had never been heard before in Covelly.  Again and again it was repeated while the lifeboat shot up on the beach, and was fairly dragged out of the sea, high and dry, by many eager hands that were immediately afterwards extended to assist the saved crew of the brig to land.  \"Are all saved, father?\" asked Harry Boyns, who was first at the side of the boat.  \"Ay, lad, every one.  Fifteen all told, includin' a woman and a little girl.  Lend a hand to get the poor things up to our house, Harry,\" said the captain, lifting the apparently inanimate form of a young girl over the side as he spoke; \"she ain't dead--only benumbed a little with the cold.\"  Many hands were stretched out, but Harry thrust all others aside, and, receiving the light form of the child in his strong arms, bore her off to his father's cottage, leaving his comrades to attend to the wants of the others.  \"Oh Harry!\" exclaimed Mrs Boyns, when her son burst into the house, \"is your father safe?\"  \"Ay, safe and well,\" he cried.  \"Look sharp, mother--get hot blankets and things ready, for here's a little girl almost dead with cold.  She has just been rescued from a wreck--saved by the new lifeboat!\"    CHAPTER TWO.  DESCRIBES A MERCHANT AND HIS GOD, AND CONCLUDES WITH \"A MESSAGE FROM THE SEA.\"  A close-fisted, hard-hearted, narrow-minded, poor-spirited man was John Webster, Esquire, merchant and shipowner, of Ingot Lane, Liverpool.  And yet he was not altogether without good points.  Indeed, it might be said of him that if he had been reared under more favourable circumstances he might have been an ornament to society and a blessing to his country, for he was intelligent and sociable, and susceptible to some extent of tender influences, when the indulging of amiable feelings did not interfere with his private interests.  In youth he had even gone the length of holding some good principles, and was known to have done one or two noble things--but all this had passed away, for as he grew older the hopeful springs were dried up, one by one, by an all-absorbing passion--the love of money--which ultimately made him what he was, a disgrace to the class to which he belonged, and literally (though not, it would seem, in the eye of law) a wholesale murderer!  At first he began by holding, and frequently stating, the opinion that the possession of much money was a most desirable thing; which undoubtedly was--and is, and will be as long as the world lasts-- perfectly true, if the possession be accompanied with God's blessing. But Mr Webster did not even pretend to look at the thing in that light. He scorned to make use of the worldly man's \"Oh, of course, of course,\" when that idea was sometimes suggested to him by Christian friends.  On the contrary, he boldly and coldly asserted his belief that \"God, if there was a God at all, did not interfere in such matters, and that for his part he would be quite satisfied to let anybody else who wanted it have the blessing if he only got the money.\"  And so it pleased God to give John Webster much money without a blessing.  The immediate result was that he fell in love with it, and, following the natural laws attached to that vehement passion, he hugged it to his bosom, became blind to everything else, and gave himself entirely up to it with a self-denying devotion that robbed him of much of his natural rest, of nearly all his graces, and most of his happiness--leaving him with no hope in this world, save that of increasing his stores of money, and with no hope for the world to come at all.  The abode of Mr Webster's soul was a dingy little office with dirty little windows, a miserable little fireplace, and filthy little chairs and tables--all which were quite in keeping with the little occupant of the place.  The abode of his body was a palatial residence in the suburbs of the city.  Although Mr Webster's soul was little, his body was large--much too large indeed for the jewel which it enshrined, and which was so terribly knocked about inside its large casket that its usual position was awry, and it never managed to become upright by any chance whatever.  To the former abode Mr Webster went, body and soul, one dark November morning.  Having seated himself before his desk, he threw himself back in his chair and began to open his letters--gazing with a placid smile, as he did so, at the portrait of his deceased wife's father--a very wealthy old gentleman--which hung over the fireplace.  We omitted to mention, by the way, that Mr Webster had once been married.  This trifling little event of his life occurred when he was about forty-eight years of age, and was a mercantile transaction of an extremely successful kind, inasmuch as it had brought him, after deducting lawyers' fees, stamps, duties, lost time in courtship, wedding-tour expenses, doctor's fees, deathbed expenses, etcetera, a clear profit of sixty thousand pounds.  To be sure there were also the additional expenses of four years of married life, and the permanent board, lodging, and education of a little daughter; but, all things considered, these were scarcely worth speaking of; and in regard to the daughter--Annie by name--she would in time become a marketable commodity, which might, if judiciously disposed of, turn in a considerable profit, besides being, before she was sold, a useful machine for sewing on buttons, making tea, reading the papers aloud, fetching hats and sticks and slippers, etcetera.  There had, however, been a slight drawback--a sort of temporary loss--on this concern at first, for the piece of goods became damaged, owing to her mother's death having weighed heavily on a sensitive and loving spirit, which found no comfort or sympathy at home, save in the devoted affection of an old nurse named Niven.  When Annie reached the age of six years, the doctors ordered change of air, and recommended a voyage to the West Indies.  Their advice was followed.  Nothing was easier.  Mr Webster had many ships on the sea.  These were of two classes.  The first class consisted of good, new, well found and manned ships, with valuable cargoes on board which were anxiously watched and longed for; the second class comprised those which were old, worn-out, and unseaworthy, and which, being insured beyond their value,"]]]
