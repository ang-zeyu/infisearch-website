When the coach stopped, as we have described, Jacky got out, and roundly asserted that he would never get in again.  When the attention of the party was occupied with the gorgeous scenery at the extremity of the pass, Jacky, under a sudden impulse of wickedness, crept stealthily into the copse that lined the road, intending to give his parents a fright.  In less than five minutes these parents were galloping away at the rate of ten miles an hour, each happy in the belief that the sweet boy was with the other.  Somewhat surprised at the prolonged and deathlike silence that reigned around him, Jacky returned to the road, where he actually gasped with horror on finding himself the solitary tenant of an apparently uninhabited wilderness.  Sitting down on a stone, he shut his eyes, opened wide his mouth, and roared vehemently.  At the end of about five minutes he ventured to re-open his eyes.  His face instantly assumed an expression of abject terror, and the roar was intensified into a piercing shriek when he beheld a fierce little black cow staring at him within a yard of his face.  A drove of shaggy Highland cattle had come suddenly round a turn in the pass while Jacky's eyes had been shut.  They now filed slowly and steadily past the transfixed boy, as if they were a regiment and he a reviewing general.  Each animal as it came up, stopped, stared for a few seconds, and passed slowly on with its head down, as if saddened by the sight of such a melancholy spectacle.  There were upwards of a hundred animals in the drove; the prolonged and maddening agony which Jacky endured may therefore be conceived but cannot be described.  Last of all came the drover, a kilted, plaided, and bonneted Highlander, quite as shaggy as the roughest of his cattle, and rather fiercer in aspect.  He was not so in reality however, for, on coming to the place where the poor boy sat, he stopped and stared as his predecessors had done.  \"Fat is she doin' there?\" said he.  Jacky paused, and gazed for one moment in mute surprise, then resumed his roar with shut eyes and with tenfold vigour.  As it was evident that any farther attempt at conversation must prove fruitless, the drover took Jacky in his arms, carried him to the extremity of the pass, set him down, and, pointing to the white house in the blue distance, said--  \"Yonder's ta hoose; let her see how she can rin.\"  Jacky fixed his eyes on the house with the stare of one who regarded it as his last and only refuge, and ran as he had never done before, roaring while he ran.  \"She's a clever callant,\" observed the drover with a grim smile, as he turned to follow his cattle.  Meanwhile the Sudberry Family reached the White House in the midst of increasing rain and mists and muttering thunder.  Of course Jacky's absence was at once discovered.  Of course the females screamed and the males shouted, while they turned the mail-coach entirely inside out in a vain search for the lost one.  The din was increased by nine shepherd dogs, which rushed down the mountain-side, barking furiously with delight, (probably), and with excitement, (certainly), at the unwonted sight of so many strangers in that remote glen.  Presently the coach was turned round, and the distracted father galloped back towards the pass. Of course he almost ran over his youngest son in less than five minutes! Five minutes more placed the recovered child in its mother's arms. Then followed a scene of kissing, crying, laughing, barking, and excitement, which is utterly indescribable, accompanied by thunder, lightning, and rain, in the midst of which tempestuous mental and elemental commotion, the Sudberry Family took possession of their Highland home.    STORY ONE, CHAPTER 3.  FIRST IMPRESSIONS.  Next morning the Sudberrys were awakened to a sense of the peculiar circumstances into which they had plunged, by the lowing of cattle, the crowing of cocks, and the furious barking of collie dogs, as the household of Donald McAllister commenced the labours of a new day.  Of course every member of the Sudberry Family, with the exception of \"mamma,\" rushed to his or her respective window.  \"Oh! how beautiful!\" gushed from the heart and lips of Lucy, as she gazed in wonder through the casement, and a shriek burst from Jacky, as he stared in wild delight upon the gorgeous scene that met his view.  We have said that the White House was embedded among the blue hills.  It was an old and extremely simple building, having an oblong front, two sides, and a back; two stories, six windows, and one door; which last, imbued, apparently, with a dislike to being shut, was always open.  The house appeared to have an insatiable thirst for mountain air, and it was well supplied with this fresh and exhilarating beverage; for it stood in an elevated position on the slope of a mountain, and overlooked a wide tract of flood and fell, on which latter there was little wood, but a luxuriant carpet of grass and heather.  The weather had evidently resolved to make amends for its surly reception of the strangers the previous evening, by greeting them with one of its sweetest Highland smiles in the morning.  When Mr Sudberry, in the exuberance of his delight, ran without hat or coat to a neighbouring knoll, accompanied by all his children, the scene that met his eye was one of surpassing grandeur and beauty.  The mists of early morning were rolling up from the loch in white, fleecy clouds, which floated over and partly concealed the sides of the mountains.  The upper wreaths of these clouds, and the crags and peaks that pierced through them were set on fire by the rising sun.  Great fissures and gorges in the hills, which at other times lay concealed in the blue haze of distance, were revealed by the mists and the slanting rays of the sun, and the incumbent cliffs, bluff promontories, and capes, were in some places sharply defined, in others luminously softened, so that the mountains displayed at once that appearance of solid reality, mingled with melting mystery, which is seen at no period of the day but early morning.  The whole scene--water, earth, and sky--was so involved, that no lines of demarcation could be traced anywhere; only bold startling points, melting into blue and white masses that mingled with each other in golden and pearly greys of every conceivable variety.  Having said thus much, we need scarcely add that the scene cannot be adequately described.  A light fragrant air met the stout Englishman as he crested the hill, and filled his unaccustomed nostrils with sensations that could not have been excelled had he been greeted by one of \"Afric's spicy gales.\"  The same air, with telegraphic speed, conveyed to the collie dogs of the place the information that the Sudberrys were abroad; whereupon the whole pack--nine in number--bounded open-mouthed up the hill, with noise and ferocity enough to have alarmed the bravest of the brave.  No wonder then that poor Jacky rushed into his father's knees, being too small to run into his arms.  But these seemingly ferocious dogs were in reality the gentlest and meekest of animals.  \"Down, Topper, down! down, Lively, lass; come into heel, Swaney,\" cried Donald McAllister, as he approached his tenants.  \"Good-mornin', miss; mornin', gentlemen.  The Ben has on its nightcap, but I'm thinkin' it'll soon take it off.\"  Donald McAllister's English was excellent, but he spoke in a slow, deliberate manner, and with a slightly nasal drawl, which sounded very peculiar in the ears of the Sudberrys,--just as peculiar, in fact, as their speech sounded in the ears of McAllister.  \"Ah! you call the white cloud on the mountain-top a nightcap?--good, very good,\" cried Mr Sudberry, rubbing his hands.  \"What a charming place this is, a paradisaical place, so to speak.  The dogs won't bite, will they?\" said he, patting the alarmed Jacky on the head.  \"No fear o' the dogs, sir,\" returned McAllister; \"they're like lambs. It's just their way.  Ye'll be for a row on the loch the day, no doot.\" The Highlander addressed this remark to George and Fred.  \"What!\" exclaimed the former, \"is there a boat that we can have the use of?\"  \"'Deed is there, a good safe boat too, that can hold the whole of ye. I'll show you where the oars lie after breakfast.\"  \"Capital,\" cried Mr Sudberry, rubbing his hands.  \"Charming,\" exclaimed Lucy, with sparkling eyes.  Master Jacky expressed his glee with a characteristic cheer or yell, that at once set fire to the easily inflamed spirits of the dogs, causing them to resume their excited gambols and furious barking.  This effectually stopped the conversation for five minutes.  \"I delight in boating,\" observed Fred, when McAllister had quelled the disturbance.  \"So do I,\" said his father; \"but fishing is the thing for me.  There's nothing like fishing.  You have fine trout in the lake, I believe?\"  \"Ay, an' salmon too,\" answered McAllister.  \"So I've heard, so I've heard,\" said Mr Sudberry, with a glow of excitement and pleasure on his round visage.  \"We must get our rods and tackle unpacked at once, George.  You are a great fisher, no doubt, Mr McAllister?\"  \"Well, not just that, but I do manage to fill a basket now and then, an' whiles to land a g'ilse.\"  \"A gilse!\" cried George in surprise, \"what is that?\"  \"It is a small salmon--\"  \"Oh! you mean a grilse,\" interposed Mr Sudberry.  \"Yes, I mean that, an' I said that,\" returned McAllister, slowly and with emphasis.  \"Scienteefic men are not agreed whether the g'ilse is a small salmon or not; I'm of opeenion that it is.  But whether or not, it's a famous fish on the table, and lively enough on the line to delight the heart of every true disciple of Isaac Walton.\"  \"What, you have read that charming book?\" exclaimed Mr Sudberry, looking at the rugged Highlander in some surprise.  \"Yes,\" replied the other, in the grave quiet manner that was peculiar to him; \"I took to it one winter as a sort o' recreation, after"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23507"],["title","A Short History of Pittsburgh (#1)"],["body","him to a council at      Logstown. As I had taken a good deal of notice yesterday at the      fork, my curiosity led me to examine this more particularly and I      think it greatly inferior either for defense or advantages,      especially the latter. For a fort at the fork would be equally well      situated on the Ohio and have the entire command of the      Monongahela, which runs up our settlement and is extremely well      designed for water carriage, as it is of a deep, still nature.      Besides, a fort at the fork might be built at much less expense      than at the other place.  Leaving Pittsburgh, Washington and Gist proceeded in a northeasterly direction, and after a day's journey they came upon an Indian settlement, and were constrained by the tribe to remain there for three days. A group of these Indians accompanied the two travelers to the French fort, and on the journey a large number of bear and deer were killed. At Leboeuff Washington received from the French commander a very satisfactory reply. On the trip back the two pioneers encountered almost insupportable hardships. Lacking proper food, their horses died, so that they were forced to push forward in canoes, often finding it necessary, when the creeks were frozen, to carry their craft for long stretches overland. When Venango was reached, Washington, whose clothes were now in tatters, procured an Indian costume, and he and Gist continued their way on foot, accompanied by an Indian guide. At this point an illustrious career was put in deadly peril, for on the second day of his escort, the treacherous guide deliberately fired his gun at Washington when standing only a few feet away from him. Bad marksmanship saved the intended victim, and Gist started to kill the Indian on the spot; but Washington, patient then as always, sent the savage away, giving him provisions to last until he could reach his tribe. But an apprehension of further trouble from the friends of the discomfited guide impelled the two men to travel all that night and the next day, although Washington was suffering acute agony from his frosted feet. While recrossing the Allegheny River on a rude raft, Washington fell into the icy waters and was saved by Gist from drowning only after the greatest efforts had been employed to rescue him. Reaching Herr's Island (within the present city limits), they built a fire and camped there for the night, but in the morning Gist's hands were frozen. The bitter cold had now solidified the river and the two wanderers passed over it on foot. By noon they had reached the home of John Frazier, at Turtle Creek, where they were given clothes and fresh supplies. The journey was completed in three more days, and on receiving the reply of Contrecoeur, the English began their preparations for sending troops to Pittsburgh.   IV  As soon as Washington's advice as to the location of the fort was received, Captain William Trent was despatched to Pittsburgh with a force of soldiers and workmen, packhorses, and materials, and he began in all haste to erect a stronghold. The French had already built forts on the northern lakes, and they now sent Captain Contrecoeur down the Allegheny with one thousand French, Canadians, and Indians, and eighteen pieces of cannon, in a flotilla of sixty bateaux and three hundred canoes. Trent had planted himself in Pittsburgh on February 17, 1754, a date important because it marks the first permanent white settlement there. But his work had been retarded alike by the small number of his men and the severity of the winter; and when Contrecoeur arrived in April, the young subaltern who commanded in Trent's absence surrendered the unfinished works, and was permitted to march away with his thirty-three men. The French completed the fort and named it Duquesne, in honor of the governor of Canada; and they held possession of it for four years.  Immediately on the loss of this fort, Virginia sent a force under Washington to retake it. Washington surprised a French detachment near Great Meadows, and killed their commander, Jumonville. When a larger expedition came against him, he put up a stockade near the site of Uniontown, naming it Fort Necessity, which he was compelled to yield on terms permitting him to march away with the honors of war.   V  The next year (1755) General Edward Braddock came over with two regiments of British soldiers, and after augmenting his force with Colonial troops and a few Indians, began his fatal march upon Fort Duquesne. Braddock's testy disposition, his consuming egotism, his contempt for the Colonial soldiers, and his stubborn adherence to military maxims that were inapplicable to the warfare of the wilderness, alienated the respect and confidence of the American contingent, robbed him of an easy victory, and cost him his life. Benjamin Franklin had warned him against the imminent risk of Indian ambuscades, but he had contemptuously replied: \"These savages may indeed be a formidable enemy to your raw American militia; but upon the king's regular and disciplined troops, sir, it is impossible they should make any impression.\" Some of his English staff-officers urged him to send the rangers in advance and to deploy his Indians as scouts, but he rejected their prudent suggestions with a sneer. On July 9 his army, comprising twenty-two hundred soldiers and one hundred and fifty Indians, was marching down the south bank of the Monongahela. The variant color and fashion of the expedition,--the red-coated regulars, the blue-coated Americans, the naval detachment, the rangers in deerskin shirts and leggins, the savages half-naked and befeathered, the glint of sword and gun in the hot daylight, the long wagon train, the lumbering cannon, the drove of bullocks, the royal banner and the Colonial gonfalon,--the pomp and puissance of it all composed a spectacle of martial splendor unseen in that country before. On the right was the tranquil river, and on the left the trackless wilderness whence the startled deer sprang into a deeper solitude. At noon the expedition crossed the river and pressed on toward Fort Duquesne, eight miles below, expectant of victory. What need to send out scouts when the king's troops are here? Let young George Washington and the rest urge it all they may; the thing is beneath the dignity of his majesty's general.  Meanwhile, all was not tranquil at the French fort. Surrender was talked of, but Captain Beaujeu determined to lead a force out to meet the approaching army. Taking with him a total effective of thirty-six officers and cadets, seventy-two regular soldiers, one hundred and forty-six Canadians, and about six hundred Indian warriors, a command less than half the number of the enemy, he sallied out to meet him. How insignificant were the armed forces with which the two empires were now challenging each other for the splendid prize of a new world! Beaujeu, gaily clad in a fringed hunting dress, intrepidly pressed on until he came in sight of the English invaders. As soon as the alert French commander felt the hot breath of his foe he waved his hat and his faithful followers disappeared behind rocks and trees as if the very earth had swallowed them.  The unsuspecting English came on. But here, when they have crossed, is a level plain, elevated but a few feet above the surface of the river, extending nearly half a mile landwards, and then gradually ascending into thickly wooded hills, with Fort Duquesne beyond. The troops in front had crossed the plain and plunged into the road through the forest for a hundred feet when a heavy discharge of musketry and arrows was poured upon them, which wrought in them a consternation all the greater because they could see no foe anywhere. They shot at random, and not without effect, for when Beaujeu fell the Canadians began to flee and the Indians quailed in their covers before the cannon fire of the English. But the French fighters were rallied back to their hidden recesses, and they now kept up an incessant and destructive fire. In this distressing situation the English fell back into the plain. Braddock rode in among them, and he and his officers persistently endeavored to rally them, but without success. The Colonial troops adopted the Indian method, and each man fought for himself behind a tree. This was forbidden by Braddock, who attempted to form his men in platoons and columns, making their slaughter inevitable. The French and Indians, concealed in the ravines and behind trees, kept up a cruel and deadly fire, until the British soldiers lost all presence of mind and began to shoot each other and their own officers, and hundreds were thus slain. The Virginia companies charged gallantly up a hill with a loss of but three men, but when they reached the summit the British soldiery, mistaking them for the enemy, fired upon them, killing fifty out of eighty men. The Colonial troops then resumed the Indian fashion of fighting from behind trees, which provoked Braddock, who had had five horses killed under him in three hours, to storm at them and strike them with his sword. At this moment he was fatally wounded, and many of his men now fled away from the hopeless action, not waiting to hear their general's fainting order to retreat. Washington had had two horses killed and received three bullets through his coat. Being the only mounted officer who was not disabled, he drew up the troops still on the field, directed their retreat, maintaining himself at the rear with great coolness and courage, and brought away his wounded general. Sixty-four British and American officers, and nearly one thousand privates, were killed or wounded in this battle, while the total French and Indian loss was not over sixty. A few prisoners captured by the Indians were brought to Pittsburgh and burnt at the stake. Four days after the fight Braddock died, exclaiming to the last, \"Who would have thought it!\"   VI  Despondency seized the English settlers after Braddock's"]]]
