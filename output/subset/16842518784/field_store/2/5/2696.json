It is the duty of a gentleman who has a lady under his charge, in making a journey, to consult her wishes, and to conform to them so far as it is possible, in determining where to go, and in making all the general arrangements of the journey. But when these points are decided upon, every thing in respect to the practical carrying into effect of the plans thus formed should be left to the gentleman, as the executive officer of the party; just as in respect to affairs relating to housekeeping, or any thing else relating to a lady's department, the lady should be left free to act according to her own judgment and taste in arranging details, while in the general plans she conforms to the wishes of her husband. For a lady, when travelling, to be continually making suggestions and proposals about the baggage or the conveyances, and expressing dissatisfaction, or wish for changes in this, that, or the other, is as much a violation of propriety as it would be for the gentleman to go into the kitchen, and there propose petty changes in respect to the mode of cooking the dinner--or to stand by his wife at her work table, and wish to have her thread changed from this place to that--or to have some different stitch to be used in making a seam. A lady very naturally feels disturbed if she finds that her husband does not have confidence enough in her to trust her with such details.  \"I will make or mend for you whatever you may desire,\" she might say, \"and I will get for your dinner any thing that you ask for; but in the way of doing it you ought to leave every thing to my direction. It is better to let me have my own way, even if your way is better than mine. For in matters of direction there ought always to be only one head, even if it is not a very good one.\"  And in the same manner a gentleman might say when travelling with a lady,--  \"I will arrange the journey to suit your wishes as far as is practicable, and will go at such times and by such conveyances as you may desire. I will also, at all the places where we stop, take you to visit such objects of interest and curiosity as you wish to see. But then when it comes to the details of the arrangements to be made,--the orders to servants and commissioners, the determination of the times for setting out, and the bargains to be made with coachmen and innkeepers,--it is best to leave all those things to me; for it always makes confusion to have two persons give directions at the same time.\"  To say this would be right in both cases,--there must always be _one_ to command. A great many families are kept in continual confusion by there being two or more ladies who consider themselves more or less at the head of it--as, for instance, a wife and a sister, or two sisters and a mother. Napoleon used to say that _one_ bad general was better than _two_ good ones; so important is it in war to have unity of command. It is not much less important in social life.  Mrs. Parkman did not understand this principle. Mr. George had seen an example of her mode of management a day or two before, in taking a walk with her and her husband in London. They were going to see the tunnel under the Thames, which was three or four miles down the river from Morley's Hotel, where they were all lodging.  \"Which way would you like to go?\" asked Mr. Parkman.  \"Is there more than one way?\" asked his wife.  \"Yes,\" said Mr. Parkman, \"we can take a Hansom cab, and drive down through the streets, or we can walk down to the river side, and there take a boat. The boats are a great deal the cheapest, and the most amusing; but the cab will be the most easy and comfortable, and the most genteel. We shall have to walk nearly half a mile before we get to the landing of the boats.\"  \"Is there much difference in the price?\" asked Mrs. Parkman.  \"Not enough to be of any consequence,\" replied her husband. \"It will make a difference of about one and a half crown; for by the boats it would be only two or three pence, while by the cab it will be as many shillings. But that is of no consequence. We will go whichever way you think you would enjoy the most.\"  \"You may decide for me,\" said Mrs. Parkman. \"I'll leave it entirely to you. It makes no difference to me.\"  \"Then, on the whole, I think we will try the boat,\" said Mr. Parkman; \"it will be so much more amusing, and we shall see so much more of London life. Besides, we shall often read and hear about the steamers on the Thames when we return to America, and it will be well for us to have made one voyage in them. And, Mr. George, will you go with us?\"  \"Yes,\" said Mr. George.  So they all left the hotel together, and commenced their walk towards the bridge where the nearest landing stage for the Thames boats lay.  They had not gone but a very short distance before Mrs. Parkman began to hang rather heavily upon her husband's arm, and asked him whether it was much farther that they would have to walk.  \"O, yes,\" said Mr. Parkman. \"I told you that we should have to walk about half a mile.\"  \"Then we shall get all tired out,\" said his wife, \"and we want our strength for walking through the tunnel. It does not seem to be worth while to take all this trouble just to save half a crown.\"  Mr. Parkman, though he had only been married a little more than a month, felt something like a sense of indignation rising in his breast, that his wife should attribute to him such a motive for choosing the river, after what he had said on the subject. But he suppressed the feeling, and only replied quietly,--  \"O, let us take a cab then, by all means. I hope you don't suppose that I was going to take you by the boat to save any money.\"  \"I thought you said that you would save half a crown,\" rejoined his wife.  \"Yes,\" said Mr. Parkman, \"I did, it is true.\"  Mr. Parkman was too proud to defend himself from such an imputation, supported by such reasoning as this; so he only said, \"We will go by a cab. We will take a cab at the next stand.\"  Mr. George instantly perceived that by this change in the plan, he was made one too many for the party, since only two can ride conveniently in a Hansom cab.[2] So he said at once, that he would adhere to the original plan, and go by water.  [Footnote 2: A Hansom cab is made like an old-fashioned chaise, only that it is set very low, so that it is extremely easy to step in and out of it, and the seat of the driver is high up behind. The driver drives _over the top of the chaise_! Thus the view for the passengers riding inside is wholly unobstructed, and this makes the Hansom cab a very convenient and pleasant vehicle for two persons to ride in, through the streets of a new and strange town.]  \"But, first,\" said he, \"I will go with you to the stand, and see you safe in a cab.\"  So they turned into another street, and presently they came to a stand. There was a long row of cabs there, of various kinds, all waiting to be employed. Among them were several Hansoms.  Mr. Parkman looked along the line to select one that had a good horse. The distance was considerable that they had to go, and besides Mr. Parkman knew that his wife liked always to go fast. So when he had selected the best looking horse, he made a signal to the driver. The driver immediately left the stand, and drove over to the sidewalk where Mr. Parkman and his party were waiting.  Mr. Parkman immediately opened the door of the cab to allow his wife to go in; but she, instead of entering, began to look scrutinizingly into it, and hung back.  \"Is this a nice cab?\" said she. \"It seems to me that I have seen nicer cabs than this.  \"Let us look,\" she added, \"and see if there is not a better one somewhere along the line.\"  The cabman, looking down from his exalted seat behind the vehicle, said that there was not a nicer cab than his in London.  \"O, of course,\" said Mrs. Parkman. \"They always say that. But _I_ can find a nicer one, I'm sure, somewhere in the line.\"  So saying she began to move on. Mr. Parkman gave the cabman a silver sixpence--which is equal to a New York shilling--to compensate him for having been called off from his station, and then followed his wife across the street to the side where the cabs were standing. Mrs. Parkman led the way all down the line, examining each hack as she passed it; but she did not find any one that looked as well as the first.  [Illustration: THE HANSOM CAB.]  \"After all,\" said she, \"we might as well go back and take the first one.\" So she turned and began to retrace her steps--the two gentlemen accompanying her. But when they got back they found that the one which Mr. Parkman had first selected was gone. It had been taken by another customer.  Mr. George was now entirely out of patience; but he controlled himself sufficiently to suppress all outward manifestation of it, only saying that he believed he would not wait any longer.  \"I will go down to the river,\" said he, \"and take a boat, and when you get a carriage you can go by land. I will wait for you at the entrance to the tunnel.\"  So he went away; and as soon as he turned the corner of the street he snapped his fingers and nodded his head with the air of a man who has just made a very lucky escape.  \"I thank my stars,\" said he to himself, \"that I have not got such a lady as that to take care of. Handsome as she is, I would not have her for a travelling companion on any account whatever.\"  It was from having witnessed several such exhibitions of character as this that Mr. George had expressed himself so strongly to Rollo on the subject of joining Mr. Parkman and his wife in making the tour of Holland.  But notwithstanding Mr. George's determination that he would not travel in company with such a lady, it seemed to be decreed that he should do so, for he left London about a week after this to go to Holland with Rollo alone; and though he postponed setting out for several days, so as to allow Mr. and Mrs. Parkman time to get well under way before them, he happened to fall in"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22991"],["title","Boy Scouts Mysterious Signal; Or, Perils of the Black Bear Patrol (#1)"],["body"," make Jimmie go along and fight the allies?\" questioned Jack.  \"If they do that, he may get killed.\"  \"Perhaps that would suit the German Captain as well as anything else,\" observed Ned.  \"It would save him the trouble and responsibility of ordering the red-head shot immediately.\"  \"Then in that case,\" continued Jack, \"I second Harry's motion and hope it is carried unanimously.  Let's get busy and get the boy.\"  \"I think you are right,\" agreed Ned.  \"Now, if we can have some plan of action we'll be able to make more headway than without it.\"  \"Right you are, Scout Master!\" cried Jack.  \"What is your plan?\"  \"Well,\" began Ned, glancing at his comrades, \"it seems almost too bold a thing to try just at first thought, but I can't think of anything better than to try to get away from this place in the Eagle, and then watch our chance to kidnap Jimmie from those fellows.\"  \"A fine idea!\" was Harry's almost cheerful response.  \"Ned, there's nothing too bold to try once, anyway.  Maybe we can get Jimmie out of their hands.  If we ever do--\"  Harry's clenched first, which he shook at the door out of which the Germans had led Jimmie, spoke more eloquently than his unfinished sentence.  Plainly he was ready for action.  \"Let's slip out of here while we have a chance,\" suggested Ned.  \"Just the thing!\" agreed Jack.  \"It's the best time we'll ever find. The incoming army is pretty busy just now and won't see us.\"  With one accord the three lads moved toward the door.  Ned glanced around the partially wrecked apartment in the hope of discovering something that would be of use to them in their endeavor to help Jimmie escape.  An object in one corner caught his attention.  As Ned stepped forward to examine the object he had seen, he was startled to hear a cry from Jack, who had been looking from a window.  \"Look!\" cried the boy, pointing toward the street.  \"They're actually making Jimmie take an oath of enlistment!\"  Quickly joining Jack, Ned and Harry saw Jimmie standing in the street, surrounded by German soldiers wearing the uniforms of Uhlans.  Directly behind the lad stood one of the soldiers with the muzzle of a gun pressed against Jimmie's back.  Before him an officer stood, apparently administering some form of oath.  The three boys could see Jimmie's lips move in response to the prompting of the officer.  Directly the ceremony was ended and the soldiers turned as if preparing to mount their horses, standing near.  \"There's a bunch coming back to this house!\" declared Jack.  \"Wonder what they want?\" mused Harry in a puzzled manner.  \"I think they have decided they want three more recruits!\"  \"Good night!\" was the lad's startled ejaculation.  \"Let's go!\"  \"Come over here,\" directed Ned, springing toward a corner of the room. \"I think I've found something that will help us out.\"     CHAPTER II  A FRIEND APPEARS  Harry and Jack hastened to cross the room strewn with wreckage left by the exploding shell.  Ned was already kneeling in the corner.  \"What is it, Ned?\" cried Jack excitedly.  \"Have you got a gun?\"  \"No, not a gun,\" replied Ned in suppressed excitement, \"but it may prove more useful than a gun at this time.\"  \"Oh, I see what it is!\" was Harry's exclamation.  \"Hurrah!  We may be able to beat them out after all.  Hurry!\"  \"Huh!\" scornfully put in Jack.  \"Nothing but a trap door into the cellar!  I wouldn't give much for that!\"  Ned, without replying to either lad, was busily scraping away the refuse from the corner.  Almost concealed by the litter, he had seen a huge ring in the floor and, naturally concluding that it was fitted into a trap door, had begun an investigation for the purpose of discovering if the door led to a passage that might afford a means of escape for the lads.  The proximity of the approaching soldiers made their need of some haven of refuge an imperative one.  Presently Ned discovered the outlines of the trap door, which he had correctly surmised to be in that spot.  The location of the debris favored the quick plan that had formulated in Ned's fertile brain.  He rose to his feet and gave a quick glance about the room.  Without wasting time or effort in conversation, the lad quickly pointed toward a table that lay upturned not far from the trap door. Signalling to his comrades for assistance, he darted toward the object and began dragging it to a position directly over the trap door.  Jack and Harry, divining his intention, hastened to assist Ned.  Their united efforts soon placed the table in position.  It was the work of but a moment to raise the trap door and prop it up with a short piece of wood from the wreckage strewn about.  Making the well-known signal used by railroad men in the United States as a sign for a fireman to shovel more coal into the firebox, Ned urged the others to descend into the darkness that yawned mysteriously at their feet.  Jack was first through the opening.  He clung to the rim for a moment with his hands.  Then he released his hold and dropped.  Harry and Ned, impatiently waiting for Jack to pass through the door, heard him drop to a floor below and give a startled cry.  Then they prepared to follow just as the tramp of many feet resounded through the passage outside the room.  Harry slipped into the opening and in turn dropped out of sight.  Ned followed feet first and for an instant hung from the sill.  Grasping the stick that had been used as a prop, Ned gave a mighty wrench backward and fell.  He said afterward that it seemed as if he had taken a full week to drop from his position to the floor below.  In reality the drop was not a great one.  The distance was, however, greater than the height of any of the three boys, and explained their inability to gain a foothold before releasing their hold upon the floor above.  For a moment Ned was unable to regain his breath.  Presently he sat upright and began to search for his comrades.  \"Jack, Harry!\" he called softly.  \"Where are you?\"  \"Here we are, Ned,\" came a whisper from the darkness that shut the boys in on every hand.  \"Can you see us?\"  \"Can't see a thing!\" declared Ned.  \"Where are you, anyway?\"  \"Stay right where you are and we'll be there in a moment,\" was Harry's answer.  \"This is one horrible place or I'm a Dutchman!\"  \"Come on, then, and be quick about it,\" urged Ned.  \"I wonder if we have dropped out of the frying pan into the fire,\" he added.  \"Impossible,\" chuckled Jack, in spite of the seriousness of their predicament.  \"Where there's fire there's light, and I can't see a single ray of light in this miserable place!\"  \"Hush, Jack!\" cautioned Harry.  \"Not so loud or they'll find us.  Can't you hear them tramping about in the room above?\"  Harry's question brought Ned and Jack to a realization of the fact that the room they had so recently quitted was occupied by the soldiers from whom they had tried to escape.  Footsteps echoed along the stout floor, and the boys could hear sounds indicating that pieces of furniture were being hurriedly overturned.  \"Uh!\" grunted Jack as he suddenly bumped into Ned.  \"Wonder you wouldn't blow signals when you're going to cross ahead of a fellow.\"  \"Hush!\" whispered Ned.  \"They may hear us!  Let's wait a bit!\"  All three boys drew close together.  They instinctively clasped hands in the darkness, looking for some degree of comfort in the act.  The noises above them gradually lessened.  Presently they ceased altogether, and the boys could hear footsteps clattering along the floor in the direction they assumed the door to be.  Directly quiet reigned in the place.  \"They've gone, I guess,\" Ned said after a moment's wait.  \"Now what shall we do?  Shall we climb back into the house?\"  \"I move that we explore this apartment first,\" said Jack.  \"Oh, no!\" urged Harry.  \"This isn't a nice place to go poking around in.  We have troubles enough already without hunting more.\"  \"What's your objection to looking the place over?\" asked Ned.  \"Rats!\" was Harry's brief but expressive explanation.  \"Rats?\" queried Ned.  \"What do you mean?  Are there rats here?\"  \"There certainly are, and lots of them,\" was the positive answer. \"When I dropped into this place I think I dropped onto one, and must have crushed him before he had time to squeal.  I heard others running.\"  \"We really ought to make a light,\" returned Ned.  \"We can't tell what the place is like without some way of seeing it.\"  \"There's a light!\" was Jack's sudden exclamation.  \"See it over there to the right.  Why,\" he added, \"there are two lights!\"  \"And I see others!\" cried Harry.  \"I believe it's the eyes of the rats. Perhaps they were frightened away and are coming back.\"  \"Have you any matches?\" asked Ned.  \"I haven't a one with me.  It's careless, I know, but not a match can I find in my pockets.\"  \"Where's your searchlight?\" inquired Jack.  \"Haven't you that?\"  \"No; the Germans took that away from me when they searched us.\"  \"I have two matches,\" said Harry, \"but I don't want to waste them. Perhaps it will be a long time before we get any more, and I feel that we ought to save them if possible.\"  \"Maybe we can find some stuff here dry enough to make a fire with, and that'll give us light!\" suggested Jack.  \"Good idea!\" responded Ned.  \"The place feels dry enough.\"  \"Let's keep hold of hands and move slowly about,\" put in Harry.  \"In that way we won't be separated and may find just what we want.\"  Acting on this suggestion, the boys clasped hands and moved slowly about, feeling their way cautiously with their feet.  They seemed to be in a cellar with a solid stone floor that had been made quite smooth.  \"Here's something!\" exclaimed Harry as his foot struck a small object. \"This feels like a piece of wood.\"  \"Here's my knife; let's whittle some shavings,\" offered Jack.  In a short time the boy had succeeded in producing the desired shavings from the board Harry had discovered.  Gathering these carefully in his hands, he held them ready to receive the flame from Harry's match.  All three lads eagerly gathered closer "]]]
