He selected a single lead, apparently, Malone thought, at random. \"This electrode--\"  \"Just a moment, Doctor,\" Burris said. He was eyeing the machine with a combination of suspicion and awe. \"A while back you mentioned something about 'outside influences.' Just what, specifically, does that mean?\"  With some regret, Dr. O'Connor dropped the lead. \"Telepathy,\" he said. \"By outside influences, I meant influences on the mind, such as telepathy or mind-reading of some nature.\"  \"I see,\" Burris said. \"You can detect a telepath with this machine.\"  \"I'm afraid--\"  \"Well, some kind of a mind-reader anyhow,\" Burris said. \"We won't quarrel about terms.\"  \"Certainly not,\" Dr. O'Connor said. The smile he turned on Burris was as cold and empty as the inside of Orbital Station One. \"What I meant was--if you will permit me to continue--that we cannot detect any sort of telepathy or mind-reader with this device. To be frank, I very much wish that we could; it would make everything a great deal simpler. However, the laws of psionics don't seem to operate that way.\"  \"Well, then,\" Burris said, \"what does the thing do?\" His face wore a mask of confusion. Momentarily, Malone felt sorry for his chief. He could remember how he'd felt, himself, when that law professor had come up with a particularly baffling question in class.  \"This machine,\" Dr. O'Connor said with authority, \"detects the slight variations in mental activity that occur when a person's mind is _being_ read.\"  \"You mean, if my mind were being read right now--\"  \"Not right now,\" Dr. O'Connor said. \"You see, the bulk of this machine is in Nevada; the structure is both too heavy and too delicate for transport. And there are other qualifications--\"  \"I meant theoretically,\" Burris said.  \"Theoretically--\" Dr. O'Connor began, and smiled again--\"Theoretically, if your mind were being read, this machine would detect it, supposing that the machine were in operating condition and all of the other qualifications had been met. You see, Mr. Burris, no matter how poor a telepath a man may be, he has some slight ability--even if only very slight--to detect the fact that his mind is being read.\"  \"You mean, if somebody was reading my mind, I'd know it?\" Burris said. His face showed, Malone realized, that he plainly disbelieved this statement.  \"You would know it,\" Dr. O'Connor said, \"but you would never know you knew it. To elucidate: in a normal person--like you, for instance, or even like myself--the state of having one's mind read merely results in a vague, almost sub-conscious feeling of irritation, something that could easily be attributed to minor worries, or fluctuations in one's hormonal balance. The hormonal balance, Mr. Burris, is--\"  \"Thank you,\" Burris said with a trace of irritation. \"I know what hormones are.\"  \"Ah. Good,\" Dr. O'Connor said equably. \"In any case, to continue: this machine interprets those specific feelings as indications that the mind is being--ah--'eavesdropped' upon.\"  You could almost see the quotation marks around what Dr. O'Connor considered slang dropping into place, Malone thought.  \"I see,\" Burris said with a disappointed air. \"But what do you mean, it won't detect a telepath? Have you ever actually worked with a telepath?\"  \"Certainly we have,\" Dr. O'Connor said. \"If we hadn't, how would we be able to tell that the machine was, in fact, indicating the presence of telepathy? The theoretical state of the art is not, at present, sufficiently developed to enable us to--\"  \"I see,\" Burris said hurriedly. \"Only wait a minute.\"  \"Yes?\"  \"You mean you've actually got a real mind-reader? You've found one? One that works?\"  Dr. O'Connor shook his head sadly. \"I'm afraid I should have said, Mr. Burris, that we did once have one,\" he admitted. \"He was, unfortunately, an imbecile, with a mental age between five and six, as nearly as we were ever able to judge.\"  \"An imbecile?\" Burris said. \"But how were you able to--\"  \"He could repeat a person's thoughts word for word,\" Dr. O'Connor said. \"Of course, he was utterly incapable of understanding the meaning behind them. That didn't matter; he simply repeated whatever you were thinking. Rather disconcerting.\"  \"I'm sure,\" Burris said. \"But he was really an imbecile? There wasn't any chance of--\"  \"Of curing him?\" Dr. O'Connor said. \"None, I'm afraid. We did at one time feel that there had been a mental breakdown early in the boy's life, and, indeed, it's perfectly possible that he was normal for the first year or so. The records we did manage to get on that period, however, were very much confused, and there was never any way of telling anything at all, for certain. It's easy to see what caused the confusion, of course: telepathy in an imbecile is rather an oddity-- and any normal adult would probably be rather hesitant about admitting that he was capable of it. That's why we have not found another subject; we must merely sit back and wait for lightning to strike.\"  Burris sighed. \"I see your problem,\" he said. \"But what happened to this imbecile boy of yours?\"  \"Very sad,\" Dr. O'Connor said. \"Six months ago, at the age of fifteen, the boy simply died. He simply--gave up, and died.\"  \"Gave up?\"  \"That was as good an explanation as our medical department was able to provide, Mr. Burris. There was some malfunction--but--we like to say that he simply gave up. Living became too difficult for him.\"  \"All right,\" Burris said after a pause. \"This telepath of yours is dead, and there aren't any more where he came from. Or if there are, you don't know how to look for them. All right. But to get back to this machine of yours: it couldn't detect the boy's ability?\"  Dr. O'Connor shook his head. \"No, I'm afraid not. We've worked hard on that problem at Westinghouse, Mr. Burris, but we haven't yet been able to find a method of actually detecting telepaths.\"  \"But you can detect--\"  \"That's right,\" Dr. O'Connor said. \"We can detect the fact that a man's mind is being read.\" He stopped, and his face became suddenly morose. When he spoke again, he sounded guilty, as if he were making an admission that pained him. \"Of course, Mr. Burris, there's nothing we can do about a man's mind being read. Nothing whatever.\" He essayed a grin that didn't look very healthy. \"But at least,\" he said, \"you know you're being spied on.\"  Burris grimaced. There was a little silence while Dr. O'Connor stroked the metal box meditatively, as if it were the head of his beloved.  At last, Burris said: \"Dr. O'Connor, how sure can you be of all this?\"  The look he received made all the previous conversation seem as warm and friendly as a Christmas party by comparison. It was a look that froze the air of the room into a solid chunk, Malone thought, a chunk you could have chipped pieces from, for souvenirs, later, when Dr. O'Connor had gone and you could get into the room without any danger of being quick-frozen by the man's unfriendly eye.  \"Mr. Burris,\" Dr. O'Connor said in a voice that matched the temperature of his gaze, \"please. Remember our slogan.\"                                * * * * *  Malone sighed. He fished in his pocket for a pack of cigarettes, found one, and extracted a single cigarette. He stuck it in his mouth and started fishing in various pockets for his lighter.  He sighed again. Perfectly honestly, he preferred cigars, a habit he'd acquired from the days when he'd filched them from his father's cigar- case. But his mental picture of a fearless and alert young FBI agent didn't include a cigar. Somehow, remembering his father as neither fearless nor, exactly, alert--anyway, not the way the movies and the TV screens liked to picture the words--he had the impression that cigars looked out of place on FBI agents.  And it was, in any case, a small sacrifice to make. He found his lighter and shielded it from the brisk wind. He looked out over water at the Jefferson Memorial, and was surprised that he'd managed to walk as far as he had. Then he stopped thinking about walking, and took a puff of his cigarette, and forced himself to think about the job in hand.  Naturally, the Westinghouse gadget had been declared Ultra Top Secret as soon as it had been worked out. Virtually everything was, these days. And the whole group involved in the machine and its workings had been transferred without delay to the United States Laboratories out in Yucca Flats, Nevada.  Out there in the desert, there just wasn't much to do, Malone supposed, except to play with the machine. And, of course, look at the scenery. But when you've seen one desert, Malone thought confusedly, you've seen them all.  So, the scientists ran experiments on the machine, and they made a discovery of a kind they hadn't been looking for.  Somebody, they discovered, was picking the brains of the scientists there.  Not the brains of the people working with the telepathy machine.  And not the brains of the people working on the several other Earth- limited projects at Yucca Flats.  They'd been reading the minds of some of the scientists working on the new and highly classified non-rocket space drive.  In other words, the Yucca Flats plant was infested with a telepathic spy. And how do you go about finding a telepath? Malone sighed. Spies that got information in any of the usual ways were tough enough to locate. A telepathic spy was a lot tougher proposition.  Well, one thing about Andrew J. Burris. He had an answer for everything. Malone thought of what his chief had said: \"It takes a thief to catch a thief. And if the Westinghouse machine won't locate a telepathic spy, I know what will.\"  \"What?\" Malone had asked.  \"It's simple,\" Burris had said. \"Another telepath. There has to be one around somewhere. Westinghouse did have one, after all, and the Russians _still_ have one. Malone, that's your job: go out and find me a telepath.\"  Burris had an answer for everything, all right, Malone thought. But he couldn't see where the answer did him very much good."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22338"],["title","The Impossibles (#1)"],["body","I'm out of danger.\"  \"Get his wallet,\" Sam said. \"I'll watch him.\"  A hand went into Malone's jacket pocket. It tickled a little bit, but Malone didn't think of objecting. Naturally enough, the hand and Malone's wallet did not make an instantaneous connection. When the hand touched the bulky object strapped near Malone's armpit, it stopped, frozen, and then cautiously snaked the object out.  \"What's that, Bill?\" Sam said.  Bill looked up with the object in his hand. He seemed a little dazed. \"It's a gun,\" he said.  \"My God,\" Sam said. \"The guy's heeled! Watch him! Don't let him get away!\"  Malone considered getting away, and decided that he couldn't move. \"It's okay,\" he said.  \"Okay, hell,\" Sam said. \"It's a .44 Magnum. What are you doing with a gun, Mac?\" He was no longer polite and friendly. \"Why [are] you carrying a gun?\" he said.  \"I'm not carrying it,\" Malone said tiredly. \"Bill is. Your pal.\"  Bill backed away from Malone, putting the Magnum in his pocket and keeping the FBI agent covered with his own Police Positive. At the same time, he fished out the personal radio every patrolman carried in his uniform, and began calling for a prowl car in a low, somewhat nervous voice.  Sam said, \"My God. A gun. He could of shot everybody.\"  \"Get his wallet,\" Bill said. \"He can't hurt you now. I disarmed him.\"  Malone began to feel slightly dangerous. Maybe he _was_ a famous gangster. He wasn't sure. Maybe all this about being an FBI agent was just a figment of his imagination. Blows on the head did funny things. \"I'll drill everybody full of holes,\" he said in a harsh, underworld sort of voice, but it didn't sound very convincing. Sam approached him gently and fished out his wallet with great care, as if Malone were a ticking bomb ready to go off any second.  There was a little silence. Then Sam said, \"Give him his gun back, Bill,\" in a hushed and respectful tone.  \"Give him back his gun?\" the big cop said. \"You gone nuts, Sam?\"  Sam shook his head slowly. \"Nope,\" he said. \"But we made a terrible mistake. Know who this guy is?\"  \"He's heeled,\" Bill said. \"That's all I want to know.\" He put the radio away and gave all his attention to Malone.  \"He's FBI,\" Sam said. \"The wallet says so. Badge and everything. And not only that, Bill. He's Kenneth J. Malone.\"  Well, Malone thought with relief, that settled that. He wasn't a gangster after all. He was just the FBI agent he had always known and loved. Maybe now the cops would do-something about his head and take him away for burial.  \"Malone?\" Bill said. \"You mean the guy who's here about all those red Cadillacs?\"  \"Sure,\" Sam said. \"So give him his gun back.\" He looked at Malone. \"Listen, Mr. Malone,\" he said. \"We're sorry. We're sorry as hell.\"  \"That's all right,\" Malone said absently. He moved his head slowly and looked around. His suspicions were confirmed. There wasn't a red Cadillac anywhere in sight, and from the looks of the street there never had been. \"It's gone,\" he said, but the cops weren't listening.  \"We better get you to a hospital,\" Bill said. \"As soon as the prowl car gets here, we'll take you right on down to St. Vincent's. Can you tell us what happened? Or is it classified?\"  Malone wondered what could be classified about a blow on the head, and decided not to think about it. \"I can tell you,\" he said, \"if you'll answer one question for me.\"  \"Sure, Mr. Malone,\" Bill said. \"We'll be glad to help.\"  \"Anything at all,\" Sam said.  Malone gave them what he hoped was a gracious and condescending smile. \"All right, then,\" he said. \"Where the hell am I?\"  \"In New York,\" Sam said.  \"I know that,\" Malone said tiredly. \"Anywhere in particular, or just sort of all over New York?\"  \"Ninth Street,\" Bill said hurriedly. \"Near the Village. Is that where you were when they slugged you?\"  \"I guess so,\" Malone said. \"Sure.\" He nodded, and immediately remembered that he shouldn't have. He closed his eyes until the pain had softened to agony, and then opened them again. \"I was getting pretty tired of sitting around waiting for something to break on this case,\" he said, \"and I couldn't sleep, so I went out for a walk. I ended up in Greenwich Village--which is a hell of a place for a self-respecting man to end up.\"  \"I know just what you mean,\" Sam said sympathetically. \"Bohemians, they call themselves. Crazy people.\"  \"Not the people,\" Malone said. \"The streets. I got sort of lost.\" Chicago, he reflected, was a long way from the easiest city in the world to get around in. And he supposed you could even get confused in Washington if you tried hard enough. But he knew those cities. He could find his way around in them. Greenwich Village was different.  It was harder to navigate in than the trackless forests of the Amazon. The Village had tracks, all right--thousands of tracks. Only none of them led anywhere in particular.  \"Anyhow,\" Malone said, \"I saw this red Cadillac.\"  The cops looked around hurriedly and then looked back at Malone. Bill started to say, \"But there isn't any--\"  \"I know,\" Malone said. \"It's gone now. That's the trouble.\"  \"You mean somebody got in and drove it away?\" Sam said.  \"For all I know,\" Malone said, \"it sprouted wings and flew away.\" He paused. \"When I saw it, though--when I saw it, I decided to go over and have a look. Just in case.\"  \"Sure,\" Bill said. \"Makes sense.\" He stared at his partner as if defying him to prove it didn't make sense. Malone didn't really care.  \"There wasn't anybody else on the street,\" he said, \"so I walked over and tried the door. That's all. I didn't even open the car or anything. And I'll swear there was nobody behind me.\"  \"Well,\" Sam said, \"the street was empty when we got here.\"  \"But a guy could have driven off in that red Cadillac before we got here,\" Bill said.  \"Sure,\" Malone said. \"But where did he come from? I figured maybe somebody dropped something by mistake--a safe or something. Because there wasn't anybody behind me.\"  \"There had to be,\" Bill said.  \"Well,\" Malone said, \"there wasn't.\"  There was a little silence.  \"What happened then?\" Sam said. \"After you tried the door handle, I mean.\"  \"Then?\" Malone said. \"Then I went out like a light.\"  A pair of headlights rounded the nearby corner. Bill looked up. \"That's the prowl car,\" he announced, and went over to meet it.  The driver was a solidly built little man with the face of a Pekingese. His partner, a tall man who looked as if he'd have been much more comfortable in a ten-gallon Stetson instead of the regulation blue cap, leaned out at Bill, Sam, and Malone.  \"What's the trouble here?\" he said in a harsh, high voice.  \"No trouble,\" Bill said, and went over to the car. He began talking to the two cops inside in a low, urgent voice. Meanwhile, Sam got his arm around Malone and began pulling him away from the lamp post.  Malone was a little unwilling to let go, at first. But Sam was stronger than he looked. He convoyed the FBI agent carefully to the rear door of the prowl car, opened it and levered Malone gently to a seat inside, just as Bill said, \"So with the cut and all, we figured he ought to go over to St. Vincent's. You people were already on the way, so we didn't bother with ambulances.\"  The driver snorted. \"Next time you want taxi service,\" he said, \"you just call us up. What do you think, a prowl car's an easy life?\"  \"Easier than doing a beat,\" Bill said mournfully. \"And anyway,\" he added in a low, penetrating whisper, \"the guy's FBI.\"  \"So the FBI's got all kinds of equipment,\" the driver said. \"The latest. Why don't he whistle up a helicopter or a jet?\" Then, apparently deciding that further invective would get him nowhere, he settled back in his seat, said, \"Aah, forget it,\" and started the car with a small but perceptible jerk.  Malone decided not to get into the argument. He was tired, and it was late. He rested his head on the back seat and tried to relax, but all he could do was think about red Cadillacs.  He wished he had never even heard of red Cadillacs.                                     2  And it had all started so simply, too. Malone remembered very clearly the first time he had had any indication that red Cadillacs were anything unusual, or special. Before that, he'd viewed them all with slightly wistful eyes: red, blue, green, gray, white, or even black Cadillacs were all the same to him. They spelled luxury and wealth and display, and a lot of other nice things.  Now, he wasn't at all sure what they spelled. Except that it was definitely uncomfortable, and highly baffling.  He'd walked into the offices of Andrew J. Burris, Director of the FBI, just one week ago. It was a beautiful office, pine-paneled and spacious, and it boasted an enormous polished desk. And behind the desk sat Burris himself, looking both tired and somehow a little kindly.  \"You sent for me, Chief?\" Malone said.  \"That's right.\" Burris nodded. \"Malone, you've been working too hard lately.\"  Now, Malone thought, it was coming. The dismissal he'd always feared. At last Burris had found out that he wasn't the bright, intelligent, fearless, and alert FBI agent he was supposed to be. Burris had discovered that he was nothing more or less than lucky, and that all the \"fine jobs\" he was supposed to have done were only the result of luck.  Oh, well, Malone thought. Not being an FBI agent wouldn't be so bad. He could always find another job.  Only at the moment he couldn't think of one he liked.  He decided to make one last plea. \"I haven't been working so hard, Chief,\" he said. \"Not too hard, anyhow. I'm in great shape. I--\"  \"I've taken advantage of you, Malone, that's what I've done,\" Burris said, just as if Malone hadn't spoken at all. \"Just because you're the best agent I've got, that's no reason for me to hand you all the tough ones.\"  \"Just because I'm what?\" Malone said, feeling slightly faint.  \"I've given you the tough ones because you could handle them,\" Burris said. \"But that's no reason to keep loading jobs on you. After that job you did on the "]]]
