He saw that I was accustomed to act for myself, young as I was, and that I should have less chance of slipping off the ladder, if I mounted each ratlin by myself; and he considered that as I was of somewhat a poetical temperament, if my mind received a hot bed forcing at too early an age, I should be unfitted to struggle on in this every-day working world.  Had he, as his wife recommended him, sent me to a boarding school, where I should have had everything done for me, I should probably very soon have lost that habit of dependence on my own exertions which has been the great cause of my success in life; and the routine style of education I should there have received would certainly not have compensated for the loss of the other advantage, nor would the amount of knowledge I should have gained have been in all probability in any way equal to that I obtained from my evenings' study with the good curate, Mr Hamlin.  Depend upon it, after children are shown what is right, the sooner they are taught self-reliance the better.  It is the principle I have followed out with my own, and they are now independent men, and are grateful to me for it.  I began with them as soon as they were weaned; before that time I did not consider I ought to interfere with my wife. I never let one of them have a meal before he had performed some task for it, nor a new frock or jacket.  Sometimes I would set a week's work, and let them get through it as they liked, provided they had earned their food.  I thus very early found out their characters, and the amount of perseverance and energy they possessed, and managed them accordingly.  They all got through their work in the set time, but in different ways.  One would set to work the moment he knew what he was to do, and toil away till it was completed; another would commence more leisurely, then go to some other occupation or amusement, and then return to his regular labours; a third would take the whole time to complete the undertaking, but it was invariably done well.  I taught my own boys the advantages of industry, and they soon learned to like labour for itself.  They have never been idle, and consequently have never been vicious.  For six or seven years I lived on with my old friends, spending all the day on the river assisting the boatmen to take care of their boats, and, as I grew bigger, in rowing, till I had saved enough money to get a share of a boat myself, while every evening that Mr Hamlin was able to receive me I paid him a visit.  At the time I was fourteen my wish to go to sea, grew stronger than ever, and Mr Wells at once acceded to it, and told me that he would gladly find me a berth in one of his own vessels, for he was, what I forgot before to say, an extensive shipowner.  He advised me to sell my share in the boat, and to invest the amount, with my subsequent savings, in the savings bank, telling me that he had such entire confidence in me that he would gladly advance the money for my outfit.  I was accordingly entered as an apprentice, and made my first voyage, in the good ship the _Mary Jane_, to the Brazils.  The next was round Cape Horn to the coast of Chili and Peru, and on my return I made a trip up the Baltic.  Indeed, for many years I was constantly at sea, during which time I visited various parts of the world.  When I was out of my apprenticeship I began to lay by half of my wages, and then to do a little trading on my own account, by which I made money.  I at last worked my way from before the mast to the quarter-deck, and became third officer of a fine ship trading to the Cape.  I probably should have become master of her in time, but on my return home I fell in love and married.  My wife was young, pretty, and well educated according to my taste--that is to say, she had been brought up at home by a good sensible mother, who never thought of letting her learn to play on the piano, nor to dance, nor any accomplishment useless to one in the rank she appeared destined to fill. Her father was the owner and master of a small trader running between London and Ramsgate.  After I married I made two more trips to the Cape, and on my return from the second I found my father-in-law on the point of death.  He made me promise to remain at home to take care of his widow and daughter, and on these conditions made me over his vessel and the goodwill of his trade.  For some years I followed this line with varied success, but I did not save much money, as my family increased rapidly, and my expenses were proportionably heavy.  I lost a considerable part of my savings through the failure of my poor friend Mr Wells, in whose hands my money was placed; but I did not repine at this on my own account, for I considered that the lessons he had taught me were of far more value than the amount of my wealth, but I grieved deeply that he should be the sufferer.  He was by this time an old man, and his creditors allowed him a comfortable income till his death.    CHAPTER THREE.  THE VOYAGE TO AUSTRALIA.  At length my vessel wore out, and I was compelled to build a new one. She was a fine schooner of nearly sixty tons, and was a capital sea boat.  I ran her for about three years, but I found that she was almost too good for the trade she was engaged in.  At this time I met with an old shipmate who had made several trips to New South Wales, or, as it was then called commonly, to Botany Bay, and he gave me glowing accounts of the success of some of the free settlers who had gone out there. This made me think about the subject and set to work to collect information from all the people I met who knew anything about the country.  One and all combined in asserting that it was a very fine country, and that large fortunes were to be made in one way or another, but they chiefly spoke in praise of the fine pastures for sheep which existed.  From what I could pick up, however, I surmised that the sheep in general were of a very inferior quality, and that if some of the best breeds could be introduced, not only would the colony be benefited, but the person who brought them over.  For some weeks I turned the subject in my mind.  I had plenty of time to think about it in my passages up and down the river when obliged to bring up for the tide, and at last I broached it to my wife, and told her that my opinion was that a far better livelihood might be made in the new country than such people as ourselves could hope for in England.  \"You see how it is, my dear Martha,\" I said, \"for many years your good father toiled on in this trade, and though he lived comfortably and brought you up well, he saved no money; and had he met with any reverse like the loss of his vessel the case might have been different, and he might easily have been ruined.  Now, although I have worked harder than he was able to do, and consequently have kept my head above water, with a large family and greater expenses, I also have saved little, and am sadly puzzled to know what to do with our boys, and I shall be unwilling to send our pretty girls out to service; yet if they do not marry I can never expect to leave enough to support them.  \"I have been thinking of a hundred different ways of improving our fortune in England, but not one has occurred to me in which the risk of loss has not been too great.  Thousands of families are exactly in our position, and the fathers must feel that not only have they no chance of rising in the world, but that when they die they must leave their daughters exposed to all the dangers of a life of dependence.  For the boys I fear less; they will if they survive make their own way in life as I have done, and are more fitted to bear its ups and downs.  Now, my dear wife, I know you would be ready to follow me to the end of the world, even if it were to penury or death, but I am not going to ask you to do that.  I am going to propose to go to a far distant land, where I trust we shall not only gain wealth, but happiness and contentment, and see our family happily settled.\"  My wife, as I knew she would be, was ready to enter into my views, though, as she had never been at sea further than Ramsgate, she could not help looking with some dread at the long voyage, and she had read some rather exaggerated accounts of bush-rangers and savages in Botany Bay which were enough to frighten her.  I soon, however, quieted all her fears about the voyage as well as about the savages and bush-rangers, and though I did not conceal from her that there were many difficulties to be overcome, and dangers to be encountered, I pictured the future to her in the bright colours it appeared to my own imagination.  My eldest boy was at sea, but we expected his return every day, and at all events I determined to wait his arrival.  The two next were accustomed to sail with me in the schooner, where I did my beat to give them all the learning I had gained from the good curate, Mr Hamlin, and had since then picked up by my own exertions.  Though they were still boys, they were very useful on board, and could take the helm and work the vessel as well as any grownup man.  I had eight of them, four boys and four girls, and the two youngest were still children.  The elder ones were delighted at my proposal,--the boy, at the thought of making a long sea voyage, of seeing strange lands, and hunting the kangaroo; the girl, at being able to accompany me and their brothers, and having to tend a farm, and live under a bright blue sky.  Whether it entered into the calculation of the eldest that she might be able to pick and choose a husband from the number of young men who were certain to be on the shore with speaking-trumpets to beg her to marry them, I do not pretend to say, but it was then the case as now,--no girl could remain in the colony without being asked to wed every day in the week till she made her choice.  Having made up our minds to go, the next thing "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23058"],["title","The Queen Of Spades (#1)"],["body","; then she relapsed into her former apathy.  \"Will you tell me the names of the magic cards, or not?\" asked Herman after a pause.  There was no reply.  The young man then drew a pistol from his pocket, exclaiming: \"You old witch, I'll force you to tell me!\"  At the sight of the weapon the Countess gave a second sign of life. She threw back her head and put out her hands as if to protect herself; then they dropped and she sat motionless.  Herman grasped her arm roughly, and was about to renew his threats, when he saw that she was dead!  *****  Seated in her room, still in her ball-dress, Lisaveta gave herself up to her reflections. She had expected to find the young officer there, but she felt relieved to see that he was not.  Strangely enough, that very night at the ball, Tomsky had rallied her about her preference for the young officer, assuring her that he knew more than she supposed he did.  \"Of whom are you speaking?\" she had asked in alarm, fearing her adventure had been discovered.  \"Of the remarkable man,\" was the reply. \"His name is Herman.\"  Lisa made no reply.  \"This Herman,\" continued Tomsky, \"is a romantic character; he has the profile of a Napoleon and the heart of a Mephistopheles. It is said he has at least three crimes on his conscience. But how pale you are.\"  \"It is only a slight headache. But why do you talk to me of this Herman?\"  \"Because I believe he has serious intentions concerning you.\"  \"Where has he seen me?\"  \"At church, perhaps, or on the street.\"  The conversation was interrupted at this point, to the great regret of the young girl. The words of Tomsky made a deep impression upon her, and she realized how imprudently she had acted. She was thinking of all this and a great deal more when the door of her apartment suddenly opened, and Herman stood before her. She drew back at sight of him, trembling violently.  \"Where have you been?\" she asked in a frightened whisper.  \"In the bedchamber of the Countess. She is dead,\" was the calm reply.  \"My God! What are you saying?\" cried the girl.  \"Furthermore, I believe that I was the cause of her death.\"  The words of Tomsky flashed through Lisa's mind.  Herman sat down and told her all. She listened with a feeling of terror and disgust. So those passionate letters, that audacious pursuit were not the result of tenderness and love. It was money that he desired. The poor girl felt that she had in a sense been an accomplice in the death of her benefactress. She began to weep bitterly. Herman regarded her in silence.  \"You are a monster!\" exclaimed Lisa, drying her eyes.  \"I didn't intend to kill her; the pistol was not even loaded.  \"How are you going to get out of the house?\" inquired Lisa. \"It is nearly daylight. I intended to show you the way to a secret staircase, while the Countess was asleep, as we would have to cross her chamber. Now I am afraid to do so.\"  \"Direct me, and I will find the way alone,\" replied Herman.  She gave him minute instructions and a key with which to open the street door. The young man pressed the cold, inert hand, then went out.  The death of the Countess had surprised no one, as it had long been expected. Her funeral was attended by every one of note in the vicinity. Herman mingled with the throng without attracting any especial attention. After all the friends had taken their last look at the dead face, the young man approached the bier. He prostrated himself on the cold floor, and remained motionless for a long time. He rose at last with a face almost as pale as that of the corpse itself, and went up the steps to look into the casket. As he looked down it seemed to him that the rigid face returned his glance mockingly, closing one eye. He turned abruptly away, made a false step, and fell to the floor. He was picked up, and, at the same moment, Lisaveta was carried out in a faint.  Herman did not recover his usual composure during the entire day. He dined alone at an out-of-the-way restaurant, and drank a great deal, in the hope of stifling his emotion. The wine only served to stimulate his imagination. He returned home and threw himself down on his bed without undressing.  During the night he awoke with a start; the moon shone into his chamber, making everything plainly visible. Some one looked in at the window, then quickly disappeared. He paid no attention to this, but soon he heard the vestibule door open. He thought it was his orderly, returning late, drunk as usual. The step was an unfamiliar one, and he heard the shuffling sound of loose slippers.  The door of his room opened, and a woman in white entered. She came close to the bed, and the terrified man recognized the Countess.  \"I have come to you against my will,\" she said abruptly; \"but I was commanded to grant your request. The tray, seven, and ace in succession are the magic cards. Twenty-four hours must elapse between the use of each card, and after the three have been used you must never play again.\"  The fantom then turned and walked away. Herman heard the outside door close, and again saw the form pass the window.  He rose and went out into the hall, where his orderly lay asleep on the floor. The door was closed. Finding no trace of a visitor, he returned to his room, lit his candle, and wrote down what he had just heard.  Two fixed ideas cannot exist in the brain at the same time any more than two bodies can occupy the same point in space. The tray, seven, and ace soon chased away the thoughts of the dead woman, and all other thoughts from the brain of the young officer. All his ideas merged into a single one: how to turn to advantage the secret paid for so dearly. He even thought of resigning his commission and going to Paris to force a fortune from conquered fate. Chance rescued him from his embarrassment.  *****  Tchekalinsky, a man who had passed his whole life at cards, opened a club at St. Petersburg. His long experience secured for him the confidence of his companions, and his hospitality and genial humor conciliated society.  The gilded youth flocked around him, neglecting society, preferring the charms of faro to those of their sweethearts. Naroumov invited Herman to accompany him to the club, and the young man accepted the invitation only too willingly.  The two officers found the apartments full. Generals and statesmen played whist; young men lounged on sofas, eating ices or smoking. In the principal salon stood a long table, at which about twenty men sat playing faro, the host of the establishment being the banker.  He was a man of about sixty, gray-haired and respectable. His ruddy face shone with genial humor; his eyes sparkled and a constant smile hovered around his lips.  Naroumov presented Herman. The host gave him a cordial handshake, begged him not to stand upon ceremony, and returned, to his dealing. More than thirty cards were already on the table. Tchekalinsky paused after each coup, to allow the punters time to recognize their gains or losses, politely answering all questions and constantly smiling.  After the deal was over, the cards were shuffled and the game began again.  \"Permit me to choose a card,\" said Herman, stretching out his hand over the head of a portly gentleman, to reach a livret. The banker bowed without replying.  Herman chose a card, and wrote the amount of his stake upon it with a piece of chalk.  \"How much is that?\" asked the banker; \"excuse me, sir, but I do not see well.\"  \"Forty thousand rubles,\" said Herman coolly.  All eyes were instantly turned upon the speaker.  \"He has lost his wits,\" thought Naroumov.  \"Allow me to observe,\" said Tchekalinsky, with his eternal smile, \"that your stake is excessive.\"  \"What of it?\" replied Herman, nettled. \"Do you accept it or not?\"  The banker nodded in assent. \"I have only to remind you that the cash will be necessary; of course your word is good, but in order to keep the confidence of my patrons, I prefer the ready money.\"  Herman took a bank-check from his pocket and handed it to his host. The latter examined it attentively, then laid it on the card chosen.  He began dealing: to the right, a nine; to the left, a tray.  \"The tray wins,\" said Herman, showing the card he held--a tray.  A murmur ran through the crowd. Tchekalinsky frowned for a second only, then his smile returned. He took a roll of bank-bills from his pocket and counted out the required sum. Herman received it and at once left the table.  The next evening saw him at the place again. Every one eyed him curiously, and Tchekalinsky greeted him cordially.  He selected his card and placed upon it his fresh stake. The banker began dealing: to the right, a nine; to the left, a seven.  Herman then showed his card--a seven spot. The onlookers exclaimed, and the host was visibly disturbed. He counted out ninety-four-thousand rubles and passed them to Herman, who accepted them without showing the least surprise, and at once withdrew.  The following evening he went again. His appearance was the signal for the cessation of all occupation, every one being eager to watch the developments of events. He selected his card--an ace.  The dealing began: to the right, a queen; to the left, an ace.  \"The ace wins,\" remarked Herman, turning up his card without glancing at it.  \"Your queen is killed,\" remarked Tchekalinsky quietly.  Herman trembled; looking down, he saw, not the ace he had selected, but the queen of spades. He could scarcely believe his eyes. It seemed impossible that he could have made such a mistake. As he stared at the card it seemed to him that the queen winked one eye at him mockingly.  \"The old woman!\" he exclaimed involuntarily.  The croupier raked in the money while he looked on in stupid terror. When he left the table, all made way for him to pass; the cards were shuffled, and the gambling went on.  Herman became a lunatic. He was confined at the hospital at Oboukov, where he spoke to no one, but kept constantly murmuring in a monotonous tone: \"The tray, seven, ace! The tray, seven, queen!\""]]]
