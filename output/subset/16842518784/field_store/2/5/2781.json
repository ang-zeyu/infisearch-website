They were all obliged to take their seats as the conductor called off the names from his way bill. The two ladies entered the coupé in company with the Russian, while Mr. Howland ascended by the step ladder to his seat on the banquette. While the passengers were thus getting seated the postilions were putting in the horses, and in a moment more the diligence set off.  Now, here were four persons setting out on a pleasant morning, in a good carriage, to take the drive from Naples to Rome--one of the most charming drives that the whole tour of Europe affords, and yet not one of them was in a condition to enjoy it. Every one was dissatisfied, out of humor, and unhappy. The Russian gentleman was displeased with Mr. Howland for asking him to give up his seat, and he felt uncomfortable and ill at ease in being shut up with two ladies, who he knew were displeased with him for not giving it up. The bride was vexed with the Russian for insisting on his place in the coupé, and with her sister for not being willing to go into the interior, so that she might ride with her husband. Miss Louise was offended at having been asked to sit in the interior, which request, she said to herself, was only part of a systematic plan, which her sister seemed to have adopted for the whole journey, to make herself the principal personage in every thing, and to treat her, Louise, as if she was of no consequence whatever. And last of all, Mr. Howland, on the banquette above, was out of humor with himself for having asked the Russian to give up his seat, and thus subjected himself to the mortification of a refusal, and with his wife for having required him to ask it.  Thus they were all at heart uncomfortable and unhappy, and as the horses trotted swiftly on along the smooth and beautiful road which traverses the rich campagna of Naples, on the way to Capua, the splendid scenery was wholly disregarded by every one of them.  Now, it is very often so with parties travelling in Europe. The external circumstances are all perhaps extremely favorable, and they are passing through scenes or visiting places which they have thought of and dreamed of at home with beating hearts for many years. And yet now that the time has come, and the enjoyment is before them, there is some internal source of disquiet, some mental vexation or annoyance, some secret resentment or heart-burning, arising out of the circumstances in which they are placed, or the relations which they sustain to one another, which destroys their peace and quiet of mind, and of course incapacitates them for any real happiness. So that, on the whole, judging from what I have seen of tourists in Europe, I should say that those that travel do not after all, in general, really pass their time more happily than those who remain at home.  I have two reasons for saying these things. One is, that those of you who have no opportunity to travel, may be more contented to remain at home, and not imagine that those of your friends who go abroad, necessarily pass their time so much more happily than you do. The other reason is, that when you do travel, either in our own country or in foreign lands, you should be more reasonable and considerate, and pay more regard to the wishes and feelings of others, than travellers usually do. Most of the disquietudes and heart-burnings which arise to mar the happiness of parties travelling, come from the selfishness of our hearts, which seems, in some way or other, to bring itself out more into view when we are on a long journey together than at any other time. In the ordinary intercourse of life, this selfishness is covered and concealed by the veil of politeness prescribed by the forms and usages of society. This veil is, however, very thin, and it soon disappears entirely, in the familiar intercourse which is necessarily produced by the incidents and adventures of a journey. In being daily and hourly with each other for a long time, people appear just as they really are; and unless they are really reasonable, considerate, and just towards one another, they are sure sooner or later to disagree.  But though the bridal party were very much out of humor with each other, as we have seen, Mr. George and Rollo were entirely free from any such uneasiness. They both felt very light-hearted and happy. They rambled about the court yard till they had seen all that there was there to interest them, and then they went to their own diligence. They opened the coupé door and looked in.  \"Our seats are Nos. 1 and 2,\" said Rollo.  \"Yes,\" said Mr. George. \"One of them is next the window, and the other is in the middle. You may get in first, and take the seat by the window.\"  \"No, uncle George,\" said Rollo, \"you had better have the seat by the window.\"  \"We will take turns for that seat,\" said Mr. George, \"and you shall begin.\"  Mr. George arranged it to have Rollo take his turn first, because he knew very well that, in the beginning of a journey, such a boy as Rollo was always full of enthusiasm and excitement; and that, consequently, he would enjoy riding at the window much more at first than at a later period. So Rollo got in and took his seat, and Mr. George followed him. In a very few minutes afterwards, the postilions came out with the horses.  But I have something particular to say about the postilions and the horses, and I will say it in the next chapter.     CHAPTER II.  THE JOURNEY.   There are a great many curious things to be observed in travelling by the public conveyances on the continent of Europe. One is the way of driving the horses. It is a very common thing to have them driven, not by coachmen, but by postilions. There is a postilion for each pair of horses, and he sits upon the nigh horse of the pair. Thus he rides and drives at the same time.  In these cases there is no driver's seat in front of the coach. Or if there is a seat in front, it is occupied by the passengers. All the driving is done by the postilions.  The postilions dress in a sort of livery, which is quite gay in its appearance, being trimmed with red. The collars and the lapels of their jackets, too, are ornamented here and there with figures of stage horns and other emblems of their profession. They also wear enormously long and stout boots. These boots come up above their knees. They carry only a short whip, for they only have to whip the horse that they are upon, and the one which is by the side of him, and so they do not have to reach very far. When there are four horses, there are two postilions, and when there are six, three.  A large diligence, with six horses, and a gayly dressed postilion mounted on one of the horses of each pair, makes a very grand appearance, you may depend, in coming, upon the gallop, into the streets of a town--the postilions cracking their whips, and making as much noise as they can, and all the boys and girls of the street coming to the doors and windows to see.  \"I am glad we are going to have postilions, uncle George,\" said Rollo, as they were getting into the coach.  \"Why?\" asked Mr. George.  \"Because I like the looks of them,\" said Rollo; \"and then we always go faster, too, when we have postilions. Besides, when there is a seat for a driver on the coach, it blocks up our front windows; but now our windows are all clear.\"  \"Those are excellent reasons--all of them,\" said Mr. George.  The postilions did indeed drive very fast, when they once got upon the road. There was a delay of half an hour, at the gate of the city, for the examination of the passports; during which time the postilions, having dismounted from their horses, stood talking together, and playing off jokes upon each other. At length, when the passports were ready, they sprang into their saddles, and set the horses off upon the run.  The road, on leaving the gates, entered a wide and beautiful avenue, which was at this time filled with peasants coming into town, for that day was market day in Naples. The people coming in were dressed in the most curious costumes. Multitudes were on foot, others rode crowded together in donkey carts. Some rode on the backs of donkeys, with a load of farming produce before or behind them. The women, in such cases, sat square upon the donkey's back, with both their feet hanging down on one side; and they banged the donkey with their heels to make him get out of the way so that the diligence could go by.  The country was very rich and beautiful, and it was cultivated every where like a garden. Here and there were groves of mulberries,--the tree on which the silk worm feeds,--and there were vineyards, with the vines just bursting into leaf, and now and then a little garden of orange trees. In the mean time the postilions kept cracking their whips, and the horses galloped on at such a speed that Rollo had scarcely time to see the objects by the road side, they glided so swiftly by.  \"Won't the silk worms eat any kind of leaves but mulberry leaves?\" he asked.  \"No,\" said Mr. George, \"at least the mulberry silk worms will not. There are a great many different kinds of silk worms in the world; that is, there are a great many different kinds of caterpillars that spin a thread and make a ball to wrap up their eggs in, and each one lives on a different plant or tree. If you watch the caterpillars in a garden, you will see that each kind lives on some particular leaf, and will not touch any other.\"  \"Yes,\" said Rollo, \"we found a big caterpillar once on the caraway in our garden, and we shut him up in a box, in order to see what sort of a butterfly he would turn into, and we gave him different kinds of leaves to eat, but he would not eat any but caraway leaves.\"  \"And what became of him at last?\" asked Mr. George.  \"O, he turned into a butterfly,\" said Rollo. \"First he turned into a chrysalis, and then he turned into a butterfly.\"  \"There are a great many different kinds of silk worms,\" said"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23433"],["title","The Kitten's Garden of Verses (#1)"],["body"," (To catch one's tail, 'twixt me and you,         Is not an easy thing to do.)

The Mouse delights to nibble cheese,         The Dog bites anything he sees--     But how could they bite off the Moon         Unless they went in a balloon?      And Human People, when they eat         They think it rude to bite their meat,     They use a Knife or Fork or Spoon;         Who is it then that bites the moon?     [Illustration]  The Golden Cat       Great is the Golden Cat who treads          The Blue Roof Garden o'er our heads,     The never tired smiling One          That Human People call the Sun.      He stretches forth his paw at dawn          And though the blinds are closely drawn     His claws peep through like Rays of Light,          To catch the fluttering Bird of Night.      He smiles into the Hayloft dim          And the brown Hay smiles back at him,     And when he strokes the Earth's green fur          He makes the Fields and Meadows purr.      His face is one big Golden smile,          It measures round, at least a mile--     How dull our World would be, and flat,          Without the Golden Pussy Cat.     [Illustration]  An Inquiry       A Birdie cocked his little head,         Winked his eye at me and said,     \"Say, are you a Pussy Willer,         Or just a Kitty-Catty pillar?\"     [Illustration]  A Kitten's Fancy       The Kitten mews outside the Door,          The Cat-bird in the Tree,     The Sea-mew mews upon the Shore,          The Catfish in the Sea.

Then I, the Dangerous Kitten, prowl         And in the Shadows softly growl,     And roam about the farthest floor         Where Kitten never trod before.      And, crouching in the jungle damp,         I watch the Human Hunter's camp,     Ready to spring with fearful roar         As soon as I shall hear them snore.      And then with stealthy tread I crawl          Into the dark and trackless hall,     Where 'neath the Hat-tree's shadows deep          Umbrellas fold their wings and sleep.      A cuckoo calls--and to their dens          The People climb like frightened hens,     And I'm alone--and no one cares          In Darkest Africa--down stairs.     [Illustration]     [Illustration]  The Dog       The Dog is black or white or brown         And sometimes spotted like a clown.     He loves to make a foolish noise         And Human Company enjoys.      The Human People pat his head         And teach him to pretend he's dead,     And beg, and fetch and carry too;         Things that no well-bred Cat will do.      At Human jokes, however stale,         He jumps about and wags his tail,     And Human People clap their hands         And think he really understands.      They say \"Good Dog\" to him. To us         They say \"Poor Puss,\" and make no fuss.     Why Dogs are \"good\" and Cats are \"poor\"         I fail to understand, I'm sure.      To Someone very Good and Just,         Who has proved worthy of her trust,     A Cat will _sometimes_ condescend--         The Dog is Everybody's friend.

First it goes this way, then it goes that,         Just like a bird on the wing.     And all of a tremble I crouch on the mat         Like a Lion, preparing to spring.      And now with a terrible deafening mew,         Like a Tiger I leap on my prey,     And just when I think I have torn it in two         It is up in the air and away."]]]
