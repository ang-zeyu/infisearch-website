We'll see him pretty soon.\"  She remembered what the Gern commander had said about the Rejects being permitted to take their personal possessions. She had very little time in which to get together what she could carry....  There were two small bags in the compartment and she hurried to pack them with things she and Dale and Billy might need, not able to know which of them, if any, would be Rejects. Nor could she know whether she should put in clothes for a cold world or a hot one. The Gern commander had said the Rejects would be left on an Earth-type planet but where could it be? The Dunbar Expedition had explored across five hundred light-years of space and had found only one Earth-type world: Athena.  The Gerns were almost to her door when she had finished and she heard them enter the compartments across from her own. There came the hard, curt questions and the command: \"Outside--hurry!\" A woman said something in pleading question and there was the soft thud of a blow and the words: \"Outside--do not ask questions!\" A moment later she heard the woman going down the corridor, trying to hold back her crying.  Then the Gerns were at her own door.  She held Billy's hand and waited for them with her heart hammering. She held her head high and composed herself with all the determination she could muster so that the arrogant Gerns would not see that she was afraid. Billy stood beside her as tall as his five years would permit, his teddy bear under his arm, and only the way his hand held to hers showed that he, too, was scared.  The door was flung open and two Gerns strode in.  The were big, dark men, with powerful, bulging muscles. They surveyed her and the room with a quick sweep of eyes that were like glittering obsidian, their mouths thin, cruel slashes in the flat, brutal planes of their faces.  \"Your name?\" snapped the one who carried a sheaf of occupation records.  \"It's\"--she tried to swallow the quaver in her voice and make it cool and unfrightened--\"Irene Lois Humbolt--Mrs. Dale Humbolt.\"  The Gern glanced at the papers. \"Where is your husband?\"  \"He was in the X-ray room at--\"  \"You are a Reject. Out--down the corridor with the others.\"  \"My husband--will he be a--\"  _\"Outside!\"_  It was the tone of voice that had preceded the blow in the other compartment and the Gern took a quick step toward her. She seized the two bags in one hand, not wanting to release Billy, and swung back to hurry out into the corridor. The other Gern jerked one of the bags from her hand and flung it to the floor. \"Only one bag per person,\" he said, and gave her an impatient shove that sent her and Billy stumbling through the doorway.  She became part of the Rejects who were being herded like sheep down the corridors and into the port airlock. There were many children among them, the young ones frightened and crying, and often with only one parent or an older brother or sister to take care of them. And there were many young ones who had no one at all and were dependent upon strangers to take their hands and tell them what they must do.  When she was passing the corridor that led to the X-ray room she saw a group of Rejects being herded up it. Dale was not among them and she knew, then, that she and Billy would never see him again.         *       *       *       *       *  _\"Out from the ship--faster--faster----\"_  The commands of the Gern guards snapped like whips around them as she and the other Rejects crowded and stumbled down the boarding ramp and out onto the rocky ground. There was the pull of a terrible gravity such as she had never experienced and they were in a bleak, barren valley, a cold wind moaning down it and whipping the alkali dust in bitter clouds. Around the valley stood ragged hills, their white tops laying out streamers of wind-driven snow, and the sky was dark with sunset.  _\"Out from the ship--faster----\"_  It was hard to walk fast in the high gravity, carrying the bag in one hand and holding up all of Billy's weight she could with the other.  \"They lied to us!\" a man beside her said to someone. \"Let's turn and fight. Let's take----\"  A Gern blaster cracked with a vivid blue flash and the man plunged lifelessly to the ground. She flinched instinctively and fell over an unseen rock, the bag of precious clothes flying from her hand. She scrambled up again, her left knee half numb, and turned to retrieve it.  The Gern guard was already upon her, his blaster still in his hand. \"Out from the ship--faster.\"  The barrel of his blaster lashed across the side of her head. \"Move on--move on!\"  She staggered in a blinding blaze of pain and then hurried on, holding tight to Billy's hand, the wind cutting like knives of ice through her thin clothes and blood running in a trickle down her cheek.  \"He hit you,\" Billy said. \"He hurt you.\" Then he called the Gern a name that five-year-old boys were not supposed to know, with a savagery that five-year-old boys were not supposed to possess.  When she stopped at the outer fringe of Rejects she saw that all of them were out of the cruiser and the guards were going back into it. A half mile down the valley the other cruiser stood, the Rejects out from it and its boarding ramps already withdrawn.  When she had buttoned Billy's blouse tighter and wiped the blood from her face the first blast of the drives came from the farther cruiser. The nearer one blasted a moment later and they lifted together, their roaring filling the valley. They climbed faster and faster, dwindling as they went. Then they disappeared in the black sky, their roaring faded away, and there was left only the moaning of the wind around her and somewhere a child crying.  And somewhere a voice asking, \"Where are we? In the name of God--what have they done to us?\"  She looked at the snow streaming from the ragged hills, felt the hard pull of the gravity, and knew where they were. They were on Ragnarok, the hell-world of 1.5 gravity and fierce beasts and raging fevers where men could not survive. The name came from an old Teutonic myth and meant: _The last day for gods and men_. The Dunbar Expedition had discovered Ragnarok and her father had told her of it, of how it had killed six of the eight men who had left the ship and would have killed all of them if they had remained any longer.  She knew where they were and she knew the Gerns had lied to them and would never send a ship to take them to Earth. Their abandonment there had been intended as a death sentence for all of them.  And Dale was gone and she and Billy would die helpless and alone....  \"It will be dark--so soon.\" Billy's voice shook with the cold. \"If Daddy can't find us in the dark, what will we do?\"  \"I don't know,\" she said. \"There's no one to help us and how can I know--what we should do----\"  She was from the city. How could she know what to do on an alien, hostile world where armed explorers had died? She had tried to be brave before the Gerns but now--now night was at hand and out of it would come terror and death for herself and Billy. They would never see Dale again, never see Athena or Earth or even the dawn on the world that had killed them....  She tried not to cry, and failed. Billy's cold little hand touched her own, trying to reassure her.  \"Don't cry, Mama. I guess--I guess everybody else is scared, too.\"  _Everyone else...._  She was not alone. How could she have thought she was alone? All around her were others, as helpless and uncertain as she. Her story was only one out of four thousand.  \"I guess they are, Billy,\" she said. \"I never thought of that, before.\"  She knelt to put her arms around him, thinking: _Tears and fear are futile weapons; they can never bring us any tomorrows. We'll have to fight whatever comes to kill us no matter how scared we are. For ourselves and for our children. Above all else, for our children...._  \"I'm going back to find our clothes,\" she said. \"You wait here for me, in the shelter of that rock, and I won't be gone long.\"  Then she told him what he would be too young to really understand.  \"I'm not going to cry any more and I know, now, what I must do. I'm going to make sure that there is a tomorrow for you, always, to the last breath of my life.\"         *       *       *       *       *  The bright blue star dimmed and the others faded away. Dawn touched the sky, bringing with it a coldness that frosted the steel of the rifle in John Prentiss's hands and formed beads of ice on his gray mustache. There was a stirring in the area behind him as the weary Rejects prepared to face the new day and the sound of a child whimpering from the cold. There had been no time the evening before to gather wood for fires----  _\"Prowlers!\"_  The warning cry came from an outer guard and black shadows were suddenly sweeping out of the dark dawn.  They were things that might have been half wolf, half tiger; each of them three hundred pounds of incredible ferocity with eyes blazing like yellow fire in their white-fanged tiger-wolf faces. They came like the wind, in a flowing black wave, and ripped through the outer guard line as though it had not existed. The inner guards fired in a chattering roll of gunshots, trying to turn them, and Prentiss's rifle licked out pale tongues of flame as he added his own fire. The prowlers came on, breaking through, but part of them went down and the others were swerved by the fire so that they struck only the outer edge of the area where the Rejects were grouped.  At that distance they blended into the dark ground so that he could not find them in the sights of his rifle. He could only watch helplessly and see a dark-haired woman caught in their path, trying to run with a child in her arms and already knowing it was too late. A man was running toward her, slow in the high gravity, an axe in his hands and his cursing a raging, savage snarl. For a moment her white face was turned"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22549"],["title","Space Prison (#2)"],["body"," helpless appeal to him and the others; then the prowlers were upon her and she fell, deliberately, going to the ground with her child hugged in her arms beneath her so that her body would protect it.  The prowlers passed over her, pausing for an instant to slash the life from her, and raced on again. They vanished back into the outer darkness, the farther guards firing futilely, and there was a silence but for the distant, hysterical sobbing of a woman.  It had happened within seconds; the fifth prowler attack that night and the mildest.         *       *       *       *       *  Full dawn had come by the time he replaced the guards killed by the last attack and made the rounds of the other guard lines. He came back by the place where the prowlers had killed the woman, walking wearily against the pull of gravity. She lay with her dark hair tumbled and stained with blood, her white face turned up to the reddening sky, and he saw her clearly for the first time.  It was Irene.  He stopped, gripping the cold steel of the rifle and not feeling the rear sight as it cut into his hand.  Irene.... He had not known she was on Ragnarok. He had not seen her in the darkness of the night and he had hoped she and Billy were safe among the Acceptables with Dale.  There was the sound of footsteps and a bold-faced girl in a red skirt stopped beside him, her glance going over him curiously.  \"The little boy,\" he asked, \"do you know if he's all right?\"  \"The prowlers cut up his face but he'll be all right,\" she said. \"I came back after his clothes.\"  \"Are you going to look after him?\"  \"Someone has to and\"--she shrugged her shoulders--\"I guess I was soft enough to elect myself for the job. Why--was his mother a friend of yours?\"  \"She was my daughter,\" he said.  \"Oh.\" For a moment the bold, brassy look was gone from her face, like a mask that had slipped. \"I'm sorry. And I'll take care of Billy.\"         *       *       *       *       *  The first objection to his assumption of leadership occurred an hour later. The prowlers had withdrawn with the coming of full daylight and wood had been carried from the trees to build fires. Mary, one of the volunteer cooks, was asking two men to carry her some water when he approached. The smaller man picked up one of the clumsy containers, hastily improvised from canvas, and started toward the creek. The other, a big, thick-chested man, did not move.  \"We'll have to have water,\" Mary said. \"People are hungry and cold and sick.\"  The man continued to squat by the fire, his hands extended to its warmth. \"Name someone else,\" he said.  \"But----\"  She looked at Prentiss in uncertainty. He went to the thick-chested man, knowing there would be violence and welcoming it as something to help drive away the vision of Irene's pale, cold face under the red sky.  \"She asked you to get her some water,\" he said. \"Get it.\"  The man looked up at him, studying him with deliberate insolence, then he got to his feet, his heavy shoulders hunched challengingly.  \"I'll have to set you straight, old timer,\" he said. \"No one has appointed you the head cheese around here. Now, there's the container you want filled and over there\"--he made a small motion with one hand--\"is the creek. Do you know what to do?\"  \"Yes,\" he said. \"I know what to do.\"  He brought the butt of the rifle smashing up. It struck the man under the chin and there was a sharp cracking sound as his jawbone snapped. For a fraction of a second there was an expression of stupefied amazement on his face then his eyes glazed and he slumped to the ground with his broken jaw setting askew.  \"All right,\" he said to Mary. \"Now you go ahead and name somebody else.\"         *       *       *       *       *  He found that the prowlers had killed seventy during the night. One hundred more had died from the Hell Fever that often followed exposure and killed within an hour.  He went the half mile to the group that had arrived on the second cruiser as soon as he had eaten a delayed breakfast. He saw, before he had quite reached the other group, that the _Constellation_'s Lieutenant Commander, Vincent Lake, was in charge of it.  Lake, a tall, hard-jawed man with pale blue eyes under pale brows, walked forth to meet him as soon as he recognized him.  \"Glad to see you're still alive,\" Lake greeted him. \"I thought that second Gern blast got you along with the others.\"  \"I was visiting midship and wasn't home when it happened,\" he said.  He looked at Lake's group of Rejects, in their misery and uncertainty so much like his own, and asked, \"How was it last night?\"  \"Bad--damned bad,\" Lake said. \"Prowlers and Hell Fever, and no wood for fires. Two hundred died last night.\"  \"I came down to see if anyone was in charge here and to tell them that we'll have to move into the woods at once--today. We'll have plenty of wood for the fires there, some protection from the wind, and by combining our defenses we can stand off the prowlers better.\"  Lake agreed. When the brief discussion of plans was finished he asked, \"How much do you know about Ragnarok?\"  \"Not much,\" Prentiss answered. \"We didn't stay to study it very long. There are no heavy metals on Ragnarok's other sun. Its position in the advance of the resources of any value. We gave Ragnarok a quick survey and when the sixth man died we marked it on the chart as uninhabitable and went on our way.  \"As you probably know, that bright blue star is Ragnarok's other sun. It's position in the advance of the yellow sun shows the season to be early spring. When summer comes Ragnarok will swing between the two suns and the heat will be something no human has ever endured. Nor the cold, when winter comes.  \"I know of no edible plants, although there might be some. There are a few species of rodent-like animals--they're scavengers--and a herbivore we called the woods goat. The prowlers are the dominant form of life on Ragnarok and I suspect their intelligence is a good deal higher than we would like it to be. There will be a constant battle for survival with them.  \"There's another animal, not as intelligent as the prowlers but just as dangerous--the unicorn. The unicorns are big and fast and they travel in herds. I haven't seen any here so far--I hope we don't. At the lower elevations are the swamp crawlers. They're unadulterated nightmares. I hope they don't go to these higher elevations in the summer. The prowlers and the Hell Fever, the gravity and heat and cold and starvation, will be enough for us to have to fight.\"  \"I see,\" Lake said. He smiled, a smile that was as bleak as moonlight on an arctic glacier. \"Earth-type--remember the promise the Gerns made the Rejects?\" He looked out across the camp, at the snow whipping from the frosty hills, at the dead and the dying, and a little girl trying vainly to awaken her brother.  \"They were condemned, without reason, without a chance to live,\" he said. \"So many of them are so young ... and when you're young it's too soon to have to die.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Prentiss returned to his own group. The dead were buried in shallow graves and inventory was taken of the promised \"ample supplies.\" These were only the few personal possessions the Rejects had been permitted to take plus a small amount of food the Gerns had taken from the _Constellation_'s stores. The Gerns had been forced to provide the Rejects with at least a little food--had they openly left them to starve, the Acceptables, whose families were among the Rejects, might have rebelled.  Inventory of the firearms and ammunition showed the total to be discouragingly small. They would have to learn how to make and use bows and arrows as soon as possible.  With the first party of guards and workmen following him, Prentiss went to the tributary valley that emptied into the central valley a mile to the north. It was as good a camp site as could be hoped for; wide and thickly spotted with groves of trees, a creek running down its center.  The workmen began the construction of shelters and he climbed up the side of the nearer hill. He reached its top, his breath coming fast in the gravity that was the equivalent of a burden half his own weight, and saw what the surrounding terrain was like.  To the south, beyond the barren valley, the land could be seen dropping in its long sweep to the southern lowlands where the unicorns and swamp crawlers lived. To the north the hills climbed gently for miles, then ended under the steeply sloping face of an immense plateau. The plateau reached from western to eastern horizon, still white with the snows of winter and looming so high above the world below that the clouds brushed it and half obscured it.  He went back down the hill as Lake's men appeared. They started work on what would be a continuation of his own camp and he told Lake what he had seen from the hill.  \"We're between the lowlands and the highlands,\" he said. \"This will be as near to a temperate altitude as Ragnarok has. We survive here--or else. There's no other place for us to go.\"  An overcast darkened the sky at noon and the wind died down to almost nothing. There was a feeling of waiting tension in the air and he went back to the Rejects, to speed their move into the woods. They were already going in scattered groups, accompanied by prowler guards, but there was no organization and it would be too long before the last of them were safely in the new camp.  He could not be two places at once--he needed a subleader to oversee the move of the Rejects and their possessions into the woods and their placement after they got there.  He found the man he wanted already helping the Rejects get started: a thin, quiet man named Henry Anders who had fought well against the prowlers the night before, even though his determination had been greater than his marksmanship. He was the type people instinctively liked and trusted; a good choice for the subleader whose job it would be to handle the multitude of details in camp"]]]
