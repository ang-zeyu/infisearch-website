Currents are all wrong, too. No one could cross without navigational equipment.\"  \"I know,\" Lanko assured him. \"We haven't checked over that way for a long time, but I still remember. I didn't put it exactly that way, of course, but I did ask Musa how he planned to get over the Eastern. And, I got an answer.\" He paused as he gathered up the garments he had discarded.  \"It seems there's a new priesthood at Norlar, who've got something,\" he continued. \"It's all wrapped up in religious symbology, and they don't let any details get out, but they are guiding ships out to sea, and they're bringing them back again, loaded with goods that never originated in the Galankar, or in any place accessible to the Galankar.\" He hung up the last article of clothing and turned, a sheathed sword in his hand.  \"Musa sold me this,\" he said, extending the hilt toward Banasel. \"I never saw anything like it on this planet. Did you?\"         *       *       *       *       *  Banasel accepted the weapon, drawing it from its scabbard. He examined the handwork on the hilt, then snapped a fingernail against the blade. As he listened to the musical _ping_, the technician looked at the weapon with more interest. Gently, he flexed it, watching for signs of strain. Lanko grinned at him.  \"Go ahead,\" he invited, \"get rough with it. That's a sword you're holding, Chum, not one of those bronze skull busters.\"  Banasel extended the sword, whipping it violently. The blade bent, then straightened, and bent again, as it slashed through the air.  \"Well,\" he murmured. \"Something new.\"  He put the sword on the workbench and took an instrument from a cabinet. For a few minutes, he busied himself taking readings and tapping out data on his computer. He sat back, looking at the sword curiously. At last, he glanced at the computer, then put the test instrument he had been using back in the cabinet, taking another to replace it. After taking more readings, he looked at the computer, then shook his head, turning to Lanko.  \"This,\" he said slowly, \"is excellent steel. Of course, it could be an accidental alloy, but I wouldn't think anyone on this planet could have developed the technology to get it just so.\" He held the sword away from him, looking at it closely. \"Assuming an accidental alloy, an accident in getting precisely the right degree of heat before quenching, and someone who ground and polished with such care as to leave the temper undisturbed, while getting this finish--Oh, it's possible, all right. But 'tain't likely. Musa told you this came from overseas?\"  \"To the best of his knowledge. He got it from a trader who claimed to have been on a voyage across the Eastern Sea.\"  Banasel leaned back, clasping his hands behind his head. \"You must have had quite a talk with Musa. Did he remember you?\"  Lanko shook his head. \"Don't be foolish,\" he grunted. \"You and I were blotted out of his memory, remember? So are quite a few of the things that happened around Atakar, way back when. He's got a complete past, of course, but we're not part of it.  \"No, he had a booth in the Karth market. I came through, just looking things over, and recognized him. So, I picked an acquaintance. Beat him down to about half the asking price for this sword, still leaving him a whopping profit. He went to dinner with me, still bewailing the rooking I'd given him. Told you, he's a trader. We had quite a talk, certainly. But we were strangers.\"  \"Yeah.\" Banasel looked off into space. \"Seems funny. You and I were born on this planet. We were brought up here, and a lot of people once knew us. But they've all forgotten, and we don't belong any more. I'm beginning to see what they mean by 'the lonely life of a guardsman.'\"  He was silent for a time, then looked at his companion.  \"Do you think these priests at Norlar might be in our line of business?\"  \"Could be,\" nodded Lanko. \"There's a lot of seafaring out of Konassa, and there are several other busy seaports we know of. But no one in any of them ever heard of navigation out of sight of land, let alone trying it. There's nothing but pilotage, and even that's pretty sketchy. And, there's this thing.\" He crossed to the workbench, picked up the sword, and stroked its blade.  \"Normally,\" he mused, \"technical knowledge gets around. Part of it's developed here, part there. Then someone comes along and puts it together. And someone else adds to it. And so on.  \"Then, there are other times, when there's an abnormal source, or where there are unusual conditions, and knowledge is very closely guarded. This might be one of those cases, and those priests might be fronting for someone very much in our line of business.\" He broke off.  \"Any maedli hot?\"  \"Sure.\" Banasel picked a pot from the heater and poured two cups.  \"Think we should set up a base near Norlar and have a look?\"  \"Probably be a good idea.\" Lanko accepted a cup, took a sip, and shook his head violently.  \"Ouch! I said hot, not boiling.\" He blew on the cup and set it aside to steam itself cool.  \"These mountains were an excellent base,\" he continued, \"but this area seems to be developing perfectly. There's no outside interference, all traces of former interference have been eliminated, and there's very little excuse for us to hang around.\" He picked up the cup again, cautiously sampling its contents. \"And it's about time we moved around and checked on the rest of the planet.\"  Banasel turned back to the workbench. \"Good idea,\" he agreed. \"I'll get this scanner set up again, and we'll be ready to load out.\" He picked up his tools. \"As I remember, Norlar has a mountainous backbone where no one ever goes. We should be able to set up right on the island.\"         *       *       *       *       *  On the eastern slope of the Midra Kran, a cloud of dust paced a caravan, which wound up the trail, through a pass. The treachery of the narrow path was testified to by an occasional slither, followed by a startled curse.  Musa stood in his stirrups, looking ahead at the long trail which twisted a little farther up, then dropped to the wide Jogurthan plateau. Far ahead, over the poorly marked way, he knew, was another range, the Soruna Kran, which blocked his way to the Eastern Sea.  He looked back at the straggling caravan.  \"Better get them to close up, Baro,\" he remarked. \"We'd be in a lot of trouble if a robber band caught us scattered like this.\"  The other trader nodded and turned his mount. Then, he paused as shouts came from the rear of the line. Mixed with the shouting was the clatter of weapons.  \"Come on,\" cried Musa. \"It's happened.\"  He kicked his mount in the ribs, and swung about, starting up the steep bank. The bandits would have bowmen posted to deal with anyone who might try to get back along the narrow path, and he had no desire to test the accuracy of their aim.  As his beast scrambled up the bank, Musa saw a man standing on a pinnacle, alertly watching the center of the caravan. His guess had been right. The bandit leader's strategy had been to cut the caravan in two, and to deal with the rear guard first. As the watcher started to aim at something down on the trail, Musa quickly raised his own bow and sent an arrow to cut the man down before he could fire.  It was a good shot. The man made no sound as the arrow struck, but clawed for an instant at the shaft in his side, then dropped, to slide down the face of a low cliff. Musa, followed by his guards, stormed up the slope.  They went through a saddle in the hill, to find themselves confronted by a half dozen men, who swung about, trying to bring their bows to bear on the unexpected targets. Two of these went down as arrows sang through the air, then the traders were upon the rest, swords flailing, too close for archery.  One of the bandits swung his sword wildly at Musa, who had drawn a twin to that blade he had sold back in Karth. The slender shaft of steel rang against the bandit's bronze blade, deflecting it, then Musa made a quick thrust which passed through the man's leather shield, to penetrate flesh. The bronze weapon sagged, and its holder staggered. Musa jerked back violently, disengaged his sword, and made a swift cut. For an instant, the bandit sat his mount, staring at his opponent. Then, he slumped, and rolled loosely from his saddle.  The action had been fast. Only one bandit, a skilled swordsman, remained, to keep Baro busy. Musa rode quickly behind him, thrusting as he passed. Baro looked across the limp body.  \"Now, what did you have to do that for?\" he demanded. \"I was having a good time.\"  \"Let's get down to the trail again,\" Musa told him. \"We can have a wonderful time there.\" He pointed.  The caravan's rear guard was in trouble. Several of them were in the dust of the trail, and the survivors were being pressed by a number of determined swordsmen.  Baro wheeled and slid down the incline, closely followed by the rest of the group.  The surrounded bandits fought desperately, but hopelessly. The charge from the hill had driven them off balance, and they were never given a chance to recover. At last, Musa and Baro looked over the results of the raid.  They had lost several guards. One trader, Klaron, had been killed by an arrow launched early in the attack. Several of the survivors were wounded.  \"We'll have to hire some more guards and drivers in Jogurth,\" said Baro. \"And what are we going to do about Klaron's goods?\"  \"We can divide them and sell them in Jogurth,\" Musa told him. \"Klaron has a brother back in Karth who can use the money, and money's a lot easier to carry than goods. You'll see him on your return trip.\"  Baro nodded, and started up the line, reorganizing the caravan. At last, they got under way again, and resumed their slow way toward the plateau.         *       * "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22426"],["title","The Players (#2)"],["body","      *       *       *  The caravan went on, to enter the plateau, where the traders started resting by day and traveling by night, to avoid exertion during the day's heat.  They came to the city of Jogurth, which for most of them was a terminal. From there, they would return to Karth, a few possibly going on to their homes still farther west. Musa stayed in town for a few days, trading his few remaining eastern goods for locally produced articles, and helping in the sale of Klaron's goods. At last, he joined another caravan, headed by an old trader, Kerunar, who habitually traveled between Jogurth and Manotro, on the east coast.  The trip across the Soruna Kran was uneventful, and Musa finally saw the glint of the Eastern Sea. He did not stay long in Manotro, for he discovered that the small channel ships traveled frequently, and he was able to guide his pack beasts to the wharf, where his bales were accepted for shipment. Leaving his goods, he led his animals back to the market.  Old Kerunar shook his head when he saw Musa. \"Be careful, son,\" he cautioned. \"I've been coming here for twenty years. Used to trade in Norlar, too. But you couldn't get me over there now for ten thousand caldor.\"  \"Oh?\" Musa looked at him curiously. \"What's wrong?\"  Kerunar looked at his newly set up booth. Hung about it were durable goods and trinkets from a dozen cities. There were articles even from far-off Telon, in the Konassan gulf. He looked back at Musa.  \"Norlar,\" he declared, \"has fallen into the hands of thieves and murderers. You can trade there, to be sure. You can even make a profit. But you cannot be sure you will not excite the avarice of the Kondarans, or arouse their anger. For they have a multitude of strange laws, which they can invoke against anyone, and which they enforce with confiscation of goods. Death or slavery await any who protest their actions or question their rules.\" He paused.  [Illustration]  \"Some manage to trade, and come back with profitable bales. Some leave their goods in the hands of the priests of Kondaro. Some remain, to find a quick death. But I stop here. I prefer to deal with honorable men. When I face the thief or the bandit, I prefer to have a weapon in my hand. A book of strange laws can be worse than any bandit born.\"  Musa looked about the market. \"Here, of course,\" he acknowledged, \"are the goods of the Far East. But I must see them at their source.\" He shook his head. \"No,\" he decided, \"I shall make one trip at least.\"  \"I'll give you just one word of caution, then,\" he was told. \"Whatever you see, make little comment. Whenever you are asked for an offering, make no objection, but give liberally. Keep your eyes open and your opinions to yourself.\"  \"Thanks.\" Musa grinned. \"I'll try to remember.\"  \"Don't just remember. Follow the advice, if you wish to return.\"  Musa's grin widened. \"I'll be back,\" he promised.         *       *       *       *       *  The harbor of Tanagor, chief seaport of Norlar, was full of shipping. Here were the ships which plied the trackless wastes of the Eastern Sea. Huge, red-sailed, broad-beamed, they rode at anchor in the harbor, served by small galleys from the city. Tied up at the wharves, were the smaller, yellow and white-sailed ships which crossed the channel between the mainland and the island empire.  Slowly, Musa's ship drew in toward the wharf, where a shouting gang of porters and stevedores awaited her arrival. Together with other passengers, Musa stood at the rail, watching the activity on the pier.  Four slaves, bearing a crimson curtained litter, came to the wharf and stopped. The curtains opened, and a man stepped out. He was not large, nor did his face or figure differ from the normal. But his elegantly embroidered crimson and gold robes made him a colorfully outstanding figure, even on this colorful waterfront. And the imperious assurance of his bearing made him impossible to ignore.  He adjusted his strangely shaped, flat cap, glanced about the wharf haughtily, and beckoned to one of the slaves, who reached inside the litter and took from it an ornately decorated crimson chest. Another slave joined him, and the two, carrying the chest with every evidence of reverent care, followed their crimson-cloaked master as he strode into a pier office.  Musa turned to one of the other merchants, his eyebrows raised inquiringly.  \"A priest of Kondaro,\" whispered the other. \"In this land, they are supreme. Take care never to anger one of them, or to approach too closely to the sacred chest their slaves carry. To do so can mean prompt execution.\"  As Musa started to thank the man for his friendly warning, a cry of \"Line Ho!\" caused him to turn his attention to the mooring parties. Lines had been cast aboard at bow and stern, and the ship was rapidly being secured to stout bollards ashore.  A gang of stevedores quickly rigged a gangway amidships, and porters commenced streaming aboard to carry the cargo ashore. Another gangway was rigged aft for the passengers. At the foot of this, stood one of the priest's litter bearers, a slave with a crimson loincloth. In his hands, he held a large, red bowl, which was decorated with intricate gold designs. Beside him, stood his companion, a sturdy, frowning fellow, who held a large, strangely shaped sword in his hand. Musa's previous mentor leaned toward him nodding to the group.  \"Don't forget or fail to put a coin in that bowl,\" he cautioned. \"Otherwise, you'll never get passage on one of the sacred ships.\"  \"How much?\" queried Musa.  \"The more, the better. If you want quick passage across the Great Sea, better make it at least ten caldor.\"  Musa shrugged, reaching into his purse for a gold coin.  \"Maybe I should be in the priesthood myself, instead of the trading business,\" he told himself silently.  As he passed the bowl, he noted that the other trader dropped only a silver piece. On the wharf, the incoming passengers were being guided into groups. Musa noted that his group was the smallest, and that his previous friend had gone to another, larger group. An official, tablet in hand, approached.  \"Your name, Traveler?\"  \"Musa, trader, of Karth.\"  \"You have goods?\"  \"I brought twelve bales. They are marked with my name.\"  \"Very good, sir. We will hold them for your disposal. You may claim them at any time after mid-day.\" The man wrote rapidly on his tablet.  Musa thanked him, then turned to see how his shipboard acquaintance was progressing. He had questions to ask about gold and silver coins.  He watched the older merchant complete his conversation with an official, and, as he started to leave the wharf, quickly caught up with him. At Musa's approach, the other held up a hand.  \"I know,\" he said. \"Why did I tell you to make a generous offering, then put a smaller coin in the bowl myself? That is what you want to know?\"  \"Precisely,\" Musa replied. \"I'm not a poor man, but I'm not a wealthy holiday seeker, either. This voyage has to pay.\"  The other smiled. \"Exactly why I advised you as I did. Come into this wineshop, and I'll tell you the story.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Over the drinks, the older man explained himself. An experienced trader, he had been operating between the mainland and Norlar for many years. It had been a profitable business, for the island had been dependent upon the mainland for many staple items, and had in return furnished many items of exquisite craftsmanship, as well as the produce of its extensive fisheries and pearl beds.  Then, the prophet, Sira Nal, had come with his preachings of a great sea god, Kondaro, ruler of the Eastern Sea. Tonda told of the unbelief that had confronted the prophet, and of the positive proof that Sira Nal had offered, when he had gathered a group of converts, collected enough money to purchase a ship, and made a highly successful voyage to the distant lands to the east. Upon his return, Sira Nal had found a ready market for the strange and wonderful products he had brought. He also had found many more converts for his new religion.  His original group, now a priesthood, were the only men who could give protection and guidance to a ship in a voyage past the sea demons who frequented the Eastern Sea, and they demanded large offerings to compensate for their services. Of course, a few adventurous shipowners had attempted to duplicate Sira Nal's feat without the aid of a priest, but no living man had seen their ships or crews again.  The profits from the rich, new trade, plus the alms of the traders visiting Tanagor, had rapidly filled the coffers of Kondaro. A great temple had been built, and the priests had become more and more powerful, until now, not too many years after the first voyage of Sira Nal, they virtually ruled the island.  For some years, Tonda, a conservative man and a firm believer in his own ancestral gods, had paid little attention to this strange, new religion. Upon arrival at Tanagor, to be sure, he had sometimes placed small offerings in the votive bowl, but more often, he had merely strode past the Slave of Kondaro, and gone upon his affairs.  At last, however, attracted by the great profits in the new, oversea trade, he had decided to arrange for a voyage in one of the great ships. Then, the efficiency of the priestly bookkeeping methods had become apparent. The Great God had become incensed at Tonda's impiety during his many previous trips across the channel, and a curse had been placed upon him and upon his goods. Of course, if Tonda wished to do penance, and to make votive offerings, amounting to about two thousand caldor, it might be that the Great God would relent and allow his passage, but only with new goods. His former possessions had been destroyed by the angry Kondaro in his wrath at Tonda's attempts to place them in one of the sacred ships. Empty-handed, Tonda had returned to the mainland.  \"But why did you return with more goods?\" inquired Musa.  Tonda smiled. \"The wrath of Kondaro extends only to the"]]]
