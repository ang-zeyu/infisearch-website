The town is situated on both sides of a river of the same name, about eighteen miles from its mouths.  The steamer on which was the pleasant home of the millionaire at eighteen, who was accompanied by his mother and a considerable party, all of whom have been duly presented to the reader in the former volumes of the series, lay in the middle of the river. The black smoke was pouring out of her smokestack, and the hissing steam indicated that the vessel was all ready to go down the river to the China Sea. Her anchor had been hove up, and the pilot was in the pilot-house waiting for the commander to strike the gong in the engine-room to start the screw.  Just astern of the Guardian-Mother was a very trim and beautiful steam-launch, fifty feet in length. The most prominent persons on board of her were the quartette of American boys, known on board of the steamer in which they had sailed half round the world as the \"Big Four.\" Of this number Louis Belgrave, the young millionaire, was the most important individual in the estimation of his companions, though happily not in his own.  Like a great many other young men of eighteen, which was the age of three of them, while the fourth was hardly sixteen, they were fond of adventure,--of hunting, fishing, and sporting in general. They had gone over a large portion of Europe, visited the countries on the shores of the Mediterranean, crossed India, and called at some of the ports of Burma, the Malay peninsula, Sumatra, Java, Celebes, and had reached Sarawak in their explorations.  They had visited many of the great cities of the world, and seen the temples, monuments, palaces, and notable structures of all kinds they contain; but they had become tired of this description of sight-seeing. When the island of Borneo was marked on the map as one of the localities to be visited, the \"Big Four\" had a meeting in the boudoir, as one of the apartments of the Guardian-Mother was called, and voted that they had had enough of temples, monuments, and great cities for the present.  They agreed that exploring a part of Borneo, with the incidental hunting, fishing, and study of natural history, would suit them better. Louis Belgrave was appointed a committee of one to petition the commander to allow them three weeks in the island for this purpose. Captain Ringgold suggested to Louis that it was rather selfish to leave the rest of the party on the steamer, stuck in the mud of the Sarawak, while they were on the rivers and in the woods enjoying themselves.  But the representative of the \"Big Four\" protested that they did not mean anything of the sort. They did not care a straw for the temples and other sights of Siam, Cambodia, and French Cochin-China; and while they were exploring Borneo and shooting orang-outangs, the Guardian-Mother should proceed to Bangkok and Saigon, and the rest of the tourists could enjoy themselves to the full in seeing the wonders of Farther India.  It required a great deal of discussion to induce the commander, and then the mothers of two of the explorers, to assent to this plan; but the objections were finally overcome by the logic and the eloquence of Louis. The Blanche, the consort of the Guardian-Mother, having on board the owner, known as General Noury, his wife and his father-in-law, had nothing to do with this difficult question; but the general had a steam-launch, which he was kind enough to grant for the use of the explorers.  The third engineer of the ship was to go with the quartette, in charge of the engine; five of the youngest of the seamen were selected to make the venture safer than it might otherwise have been. Achang Bakir, a native Bornean, who had been picked up off the Nicobar Islands, after the wreck of the dhow of which he had been in command, was to be the guide and interpreter.  The youngsters and their assistants had taken their places on board of the \"Blanchita,\" as Louis had christened the craft, and she was to accompany the two large steamers down the river. But the farewells had all been spoken, the hugging and kissing disposed of, and the tears had even been wiped away. The mothers had become in some degree reconciled to the separation of three weeks.  The Guardian-Mother started her screw, and began to move very slowly down the river, amid the cheers and salutations of the officers, soldiers, and citizens of the town. The Blanche followed her, and both steamers fired salutes in honor of the spectators to their departure. The Blanchita secured a position on the starboard of the Guardian-Mother, and for three hours kept up a communication with their friends by signals and shouts.  Off the mouth of the Moritabas, one of the outlets of the stream, the steamers stopped their screws, and the \"Big Four\" went alongside of the Guardian-Mother; the adieux were repeated, and then the ships laid the course for their destination. Both of the latter kept up an incessant screaming with their steam whistles, and the party on board of them waved their handkerchiefs, to which the \"Big Four,\" assisted by the sailors, responded in like manner, while the engineer gave whistle for whistle in feeble response.  When the whistles ceased, and the signals could no longer be seen, the Blanchita came about, and headed for the Peak of Santubong on the triangular island formed by the two passes of the Sarawak River. The explorers watched the ships till they could no longer be seen, and then headed up the river.  \"Faix, the bridges betune oursels and civiloization are all broke down!\" exclaimed Felix McGavonty, who sometimes used his Milesian dialect in order, as he put it, not to lose his mother's brogue.  \"Not so bad as that, Felix; for there is considerable civilization lying around loose in Borneo,\" replied Louis Belgrave.  \"Not much of it here is found,\" added Achang Bakir, the Bornean.  \"Is found here,\" interposed Morris Woolridge, who had been giving the native lessons in English, for he mixed with it the German idiom.  \"Rajah Brooke has civilized the region which he governs, and the Dutch have done the same in portions of their territory. Professor Giroud gave us the lecture on Borneo, and we shall have occasion to review some of it,\" added Louis. \"But I think we had better give some attention to the organization of our party for the trip up the Sarawak River.\"  \"I move, Mr. Chairman, that we have the same organization we had on board of the Maud,\" interposed Felix, dropping his brogue. \"That means that Mr. Scott shall be captain, and Morris mate, while Louis and myself shall be the deck-hands.\"  \"Mr. Chairman, I move an amendment to the motion, to the effect that Louis shall be captain, while I serve as deck-hand,\" said Scott.  \"I hope the amendment will be voted down, and that the original motion will prevail,\" Louis objected. \"Captain Scott, in command of the Maud, on a voyage of two thousand miles, proved himself to be an able and skilful commander, as well as a prudent and successful leader in several difficult situations. He is the right person for the position. Question! Those in favor of the amendment of Mr. Scott will signify it by raising the right hand.\"  Scott voted for his own motion, and he was the only one.  \"Contrary minded, by the same sign,\" continued Louis, raising his right hand, Felix and Morris voting the same. \"The amendment is lost. The question is now on the original motion of Felix. Those in favor of its adoption will signify it.\"  Three hands appeared, the motion was carried, and the chairman informed Scott and Morris that they were chosen captain and mate. Scott was outvoted, and he made no further objection. Of the five seamen on board he appointed Pitts cook and steward, in which capacity he had served on board of the Maud. The starboard is the captain's watch; though the second mate, when there is one, takes his place for duty, and the port is the mate's watch.  \"I select Clingman for the first of my watch,\" continued Scott. \"Your choice next, Morris.\"  \"Wales,\" said the mate.  \"Lane for the starboard,\" added Scott.  \"Hobson's choice,\" laughed Morris, as he took the last man. \"Clinch for the port; the last, but by no means the least.\"  \"I fancy the watches will have an easy time of it; for I suppose we shall not do much running up and down these rivers, and through dark forests, in the night,\" suggested Louis.  \"If we lie up in the night, I shall divide them both into"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24252"],["title","Four Young Explorers; Or, Sight-Seeing in the Tropics (#2)"],["body","arter-watches, and have one man on duty all the time; for we may be boarded by a huge crocodile or a boa-constrictor if we are not on the lookout. But Achang is a pilot for these rivers. Isn't that so, Captain Bakir?\"  \"I have been up and down all the rivers in this part of the island, though I was not shipped as a pilot then,\" replied Achang, who had been the captain of a dhow, and on board the ship he had been called by his first name or the other with the title.  \"All right; we shall use you for pilot or interpreter as occasion may require; and I suppose you can tell us all we want to know about the country and the people,\" added the captain.  Clinch, one of the ablest seamen on board, was steering the launch, and Scott kept the run of the courses; but as long as the craft had three feet of water under her, she was all right. The conversation took place in the cabin, as the explorers called the after part of the steamer, though no such apartment had been built there.  A frame constructed of brass rods, properly braced, extended the entire length of the launch. A stanchion at the bow and another at the stern, with five on each side set in the rail, supported a rod the whole distance around the craft. Another extended from the bow to the stern stanchion, directly over the keel, about six inches higher than those at the sides. Ten rods led from the central down to the side rods, like the rafters of a house.  Over the whole, of this structure above was extended a single piece of painted canvas, serving as a roof, and keeping out both sun and rain. It was laced very taut to the rods, and had slope enough to make the water run off. On the sides were curtains, which could be hauled down tight. The launch had been used by the rajah on the Ganges, and when closed in the interior was like \"a bug in a rug.\"  Thus closed in, the standing-room was called the cabin. It was surrounded by wide cushioned seats, which made very good beds at night. Between these divans was a table where the meals of the explorers were to be served. Under the seats were many lockers for all sorts of articles, the bedding, and the arms and ammunition.  Just forward of the cabin were the engine and boiler, with bunkers on each side for the coal. In the middle of the craft was abundant space. The forward part of the boat was provided with cushioned divans, where passengers could sit by day or sleep at night; and this space was appropriated to the sailors. In the centre of it was the wheel. Next to it was the galley, with a stove large enough to cook for a dozen persons, and all needed utensils.  The ship's company had looked the craft over with great interest, and all of them were well pleased with the arrangements. The launch had been put into the water and fitted up for use the day before. The party from both ships had visited her, and almost wished they were to go to the interior of the country in her.  The Blanchita continued on her course up the river. Pitts was at work in the galley; and as soon as the launch was made fast off the \"go-down,\" or business building of the town, dinner was served to the seamen, and later to the denizens of the cabin. The afternoon was spent in examining the place, and in obtaining such supplies as were needed; for the boat was to sail on her voyage up the river early the next morning.  With the assistance of Achang, a small sampan, a kind of skiff, was purchased; for the Bornean declared that it would be needed in the hunting excursions of the party, for much of the country was flooded with water, a foot or two in depth.      CHAPTER II  A VOYAGE UP THE SARAWAK RIVER   The young hunters slept on board of the Blanchita, and they were delighted with their accommodations. Sarawak, or Kuching, the native name of the town, is only about one hundred and fifty miles north of the equator, and must therefore be a very warm region, though away from the low land near the sea-coast it is fairly healthy. The party slept with the curtains raised, which left them practically in the open air.  Achang had given them a hint on board of the ship that mosquitoes were abundant in some localities in Borneo. The Guardian-Mother was provided with the material, and the ladies had made a dozen mosquito bars for the explorers. They were canopies, terminating in a point at the top, where they were suspended to the cross rods on which the canvas roof was supported. The netting was tucked in under the cushions of the divan, and the sleepers were perfectly protected.  Captain Scott had carried out his plan in regard to the watches. The cook was exempted from all duty in working the little steamer; but each of the other seamen was required to keep a half-watch of two hours during the first night on board. Clinch was on watch at four in the morning. He called the engineer at this hour, and Felipe proceeded at once to get up steam. It was still dark, for the sun rises and sets at six o'clock on the equator.  As soon as there was a movement on board, all hands turned out forward. There were no decks to wash down; and, if there had been, the water was hardly fit, in the judgment of the mate, for this purpose, for it was murky, and looked as though it was muddy; but it was not so bad as it appeared, for the dark color was caused by vegetable matter from the jungles and forest, and not from the mud, which remained at the bottom of the stream.  \"The top uv the marnin' to ye's!\" shouted Felix, as he leaped from his bed about five o'clock,--for all hands had turned in about eight o'clock in the evening, as the mosquitoes, attracted by the lanterns, began to be very troublesome,--and the Milesian could sleep no longer.  \"What's the matter with you, Flix?\" demanded the captain.  \"Sure, if ye's mane to git under way afore night, it's toime to turn out,\" replied Felix. \"Don't ye's hear the schtaym sizzlin' in the froy'n pan?\"  \"But it isn't light yet,\" protested Scott.  \"Bekase the lanthern in the cab'n bloinds your two oyes, and makes the darkness shoine broighter nor the loight,\" said Felix, as he looked at his watch. \"Sure, it's tin minutes afther foive in the marnin'. These beds are altogidther too foine, Captain.\"  \"How's that, Flix?\" asked Scott, as he opened the netting and leaped out of bed.  \"They're too comfor-_ta_-ble, bad 'cess to 'em, and a b'y cud slape till sundown in 'em till the broke o' noight.\"  \"Dry up, Flix, or else speak English,\" called Louis, as he left his bed. \"There is no end of 'paddies' along this river, and I'm sure they cannot understand your lingo.\"  \"Is it paddies in this haythen oisland?\" demanded Felix, suspending the operation of dressing himself, and staring at his fellow deck-hand. \"I don't belayve a wurrud of ut!\"  \"Are there no paddies up this river, Achang?\" said Louis, appealing to the Bornean.  \"Plenty of paddies on all the streams about here,\" replied the native.  \"And they can't oondershtand Kilkenny Greek! They're moighty quare paddies, thin.\"  \"They are; and I am very sure they won't answer you when you speak to them with that brogue,\" added Louis.  \"We will let that discussion rest till we come to the paddies,\" interposed the captain, as he completed his toilet, and left the cabin.  By this time all the party had left their beds and dressed themselves; for their toilet was not at all elaborate, consisting mainly of a woollen shirt, a pair of trousers, and a pair of heavy shoes, without socks. Felipe had steam enough on to move the boat; and the seamen had wiped the moisture from all the wood and brass work, and had put everything in good order.  \"Are you a pilot for this river, Achang?\" asked Scott, as the party came together in the waist, the space forward of the engine.  \"I am; but there is not much piloting to be done, for all you have to do is to keep in the middle of the stream,\" replied the Bornean. \"I went up and down all the rivers of Sarawak in a sampan with an English gentleman who was crocodiles, monkeys, mias, snakes, and birds picking up.\"  \"Wrong!\" exclaimed Morris. \"You know better than that, Achang.\"  The native repeated the reply, putting the verb where it ought to be.  \"He was a naturalist,\" added Louis.  \"Yes; that was what they called him in the town.\"  \"I think we all know the animals of which you speak, Achang, except one,\" said Louis. \"I never heard of a mias.\"  \"That is what Borneo people call the orang-outang,\" replied the native.  \"Orang means a man, and outang a jungle, and the whole of it is a jungle man,\" Louis explained, for the benefit of his companions; for he was better read in natural history than any of them, as he had read all the books on that subject in the library of the ship. \"In Professor Hornaday's book, 'Two Years in the Jungle,' which was exceedingly interesting to me, he calls this animal the 'orang-utan,' which is only another way of spelling the second word.\"  \"Excuse me, Louis, but I think we will get under way, and hear your explanations at another time,\" interposed Captain Scott.  \"I have finished all I had to say.\"  \"Take the wheel, Achang,\" continued the captain.  The sampan was sent ashore to cast off the fasts. The river at the town is over four hundred feet wide, and deep enough in almost any part for the Blanchita. As soon as the lines were hauled in, the captain rang one bell, and Felipe started the engine. The helmsman headed the boat for the middle of the stream, and the captain rang the speed-bell. When hurried, the Blanchita was good for ten knots an hour, but her ordinary speed was eight.  On the side of the river opposite Kuching, or Sarawak, was the kampon of the Malays and other natives; and the term means a division or district of a town. Many of the natives of this village had visited the Blanchita,--some for trade, some for employment, and some from mere curiosity. None of them were allowed to go on board of the launch; for, while the Dyaks are remarkably honest people, the Malays and Chinese will steal without any very heavy temptation."]]]
