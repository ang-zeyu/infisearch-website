In well-managed coal mines the labour of a hundred miners furnishes each year enough fuel to warm ten thousand families under an inclement sky. And we have lately witnessed the spectacle of wonderful cities springing up in a few months for international exhibitions, without interrupting in the slightest degree the regular work of the nations.  And if in manufactures as in agriculture, and as indeed through our whole social system, the labour, the discoveries, and the inventions of our ancestors profit chiefly the few, it is none the less certain that mankind in general, aided by the creatures of steel and iron which it already possesses, could already procure an existence of wealth and ease for every one of its members.  Truly, we are rich--far richer than we think; rich in what we already possess, richer still in the possibilities of production of our actual mechanical outfit; richest of all in what we might win from our soil, from our manufactures, from our science, from our technical knowledge, were they but applied to bringing about the well-being of all.   II  In our civilized societies we are rich. Why then are the many poor? Why this painful drudgery for the masses? Why, even to the best paid workman, this uncertainty for the morrow, in the midst of all the wealth inherited from the past, and in spite of the powerful means of production, which could ensure comfort to all, in return for a few hours of daily toil?  The Socialists have said it and repeated it unwearyingly. Daily they reiterate it, demonstrating it by arguments taken from all the sciences. It is because all that is necessary for production--the land, the mines, the highways, machinery, food, shelter, education, knowledge--all have been seized by the few in the course of that long story of robbery, enforced migration and wars, of ignorance and oppression, which has been the life of the human race before it had learned to subdue the forces of Nature. It is because, taking advantage of alleged rights acquired in the past, these few appropriate to-day two-thirds of the products of human labour, and then squander them in the most stupid and shameful way. It is because, having reduced the masses to a point at which they have not the means of subsistence for a month, or even for a week in advance, the few can allow the many to work, only on the condition of themselves receiving the lion's share. It is because these few prevent the remainder of men from producing the things they need, and force them to produce, not the necessaries of life for all, but whatever offers the greatest profits to the monopolists. In this is the substance of all Socialism.  Take, indeed, a civilized country. The forests which once covered it have been cleared, the marshes drained, the climate improved. It has been made habitable. The soil, which bore formerly only a coarse vegetation, is covered to-day with rich harvests. The rock-walls in the valleys are laid out in terraces and covered with vines. The wild plants, which yielded nought but acrid berries, or uneatable roots, have been transformed by generations of culture into succulent vegetables or trees covered with delicious fruits. Thousands of highways and railroads furrow the earth, and pierce the mountains. The shriek of the engine is heard in the wild gorges of the Alps, the Caucasus, and the Himalayas. The rivers have been made navigable; the coasts, carefully surveyed, are easy of access; artificial harbours, laboriously dug out and protected against the fury of the sea, afford shelter to the ships. Deep shafts have been sunk in the rocks; labyrinths of underground galleries have been dug out where coal may be raised or minerals extracted. At the crossings of the highways great cities have sprung up, and within their borders all the treasures of industry, science, and art have been accumulated.  Whole generations, that lived and died in misery, oppressed and ill-treated by their masters, and worn out by toil, have handed on this immense inheritance to our century.  For thousands of years millions of men have laboured to clear the forests, to drain the marshes, and to open up highways by land and water. Every rood of soil we cultivate in Europe has been watered by the sweat of several races of men. Every acre has its story of enforced labour, of intolerable toil, of the people's sufferings. Every mile of railway, every yard of tunnel, has received its share of human blood.  The shafts of the mine still bear on their rocky walls the marks made by the pick of the workman who toiled to excavate them. The space between each prop in the underground galleries might be marked as a miner's grave; and who can tell what each of these graves has cost, in tears, in privations, in unspeakable wretchedness to the family who depended on the scanty wage of the worker cut off in his prime by fire-damp, rock-fall, or flood?  The cities, bound together by railroads and waterways, are organisms which have lived through centuries. Dig beneath them and you find, one above another, the foundations of streets, of houses, of theatres, of public buildings. Search into their history and you will see how the civilization of the town, its industry, its special characteristics, have slowly grown and ripened through the co-operation of generations of its inhabitants before it could become what it is to-day. And even to-day, the value of each dwelling, factory, and warehouse, which has been created by the accumulated labour of the millions of workers, now dead and buried, is only maintained by the very presence and labour of legions of the men who now inhabit that special corner of the globe. Each of the atoms composing what we call the Wealth of Nations owes its value to the fact that it is a part of the great whole. What would a London dockyard or a great Paris warehouse be if they were not situated in these great centres of international commerce? What would become of our mines, our factories, our workshops, and our railways, without the immense quantities of merchandise transported every day by sea and land?  Millions of human beings have laboured to create this civilization on which we pride ourselves to-day. Other millions, scattered through the globe, labour to maintain it. Without them nothing would be left in fifty years but ruins.  There is not even a thought, or an invention, which is not common property, born of the past and the present. Thousands of inventors, known and unknown, who have died in poverty, have co-operated in the invention of each of these machines which embody the genius of man.  Thousands of writers, of poets, of scholars, have laboured to increase knowledge, to dissipate error, and to create that atmosphere of scientific thought, without which the marvels of our century could never have appeared. And these thousands of philosophers, of poets, of scholars, of inventors, have themselves been supported by the labour of past centuries. They have been upheld and nourished through life, both physically and mentally, by legions of workers and craftsmen of all sorts. They have drawn their motive force from the environment.  The genius of a SÃ©guin, a Mayer, a Grove, has certainly done more to launch industry in new directions than all the capitalists in the world. But men of genius are themselves the children of industry as well as of science. Not until thousands of steam-engines had been working for years before all eyes, constantly transforming heat into dynamic force, and this force into sound, light, and electricity, could the insight of genius proclaim the mechanical origin and the unity of the physical forces. And if we, children of the nineteenth century, have at last grasped this idea, if we know now how to apply it, it is again because daily experience has prepared the way. The thinkers of the eighteenth century saw and declared it, but the idea remained undeveloped, because the eighteenth century had not grown up like ours, side by side with the steam-engine. Imagine the decades that might have passed while we remained in ignorance of this law, which has revolutionized modern industry, had Watt not found at Soho skilled workmen to embody his ideas in metal, bringing all the parts of his engine to perfection, so that steam, pent in a complete mechanism, and rendered more docile than a horse, more manageable than water, became at last the very soul of modern industry.  Every machine has had the same history--a long record of sleepless nights and of poverty, of disillusions and of joys, of partial improvements discovered by several generations of nameless workers, who have added to the original invention these little nothings, without which the most fertile idea would remain fruitless. More than that: every new invention is a synthesis, the resultant of innumerable inventions which have preceded it in the vast field of mechanics and industry.  Science and industry, knowledge and application, discovery and practical realization leading to new discoveries, cunning of brain and of hand, toil of mind and muscle--all work together. Each discovery, each advance, each increase in the sum of human riches, owes its being to the physical and mental travail of the past and the present.  By what right then can any one whatever appropriate the least morsel of this immense whole and say--This is mine, not yours?   III  It has come about, however, in the course of the ages traversed by the human race, that all that enables man to produce and to increase his power of production has been seized by the few. Some time, perhaps, we will relate how this came to pass. For the present let it suffice to state the fact and analyze its consequences.  To-day the soil, which actually owes its value to the needs of an ever-increasing population, belongs to a minority who prevent the people from cultivating it--or do not allow them to cultivate it according to modern "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2343"],["title","The Adventure of Wisteria Lodge (#1)"],["body","servant.  I noticed that after my host had read it he seemed even more distrait and strange than before.  He gave up all pretence at conversation and sat, smoking endless cigarettes, lost in his own thoughts, but he made no remark as to the contents.  About eleven I was glad to go to bed.  Some time later Garcia looked in at my door--the room was dark at the time--and asked me if I had rung.  I said that I had not.  He apologized for having disturbed me so late, saying that it was nearly one o'clock.  I dropped off after this and slept soundly all night.  \"And now I come to the amazing part of my tale.  When I woke it was broad daylight.  I glanced at my watch, and the time was nearly nine. I had particularly asked to be called at eight, so I was very much astonished at this forgetfulness.  I sprang up and rang for the servant.  There was no response.  I rang again and again, with the same result.  Then I came to the conclusion that the bell was out of order. I huddled on my clothes and hurried downstairs in an exceedingly bad temper to order some hot water.  You can imagine my surprise when I found that there was no one there.  I shouted in the hall.  There was no answer.  Then I ran from room to room. All were deserted.  My host had shown me which was his bedroom the night before, so I knocked at the door. No reply.  I turned the handle and walked in.  The room was empty, and the bed had never been slept in.  He had gone with the rest. The foreign host, the foreign footman, the foreign cook, all had vanished in the night!  That was the end of my visit to Wisteria Lodge.\"  Sherlock Holmes was rubbing his hands and chuckling as he added this bizarre incident to his collection of strange episodes.  \"Your experience is, so far as I know, perfectly unique,\" said he. \"May I ask, sir, what you did then?\"  \"I was furious.  My first idea was that I had been the victim of some absurd practical joke.  I packed my things, banged the hall door behind me, and set off for Esher, with my bag in my hand. I called at Allan Brothers', the chief land agents in the village, and found that it was from this firm that the villa had been rented.  It struck me that the whole proceeding could hardly be for the purpose of making a fool of me, and that the main object must be to get out of the rent.  It is late in March, so quarter-day is at hand.  But this theory would not work.  The agent was obliged to me for my warning, but told me that the rent had been paid in advance.  Then I made my way to town and called at the Spanish embassy.  The man was unknown there.  After this I went to see Melville, at whose house I had first met Garcia, but I found that he really knew rather less about him than I did. Finally when I got your reply to my wire I came out to you, since I gather that you are a person who gives advice in difficult cases.  But now, Mr. Inspector, I understand, from what you said when you entered the room, that you can carry the story on, and that some tragedy had occurred. I can assure you that every word I have said is the truth, and that, outside of what I have told you, I know absolutely nothing about the fate of this man.  My only desire is to help the law in every possible way.\"  \"I am sure of it, Mr. Scott Eccles--I am sure of it,\" said Inspector Gregson in a very amiable tone.  \"I am bound to say that everything which you have said agrees very closely with the facts as they have come to our notice.  For example, there was that note which arrived during dinner.  Did you chance to observe what became of it?\"  \"Yes, I did.  Garcia rolled it up and threw it into the fire.\"  \"What do you say to that, Mr. Baynes?\"  The country detective was a stout, puffy, red man, whose face was only redeemed from grossness by two extraordinarily bright eyes, almost hidden behind the heavy creases of cheek and brow.  With a slow smile he drew a folded and discoloured scrap of paper from his pocket.  \"It was a dog-grate, Mr. Holmes, and he overpitched it.  I picked this out unburned from the back of it.\"  Holmes smiled his appreciation.  \"You must have examined the house very carefully to find a single pellet of paper.\"  \"I did, Mr. Holmes.  It's my way.  Shall I read it, Mr. Gregson?\"  The Londoner nodded.  \"The note is written upon ordinary cream-laid paper without watermark. It is a quarter-sheet.  The paper is cut off in two snips with a short-bladed scissors.  It has been folded over three times and sealed with purple wax, put on hurriedly and pressed down with some flat oval object.  It is addressed to Mr. Garcia, Wisteria Lodge. It says:  \"Our own colours, green and white.  Green open, white shut.  Main stair, first corridor, seventh right, green baize.  Godspeed.  D.  \"It is a woman's writing, done with a sharp-pointed pen, but the address is either done with another pen or by someone else.  It is thicker and bolder, as you see.\"  \"A very remarkable note,\" said Holmes, glancing it over.  \"I must compliment you, Mr. Baynes, upon your attention to detail in your examination of it.  A few trifling points might perhaps be added. The oval seal is undoubtedly a plain sleeve-link--what else is of such a shape?  The scissors were bent nail scissors.  Short as the two snips are, you can distinctly see the same slight curve in each.\"  The country detective chuckled.  \"I thought I had squeezed all the juice out of it, but I see there was a little over,\" he said.  \"I'm bound to say that I make nothing of the note except that there was something on hand, and that a woman, as usual was at the bottom of it.\"  Mr. Scott Eccles had fidgeted in his seat during this conversation.  \"I am glad you found the note, since it corroborates my story,\" said he.  \"But I beg to point out that I have not yet heard what has happened to Mr. Garcia, nor what has become of his household.\"  \"As to Garcia,\" said Gregson, \"that is easily answered.  He was found dead this morning upon Oxshott Common, nearly a mile from his home. His head had been smashed to pulp by heavy blows of a sandbag or some such instrument, which had crushed rather than wounded.  It is a lonely corner, and there is no house within a quarter of a mile of the spot. He had apparently been struck down first from behind, but his assailant had gone on beating him long after he was dead.  It was a most furious assault.  There are no footsteps nor any clue to the criminals.\"  \"Robbed?\"  \"No, there was no attempt at robbery.\"  \"This is very painful--very painful and terrible,\" said Mr. Scott Eccles in a querulous voice, \"but it is really uncommonly hard on me. I had nothing to do with my host going off upon a nocturnal excursion and meeting so sad an end.  How do I come to be mixed up with the case?\"  \"Very simply, sir,\" Inspector Baynes answered.  \"The only document found in the pocket of the deceased was a letter from you saying that you would be with him on the night of his death. It was the envelope of this letter which gave us the dead man's name and address.  It was after nine this morning when we reached his house and found neither you nor anyone else inside it.  I wired to Mr. Gregson to run you down in London while I examined Wisteria Lodge.  Then I came into town, joined Mr. Gregson, and here we are.\"  \"I think now,\" said Gregson, rising, \"we had best put this matter into an official shape.  You will come round with us to the station, Mr. Scott Eccles, and let us have your statement in writing.\"  \"Certainly, I will come at once.  But I retain your services, Mr. Holmes.  I desire you to spare no expense and no pains to get at the truth.\"  My friend turned to the country inspector.  \"I suppose that you have no objection to my collaborating with you, Mr. Baynes?\"  \"Highly honoured, sir, I am sure.\"  \"You appear to have been very prompt and businesslike in all that you have done.  Was there any clue, may I ask, as to the exact hour that the man met his death?\"  \"He had been there since one o'clock.  There was rain about that time, and his death had certainly been before the rain.\"  \"But that is perfectly impossible, Mr. Baynes,\" cried our client. \"His voice is unmistakable.  I could swear to it that it was he who addressed me in my bedroom at that very hour.\"  \"Remarkable, but by no means impossible,\" said Holmes, smiling.  \"You have a clue?\" asked Gregson.  \"On the face of it the case is not a very complex one, though it certainly presents some novel and interesting features.  A further knowledge of facts is necessary before I would venture to give a final and definite opinion.  By the way, Mr. Baynes, did you find anything remarkable besides this note in your examination of the house?\"  The detective looked at my friend in a singular way.  \"There were,\" said he, \"one or two _very_ remarkable things. Perhaps when I have finished at the police-station you would care to come out and give me your opinion of them.\"  \"I am entirely at your service,\" said Sherlock Holmes, ringing the bell.  \"You will show these gentlemen out, Mrs. Hudson, and kindly send the boy with this telegram.  He is to pay a five-shilling reply.\"  We sat for some time in silence after our visitors had left. Holmes smoked hard, with his browns drawn down over his keen eyes, and his head thrust forward in the eager way characteristic of the man.  \"Well, Watson,\" he asked, turning suddenly upon me, \"what do you make of it?\"  \"I can make nothing of this mystification of Scott Eccles.\"  \"But the crime?\"  \"Well, taken with the disappearance of the man's companions, I should say that they were in some way concerned in the murder and had fled from justice.\"  \"That is certainly a possible point of view.  On the face of it you must admit, however, that it is very strange that his two servants should have been in a conspiracy against him and should have attacked him on the one night when he had a guest.  They had him alone at their mercy every other night in the week.\"  \"Then why did they fly?\"  \"Quite so.  Why did they fly?  There is a"]]]
