He started on his way to the store in the morning, prepared to notify Mr. Tripp that he would remain, but he found that it was too late. Just before he reached the store, he met Abel Wood, a loose-jointed, towheaded boy, with a stout body and extraordinarily long legs, who greeted him with a grin.  “I’m goin’ to work in your place Monday mornin’,” he said.  “Has Mr. Tripp spoken to you?” asked Chester, his heart sinking.  “Yes, he said you was goin’ to leave. What’s up?”  “Mr. Tripp cut down my wages,” said Chester. “I couldn’t work for two dollars and a half.”  “He’s only goin’ to give me two and a quarter.”  “You can afford to work for that. Your father’s got steady work.”  “Yes, but all the same I’ll ask for more in a few weeks. Where are you goin’ to work?”  “I don’t know yet,” answered Chester, sadly.  “It’s awful hard to get a place in Wyncombe.”  “I suppose it is. I hope something will turn up.”  He tried to speak hopefully, but there was very little hope in his heart.  He went about his work in a mechanical way, but neglected nothing. When the time came for the store to close, Silas Tripp took three dollars from the drawer and handed it to him, saying: “There’s your wages, Chester. I expect it’s the last I’ll pay you.”  “Yes, sir, I suppose so.”  “I don’t know how I’ll like the Wood boy. He hain’t no experience.”  “He’ll get it, sir.”  “If you want to stay for two and a quarter—the same I’m going to give him—I’ll tell him I’ve changed my mind.”  “No, sir; it wouldn’t be right to put him off now. I guess I’ll get something else to do.”  He turned and left the store, walking with a slower step than usual. His heart was heavy, for he felt that, poorly as they lived hitherto, they must live more poorly still in the days to come. He reached home at last, and put the three dollars in his mother’s hands.  “I don’t know when I shall have any more money to give you, mother,” he said.  “It looks dark, Chester, but the Lord reigns. He will still be our friend.”  There was something in these simple words that cheered Chester, and a weight seemed lifted from his heart. He felt that they were not quite friendless, and that there was still One, kinder and more powerful than any earthly friend, to whom they could look for help.  When Monday morning came he rose at the usual hour and breakfasted.  “I’ll go out and take a walk, mother,” he said. “Perhaps I may find some work somewhere.”  Almost unconsciously, he took the familiar way to the store, and paused at a little distance from it. He saw Abel come out with some packages to carry to a customer. It pained him to see another boy in his place, and he turned away with a sigh.  During the night four or five inches of snow had fallen. This gave him an idea. As he came to the house of the Misses Cleveland, two maiden sisters who lived in a small cottage set back fifty feet from the road, he opened the gate and went up to the front door.  Miss Jane Cleveland opened it for him.  “Good-morning, Chester,” she said.  “Good-morning, Miss Cleveland. I thought you might want to get a path shoveled to the gate.”  “So I would; Hannah tried to do it last time it snowed, but she caught an awful cold. But ain’t you working up at the store?”  “Not now. Mr. Tripp cut down my wages, and I left.”  “Do tell. Have you got another place?”  “Not just yet. I thought I’d do any little jobs that came along till I got one.”  “That’s right. What’ll you charge to shovel a path?”  Chester hesitated.  “Fifteen cents,” he answered, at last.  “I’ll give you ten. Money’s skerce.”  Chester reflected that he could probably do the job in half an hour, and he accepted. It cheered him to think he was earning something, however small.  He worked with a will, and in twenty-five minutes the work was done.  “You’re spry,” said Jane Cleveland, when he brought the shovel to the door. “It took Hannah twice as long, and she didn’t do it as well.”  “It isn’t the kind of work for ladies,” replied Chester.  “Wait till I fetch the money.”  Miss Cleveland went into the house, and returned with a nickel and four pennies.  “I’m reely ashamed,” she said. “I’ll have to owe you a cent. But here’s a mince pie I’ve just baked. Take it home to your ma. Maybe it’ll come handy. I’ll try to think of the other cent next time you come along.”  “Don’t trouble yourself about it, Miss Cleveland. The pie is worth a good deal more than the cent. Mother’ll be very much obliged to you.”  “She’s very welcome, I’m sure,” said the kindly spinster. “I hope you’ll get work soon, Chester.”  “Thank you.”  Chester made his way homeward, as he did not care to carry the pie about with him. His mother looked at him in surprise as he entered the house.  “What have you there, Chester?” she asked.  “A pie from Miss Cleveland.”  “But how came she to give you a pie?”  “I shoveled a path for her, and she gave me a pie and ten cents—no, nine. So you see, mother, I’ve earned something this week.”  “I take it as a good omen. A willing hand will generally find work to do.”  “How are you off for wood, mother?”  “There is some left, Chester.”  “I’ll go out in the yard and work at the wood pile till dinner time. Then this afternoon I will go out again and see if I can find some more paths to shovel.”  But Chester was not destined to earn any more money that day. As a general thing, the village people shoveled their own paths, and would regard hiring such work done as sinful extravagance. Chester did, however, find some work to do. About half-past three he met Abel Wood tugging a large basket, filled with groceries, to the minister’s house. He had set it down, and was resting his tired arms when Chester came along.  “Give me a lift with this basket, Chester, that’s a good fellow,” said Abel.  Chester lifted it.  “Yes, it is heavy,” he said.  “The minister’s got some company,” went on Abel, “and he’s given an extra large order.”  “How do you like working in the store, Abel?”  “It’s hard work, harder than I thought.”  “But remember what a magnificent salary you will get,” said Chester, with a smile.  “It ain’t half enough. Say, Chester, old Tripp is rich, ain’t he?”  “I should call myself rich if I had his money.”  “He’s a miserly old hunks, then, to give me such small pay.”  “Don’t let him hear you say so.”  “I’ll take care of that. Come, you’ll help me, won’t you?”  “Yes,” answered Chester, good-naturedly; “I might as well, as I have nothing else to do.”  Between the two the basket was easily carried. In a short time they had reached the minister’s house. They took the basket around to the side door, just as Mr. Morris, the minister, came out, accompanied by a young man, who was evidently a stranger in the village, as Chester did not remember having seen him before.  “Chester,” said the minister, kindly, “how does it happen that you have an assistant to-day?”  “I am the assistant, Mr. Morris. Abel is Mr. Tripp’s new boy.”  “Indeed, I am surprised to hear that. When did you leave the store?”  “Last Saturday night.”  “Have you another place?”  “Not yet.”  “Are you at leisure this afternoon?”  “Yes, sir.”  “Then perhaps you will walk around with my friend, Mr. Conrad, and show him the village. I was going with him, but I have some writing to do, and you will do just as well.”  “I shall be very happy to go with Mr. Conrad,” said Chester, politely.  “And I shall be very glad to have you,” said the young man, with a pleasant smile.  “Come back to supper, Chester,” said the minister; “that is, if your mother can spare you.”  “Thank you, sir. I suppose you will be able to carry back the empty basket, Abel,” added Chester, as his successor emerged from the side door, relieved of his burden.  “I guess so,” answered Abel, with a grin.  “I was never in Wyncombe before,” began Mr. Conrad, “though I am a second cousin of your minister, Mr. Morris. I have to go away to-morrow morning, and wish to see a little of the town while I am here.”  “Where do you live, Mr. Conrad?”  “In the city of New York.”  “Are you a minister, too?”  “Oh, no!” laughed the young man. “I am in a very different business. I am an artist—in a small way. I make sketches for books and magazines.”  “And does that pay?”  “Fairly well. I earn a comfortable living.”  “I didn’t know one could get money for making pictures. I like to draw, myself.”  “I will see what you can do this evening; that is, if you accept my cousin’s invitation.”  Before the walk was over Chester had become much interested in his new friend. He listened eagerly to his stories of the great city, and felt that life must be much better worth living there than in Wyncombe.     CHAPTER III.  A NOTEWORTHY EVENING.   Chester enjoyed his supper. Mr. Morris, though a minister, had none of the starched dignity that many of his profession think it necessary to assume. He was kindly and genial, with a pleasant humor that made him agreeable company for the young as well as the old. Mr. Conrad spoke much of New York and his experiences there, and Chester listened to him eagerly.  “You have never been to New York, Chester?” said the young artist.  “No, sir, but I have read about it—and dreamed about it. Sometime I hope to go there.”  “I think that is the dream of every country boy. Well, it is the country boys that make the most successful men.”  “How do you account for that, Herbert?” asked the minister.  “Generally they have been brought up to work, and work more earnestly than the city boys.”  When the supper table was cleared, Mr. Conrad took from his valise two or three of the latest issues of _Puck_, _Judge_ and _Life_. He handed them to Chester, who looked over them eagerly.  “Do you ever contribute to these papers, Mr. Conrad?” he asked.  “Yes; here is a sketch in _Judge_, and another in _Life_, which I furnished.”  “And do you get good pay for them?”  “I received ten dollars for each.”  Chester’s eyes opened with surprise.  “Why,” he said, “they are small. It couldn’t have taken you long to draw them.” "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23108"],["title","Chester Rand; or, The New Path to Fortune (#2)"],["body"," “Probably half an hour for each one.”  “And you received ten dollars each?”  “Yes, but don’t gauge such work by the time it takes. It is the idea that is of value. The execution is a minor matter.”  Chester looked thoughtful.  “I should like to be an artist,” he said, after a pause.  “Won’t you give me a specimen of your work? You have seen mine.”  “I have not done any comic work, but I think I could.”  “Here is a piece of drawing paper. Now, let me see what you can do.”  Chester leaned his head on his hand and began to think. He was in search of an idea. The young artist watched him with interest. At last his face brightened up. He seized the pencil, and began to draw rapidly. In twenty minutes he handed the paper to Mr. Conrad.  The latter looked at it in amazement.  “Why, you are an artist,” he said. “I had no idea you were capable of such work.”  “I am glad you like it,” said Chester, much pleased.  “How long have you been drawing?”  “Ever since I can remember. I used to make pictures in school on my slate. Some of them got me into trouble with the teacher.”  “I can imagine it, if you caricatured him. Did you ever take lessons?”  “No; there was no one in Wyncombe to teach me. But I got hold of a drawing book once, and that helped me.”  “Do you know what I am going to do with this sketch of yours?”  Chester looked an inquiry.  “I will take it to New York with me, and see if I can dispose of it.”  “I am afraid it won’t be of much use, Mr. Conrad. I am only a boy.”  “If a sketch is good, it doesn’t matter how old or young an artist is.”  “I should like very much to get something for it. Even fifty cents would be acceptable.”  “You hold your talent cheap, Chester,” said Mr. Conrad, with a smile. “I shall certainly ask more than that for it, as I don’t approve of cheapening artistic labor.”  The rest of the evening passed pleasantly.  When Chester rose to go, Mr. Conrad said:  “Take these papers, Chester. You can study them at your leisure, and if any happy thoughts or brilliant ideas come to you, dash them off and send them to me. I might do something with them.”  “Thank you, sir. What is your address?”  “Number one ninety-nine West Thirty-fourth Street. Well, good-by. I am glad to have met you. Sometime you may be an artist.”  Chester flushed with pride, and a new hope rose in his breast. He had always enjoyed drawing, but no one had ever encouraged him in it. Even his mother thought of it only as a pleasant diversion for him. As to its bringing him in money, the idea had never occurred to him.  It seemed wonderful, indeed, that a little sketch, the work of half an hour, should bring ten dollars. Why compare with this the hours of toil in a grocery store—seventy, at least—which had been necessary to earn the small sum of three dollars. For the first time Chester began to understand the difference between manual and intelligent labor.  It was ten o’clock when Chester left the minister’s house—a late hour in Wyncombe—and he had nearly reached his own modest home before he met anyone. Then he overtook a man of perhaps thirty, thinly clad and shivering in the bitter, wintry wind. He was a stranger, evidently, for Chester knew everyone in the village, and he was tempted to look back. The young man, encouraged perhaps by this evidence of interest, spoke, hurriedly:  “Do you know,” he asked, “where I can get a bed for the night?”  “Mr. Tripp has a few rooms that he lets to strangers. He is the storekeeper.”  The young man laughed, but there was no merriment in the laugh.  “Oh, yes. I know Silas Tripp,” he said.  “Then you have been in Wyncombe before?”  “I never lived here, but I know Silas Tripp better than I want to. He is my uncle.”  “Your uncle!” exclaimed Chester, in surprise.  “Yes, I am his sister’s son. My name is Walter Bruce.”  “Then I should think your uncle’s house was the place for you.”  “I have no money to pay for a bed.”  “But, if you are a relation——”  “That makes no difference to Silas Tripp. He has no love for poor relations. You don’t know him very well.”  “I ought to, for I have worked for him in the store for a year.”  “I didn’t see you in there this evening.”  “I left him last Saturday evening. There is another boy there now.”  “Why did you leave him?”  “Because he wanted to cut down my wages from three dollars to two dollars and a quarter.”  “Just like uncle Silas. I see you know him.”  “Have you seen him since you came to Wyncombe?”  “I was in the store this evening.”  “Did you make yourself known to him?”  “Yes.”  “Didn’t he invite you to spend the night in the house?”  “Not he. He saw by my dress that I was poor, and gave me a lecture on my shiftless ways.”  “Still he might have taken care of you for one night.”  “He wouldn’t. He told me he washed his hands of me.”  Chester looked sober. He was shocked by Silas Tripp’s want of humanity.  “You asked me where you could find a bed,” he said. “Come home with me, and I can promise you shelter for one night, at least.”  “Thank you, boy,” said Bruce, grasping Chester’s hand. “You have a heart. But—perhaps your parents might object.”  “I have no father. My mother is always ready to do a kind act.”  “Then I will accept your kind offer. I feared I should have to stay out all night.”  “And without an overcoat,” said Chester, compassionately.  “Yes, I had to part with my overcoat long since. I could not afford such a luxury. I suppose you understand!”  “You sold it?”  “No, I pawned it. I didn’t get much for it—only three dollars, but it would be as easy for me to take the church and move it across the street as to redeem it.”  “You appear to have been unfortunate.”  “Yes. Fortune and I are at odds. Yet I ought to have some money.”  “How’s that?”  “When my mother died uncle Silas acted as executor of her estate. It was always supposed that she had some money—probably from two to three thousand dollars—but when uncle Silas rendered in his account it had dwindled to one hundred and twenty-five dollars. Of course that didn’t last me long.”  “Do you think that he acted wrongfully?” asked Chester, startled.  “Do I think so? I have no doubt of it. You know money is his god.”  “Yet to cheat his own nephew would be so base.”  “Is there anything too base for such a man to do to get money?”  The young man spoke bitterly.  By this time they had reached Chester’s home. His mother was still up. She looked up in surprise at her son’s companion.  “Mother,” said Chester, “this is Mr. Bruce. Do you think we can give him a bed?”  “Why, certainly,” replied Mrs. Rand, cordially. “Have you had supper, sir?”  “I wouldn’t like to trouble you, ma’am.”  “It will be no trouble. I can make some tea in five minutes. Chester, take out the bread and butter and cold meat from the closet.”  So before he went to bed the homeless wayfarer was provided with a warm meal, and the world seemed brighter and more cheerful to him.     CHAPTER IV.  A DYING GIFT.   In the morning Walter Bruce came down to breakfast looking pale and sick. He had taken a severe cold from scanty clothing and exposure to the winter weather.  “You have a hard cough, Mr. Bruce,” said Mrs. Rand, in a tone of sympathy.  “Yes, madam; my lungs were always sensitive.”  When breakfast was over he took his hat and prepared to go.  “I thank you very much for your kind hospitality,” he began. Then he was attacked by a fit of coughing.  “Where are you going. Mr. Bruce?” asked Chester.  “I don’t know,” he answered, despondently. “I came to Wyncombe to see my uncle Silas, but he will have nothing to say to me.”  Chester and his mother exchanged looks. The same thought was in the mind of each.  “Stay with us a day or two,” said Mrs. Rand. “You are not fit to travel. You need rest and care.”  “But I shall be giving you a great deal of trouble.”  “We shall not consider it such,” said Mrs. Rand.  “Then I will accept your kind offer, for indeed I am very unwell.”  Before the end of the day the young man was obliged to go to bed, and a doctor was summoned. Bruce was pronounced to have a low fever, and to be quite unfit to travel.  Mrs. Rand and Chester began to feel anxious. Their hearts were filled with pity for the young man, but how could they bear the expense which this sickness would entail upon them?  “Silas Tripp is his uncle,” said Mrs. Rand. “He ought to contribute the expense of his sickness.”  “I will go and see him,” said Chester. So he selected a time when business would be slack in the store, and called in. He found Mr. Trip in a peevish mood.  “How are you, Chester?” he said. “I wish you was back.”  “Why, Mr. Tripp? You’ve got Abel Wood in my place.”  “He ain’t of much account,” grumbled Silas. “What do you think he done this mornin’?”  “I don’t know, sir.”  “He smashed two dozen eggs, and eggs twenty-two cents a dozen. But I’ll take it out of his salary. He’s dreadful awkward, that boy!”  “Poor Abel!” thought Chester. “I am afraid he won’t have much salary coming to him at the end of the week.”  “You never broke no eggs while you was here, Chester.”  “No; I don’t think I did.”  “You’d ought to have stayed.”  “I couldn’t stay on the salary you offered. But, Mr. Tripp, I’ve come here on business.”  “Hey? What about?”  “Your nephew, Walter Bruce, is staying at our house.”  “Is he?” returned Silas Tripp, indifferently.  “And he is sick.”  “I don’t feel no interest in him,” said Silas, doggedly.  “Are you willing to pay his expenses? He has no money.”  “No, I ain’t,” snarled Silas. “Ef you take him you take him at your own risk.”  “You wouldn’t have us turn him into the street?” said Chester, indignantly.  “You can do as you like. It ain’t no affair of mine. I s’pose he sent you here.”  “No, he didn’t; and I wouldn’t have come if we had been better fixed. But we haven’t enough money to live on ourselves.”  “Then tell him to go away. I never wanted him to come to Wyncombe.”  “It seems to me you ought to do something for your own nephew.”  “I can’t support all my relations, and I won’t,” said Silas, testily. “It ain’t no"]]]
