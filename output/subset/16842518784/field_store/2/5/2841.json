The following pieces may be of any soft wood:    5 drawer slides, 3/4 by 2 by 17 in.   6 drawer sides, 1/2 by 7 by 17 in.   2 drawer bottoms, 1/2 by 17 by 17 in.   1 drawer bottom, 1/2 by 17 by 35-1/2 in.   4-1/2 sq. ft. of 3/8-in. pine for back.  First be sure the posts are perfectly square and of equal length. Either chamfer or round the upper ends as desired. The mortises can now be laid out and cut or they can be left until the rail tenons are all made and then marked and cut directly from each tenon. The posts as well as the end rails should have grooves cut in them to take the 1/4-in. end panels.  The top board should have the corners cut to fit about the posts. The corners of the back board should be rounded as shown in the drawing.  The end sections of the dresser can be glued together first, care being taken to get the joints square and tight. When these are dry the side rails and drawer slides can be fitted and glued in place. The top board is held in position by means of screws through cleats which are fastened to the inner sides of the rails.  [Illustration: Detail of the Princess Dresser]  The mirror frame is made by mortising the end pieces with the side pieces as shown. It is rabbeted on the back to hold a 20 by 38-in. mirror. After the mirror is securely fastened in the frame a thin wood covering should be tacked on the back to protect the glass. The frame swings between two upright posts which are securely fastened to the body of the dresser as shown.  The drawers are made and fitted in the usual manner. The drawing shows two drawers in the top compartment, but one exactly like the lower can be made and used instead by simply leaving out the 1 in. partition. Suitable handles for the drawers can be purchased at any hardware store.  The back is made of soft wood and is put on in the usual manner. Scrape all surplus glue from about the joints as the stain will not take where there is any glue. Finish smooth with fine sandpaper and apply the stain desired, which may be any of the many mission stains supplied by the trade for this purpose.     A SEWING BOX   A rather unique sewing box, and one that is quite as convenient as unique, is shown in the illustration. The material is walnut and ash. The posts are walnut and the slats and top rail ash. Both are finished in their natural colors. The following is the stock bill:     4 posts, 1-1/2 in. in diameter and 15 in. long, walnut.    1 bottom, 3/8 by 16-1/2 by 16-1/2 in., S-2-S, walnut.    4 top rails, 3/8 by 1-1/2 by 20 in., S-2-S, ash.    4 under rails, 5/8 by 3/4 by 20 in., S-2-S, walnut.   72 slats, 1/8 by 5/8 by 6-1/2 in., S-2-S, ash.  In ordering the stock it will be wise to combine the lengths of pieces having like widths and thicknesses.  If not possible to secure doweling of the diameter indicated for the verticals, it is an easy matter to take a square piece of stock, lay it off and work it into an eight-sided prism. After this, the arrises may again be planed until it has 16 and then 32 sides. The rest may be removed with sandpaper. Or it is possible that curtain pole stock will be available. Saw these posts to length and leave the ends square.  [Illustration: Sewing Box Made of Walnut and Ash]  Square up the stock for the other parts. Work the bottom piece to a 16-in. square. The rails are not to be squared on the ends but are to be mitered each in turn. The bottom is fastened to the posts by metal brackets.  [Illustration: Detail of the Sewing Box]  Chisel out recesses in the posts so that the bottom may be inserted. Insert the corners and use glue and nails to hold them in place. Place the lower of the two top rails, notching out the posts as is necessary to bring the inner edge of these rails in position. Fasten to the posts. Miter and place the top rails. The slats, it will be noted, are fastened to the bottom from the outer side and to the lower of the two top rails from the inner side. Brass-headed tacks such as upholsterers use are required.  In finishing, sandpaper all parts and then apply a coat of boiled linseed oil. Allow this to stand a half hour or so and then wipe the surface clean. After this has dried thoroughly apply a thin coating of shellac and allow it to harden. Sand the shellac when hard with No. 00 sandpaper and then apply several coats of wax, polishing in the usual manner.  Two pairs of castors will add to the ease with which the box may be moved about.     A FERN STAND   When making the fern stand shown in the accompanying sketch use quarter-sawed oak if possible, as this wood is the most suitable for finishing in the different mission stains. Considerable labor can be saved in its construction by ordering the stock from the mill ready cut to length, squared and sanded. Order the following pieces:     4 posts, 1-1/2 by 1-1/2 by 30 in., S-4-S.    8 side rails, 3/4 by 1-1/2 by 13-1/2 in., S-4-S.    2 shelf supports, 3/4 by 1 by 13-1/2 in., S-4-S.    1 top, 3/4 by 16 by 16 in., S-4-S.    1 shelf, 3/4 by 15 by 15 in., S-4-S.   16 slats, 3/8 by 3 by 5 in., S-4-S.  The legs are made first. Be sure they are square and of equal length. The mortises can be laid out and cut or they can be left until the tenons on the side rails are all made, then marked and cut from each tenon. The top rails and the slats are exactly alike for the four sides, as the table is square. In addition to the tenons on the rails, grooves should be cut in each for the ends of the slats to fit into as shown in the cross section in the detail drawing. Holes should be cut in the slats as shown.  [Illustration: Detail of the Fern Stand]  The top board should have the corners cut out to fit around the posts. It is held in place by means of screws through cleats which are fastened to the inner sides of the top rails.  The bottom board or shelf rests upon two rails that are mortised into the posts as shown. The top and bottom boards should be of one piece if possible, otherwise two or more boards will have to be glued together.  Before gluing up the joints see that all the pieces fit together square and tight. The posts and rails should be glued and assembled, then the top and bottom boards put in place to hold the frame square when the clamps are put on.  [Illustration: Finished Stand in Quartered Oak]  Leave to dry for about 24 hours before removing the clamps. Fasten the top and bottom boards in place and then go over the stand with fine sandpaper and remove all surplus glue and rough spots.     A WARDROBE   The wardrobe or clothes closet shown in the accompanying sketch and detail drawing will be found a great convenience in a bedroom where closet space is limited or where there is no closet at all. It provides ample room for hanging suits, dresses and other wearing apparel, as well as space for boots and shoes. It can be made of any of the several furniture woods in common use, but quarter-sawed oak will be found to give the most pleasing effect. The stock should be ordered from the mill ready cut to length, squared and sanded. In this way much labor will be saved. The following pieces will be needed:    4 posts, 1-3/4 by 1-3/4 by 64-1/2 in., S-4-S.   2 front rails, 3/4 by 1-1/2 by 37-1/2 in., S-4-S.   1 top and 1 bottom board, each 3/4 by 18-1/2 by 37 in., S-4-S.   1 top back rail, 3/4 by 4-1/4 by 37-1/2 in., S-4-S.   1 lower back rail, 3/4 by 4 by 37-1/2 in., S-4-S.   6 end rails, 3/4 by 6 by 18-1/2 in., S-4-S.   4 end uprights, 3/4 by 4 by 22-1/2 in., S-4-S.   8 end panels, 3/8 by 7-1/2 by 22-1/2 in., S-4-S.   5 shelves, 3/4 by 17-3/4 by 19-1/2 in., S-4-S.   2 drawer fronts, 3/4 by 4-3/4 by 8-1/2 in., S-4-S.   1 door, 3/4 by 7-3/4 by 10 in., S-4-S.   1 shelf partition, 3/4 by 10 by 19 in., S-4-S.   2 drawer fronts, 3/4 by 7 by 17 in., S-4-S.   1 drawer front, 3/4 by 8 by 17 in., S-4-S.   1 partition (several pieces), 3/4 by 19-1/2 by 57-3/4 in., S-4-S.   4 door uprights, 3/4 by 2-1/2 by 57 in., S-4-S.   2 top rails, 3/4 by 3-1/2 by 14-1/2 in., S-4-S.   2 middle rails, 3/4 by 6 by 14-1/2 in., S-4-S.   2 lower rails, 3/4 by 4-1/2 by 14-1/2 in., S-4-S.   4 center uprights, 3/4 by 2-1/2 by 23 in., S-4-S.   8 panels, 3/8 by 6 by 22-1/2 in., S-4-S.   4 pieces, 3/8 by 4-3/4 by 19 in., soft wood.   2 pieces, 3/8 by 8 by 19 in., soft wood.   2 pieces, 3/8 by 4-1/4 by 8 in., soft wood.   4 pieces, 1/2 by 7 by 19 in., soft wood.   3 pieces, 1/2 by 16-1/2 by 19 in., soft wood.   2 pieces, 1/2 by 6-1/2 by 16-1/2 in., soft wood.   2 pieces, 1/2 by 8 by 19 in., soft wood.   1 piece, 1/2 by 7-1/2 by 16-1/2 in., soft wood.   1 back (several pieces), 3/8 by 36 by 58 in., S-2-S.  [Illustration: The Wardrobe Complete]  First be sure the posts are perfectly square and of equal length. The upper ends can be chamfered or rounded if desired. The two front posts are alike, as are the back ones. The mortises should be laid out in each pair of posts and then cut with a sharp chisel, or they can be left until the tenons are all made, and then marked and cut from each tenon. Grooves should be cut on one side of all the posts to take the end panels.  The front and lower back rails are plain except for the tenons at each end, but the end rails and the center uprights should have grooves cut for the panels the same as the posts. The top back rail serves as a top back board and should have the corners rounded as shown in the detail drawing.  The frame can now be assembled. Glue should be used on all the joints as it makes them much stiffer.

The top and bottom boards should have the corners cut to clear the posts. The closet is divided into two compartments by a partition. This can be made of plain boards or panels similar to those in the ends, as desired. Place the shelves in position as shown. They are held in place by means of cleats and screws. The one shelf has a partition in its center with a door on one side and two small drawers on the other. Drawers should be fitted to three of the other compartments. They are made in the usual manner except that the front boards should be cut out at the top for a handhold as shown.  The doors are fitted by a tenon and mortise joint at the ends. They have a centerpiece and panels to match the ends of the closet. Suitable hinges and a catch should be supplied. These can be purchased at any hardware store.  [Illustration: Detail of the Wardrobe]  The backing is put on in the usual manner. It should be finished on the front side.  When complete, the closet should be carefully gone over with fine sandpaper and all glue and rough spots removed. Apply stain of the desired color. This may be any of the many mission stains supplied by the trade for this purpose.     A FINISH   An appropriate finish is obtained as follows: First thoroughly scrape and sandpaper the various parts, then apply a coat of brown Flemish water stain. Allow this to dry well, then sand it lightly with No. 00 sandpaper to lay the grain. Again apply the Flemish stain, but this time have it weakened by the addition of an equal amount of water. When dry, sand again as on the first coat. Upon the second coat of stain apply a thin coat of shellac. This is to protect the high lights from the stain in the filler which is to follow. Sand lightly, then apply a paste filler of a sufficiently dark shade to make a dark field for the brown Flemish. Clean off the surplus and polish in the usual manner.  Upon the filler, after it has hardened overnight, apply a coat of orange shellac. Successively apply several coats of some good rubbing varnish. Polish the first coats with haircloth or curled hair, and the last with pulverized pumice stone, mixed with raw linseed or crude oil.     AN OAK TABLE   The accompanying illustration shows another style of a mission table. The stock for this table if ordered as follows and sanded will require only the work of making the joints and putting them together:    4 posts, 2 in, square 30-5/8 in., S-4-S.   4 upper rails, 7/8 by 6-1/2 by 22-1/2 in., S-2-S.   2 lower rails, 7/8 by 3 by 22-1/2 in., S-2-S.   2 top pieces, 7/8 by 12-1/2 by 24-1/2 in., S-2-S.   6 slats, 3/8 by 3-1/2 by 15-1/2 in., S-2-S.   1 stretcher, 7/8 by 8-1/2 by 21-1/2 in., S-2-S.  This table may be made with mortise and tenon joints or with dowels as desired. If dowels are used, the upper and lower rails should be made 2 in. shorter than shown in the drawing.  Be sure to get the pieces for the posts with their surfaces square to each other and their ends sawed square off. This will simplify the assembling a great deal. Make the posts exactly the same length, 30-1/2 in., and chamfer a 3/8-in, bevel on their tops.  Square up the four upper rails, 6 by 22 in., marking the working face and edge to work from when laying out the tenons later. Square up the two lower rails, 2-1/2 by 22 in. These must be exactly the same length as the upper rails. The two ends of the table having the slats should be glued up first. Lay out the tenons on the upper and lower rails for these two ends and be sure to work from the marked face and edges, using a knife line. Cut the tenons, and, by placing them against the posts in the exact position they are to occupy, mark the places for the mortises. These joints should be numbered so that each mortise may be cut to fit its own tenon.  [Illustration: Detail of Construction Finished Table]  Square up the slats, 3 by 15-1/8 in., and cut mortises in the upper and lower rails 1/4 in. deep to let them in. The number of these slats, their size and spacing may be arranged to suit one's own idea. Put the posts, upper and lower rails, and slats together without glue first to determine if the parts fit properly, and then glue and clamp them together. Hot glue will hold best, if the room and lumber are warm; if not, it is best to use ordinary liquid glue. While the glue on these two ends of the table is setting, the other upper rails, top, and stretcher may be finished.  The top will have to be made of two or three pieces joined together with dowels and glue. If possible, use only two boards and be sure the grain in both pieces runs the same way when they are put together.  After the ends which were glued have set at least 24 hours, the clamps may be taken off and the other two upper rails tenoned and mortised in place. The stretcher may be held with two 3/8-in. dowels in each end, or with two round-head screws put through the lower rails. When gluing up the whole table, be sure the sides are square to each other. The top may now be squared up 24 by 24 in. and the corners cut out for the top of the posts. The top may be fastened as shown at A and B in the drawing, or by cleats screwed to the inside of the upper rails and top.  Before staining, be sure that all surplus glue is scraped off and the surfaces sanded clean. A weathered or fumed oak stain is suitable for this table. A good weathered oak stain may be made by mixing a little drop black ground in oil with turpentine and a little linseed oil. Put this stain on with a brush and allow to stand until it begins to flatten or dull, then rub off across the grain with a rag or piece of cotton waste. When thoroughly dry, apply one coat of very thin shellac. After this has dried, finish with two coats of wax. The shellac prevents the turpentine in the wax from rubbing out the stain. To get a good wax finish the work should dry until it will not show finger marks, before rubbing.     BOOK TROUGH   [Illustration: Detail of Book Trough]  A very cheap but attractive book trough is shown in the accompanying photograph. This piece of mission furniture will be found useful in the home or office and can be made by anyone who has a slight knowledge of tools. The material should be either oak or chestnut, which can be secured from the planing mill dressed and sandpapered ready to cut the tenons and mortises. The stock needed will be as follows:    2 ends, 7/8 in. by 10 in. by 31 in., S-2-S.   1 shelf, 7/8 in. by 10 in. by 35 in., S-1-S.   2 trough pieces, 7/8 in. by 4 in. by 35 in., S-2-S.   8 keys, 5/8 in. by 5/8 in. by 3 in.  [Illustration: Book Trough Complete]  The two end pieces should be made first with the top corners rounded off and the lower end, which is of simple design, can be cut out with a bracket saw and smoothed with a wood rasp. The mortises should then be laid out according to the sketch and cut, by first boring 3/4-in. holes and finishing with a chisel, being careful to keep all edges clean and free from slivers.  The shelf can now be made by cutting a double-key tenon at each end to fit the end pieces. The space between the two tenons at each end can be cut out with a bracket saw and finished with a rasp. The key holes should be mortised as shown in the sketch. The trough pieces are made in a similar manner, care being taken to have all tenons and mortises perfectly square and a good fit, so the trough when assembled will have a neat and workmanlike appearance. The trough can be finished in any one of the many mission finishes which are supplied by the trade for this purpose.     AN OAK SERVING TABLE   The serving table is another useful piece of furniture that can be made in mission style. This table should be made in quarter-sawed oak and stained very light. The stock order is as follows:    2 posts, 2 by 2 by 37 in., S-4-S.   2 posts, 2 by 2 by 31 in., S-4-S.   1 top, 1 by 21 by 40 in., S-2-S.   2 side rails, 3/4 by 3 by 34-1/2 in., S-2-S.   4 end rails, 3/4 by 3 by 15-1/2 in., S-2-S.   1 back panel, 3/4 by 4 by 34-1/2 in., S-2-S.   1 stretcher, 1 by 5 by 36-1/2 in., S-4-S.   1 slat, 1/2 by 1-1/2 by 36 in., S-4-S.  [Illustration: Serving Table Complete]  The four posts are ordered 1 in. longer than necessary for squaring to length and the two back posts should be chamfered 1/4 in. on top, as they are the longest and project above the back panel. All of the posts are cut tapering for a space of 4 in. from the bottom ends. Mortises in the posts and tenons on the rails are laid out and cut as shown by the dimensions in the drawing. These parts are then well glued and put together. The top, which should be of well seasoned wood, is cut to fit around the back posts so the back edge and the back side of the posts are flush. The back panel is placed in mortises cut in the corners of the back posts. This is done so the back surface of the panel will be flush the same as the edge of the top. The slat is fastened with round-headed brass screws on the front of the two back posts about half way between the top and the ends of the posts.  [Illustration: Detail of Serving Table]  The top may be fastened to the rails by one of two methods. One way is to use a small button made of wood and so mortised as to set in the rails and then fastened to the top with screws. About six of these buttons will be sufficient to hold the top in place. The other method is to bore a hole slanting on the inside of the rails, directing the bit toward the top, which will make a seat--if not cut too deep--for a screw that can be turned direct into the top.  The glue must be removed from about the joints and the surfaces smoothed over with fine sandpaper before applying the stain. The directions for staining will be found on the can in which it is sold. The grain of the wood will show up well if the surface is given a dull waxed finish after staining.     AN UMBRELLA STAND   [Illustration]  The umbrella stand shown"]]]
