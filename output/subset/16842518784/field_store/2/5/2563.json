It don't seem natural to him that one of your color should consort so freely with us.\"  Dick's face flushed through the brown, and he shot an angry glance at Conway, but Bright Sun did not seem to be offended.  \"Why not?\" he asked in perfect English.  \"I was educated in a mission school.  I have been with white people most of my life, I have read your books, I know your civilization, and I like it.\"  \"There now!\" exclaimed Conway triumphantly.  \"Ain't that an answer for you?  I tell you what, Bright Sun, I'm for you, I believe in you, and if anybody can take us through all right to California, you're the man.\"  \"It is my task and I will accomplish it,\" said Bright Sun in the precise English he had learned at the mission school.  His eyes met Dick's for a moment, and the boy saw there a flash that might mean many things--defiance, primeval force, and the quality that plans and does.  But the flash was gone in an instant, like a dying spark, and Bright Sun turned away.  Conway also left, but Dick's gaze followed the Indian.  He did not know Bright Sun's tribe.  He had heard that he was a Sioux, also that he was a Crow, and a third report credited him with being a Cheyenne.  As he never painted his face, dressed like a white man, and did not talk of himself and his people, the curious were free to surmise as they chose.  But Dick was sure of one thing: Bright Sun was a man of power.  It was not a matter of surmise, he felt it instinctively.  The tall figure of the Indian was lost among the wagons, and Dick turned his attention to the trail.  The cooling waves continued to roll up, as the west reddened into a brilliant sunset.  Great bars of crimson, then of gold, and the shades in between, piled above one another on the horizon.  The plains lost their brown, and gleamed in wonderful shimmering tints.  The great desolate world became beautiful.  The train stopped with a rumble, a creak, and a lurch, and the men began to unharness the animals.  Albert awoke with a start and sat up in the wagon.  \"Night and the camp, Al,\" said Dick cheerfully; \"feel better, don't you?  \"Yes, I do,\" replied Albert, as a faint color came into his face.  \"Thought the rest and the coolness would brace you up,\" continued Dick in the same cheerful tone.  Albert, a tall, emaciated boy with a face of great refinement and delicacy, climbed out of the wagon and looked about.  Dick busied himself with the work of making camp, letting Albert give what help he could.  But Dick always undertook to do enough for two--his brother and himself--and he really did enough for three.  No other was so swift and skillful at taking the gear off horse or mule, nor was there a stronger or readier arm at the wheel when it was necessary to complete the circle of wagons that they nightly made.  When this was done, he went out on the prairie in search of buffalo chips for the fire, which he was fortunate enough to find without any trouble.  Before returning with his burden, Dick stood a few moments looking back at the camp.  The dusk had fully come, but the fires were not yet lighted, and he saw only the shadowy forms of the wagons and flitting figures about them.  But much talked reached his ears, most of it coarse and rough, with a liberal sprinkling of oaths.  Dick sighed.  His regret was keener than ever that Albert and he were in such company.  Then he looked the other way out upon the fathomless plains, where the night had gathered, and the wind was moaning among the swells.  The air was now chill enough to make him shiver, and he gazed with certain awe into the black depths.  The camp, even with all its coarseness and roughness, was better, and he walked swiftly back with his load of fuel.  They built a dozen fires within the circle of the wagons, and again Dick was the most active and industrious of them all, doing his share, Albert's, and something besides.  When the fires were lighted they burned rapidly and merrily, sending up great tongues of red or yellow flame, which shed a flickering light over wagons, animals, and men.  A pleasant heat was suffused and Dick began to cook supper for Albert and himself, bringing it from the wagon in which his brother and he had a share.  He fried bacon and strips of dried beef, boiled coffee, and warmed slices of bread over the coals.  He saw with intense pleasure that Albert ate with a better appetite than he had shown for days.  As for himself, he was as hungry as a horse--he always was on this great journey--and since there was plenty, he ate long, and was happy.  Dick went to the wagon, and returned with a heavy cloak, which he threw over Albert's shoulders.  \"The night's getting colder,\" he said, \"and you mustn't take any risks, Al.  There's one trouble about a camp fire in the open--your face can burn while your back freezes.\"  Content fell over the camp.  Even rough men of savage instincts are willing to lie quiet when they are warm and well fed.  Jokes, coarse but invariably in good humor, were exchanged.  The fires still burned brightly, and the camp formed a core of light and warmth in the dark, cold wilderness.  Albert, wrapped in the cloak, lay upon his side and elbow gazing dreamily into the flames.  Dick sat near him, frying a piece of bacon on the end of a stick.  Neither heard the step behind them because it was noiseless, but both saw the tall figure of Bright Sun, as he came up to their fire.  \"Have a piece of bacon, Bright Sun,\" said Dick hospitably, holding out the slice to him, and at the same time wondering whether the Indian would take it.  Bright Sun shook his head.  \"I thank you,\" he replied, \"but I have eaten enough.  How is Mr. Albert Howard now?\"  Dick appreciated the inquiry, whether or not it was prompted by sympathy.  \"Good,\" he replied.  \"Al's picking up.  Haven't seen him eat as he did to-night for months.  If he keeps on this way, he'll devour a whole buffalo as soon as he's able to kill one.\"  Bright Sun smiled, and sat down on the ground near them.  It seemed to the boy, a keen observer of his kind, that he wished to talk.  Dick was willing.  \"Do you know,\"  asked Bright Sun, \"that reports of gold in the region to the north, called by you the Black Hills, have come to us?\"  \"I heard some one speak of it two or three days ago,\" replied Dick, \"but I paid no attention to it.\"  Bright Sun looked thoughtfully into the fire, the glow of which fell full upon his face, revealing every feature like carving. His nose was hooked slightly, and to Dick it now looked like the beak of an eagle.  The somber eyes, too, expressed brooding and mastery alike.  Despite himself, Dick felt again that he was in the presence of power, and he was oppressed by a sense of foreboding.  \"It was worth attention,\" said Bright Sun in the slow, precise tones of one who speaks a language not his own, but who speaks it perfectly.  \"The white man's gold is calling to him loudly.  It calls all through the day and night.  Do these men with whom you travel go to anything certain far over on the coast of the Western ocean?  No, they are leaves blown by the wind.  The wind now blows in the direction of the Black Hills, where the gold is said to be, and to-morrow the wagon train turns its head that way.\"  Dick sat up straight, and Albert, wrapped in his blanket, leaned forward to listen.  \"But the engagement with us all,\" said Dick, \"was to go to the Pacific.  Albert and I paid our share for that purpose.  Conway knows it.\"  The Indian looked at Dick.  The boy thought he saw a flickering smile of amusement in his eyes, but it was faint, and gone in a moment.  \"Conway does not care for that,\" said the Indian.  \"Your contracts are nothing to him.  This is the wilderness, and it stretches away for many hundreds of miles in every direction. The white man's law does not come here.  Moreover, nearly all wish him to turn to the North and the gold.\"  Albert suddenly spoke, and his tone, though thin from physical weakness, was quick, intense, and eager.  \"Why couldn't we go on with them, Dick?\"  he said.  \"We have nothing definite on the Pacific coast.  We are merely taking chances, and if the Black Hills are full of gold, we might get our share!\"  Dick's eyes glistened.  If one had to go, one might make the best of it.  The spirit of romance was alive within him.  He was only a boy.  \"Of course we'll go, Al,\" he said lightly, \"and you and I will have a tone of gold inside a year.\"  Bright Sun looked at the two boys, first one and then the other, stalwart Dick and weak Albert.  It seemed to Dick that he saw a new expression in the Indian's eyes, one that indicated the shadow of regret.  He resented it.  Did Bright Sun think that Albert and he were not equal to the task?  \"I am strong,\" he said; \"I can lift and dig enough for two; but Albert will also be strong, after we have been a little while in the mountains.\"  \"You might have strength enough.  I do not doubt it,\" said Bright Sun softly, \"but the Black Hills are claimed by the Sioux.  They do not wish the white men to come there, and the Sioux are a great and powerful tribe, or rather a nation of several allied and kindred tribes, the most powerful Indian nation west of the Mississippi.\"  Bright Sun's voice rose a little toward the last, and the slight upward tendency gave emphasis and significance to his words.  The brooding eyes suddenly shot forth a challenging light.  \"Are you a Sioux?\" asked Dick involuntarily.  Bright Sun bent upon him a look of gentle reproof.  \"Since I have taken the ways of your race I have no tribe,\" he replied.  \"But, as I have said, the Sioux claim the Black Hills, and they have many thousands of warriors, brave, warlike, and resolved to keep the country.\"  \"The government will see that there is no war,\" said Dick.  \"Governments can do little in a wilderness,\" replied Bright Sun.  Dick might have made a rejoinder, but at that moment a burly figure"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22464"],["title","The Last of the Chiefs: A Story of the Great Sioux War (#2)"],["body","into the light of the fire.  It was Sam Conway, and he glanced suspiciously at the Indian and the two boys.  \"Are you telling 'em, Bright Sun, when we'll reach California?\" he asked.  Bright Sun gave him an oblique glance.  The Indian seldom looks the white man in the face, but it was obvious that Bright Sun was not afraid of the leader.  Conway, as well as the others, knew it.  \"No,\" he replied briefly.  \"It's just as well that you haven't,\" said Conway briskly, \"'cause we're not going to California at all--at least not this year. It's the wish and general consensus of this here train that we turn to the North, go into the Black Hills, and fill our wagons with gold.\"  \"So it's decided, then, is it?\" asked Dick.  \"Yes, it's decided,\" replied Conway, his tone now becoming positively brutal, \"and if you and your brother don't like it, you know what you can do.\"  \"Keep on alone for the coast, I suppose,\" said Dick, looking him steadily in the face.  \"If you put it that way.\"  \"But we don't choose,\" said Dick, \"Al and I have an interest in one wagon and team, and we're going to hold on to it.  Besides, we're quite willing to try our luck in the Black Hills, too. We're going with you.\"  Conway frowned, but Dick also was not afraid of him, and knew that he could not turn the two boys out on the prairie.  They had a full right to go with the train.  \"That settles it,\" he said, turning away.  \"You can do as you please, but what happens after we get into the Black Hills is another thing.  Likely, we'll scatter.\"  The sound of his retreating footsteps quickly died away in the darkness, and Bright Sun, too, slid among the shadows.  He was gone so quickly and quietly that it gave Dick an uncanny feeling.  \"What do you make of it, Al?\" he asked his brother.  \"What does Bright Sun mean by what he said to us?\"  The glow of the flame fell across Albert's pale face, and, by the light of it, Dick saw that he was very thoughtful.  He seemed to be looking over and beyond the fire and the dark prairie, into time rather than space.  \"I think it was a warning, Dick,\" replied Albert at last.  \"Maybe Bright Sun intended it for only you and me.  But I want to go up there in the Black Hills, Dick.\"  \"And so do I.  It'll be easier for you, Al, than the trip across the continent.  When you are a mile and a half or two miles above the sea, you'll begin to take on flesh like a bear in summer. Besides, the gold, Al! think of the gold!\"  Albert smiled.  He, too, was having happy thoughts.  The warm glow of the fire clothed him and he was breathing easily and peacefully.  By and by he sank down in his blanket and fell into a sound sleep.  Dick himself did not yet have any thought of slumber.  Wide-awake visions were pursuing one another through his brain.  He saw the mountains, dark and shaggy with pine forests, the thin, healing air over them, and the beds of gold in their bosom, with Albert and himself discovering and triumphant.  The fire died down, and glowed a mass of red embers.  The talk sank.  Most of the men were asleep, either in their blankets or in the wagons.  The darkness thickened and deepened and came close up to the fires, a circling rim of blackness.  But Dick was still wakeful, dreaming with wide-open eyes his golden dreams.  As the visions followed one after another, a shadow which was not a part of any of them seemed to Dick to melt into the uttermost darkness beyond the fires.  A trace of something familiar in the figure impressed him, and, rising, he followed swiftly.  The figure, still nebulous and noiseless, went on in the darkness, and another like it seemed to rise from the plain and join it.  Then they were lost to the sight of the pursuer, seeming to melt into and become a part of the surrounding darkness.  Dick, perplexed and uneasy, returned to the fire.  The second shadow must certainly have been that of a stranger.  What did it mean?  He resumed his seat before the red glow, clasping his arms around his knees, a splendid, resourceful youth whom nature and a hardy life had combined to make what he was.  His brother still slept soundly and peacefully, but the procession of golden visions did not pass again through Dick's brain; instead, it was a long trail of clouds, dark and threatening.  He sought again and again to conjure the clouds away and bring back the golden dreams, but he could not.  The fire fell to nothing, the triumphant darkness swept up and blotted out the last core of light, the wind, edged with ice, blew in from the plains.  Dick shivered, drew a heavy blanket around his own shoulders, and moved a little, as he saw the dim figure of Bright Sun passing at the far edge of the wagons, but quickly relapsed into stillness.  Sleep at last pulled down his troubled lids.  His figure sank, and, head on arms, he slumbered soundly.     Chapter II King Bison  \"Up! Up, everybody!\" was the shout that reached Dick's sleeping ears.  He sprang to his feet and found that the gorgeous sun was flooding the prairie with light.  Already the high, brilliant skies of the Great West were arching over him.  Men were cooking breakfast.  Teamsters were cracking their whips and the whole camp was alive with a gay and cheerful spirit.  Everybody seemed to know now that they were going for the gold, and, like Dick, they had found it in fancy already.  Breakfast over, the train took up its march, turning at a right angle from its old course and now advancing almost due north. But this start was made with uncommon alacrity and zeal.  There were no sluggards now.  They, too, had golden visions, and, as if to encourage them, the aspect of the country soon began to change, and rapidly to grow better.  The clouds of dust that they raised were thinner.  The bunch grass grew thicker. Off on the crest of a swell a moving figure was seen now and then. \"Antelope,\" said the hunters.  Once they passed a slow creek. The water was muddy, but it contained no alkali, and animals and men drank eagerly.  Cottonwoods, the first trees they had seen in days, grew on either side of the stream, and they rested there awhile in the shade, because the sun was now out in full splendor, and the vast plains shimmered in the heat.  Albert resumed his place in the wagon.  Dick had a horse which, on becoming foot-sore, had been allowed to rest for a few days, and was now well.  He mounted it and galloped on ahead.  The clouds were all gone away and the golden visions had come back. He felt so strong, so young, and the wonderful air of the plains was such a tonic that he urged his horse to a gallop, and it was hard for him to keep from shouting aloud in joy.   He looked eagerly into the north, striving already for a sight of the dark mountains that men called the Black Hills.  The blue gave back nothing but its own blue.  His horse seemed to share his spirits, and swung along with swift and easy stride.  Dick looked back presently, and saw that the train which had been winding like a serpent over the plains was lost to sight behind the swells.  The surface of the earth had become more rolling as they advanced northward, and he knew that the train, though out of sight, was nor far away.  He enjoyed for the moment the complete absence of all human beings save himself.  To be alone then meant anything but loneliness.  He galloped to the crest of a higher swell than usual, and then stopped short.  Far off on the plain he saw tiny moving figures, a dozen or so, and he was sure that they were antelope.  They had seen antelope before at a great distance, but had not bothered about them.  Now the instincts of the hunter rose in Dick, and he resolved to make a trial of his skill.  He found in one of the depressions between the swells a stunted cottonwood, to which he hitched his horse, knowing it would be well hidden there from the observation of the herd.  He then advanced on foot.  He had heard that the antelope was a slave to its own curiosity, and through that weakness he intended to secure his game.  When he had gone about half the distance he sank down on his hands and knees and began to crawl, a laborious and sometimes painful operation, burdened as he was with his rifle, and unused to such methods of locomotion.  Presently he noticed a flutter among the antelope, a raising of timid heads, an alarmed looking in his direction.  But Dick was prepared.  He lay flat upon his face, and dug the point of the long hunting knife that he carried into the ground, while the wind blew out the folds of the red handkerchief which he had tied to the handle.  Mr. Big Buck Antelope, the chief of the herd and a wary veteran, saw the waving red spot on the horizon and his interest was aroused, despite his caution.  What a singular thing!  It must be investigated!  It might be some new kind of food very good for Mr. Big Buck's palate and stomach, and no provident antelope could afford to let such an opportunity pass.  He was trembling all over with curiosity, and perhaps his excitement kept him from seeing the dark shape that blurred with the earth just beyond the red something, or he may have taken it for a shadow.  At any event, his curiosity kept him from paying heed to it, and he began to approach.  His steps were hesitating, and now and then he drew away a little, but that singular red object lured him on, and yard by yard he drew nearer.  He suddenly saw the black shadow beyond the fluttering red object detach itself from the ground, and resolve into a terrible shape.  His heart sprang up in his bosom, and he was about to rush madly away, but it was too late.  A stream of fire shot forth from the dark object and the buck fell, a bullet through him.  Dick prepared the animal for dressing, thinking of the tender, juicy steaks that Albert would enjoy, and then throwing the body across the horse, behind him, rode back to the train, proud of his success.  Conway frowned and said grudging words.  He did not like, he said, for anybody to leave the train without his permission,"]]]
