It didn't look as if he _were_ going to be killed, after all.  \"Important instructions for you,\" the Myrmidon said. \"From the Pontifex Maximus. And not to be repeated to any mortal--understand?\"  Forrester nodded.  \"And that means _any_ mortal,\" the Myrmidon said. \"Girl friend, wife--or don't you Athenans go in for that sort of thing? Now, up at the All-Father's Temple, we--\"  His companion gave him a sharp dig in the ribs.  \"Oh,\" the Myrmidon said. \"Sure. Well. Instructions not to be repeated. Right?\"  \"Right,\" Forrester said.  Instructions? From the Pontifex Maximus? _Secret_ instructions?  Forrester's mind spun dizzily. This was no arrest. This was something very special and unique. He tried once more to imagine what it was going to be, and gave it up in wonder.  The Myrmidon produced another card from his pouch. There was nothing on it but the golden Thunderbolt of the All-Father--but that was quite enough.  Forrester accepted the card dumbly.  \"You will report to the Tower of Zeus at eighteen hundred hours exactly,\" the Myrmidon said. \"Got that?\"  \"You mean today?\" Forrester said, and cursed himself for sounding stupid. But the Myrmidon appeared not to have noticed.  \"Today, sure,\" he said. \"Eighteen hundred. Just present this card.\"  He stepped back, obviously getting ready to leave. Forrester watched him for one long second, and then burst out: \"What do I do after that?\"  \"Just be a good boy. Do what you're told. Ask no questions. It's better that way.\"  Forrester thought of six separate replies and settled on a seventh. \"All right,\" he said.  \"And remember,\" the Myrmidon said, at the outside door, \"don't mention this to anyone. _Not anyone!_\"  The door banged shut.  Forrester found himself staring at the card he held. He put it away in his case, alongside the ID card. Then, dazed, he went on back to the acolyte's sacristy, took off his white tunic and put on his street clothes.  What did they want with him at the Tower of Zeus? It didn't really sound like an arrest. If it had been that, the Myrmidons themselves would have taken him.  So what did the Pontifex Maximus want with William Forrester?  He spent some time considering it, and then, taking a deep breath, he forced it out of his mind. He would know at eighteen hundred, and such were the ways of the Gods that he would not know one second before.  So there was no point in worrying about it, he told himself. He almost made himself believe it.  But wiping speculation out of his mind left an unwelcome and uneasy vacancy. Forrester replaced it with thought of the morning's service in the Temple. Such devotion was probably valuable, anyhow, in a spiritual sense. It brought him closer to the Gods....  The Gods he wanted desperately to be like.  That, he told himself sharply, was foolishness of the most senseless kind.  He blinked it away.  The Goddess Athena had appeared herself at the service--sufficient reason for thinking of it now. The statuesquely beautiful Goddess with her severely swept-back blonde hair and her deep gray eyes was the embodiment of the wisdom and strength for which her worshippers especially prayed. Her beauty was almost unworldly, impossible of existence in a world which contained mortals.  She reminded Forrester, ever so slightly (and, of course, in a reverent way), of Gerda Symes.  There seemed to be a great many forbidden thoughts floating around this day. Resolutely, Forrester went back to thinking about the morning's service.  The Goddess had appeared only long enough to impart her blessing, but her calm, beautifully controlled contralto voice had brought a sense of peace to everyone in the auditorium. To be doggedly practical, there was no way of knowing whether the Goddess's presence was an appearance--in person, or an \"appearance\" by Divine Vision. But that really didn't matter. The effect was always just the same.  Forrester went on out the front portals of the Temple of Wisdom and down the long, wide steps onto Fifth Avenue. He paid homage with a passing glance to the great Owls flanking the entrance. Symbolic of Athena, they had replaced the stone lions which had formerly stood there.  The street was busy with hurrying crowds, enlivened here and there by Temple Myrmidons--from the All-Father, from Bacchus, from Venus--even one from Pallas Athena herself, a broad-beamed swaggerer whom Forrester knew and disliked. The man came striding up the steps, greeted Forrester with a bare nod, and disappeared at top speed into the Temple.  Forrester sighed and glanced south, down toward 34th Street, where the huge Tower of Zeus, a hundred and four stories high, loomed over all the other buildings in the city.  At eighteen hundred he would be in that tower--for what purpose, he had no idea.  Well, that was in the future, and he ...  A voice said: \"Well! Hello, Bill!\"  Forrester turned, knowing exactly what to expect, and disliking it in advance. The bluff over-heartiness of the voice was matched by the gross and hairy figure that confronted him. In some disarray, and managing to look as if he needed simultaneously a bath, a shave, a disinfecting and a purgative, the figure approached Forrester with a rolling walk that was too flat-footed for anything except an elephant.  \"How's the Owl-boy today?\" said the voice, and the body stuck out a flabby, hairy white hand.  Forrester winced. \"I'm fine,\" he said evenly. \"And how's the winebibber?\"  \"Good for you,\" the figure said. \"A little wine for your Stomach's sake, as good old Bacchus always says. Only we make it a lot, eh?\" He winked and nudged Forrester in the ribs.  \"Sure, sure,\" Forrester said. He wished desperately that he could take the gross fool and tear him into tastefully arranged pieces. But there was always Gerda. And since this particular idiot happened to be her younger brother, Ed Symes, anything in the nature of violence was unthinkable.  Gerda's opinion of her brother was touching, reverent, and--Forrester thought savagely--not in the least borne out by any discoverable facts.  And a worshipper of Bacchus! Not that Forrester had anything against the orgiastic rites indulged in by the Dionysians, the Panites, the Apollones or even the worst and wildest of them all, the Venerans. If that was how the Gods wanted to be worshipped, then that was how they should be worshipped.  And, as a matter of fact, it sounded like fun--if, Forrester considered, entirely too public for his taste.  If he preferred the quieter rites of Athena, or of Juno, Diana or Ceres--and even Ceresians became a little wild during the spring fertility rites, especially in the country, where the farmers depended on her for successful crops--well, that was no more than a personal preference.  But the idea of Ed Symes involved in a Bacchic orgy was just a little too much for the normal mind, or the normal stomach.  \"Hey,\" Ed said suddenly. \"Where's Gerda? Still in the Temple?\"  \"I didn't see her,\" Forrester said. There _had_ been a woman who'd looked like her. But that hadn't been Gerda. _She'd_ have waited for him here.  And--  \"Funny,\" Ed said.  \"Why?\" Forrester said. \"I didn't see her. I don't think she attended the service this morning, that's all.\"  He wanted very badly to hit Symes. Just once. But he knew he couldn't.  First of all, there was Gerda. And then, as an acolyte, he was proscribed by law from brawling. No one would hit an acolyte; and if the acolyte were built like Forrester, striking another man might be the equivalent of murder. One good blow from Forrester's fist might break the average man's jaw.  That was, he discovered, a surprisingly pleasant thought. But he made himself keep still as the fat fool went on.  \"Funny she didn't attend,\" Symes said. \"But maybe she's gotten wise to herself. There was a celebration up at the Temple of Pan in Central Park, starting at midnight, and going on through the morning. Spring Rites. Maybe she went there.\"  \"I doubt it,\" Forrester said instantly. \"That's hardly her type of worship.\"  \"Isn't it?\" Symes said.  \"It doesn't fit her. That kind of--\"  \"I know. Gerda's like you. A little stuffy.\"  \"It's not being stuffy,\" Forrester started to explain. \"It's--\"  \"Sure,\" Symes said. \"Only she's not as much of a prude as you are. I couldn't stand her if she were.\"  \"On the other hand, she's not a--\"  \"Not an Owl-boy of Owl-boys like you.\"  \"Not a drunken blockhead,\" Forrester finished triumphantly. \"At least she's got a decent respect for wisdom and learning.\"  Symes stepped back, a movement for which Forrester felt grateful. No matter how far away Ed Symes was, he was still too close.  \"Who you calling a blockhead, buster?\" Symes said. His eyes narrowed to piggish little slits.  Forrester took a deep breath and reminded himself not to hit the other man. \"You,\" he said, almost mildly. \"If brains were radium, you couldn't make a flicker on a scintillation counter.\"  It was just a little doubtful that Symes understood the insult. But he obviously knew it had been one. His face changed color to a kind of grayish purple, and his hands clenched slowly at his sides. Forrester stood watching him quietly.  Symes made a sound like _Rrr_ and took a breath. \"If you weren't an acolyte, I'd take a poke at you just to see you bounce.\"  \"Sure you would,\" Forrester agreed politely.  Symes went _Rrr_ again and there was a longer silence. Then he said: \"Not that I'd hit you anyhow, buster. It'd go against my grain. Not the acolyte business--if you didn't look so much like Bacchus, I'd take the chance.\"  Forrester's jaw ached. In a second he realized why; he was clenching his teeth tightly. Perhaps it was true that he did look a little like Bacchus, but not enough for Ed Symes to kid about it.  Symes grinned at him. Symes undoubtedly thought the grin gave him a pleasant and carefree expression. It didn't.

We are informed in the fourth chapter of Genesis, that cattle were kept by the early descendants of Adam; Jubal, the son of Lamech--who was probably born during the lifetime of Adam--being styled the father of such as have cattle. The ox having been preserved by Noah from the flood of waters, the original breed of our present cattle must have been in the neighborhood of Mount Ararat. From thence, dispersing over the face of the globe--altering by climate, by food, and by cultivation--originated the various breeds of modern ages.  That the value of the ox tribe has been in all ages and climates highly appreciated, we have ample evidence. The natives of Egypt, India, and Hindostan, seem alike to have placed the cow amongst their deities; and, judging by her usefulness to all classes, no animal could perhaps have been selected whose value to mankind is greater. The traditions, indeed, of every Celtic nation enroll the cow among the earliest productions, and represent it as a kind of divinity.  In nearly all parts of the earth cattle are employed for their labor, for their milk, and for food. In southern Africa they are as much the associates of the Caffre as the horse is of the Arab. They share his toils, and assist him in tending his herds. They are even trained to battle, in which they become fierce and courageous. In central Africa the proudest ebony beauties are to be seen upon the backs of cattle. In all ages they have drawn the plough. In Spain they still trample out the corn; in India they raise the water from the deepest wells to irrigate the thirsty soil of Bengal. When Cæsar invaded Britain they constituted the chief riches of its inhabitants; and they still form no inconsiderable item in the estimate of that country's riches.  The parent race of the ox is said to have been much larger than any of the present varieties. The Urus, in his wild state at least, was an enormous and fierce animal, and ancient legends have thrown around him an air of mystery. In almost every part of the continent of Europe and in every district of England, skulls, evidently belonging to cattle, have been found, far exceeding in bulk any now known.  As the various breeds of cattle among us were introduced into this country from Great Britain, we propose, before going into the details of the leading American breeds, to glance somewhat briefly at the history of   THE BRITISH OX.  In the earliest and most reliable accounts which we possess of the British Isles--the Commentaries of Cæsar--we learn that the ancient Britons possessed great numbers of cattle. No satisfactory description of these cattle occurs in any ancient author; but, with occasional exceptions, we know that they possessed no great bulk or beauty. Cæsar tells us that the Britons neglected tillage and lived on milk and flesh; and this account of the early inhabitants of the British Isle is corroborated by other authors. It was such an occupation and mode of life as suited their state of society. The island was divided into many little sovereignties; no fixed property was secure; and that alone was valuable which could be hurried away at the threatened approach of the invader. Many centuries after this, when--although one sovereign seemed to reign paramount over the whole of the kingdom--there continued to be endless contests among the feudal barons, and therefore that property alone continued to be valuable which could be secured within the walls of the castle, or driven beyond the assailant's reach--an immense stock of provisions was always stored up in the various fortresses, both for the vassals and the cattle; or it was contrived that the latter should be driven to the domains of some friendly baron, or concealed in some inland recess.  When the government became more powerful and settled, and property of every kind was assured a proportionate degree of protection, as well as more equally divided, the plough came into use; agricultural productions were oftener cultivated, the reaping of which was sure after the labor of sowing. Cattle were then comparatively neglected and for some centuries injuriously so. Their numbers diminished, and their size also seems to have diminished; and it is only within the last century and a half that any serious and successful efforts have been made materially to improve them.  In the comparatively roving and uncertain life which the earlier inhabitants led, their cattle would sometimes stray and be lost. The country was at that time overgrown with forests, and the beasts betook themselves to the recesses of these woods, and became wild and sometimes ferocious. They, by degrees, grew"]]]
