Edgar felt the absence of his sisters keenly. There were but a handful of English traders in the city, and none of these had boys who were near enough to his own age to be companions. However, it had the effect of enabling him, without interruption, to settle down steadily to work with his father, and to make himself acquainted with the details of the business. This he did so industriously that Mr. Blagrove said more than once: \"You are getting on so well, Edgar, that I shall be able to go home for my holiday with the comfortable conviction that in yours and Muller's hands matters will go on very well here, especially as business is so slack.\"  It was about three months after his return that Edgar had an opportunity of finding the advantage of his skill in boxing. He had, on the day after he came back, had a sack of sawdust hung up in his room, and every morning he used to pummel this for half an hour before taking his bath, and again before going to bed, so that he kept his muscles in a state of training. Moreover, this exercise had the advantage that it enabled him to stand the heat of the climate much better than he would otherwise have done, and to save him from any of that feeling of lassitude and depression so usual among Englishmen working in hot climates. He was returning one day from a ride; dusk had fallen, and when just beyond the limits of the town he heard shouts and cries, and saw a scuffle going on in the road. Cantering on, he leapt from his horse, dropped the reins on its neck, and ran forward.  Two of the lowest class Maltese or Greeks were dragging a young Arab along, holding his hands to prevent him getting at his knife, and beating him about the head with their disengaged hands. It was evident that he was not one of the dwellers in the city, but an Arab of the desert. His horse stood near, and he had apparently been dragged from it.  \"What is the matter? what are you beating him for?\" he asked in Italian.  \"This Arab dog pushed against us with his horse, and when we cursed him, struck at us.\"  \"Well, if he did, you have punished him enough; but perhaps his story is a different one.\"  \"Go your way, boy,\" one exclaimed with a Greek oath, \"or we will throw you into that fountain, as we are going to do him.\"  \"You will, eh? Unloose that lad at once or it will be worse for you.\"  The man uttered a shout of rage. \"Hold this young Arab wolf's other hand, Giaccamo, so that he cannot use his knife. I will settle this boy;\" and his companion seized the lad's other wrist.  He rushed at Edgar, waving his arms in windmill fashion, thinking to strike him down without the least difficulty, but he was astounded at being met with a terrific blow on the nose, which nigh threw him off his balance, and this was followed an instant later by another on the point of his chin, which hurled him back, half-stunned, to the ground, with a vague impression in his mind that his head was broken into fragments. Before he even thought of rising, Edgar sprang at his companion, who, releasing the Arab boy's hands, grasped his knife, but before he could draw it, a blow, given with all Edgar's strength and the impetus of his bound forward, stretched him also on the ground, his knife flying from his hand.  The Arab boy had drawn his knife also, but Edgar exclaimed to him in his own language, \"No, no, pick up the other knife, and then stand over him, but don't stab him.\" Then he turned to his first assailant, who was rising to his feet, still confused and bewildered. He had instinctively drawn his knife.  \"Drop your knife, drop it!\" Edgar cried. But with an oath the man sprang at him. His eyes, however, were full of tears, his ears sung, and his head buzzed, partly from the blow on the jaw, partly from the force with which he had come in contact with the ground. Edward lightly sprung aside and avoided the cut aimed at him, and then delivered a blow with all his force just in front of the ear, and the man dropped again as if shot. In a moment Edgar had wrenched the knife from his hand, then he turned to the young Arab.  \"That is enough,\" he said; \"they have both got more than they wanted; they are harmless now, we have their two knives.\"  The Arab, who was panting from his exertions, and who had evidently restrained himself with difficulty from plunging his knife into his fallen assailant, turned round towards him.  \"Who are you, brother, whose blows fell men like strokes of lightning?\"  \"My name is Edgar Blagrove. I am the son of a merchant, whose place of business is in the great square. Who are you, and how did this business begin?\"  \"My name is Sidi Ben Ouafy. I am the son of a chief. My father's tribe live in the oasis ten miles east of the old lake. I was riding from the town when these two men, for whom there was, as you see, plenty of room in the road, staggered suddenly against me, whether with evil intent or merely to enjoy the pleasure of seeing me rolling in the dust, I know not. They nearly unseated me from the suddenness of the attack, and as I recovered I certainly struck at them with my whip. One seized me by the foot and threw me off my horse, and then, as you saw, they fell upon me, beat me, and were dragging me to the fountain to throw me in when you came up. Had they not heard your horse coming along they would, I believe, have killed me. Henceforth you are my brother; my horses and all that I have are yours, and every sword of our tribe would leap from its scabbard in your defence were it needed. To-morrow I will ride in again, and my father himself will assuredly come with me. I cannot speak of my gratitude now, my head is still dizzy with the blows they gave me; even yet I cannot understand how it was that these two men have thus fallen before you, and you with no weapon in your hands. Are they dead?\"  \"Not they,\" Edgar said scornfully; \"they are wondering what has happened to them, and fear to move, not knowing that their own knives might not be driven into their hearts did they venture to rise. Well, good-bye, Sidi; I will see you off first; and I should advise you, when you ride into the town again, to bring your pistols with you. Like enough these scoundrels will try to get revenge for this defeat.\"  \"I will do so. I know not why I did not carry them to-day. I will not only bring them, but two of my tribesmen shall ride with me. But methinks that you will be in greater danger than I shall, brother.\"  \"I shall be on the look-out, and will, for a time, carry pistols with me; but I do not often go out after dark, and have no occasion ever to enter the streets where rogues of this sort live. As to an open attack, I have no fear of it; but I have no doubt that either of those scoundrels would plant a knife between my shoulders if they had a chance to do so.\"  Both the lads mounted their horses, and after a few words of farewell rode off in different directions. Not until the sound of the horses' hoofs died away did the two figures in the road move, then they sat up.  \"What has happened, Zeno?\"  \"I know not, save that my head is ringing. I feel as if my jaws were broken, and my nose is so swelled that it seems as big as my head.\"  \"And I can scarcely see from my eyes,\" the other said. \"Cospetto, never before have I been thus handled!\"  \"We will kill him!\" the other said furiously.  \"That of course; I know not who he was, but we shall doubtless find out. I can hardly believe even now that it was with his hand that he struck us--it was done so quickly. He was there--then I struck at him, when--paff!--and it seemed to me that the air was full of stars; then, paff again! my jaws cracked, I fell backwards, there was a crash, and the world seemed to have come to an end. And you, Giaccamo, what did he do to you?\"  \"It was like that, except that I only had one blow, and there was an end of it. I was drawing my knife when it came--how, I know not. My knife flew from my hand--there was a flash of fire from my eyes, and I was on the ground, and thought it best to lie there, lest that accursed young Arab should take it into his head to sheathe my knife in my body. The next time we will give the young fellow no chance to try those strange tricks upon us.\"  \"You are right, Giaccamo; I would sooner fight against even Thomasso, who is the best knife-player in Alexandria, than face that fellow again. Who can he be, I wonder?\"  Edgar rode home, and after seeing his horse taken into the stable, went into the house.  \"I have found my boxing of use, father.\"  \"How is that, Edgar?\"  The lad told him what had happened.  \"You were quite right to strike, my boy,\" his father went on when he had heard the story; \"'tis likely enough that those ruffians would have killed the lad. There are fellows here who would do murder for the sake of a few copper coins; and, doubtless, those men thought that the young chief would have some trinkets about him that would pay them for their trouble. I am sorry that you did not let the Arab put his knife into them; it would have been a good riddance, for the town abounds with rascals of that kind--the scum of the Mediterranean, men who have made their native towns too hot to hold them, and have committed crimes untold. As it is, you will have to be careful; fellows of this kind are not of a forgiving nature, and will be patient enough to wait for their revenge, but sooner or later they will attempt to take it.\"  \"It was so dark, father, that they can scarcely have seen my face.\"  \"Perhaps not, but no doubt they were able to make out your figure, and there are very few better-class young Europeans here. You will have to be on your guard, lad; you had better always carry pistols with you. Clever as you may be with your fists, if you were attacked by half-a-dozen fellows with knives, you would stand but little chance with them. Don't be out after dusk; in daylight you are fairly safe. At any rate, you would be, if you avoid the rookeries, where"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22225"],["title","Mary Louise in the Country (#1)"],["body","said he'd gimme a dollar fer the trunks, that's all.\"  \"How much do you charge a day?\" asked the Colonel.  \"Dollar 'n' a quarter's my reg'lar price, an' I won't take no less,\" asserted Joe.  Mary Louise nearly laughed outright, but the Colonel frowned and said:  \"Joe Brennan, you've got me at your mercy. I'm going to hire you by the day, at a dollar and a quarter, and as your time now belongs to me I request you to go at once for those trunks. You will find them just beyond the station.\"  The man's face brightened. He tossed away the core of his apple and jerked the reins to make the horses hold up their heads.  \"A bargain's a bargain, Boss,\" he remarked cheerfully, \"so I'll get them air trunks to yer house if it takes till midnight.\"  \"Very good,\" said the Colonel. \"Drive on, Uncle.\"  The old servant started the motor.  \"Dat's what I calls downright robbery, Kun'l,\" he exclaimed, highly incensed. \"Didn't I ask de stoahkeepeh what to pay Joe Brennen foh bringin' oveh dem trunks, an' didn't he say a dolleh is big pay foh such-like a trip? If we's gwine live in dis town, where day don' un'stand city prices an' de high cost o' livin' yit, we gotta hol' 'em down an' keep 'em from speckilatin' with us, or else we'll spile 'em fer de time when we's gone away.\"  \"Very true, Uncle. Has Joe a competitor?\"  Uncle Eben reflected.  \"Ef he has, Kun'l, I ain't seen it,\" he presently replied; \"but I guess all he's got is dat lumbeh-wagin.\"  Mary Louise had enjoyed the controversy immensely and was relieved by the promise of the trunks by midnight. For the first time in her life the young orphaned girl was to play housekeeper for her grandfather and surely one of her duties was to see that the baggage was safely deposited in their new home.  This unknown home in an unknown town had an intense fascination for her just now. Her grandfather had been rather reticent in his description of the house he had rented at Cragg's Crossing, merely asserting it was a \"pretty place\" and ought to make them a comfortable home for the summer. Nor had the girl questioned him very closely, for she loved to \"discover things\" and be surprised--whether pleasurably or not did not greatly interfere with the thrill.  The motor took them speedily along a winding way to Cragg's Crossing, a toy town that caused Mary Louise to draw a long breath of delight at first sight. The \"crossing\" of two country roads had probably resulted, at some far-back period, in farmers' building their residences on the four corners, so as to be neighborly. Farm hands or others built little dwellings adjoining--not many of them, though--and some unambitious or misdirected merchant erected a big frame \"store\" and sold groceries, dry goods and other necessities of life not only to the community at the Crossing but to neighboring farmers. Then someone started the little \"hotel,\" mainly to feed the farmers who came to the store to trade or the \"drummers\" who visited it to sell goods. A church and a schoolhouse naturally followed, in course of time, and then, as if its destiny were fulfilled, the sleepy little town--ten miles from the nearest railway--gradually settled into the comatose state in which Colonel Hathaway and his granddaughter now found it.    CHAPTER II THE KENTON PLACE  The tiny town, however, was not all that belonged to the Cragg's Crossing settlement. Barely a quarter of a mile away from the village a stream with beautifully wooded banks ran diagonally through the countryside. It was called a \"river\" by the natives, but it was more of a creek; halfway between a small rivulet and a brook, perhaps. But its banks afforded desirable places for summer residences, several of which had been built by well-to-do families, either retired farmers or city people who wished for a cool and quiet place in which to pass the summer months.  These residences, all having ample grounds and facing the creek on either side, were sufficiently scattered to be secluded, and it was to one of the most imposing of these that Uncle Eben guided the automobile. He crossed the creek on a primitive but substantial bridge, turned to the right, and the first driveway led to the house that was to be Mary Louise's temporary home.  \"This is lovely!\" exclaimed the girl, as they rolled up a winding drive edged by trees and shrubbery, and finally drew up before the entrance of a low and rambling but quite modern house. There was Aunt Polly, her round black face all smiles, standing on the veranda to greet them, and Mary Louise sprang from the car first to hug the old servant--Uncle Eben's spouse--and then to run in to investigate the establishment, which seemed much finer than she had dared to imagine it.  The main building was of two stories, but the wings, several of which jutted out in various directions, were one story in height, somewhat on the bungalow plan. There was a good-sized stable in connection--now used as a garage--and down among the oaks toward the river an open pavilion had been built. All the open spaces were filled with flowers and ferns, in beds and borders, and graveled paths led here and there in a very enticing way. But the house was now the chief fascination and the other details Mary Louise gleaned by sundry glances from open windows as she rambled from room to room.  At luncheon, which Aunt Polly served as soon as her young mistress could be coaxed from her tour of inspection, the girl said:  \"Gran'pa Jim, who owns this place?\"  \"A Mrs. Joselyn,\" he replied.  \"A young woman?\"  \"I believe so. It was built by her mother, a Mrs. Kenton, some fifteen years ago, and is still called 'the Kenton Place.' Mrs. Kenton died and her daughter, who married a city man named Joselyn, has used it as a summer home until this year. I think Mrs. Joselyn is a woman of considerable means.\"  \"The furnishings prove that,\" said Mary Louise. \"They're not all in the best of taste, but they are plentiful and meant to be luxurious. Why doesn't Mrs. Joselyn occupy her home this summer? And why, if she is wealthy, does she rent the place?\"  \"Those are problems I am unable to solve, my dear,\" replied the Colonel with a smile. \"When old man Cragg, who is the nearest approach to a real estate agent in the village, told me the place was for rent, I inquired the price and contracted to lease it for the summer. That satisfied me, Mary Louise, but if you wish to inquire into the history and antecedents of the Kenton and Joselyn families, I have no doubt there are plenty of village gossips who can fill your ears full of it.\"  \"Dar's one thing I foun' out, seh,\" remarked Uncle Eben, who always served at table and was not too diffident to join in the conversation of his betters, at times; \"dis Joselyn man done dis'pear--er run away-- er dig out, somehow--an' he missus is mos' plumb crazy 'bout it.\"  \"When did that happen?\" asked Mary Louise.  \"'Bout Chris'mas time, de stoahkeepah say. Nobody don't like him down heah, 'cause he put on a 'strord'nary 'mount o' airs an' didn't mix wid de town people, nohow. De stoahkeepeh t'inks Marse Joselyn am crooked-like an' done squandeh a lot o' he wife's money befoh he went.\"  \"Perhaps,\" said Mary Louise musingly, \"that is why the poor woman is glad to rent this house. I wish, however, we had gotten it for a more pleasant reason.\"  \"Don't pay attention to Eben's chatter, my dear,\" advised her grandfather. \"His authority seems to be the ancient storekeeper, whom I saw but once and didn't fancy. He looks like an old owl, in those big, horn-rimmed spectacles.\"  \"Dat stoahkeepeh ain' no owl, Kun'l,\" asserted Uncle Eben earnestly. \"He done know all dey is to know 'roun' dese diggin's, an' a lot moah, too. An' a owl is a mighty wise bird, Kun'l, ef I do say it, an' no disrespec'; so what dat stoahkeepeh say I's boun' to take notice of.\"  Mary Louise spent the afternoon in examining her new possession and \"getting settled.\" For--wonder of wonders!--Joe Brennan arrived with the trunks at three o'clock, some nine hours before the limit of midnight. The Colonel, as he paid the man, congratulated him on making such good time.  \"Ya-as,\" drawled Joe; \"I done pretty well, considerin'. But if I hadn't hired out by the day I'd sure be'n a loser. I've be'n a good ten hours goin' fer them trunks, fer I started at five this mornin'; so, if I'd tooken a doller fer the job, I'd only made ten cents a hour, my price bein' twenty-five. But, as it is,\" he added with pride, \"I git my reg'lar rate of a dollar 'n' a quarter a day.\"  \"Proving that it pays to drive a bargain,\" commented the Colonel.  Mary Louise unpacked Gran'pa Jim's trunk first and put his room in \"apple-pie order,\" as Aunt Polly admiringly asserted. Then she settled her own pretty room, held a conference with her servants about the meals and supplies, and found it was then time to dress for dinner. She was not yet old enough to find household duties a bore, so the afternoon had been delightfully spent.  Early after breakfast the next morning, however, Mary Louise started out to explore the grounds of her domain. The day was full of sunshine and the air laden with fragrance of flowers--a typical May morning. Gran'pa Jim would, of course, read for an hour or two and smoke his pipe; he drew a chair upon the broad veranda for this very purpose; but the girl had the true pioneer spirit of discovery and wanted to know exactly what her five acres contained.  The water was doubtless the prime attraction in such a neighborhood. Mary Louise made straight for the river bank and found the shallow stream--here scarce fifty feet in width--rippling along over its stony bed, which was a full fifty feet wider than the volume of water then required. When the spring freshets were on perhaps the stream reached its banks, but in the summer months it was usually subdued as now. The banks were four feet or more above the rabble of stones below, and close to the bank, facing the river on her side, Mrs. Kenton had built a pretty pavilion with ample seats and"]]]
