This was a bold thing to undertake, as the rays of the sun could not fail to burn whoever should venture so near to them.  At last the venerable dormouse himself undertook it, for the very good reason that no one else would. At this time the dormouse was the largest animal in the world. When he stood up he looked like a mountain. It made haste to the place where the sun lay ensnared, and as it came nearer and nearer, its back began to smoke and burn with the heat, and the whole top of his huge bulk was turned in a very short time to enormous heaps of ashes. It succeeded, however, in cutting the cord with its teeth and freeing the sun, which rolled up again, as round and beautiful as ever, into the wide blue sky. But the dormouse--or blind woman as it is called--was shrunk away to a very small size; and that is the reason why it is now one of the tiniest creatures upon the earth.  The little boy returned home when he discovered that the sun had escaped his snare, and devoted himself entirely to hunting. \"If the beautiful hair of my sister would not hold the sun fast, nothing in the world could,\" he said. \"He was not born, a little fellow like himself, to look after the sun. It required one greater and wiser than he was to regulate that.\" And he went out and shot ten more snow-birds; for in this business he was very expert; and he had a new bird-skin coat made, which was prettier than the one he had worn before.     III.  STRONG DESIRE, AND THE RED SORCERER.   There was a man called Odshedoph, or the Child of Strong Desires, who had a wife and one son. He had withdrawn his family from the village, where they had spent the winter, to the neighborhood of a distant forest, where game abounded. This wood was a day's travel from his winter home, and under its ample shadow the wife fixed the lodge, while the husband went out to hunt. Early in the evening he returned with a deer, and, being weary and athirst, he asked his son, whom he called Strong Desire, to go to the river for some water. The son replied that it was dark, and he was afraid. His father still urged him, saying that his mother, as well as himself, was tired, and the distance to the water very short. But no persuasion could overcome the young man's reluctance. He refused to go.  \"Ah, my son,\" said the father, at last, \"if you are afraid to go to the river, you will never kill the Red Head.\"  The stripling was deeply vexed by this observation; it seemed to touch him to the very quick. He mused in silence. He refused to eat, and made no reply when spoken to. He sat by the lodge door all the night through, looking up at the stars, and sighing like one sorely distressed.  The next day he asked his mother to dress the skin of the deer, and to make it into moccasins for him, while he busied himself in preparing a bow and arrows.  As soon as these were in readiness, he left the lodge one morning, at sunrise, without saying a word to his father or mother. As he passed along, he fired one of his arrows into the air, which fell westward. He took that course, and coming to the spot where the arrow had fallen, he was rejoiced to find it piercing the heart of a deer. He refreshed himself with a meal of the venison, and the next morning he fired another arrow. Following its course, after traveling all day he found that he had transfixed another deer. In this manner he fired four arrows, and every evening he discovered that he had killed a deer.  By a strange oversight, he left the arrows sticking in the carcasses, and passed on without withdrawing them. Having in this way no arrow for the fifth day, he was in great distress at night for the want of food.  At last he threw himself upon the earth in despair, concluding that he might as well perish there as go further. But he had not lain long before he heard a hollow rumbling noise, in the ground beneath him, like that of an earthquake moving slowly along.  He sprang up, and discovered at a distance the figure of a human being, walking with a stick. He looked attentively, and saw that the figure was walking in a wide beaten path in a prairie, leading from a dusky lodge to a lake, whose waters were black and turbid.  To his surprise, this lodge, which had not been in view when he cast himself upon the ground, was now near at hand. He approached a little nearer, and concealed himself; and in a moment he discovered that the figure was no other than that of the terrible witch, the little old woman who makes war. Her path to the lake was perfectly smooth and solid, and the noise Strong Desire had heard was caused by the striking of her walking staff upon the ground. The top of this staff was decorated with a string of the toes and bills of birds of every kind, who, at every stroke of the stick, fluttered and sung their various notes in concert.  She entered her lodge and laid off her mantle, which was entirely composed of the scalps of women. Before folding it, she shook it several times, and at every shake the scalps uttered loud shouts of laughter, in which the old hag joined. The boy, who lingered at the door, was greatly alarmed, but he uttered no cry.  After laying by the cloak, she came directly to him. Looking at him steadily, she informed him that she had known him from the time he had left his father's lodge, and had watched his movements. She told him not to fear or despair, for she would be his protector and friend. She invited him into her lodge, and gave him a supper. During the repast, she questioned him as to his motives for visiting her. He related his history, stated the manner in which he had been disgraced, and the difficulties he labored under.  \"Now tell me truly,\" said the little old woman who makes war, \"you were afraid to go to the water in the dark.\"  \"I was,\" Strong Desire answered, promptly.  As he replied, the hag waved her staff. The birds set up a clamorous cry, and the mantle shook violently as all the scalps burst into a hideous shout of laughter.  \"And are you afraid now,\" she asked again.  \"I am,\" again answered Strong Desire, without hesitation.  \"But you are not afraid to speak the truth,\" rejoined the little old woman. \"You will be a brave man yet.\"  She cheered him with the assurance of her friendship, and began at once to exercise her power upon him. His hair being very short, she took a great leaden comb, and after drawing it through his locks several times, they became of a handsome length like those of a beautiful young woman. She then proceeded to dress him as a female, furnishing him with the necessary garments, and tinting his face with colors of the most charming dye. She gave him, too, a bowl of shining metal. She directed him to put in his girdle a blade of scented sword-grass, and to proceed the next morning to the banks of the lake, which was no other than that over which the Red Head reigned. Now Hah-Undo-Tah, or the Red Head, was a most powerful sorcerer, living upon an island in the centre of his realm of water, and he was the terror of all the country. She informed him that there would be many Indians upon the island, who, as soon as they saw him use the shining bowl to drink with, would come and solicit him to be their wife, and to take him over to the island. These offers he was to refuse, and to say that he had come a great distance to be the wife of the Red Head, and that if the chief could not seek her for himself, she would return to her village. She said, that as soon as the Red Head heard of this he would come for her in his own canoe, in which she must embark.  \"On reaching the shore,\" added the little old woman, \"you must consent to be his wife; and in the evening you are to induce him to take a walk out of the village, and when you have reached a lonesome spot, use the first opportunity to cut off his head with the blade of grass.\"  She also gave Strong Desire general advice how he was to conduct himself to sustain his assumed character of a woman. His fear would scarcely permit him to consent to engage in an adventure attended with so much danger; but the recollection of his father's looks and reproaches of the want of courage, decided him.  Early in the morning he left the lodge of the little old woman who makes war, which was clouded in a heavy brackish fog, so thick and heavy to breathe, that he with difficulty made his way forth. When he turned to look back for it, it was gone.  He took the hard beaten path to the banks of the lake, and made for the water at a point directly opposite the Red Head's lodge.  Where he now stood it was beautiful day. The heavens were clear, and the sun shone out as brightly to Strong Desire as on the first morning when he had put forth his little head from the door of his father's lodge. He had not been long there, sauntering along the beach, when he displayed the glittering bowl by dipping water from the lake. Very soon a number of canoes came off from the island. The men admired his dress, and were charmed with his beauty, and almost with one voice they all made proposals of marriage. These, Strong Desire promptly declined.  When this was reported to Red Head, he ordered his royal bark to be launched by his chosen men of the oar, and crossed over to see this wonderful girl. As they approached the shore, Strong Desire saw that the ribs of the sorcerer's canoe were formed of living rattlesnakes, whose heads pointed outward to guard him from his enemies. Being invited, he had no sooner stepped into the canoe, than they began to hiss and rattle furiously, which put him in a great fright; but the magician spoke to them, when they became pacified and quiet. Shortly after they were at the landing upon the island. The marriage took place immediately; and the bride made presents of various valuables which had been furnished her by the old witch who inhabited the cloudy lodge.  As they were sitting in the lodge,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2225"],["title","\"Captains Courageous\": A Story of the Grand Banks (#1)"],["body","thick flavour of their own which made a sort of background to the smells of fried fish, burnt grease, paint, pepper, and stale tobacco; but these, again, were all hooped together by one encircling smell of ship and salt water. Harvey saw with disgust that there were no sheets on his bed-place. He was lying on a piece of dingy ticking full of lumps and nubbles. Then, too, the boat's motion was not that of a steamer. She was neither sliding nor rolling, but rather wriggling herself about in a silly, aimless way, like a colt at the end of a halter. Water-noises ran by close to his ear, and beams creaked and whined about him. All these things made him grunt despairingly and think of his mother.  \"Feelin' better?\" said the boy, with a grin. \"Hev some coffee?\" He brought a tin cup full, and sweetened it with molasses.  \"Is n't there milk?\" said Harvey, looking round the dark double tier of bunks as if he expected to find a cow there.  \"Well, no,\" said the boy. \"Ner there ain't likely to be till 'baout mid-September. 'Tain't bad coffee. I made it.\"  Harvey drank in silence, and the boy handed him a plate full of pieces of crisp fried pork, which he ate ravenously.  \"I've dried your clothes. Guess they've shrunk some,\" said the boy. \"They ain't our style much--none of 'em. Twist round an' see ef you're hurt any.\"  Harvey stretched himself in every direction, but could not report any injuries.  \"That's good,\" the boy said heartily. \"Fix yerself an' go on deck. Dad wants to see you. I'm his son,--Dan, they call me,--an' I'm cook's helper an' everything else aboard that's too dirty for the men. There ain't no boy here 'cep' me sence Otto went overboard--an' he was only a Dutchy, an' twenty year old at that. How'd you come to fall off in a dead flat ca'am?\"  \"'Twasn't a calm,\" said Harvey, sulkily. \"It was a gale, and I was seasick. Guess I must have rolled over the rail.\"  \"There was a little common swell yes'day an' last night,\" said the boy. \"But ef thet's your notion of a gale----\" He whistled. \"You'll know more 'fore you're through. Hurry! Dad's waitin'.\"  Like many other unfortunate young people, Harvey had never in all his life received a direct order--never, at least, without long, and sometimes tearful, explanations of the advantages of obedience and the reasons for the request. Mrs. Cheyne lived in fear of breaking his spirit, which, perhaps, was the reason that she herself walked on the edge of nervous prostration. He could not see why he should be expected to hurry for any man's pleasure, and said so. \"Your dad can come down here if he's so anxious to talk to me. I want him to take me to New York right away. It'll pay him.\"  Dan opened his eyes, as the size and beauty of this joke dawned on him. \"Say, dad!\" he shouted up the fo'c'sle hatch, \"he says you kin slip down an' see him ef you're anxious that way. 'Hear, dad?\"  The answer came back in the deepest voice Harvey had ever heard from a human chest: \"Quit foolin', Dan, and send him to me.\"  Dan sniggered, and threw Harvey his warped bicycle shoes. There was something in the tones on the deck that made the boy dissemble his extreme rage and console himself with the thought of gradually unfolding the tale of his own and his father's wealth on the voyage home. This rescue would certainly make him a hero among his friends for life. He hoisted himself on deck up a perpendicular ladder, and stumbled aft, over a score of obstructions, to where a small, thick-set, clean-shaven man with grey eyebrows sat on a step that led up to the quarter-deck. The swell had passed in the night, leaving a long, oily sea, dotted round the horizon with the sails of a dozen fishing-boats. Between them lay little black specks, showing where the dories were out fishing. The schooner, with a triangular riding-sail on the mainmast, played easily at anchor, and except for the man by the cabin-roof--\"house\" they call it--she was deserted.  \"Mornin'--good afternoon, I should say. You've nigh slep' the clock around, young feller,\" was the greeting.  \"Mornin',\" said Harvey. He did not like being called \"young feller\"; and, as one rescued from drowning, expected sympathy. His mother suffered agonies whenever he got his feet wet; but this mariner did not seem excited.  \"Naow let's hear all abaout it. It's quite providential, first an' last, fer all concerned. What might be your name? Where from (we mistrust it's Noo York), an' where baound (we mistrust it's Europe)?\"  Harvey gave his name, the name of the steamer, and a short history of the accident, winding up with a demand to be taken back immediately to New York, where his father would pay anything any one chose to name.  \"H'm,\" said the shaven man, quite unmoved by the end of Harvey's speech. \"I can't say we think special of any man, or boy even, that falls overboard from that kind o' packet in a flat ca'am. Least of all when his excuse is thet he's seasick.\"  \"Excuse!\" cried Harvey. \"D'you suppose I'd fall overboard into your dirty little boat for fun?\"  \"Not knowin' what your notions o' fun may be, I can't rightly say, young feller. But if I was you, I wouldn't call the boat which, under Providence, was the means o' savin' ye, names. In the first place, it's blame irreligious. In the second, it's annoyin' to my feelin's--an' I'm Disko Troop o' the \"We're Here\" o' Gloucester, which you don't seem rightly to know.\"  \"I don't know and I don't care,\" said Harvey. \"I'm grateful enough for being saved and all that, of course; but I want you to understand that the sooner you take me back to New York the better it'll pay you.\"  \"Meanin'--haow?\" Troop raised one shaggy eyebrow over a suspiciously mild blue eye.  \"Dollars and cents,\" said Harvey, delighted to think that he was making an impression. \"Cold dollars and cents.\" He thrust a hand into a pocket, and threw out his stomach a little, which was his way of being grand. \"You've done the best day's work you ever did in your life when you pulled me in. I'm all the son Harvey Cheyne has.\"  \"He's bin favoured,\" said Disko, drily.  \"And if you don't know who Harvey Cheyne is, you don't know much--that's all. Now turn her around and let's hurry.\"  Harvey had a notion that the greater part of America was filled with people discussing and envying his father's dollars.  \"Mebbe I do, an' mebbe I don't. Take a reef in your stummick, young feller. It's full o' my vittles.\"  Harvey heard a chuckle from Dan, who was pretending to be busy by the stump-foremast, and the blood rushed to his face. \"We'll pay for that too,\" he said. \"When do you suppose we shall get to New York?\"  \"I don't use Noo York any. Ner Boston. We may see Eastern Point about September; an' your pa--I'm real sorry I hain't heerd tell of him--may give me ten dollars efter all your talk. Then o' course he mayn't.\"  \"Ten dollars! Why, see here, I--\" Harvey dived into his pocket for the wad of bills. All he brought up was a soggy packet of cigarettes.  \"Not lawful currency, an' bad for the lungs. Heave 'em overboard, young feller, and try ag'in.\"  \"It's been stolen!\" cried Harvey, hotly.  \"You'll hev to wait till you see your pa to reward me, then?\"  \"A hundred and thirty-four dollars--all stolen,\" said Harvey, hunting wildly through his pockets. \"Give them back.\"  A curious change flitted across old Troop's hard face. \"What might you have been doin' at your time o' life with one hundred an' thirty-four dollars, young feller?\"  \"It was part of my pocket-money--for a month.\" This Harvey thought would be a knockdown blow, and it was--indirectly.  Oh! One hundred and thirty-four dollars is only part of his pocket-money--for one month only! You don't remember hittin' anything when you fell over, do you? Crack ag'in' a stanchion, le's say. Old man Hasken o' the \"East Wind\"--Troop seemed to be talking to himself--\"he tripped on a hatch an' butted the mainmast with his head--hardish. 'Baout three weeks afterwards, old man Hasken he would hev it that the \"East Wind\" was a commerce-destroyin' man-o'-war, an' so he declared war on Sable Island because it was Bridish, an' the shoals run aout too far. They sewed him up in a bed-bag, his head an' feet appearin', fer the rest o' the trip, an' now he's to home in Essex playin' with little rag dolls.\"  Harvey choked with rage, but Troop went on consolingly: \"We're sorry fer you. We're very sorry fer you--an' so young. We won't say no more abaout the money, I guess.\"  \"'Course you won't. You stole it.\"  \"Suit yourself. We stole it ef it's any comfort to you. Naow, abaout goin' back. Allowin' we could do it, which we can't, you ain't in no fit state to go back to your home, an' we've jest come on to the Banks, workin' fer our bread. We don't see the ha'af of a hundred dollars a month, let alone pocket-money; an' with good luck we'll be ashore again somewheres abaout the first weeks o' September.\"  \"But--but it's May now, and I can't stay here doin' nothing just because you want to fish. I can't, I tell you!\"  \"Right an' jest; jest an' right. No one asks you to do nothin'. There's a heap as you can do, for Otto he went overboard on Le Have. I mistrust he lost his grip in a gale we f'und there. Anyways, he never come back to deny it. You've turned up, plain, plumb providential for all concerned. I mistrust, though, there's ruther few things you kin do. Ain't thet so?\"  \"I can make it lively for you and your crowd when we get ashore,\" said Harvey, with a vicious nod, murmuring vague threats about \"piracy,\" at which Troop almost--not quite--smiled.  \"Excep' talk. I'd forgot that. You ain't asked to talk more'n you've a mind to aboard the \"We're Here\". Keep your eyes open, an' help Dan to do ez he's bid, an' sechlike, an' I'll give you--you ain't wuth it, but I'll give--ten an' a ha'af a month; say thirty-five at the end o' the trip. A little work will ease up your head, an' you kin tell us all abaout your dad an' your ma n' your money efterwards.\"  \"She's on the steamer,\" said Harvey, his eyes fill-with"]]]
