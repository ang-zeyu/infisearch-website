Four or five British soldiers at the rear of the little theatre tried to intercept Mr. Green Hat as he dashed up the aisle. Three of the \"Messrs. Atkins\" went to the floor, under the seats, while the others were brushed aside, and Mr. Green Hat reached the street.  \"Stop that thief!\" roared the young man in the gray suit. \"He has robbed me!\"  By this time Dalzell was again on his feet and out in the aisle. He sprinted for the street, followed closely by Dave Darrin. The young man in the gray suit, his face pallid, plunged after the young naval officers.  \"You're an American, aren't you?\" called Dave, over his shoulder.  \"Yes,\" answered he of the gray suit, \"and in official life at Washington, too. That scoundrel has robbed me of something of value to the United States government.\"  That was enough for Darrin and Dalzell. Though the charge might prove to be false, it was enough to cancel Dave's scruples against fighting.  Out into the street ahead of them ran a waiter, who had taken no part in the scrimmage, waving his arms and shouting:  \"_Esta direcci√≥n!_\" (\"This way!\")  \"_Sigue andando!_\" (\"Keep right on!\") roared Danny Grin, darting down the street at a hard pace.  But a moment later both naval officers, followed by the young man in gray and the waiter, came to a halt, for, directly ahead of them, on the well-lighted street, suddenly appeared a patrol detachment of the British provost guard.  \"Did you stop the fellow who ran this way, sir?\" hailed Ensign Darrin, as he recognized the uniform of the British infantry officer in command of the detachment.  \"We didn't see any man running this way,\" replied the British lieutenant, smartly returning the salute that Ensign Darrin had given him.  \"Didn't _see_ any fellow running?\" repeated three Americans, in tones of bewilderment.  \"We were chasing a thief, sir,\" Darrin continued, \"and this waiter told us that the fugitive ran this way.\"  \"I--I thought he did,\" stammered the waiter in Spanish, though it was now plain that he understood English.  In deep disgust and with dawning suspicion, Dave Darrin glared at the waiter until that fellow changed color and trembled slightly. Dave was now certain that the waiter, probably by previous arrangement, had shielded the escape of Mr. Green Hat.  Turning to the English officer, Dave quickly recounted what had happened. At the same time he introduced himself and Dan as American naval officers, and both tendered their cards.  \"And you, sir? Who are you, and what did you lose?\" inquired the British officer, turning to the young man in the gray suit.  \"May I answer that question to an officer of my own country?\" appealed the young man in the gray suit.  \"Yes,\" assented the British officer, after keenly regarding the stranger who claimed to have been robbed.  \"Will you step a few yards down the street with me?\" urged the unknown American, addressing Dave.  \"Certainly,\" Darrin nodded, for he saw insistent appeal in the stranger's gaze.  \"Mr. Darrin,\" began the stranger, using the name he had heard Dave announce in the introductions to the Britisher, \"do you really belong to the American Navy?\"  \"I do, indeed,\" Darrin answered. \"I am attached to the battleship 'Hudson,' now lying in this harbor.\"  \"Then I will introduce myself,\" continued the young man in the gray suit. \"My name is George Cushing. Do you recognize the meaning of this?\"  \"This\" proved to be a small gold badge, revealed by Cushing as he turned back the lapel of his coat. It was a badge worn by men belonging to a special branch of the secret service of the American Department of State. The members of this special service are usually found, if found at all, on duty in foreign countries.  \"I know the badge, Mr. Cushing,\" nodded Dave Darrin. \"Now, what have you to tell me?\"  \"That big man with the green hat must have started that fight with the waiters in the theatre to cover his intended attack on me,\" Cushing replied. \"At the moment of knocking me down, he snatched from my coat pocket and made off with a most important document.\"  \"Then you almost deserved to lose it, sir,\" replied Darrin sternly, \"as a punishment for wasting your time in such a place as that theatre.\"  \"I must see the American admiral as soon as possible,\" urged Cushing, ignoring Darrin's reproof. \"But first of all, I must ask you to pass me safely by that provost guard, or I might be detained at a time when I cannot afford to lose a single instant. You will vouch for me, won't you, Mr. Darrin? Here are my formal credentials,\" continued Cushing, producing and unfolding a wallet that contained properly sealed and signed credentials from the American Department of State.  \"The paper that was stolen from you did not in any way relate to the defenses and fortifications here at Gibraltar, did it?\" Dave asked.  \"Not in the least,\" Cushing replied promptly.  \"You give me your word of honor for that?\" Dave asked bluntly.  \"Do you believe I'd waste my time on such rubbish as that?\" demanded Cushing, scornfully. \"Why, every civilized government on earth possesses accurate plans of the fortifications at Gibraltar! I give you my word of honor, Mr. Darrin, that the paper stolen from me did not in any way relate to the Gibraltar fortifications.\"  \"Then I'll do my best to get you by the provost guard,\" Ensign Darrin promised, turning to lead the way back.  \"Sir,\" Dave announced to Lieutenant Abercrombie, commanding the provost guard detachment, \"I beg to report, on what I regard as the best of authority, that there is no reason why my countryman, Mr. Cushing, should be detained by you.\"  \"Then that of which he claims to have been robbed is nothing that could officially interest me?\" pressed the British officer.  \"I am certain that the matter could not interest a British officer, except in his desire to see a thief caught,\" Ensign Darrin vouched.  \"That is all, then,\" replied Lieutenant Abercrombie. \"Gentlemen, you are at liberty to proceed on your way.\"  In the meantime the Spanish waiter had slipped back to the theatre.  Dave and Dan saluted, the Englishman doing the same. Then Lieutenant Abercrombie gave each of these brothers in arms a hearty handclasp. The men of the provost guard parted to allow the three Americans to pass on their way.  \"And now where do you wish to go, Mr. Cushing?\" Dave inquired, after they had passed the British provost guard.  \"I suppose you expect me to search for the thief,\" rejoined the man from the State Department. \"But that would now be worse than a waste of time. Gibraltar, quaint Moorish city that it is, is so full of holes in the wall that it would be impossible to find the thief, for he will not venture out again to-night. The best thing I can do will be to go straight to the American admiral, and you gentlemen, I imagine, can take me there.\"  \"A launch will put off from the mole for the flagship at ten o'clock,\" Dave informed him. \"We may as well go down to the mole and wait.\"  Twice, on the way, after leaving the more crowded parts of the city behind, the three were challenged by English sentries invisible in the darkness.  \"Who goes there?\" came the sentry's hail in each instance.  \"Officers from the American flagship,\" Darrin answered for the party.  \"Pass on, gentlemen,\" came the response out of the darkness.  At all times strict watch over all comers outside the British army service is kept at Gibraltar, and after dark this vigilance is doubled.  \"On a moonless night like this, one would imagine that Gibraltar, save for the few blocks of 'city,' held few human beings,\" murmured Dan, as the three continued on at a quiet walk toward the water front. \"One gets the impression that there are but a few sentries, sprinkled here and there, yet we know there are thousands of British soldiers scattered over this rock.\"  \"Hardly scattered,\" smiled Dave Darrin. \"Except for the guard, men and officers are alike in barracks, and many of the barracks are at rather long distances from the fortifications.\"  Nor are the fortifications to be found along the water front. Back on the great hill of rock are gun embrasures, often cut into the face of the rock itself. Back of the embrasures are galleries cut through the stone, and here, in time of siege, the soldiers would stand behind the huge guns.  Gibraltar's harbor is small, though large enough to hold a great fleet. In the days when cannon had shorter range than now, a British fleet might have hidden in the harbor and been secure against all the fleets of the world, for the guns of the huge fortress could have sunk the combined navies of the world, had they attempted to enter the harbor. In these modern days Gibraltar is not so secure, for the heights of Algeciras, in Spain, are only about seven miles away. If Spain were at war with Great Britain, or if any other power took the heights of Algeciras from Spain, guns could be mounted on those heights that would dominate the harbor of Gibraltar. None the less, as long as war exists and the huge stone height of Gibraltar remains, the impression of strong military force will abide with the rock.  Down at the mole a British sentry stopped the trio. Near him stood a corporal and three other soldiers.  \"American officers and a friend,\" replied Ensign Darrin, when halted by this sentry. Then the trio advanced when ordered. Lieutenant Totten, from the 'Hudson,' stepped forward, peered at Darrin and Dalzell, and said to the corporal:  \"I recognize these gentlemen as officers of ours.\"  \"And the friend?\" inquired the corporal.  \"The friend is an American citizen who has business with Admiral Timworth,\" Dave stated.  \"Then it is all right,\" Lieutenant Totten assured the corporal.  Whereupon the British corporal permitted Cushing to step out on the mole with his companions, Darrin and Dalzell.  \"Which is the flagship launch?\" asked Darrin.  \"The rearmost,\" answered Lieutenant Totten. \"Ours is the only launch here. The two other launches belong to the warships of other powers.\""]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22431"],["title","Dave Darrin on Mediterranean Service; or, With Dan Dalzell on European Duty (#2)"],["body","ng, while this brief conversation was going on, had walked rapidly along the mole until he reached the farthest launch.  \"I want you!\" he shouted, bending over suddenly.  He had found and seized by the coat collar the man with the green hat.  Dave and Dan rushed to the spot, hardly knowing what they could do, as they did not want to see the representative of the American State Department lack for backing.  \"Pull Cushing away from that fellow,\" ordered Totten.  \"Is that an official order?\" Dave flashed back, in a whisper.  \"It is,\" nodded Totten, and faded back into the blackness of the night.  Dave bounded forward. He saw that the launch was one belonging to some liner or merchant ship in the harbor. Three or four men belonging in that launch had leaped to the rescue of Mr. Green Hat. Dave, with one tug, tore Cushing away.  Mr. Green Hat fell back in the launch. Two sailors belonging to that craft cast off the lines at bow and stern, and the launch glided out into the harbor.  \"Why didn't you help me, instead of putting the double cross on me?\" Cushing demanded, angrily.  \"I had my reasons,\" Ensign Darrin replied, briefly.  \"They must have been good ones,\" muttered Cushing.  \"All aboard for the flagship!\" announced Lieutenant Totten, in a quiet tone.  \"Come along, if you're going out with us,\" Darrin urged Cushing.  The passengers for the flagship launch were speedily aboard. Other officers were there who had been ashore for the evening.  As the launch was cast off she glided almost noiselessly across the smooth water of the harbor, followed closely by the shifting rays of a British searchlight on shore. Ever since the great European war had started searchlights stationed on shore had followed the movements of every craft in the harbor at night. Beyond, the flagship's few lights glowed brightly. In a few minutes the party was alongside.  Dave and Dan, after saluting the officer of the deck, and reporting their presence on board, went at once to Dave's quarters.  \"There was a good deal of a mix-up, somewhere,\" Dan announced, at once. \"Why should Totten order you to drag Cushing away from Mr. Green Hat, when that rascal had robbed Cushing of valuable government papers?\"  \"It's too big a puzzle for me,\" Ensign Darrin admitted, promptly. \"But Lieutenant Totten is my superior officer, and the responsibility belongs to him.\"  For a few minutes the two chums chatted. Dalzell was about to say good night and go to his own quarters, when an orderly rapped at the door, then entered, saluting.  \"The admiral's compliments, gentlemen,\" said the messenger. \"The admiral wishes to see Ensigns Darrin and Dalzell at once.\"  \"Our compliments, and we will report at once,\" Dave answered. Both young officers were now in uniform, for Dan had left his in Dave's quarters before going ashore, and the chums had changed their clothes while chatting. It now remained only for Dave to reach for his sword and fasten it on, then draw on white gloves, while Dalzell went to his quarters, next door, and did the same.  \"What can be in the wind?\" whispered Dan. \"This is the first time that Admiral Timworth has ever expressed any desire to see us. Can it be that we bungled in some way with the Cushing business?\"  \"I'm not going to waste any time in guessing,\" replied Ensign Darrin, as they stepped briskly along, \"when I'm going to have the answer presented to me so soon.\"  Then they halted before the entrance to the admiral's quarters, to learn if it would be agreeable for the admiral to receive them at once.     CHAPTER II  DAN'S THIRTY-THREE-DOLLAR GUESS   As the two young officers entered the admiral's quarters the curtains were closed behind them by the marine orderly.  Admiral Timworth was seated at his desk. Beside him was Captain Allen, commanding officer of the battleship \"Hudson,\" flagship of the Mediterranean Squadron.  Lieutenant Totten and Cushing were also present.  \"Good evening, gentlemen,\" was Admiral Timworth's greeting, after salutes had been exchanged. \"Accidentally, you became spectators this evening, at a little drama connected with both the diplomatic and the secret service of your country.\"  The admiral paused, but both young officers remained respectfully at attention, making no response, as none was needed.  \"You are aware,\" continued the admiral, \"that Mr. Cushing was knocked down and robbed of an important government paper. Now, it happens that this paper was the key to a code employed by the State and Navy Departments in communicating with naval commanders abroad.\"  This time Dave actually started. The loss of such a code would be vitally important. The State and Navy Departments almost invariably communicate with naval commanders by means of a secret code, which can be read only by commanders possessing the key. Thus, when cablegrams are sent from stations in foreign countries, their import can be understood only by the officers to whom the communications are addressed.  \"That strikes you as a most serious loss, does it not?\" asked Admiral Timworth, smiling.  \"Why, yes, sir; so it would seem,\" Dave answered, bowing.  \"The code that was stolen to-night,\" laughed the admiral, \"will be of but little value to the government into whose hands it may fall. The code in question was one that was used in the year 1880, and has not been employed since. Nor is it likely ever to be employed again.\"  Captain Allen joined in the admiral's laugh.  \"We had every reason,\" continued the admiral, \"to believe that an attempt would be made to steal that code ere Mr. Cushing delivered it to me. In fact, our government allowed it to be rather widely known that Mr. Cushing had left Washington to turn over to me a code. So, of course, Mr. Cushing has been followed. As a matter of fact, the code that we have been using for the last six months has not been changed. I was delighted when I learned that Cushing had been assaulted and robbed. Mr. Cushing himself took the loss seriously, for he did not know, until he came aboard a few moments ago, that the United States government had hoped he _would_ be robbed. Lieutenant Totten was sent ashore, ostensibly to look after the launch, but in reality, to learn, if possible, whether Cushing's assailant put off in the launch of another power, and if so, which power. Ensigns Darrin and Dalzell, you noted, did you not, the nationality of the launch in which Mr. Cushing's assailant escaped?\"  \"I did not, sir,\" Dave replied. \"It was not a naval launch, and therefore did not belong to any ships belonging to the Entente Allies' naval vessels in port here.\"  \"Then, gentlemen,\" continued Admiral Timworth, his voice in tones of formal command, \"you will not at any time mention this matter to any one unless so directed by me. I have had just one object in sending for you and giving you this order. For some time our Government has known that secret efforts are being made to discredit us with the allied powers of Europe. I feel rather certain that this fleet, while in the Mediterranean, will be closely watched by plotters serving one of the Central European powers, or else acting on their own account in the hope of being able to succeed and then claim reward from that government. Keep your eyes open. You may meet other spies and have reason to suspect them to be such. Do not be fooled by the apparent nationality of any man's name. A spy uses many names in his course around the world. Few international spies ever use their own names. The man in the green hat, who assaulted Mr. Cushing to-night, is one of the cleverest of his kind, and perhaps the most able with whom we shall have to contend. The fellow's name is supposed to be Emil Gortchky. At one time or another he has served as spy for nearly every government in Europe. He is a daring, dangerous, and wholly unscrupulous fellow. Ensigns Darrin and Dalzell, I sent for you in order to tell you these things, and to add that if, during this cruise, you run across the fellow at any point, you are to report the fact to me promptly. Of course you will understand that the seal of official secrecy attaches to all that I have said. That is all, gentlemen. Good evening.\"  Saluting, Ensigns Darrin and Dalzell promptly withdrew. They were still a good deal puzzled.  \"I'll come to your quarters in a minute, if I may,\" murmured Danny Grin, as he reached the door of his own cabin.  \"I want you to come,\" Dave answered dryly.  So, in another minute, Dan Dalzell, minus sword and gloves, bobbed into Dave's room.  \"Now, what do you make out of all we have heard and seen?\" breathed Dalzell tensely.  \"Just what the admiral told us,\" answered Darrin.  \"Nothing more?\" pressed Dan.  Dave was thoughtful for a few moments before he replied:  \"Danny, boy, we have our orders from the commander of the fleet. If we encounter Mr. Green Hat anywhere in the future, we are to report the fact. That is the extent of our instructions, and I think we shall do very well not to think too much about the matter, but to be ready, at all times, to follow our orders.\"  \"I was in hope that you could evolve something more romantic than that,\" returned Dalzell disappointedly.  \"It is very likely,\" went on Dave judicially, \"that we have already had as large a hand in the affair as we are going to have. I doubt if we shall hear anything more of Mr. Green Hat; even if we hear of his further deeds, we are not likely to have any personal part in them.\"  \"I'm disappointed,\" Dan admitted, rising. \"I'm going to bed now, for I have to be up at half-past three, to turn out on watch at eight bells. You, lucky dog, have no watch to stand until after breakfast. Good night, Dave!\"  \"Good night; and don't dream of Mr. Green Hat,\" smiled Darrin. \"You'll never see him again.\"  In that prediction Ensign Darrin was destined to find himself fearfully wide of the mark. Mr. Green Hat was not to be so easily dropped from the future calculations of the youngest naval officers on the \"Hudson.\"  None of our readers require any introduction"]]]
