He put them in an envelope and brought them to me at the hospital.\" Lloyd drew out a small paper, which he opened with care. \"Have you ever seen hair of that color before?\"  Goddard took the opened paper, and glanced at its contents. A few red-gold hairs confronted him. Instantly his thoughts flew to the scene of that morning. In his mind's eye he saw the laughing face, the lovely curly Titian hair, and heard the mocking, alluring voice say: \"I'm company.\" He slowly raised his head in time to see the steady gaze of their negro waiter fixed full upon the paper in his hand.     CHAPTER III  A KNOT OF RIBBON BLUE   \"I am so glad to see you, Major Goddard,\" said his hostess, stepping into the hall to greet the young officer, as the black butler admitted him. \"It is a shame you could not get here in time to take supper with us.\"  \"You are not half as disappointed as I, Mrs. Warren,\" replied Goddard, shaking hands warmly. \"I was unavoidably detained at the War Department. Do please accept my sincere apologies for my unintentional rudeness.\"  \"Why, of course; I was sure you could not help the delay. But I must not keep you standing in the hall.\" And she reÃ«ntered the parlor, closely followed by Goddard, who glanced about the room with well-bred curiosity.  It was the first time he had been entertained while in Washington. Senator Warren, to whom he had brought letters from mutual friends in the North, had insisted upon his waiving the formality of a first call. The invitation to supper had been seconded by a cordial note from Mrs. Warren, whom he had met two nights before at the Capitol, and he had accepted the invitation, not counting on the exigencies of the War Department.  The large rooms were comfortably filled with men and women, who sat or stood talking together in little groups. In the further corner a girl was seated at the grand piano; as she raised her head, Goddard recognized Nancy Newton. Mrs. Warren was on the point of introducing him to several of her guests when Nancy struck a few opening chords. Instantly the low hum of conversation ceased, and her clear mezzo-soprano voice filled the room:      He stole from its nest in my golden hair,       A knot of ribbon blue;     He placed on my hand a jewel rare,     And whispered soft, as he held it there,               \"Tender and true,               Adieu, adieu!\"  Drawn by the charm of her voice, Goddard edged nearer and nearer the piano until he leaned against its side facing the singer. He scanned intently the downcast face, the soft, rippling hair, the broad brow, and sensitive red lips. Attracted by the steadiness of his gaze, she raised her eyes to his. For one brief second soul gazed into soul; then the hazel eyes fell before the gray ones, and a rich wave of color mantled Nancy's cheeks as her voice rose in birdlike notes:      They brought my soldier home to me,       And my knot of ribbon blue;     But the cruel wound on his brow was hid     By the flag draped over the coffin lid!                 Tender and true,                 Adieu, adieu!  Silence followed the last note as it died away, for the song struck home. Northern and Southern sympathizers alike swallowed a suspicious lump as they thought of their loved ones far away on a field of strife, and the applause was late in coming.  \"Upon my soul, Nancy, that is a doleful song.\" Doctor Boyd strode over to the piano. \"Give us something cheerful. Play 'Dixie.'\"  \"Indeed, you will do nothing of the sort,\" declared Mrs. Warren, as Nancy's fingers strayed over the keys. \"Do you suppose I want the provost marshal's men camping on my doorstep? Play 'Yankee Doodle' if you wish; but first, Nancy, I want you to meet Major Goddard--Miss Newton. Doctor Boyd, this is our friend Major Goddard, who is here on leave.\"  Nancy simply bowed in acknowledgment of the introduction, but Doctor Boyd held out his hand in hearty greeting.  \"Glad to meet you, Major.\" Seeing Goddard's face more clearly as a guest moved from before one of the lamps, he added: \"Why, you are the officer who wished to arrest us this morning, eh, Nancy?\"  \"Oh, no, sir,\" protested Goddard hastily. \"Captain Lloyd and I simply wanted to--to----\"  \"Don't apologize,\" retorted the doctor. \"Stanton would like nothing better than to send me to Old Capitol Prison; but they can't spare my services, so I am left free to practice my profession.\"  \"What are you growling about now?\" asked Senator Warren, reaching around the doctor to shake hands with Goddard. \"Has my wife left you to the tender mercies of Doctor John, Major? Come on, and I will introduce you to Mrs. Bennett.\"  \"From bad to worse,\" chuckled the doctor. \"She will be claiming your scalp, Major. Come to me when you want a hair restorer.\"  Mrs. Bennett, a very pretty woman with mincing manners, received Goddard graciously, and made room for him on the sofa by her.  \"Your name is already familiar to us,\" she said, \"for your gallant conduct at Cedar Creek was mentioned in all despatches. Mrs. Arnold,\" touching a stout woman who sat next her on the shoulder to attract her attention, \"may I present Major Robert Goddard?\"  \"How do you do.\" Mrs. Arnold held out a fat, jeweled hand in welcome. Her good-natured face was creased in smiles. \"My nephew, John Gurley, has spoken of you so often that I feel as if we were old friends.\"  \"That is very kind of you, Mrs. Arnold,\" said Goddard gratefully. \"John gave me a letter of introduction, but I have been so busy since my arrival here I have had no chance to call on you.\"  \"How is John?\"  \"Very well, and very busy since he has been given his troop.\"  \"Is that the handsome boy who was with you on sick leave last November, Mrs. Arnold?\" asked Mrs. Bennett, raising her eyes languidly to look more closely at Goddard. \"My husband was quite jealous of his attentions. So absurd, you know. Ah!\" She purred as Doctor Boyd drew up a chair and sat down by her. \"My old antagonist! How are you this evening?\"  \"Still unreconstructed,\" retorted the doctor. He turned and surveyed the room, brilliant with the glitter of uniforms and handsome toilets, and his penetrating old eyes grew moist as he read the sorrow and anxiety which both men and women hid beneath feverish excitement and forced gayety.  Until the breaking out of the war, Washington was almost entirely a Southern city. After the firing on Sumter, it became a house divided, and brother fought brother, while Washington women stifled their moans of anguish, and faced the world with a bravery which equaled that shown on the battlefield.  \"How lovely Nancy Newton looks to-night,\" went on the doctor, suddenly realizing that Mrs. Bennett was waiting for him to speak.  \"I cannot agree with you.\" Mrs. Bennett's sleepy eyes opened, and the soft purr left her voice. \"Those pink roses in her red hair are quite too daring for good taste.\"  \"Daring,\" echoed Mrs. Arnold, but half catching Mrs. Bennett's remark. \"Daring, did you say? Nancy is downright bold. The idea of that young girl going to parties given by the officers in the camps about here. Such conduct would not have been tolerated in my day.\" And she squared her ponderous shoulders.  \"There were no camps in your day, Mrs. Arnold,\" retorted the doctor dryly. \"Nancy was chaperoned there by Mrs. Warren. Do you question our hostess' conduct?\"  Alarmed at the very suggestion of such a thing, Mrs. Arnold instantly backed water.  \"I--I--was not informed Mrs. Warren went with her. But, Doctor, take a kindly word from me, and warn Nancy that she must be more circumspect in her conduct. She is already being talked about.\"  \"By a lot of scandal mongers, whose word I would not take on oath,\" exclaimed the doctor hotly.  \"One moment, Doctor John,\" cooed Mrs. Bennett. \"It has been whispered that Nancy is suspected of aiding and abetting the enemy, although,\" spitefully, \"she does sing our songs so well.\"  \"And what of that? Half Washington suspects the other half of sending contraband goods through the lines. I don't doubt some of our unimpeachable friends carry quinine concealed in their bustles.\"  \"Well, really, Doctor!\" Mrs. Arnold's face rivaled her cherry gown in color. \"Such things were not mentioned in my day,\" she ended feebly.  \"Civil war brings strange usages,\" the doctor smiled grimly, \"and to-day's conduct cannot be judged by the standards of the past. I am sorry to shock your sensibilities, but you ladies must not believe all you hear.\"  \"What scandal are you discussing so vigorously?\" called Nancy from a near-by window seat.  Mrs. Bennett jumped perceptibly as Nancy's soft voice reached her. \"Dear child, how you startle one! Have you been there long?\" Her voice rose to a sharper key.  \"Miss Nancy and I have just returned from the back parlor,\" volunteered her escort, a tall officer, wearing the red stripes of the artillery on his well-worn uniform. As he walked toward Mrs. Bennett, she detained him for a moment.  Goddard, who had been an interested listener to the doctor's defense of Nancy, rose from his seat on the sofa, and, seizing his opportunity, stepped over to the alcove and joined the young girl.  \"How is my friend, Misery?\" he asked.  \"Very miserable, indeed, when I left him this afternoon. He does not enjoy being away from me.\"  \"I dare swear he is not alone in that,\" laughed Goddard. \"Won't you sing"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24221"],["title","The Untouchable (#1)"],["body"," there thumbing its nose at us.

What about it?\"  \"Well ... if _he_ were here,\" said Max thoughtfully, \"he'd ... sympathize.\""]]]
