A peculiar thing about the Puddin' was that, though they had all had a great many slices off him, there was no sign of the place whence the slices had been cut.  'That's where the Magic comes in,' explained Bill. 'The more you eats the more you gets. Cut-an'-come-again is his name, an' cut, an' come again, is his nature. Me an' Sam has been eatin' away at this Puddin' for years, and there's not a mark on him. Perhaps,' he added, 'you would like to hear how we came to own this remarkable Puddin'.'  'Nothing would please me more,' said Bunyip Bluegum.  'In that case,' said Bill, 'let her go for a song.'  [Illustration]    'Ho, the cook of the _Saucy Sausage_,     Was a feller called Curry and Rice,   A son of a gun as fat as a tun   With a face as round as a hot-cross bun,     Or a barrel, to be precise.    'One winter's morn we rounds the Horn,     A-rollin' homeward bound.   We strikes on the ice, goes down in a trice,   And all on board but Curry and Rice     And me an' Sam is drowned.  [Illustration]    'For Sam an' me an' the cook, yer see,     We climbs on a lump of ice,   And there in the sleet we suffered a treat   For several months from frozen feet,   With nothin' at all but ice to eat,     And ice does not suffice.    'And Sam and me we couldn't agree     With the cook at any price.   We was both as thin as a piece of tin   While that there cook was busting his skin     On nothin' to eat but ice.  [Illustration]    'Says Sam to me, \"It's a mystery     More deep than words can utter;   Whatever we do, here's me an' you,   Us both as thin as Irish stoo,     While he's as fat as butter.\"    'But late one night we wakes in fright     To see by a pale blue flare,   That cook has got in a phantom pot   A big plum-duff an' a rump-steak hot,   And the guzzlin' wizard is eatin' the lot,     On top of the iceberg bare.'  'There's a verse left out here,' said Bill, stopping the song, 'owin' to the difficulty of explainin' exactly what happened, when me and Sam discovered the deceitful nature of that cook. The next verse is as follows--    'Now Sam an' me can never agree     What happened to Curry and Rice.   The whole affair is shrouded in doubt,   For the night was dark and the flare went out,   And all we heard was a startled shout,   Though I think meself, in the subsequent rout,   That us bein' thin, an' him bein' stout,   In the middle of pushin' an' shovin' about,     He--MUST HAVE FELL OFF THE ICE.'  'That won't do, you know,' began the Puddin', but Sam said hurriedly, 'It was very dark, and there's no sayin' at this date what happened.'  'Yes there is,' said the Puddin', 'for I had my eye on the whole affair, and it's my belief that if he hadn't been so round you'd have never rolled him off the iceberg, for you was both singin' out \"Yo heave Ho\" for half an hour, an' him trying to hold on to Bill's beard.'  [Illustration]  'In the haste of the moment,' said Bill, 'he may have got a bit of a shove, for the ice bein' slippy, and us bein' justly enraged, and him bein' as round as a barrel, he may, as I said, have been too fat to save himself from rollin' off the iceberg. The point, however, is immaterial to our story, which concerns this Puddin'; and this Puddin',' said Bill patting him on the basin, 'was the very Puddin' that Curry and Rice invented on the iceberg.'  'He must have been a very clever cook,' said Bunyip.  'He was, poor feller, he was,' said Bill, greatly affected. 'For plum duff or Irish stoo there wasn't his equal in the land. But enough of these sad subjects. Pausin' only to explain that me an' Sam got off the iceberg on a homeward bound chicken coop, landed on Tierra del Fuego, walked to Valparaiso, and so got home, I will proceed to enliven the occasion with \"The Ballad of the Bo'sun's Bride\".'  And without more ado, Bill, who had one of those beef-and-thunder voices, roared out--    'Ho, aboard the _Salt Junk Sarah_     We was rollin' homeward bound,   When the bo'sun's bride fell over the side     And very near got drowned.   Rollin' home, rollin' home,   Rollin' home across the foam,     She had to swim to save her glim   And catch us rollin' home.'  It was a very long song, so the rest of it is left out here, but there was a great deal of rolling and roaring in it, and they all joined in the chorus. They were all singing away at the top of their pipe, as Bill called it, when round a bend in the road they came on two low-looking persons hiding behind a tree. One was a Possum, with one of those sharp, snooting, snouting sort of faces, and the other was a bulbous, boozy-looking Wombat in an old long-tailed coat, and a hat that marked him down as a man you couldn't trust in the fowlyard. They were busy sharpening up a carving knife on a portable grind-stone, but the moment they caught sight of the travellers the Possum whipped the knife behind him and the Wombat put his hat over the grindstone.  Bill Barnacle flew into a passion at these signs of treachery.  'I see you there,' he shouted.  'You can't see all of us,' shouted the Possum, and the Wombat added, ''Cause why, some of us is behind the tree.'  [Illustration]  Bill led the others aside, in order to hold a consultation.  'What on earth's to be done?' he said.  'We shall have to fight them, as usual,' said Sam.  'Why do you have to fight them?' asked Bunyip Bluegum.  'Because they're after our Puddin',' said Bill.  'They're after our Puddin',' explained Sam, 'because they're professional puddin'-thieves.'  'And as we're perfessional Puddin'-owners,' said Bill, 'we have to fight them on principle. The fighting,' he added, 'is a mere flea-bite, as the sayin' goes. The trouble is, what's to be done with the Puddin'?'  'While you do the fighting,' said Bunyip bravely, 'I shall mind the Puddin'.'  'The trouble is,' said Bill, 'that this is a very secret, crafty Puddin', an' if you wasn't up to his game he'd be askin' you to look at a spider an' then run away while your back is turned.'  'That's right,' said the Puddin', gloomily. 'Take a Puddin's character away. Don't mind his feelings.'  [Illustration]  'We don't mind your feelin's, Albert,' said Bill. 'What we minds is your treacherous 'abits.' But Bunyip Bluegum said, 'Why not turn him upside-down and sit on him?'  [Illustration]  'What a brutal suggestion,' said the Puddin'; but no notice was taken of his objections, and as soon as he was turned safely upside-down, Bill and Sam ran straight at the puddin'-thieves and commenced sparring up at them with the greatest activity.  'Put 'em up, ye puddin'-snatchers,' shouted Bill. 'Don't keep us sparrin' up here all day. Come out an' take your gruel while you've got the chance.'  The Possum wished to turn the matter off by saying, 'I see the price of eggs has gone up again', but Bill gave him a punch on the snout that bent it like a carrot, and Sam caught the Wombat such a flip with his flapper that he gave in at once.  'I shan't be able to fight any more this afternoon,' said the Wombat, 'as I've got sore feet.' The Possum said hurriedly, 'We shall be late for that appointment', and they took their grindstone and off they went.  [Illustration]  But when they were a safe distance away the Possum sang out: 'You'll repent this conduct. You'll repent bending a man's snout so that he can hardly see over it, let alone breathe through it with comfort', and the Wombat added, 'For shame, flapping a man with sore feet.'  'We laugh with scorn at threats,' said Bill, and he added as a warning--    'I don't repent a snout that's bent,     And if again I tap it,   Oh, with a clout I'll bend that snout     With force enough to snap it.'  and Sam added for the Wombat's benefit--    'I take no shame to fight the lame   When they deserve to cop it.   So do not try to pipe your eye,   Or with my flip I'll flop it.'  [Illustration]  The puddin'-thieves disappeared over the hill and, as the evening happened to come down rather suddenly at that moment, Bill said, 'Business bein' over for the day, now's the time to set about makin' the camp fire.'  This was a welcome suggestion, for, as all travellers know, if you don't sit by a camp fire in the evening, you have to sit by nothing in the dark, which is a most unsociable way of spending your time. They found a comfortable nook under the hedge, where there were plenty of dry leaves to rest on, and there they built a fire, and put the billy on, and made tea. The tea and sugar and three tin cups and half a pound of mixed biscuits were brought out of the bag by Sam, while Bill cut slices of steak-and-kidney from the Puddin'. After that they had boiled jam-roll and apple-dumpling, as the fancy took them, for if you wanted a change of food from the Puddin', all you had to do was to whistle twice and turn the basin round.  After they had eaten as much as they wanted, the things were put away in the bag, and they settled down comfortably for the evening.  'This is what I call grand,' said Bill, cutting up his tobacco. 'Full-and-plenty to eat, pipes goin' and the evenin's enjoyment before us. Tune up on the mouth-organ, Sam, an' off she goes with a song.'  They had a mouth-organ in the bag which they took turns at playing, and Bill led off with a song which he said was called--  [Illustration]  [Illustration]  SPANISH GOLD    'When I was young I used to hold     I'd run away to sea,   And be a Pirate brave and bold     On the coast of Caribbee.    'For I sez to meself, \"I'll fill me hold   With Spanish silver and Spanish gold,   And out of every ship I sink   I'll collar the best of food and drink.    '\"For Caribbee, or Barbaree,   Or the shores of South Amerikee   Are all the same to a Pirate bold,   Whose thoughts are fixed on Spanish gold.\"    'So one fine day I runs away     A Pirate for to be;   But I found there was never a Pirate left     On the coast of Caribbee.    'For Pirates go, but their next of kin   Are Merchant Captains, hard as sin,   And Merchant Mates as hard as nails   Aboard of every ship"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23625"],["title","The Magic Pudding (#2)"],["body"," sails.    'And I worked aloft and I worked below,   I worked wherever I had to go,   And the winds blew hard and the winds blew cold,   And I sez to meself as the ship she rolled,    '\"O Caribbee! O Barbaree!   O shores of South Amerikee!   O, never go there: if the truth be told,   You'll get more kicks than Spanish gold.\"'  [Illustration]  'And that's the truth, mate,' said Bill to Bunyip Bluegum. 'There ain't no pirates nowadays at sea, except western ocean First Mates, and many's the bootin' I've had for not takin' in the slack of the topsail halyards fast enough to suit their fancy. It's a hard life, the sea, and Sam here'll bear me out when I say that bein' hit on the head with a belayin' pin while tryin' to pick up the weather earing is an experience that no man wants twice. But toon up, and a song all round.'  [Illustration]  'I shall sing you the \"Penguin Bold\",' said Sam, and, striking a graceful attitude, he sang this song--    'To see the penguin out at sea,     And watch how he behaves,   Would prove that penguins cannot be     And never shall be slaves.   You haven't got a notion   How penguins brave the ocean     And laugh with scorn at waves.    'To see the penguin at his ease     Performing fearful larks   With stingarees of all degrees,     As well as whales and sharks;   The sight would quickly let you know   The great contempt that penguins show     For stingarees and sharks.  [Illustration]    'O see the penguin as he goes     A-turning Catherine wheels,   Without repose upon the nose     Of walruses and seals.   But bless your heart, a penguin feels   Supreme contempt for foolish seals,     While he never fails, where'er he goes,     To turn back-flaps on a walrus nose.'  'It's all very fine,' said the Puddin' gloomily, 'singing about the joys of being penguins and pirates, but how'd you like to be a Puddin' and be eaten all day long?'  And in a very gruff voice he sang as follows:--    'O, who would be a puddin',     A puddin' in a pot,   A puddin' which is stood on     A fire which is hot?   O sad indeed the lot   Of puddin's in a pot.    'I wouldn't be a puddin'     If I could be a bird,   If I could be a wooden     Doll, I would'n say a word.   Yes, I have often heard   It's grand to be a bird.    'But as I am a puddin',     A puddin' in a pot,   I hope you get the stomach ache     For eatin' me a lot.   I hope you get it hot,   You puddin'-eatin' lot!'  'Very well sung, Albert,' said Bill encouragingly, 'though you're a trifle husky in your undertones, which is no doubt due to the gravy in your innards. However, as a reward for bein' a bright little feller we shall have a slice of you all round before turnin' in for the night.'  So they whistled up the plum-duff side of the Puddin', and had supper. When that was done, Bill stood up and made a speech to Bunyip Bluegum.  'I am now about to put before you an important proposal,' said Bill. 'Here you are, a young intelligent feller, goin' about seein' the world by yourself. Here is Sam an' me, two as fine fellers as ever walked, goin' about the world with a Puddin'. My proposal to you is--Join us, and become a member of the Noble Society of Puddin'-owners. The duties of the Society,' went on Bill, 'are light. The members are required to wander along the roads, indulgin' in conversation, song and story, eatin' at regular intervals at the Puddin'. And now, what's your answer?'  'My answer,' said Bunyip Bluegum, 'is, Done with you.' And, shaking hands warmly all round, they loudly sang--  THE PUDDIN'-OWNERS' ANTHEM    'The solemn word is plighted,     The solemn tale is told,   We swear to stand united,     Three puddin'-owners bold.    'When we with rage assemble,   Let puddin'-snatchers groan;   Let puddin'-burglars tremble,     They'll ne'er our puddin' own.    'Hurrah for puddin'-owning,     Hurrah for Friendship's hand,   The puddin'-thieves are groaning     To see our noble band.    'Hurrah, we'll stick together,     And always bear in mind   To eat our puddin' gallantly,     Whenever we're inclined.'  [Illustration]  Having given three rousing cheers, they shook hands once more and turned in for the night. After such a busy day, walking, talking, fighting, singing, and eating puddin', they were all asleep in a pig's whisper.     Second Slice   The Society of Puddin'-owners were up bright and early next morning, and had the billy on and tea made before six o'clock, which is the best part of the day, because the world has just had his face washed, and the air smells like Pears' soap.  'Aha,' said Bill Barnacle, cutting up slices of the Puddin', 'this is what I call grand. Here we are, after a splendid night's sleep on dry leaves, havin' a smokin' hot slice of steak-and-kidney for breakfast round the camp fire. What could be more delightful?'  'What indeed?' said Bunyip Bluegum sipping tea.  'Why, as I always say,' said Bill, 'if there's one thing more entrancin' than sittin' round a camp fire in the evenin' it's sitting round a camp fire in the mornin'. No bed and blankets and breakfast tables for Bill Barnacle. For as I says in my \"Breakfast Ballad\"--    'If there's anythin' better than lyin' on leaves,     It's risin' from leaves at dawnin',   If there's anythin' better than sleepin' at eve,     It's wakin' up in the mawnin'.    'If there's anythin' better than camp firelight,     It's bright sunshine on wakin'.   If there's anythin' better than puddin' at night,     It's puddin' when day is breakin'.    'If there's anythin' better than singin' away     While the stars are gaily shinin',   Why, it's singin' a song at dawn of day,     On puddin' for breakfast dinin'.'  [Illustration]  There was a hearty round of applause at this song, for as Bunyip Bluegum remarked, 'Singing at breakfast should certainly be more commonly indulged in, as it greatly tends to enliven what is on most occasions a somewhat dull proceeding.'  'One of the great advantages of being a professional Puddin'-owner,' said Sam Sawnoff, 'is that songs at breakfast are always encouraged. None of the ordinary breakfast rules, such as scowling while eating, and saying the porridge is as stiff as glue and the eggs are as tough as leather, are observed. Instead, songs, roars of laughter, and boisterous jests are the order of the day. For example, this sort of thing,' added Sam, doing a rapid back-flap and landing with a thump on Bill's head. As Bill was unprepared for this act of boisterous humour, his face was pushed into the Puddin' with great violence, and the gravy was splashed in his eye.  [Illustration]  'What d'yer mean, playin' such bungfoodlin' tricks on a man at breakfast?' roared Bill.  'What d'yer mean,' shouted the Puddin', 'playing such foodbungling tricks on a Puddin' being breakfasted at?'  'Breakfast humour, Bill, merely breakfast humour,' said Sam hastily.  'Humour's humour,' shouted Bill, 'but puddin' in the whiskers is no joke.'  'Whiskers in the Puddin' is worse than puddin' in the whiskers,' shouted the Puddin', standing up in his basin.  'Observe the rules, Bill,' said Sam hurriedly. 'Boisterous humour at the breakfast table must be greeted with roars of laughter.'  'To Jeredelum with the rules,' shouted Bill. 'Pushing a man's face into his own breakfast is beyond rules or reason, and deserves a punch in the gizzard.'  Seeing matters arriving at this unpromising situation, Bunyip Bluegum interposed by saying, 'Rather than allow this happy occasion to be marred by unseemly recriminations, let us, while admitting that our admirable friend, Sam, may have unwittingly disturbed the composure of our admirable friend, Bill, at the expense of our admirable Puddin's gravy, let us, I say, by the simple act of extending the hand of friendship, dispel in an instant these gathering clouds of disruption. In the words of the poem--    'Then let the fist of Friendship     Be kept for Friendship's foes.   Ne'er let that hand in anger land     On Friendship's holy nose.'  These fine sentiments at once dispelled Bill's anger. He shook hands warmly with Sam, wiped the gravy from his face, and resumed breakfast with every appearance of hearty good humour.  The meal over, the breakfast things were put away in the bag, Sam and Bill took Puddin' between them, and all set off along the road, enlivening the way with song and story. Bill regaled them with portions of the 'Ballad of the _Salt Junk Sarah_', which is one of those songs that go on for ever. Its great advantage, as Bill remarked, was that as it hadn't got an ending it didn't need a beginning, so you could start it anywhere.  'As for instance,' said Bill, and he roared out--    'Ho, aboard the _Salt Junk Sarah_,   Rollin' home across the line,   The Bo'sun collared the Captain's hat   And threw it in the brine.   Rollin' home, rollin' home,   Rollin' home across the foam,   The Captain sat without a hat   The whole way rollin' home.'  [Illustration]  Entertaining themselves in this way as they strolled along, they were presently arrested by shouts of 'Fire! Fire!' and a Fireman in a large helmet came bolting down the road, pulling a fire hose behind him.  'Aha!' said Bill. 'Now we shall have the awe-inspirin' spectacle of a fire to entertain us,' and, accosting the Fireman, he demanded to know where the fire was.  'The fact is,' said the Fireman, 'that owing to the size of this helmet I can't see where it is; but if you will kindly glance at the surrounding district, you'll see it about somewhere.'  They glanced about and, sure enough, there was a fire burning in the next field. It was only a cowshed, certainly, but it was blazing very nicely, and well worth looking at.  'Fire,' said Bill, 'in the form of a common cowshed, is burnin' about nor'-nor'-east as the crow flies.'  'In that case,' said the Fireman, 'I invite all present bravely to assist in putting it out. But,' he added impressively, 'if you'll take my advice, you'll shove that Puddin' in this hollow log and roll a stone agen the end to keep him in,"]]]
