The _London Gazette_ surprised the world one day by the announcement that the Queen had become pregnant, and upon June 10, 1688, she gave birth to a son.  It need hardly be told now that the wildest commotion was raised by the birth of the prince. The great majority of the Protestants insinuated, or stoutly declared, that the alleged heir-apparent was not a child of the Queen.  The story was that a newly-born child, the son of a poor miller, had been brought into the Queen's room in a warming-pan, and passed off as the son of the Queen.  It was said that Father Petre, a Catholic clergyman, had been instrumental in carrying out this contrivance, and therefore the enemies of the royal family talked of the young prince as Perkin or Petrelin.  The warming-pan was one of the most familiar objects in satirical literature and art for many generations after.  {10} A whole school of caricature was heated into life, if we may use such an expression, by this fabulous warming-pan.  Warming-pans were associated with brass money and wooden shoes in the mouths and minds of Whig partisans, down to a day not very far remote from our own.  Mr. Jobson, the vulgar lawyer in Scott's \"Rob Roy,\" talks rudely to Diana Vernon, a Catholic, about \"King William, of glorious and immortal memory, our immortal deliverer from Papists and pretenders, and wooden shoes and warming-pans.\"  \"Sad things those wooden shoes and warming-pans,\" retorted the young lady, who seemed to take pleasure in augmenting his wrath; \"and it is a comfort you don't seem to want a warming-pan at present, Mr. Jobson.\"  There was not, of course, the slightest foundation for the absurd story about the spurious heir to the throne. Some little excuse was given for the spread of such a tale by the mere fact that there had been delay in summoning the proper officials to be present at the birth; but despite all the pains Bishop Burnet takes to make the report seem trustworthy, it may be doubted whether any one whose opinion was worth having seriously believed in the story, even at the time, and it soon ceased to have any believers at all.  At the time, however, it was accepted as an article of faith by a large proportion of the outer public; and the supposed Jesuit plot and the supposed warming-pan served as missiles with which to pelt the supporters of the Stuarts, until long after there had ceased to be the slightest chance whatever of a Stuart restoration.  This story of a spurious heir to a throne repeats itself at various intervals of history.  The child of Napoleon the First and Maria Louisa was believed by many Legitimist partisans to be supposititious.  In our own days there were many intelligent persons in France firmly convinced that the unfortunate Prince Louis Napoleon, who was killed in Zululand, was not the son of the Empress of the French, but that he was the son of her sister, the Duchess of Alva, and that he was merely palmed off on the French {11} people in order to secure the stability of the Bonapartist throne.  [Sidenote: 1714--The \"Old Pretender\"]  James Stuart was born, as we have said, on June 10, 1688, and was therefore still in his twenty-sixth year at the time when this history begins.  Soon after his birth his mother hurried with him to France to escape the coming troubles, and his father presently followed discrowned.  He had led an unhappy life--unhappy all the more because of the incessant dissipation with which he tried to enliven it.  He is described as tall, meagre, and melancholy.  Although not strikingly like Charles the First or Charles the Second, he had unmistakably the Stuart aspect.  Horace Walpole said of him many years after that, \"without the particular features of any Stuart, the Chevalier has the strong lines and fatality of air peculiar to them all.\"  The words \"fatality of air\" describe very expressively that look of melancholy which all the Stuart features wore when in repose.  The melancholy look represented an underlying habitual mood of melancholy, or even despondency, which a close observer may read in the character of the \"merry monarch\" himself, for all his mirth and his dissipation, just as well as in that of Charles the First or of James the Second.  The profligacy of Charles the Second had little that was joyous in it. James Stuart, the Chevalier, had not the abilities and the culture of Charles the Second, and he had much the same taste for intrigue and dissipation.  His amours were already beginning to be a scandal, and he drank now and then like a man determined at all cost to drown thought. He was always the slave of women.  Women knew all his secrets, and were made acquainted with his projected political enterprises.  Sometimes the fair favorite to whom he had unbosomed himself blabbed and tattled all over Versailles or Paris of what she had heard, and in some instances, perhaps, she even took her newly-acquired knowledge to the English Ambassador and disposed of it for a consideration.  At this time James Stuart is not yet married; but marriage made as little {12} difference in his way of living as it had done in that of his elderly political rival, George the Elector.  It is strange that James Stuart should have made so faint an impression upon history and upon literature.  Romance and poetry, which have done so much for his son, \"Bonnie Prince Charlie,\" have taken hardly any account of him.  He figures in Thackeray's \"Esmond,\" but the picture is not made very distinct, even by that master of portraiture, and the merely frivolous side of his character is presented with disproportionate prominence. James Stuart had stronger qualities for good or evil than Thackeray seems to have found in him.  Some of his contemporaries denied him the credit of man's ordinary courage; he has even been accused of positive cowardice; but there does not seem to be the slightest ground for such an accusation.  Studied with the severest eye, his various enterprises, and the manner in which he bore himself throughout them, would seem to prove that he had courage enough for any undertaking.  Princes seldom show any want of physical courage.  They are trained from their very birth to regard themselves as always on parade; and even if they should feel their hearts give way in presence of danger, they are not likely to allow it to be seen.  It was not lack of personal bravery that marred the chances of James Stuart.  [Sidenote: 1714--Anne's sympathies]  It is only doing bare justice to one whose character and career have met with little favor from history, contemporary or recent, to say that James might have made his way to the throne with comparative ease if he would only consent to change his religion and become a Protestant.  It was again and again pressed upon him by English adherents, and even by statesmen in power--by Oxford and by Bolingbroke--that if he could not actually become a Protestant he should at least pretend to become one, and give up all outward show of his devotion to the Catholic Church. James steadily and decisively refused to be guilty of any meanness so ignoble and detestable.  His conduct in thus adhering to his convictions, even at {13} the cost of a throne, has been contrasted with that of Henry the Fourth, who declared Paris to be \"well worth a mass!\"  But some injustice has been done to Henry the Fourth in regard to his conversion.  Henry's great Protestant minister, Sully, urged him to become an open and professing Catholic, on the ground that he had always been a Catholic more or less consciously and in his heart. Sully gave Henry several evidences, drawn from his observation of Henry's own demeanor, to prove to him that his natural inclinations and the turn of his intellect always led him towards the Catholic faith, commenting shrewdly on the fact that he had seen Henry cross himself more than once on the field of battle in the presence of danger.  Thus, according to Sully, Henry the Fourth, in professing himself a Catholic, would be only following the bent of his own natural inclinations. However that may be, it is still the fact that Henry the Fourth, by changing his profession of religion, succeeded in obtaining a crown, and that James the Pretender, by refusing to hear of such a change, lost his best chance of a throne.  What were Anne's own inclinations with regard to the succession?  There cannot be much doubt as to the way her personal feelings went.  There is a history of the reign of Queen Anne, written by Dr. Thomas Somerville, \"one of His Majesty's Chaplains in Ordinary,\" and published in 1798, with a dedication \"by permission\" to the King.  It is called on its title-page \"The History of Great Britain during the Reign of Queen Anne, with a Dissertation Concerning the Danger of the Protestant Succession.\"  Such an author, writing comparatively soon after the events, and in a book dedicated to the reigning king, was not likely to do any conscious injustice to the memory of Queen Anne, and was especially likely to take a fair view of the influence which her personal inclinations were calculated to have on the succession.  Dr. Somerville declares with great justice that \"mildness, timidity, and anxiety were constitutional ingredients in the temper\" of Queen Anne. This very timidity, this very anxiety, {14} appears, according to Dr. Somerville's judgment, to have worked favorably for the Hanoverian succession.  [Sidenote: 1714--James the Third] The Queen herself, by sentiment, and by what may be called a sort of superstition, leaned much towards the Stuarts.  \"The loss,\" says Dr. Somerville, \"of all her children bore the aspect of an angry Providence adjusting punishment to the nature and quality of her offence.\"  Her offence, of course, was the part she had taken in helping to dethrone her father.  \"Wounded in spirit, and prone to superstition, she naturally thought of the restitution of the crown to her brother as the only atonement she could make to the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2347"],["title","The Adventure of the Dying Detective (#1)"],["body"," speech, so far removed from his usual suavity, showed me how deep was the disorganization of his mind.  Of all ruins, that of a noble mind is the most deplorable.  I sat in silent dejection until the stipulated time had passed.  He seemed to have been watching the clock as well as I, for it was hardly six before he began to talk with the same feverish animation as before.  \"Now, Watson,\" said he.  \"Have you any change in your pocket?\"  \"Yes.\"  \"Any silver?\"  \"A good deal.\"  \"How many half-crowns?\"  \"I have five.\"  \"Ah, too few!  Too few!  How very unfortunate, Watson!  However, such as they are you can put them in your watchpocket.  And all the rest of your money in your left trouser pocket.  Thank you. It will balance you so much better like that.\"  This was raving insanity.  He shuddered, and again made a sound between a cough and a sob.  \"You will now light the gas, Watson, but you will be very careful that not for one instant shall it be more than half on.  I implore you to be careful, Watson.  Thank you, that is excellent. No, you need not draw the blind.  Now you will have the kindness to place some letters and papers upon this table within my reach. Thank you.  Now some of that litter from the mantelpiece. Excellent, Watson!  There is a sugar-tongs there.  Kindly raise that small ivory box with its assistance.  Place it here among the papers.  Good!  You can now go and fetch Mr. Culverton Smith, of 13 Lower Burke Street.\"  To tell the truth, my desire to fetch a doctor had somewhat weakened, for poor Holmes was so obviously delirious that it seemed dangerous to leave him.  However, he was as eager now to consult the person named as he had been obstinate in refusing.  \"I never heard the name,\" said I.  \"Possibly not, my good Watson.  It may surprise you to know that the man upon earth who is best versed in this disease is not a medical man, but a planter.  Mr. Culverton Smith is a well-known resident of Sumatra, now visiting London.  An outbreak of the disease upon his plantation, which was distant from medical aid, caused him to study it himself, with some rather far-reaching consequences.  He is a very methodical person, and I did not desire you to start before six, because I was well aware that you would not find him in his study.  If you could persuade him to come here and give us the benefit of his unique experience of this disease, the investigation of which has been his dearest hobby, I cannot doubt that he could help me.\"  I gave Holmes's remarks as a consecutive whole and will not attempt to indicate how they were interrupted by gaspings for breath and those clutchings of his hands which indicated the pain from which he was suffering.  His appearance had changed for the worse during the few hours that I had been with him.  Those hectic spots were more pronounced, the eyes shone more brightly out of darker hollows, and a cold sweat glimmered upon his brow. He still retained, however, the jaunty gallantry of his speech. To the last gasp he would always be the master.  \"You will tell him exactly how you have left me,\" said he.  \"You will convey the very impression which is in your own mind--a dying man--a dying and delirious man.  Indeed, I cannot think why the whole bed of the ocean is not one solid mass of oysters, so prolific the creatures seem.  Ah, I am wandering!  Strange how the brain controls the brain! What was I saying, Watson?\"  \"My directions for Mr. Culverton Smith.\"  \"Ah, yes, I remember.  My life depends upon it.  Plead with him, Watson.  There is no good feeling between us.  His nephew, Watson--I had suspicions of foul play and I allowed him to see it.  The boy died horribly.  He has a grudge against me.  You will soften him, Watson. Beg him, pray him, get him here by any means.  He can save me--only he!\"  \"I will bring him in a cab, if I have to carry him down to it.\"  \"You will do nothing of the sort.  You will persuade him to come. And then you will return in front of him.  Make any excuse so as not to come with him.  Don't forget, Watson.  You won't fail me. You never did fail me.  No doubt there are natural enemies which limit the increase of the creatures.  You and I, Watson, we have done our part.  Shall the world, then, be overrun by oysters? No, no; horrible!  You'll convey all that is in your mind.\"  I left him full of the image of this magnificent intellect babbling like a foolish child.  He had handed me the key, and with a happy thought I took it with me lest he should lock himself in.  Mrs. Hudson was waiting, trembling and weeping, in the passage.  Behind me as I passed from the flat I heard Holmes's high, thin voice in some delirious chant.  Below, as I stood whistling for a cab, a man came on me through the fog.  \"How is Mr. Holmes, sir?\" he asked.  It was an old acquaintance, Inspector Morton, of Scotland Yard, dressed in unofficial tweeds.  \"He is very ill,\" I answered.  He looked at me in a most singular fashion.  Had it not been too fiendish, I could have imagined that the gleam of the fanlight showed exultation in his face.  \"I heard some rumour of it,\" said he.  The cab had driven up, and I left him.  Lower Burke Street proved to be a line of fine houses lying in the vague borderland between Notting Hill and Kensington.  The particular one at which my cabman pulled up had an air of smug and demure respectability in its old-fashioned iron railings, its massive folding-door, and its shining brasswork.  All was in keeping with a solemn butler who appeared framed in the pink radiance of a tinted electrical light behind him.  \"Yes, Mr. Culverton Smith is in.  Dr. Watson!  Very good, sir, I will take up your card.\"  My humble name and title did not appear to impress Mr. Culverton Smith. Through the half-open door I heard a high, petulant, penetrating voice.  \"Who is this person?  What does he want?  Dear me, Staples, how often have I said that I am not to be disturbed in my hours of study?\"  There came a gentle flow of soothing explanation from the butler.  \"Well, I won't see him, Staples.  I can't have my work interrupted like this.  I am not at home.  Say so.  Tell him to come in the morning if he really must see me.\"  Again the gentle murmur.  \"Well, well, give him that message.  He can come in the morning, or he can stay away.  My work must not be hindered.\"  I thought of Holmes tossing upon his bed of sickness and counting the minutes, perhaps, until I could bring help to him.  It was not a time to stand upon ceremony.  His life depended upon my promptness.  Before the apologetic butler had delivered his message I had pushed past him and was in the room.  With a shrill cry of anger a man rose from a reclining chair beside the fire.  I saw a great yellow face, coarse-grained and greasy, with heavy, double-chin, and two sullen, menacing gray eyes which glared at me from under tufted and sandy brows.  A high bald head had a small velvet smoking-cap poised coquettishly upon one side of its pink curve. The skull was of enormous capacity, and yet as I looked down I saw to my amazement that the figure of the man was small and frail, twisted in the shoulders and back like one who has suffered from rickets in his childhood.  \"What's this?\" he cried in a high, screaming voice.  \"What is the meaning of this intrusion?  Didn't I send you word that I would see you to-morrow morning?\"  \"I am sorry,\" said I, \"but the matter cannot be delayed.  Mr. Sherlock Holmes--\"  The mention of my friend's name had an extraordinary effect upon the little man.  The look of anger passed in an instant from his face.  His features became tense and alert.  \"Have you come from Holmes?\" he asked.  \"I have just left him.\"  \"What about Holmes?  How is he?\"  \"He is desperately ill.  That is why I have come.\"  The man motioned me to a chair, and turned to resume his own.  As he did so I caught a glimpse of his face in the mirror over the mantelpiece.  I could have sworn that it was set in a malicious and abominable smile.  Yet I persuaded myself that it must have been some nervous contraction which I had surprised, for he turned to me an instant later with genuine concern upon his features.  \"I am sorry to hear this,\" said he.  \"I only know Mr. Holmes through some business dealings which we have had, but I have every respect for his talents and his character.  He is an amateur of crime, as I am of disease.  For him the villain, for me the microbe. There are my prisons,\" he continued, pointing to a row of bottles and jars which stood upon a side table. \"Among those gelatine cultivations some of the very worst offenders in the world are now doing time.\"  \"It was on account of your special knowledge that Mr. Holmes desired to see you.  He has a high opinion of you and thought that you were the one man in London who could help him.\"  The little man started, and the jaunty smoking-cap slid to the floor.  \"Why?\" he asked.  \"Why should Mr. Homes think that I could help him in his trouble?\"  \"Because of your knowledge of Eastern diseases.\"  \"But why should he think that this disease which he has contracted is Eastern?\"  \"Because, in some professional inquiry, he has been working among Chinese sailors down in the docks.\"  Mr. Culverton Smith smiled pleasantly and picked up his smoking-cap.  \"Oh, that's it--is it?\" said he.  \"I trust the matter is not so grave as you suppose.  How long has he been ill?\"  \"About three days.\"  \"Is he delirious?\"  \"Occasionally.\"  \"Tut, tut!  This sounds serious.  It would be inhuman not to answer his call.  I very much resent any interruption to my work, Dr. Watson, but this case is certainly exceptional.  I will come with you at once.\"  I remembered Holmes's injunction.  \"I have another appointment,\" said I.  \"Very good.  I will go alone.  I have a note of Mr. Holmes's address. You can rely upon my being there within half an hour at most.\"  It was with a sinking heart that I reentered Holmes's bedroom. For all that I knew the worst might have happened in my absence.
