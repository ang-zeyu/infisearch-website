[Illustration]     THE BEAR'S PAW.  [Illustration]   One day a peasant saw a bear asleep in the forest, so he crept up to him and cut off one of his hind paws with an axe. And he brought the paw home, and said to his wife: \"Boil some soup from the flesh, and knit some warm gloves out of the wool.\" So she took off the skin, threw the flesh into the pot to boil, and sat down to spin the wool.  And when Bruin woke up, he found his paw gone. There was no help for it, so he cut a bit of wood off a tree, hewed it, tied it on instead of his leg, and set out for the village. As he went along he sang:  [Illustration]    \"Hobble, hobble, hobble,   On my lime-tree leg,   On my birchen crutch!   The water's asleep,   And the earth's asleep,   The whole village is asleep,   Only one woman's awake,   And she's boiling my flesh,   Sitting on my skin,   And spinning my wool!\"  [Illustration]  And the peasant's wife got very frightened, and hid as quick as she could in the cellar under the floor. And Bruin went into the house, and saw there was no one there. So he took his bit of skin, got his flesh out of the pot and made off.  [Illustration]  [Illustration: May I?]     THE BEAR AND THE OLD MAN'S DAUGHTERS.   There was once an old man and he had three little daughters, and one day he said to them: \"I am going out into the fields to plough, and you, my little daughters, bake me a loaf and bring it to me.\" \"But how are we to find you, daddy?\" they said.  [Illustration]  [Illustration]  \"As I go along,\" he said, \"I shall drop shavings in a row along the path, and that will help you to find me.\" And as the old man rode along he threw down the shavings one after the other, and a bear came and drew them all aside on to the path that led to his den.  [Illustration]  [Illustration]  Then the eldest daughter said to the youngest: \"Go and take the bread to daddy.\" And the youngest said: \"But how am I to find daddy, and where am I to take the bread to?\" Then the eldest answered: \"He kept dropping shavings in a row along the path as he went.\" Then she took the loaf, and started off to follow the shavings, when lo and behold! she came to the bear's den.  [Illustration]  [Illustration]  And the bear saw her and said: \"O-ho! What a nice little girl has come to see me!\"  [Illustration]  The next day the old man went off to sow, and he said to his daughters: \"My dear little daughters, my clever little ones, bake me a loaf and bring it to me in the field.\" \"But how are we to find you, daddy?\" they said. And he answered: \"Yesterday I threw one row of shavings down, to-day I will throw two.\" And he set off, throwing the shavings down in two rows, and the bear came and drew them all aside on to the path that led to his den. Then the second daughter started out with the loaf, following the shavings, and went straight to the bear's den. And the bear saw her and said: \"O-ho! here's another little girl come to see me!\"  [Illustration]  [Illustration]  The next day the old man went off to the field to harrow, and he said to his daughter: \"My dear little daughter, bake me a loaf and bring it to me in the field. I will throw three rows of shavings.\" And the old man went off, throwing the shavings down in three rows, and the bear came and drew them all aside on to the path that led to his den. And the eldest daughter set out, and she, too, came to the bear's den. And the bear saw her and said: \"O-ho! here's a third little girl come to see me in my den!\" And there they went on living, when one day the eldest sister said: \"Bruin, Bruin, I'll bake some pies, and you take them and give them to my daddy to eat.\" \"All right,\" answered the bear, \"I'll take them.\" And so she popped her youngest sister into a sack, and said: \"Here, Bruin, take this to my daddy, and mind, don't you eat it yourself on the way!\" And the bear took the sack and set off with it to the old man. And as he went along, he kept saying to himself: \"Suppose I sit down on a stump, and suppose I just eat one little pie!\" And the youngest daughter in the sack heard him and said: \"Don't sit down on a stump, don't! Don't eat a pie, don't!\" And the bear thought that this was the eldest sister, and said to himself: \"There now, fancy that! I've come a long way, and yet she can still hear me!\" And he brought the sack right up to the old man's courtyard, when the dogs all rushed out and began to bark at him! So he flung down the sack and ran off home. And the eldest sister asked him: \"Did they make you welcome, Bruin, and give you nice things to eat?\" \"They didn't give me anything to eat,\" he answered, \"but their welcome was loud enough.\"  [Illustration]  [Illustration]  [Illustration]  The next day the eldest sister said: \"Bruin, take my daddy some more pies to eat!\" And she tied up her other sister in the sack, and the bear put it on his back and carried it off into the village. And as he went through the forest he kept saying to himself: \"Suppose I sit down on a stump, and suppose I just eat one little pie!\" And the second daughter said to him from out of the sack: \"Don't sit down on a stump, don't! Don't eat a pie, don't!\" And the bear thought: \"There now, fancy that! I've come a long way, and yet she can still hear me, and tells me not to eat a pie!\" And so he reached the old man's courtyard, and when the dogs went for him that time, they all but worried him to death! So he flung down the sack and ran off home. And the eldest sister asked him: \"Did they welcome you warmly, Bruin, and give you plenty to eat?\" \"It was _such_ a warm welcome, and they gave me so much to eat, that I shan't forget it in a hurry!\" he answered.  [Illustration]  [Illustration]  [Illustration]  And the next day the eldest girl said: \"I'll bake some more pies, and you take them to my daddy for him to eat.\" And so she herself sat down in the sack, and the bear carried her off. And as he carried her along he kept saying to himself: \"Oh, I _should_ so like to sit down on a stump, and I _should_ so like to eat one little pie!\" And the eldest daughter said to him from out of the sack: \"Don't sit down on a stump, don't! Don't eat a pie, don't!\" And the bear thought: \"There now, fancy that! Look at the long way I've come, and yet she can still see and hear me!\" And so he brought the sack to the old man, and then the dogs came upon him and all but tore him in bits. And he ran off into the forest without as much as looking round, and the old man began once more to live with his three little daughters.  [Illustration]  [Illustration: I don't like what is nice, but what I like _is_ nice!]     THE STRAW OX.  [Illustration]  [Illustration]  [Illustration]   Once upon a time there lived an old man and his wife, and one day she said to him: \"Make me a straw ox and smear him over with pitch.\" And he asked: \"What for?\" And she answered: \"Do what I tell you! Never mind what it's for--that's my business!\" So the old man made a straw ox and smeared him over with pitch. Then his wife got ready in the early morning and drove the ox to pasture. She sat down under a tree, and began spinning flax and saying to herself: \"Feed, feed, ox, on the fresh green grass. Feed, feed, ox, on the fresh green grass!\" And she went on spinning and spinning, and fell asleep. Suddenly from out of the thick wood, from out of the dark forest, a bear came running, and ran right up against the ox. \"Who in the world are you?\" he asked. And the ox answered: \"I'm the three-year-old ox, all made of straw and smeared over with pitch.\" Then the bear said: \"Well, if you're smeared over with pitch, give me some to put on my poor torn side.\" And the ox answered: \"Take some!\" So the bear seized hold of the ox, when lo and behold! his paw stuck in the pitch. And when he tried to free it with the other paw, that one stuck too. Then he started gnawing with his teeth, and they stuck too. He couldn't tear himself away anyhow. And the old woman woke up and saw the bear stuck fast to the ox. So she ran home and shouted to her husband: \"Come along quick, a bear has stuck fast to our ox, hurry up and catch him!\" And he came along, took the bear, led him home, and shut him up in the lumber room.  [Illustration]  [Illustration]  The next day, as soon as the sun rose, the old woman again drove the ox to pasture, and she herself sat down under a tree, and began spinning flax and saying to herself: \"Feed, feed, ox, on the fresh green grass of the field! Feed, feed, ox, on the fresh green grass of the field!\" And she went on spinning and spinning, and fell asleep. Suddenly from out of the thick wood, from out of the dark forest, a wolf came running, and ran right up against the ox. \"Who in the world are you?\" he asked. And the ox answered: \"I'm the three-year-old ox, all made of straw and smeared over with pitch.\" Then the wolf said: \"Well, if that's so, give me some pitch to put on my poor torn side.\" And the ox answered: \"By all means!\" So the wolf tried to take some pitch, when lo and behold! his paw stuck in it. And when he tried to free it, it stuck all the faster. And the old woman woke up and saw the wolf sticking to the ox. So she ran to fetch her husband and said: \"Come as quick as you can, there's a wolf stuck to the ox!\" And he came and caught the wolf and put him in the cellar.  [Illustration]  The next day, before even the sun had risen, the old woman again drove the ox to pasture, and she herself sat down under a tree, and began spinning flax and saying to herself: \"Feed, feed, ox, on the fresh green grass! Feed, feed, ox, on the fresh green grass!\" And she went on spinning and spinning, and fell asleep.

She came very near to the gratification of her wish.  She died in June, 1714, being then in her eighty-fourth year--only a very few days before {5} Queen Anne received her first warning of the near approach of death. Her son George succeeded to her claim upon the crown of England.  [Sidenote: 1714--The House of Brunswick]  The reigning house of Hanover was one of those lucky families which appear to have what may be called a gift of inheritance.  There are some such houses among European sovereignties; whenever there is a breach in the continuity of succession anywhere, one or other of them is sure to come in for the inheritance.  George the Elector, who was now waiting to become King of England as soon as the breath should be out of Anne's body, belonged to the House of Guelf, or Welf, said to have been founded by Guelf, the son of Isembert, a count of Altdorf, and Irmintrude, sister of Charlemagne, early in the ninth century.  It had two branches, which were united in the eleventh century by the marriage of one of the Guelf ladies to Albert Azzo the Second, Lord of Este and Marquis of Italy.  His son Guelf obtained the Bavarian possessions of his wife's step-father, a Guelf of Bavaria.  One of his descendants, called Henry the Lion, married Maud, daughter of Henry the Second of England, and became the founder of the family of Brunswick. War and imperial favor and imperial displeasure interfered during many generations with the integrity of the Duchy of Brunswick, and the Electorate of Hanover was made up for the most part out of territories which Brunswick had once owned.  The Emperor Leopold constructed it formally into an Electorate in 1692, with Ernest Augustus of Brunswick-Lüneberg as its first Elector.  The George Louis who now, in 1714, is waiting to become King of England, was the son of Ernest Augustus and of Sophia, youngest daughter of Elizabeth Stuart, Queen of Bohemia, sister to Charles First of England.  Elizabeth had married Frederick, the Elector-Palatine of the Rhine, and her life was crossed and thwarted by the opening of the Thirty Years' War, and then by the misfortunes of her brother Charles and his dynasty.  Elizabeth survived the English troubles and saw the Restoration, and came to live in {6} England, and to see her nephew, Charles the Second, reign as king.  She barely saw this.  Two years after the Restoration she died in London. Sophia was her twelfth child: she had thirteen in all.  One of Sophia's elder brothers was Prince Rupert--that \"Rupert of the Rhine\" of whom Macaulay's ballad says that \"Rupert never comes but to conquer or to die\"--the Rupert whose daring and irresistible charges generally won his half of the battle, only that the other half might be lost, and that his success might be swallowed up in the ruin of his companions. His headlong bravery was a misfortune rather than an advantage to his cause, and there seems to have been one instance--that of the surrender of Bristol--in which that bravery deserted him for the moment.  We see him afterwards in the pages of Pepys, an uninteresting, prosaic, pedantic figure, usefully employed in scientific experiments, and with all the gilt washed off him by time and years and the commonplace wear and tear of routine life.  [Sidenote: 1714--The \"Princess of Ahlden\"]  George inherited none of the accomplishments of his mother.  His father was a man of some talent and force of character, but he cared nothing for books or education of any kind, and George was allowed to revel in ignorance.  He had no particular merit except a certain easy good-nature, which rendered him unwilling to do harm or to give pain to any one, unless some interest of his own should make it convenient. His neglected and unrestrained youth was abandoned to license and to profligacy.  He was married in the twenty-second year of his age, against his own inclination, to the Princess Sophia Dorothea of Zeil, who was some six years younger.  The marriage was merely a political one, formed with the object of uniting the whole of the Duchy of Lüneberg.  George was attached to another girl; the princess is supposed to have fixed her affections upon another man.  They were married, however, on November 21, 1682, and during all her life Sophia Dorothea had to put up with the neglect, the contempt, and afterwards the cruelty of {7} her husband.  George's strongest taste was for ugly women.  One of his favorites, Mademoiselle Schulemberg, maid of honor to his mother, and who was afterwards made Duchess of Kendal, was conspicuous, even in the unlovely Hanoverian court, for the awkwardness of her long, gaunt, fleshless figure.  Another favorite of George's, Madame Kilmansegge, afterwards made Countess of Darlington, represented a different style of beauty.  She is described by Horace Walpole as having \"large, fierce, black eyes, rolling beneath lofty-arched eyebrows, two acres of cheeks spread with crimson, an ocean of neck that overflowed and was not distinguishable from the lower part of her body, and no portion of which was restrained by stays.\"  It would not be surprising if the neglected Sophia Dorothea should have looked for love elsewhere, or at least should not have been strict enough in repelling it when it offered itself.  Philip Christof Königsmark, a Swedish soldier of fortune, was supposed to be her favored lover.  He suffered for his amour, and it was said that his death came by the special order--one version has it by the very hand--of George the Elector, the owner of the ladies Schulemberg and Kilmansegge.  Sophia Dorothea was banished for the rest of her life to the Castle of Ahlden, on the river Aller.  In the old schloss of Hanover the spot is still shown, outside the door of the Hall of Knights, which tradition has fixed upon as the spot where the assassination of Königsmark took place.  The Königsmarks were in their way a famous family.  The elder brother was the Charles John Königsmark celebrated in an English State trial as the man who planned and helped to carry out the murder of Thomas Thynne.  Thomas Thynne, of Longleat, the accused of Titus Oates, the \"Wise Issachar,\" the \"wealthy Western friend\" of Dryden, the comrade of Monmouth, the \"Tom of Ten Thousand,\" of every one, was betrothed to Elizabeth, the child widow--she was only fifteen years old--of Lord Ogle.  Königsmark, fresh from love-making in {8} all the courts of Europe, and from fighting anything and everything from the Turk at Tangiers to the wild bulls of Madrid, seems to have fallen in love with Thynne's betrothed wife, and to have thought that the best way of obtaining her was to murder his rival.  The murder was done, and its story is recorded in clumsy bas-relief over Thynne's tomb in Westminster Abbey.  Königsmark's accomplices were executed, but Königsmark got off, and died years later fighting for the Venetians at the siege of classic Argos.  The soldier in Virgil falls on a foreign field, and, dying, remembers sweet Argos.  The elder Königsmark, dying before sweet Argos, ought of right to remember that spot where St. Albans Street joins Pall Mall, and where Thynne was done to death.  The Königsmarks had a sister, the beautiful Aurora, who was mistress of Frederick Augustus, Elector of Saxony, and so mother of the famous Maurice de Saxe, and ancestress of George Sand.  Later, like the fair sinner of some tale of chivalry, she ended her days in pious retirement, as prioress of the Protestant Abbey at Quedlinburg.  [Sidenote: 1714--Wooden shoes and warming-pans]  George was born in Osnabrück, in May, 1660, and was therefore now in his fifty-fifth year.  As his first qualification for the government of England, it may be mentioned that he did not understand one sentence of the English language, was ignorant of English ways, history, and traditions, and had as little sympathy with the growing sentiments of the majority of educated English people as if he had been an Amurath succeeding an Amurath.  When George became Elector, on the death of his father in 1698, he showed, however, some capacity for improvement, under the influence of the new responsibility imposed upon him by his station.  His private life did not amend, but his public conduct acquired a certain solidity and consistency which was not to have been expected from his previous mode of living.  One of his merits was not likely to be by any means a merit in the eyes of the English people.  He was, to do him justice, deeply attached to his native country.  He had all the {9} love for Hanover that the cat has for the hearth to which it is accustomed.  The ways of the place suited him; the climate, the soil, the whole conditions of life were exactly what he would have them to be.  He lived up to the age of fifty-four a contented, stolid, happy, dissolute Elector of Hanover; and it was a complete disturbance to all his habits and his predilections when the expected death of Anne compelled him to turn his thoughts to England.  The other claimant of the English crown was James Frederick Edward Stuart, the Old Pretender, as he came to be afterwards called by his enemies, the Chevalier de Saint George, as his friends called him when they did not think it prudent to give him the title of king.  James was the step-brother of Queen Anne.  He was the son of James the Second, by James's second wife, Maria D'Este, sister to Francis, Duke of Modena. Maria was only the age of Juliet when she married: she had just passed her fourteenth year.  Unlike Juliet she was not beautiful; unlike Juliet she was poor.  She was, however, a devout Roman Catholic, and therefore was especially acceptable to her husband.  She had four children in quick succession, all of whom died in infancy; "]]]
