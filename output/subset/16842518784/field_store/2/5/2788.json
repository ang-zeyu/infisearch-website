All four reclined under the willow for some minutes without speaking, till at length the bride of the Colonel poutingly observed, \"It's of no use pretending any more, and we had better give it up.\"  \"Hah!\" exclaimed the Pirate. \"Pretending?\"  \"Don't go on like that; you worry me,\" returned his Bride.  The lovely Bride of Tinkling echoed the incredible declaration. The two warriors exchanged stoney glances.  \"If,\" said the Bride of the Pirate-Colonel, \"grown-up people WON'T do what they ought to do, and WILL put us out, what comes of our pretending?\"  \"We only get into scrapes,\" said the Bride of Tinkling.  \"You know very well,\" pursued the Colonel's Bride, \"that Miss Drowvey wouldn't fall. You complained of it yourself. And you know how disgracefully the court-martial ended. As to our marriage; would my people acknowledge it at home?\"  \"Or would my people acknowledge ours?\" said the Bride of Tinkling.  Again the two warriors exchanged stoney glances.  \"If you knocked at the door and claimed me, after you were told to go away,\" said the Colonel's Bride, \"you would only have your hair pulled, or your ears, or your nose.\"  \"If you persisted in ringing at the bell and claiming Me,\" said the Bride of Tinkling to that gentleman, \"you would have things dropped on your head from the window over the handle, or you would be played upon by the garden-engine.\"  \"And at your own homes,\" resumed the Bride of the Colonel, \"it would be just as bad. You would be sent to bed, or something equally undignified. Again: how would you support us?\"  The Pirate-Colonel replied, in a courageous voice, \"By rapine!\" But his Bride retorted, suppose the grown-up people wouldn't be rapined? Then, said the Colonel, they should pay the penalty in Blood. But suppose they should object, retorted his bride, and wouldn't pay the penalty in Blood or anything else?  A mournful silence ensued.  \"Then do you no longer love me, Alice?\" asked the Colonel.  \"Redforth! I am ever thine,\" returned his Bride.  \"Then do you no longer love me, Nettie?\" asked the present writer.  \"Tinkling! I am ever thine,\" returned my Bride.  We all four embraced. Let me not be misunderstood by the giddy. The Colonel embraced his own Bride, and I embraced mine. But two times two make four.  \"Nettie and I,\" said Alice, mournfully, \"have been considering our position. The grown-up people are too strong for us. They make us ridiculous. Besides, they have changed the times. William Tinkling's baby-brother was christened yesterday. What took place? Was any king present? Answer, William.\"  I said No, unless disguised as great-uncle Chopper.  \"Any queen?\"  There had been no queen that I knew of at our house. There might have been one in the kitchen; but I didn't think so, or the servants would have mentioned it.  \"Any fairies?\"  None that were visible.  \"We had an idea among us, I think,\" said Alice, with a melancholy smile, \"we four, that Miss Grimmer would prove to be the wicked fairy, and would come in at the christening with her crutch-stick, and give the child a bad gift? Was there anything of that sort? Answer, William.\"  [Illustration: We had an idea among us ... that Miss Grimmer would prove to be the wicked fairy.]  I said that Ma had said afterwards (and so she had), that great-uncle Chopper's gift was a shabby one; but she hadn't said a bad one. She had called it shabby, electrotyped, second-hand, and below his income.  \"It must be the grown-up people who have changed all this,\" said Alice. \"_We_ couldn't have changed it, if we had been so inclined, and we never should have been. Or perhaps Miss Grimmer _is_ a wicked fairy, after all, and won't act up to it, because the grown-up people have persuaded her not to. Either way, they would make us ridiculous if we told them what we expected.\"  \"Tyrants!\" muttered the Pirate-Colonel.  \"Nay, my Redforth,\" said Alice, \"say not so. Call not names, my Redforth, or they will apply to Pa.\"  \"Let 'em,\" said the Colonel. \"I don't care. Who's he?\"  Tinkling here undertook the perilous task of remonstrating with his lawless friend, who consented to withdraw the moody expressions above quoted.  \"What remains for us to do?\" Alice went on in her mild wise way. \"We must educate, we must pretend in a new manner, we must wait.\"  The Colonel clenched his teeth--four out in front, and a piece off another, and he had been twice dragged to the door of a dentist-despot, but had escaped from his guards. \"How educate? How pretend in a new manner? How wait?\"  \"Educate the grown-up people,\" replied Alice. \"We part to-night. Yes, Redforth,\"--for the Colonel tucked up his cuffs,--\"part to-night! Let us in these next Holidays, now going to begin, throw our thoughts into something educational for the grown-up people, hinting to them how things ought to be. Let us veil our meaning under a mask of romance;[A] you, I, and Nettie. William Tinkling being the plainest and quickest writer, shall copy out. Is it agreed?\"  The Colonel answered, sulkily, \"I don't mind.\" He then asked, \"How about pretending?\"  \"We will pretend,\" said Alice, \"that we are children; not that we are those grown-up people who won't help us out as they ought, and who understand us so badly.\"  The Colonel, still much dissatisfied, growled, \"How about waiting?\"  \"We will wait,\" answered little Alice, taking Nettie's hand in hers, and looking up to the sky, \"we will wait--ever constant and true--till the times have got so changed as that everything helps us out, and nothing makes us ridiculous, and the fairies have come back. We will wait--ever constant and true--till we are eighty, ninety, or one hundred. And then the fairies will send _us_ children, and we will help them out, poor pretty little creatures, if they pretend ever so much.\"  [Illustration]  \"So we will, dear,\" said Nettie Ashford, taking her round the waist with both arms and kissing her. \"And now if my Husband will go and buy some cherries for us, I have got some money.\"  In the friendliest manner I invited the Colonel to go with me; but he so far forgot himself as to acknowledge the invitation by kicking out behind, and then lying down on his stomach on the grass, pulling it up and chewing it. When I came back, however, Alice had nearly brought him out of his vexation, and was soothing him by telling him how soon we should all be ninety.  As we sat under the willow-tree and ate the cherries (fair, for Alice shared them out), we played at being ninety. Nettie complained that she had a bone in her old back and it made her hobble, and Alice sang a song in an old woman's way, but it was very pretty, and we were all merry. At least I don't know about merry exactly, but all comfortable.  There was a most tremendous lot of cherries and Alice always had with her some neat little bag or box or case, to hold things. In it, that night, was a tiny wine-glass. So Alice and Nettie said they would make some cherry-wine to drink our love at parting.  [Illustration: There was a most tremendous lot of cherries.]  Each of us had a glassful, and it was delicious, and each of us drank the toast, \"Our love at parting.\" The Colonel drank his wine last, and it got into my head directly that it got into his directly. Anyhow his eyes rolled immediately after he had turned the glass upside down, and he took me on one side and proposed in a hoarse whisper that we should \"Cut 'em out still.\"  \"How did he mean?\" I asked my lawless friend.  \"Cut our Brides out,\" said the Colonel, \"and then cut our way, without going down a single turning, Bang to the Spanish Main!\"  We might have tried it, though I didn't think it would answer; only we looked round and saw that there was nothing but moonlight under the willow-tree, and that our pretty, pretty wives were gone. We burst out crying. The Colonel gave in second, and came to first; but he gave in strong.  We were ashamed of our red eyes, and hung about for half an hour to whiten them. Likewise a piece of chalk round the rims, I doing the Colonel's, and he mine, but afterwards found in the bedroom looking-glass not natural, besides inflammation. Our conversation turned on being ninety. The Colonel told me he had a pair of boots that wanted soleing and heeling but he thought it hardly worth while to mention it to his father, as he himself should so soon be ninety, when he thought shoes would be more convenient. The Colonel also told me with his hand upon his hip that he felt himself already getting on in life, and turning rheumatic. And I told him the same. And when they said at our house at supper (they are always bothering about something) that I stooped, I felt so glad!  This is the end of the beginning-part that you were to believe most.

In the present state of Siam it is most awkward that I should be away from the office.  But it is a real crisis.  I have never seen the Prime Minister so upset.  As to the Admiralty--it is buzzing like an overturned bee-hive.  Have you read up the case?\"  \"We have just done so.  What were the technical papers?\"  \"Ah, there's the point!  Fortunately, it has not come out.  The press would be furious if it did.  The papers which this wretched youth had in his pocket were the plans of the Bruce-Partington submarine.\"  Mycroft Holmes spoke with a solemnity which showed his sense of the importance of the subject.  His brother and I sat expectant.  \"Surely you have heard of it?  I thought everyone had heard of it.\"  \"Only as a name.\"  \"Its importance can hardly be exaggerated.  It has been the most jealously guarded of all government secrets.  You may take it from me that naval warfare becomes impossible within the radius of a Bruce-Partington's operation.  Two years ago a very large sum was smuggled through the Estimates and was expended in acquiring a monopoly of the invention.  Every effort has been made to keep the secret.  The plans, which are exceedingly intricate, comprising some thirty separate patents, each essential to the working of the whole, are kept in an elaborate safe in a confidential office adjoining the arsenal, with burglar-proof doors and windows.  Under no conceivable circumstances were the plans to be taken from the office.  If the chief constructor of the Navy desired to consult them, even he was forced to go to the Woolwich office for the purpose.  And yet here we find them in the pocket of a dead junior clerk in the heart of London.  From an official point of view it's simply awful.\"  \"But you have recovered them?\"  \"No, Sherlock, no!  That's the pinch.  We have not.  Ten papers were taken from Woolwich.  There were seven in the pocket of Cadogan West. The three most essential are gone--stolen, vanished.  You must drop everything, Sherlock.  Never mind your usual petty puzzles of the police-court.  It's a vital international problem that you have to solve.  Why did Cadogan West take the papers, where are the missing ones, how did he die, how came his body where it was found, how can the evil be set right?  Find an answer to all these questions, and you will have done good service for your country.\"  \"Why do you not solve it yourself, Mycroft?  You can see as far as I.\"  \"Possibly, Sherlock.  But it is a question of getting details. Give me your details, and from an armchair I will return you an excellent expert opinion.  But to run here and run there, to cross-question railway guards, and lie on my face with a lens to my eye--it is not my metier.  No, you are the one man who can clear the matter up.  If you have a fancy to see your name in the next honours list--\"  My friend smiled and shook his head.  \"I play the game for the game's own sake,\" said he.  \"But the problem certainly presents some points of interest, and I shall be very pleased to look into it.  Some more facts, please.\"  \"I have jotted down the more essential ones upon this sheet of paper, together with a few addresses which you will find of service.  The actual official guardian of the papers is the famous government expert, Sir James Walter, whose decorations and sub-titles fill two lines of a book of reference.  He has grown gray in the service, is a gentleman, a favoured guest in the most exalted houses, and, above all, a man whose patriotism is beyond suspicion.  He is one of two who have a key of the safe.  I may add that the papers were undoubtedly in the office during working hours on Monday, and that Sir James left for London about three o'clock taking his key with him.  He was at the house of Admiral Sinclair at Barclay Square during the whole of the evening when this incident occurred.\"  \"Has the fact been verified?\"  \"Yes; his brother, Colonel Valentine Walter, has testified to his departure from Woolwich, and Admiral Sinclair to his arrival in London; so Sir James is no longer a direct factor in the problem.\"  \"Who was the other man with a key?\"  \"The senior clerk and draughtsman, Mr. Sidney Johnson.  He is a man of forty, married, with five children.  He is a silent, morose man, but he has, on the whole, an excellent record in the public service.  He is unpopular with his colleagues, but a hard worker.  According to his own account, corroborated only by the word of his wife, he was at home the whole of Monday evening after office hours, and his key has never left the watch-chain upon which it hangs.\"  \"Tell us about Cadogan West.\"  \"He has been ten years in the service and has done good work.  He has the reputation of being hot-headed and imperious, but a straight, honest man.  We have nothing against him.  He was next Sidney Johnson in the office.  His duties brought him into daily, personal contact with the plans.  No one else had the handling of them.\"  \"Who locked up the plans that night?\"  \"Mr. Sidney Johnson, the senior clerk.\"  \"Well, it is surely perfectly clear who took them away.  They are actually found upon the person of this junior clerk, Cadogan West. That seems final, does it not?\"  \"It does, Sherlock, and yet it leaves so much unexplained.  In the first place, why did he take them?\"  \"I presume they were of value?\"  \"He could have got several thousands for them very easily.\"  \"Can you suggest any possible motive for taking the papers to London except to sell them?\"  \"No, I cannot.\"  \"Then we must take that as our working hypothesis.  Young West took the papers.  Now this could only be done by having a false key--\"  \"Several false keys.  He had to open the building and the room.\"  \"He had, then, several false keys.  He took the papers to London to sell the secret, intending, no doubt, to have the plans themselves back in the safe next morning before they were missed. While in London on this treasonable mission he met his end.\"  \"How?\"  \"We will suppose that he was travelling back to Woolwich when he was killed and thrown out of the compartment.\"  \"Aldgate, where the body was found, is considerably past the station London Bridge, which would be his route to Woolwich.\"  \"Many circumstances could be imagined under which he would pass London Bridge.  There was someone in the carriage, for example, with whom he was having an absorbing interview.  This interview led to a violent scene in which he lost his life.  Possibly he tried to leave the carriage, fell out on the line, and so met his end.  The other closed the door.  There was a thick fog, and nothing could be seen.\"  \"No better explanation can be given with our present knowledge; and yet consider, Sherlock, how much you leave untouched.  We will suppose, for argument's sake, that young Cadogan West HAD determined to convey these papers to London.  He would naturally have made an appointment with the foreign agent and kept his evening clear.  Instead of that he took two tickets for the theatre, escorted his fiancee halfway there, and then suddenly disappeared.\"  \"A blind,\" said Lestrade, who had sat listening with some impatience to the conversation.  \"A very singular one.  That is objection No. 1.  Objection No. 2: We will suppose that he reaches London and sees the foreign agent.  He must bring back the papers before morning or the loss will be discovered.  He took away ten.  Only seven were in his pocket.  What had become of the other three?  He certainly would not leave them of his own free will.  Then, again, where is the price of his treason? Once would have expected to find a large sum of money in his pocket.\"  \"It seems to me perfectly clear,\" said Lestrade.  \"I have no doubt at all as to what occurred.  He took the papers to sell them.  He saw the agent. They could not agree as to price.  He started home again, but the agent went with him.  In the train the agent murdered him, took the more essential papers, and threw his body from the carriage.  That would account for everything, would it not?\"  \"Why had he no ticket?\"  \"The ticket would have shown which station was nearest the agent's house.  Therefore he took it from the murdered man's pocket.\"  \"Good, Lestrade, very good,\" said Holmes.  \"Your theory holds together. But if this is true, then the case is at an end.  On the one hand, the traitor is dead.  On the other, the plans of the Bruce-Partington submarine are presumably already on the Continent.  What is there for us to do?\"  \"To act, Sherlock--to act!\" cried Mycroft, springing to his feet. \"All my instincts are against this explanation.  Use your powers! Go to the scene of the crime!  See the people concerned!  Leave no stone unturned!  In all your career you have never had so great a chance of serving your country.\"  \"Well, well!\" said Holmes, shrugging his shoulders.  \"Come, Watson! And you, Lestrade, could you favour us with your company for an hour or two?  We will begin our investigation by a visit to Aldgate Station. Good-bye, Mycroft.  I shall let you have a report before evening, but I warn you in advance that you have little to expect.\"  An hour later Holmes, Lestrade and I stood upon the Underground railroad at the point where it emerges from the tunnel immediately before Aldgate Station.  A courteous red-faced old gentleman represented the railway company.  \"This is where the young man's body lay,\" said he, indicating a spot about three feet from the metals.  \"It could not have fallen from above, for these, as you see, are all blank walls. Therefore, it could only have come from a train, and that train, so far as we can trace it, must have passed about midnight on Monday.\"  \"Have the carriages been examined for any sign of violence?\"  \"There are no such signs, and no ticket has been found.\"  \"No record of a door being found open?\"  \"None.\"  \"We have had some fresh evidence this morning,\" said Lestrade. \"A passenger who passed Aldgate in an ordinary Metropolitan train about 11:40 on Monday"]]]
