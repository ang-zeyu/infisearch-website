The North Lancashires were marching in, and an old man in the crowd was on the look-out for his son. He explained to everybody near him what a fine boy his son was, and how keen a soldier; how it had nearly broken the old man's heart that his boy should leave him and go to the war, but how it would \"do un good and make a mon of un.\" Presently two soldiers appeared, half-carrying and half-dragging between them a young man who was so drunk that he could neither stand nor walk. His helmet was jammed over his eyes, but as he was dragged past us it fell off and rolled to the old man's feet. I heard him draw in his breath sharply and murmur something as his face flushed; and then all the people round began to point and say, \"That's his son there, him that's being carried\"; and some--God forgive them!--laughed and joked at the old man. And he who had a moment ago filled our ears with the praises of his boy gazed after him with a look of bitter amazement and then went silently away. Another man who had missed seeing his wife before he had embarked caught sight of her from the ship's deck as she stood upon the quay with tears in her eyes. There was no chance of his being allowed to pass down the gangway. But the husband in him knew no obedience to the stern order, and he dived clean off the stern of the steamer into the filthy water and swam, khaki and all, to the steps at the side of the dock. And you may be sure his wife was there to help him out, and she forgot her grief in her pride at his daring. So he held her in his arm for a moment (and had three ringing cheers from his mates into the bargain) before he was collared and marched back to restraint, dirty but glorious.  Here and there one saw men much the worse for liquor; and I have no words to describe the folly of those friends who thrust bottles of spirits into the soldiers' hands as they passed through the streets. They did them a double cruelty, for the poor fellows, all unstrung by their partings, gulped the raw spirit thinking they drank courage; and so once or twice I saw poor women saying good-bye to staggering maniacs--grim mockeries of the husbands they might never see again, the poor fools themselves at present oblivious indeed, but doomed to I know not what horrors of remorse on awaking. Happily, however, there were not many in this sad condition. Most of the men behaved with a fortitude and gentleness that was most touching. Indeed I find it hard to express my admiration of their bearing. There was none of the bluster of the armchair Jingo, none of the loud hectoring and swaggering and bravado that distinguish the carpet warrior. On the contrary, when they were talking of the war amongst themselves they had an air of quiet determination, of good-humoured banter, and of easy, serious confidence far more ominous for an enemy than any amount of fluent rant. After the world of politics, with its hair-splitting and word-mincing, it was good to be with soldiers--the men who do the work. They knew no fine political shades, they bandied no epithets; England was at war and they were going to fight--that was enough. And the spirit in which they fought all the world knows: every day during the war one read tales of devotion and heroism that became almost commonplace; it is even a commonplace to praise them. Yet one could not see the soldiers in this most trying duty of all, the laying down of home ties and interests (for I think the heroism of mere fighting is nothing to it), without feeling a pride in the moral discipline that makes it all possible, and under the authority of which Tommy is content to be as a child. And this childlike submission to discipline has its pathetic side, as when one saw the little family of mother and children grouped to see the last of its head. The children stood in wide-eyed amazement to see daddy the Reservist, who in the little household had been the emblem of all authority, now in the place of obedience, and taking directions from another man (not so big and strong as he) as to how he should stand and into what hole he should put the buckle of his strap. Thus even the father and the husband are absorbed in the soldier. It is a great price; and the way in which it was paid by so many was perhaps our firmest assurance of the stuff that is in our soldiers.  Early on the morning of departure a few hundred people--mostly women--stood on the pierhead of Canada Dock, watching the transport as she lay a short distance off in the stream with the Blue Peter at her fore and the St. George's ensign hanging astern. The rain beat steadily down, loading the raw wind that blew out of the morning twilight, and the brown water broke sullenly to the send of a setting flood tide. The faces of nearly all the women were worn with weeping; now they wept no longer, but looked dully out to sea, while the rain ran down their soaking garments and splashed on the ground. A drunken soldier who had somehow got ashore the night before reeled helplessly on his wife's arm, his head bruised and cut and his new uniform torn and filthy. But in the woman's face there was a kind of fearful joy; she had rescued him from his pot-house satellites, and she thought she could keep him. Presently a tug came off from the transport with a picket to collect deserters--he had to go. She sobbed and wailed, imploring the sergeant in vain; and she clung to her poor senseless husband as though she would never leave him. He hardly knew her; he laughed vacantly in her face when with streaming eyes she begged him to speak her name; then they took him away from her. As the tug steamed out I heard him singing.  A little while afterwards the _Canada's_ siren began to wail and squeal with a horrible mockery of painful cries. The tugs backed clear of her, and lent their shrill voices to the discordant concert. Presently the water astern of the transport turned from brown to foaming white, and her masts began to move past the farther shore. There was a faint sound of cheering from her, but she was soon out of sound and sight, and still the women stared into the mist that had enfolded her, as though their wishes might draw her back again. But in a little while they turned towards home and a world that had changed its face.         *       *       *       *       *  On another day I went down to Liverpool to see the _Majestic_ depart with troops for the front. The weather was consistently unkind. The _Canada_ had sailed in a whirl of rainy fog, and the departing passengers of the _Majestic_ looked across a little inky strip of water to a land that was cloaked with snow. It was bitterly cold on the landing-stage, and all the interest of the scene could not keep the bitter wind from whipping one's face and numbing the feet. The wooden planks resounded not more with the tramp of marching feet than with the hard stampings of people who were trying to restore circulation. There were no very poor people on the stage. The space opposite to the ship was occupied chiefly by the friends of officers and by the troops themselves, and certainly it seemed kinder to the men to prevent the dreadful scrambling for farewells that took place when the _Canada_ sailed. But a sea of anxious faces pressed against the barriers at either end of the reserved space, and no doubt there was much bitter envy of us in the enclosure, who had so much better an opportunity, and perhaps so much less reasonable a claim to the front places.  Outwardly this departure seemed very different from that of the _Canada_. It was not so sordid, if one may use the term; the vessel did not slip away furtively from a dock in the small hours of the morning, but departed in open day from the more accessible landing-stage; and although the weather was chill and bitter, it had not that infinitely dreary effect upon the spirits that one associates with a soaking downpour. Here were all the pomps and circumstances of farewell--the blowing of bands and wavings of caps and great shouts of a multitude that must give vent to acute emotions. Yet, different though the outward circumstances were, they only accentuated the likeness that lay beneath. Good-bye is good-bye, whether we say it at a carriage window or shout it across a strip of harbour water; whether a crowd sings \"Auld Lang Syne\" or a mother whispers \"Don't forget me.\" And at the sailing of the _Majestic_, with all its dignity, one saw the same tragedies repeated over and over again, until one's heart sickened of it all, and one would gladly have come away. Of course it was not among the officers and their wives that one saw these things; people used to self-control keep their griefs to themselves, and perhaps a very inexperienced person would have been deceived by the smiles on women's faces and the cheery chaff of men. Even here there were things to be seen at the last moment, but I confess that I turned my back when the saloon gangway was about to be removed; some things are sacred even from the man whose business it is to describe what he sees.  It was after the two thousand troops had all been embarked that the friends of the men were admitted to the stage, and the dismal, though enthusiastic, part of the affair began. Before that everything was business and order. As the men arrived they were provided with hot coffee and meat pies, which they drank and ate with every sign of pleasure. Some of us who were very cold envied them for that moment. The forward gangway was for about an hour occupied by men who did nothing but pass rifles from the quay to the ship; it was a formidable sight, this stream of deadly weapons that flowed on board. Up another gangway enough cordite to blow up the whole of Liverpool was being gingerly carried in small cases. But this hour or two of embarkation, in which so much really happened, left little impression on my mind. It simply was one more illustration of the admirable efficiency of discipline for which our army is famous.

The Sloppy Joe was on the valley floor now, and ahead the bubble covering the city was drawing closer. The sun was almost gone; lights were appearing inside the plastic shielding. Born and raised on Mars, Tom had seen the teeming cities of Earth only once in his life ... but to him none of the splendors of the Earth cities could match the simple, quiet beauty of this Martian outpost settlement. There had been a time when people had said that Sun Lake City could never be built, that it could never survive if it were, but with each successive year it grew larger and stronger, the headquarters city for the planet that had become the new frontier of Earth.  The radiophone buzzed, and the airlock guard hailed him when he returned the signal. Tom gave his routine ID. He guided the tractor into the lock, waited until pressure and atmosphere rose to normal, and then leaped out of the cab.  Five minutes later he was walking across the lobby of the Interplanetary Council building, stepping into the down elevator. Three flights below he stepped out into the office corridor of the U.N. Interplanetary Council on Mars.  If there was trouble, this was where he would find it.  He paused for a minute before the gray plastic door marked MAJOR FRANK BRIARTON in raised stainless steel letters. Then he pushed open the door and walked into the ante-room.  It was empty. Suddenly he felt a touch on his shoulder. Behind him, a familiar voice said, \"Hello, Twin.\"         *       *       *       *       *  At first glance they looked like carbon copies of each other, although they were no more identical than identical twins ever are. Greg stood a good two inches taller than Tom. His shoulders were broad, and there was a small gray scar over one eye that stood out in contrast to the healthy tanned color of his face. Tom was of slighter build, and wirier, his skin much more pale.  But they had the same dark hair, the same gray eyes, the same square, stubborn line to the jaw. They looked at each other for a moment without speaking. Then Greg grinned and clapped his brother on the shoulder.  \"So you got here, finally,\" he said. \"I was beginning to think I'd have to go out on the desert and find you.\"  \"Oh, I got here, all right,\" Tom said. \"I see you did too.\"  \"Yes,\" Greg said heavily. \"Can't argue with the major, you know.\"  \"But what does he want?\"  \"How should I know? All he said was to get down here fast. And now he isn't even here himself.\"  \"Is Dad on Mars?\" Tom asked.  Greg looked at him. \"I don't know.\"  \"We could check the register.\"  \"I already checked it. He has not logged in, but that doesn't mean anything.\"  \"I suppose not,\" Tom said glumly.  They were silent for a moment. Then Greg said, \"Look, what are you worried about? Nothing could have happened to Dad. He's been mining the Belt for years.\"  \"I know. I just wish he were here, that's all. If he's in some kind of trouble....\"  \"What kind of trouble? You're looking for spooks.\"  \"Spooks like Jupiter Equilateral, maybe,\" Tom said. \"They could make plenty of trouble for Dad.\"  \"With the U.N. in the driver's seat here? They wouldn't dare. Why do you think the major rides them so hard with all the claim-filing regulations? He'd give his right arm for a chance to break that outfit into pieces.\"  \"I still wish somebody had gone out to the Belt with Dad,\" Tom said.  Just then the door opened. The newcomer was a tall, gray-haired man with U.N. Council stripes on his lapel, and major's rockets on his shoulders. \"Sorry I'm late, boys,\" Major Briarton said. \"I'd hoped to be here when you arrived. I'm sorry to pull you in here like this, but I'm afraid I had no choice. When did you boys hear from your father last?\"  They looked at each other. \"I saw him six weeks ago,\" Tom said. \"Just before he left to go out to the Belt again.\"  \"Nothing since then?\"  \"Not a word.\"  The major chewed his lip. \"Greg?\"  \"I had a note at Christmas, I think. But what....\"  \"What did he say in the note?\"  \"He said Merry Christmas and Happy New Year. Dad isn't much of a letter writer.\"  \"Nothing at all about what he was doing?\"  Greg shook his head. \"Look, Major, if there's some sort of trouble....\"  \"Yes, I'm afraid there's trouble,\" the major said. He looked up at them, and spread his hands helplessly. \"There isn't any easy way to tell you, but you've got to know. There's been an accident, out in the Belt.\"  \"Accident?\" Greg said.  \"A very serious accident. A fuel tank exploded in the scooter your father was riding back to the _Scavenger_. It must have been very sudden, and by the time help arrived....\" The major broke off, unable to find words.  For a long moment there was utter silence in the room. Outside, an elevator was buzzing, and a typewriter clicked monotonously somewhere in the building.  Then Tom Hunter broke the silence. \"Who was it, Major?\" he said. \"Who killed Dad? Tell us, or we'll find out!\"     2. Jupiter Equilateral   For a moment, Major Briarton just stared at him. Then he was on his feet, shaking his head as he came around the desk. \"Tom, use your head,\" he said. \"It's as much of a shock to me as it is to you, but you can't afford to jump to false conclusions....\"  Tom Hunter looked up bitterly. \"He's dead, isn't he?\"  \"Yes, he's dead. He must have died the instant of the explosion....\"  \"You mean you don't know?\"  \"I wasn't there at the time it happened, no.\"  \"Then who was?\"         *       *       *       *       *  Major Briarton spread his hands helplessly. \"Nobody was. Your father was alone. From what we could tell later, he'd left the _Scavenger_ to land on one of his claims, using the ship's scooter for the landing. He was on the way back to the _Scavenger_ when the rear tank exploded. There wasn't enough left of it to tell what went wrong ... but it was an accident, there was no evidence to suggest anything else.\"  Tom looked at him. \"You really believe that?\"  \"I can only tell you what we found.\"  \"Well, I don't believe it for a minute,\" Tom said angrily. \"How long have you and Dad been friends? Twenty years? Twenty-five? Do you really think Dad would have an accident with a mining rig?\"  \"I know he was an expert engineer,\" the major said. \"But things can happen that even an expert can't foresee, mining in the Belt.\"  \"Things like a fuel tank exploding? Not to Dad, they would never happen. I don't care what anybody says....\"  \"Easy, Tom,\" Greg said.  \"Well, I won't take it easy. Dad was too careful for something like that to happen. If he had an accident, somebody _made_ it happen.\"  Greg turned to the major. \"What was Dad doing out there?\"  \"Mining.\"  \"By himself? No crew at all?\"  \"No, he was alone.\"  \"I thought the regulations said there always had to be at least two men working an asteroid claim.\"  \"That's right. Your father had Johnny Coombs with him when he left Sun Lake City. They signed out as a team ... and then Johnny came back to Mars on the first shuttle ship.\"  \"How come?\"  \"Not even Johnny knows. Your father just sent him back, and there was nothing we could do about it then. The U.N. has no jurisdiction in the belt, unless a major crime has been committed.\" Major Briarton shook his head helplessly. \"If a man is determined to mine a claim all by himself out there, he can find a dozen different ways to wiggle out of the regulations.\"  \"But Dad would never be that stupid,\" Greg said. \"If he was alone when it happened, who found him?\"  \"A routine U.N. Patrol ship. When Roger failed to check in at the regular eight-hour signal, they went out to see what was wrong. But by the time they reached him, it was too late to help.\"  \"I just don't get it,\" Greg said. \"Dad had more sense than to try to mine out there all by himself.\"  \"I know,\" the major said. \"I don't know the answer. I had the Patrol ship go over the scene of the accident with a comb after they found what had happened, but there was nothing there to find. It was an accident, and that's that.\"  \"What about Jupiter Equilateral?\" Tom said hotly. \"Everybody knows they were out to get Dad ... why don't you find out what _they_ were doing when it happened, bring them in for questioning....\"  \"I can't do that, I haven't a scrap of evidence,\" the major said wearily.  \"Why can't you? You're the Mars Coordinator, aren't you? You act like you're scared of them.\"  Major Briarton's lips tightened angrily. \"All right, since you put it that way ... I _am_ scared of them. They're big, and they're powerful. If they had their way, there wouldn't be any United Nations control on Mars, there wouldn't be _anybody_ to fight them and keep them in check. There wouldn't be any independent miners out in the Belt, either, because they'd all be bought out or dead, and Earth would pay through the nose for every ounce of metal that they got from the Asteroid Belt. That company has been trying to drive the U.N. off Mars for thirty years, and they've come so close to it that it scares me plenty.\" He pushed his chair back sharply and rose to his feet. \"And that is exactly why I refuse to stir up a mess over this thing, unhappy as it is, without something more than suspicions and rumors to back me up ... because all Jupiter Equilateral needs is one big issue to make us look like fools out here, and we're through.\"  He crossed the room to a wall cabinet, opened it, and pulled out a scarred aluminum box. \"We found this in the cabin of the _Scavenger_. I thought you boys might want it.\"  They both recognized it instantly ... the battered old spacer's pack that Roger Hunter had used for as long as they could remember. It seemed to them, suddenly, as if a part of him had appeared here in the room with them. Greg looked at the box and turned away. \"You open it,\" he said to Tom in a sick voice.  There was nothing much inside ... some clothing, a pipe and tobacco pouch, a jack knife, half a dozen other items so familiar that Tom could hardly bear to touch them. At the bottom of the pack "]]]
