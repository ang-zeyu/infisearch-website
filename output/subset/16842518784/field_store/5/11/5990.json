In his efforts to control it, Speaker Colfax hammered the desk until he nearly broke his mallet.  Finally, by 4 o'clock, P.M., after several minutes of useless effort--during which the pounding of the mallet was utterly lost in the noisy enthusiasm and excitement, in which both the Freedom-loving men and women of the Land, there present, participated --the Speaker at last succeeded in securing a lull.  Advantage was instantly taken of it, by the successor of the dead Owen Lovejoy, Mr. Ingersoll of Illinois, his young face flushing with the glow of patriotism, as he cried: \"Mr. Speaker!  In honor of this Immortal and Sublime Event I move that the House do now adjourn.\"  The Speaker declared the motion carried, amid renewed demonstrations of enthusiasm.  During all these uncontrollable ebullitions of popular feeling in behalf of personal Liberty and National Freedom and strength, the Democratic members of the House had sat, many of them moving uneasily in their seats, with chagrin painted in deep lines upon their faces, while others were bolt upright, as if riveted to their chairs, looking straight before them at the Speaker, in a vain attempt, belied by the pallid anger of their set countenances, to appear unconscious of the storm of popular feeling breaking around them, which they now doggedly perceived might be but a forecast of the joyful enthusiasm which on that day, and on the morrow, would spread from one end of the Land to the other.  Harris, of Maryland, made a sort of \"Last Ditch\" protest against adjournment, by demanding the \"yeas and nays\" on the motion to adjourn. The motion was, however, carried, by 121 yeas to 24 nays; and, as the members left their places in the Hall--many of them to hurry with their hearty congratulations to President Lincoln at the White House--the triumph, in the Halls of our National Congress, of Freedom and Justice and Civilization, over Slavery and Tyranny and Barbarism, was already being saluted by the booming of one hundred guns on Capitol Hill.  How large a share was Mr. Lincoln's, in that triumph, these pages have already sufficiently indicated.  Sweet indeed must have been the joy that thrilled his whole being, when, sitting in the White House, he heard the bellowing artillery attest the success of his labors in behalf of Emancipation.  Proud indeed must he have felt when, the following night, in response to the loud and jubilant cries of \"Lincoln!\" \"Lincoln!\" \"Abe Lincoln!\" \"Uncle Abe!\" and other affectionate calls, from a great concourse of people who, with music, had assembled outside the White House to give him a grand serenade and popular ovation, he appeared at an open window, bowed to the tumult of their acclamations, and declared that \"The great Job is ended!\"--adding, among other things, that the occasion was one fit for congratulation, and, said he, \"I cannot but congratulate all present--myself, the Country, and the whole World--upon this great moral victory. * * * This ends the Job!\"  Substantially the job was ended.  There was little doubt, after such a send off, by the President and by Congress, in view of the character of the State Legislatures, as well as the temper of the People, that the requisite number of States would be secured to ratify the Thirteenth Amendment.  Already, on the 1st of February, that is to say, on the very day of this popular demonstration at the Executive Mansion, the President's own State, Illinois, had ratified it--and this circumstance added to the satisfaction and happiness which beamed from, and almost made beautiful, his homely face.  Other States quickly followed; Maryland, on February 1st and 3rd; Rhode Island and Michigan, on February 2nd; New York, February 2nd and 3rd; West Virginia, February 3rd; Maine and Kansas, February 7th; Massachusetts and Pennsylvania, February 8th; Virginia, February 9th; Ohio and Missouri, February 10th; Nevada and Indiana, February 16th; Louisiana, February 17th; Minnesota, February 8th and 23rd; Wisconsin, March 1st; Vermont, March 9th; Tennessee, April 5th and 7th; Arkansas, April 20th; Connecticut, May 5th; New Hampshire, July 1st; South Carolina, November 13th; Alabama, December 2nd; North Carolina, December 4th; Georgia, December 9th; Oregon, December 11th; California, December 20th; and Florida, December 28th;--all in 1865; with New Jersey, closely following, on January 23rd; and Iowa, January 24th;--in 1866.  Long ere this last date, however, the Secretary of State (Mr. Seward) had been able to, and did, announce (November 18, 1865) the ratification of the Amendment by the requisite number of States, and certified that the same had \"become, to all intents and purposes, valid as a part of the Constitution of the United States.\"  Not until then, was \"the job\" absolutely ended; but, as has been already mentioned, it was, at the time Mr. Lincoln spoke, as good as ended.  It was a foregone conclusion, that the great end for which he, and so many other great and good men of the Republic had for so many years been earnestly striving, would be an accomplished fact.  They had not failed; they had stood firm; the victory which he had predicted six years before had come!       [He had said in his Springfield speech, of 1858: \"We      shall not fail; if we stand firm we shall not fail; wise counsels      may accelerate, or mistakes delay, but sooner or later the Victory      is sure to come.\"]                                  CHAPTER XXIX.                       LINCOLN'S SECOND INAUGURATION.  While the death of Slavery in America was decreed, as we have seen; yet, the sanguine anticipations of Mr. Lincoln, and other friends of Freedom, that such a decree, imperishably grafted into the Constitution, must at once end the Rebellion, and bring Peace with a restored Union, were not realized.  The War went on.  Grant was still holding Lee, at Petersburg, near Richmond, while Sherman's victorious Army was about entering upon a campaign from Savannah, up through the Carolinas.  During the previous Summer, efforts had been made, by Horace Greeley, and certain parties supposed to represent the Rebel authorities, to lay the ground-work for an early Peace and adjustment of the differences between the Government of the United States and the Rebels, but they miscarried.  They led, however, to the publication of the following important conciliatory Presidential announcement:                                \"EXECUTIVE MANSION,                               \"WASHINGTON, July 18, 1864.  \"To whom it may concern:  \"Any proposition which embraces the restoration of Peace, the integrity of the whole Union, and the abandonment of Slavery, and which comes by and with an authority that can control the Armies now at War against the United States, will be received and considered by the Executive Government of the United States, and will be met by liberal terms on substantial and collateral points; and the bearer or bearers thereof shall have safe conduct both ways.  \"(Signed) ABRAHAM LINCOLN.\"   About the same time, other efforts were being made, with a similar object in view, but which came to naught.  The visit of Messrs. Jacques and Gilmore to the Rebel Capital on an informal Peace-errand was, at least, valuable in this, that it secured from the head and front of the armed Conspiracy, Jefferson Davis himself, the following definite statement:  \"I desire Peace as much as you do; I deplore bloodshed as much as you do; but I feel that not one drop of the blood shed in this War is on my hands.  I can look up to my God and say this.  I tried all in my power to avert this War.  I saw it coming, and for twelve years I worked night and day to prevent it; but I could not.  The North was mad and blind; it would not let us govern ourselves; and so the War came: and now it must go on till the last man of this generation falls in his tracks, and his children seize his musket and fight our battle, unless you acknowledge our right to self-government.  We are not fighting for Slavery.  We are fighting for INDEPENDENCE; and that, or EXTERMINATION, we WILL have.\"       [The Nation, July 2, 1885, contained the following      remarks, which may be pertinently quoted in support of this      authoritative statement that the South was \"not fighting for      Slavery,\" but for Independence--that is to say: for Power, and what      would flow from it.]       [\"The Charleston News and Courier a fortnight ago remarked that      'not more than one Southern soldier in ten or fifteen was a      Slaveholder, or had any interest in Slave Property.'  The      Laurensville Herald disputed the statement, and declared that 'the      Southern Army was really an Army of Slaveholders and the sons of      Slaveholders.'  The Charleston paper stands by its original      position, and cites figures which are conclusive.  The Military      population of the eleven States which seceded, according to the      census of 1860, was 1,064,193.  The entire number of Slaveholders      in the Country at the same time was 383,637, but of these 77,335      lived in the Border States, so that the number in the Seceding      States was only 306,302.  Most of the small Slaveholders, however,      were not Slave-owners, but Slave hirers, and Mr. De Bow, the      statistician who supervised the census of 1850, estimated that but      little over half the holders were actually"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7140"],["title","The Great Conspiracy, Complete (#1)"],["body","OF THE KANSAS-NEBRASKA STRUGGLE--THE UNHOLY ALLIANCE--THE TWO POINTS AT ISSUE--THE \"WHITE MAN'S\" COUNTRY --DOUGLAS'S PLEDGES TO WEBSTER AND CLAY--DOUGLAS'S SPRINGFIELD SPEECH, JULY 17TH--THE IRRECONCILABLE PRINCIPLES AT ISSUE BETWEEN LINCOLN AND HIMSELF--LINCOLN'S GREAT SPEECH, AT SPRINGFIELD, THE SAME EVENING --DOUGLAS'S TRIUMPHANT MARCHES AND ENTRIES--THE \"OFFICES SEEN IN HIS ROUND, JOLLY, FRUITFUL FACE\"--LINCOLN'S LEAN-FACED FIGHT, FOR PRINCIPLE ALONE--DOUGLAS'S VARIOUS SPEECHES REVIEWED--THE REAL QUESTION BETWEEN REPUBLICANS AND DOUGLAS MEN AND THE BUCHANAN MEN--JACKSON'S VETO OF THE NATIONAL BANK CHARTER--DEMOCRATIC REVOLT AGAINST THE SUPREME COURT DECISION--VINDICATION OF CLAY--\"NEGRO EQUALITY\"--MR.
