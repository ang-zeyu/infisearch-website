What I mean is, I know more about the Gold Coast, the Ivory Coast and the Slave Coast than any man in this or any other country and have got more good solid coin out of them.\"  Mr. Beasley looked up admiringly from his plate.  Here was evidently a man after his own heart.  \"The Slave Coast?\" echoed Harry inquiringly, \"I thought--\"  \"Thought there wasn't no more slaves, eh?\" inquired Mr. Barr amiably, swallowing his coffee with a noise like water running out of a bath tub, \"wall, that's because yer young.  When yer git older you'll larn that there's money in everything here's a demand for, and there's just as big a demand for slaves on some rubber plantations I could tell yer of as there ever was in the old days of the South--and more money in 'em on account of its being more dangerouser.\"  \"Do you mean to say that there is slave-running now?\" asked Mr. Beasley, while both Frank and Harry wondered and Lathrop looked uncomfortable.  \"Sure I do,\" chirped Mr. Barr, \"but no more for me.  There's too many British gunboats and 'Merican gunboats and Dutch gunboats and what not about now to make it comfortable or healthy.  No, I've retired from that business--but there's money in it,\" he concluded with a regretful sigh.  Immediately Mr. Barr had concluded his breakfast--and with his apparently slim accommodations it was a wonder to the boys where he put it all--he snapped, with a flinty glint of his small pig-like eyes:  \"Now, let's git down to business.  You boys want ter make a bit of money?\"  \"'To be sure we do,\" replied Frank, \"but we don't want to make any that isn't honest money.\"  \"We'll, there's no accounting for boys nowadays,\" sighed Mr. Barr, \"however, you needn't worry about this money--there'll be plenty of it and it'll all be good honest coin.\"  \"What do you wish us to do?\" demanded Frank.  \"Just this: Mr. Beasley here and me is in on a deal in ivory.  That is, we were, but the big cache we had hoarded up in the Kuroworo Mountains in the Bambara country has been stolen by a rival trader, an Arab named Muley-Hassan.  We know where he's hidden it and we know, too, that he won't dare to bring it out till he thinks that we aren't watching him.  Now the time is ripe for a big deal in Ivory. There is a shortage in the market.  Prices will go up sky high.  If we get it out in time we'll make a barrel of coin, but if we don't we stand to lose heavily.\"  Mr. Beasley gave a groan; to the boys' amazement he seemed to be about to collapse.  Lathrop too looked ill and anxious.  Old Barr paid no attention, however, but went on.  \"Now, I heard about you boys and your air-ship, and I heard, too, that you was planning a little trip to Africa and thought you might like to combine business and pleasure.\"  He drew from his pocket a much-thumbed, crudely drawn map and spread it out on the table.  How he obtained it, the boys never learned exactly, but they heard later that a treacherous attendant of the ivory dealer had sold it to him for a good round sum.  \"This country down here,\" he said, indicating it with a black rimmed finger nail, \"is the Southern Soudan.  Here's the Bambara country to the north of Uasule.  Now right at this point, in the Moon Mountain range,\"--he pointed to a red-marked trail zigzagging across the map to the range and terminating in a red star--\"right at that thar point, old Muley-Hassan, the Arab, has hidden our ivory cache.  You see the latitude and longitude is marked and furthermore--and here's the most remarkable part of it--you will know the spot when you see it by the fact that the mountains above the cache present an exact facsimile of an upturned human face.  In a direct line drawn from the nose of this face, where you see the red star, lies the ivory.\"  The boys were deeply interested.  Unpleasant as was the impression old Barr had made on them, yet what he was disclosing was impressive; but as yet they did not show that they were anything more than casually struck by it.  \"Well, Mr. Barr?\" said Frank, as the old matt paused impressively.  \"Well--\" said Mr. Barr, \"the scoundrel stole it and it's up to you to get it out of there, if you will undertake it.\"  \"How does it depend on us?\" asked Frank.  \"In just this way.  Muley-Hassan has his eye on us---we can do nothing toward locating the ivory.  You can pitch a camp there and scout about for it in your aeroplane or dirigible or whatever you call it.\"  \"But even if we do find the Arab's hiding-place, what good does that do?\" objected Frank.  \"We can arrange with the French government to send soldiers up into the country and get the stuff out, if necessary,\" readily replied the wrinkled old ivory dealer, \"but we can make no move till the cave is located.  If they suspected we were after it, they would soon move it to another hiding-place or even pack it cross-country to the Nile and ship it out by the Mediterranean.\"  Frank and Harry asked leave to hold a brief consultation at the conclusion of which, they announced that they would think the matter over, and see Mr. Barr at his office the next day.  The old man was far too shrewd to insist on a decision then and there, and so he left the hotel with the boys' promise to consider the matter carefully.  As for Frank and Harry, they had pretty well made up their minds not to have anything to do with Mr. Barr, but an unforeseen circumstance altered their determination.  As Barr left the room with Mr. Beasley, Lathrop turned on them with troubled eyes.  \"Will you do it, Frank?\" he asked anxiously.  \"Please say yes.\"  \"Why, Lathrop, whatever is the matter,\" asked Harry, noticing the almost painful anxiety, with which the boy looked at Frank and hung on his decision.  \"It's just this,\" said the boy in a voice that shook, as he tried to steady it, \"if that ivory isn't found, we shall be ruined.  My father will be beggared.\"  \"Beggared,\" exclaimed both the Boy Aviators who had regarded Mr. Beasley--as indeed did his friends in general--as one of the \"best fixed\" business men in New York.  \"It's true,\"' said Lathrop, despairingly.  \"He has been speculating foolishly and entered into an agreement with this man Barr to borrow money for still further stock deals.  The only hope he has of paying his debts is the realization of the profits he could have made on the ivory.  Its theft was a bitter blow to him, not so much for his own sake, as for my mother and sisters.  Myself I don't care, I can get out and work, but it would break my heart to see them reduced to poverty.\"  The situation was a difficult one for the Chester Boys.  They had taken a hearty dislike to the crafty old ivory merchant and had made up their minds not to enter into any enterprise in which he was interested.  Here, however, was a new complication.  \"Give us half-an-hour, Lathrop,\" said Frank at length, and the two boys withdrew to another room to talk the matter over.  It was ten minutes past the agreed time when they came back.  In the meantime Lathrop had been joined by his father and the two had waited in painful anticipation for the Boy Aviators' verdict.  \"Well--,\" began Lathrop eagerly as the two boys with grave faces reentered the room.  \"Well,\" said Frank, with a smile, \"I guess we'll help you out, Lath.\"  Tears stood in the eyes of both Mr. Beasley and his son, as in shaky voices they endeavored to thank the Chester Boys.  \"That's all right, Lathrop,\" said Frank at length--\"turn about's fair play.  You drove the aeroplane to Bellman's island you remember and saved us--now, we'll save you and your father, if we can--how long can you give us, Mr. Beasley?\" he asked, briskly turning to the thoroughly humbled merchant.  \"Eight weeks--if I hear from you by cable in eight weeks I can keep things going,\" was the reply.  \"Phew!\" whistled Frank, \"that's not an awful lot of time.\"  \"Can you do it, Frank?\" asked Lathrop eagerly.  \"We'll try as hard as we know how,\" was the modest answer.  \"And--and you'll take me along?\" faltered Lathrop.  \"Sure, you can come as your father's representative at large,\" laughed Frank.     CHAPTER III  THE DARK CONTINENT   About a month after the events related in the last chapter the bluff-bowed French coasting steamer, Admiral Dupont, dropped anchor in the shallow roadstead off the steamy harbor of Fort Assini on the far-famed Ivory Coast.  A few days before, the boys had left Sierra Leone and engaged quarters on the cockroach-infested little craft for the voyage down the coast.  It was blisteringly hot and from off the shore there was borne on the wind the peculiar smell that every traveler knows as \"African.\"  It is the essence of the dark continent.  Our young voyagers and Ben sniffed at it eagerly.  \"Smells like marigolds,\" said Billy at last--and it did.  But there was soon plenty more to discuss than the strange appearance of the town, which in reality was little more than a big village with here and there one, or two houses of some pretension scattered about.  For the rest, it consisted of the wickerwork huts of the natives.  Back of the town were dense forests and beyond these again a long blue line of hills.  An unhealthful looking lagoon lay between the houses and the mainland, into which the boys had been told the Bia River, up which they were to begin their voyage to the interior, emptied.  A broad yellow beach stretched in front of the houses and from this, as soon as the little steamer dropped anchor, whaleboats and canoes in great numbers were launched through what looked to be a thunderous"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6906"],["title","The Lost Trail (#1)"],["body","of the enemies changed.  The lad passed under the limbs staring unflinchingly aloft.  When exactly beneath, the cougar was hidden for an instant from sight, but, recognizing the changing conditions, he quickly lifted his head to the right, and the lad again saw the greenish glare, the white teeth, and blood red mouth.  He traced the outlines of the sinewy body close along the limb, and through which he could have driven a bullet with fatal certainty.  The \"painter,\" whose scream is often mistaken for the cry of a human being, uttered an occasional snarling growl as he looked down on the lad.  His attitude and manner seemed to say: \"I've got my eye on you, young man!  Walk very straight or you will find yourself in trouble.\"  The probability that a cougar is gathering his muscles on a limb with the intention of bounding down on one's shoulders, is enough to make the bravest man uneasy.  Jack Carleton did feel a creeping chill, but the same pride which prevented him deviating a hair's-breadth from the trail, would not allow him to increase or retard his gait.  \"If you think you can make me run, old fellow,\" he muttered, with his gaze still fixed on the beast, \"you are mistaken.  We don't meet wild animals in Kentucky that are able to drive us out of the woods. You needn't fancy, either, that I am in any hurry to walk away from you.\"  And, to show the contempt in which he held the beast, the youth at that moment came to a full stop, turned about and faced him.     CHAPTER II  WHAT A RIFLE-SHOT DID   The moment the young Kentuckian assumed this attitude, he became aware that the cougar had determined upon hostilities.  With a rasping snarl he buried his claws in the shaggy bark, pressing his body still closer to the limb, and then shot downward straight toward Jack, who was too vigilant to be caught unprepared. Leaping backward a couple of steps, he brought his gun to his shoulder, like a flash, and fired almost at the moment the animal left his perch.  There could be no miss under the circumstances, and the \"painter\" received his death wound, as may be said, while in mid-air.  He struck the ground with a heavy thump, made a blind leap toward the youthful hunter, who recoiled several steps more, and then, after a brief struggle, the beast lay dead.  During these moments, Jack Carleton, following the rule he was taught when first given his gun, occupied himself with reloading the weapon.  A charge of powder was poured from the hollow cow's horn, with its wooden stopper, into the palm of his hand, and this went rattling like fine sand down the barrel.  The square piece of muslin was hammered on top until the ramrod almost bounded from the gun; then the bullet which the youthful hunter had molded himself, was shoved gently but firmly downward, backed by another bit of muslin. The ramrod was pushed into its place, and the hammer, clasping the yellow, translucent flint, was drawn far back, like the jaw of a wild cat, and the black grains sprinkled into the pan.  The jaw was slowly let back so as to hold the priming fast, and the old fashioned rifle, such as our grandfathers were accustomed to use, was ready for duty.  Jack surveyed the motionless figure on the ground and said:  \"I don't think you'll ever amount to anything again as a painter; at any rate, you ain't likely to drop on to a fellow's head when he is walking under a tree.\"  And, without giving him any further notice, he turned about and resumed his walk toward the Mississippi.  It was vain, however, for him to seek to suppress his anxiety.  The trail of the flying horse still indicated that he was going on a dead run, and some unusual cause must have impelled him to do so. Jack could not doubt that his friend Otto was driven to such severe effort by the appearance of Indians, but it would seem that the terrific gait of the Steed ought to have taken him beyond all danger very speedily, whereas, for more than a mile, the pace showed not the slightest diminution.  At the most, Otto was not more than an hour in advance, and his friend, therefore, had good reason to fear he was in the immediate vicinity of the dreaded red men.  The young hunter was brave, but he was not reckless.  He had refused to turn aside to avoid a collision with the cougar, but he did not hesitate to leave the trail, in the hope of escaping the savages who were likely to be attracted by the report of the gun.  From the beginning the lad had stepped as lightly as possible, bringing his feet softly but squarely down on the ground, after the fashion of the American Indian, when threading his way through the trackless forest.  He now used the utmost care in leaving the trail, for none knew better than he the amazing keenness of the dark eyes that were liable to scan the ground over which he had passed.  Not until he was several rods from the footprints of the flying horse did he advance with anything like assurance.  He then moved with more certainty until he reached a chestnut, whose trunk was broad enough to afford all the concealment he could desire.  Stepping behind this, Jack assumed a position which gave him a view of the trail, with no likelihood of being seen, unless the suspicion of the Indians should be directed to the spot.  \"If they are coming, it is time they showed themselves.\"  The words were yet in the mouth of the youth, when something seemed to twinkle and flicker among the trees, in advance of the point where he had turned aside from the path.  A second look allowed that two Indian warriors were returning along the trail.  He recognized them as Shawanoes--one of the fiercest tribes that resisted the march of civilization a century ago.  It may be said that they corresponded to the Apaches of the present day.  The couple were scrutinizing the ground, as they advanced with heads thrown forward and their serpent-like eyes flitting from side to side.  Manifestly they were expecting to discover certain parties along the trail itself.  There may have been something in the peculiar sound of the rifle, which raised their suspicions, though it is hard to understand wherein the report of two similarly made weapons can possess any perceptible difference.  Be that as it may, that which Jack Carleton feared had taken place--the shot which killed the cougar brought far more dangerous enemies to the spot.  The lad would have had no difficulty in picking off one of the warriors, but he had not the remotest intention of doing so.  There could be no justification for such a wanton act, and the consequences could not fail to be disastrous to himself.  He was never better prepared to support the creed of the frontiersmen who would willingly leave the red men unmolested if they in turn sought to do them no harm.  The Shawanoes soon passed by, making no pause until they reached the carcass of the panther.  They quickly saw the bullet-wound, between his fore legs, and understood that his heart had been pierced while in the act of leaping from his perch upon the hunter beneath.  A brief scrutiny of the ground brought to light the impressions of the calf-skin shoes of him who had fired the fatal shot.  They understood at once that the party was a white person, and, judging from the size of the footprints, he clearly was an adult-one who, it was safe to conclude, was able to taking good care of himself; but it must have been a relief to the warriors when their examination of the earth showed that only a single member of the detested race had been concerned in the death of the cougar.  That which followed was precisely what the watcher expected.  The moment the red men were certain of the direction taken by the hunter they started along the same line.  The foremost looked down for an instant at the ground, and then seemed to dart a glance at every visible point around him.  The other warrior did not once look down, but guarded against running into any ambush for it need not be said that the task on which they were engaged was most delicate and dangerous.  The American Indian cannot excel the white man in woodcraft and subtlety, and no Kentucky pioneer ever stood still and allowed a dusky foe to creep upon him.  It will be conceded that a point had been reached where Jack Carleton had good cause for alarm.  Those Shawanoe were following his trail, and they had but to keep it up for a short distance when he was certain to be \"uncovered.\"  \"I wish there was only one of them,\" muttered the youth, stealthily peering from behind the tree; \"it will be hard to manage two.\"  The coolness of Jack was extraordinary.  Though he felt the situation was critical in the highest degree, yet there was not a tremor of the muscles, nor blanching of the countenance, as it would seem was inevitable when such a desperate encounter impended.  There was a single, shadowy hope; it was fast growing dark in the woods, and the eyes of the Shawanoes, keen as they were, must soon fail them.  The sun had set and twilight already filled the forest arches with gloom.  Peering around the bark, Jack saw the leading Indian bend lower, leaving to the other the task of guarding against mishap.  He walked more slowly; it was plain his task was not only difficult, but was becoming more so every moment.  Jack followed the movements with rapt attention.  Knowing the precise point where he had left the path, his heart throbbed faster than was its wont, when he saw his enemies close to the tingle in his course.  A half minute later they were beyond--they had overrun his trail.  A short distance only was passed, when the warriors seemed to suspect the truth.  They came to a halt, and the trail-hunter sank upon his knees.  His head was so close to the ground that it looked as if he were drawing lines and figures with his curving nose, which slowly circled around and back and forth.  At the same time the palm of his right hand gently moved over the leaves, touching them as lightly as the falling snowflakes, and with as wonderful delicacy"]]]
