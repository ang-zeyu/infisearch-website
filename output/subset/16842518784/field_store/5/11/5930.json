And as the building progressed, Mr. Scobell's active mind had soared above the original idea of domestic coziness to far greater heights of ingenuity. Each of the rooms was furnished and arranged in a different style. The note of individuality extended even to the _croupiers_. Thus, a man with money at his command could wander from the Dutch room, where, in the picturesque surroundings of a Dutch kitchen, _croupiers_ in the costume of Holland ministered to his needs, to the Japanese room, where his coin would be raked in by quite passable imitations of the Samurai. If he had any left at this point, he was free to dispose of it under the auspices of near-Hindoos in the Indian room, of merry Swiss peasants in the Swiss room, or in other appropriately furnished apartments of red-shirted, Bret Harte miners, fur-clad Esquimaux, or languorous Spaniards. He could then, if a man of spirit, who did not know when he was beaten, collect the family jewels, and proceed down the main hall, accompanied by the strains of an excellent band, to the office of a gentlemanly pawnbroker, who spoke seven languages like a native and was prepared to advance money on reasonable security in all of them.  It was a colossal venture, but it suffered from the defect from which most big things suffer; it moved slowly. That it also moved steadily was to some extent a consolation to Mr. Scobell. Undoubtedly it would progress quicker and quicker, as time went on, until at length the Casino became a permanent gold mine. But at present it was being conducted at a loss. It was inevitable, but it irked Mr. Scobell. He paced the island and brooded. His mind dwelt incessantly on the problem. Ideas for promoting the prosperity of his nursling came to him at all hours--at meals, in the night watches, when he was shaving, walking, washing, reading, brushing his hair.  And now one had come to him as he stood looking at the view from the window of his morning-room, listening absently to his sister Marion as she read stray items of interest from the columns of the _New York Herald_, and had caused him to utter the exclamation recorded at the beginning of the chapter.         *       *       *       *       *  \"By Heck!\" he said. \"Read that again, Marion. I gottan idea.\"  Miss Scobell, deep in her paper, paid no attention. Few people would have taken her for the sister of the financier. She was his exact opposite in almost every way. He was small, jerky and aggressive; she, tall, deliberate and negative. She was one of those women whom nature seems to have produced with the object of attaching them to some man in a peculiar position of independent dependence, and who defy the imagination to picture them in any other condition whatsoever. One could not see Miss Scobell doing anything but pour out her brother's coffee, darn his socks, and sit placidly by while he talked. Yet it would have been untrue to describe her as dependent upon him. She had a detached mind. Though her whole life had been devoted to his comfort and though she admired him intensely, she never appeared to give his conversation any real attention. She listened to him much as she would have listened to a barking Pomeranian.  \"Marion!\" cried Mr. Scobell.  \"A five-legged rabbit has been born in Carbondale, Southern Illinois,\" she announced.  Mr. Scobell cursed the five-legged rabbit.  \"Never mind about your rabbits. I want to hear that piece you read before. The one about the Prince of Monaco. Will--you--listen, Marion!\"  \"The Prince of Monaco, dear? Yes. He has caught another fish or something of that sort, I think. Yes. A fish with 'telescope eyes,' the paper says. And very convenient too, I should imagine.\"  Mr. Scobell thumped the table.  \"I've got it. I've found out what's the matter with this darned place. I see why the Casino hasn't struck its gait.\"  \"_I_ think it must be the _croupiers_, dear. I'm sure I never heard of _croupiers_ in fancy costume before. It doesn't seem right. I'm sure people don't like those nasty Hindoos. I am quite nervous myself when I go into the Indian room. They look at me so oddly.\"  \"Nonsense! That's the whole idea of the place, that it should be different. People are sick and tired of having their money gathered in by seedy-looking Dagoes in second-hand morning coats. We give 'em variety. It's not the Casino that's wrong: it's the darned island. What's the use of a republic to a place like this? I'm not saying that you don't want a republic for a live country that's got its way to make in the world; but for a little runt of a sawn-off, hobo, one-night stand like this you gotta have something picturesque, something that'll advertise the place, something that'll give a jolt to folks' curiosity, and make 'em talk! There's this Monaco gook. He snoops around in his yacht, digging up telescope-eyed fish, and people talk about it. 'Another darned fish,' they say. 'That's the 'steenth bite the Prince of Monaco has had this year.' It's like a soap advertisement. It works by suggestion. They get to thinking about the Prince and his pop-eyed fishes, and, first thing they know, they've packed their grips and come along to Monaco to have a peek at him. And when they're there, it's a safe bet they aren't going back again without trying to get a mess of easy money from the Bank. That's what this place wants. Whoever heard of this blamed Republic doing anything except eat and sleep? They used to have a prince here 'way back in eighty-something. Well, I'm going to have him working at the old stand again, right away.\"  Miss Scobell looked up from her paper, which she had been reading with absorbed interest throughout tins harangue.  \"Dear?\" she said enquiringly.  \"I say I'm going to have him back again,\" said Mr. Scobell, a little damped. \"I wish you would listen.\"  \"I think you're quite right, dear. Who?\"  \"The Prince. Do listen, Marion. The Prince of this island, His Highness, the Prince of Mervo. I'm going to send for him and put him on the throne again.\"  \"You can't, dear. He's dead.\"  \"I know he's dead. You can't faze me on the history of this place. He died in ninety-one. But before he died he married an American girl, and there's a son, who's in America now, living with his uncle. It's the son I'm going to send for. I got it all from General Poineau. He's a royalist. He'll be tickled to pieces when Johnny comes marching home again. Old man Poineau told me all about it. The Prince married a girl called Westley, and then he was killed in an automobile accident, and his widow went back to America with the kid, to live with her brother. Poineau says he could lay his hand on him any time he pleased.\"  \"I hope you won't do anything rash, dear,\" said his sister comfortably. \"I'm sure we don't want any horrid revolution here, with people shooting and stabbing each other.\"  \"Revolution?\" cried Mr. Scobell. \"Revolution! Well, I should say nix! Revolution nothing. I'm the man with the big stick in Mervo. Pretty near every adult on this island is dependent on my Casino for his weekly envelope, and what I say goes--without argument. I want a prince, so I gotta have a prince, and if any gazook makes a noise like a man with a grouch, he'll find himself fired.\"  Miss Scobell turned to her paper again.  \"Very well, dear,\" she said. \"Just as you please. I'm sure you know best.\"  \"Sure!\" said her brother. \"You're a good guesser. I'll go and beat up old man Poineau right away.\"     CHAPTER III  JOHN   Ten days after Mr. Scobell's visit to General Poineau, John, Prince of Mervo, ignorant of the greatness so soon to be thrust upon him, was strolling thoughtfully along one of the main thoroughfares of that outpost of civilization, Jersey City. He was a big young man, tall and large of limb. His shoulders especially were of the massive type expressly designed by nature for driving wide gaps in the opposing line on the gridiron. He looked like one of nature's center-rushes, and had, indeed, played in that position for Harvard during two strenuous seasons. His face wore an expression of invincible good-humor. He had a wide, good-natured mouth, and a pair of friendly gray eyes. One felt that he liked his follow men and would be surprised and pained if they did not like him.  As he passed along the street, he looked a little anxious. Sherlock Holmes--and possibly even Doctor Watson--would have deduced that he had something on his conscience.  At the entrance to a large office building, he paused, and seemed to hesitate. Then, as if he had made up his mind to face an ordeal, he went in and pressed the button of the elevator.  Leaving the elevator at the third floor, he went down the passage, and pushed open a door on which was inscribed the legend, \"Westley, Martin & Co.\"  A stout youth, walking across the office with his hands full of papers, stopped in astonishment.  \"Hello, John Maude!\" he cried.  The young man grinned.  \"Say, where have you been? The old man's been as mad as a hornet since he found you had quit without leave. He was asking for you just now.\"  \"I guess I'm up against it,\" admitted John cheerfully.  \"Where did you go yesterday?\"  John put the thing to him candidly, as man to man.  \"See here, Spiller, suppose you got up one day and found it was a perfectly bully morning, and remembered that the Giants were playing the Athletics, and looked at your mail, and saw that someone had sent you a pass for the game--\"  \"Were you at the ball-game? You've got the nerve! Didn't you know there would be trouble?\"  \"Old man,\" said John frankly, \"I could no more have turned down that pass-- Oh, well, what's the use? It was just great. I suppose I'd better tackle the boss now. It's got to be done.\"  It was not a task to which many would have looked forward. Most of those who came into contact with Andrew Westley were afraid of him. He was a capable rather than a lovable man, and too self-controlled to be quite human. There was no recoil in him,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6958"],["title","Frank on the Lower Mississippi (#1)"],["body","to the crew of the Boxer. The guerrillas would appear when least expected, and the levee afforded them a secure hiding-place from which they could not be driven, either with big guns or small arms. They were fatal marksmen, too; and during the week following, the Boxer's crew lost ten men. One rebel in particular attracted their attention, and his reckless courage excited their admiration. He rode a large white horse, and although rendered a prominent mark for the rifles of the sailors, he always escaped unhurt. He would ride boldly out in full view of the vessel, patiently wait for someone to expose himself, when the sharp crack of his rifle would be followed by the report made to the captain, \"A man shot, sir.\"  Frank had selected this man as a worthy foe-man; and every time he appeared the young officer was on the watch for him. He was very expert with the rifle, and after a few shots, he succeeded in convincing the rebel that the safest place for him was behind the levee. One morning the foe appeared in stronger force than usual, and conspicuous among them was the white horse and his daring rider. The fight that ensued had continued for perhaps half an hour, when the quartermaster reported the dispatch-boat approaching. As soon as she came within range, the guerrillas directed their fire against her, to which the latter replied briskly from two guns mounted on her forecastle. The leader of the rebels was constantly in view, cheering on his men, and discharging his rifle as fast as he could reload. Frank fired several shots at him, and finding that, as usual, they were without effect, he asked the captain's permission to try a howitzer on him, which was granted. He ran below, trained the gun to his satisfaction, and waited for an opportunity to fire, during which the dispatch-boat came alongside and commenced putting off a supply of stores.  At length the rebel mounted the levee, and reigning in his horse, sat in his saddle gazing at the vessels, as if not at all concerned. He presented a fair mark, and Frank fired, but the shell went wild and burst in the woods, far beyond the rebel, who, however, beat a hasty retreat behind the levee.  \"Oh, what a shot!\" shouted a voice through the trumpet that led from the pilot-house to the main deck. \"What a shot--altogether too much elevation.\"  \"Who's that, I wonder?\" soliloquized Frank. \"It _was_ a poor shot, but I'd like to see that fellow, whoever he is, do any better.\"  After giving orders to have the gun reloaded and secured, he ran into the wardroom to look after his mail, at the same time inquiring of every one he met, \"Who was that making fun of my shooting?\" But no one knew, nor cared to trouble himself about the matter, for the subject of conversation was, \"We've got a new paymaster.\"  Frank was pleased to hear this, but was still determined to find the person who had laughed at his marksmanship, when he saw a pair of feet descending the ladder that led from the cabin to the pilot-house, and a moment afterward, a smart looking young officer, dressed in the uniform of a paymaster, stood in the wardroom, and upon discovering Frank, thrust out his hand and greeted him with--  \"What a shot! Been in the service more than two years, and\"--  \"Why, Archie Winters, is this you?\" exclaimed Frank, joyfully.  \"_Paymaster_ Winters, if you please\" replied Archie, with mock dignity.  \"How came you here? What are you doing? Got any money?\" hurriedly inquired Frank.  \"Got plenty of funds,\" replied his cousin. \"But I say, Frank, how long has this fighting been going on?\"  \"Every day for the last week.\"  Archie shrugged his shoulders, and looked blank.  \"I guess I had better go back to Cairo,\" said he; \"these rebels, I hear, shoot very carelessly. Just before we came alongside here, I was standing on the deck of the dispatch-boat, and some fellow cracked away at me, sending the bullet altogether too close to my head for comfort.\"  \"Oh, that's nothing, so long as he didn't hit you. You'll get used to that before you have been here a week. But, Archie, are you really ordered to this vessel?\"  Archie at once produced his orders, and, sure enough, he was an acting assistant paymaster, and ordered to \"report to the commanding officer of the U. S. S. Boxer for duty on board that vessel.\"  During the two years that Archie had been in the fleet-paymaster's office he had, by strict attention to his duties, worked his way up from \"writer\" to corresponding clerk. He had had ample opportunity to learn the duties of paymaster, and one day he suddenly took it into his head to make application for the position. He immediately wrote to his father, informing him of his intention, procured his letters of recommendation, and a month afterward received the appointment.  Hearing, through Frank, that the Boxer was without a paymaster, he succeeded in getting ordered to her, and, as he had not written to his cousin of his good fortune, the latter, as may be supposed, was taken completely by surprise.  Archie was speedily introduced to the officers of the vessel, who were pleased with his off-hand, easy manners, and delighted with the looks of a small safe which he had brought with him, for they knew, by the very particular orders he gave concerning it, that there was money in it.  At the end of an hour the rebels seemed to grow weary of the fight, for they drew off their forces; then, as soon as it was safe on deck, the cousins seated themselves on the guard, to \"talk over old times.\" Frank gave descriptions of the fights in which he had engaged since they last met, and also related stories of mess-room life, with which Archie was entirely unacquainted; and to show him how things were conducted, told him of the jokes the officers frequently played upon each other.  \"Speaking of jokes,\" said Archie, \"reminds me of a little affair I had a hand in at Cairo.  \"While the commandant of the station was absent on a leave, his place was supplied by a gentleman whom, for short, I will call Captain Smith. He was a regular officer, had grown gray in the service, and was one of the most eccentric men I ever saw. He was extremely nervous, too, and if a steamer happened to whistle while passing the wharf-boat, it would make him almost wild.  \"One day, a man who lived off somewhere in the woods, came down to Cairo to get an appointment for his son as master's mate. Our office, you know, was just to the right of the door, and, if there was any thing that bothered me, it was for some body to stick his head over the railing when I was busy, and ask, 'Is the commandant of the station in?' There was an orderly on watch day and night, always ready to answer such questions, and besides, there was an abundance of notices on the walls pointing out the different offices; but in spite of this, every stranger that came in must stop and make inquiries of me.  \"Well, this man came into the office, and as he had evidently never been there before, judging by the way he gaped at every thing, I told him that it was after office hours, and that he must call again the next morning about nine o'clock. He took a turn or two across the floor (by-the-way, he wore squeaking boots, that made a noise like a steam-whistle), and finally went out.  \"The next evening, just as I was locking up my desk, he came in again, and I repeated what I had told him the night before, that he must come at nine o'clock in the _morning_--not at night--if he wished to see the captain, and he went out, after making noise enough with his squeaking boots to set a nervous man's teeth on edge. Now, would you believe it, that evening, after I had finished my work, and was starting out for supper, I saw this man coming up the stairs. He met me with the usual question, 'Is the captain in?' and I suddenly hit upon a plan to get rid of him, for I had made up my mind that the man didn't know what he was about; so I replied:  \"'What do you want? Why don't you come here during our office hours, if you want to see me?'  \"I spoke in a gruff voice, and I was so bundled up--for the night was very cold--that I knew he wouldn't recognize me.  \"'I've been busy all day, cap'in,' said he; 'but the fact is'--  \"I was afraid that I would be obliged to stand there in the cold and listen to a long, uninteresting yarn, so I interrupted him.  \"'Speak quick, and don't keep me waiting.'  \"'Wal, cap'in,' said he, 'I heerd you are in want of officers, an' I come to get a place for my son; I hear the wages are purty good.'  \"'Yes,' I replied, 'we do want officers; but does your son know anything about a ship?'  \"'Oh, yes? He's run the river as deck-hand for goin' nigh on to three year.'  \"'Then he ought to know something, certainly. Come around tomorrow morning, at nine o'clock exactly, and I'll see what can be done for you. Now, mind, I say nine o'clock in the morning.'  \"Well, the next morning, at the appointed time, to my utter astonishment, the man was on hand, and, as usual, commenced walking up and down the floor with his squeaking boots. The noise disturbed everyone within hearing, and presently the captain, who was in his office, and so busy that he hardly knew what he was about, spoke in a sharp tone:  \"'Orderly, pull off those squeaking boots!'  \"'It isn't me, sir.' said the orderly; 'it's a gentleman out here waiting to see you, sir.'  \"'Then send him in--send him in at once, so that I can get rid of that noise.'  \"The man was accordingly shown into the presence of the captain, while I listened with both ears to hear what was said.  \"'Mornin', cap'in,' he began; 'I reckon I'm here on time.'  \"'Time! what time? What do you want?' inquired the captain, who always spoke very fast, as though he were in a hurry to get through with what he had to say. 'What do you want, my good man. Be lively now.'  \"'Why, cap'in, I come here to get that appointment for my son in this ere navy.'  \"'Appointment! For your son!' repeated the captain. 'Who is he? I never heard of him.'  \"'Wal, really"]]]
