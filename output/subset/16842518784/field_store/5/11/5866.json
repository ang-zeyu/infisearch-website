Sticking piece. 4. Shin and thick end of brisket. 5 and 6. Brisket piece. 7 and 8. Navel end of brisket.  The rattle-ran or plate piece is generally corned, and is considered one of the best cuts for pressed beef. The shoulder of mutton is used for stews, beef _à la mode_, roasts and steaks, and is also corned. The sticking piece, commonly called the back of the shoulder, but which is really the front, is used for stews, soups, pie meat and for corning. The shin is used for soups, and the brisket and ribs for corning and for stews and soups. One of the best pieces for corning is the navel end of the brisket. The middle cut of the rattle-ran is also corned.   MUTTON.  Mutton is very nutritious and easily digested. The best quality will have clear, hard, white fat, and a good deal of it; the lean part will be juicy, firm and of a rather dark red color. When there is but little fat, and that is soft and yellow and the meat is coarse and stringy, you may be sure that the quality is poor. Mutton is much improved by being hung in a cool place for a week or more. At the North a leg will keep quite well for two or three weeks in winter, if hung in a cold, dry shed or cellar. Mutton, like beef, is first split through the back, and then the sides are divided, giving two fore and two hind quarters. Diagram No. 18 is of a whole carcass of mutton, and half of it is numbered to show the pieces into which the animal is cut for use.  [Illustration: DIAGRAM NO. 18.]  EXPLANATION OF DIAGRAM NO. 18.  1, 2, 4. Hind quarter.  3, 5, 5. Fore quarter  1. Leg. 2. Loin. 3. Shoulder. 4. Flank. 5,5. Breast.   Hind Quarter of Mutton.  This consists of the leg and loin, and is the choicest cut. It makes a fine roast for a large family, but for a moderate-sized or small one either the leg or loin alone is better. A hind quarter taken from a prime animal will weigh from twenty to thirty pounds.   Leg of Mutton.  This joint is nearly always used for roasting and boiling. It has but little bone, as compared with the other parts of the animal, and is, therefore, an economical piece to select, though the price per pound be greater than that of any other cut. It is not common to find a good leg weighing under ten or twelve pounds. A leg is shown in plate No. 19.  [Illustration: PLATE NO. 19.]   Loin of Mutton.  In a loin, as cut in Boston, there are seven ribs, which make a good roast for a small family. This cut is particularly nice in hot weather. It is not as large as a leg, and the meat is, besides, of a lighter quality and more delicate flavor. The cost when the flank is taken off will be about seven cents more a pound than if the loin be sold with it on; but, unless you wish to use the flank for a soup, stew or haricot, it is the better economy to buy a trimmed piece and pay the higher price. When the two loins are joined they are called a saddle. Plate No. 20 shows a saddle and two French chops.  [Illustration: PLATE NO 20. SADDLE OF MUTTON AND FRENCH CHOPS.]   Fore Quarter of Mutton.  In this is included the shoulder and breast. When the shoulder-blade is taken out the quarter makes a good roast for a large family. The shoulder is separated from the breast by running a sharp knife between the two, starting at the curved dotted lines near the neck (shown in diagram No. 18), and cutting round to the end of the line. The shoulder is nice for roasting or boiling. The breast can be used for a roast, for broths, braising, stewing or cotelettes. Rib chops are also cut from the breast, which is, by the way, the cheapest part of the mutton.   Chops and Cutlets.  Chops are cut from the loin. They are called long when the flank is cut on them and short if without it. When part of the bone of the short chop is scraped clean it is called a French chop. The rolled chops sold by provision dealers are the long chops with the bone removed. One often sees them selling at a low price. They are then the poor parts of the mutton, like the flank, and will be found very expensive no matter how little is asked.   Prices.  The price of mutton varies with the seasons, but a table giving the average price may help the purchaser to an estimate of the comparative cost of each cut:   Hind Quarter,          15 cents.  Leg,                   17 cents.  Loin, with flank,      13 cents.  Loin, without flank,   20 cents.  Fore Quarter,           8 cents.  Trimmed Chops,         20 cents.  Untrimmed Chops,       12 cents.  When one has a large family it brings all kinds of meat considerably cheaper to buy large pieces untrimmed, as the trimmings can be used for soups, stews, etc.; but for a small family, it is much better to purchase only the part you want for immediate use. Although mutton costs less per pound than beef, it is no cheaper in the end, because to be good it must be fat, and mutton fat, unlike beef fat, cannot be employed for cooking purposes, as it gives a strong flavor to any article with which it is used.   LAMB.  Lamb is cut and sold like mutton. Being much smaller, however, a hind or fore quarter is not too large for a good-sized family. Lamb will not keep as long as mutton, for, being juicy, it taints more readily. It is of a delicate flavor until nearly a year old, when it begins to taste like mutton and is not so tender. The bones of a young lamb will be red, and the fat hard and white. This meat is in season from May to September.   VEAL.  The calf being so much larger than the sheep, the fore and hind quarters are not cooked together, and for an ordinary family both are not purchased. The animal is, however, cut into the same parts as mutton. The loin, breast and shoulder are used for roasting. Chops are cut from the loin and neck, those from the neck being called rib chops or cotelettes. The neck itself is used for stews, pies, fricassees, etc. The leg is used for cutlets, fricandeaux, stews and roasts, and for braising. The fillet of veal is a solid piece cut from the leg-- not like the tenderloin in beef, but used in much the same way. The lower part of the leg is called a knuckle, and is particularly nice for soups and sauces. Good veal will have white, firm fat, and the lean part a pinkish tinge. When extremely white it indicates that the calf has been bled before being killed, which is a great cruelty to the animal, besides greatly impoverishing the meat. When veal is too young it will be soft and of a bluish tinge. The calf should not be killed until at least six weeks old. Veal is in the market all the year, but the season is really from April to September, when the price is low. The leg costs more than any other joint, because it is almost wholly solid meat. The fillet costs from 20 to 25 cents; cutlets from the leg, 30 cents; chops from loin, 20 cents; loin for roast, 15 cents; breast, 10 to 12 cents. Veal is not nutritious nor easily digested. Many people cannot eat it in any form, but such a number of nice dishes can be made from it, and when in season the price is so low, that it will always be used for made dishes and soups.   PORK.  Pork, although not so much used in the fresh state as beef, mutton, lamb, etc., is extensively employed in the preparation of food. It is cut somewhat like mutton, but into more parts. Fresh young pork should be firm; the fat white, the lean a pale reddish color and the skin white and clear. When the fat is yellow and soft the pork is not of the best quality. After pork has been salted, if it is corn-fed, the fat will be of a delicate pinkish shade. When hogs weighing three and four hundred pounds are killed, the fat will not be very firm, particularly if they are not fed on corn. The amount of salt pork purchased at a time depends upon the mode of cooking in each family. If bought in small quantities it should be kept in a small jar or tub, half filled with brine, and a plate, smaller round than the tub, should be placed on top of the meat to press it under the brine.  The parts into which the hog is cut are called leg, loin, rib piece, shoulder, neck, flank, brisket, head and feet. The legs and shoulders are usually salted and smoked. The loin of a large hog has about two or three inches of the fat cut with the rind. This is used for salting, and the loin fresh for roasting. When, however, the hog is small, the loin is simply scored and roasted. The ribs are treated the same as the loin, and when the rind and fat are cut off are called spare-ribs. This piece makes a sweet roast. Having much more bone and less meat than the loin, it is not really any cheaper, although sold for less. The loin and ribs are both used for chops and steaks. The flank and brisket are corned. The head is sold while fresh for head- cheese, or is divided into two or four parts and corned, and is a favorite dish with many people. The feet are sometimes sold while fresh, but are more frequently first pickled. The fat taken from the inside of the hog and also all the trimmings are cooked slowly until dissolved. This, when strained and cooled, is termed lard. Many housekeepers buy the leaf or clear fat and try it out themselves. This is the best way, as one is then sure of a pure article.   Sausages.  These should be made wholly of pork, but there is often a large portion of beef in them. They should be firm, and rather dry on the outside.   Liver.  Calves' liver is the best in the market, and always brings the highest price. In some markets they will not cut it. A single liver costs about fifty cents, and when properly cooked, several delicious dishes can be made from it.  Beef liver is much larger and darker than the calves', has a stronger flavor and is not so tender. It is sold in small or large pieces at a low price.  Pigs' liver is not nearly as good as the calves' or beeves', and comes very much cheaper.   Hearts.  Both the calves' and beeves' hearts are used for roasting and braising. The calves' are rather small, but tenderer than the "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6749"],["title","Voyages of Samuel De Champlain — Volume 02 (#1)"],["body"," order to facilitate commerce with the Orientals, in the belief that this route would be shorter and less dangerous.  In the year 1496, the king of England commissioned John Cabot and his son Sebastian to engage in this search. [1] About the same time, Don Emanuel, king of Portugal, despatched on the same errand Gaspar Cortereal, who returned without attaining his object. Resuming his journeys the year after, he died in the undertaking; as did also his brother Michel, who was prosecuting it perseveringly. [2] In the years 1534 and 1535, Jacques Cartier received a like commission from King Francis I., but was arrested in his course. [3] Six years after, Sieur de Roberval, having renewed it, sent Jean Alfonse of Saintonge farther northward along the coast of Labrador; [4] but he returned as wise as the others. In the years 1576, 1577, and 1578, Sir Martin Frobisher, an Englishman, made three voyages along the northern coasts. Seven years later, Humphrey Gilbert, also an Englishman, set out with five ships, but suffered shipwreck on Sable Island, where three of his vessels were lost. In the same and two following years, John Davis, an Englishman, made three voyages for the same object; penetrating to the 72d degree, as far as a strait which is called at the present day by his name. After him, Captain Georges made also a voyage in 1590, but in consequence of the ice was compelled to return without having made any discovery. [5] The Hollanders, on their part, had no more precise knowledge in the direction of Nova Zembla.  So many voyages and discoveries without result, and attended with so much hardship and expense, have caused us French in late years to attempt a permanent settlement in those lands which we call New France, [6] in the hope of thus realizing more easily this object; since the voyage in search of the desired passage commences on the other side of the ocean, and is made along the coast of this region. [7] These considerations had induced the Marquis de la Roche, in 1598, to take a commission from the king for making a settlement in the above region. With this object, he landed men and supplies on Sable Island; [8] but, as the conditions which had been accorded to him by his Majesty were not fulfilled, he was obliged to abandon his undertaking, and leave his men there. A year after, Captain Chauvin accepted another commission to transport Settlers to the same region; [9] but, as this was shortly after revoked, he prosecuted the matter no farther.  After the above, [10] notwithstanding all these accidents and disappointments, Sieur de Monts desired to attempt what had been given up in despair, and requested a commission for this purpose of his Majesty, being satisfied that the previous enterprises had failed because the undertakers of them had not received assistance, who had not succeeded, in one nor even two years' time, in making the acquaintance of the regions and people there, nor in finding harbors adapted for a settlement. He proposed to his Majesty a means for covering these expenses, without drawing any thing from the royal revenues; viz., by granting to him the monopoly of the fur-trade in this land. This having been granted to him, he made great and excessive outlays, and carried out with him a large number of men of various vocations. Upon his arrival, he caused the necessary number of habitations for his followers to be constructed. This expenditure he continued for three consecutive years, after which, in consequence of the jealousy and annoyance of certain Basque merchants, together with some from Brittany, the monopoly which had been granted to him was revoked by the Council to the great injury and loss of Sieur de Monts, who, in consequence of this revocation, was compelled to abandon his entire undertaking, sacrificing his labors and the outfit for his settlement.  But since a report had been made to the king on the fertility of the soil by him, and by me on the feasibility of discovering the passage to China, [11] without the inconveniences of the ice of the north or the heats of the torrid zone, through which our sailors pass twice in going and twice in returning, with inconceivable hardships and risks, his Majesty directed Sieur de Monts to make a new outfit, and send men to continue what he had commenced. This he did. And, in view of the uncertainty of his commission, [12] he chose a new spot for his settlement, in order to deprive jealous persons of any such distrust as they had previously conceived. He was also influenced by the hope of greater advantages in case of settling in the interior, where the people are civilized, and where it is easier to plant the Christian faith and establish such order as is necessary for the protection of a country, than along the sea-shore, where the savages generally dwell. From this course, he believed the king would derive an inestimable profit; for it is easy to suppose that Europeans will seek out this advantage rather than those of a jealous and intractable disposition to be found on the shores, and the barbarous tribes.

The first commission was granted by Henry VII. of England to John Cabot    and his three sons, Lewis, Sebastian, and Sancius, March 5, 1496.--    _Rymer's Foedera_, Vol. XII. p. 595. The first voyage, however, was made    in 1497. The second commission was granted to John Cabot alone, in    1498.--_Vide Hakluyt_, 1600, London, ed. 1810, Vol. III. pp. 25-31.  2. Cortereal made two voyages under the patronage of Emmanuel, King of    Portugal, the first in 1500, the second in 1501. In the latter year, he    sailed with two ships from Lisbon, and explored six hundred miles or    more on our northern coast. The vessel in which he sailed was lost; and    he perished, together with fifty natives whom he had captured. The other    vessel returned, and reported the incidents of the expedition. The next    year, Michael Cortereal, the brother of Gaspar, obtained a commission,    and went in search of his brother; but he did not return, and no tidings    were ever heard of him.  3. Jacques Cartier made three voyages in 1534, 1535, and 1540,    respectively, in which he effected very important discoveries; and    Charlevoix justly remarks that Cartier's Memoirs long served as a guide    to those who after him navigated the gulf and river of St. Lawrence. For    Cartier's commission, see _Hazard's State Papers_, Vol. I. p. 19.  4. Roberval's voyage was made in 1542, and is reported by Jean Alfonse.--    _Vide Hakluyt_, 1600, London, ed. 1810, Vol. III. p. 291. On an old map,    drawn about the middle of the sixteenth century, Roberval is represented    in a full-length portrait, clad in mail, with sword and spear, at the    head of a band of armed soldiers, penetrating into the wilds of Canada,    near the head-waters of the Saguenay. The name, \"Monsr. de Roberual,\" is    inserted near his feet,--_Vide Monuments de la Géographie_, XIX., par    M. Jomard, Paris.  5. For the narrative of the voyages of Frobisher, Gilbert, and Davis, _vide    Hakluyt_, Vol. III. Of the fleet of five vessels commanded by Sir    Humphrey Gilbert, in 1583, the Ralegh put back to England, on account of    sickness on board; the Golden Hinde returned safely to port; the    _Swallow_ was left at Newfoundland, to bring home the sick; the    _Delight_ was lost near Sable Island; and the _Squirrel_ went down on    its way to England, some days after leaving Sable Island. Thus two only    were lost, while a third was left.     There must have been some error in regard to the voyage of Captain    Georges. There is no printed account of a voyage at that time by any one    of this name. There are two theories on which this statement may be    explained. There may have been a voyage by a Captain Georges, which, for    some unknown reason, was never reported; or, what is more likely,    Champlain may refer to the voyage of Captain George Weymouth, undertaken    in 1602 for the East Ind. Company, which was defeated by the icebergs    which he encountered, and the mutiny of his men. It was not uncommon to    omit part of a name at that period. Of Pont Gravé, the last name is    frequently omitted by Champlain and by Lescarbot. The report of    Weymouth's voyage was not printed till after Champlain wrote; and he    might easily have mistaken the date.  6. The name of New France, _Novus Francisca_, appears on a map in Ptolemy    published at Basle in 1530.  7. The controlling object of the numerous voyages to the north-east coast    of America had hitherto been to discover a shorter course to India. In    this respect, as Champlain states above, they had all proved    failures. He here intimates that the settlements of the French on this    coast were intended to facilitate this design. It is obvious that a    colonial establishment would offer great advantages as a base in    prosecuting searches for this desired passage to Cathay.  8. For some account of this disastrous expedition, see _Memoir_, Vol. I.  9. _Vide Memoir_, Vol. I.  10. It will be observed that Champlain does not mention the expedition sent     out by Commander de Chastes, probably because its object was     exploration, and not actual settlement.--_Vide_ an account of De     Chastes in the _Memoir_, Vol. I.  11. In Champlain's report of the voyage of 1603, after obtaining what     information he could from the natives relating to the St. Lawrence and     the chain of lakes, he says they informed him that the last lake in the     chain was salt, and he therefore believed it to be the South Sea. He     doubtless enlarged verbally before the king upon the feasibility of a     passage to China in this way.  12. The commission here referred to was doubtless the one renewed to him in     1608, after he had made his searches on the shores of New England and     Nova Scotia, and after the commission or charter of 1603 had been     revoked.      Champlain is here stating the advantages of a"]]]
