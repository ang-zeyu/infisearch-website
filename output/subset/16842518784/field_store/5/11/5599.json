For I shall be sound asleep right after sunset.\"     IV  GETTING READY   Buster Bumblemee's mind was made up. Although Chirpy Cricket told him it would be a shame for him to miss the torchlight procession, which was sure to be a great success, because Freddie Firefly had promised to be there with one hundred and twenty-seven of his relations, Buster still shook his head.  \"I wouldn't think of such a thing as staying out after dark!\" he declared with much firmness.  \"But you ought to see the Firefly family when they're all lighted up!\" Chirpy Cricket cried.  \"Are they as bright as the sun?\" Buster asked.  \"N-no--but they're brighter than some of the stars,\" Chirpy replied.  \"Well, I don't care if they are,\" said Buster. \"I need my rest at night. And you'll have to get along without me, though of course, I'm much obliged for the invitation.\"  Seeing that further urging was useless, Chirpy Cricket left Buster and hurried away to find Jennie Junebug. And to his delight, she said at once that she would be much pleased to attend the torchlight procession. She did wish, however, that he had invited her earlier, because she would have liked a new gown for the occasion.  \"Oh, come just as you are!\" said Chirpy Cricket.  \"What! With my apron on?\" Jennie Junebug exclaimed.  Chirpy Cricket went off laughing. Buster Bumblebee had caused him some disappointment. But now he was feeling quite cheerful again.  As he went from place to place inviting his friends to come to the torchlight procession that night, he found that a good many felt as Buster Bumblebee did. They declined to break their life-long rule of going early to bed. But there were others, such as Mr. Moses Mosquito, Kiddie Katydid, and Mehitable Moth, who said at once that they were glad he asked them and that they wouldn't miss the fun for anything.  Meanwhile Freddie Firefly was just as busy as Chirpy Cricket. And he had somewhat better luck. For not only did fifty-five of his brothers and six dozen of his cousins promise to take part in the procession--and bring their lights, too--but at least three hundred others, including some of Freddie's second and third cousins, agreed gladly to join in the evening's sport.  So before dark Freddie sent a message to Chirpy Cricket by Greenie Grasshopper, telling him that he might count on a big turnout of the Firefly family.  That was good news. And Chirpy Cricket felt so happy that he began to sing earlier in the evening than was his custom.  While it was still dusk he went to the stone wall where the procession was to form. And of course he had to wait there a long time before the first of the Firefly family appeared.  Even for a person as cheerful as Chirpy Cricket, it was hard to wait. But he consoled himself by chirping his loudest.  \"I suppose Freddie Firefly and all his relations are very busy getting their lights ready,\" he thought.  At last, when it was quite dark, Freddie Firefly lighted on a head of timothy grass close beside the stone wall and began to flash his light right in Chirpy Cricket's face.  \"Here I am, just as I promised!\" he called.     V  AT THE STONE WALL   \"Where's the rest of your crowd?\" Chirpy Cricket asked Freddie Firefly, when they met by the stone wall. \"It's getting darker every minute. And the torchlight procession ought to start right away.\"  \"They're coming,\" said Freddie. \"If you look sharp you can see them now, crossing the meadow.\"  Chirpy Cricket tried to see through the blackness of the night. After gazing steadily for a few moments he was able to make out a patch of twinkling lights, which looked a good deal like stars, except that they were too low. Since they kept growing brighter, Chirpy Cricket knew that they must be moving towards him, and that many of the Firefly family had accepted his invitation.  Soon a great host of Freddie's relations surrounded Chirpy Cricket. They flashed their lights in his eyes, so that he was almost blinded by the glare. And it was only with much difficulty that he could see Moses Mosquito, Kiddie Katydid, and Mehitable Moth, who had also arrived by that time.  \"What are we going to do?\" everybody asked Chirpy Cricket at the same time. So there was nothing he could do but mount the wall and make a speech.  \"Friends--\" he said, in his loudest voice--\"I'm glad to see so many of you present. Our torchlight procession is going to be an even greater success than the one that Farmer Green went to see in the village--if you'll only follow my directions.\"  \"We will!\" his listeners cried.  \"Please don't ask us to march after dawn breaks, for we'll be ready for bed by that time,\" Freddie Firefly interrupted.  \"I understand,\" Chirpy Cricket replied. \"And now this is what I want you all to do: you must fall in line one behind another. And when everybody's ready I'll take my place at the head of the procession and lead you all around the farm, and right past Farmer Green's window, too.\"  \"Forming a line is going to be hard work,\" somebody objected.  But Chirpy Cricket arranged that matter simply enough.  \"Just form your line along the stone wall\" he directed them. \"The wall is straight enough. And to tell the truth, that's exactly why I told Freddie that we'd meet here.\"  \"But what about Moses Mosquito and Kiddie Katydid and Mehitable Moth?\" Freddie inquired somewhat anxiously.  \"Well, what about them?\" Chirpy asked him. \"What do you mean?\"  \"They haven't brought any lights,\" Freddie pointed out. \"So what's the use of their being in the procession?\"  \"Oh, that's all right!\" Chirpy Cricket assured him. \"They're going to carry the banners.\"     VI  THE BANNERS   When Chirpy Cricket mentioned \"banners,\" Mehitable Moth, Kiddie Katydid, and Moses Mosquito stepped forward with looks of pride on their faces--so far as one could see their faces by the glimmer of the flashing lights of the Firefly family. And at the same time Freddie Firefly shouldered his way through the crowd and plucked at Chirpy Cricket's sleeve.  \"Don't you think--\" he asked earnestly--\"don't you think I ought to carry one of the banners myself?\"  \"Perhaps so!\" answered Chirpy Cricket. He was so taken aback that he really didn't know what else to say. \"Which one do you prefer?\"  \"I'd have to see them before I made a choice,\" Freddie Firefly told him in a more hopeful tone.  So Chirpy ordered Kiddie Katydid and Moses and Mehitable to produce their banners, which they had left leaning against the wall.  They brought them forth fearfully, each hoping that his--or hers--wasn't going to be taken away and handed over to Freddie Firefly to carry in the procession.  \"Here are the banners!\" Chirpy Cricket said to Freddie. \"Which one do you like best?\"  Freddie looked at the banners and read them slowly, for he was not a good reader.  The first that he examined was the one Moses Mosquito had brought. And this is what it said:  WHY FUSS ABOUT A BITE, IF IT MAKES SOMEBODY ELSE HAPPY?  \"I don't care for that one at all,\" Freddie Firefly announced. And he turned then to Kiddie Katydid's banner, which he spelled out with a good deal of trouble, because it was not so well printed.  This banner made the following announcement:  HONEST TO GOODNESS, I DIDN'T DO IT!  \"Why, I don't know what that's all about!\" Freddie exclaimed impatiently. \"Let me see the third one!\" So he looked next at the banner of Mehitable Moth, which seemed to please him better, as he read it aloud:  DON'T WORRY, MRS. GREEN! I'LL CALL AT THE FARMHOUSE BEFORE FALL.  \"That's better!\" cried Freddie Firefly. \"I'll carry this banner with a great deal of pleasure. And I can call at the farmhouse to-night--if Farmer Green's family doesn't go to bed too early.\"  But there was one difficulty about Freddie's plan. Mehitable Moth did not like to have her banner, which she had made with great pains, taken away from her like that. And she drew Chirpy Cricket to one side and began talking to him in an undertone.  Soon he turned again to Freddie Firefly, saying, \"She thinks that if you're going to carry her banner in the procession you ought to let her take your light.\"  \"Oh, I can't do that!\" Freddie exclaimed quickly. \"I wouldn't THINK of doing that!\"  \"It would be only fair, it seems to me,\" Chirpy Cricket observed.  \"Well, I won't do it, anyhow,\" Freddie declared. \"I'd stay out of the procession first. And so would all my relations, too.\"  Chirpy Cricket began to look worried. And it was no wonder. For he knew he could have no torchlight procession without the Firefly family. But pretty soon he cheered up noticeably.  \"I know what you can do!\" he announced. \"You can ride on top of Mehitable Moth's banner and keep flashing your light on it!\"     VII  THE TORCHLIGHT PARADE   At last the torchlight procession was about to begin its march. Chirpy Cricket took his place at its head, as leader. And close behind him came Mehitable Moth, gaily bearing her banner aloft, with Freddie Firefly perched on top of it, and flashing his greenish-white light so that its rays fell full upon the words, which told Farmer Green's wife not to worry, because Mehitable Moth agreed to pay her a call before cold weather set in.  It would be hard to say which was the prouder--the person under the banner or the one on top of it. Anyhow, Chirpy Cricket was prouder than both of them together, because his torchlight procession promised to be a great success.  \"Are you ready?\" he cried, looking back at the marchers, who stretched behind him in a long line beside the stone wall.  Everybody shouted \"Aye, aye, sir!\" So Chirpy Cricket pranced away across the meadow, wearing a broad smile. Probably he had never before looked quite so cheerful.  But he had not gone far before something happened that drove the smile"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5727"],["title","The Tale of Freddie Firefly (#2)"],["body","his face, replacing it with a dark frown. He had glanced behind him, because he wanted--quite naturally--to look at that long line of lights twinkling through the night. And to his distress he saw that Freddie Firefly's relations were flying helter-skelter in all directions. They had bolted out of the line and were dancing off across the meadow after a fashion that no torchlight procession ought to follow.  \"Stop! Stop!\" Chirpy Cricket called.  Even as he spoke, as many as a dozen lights flashed past him and went flittering on across the fields.  Really, the only ones besides Chirpy that had stayed in the line as they should were Mehitable Moth, who still carried her banner right behind him, and Freddie Firefly, who sat on top of the banner.  And even Freddie Firefly was becoming restless. When he saw his brothers and cousins go dancing off in the dark he couldn't help wanting to dance too.  \"You'd better hurry!\" he said to Chirpy Cricket. \"Those fellows--\" he pointed to the dozen that had just passed them--\"those fellows have got ahead of you. And it looks to me very much as if you were out of line.\"  Chirpy Cricket stared at Freddie Firefly in astonishment.  \"Do you think so?\" he exclaimed. \"I don't see how it happened.\"  \"Neither do I!\" Freddie Firefly said. \"But if I'm to stay in the procession I certainly can't sit on this banner any longer. And besides, if I'm going to call on Farmer Green's wife I shall have to travel faster than we're moving now.\"  Since they were then standing stock-still in the meadow, there was a good deal of truth in what Freddie Firefly said.  \"But you don't need to call on Mrs. Green!\" Chirpy Cricket cried. \"That's not your banner, you know. It belongs to Mehitable Moth.\"  \"I'm afraid Mrs. Green has heard I'm coming; and I don't want to disappoint her,\" Freddie replied.  And then he sprang from his perch and went zigzagging away.  One might think that Chirpy Cricket would have been quite upset by the breaking up of his torchlight procession. But being naturally cheerful, he merely smiled and said that it was plain that the Fireflies were a very flighty family.     VIII  BUSTER'S SCHEME   About the time summer was half gone, Buster Bumblebee's mother, the Queen, began to worry. She was afraid her workers were not going to make enough honey for her family's needs.  Then came a few days of steady rain, when the workers of the Bumblebee family couldn't venture away from home, on account of getting their wings wet. And of course the Queen was terribly upset.  \"I don't know what to do!\" she kept exclaiming. \"The days are already growing shorter. It's a pity the honeymakers can't work in the dark.\"  Buster Bumblebee happened to hear his mother talking in that fashion with some of the older members of the family. And he spoke up at once and said:  \"I know of a plan that might help.\"  Nobody paid the slightest attention to his remark, because the whole family thought that Buster was not only fat and lazy, but somewhat stupid as well.  \"I know of something you could do that would help,\" he persisted, in a much louder voice. \"The honey-makers could work after dark if you'd only get the Firefly family to furnish lights for them.\"  A number of Buster's relations snickered when they heard his plan. It struck them as being too silly for anything. But his mother, the Queen, looked very thoughtful.  \"I'm not sure but that this boy has a good idea,\" she observed, much to the surprise of the others. \"For a long time I've been waiting for him to say something worth listening to. And now I do believe he has had a happy thought at last.\" She turned to Buster. \"How did you chance upon this scheme?\" she asked him.  \"Oh, the notion just came to me. I didn't have to WORK, to think of it,\" Buster explained. And he wondered why everybody laughed.  You know, Buster Bumblebee was so lazy that he never would lift a finger to do a stroke of work. And now the word \"work\" had a very funny sound, coming from his mouth.  \"How could we get the Firefly family to help us? Have you thought of a way to do that?\" Buster's mother said to her son.  \"N-no, I haven't,\" he admitted. \"But I'd go straight to Freddie Firefly and tell him what's wanted.\"  \"Suppose you do that, then,\" said the Queen.  \"You wouldn't call that WORKING, would you?\" Buster inquired anxiously. Having long since promised himself that he would never work, of course he didn't want to break his word.  His relations--that is, except his mother--couldn't help tittering when Buster said that. But to tell the truth, they were beginning to be the least bit jealous of Buster Bumblebee and his plan. When the Queen frowned at them severely, each of them tried to look as if it had been somebody else that laughed.  Then the Queen assured Buster that paying a call on a person couldn't be said to be work.  \"You go and talk with Freddie Firefly,\" she directed him, \"and if your plan proves to be a success, it will then be your turn to laugh at others.\"     IX  FREDDIE'S PROMISE   Buster Bumblebee did not find Freddie Firefly very easily. It was a sunny afternoon; and if Freddie was flashing his bright light, Buster was unable to see it. But at last he spied Freddie eating a meal of pollen in the meadow.  \"How would you like to work for my mother, the Queen?\" Buster asked him.  \"I don't believe I'd care to, thank you,\" Freddie Firefly answered, with a mouth so full of food that Buster heard him only with great difficulty.  \"I'll wait a moment, until you have finished your lunch,\" said Buster.  \"You'd better not!\" Freddie Firefly told him. \"It will be dark by that time. And Chirpy Cricket tells me your family always goes to bed at sunset.\"  \"So we do!\" Buster agreed. \"But my mother, the Queen, is going to order her honey-makers to work overtime for the present. And she wants you and your family to furnish lights so they can see what they're doing.\" \"Oh! That's different!\" Freddie Firefly exclaimed. \"I thought she wanted me to help make honey. And that's something I know nothing about. ... But when it comes to furnishing a light, I'm certainly a shining success.\" Freddie then laughed heartily. And much to his surprise, Buster Bumblebee gave him several hard slaps on the back, which hurt him not a little.  \"Don't do that!\" Freddie Firefly cried.  \"I thought you were choking,\" Buster, explained.  Freddie Firefly shook his head.  \"I was joking,\" he said.  \"Well, I didn't make much of a mistake; for joking and choking sound about the same,\" Buster Bumblebee replied.  \"I hope your mother's honey-makers can tell the difference,\" Freddie Firefly grumbled. \"If they can't, I certainly don't care to spend a night in their company.\"  \"Oh, you won't have any trouble with them. They'll be working so busily that they'll hardly notice you,\" Buster Bumblebee assured him.  So Freddie Firefly promised to be at the house of the Bumblebee family, in the meadow, at dusk. And he said he would try to bring plenty of his relations with him, so that there might be one of them to light the way for each of the honey-makers.  And then Buster Bumblebee hurried away to tell his mother the news.  The Queen praised Buster for what he had done, telling him that in her opinion he would soon be the wisest person in Pleasant Valley--not even excepting old Mr. Crow and Solomon Owl.  Buster was so pleased that he made up his mind to stay awake that evening, in order to see the workers start out for the clover field after dark with Freddie Firefly and his relations. But when sunset came, Buster simply couldn't keep from falling asleep.  Not until the next morning did he know how his plan had turned out. And since it proved to be less successful than he had expected, perhaps it was just as well that he was not present to hear the remarks that were made about him.  Even Freddie Firefly said things about Buster that night that would not have been at all pleasant to listen to.     X  DRAWING LOTS   Buster Bumblebee's mother told her forty-nine honey-makers that Freddie Firefly and at least forty-eight of his relations were expected at the Bumblebees' house at dusk.  \"Each of the Fireflies will furnish each of you with a light,\" the Queen explained, \"so you'll be able to go to the clover field almost as easily as you do in the daytime. You're to work until midnight. And after that you may sleep until the trumpeter wakes you at dawn.\"  The Queen's announcement did not please the honey-makers in the least. They were an ill-tempered lot, anyhow. And when things did not go to suit them they sometimes made themselves most disagreeable.  Of course they didn't dare grumble in the Queen's hearing. But behind her back they spoke their minds quite freely.  \"It's all the fault of that boy Buster,\" they told one another. \"If he hadn't suggested his horrid plan to his mother we wouldn't have to work half the night and lose half our sleep.\"  \"I wish he was here now!\" one of the honey-makers exclaimed fiercely. \"I'd make it hot for him!\"  Usually the honey-makers began to grow very drowsy at that time of day (it was then late in the afternoon). But now they were so angry that they were not the least bit sleepy. Their own buzzing kept them awake. And the Queen was glad that it was so, because she herself never could have stopped so many of them from going to sleep. And even then, if the truth must be known, the Queen wished that she might go to bed. Never in all her life had she been up so late before.  \"I wish the Fireflies would hurry!\" she exclaimed as she stood at the front-door of her house and looked across the fast darkening field.  As she watched anxiously, the Queen soon spied a light, which kept growing brighter and brighter, until at last Freddie Firefly dropped down before her. He took off his cap and made a low bow.  \"Here I am, Queen!\" he said.  \"Where's the rest of your family?\" Buster Bumblebee's mother asked him.  \"They all had to go to a dance down by the swamp,\" Freddie Firefly explained. \"They wanted me to "]]]
