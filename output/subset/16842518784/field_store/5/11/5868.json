He was told to come here and meet them; and these were sent for from the caravanserais. Is it not so?\"  \"Art thou thyself for the Raj?\" asked Yasmini.  \"I lead a squadron of Sikh cavalry,\" said Ranjoor Singh, \"and you ask me am I for the Raj?\"  \"The buffalo that carries water for the office lawn is for the Raj!\" said Yasmini.  \"Then he and I are brothers.\"  \"And he, yonder--what of him?\" She was growing impatient, for the tune was nearly at an end, and it would be time presently for her to take up the burden of entertainment.  \"He will ask, perhaps, to speak with a Sikh of influence.\"  \"Sahib, 'to hear is to obey,'\" she mocked, rising to her feet.  \"Listen yet!\" commanded Ranjoor Singh. \"Serve me in this matter, and there will be great reward. I, who am only one, might die by a dagger, or a rope in the dark, or ground glass in my bread; but then there would be a squadron, and perhaps a regiment, to ask questions.\"  \"Perhaps?\"  \"Perhaps. Who knows?\"  He spoke from modesty, sure of the squadron that he loved so much better than his life, but not caring to magnify his own importance by claiming the regard of the other squadrons, too. But Yasmini, who never in her life went straight from point to point of an idea and never could believe that anybody else did, supposed he meant that one squadron was in his confidence, whereas the rest had not yet been sounded.  \"So speaks one who is for the Raj!\" she grinned.  Playing for profit and amusement, she never, never let anybody know which side she had taken in any game. Therefore she despised a man who showed his hand to her, as she believed Ranjoor Singh had done. But she only showed contempt when it suited her, and by no means always when she felt it.  The minor music ceased and all eyes in the room were turned to her. She rose to her feet as a hooded cobra comes toward its prey, sparing a sidewise surreptitious smile of confidence for Ranjoor Singh that no eye caught save his; yet as she turned from him and swayed in the first few steps of a dance devised that minute, his quick ear caught the truth of her opinion:  \"Buffalo!\" she murmured.  The flutes in the window wailed about mystery. The lights, and the sandal-smoke, and the expectant silence emphasized it. Step by step, as if the spirit of all dancing had its home in her, she told a wordless tale, using her feet and every sinuous muscle as no other woman in all India ever did.  Men say that Yasmini is partly Russian, and that may be true, for she speaks Russian fluently. Russian or not, the members of the Russian ballet are the only others in the world who share her art. Certainly, she keeps in touch with Russia, and knows more even than the Indian government about what goes on beyond India's northern frontier. She makes and magnifies the whole into a mystery; and her dance that night expressed the fascination mystery has for her.  And then she sang. It is her added gift of song that makes Yasmini unique, for she can sing in any of a dozen languages, and besides the love-songs that come southward from the hills, she knows all the interminable ballads of the South and the Central Provinces. But when, as that evening, she is at her best, mixing magic under the eyes of the inquisitive, she sings songs of her own making and only very rarely the same song twice. She sang that night of the winds of the world which, she claims, carry the news to her; although others say her sources of information speak more distinctly.  It seemed that the thread of an idea ran through song and dance alike, and that the hillmen and beyond-the-hills-men, who sat back-to-the-wall and watched, could follow the meaning of it. They began to crowd closer, to squat cross-legged on the floor, in circles one outside the other, until the European three became the center of three rings of men who stared at them with owls' solemnity.  Then Yasmini ceased dancing. Then one of the Europeans drew his watch out; and he had to show it to the other two before he could convince them that they had sat for two hours without wanting to do anything but watch and listen.  \"So _wass!_\" said one of them--the drunken.  _\"Du lieber Gott--schon halb zwolf!\"_ said the second.  The third man made no remark at all. He was watching Ranjoor Singh.  The risaldar--major had left the divan by the end wall and walked--all grim straight lines in contrast to Yasmini's curves--to a spot directly facing the three Europeans; and it seemed there sat a hillman on the piece of floor he coveted.  \"Get up!\" he commanded. \"Make room!\"  The hillman did not budge, for an Afridi pretends to feel for a Sikh the scorn that a Sikh feels truly for Afridis. The flat of Ranjoor Singh's foot came to his assistance, and the hillman budged. In an instant he was on his feet, with a lightning right hand reaching for his knife.  But Yasmini allows no butcher's work on her premises, and her words within those walls are law, since no man knows who is on whose side. Yasmini beckoned him, and the Afridi slouched toward her sullenly. She whispered something, and he started for the stairs at once, without any further protest.  Then there vanished all doubt as to which of the three Europeans was most important. The man who had come in first had accepted sherbet from the maid who sat beside him; he went suddenly from drowsiness to slumber, and the woman spurned his bullet-head away from her shoulder, letting him fall like a log among the cushions. The stout second man looked frightened and sat nursing helpless hands. But the third man sat forward, and tense silence fell on the assembly as the eyes of every man sought his.  Only Yasmini, hovering in the background, had time to watch anything other than those gray European eyes; she saw that they were interested most in Ranjoor Singh, and the maids who noticed her expression of sweet innocence knew that she was thinking fast.  \"You are a Sikh?\" said the gray-eyed man; and the crowd drew in its breath, for he spoke Hindustani with an accent that very few achieve, even with long practise.  \"Then you are of a brave nation--you will understand me. The Sikhs are a martial race. Their theory of politics is based on the military spirit--is it not so?\"  Ranjoor Singh, who understood and tried to live the Sikh religion with all his gentlemanly might, was there to acquire information, not to impart it. He grunted gravely.  \"All martial nations expand eventually. They tell me--I have heard--some of you Sikhs have tried Canada?\"  Ranjoor Singh did not wince, though his back stiffened when the men around him grinned; it is a sore point with the Sikhs that Canada does not accept their emigrants.  \"Sikhs are admitted into all the German colonies,\" said the man with the gray eyes. \"They are welcome.\"  \"Do many go?\" asked Ranjoor Singh.  \"That is the point. The Sikhs want a place in the sun from which they are barred at present--eh? Now, Germany--\"  \"Germany? Where is Germany?\" asked Yasmini. She understands the last trick in the art of getting a story on its way. \"To the west is England. Farther west, Ameliki. To the north lies Russia. To the south the _kali pani_-ocean. Where is Germany?\"  The man with the gray eyes took her literally, since his nation are not slow at seizing opportunity. He launched without a word more of preliminary into a lecture on Germany that lasted hours and held his audience spellbound. It was colorful, complete, and it did not seem to have been memorized. But that was art.  He had no word of blame for England. He even had praise, when praise made German virtue seem by that much greater; and the inference from first to last was of German super-virtue.  Some one in the crowd--who bore a bullet-mark in proof he did not jest--suggested to him that the British army was the biggest and fiercest in the world. So he told them of a German army, millions strong, that marched in league--long columns--an army that guarded by the prosperous hundred thousand factory chimneys that smoked until the central European sky was black.  Long, long after midnight, in a final burst of imagination, he likened Germany to a bee--hive from which a swarm must soon emerge for lack of room inside. And he proved, then, that he knew he had made an impression on them, for he dismissed them with an impudence that would have set them laughing at him when he first began to speak.  \"Ye have my leave to go!\" he said, as if he owned the place; and they all went except one.  \"That is a lot of talk,\" said Ranjoor Singh, when the last man had started for the stairs. \"What does it amount to? When will the bees swarm?\"  The German eyed him keenly, but the Sikh's eyes did not flinch.  \"What is your rank?\" the German asked.  \"Squadron leader!\"  \"Oh!\"  The two stood up, and now there was no mistake about the German's heels; they clicked. The two were almost of a height, although the Sikh's head--dress made him seem the taller. They were both unusually fine--looking men, and limb for limb they matched.  \"If war were in Europe you would be taken there to fight,\" said the German.  Ranjoor Singh showed no surprise.  \"Whether you wanted to fight or not.\"  There was no hint of laughter in the Sikh's brown eyes.  \"Germany has no quarrel with the Sikhs.\"  \"I have heard of none,\" said Ranjoor Singh.  \"Wherever the German flag should fly, after a war, the Sikhs would have free footing.\"  Ranjoor Singh looked interested, even pleased.  \"Who is not against Germany is for her.\"  \"Let us have plain words' said Ranjoor Singh, leading the way to a corner in which he judged they could not be overheard; there he turned suddenly, borrowing a trick from Yasmini.  \"I am a Sikh--a patriot. What are you offering?\"  \"The freedom of the earth!\" the German answered. \"Self--government! The right to emigrate. Liberty!\"  \"On what condition? For a "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6753"],["title","Psmith in the City (#1)"],["body",". It was obvious that they could not hope to win. Number nine on the list, who was Bagley, the ground-man, went in with instructions to play for a draw, and minute advice from Mr Smith as to how he was to do it. Mike had now begun to score rapidly, and it was not to be expected that he could change his game; but Bagley, a dried-up little man of the type which bowls for five hours on a hot August day without exhibiting any symptoms of fatigue, put a much-bound bat stolidly in front of every ball he received; and the Hall's prospects of saving the game grew brighter.  At a quarter to six the professional left, caught at very silly point for eight. The score was a hundred and fifteen, of which Mike had made eighty-five.  A lengthy young man with yellow hair, who had done some good fast bowling for the Hall during the week, was the next man in. In previous matches he had hit furiously at everything, and against the Green Jackets had knocked up forty in twenty minutes while Mike was putting the finishing touches to his century. Now, however, with his host's warning ringing in his ears, he adopted the unspectacular, or Bagley, style of play. His manner of dealing with the ball was that of one playing croquet. He patted it gingerly back to the bowler when it was straight, and left it icily alone when it was off the wicket. Mike, still in the brilliant vein, clumped a half-volley past point to the boundary, and with highly scientific late cuts and glides brought his score to ninety-eight. With Mike's score at this, the total at a hundred and thirty, and the hands of the clock at five minutes to six, the yellow-haired croquet exponent fell, as Bagley had fallen, a victim to silly point, the ball being the last of the over.  Mr Smith, who always went in last for his side, and who so far had not received a single ball during the week, was down the pavilion steps and half-way to the wicket before the retiring batsman had taken half a dozen steps.  'Last over,' said the wicket-keeper to Mike. 'Any idea how many you've got? You must be near your century, I should think.'  'Ninety-eight,' said Mike. He always counted his runs.  'By Jove, as near as that? This is something like a finish.'  Mike left the first ball alone, and the second. They were too wide of the off-stump to be hit at safely. Then he felt a thrill as the third ball left the bowler's hand. It was a long-hop. He faced square to pull it.  And at that moment Mr John Bickersdyke walked into his life across the bowling-screen.  He crossed the bowler's arm just before the ball pitched. Mike lost sight of it for a fraction of a second, and hit wildly. The next moment his leg stump was askew; and the Hall had lost the match.  'I'm sorry,' he said to Mr Smith. 'Some silly idiot walked across the screen just as the ball was bowled.'  'What!' shouted Mr Smith. 'Who was the fool who walked behind the bowler's arm?' he yelled appealingly to Space.  'Here he comes, whoever he is,' said Mike.  A short, stout man in a straw hat and a flannel suit was walking towards them. As he came nearer Mike saw that he had a hard, thin-lipped mouth, half-hidden by a rather ragged moustache, and that behind a pair of gold spectacles were two pale and slightly protruding eyes, which, like his mouth, looked hard.  'How are you, Smith,' he said.  'Hullo, Bickersdyke.' There was a slight internal struggle, and then Mr Smith ceased to be the cricketer and became the host. He chatted amiably to the new-comer.  'You lost the game, I suppose,' said Mr Bickersdyke.  The cricketer in Mr Smith came to the top again, blended now, however, with the host. He was annoyed, but restrained in his annoyance.  'I say, Bickersdyke, you know, my dear fellow,' he said complainingly, 'you shouldn't have walked across the screen. You put Jackson off, and made him get bowled.'  'The screen?'  'That curious white object,' said Mike. 'It is not put up merely as an ornament. There's a sort of rough idea of giving the batsman a chance of seeing the ball, as well. It's a great help to him when people come charging across it just as the bowler bowls.'  Mr Bickersdyke turned a slightly deeper shade of purple, and was about to reply, when what sporting reporters call 'the veritable ovation' began.  Quite a large crowd had been watching the game, and they expressed their approval of Mike's performance.  There is only one thing for a batsman to do on these occasions. Mike ran into the pavilion, leaving Mr Bickersdyke standing.     2. Mike Hears Bad News   It seemed to Mike, when he got home, that there was a touch of gloom in the air. His sisters were as glad to see him as ever. There was a good deal of rejoicing going on among the female Jacksons because Joe had scored his first double century in first-class cricket. Double centuries are too common, nowadays, for the papers to take much notice of them; but, still, it is not everybody who can make them, and the occasion was one to be marked. Mike had read the news in the evening paper in the train, and had sent his brother a wire from the station, congratulating him. He had wondered whether he himself would ever achieve the feat in first-class cricket. He did not see why he should not. He looked forward through a long vista of years of county cricket. He had a birth qualification for the county in which Mr Smith had settled, and he had played for it once already at the beginning of the holidays. His _debut_ had not been sensational, but it had been promising. The fact that two members of the team had made centuries, and a third seventy odd, had rather eclipsed his own twenty-nine not out; but it had been a faultless innings, and nearly all the papers had said that here was yet another Jackson, evidently well up to the family standard, who was bound to do big things in the future.  The touch of gloom was contributed by his brother Bob to a certain extent, and by his father more noticeably. Bob looked slightly thoughtful. Mr Jackson seemed thoroughly worried.  Mike approached Bob on the subject in the billiard-room after dinner. Bob was practising cannons in rather a listless way.  'What's up, Bob?' asked Mike.  Bob laid down his cue.  'I'm hanged if I know,' said Bob. 'Something seems to be. Father's worried about something.'  'He looked as if he'd got the hump rather at dinner.'  'I only got here this afternoon, about three hours before you did. I had a bit of a talk with him before dinner. I can't make out what's up. He seemed awfully keen on my finding something to do now I've come down from Oxford. Wanted to know whether I couldn't get a tutoring job or a mastership at some school next term. I said I'd have a shot. I don't see what all the hurry's about, though. I was hoping he'd give me a bit of travelling on the Continent somewhere before I started in.'  'Rough luck,' said Mike. 'I wonder why it is. Jolly good about Joe, wasn't it? Let's have fifty up, shall we?'  Bob's remarks had given Mike no hint of impending disaster. It seemed strange, of course, that his father, who had always been so easy-going, should have developed a hustling Get On or Get Out spirit, and be urging Bob to Do It Now; but it never occurred to him that there could be any serious reason for it. After all, fellows had to start working some time or other. Probably his father had merely pointed this out to Bob, and Bob had made too much of it.  Half-way through the game Mr Jackson entered the room, and stood watching in silence.  'Want a game, father?' asked Mike.  'No, thanks, Mike. What is it? A hundred up?'  'Fifty.'  'Oh, then you'll be finished in a moment. When you are, I wish you'd just look into the study for a moment, Mike. I want to have a talk with you.'  'Rum,' said Mike, as the door closed. 'I wonder what's up?'  For a wonder his conscience was free. It was not as if a bad school-report might have arrived in his absence. His Sedleigh report had come at the beginning of the holidays, and had been, on the whole, fairly decent--nothing startling either way. Mr Downing, perhaps through remorse at having harried Mike to such an extent during the Sammy episode, had exercised a studied moderation in his remarks. He had let Mike down far more easily than he really deserved. So it could not be a report that was worrying Mr Jackson. And there was nothing else on his conscience.  Bob made a break of sixteen, and ran out. Mike replaced his cue, and walked to the study.  His father was sitting at the table. Except for the very important fact that this time he felt that he could plead Not Guilty on every possible charge, Mike was struck by the resemblance in the general arrangement of the scene to that painful ten minutes at the end of the previous holidays, when his father had announced his intention of taking him away from Wrykyn and sending him to Sedleigh. The resemblance was increased by the fact that, as Mike entered, Mr Jackson was kicking at the waste-paper basket--a thing which with him was an infallible sign of mental unrest.  'Sit down, Mike,' said Mr Jackson. 'How did you get on during the week?'  'Topping. Only once out under double figures. And then I was run out. Got a century against the Green Jackets, seventy-one against the Incogs, and today I made ninety-eight on a beast of a wicket, and only got out because some silly goat of a chap--'  He broke off. Mr Jackson did not seem to be attending. There was a silence. Then Mr Jackson spoke with an obvious effort.  'Look here, Mike, we've always understood one another, haven't we?'  'Of course we have.'  'You know I wouldn't do anything to prevent you having a good time, if I could help it. I took you away from Wrykyn, I know, but that was a special case. It was necessary. But I understand perfectly how keen you are to go to Cambridge, and I wouldn't stand in the way for a minute, if I could help it.'  Mike looked at him blankly. This could only mean one thing. He was not to go to the 'Varsity. But why? What had happened? When he had"]]]
