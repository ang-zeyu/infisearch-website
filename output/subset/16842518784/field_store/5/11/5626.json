His chief friends and allies at this period were all men considerably older than himself--the two inseparables, the Duc de Beauvillier and the Duc de Chevreuse, who had both married daughters of Colbert, the Maréchal de Boufflers, the Chancellor Pontchartrain, and Chamillart, the Secretary of State for War. It was through the good offices of Chamillart and Maréchal, the King’s surgeon, that “he became reconciled,” as he characteristically expresses it, with Louis XIV. But he had his enemies as well as his friends, and chief among them were the members of the _coterie_ which, as so often happens towards the end of a long reign, the common hope of favours to come had attracted round the heir to the throne. An important member of this “Cabale de Meudon,” as Saint-Simon calls it, was the Duc de Vendôme, and when in 1708 Louis XIV made the mistake of associating his grandson, the Duc de Bourgogne, with him in the command of the army of Flanders, and dissensions arose between the two commanders, the Cabal warmly espoused Vendôme’s cause. Their unscrupulous intrigues against the Duc de Bourgogne roused the wrath of Saint-Simon, who as the ally of M. de Beauvillier, the young Prince’s former governor, was well disposed in his favour. Throughout the years 1708 and 1709 he threw himself into the contest with his accustomed vigour, and in the following year he helped to achieve a notable victory over the hated Cabal in another field, that of the marriage of the Duc de Berry, Monseigneur’s youngest son. The candidate of Monseigneur’s party was Mlle de Bourbon, while the Duchesse de Bourgogne, well served by Saint-Simon and his friends, favoured the daughter of the Duc d’Orléans. Saint-Simon’s organisation of the “Cabale de Mademoiselle” was a masterpiece of skilful intrigue, and he conducted the campaign with a passionate energy which is faithfully reflected in his narrative. When, however, the coarse and depraved character of the new Duchess revealed itself he bitterly regretted his success.  But the marriage had one beneficial, if unlooked for, result. The Duchesse de Saint-Simon, greatly against her inclination and that of her husband, was appointed lady-in-waiting to the new Duchess, and had assigned to her a set of apartments at Versailles, consisting of an antechamber and five rooms, each with a dark little cabinet opening out of it. In one of these Saint-Simon established himself with his books and his _bureau de travail_. It was an unrivalled post of observation, which his friends christened appropriately “his workshop.” Meanwhile his intimacy with Beauvillier and Chevreuse brought him into relations with the Duc de Bourgogne, and the only thorn in his felicity was the Cabale de Meudon, which he believed to be bent on his destruction. But from this he was delivered by the Dauphin’s death from small-pox in April, 1711. The next ten months were the happiest of his whole life at Court. His relations with the new Dauphin became more intimate, and in numerous private conversations he discussed with him projects of political reform. Then in 1712 the French Marcellus, the star of noble hopes and aspirations, followed his father to the grave. The blow hit Saint-Simon almost as hard as it did Fénelon. “The sense of my personal loss, the immeasurably greater loss of France, and above all the vanished figure of that incomparable Dauphin pierced my heart and paralysed my faculties.”  Two years later he refers in melancholy accents to his changed position. Chevreuse, Beauvillier, and Boufflers were dead, Pontchartrain had retired from office, Chamillart was in disgrace. The one link left to him with the Court was the Duc d’Orléans, who by the death of the Duc de Berry in May, 1714, was marked out as the future regent of the kingdom. In spite of his unpopularity Saint-Simon, who had for some years now been on friendly terms with him, drew to him more closely. He reprobated his licentious and scandalous life, but he defended him against the false accusations of his enemies, and effectively countermined the intrigues of the party that was plotting against him in favour of the Duc du Maine.  On Louis XIV’s death it was partly owing to Saint-Simon’s vehement and energetic insistence that Orléans roused himself from his habitual indolence and persuaded the _Parlement_ to set aside the testament of the late King, which, while it conferred on him the Regency, had put the real power in the hands of the Duc du Maine. Saint-Simon was made a member of the Council of Regency, and the introduction of departmental Councils, in place of the Secretaries of State, was more or less in accord with his own proposals.  The new form of administration, however, was not a success and after a trial of two years was abandoned. Nor did Saint-Simon himself shew any political capacity. He was wanting in tact and adaptability, and worse than this he frittered away on futile questions of precedence and etiquette the time and energy that might have been given to really important matters. Such influence as he had with the Regent came to an end with the rise to power of Dubois, who gladly furthered his request to be sent on a special mission to Spain (1721).  On the death of the Regent (1722) he left the Court and lived for some time with his family in a house which he rented in the Rue Saint-Dominique. But after the marriage of his two sons he resided for at least half the year at his _château_ of La Ferté-Vidame, about 30 miles north-west of Chartres. The _château_ itself, which, as we know from engravings, had the air of a feudal fortress, and in every room of which hung a portrait of Louis XIII, no longer exists. But the park, enclosed by a wall of nearly nine miles, and the forest beyond have preserved their original character.  Here Saint-Simon began and completed the definitive version of his _Memoirs_, and here in 1743, to his overwhelming grief, he lost his wife, his faithful companion of nearly fifty years. Other misfortunes followed; his two sons preceded him to the grave, and he was driven by his debts to make over the whole of his property to his creditors. He died at Paris in 1755 at the age of eighty. The lives of his father and himself cover between them nearly a century and a half.  Saint-Simon, as we see him in Rigaud’s portrait, was small and delicate--a typical old man’s child--with an extremely alert and eager face. It has been observed that he is seldom mentioned in contemporary memoirs, but these are not numerous for the latter part of the reign of Louis XIV, while three of the chief memoir-writers of the Regency, when Saint-Simon was most prominent, Barbier, Buvat, and Marais, did not belong to Court circles. When he is mentioned it is in no complimentary terms. D’Argenson attacks him for advocating severe measures against the Duc du Maine after the conspiracy of Cellamare. “Mark,” he says, “the odious and bloodthirsty character (_anthropophage_) of this little saint without genius.” But then Saint-Simon in his on the whole highly favourable portrait of D’Argenson’s father, the celebrated head of the Paris police, had said that his character was supple, and that his terrifying appearance resembled that of the three judges of Hades.  It was inevitable that Saint-Simon’s irascibility, intractability, and aristocratic pretensions should arouse considerable enmity, and in the songs and satires of the day he is attacked under the name of _boudrillon_ (_bout d’homme_) and _petit furibond_. Mme de Maintenon declared that he was “glorieux, frondeur et plein de vues,” and we have an interesting commentary on this remark in his report of a conversation which took place between the Duchesse de Bourgogne and his wife. The Duchess told her that he had many powerful enemies and that the King had conceived a strong prejudice against him. His intelligence, she said, and his knowledge and capacity for ideas were recognised as far above the ordinary, but everybody was afraid of him, and they could not endure his arrogance and his outspoken criticisms on persons and institutions.  These criticisms would have been more valuable if they had been less concerned with futilities, and less biased by aristocratic prejudices. But Saint-Simon was at heart a true patriot, and was keenly alive to the evils which were sapping the forces of his country. He agreed with reformers like Fénelon and Chevreuse and the Abbé de Saint-Pierre in regarding the absolutism of the King as the chief source of danger, and he shared their dislike of the Controller-General and the four Secretaries of State as the agents of this absolutism. He strongly reprobated the King’s love of war and glory, and the boundless extravagance, which he not only practised himself but encouraged in others. Like La Bruyère and Fénelon, Saint-Simon saw with a compassionate eye the wide-spread misery by which all this glory and magnificence was purchased. He has drawn a moving picture of the terrible winter of 1708-1709, when famine stalked through the land and crushing taxation on the top of high prices “completed the devastation of France.”  Mme de Maintenon further complained that he was “plein de vues,” by which she doubtless meant much the same thing as Louis XIV, when he called Fénelon chimerical. For in Saint-Simon’s schemes for reform, as in Fénelon’s, there was a strong Utopian element, which did not sufficiently take into account the hard facts of political life and the shortcomings of human nature. They both looked back too fondly on the past, they both exaggerated the value of the nobles and the Estates General--Saint-Simon laying more stress on the former, Fénelon on the latter--as checks to absolutism. That there should be a certain similarity between their ideas is only to be expected, for though they were not personally acquainted, they had a common link in the Duc de"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/57929"],["title","Selections from Saint-Simon (#2)"],["body","urgogne, and it was just at the time that Saint-Simon was having frequent conferences with the latter that his two great friends, the Duc de Beauvillier and the Duc de Chevreuse, held long conversations on affairs of state with Fénelon at Chaulnes (November, 1711). From the conferences of Saint-Simon and the Duc de Bourgogne sprang the _Projets de gouvernement_, the manuscript of which was found among Saint-Simon’s papers, and which is undoubtedly from his pen. The conversations at Chaulnes were summarised in the series of short maxims, known as the _Tables de Chaulnes_, which represent Fénelon’s nearest approach to practical politics.  However deserving of consideration Saint-Simon’s views may have been, his insistence on them in season and out of season cannot have helped to commend them or to make him popular at Court. In his old age he is said to have been a delightful talker, but at Versailles he must have sometimes proved an intolerable bore. “Il faut tenir votre langue,” said Louis XIV to him when he accepted the appointment for his wife. One wonders at the patience with which the Duke of Orleans endured his moral lectures and political disquisitions. But the Duke was too indolent to escape them, and while he must have derived considerable amusement from the peculiarities of his friend’s character he evidently appreciated his transparent honesty. For with all his faults and prejudices, his vanity, his hate, and his vindictiveness, Saint-Simon was essentially honest. It is true that in his intercourse with some men, as for instance Père Tellier, the Duc de Noailles, and Cardinal Dubois, he did not act up to the character which he claims for himself of “droit, franc, libre, naturel, et beaucoup trop simple,” but if his curiosity and thirst for information led him sometimes to assume a friendliness which he did not feel, or if in the slippery days of the Regency he had to meet duplicity with duplicity, he was honest at heart, and he had no lack of moral courage.  He carried this sincerity into his religion. D’Argenson may sneer at him as a _petit dévot_, but his piety was at any rate perfectly genuine. It was the fruit, partly of a careful religious education, and partly of the influence of the Abbé de Rancé. For the monastery of La Trappe was only fifteen miles from La Ferté-Vidame and Saint-Simon often visited it as a child in company with his father. When he came to man’s estate he regarded his father’s friend with that deep and whole-hearted admiration which was one of the finer traits of his character. Every year during the Abbé’s life-time--he died in 1700--Saint-Simon went into retreat at the monastery during Passion-week, and he often consulted the Abbé on matters of conscience. From the Abbé he learnt to look with disfavour on Jansenism, but, as he came to judge more for himself, he was impressed by the noble lives of “Les Messieurs de Port-Royal,” and he declared that recent centuries had produced nothing more saintly, more pure, more learned, more practical, and more elevated, than that famous society. With the Jesuits he was on good terms all his life, and his portrait of Père La Chaise is kindly and appreciative. But in his later volumes he often speaks of them in a hostile spirit, and though he was outwardly on good terms with Père Tellier he cordially disliked him, and his portrait of him is one of the most unflattering in his gallery. In questions of ecclesiastical policy he was, as might be expected from one who was a patriot before he was a Churchman and who did not pretend to theological learning, a convinced Gallican. It was as such, and not as an upholder of Jansenism, that he was strongly opposed to the bull _Unigenitus_.  We have seen that Saint-Simon began to make notes for his _Memoirs_ in July, 1694. Probably these took more or less the form of a diary and consisted of personal impressions, information that he had picked up from various sources, and so forth. Then in 1729 his friend the Duc de Luynes procured for him the journal which the Duke’s grandfather, the Marquis de Dangeau, had kept with extraordinary regularity and accuracy from 1684 down to his death in 1720. Philippe de Courcillon, Marquis de Dangeau, had come to the Court of Louis XIV with no particular advantages of birth, or wealth, or interest. But by his readiness to oblige, his adaptability, and his honesty he made himself indispensable. Among his accomplishments was that of writing _vers de société_ with great facility, which procured his election to the _Académie française_ at the age of thirty. But his chief passport to favour and fortune was his skill and success, coupled with perfect probity, in all kinds of card-games. This is Mme de Sévigné’s account of a game of _reversi_ at Versailles in 1676, in which the King, the Queen, Mme de Montespan, Mme de Soubise, Dangeau, and others took part:    Je voyais jouer Dangeau; et j’admirais combien nous sommes sots   auprès de lui. Il ne songe qu’à son affaire, et gagne où les   autres perdent; il ne néglige rien, il profite de tout, il n’est   point distrait: en un mot, sa bonne conduite défie la fortune;   aussi les deux cent mille francs en dix jours, les cent mille   écus en un mois, tout cela se met sur le livre de sa recette.  Dangeau’s memoirs are little more than a Court journal, in which he seldom allows himself a comment. But the regularity with which it is noted up day by day, the accuracy of its information, and the multitude of small details in which it abounds, make it a useful and valuable authority, as Sainte-Beuve has shewn in the five _causeries_ which he devoted to it[1]. A couple of citations from the year 1688, complete for the day to which they refer, will give an idea of its character:    [1] _Journal_ du Marquis de Dangeau, ed. Soulié, Dussieux, De   Chennevières, Mantz, De Montaiglon, 19 vols. 1854; Sainte-Beuve,   _Causeries du Lundi_, XI.      _Lundi, 26 [janvier] à Versailles._ Le roi alla tirer;     Monseigneur courut le loup; le soir, il y eut appartement.--Le     roi dit qu’il vouloit recommencer à Marly de courre le cerf à     cheval. Depuis sa maladie il ne l’avoit couru qu’en calèche.     On dit que M. de Noirmoustier, qui est aveugle, va épouser la     veuve de feu M. de Brémont qui est fort riche.      _Lundi, 1er mars, à Versailles._ Le roi dîna à son petit     couvert, et alla tirer. Monseigneur courut le loup, qui le mena     fort loin d’ici; il n’arriva qu’à onze heures du soir.--Il y     eut comédie.--Après souper M. le Duc donna bal en masque chez     lui, où Monseigneur demeura jusqu’à la fin, malgré la fatigue     de la journée; les officiers de la garde prétendent qu’il a     fait plus de quarante lieues aujourd’hui.  It is but fair to add that the average entry for the day is rather longer than this, and not so wholly devoid of interest. Saint-Simon is superb in his contempt:      La bassesse d’un humble courtisan, le culte du maître et de     tout ce qui est ou sent la faveur, la prodigalité des plus     fades et des plus misérables louanges, l’encens éternel et     suffoquant jusque des actions du Roi les plus indifférentes,     la terreur et la fadeur suprême qui ne l’abandonnent nulle     part pour ne blesser personne, excuser fort, principalement     dans les généraux et les autres personnes du goût du Roi, de     Mme de Maintenon, des ministres, toutes ces choses éclatent     dans toutes les pages, dont il est rare que chaque journée en     remplisse plus d’une, et dégoûtent merveilleusement.  But Saint-Simon recognised that this commonplace and uncritical Journal, with its accurate chronology and its orderly arrangement, could be of great service to anyone who wished to write true memoirs[2]. Accordingly he had a copy made of the work and during the years 1729-1738 busied himself with adding notes. Some of these were of considerable length, such as the original draft of the _tableau_ or long digression on the character of Louis XIV and his reign, and an elaborate portrait of Louvois, which was not inserted in the _Memoirs_. About the year 1739 he began to arrange his materials which consisted of the Journal with the notes, other notes which he had accumulated during the last forty-five years, portraits, detailed descriptions, and various essays on the history and genealogy of certain families. He was now able to begin writing out his _Memoirs_ in full. In 1740 he was dealing with the events of 1701. In 1741 or 1742 he had reached the year 1709. By September, 1745, he had come to the end of the reign of Louis XIV, and the _tableau_ in its final form was written between that date and March, 1746. The whole work, which ends with the death of the Regent, was completed in 1751.    [2] XVII. 142. The account of Dangeau and his memoirs which   Saint-Simon here gives on the occasion of his death (pp. 134-144)   is fuller than the earlier portrait in vol. I. 343-346. La   Bruyère’s Pamphile (_Des Grands_) is evidently meant for Dangeau,   and Saint-Simon so accepts it.  On Saint-Simon’s death his _Memoirs_ with his other papers were claimed by his creditors, but the Government took possession of them, and they were read in manuscript by various persons, including Mme du Deffand, who recognised their remarkable merit. Extracts were printed by the Abbé de Voisnenon, and incomplete editions appeared in 1788, 1791, and 1818. But it was not till 1829-1830 that the first authentic and complete edition was published in 21 volumes by General de Saint-Simon. It was, however, badly edited and in 1856-1858, the manuscript having been sold by the General to MM. Hachette for 100,000 francs, Chéruel published a new edition in 20 volumes. This was followed by another edition under the same editorship, with the assistance of Ad. Régnier _fils_ (23 vols. 1873-1886). Neither of these editions was furnished with notes, and before the later one was completed M. de Boislisle had begun to edit for the same firm a noble annotated edition, which"]]]
