The translation is comprised in the same number of lines as the original, and all the preceding remarks on \"Life is a Dream\", whether in reference to the period of the first publication of the drama in Spain, or the principles I kept in view while attempting this version may be applied to it.  As in the Case of \"Life is a Dream\", \"The Wonderful Magician\" has previously been translated entire by an English writer, (\"Justina\", by J.H. 1848); but as Archbishop Trench truly observes, \"the writer did not possess that command of the resources of the English language, which none more than Calderon requires.\"  The Legend on which Calderon founded \"El Magico Prodigioso\" will be found in Surius, \"De probatis Sanctorum historiis\", t. V. (Col. Agr. 1574), p. 351:  \"Vita et Martyrium SS. Cypriani et Justinae, autore Simeone Metaphraste\", and in Chapter cxlii, of the \"Legenda Aurea\" of Jacobus de Voragine \"De Sancta Justina virgine\".  The martyrdom of the Saints took place in the year 290, and their festival is celebrated by the Church on the 26th of September.  Mr. Ticknor in his History of Spanish Literature, 1863, volume ii. p. 369, says that the Wonder-working Magician is founded on \"the same legend on which Milman has founded his 'Martyr of Antioch.'\"  This is a mistake of the learned writer.  \"The Martyr of Antioch\" is founded not on the history of St. Justina but of Saint Margaret, as Milman himself expressly states.  Chapter xciii., \"De Sancta Margareta\", in the \"Legenda Aurea\" of Jacobus de Voragine contains her story.  The third translation in this volume is that of \"The Purgatory of St. Patrick\".  This, though perhaps not so famous as the two preceding dramas, is intended to be given by Don P. De la Escosura, in a selection of Calderon's finest \"comedias\", now being edited by him for the Spanish Academy, as the representative piece of its class -- namely, the mystical drama founded on the lives of Saints.  Mr. Ticknor prefers it to the more celebrated \"Devotion of the Cross,\" and says that it \"is commonly ranked among the best religious plays of the Spanish theatre in the seventeenth century.\"  In all that relates to the famous cave known through the middle ages as the \"Purgatory of Saint Patrick\", as well as the Story of Luis Enius -- the Owain Miles of Ancient English poetry -- Calderon was entirely indebted to the little volume published at Madrid, in 1627, by Juan Perez de Montalvan, entitled \"Vida y Purgatorio de San Patricio\".  This singular work met with immense success.  It went through innumerable editions, and continues to be reprinted in Spain as a chap-book, down to the present day.  I have the fifth impression \"improved and enlarged by the author himself,\" Madrid, 1628, the year after its first appearance:  also a later edition, Madrid, 1664.  As early as 1637 a French translation appeared at Brussels by \"F. A. S. Chartreux, a Bruxelles.\"  In 1642 a second French translation was published at Troyes, by \"R. P. Francois Bouillon, de l'Ordre de S. Francois, et Bachelier de Theologie.\"  Mr. Thomas Wright in his \"Essay on St. Patrick's Purgatory,\" London, 1844, makes the singular mistake of supposing that Bouillon's \"Histoire de la Vie et Purgatoire de S. Patrice\" was founded on the drama of Calderon, it being simply a translation of Montalvan's \"Vida y Purgatorio,\" from which, like itself, Calderon's play was derived.  Among other translations of Montalvan's work may be mentioned one in Dutch (Brussels, 1668) and one in Portuguese (Lisbon, 1738).  It was also translated into German and Italian, but I find no mention of an English version.  For this reason I have thought that a few extracts might be interesting, as showing how closely Calderon adhered even to the language of his predecessor.  In all that relates to the Purgatory, Montalvan's work is itself chiefly compiled from the \"Florilegium Insulae Sanctorum, seu vitae et Actae sanctorum Hiberniae,\" Paris, 1624, fol.  This work, which has now become scarce, was written by Thomas Messingham an Irish priest, the Superior of the Irish Seminary in Paris.  No complete English version appears to have been made of it, but a small tract in English containing everything in the original work that referred to St. Patrick's Purgatory was published at Paris in 1718.  As this tract is perhaps more scarce than even the Florilegium itself, the account of the Purgatory as given by Messingham from the MS. of Henry of Saltrey is reprinted in the notes to this drama in the quaint language of the anonymous translator.  Of this tract, \"printed at Paris in 1718\" without the name of author, publisher or printer, I have not been able to trace another copy.  In other points of interest connected with Calderon's drama, particularly to the clearing up of the difficulty hitherto felt as to the confused list of authorities at the end, the reader is also referred to the notes.  The present version of \"The Purgatory of Saint Patrick\" is, with the exception of a few unimportant lines, an entirely new translation. It is made with the utmost care, imitating all the measures and contained, like the two preceding dramas, in the exact number of lines of the original.  One passage of the translation which I published in 1853 is retained in the notes, as a tribute of respect to the memory of the late John Rutter Chorley, it having been mentioned with praise by that eminent Spanish scholar in an elaborate review of my earlier translations from Calderon, which appeared in the \"Athenaeum\", Nov. 19 and Nov. 26, 1853.  It only remains to add that the text I have followed is that of Hartzenbusch in his edition of Calderon's Comedias, Madrid, 1856 (\"Biblioteca de Autores Espanoles\").  His arrangement of the scenes has been followed throughout, thus enabling the reader in a moment to verify for himself the exactness of the translation by a reference to the original, a crucial test which I rather invite than decline.

The door facing the spectators is half open.  The action commences at nightfall.   SCENE I.  ROSAURA, CLARIN.  ROSAURA in man's attire appears on the rocky heights and descends to the plain.  She is followed by CLARIN.  ROSAURA.  Wild hippogriff swift speeding, Thou that dost run, the winged winds exceeding, Bolt which no flash illumes, Fish without scales, bird without shifting plumes, And brute awhile bereft Of natural instinct, why to this wild cleft, This labyrinth of naked rocks, dost sweep Unreined, uncurbed, to plunge thee down the steep? Stay in this mountain wold, And let the beasts their Phaeton behold. For I, without a guide, Save what the laws of destiny decide, Benighted, desperate, blind. Take any path whatever that doth wind Down this rough mountain to its base, Whose wrinkled brow in heaven frowns in the sun's bright face. Ah, Poland! in ill mood Hast thou received a stranger, since in blood The name thou writest on thy sands Of her who hardly here fares hardly at thy hands. My fate may well say so:-- But where shall one poor wretch find pity in her woe?  CLARIN.  Say two, if you please; Don't leave me out when making plaints like these. For if we are the two Who left our native country with the view Of seeking strange adventures, if we be The two who, madly and in misery, Have got so far as this, and if we still Are the same two who tumbled down this hill, Does it not plainly to a wrong amount, To put me in the pain and not in the account?  ROSAURA.  I do not wish to impart, Clarin, to thee, the sorrows of my heart; Mourning for thee would spoil the consolation Of making for thyself thy lamentation; For there is such a pleasure in complaining, That a philosopher I've heard maintaining One ought to seek a sorrow and be vain of it, In order to be privileged to complain of it.  CLARIN.  That same philosopher Was an old drunken fool, unless I err: Oh, that I could a thousand thumps present him, In order for complaining to content him! But what, my lady, say, Are we to do, on foot,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6363"],["title","Life Is a Dream (#2)"],["body","ne, our way Lost in the shades of night? For see, the sun descends another sphere to light.  ROSAURA.  So strange a misadventure who has seen? But if my sight deceives me not, between These rugged rocks, half-lit by the moon's ray And the declining day, It seems, or is it fancy? that I see A human dwelling?  CLARIN.  So it seems to me, Unless my wish the longed-for lodging mocks.  ROSAURA.  A rustic little palace 'mid the rocks Uplifts its lowly roof, Scarce seen by the far sun that shines aloof. Of such a rude device Is the whole structure of this edifice, That lying at the feet Of these gigantic crags that rise to greet The sun's first beams of gold, It seems a rock that down the mountain rolled.  CLARIN.  Let us approach more near, For long enough we've looked at it from here; Then better we shall see If those who dwell therein will generously A welcome give us.  ROSAURA.  See an open door (Funereal mouth 'twere best the name it bore), From which as from a womb The night is born, engendered in its gloom.  [The sound of chains is heard within.]  CLARIN.  Heavens!  what is this I hear?  ROSAURA.  Half ice, half fire, I stand transfixed with fear.  CLARIN.  A sound of chains, is it not? Some galley-slave his sentence here hath got; My fear may well suggest it so may be.          *     *     *     *     *   SCENE II.  SIGISMUND, [in the tower.]  ROSAURA, CLARIN.  SIGISMUND [within].  Alas!  Ah, wretched me!  Ah, wretched me!  ROSAURA.  Oh what a mournful wail! Again my pains, again my fears prevail.  CLARIN.  Again with fear I die.  ROSAURA.  Clarin!  CLARIN.      My lady!  ROSAURA.            Let us turn and fly The risks of this enchanted tower.  CLARIN.      For one, I scarce have strength to stand, much less to run.  ROSAURA.  Is not that glimmer there afar -- That dying exhalation -- that pale star -- A tiny taper, which, with trembling blaze Flickering 'twixt struggling flames and dying rays, With ineffectual spark Makes the dark dwelling place appear more dark? Yes, for its distant light, Reflected dimly, brings before my sight A dungeon's awful gloom, Say rather of a living corse, a living tomb; And to increase my terror and surprise, Drest in the skins of beasts a man there lies: A piteous sight, Chained, and his sole companion this poor light. Since then we cannot fly, Let us attentive to his words draw nigh, Whatever they may be.  [The doors of the tower open wide, and SIGISMUND is discovered in chains and clad in the skins of beasts.  The light in the tower increases.]  SIGISMUND.  Alas!  Ah, wretched me!  Ah, wretched me! Heaven, here lying all forlorn, I desire from thee to know, Since thou thus dost treat me so, Why have I provoked thy scorn By the crime of being born?-- Though for being born I feel Heaven with me must harshly deal, Since man's greatest crime on earth Is the fatal fact of birth -- Sin supreme without appeal. This alone I ponder o'er, My strange mystery to pierce through; Leaving wholly out of view Germs my hapless birthday bore, How have I offended more, That the more you punish me? Must not other creatures be Born?  If born, what privilege Can they over me allege Of which I should not be free? Birds are born, the bird that sings, Richly robed by Nature's dower, Scarcely floats -- a feathered flower, Or a bunch of blooms with wings -- When to heaven's high halls it springs, Cuts the blue air fast and free, And no longer bound will be By the nest's secure control:-- And with so much more of soul, Must I have less liberty? Beasts are born, the beast whose skin Dappled o'er with beauteous spots, As when the great pencil dots Heaven with stars, doth scarce begin From its impulses within-- Nature's stern necessity, To be schooled in cruelty,-- Monster, waging ruthless war:-- And with instincts better far Must I have less liberty? Fish are born, the spawn that breeds Where the oozy sea-weeds float, Scarce perceives itself a boat, Scaled and plated for its needs, When from wave to wave it speeds, Measuring all the mighty sea, Testing its profundity To its depths so dark and chill:-- And with so much freer will, Must I have less liberty? Streams are born, a coiled-up snake When its path the streamlet finds, Scarce a silver serpent winds 'Mong the flowers it must forsake, But a song of praise doth wake, Mournful though its music be, To the plain that courteously Opes a path through which it flies:-- And with life that never dies, Must I have less liberty? When I think of this I start, Aetna-like in wild unrest I would pluck from out my breast Bit by bit my burning heart:-- For what law can so depart From all right, as to deny One lone man that liberty -- That sweet gift which God bestows On the crystal stream that flows, Birds and fish that float or fly?  ROSAURA.  Fear and deepest sympathy Do I feel at every word.  SIGISMUND.  Who my sad lament has heard? What!  Clotaldo!  CLARIN [aside to his mistress].      Say 'tis he.  ROSAURA.  No, 'tis but a wretch (ah, me!) Who in these dark caves and cold Hears the tale your lips unfold.  SIGISMUND.  Then you'll die for listening so, That you may not know I know That you know the tale I told.  [Seizes her.]  Yes, you'll die for loitering near: In these strong arms gaunt and grim I will tear you limb from limb.  CLARIN.  I am deaf and couldn't hear:-- No!  ROSAURA.      If human heart you bear, 'Tis enough that I prostrate me. At thy feet, to liberate me!  SIGISMUND.  Strange thy voice can so unbend me, Strange thy sight can so suspend me, And respect so penetrate me! Who art thou? for though I see Little from this lonely room, This, my cradle and my tomb. Being all the world to me, And if birthday it could be, Since my birthday I have known But this desert wild and lone, Where throughout my life's sad course I have lived, a breathing corse, I have moved, a skeleton; And though I address or see Never but one man alone, Who my sorrows all hath known, And through whom have come to me Notions of earth, sky, and sea; And though harrowing thee again, Since thou'lt call me in this den, Monster fit for bestial feasts, I'm a man among wild beasts, And a wild beast amongst men. But though round me has been wrought All this woe, from beasts I've learned Polity, the same discerned Heeding what the birds had taught, And have measured in my thought The fair orbits of the spheres; You alone, 'midst doubts and fears, Wake my wonder and surprise -- Give amazement to my eyes, Admiration to my ears. Every time your face I see You produce a new amaze: After the most steadfast gaze, I again would gazer be. I believe some hydropsy Must affect my sight, I think Death must hover on the brink Of those wells of light, your eyes, For I look with fresh surprise, And though death result, I drink. Let me see and die:  forgive me; For I do not know, in faith, If to see you gives me death, What to see you not would give me; Something worse than death would grieve me, Anger, rage, corroding care, Death, but double death it were, Death with tenfold terrors rife, Since what gives the wretched life, Gives the happy death, despair!  ROSAURA.  Thee to see wakes such dismay, Thee to hear I so admire, That I'm powerless to inquire, That I know not what to say: Only this, that I to-day, Guided by a wiser will, Have here come to cure my ill, Here consoled my grief to see, If a wretch consoled can be Seeing one more wretched still. Of a sage, who roamed dejected, Poor, and wretched, it is said, That one day, his wants being fed By the herbs which he collected, \"Is there one\" (he thus reflected) \"Poorer than I am to-day?\" Turning round him to survey, He his answer got, detecting A still poorer sage collecting Even the leaves he threw away. Thus complaining to excess, Mourning fate, my life I led, And when thoughtlessly I said To myself, \"Does earth possess One more steeped in wretchedness?\" I in thee the answer find. Since revolving in my mind, I perceive that all my pains To become thy joyful gains Thou hast gathered and entwined. And if haply some slight solace By these pains may be imparted,* Hear attentively the story Of my life's supreme disasters. I am ....

ROSAURA.  New confusion now I suffer.  SIGISMUND.  'Tis Clotaldo, who here guards me; Are not yet my miseries ended?  CLOTALDO [within].  Hasten hither, quick! be active! And before they can defend them, Kill them on the spot, or capture!  [Voices within.]  Treason!  CLARIN.      Watchguards of this tower, Who politely let us pass here, Since you have the choice of killing Or of capturing, choose the latter.  [Enter CLOTALDO and Soldiers; he with a pistol, and all with their faces covered.]  CLOTALDO [aside to the Soldiers].  Keep your faces all well covered, For it is a vital matter That we should be known by no one, While I question these two stragglers.  CLARIN.  Are there masqueraders here?  CLOTALDO.  Ye who in your ignorant rashness Have passed through the bounds and limits Of this interdicted valley, 'Gainst the edict of the King, Who has publicly commanded None should dare descry the wonder That among these rocks is guarded, Yield at once your arms and lives, Or this pistol, this cold aspic Formed of steel, the penetrating Poison of two balls will scatter, The report and fire of which Will the air astound and startle.  SIGISMUND.  Ere you wound them, ere you hurt them, Will my life, O tyrant master, Be the miserable victim Of these wretched chains that clasp me; Since in them, I vow to God, I will tear myself to fragments With my hands, and with my teeth, In these rocks here, in these caverns, Ere I yield to their misfortunes, Or lament their sad disaster."]]]
