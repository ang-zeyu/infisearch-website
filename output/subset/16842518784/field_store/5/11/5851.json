Truth remains true, the fault's in the prover;     The zeal was good, and the aspiration;   And yet, and yet, yet, fifty times over,     Pharaoh received no demonstration,   By his Baker's dream of Basket Three,   Of the doctrine of the Trinity,--   Although, as our preacher thus embellished it,   Apparently his hearers relished it   With so unfeigned a gust--who knows if   They did not prefer our friend to Joseph?   But so it is everywhere, one way with all of them!     These people have really felt, no doubt,   A something, the motion they style the Call of them;     And this is their method of bringing about,   By a mechanism of words and tones,    (So many texts in so many groans)   A sort of reviving and reproducing,     More or less perfectly, (who can tell?)   The mood itself, which strengthens by using;     And how that happens, I understand well.   A tune was born in my head last week,   Out of the thump-thump and shriek-shriek     Of the train, as I came by it, up from Manchester;   And when, next week, I take it back again,   My head will sing to the engine's clack again,     While it only makes my neighbour's haunches stir,   --Finding no dormant musical sprout   In him, as in me, to be jolted out.   'Tis the taught already that profits by teaching;   He gets no more from the railway's preaching     Than, from this preacher who does the rail's office, I:   Whom therefore the flock cast a jealous eye on.   Still, why paint over their door \"Mount Zion,\"   To which all flesh shall come, saith the prophecy?     V    But wherefore be harsh on a single case?     After how many modes, this Christmas Eve,   Does the self-same weary thing take place?     The same endeavour to make you believe,   And with much the same effect, no more:     Each method abundantly convincing,   As I say, to those convinced before,     But scarce to be swallowed without wincing   By the not-as-yet-convinced. For me,   I have my own church equally:   And in this church my faith sprang first!     (I said, as I reached the rising ground,   And the wind began again, with a burst     Of rain in my face, and a glad rebound   From the heart beneath, as if, God speeding me,   I entered his church-door, nature leading me)   --In youth I look to these very skies,   And probing their immensities,   I found God there, his visible power;     Yet felt in my heart, amid all its sense     Of the power, an equal evidence   That his love, there too, was the nobler dower.   For the loving worm within its clod,   Were diviner than a loveless god   Amid his worlds, I will dare to say.     You know what I mean: God's all, man's nought:     But also, God, whose pleasure brought   Man into being, stands away     As it were a handbreadth off, to give   Room for the newly-made to live,   And look at him from a place apart,   And use his gifts of brain and heart,   Given, indeed, but to keep for ever.   Who speaks of man, then, must not sever   Man's very elements from man,   Saying, \"But all is God's\"--whose plan   Was to create man and then leave him   Able, his own word saith, to grieve him   But able to glorify him too,   As a mere machine could never do,   That prayed or praised, all unaware   Of its fitness for aught but praise and prayer,   Made perfect as a thing of course.   Man, therefore, stands on his own stock   Of love and power as a pin-point rock:   And, looking to God who ordained divorce   Of the rock from his boundless continent,   Sees, in his power made evident,   Only excess by a million-fold   O'er the power God gave man in the mould.   For, note: man's hand, first formed to carry   A few pounds' weight, when taught to marry   Its strength with an engine's, lifts a mountain,     --Advancing in power by one degree;     And why count steps through eternity?   But love is the ever-springing fountain:   Man may enlarge or narrow his bed   For the water's play, but the water-head--   How can he multiply or reduce it?     As easy create it, as cause it to cease;   He may profit by it, or abuse it,     But 'tis not a thing to bear increase   As power does: be love less or more     In the heart of man, he keeps it shut     Or opes it wide, as he pleases, but   Love's sum remains what it was before.   So, gazing up, in my youth, at love   As seen through power, ever above   All modes which make it manifest,   My soul brought all to a single test--   That he, the Eternal First and Last,   Who, in his power, had so surpassed   All man conceives of what is might,--   Whose wisdom, too, showed infinite,   --Would prove as infinitely good;   Would never, (my soul understood,)   With power to work all love desires,   Bestow e'en less than man requires;   That he who endlessly was teaching,   Above my spirit's utmost reaching,   What love can do in the leaf or stone,   (So that to master this alone,   This done in the stone or leaf for me,   I must go on learning endlessly)   Would never need that I, in turn,     Should point him out defect unheeded,   And show that God had yet to learn     What the meanest human creature needed,   --Not life, to wit, for a few short years,   Tracking his way through doubts and fears,   While the stupid earth on which I stay     Suffers no change, but passive adds     Its myriad years to myriads,   Though I, he gave it to, decay,   Seeing death come and choose about me,   And my dearest ones depart without me.   No: love which, on earth, amid all the shows of it,     Has ever been seen the sole good of life in it,   The love, ever growing there, spite of the strife in it.     Shall arise, made perfect, from death's repose of it,   And I shall behold thee, face to face,   O God, and in thy light retrace   How in all I loved here, still wast thou!   Whom pressing to, then, as I fain would now,   I shall find as able to satiate     The love, thy gift, as my spirit's wonder   Thou art able to quicken and sublimate,     With this sky of thine, that I now walk under,   And glory in thee for, as I gaze   Thus, thus! Oh, let men keep their ways   Of seeking thee in a narrow shrine--   Be this my way! And this is mine!     VI    For lo, what think you? suddenly   The rain and the wind ceased, and the sky   Received at once the full fruition   Of the moon's consummate apparition.   The black cloud-barricade was riven,   Ruined beneath her feet, and driven   Deep in the West; while, bare and breathless,     North and South and East lay ready   For a glorious thing that, dauntless, deathless,     Sprang across them and stood steady.   'Twas a moon-rainbow, vast and perfect,   From heaven to heaven extending, perfect   As the mother-moon's self, full in face.   It rose, distinctly at the base     With its seven proper colours chorded,   Which still, in the rising, were compressed,   Until at last they coalesced,     And supreme the spectral creature lorded   In a triumph of whitest white,--   Above which intervened the night.   But above night too, like only the next,     The second of a wondrous sequence,     Reaching in rare and rarer frequence,   Till the heaven of heavens were circumflexed,   Another rainbow rose, a mightier,   Fainter, flushier and flightier,--   Rapture dying along its verge.   Oh, whose foot shall I see emerge,   Whose, from the straining topmost dark,   On to the keystone of that arc?     VII    This sight was shown me, there and then,--   Me, out of a world of men,   Singled forth, as the chance might hap   To another if, in a thunderclap   Where I heard noise and you saw flame,   Some one man knew God called his name.   For me, I think I said, \"Appear!   \"Good were it to be ever here.   \"If thou wilt, let me build to thee   \"Service-tabernacles three,   \"Where, forever in thy presence,   \"In ecstatic acquiescence,   \"Far alike from thriftless learning   \"And ignorance's undiscerning,   \"I may worship and remain!\"     Thus at the show above me, gazing   With upturned eyes, I felt my brain     Glutted with the glory, blazing   Throughout its whole mass, over and under   Until at length it burst asunder   And out of it bodily there streamed,   The too-much glory, as it seemed,   Passing from out me to the ground,   Then palely serpentining round   Into the dark with mazy error.     VIII    All at once I looked up with terror.   He was there.   He himself with his human air.   On the narrow pathway, just before.   I saw the back of him, no more--   He had left the chapel, then, as I.   I forgot all about the sky.   No face: only the sight   Of a sweepy garment, vast and white,   With a hem that I could recognize.   I felt terror, no surprise;   My mind filled with the cataract,   At one bound of the mighty fact.   \"I remember, he did say     \"Doubtless that, to this world's end,   \"Where two or three should meet and pray,     \"He would be in their midst, their friend;   \"Certainly he was there with them!\"     And my pulses leaped for joy     Of the golden thought without alloy,   Then I saw his very vesture's hem.   Then rushed the blood back, cold and clear,   With a fresh enhancing shiver of fear;   And I hastened, cried out while I pressed   To the salvation of the vest,   \"But not so, Lord! It cannot be   \"That thou, indeed, art leaving me--   \"Me, that have despised thy friends!   \"Did my heart make no amends?   \"Thou art the love of God--above   \"His power, didst hear me place his love,   \"And that was leaving the world for thee.   \"Therefore thou must not turn from me   \"As I had chosen the other part!   \"Folly and pride o'ercame my heart.   \"Our best is bad, nor bears thy test;   \"Still, it should be our very best.   \"I thought it best that thou, the spirit,     \"Be worshipped in spirit and in truth,   \"And in beauty, as even we require it--     \"Not in the forms burlesque, uncouth,   \"I left but now, as scarcely fitted   \"For thee: I knew not what I pitied. "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6670"],["title","Christmas Eve (#2)"],["body","  \"But, all I felt there, right or wrong,   \"What is it to thee, who curest sinning?   \"Am I not weak as thou art strong?     \"I have looked to thee from the beginning,   \"Straight up to thee through all the world   \"Which, like an idle scroll, lay furled   \"To nothingness on either side:   \"And since the time thou wast descried,   \"Spite of the weak heart, so have I   \"Lived ever, and so fain would die,   \"Living and dying, thee before!   \"But if thou leavest me----\"     IX                                Less or more,   I suppose that I spoke thus.   When,--have mercy, Lord, on us!   The whole face turned upon me full.     And I spread myself beneath it,     As when the bleacher spreads, to seethe it   In the cleansing sun, his wool,--   Steeps in the flood of noontide whiteness     Some denied, discoloured web--   So lay I, saturate with brightness.     And when the flood appeared to ebb,   Lo, I was walking, light and swift,     With my senses settling fast and steadying,   But my body caught up in the whirl and drift     Of the vesture's amplitude, still eddying   On, just before me, still to be followed,     As it carried me after with its motion:   What shall I say?--as a path were hollowed     And a man went weltering through the ocean,   Sucked along in the flying wake   Of the luminous water-snake.   Darkness and cold were cloven, as through   I passed, upborne yet walking too.   And I turned to myself at intervals,--   \"So he said, so it befalls.   \"God who registers the cup     \"Of mere cold water, for his sake   \"To a disciple rendered up,     \"Disdains not his own thirst to slake   \"At the poorest love was ever offered:   \"And because my heart I proffered,   \"With true love trembling at the brim,   \"He suffers me to follow him   \"For ever, my own way,--dispensed   \"From seeking to be influenced   \"By all the less immediate ways     \"That earth, in worships manifold,   \"Adopts to reach, by prayer and praise,     \"The garment's hem, which, lo, I hold!\"     X    And so we crossed the world and stopped.     For where am I, in city or plain,     Since I am 'ware of the world again?   And what is this that rises propped   With pillars of prodigious girth?   Is it really on the earth,   This miraculous Dome of God?   Has the angel's measuring-rod   Which numbered cubits, gem from gem,   'Twixt the gates of the New Jerusalem,   Meted it out,--and what he meted,   Have the sons of men completed?   --Binding, ever as he bade,   Columns in the colonnade   With arms wide open to embrace   The entry of the human race   To the breast of... what is it, yon building,   Ablaze in front, all paint and gilding,   With marble for brick, and stones of price   For garniture of the edifice?   Now I see; it is no dream;   It stands there and it does not seem;   For ever, in pictures, thus it looks,   And thus I have read of it in books   Often in England, leagues away,   And wondered how these fountains play,   Growing up eternally   Each to a musical water-tree,   Whose blossoms drop, a glittering boon,   Before my eyes, in the light of the moon,   To the granite layers underneath.   Liar and dreamer in your teeth!   I, the sinner that speak to you,   Was in Rome this night, and stood, and knew   Both this and more. For see, for see,   The dark is rent, mine eye is free   To pierce the crust of the outer wall,   And I view inside, and all there, all,   As the swarming hollow of a hive,   The whole Basilica alive!   Men in the chancel, body and nave,   Men on the pillars' architrave,   Men on the statues, men on the tombs   With popes and kings in their porphyry wombs,   All famishing in expectation   Of the main-altar's consummation.   For see, for see, the rapturous moment   Approaches, and earth's best endowment   Blends with heaven's; the taper-fires   Pant up, the winding brazen spires   Heave loftier yet the baldachin; [Footnote: Canopy over the High Altar.]   The incense-gaspings, long kept in,   Suspire in clouds; the organ blatant   Holds his breath and grovels latent,   As if God's hushing finger grazed him,   (Like Behemoth when he praised him)   At the silver bell's shrill tinkling,   Quick cold drops of terror sprinkling   On the sudden pavement strewed   With faces of the multitude.   Earth breaks up, time drops away,   In flows heaven, with its new day   Of endless life, when He who trod,   Very man and very God,   This earth in weakness, shame and pain,   Dying the death whose signs remain   Up yonder on the accursed tree,--   Shall come again, no more to be   Of captivity the thrall,   But the one God, All in all,   King of kings, Lord of lords,   As His servant John received the words,   \"I died, and live for evermore!\"     XI    Yet I was left outside the door.   \"Why sit I here on the threshold-stone   \"Left till He return, alone   \"Save for the garment's extreme fold   \"Abandoned still to bless my hold?\"   My reason, to my doubt, replied,   As if a book were opened wide,   And at a certain page I traced   Every record undefaced,   Added by successive years,--   The harvestings of truth's stray ears   Singly gleaned, and in one sheaf   Bound together for belief.   Yes, I said--that he will go   And sit with these in turn, I know.   Their faith's heart beats, though her head swims   Too giddily to guide her limbs,   Disabled by their palsy-stroke   From propping mine. Though Rome's gross yoke   Drops off, no more to be endured,   Her teaching is not so obscured   By errors and perversities,   That no truth shines athwart the lies:   And he, whose eye detects a spark   Even where, to man's, the whole seems dark,   May well see flame where each beholder   Acknowledges the embers smoulder.   But I, a mere man, fear to quit   The clue God gave me as most fit   To guide my footsteps through life's maze,   Because himself discerns all ways   Open to reach him: I, a man   Able to mark where faith began   To swerve aside, till from its summit   Judgment drops her damning plummet,   Pronouncing such a fatal space   Departed from the founder's base:   He will not bid me enter too,   But rather sit, as now I do,   Awaiting his return outside.   --'Twas thus my reason straight replied   And joyously I turned, and pressed   The garment's skirt upon my breast,   Until, afresh its light suffusing me,   My heart cried--What has been abusing me   That I should wait here lonely and coldly,   Instead of rising, entering boldly,   Baring truth's face, and letting drift   Her veils of lies as they choose to shift?   Do these men praise him? I will raise   My voice up to their point of praise!   I see the error; but above   The scope of error, see the love.--   Oh, love of those first Christian days!   --Fanned so soon into a blaze,   From the spark preserved by the trampled sect,   That the antique sovereign Intellect   Which then sat ruling in the world,   Like a change in dreams, was hurled   From the throne he reigned upon:   You looked up and he was gone.   Gone, his glory of the pen!   --Love, with Greece and Rome in ken,   Bade her scribes abhor the trick   Of poetry and rhetoric,   And exult with hearts set free,   In blessed imbecility   Scrawled, perchance, on some torn sheet   Leaving Sallust incomplete   Gone, his pride of sculptor, painter!   --Love, while able to acquaint her   While the thousand statues yet   Fresh from chisel, pictures wet   From brush, she saw on every side,   Chose rather with an infant's pride   To frame those portents which impart   Such unction to true Christian Art.   Gone, music too! The air was stirred   By happy wings: Terpander's* bird   *[Footnote: Terpander, a famous Lesbian musician and lyric poet, 670 B.C.]   (That, when the cold came, fled away)   Would tarry not the wintry day,--   As more-enduring sculpture must,   Till filthy saints rebuked the gust   With which they chanced to get a sight   Of some dear naked Aphrodite   They glanced a thought above the toes of,   By breaking zealously her nose off.   Love, surely, from that music's lingering,   Might have filched her organ-fingering,   Nor chosen rather to set prayings   To hog-grunts, praises to horse-neighings.   Love was the startling thing, the new:   Love was the all-sufficient too;   And seeing that, you see the rest:   As a babe can find its mother's breast   As well in darkness as in light,   Love shut our eyes, and all seemed right.   True, the world's eyes are open now:   --Less need for me to disallow   Some few that keep Love's zone unbuckled,   Peevish as ever to be suckled,   Lulled by the same old baby-prattle   With intermixture of the rattle,   When she would have them creep, stand steady   Upon their feet, or walk already,   Not to speak of trying to climb.   I will be wise another time,   And not desire a wall between us,     When next I see a church-roof cover   So many species of one genus,     All with foreheads bearing _lover_   Written above the earnest eyes of them;     All with breasts that beat for beauty,   Whether sublimed, to the surprise of them,     In noble daring, steadfast duty,   The heroic in passion, or in action,--   Or, lowered for sense's satisfaction,   To the mere outside of human creatures,   Mere perfect form and faultless features.   What? with all Rome here, whence to levy     Such contributions to their appetite,   With women and men in a gorgeous bevy,     They take, as it were, a padlock, clap it tight   On their southern eyes, restrained from     feeding   On the glories of their ancient reading,   On the beauties of their modern singing,   On the wonders of the builder's bringing,   On the majesties of Art around them,--     And, all these loves, late struggling incessant,   When faith has at last united and bound them,     They offer up to God for a present?   Why, I will, on the whole, be rather proud of it,--     And, only taking the act in reference   To the other recipients who might have allowed it,     I will rejoice that God had the preference.
