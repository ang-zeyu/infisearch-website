(14) Reid, Robert (3) Simmons, Edward    Materials of the Palaces    The buildings, as well as all of the statuary, are made of artificial travertine, of a smoked-ivory tone.  Real travertine is found in and around Rome, especially at Tivoli.  It is a pure carbonate of lime, a creamy white deposit formed from dripping water, in stratified form, with cavities and fissures lined with crystals.  The Colosseum and St. Peter's at Rome are both made of this material.  The imitation travertine made with concrete, and used in the second story of the Pennsylvania Station in New York in combination with real travertine of the first story, was invented by Mr. Symmes Richardson of the firm of McKim, Meade and White of New York. He also brought the real travertine to America to have it used for the first time in a large building, the Pennsylvania Station.  Mr. Paul Deneville of New York has most successfully made a plastic travertine, composed of gypsum from Nevada combined with hemp fiber and a coloring pigment, which has been applied to all of the Exposition buildings, producing a most pleasing glareless background under the sunny skies of San Francisco.  The roofs are covered with imitation tiles, since real tiles would be too expensive for Exposition purposes.    Material of the Statues    The architectural statues - that is, those directly connected with the architecture - are of smoked-ivory tone, so that you see them as part of the architectural scheme.  Those far away from the eye, used as free statues, are, in the main, golden.  Those nearer the eye simulate bronze, the special color that seems worked out from the color of the blue eucalyptus.  All the statues of the Exposition palaces and courts are of travertine, the material of which the buildings are made.    Machinery Palace    Architects - Ward and Blohme of San Francisco.  The palace is one of grandeur, dignity and great beauty.  The architecture has been inspired by such old Roman thermae as the Baths of Caracalla, the Baths of Titus and the like.  The ornamentation is of the Italian Renaissance style, worked out on a building that in form suits the needs of a great palace of machinery.  The gable points at the top of the western façade are such as one sees in the restoration of the Baths of Caracalla.  The first and only other expression of this style in America is seen in the Pennsylvania Station of New York City.  In the Transportation Palace can be seen a model of the proposed plan for a new Union Depot for Chicago, with a similar gabled effect.  The three arches reflect on the exterior the three aisles of the same portion of the palace within.  The great columns in front, and also in the vestibule, simulate Siena marble.  The entablature carried across the faces of the arches supports American eagles by C. A. Humphries.  Eagles are also seen at the corners of the Corinthian capitals. This bird of freedom can be found all over the Exposition.  Notice that Mr. Jules Guerin, the great color wizard, leads you by means of the blue ground of the capitals, the blue between the dentils, the blue between the consoles to the blue sky above.  The principal lighting is by great clerestory windows - great windows at the north and the south ends - also by skylights.  The building covers nine acres, and is the largest wooden structure in the world. It is about three blocks long.  The statues as well as the reliefs are by Haig Patigian of San Francisco.  Vigorous types like machinery itself are used.  The generation, transmission and application of power as applied to machinery are most interestingly represented.  The decorated drums of the columns show the Genii of Machinery.  The eyes of these figures are closed, reminding you that power comes from within.  Notice how from any point of view your figures suggest support at the sides of the drum.  The very position of the arms gives you a strong feeling of support.  The figures on the spandrels represent the application of power to machinery.  The figures on the pedestals represent:  1. \"Steam Power\" with the lever that starts the engine.  2. \"Invention\" showing a more intellectual type of face, carrying the figure with wings spread, suggesting the flight of thought. This thought, as it were, is above the world.  3. \"Electricity\" with foot on the earth, suggesting that electricity is not only in the earth, but around it. He carries his symbol, electricity.  4. \"Imagination,\" showing man with his eyes closed - seeing within. The bird of inspiration, the eagle, is about to take flight.  The wings on the head suggest the rapidity of thought or action.  Inside this great palace one sees the latest inventions in machinery. Ponderous machines capable of shaping tons of metal, great labor-saving machines, and all sorts of electrical appliances. \"Safety first\" is a pronounced feature of this exhibit.    Palace of Varied Industries    Architect - W. B. Faville of San Francisco.  The high walls, averaging seventy feet to the cornice, with their respective buttresses, are strongly suggestive of the California missions of the eighteenth century.  The \"California bear\" and the Seal of California are in decorative and suggestive evidence at the tops of the buttresses.  The green domes on the palace belong to the Byzantine school of architecture, such domes as one sees in the mosques of Constantinople and other Mohammedan centers.  The windows seen in the corner towers are the same kind that one sees used in the majority of mosques.  The beautiful central portal, facing south, is modeled after the Portal of the Hospice of Santa Cruz at Toledo, Spain.  It is 16th century Spanish Renaissance, known as the Plateresque style (from platero, silversmith).  The columns suggest a wood origin and look as if they had been turned in a lathe.  The portal is the color of cork, illuminated here and there with niche walls of pink, and touches of ultramarine blue.  The fine figure work representing the modern industrial types is by Ralph Stackpole of Oregon, whose home is now in San Francisco. He expresses himself most simply and unaffectedly, in clear, broad treatment, and makes the ordinary workman a man to be honored and respected.  The upper figures represent an old man handing his burden to a younger man. The Old World Handing Its Burden to the Younger World, that is America, is finely suggested.  The keystone figure represents The Power of"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5620"],["title","Palaces and Courts of the Exposition (#2)"],["body","ndustry, the man who both thinks and uses his hands.  In the tympanum are the types representing the Varied Industries.  In the center is Agriculture representing the food side of life. On the left a workman, possibly an architect, suggests the refinements of the varied industries, while on the right one sees the ordinary workman with his sledge-hammer, bringing to mind the rougher side of industry. In the left corner a woman with her spindle - a lamb standing near - recalls the making of textiles. Commerce occupies the right corner, holding the prow of a vessel with its figurehead.  The Workman with his pick is repeated in the four niches.  The two flanking portals are also in the plateresque style with devices of this Spanish Renaissance period represented on them.  The shields, or cartouches as they are called, have no special meaning, being only ornaments of this particular period.  The portals on the east of the Palace of Varied Industries and also of the Palace of Mines are suggestive of gateways of old Roman walled cities, like those of Perugia, for instance. This Italian type of portal is chosen since Machinery Palace opposite is in the Italian style of architecture.  Notice how the pastel pink accents the portal.  The figure of \"The Miner\" in the niches is by Albert Weinert, whose work in the Congressional Library at Washington is well known.  The Palace of Varied Industries has an exhibition of the more refined manufactures, those articles that are regarded more as luxuries, such as bronzes, jewelry, silverware, fine pottery, porcelains, rugs, leather work, silks, etc.  The Palace of Mines deals with the smelting of metals, a fine exhibition of different ores, and above all \"Safety First\" in its relation to mines. The Mines Rescue work is most interesting.    Flora of the Avenue of Progress and the Avenue of Palms    Eucalyptus globulus (blue gum). Eucalyptus robusta. Eucalyptus viminalis. Cupressus macrocarpa (Monterey cypress). Laurestinus. Australian pea vine on the palms. Muhlenbeckia (Australian mattress vine) against the base of Machinery       Palace. Honeysuckle against the base of the Varied Industries Palace. Lawson cypress. Libocedrus decurrens (incense cedar). Acacia floribunda. Acacia latifolia. Albizzia lophantha. Abies menziesü (fir). Picea Engelmanni (spruce). Picea excelsa (from Norway) (spruce). Pittosporum. Rhododendrons (notice how they work upon the pink walls) (for color). Cinerarias (for color). Cyclamen (for color). Dracaena indivisa (cabbage palm). Woodwardias. Japanese strawberry.  Notice Mr. McLaren's devices for covering the ground.  The lophantha lawn, it might be called, is an artificial device for producing a most lovely effect. The tree is stripped of all branches until it has attained the height of four feet, the top being trained and flattened into a head five feet across. The trees are placed close enough together so that the tops interlace, producing thereby a continuous green surface.  The veronica, buxifolia is the light green border at the side and in front of the Palace of Varied Industries.  Achanea from New Zealand and Australia is used on the banks and accords most harmoniously with the albizzia lophantha.  The abelia rupestris is the red leafed plant with pink blossoms.  Peonia moutan daikaqura is the peony.  Since the small plants in front of the permanent shrubs are changed periodically, a list of everything planted is of course out of the question.  The technical names are suggested with a few of the trees and shrubs so that you can continue this line of work for yourself.  Since the botanical names are placed on the plants in many places you can easily find what you seek.    The Palace of Manufactures and also The Palace of Liberal Arts (Since they are alike.)    The portal is Spanish Renaissance with grill work. Notice the pastel pink, turquoise blue and burnt orange on this portal. This coloring is a means of strongly accenting this fine architectural feature.  The panel (representing the making of glass, metal work, textiles, statuary, etc.), as well as the female figure holding the spindle and the male with the sledge-hammer, are by Mahonri Young of Salt Lake City, Utah.  The wall niches show elephants and lions used alternately - a fine oriental touch. The heads are used as fountains.  \"Acroterium\" is the Victory on the gables, many times repeated. It is the work of Frank Edwin Elwell, curator of Ancient Art, at the Metropolitan Museum of New York.  Viewing the figure from the side, you are reminded of the Victory of Samothrace. She is noticeably beautiful against the late afternoon sky and also against the blue morning sky.  You will notice that the flora is just the same in the main in front of these buildings as it was in front of the others you have seen, the grass lawn here taking the place of the albizzia lophantha.  Sweet peas, daffodils, rhododendrons, evening primroses, Japanese magnolias, coronilla are added for color.  The Palace of Manufactures shows the coarser, heavier articles, such as furniture, carpets, woolen goods, hardware. Many articles are being made in this palace.  The Palace of Liberal Arts includes all kinds of printing, book binding, engraving, photographic apparatus, especially in the line of moving pictures and color photography, theatrical appliances, musical instruments, instruments of precision, wireless telegraphy and the wireless telephone, etc.    Palace of Education    Architect - W. B. Faville of San Francisco.  There are three portals on the south in the Spanish Renaissance style, with twisted columns of the Byzantine school. Notice that the screws twist in opposite directions.  Above the central portal is Gustav Gerlach's tympanum relief \"Education.\" The tree of knowledge is seen in the background. The kindergarten stage, the half-grown, and the mature periods are shown, the last showing the man no longer under a teacher, but working his problem out by himself.  The modern costumes, combined with the classical styles, suggest that the knowledge of today rests upon that of the old schools. Mr. Gerlach is a pupil of Karl Bitter of New York, the Chief of the Sculpture.  Below the tympanum is the open book of knowledge from which light radiates in all directions. The curtains of darkness have been drawn aside. The hour-glass says, \"Improve the shining moments as they pass.\"  The crown awaits those who will seek knowledge.  Atop this portal is the globe suggesting that education extends around the world.  The panel on the left shows the female teacher in the center. She is instructing her hearers who discuss their interests.  This panel is by Peters.  The companion panel with the male teacher is by Cesare Stea.  Both panels are quite evident in meaning. Messrs. Peters and Stea are pupils of the Beaux Arts of Paris and the National School of Sculpture of America, respectively.  The Palace of Education and Social Economy shows developments since 1905. Comparative exhibits of educational interests of all nations are shown.  Child welfare, playgrounds, care of the feebleminded, treatment of the insane, missionary work, the Red Cross system, criminology, park systems, street improvements, methods of disposing of sewage, and many other allied subjects are interestingly worked out for public benefit.  The flora is just about the same in front of these palaces as that which you have noticed. The veronica buxifolia is grouped around the lawn at the corner of Palm and Administration Avenues.  The west side of the Palace of Education as well as that of the Palace of Food Products, has great Roman half domes above the entrances. Again your architecture at the portals is changed to suit the style of the palace opposite. The Fine Arts Palace is mainly old Roman.  These are called respectively \"The Dome of Philosophy\" and \"The Dome of Plenty.\" The female figures carrying the books \"Ex libris,\" as well as the male figures carrying cereal wreaths, are by Albert Weinert and Earl Cummings, respectively.  \"Out of books comes much knowledge,\" says the woman.  \"If you wish to be as physically strong as I am, eat my food,\" says the man. This figure then represents physical vigor.  The fountains of the vestibules are by W. B. Faville of San Francisco. That in the vestibule of the Palace of Food Products is strongly reminiscent of the fountain of Perugia.  The great Siena pedestals beside these palaces carry Ralph Stackpole's \"Thought.\"  The niches have alternate groups of \"Abundance\" and \"Triumph of the Fields,\" both by Chas. Harley of Philadelphia (studio in New York).  Abundance expresses to you the overflowing amount of all that we have today. Her symbol, the cornucopia, is seen on either side. Her large hands are spread out as if to say:  \"I give you all that I have. Take. Choose what you will.\"  One certainly has a bountiful choice.  The eagle's head is on the prow of the vessel in which she sits. It surely suggests that considering all we have put before us today, we have reason for inspiration (the eagle being the symbol of inspiration).  The Triumph of the Fields shows man surrounded by the symbols of the harvest festivals when the Celtic cross, to take one case, or the standard with the bull atop, to take another, was carried through the fields at the time of the bringing in of the harvests.  Man has been the guiding hand to the bull, but the bull has really triumphed since it has actually done the work, while man receives the credit. Man has surmounted the bull, as it were.  Above is the wheel of the wain of old.  The seed in the black earth appears almost to possess intelligence. You get that idea by the head below. Has not the seed produced the bearded barley head you see represented? Does not that power of production appear to be intelligence in the seed?  Below the niches are facsimiles of old Roman baths such as one sees in the Lateran Museum, in Rome. (See picture in Bannister Fletcher's History of Architecture, page 170."]]]
