You all saw a number of large, heavy boxes lowered into the hold before we sailed.  I know you did, because you asked me what they contained and commented upon the large letter 'H' which was painted upon each box.  These boxes contain the various parts of a hydro-aeroplane.  I purpose assembling this upon the strip of beach described in Bowen's manuscript--the beach where he found the dead body of the apelike man--provided there is sufficient space above high water; otherwise we shall have to assemble it on deck and lower it over the side.  After it is assembled, I shall carry tackle and ropes to the cliff-top, and then it will be comparatively simple to hoist the search-party and its supplies in safety.  Or I can make a sufficient number of trips to land the entire party in the valley beyond the barrier; all will depend, of course, upon what my first reconnaissance reveals.\"  That afternoon we steamed slowly along the face of Caprona's towering barrier.  \"You see now,\" remarked Billings as we craned our necks to scan the summit thousands of feet above us, \"how futile it would have been to waste our time in working out details of a plan to surmount those.\" And he jerked his thumb toward the cliffs.  \"It would take weeks, possibly months, to construct a ladder to the top.  I had no conception of their formidable height.  Our mortar would not carry a line halfway to the crest of the lowest point.  There is no use discussing any plan other than the hydro-aeroplane.  We'll find the beach and get busy.\"  Late the following morning the lookout announced that he could discern surf about a mile ahead; and as we approached, we all saw the line of breakers broken by a long sweep of rolling surf upon a narrow beach. The launch was lowered, and five of us made a landing, getting a good ducking in the ice-cold waters in the doing of it; but we were rewarded by the finding of the clean-picked bones of what might have been the skeleton of a high order of ape or a very low order of man, lying close to the base of the cliff.  Billings was satisfied, as were the rest of us, that this was the beach mentioned by Bowen, and we further found that there was ample room to assemble the sea-plane.  Billings, having arrived at a decision, lost no time in acting, with the result that before mid-afternoon we had landed all the large boxes marked \"H\" upon the beach, and were busily engaged in opening them. Two days later the plane was assembled and tuned.  We loaded tackles and ropes, water, food and ammunition in it, and then we each implored Billings to let us be the one to accompany him.  But he would take no one.  That was Billings; if there was any especially difficult or dangerous work to be done, that one man could do, Billings always did it himself.  If he needed assistance, he  never  called  for volunteers--just selected the man or men he considered best qualified for the duty.  He said that he considered the principles underlying all volunteer service fundamentally wrong, and that it seemed to him that calling for volunteers reflected upon the courage and loyalty of the entire command.  We rolled the plane down to the water's edge, and Billings mounted the pilot's seat.  There was a moment's delay as he assured himself that he had everything necessary.  Jimmy Hollis went over his armament and ammunition to see that nothing had been omitted.  Besides pistol and rifle, there was the machine-gun mounted in front of him on the plane, and ammunition for all three.  Bowen's account of the terrors of Caspak had impressed us all with the necessity for proper means of defense.  At last all was ready.  The motor was started, and we pushed the plane out into the surf.  A moment later, and she was skimming seaward. Gently she rose from the surface of the water, executed a wide spiral as she mounted rapidly, circled once far above us and then disappeared over the crest of the cliffs.  We all stood silent and expectant, our eyes glued upon the towering summit above us.  Hollis, who was now in command, consulted his wrist-watch at frequent intervals.  \"Gad,\" exclaimed Short, \"we ought to be hearing from him pretty soon!\"  Hollis laughed nervously.  \"He's been gone only ten minutes,\" he announced.  \"Seems like an hour,\" snapped Short.  \"What's that?  Did you hear that? He's firing!  It's the machine-gun!  Oh, Lord; and here we are as helpless as a lot of old ladies ten thousand miles away!  We can't do a thing.  We don't know what's happening.  Why didn't he let one of us go with him?\"  Yes, it was the machine-gun.  We would hear it distinctly for at least a minute.  Then came silence.  That was two weeks ago.  We have had no sign nor signal from Tom Billings since.    Chapter 2  I'll never forget my first impressions of Caspak as I circled in, high over the surrounding cliffs.  From the plane I looked down through a mist upon the blurred landscape beneath me.  The hot, humid atmosphere of Caspak condenses as it is fanned by the cold Antarctic air-currents which sweep across the crater's top, sending a tenuous ribbon of vapor far out across the Pacific.  Through this the picture gave one the suggestion of a colossal impressionistic canvas in greens and browns and scarlets and yellows surrounding the deep blue of the inland sea--just blobs of color taking form through the tumbling mist.  I dived close to the cliffs and skirted them for several miles without finding the least indication of a suitable landing-place; and then I swung back at a lower level, looking for a clearing close to the bottom of the mighty escarpment; but I could find none of sufficient area to insure safety.  I was flying pretty low by this time, not only looking for landing places but watching the myriad life beneath me.  I was down pretty well toward the south end of the island, where an arm of the lake reaches far inland, and I could see the surface of the water literally black with creatures of some sort.  I was too far up to recognize individuals, but the general impression was of a vast army of amphibious monsters.  The land was almost equally alive with crawling, leaping, running, flying things.  It was one of the latter which nearly did for me while my attention was fixed upon the weird scene below.  The first intimation I had of it was the sudden blotting out of the sunlight from above, and as I glanced quickly up, I saw a most terrific creature swooping down upon me.  It must have been fully eighty feet long from the end of its long, hideous beak to the tip of its thick, short tail, with an equal spread of wings.  It was coming straight for me and hissing frightfully--I could hear it above the whir of the propeller.  It was coming straight down toward the muzzle of the machine-gun and I let it have it right in the breast; but still it came for me, so that I had to dive and turn, though I was dangerously close to earth.  The thing didn't miss me by a dozen feet, and when I rose, it wheeled and followed me, but only to the cooler air close to the level of the cliff-tops; there it turned again and dropped.  Something--man's natural love of battle and the chase, I presume--impelled me to pursue it, and so I too circled and dived.  The moment I came down into the warm atmosphere of Caspak, the creature came for me again, rising above me so that it might swoop down upon me.  Nothing could better have suited my armament, since my machine-gun was pointed upward at an angle of about 45 degrees  and could not be either depressed or elevated by the pilot.  If I had brought someone along with me, we could have raked the great reptile from almost any position, but as the creature's mode of attack was always from above, he always found me ready with a hail of bullets.  The battle must have lasted a minute or more before the thing suddenly turned completely over in the air and fell to the ground.  Bowen and I roomed together at college, and I learned a lot from him outside my regular course.  He was a pretty good scholar despite his love of fun, and his particular hobby was paleontology.  He used to tell me about the various forms of animal and vegetable life which had covered the globe during former eras, and so I was pretty well acquainted with the fishes, amphibians, reptiles, and mammals of paleolithic times.  I knew that the thing that had attacked me was some sort of pterodactyl which should have been extinct millions of years ago.  It was all that I needed to realize that Bowen had exaggerated nothing in his manuscript.  Having disposed of my first foe, I set myself once more to search for a landing-place near to the base of the cliffs beyond which my party awaited me.  I knew how anxious they would be for word from me, and I was equally anxious to relieve their minds and also to get them and our supplies well within Caspak, so that we might set off about our business of finding and rescuing Bowen Tyler; but the pterodactyl's carcass had scarcely fallen before I was surrounded by at least a dozen of the hideous things, some large, some small, but all bent upon my destruction.  I could not cope with them all, and so I rose rapidly from among them to the cooler strata wherein they dared not follow; and then I recalled that Bowen's narrative distinctly indicated that the farther north one traveled in Caspak, the fewer were the terrible reptiles which rendered human life impossible at the southern end of the island.  There seemed nothing now but to search out a more northerly landing-place and then return to the _Toreador_ and transport my companions, two by two, over the cliffs and deposit them"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/552"],["title","The People That Time Forgot (#2)"],["body"," the rendezvous.  As I flew north, the temptation to explore overcame me.  I knew that I could easily cover Caspak and return to the beach with less petrol than I had in my tanks; and there was the hope, too, that I might find Bowen or some of his party.  The broad expanse of the inland sea lured me out over its waters, and as I crossed, I saw at either extremity of the great body of water an island--one to the south and one to the north; but I did not alter my course to examine either closely, leaving that to a later time.  The further shore of the sea revealed a much narrower strip of land between the cliffs and the water than upon the western side; but it was a hillier and more open country.  There were splendid landing-places, and in the distance, toward the north, I thought I descried a village; but of that I was not positive.  However, as I approached the land, I saw a number of human figures apparently pursuing one who fled across a broad expanse of meadow.  As I dropped lower to have a better look at these people, they caught the whirring of my propellers and looked aloft.  They paused an instant--pursuers and pursued; and then they broke and raced for the shelter of the nearest wood.  Almost instantaneously a huge bulk swooped down upon me, and as I looked up, I realized that there were flying reptiles even in this part of Caspak. The creature dived for my right wing so quickly that nothing but a sheer drop could have saved me.  I was already close to the ground, so that my maneuver was extremely dangerous; but I was in a fair way of making it successfully when I saw that I was too closely approaching a large tree.  My effort to dodge the tree and the pterodactyl at the same time resulted disastrously.  One wing touched an upper branch; the plane tipped and swung around, and then, out of control, dashed into the branches of the tree, where it came to rest, battered and torn, forty feet above the ground.  Hissing loudly, the huge reptile swept close above the tree in which my plane had lodged, circled twice over me and then flapped away toward the south.  As I guessed then and was to learn later, forests are the surest sanctuary from these hideous creatures, which, with their enormous spread of wing and their great weight, are as much out of place among trees as is a seaplane.  For a minute or so I clung there to my battered flyer, now useless beyond redemption, my brain numbed by the frightful catastrophe that had befallen me.  All my plans for the succor of Bowen and Miss La Rue had depended upon this craft, and in a few brief minutes my own selfish love of adventure had wrecked their hopes and mine.  And what effect it might have upon the future of the balance of the rescuing expedition I could not even guess.  Their lives, too, might be sacrificed to my suicidal foolishness.  That I was doomed seemed inevitable; but I can honestly say that the fate of my friends concerned me more greatly than did my own.  Beyond the barrier cliffs my party was even now nervously awaiting my return.  Presently apprehension and fear would claim them--and they would never know!  They would attempt to scale the cliffs--of that I was sure; but I was not so positive that they would succeed; and after a while they would turn back, what there were left of them, and go sadly and mournfully upon their return journey to home.  Home!  I set my jaws and tried to forget the word, for I knew that I should never again see home.  And what of Bowen and his girl?  I had doomed them too.  They would never even know that an attempt had been made to rescue them.  If they still lived, they might some day come upon the ruined remnants of this great plane hanging in its lofty sepulcher and hazard vain guesses and be filled with wonder; but they would never know; and I could not but be glad that they would not know that Tom Billings had sealed their death-warrants by his criminal selfishness.  All these useless regrets were getting me in a bad way; but at last I shook myself and tried to put such things out of my mind and take hold of conditions as they existed and do my level best to wrest victory from defeat.  I was badly shaken up and bruised, but considered myself mighty lucky to escape with my life.  The plane hung at a precarious angle, so that it was with difficulty and considerable danger that I climbed from it into the tree and then to the ground.  My predicament was grave.  Between me and my friends lay an inland sea fully sixty miles wide at this point and an estimated land-distance of some three hundred miles around the northern end of the sea, through such hideous dangers as I am perfectly free to admit had me pretty well buffaloed.  I had seen quite enough of Caspak this day to assure me that Bowen had in no way exaggerated its perils.  As a matter of fact, I am inclined to believe that he had become so accustomed to them before he started upon his manuscript that he rather slighted them.  As I stood there beneath that tree--a tree which should have been part of a coal-bed countless ages since--and looked out across a sea teeming with frightful life--life which should have been fossil before God conceived of Adam--I would not have given a minim of stale beer for my chances of ever seeing my friends or the outside world again; yet then and there I swore to fight my way as far through this hideous land as circumstances would permit.  I had plenty of ammunition, an automatic pistol and a heavy rifle--the latter one of twenty added to our equipment on the strength of Bowen's description of the huge beasts of prey which ravaged Caspak.  My greatest danger lay in the hideous reptilia whose low nervous organizations permitted their carnivorous instincts to function for several minutes after they had ceased to live.  But to these things I gave less thought than to the sudden frustration of all our plans.  With the bitterest of thoughts I condemned myself for the foolish weakness that had permitted me to be drawn from the main object of my flight into premature and useless exploration.  It seemed to me then that I must be totally eliminated from further search for Bowen, since, as I estimated it, the three hundred miles of Caspakian territory I must traverse to reach the base of the cliffs beyond which my party awaited me were practically impassable for a single individual unaccustomed to Caspakian life and ignorant of all that lay before him.  Yet I could not give up hope entirely.  My duty lay clear before me; I must follow it while life remained to me, and so I set forth toward the north.  The country through which I took my way was as lovely as it was unusual--I had almost said unearthly, for the plants, the trees, the blooms were not of the earth that I knew.  They were larger, the colors more brilliant and the shapes startling, some almost to grotesqueness, though even such added to the charm and romance of the landscape as the giant cacti render weirdly beautiful the waste spots of the sad Mohave. And over all the sun shone huge and round and red, a monster sun above a monstrous world, its light dispersed by the humid air of Caspak--the warm, moist air which lies sluggish upon the breast of this great mother of life, Nature's mightiest incubator.  All about me, in every direction, was life.  It moved through the tree-tops and among the boles; it displayed itself in widening and intermingling circles upon the bosom of the sea; it leaped from the depths; I could hear it in a dense wood at my right, the murmur of it rising and falling in ceaseless volumes of sound, riven at intervals by a horrid scream or a thunderous roar which shook the earth; and always I was haunted by that inexplicable sensation that unseen eyes were watching me, that soundless feet dogged my trail.  I am neither nervous nor highstrung; but the burden of responsibility upon me weighed heavily, so that I was more cautious than is my wont.  I turned often to right and left and rear lest I be surprised, and I carried my rifle at the ready in my hand.  Once I could have sworn that among the many creatures dimly perceived amidst the shadows of the wood I saw a human figure dart from one cover to another, but I could not be sure.  For the most part I skirted the wood, making occasional detours rather than enter those forbidding depths of gloom, though many times I was forced to pass through arms of the forest which extended to the very shore of the inland sea.  There was so sinister a suggestion in the uncouth sounds and the vague glimpses of moving things within the forest, of the menace of strange beasts and possibly still stranger men, that I always breathed more freely when I had passed once more into open country.  I had traveled northward for perhaps an hour, still haunted by the conviction that I was being stalked by some creature which kept always hidden among the trees and shrubbery to my right and a little to my rear, when for the hundredth time I was attracted by a sound from that direction, and turning, saw some animal running rapidly through the forest toward me.  There was no longer any effort on its part at concealment; it came on through the underbrush swiftly, and I was confident that whatever it was, it had finally gathered the courage to charge me boldly.  Before it finally broke into plain view, I became aware that it was not alone, for a few yards in its rear a second thing thrashed through the leafy jungle.  Evidently I was to be attacked in force by a pair of hunting beasts or men.  And then through the last clump of waving ferns broke the figure of the foremost creature, which came leaping toward me on light feet as I stood with my rifle to my shoulder covering the point at which I had expected it would emerge.  I must have looked foolish indeed if my surprise and consternation were in any way reflected upon my countenance as I lowered my rifle and gazed incredulous at the lithe figure of the girl speeding swiftly in my direction.  But I"]]]
