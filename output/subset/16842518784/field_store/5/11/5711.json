Sec. 93.)_  _\"It is impossible for a man to be saved in Ignorance.\" (Doc. and Cov. Sec. 131.)_  _\"Whatever principles of intelligence we attain unto in this life, it will rise with us in the resurrection.\" (Doc. and Cov. Sec. 130.)_  _\"If a person gains more knowledge and intelligence in this life through his diligence and obedience than another, he will have so much the advantage in the world to come.\" (Doc. and Cov. Sec. 130.)_  _\"A man is saved no faster than he gets knowledge, for if he does not get knowledge, he will be brought into captivity by some evil power in the other world, as evil spirits will have more knowledge, and consequently more power, than many men who are on the earth.\" (Joseph Smith--History of the Church, Vol. IV., p. 588.)_  _\"Knowledge saves a man; and in the world of spirits no man can be exalted but by knowledge; so long as a man will not give heed to the commandments he must abide without salvation. If a man has knowledge he can be saved; although he has been guilty of great sins, he will be punished for them. But when he consents to obey the Gospel, whether here or in the world of Spirits, he is saved.\" (Joseph Smith--Minutes of the General Conference of the Church, April, 1844. \"Improvement Era,\" Jan., 1909, p. 186.)_  _\"Seek ye diligently and teach one another words of wisdom; yea, seek ye out of the best books words of wisdom: seek learning even by study, and also by faith.\" (Doc. and Cov. Sec. 88:118.)_  _\"I give unto you a commandment, that you teach one another the doctrine of the Kingdom.\"_  _\"Teach ye diligently and my grace shall attend you, that you may be instructed more perfectly in theory, in principle, in doctrine, in the law of the gospel, in all things that pertain unto the kingdom of God, that are expedient for you to understand;_  _\"Of things both in heaven and in the earth, and under the earth; things which have been, things which are, things which must shortly come to pass; things which are at home, things which are abroad; the wars and the perplexities of the nations, and the judgments which are on the land, and a knowledge also of countries and of kingdoms,_  _\"That ye may be prepared in all things when I shall send you again to magnify the calling whereunto I have called you, and the mission with which I have commissioned you.\" (Doc. and Cov. Sec. 88:79-90.)_  _\"It is important that we should understand the reasons and causes of our exposure to the vicissitudes of life and of death, and the designs and purposes of God in our coming into the world, our sufferings here, and our departure hence. What is the object of our coming into existence, then dying and falling away, to be here no more? It is but reasonable to suppose that God would reveal something in reference to the matter, and it is a subject we ought to study more than any other. We ought to study it day and night, for the world is ignorant in reference to their true condition and relation. If we have any claim on our Heavenly Father for anything, it is for knowledge on this important subject.\" (Joseph Smith--History of the Church, Vol. VI., p. 50.)_  _\"God shall give unto you (the saints) knowledge by his Holy Spirit, yea by the unspeakable gift of the Holy Ghost, that has not been revealed since the world was until now: which our forefathers have waited with anxious expectation to be revealed in the last times, which their minds were pointed to, by the angels, as held in reserve for the fullness of their glory; a time to come in the which nothing shall be withheld, whether there be one God or many Gods, they shall be manifest; all thrones and dominions, principalities and powers, shall be revealed and set forth upon all who have endured valiantly for the gospel of Jesus Christ; and also if there be bounds set to the heavens, or to the seas; or to the dry land, or to the sun, moon, or stars; all the times of their revolutions; all the appointed days, months, and years, and all the days of their days, months, and years, and all their glories, laws, and set times, shall be revealed, in the days of the dispensation of the fulness of times, according to that which was ordained in the midst of the Council of the Eternal God of all other Gods, before this world was, that should be reserved unto the finishing and the end thereof, when every man shell enter into his eternal presence, and into his immortal rest. How long can rolling waters remain impure? What power shall stay the heavens? As well might man stretch forth his puny arm to stop the Missouri river in its decreed course, or to turn it up stream, as to hinder the Almighty from pouring down knowledge from heaven, upon the heads of the Latter-day Saints\" (Doc. and Cov. Sec. 121, 26-33.)_  VII. NECESSARY ATTITUDE OF THE CHURCH IN THE MATTER OF MENTAL ACTIVITY AND INTELLECTUAL DEVELOPMENT.  Surely, in the presence of this array of incentives, instructions and commandments to seek for knowledge, taken from the revelations and other forms of instruction by the Prophet of the New Dispensation--taking into account also the scope of the field of knowledge we are both persuaded and commanded to enter--whatever position other churches and their religious teachers may take, the Church of Jesus Christ in the New Dispensation can do no other than to stand for mental activity, and earnest effort to come to a knowledge of truth up to the very limit of man's capacity to find it, and the goodness and wisdom of God to reveal it.  The New Dispensation having opened with such a wonderful revelation respecting God, making known as the very first step in that revealed knowledge not only the _being_ of God but the _kind_ of beings both the Father and the Son are--its representatives may not now attempt to arrest the march of inquiry and plead \"mystery\" or \"humility\" or \"reverence\" as a bar to entrance into those very fields of knowledge God has commanded us to enter, and reap in, and of which he gives us assurance that our harvest shall be abundant.  VIII. THE LIMITS OF OUR INQUIRIES.  Let me not be misunderstood. Again I say, I am aware that there are limits to man's capacity to understand things that are. That God also in his wisdom has not yet revealed all things, especially respecting the Godhead; and that where his revelations have not yet cast their rays of light on such subjects, it is becoming in man to wait upon the Lord, for that \"line upon line, and precept upon precept\" method by which he, in great wisdom, unfolds in the procession of the ages the otherwise hidden treasures of his truths. All this I agree to; but all this does not prevent us from a close perusal and careful study of what God has revealed upon any subject, especially when that study is perused reverently, with constant remembrance of human limitations, and with an open mind, which ever stands ready to correct the tentative conclusions of today by the increased light that may be shed upon the subject on the morrow. Which holds as greater than all theories and computations the facts--the truth. These are the principles by which I have sought to be guided in these five Year Books of the Seventy's Course in Theology, and in some more than in the one herewith presented.  But some would protest against investigation lest it threaten the integrity of accepted formulas of truth--which too often they confound with the truth itself, regarding the scaffolding and the building as one and the same thing. The effective answer to that may be given in the words of Sir Oliver Lodge: \"A faith dependent on blinkers and fetters for its maintenance is not likely in a progressive age to last many generations.(Science and Immortality, p. 130.) \"From age to age, our knowledge is growing from more to more,\" remarks John Fiske, in his \"Century of Science.\" \"By this enlarged experience our minds are affected from day to day and from year to year, in more ways than we can detect or enumerate. It opens our minds to some notions, and makes them incurably hostile to others; so that, for example, new truths well nigh beyond comprehension, like some of those connected with the luminiferous ether are accepted, and old beliefs once universal like witchcraft, are scornfully rejected. Vast changes in mental attitude are thus wrought before it is generally realized.\" (\"Century of Science,\" p. 145.) This holds good in theology as in science. Not that the universal and fundamental truths in theology which God has revealed change, but that men's method of viewing them and expounding them changes, and, let us hope, changes for the better, for the more clear and perfect understanding and development of them--else there would be no progress in theology--while in all things else there is progress. But here let me conclude Fiske's noble passage:  \"In this inevitable struggle [between vanishing old ideas and incoming new ones] there has always been more or less pain, and hence free thought has not usually been popular. It has come to our life-feast as a guest unbidden and unwelcome; but it has come to stay with us, and already proves more genial than was expected. Deadening, cramping finality has lost its\" charm for him who has tasted of the ripe fruit of the tree of knowledge. In this broad universe of God's wisdom and love, not leashes to restrain us are needed, but wings to sustain our flight. Let bold but reverent thought go on and probe creation's mysteries, till faith and knowledge \"make one music as before, but vaster.\"  IX. THE RIGHT TO SEEK KNOWLEDGE ASIDE FROM REVEALED"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/60492"],["title","The Seventy's Course in Theology, Fifth Year (#2)"],["body","NOWLEDGE.  One other thing: Such subjects as are treated in this Year Book necessarily rest on what God has revealed--that is, for the data, the facts involved; but that does not necessarily hold as to illustration and argument for development of the truth and making clear the revealed things of God. Here one may do as it is said Clement of Alexandrea did in urging men to strive for a knowledge of Christian truth, rather than a mere belief of it; \"such instruction was to come primarily from the 'Divine Word'; but everything in the range of human learning was to be welcomed as co-operating with him. For Clement gratefully acknowledged truth wherever found, whether among heathens or heretics.\" It should be observed, however, \"that while constantly confirming his propositions from his Greek writers, he ever turns for a final appeal to the scriptures\"--that, too, must be our course.  So much by way of presenting the spirit in which I have pursued my own studies upon the high themes of these Seventy's Year Books, and this present one in particular.  X. JUSTIFICATION FOR USING DOUBLE TITLE.  The subject of Divine Immanence and the Holy Ghost should be considered together because there are such relations and apparent contrasts subsisting between them--such a likeness and such apparent differences, that they may properly be understood only when so considered--that is, conjointly.  The conception of God immanent in the world, not in bodily presence, of course, but by his spirit--a divine power, carrying with it everywhere the influence of God--proceeding forth from the presence of God to fill the immensity of space; the light which lighteth every man that cometh into the world--to which all men have access whether following the light of nature or of revelation, the light which is in all things and the power by which all things are sustained and in which they live and move and have their being--this conception, with the conception of the Holy Ghost as a Spirit-personage, union with whom and companionship with whom can only be secured by obedience to the laws and ordinances of the Gospel, is a conception that will correct some errors of argumentation that have here and there obtained in the literature of the subject, and leads to an understanding of things at once rational and uplifting, because it is a development of the truth as God has revealed it. This is the purpose of the treatise--The Divine Immanence, and the Holy Ghost.  WORKS OF REFERENCE.  Relative to works of reference I would remind the student that outside of the scriptures accepted by the Church the works that may be cited to assist one in studying the subject of this treatise are very scarce, since the doctrine of the Church on the subject is so radically different from that of the world. I can therefore only recommend as helpful the following brief list.  The Seventy's Library, viz.:  _The Bible,_  _The Book of Mormon,_  _The Doctrine and Covenants,_  _The Pearl of Great Price,_ containing the _Book of Moses,_ the _Book of Abraham,_ and some of the _Writings of Joseph Smith._  The above books are certainly indispensable to every Seventy, and should be owned by every member of our quorums. The First Council in their recommendations, added to the above list, _\"Richards and Little's Compendium of the Doctrines of the Gospel,\"_ and called the set the \"Seventy's Indispensable Library.\"  Elder James E. Talmage's _Articles of Faith,_  Orson Pratt's Works--_Kingdom of God._  _Rays of Living Light,_ by President Charles W. Penrose.  _Scientific Aspects of Mormonism,_ N. L. Nelson.  _The Gospel,_ Roberts.  _The Mormon Doctrine of Deity,_ Roberts.  The Seventy's Year Books, a complete set. There is constant reference made in the present number to previous numbers; and the student who is not in possession of those numbers is by so much deprived of the opportunity to complete his inquiry on the division of the subject he may have in hand, and as this number completes at present the set of Seventy's Year Books, each member of the respective quorums, we think, should be anxious to obtain the complete set.  After enumerating the above books, published by writers in the Church, I suggest as in a way helpful to an understanding of the trend of modern thinking, somewhat along the lines of spiritual and scientific thought with which the Seventies of the Church ought to be acquainted, the following:  _Natural Law in the Spiritual World,_ Henry Drummond, 1893.  _Studies in Religion,_ Fiske.  _A Century of Science,_ Fiske.  _Reconstruction of Religious Beliefs,_ Mallock.  _The Religious Conceptions of the World,_ Rogers.  _Science and Immortality,_ Sir Oliver Lodge.  All the books enumerated in the above list of works of reference may be obtained at the Deseret Sunday School Union Book Store, Salt Lake City.    The Seventy's Course in Theology.  FIFTH YEAR    PART I  Divine Immanence.    LESSON I.  (Scripture Reading Exercise.)  IMMANENCE OF GOD.  ANALYSIS.  I. Definition of \"Immanent.\"  II. Distinction Between \"Omnipresence\" and \"Immanence.\"  III. Revelation commits the Church to the Doctrine of Divine Immanence.  REFERENCES.  Any of the standard dictionaries.  The Scripture passages cited in the \"Discussion\" of this lesson.  _SPECIAL TEXT: \"The Light which now shineth, which giveth you light, is through him who enlighteneth your eyes, which is the same light that quickeneth your understandings; which Light proceedeth forth from the presence of God to fill the immensity of space.\" (Doc. and Cov. Sec. lxxxviii:11, 12.)_  DISCUSSION.  _1. Definition of Immanent:_ The word \"Immanent\" means \"indwelling,\" \"remaining within;\" \"opposed to transient,\" or \"transitive.\"[A] Such the definition of the adjective. The noun, \"Immanence,\" is defined as \"the state of being immanent,\" \"a permanent abiding within\"--\"indwelling.\"[B] As applied to God it conveys the idea of essential and permanent Divine presence in all the universe. It excludes the idea of movement or transition from one place to another in order for the Deity to be at a given place, since immanence conveys the idea of Divine presence being already and constantly at every point in the universe; hence movement conceived as necessary to presence is not essential, but is excluded from the conception of immanence.  [Footnote A: The Standard Dictionary, Funk and Wagnalls.]  [Footnote B: See both Standard and Century Dictionaries.]  _2. Distinction Between Omnipresence and Immanence:_ It may be thought that \"immanence\" is but the restatement in another form, of the attribute of omnipresence in Deity--simply an affirmation of his every-whereness; and it must be admitted that there is at least a close resemblance if not identity between the two things for which the two terms stand. And yet there is a difference between immanence and omnipresence. The latter means merely the every-whereness of God, \"present in all places and at the same time.\"[A]  [Footnote A: Century Dictionary.]  Immanence means that, too; but it means more than that. It means _presence accompanied by power_; or presence plus power; presence accompanied by doing, or act, leading to manifestations of God's power. In modern philosophy the word is applied to the operations of a Creator conceived of as in organic connection with the creation;[A] and we shall see presently that this is as true in theology as it is in philosophy.  [Footnote A: Century Dictionary. Joseph Le Conte, Professor of Geology and Natural History in the University of California, discussing what belief in God would be for rational philosophy, says: \"It is the belief in a God not far away beyond our reach, who once long ago enacted laws and created forces which continue of themselves to run the machine we call nature, but a God immanent, a God resident in Nature, at all times and in all places directing every event and determining every phenomenon; a God in whom in the most literal sense not only we but all things have their being, in whom all things consist, through whom all things exist, and without whom there would be and could be nothing. According to this view the phenomena of Nature are naught else than objectified modes of divine thought, the forces of Nature naught else than different forms of one omnipresent, divine energy or will; the laws of Nature naught else than the regular modes of operation of that divine will, invariable because he is unchangeable. According to this view the law of gravitation is naught else than the mode of operation of the divine energy in sustaining the cosmos--the divine method of sustentation.\" (\"Evolution and Its Relation to Religious Thought\"--1902--pp. 300, 301.)]  _3. Does Revelation Teach Immanence of God:_ Here we may as well consider the question whether or not the scriptures teach the doctrine of immanence as defined above. Of the doctrine of God's omnipresence there can be no question at all. David states it beautifully:  \"Whither shall I go from thy spirit, or whither shall I flee from thy presence? If I ascend up into heaven thou art there: if I make my bed in hell, behold, thou art there. If I take the wings of the morning and dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea; even there shall thy hand lead me, and thy right hand shall hold me. If I say surely the darkness shall cover me; even the night shall be light about me. Yea the darkness hideth not from thee; but the night shineth as the day: the darkness and the light are both alike to thee.\"[A]  [Footnote A: Psalms cxxxix:7-12.]  Jeremiah is equally as clear in a statement of the same truth, even if less poetical:  \"Can any hide himself in secret places that I shall not see him? saith the Lord. Do not I fill heaven and earth? saith the Lord.\"[A]  [Footnote A: Jeremiah xxiii:24.]  Solomon said of God:  \"The heaven, and heaven of heavens cannot contain thee, how much less this house that I have builded?\"[A]  [Footnote A: I Kings viii:27.]  Paul declares that God is \"not far from every one of us; for in"]]]
