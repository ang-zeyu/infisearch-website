[The ala miliaria consisted of 24 'turmae' or 960 mounted troopers      under the conduct of a Prefect.]  Gorgo had never at any time ceased to think of him, but her passion had constantly appeared to her in the light of treason and a breach of faith towards the gods, so, to condone the sins she committed on one side by zeal on another, she had come forth from the privacy of her father's house to give active support to Olympius in his struggle for the faith of their ancestors.  She had become a daily worshipper at the temple of Isis, and the hope of hearing her sing had already mere than once filled it to overflowing at high festivals.  Then, while Olympius was defending the sanctuary of Serapis against the attacks of the Christians, she and her grandmother had become the leaders of a party of women who made it their task to provide the champions of the faith with the means of subsistence.  All this had given purpose to her life; still, every little victory in this contest had filled her soul with regrets and anxieties.  For months and years she had been conspicuous as the opponent of her lover's creed, and the bright eager child had developed into a grave girl a clear-headed and resolute woman.  She was the only person in the house who dared to contradict her grandmother, and to insist on a thing when she thought it right.  The longing of her heart she could not still, but her high spirit found food for its needs in all that surrounded her, and, by degrees, would no doubt have gained the mastery and have been supreme in all her being and doing, but that music and song still fostered the softer emotions of her strong, womanly nature.  The news of Constantine's return had shaken her soul to the foundations. Would it bring her the greatest happiness or only fresh anguish and unrest?  She saw him coming!--The plume of his helmet first came in sight above the bushes, and then his whole figure emerged from among the shrubbery. She leaned against the pillar for support now, for her knees trembled under her.  Tall and stately, his armor blazing in the sunshine, he came straight towards her--a man, a hero--exactly as her fancy had painted him in many a dark and sleepless hour.  As he passed her mother's tomb, she felt as though a cold hand laid a grip on her beating heart.  In a swift flash of thought she saw her own home with its wealth and splendor, and then the ship-builder's house-simple, chillingly bare, with its comfortless rooms; she felt as though she must perish, nipped and withered, in such a home.  Again she thought of him standing on his father's threshold, she fancied she could hear his bright boyish laugh and her heart glowed once more.  She forgot for the moment--clear-headed woman though she was, and trained by her philosopher to \"know herself\"-- she forgot what she had fully acknowledged only the night before: That he would no more give up his Christ than she would her Isis, and that if they should ever reach the dreamed-of pinnacle of joy it must be for an instant only, followed by a weary length of misery.  Yes--she forgot everything; doubts and fears were cast aside; as his approaching footsteps fell on her ear, she could hardly keep herself from flying, open armed, to meet him.  He was standing before her; she offered him her hand with frank gladness, and, as he clasped it in his, their hearts were too full for words. Only their eyes gave utterance to their feelings, and when he perceived that hers were sparkling through tears, he spoke her name once, twice-- joyfully and yet doubtfully, as if he dared not interpret her emotion as he would.  She laid her left hand lightly on his which still grasped her right, and said with a brilliant smile: \"Welcome, Constantine, welcome home!  How glad I am to see you back again!\"  \"And I--and  I...\"  he began, greatly moved.   \"O Gorgo!  Can it really be years since we parted?\"  \"Yes, indeed,\" she said.  \"Anxious, busy, struggling years!\"  \"But to-day we celebrate the festival of Peace,\" he exclaimed fervently. \"I have learnt to leave every man to go his own way so long as I am allowed to go mine.  The old strife is buried; take me as I am and I, for my part, will think only of the noble and beautiful traits in which your nature is so rich.  The fruit of all wholesome strife must be peace; let us pluck that fruit, Gorgo, and enjoy it together.  Ah! as I stand here and gaze out over the gardens and the lake, hearing the hammers of the shipwrights, and rejoicing in your presence, I feel as though our childhood might begin all over again--only better, fuller and more beautiful!\"  \"If only my brothers were here!\"  \"I saw them,\"  \"Oh! where?\"  \"At Thessalonica, well and happy--I have letters for you from them.\"  \"Letters!\"  cried Gorgo, drawing away her hand.  \"Well, you are a tardy messenger!  Our houses are within a stone's throw, and yet in a whole day, from noon till noon, so old a friend could not find a few minutes to deliver the letters entrusted to him, or to call upon such near neighbors . . .\"  \"First there  were my  parents,\" interrupted the young soldier. \"And then the tyrant military duty, which kept me on the stretch from yesterday afternoon till an hour or two since.  Romanus robbed me even of my sleep, and kept me in attendance till the morn had set.  However, I lost but little by that, for I could not have closed my eyes till they had beheld you!  This morning again I was on duty, and rarely have I ridden to the front with such reluctance.  After that I was delayed by various details; even on my way here--but for that I cannot be sorry for it gave me this chance of finding you alone.  All I ask now is that we may remain so, for such a moment is not likely to be repeated.--There, I heard a door . . .\"  \"Come into the garden,\" cried Gorgo, signing to him to follow her. \"My heart is as full as yours.  Down by the tank under the old sycamores --we shall be quietest there.\"  Under the dense shade of the centenarian trees was a rough-hewn bench that they themselves had made years before; there Gorgo seated herself, but her companion remained standing.  \"Yes!\"  he exclaimed.  \"Here--here you must hear me!  Here where we have been so happy together!\"  \"So happy!\"  she echoed softly,  \"And now,\" he went on, \"we are together once more.  My heart beats wildly, Gorgo; it is well that this breastplate holds it fast, for I feel as though it would burst with hope and thankfulness.\"  \"Thankfulness?\"  said Gorgo, looking down.  \"Yes, thankfulness--sheer, fervent passionate gratitude!  What you have given me, what an inestimable boon, you yourself hardly know; but no emperor could reward love and fidelity more lavishly than you have done-- you, the care and the consolation, the pain and the joy of my life!  My mother told me--it was the first thing she thought of--how you shed tears of grief on her bosom when the false report of my death reached home. Those tears fell as morning dew on the drooping hopes in my heart, they were a welcome such as few travellers find on their return home.  I am no orator, and if I were, how could speech in any way express my feelings? But you know them--you understand what it is, after so many years . . .\"  \"I know,\" she said looking up into his eyes, and allowing him to seize her hand as he dropped on the bench by her side.  \"If I did not I could not bear this--and I freely confess that I shed many more tears over you than you could imagine.  You love me, Constantine .  .  .\"  He threw his arm round her; but she disengaged herself, exclaiming:  \"Nay--I implore you, not so--not yet, till I have told you what troubles me, what keeps me from throwing myself wholly, freely into the arms of happiness.  I know what you will ask--what you have a right to ask; but before you speak, Constantine, remember once more all that has so often saddened our life, even as children, that has torn us asunder like a whirlwind although, ever since we can remember, our hearts have flowed towards each other.  But I need not remind you of what binds us--that we both know well, only too well...\"  \"Nay,\" he replied boldly:  \"That we are only beginning to know in all its fullness and rapture.  The other thing  the whirlwind of which you speak, has indeed tossed and tormented me, more than it has you perhaps; but since I have known that you could shed tears for me and love me I have had no more anxieties; I know for certain that all must come right!  You love me as I am, Gorgo.  I am no dreamer nor poet; but I can look forward to finding life lovely and noble if shared with you, so long as one--only one thing is sure.  I ask you plainly and truly: Is your heart as full of love for me as mine is for you?  When I was away did you think of me every day, every night, as I thought of you, day and night without fail?\"  Gorgo's head sank and blushes dyed her cheeks as she replied: \"I love you, and I have never even thought of any one else.  My thoughts and yearnings followed you all the while you were away...  and yet...  oh, Constantine!  That one thing . . .\"  \"It cannot part us,\" said the young man passionately, \"since we have love--the mighty and gracious power which conquers all things!  When love beckon: the whirlwind dies away like the breath from a child's lips; it can bridge over any abyss; it created the world and preserves the existence of humanity, it can remove mountains--and these are the most beautiful words of the greatest of the apostles: 'It is long suffering and kind, it believes all things, hopes all things' and it knows no end. It remains with us till death and will teach us to find that peace whose bulwark and adornment, whose child and parent it is!\"  Gorgo had looked lovingly at him while he spoke, and he, pressing her hand to his lips went on with ardent feeling:  \"Yes, you shall be mine--I dare, and I will go "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5503"],["title","Serapis â€” Volume 03 (#2)"],["body","ask you of your father. There are some words spoken in one's life which can never be forgotten. Once your father said that he wished that I was his son.  On the march, in camp, in battle, wherever I have wandered, those words have been in my mind; for me they could have but one meaning: I would be his son--I shall be his son when Gorgo is my wife!--And now the time has come . . .\"  \"Not yet, not to-day,\" she interrupted eagerly.  \"My hopes are the same as yours.  I believe with you that our love can bring all that is sweetest into our lives.  What you believe I must believe, and I will never urge upon you the things that I regard as holiest.  I can give up much, bear much, and it will all seem easy for your sake.  We can agree, and settle what shall be conceded to your Christ and what to our gods-- but not to-day; not even to-morrow.  For the present let me first carry out the task I have undertaken--when that is done and past, then...  You have my heart, my love; but if I were to prove a deserter from the cause to-day or to-morrow it would give others--Olympius--a right to point at me with scorn.\"  \"What is it then that you have undertaken?\"  asked Constantine with grave anxiety.  \"To crown and close my past life.  Before I can say: I am yours, wholly yours . . .\"  \"Are you not mine now, to-day, at  once?\"  he urged.  \"To day-no,\" she replied firmly.  \"The great cause still has a claim upon me; the cause which I must renounce for your sake.  But the woman who gives only one person reason to despise her signs the death-warrant of her own dignity.  I will carry out what I have undertaken...  Do not ask me what it is; it would grieve you to know.--The day after tomorrow, when the feast of Isis is over . . .\"  \"Gorgo, Gorgo!\"  shouted Damia's shrill voice, interrupting the young girl in her speech, and half a dozen slave-women came rushing out in search of her.  They rose, and as they went towards the house Constantine said very earnestly:  \"I will not insist; but trust my experience: When we have to give something up sooner or later, if the wrench is a painful one, the sooner and the more definitely it is done the better.  Nothing is gained by postponement and the pain is only prolonged.  Hesitation and delay, Gorgo, are a barrier built up by your own hand between us and our happiness.  You always had abundance of determination; be brave then, now, and cut short at once a state of things that cannot last.\"  \"Well, well,\" she said hurriedly.  \"But you must not, you will not require me to do anything that is beyond my strength, or that would involve breaking my word.  To-morrow is not, and cannot be yours; it must be a day of leave-taking and parting.  After that I am yours, I cannot live without you.  I want you and nothing else.  Your happiness shall be mine; only, do not make it too hard to me to part from all that has been dear to me from my infancy.  Shut your eyes to tomorrow's proceedings, and then--oh! if only we were sure of the right path, if only we could tread it together!  We know each other so perfectly, and I know, I feel, that it will perhaps be a comfort to our hearts to be patient with each other over matters which our judgment fails to comprehend or even to approve.  I might be so unutterably happy; but my heart trembles within me, and I am not, I dare not be quite glad yet.\"     CHAPTER XII.  The young soldier was heartily welcomed by his friends of the merchant's family; but old Damia was a little uneasy at the attitude which he and Gorgo had taken up after their first greeting.  He was agitated and grave, she was eager and excited, with an air of determined enterprise.  Was Eros at the bottom of it all?  Were the young people going to carry out the jest of their childhood in sober earnest?  The young officer was handsome and attractive enough, and her granddaughter after all was but a woman.  So far as Constantine was concerned the old lady had no personal objection to him; nay, she appreciated his steady, grave manliness and, for his own sake, was very glad to see him once more; but to contemplate the ship-builder's son--the grandson of a freedman--a Christian and devoted to the Emperor, even though he were a prefect or of even higher grade--as a possible suitor for her Gorgo, the beautiful heiress of the greater part of her wealth--the centre of attraction to all the gilded youth of Alexandria--this was too much for her philosophy; and, as she had never in her life restrained the expression of her sentiments, though she gave him a friendly hand and the usual greeting, she very soon showed him, by her irony and impertinence, that she was as hostile to his creed as ever.  She put her word in on every subject, and when, presently, Demetrius-- who, after Dada's rebuff, had come on to see his uncle--began speaking of the horses he had been breeding for Marcus, and Constantine enquired whether any Arabs from his stables were to be purchased in the town, Damia broke out:  \"You out-do your crucified God in most things I observe!  He could ride on an ass, and a stout Egyptian nag is not good enough for you.\"  However, the young officer was not to be provoked; and though he was very well able to hold his own in a strife of words, he kept himself under control and pretended to see nothing in the old woman's taunts but harmless jesting.  Gorgo triumphed in his temperate demeanor, and thanked him with grateful glances and a silent grasp of the hand when opportunity offered.  Demetrius, who had also known Constantine as a boy, and who, through Porphyrius, had sold him his first charger, met him very warmly and told him with a laugh that he had seen him before that day, that he had evidently learnt something on his travels, that he had tracked the prettiest head of game in all the city; and he slapped him on the shoulder and gave him what he meant to be a very knowing glance. Constantine could not think where Demetrius had seen him or what he meant; while Gorgo supposed that he alluded to her, and thought him perfectly odious.  Porphyrius pelted the prefect with questions which Constantine was very ready to answer, till they were interrupted by some commotion in the garden.  On looking out they saw a strange and unpleasing procession, headed by Herse who was scolding, thumping and dragging Dada's Egyptian slave, while her husband followed, imploring her to moderate her fury. Behind them came Orpheus, now and then throwing out a persuasive word to soothe the indignant matron.  This party soon came up with the others, and Herse, unasked, poured out an explanation of her wrath.  She had had but a brief interview with Mary, Marcus' mother, for she had positively opposed the Christian lady's suggestion that Karnis and his family would do well to quit Alexandria as soon as possible, accepting an indemnification from Mary herself.  To the widow's threats of seeking the intervention of the law, she had retorted that they were not public singers but free citizens who performed for their own enjoyment; to the anxious mother's complaints that Dada was doing all she could to attract Marcus, she had answered promptly and to the point that her niece's good name would certainly out-weigh anything that could be said against a young man to whom so much license was allowed in Alexandria.  She would find some means of protecting her own sister's child.  Mary had replied that Herse would do well to remember that she--Mary--had means at her command of bringing justice down on those who should attempt to entrap a Christian youth, and tempt him into the path of sin.  This had closed the interview.  Herse had found her husband and son waiting for her at the door of Mary's house and had at once returned with them to the ship.  There an unpleasant surprise awaited them; they had found no one on board but the Egyptian slave, who told them that Dada had sent her on shore to procure her some sandals; on her return the girl had vanished.  The woman at the same time declared that she had seen Agne and her brother leave the garden and make for the high-road.  So far as the Christian girl was concerned Herse declared there would be no difficulty; but Dada, her own niece, had always clung to them faithfully, and though Alexandria was full of sorcerers and Magians they could hardly succeed in making away with a fullgrown, rational, and healthy girl.  In her inexperience she had, no doubt, gone at the bidding of some perfidious wretch, and the Egyptian witch, the brown slave had, of course, had a finger in the trick.  She would accuse no one, but she knew some people who would be only too glad if Dada and that baby-faced young Christian got into trouble and disgrace together.  She delivered herself of this long story with tears of rage and regret, angrily refusing to admit any qualifying parentheses from her husband, to whose natural delicacy her rough and vociferous complaints were offensive in the presence of the high-bred ladies of the house.  Old Damia, however, had listened attentively to her indignant torrent of words, and had only shrugged her shoulders with a scornful smile at the implied accusation of herself.  Porphyrius, to whom the whole business was simply revolting, questioned Herse closely and when the facts were clearly established, and it also was plainly proved that Agne had escaped from the garden, he desired the slave-woman to tell her story of all that had occurred during the absence of Karnis, promising her half a dozen stripes from the cane on the soles of her feet for every false word she might utter.  The threat was enough to raise a howl from the Egyptian; but this Porphyries soon put a stop to, and Sachepris, with perfect veracity, told her tale of all that had happened till Herse's return to the vessel.  The beginning of the narrative was of no special interest, but when she was pressed to go faster to the point she went on to say:  \"And then--then my lord Constantine came to us on the ship, and the pretty"]]]
