Though Egypt has greatly changed during the past generation, away from Cairo and the commercial centres the wheels of social progress have turned but slowly, and much remains as it was in the days of which this book is a record in the spirit of the life, at least.                         G. P.        “Dost thou spread the sail, throw the spear, swing the axe, lay      thy hand upon the plough, attend the furnace door, shepherd the      sheep upon the hills, gather corn from the field, or smite the      rock in the quarry? Yet, whatever thy task, thou art even as      one who twists the thread and throws the shuttle, weaving the      web of Life. Ye are all weavers, and Allah the Merciful, does      He not watch beside the loom?”     CHAPTER I. AS THE SPIRIT MOVED  The village lay in a valley which had been the bed of a great river in the far-off days when Ireland, Wales and Brittany were joined together and the Thames flowed into the Seine. The place had never known turmoil or stir. For generations it had lived serenely.  Three buildings in the village stood out insistently, more by the authority of their appearance and position than by their size. One was a square, red-brick mansion in the centre of the village, surrounded by a high, redbrick wall enclosing a garden. Another was a big, low, graceful building with wings. It had once been a monastery. It was covered with ivy, which grew thick and hungry upon it, and it was called the Cloistered House. The last of the three was of wood, and of no great size--a severely plain but dignified structure, looking like some council-hall of a past era. Its heavy oak doors and windows with diamond panes, and its air of order, cleanliness and serenity, gave it a commanding influence in the picture. It was the key to the history of the village--a Quaker Meeting-house.  Involuntarily the village had built itself in such a way that it made a wide avenue from the common at one end to the Meeting-house on the gorse-grown upland at the other. With a demure resistance to the will of its makers the village had made itself decorative. The people were unconscious of any attractiveness in themselves or in their village. There were, however, a few who felt the beauty stirring around them. These few, for their knowledge and for the pleasure which it brought, paid the accustomed price. The records of their lives were the only notable history of the place since the days when their forefathers suffered for the faith.  One of these was a girl--for she was still but a child when she died; and she had lived in the Red Mansion with the tall porch, the wide garden behind, and the wall of apricots and peaches and clustering grapes. Her story was not to cease when she was laid away in the stiff graveyard behind the Meeting-house. It was to go on in the life of her son, whom to bring into the world she had suffered undeserved, and loved with a passion more in keeping with the beauty of the vale in which she lived than with the piety found on the high-backed seats in the Quaker Meeting-house. The name given her on the register of death was Mercy Claridge, and a line beneath said that she was the daughter of Luke Claridge, that her age at passing was nineteen years, and that “her soul was with the Lord.”  Another whose life had given pages to the village history was one of noble birth, the Earl of Eglington. He had died twenty years after the time when Luke Claridge, against the then custom of the Quakers, set up a tombstone to Mercy Claridge’s memory behind the Meeting-house. Only thrice in those twenty years had he slept in a room of the Cloistered House. One of those occasions was the day on which Luke Claridge put up the grey stone in the graveyard, three years after his daughter’s death. On the night of that day these two men met face to face in the garden of the Cloistered House. It was said by a passer-by, who had involuntarily overheard, that Luke Claridge had used harsh and profane words to Lord Eglington, though he had no inkling of the subject of the bitter talk. He supposed, however, that Luke had gone to reprove the other for a wasteful and wandering existence; for desertion of that Quaker religion to which his grandfather, the third Earl of Eglington, had turned in the second half of his life, never visiting his estates in Ireland, and residing here among his new friends to his last day. This listener--John Fairley was his name--kept his own counsel. On two other occasions had Lord Eglington visited the Cloistered House in the years that passed, and remained many months. Once he brought his wife and child. The former was a cold, blue-eyed Saxon of an old family, who smiled distantly upon the Quaker village; the latter, a round-headed, warm-faced youth, with a bold, menacing eye, who probed into this and that, rushed here and there as did his father; now built a miniature mill; now experimented at some peril in the laboratory which had been arranged in the Cloistered House for scientific experiments; now shot partridges in the fields where partridges had not been shot for years; and was as little in the picture as his adventurous father, though he wore a broad-brimmed hat, smiling the while at the pain it gave to the simple folk around him.  And yet once more the owner of the Cloistered House returned alone. The blue-eyed lady was gone to her grave; the youth was abroad. This time he came to die. He was found lying on the floor of his laboratory with a broken retort in fragments beside him. With his servant, Luke Claridge was the first to look upon him lying in the wreck of his last experiment, a spirit-lamp still burning above him, in the grey light of a winter’s morning. Luke Claridge closed the eyes, straightened the body, and crossed the hands over the breast which had been the laboratory of many conflicting passions of life.  The dead man had left instructions that his body should be buried in the Quaker graveyard, but Luke Claridge and the Elders prevented that--he had no right to the privileges of a Friend; and, as the only son was afar, and no near relatives pressed the late Earl’s wishes, the ancient family tomb in Ireland received all that was left of the owner of the Cloistered House, which, with the estates in Ireland and the title, passed to the wandering son.     CHAPTER II. THE GATES OF THE WORLD  Stillness in the Meeting-house, save for the light swish of one graveyard-tree against the window-pane, and the slow breathing of the Quaker folk who filled every corner. On the long bench at the upper end of the room the Elders sat motionless, their hands on their knees, wearing their hats; the women in their poke-bonnets kept their gaze upon their laps. The heads of all save three were averted, and they were Luke Claridge, his only living daughter, called Faith, and his dead daughter’s son David, who kept his eyes fixed on the window where the twig flicked against the pane. The eyes of Faith, who sat on a bench at one side, travelled from David to her father constantly; and if, once or twice, the plain rebuke of Luke Claridge’s look compelled her eyes upon her folded hands, still she was watchful and waiting, and seemed demurely to defy the convention of unblinking silence. As time went on, others of her sex stole glances at Mercy’s son from the depths of their bonnets; and at last, after over an hour, they and all were drawn to look steadily at the young man upon whose business this Meeting of Discipline had been called. The air grew warmer and warmer, but no one became restless; all seemed as cool of face and body as the grey gowns and coats with grey steel buttons which they wore.  At last a shrill voice broke the stillness. Raising his head, one of the Elders said: “Thee will stand up, friend.” He looked at David.  With a slight gesture of relief the young man stood up. He was good to look at-clean-shaven, broad of brow, fine of figure, composed of carriage, though it was not the composure of the people by whom he was surrounded. They were dignified, he was graceful; they were consistently slow of movement, but at times his quick gestures showed that he had not been able to train his spirit to that passiveness by which he lived surrounded. Their eyes were slow and quiet, more meditative than observant; his were changeful in expression, now abstracted, now dark and shining as though some inner fire was burning. The head, too, had a habit of coming up quickly with an almost wilful gesture, and with an air which, in others, might have been called pride.  “What is thy name?” said another owl-like Elder to him.  A gentle, half-amused smile flickered at the young man’s lips for an instant, then, “David Claridge--still,” he answered.  His last word stirred the meeting. A sort of ruffle went through the atmosphere, and now every eye was fixed and inquiring. The word was ominous. He was there on his trial, and for discipline; and it was thought by all that, as many days had passed since his offence was committed, meditation and prayer should have done their work. Now, however, in the tone of his voice, as it clothed the last word, there was something of defiance. On the ear of his grandfather, Luke Claridge, it fell heavily. The old man’s lips closed tightly, he clasped his hands between his knees with apparent self-repression.  The second Elder who had spoken was he who had once heard Luke Claridge use profane words in the Cloistered House. Feeling trouble ahead, and liking the young man and his brother Elder, Luke Claridge, John Fairley sought now to take the case into his own hands.  “Thee shall never find a better name, David,” he said, “if thee live a hundred years. It hath served well in England. This thee didst do. While the young Earl of Eglington was"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6267"],["title","The Weavers: a tale of England and Egypt of fifty years ago - Complete (#2)"],["body","brought home, with noise and brawling, after his return to Parliament, thee mingled among the brawlers; and because some evil words were said of thy hat and thy apparel, thee laid about thee, bringing one to the dust, so that his life was in peril for some hours to come. Jasper Kimber was his name.”  “Were it not that the smitten man forgave thee, thee would now be in a prison cell,” shrilly piped the Elder who had asked his name.  “The fight was fair,” was the young man’s reply. “Though I am a Friend, the man was English.”  “Thee was that day a son of Belial,” rejoined the shrill Elder. “Thee did use thy hands like any heathen sailor--is it not the truth?”  “I struck the man. I punished him--why enlarge?”  “Thee is guilty?”  “I did the thing.”  “That is one charge against thee. There are others. Thee was seen to drink of spirits in a public-house at Heddington that day. Twice--thrice, like any drunken collier.”  “Twice,” was the prompt correction.  There was a moment’s pause, in which some women sighed and others folded and unfolded their hands on their laps; the men frowned.  “Thee has been a dark deceiver,” said the shrill Elder again, and with a ring of acrid triumph; “thee has hid these things from our eyes many years, but in one day thee has uncovered all. Thee--”  “Thee is charged,” interposed Elder Fairley, “with visiting a play this same day, and with seeing a dance of Spain following upon it.”  “I did not disdain the music,” said the young man drily; “the flute, of all instruments, has a mellow sound.” Suddenly his eyes darkened, he became abstracted, and gazed at the window where the twig flicked softly against the pane, and the heat of summer palpitated in the air. “It has good grace to my ear,” he added slowly.  Luke Claridge looked at him intently. He began to realize that there were forces stirring in his grandson which had no beginning in Claridge blood, and were not nurtured in the garden with the fruited wall. He was not used to problems; he had only a code, which he had rigidly kept. He had now a glimmer of something beyond code or creed.  He saw that the shrill Elder was going to speak. He intervened. “Thee is charged, David,” he said coldly, “with kissing a woman--a stranger and a wanton--where the four roads meet ‘twixt here and yonder town.” He motioned towards the hills.  “In the open day,” added the shrill Elder, a red spot burning on each withered cheek.  “The woman was comely,” said the young man, with a tone of irony, recovering an impassive look.  A strange silence fell, the women looked down; yet they seemed not so confounded as the men. After a moment they watched the young man with quicker flashes of the eye.  “The answer is shameless,” said the shrill Elder. “Thy life is that of a carnal hypocrite.”  The young man said nothing. His face had become very pale, his lips were set, and presently he sat down and folded his arms.  “Thee is guilty of all?” asked John Fairley.  His kindly eye was troubled, for he had spent numberless hours in this young man’s company, and together they had read books of travel and history, and even the plays of Shakespeare and Marlowe, though drama was anathema to the Society of Friends--they did not realize it in the life around them. That which was drama was either the visitation of God or the dark deeds of man, from which they must avert their eyes. Their own tragedies they hid beneath their grey coats and bodices; their dirty linen they never washed in public, save in the scandal such as this where the Society must intervene. Then the linen was not only washed, but duly starched, sprinkled, and ironed.  “I have answered all. Judge by my words,” said David gravely.  “Has repentance come to thee? Is it thy will to suffer that which we may decide for thy correction?” It was Elder Fairley who spoke. He was determined to control the meeting and to influence its judgment. He loved the young man.  David made no reply; he seemed lost in thought. “Let the discipline proceed--he hath an evil spirit,” said the shrill Elder.  “His childhood lacked in much,” said Elder Fairley patiently.  To most minds present the words carried home--to every woman who had a child, to every man who had lost a wife and had a motherless son. This much they knew of David’s real history, that Mercy Claridge, his mother, on a visit to the house of an uncle at Portsmouth, her mother’s brother, had eloped with and was duly married to the captain of a merchant ship. They also knew that, after some months, Luke Claridge had brought her home; and that before her child was born news came that the ship her husband sailed had gone down with all on board. They knew likewise that she had died soon after David came, and that her father, Luke Claridge, buried her in her maiden name, and brought the boy up as his son, not with his father’s name but bearing that name so long honoured in England, and even in the far places of the earth--for had not Benn Claridge, Luke’s brother, been a great carpet-merchant, traveller, and explorer in Asia Minor, Egypt, and the Soudan--Benn Claridge of the whimsical speech, the pious life? All this they knew; but none of them, to his or her knowledge, had ever seen David’s father. He was legendary; though there was full proof that the girl had been duly married. That had been laid before the Elders by Luke Claridge on an occasion when Benn Claridge, his brother was come among them again from the East.  At this moment of trial David was thinking of his uncle, Benn Claridge, and of his last words fifteen years before when going once again to the East, accompanied by the Muslim chief Ebn Ezra, who had come with him to England on the business of his country. These were Benn Claridge’s words: “Love God before all, love thy fellow-man, and thy conscience will bring thee safe home, lad.”  “If he will not repent, there is but one way,” said the shrill Elder.  “Let there be no haste,” said Luke Claridge, in a voice that shook a little in his struggle for self-control.  Another heretofore silent Elder, sitting beside John Fairley, exchanged words in a whisper with him, and then addressed them. He was a very small man with a very high stock and spreading collar, a thin face, and large wide eyes. He kept his chin down in his collar, but spoke at the ceiling like one blind, though his eyes were sharp enough on occasion. His name was Meacham.  “It is meet there shall be time for sorrow and repentance,” he said. “This, I pray you all, be our will: that for three months David live apart, even in the hut where lived the drunken chair-maker ere he disappeared and died, as rumour saith--it hath no tenant. Let it be that after to-morrow night at sunset none shall speak to him till that time be come, the first day of winter. Till that day he shall speak to no man, and shall be despised of the world, and--pray God--of himself. Upon the first day of winter let it be that he come hither again and speak with us.”  On the long stillness of assent that followed there came a voice across the room, from within a grey-and-white bonnet, which shadowed a delicate face shining with the flame of the spirit within. It was the face of Faith Claridge, the sister of the woman in the graveyard, whose soul was “with the Lord,” though she was but one year older and looked much younger than her nephew, David.  “Speak, David,” she said softly. “Speak now. Doth not the spirit move thee?”  She gave him his cue, for he had of purpose held his peace till all had been said; and he had come to say some things which had been churning in his mind too long. He caught the faint cool sarcasm in her tone, and smiled unconsciously at her last words. She, at least, must have reasons for her faith in him, must have grounds for his defence in painful days to come; for painful they must be, whether he stayed to do their will, or went into the fighting world where Quakers were few and life composite of things they never knew in Hamley.  He got to his feet and clasped his hands behind his back. After an instant he broke silence.  “All those things of which I am accused, I did; and for them is asked repentance. Before that day on which I did these things was there complaint, or cause for it? Was my life evil? Did I think in secret that which might not be done openly? Well, some things I did secretly. Ye shall hear of them. I read where I might, and after my taste, many plays, and found in them beauty and the soul of deep things. Tales I have read, but a few, and John Milton, and Chaucer, and Bacon, and Montaigne, and Arab poets also, whose books my uncle sent me. Was this sin in me?”  “It drove to a day of shame for thee,” said the shrill Elder.  He took no heed, but continued: “When I was a child I listened to the lark as it rose from the meadow; and I hid myself in the hedge that, unseen, I might hear it sing; and at night I waited till I could hear the nightingale. I have heard the river singing, and the music of the trees. At first I thought that this must be sin, since ye condemn the human voice that sings, but I could feel no guilt. I heard men and women sing upon the village green, and I sang also. I heard bands of music. One instrument seemed to me more than all the rest. I bought one like it, and learned to play. It was the flute--its note so soft and pleasant. I learned to play it--years ago--in the woods of Beedon beyond the hill, and I have felt no guilt from then till now. For these things I have no repentance.”  “Thee has had good practice in deceit,” said the shrill Elder.  Suddenly David’s manner changed. His voice became deeper; his eyes took on that look of brilliance and heat which had given Luke Claridge anxious thoughts.  “I did, indeed, as the spirit moved me, even as ye have done.”  “Blasphemer, did the spirit move thee to brawl and fight, to drink and curse, to kiss a wanton in the open road? What hath come upon thee?”  Again it was the voice of the shrill Elder.  “Judge me by the truth I speak,”"]]]
