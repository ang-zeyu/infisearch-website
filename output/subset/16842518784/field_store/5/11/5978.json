The red sunset stung him; the rocks frowned at him; the sweet wind that had been laving his face as he walked up the hill dropped--as if he wasn't fit to be kissed any more.  Was the whole world going to cast him out? Would he have to stand there forever, not knowing what to do, with the dead pigeon in his hand?  Things looked bad indeed.  Was the whole world going to make a work about a pigeon--a white pigeon?  The sun went down.  Great clouds gathered over the west, and shortened the twilight.  The wind gave a howl, and then lay down again.  The clouds gathered thicker.  Then came a rumbling.  He thought it was thunder. It was a rock that fell inside the mountain.  A goat ran past him down the hill, followed by a dog sent to fetch him home.  He thought they were goblin creatures, and trembled.  He used to despise them.  And still he held the dead pigeon tenderly in his hand.  It grew darker and darker.  An evil something began to move in his heart.  'What a fool I am!' he said to himself.  Then he grew angry, and was just going to throw the bird from him and whistle, when a brightness shone all round him.  He lifted his eyes, and saw a great globe of light--like silver at the hottest heat: he had once seen silver run from the furnace.  It shone from somewhere above the roofs of the castle: it must be the great old princess's moon!  How could she be there?  Of course she was not there!  He had asked the whole household, and nobody knew anything about her or her globe either.  It couldn't be!  And yet what did that signify, when there was the white globe shining, and here was the dead white bird in his hand?  That moment the pigeon gave a little flutter.  'It's not dead!' cried Curdie, almost with a shriek.  The same instant he was running full speed toward the castle, never letting his heels down, lest he should shake the poor, wounded bird.    CHAPTER 3  The Mistress of the Silver Moon  When Curdie reached the castle, and ran into the little garden in front of it, there stood the door wide open.  This was as he had hoped, for what could he have said if he had had to knock at it? Those whose business it is to open doors, so often mistake and shut them!  But the woman now in charge often puzzled herself greatly to account for the strange fact that however often she shut the door, which, like the rest, she took a great deal of unnecessary trouble to do, she was certain, the next time she went to it, to find it open.  I speak now of the great front door, of course: the back door she as persistently kept wide: if people could only go in by that, she said, she would then know what sort they were, and what they wanted.  But she would neither have known what sort Curdie was, nor what he wanted, and would assuredly have denied him admittance, for she knew nothing of who was in the tower.  So the front door was left open for him, and in he walked.  But where to go next he could not tell.  It was not quite dark: a dull, shineless twilight filled the place.  All he knew was that he must go up, and that proved enough for the present, for there he saw the great staircase rising before him.  When he reached the top of it, he knew there must be more stairs yet, for he could not be near the top of the tower.  Indeed by the situation of the stairs, he must be a good way from the tower itself.  But those who work well in the depths more easily understand the heights, for indeed in their true nature they are one and the same; miners are in mountains; and Curdie, from knowing the ways of the king's mines, and being able to calculate his whereabouts in them, was now able to find his way about the king's house.  He knew its outside perfectly, and now his business was to get his notion of the inside right with the outside.  So he shut his eyes and made a picture of the outside of it in his mind.  Then he came in at the door of the picture, and yet kept the picture before him all the time--for you can do that kind of thing in your mind--and took every turn of the stair over again, always watching to remember, every time he turned his face, how the tower lay, and then when he came to himself at the top where he stood, he knew exactly where it was, and walked at once in the right direction.  On his way, however, he came to another stair, and up that he went, of course, watching still at every turn how the tower must lie.  At the top of this stair was yet another--they were the stairs up which the princess ran when first, without knowing it, she was on her way to find her great-great-grandmother.  At the top of the second stair he could go no farther, and must therefore set out again to find the tower, which, as it rose far above the rest of the house, must have the last of its stairs inside itself.  Having watched every turn to the very last, he still knew quite well in what direction he must go to find it, so he left the stair and went down a passage that led, if not exactly toward it, yet nearer it.  This passage was rather dark, for it was very long, with only one window at the end, and although there were doors on both sides of it, they were all shut.  At the distant window glimmered the chill east, with a few feeble stars in it, and its like was dreary and old, growing brown, and looking as if it were thinking about the day that was just gone. Presently he turned into another passage, which also had a window at the end of it; and in at that window shone all that was left of the sunset, just a few ashes, with here and there a little touch of warmth: it was nearly as sad as the east, only there was one difference--it was very plainly thinking of tomorrow.  But at present Curdie had nothing to do with today or tomorrow; his business was with the bird, and the tower where dwelt the grand old princess to whom it belonged.  So he kept on his way, still eastward, and came to yet another passage, which brought him to a door.  He was afraid to open it without first knocking.  He knocked, but heard no answer.  He was answered nevertheless; for the door gently opened, and there was a narrow stair--and so steep that, big lad as he was, he, too, like the Princess Irene before him, found his hands needful for the climbing.  And it was a long climb, but he reached the top at last--a little landing, with a door in front and one on each side. Which should he knock at?  As he hesitated, he heard the noise of a spinning wheel.  He knew it at once, because his mother's spinning wheel had been his governess long ago, and still taught him things.  It was the spinning wheel that first taught him to make verses, and to sing, and to think whether all was right inside him; or at least it had helped him in all these things. Hence it was no wonder he should know a spinning wheel when he heard it sing--even although as the bird of paradise to other birds was the song of that wheel to the song of his mother's.  He stood listening, so entranced that he forgot to knock, and the wheel went on and on, spinning in his brain songs and tales and rhymes, till he was almost asleep as well as dreaming, for sleep does not always come first.  But suddenly came the thought of the poor bird, which had been lying motionless in his hand all the time, and that woke him up, and at once he knocked.  'Come in, Curdie,' said a voice.  Curdie shook.  It was getting rather awful.  The heart that had never much heeded an army of goblins trembled at the soft word of invitation. But then there was the red-spotted white thing in his hand!  He dared not hesitate, though.  Gently he opened the door through which the sound came, and what did he see?  Nothing at first--except indeed a great sloping shaft of moonlight that came in at a high window, and rested on the floor.  He stood and stared at it, forgetting to shut the door.  'Why don't you come in, Curdie?' said the voice.  'Did you never see moonlight before?'  'Never without a moon,' answered Curdie, in a trembling tone, but gathering courage.  'Certainly not,' returned the voice, which was thin and quavering: 'I never saw moonlight without a moon.'  'But there's no moon outside,' said Curdie.  'Ah! but you're inside now,' said the voice.  The answer did not satisfy Curdie; but the voice went on.  'There are more moons than you know of, Curdie.  Where there is one sun there are many moons--and of many sorts.  Come in and look out of my window, and you will soon satisfy yourself that there is a moon looking in at it.'  The gentleness of the voice made Curdie remember his manners.  He shut the door, and drew a step or two nearer to the moonlight.  All the time the sound of the spinning had been going on and on, and Curdie now caught sight of the wheel.  Oh, it was such a thin, delicate thing--reminding him of a spider's web in a hedge.  It stood in the middle of the moonlight, and it seemed as if the moonlight had nearly melted it away.  A step nearer, he saw, with a start, two little hands at work with it.  And then at last, in the shadow on the other side of the moonlight which came like silver between, he saw the form to which the hands belonged: a small withered creature, so old that no age would have seemed too great to write under her picture, seated on a stool beyond the spinning wheel, which looked very large beside her, but, as I said, very thin, like a long-legged spider holding up its own web, which was the round wheel itself She sat crumpled together, a filmy thing that it seemed a puff would blow away, more like the body of a fly the big spider had sucked empty and left hanging in his web, than anything else I can think of.  When Curdie saw her, he stood still again, a good deal in wonder, a very little in reverence, a little in doubt, and, I must add, a little in amusement at the odd look of the old marvel.  Her grey hair mixed with the moonlight so that he could not tell where the one began and the other ended.

It was eight o'clock when we got to the wharf, and the steamer _Manitoba_ only waited for our arrival to cast loose her moorings and enter the dark blue waters of Lake Huron. \"Haste\" will not express the excitement of the scene. Men, rushing hither and thither in search of friends, traps, and luggage, were goaded to fury by the calmness of the officials and their determination not to be hurried. Hearing there was no chance of having tea on board that night, and discovering near the wharf a signboard announcing that meals could be obtained at all hours (except, as we were told, that particular one), we with difficulty persuaded the proprietress to let us have something to eat. Amidst muttered grumblings that she was \"slaved to death,\" that \"her life was not worth a rap,\" and so on, every remark being emphasized with a plate or dish, we were at last supplied with bread, cheese, and beef-steak, for which we were kindly allowed to pay fifty cents (2s. 6d.) each.  The scene on board the boat beggars description. The other steamers being still ice-bound on Lake Superior, the _Manitoba_ was obliged to take as much freight and as many passengers as she could carry, many of the latter having been waiting in Sarnia upwards of ten days for her departure. Surveying parties, immigrants of almost every nation on their way to make homes in the great North West, crowded the decks and gangways. The confusion of tongues, the shrill cries of the frightened and tired children, the oaths of excited men, and the trundling and thumping of the baggage, mingled with the shrieks of adjacent engines \"made night hideous.\" Porters and cabmen jostled women laden with baskets of linen, brought on board at the last minute, when the poor tired stewardess had no time to administer the well-merited reprimand; passengers rushed about in search of the purser, anxious to secure their state-rooms before they were usurped by some one else.  It was midnight when the commotion had subsided, and quarters were assigned to all but a stray man or two wandering about in search of some Mr. Brown or Mr. Jones, whose room he was to share. Climbing into my berth, I soon fell asleep; but only for a few moments. The shrill whistle, the vehement ringing of the captain's bell, the heavy beat of the paddles, roused me; and as we left the wharf and steamed out from among the ships and small craft dotting the water on every side, \"Off at last!\" was shouted from the crowded decks. Then the opening bars of \"God save the Queen\" were sung heartily and not inharmoniously, followed by three cheers for her Majesty, three for her Imperial Highness, three for her popular representative Lord Dufferin, and so on, till the enthusiasm culminated in \"He's a jolly good fellow;\" the monotony of which sent me to sleep again.  At four o'clock next morning I scrambled out of my berth at the imminent risk of broken bones, wondering why the inventive powers of our Yankee neighbours had not hit upon some arrangement to facilitate the descent; dressed, and went in search of fresh air. Picking my steps quietly between sleeping forms--for men in almost every attitude, some with blankets or great-coats rolled round them, were lying on the floor and lounges in the saloon--I reached the deck just as the sun rose above the broad blue waters, brightening every moment the band of gold where sky and water met. Clouds of ink-black smoke floated from our funnel, tinged by the rising sun with every shade of yellow, red, and brown. Mirrored in the calm water below, lay the silent steamer--silent, save for the ceaseless revolution of her paddles, whose monotonous throb seemed like the beating of a great heart.  For an hour or more I revelled in the beauty of water and sky, and ceased to wonder why people born on the coast love the sea so dearly, and pine for the sight of its waves. When the men came to wash the decks, a pleasant, brawny fellow told me we were likely to have a good run up the lakes. The storms of the last few days having broken up the ice, and driven it into the open, there was hope both of the ice-locked steamers getting out, and of our getting into Duluth without much trouble--\"unless the wind changes, which is more than possible,\" he added abruptly; and walked off, as if fearful of my believing his sanguine predictions too implicitly.  Later the passengers appeared, grumbling at the cold, and at being obliged to turn out so early, and wishing breakfast were ready. Of this wished-for meal the clatter of dishes in the saloon soon gave welcome warning. Dickens says that when, before taking his first meal on board an American steamer, \"he tore after the rushing crowd to see what was wrong, dreadful visions of fire, in its most aggravated form, floated through his mind; but it was only _dinner_ that the hungry public were rushing to devour.\" We were nearly as bad on the _Manitoba_, the friendly steward warning most of us to secure our seats without delay, the cabin-walls being gradually lined with people on either side, each behind a chair. One of the \"boys\" strode ostentatiously down the long saloon, ringing a great hand-bell, which summoned a mixed multitude pell-mell to the scene of action, only to retreat in disappointment at finding the field already occupied.  It was amusing to watch the different expressions on the faces down the lines while waiting for breakfast. Men, chiefly surveyors, who during their annual trips to and from work had got used to \"that sort of thing,\" took it coolly; judiciously choosing a seat directly opposite their state-room door, or standing in the background, but near enough to expel any intruder. New men, looking as uncomfortable as if they had been caught in petty larceny, twisted their youthful moustaches, put their hands in their pockets, or leant against the wall, trying to look perfectly indifferent as to the event; some of their neighbours smiling satirically at their folly. Old farmer-looking bodies, grumbling at the crush, mingled with Yankees, toothpick in hand, ready for business; sturdy Englishmen whom one knew appreciated creature comforts; and dapper little Frenchmen, hungry yet polite. Here stood a bright-looking Irishwoman, who vainly tried to restrain the impatience of five or six children, whose faces still shone from the friction of their morning ablutions; there, an old woman, well-nigh double with age, who, rather than be separated from the two stalwart sons by her side, was going to end her days in a strange land. Here was a group of bright, chatty little French Canadians, with the usual superabundance of earrings and gay ribbons decorating their persons; there, a great raw-boned Scotchwoman, inwardly lamenting the porridge of her native land, frowned upon the company.  The bell ceased, and--\"Presto!\" all were seated, and turning over their plates as if for a wager. Then came a confused jumble of tongues, all talking at once; the rattle of dishes, the clatter of knives and forks, and the rushing about of the boy-waiters. It required quick wit to choose a breakfast dish, from the \"White-fish--finanhaddy--beefsteak--cold roastbeef--muttonchop--bacon--potatoes--toast--roll--brown-bread-or- white--tea-or-coffee,\" shouted breathlessly by a youth on one side, while his comrade screamed the same, in a shrill falsetto, to one's neighbour on the other; their not starting simultaneously making the confusion worse confounded. Such was the economical mode of setting forth the bill of fare on the _Manitoba_. There were three hundred and fifty people on hoard; more than one-third of whom were cabin, or would-be cabin, passengers. The accommodation being insufficient, some were camping on the upper deck, some in the saloon, many on the stairs, and others wherever elbow-room could be found. Breakfast began at half-past seven, and at half-past nine the late risers were still at it; and it was not long before the same thing (only more so!), in the shape of dinner, had to be gone through.  As Lake Huron was calm and our boat steady, we had more \"God save the Queen\" after dinner, besides \"Rule, Britannia\" and other patriotic songs, several of the passengers playing the piano very well. Some one also played a violin, and the men, clearing the saloon of sofas and superfluous chairs, danced a double set of quadrilles, after having tried in vain to persuade some of the emigrant girls to become their partners. They were an amusing group--from the grinning steward, who, cap on head, figured away through all the steps he could recollect or invent (some of them marvels of skill and agility in their way), to the solemn young man, only anxious to do his duty creditably. But alas for the short-lived joviality of the multitude! After touching at Southampton the boat altered her course, and the effect of her occasional rolls in the trough of the waves soon became manifest.  One by one the less courageous of the crowd crept away. Every face soon blanched with terror at the common enemy. Wretched women feebly tried to help crying children, though too ill to move themselves; others threw them down anywhere, to be able to escape in time for the threatened paroxysm; all were groaning, wan and miserable, railing at the poor, wearied stewardess, calling her here, there, and everywhere at the same time, and threatening her as if she were the sole cause of their woe. About midnight, our course being altered, \"Richard was himself again.\"     CHAPTER II.  Saulte Ste.
