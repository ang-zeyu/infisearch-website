But, it was probably one of his narrow escapes, for he said nothing.  ‘The first time I heard its cheerful little note, John, was on that night when you brought me home—when you brought me to my new home here; its little mistress.  Nearly a year ago.  You recollect, John?’  O yes.  John remembered.  I should think so!  ‘Its chirp was such a welcome to me!  It seemed so full of promise and encouragement.  It seemed to say, you would be kind and gentle with me, and would not expect (I had a fear of that, John, then) to find an old head on the shoulders of your foolish little wife.’  John thoughtfully patted one of the shoulders, and then the head, as though he would have said No, no; he had had no such expectation; he had been quite content to take them as they were.  And really he had reason. They were very comely.  ‘It spoke the truth, John, when it seemed to say so; for you have ever been, I am sure, the best, the most considerate, the most affectionate of husbands to me.  This has been a happy home, John; and I love the Cricket for its sake!’  ‘Why so do I then,’ said the Carrier.  ‘So do I, Dot.’  ‘I love it for the many times I have heard it, and the many thoughts its harmless music has given me.  Sometimes, in the twilight, when I have felt a little solitary and down-hearted, John—before baby was here to keep me company and make the house gay—when I have thought how lonely you would be if I should die; how lonely I should be if I could know that you had lost me, dear; its Chirp, Chirp, Chirp upon the hearth, has seemed to tell me of another little voice, so sweet, so very dear to me, before whose coming sound my trouble vanished like a dream.  And when I used to fear—I did fear once, John, I was very young you know—that ours might prove to be an ill-assorted marriage, I being such a child, and you more like my guardian than my husband; and that you might not, however hard you tried, be able to learn to love me, as you hoped and prayed you might; its Chirp, Chirp, Chirp has cheered me up again, and filled me with new trust and confidence.  I was thinking of these things to-night, dear, when I sat expecting you; and I love the Cricket for their sake!’  ‘And so do I,’ repeated John.  ‘But, Dot?  _I_ hope and pray that I might learn to love you?  How you talk!  I had learnt that, long before I brought you here, to be the Cricket’s little mistress, Dot!’  She laid her hand, an instant, on his arm, and looked up at him with an agitated face, as if she would have told him something.  Next moment she was down upon her knees before the basket, speaking in a sprightly voice, and busy with the parcels.  ‘There are not many of them to-night, John, but I saw some goods behind the cart, just now; and though they give more trouble, perhaps, still they pay as well; so we have no reason to grumble, have we?  Besides, you have been delivering, I dare say, as you came along?’  ‘Oh yes,’ John said.  ‘A good many.’  ‘Why what’s this round box?  Heart alive, John, it’s a wedding-cake!’  ‘Leave a woman alone to find out that,’ said John, admiringly.  ‘Now a man would never have thought of it.  Whereas, it’s my belief that if you was to pack a wedding-cake up in a tea-chest, or a turn-up bedstead, or a pickled salmon keg, or any unlikely thing, a woman would be sure to find it out directly.  Yes; I called for it at the pastry-cook’s.’  ‘And it weighs I don’t know what—whole hundredweights!’ cried Dot, making a great demonstration of trying to lift it.  ‘Whose is it, John?  Where is it going?’  ‘Read the writing on the other side,’ said John.  ‘Why, John!  My Goodness, John!’  ‘Ah! who’d have thought it!’ John returned.  ‘You never mean to say,’ pursued Dot, sitting on the floor and shaking her head at him, ‘that it’s Gruff and Tackleton the toymaker!’  John nodded.  Mrs. Peerybingle nodded also, fifty times at least.  Not in assent—in dumb and pitying amazement; screwing up her lips the while with all their little force (they were never made for screwing up; I am clear of that), and looking the good Carrier through and through, in her abstraction. Miss Slowboy, in the mean time, who had a mechanical power of reproducing scraps of current conversation for the delectation of the baby, with all the sense struck out of them, and all the nouns changed into the plural number, inquired aloud of that young creature, Was it Gruffs and Tackletons the toymakers then, and Would it call at Pastry-cooks for wedding-cakes, and Did its mothers know the boxes when its fathers brought them homes; and so on.  ‘And that is really to come about!’ said Dot.  ‘Why, she and I were girls at school together, John.’  He might have been thinking of her, or nearly thinking of her, perhaps, as she was in that same school time.  He looked upon her with a thoughtful pleasure, but he made no answer.  ‘And he’s as old!  As unlike her!—Why, how many years older than you, is Gruff and Tackleton, John?’  ‘How many more cups of tea shall I drink to-night at one sitting, than Gruff and Tackleton ever took in four, I wonder!’ replied John, good-humouredly, as he drew a chair to the round table, and began at the cold ham.  ‘As to eating, I eat but little; but that little I enjoy, Dot.’  Even this, his usual sentiment at meal times, one of his innocent delusions (for his appetite was always obstinate, and flatly contradicted him), awoke no smile in the face of his little wife, who stood among the parcels, pushing the cake-box slowly from her with her foot, and never once looked, though her eyes were cast down too, upon the dainty shoe she generally was so mindful of.  Absorbed in thought, she stood there, heedless alike of the tea and John (although he called to her, and rapped the table with his knife to startle her), until he rose and touched her on the arm; when she looked at him for a moment, and hurried to her place behind the teaboard, laughing at her negligence.  But, not as she had laughed before.  The manner and the music were quite changed.  The Cricket, too, had stopped.  Somehow the room was not so cheerful as it had been.  Nothing like it.  ‘So, these are all the parcels, are they, John?’ she said, breaking a long silence, which the honest Carrier had devoted to the practical illustration of one part of his favourite sentiment—certainly enjoying what he ate, if it couldn’t be admitted that he ate but little.  ‘So, these are all the parcels; are they, John?’  ‘That’s all,’ said John.  ‘Why—no—I—’ laying down his knife and fork, and taking a long breath.  ‘I declare—I’ve clean forgotten the old gentleman!’  ‘The old gentleman?’  ‘In the cart,’ said John.  ‘He was asleep, among the straw, the last time I saw him.  I’ve very nearly remembered him, twice, since I came in; but he went out of my head again.  Halloa!  Yahip there!  Rouse up!  That’s my hearty!’  John said these latter words outside the door, whither he had hurried with the candle in his hand.  Miss Slowboy, conscious of some mysterious reference to The Old Gentleman, and connecting in her mystified imagination certain associations of a religious nature with the phrase, was so disturbed, that hastily rising from the low chair by the fire to seek protection near the skirts of her mistress, and coming into contact as she crossed the doorway with an ancient Stranger, she instinctively made a charge or butt at him with the only offensive instrument within her reach.  This instrument happening to be the baby, great commotion and alarm ensued, which the sagacity of Boxer rather tended to increase; for, that good dog, more thoughtful than its master, had, it seemed, been watching the old gentleman in his sleep, lest he should walk off with a few young poplar trees that were tied up behind the cart; and he still attended on him very closely, worrying his gaiters in fact, and making dead sets at the buttons.  ‘You’re such an undeniable good sleeper, sir,’ said John, when tranquillity was restored; in the mean time the old gentleman had stood, bareheaded and motionless, in the centre of the room; ‘that I have half a mind to ask you where the other six are—only that would be a joke, and I know I should spoil it.  Very near though,’ murmured the Carrier, with a chuckle; ‘very near!’  The Stranger, who had long white hair, good features, singularly bold and well defined for an old man, and dark, bright, penetrating eyes, looked round with a smile, and saluted the Carrier’s wife by gravely inclining his head.  His garb was very quaint and odd—a long, long way behind the time.  Its hue was brown, all over.  In his hand he held a great brown club or walking-stick; and striking this upon the floor, it fell asunder, and became a chair.  On which he sat down, quite composedly.  ‘There!’ said the Carrier, turning to his wife.  ‘That’s the way I found him, sitting by the roadside!  Upright as a milestone.  And almost as deaf.’  ‘Sitting in the open air, John!’  ‘In the open air,’ replied the Carrier, ‘just at dusk.  “Carriage Paid,” he said; and gave me eighteenpence.  Then he got in.  And there he is.’  ‘He’s going, John, I think!’  Not at all.  He was only going to speak.  ‘If you please, I was to be left till called for,’ said the Stranger, mildly.  ‘Don’t mind me.’  With that, he took a pair of spectacles from one of his large pockets, and a book from another, and leisurely began to read.  Making no more of Boxer than if he had been a house lamb!  The Carrier and his wife exchanged a look of perplexity.  The Stranger raised his head; and glancing from the latter to the former, said,  ‘Your daughter, my good friend?’  ‘Wife,’ returned John.  ‘Niece?’ said the Stranger.  ‘Wife,’ roared John.  ‘Indeed?’ observed the Stranger.  ‘Surely?  Very young!’  He quietly turned over, and resumed his reading.  But, before he could have read two lines, he again interrupted himself to say:  ‘Baby, yours?’  John gave him a gigantic nod; equivalent to an answer in the affirmative, delivered through a speaking trumpet.  ‘"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6782"],["title","The Robbers (#1)"],["body","ILLER. EASTER FAIR, 1781.     ADVERTISEMENT TO THE ROBBERS.  AS COMMUNICATED BY SCHILLER TO DALBERG IN 1781, AND SUPPOSED TO HAVE BEEN USED AS A PROLOGUE.  --This has never before been printed with any of the editions.--  The picture of a great, misguided soul, endowed with every gift of excellence; yet lost in spite of all its gifts! Unbridled passions and bad companionship corrupt his heart, urge him on from crime to crime, until at last he stands at the head of a band of murderers, heaps horror upon horror, and plunges from precipice to precipice into the lowest depths of despair. Great and majestic in misfortune, by misfortune reclaimed, and led back to the paths of virtue. Such a man shall you pity and hate, abhor yet love, in the Robber Moor. You will likewise see a juggling, fiendish knave unmasked and blown to atoms in his own mines; a fond, weak, and over-indulgent father; the sorrows of too enthusiastic love, and the tortures of ungoverned passion. Here, too, you will witness, not without a shudder, the interior economy of vice; and from the stage be taught how all the tinsel of fortune fails to smother the inward worm; and how terror, anguish, remorse, and despair tread close on the footsteps of guilt. Let the spectator weep to-day at our exhibition, and tremble, and learn to bend his passions to the laws of religion and reason; let the youth behold with alarm the consequences of unbridled excess; nor let the man depart without imbibing the lesson that the invisible hand of Providence makes even villains the instruments of its designs and judgments, and can marvellously unravel the most intricate perplexities of fate.     PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION.  The eight hundred copies of the first edition of my ROBBERS were exhausted before all the admirers of the piece were supplied. A second was therefore undertaken, which has been improved by greater care in printing, and by the omission of those equivocal sentences which were offensive to the more fastidious part of the public. Such an alteration, however, in the construction of the play as should satisfy all the wishes of my friends and critics has not been my object.  In this second edition the several songs have been arranged for the pianoforte, which will enhance its value to the musical part of the public. I am indebted for this to an able composer,* who has performed his task in so masterly a manner that the hearer is not unlikely to forget the poet in the melody of the musician.

You look so pale.  OLD MOOR. Quite well, my son--what have you to tell me?  FRANCIS. The post is arrived--a letter from our correspondent at Leipsic.  OLD M. (eagerly). Any tidings of my son Charles?  FRANCIS. Hem! Hem!--Why, yes. But I fear--I know not--whether I dare --your health.--Are you really quite well, father?  OLD M. As a fish in water.* Does he write of my son? What means this anxiety about my health? You have asked me that question twice.     [*This is equivalent to our English saying \"As sound as a roach.\"]  FRANCIS. If you are unwell--or are the least apprehensive of being so-- permit me to defer--I will speak to you at a fitter season.--(Half aside.) These are no tidings for a feeble frame.  OLD M. Gracious Heavens? what am I doomed to hear?  FRANCIS. First let me retire and shed a tear of compassion for my lost brother. Would that my lips might be forever sealed--for he is your son! Would that I could throw an eternal veil over his shame--for he is my brother! But to obey you is my first, though painful, duty--forgive me, therefore.  OLD M. Oh, Charles! Charles! Didst thou but know what thorns thou plantest in thy father's bosom! That one gladdening report of thee would add ten years to my life! yes, bring back my youth! whilst now, alas, each fresh intelligence but hurries me a step nearer to the grave!  FRANCIS. Is it so, old man, then farewell! for even this very day we might all have to tear our hair over your coffin.*     [* This idiom is very common in Germany, and is used to express    affliction.]  OLD M. Stay! There remains but one short step more--let him have his will! (He sits down.) The sins of the father shall be visited unto the third and fourth generation--let him fulfil the decree.  FRANCIS (takes the letter out of his pocket). You know our correspondent! See! I would give a finger of my right hand might I pronounce him a liar--a base and slanderous liar! Compose yourself! Forgive me if I do not let you read the letter yourself. You cannot, must not, yet know all.  OLD M. All, all, my son. You will but spare me crutches.*     [* _Du ersparst mir die Krucke_; meaning that the contents of the    letter can but shorten his declining years, and so spare him the    necessity of crutches.]  FRANCIS (reads). \"Leipsic, May 1. Were I not bound by an inviolable promise to conceal nothing from you, not even the smallest particular, that I am able to collect, respecting your brother's career, never, my dearest friend, should my guiltless pen become an instrument of torture to you. I can gather from a hundred of your letters how tidings such as these must pierce your fraternal heart. It seems to me as though I saw thee, for the sake of this worthless, this detestable\"--(OLD M. covers his face). Oh! my father, I am only reading you the mildest passages-- \"this detestable man, shedding a thousand tears.\" Alas! mine flowed--ay, gushed in torrents over these pitying cheeks. \"I already picture to myself your aged pious father, pale as death.\" Good Heavens! and so you are, before you have heard anything.  OLD M. Go on! Go on!  FRANCIS. \"Pale as death, sinking down on his chair, and cursing the day when his ear was first greeted with the lisping cry of 'Father!' I have not yet been able to discover all, and of the little I do know I dare tell you only a part. Your brother now seems to have filled up the measure of his infamy. I, at least, can imagine nothing beyond what he has already accomplished; but possibly his genius may soar above my conceptions. After having contracted debts to the amount of forty thousand ducats, \"--a good round sum for pocket-money, father\" and having dishonored the daughter of a rich banker, whose affianced lover, a gallant youth of rank, he mortally wounded in a duel, he yesterday, in the dead of night, took the desperate resolution of absconding from the arm of justice, with seven companions whom he had corrupted to his own vicious courses.\" Father? for heaven's sake, father! How do you feel?  OLD M. Enough. No more, my son, no more!  FRANCIS. I will spare your feelings. \"The injured cry aloud for satisfaction. Warrants have been issued for his apprehension--a price is set on his head--the name of Moor\"--No, these unhappy lips shall not be guilty of a father's murder (he tears the letter). Believe it not, my father, believe not a syllable.  OLD M. (weeps bitterly). My name--my unsullied name!  FRANCIS (throws himself on his neck). Infamous! most infamous Charles! Oh, had I not my forebodings, when, even as a boy, he would scamper after the girls, and ramble about over hill and common with ragamuffin boys and all the vilest rabble; when he shunned the very sight of a church as a malefactor shuns a gaol, and would throw the pence he had wrung from your bounty into the hat of the first beggar he met, whilst we at home were edifying ourselves with devout prayers and pious homilies? Had I not my misgivings when he gave himself up to reading the adventures of Julius Caesar, Alexander the Great, and other benighted heathens, in preference to the history of the penitent Tobias? A hundred times over have I warned you--for my brotherly affection was ever kept in subjection to filial duty--that this forward youth would one day bring sorrow and disgrace on us all. Oh that he bore not the name of Moor! that my heart beat less warmly for him! This sinful affection, which I can not overcome, will one day rise up against me before the judgment-seat of heaven.  OLD M. Oh! my prospects! my golden dreams!  FRANCIS. Ay, well I knew it. Exactly what I always feared. That fiery spirit, you used to say, which is kindling in the boy, and renders him so susceptible to impressions of the beautiful and grand--the ingenuousness which reveals his whole soul in his eyes--the tenderness of feeling which melts him into weeping sympathy at every tale of sorrow--the manly courage which impels him to the summit of giant oaks, and urges him over fosse and palisade and foaming torrents--that youthful thirst of honor--that unconquerable resolution--all those resplendent virtues which in the father's darling gave such promise-- would ripen into the warm and sincere friend--the excellent citizen--the hero--the great, the very great man! Now, mark the result, father; the fiery spirit has developed itself--expanded--and behold its precious fruits. Observe this ingenuousness--how nicely it has changed into effrontery;--this tenderness of soul--how it displays itself in dalliance with coquettes, in susceptibility to the"]]]
