Didn’t you hear the mouse go up the clock? It’s hiding and watching. Pretend you aren’t looking, but see the two bright eyes peering at us, just at the end by the big hand. It wants the pie. As long as we are here it will not come down. That is a Christmas pie for the Christmas dinner to-morrow.  [Illustration: “They’ve been peeking in that big book”]  “If we go back the mouse will run down and gobble us all up. So there is nothing for us to do but stay here. It’s a long time till morning, and we better do something while we wait. How can we better while away the time than with stories? We dare not go to sleep, you know. If you’ll each tell a story you can have a gift, too.”  “A gift!” cried the chorus. “Well, that would be worth while. Pray tell us what will the gift be?”  “That’s a secret I am not allowed to tell. The reason is, because I do not know.”  “He does not know. He does not know,” sang the chorus, running down the scale as a mouse runs across the piano keys.  “Well,” cried the wee Salt and Pepper Pair which seemed inseparable, “since you know so much, you better begin the story-hour.”     TALE OF THE RAISIN DOLL   “I speak to be the teacher,” cried the Raisin Doll.  “Very well, you must tell the first story, then.”  “What must the stories be about?”  “Oh, there is only one thing to tell. We must each tell our history from the time we were born, in order to have the gift.”  “Will the gift be good to eat?” asked the creamy white Fat Boy.  “Best ever you tasted. That’s all I could find out about it. Now begin.”  The Raisin Doll pranced over to the end of the hearth, made a quick bow, and politely began:  “Ladies and Gentlemen:”  Everybody giggled, but he went bravely on.  “I don’t seem to remember the day I was born.”  “Not many do,” whispered one to another.  “It isn’t polite to interrupt,” frowned the speaker.  “The first thing I remember a whole bunch of us was hanging from a vine—”  “Ha! Ha! Ha!” shouted the chorus. “A whole bunch of him was hanging from a vine!”  “Well, there was a whole bunch of us, and as I looked about I saw many bunches and many, many vines.  “It was beautiful there in the sunlight. I never saw such glorious sunshine—”  “Where?” cried the audience.  “In a place called California.”  “Where is that?” asked one.  “Don’t tell us; we don’t want to know,” hastily cried the audience. “We aren’t to learn things here in this school.”  “I won’t tell you. I’ll show you,” and the speaker hopped on to the large globe that stood in the corner.  He slid down one side and placed his big toe on the spot where California claimed to be.  They all watched his antics closely, for in their hearts they did want to know where those bunches of grapes grew, even though they didn’t seem to want to learn anything.  “That’s exactly where my bunch of grapes grew, but I have cousins called Malagas and Muscatels who come from Spain.  “You don’t want to know where that is, of course. I am now going to take a little run around the world. Pretend I’m a top spinning, and the spot where I stop and twirl will be where my relatives live. When it’s time to twirl I’ll squeak and you can then close your eyes for the moment, so you won’t add anything to your store of knowledge.  “For my part, I would feel quite pleased if I were sailing around the world and could say, ‘Oh, Mr. Captain, just stop a few moments in Mediterranean Spain. I want a pocket full of raisins to eat; the layer kind, big fat juicy ones’; or if I were pudding hungry I’d wheedle him a little. I’d say, ‘Now, Captain dear, I’d just like to run into Valencia. We need a few pudding raisins. We’ll have a pudding that’ll melt in your mouth if we can go there.’  “I think that’s much better than to stand around with my mouth open, and when we steam into these places be wondering what grows there, and why we stopped.”  That was a new idea. Journeys on ships were fun, and how proud one would feel to be able to show the Captain just where to go for certain things.  “Mother,” whispered Jack, “let’s watch where he twirls. Maybe a captain might even beg us to go and show him where raisins grow, so he can bring back a shipload of them!”  The Raisin Doll now skipped gaily along as though he were going to the corner grocery for a stick of candy.  The audience gazed fascinated, and instead of closing eyes as he squeaked, they hardly dared wink for fear they might miss some of that raisin country.  “Where is he now?” one and another whispered as he paused and twirled, crying:  “There! There is the very spot where many of my cousins live, and because they live there instead of in California they are much sweeter.”  “Tell us why, tell us why,” clamoured the audience.  “For a very good reason. We are picked in bunches and dried in an oven in sugar. They are dried in the sun, and are called sun raisins. Their leaves are taken off, and a jolly time they have in the sunshine and fresh air. A much better way than to be shut in an oven in the dark.  “However, we have to make the best of it; the cool nights and heavy dews would ruin us if we stayed out, so we just cuddle up in the nice warm dark, and look forward to the moment when the big oven door will fly open, then we know something nice is to happen, for America sends millions of pounds of raisins to other countries, and we just love to go.  “The sun raisins are the kind used for Christmas goodies, and are packed between layers of paper in large wooden boxes.  “Other places they come from are here, and here, and here, and here.”  As he spoke, he twirled over various parts of the globe, touching Persia, Greece, Italy, and Southern France.  “It is quite grand to be a sun raisin and come in a box looking so large and delicious, and to know you are the finest of your kind, but I’d just about as soon be a pudding raisin, when the Cook comes in and says:  “‘Dear suz me, Missus, we can’t have pudding to-day!’  “Then all the children set up a dismal wail and Missus says, ‘Why not, I’d like to know!’  “‘Because we are just out of pudding raisins,’ but she adds cheerfully, ‘We have the layer kind. Could we use those?’  “‘Certainly not,’ says the Missus, with her head up like this and her mouth turned down like this. ‘They cost too much. We’ll have to have something else.’  “Then at dinner the Mister cries, ‘Why didn’t we have pudding to-day; we always have it on Tuesday!’  “‘Cause no pudding raisins in the house,’ cry the children, sniffing again.  [Illustration: “Behold, the Story Sprite!”]  “‘Send for a barrel of them,’ orders the Mister. ‘When that gives out, get another at once. When I have my mouth made up for pudding on Tuesdays I don’t want to be disappointed.’  “Wouldn’t that make a cute little pudding raisin hug herself?  “Another kind of raisin grows here in Smyrna; they are the small seedless kind.”  “The Corinthian raisin currant—”  “Boo! hoo! hoo!” interrupted somebody, apparently much grieved.  “Who’s crying like that?” asked the Raisin Doll.  “I am,” came in sobbing tones.  “Why?” asked everybody, standing on tip toe to see the weeping one.  “He’s telling my story. There isn’t much to tell about me, and if he tells it, I can’t; then I won’t get a gift!”  “To be sure you won’t!” said the tall Stick Doll. “Mr. Raisin, are you going to tell everybody’s story, may I ask?”  “Why, no,” said the Raisin Doll, a bit fussed over the uproar; “I forgot that one of my cousins was present.     TALE OF THE CURRANT DOLL   “Allow me to introduce to you the light-hearted, joyous-natured Corinthian raisin Currant.”  The light-hearted, joyous-natured Currant Doll wiped his tears away as he bowed and wailed:  “Ladies and Gentlemen, I am, though maybe I don’t look it.”  “Am what?” queried the audience sympathetically.  “Am what he said—light hearted and gay—and though my story is short I am just as important as any of you. What good would a bun be without currants? Just tell me that!” he cried in tragic tones, striking such a funny attitude even Mother stifled a giggle.  “I came from a beautiful vine that grows in the lowlands of Zante of the Ionian Islands belonging to Greece. I’ll show you the very spot.”  Here the audience was much surprised to see the light-hearted creature turn a somersault down the slippery side of the globe and land in a nest of small dots.  “These are islands,” he announced, “and here the vines are planted in neat little rows three feet apart. Our grapes are like berries no larger than a pea, and grow in clusters about three inches long.  “When about three years old the vine produces bunches of three kinds; red, black, and white grapes without seeds. We play hide and seek under the large leaves which protect us from the strong winds and hot sun.  “When we have grown as large as we can we are picked, dried, packed, and sent many miles away. That’s all.”  And he sat down so hard he bounced up again like a rubber ball.  “Three cheers for the Currant!” cried the Stick Doll. “He seems to have grown up under the figure three, and that brings good luck.  “Now, who wants to tell next?”  Nobody moved, and the Stick Doll cried:  “We’ll decide it by playing Ring around a Rosy. The last one down will be it. Come, hold hands, circle, and sing.”     TALE OF THE CLOVE DOLL   Round and round they went, singing to an accompaniment of rollicking laughter, and at the words: “Hush, hush, hush, we all fall down,” they fell in a heap, the Clove Doll being the last to fall.  “Allow me,” cried the Stick Doll, as he gallantly set Miss Clove on her feet.  “We will now have the pleasure of listening to this spicy creature. She surely has a fine story to tell.”  Miss Clove had been slyly studying the dictionary, and longed to impress the audience with the wonderful story of her life. She smoothed her crimson sash, perked the butterfly bow on her hair till it seemed almost ready to fly away, and with cheeks as red as her ribbons"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/55143"],["title","The Story of the Mince Pie (#2)"],["body","timidly.  “Ladies and Gentlemen: I am an undeveloped bud—”  “Ha! Ha!” cried one, who looked much like a vinegar cruet. “That is a joke!”  “Why?” demanded the Stick Doll.  “She said undeveloped.”  “So she did, what of it? You may tell us what the word means.”  The sour-looking one, much confused, stalked away as he murmured under his breath,  “We aren’t to learn anything here, I thought.”  “No, but if you knew the meaning of it, you would answer very promptly, so the joke is on you. The speaker can, of course, tell us.”  The Clove Doll’s cheeks flushed even redder than before, and wished with all her heart she had not used the large word of which she was so proud.  “I am sure I cannot tell what it means. It’s what I am, and it’s the way my story begins.”  “Who knows what the very large word used by the very small one means?” asked the Stick Doll, of the audience.  The Pepper and Salt Twins now stepped forward. They swayed from side to side and in sing-song tones cried:  “Un means not. Undeveloped means not developed; developed means finished.”  “Excellent memory you have,” said the Stick Doll.  “They’ve been peeking in that big book, too; I saw them,” cried the Vinegar Cruet. “Any one could do that.”  “Tell tale tit, your tongue shall be slit,” sang the whole crowd.  “Here! Here! This won’t do. Come, let us hear the rest of the story of this unfinished maid.”  “It isn’t true that I am not finished! As a clove I am complete and perfect. It is only that the buds are used before they are quite ready to turn into blossoms.  “If my buds were allowed to blossom there would never be a clove. What would the pickled peach do then, poor thing?”    “She’d stay in her jar,    And soon be sour,    And moulder away on the shelf, poor thing!”  promptly sang the audience.  At this Jack and Mother hid their heads in the blankets, shaking with laughter, and came forth with very red faces just in time to hear Miss Clove continue her spicy tale.  “The clove tree grows in the woods in hot countries, specially here and here, and here.”  “She’s on roller skates,” whispered Jack, as the Clove Lady sailed quickly and gracefully around the globe, touching with her wheeled feet Zanzibar, Brazil, and the West Indies.  “The audience need not note especially the countries pointed out,” said the Stick Doll, “but it is to me most interesting. You may continue.”  The Clove Doll had snatched the moment while she waited to again improve her mind through the big book, and now announced importantly:  “I am very pungent. That means aromatic.”  “Oh!” cried the Vinegar Cruet, “you had to shut the book too quick to find the meaning of that, but I happen to know it.  “Why are you like me?”  “Happy thought,” said the Stick Doll; “let’s turn this into a puzzle contest. Why is the clove like vinegar?”  “Give it up. Give it up. What’s the answer?” sang the audience.  “Because we are both sharp,” politely answered the Vinegar Cruet, strutting about like a peacock.  “Sharp! Ha! Ha!” cried Pepper and Salt. “S’pose you’ve been visiting the scissors’ grinder.”  “Vinegar is right,” said the Clove Doll. “We are both smart.”  “Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Let’s all carry a pocket dictionary and we can be smart and sharp, too,” laughed some one.  “Dear me!” cried the Clove Doll. “Did I really say smart? I mis-spoke. I am sharp. I mean stinging to the tongue.”  Before she could say another word she was surrounded and tested so vigorously by the many tongues, she shrieked indignantly:  “Stop! we don’t lick the ladder till the ice cream is done. Now let me finish.  “My buds turn green, then red and hard. Then we are laid near the smoke of a wood fire in the sun to dry. We don’t like that smudge and are glad enough when we turn brown, then we know we are finished. I might say developed,” she added, with a triumphant glance at her hearers.     DANCE OF THE ELVES   “The last night there in the woods we had a grand time. We looked like a lot of elves dancing in the red glow shed by the fire.  “I’ll never forget what happened that night. We had just finished a weird dance and were huddled together watching the sparks mount to the sky, when there appeared in our midst a queer little Being, who seemed to spring from the fire.  “She seated herself in our midst and told us the grandest stories I ever heard!”  “Oh!” cried Allspice, “I wish she would come here!”  At that instant they heard a far-off voice. It seemed to come from the flames. Singing, singing, nearer and nearer.     THE STORY SPRITE’S TALE   Suddenly from the very centre of the fire sprang a wonderful vision, a tiny creature, who seemed clothed in wreaths of flame. With a joyous greeting, as jolly as the fire itself, she cried:  “Your wish is granted. Behold, the Story Sprite! Since I attended the clove party I have been around the world and have a fine collection of tales.  “I am fresh from Japan, now, where I saw enacted a most exciting tale. Creep close to my feet while I tell it. I wish you could see the children in Japan. They are so beautiful; clad in their brilliant coloured kimonos, they look like a mass of poppies nodding in the wind.  “One dear little Japanese maid did such a splendid thing!  “Without speaking a word, with only her dear two hands, she saved a young man from being imprisoned for life. He was an American gentleman, who had been sent to Japan on business.  “He was lonely so far from home, and became very friendly with Cherry Blossom, the child of one with whom he had business relations.  “He was very much interested in the queer games she played, and spent much time with her.  [Illustration: “Great sport they had flying wonderful kites”]  “Great sport they had flying wonderful kites that looked like gorgeous birds with outspread wings, or maybe seated on the beach she would make sand pictures, which were her great delight.  “They usually wound up these visits with a tea-party. The child seated opposite him, looking like a brilliant butterfly, poised for a moment as she handed him the fragile cup filled with the fragrant beverage.  “In time he became very dear to her, and one day while playing with her dolly she overheard something that sorely troubled her little heart. Her father was talking in low mysterious tones to some Japanese friends. Suddenly she heard the American’s name. She pricked up her ears.  “Dear! Dear! Such startling news she could hardly believe.  “They thought he was a spy and were going to put him in prison very soon! They walked away, leaving the child grief-stricken.  “What a spy was, she did not know; but what she did know was that her precious friend must be saved from that awful fate, for once in prison he might never be released.  “He had told her of his own little girl, who was even now, in that far away land called America, watching for his home coming. As she gazed off seaward she saw a ship that might sail any day. He must go on it and she must tell him why, but how could she?  “Never was she allowed to be alone with him for one moment. Always when playing her childish games with him, her nurse sat near by, within hearing of her voice, her beady eyes watching her every movement.  “As the child pondered on this startling state of affairs, her friend suddenly appeared. At once the nurse glided to her post.  “‘See the ship,’ he cried in her native language. ‘It will sail this evening. The next ship that comes will take me home to my baby. Let’s go and buy her a doll.’  “To the shop they went, the nurse trotting along beside them.  “They bought a wonderful doll, an exact copy of Cherry Blossom in her silken robes.  “They bought many other toys, among them a complete outfit for making sand pictures.  “‘I’ll tell my baby how you helped me to choose her doll. Now let’s go to the beach and you bring your sand bags and teach me how to make the pictures so I can make them for her.’  “Happy thought! Now maybe she could have an instant, just a weenty instant alone with him, and so she asked the nurse to bring the bags of sand.  “‘You come, too,’ whispered the nurse, and refused to budge without the child.  “Japanese children must be obedient, and she followed, not even daring to allow her little feet to lag or to seem disturbed in any way.  “She was soon seated on the beach close beside her friend, while the nurse sat a little apart knitting, her eyes fixed on the pair.  “Making pictures in the sand is a wonderful game, a game the Japanese children adore.  “They have three bags of coloured sand and one of white. It is most fascinating to see them spread in the form of a square the white sand, till it resembles a sheet of white paper. On this with black and red, yellow or blue, they produce wonderful landscape effects.  “Cherry Blossom plunged her hands into the bags, her thoughts far away from the game.  “Suddenly her eyes flashed. She knew how to give him the message. Why hadn’t she thought of it before! Pictures could tell most anything, and so she eagerly began.  “Immediately from her tiny fingers the varicoloured sand trickled in a thin stream.  “At first as he idly watched, he saw in her picture a bit of sea, on which presently appeared a ship with spreading sail. On the fluffy white waves, creeping up to the shore, rocked a tiny boat. On the land appeared a prison, a perfect copy of one he had seen many times. In the small boat an American was seated.  “The man watched in tense silence. The child was telling him something. He lit a cigarette with unsteady hands, but as he remembered the sentinel on guard, he began to hum a tune.  “The child’s hands never trembled as she next produced a number of Japanese gentlemen.  “Now the man disappeared from the boat, and at once was seen peering through the prison bars.  “Just here the nurse suspiciously drew near to see the picture.  “The man quickly pointed to the sky, crying gaily, ‘See the birds!’  “As the nurse gazed Skyward, one swift stroke of his hand destroyed the picture, and he said quietly:  “‘Now let me make one. You do them"]]]
