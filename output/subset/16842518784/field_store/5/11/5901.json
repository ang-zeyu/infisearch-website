We will have it melted down in a fiery furnace, and thereafter fashioned into eleven little silver bats. And these little silver bats shall be the guerdon of the eleven members of the winning team, to have and to hold for the space of one year, unless, by winning the cup twice in succession, they gain the right of keeping the bat for yet another year. How is that, umpire?\" And the authorities replied, \"O men of infinite resource and sagacity, verily is it a cold day when _you_ get left behind. Forge ahead.\" But, when they had forged ahead, behold! it would not run to eleven little silver bats, but only to ten little silver bats. Thereupon the headmaster, a man liberal with his cash, caused an eleventh little bat to be fashioned--for the captain of the winning team to have and to hold in the manner aforesaid. And, to single it out from the others, it was wrought, not of silver, but of gold. And so it came to pass that at the time of our story Trevor was in possession of the little gold bat, because Donaldson's had won the cup in the previous summer, and he had captained them--and, incidentally, had scored seventy-five without a mistake.  \"Well, I'm hanged if I would trust O'Hara with my bat,\" said Clowes, referring to the silver ornament on his own watch-chain; \"he's probably pawned yours in the holidays. Why did you lend it to him?\"  \"His people wanted to see it. I know him at home, you know. They asked me to lunch the last day but one of the holidays, and we got talking about the bat, because, of course, if we hadn't beaten Dexter's in the final, O'Hara would have had it himself. So I sent it over next day with a note asking O'Hara to bring it back with him here.\"  \"Oh, well, there's a chance, then, seeing he's only had it so little time, that he hasn't pawned it yet. You'd better rush off and get it back as soon as possible. It's no good waiting for me. I shan't be ready for weeks.\"  \"Where's Paget?\"  \"Teaing with Donaldson. At least, he said he was going to.\"  \"Then I suppose I shall have to go alone. I hate walking alone.\"  \"If you hurry,\" said Clowes, scanning the road from his post of vantage, \"you'll be able to go with your fascinating pal Ruthven. He's just gone out.\"  Trevor dashed downstairs in his energetic way, and overtook the youth referred to.  Clowes brooded over them from above like a sorrowful and rather disgusted Providence. Trevor's liking for Ruthven, who was a Donaldsonite like himself, was one of the few points on which the two had any real disagreement. Clowes could not understand how any person in his senses could of his own free will make an intimate friend of Ruthven.  \"Hullo, Trevor,\" said Ruthven.  \"Come over to the baths,\" said Trevor, \"I want to see O'Hara about something. Or were you going somewhere else.\"  \"I wasn't going anywhere in particular. I never know what to do in term-time. It's deadly dull.\"  Trevor could never understand how any one could find term-time dull. For his own part, there always seemed too much to do in the time.  \"You aren't allowed to play games?\" he said, remembering something about a doctor's certificate in the past.  \"No,\" said Ruthven. \"Thank goodness,\" he added.  Which remark silenced Trevor. To a person who thanked goodness that he was not allowed to play games he could find nothing to say. But he ceased to wonder how it was that Ruthven was dull.  They proceeded to the baths together in silence. O'Hara, they were informed by a Dexter's fag who met them outside the door, was not about.  \"When he comes back,\" said Trevor, \"tell him I want him to come to tea tomorrow directly after school, and bring my bat. Don't forget.\"  The fag promised to make a point of it.     III  THE MAYOR'S STATUE   One of the rules that governed the life of Donough O'Hara, the light-hearted descendant of the O'Haras of Castle Taterfields, Co. Clare, Ireland, was \"Never refuse the offer of a free tea\". So, on receipt--per the Dexter's fag referred to--of Trevor's invitation, he scratched one engagement (with his mathematical master--not wholly unconnected with the working-out of Examples 200 to 206 in Hall and Knight's Algebra), postponed another (with his friend and ally Moriarty, of Dexter's, who wished to box with him in the gymnasium), and made his way at a leisurely pace towards Donaldson's. He was feeling particularly pleased with himself today, for several reasons. He had begun the day well by scoring brilliantly off Mr Dexter across the matutinal rasher and coffee. In morning school he had been put on to translate the one passage which he happened to have prepared--the first ten lines, in fact, of the hundred which formed the morning's lesson. And in the final hour of afternoon school, which was devoted to French, he had discovered and exploited with great success an entirely new and original form of ragging. This, he felt, was the strenuous life; this was living one's life as one's life should be lived.  He met Trevor at the gate. As they were going in, a carriage and pair dashed past. Its cargo consisted of two people, the headmaster, looking bored, and a small, dapper man, with a very red face, who looked excited, and was talking volubly. Trevor and O'Hara raised their caps as the chariot swept by, but the salute passed unnoticed. The Head appeared to be wrapped in thought.  \"What's the Old Man doing in a carriage, I wonder,\" said Trevor, looking after them. \"Who's that with him?\"  \"That,\" said O'Hara, \"is Sir Eustace Briggs.\"  \"Who's Sir Eustace Briggs?\"  O'Hara explained, in a rich brogue, that Sir Eustace was Mayor of Wrykyn, a keen politician, and a hater of the Irish nation, judging by his letters and speeches.  They went into Trevor's study. Clowes was occupying the window in his usual manner.  \"Hullo, O'Hara,\" he said, \"there is an air of quiet satisfaction about you that seems to show that you've been ragging Dexter. Have you?\"  \"Oh, that was only this morning at breakfast. The best rag was in French,\" replied O'Hara, who then proceeded to explain in detail the methods he had employed to embitter the existence of the hapless Gallic exile with whom he had come in contact. It was that gentleman's custom to sit on a certain desk while conducting the lesson. This desk chanced to be O'Hara's. On the principle that a man may do what he likes with his own, he had entered the room privily in the dinner-hour, and removed the screws from his desk, with the result that for the first half-hour of the lesson the class had been occupied in excavating M. Gandinois from the ruins. That gentleman's first act on regaining his equilibrium had been to send O'Hara out of the room, and O'Hara, who had foreseen this emergency, had spent a very pleasant half-hour in the passage with some mixed chocolates and a copy of Mr Hornung's _Amateur Cracksman_. It was his notion of a cheerful and instructive French lesson.  \"What were you talking about when you came in?\" asked Clowes. \"Who's been slanging Ireland, O'Hara?\"  \"The man Briggs.\"  \"What are you going to do about it? Aren't you going to take any steps?\"  \"Is it steps?\" said O'Hara, warmly, \"and haven't we----\"  He stopped.  \"Well?\"  \"Ye know,\" he said, seriously, \"ye mustn't let it go any further. I shall get sacked if it's found out. An' so will Moriarty, too.\"  \"Why?\" asked Trevor, looking up from the tea-pot he was filling, \"what on earth have you been doing?\"  \"Wouldn't it be rather a cheery idea,\" suggested Clowes, \"if you began at the beginning.\"  \"Well, ye see,\" O'Hara began, \"it was this way. The first I heard of it was from Dexter. He was trying to score off me as usual, an' he said, 'Have ye seen the paper this morning, O'Hara?' I said, no, I had not. Then he said, 'Ah,' he said, 'ye should look at it. There's something there that ye'll find interesting.' I said, 'Yes, sir?' in me respectful way. 'Yes,' said he, 'the Irish members have been making their customary disturbances in the House. Why is it, O'Hara,' he said, 'that Irishmen are always thrusting themselves forward and making disturbances for purposes of self-advertisement?' 'Why, indeed, sir?' said I, not knowing what else to say, and after that the conversation ceased.\"  \"Go on,\" said Clowes.  \"After breakfast Moriarty came to me with a paper, and showed me what they had been saying about the Irish. There was a letter from the man Briggs on the subject. 'A very sensible and temperate letter from Sir Eustace Briggs', they called it, but bedad! if that was a temperate letter, I should like to know what an intemperate one is. Well, we read it through, and Moriarty said to me, 'Can we let this stay as it is?' And I said, 'No. We can't.' 'Well,' said Moriarty to me, 'what are we to do about it? I should like to tar and feather the man,' he said. 'We can't do that,' I said, 'but why not tar and feather his statue?' I said. So we thought we would. Ye know where the statue is, I suppose? It's in the recreation ground just across the river.\"  \"I know the place,\" said Clowes. \"Go on. This is ripping. I always knew you were pretty mad, but this sounds as if it were going to beat all previous records.\"  \"Have ye seen the baths this term,\" continued O'Hara, \"since they shifted Dexter's house into them? The beds are in two long rows along each wall. Moriarty's and mine are the last two at the end farthest from the door.\"  \"Just under the gallery,\" said Trevor. \"I see.\"  \"That's it. Well, at half-past ten sharp every night Dexter sees that we're all in, locks the door, and goes off to sleep at the Old Man's, and we don't see him again till breakfast. He turns the gas off from outside. At half-past seven the next morning, Smith\"--Smith was one of the school porters--\"unlocks the door and calls us, and we go over to the Hall to breakfast.\"  \"Well?\"  \"Well, directly"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6880"],["title","The Coming of Bill (#1)"],["body"," and rang the bell over which was a card hearing the name of “Kirk Winfield”. Mr. Pennicut watched her in silence.  Mrs. Porter pressed the button a second time. Somebody came at a leisurely pace down the passage, whistling cheerfully. The door opened.  It did not often happen to Lora Delane Porter to feel insignificant, least of all in the presence of the opposite sex. She had well-defined views upon man. Yet, in the interval which elapsed between the opening of the door and her first words, a certain sensation of smallness overcame her.  The man who had opened the door was not, judged by any standard of regularity of features, handsome. He had a rather boyish face, pleasant eyes set wide apart, and a friendly mouth. He was rather an outsize in young men, and as he stood there he seemed to fill the doorway.  It was this sense of bigness that he conveyed, his cleanness, his magnificent fitness, that for the moment overcame Mrs. Porter. Physical fitness was her gospel. She stared at him in silent appreciation.  To the young man, however, her forceful gaze did not convey this quality. She seemed to him to be looking as if she had caught him in the act of endeavouring to snatch her purse. He had been thrown a little off his balance by the encounter.  Resource in moments of crisis is largely a matter of preparedness, and a man, who, having opened his door in the expectation of seeing a ginger-haired, bow-legged, grinning George Pennicut, is confronted by a masterful woman with eyes like gimlets, may be excused for not guessing that her piercing stare is an expression of admiration and respect.  Mrs. Porter broke the silence. It was ever her way to come swiftly to the matter in hand.  “Mr. Kirk Winfield?”  “Yes.”  “Have you in your employment a red-haired, congenital idiot who ambles about New York in an absent-minded way, as if he were on a desert island? The man I refer to is a short, stout Englishman, clean-shaven, dressed in black.”  “That sounds like George Pennicut.”  “I have no doubt that that is his name. I did not inquire. It did not interest me. My name is Mrs. Lora Delane Porter. This man of yours has just run into my automobile.”  “I beg your pardon?”  “I cannot put it more lucidly. I was driving along the street when this weak-minded person flung himself in front of my car. He is out there now. Kindly come and help him in.”  “Is he hurt?”  “More frightened than hurt. I have examined him. His left knee appears to be slightly wrenched.”  Kirk Winfield passed a hand over his left forehead and followed her. Like George, he found Mrs. Porter a trifle overwhelming.  Out in the street George Pennicut, now the centre of quite a substantial section of the Four Million, was causing a granite-faced policeman to think that the age of miracles had returned by informing him that the accident had been his fault and no other’s. He greeted the relief-party with a wan grin.  “Just broke my leg, sir,” he announced to Kirk.  “You have done nothing of the sort,” said Mrs. Porter. “You have wrenched your knee very slightly. Have you explained to the policeman that it was entirely your fault?”  “Yes, ma’am.”  “That’s right. Always speak the truth.”  “Yes, ma’am.”  “Mr. Winfield will help you indoors.”  “Thank you, ma’am.”  She turned to Kirk.  “Now, Mr. Winfield.”  Kirk bent over the victim, gripped him, and lifted him like a baby.  “He’s got his,” observed one interested spectator.  “I should worry!” agreed another. “All broken up.”  “Nothing of the kind,” said Mrs. Porter severely. “The man is hardly hurt at all. Be more accurate in your remarks.”  She eyed the speaker sternly. He wilted.  “Yes, ma’am,” he mumbled sheepishly.  The policeman, with that lionlike courage which makes the New York constabulary what it is, endeavoured to assert himself at this point.  “Hey!” he boomed.  Mrs. Porter turned her gaze upon him, her cold, steely gaze.  “I beg your pardon?”  “This won’t do, ma’am. I’ve me report to make. How did this happen?”  “You have already been informed. The man ran into my automobile.”  “But——”  “I shall not charge him.”  She turned and followed Kirk.  “But, say——” The policeman’s voice was now almost plaintive.  Mrs. Porter ignored him and disappeared into the house. The policeman, having gulped several times in a disconsolate way, relieved his feelings by dispersing the crowd with well-directed prods of his locust stick. A small boy who lingered, squeezing the automobile’s hooter, in a sort of trance he kicked. The boy vanished. The crowd melted. The policeman walked slowly toward Ninth Avenue. Peace reigned in the street.  “Put him to bed,” said Mrs. Porter, as Kirk laid his burden on a couch in the studio. “You seem exceedingly muscular, Mr. Winfield. I noticed that you carried him without an effort. He is a stout man, too. Grossly out of condition, like ninety-nine per cent of men to-day.”  “I’m not so young as I was, ma’am,” protested George. “When I was in the harmy I was a fine figure of a man.”  “The more shame to you that you have allowed yourself to deteriorate,” commented Mrs. Porter. “Beer?”  A grateful smile irradiated George’s face.  “Thank you, ma’am. It’s very kind of you, ma’am. I don’t mind if I do.”  “The man appears a perfect imbecile,” said Mrs. Porter, turning abruptly to Kirk. “I ask him if he attributes his physical decay to beer and he babbles.”  “I think he thought you were offering him a drink,” suggested Kirk. “As a matter of fact, a little brandy wouldn’t hurt him, after the shock he has had.”  “On no account. The worst thing possible.”  “This isn’t your lucky day, George,” said Kirk. “Well, I guess I’ll phone to the doctor.”  “Quite unnecessary.”  “I beg your pardon?”  “Entirely unnecessary. I have made an examination. There is practically nothing the matter with the man. Put him to bed, and let him sponge his knee with warm water.”  “Are you a doctor, Mrs. Porter?”  “I have studied first aid.”  “Well, I think, if you don’t mind, I should like to have your opinion confirmed.”  This was rank mutiny. Mrs. Porter stared haughtily at Kirk. He met her gaze with determination.  “As you please,” she snapped.  “Thank you,” said Kirk. “I don’t want to take any risks with George. I couldn’t afford to lose him. There aren’t any more like him: they’ve mislaid the pattern.”  He went to the telephone.  Mrs. Porter watched him narrowly. She was more than ever impressed by the perfection of his physique. She appraised his voice as he spoke to the doctor. It gave evidence of excellent lungs. He was a wonderfully perfect physical specimen.  An idea concerning this young man came into her mind, startling as all great ideas are at birth. The older it grew, the more she approved of it. She decided to put a few questions to him. She had a habit of questioning people, and it never occurred to her that they might resent it. If it had occurred to her, she would have done it just the same. She was like that.  “Mr. Winfield?”  “Yes?”  “I should like to ask you a few questions.”  This woman delighted Kirk.  “Please do,” he said.  Mrs. Porter scanned him closely.  “You are an extraordinarily healthy man, to all appearances. Have you ever suffered from bad health?”  “Measles.”  “Immaterial.”  “Very unpleasant, though.”  “Nothing else?”  “Mumps.”  “Unimportant.”  “Not to me. I looked like a water-melon.”  “Nothing besides? No serious illnesses?”  “None.”  “What is your age?”  “Twenty-five.”  “Are your parents living?”  “No.”  “Were they healthy?”  “Fit as fiddles.”  “And your grandparents?”  “Perfect bear-cats. I remember my grandfather at the age of about a hundred or something like that spanking me for breaking his pipe. I thought it was a steam-hammer. He was a wonderfully muscular old gentleman.”  “Excellent.”  “By the way,” said Kirk casually, “my life _is_ insured.”  “Very sensible. There has been no serious illness in your family at all, then, as far as you know?”  “I could hunt up the records, if you like; but I don’t think so.”  “Consumption? No? Cancer? No? As far as you are aware, nothing? Very satisfactory.”  “I’m glad you’re pleased.”  “Are you married?”  “Good Lord, no!”  “At your age you should be. With your magnificent physique and remarkable record of health, it is your duty to the future of the race to marry.”  “I’m not sure I’ve been worrying much about the future of the race.”  “No man does. It is the crying evil of the day, men’s selfish absorption in the present, their utter lack of a sense of duty with regard to the future. Have you read my ‘Dawn of Better Things’?”  “I’m afraid I read very few novels.”  “It is not a novel. It is a treatise on the need for implanting a sense of personal duty to the future of the race in the modern young man.”  “It sounds a crackerjack. I must get it.”  “I will send you a copy. At the same time I will send you my ‘Principles of Selection’ and ‘What of To-morrow?’ They will make you think.”  “I bet they will. Thank you very much.”  “And now,” said Mrs. Porter, switching the conversation to the gaping George, “you had better put this man to bed.”  George Pennicut’s opinion of Mrs. Porter, to which he was destined to adhere on closer acquaintance, may be recorded.  “A hawful woman, sir,” he whispered as Kirk bore him off.  “Nonsense, George,” said Kirk. “One of the most entertaining ladies I have ever met. Already I love her like a son. But how she escaped from Bloomingdale beats me. There’s been carelessness somewhere.”  The bedrooms attached to the studio opened off the gallery that ran the length of the east wall. Looking over the edge of the gallery before coming downstairs Kirk perceived his visitor engaged in a tour of the studio. At that moment she was examining his masterpiece, “Ariadne in Naxos.” He had called it that because that was what it had turned into.  At the beginning he had had no definite opinion as to its identity. It was rather a habit with his pictures to start out in a vague spirit of adventure and receive their label on completion."]]]
