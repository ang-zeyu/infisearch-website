High though of blood he be, He loves the people, honors their old customs. With both of these I will take counsel how To rid us bravely of our country's foe. Farewell! and while I am away, bear thou A watchful eye in management at home. The pilgrim journeying to the house of God, And pious monk, collecting for his cloister, To these give liberally from purse and garner. Stauffacher's house would not be hid. Right out Upon the public way it stands, and offers To all that pass an hospitable roof.     [While they are retiring, TELL enters with BAUMGARTEN.  TELL. Now, then, you have no further need of me. Enter yon house. 'Tis Werner Stauffacher's, A man that is a father to distress. See, there he is himself! Come, follow me.     [They retire up. Scene changes.    SCENE III.     A common near Altdorf. On an eminence in the background a castle    in progress of erection, and so far advanced that the outline of the    whole may be distinguished. The back part is finished; men are    working at the front. Scaffolding, on which the workmen are going    up and down. A slater is seen upon the highest part of the roof.--    All is bustle and activity.     TASKMASTER, MASON, WORKMEN, and LABORERS.  TASKMASTER (with a stick, urging on the workmen). Up, up! You've rested long enough. To work! The stones here, now the mortar, and the lime! And let his lordship see the work advanced When next he comes. These fellows crawl like snails!     [To two laborers with loads.  What! call ye that a load? Go, double it. Is this the way ye earn your wages, laggards?  FIRST WORKMAN. 'Tis very hard that we must bear the stones, To make a keep and dungeon for ourselves!  TASKMASTER. What's that you mutter? 'Tis a worthless race, And fit for nothing but to milk their cows, And saunter idly up and down the mountains.  OLD MAN (sinks down exhausted). I can no more.  TASKMASTER (shaking him).         Up, up, old man, to work!  FIRST WORKMAN. Have you no bowels of compassion, thus To press so hard upon a poor old man, That scarce can drag his feeble limbs along?  MASTER MASON and WORKMEN. Shame, shame upon you--shame! It cries to heaven!  TASKMASTER. Mind your own business. I but do my duty.  FIRST WORKMAN. Pray, master, what's to be the name of this Same castle when 'tis built?  TASKMASTER.                The keep of Uri; For by it we shall keep you in subjection.  WORKMEN. The keep of Uri.  TASKMASTER.          Well, why laugh at that?  SECOND WORKMAN. So you'll keep Uri with this paltry place!  FIRST WORKMAN. How many molehills such as that must first Be piled above each other ere you make A mountain equal to the least in Uri?     [TASKMASTER retires up the stage.  MASTER MASON. I'll drown the mallet in the deepest lake, That served my hand on this accursed pile.     [Enter TELL and STAUFFACHER.  STAUFFACHER. Oh, that I had not lived to see this sight!  TELL. Here 'tis not good to be. Let us proceed.  STAUFFACHER. Am I in Uri, in the land of freedom?  MASTER MASON. Oh, sir, if you could only see the vaults Beneath these towers. The man that tenants them Will never hear the cock crow more.  STAUFFACHER.                    O God!  MASTER MASON. Look at these ramparts and these buttresses, That seem as they were built to last forever.  TELL. Hands can destroy whatever hands have reared.     [Pointing to the mountains.  That house of freedom God hath built for us.     [A drum is heard. People enter bearing a cap upon a    pole, followed by a crier. Women and children thronging    tumultuously after them.  FIRST WORKMAN. What means the drum? Give heed!  MASTER MASON.                  Why here's a mumming! And look, the cap,--what can they mean by that?  CRIER. In the emperor's name, give ear!  WORKMEN.                  Hush! silence! hush!  CRIER. Ye men of Uri, ye do see this cap! It will be set upon a lofty pole In Altdorf, in the market-place: and this Is the lord governor's good will and pleasure, The cap shall have like honor as himself, And all shall reverence it with bended knee, And head uncovered; thus the king will know Who are his true and loyal subjects here: His life and goods are forfeit to the crown, That shall refuse obedience to the order.     [The people burst out into laughter. The drum beats,    and the procession passes on.  FIRST WORKMAN. A strange device to fall upon, indeed! Do reverence to a cap! a pretty farce! Heard ever mortal anything like this?  MASTER MASON. Down to a cap on bended knee, forsooth! Rare jesting this with men of sober sense!  FIRST WORKMAN. Nay, were it but the imperial crown, indeed! But 'tis the cap of Austria! I've seen it Hanging above the throne in Gessler's hall.  MASTER MASON. The cap of Austria! Mark that! A snare To get us into Austria's power, by heaven!  WORKMEN. No freeborn man will stoop to such disgrace.  MASTER MASON. Come--to our comrades, and advise with them!     [They retire up.  TELL (to STAUFFACHER). You see how matters stand: Farewell, my friend!  STAUFFACHER. Whither away? Oh, leave us not so soon.  TELL. They look for me at home. So fare ye well.  STAUFFACHER. My heart's so full, and has so much to tell you.  TELL. Words will not make a heart that's heavy light.  STAUFFACHER. Yet words may possibly conduct to deeds.  TELL. All we can do is to endure in silence.  STAUFFACHER. But shall we bear what is not to be borne?  TELL. Impetuous rulers have the shortest reigns. When the fierce south wind rises from his chasms, Men cover up their fires, the ships in haste Make for the harbor, and the mighty spirit Sweeps o'er the earth, and leaves no trace behind. Let every man live quietly at home; Peace to the peaceful rarely is denied.  STAUFFACHER. And is it thus you view our grievances?  TELL. The serpent stings not till it is provoked. Let them alone; they'll weary of themselves, Whene'er they see we are not to be roused.  STAUFFACHER. Much might be done--did we stand fast together.  TELL. When the ship founders, he will best escape Who seeks no other's safety but his own.  STAUFFACHER. And you desert the common cause so coldly?  TELL. A man can safely count but on himself!  STAUFFACHER. Nay, even the weak grow strong by union.  TELL. But the strong man is the strongest when alone.  STAUFFACHER. Your country, then, cannot rely on you If in despair she rise against her foes.  TELL. Tell rescues the lost sheep from yawning gulfs: Is he a man, then, to desert his friends? Yet, whatsoe'er you do, spare me from council! I was not born to ponder and select; But when your course of action is resolved, Then call on Tell; you shall not find him fail.    [Exeunt severally. A sudden tumult is heard around the scaffolding.  MASTER MASON (running in). What's wrong?  FIRST WORKMAN (running forward).         The slater's fallen from the roof.  BERTHA (rushing in). Is he dashed to pieces? Run--save him, help! If help be possible, save him! Here is gold.     [Throws her trinkets among the people.  MASTER MASON. Hence with your gold,--your universal charm, And remedy for ill! When you have torn Fathers from children, husbands from their wives, And scattered woe and wail throughout the land, You think with gold to compensate for all. Hence! Till we saw you we were happy men; With you came misery and dark despair.  BERTHA (to the TASKMASTER, who has returned). Lives he?    [TASKMASTER shakes his head.       Ill-fated towers, with curses built, And doomed with curses to be tenanted!                      [Exit.    SCENE IV.     The House of WALTER FURST. WALTER FURST and ARNOLD    VON MELCHTHAL enter simultaneously at different sides.  MELCHTHAL. Good Walter Furst.  FURST.           If we should be surprised! Stay where you are. We are beset with spies.  MELCHTHAL. Have you no news for me from Unterwald? What of my father? 'Tis not to be borne, Thus to be pent up like a felon here! What have I done of such a heinous stamp, To skulk and hide me like a murderer? I only laid my staff across the fingers Of the pert varlet, when before my eyes, By order of the governor, he tried To drive away my handsome team of oxen.  FURST. You are too rash by far. He did no more Than what the governor had ordered him. You had transgressed, and therefore should have paid The penalty, however hard, in silence.  MELCHTHAL. Was I to brook the fellow's saucy words? \"That if the peasant must have bread to eat; Why, let him go and draw the plough himself!\" It cut me to the very soul to see My oxen, noble creatures, when the knave Unyoked them from the plough. As though they felt The wrong, they lowed and butted with their horns. On this I could contain myself no longer, And, overcome by passion, struck him down.  FURST. Oh, we old men can scarce command ourselves! And can we wonder youth shall break its bounds?  MELCHTHAL. I'm only sorry for my father's sake! To be away from him, that needs so much My fostering care! The governor detests him, Because he hath, whene'er occasion served, Stood stoutly up for right and liberty. Therefore they'll bear him hard--the poor old man! And there is none to shield him from their gripe. Come what come may, I must go home again.  FURST. Compose yourself, and wait in patience till We get some tidings o'er from Unterwald. Away! away! I hear a knock! Perhaps A message from the viceroy! Get thee in! You are not safe from Landenberger's [6] arm In Uri, for these tyrants pull together.  MELCHTHAL. They teach us Switzers what we ought to do.  FURST. Away! I'll call you when the coast is clear.     [MELCHTHAL retires.  Unhappy youth! I dare not tell him all The evil that my boding heart predicts! Who's there? The door ne'er opens but I look For tidings of mishap. Suspicion lurks With darkling treachery in every nook. Even to our inmost rooms they force their way, These myrmidons of power; and soon we'll need To fasten bolts and bars upon our doors.

I shall consider what is best to do.  MARY. Sir, you shall know its import. In this letter I beg a favor, a great favor of her,-- That she herself will give me audience,--she Whom I have never seen. I have been summoned Before a court of men, whom I can ne'er Acknowledge as my peers--of men to whom My heart denies its confidence. The queen Is of my family, my rank, my sex; To her alone--a sister, queen, and woman-- Can I unfold my heart.  PAULET.             Too oft, my lady, Have you intrusted both your fate and honor To men less worthy your esteem than these.  MARY. I, in the letter, beg another favor, And surely naught but inhumanity Can here reject my prayer. These many years Have I, in prison, missed the church's comfort, The blessings of the sacraments--and she Who robs me of my freedom and my crown, Who seeks my very life, can never wish To shut the gates of heaven upon my soul.  PAULET. Whene'er you wish, the dean shall wait upon you.  MARY (interrupting him sharply). Talk to me not of deans. I ask the aid Of one of my own church--a Catholic priest.  PAULET. [That is against the published laws of England.  MARY. The laws of England are no rule for me. I am not England's subject; I have ne'er Consented to its laws, and will not bow Before their cruel and despotic sway. If 'tis your will, to the unheard-of rigor Which I have borne, to add this new oppression, I must submit to what your power ordains; Yet will I raise my voice in loud complaints.] I also wish a public notary, And secretaries, to prepare my will-- My sorrows and my prison's wretchedness Prey on my life--my days, I fear, are numbered-- I feel that I am near the gates of death.  PAULET. These serious contemplations well become you.  MARY. And know I then that some too ready hand May not abridge this tedious work of sorrow? I would indite my will and make disposal Of what belongs to me.  PAULET.             This liberty May be allowed to you, for England's queen Will not enrich herself by plundering you.  MARY. I have been parted from my faithful women, And from my servants; tell me, where are they? What is their fate? I can indeed dispense At present with their service, but my heart Will feel rejoiced to know these faithful ones Are not exposed to suffering and to want!  PAULET. Your servants have been cared for; [and again You shall behold whate'er is taken from you And all shall be restored in proper season.]                   [Going.  MARY. And will you leave my presence thus again, And not relieve my fearful, anxious heart From the fell torments of uncertainty? Thanks to the vigilance of your hateful spies, I am divided from the world; no voice Can reach me through these prison-walls; my fate Lies in the hands of those who wish my ruin. A month of dread suspense is passed already Since when the forty high commissioners Surprised me in this castle, and erected, With most unseemly haste, their dread tribunal; They forced me, stunned, amazed, and unprepared, Without an advocate, from memory, Before their unexampled court, to answer Their weighty charges, artfully arranged. They came like ghosts,--like ghosts they disappeared, And since that day all mouths are closed to me. In vain I seek to construe from your looks Which hath prevailed--my cause's innocence And my friends' zeal--or my foes' cursed counsel. Oh, break this silence! let me know the worst; What have I still to fear, and what to hope.  PAULET. Close your accounts with heaven.  MARY.                  From heaven I hope For mercy, sir; and from my earthly judges I hope, and still expect, the strictest justice.  PAULET. Justice, depend upon it, will be done you.  MARY. Is the suit ended, sir?  PAULET.              I cannot tell.  MARY. Am I condemned?  PAULET.          I cannot answer, lady.  MARY. [Sir, a good work fears not the light of day.  PAULET. The day will shine upon it, doubt it not.]  MARY. Despatch is here the fashion. Is it meant The murderer shall surprise me, like the judges?  PAULET. Still entertain that thought and he will find you Better prepared to meet your fate than they did.  MARY (after a pause). Sir, nothing can surprise me which a court Inspired by Burleigh's hate and Hatton's zeal, Howe'er unjust, may venture to pronounce: But I have yet to learn how far the queen Will dare in execution of the sentence.  PAULET. The sovereigns of England have no fear But for their conscience and their parliament. What justice hath decreed her fearless hand Will execute before the assembled world.    SCENE III.     The same. MORTIMER enters, and without paying attention    to the QUEEN, addresses PAULET.  MORTIMER. Uncle, you're sought for.     [He retires in the same manner. The QUEEN remarks it, and    turns towards PAULET, who is about to follow him.  MARY.               Sir, one favor more If you have aught to say to me--from you I can bear much--I reverence your gray hairs; But cannot bear that young man's insolence; Spare me in future his unmannered rudeness.  PAULET. I prize him most for that which makes you hate him He is not, truly, one of those poor fools Who melt before a woman's treacherous tears. He has seen much--has been to Rheims and Paris, And brings us back his true old English heart. Lady, your cunning arts are lost on him.                     [Exit.    SCENE IV.     MARY, KENNEDY.  KENNEDY. And dare the ruffian venture to your face Such language! Oh, 'tis hard--'tis past endurance.  MARY (lost in reflection). In the fair moments of our former splendor We lent to flatterers a too willing ear;-- It is but just, good Hannah, we should now Be forced to hear the bitter voice of censure.  KENNEDY. So downcast, so depressed, my dearest lady! You, who before so gay, so full of hope, Were used to comfort me in my distress; More gracious were the task to check your mirth Than chide your heavy sadness.  MARY.                 Well I know him-- It is the bleeding Darnley's royal shade, Rising in anger from his darksome grave And never will he make his peace with me Until the measures of my woes be full.  KENNEDY. What thoughts are these--  MARY.              Thou may'st forget it, Hannah; But I've a faithful memory--'tis this day Another wretched anniversary Of that regretted, that unhappy deed-- Which I must celebrate with fast and penance.  KENNEDY. Dismiss at length in peace this evil spirit. The penitence of many a heavy year, Of many a suffering, has atoned the deed; The church, which holds the key of absolution, Pardons the crime, and heaven itself's appeased.  MARY. This long-atoned crime arises fresh And bleeding from its lightly-covered grave; My husband's restless spirit seeks revenge; No sacred bell can exorcise, no host In priestly hands dismiss it to his tomb.  KENNEDY. You did not murder him; 'twas done by others.  MARY. But it was known to me; I suffered it, And lured him with my smiles to death's embrace.  KENNEDY. Your youth extenuates your guilt. You were Of tender years.  MARY.          So tender, yet I drew This heavy guilt upon my youthful head.  KENNEDY. You were provoked by direst injuries, And by the rude presumption of the man, Whom out of darkness, like the hand of heaven, Your love drew forth, and raised above all others. Whom through your bridal chamber you conducted Up to your throne, and with your lovely self, And your hereditary crown, distinguished [Your work was his existence, and your grace Bedewed him like the gentle rains of heaven.] Could he forget that his so splendid lot Was the creation of your generous love? Yet did he, worthless as he was, forget it. With base suspicions, and with brutal manners, He wearied your affections, and became An object to you of deserved disgust: The illusion, which till now had overcast Your judgment, vanished; angrily you fled His foul embrace, and gave him up to scorn. And did he seek again to win your love? Your favor? Did he e'er implore your pardon? Or fall in deep repentance at your feet? No; the base wretch defied you; he, who was Your bounty's creature, wished to play your king, [And strove, through fear, to force your inclination.] Before your eyes he had your favorite singer, Poor Rizzio, murdered; you did but avenge With blood the bloody deed----  MARY.                And bloodily, I fear, too soon 'twill be avenged on me: You seek to comfort me, and you condemn me.  KENNEDY. You were, when you consented to this deed, No more yourself; belonged not to yourself; The madness of a frantic love possessed you, And bound you to a terrible seducer, The wretched Bothwell. That despotic man Ruled you with shameful, overbearing will, And with his philters and his hellish arts Inflamed your passions.  MARY.              All the arts he used Were man's superior strength and woman's weakness.  KENNEDY. No, no, I say. The most pernicious spirits Of hell he must have summoned to his aid, To cast this mist before your waking senses. Your ear no more was open to the voice Of friendly warning, and your eyes were shut To decency; soft female bashfulness Deserted you; those cheeks, which were before The seat of virtuous, blushing modesty, Glowed with the flames of unrestrained desire. You cast away the veil of secrecy, And the flagitious daring of the man O'ercame your natural coyness: you exposed Your shame, unblushingly, to public gaze: You let the murderer, whom the people followed With curses, through the streets of Edinburgh, Before you bear the royal sword of Scotland In triumph. You begirt your parliament With armed bands; and by this shameless farce, There, in the very temple of great justice, You forced the judges of the land to clear The murderer of his guilt. You went still further-- O God!  MARY.     Conclude--nay, pause not--say for this I gave my hand in marriage at the altar.  KENNEDY. O let an everlasting silence veil That dreadful deed: the heart revolts at it. A crime to stain the darkest criminal! Yet you are no such lost "]]]
