But he said nothing. He looked at the stove, and dog's-eared the Thucydides.  \"What a worm you are, always staying in!\" said Stanning.  \"I caught a cold watching the match yesterday.\"  \"You're as flabby as--\" Stanning looked round for a simile, \"as a dough-nut. Why don't you take some exercise?\"  \"I'm going to play fives, I think. I do need some exercise.\"  \"Fives? Why don't you play footer?\"  \"I haven't time. I want to work.\"  \"What rot. I'm not doing a stroke.\"  Stanning seemed to derive a spiritual pride from this admission.  \"Tell you what, then,\" said Stanning, \"I'll play you tomorrow after school.\"  Sheen looked a shade more uncomfortable, but he made an effort, and declined the invitation.  \"I shall probably be playing Drummond,\" he said.  \"Oh, all right,\" said Stanning. \"_I_ don't care. Play whom you like.\"  There was a pause.  \"As a matter of fact,\" resumed Stanning, \"what I came here for was to tell you about last night. I got out, and went to Mitchell's. Why didn't you come? Didn't you get my note? I sent a kid with it.\"  Mitchell was a young gentleman of rich but honest parents, who had left the school at Christmas. He was in his father's office, and lived in his father's house on the outskirts of the town. From time to time his father went up to London on matters connected with business, leaving him alone in the house. On these occasions Mitchell the younger would write to Stanning, with whom when at school he had been on friendly terms; and Stanning, breaking out of his house after everybody had gone to bed, would make his way to the Mitchell residence, and spend a pleasant hour or so there. Mitchell senior owned Turkish cigarettes and a billiard table. Stanning appreciated both. There was also a piano, and Stanning had brought Sheen with him one night to play it. The getting-out and the subsequent getting-in had nearly whitened Sheen's hair, and it was only by a series of miracles that he had escaped detection. Once, he felt, was more than enough; and when a fag from Appleby's had brought him Stanning's note, containing an invitation to a second jaunt of the kind, he had refused to be lured into the business again.  \"Yes, I got the note,\" he said.  \"Then why didn't you come? Mitchell was asking where you were.\"  \"It's so beastly risky.\"  \"Risky! Rot.\"  \"We should get sacked if we were caught.\"  \"Well, don't get caught, then.\"  Sheen registered an internal vow that he would not.  \"He wanted us to go again on Monday. Will you come?\"  \"I--don't think I will, Stanning,\" said Sheen. \"It isn't worth it.\"  \"You mean you funk it. That's what's the matter with you.\"  \"Yes, I do,\" admitted Sheen.  As a rule--in stories--the person who owns that he is afraid gets unlimited applause and adulation, and feels a glow of conscious merit. But with Sheen it was otherwise. The admission made him if possible, more uncomfortable than he had been before.  \"Mitchell will be sick,\" said Stanning.  Sheen said nothing.  Stanning changed the subject.  \"Well, at anyrate,\" he said, \"give us some tea. You seem to have been victualling for a siege.\"  \"I'm awfully sorry,\" said Sheen, turning a deeper shade of red and experiencing a redoubled attack of the warm shooting, \"but the fact is, I'm waiting for Drummond.\"  Stanning got up, and expressed his candid opinion of Drummond in a few words.  He said more. He described Sheen, too in unflattering terms.  \"Look here,\" he said, \"you may think it jolly fine to drop me just because you've got to know Drummond a bit, but you'll be sick enough that you've done it before you've finished.\"  \"It isn't that--\" began Sheen.  \"I don't care what it is. You slink about trying to avoid me all day, and you won't do a thing I ask you to do.\"  \"But you see--\"  \"Oh, shut up,\" said Stanning.     III  SHEEN RECEIVES VISITORS AND ADVICE   While Sheen had been interviewing Stanning, in study twelve, farther down the passage, Linton and his friend Dunstable, who was in Day's house, were discussing ways and means. Like Stanning, Dunstable had demanded tea, and had been informed that there was none for him.  \"Well, you are a bright specimen, aren't you?\" said Dunstable, seating himself on the table which should have been groaning under the weight of cake and biscuits. \"I should like to know where you expect to go to. You lure me in here, and then have the cheek to tell me you haven't got anything to eat. What have you done with it all?\"  \"There was half a cake--\"  \"Bring it on.\"  \"Young Menzies bagged it after the match yesterday. His brother came down with the Oxford A team, and he had to give him tea in his study. Then there were some biscuits--\"  \"What's the matter with biscuits? _They're_ all right. Bring them on. Biscuits forward. Show biscuits.\"  \"Menzies took them as well.\"  Dunstable eyed him sorrowfully.  \"You always were a bit of a maniac,\" he said, \"but I never thought you were quite such a complete gibberer as to let Menzies get away with all your grub. Well, the only thing to do is to touch him for tea. He owes us one. Come on.\"  They proceeded down the passage and stopped at the door of study three.  \"Hullo!\" said Menzies, as they entered.  \"We've come to tea,\" said Dunstable. \"Cut the satisfying sandwich. Let's see a little more of that hissing urn of yours, Menzies. Bustle about, and be the dashing host.\"  \"I wasn't expecting you.\"  \"I can't help your troubles,\" said Dunstable.  \"I've not got anything. I was thinking of coming to you, Linton.\"  \"Where's that cake?\"  \"Finished. My brother simply walked into it.\"  \"Greed,\" said Dunstable unkindly, \"seems to be the besetting sin of the Menzies'. Well, what are you going to do about it? I don't wish to threaten, but I'm a demon when I'm roused. Being done out of my tea is sure to rouse me. And owing to unfortunate accident of being stonily broken, I can't go to the shop. You're responsible for the slump in provisions, Menzies, and you must see us through this. What are you going to do about it?\"  \"Do either of you chaps know Sheen at all?\"  \"I don't,\" said Linton. \"Not to speak to.\"  \"You can't expect us to know all your shady friends,\" said Dunstable. \"Why?\"  \"He's got a tea on this evening. If you knew him well enough, you might borrow something from him. I met Herbert in the dinner-hour carrying in all sorts of things to his study. Still, if you don't know him--\"  \"Don't let a trifle of that sort stand in the way,\" said Dunstable. \"Which is his study?\"  \"Come on, Linton,\" said Dunstable. \"Be a man, and lead the way. Go in as if he'd invited us. Ten to one he'll think he did, if you don't spoil the thing by laughing.\"  \"What, invite ourselves to tea?\" asked Linton, beginning to grasp the idea.  \"That's it. Sheen's the sort of ass who won't do a thing. Anyhow, its worth trying. Smith in our house got a tea out of him that way last term. Coming, Menzies?\"  \"Not much. I hope he kicks you out.\"  \"Come on, then, Linton. If Menzies cares to chuck away a square meal, let him.\"  Thus, no sooner had the door of Sheen's study closed upon Stanning than it was opened again to admit Linton and Dunstable.  \"Well,\" said Linton, affably, \"here we are.\"  \"Hope we're not late,\" said Dunstable. \"You said somewhere about five. It's just struck. Shall we start?\"  He stooped, and took the kettle from the stove.  \"Don't you bother,\" he said to Sheen, who had watched this manoeuvre with an air of amazement, \"I'll do all the dirty work.\"  \"But--\" began Sheen.  \"That's all right,\" said Dunstable soothingly. \"I like it.\"  The intellectual pressure of the affair was too much for Sheen. He could not recollect having invited Linton, with whom he had exchanged only about a dozen words that term, much less Dunstable, whom he merely knew by sight. Yet here they were, behaving like honoured guests. It was plain that there was a misunderstanding somewhere, but he shrank from grappling with it. He did not want to hurt their feelings. It would be awkward enough if they discovered their mistake for themselves.  So he exerted himself nervously to play the host, and the first twinge of remorse which Linton felt came when Sheen pressed upon him a bag of biscuits which, he knew, could not have cost less than one and sixpence a pound. His heart warmed to one who could do the thing in such style.  Dunstable, apparently, was worried by no scruples. He leaned back easily in his chair, and kept up a bright flow of conversation.  \"You're not looking well, Sheen,\" he said. \"You ought to take more exercise. Why don't you come down town with us one of these days and do a bit of canvassing? It's a rag. Linton lost a tooth at it the other day. We're going down on Saturday to do a bit more.\"  \"Oh!\" said Sheen, politely.  \"We shall get one or two more chaps to help next time. It isn't good enough, only us two. We had four great beefy hooligans on to us when Linton got his tooth knocked out. We had to run. There's a regular gang of them going about the town, now that the election's on. A red-headed fellow, who looks like a butcher, seems to boss the show. They call him Albert. He'll have to be slain one of these days, for the credit of the school. I should like to get Drummond on to him.\"  \"I was expecting Drummond to tea,\" said Sheen.  \"He's running and passing with the fifteen,\" said Linton. \"He ought to be in soon. Why, here he is. Hullo, Drummond!\"  \"Hullo!\" said the newcomer, looking at his two fellow-visitors as if he were surprised to see them there.  \"How were the First?\" asked Dunstable.  \"Oh, rotten. Any tea left?\"  Conversation flagged from this point, and shortly afterwards Dunstable and Linton went.  \"Come and tea with me some time,\" said Linton.  \"Oh, thanks,\" said Sheen. \"Thanks awfully.\"  \"It was rather a shame,\" said Linton to Dunstable, as they went back to their study, \"rushing him like that. I shouldn't wonder if he's"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6932"],["title","Pictures Every Child Should Know (#1)"],["body","8-1820  Index    ILLUSTRATIONS   FRONTISPIECE  The Avenue, Middleharnis, Holland--_Hobbema_  Madonna of the Sack--_Andrea del Sarto_  Daniel--_Michael Angelo (Buonarroti)_  The Isle of the Dead--_Arnold Böcklin_  The Horse Fair--_Rosa Bonheur_  Spring--_Alessandro Botticelli_  The Hay Wain--_John Constable_  A Family Picture--_John Singleton Copley_  The Holy Night--_Correggio (Antonio Allegri)_  Dance of the Nymphs--_Jean Baptiste Camille Corot_  The Virgin as Consoler--_Wm.

This man's father was a tailor; and the artist was named after his father's profession. He was in fact \"the Tailor's Andrea,\" and his father's name was Angelo.  One story of this brilliant painter which reads from first to last like a romance has been told by the poet, Browning, who dresses up fact so as to smother it a little, but there is truth at the bottom.  Andrea married a wife whom he loved tenderly. She had a beautiful face that seemed full of spirituality and feeling, and Andrea painted it over and over again. The artist loved his work and dreamed always of the great things that he should do; but he was so much in love with his wife that he was dependent on her smile for all that he did which was well done, and her frown plunged him into despair.  Andrea's wife cared nothing for his genius, painting did not interest her, and she had no worthy ambition for her husband, but she loved fine clothes and good living, and so encouraged him enough to keep him earning these things for her. As soon as some money was made she would persuade him to work no more till it was spent; and even when he had made agreements to paint certain pictures for which he was paid in advance she would torment him till he gave all of his time to her whims, neglected his duty and spent the money for which he had rendered no service. Thus in time he became actually dishonest, as we shall see. It is a sad sort of story to tell of so brilliant a young man.  Andrea was born in the Gualfonda quarter of Florence, and there is some record of his ancestors for a hundred years before that, although their lives were quite unimportant. Andrea was one of four children, and as usual with Italians of artistic temperament, he was set to work under the eye of a goldsmith. This craftsmanship of a fine order was as near to art as a man could get with any certainty of making his living. It was a time when the Italian world bedecked itself with rare golden trinkets, wreaths for women's hair, girdles, brooches, and the like, and the finest skill was needed to satisfy the taste. Thus it required talent of no mean order for a man to become a successful goldsmith.  Andrea did not like the work, and instead of fashioning ornaments from his master's models he made original drawings which did not do at all in a shop where an apprentice was expected to earn his salt. Certain fashions had to be followed and people did not welcome fantastic or new designs. Because of this, Andrea was early put out of his master's shop and set to learn the only business that he could be got to learn, painting. This meant for him a very different teacher from the goldsmith.  The artist may be said to have been his own master, because, even when he was apprenticed to a painter he was taught less than he already knew.  That first teacher was Barile, a coarse and unpleasing man, as well as an incapable one; but he was fair minded, after a fashion, and put Andrea into the way of finding better help. After a few years under the direction of Piero di Cosimo, Andrea and a friend, Francia Bigio, decided to set up shop for themselves.  The two devoted friends pitched their tent in the Piazza del Grano, and made a meagre beginning out of which great things were to grow. They began a series of pictures which was to lead at least one of them to fame. It was in the little Piazza, del Grano studio that the \"Baptism of Christ\" was painted, a partnership work that had been planned in the Campagnia dello Scalzo.  \"The Baptism\" was not much of a picture as great pictures go, but it was a beginning and it was looked at and talked about, which was something at a time when Titian and Leonardo had set the standard of great work. In the Piazza del Grano, Andrea and his friend lived in the stables of the Tuscan Grand Dukes, with a host of other fine artists, and they had gay times together.  Andrea was a shy youth, a little timid, and by no means vain of his own work, but he painted with surprising swiftness and sureness, and had a very brilliant imagination. Its was his main trouble that he had more imagination than true manhood; he sacrificed everything good to his imagination.  After the partnership with his friend, he undertook to paint some frescoes independently, and that work earned for him the name of \"Andrea senza Errori\"--Andrea the Unerring. Then, as now, each artist had his own way of working, and Andrea's was perhaps the most difficult of all, yet the most genius-like. There were those, Michael Angelo for example, who laid in backgrounds for their paintings; but Andrea painted his subject upon the wet plaster, precisely as he meant it to be when finished.  He was unlike the moody Michael Angelo; unlike the gentle Raphael; unlike the fastidious Van Dyck who came long afterward; he was hail-fellow-well-met among his associates, though often given over to dreaminess. He belonged to a jolly club named the \"Kettle Club,\" literally, the Company of the Kettle; and to another called \"The Trowel,\" both suggesting an all around good time and much good fellowship The members of these clubs were expected to contribute to their wonderful suppers, and Andrea on one occasion made a great temple, in imitation of the Baptistry, of jelly with columns of sausages, white birds and pigeons represented the choir and priests. Besides being \"Andrew the Unerring,\" and a \"Merry Andrew,\" he was also the \"Tailor's Andrew,\" a man in short upon whom a nickname sat comfortably. He helped to make the history of the \"Company of the Kettle,\" for he recited and probably composed a touching ballad called \"The Battle of the Mice and the Frogs,\" which doubtless had its origin in a poem of Homer's. But all at once, in the midst of his gay careless life came his tragedy; he fell in love with a hatter's wife. This was quite bad enough, but worse was to come, for the hatter shortly died, and the widow was free to marry Andrea.  After his marriage Andrea began painting a series of Madonnas, seemingly for no better purpose than to exhibit his wife's beauty over and over again. He lost his ambition and forgot everything but his love for this unworthy woman. She was entirely commonplace, incapable of inspiring true genius or honesty of purpose.  A great art critic, Vasari, who was Andrea's pupil during this time, has written that the wife, Lucretia, was abominable in every way. A vixen, she tormented Andrea from morning till night with her bitter tongue. She did not love him in the least, but only what his money could buy for her, for she was extravagant, and drove the sensitive artist to his grave while she outlived him forty years.  About the time of the artist's marriage he painted one fresco, \"The Procession of the Magi,\" in which he placed a very splendid substitute for his wife, namely himself. Afterward he painted the Dead Christ which found its way to France and it laid the foundation for Andrea's wrongdoing. This picture was greatly admired by the King of France who above all else was a lover of art. Francis I. asked Andrea to go to his court, as he had commissions for him. He made Andrea a money offer and to court he went.  He took a pupil with him, but he left his wife at home. At the court of Francis I. he was received with great honours, and amid those new and gracious surroundings, away from the tantalising charms of his wife and her shrewish tongue, he began to have an honest ambition to do great things. His work for France was undertaken with enthusiasm, but no sooner was he settled"]]]
