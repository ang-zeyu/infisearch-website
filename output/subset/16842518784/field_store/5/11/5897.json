The picture, as it now exists, is a bitter satire on our love. Venus in this abstract North, in this icy Christian world, has to creep into huge black furs so as not to catch cold—”  Severin laughed, and lighted a fresh cigarette.  Just then the door opened and an attractive, stoutish, blonde girl entered. She had wise, kindly eyes, was dressed in black silk, and brought us cold meat and eggs with our tea. Severin took one of the latter, and decapitated it with his knife.  “Didn’t I tell you that I want them soft-boiled?” he cried with a violence that made the young woman tremble.  “But my dear Sevtchu—” she said timidly.  “Sevtchu, nothing,” he yelled, “you are to obey, obey, do you understand?” and he tore the _kantchuk_1 which was hanging beside the weapons from its hook.  [Footnote 1: A long whip with a short handle.]   The woman fled from the chamber quickly and timidly like a doe.  “Just wait, I’ll get you yet,” he called after her.  “But Severin,” I said placing my hand on his arm, “how can you treat a pretty young woman thus?”  “Look at the woman,” he replied, blinking humorously with his eyes. “Had I flattered her, she would have cast the noose around my neck, but now, when I bring her up with the _kantchuk_, she adores me.”  “Nonsense!”  “Nonsense, nothing, that is the way you have to break in women.”  “Well, if you like it, live like a pasha in your harem, but don’t lay down theories for me—”  “Why not,” he said animatedly. “Goethe’s ‘you must be hammer or anvil’ is absolutely appropriate to the relation between man and woman. Didn’t Lady Venus in your dream prove that to you? Woman’s power lies in man’s passion, and she knows how to use it, if man doesn’t understand himself. He has only one choice: to be the _tyrant_ over or the _slave_ of woman. As soon as he gives in, his neck is under the yoke, and the lash will soon fall upon him.”  “Strange maxims!”  “Not maxims, but experiences,” he replied, nodding his head, “_I have actually felt the lash_. I am cured. Do you care to know how?”  He rose, and got a small manuscript from his massive desk, and put it in front of me.  “You have already asked about the picture. I have long owed you an explanation. Here—read!”  Severin sat down by the chimney with his back toward me, and seemed to dream with open eyes. Silence had fallen again, and again the fire sang in the chimney, and the samovar and the cricket in the old walls. I opened the manuscript and read:  CONFESSIONS OF A SUPERSENSUAL MAN.   The margin of the manuscript bore as motto a variation of the well-known lines from _Faust_:  “Thou supersensual sensual wooer A woman leads you by the nose.” —MEPHISTOPHELES.   I turned the title-page and read: “What follows has been compiled from my diary of that period, because it is impossible ever frankly to write of one’s past, but in this way everything retains its fresh colors, the colors of the present.”  Gogol, the Russian Molière, says—where? well, somewhere—“the real comic muse is the one under whose laughing mask tears roll down.”  A wonderful saying.  So I have a very curious feeling as I am writing all this down. The atmosphere seems filled with a stimulating fragrance of flowers, which overcomes me and gives me a headache. The smoke of the fireplace curls and condenses into figures, small gray-bearded kokolds that mockingly point their finger at me. Chubby-cheeked cupids ride on the arms of my chair and on my knees. I have to smile involuntarily, even laugh aloud, as I am writing down my adventures. Yet I am not writing with ordinary ink, but with red blood that drips from my heart. All its wounds long scarred over have opened and it throbs and hurts, and now and then a tear falls on the paper.  The days creep along sluggishly in the little Carpathian health-resort. You see no one, and no one sees you. It is boring enough to write idyls. I would have leisure here to supply a whole gallery of paintings, furnish a theater with new pieces for an entire season, a dozen virtuosos with concertos, trios, and duos, but—what am I saying—the upshot of it all is that I don’t do much more than to stretch the canvas, smooth the bow, line the scores. For I am—no false modesty, Friend Severin; you can lie to others, but you don’t quite succeed any longer in lying to yourself—I am nothing but a dilettante, a dilettante in painting, in poetry, in music, and several other of the so-called unprofitable arts, which, however, at present secure for their masters the income of a cabinet minister, or even that of a minor potentate. Above all else I am a dilettante in life.  Up to the present I have lived as I have painted and written poetry. I never got far beyond the preparation, the plan, the first act, the first stanza. There are people like that who begin everything, and never finish anything. I am such a one.  But what am I saying?  To the business in hand.  I lie in my window, and the miserable little town, which fills me with despondency, really seems infinitely full of poetry. How wonderful the outlook upon the blue wall of high mountains interwoven with golden sunlight; mountain-torrents weave through them like ribbons of silver! How clear and blue the heavens into which snowcapped crags project; how green and fresh the forested slopes; the meadows on which small herds graze, down to the yellow billows of grain where reapers stand and bend over and rise up again.  The house in which I live stands in a sort of park, or forest, or wilderness, whatever one wants to call it, and is very solitary.  Its sole inhabitants are myself, a widow from Lemberg, and Madame Tartakovska, who runs the house, a little old woman, who grows older and smaller each day. There are also an old dog that limps on one leg, and a young cat that continually plays with a ball of yarn. This ball of yarn, I believe, belongs to the widow.  She is said to be really beautiful, this widow, still very young, twenty-four at the most, and very rich. She dwells in the first story, and I on the ground floor. She always keeps the green blinds drawn, and has a balcony entirely overgrown with green climbing-plants. I for my part down below have a comfortable, intimate arbor of honeysuckle, in which I read and write and paint and sing like a bird among the twigs. I can look up on the balcony. Sometimes I actually do so, and then from time to time a white gown gleams between the dense green network.  Really the beautiful woman up there doesn’t interest me very much, for I am in love with someone else, and terribly unhappy at that; far more unhappy than the Knight of Toggenburg or the Chevalier in Manon l’Escault, because the object of my adoration is of stone.  In the garden, in the tiny wilderness, there is a graceful little meadow on which a couple of deer graze peacefully. On this meadow is a stone statue of Venus, the original of which, I believe, is in Florence. This Venus is the most beautiful woman I have ever seen in all my life.  That, however, does not signify much, for I have seen few beautiful women, or rather few women at all. In love too, I am a dilettante who never got beyond the preparation, the first act.  But why talk in superlatives, as if something that is beautiful could be surpassed?  It is sufficient to say that this Venus is beautiful. I love her passionately with a morbid intensity; madly as one can only love a woman who never responds to our love with anything but an eternally uniform, eternally calm, stony smile. I literally adore her.  I often lie reading under the leafy covering of a young birch when the sun broods over the forest. Often I visit that cold, cruel mistress of mine by night and lie on my knees before her, with the face pressed against the cold pedestal on which her feet rest, and my prayers go up to her.  The rising moon, which just now is waning, produces an indescribable effect. It seems to hover among the trees and submerges the meadow in its gleam of silver. The goddess stands as if transfigured, and seems to bathe in the soft moonlight.  Once when I was returning from my devotions by one of the walks leading to the house, I suddenly saw a woman’s figure, white as stone, under the illumination of the moon and separated from me merely by a screen of trees. It seemed as if the beautiful woman of marble had taken pity on me, become alive, and followed me. I was seized by a nameless fear, my heart threatened to burst, and instead—  Well, I am a dilettante. As always, I broke down at the second stanza; rather, on the contrary, I did not break down, but ran away as fast as my legs would carry me.  *       *       *       *       *  What an accident! Through a Jew, dealing in photographs I secured a picture of my ideal. It is a small reproduction of Titian’s “Venus with the Mirror.” What a woman! I want to write a poem, but instead, I take the reproduction, and write on it: _Venus in Furs_.  You are cold, while you yourself fan flames. By all means wrap yourself in your despotic furs, there is no one to whom they are more appropriate, cruel goddess of love and of beauty!—After a while I add a few verses from Goethe, which I recently found in his paralipomena to _Faust_.  TO AMOR   “The pair of wings a fiction are, The arrows, they are naught but claws, The wreath conceals the little horns, For without any doubt he is Like all the gods of ancient Greece Only a devil in disguise.”   Then I put the picture before me on my table, supporting it with a book, and looked at it.  I was enraptured and at the same time filled with a strange fear by the cold coquetry with which this magnificent woman draped her charms in her furs of dark sable; by the severity and hardness which lay in this cold marble-like face. Again I took my pen in hand, and wrote the following words:  “To love, to be loved, what happiness! And yet how the glamour of this pales in"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6870"],["title","Why We Are at War : Messages to the Congress January to April 1917 (#1)"],["body","upon whose concert peace will depend.  Equality of territory or of resources there, of course, cannot be; nor any other sort of equality not gained in the ordinary peaceful and legitimate development of the peoples themselves.  But no one asks or expects anything more than an equality of rights.  Mankind is looking now for freedom of life, not for equipoises of power.  And there is a deeper thing involved than even equality of rights among organized nations.  No peace can last, or ought to last, which does not recognize and accept the principle that Governments derive all their just powers from the consent of the governed, and that no right anywhere exists to hand people about from sovereignty to sovereignty as if they were property.  I take it for granted, for instance, if I may venture upon a single example, that statesmen everywhere are agreed that there should be a united, independent, and autonomous Poland, and that henceforth inviolable security of life, of worship, and of industrial and social development should be guaranteed to all peoples who have lived hitherto under the power of Governments devoted to a faith and purpose hostile to their own.  I speak of this, not because of any desire to exalt an abstract political principle which has always been held very dear by those who have sought to build up liberty in America, but for the same reason that I have spoken of the other conditions of peace which seem to me clearly indispensable--because I wish frankly to uncover realities.   CRUSHED PEOPLES WILL REVOLT  Any peace which does not recognize and accept this principle will inevitably be upset.  It will not rest upon the affections or the convictions of mankind.  The ferment of spirit of whole populations will fight subtly and constantly against it, and all the world will sympathize.  The world can be at peace only if its life is stable, and there can be no stability where the will is in rebellion, where there is not tranquillity of spirit and a sense of justice, of freedom, and of right.  So far as practicable, moreover, every great people now struggling toward a full development of its resources and of its powers should be assured a direct outlet to the great highways of the sea.  Where this cannot be done by the cession of territory, it can no doubt be done by the neutralization of direct rights of way under the general guarantee which will assure the peace itself.  With a right comity of arrangement no nation need be shut away from free access to the open paths of the world's commerce.  And the paths of the sea must alike in law and in fact be free. The freedom of the seas is the sine qua non of peace, equality, and cooperation.  No doubt a somewhat radical reconsideration of many of the rules of international practice hitherto sought to be established may be necessary in order to make the seas indeed free and common in practically all circumstances for the use of mankind, but the motive for such changes is convincing and compelling.  There can be no trust or intimacy between the peoples of the world without them.  The free, constant, unthreatened intercourse of nations is an essential part of the process of peace and of development.  It need not be difficult to define or to secure the freedom of the seas if the Governments of the world sincerely desire to come to an agreement concerning it.   REQUIRES LIMITATION OF ARMAMENTS  It is a problem closely connected with the limitation of naval armaments and the cooperation of the navies of the world in keeping the seas at once free and safe.  And the question of limiting naval armaments opens the wider and perhaps more difficult question of the limitation of armies and of all programs of military preparation.  Difficult and delicate as these questions are, they must be faced with the utmost candor and decided in a spirit of real accommodation if peace is to come with healing in its wings and come to stay.  Peace cannot be had without concession and sacrifice.  There can be no sense of safety and equality among the nations if great preponderating armies are henceforth to continue here and there to be built up and maintained.  The statesmen of the world must plan for peace, and nations must adjust and accommodate their policy to it as they have planned for war and made ready for pitiless contest and rivalry.  The question of armaments, whether on land or sea, is the most immediately and intensely practical question connected with the future fortunes of nations and of mankind.  I have spoken upon these great matters without reserve and with the utmost explicitness because it has seemed to me to be necessary if the world's yearning desire for peace was anywhere to find free voice and utterance.  Perhaps I am the only person in high authority among all the peoples of the world who is at liberty to speak and hold nothing back.  I am speaking as an individual, and yet I am speaking also, of course, as the responsible head of a great Government, and I feel confident that I have said what the people of the United States would wish me to say.  May I not add that I hope and believe that I am in effect speaking for liberals and friends of humanity in every nation and of every program of liberty?  I would fain believe that I am speaking for the silent mass of mankind everywhere who have as yet had no place or opportunity to speak their real hearts out concerning the death and ruin they see to have come already upon the persons and the homes they hold most dear.   SEES WORLD-WIDE MONROE DOCTRINE  And in holding out the expectation that the people and Government of the United States will join the other civilized nations of the world in guaranteeing the permanence of peace upon such terms as I have named, I speak with the greater boldness and confidence because it is clear to every man who can think that there is in this promise no breach in either our traditions or our policy as a nation, but a fulfilment, rather, of all that we have professed or striven for.  I am proposing, as it were, that the nations should with one accord adopt the doctrine of President Monroe as the doctrine of the world; that no nation should seek to extend its policy over any other nation or people, but that every people should be left free to determine its own policy, its own way of development, unhindered, unthreatened, unafraid, the little along with the great and powerful.  I am proposing that all nations henceforth avoid entangling alliances which would draw them into competitions of power, catch them in a net of intrigue and selfish rivalry, and disturb their own affairs with influences intruded from without.  There is no entangling alliance in a concert of power.  When all unite to act in the same sense and with the same purpose, all act in the common interest and are free to live their own lives under a common protection.  I am proposing government by the consent of the governed; that freedom of the seas which in international conference after conference representatives of the United States have urged with the eloquence of those who are the convinced disciples of liberty; and that moderation of armaments which makes of armies and navies a power for order merely, not an instrument of aggression or of selfish violence.  These are American principles, American policies.  We can stand for no others.  And they are also the principles and policies of forward-looking men and women everywhere, of every modern nation, of every enlightened community.  They are the principles of mankind, and must prevail.     II  THE SEVERANCE OF DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS WITH GERMANY  Message to the Congress February 3, 1917    Gentlemen of the Congress:  The Imperial German Government, on the 31st of January, announced to this Government and to the Governments of the other neutral nations that on and after the first day of February, the present month, it would adopt a policy with regard to the use of submarines against all shipping seeking to pass through certain designated areas of the high seas to which it is clearly my duty to call your attention.  Let me remind the Congress that on the 18th of April last, in view of the sinking on the 24th of March of the cross-Channel passenger-steamer Sussex by a German submarine, without summons or warning, and the consequent loss of the lives of several citizens of the United States who were passengers aboard her, this Government addressed a note to the Imperial German Government in which it made the following declaration:      If it is still the purpose of the Imperial German Government to     prosecute relentless and indiscriminate warfare against vessels     of commerce by the use of submarines without regard to what the     Government of the United States must consider the sacred and     indisputable rules of international law and the universally     recognized dictates of humanity, the Government of the United States     is at last forced to the conclusion that there is but one course it     can pursue.  Unless the German Government should now immediately     declare and effect an abandonment of its present methods of submarine     warfare against passenger and freight-carrying vessels the Government     of the United States can have no choice but to sever diplomatic     relations with the German Empire altogether.   GERMANY'S U-BOAT PLEDGE  In reply to this declaration the German Government gave this Government the following assurances:      The German Government is prepared to do its utmost to confine the     operations of war for the rest of its duration to the fighting     forces of the belligerents, thereby insuring the freedom of the seas,     a principle upon which the German Government believes, now as before,     to be in agreement with the Government of the United States.      The German Government, guided by this idea, notifies the Government     of the United States that the German naval forces have received the     following orders:      In accordance"]]]
