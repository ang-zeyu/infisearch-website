He went around to the driver's side and got behind the wheel and drove away. Harry looked back. Pete was leading Plum after them; not riding him, walking him. \"He sure must like horses,\" he said.  \"Yes.\"  \"Am I going to jail?\"  \"No.\"  \"Where then?\"  \"The doctor's place.\"  They stopped in front of the new house two miles past Dugan's farm. Except he'd never seen it before. Or had he? Everyone seemed to know about it--or was everyone only Edna and the Shanks?  He got out of the car. The officer took his arm and led him up the path. Harry noticed that the new house was big.  When they came inside, he knew it wasn't like any house he'd ever seen or heard of. There was this long central passageway, and dozens of doors branched off it on both sides, and stairways went down from it in at least three places that he could see, and at the far end--a good two hundred yards away--a big ramp led upward. And it was all gray plaster walls and dull black floors and cold white lighting, like a hospital, or a modern factory, or maybe a government building. Except that he didn't see or hear people.  He did hear _something_; a low, rumbling noise. The further they came along the hall, the louder the rumbling grew. It seemed to be deep down somewhere.         *       *       *       *       *  They went through one of the doors on the right, into a windowless room. A thin little man with bald head and frameless glasses was there, putting on a white coat. His veiny hands shook. He looked a hundred years old. \"Where's Petey?\" he asked.  \"Pete's all right, Dad. Just leading a horse back to Burr's farm.\"  The old man sighed. \"I didn't know what form it would take. I expected one or two cases, but I couldn't predict whether it would be gradual or sudden, whether or not it would lead to violence.\"  \"No violence, Dad.\"  \"Fine, Stan.\" He looked at Harry. \"I'm going to give you a little treatment, Mr. Burr. It'll settle your nerves and make everything....\"  \"What happened to Davie?\" Harry asked, things pushing at his brain again.  Stan helped him up. \"Just step this way, Mr. Burr.\"  He didn't resist. He went through the second door into the room with the big chair. He sat down and let them strap his arms and legs and let them lower the metal thing over his head. He felt needles pierce his scalp and the back of his neck. He let them do what they wanted; he would let them kill him if they wanted. All he asked was one answer so as to know whether or not he was insane.  \"What happened to my son Davie?\"  The old man walked across the room and examined what looked like the insides of a dozen big radios. He turned, his hand on a switch.  \"Please,\" Harry whispered. \"Just tell me about my son.\"  The doctor blinked behind his glasses, and then his hand left the switch. \"Dead,\" he said, his voice a rustling of dried leaves. \"Like so many millions of others. Dead, when the bombs fell. Dead, as everyone knew they would be and no one did anything to prevent. Dead. Perhaps the whole world is dead--except for us.\"  Harry stared at him.         *       *       *       *       *  \"I can't take the time to explain it all. I have too much to do. Just three of us--myself and my two sons. My wife lost her mind. I should have helped her as I'm helping you.\"  \"I don't understand,\" Harry said. \"I remember people, and things, and where are they now? Dead? People can die, but farms, cities....\"  \"I haven't the time,\" the doctor repeated, voice rising. \"I have to run a world. Three of us, to run a world! I built it as best I could, but how large could I make it? The money. The years and years of work. The people calling me insane when they found out ... but a few giving me more money, and the work going on. And those few caught like everyone else, unprepared when the holocaust started, unprepared and unable to reach my world. So they died. As I knew they would. As they should have known they would.\"  Harry felt the rumbling beneath him. Engines?  \"You survived,\" the doctor said. \"Your wife. A few hundred others in the rural areas. One other family in your area. I survived because I lived for survival, like a mole deep in the earth, expecting the catastrophe every minute. I survived because I gave up living to survive.\" He laughed, high and thin.  His son said, \"Please, Dad....\"  \"No! I want to talk to someone _sane_! You and Petey and I--we're all insane, you know. Three years now, playing God, waiting for some land, any land, to become habitable. And knowing everything, and surrounded by people who are sane only because I made sure they would know nothing.\" He stepped forward, glaring at Harry. \"Now do you understand? I went across the country, picking up a few of the few left alive. Most were farmers, and even where some weren't I picked the farmers anyway. Because farmers are what we'll need, and all the rest can evolve later. I put you and the others, eighty-six all told, from every section of the country, on my world, the only uncontaminated land left. I gave you back your old lives. I couldn't give you big crops because we don't need big crops. We would only exhaust our limited soil with big crops. But I gave you vegetable gardens and livestock and, best of all, _sanity_! I wiped the insane moments from your minds. I gave you peace and consigned myself, my sons, my own wife....\"  He choked and stopped.  Stan ran across the room to the switch. Harry watched him, and his brain struggled with an impossible concept. He heard the engines and remembered the ocean on two sides; on four sides had he bothered to check south and east; on _all_ sides if that fence continued to curve inward. Ocean, and there was no ocean in Iowa.  And this wasn't Iowa.  _The explosions had ripped the world, and he'd tried to get to town to save Davie, and there'd been no town and there'd been no people and there'd been only death and poison in the air and even those few people left had begun to die, and then the truck with the huge trailer had come, the gleaming trailer with the little man and his trembling wife and his two sons...._         *       *       *       *       *  Suddenly, he understood. And understanding brought not peace but the greatest terror he'd ever known. He screamed, \"We're on....\" but the switch was thrown and there was no more speech. For an hour. Then he got out of the chair and said, \"Sure glad I took my wife's advice and came to see you, Doctor Hamming. I feel better already, and after only one.... What do you call these treatments?\"  \"Diathermy,\" the little doctor muttered.  Harry gave him a five-dollar bill. The doctor gave him two singles in change. \"That's certainly reasonable enough,\" Harry said.  The doctor nodded. \"There's a police officer in the hall. He'll drive you home so there won't be any trouble with the travel regulations.\"  Harry said, \"Thanks. Think we'll ever see the end of travel regulations and rationing and all the rest of the emergency?\"  \"You will, Mr. Burr.\"  Harry walked to the door.  \"We're on an ark,\" the doctor said.  Harry turned around, smiling. \"What?\"  \"A test, Mr. Burr. You passed it. Goodbye.\"  Harry went home. He told Edna he felt just great! She said she'd been worried when an officer found Plum wandering on the road; she thought maybe Harry had gone off somewhere and broken travel regulations.  \"Me?\" he exclaimed, amazed. \"Break travel regulations? I'd as soon kill a pig!\""]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/51668"],["title","Dream World (#1)"],["body","owling. And she had not howled before, for she was a demure lady.  Nor was she the only one who awoke howling. There were hundreds, then thousands, then millions. The voice spoke to all and engendered a doubt. Which was the real world? Almost equal time was now spent in each, for the people had come to need more sleep and most of them had arrived at spending a full twelve hours or more in the nightmarish world.  \"It could be\" was the title of a headlined article on the subject by the same Professor Greathouse mentioned above. It could be, he said, that the world on which the green rain fell incessantly was the real world. It could be that the wart-hogs were real and the people a dream. It could be that rats in the stomach were normal, and other methods of digestion were chimerical.  And then a very great man went on the air in worldwide broadcast with a speech that was a ringing call for collective sanity. It was the hour of decision, he said. The decision would be made. Things were at an exact balance, and the balance would be tipped.  \"But we can decide. One way or the other, we _will_ decide. I implore you all in the name of sanity that you decide right. One world or the other will be the world of tomorrow. One of them is real and one of them is a dream. Both are with us now, and the favor can go to either. But listen to me here: whichever one wins, the other _will have always been_ a dream, a momentary madness soon forgotten. I urge you to the sanity which in a measure I have lost myself. Yet in our darkened dilemma I feel that we yet have a choice. Choose!\"  And perhaps that was the turning point.  The mad dream disappeared as suddenly as it had appeared. The world came back to normal with an embarrassed laugh. It was all over. It had lasted from its inception six weeks.         *       *       *       *       *  Bascomb Swicegood, a morning type, felt excellent this morning. He breakfasted at Cahill's, and he ordered heavily as always. And he listened with half an ear to the conversation of two girls at the table next to his.  \"But I should know you,\" he said.  \"Of course. I'm Teresa.\"  \"I'm Agnes,\" said Agnes.  \"Mr. Swicegood, how could you forget? It was when the dreams first came, and you overheard me telling mine to Agnes. Then you ran after us in the street because you had had the same dream, and I wanted to have you arrested. Weren't they horrible dreams? And have they ever found out what caused them?\"  \"They were horrible, and they have not found out. They ascribe it to group mania, which is meaningless. And now there are those who say that the dreams never came at all, and soon they will be nearly forgotten. But the horror of them! The loneliness!\"  \"Yes, we hadn't even pediculi to curry our body hair. We almost hadn't any body hair.\"  Teresa was an attractive girl. She had a cute trick of popping the smallest rat out of her mouth so it could see what was coming into her stomach. She was bulbous and beautiful. \"Like a sackful of skunk cabbage,\" Bascomb murmured admiringly in his head, and then flushed green at his forwardness of phrase.  Teresa had protuberances upon protuberances and warts on warts, and hair all over her where she wasn't warts and bumps. \"Like a latrine mop!\" sighed Bascomb with true admiration. The cracked clang of Teresa's voice was music in the early morning.  All was right with the earth again. Gone the hideous nightmare world when people had stood barefaced and lonely, without bodily friends or dependents. Gone that ghastly world of the sick blue sky and the near-absence of entrancing odor.  Bascomb attacked manfully his plate of prime carrion. And outside the pungent green rain fell incessantly."]]]
