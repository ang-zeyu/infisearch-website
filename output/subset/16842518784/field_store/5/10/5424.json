His face was haggard.  \"Marse Comyn, you know what I done promise young MISS long time ago, befo'--befo' she done left us?\"  \"Yes, Ephum.\"  He saw the faithful old negro but dimly. Faintly he heard the pleading voice.  \"Marse Comyn, won' you give Ephum a pass down, river, ter fotch Cap'n Lige?\"  \"Ephum,\" said the Colonel, sadly, \"I had a letter from the Captain yesterday. He is at Cairo. His boat is a Federal transport, and he is in Yankee pay.\"  Ephum took a step forward, appealingly, \"But de Cap'n's yo' friend, Marse Comyn. He ain't never fo'get what you done fo' him, Marse Comyn. He ain't in de army, suh.\"  \"And I am the Captain's friend, Ephum,\" answered the Colonel, quietly. \"But I will not ask aid from any man employed by the Yankee Government. No--not from my own brother, who is in a Pennsylvania regiments.\"  Ephum shuffled out, and his heart was lead as he closed the store that night.  Mr. Hopper has boarded a Fifth Street car, which jangles on with many halts until it comes to Bremen, a German settlement in the north of the city. At Bremen great droves of mules fill the street, and crowd the entrances of the sale stables there. Whips are cracking like pistol shots, Gentlemen with the yellow cavalry stripe of the United States Army are pushing to and fro among the drivers and the owners, and fingering the frightened animals. A herd breaks from the confusion and is driven like a whirlwind down the street, dividing at the Market House. They are going to board the Government transport--to die on the battlefields of Kentucky and Missouri.  Mr. Hopper alights from the car with complacency. He stands for a while on a corner, against the hot building, surveying the busy scene, unnoticed. Mules! Was it not a prophecy,--that drove which sent him into Mr. Carvel's store?  Presently a man with a gnawed yellow mustache and a shifty eye walks out of one of the offices, and perceives our friend.  \"Howdy, Mr. Hopper?\" says he.  Eliphalet extends a hand to be squeezed and returned. \"Got them vouchers?\" he asks. He is less careful of his English here.  \"Wal, I jest reckon,\" is the answer: The fellow was interrupted by the appearance of a smart young man in a smart uniform, who wore an air of genteel importance. He could not have been more than two and twenty, and his face and manners were those of a clerk. The tan of field service was lacking on his cheek, and he was black under the eyes.  \"Hullo, Ford,\" he said, jocularly.  \"Howdy, Cap,\" retorted the other. \"Wal, suh, that last lot was an extry, fo' sure. As clean a lot as ever I seed. Not a lump on 'em. Gov'ment ain't cheated much on them there at one-eighty a head, I reckon.\"  Mr. Ford said this with such an air of conviction and such a sober face that the Captain smiled. And at the same time he glanced down nervously at the new line of buttons on his chest.  \"I guess I know a mule from a Newfoundland dog by this time,\" said he.  \"Wal, I jest reckon,\" asserted Mr. Ford, with a loud laugh. \"Cap'n Wentworth, allow me to make you acquainted with Mr. Hopper. Mr. Hopper, Cap'n Wentworth.\"  The Captain squeezed Mr. Hoppers hand with fervor. \"You interested in mules, Mr. Hopper?\" asked the military man.  \"I don't cal'late to be,\" said. Mr. Hopper. Let us hope that our worthy has not been presented as being wholly without a sense of humor. He grinned as he looked upon this lamb in the uniform of Mars, and added, \"I'm just naturally patriotic, I guess. Cap'n, 'll you have a drink?\"  \"And a segar,\" added Mr. Ford.  \"Just one,\" says the Captain. \"It's d--d tiresome lookin' at mules all day in the sun.\"  Well for Mr. Davitt that his mission work does not extend to Bremen, that the good man's charity keeps him at the improvised hospital down town. Mr. Hopper has resigned the superintendency of his Sunday School, it is true, but he is still a pillar of the church.  The young officer leans against the bar, and listens to stories by Mr. Ford, which it behooves no church members to hear. He smokes Mr. Hopper's cigar and drinks his whiskey. And Eliphalet understands that the good Lord put some fools into the world in order to give the smart people a chance to practise their talents. Mr. Hopper neither drinks nor smokes, but he uses the spittoon with more freedom in this atmosphere.  When at length the Captain has marched out, with a conscious but manly air, Mr. Hopper turns to Ford-- \"Don't lose no time in presenting them vouchers at headquarters,\" says he. \"Money is worth something now. And there's grumbling about this Department in the Eastern papers, If we have an investigation, we'll whistle. How much to-day?\"  \"Three thousand,\" says Mr. Ford. He tosses off a pony of Bourbon, but his face is not a delight to look upon, \"Hopper, you'll be a d--d rich man some day.\"  \"I cal'late to.\"  \"I do the dirty work. And because I ain't got no capital, I only get four per cent.\"  \"Don't one-twenty a day suit you?\"  \"You get blasted near a thousand. And you've got horse contracts, and blanket contracts besides. I know you. What's to prevent my goin' south when the vouchers is cashed?\" he cried. \"Ain't it possible?\"  \"I presume likely,\" said Mr. Hopper, quietly. \"Then your mother'll have to move out of her little place.\"     CHAPTER II  NEWS FROM CLARENCE  The epithet aristocrat may become odious and fatal on the banks of the Mississippi as it was on the banks of the Seine. Let no man deceive himself! These are fearful times. Thousands of our population, by the sudden stoppage of business, are thrown out of employment. When gaunt famine intrudes upon their household, it is but natural that they should inquire the cause. Hunger began the French Revolution.  Virginia did not read this editorial, because it appeared in that abhorred organ of the Mudsills, the 'Missouri Democrat.' The wheels of fortune were turning rapidly that first hot summer of the war time. Let us be thankful that our flesh and blood are incapable of the fury of the guillotine. But when we think calmly of those days, can we escape without a little pity for the aristocrats? Do you think that many of them did not know hunger and want long before that cruel war was over?  How bravely they met the grim spectre which crept so insidiously into their homes!  \"Virginia, child.\" said Mrs. Colfax, peevishly, one morning as they sat at breakfast, \"why do you persist it wearing that old gown? It has gotten on my nerves, my dear. You really must have something new made, even if there are no men here to dress for.\"  \"Aunt Lillian, you must not say such things. I do not think that I ever dressed to please men.\"  \"Tut, tut; my dear, we all do. I did, even after married your uncle. It is natural. We must not go shabby in such times as these, or be out of fashion, Did you know that Prince Napoleon was actually coming here for a visit this autumn? We must be ready for him. I am having a fitting at Miss Elder's to-day.\"  Virginia was learning patience. She did not reply as she poured out her aunt's coffee.  \"Jinny,\" said that lady, \"come with me to Elder's, and I will give you some gowns. If Comyn had been as careful of his own money as of mine, you could dress decently.\"  \"I think I do dress decently, Aunt Lillian,\" answered the girl. \"I do not need the gowns. Give me the money you intend to pay for them, and I can use it for a better purpose.\"  Mrs. Colfax arranged her lace pettishly.  \"I am sick and tired of this superiority, Jinny.\" And in the same breath. \"What would you do with it?\"  Virginia lowered her voice. \"Hodges goes through the lines to-morrow night. I should send it to Clarence.\" \"But you have no idea where Clarence is.\"  \"Hodges can find him.\"  \"Pshaw!\" exclaimed her aunt, \"I would not trust him. How do you know that he will get through the Dutch pickets to Price's army? Wasn't Souther captured last week, and that rash letter of Puss Russell's to Jack Brinsmade published in the Democrat?\" She laughed at the recollection, and Virginia was fain to laugh too. \"Puss hasn't been around much since. I hope that will cure her of saying what she thinks of people.\"  \"It won't,\" said Virginia.  \"I'll save my money until Price drives the Yankees from the state, and Clarence marches into the city at the head of a regiment,\" Mrs. Colfax went on, \"It won't be long now.\"  Virginia's eyes flashed.  \"Oh, you can't have read the papers. And don't you remember the letter Maude had from George? They need the bare necessities of life, Aunt Lillian. And half of Price's men have no arms at all.\"  \"Jackson,\" said Mrs. Colfax, \"bring me a newspaper. Is there any news to-day?\"  \"No,\" answered Virginia, quickly. \"All we know is that Lyon has left Springfield to meet our troops, and that a great battle is coming, Perhaps--perhaps it is being fought to-day.\"  Mrs. Colfax burst into tears, \"Oh, Jinny,\" she cried, \"how can you be so cruel!\"  That very evening a man, tall and lean, but with the shrewd and kindly eye of a scout, came into the sitting-room with the Colonel and handed a letter to Mrs. Colfax. In the hall he slipped into Virginia's hand another, in a \"Jefferson Davis\" envelope, and she thrust it in her gown --the girl was on fire as he whispered in her ear that he had seen Clarence, and that he was well. In two days an answer might be left at Mr. Russell's house. But she must be careful what she wrote, as the Yankee scouts were active.  Clarence, indeed, had proven himself a man. Glory and uniform became him well, but danger and deprivation better. The words he had written, careless and frank and boyish, made Virginia's heart leap with pride. Mrs. Colfax's letter began with the adventure below the Arsenal, when the frail skiff had sunk near the island, He told how he had heard the captain of his escort sing out to him in the darkness, and how he had floated down the current instead, until, chilled and weary, he had contrived to seize the branches of a"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5394"],["title","The Crisis â€” Volume 07 (#1)"],["body","and bruised by cypress knees, he thought of Sherman in his canoe, winding unprotected through the black labyrinth, risking his life that more men might be brought to the rescue of the gunboats.  The story of that rescue has been told most graphically by Sherman himself. How he picked up the men at work on the bayou and marched them on a coal barge; how he hitched the barge to a navy tug; how he met the little transport with a fresh load of troops, and Captain Elijah Brent's reply when the General asked if he would follow him. \"As long as the boat holds together, General.\" And he kept his word. The boughs hammered at the smoke-pipes until they went by the board, and the pilothouse fell like a pack of cards on the deck before they had gone three miles and a half. Then the indomitable Sherman disembarked, a lighted candle in his hand, and led a stiff march through thicket and swamp and breast-deep backwater, where the little drummer boys carried their drums on their heads. At length, when they were come to some Indian mounds, they found a picket of three, companies of the force which had reached the flat the day before, and had been sent down to prevent the enemy from obstructing further the stream below the fleet.  \"The Admiral's in a bad way, sir,\" said the Colonel who rode up to meet the General. \"He's landlocked. Those clumsy ironclads of his can't move backward or forward, and the Rebs have been peppering him for two days.\"  Just then a fusillade broke from the thickets, nipping the branches from the cottonwoods about them.  \"Form your line,\" said the General. \"Drive 'em out.\"  The force swept forward, with the three picket companies in the swamp on the right. And presently they came in sight of the shapeless ironclads with their funnels belching smoke, a most remarkable spectacle. How Porter had pushed them there was one of the miracles of the war.  Then followed one of a thousand memorable incidents in the life of a memorable man. General Sherman, jumping on the bare back of a scrawny horse, cantered through the fields. And the bluejackets, at sight of that familiar figure, roared out a cheer that might have shaken the drops from the wet boughs. The Admiral and the General stood together on the deck, their hands clasped. And the Colonel astutely remarked, as he rode up in answer to a summons, that if Porter was the only man whose daring could have pushed a fleet to that position, Sherman was certainly the only man who could have got him out of it.  \"Colonel,\" said the General, \"that move was well executed, sir. Admiral, did the Rebs put a bullet through your rum casks? We're just a little tired. And now,\" he added, wheeling on the Colonel when each had a glass in his hand, \"who was in command of that company on the right, in the swamp? He handled them like a regular.\"  \"He's a second lieutenant, General, in the Sixth Missouri. Captain wounded at Hindman, and first lieutenant fell out down below. His name is Brice, I believe.\"  \"I thought so,\" said the General.  Some few days afterward, when the troops were slopping around again at Young's Point, opposite Vicksburg, a gentleman arrived on a boat from St. Louis. He paused on the levee to survey with concern and astonishment the flood of waters behind it, and then asked an officer the way to General Sherman's headquarters. The officer, who was greatly impressed by the gentleman's looks, led him at once to a trestle bridge which spanned the distance from the levee bank over the flood to a house up to its first floor in the backwaters. The orderly saluted.  \"Who shall I say, sir?\"  The officer looked inquiringly at the gentleman, who gave his name.  The officer could not repress a smile at the next thing that happened. Out hurried the General himself, with both hands outstretched.  \"Bless my soul!\" he cried, \"if it isn't Brinsmade. Come right in, come right in and take dinner. The boys will be glad to see you. I'll send and tell Grant you're here. Brinsmade, if it wasn't for you and your friends on the Western Sanitary Commission, we'd all have been dead of fever and bad food long ago.\" The General sobered abruptly. \"I guess a good many of the boys are laid up now,\" he added.  \"I've come down to do what I can, General,\" responded Mr. Brinsmade, gravely. \"I want to go through all the hospitals to see that our nurses are doing their duty and that the stores are properly distributed.\"  \"You shall, sir, this minute,\" said the General. He dropped instantly the affairs which he had on hand, and without waiting for dinner the two gentlemen went together through the wards where the fever raged. The General surprised his visitor by recognizing private after private in the cots, and he always had a brief word of cheer to brighten their faces, to make them follow him with wistful eyes as he passed beyond them. \"That's poor Craig,\" he would say, \"corporal, Third Michigan. They tell me he can't live,\" and \"That's Olcott, Eleventh Indiana. Good God!\" cried the General, when they were out in the air again, \"how I wish some of these cotton traders could get a taste of this fever. They keep well--the vultures--And by the way, Brinsmade, the man who gave me no peace at all at Memphis was from your city. Why, I had to keep a whole corps on duty to watch him.\"  \"What was his name, sir?\" Mr. Brinsmade asked.  \"Hopper!\" cried the General, with feeling. \"Eliphalet Hopper. As long as I live I shall never forget it. How the devil did he get a permit? What are they about at Washington?\"  \"You surprise me,\" said Mr. Brinsmade. \"He has always seemed inoffensive, and I believe he is a prominent member of one of our churches.\"  \"I guess that's so,\" answered the General, dryly. \"I ever I set eyes on him again, he's clapped into the guardhouse. He knows it, too.\"  \"Speaking of St. Louis, General,\" said Mr. Brinsmade, presently, \"have you ever heard of Stephen Brice? joined your army last autumn. You may remember talking to him one evening at my house.\"  \"He's one of my boys!\" cried the General. \"Remember him? Guess I do!\" He paused on the very brink of relating again the incident at Camp Jackson, when Stephen had saved the life of Mr. Brinsmade's own son. \"Brinsmade, for three days I've had it on my mind to send for that boy. I'll have him at headquarters now. I like him,\" cried General Sherman, with tone and gesture there was no mistaking. And good Mr. Brinsmade, who liked Stephen, too, rejoiced at the story he would have to tell the widow. \"He has spirit, Brinsmade. I told him to let me know when he was ready to go to war. No such thing. He never came near me. The first thing I hear of him is that he's digging holes in the clay of Chickasaw Bluff, and his cap is fanned off by the blast of a Parrott six feet above his head. Next thing he turns up on that little expedition we took to get Porter to sea again. When we got to the gunboats, there was Brice's company on the flank. He handled those men surprisingly, sir--surprisingly. I shouldn't have blamed the boy if one or two Rebs got by him. But no, he swept the place clean.\" By this time they had come back to the bridge leading to headquarters, and the General beckoned quickly to an orderly.  \"My compliments to Lieutenant Stephen Brice, Sixth Missouri, and ask him to report here at once. At once, you understand!\"  \"Yes, General.\"  It so happened that Mr. Brice's company were swinging axes when the orderly arrived, and Mr. Brice had an axe himself, and was up to his boot tops in yellow mud.  The orderly, who had once been an Iowa farmer, was near grinning when he gave the General's message and saw the lieutenant gazing ruefully at his clothes.  Entering headquarters, Stephen paused at the doorway of the big room where the officers of the different staffs were scattered about, smoking, while the negro servants were removing the dishes from the table. The sunlight, reflected from the rippling water outside, danced on the ceiling. At the end of the room sat General Sherman, his uniform, as always, a trifle awry. His soft felt hat with the gold braid was tilted forward, and his feet, booted and spurred, were crossed. Small wonder that the Englishman who sought the typical American found him in Sherman.  The sound that had caught Stephen's attention was the General's voice, somewhat high-pitched, in the key that he used in telling a story. These were his closing words.  \"Sin gives you a pretty square deal, boys, after all. Generally a man says, 'Well, I can resist, but I'll have my fun just this once.' That's the way it happens. They tell you that temptation comes irresistibly. Don't believe it. Do you, Mr. Brice? Come over here, sir. Here's a friend of yours.\"  Stephen made his way to the General, whose bright eyes wandered rapidly over him as he added:  \"This is the condition my officers report in, Brinsmade,--mud from head to heel.\"  Stephen had sense enough to say nothing, but the staff officers laughed, and Mr. Brinsmade smiled as he rose and took Stephen's hand.  \"I am delighted to see that you are well, sir,\" said he, with that formal kindliness which endeared him to all. \"Your mother will be rejoiced at my news of you. You will be glad to hear that I left her well, Stephen.\"  Stephen inquired for Mrs. Brinsmade and Anne.  \"They are well, sir, and took pleasure in adding to a little box which your mother sent. Judge Whipple put in a box of fine cigars, although he deplores the use of tobacco.\"  \"And the Judge, Mr. Brinsmade--how is he?\"  The good gentleman's face fell.  \"He is ailing, sir, it grieves me to say. He is in bed, sir. But he is ably looked after. Your mother desired to have him moved to her house, but he is difficult to stir from his ways, and he would not leave his little room. He is ably nursed. We have got old Nancy, Hester's mother, to stay with him at night, and Mrs. Brice divides the day with Miss Jinny Carvel, who comes in from Bellegarde every afternoon.\"  \"Miss Carvel?\" exclaimed Stephen, wondering if he heard aright."]]]
