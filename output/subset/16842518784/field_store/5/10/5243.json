I mean, Pete, it is not your fault there are so many rackets--uh, taxes--and middlemen and agencies and et cetera. That is just the way Earth is set up these days.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Matheny's finger stabbed in the general direction of Doran's pajama top. \"Exactly. And who set it up that way? Earthmen. We Martians are babes in the desert. What chance do we have to earn dollars on the scale we need them, in competition with corporations which could buy and sell our whole planet before breakfast? Why, we couldn't afford three seconds of commercial time on a Lullaby Pillow 'cast. What we need, what we have to hire, is an executive who knows Earth, who's an Earthman himself. Let him tell us what will appeal to your people, and how to dodge the tax bite and--and--well, you see how it goes, that sort of, uh, thing.\"  Matheny felt his eloquence running down and grabbed for the second bottle of beer.  \"But where do I start?\" he asked plaintively, for his loneliness smote him anew. \"I'm just a college professor at home. How would I even get to see--\"  \"It might be arranged,\" said Doran in a thoughtful tone. \"It just might. How much could you pay this fellow?\"  \"A hundred megabucks a year, if he'll sign a five-year contract. That's Earth years, mind you.\"  \"I'm sorry to tell you this, Pete,\" said Doran, \"but while that is not bad money, it is not what a high-powered sales scientist gets in Newer York. Plus his retirement benefits, which he would lose if he quit where he is now at. And I am sure he would not want to settle on Mars permanently.\"  \"I could offer a certain amount of, uh, lagniappe,\" said Matheny. \"That is, well, I can draw up to a hundred megabucks myself for, uh, expenses and, well ... let me buy you a drink!\"  Doran's black eyes frogged at him. \"You might at that,\" said the Earthman very softly. \"Yes, you might at that.\"  Matheny found himself warming. Gus Doran was an authentic bobber. A hell of a swell chap. He explained modestly that he was a free-lance business consultant and it was barely possible that he could arrange some contacts....  \"No, no, no commission, all done in the interest of interplanetary friendship ... well, anyhow, let's not talk business now. If you have got to stick to beer, Pete, make it a chaser to akvavit. What is akvavit? Well, I will just take and show you.\"  A hell of a good bloke. He knew some very funny stories, too, and he laughed at Matheny's, though they were probably too rustic for a big-city taste like his.  \"What I really want,\" said Matheny, \"what I really want--I mean what Mars really needs, get me?--is a confidence man.\"  \"A what?\"  \"The best and slickest one on Earth, to operate a world-size con game for us and make us some real money.\"  \"Con man? Oh. A slipstring.\"  \"A con by any other name,\" said Matheny, pouring down an akvavit.         *       *       *       *       *  Doran squinted through cigarette smoke. \"You are interesting me strangely, my friend. Say on.\"  \"No.\" Matheny realized his head was a bit smoky. The walls of the booth seemed odd, somehow. They were just leatheroid walls, but they had an odd quality.  \"No, sorry, Gus,\" he said. \"I spoke too much.\"  \"Okay. Forget it. I do not like a man that pries. But look, let's bomb out of here, how about it? Go have a little fun.\"  \"By all means.\" Matheny disposed of his last beer. \"I could use some gaiety.\"  \"You have come to the right town then. But let us get you a hotel room first and some more up-to-date clothes.\"  \"_Allez_,\" said Matheny. \"If I don't mean _allons_, or maybe _alors_.\"  The drop down to cab-ramp level and the short ride afterward sobered him; the room rate at the Jupiter-Astoria sobered him still more.  _Oh, well_, he thought, _if I succeed in this job, no one at home will quibble._  And the chamber to which he and Doran were shown was spectacular enough, with a pneumo direct to the bar and a full-wall transparency to show the vertical incandescence of the towers.  \"Whoof!\" Matheny sat down. The chair slithered sensuously about his contours. He jumped. \"What the dusty hell--Oh.\" He tried to grin, but his face burned. \"I see.\"  \"That is a sexy type of furniture, all right,\" agreed Doran. He lowered himself into another chair, cocked his feet on the 3-D and waved a cigarette. \"Which speaking of, what say we get some girls? It is not too late to catch them at home. A date here will usually start around 2100 hours earliest.\"  \"What?\"  \"You know. Dames. Like a certain blonde warhead with twin radar and swivel mounting, and she just loves exotics. Such as you.\"  \"Me?\" Matheny heard his voice climb to a schoolboy squeak. \"Me? Exotic? Why, I'm just a little college professor. I g-g-g, that is--\" His tongue got stuck on his palate. He pulled it loose and moistened uncertain lips.  \"You are from Mars. Okay? So you fought bushcats barehanded in an abandoned canal.\"  \"What's a bushcat? And we don't have canals. The evaporation rate--\"  \"Look, Pete,\" said Doran patiently. \"She don't have to know that, does she?\"  \"Well--well, no. I guess not No.\"  \"Let's order you some clothes on the pneumo,\" said Doran. \"I recommend you buy from Schwartzherz. Everybody knows he is expensive.\"         *       *       *       *       *  While Matheny jittered about, shaving and showering and struggling with his new raiment, Doran kept him supplied with akvavit and beer.  \"You said one thing, Pete,\" Doran remarked. \"About needing a slipstring. A con man, you would call it.\"  \"Forget that. Please. I spoke out of turn.\"  \"Well, you see, maybe a man like that is just what Mars does need. And maybe I have got a few contacts.\"  \"What?\" Matheny gaped out of the bathroom.  Doran cupped his hands around a fresh cigarette, not looking at him. \"I am not that man,\" he said frankly. \"But in my line I get a lot of contacts, and not all of them go topside. See what I mean? Like if, say, you wanted somebody terminated and could pay for it, I could not do it. I would not want to know anything about it. But I could tell you a phone number.\"  He shrugged and gave the Martian a sidelong glance. \"Sure, you may not be interested. But if you are, well, Pete, I was not born yesterday. I got tolerance. Like the book says, if you want to get ahead, you have got to think positively.\"  Matheny hesitated. If only he hadn't taken that last shot! It made him want to say yes, immediately, without reservations. And therefore maybe he became overcautious.  They had instructed him on Mars to take chances if he must.  \"I could tell you a thing or two that might give you a better idea,\" he said slowly. \"But it would have to be under security.\"  \"Okay by me. Room service can send us up an oath box right now.\"  \"What? But--but--\" Matheny hung onto himself and tried to believe that he had landed on Earth less than six hours ago.  In the end, he did call room service and the machine was trundled in. Doran swallowed the pill and donned the conditioner helmet without an instant's hesitation.  \"I shall never reveal to any person unauthorized by yourself whatever you may tell me under security, now or at any other time,\" he recited. Then, cheerfully: \"And that formula, Pete, happens to be the honest-to-zebra truth.\"  \"I know.\" Matheny stared, embarrassed, at the carpet. \"I'm sorry to--to--I mean of course I trust you, but--\"  \"Forget it. I take a hundred security oaths a year, in my line of work. Maybe I can help you. I like you, Pete, damn if I don't. And, sure, I might stand to get an agent's cut, if I arrange--Go ahead, boy, go ahead.\" Doran crossed his legs and leaned back.  \"Oh, it's simple enough,\" said Matheny. \"It's only that we already are operating con games.\"  \"On Mars, you mean?\"  \"Yes. There never were any Old Martians. We erected the ruins fifty years ago for the Billingsworth Expedition to find. We've been manufacturing relics ever since.\"  \"_Huh?_ Well, why, but--\"  \"In this case, it helps to be at the far end of an interplanetary haul,\" said Matheny. \"Not many Terrestrial archeologists get to Mars and they depend on our people to--Well, anyhow--\"  \"I will be clopped! Good for you!\"         *       *       *       *       *  Doran blew up in laughter. \"That is one thing I would never spill, even without security. I told you about my girl friend, didn't I?\"  \"Yes, and that calls to mind the Little Girl,\" said Matheny apologetically. \"She was another official project.\"  \"Who?\"  \"Remember Junie O'Brien? The little golden-haired girl on Mars, a mathematical prodigy, but dying of an incurable disease? She collected Earth coins.\"  \"Oh, that. Sure, I remember--Hey! You didn't!\"  \"Yes. We made about a billion dollars on that one.\"  \"I will be double damned. You know, Pete, I sent her a hundred-buck piece myself. Say, how is Junie O'Brien?\"  \"Oh, fine. Under a different name, she's now our finance minister.\" Matheny stared out the wall, his hands twisting nervously behind his back. \"There were no lies involved. She really does have a fatal disease. So do you and I. Every day we grow older.\"  \"Uh!\" exclaimed Doran.  \"And then the Red Ankh Society. You must have seen or heard their ads. 'What mysterious knowledge did the Old Martians possess? What was the secret wisdom of the Ancient Aliens? Now the incredibly powerful semantics of the Red Ankh (not a religious organization) is available to a select few--' That's our largest dollar-earning enterprise.\"  He would have liked to say it was his suggestion originally, but it would have been too presumptuous. He was talking to an Earthman, who had heard everything already.  Doran whistled.  \"That's about all, so far,\" confessed Matheny. \"Perhaps a con is our only hope. I've been wondering, maybe we could organize a Martian bucket shop, handling Martian securities, but--well, I don't know.\"  \"I think--\" Doran removed the helmet and stood up.  \"Yes?\" Matheny faced around, shivering with his own tension.  \"I may be able to find the man you want,\" said Doran. \"I just may. "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/51651"],["title","Conditionally Human (#1)"],["body","listen--\"  \"Yes?\"  \"Don't let me catch you falsifying a serial number.\"  Doctor Georges laughed faintly. \"I won't, Norris. Thanks a million.\" He hung up quickly.  Norris immediately regretted his consent. It bordered on being illegal. But he saw it as a quick way to get rid of an animal that might later have to be killed.  He called Anne. Her voice was dull. She seemed depressed, but not angry. When he finished talking, she said, \"All right, Terry,\" and hung up.         *       *       *       *       *  By noon, he had finished checking the shipping lists at the wholesale house in Wylo City. Only thirty-five of July's Bermuda-K-99s had entered his territory, and they were about equally divided among five pet shops, three of which were in Wylo City.  After lunch, he called each of the retail dealers, read them the serial numbers, and asked them to check the sales records for names and addresses of individual buyers. By three o'clock, he had the entire list filled out, and the task began to look easier. All that remained was to pick up the thirty-five animals.  And _that_, he thought, was like trying to take a year-old baby away from its doting mother. He sighed and drove to the Wylo suburbs to begin his rounds.  Anne met him at the door when he came home at six. He stood on the porch for a moment, smiling at her weakly. The smile was not returned.  \"Doctor Georges came,\" she told him. \"He signed for the--\" She stopped to stare at him. \"Darling, your face! What happened?\"  Gingerly he touch the livid welts down the side of his cheek. \"Just scratched a little,\" he muttered. He pushed past her and went to the phone in the hall. He sat eying it distastefully for a moment, not liking what he had to do. Anne came to stand beside him and examine the scratches.  Finally he lifted the phone and dialed the Wylo exchange. A grating mechanical voice answered, \"Locator center. Your party, please.\"  \"Sheriff Yates,\" Norris grunted.  The robot operator, which had on tape the working habits of each Wylo City citizen, began calling numbers. It found the off-duty sheriff on its third try, in a Wylo pool hall.  \"I'm getting so I hate that infernal gadget,\" Yates grumbled. \"I think it's got me psyched. What do you want, Norris?\"  \"Cooperation. I'm mailing you three letters charging three Wylo citizens with resisting a Federal official--namely _me_--and charging one of them with assault. I tried to pick up their neutroids for a pound inspection--\"  Yates bellowed lusty laughter into the phone.  \"It's not funny. I've got to get those neutroids. It's in connection with the Delmont case.\"  Yates stopped laughing. \"Oh. Well, I'll take care of it.\"  \"It's a rush-order, Sheriff. Can you get the warrants tonight and pick up the animals in the morning?\"  \"Easy on those warrants, boy. Judge Charleman can't be disturbed just any time. I can get the newts to you by noon, I guess, provided we don't have to get a helicopter posse to chase down the mothers.\"  \"That'll be all right. And listen, Yates--fix it so the charges will be dropped if they cooperate. Don't shake those warrants around unless they just won't listen to reason. But get those neutroids.\"  \"Okay, boy. Gotcha.\"  Norris gave him the names and addresses of the three unwilling mothers. As soon as he hung up, Anne touched his shoulders and said, \"Sit still.\" She began smoothing a chilly ointment over his burning cheek.  \"Hard day?\" she asked.  \"Not too hard. Those were just three out of fifteen. I got the other twelve. They're in the truck.\"  \"That's good,\" she said. \"You've got only twelve empty cages.\"  He neglected to tell her that he had stopped at twelve for just this reason. \"Guess I better get them unloaded,\" he said, standing up.  \"Can I help you?\"  He stared at her for a moment, saying nothing. She smiled a little and looked aside. \"Terry, I'm sorry--about this morning. I--I know you've got a job that has to be--\" Her lip quivered slightly.  Norris grinned, caught her shoulders, and pulled her close.  \"Honeymoon's on again, huh?\" she whispered against his neck.  \"Come on,\" he grunted. \"Let's unload some neutroids, before I forget all about work.\"         *       *       *       *       *  They went out to the kennels together. The cages were inside a sprawling concrete barn, which was divided into three large rooms--one for the fragile neuter humanoid creatures, and another for the lesser mutants, such as cat-Qs, dog-Fs, dwarf bears, and foot-high lambs that never matured into sheep. The third room contained a small gas chamber with a conveyor belt leading from it to a crematory-incinerator.  Norris kept the third locked lest his wife see its furnishings.  The doll-like neutroids began their mindless chatter as soon as their keepers entered the building. Dozens of blazing blond heads began dancing about their cages. Their bodies thwacked against the wire mesh as they leaped about their compartments with monkey grace.  Their human appearance was broken by only two distinct features: short beaverlike tails decorated with fluffy curls of fur, and an erect thatch of scalp-hair that grew up into a bright candleflame. Otherwise, they appeared completely human, with baby-pink skin, quick little smiles, and cherubic faces. They were sexually neuter and never grew beyond a predetermined age-set which varied for each series. Age-sets were available from one to ten years human equivalent. Once a neutroid reached its age-set, it remained at the set's child-development level until death.  \"They must be getting to know you pretty well,\" Anne said, glancing around at the cages.  Norris was wearing a slight frown as he inspected the room. \"They've never gotten this excited before.\"  He walked along a row of cages, then stopped by a K-76 to stare.  \"_Apple cores!_\" He turned to face his wife. \"How did apples get in there?\"  She reddened. \"I felt sorry for them, eating that goo from the mechanical feeder. I drove down to Sherman III and bought six dozen cooking apples.\"  \"That was a mistake.\"  She frowned irritably. \"We can afford it.\"  \"That's not the point. There's a reason for the mechanical feeders.\" He paused, wondering how he could tell her the truth. He blundered on: \"They get to love whoever feeds them.\"  \"I can't see--\"  \"How would you feel about disposing of something that loved you?\"  Anne folded her arms and stared at him. \"Planning to dispose of any soon?\" she asked acidly.  \"Honeymoon's off again, eh?\"  She turned away. \"I'm sorry, Terry. I'll try not to mention it again.\"  He began unloading the truck, pulling the frightened and squirming doll-things forth one at a time with a snare-pole. They were one-man pets, always frightened of strangers.  \"What's the Delmont case, Terry?\" Anne asked while he worked.  \"Huh?\"  \"I heard you mention it on the phone. Anything to do with why you got your face scratched?\"  He nodded sourly. \"Indirectly, yes. It's a long story.\"  \"Tell me.\"  \"Well, Delmont was a green-horn evolvotron operator at the Bermuda plant. His job was taking the unfertilized chimpanzee ova out of the egg-multiplier, mounting them in his machine, and bombarding the gene structure with sub-atomic particles. It's tricky business. He flashes a huge enlargement of the ovum on the electron microscope screen--large enough so he can see the individual protein molecules. He has an artificial gene pattern to compare it with. It's like shooting sub-atomic billiards. He's got to fire alpha-particles into the gene structure and displace certain links by just the right amount. And he's got to be quick about it before the ovum dies from an overdose of radiation from the enlarger. A good operator can get one success out of seven tries.  \"Well, Delmont worked a week and spoiled over a hundred ova without a single success. They threatened to fire him. I guess he got hysterical. Anyway, he reported one success the next day. It was faked. The ovum had a couple of flaws--something wrong in the central nervous system's determinants, and in the glandular makeup. Not a standard neutroid ovum. He passed it on to the incubators to get a credit, knowing it wouldn't be caught until after birth.\"  \"It wasn't caught at all?\" Anne asked.  \"Funny thing, he was afraid it wouldn't be. He got to worrying about it, thought maybe a mental-deviant would pass, and that it might be dangerous. So he went back to its incubator and cut off the hormone flow into its compartment.\"  \"Why that?\"  \"So it _would_ develop sexuality. A neutroid would be born a female if they didn't give it suppressive doses of male hormone prenatally. That keeps ovaries from developing and it comes out neuter. But Delmont figured a female would be caught and stopped before the final inspection. They'd dispose of her without even bothering to examine for the other defects. And he could blame the sexuality on an equipment malfunction. He thought it was pretty smart. Trouble was they didn't catch the female. She went on through; they all _look_ female.\"  \"How did they find out about it now?\"  \"He got caught last month, trying it again. And he confessed to doing it once before. No telling how many times he _really_ did it.\"  Norris held up the final kicking, squealing, tassel-haired doll from the back of the kennel-truck. He grinned at his wife. \"This little fellow, for instance. It might be a potential she. It might also be a potential murderer. _All_ these kiddos are from the machines in the section where Delmont worked.\"  Anne snorted and caught the baby-creature in her arms. It struggled and tried to bite, but subsided a little when she disentangled it from the snare. \"Kkr-r-reee,\" it cooed nervously. \"Kkr-r-reee!\"  \"You tell him you're no murderer,\" Anne purred to it.  Norris watched disapprovingly while she fondled it. One thing he had learned: to steer clear of emotional attachments. It was eight months old and looked like a child of two years--a year short of its age-set. And it was designed to be as affectionate as a human child.  "]]]
