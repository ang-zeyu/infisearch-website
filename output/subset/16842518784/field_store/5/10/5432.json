But the superior majesty of the American river soon asserted itself, and I forgot the comparison altogether as I looked out on this truly noble stream, with the finely wooded hills leaning back from it on either side, as if to give its waters more spacious way.  And then Harrisburg, and the same stealthy departure of the train. But outside the station our having started was evident enough, for a horse that had been left to look after a buggy for a few minutes, took fright, and with three frantic kangaroo-leaps tried to take the conveyance whole over a wall. But failing in this, it careered away down the road with the balance of the buggy dangling in a draggle-tail sort of way behind it.  Nature works with so few ingredients that landscape repeats itself in every continent. For there is a limit, after all, to the combinations possible of water, mountain, plain, valley, and vegetation. This is strictly true, of course, only when we deal with things generically. Specific combinations go beyond arithmetic. But even with her species, Nature delights in singing over old songs and telling the tales she has already told. For instance here, after passing Harrisburg, is a wonderful glimpse of Naini Tal in the Indian hills--memorable for a terribly fatal landslip three years ago--with its oaks and rhododendrons and scattered pines. In the valleys the streams go tumbling along with willows on either bank, and here and there on the hillsides, shine white houses with orchards about them.  The houses men build for themselves when they are thinking only of shelter are ugly enough. Elegance, like the nightingale, is a creature of summer-time, when the hard-working months of the year are over and Nature sits in her drawing-room, so to speak, playing the fine lady, painting the roses and sweetening the peaches. But, ugly though they are, these scattered homesteads are by far the finest lines in all the great poem of this half-wild continent, and lend a grand significance to every passage in which they occur. And the pathos of it! Look at those two horses and a man driving a plough through that scrap of ground yonder. There is not another living object in view, though the eye covers enough ground for a European principality. Yet that man dares to challenge all this tremendous Nature! It is David before Goliath, before a whole wilderness of Goliaths, with a plough for a sling and a ploughshare for a pebble.  Here all of a sudden is another man, all alone with some millions of trees and the Alleghanies. And he stands there with an axe in his hands, revolving in that untidy head of his what he shall do next to the old hills and their reverend forest growth. The audacity of it, and the solemnity!  It would be as well perhaps for sentiment if every man was quite alone. For I find that if there are two men together one immediately tries to sell the other something; and to inform him of its nature, he goes and paints the name of his disgusting commodities on the smooth faces of rocks and on tree-trunks. Now, any landscape, however grand, loses in dignity if you see \"Bunkum's Patent\" inscribed in the foreground in whitewash letters six feet high.  What a mercy it is these quacks cannot advertise on the sky--or on running water!  For the river is now at its grandest and it keeps with us all the afternoon, showing on either side splendid waterways between sloping spurs of the hills densely wooded and strewn with great boulders. But on a sudden the mountains are gone and the river with them, and we speed along through a region of green grass-land and abundant cultivation. Land agents might truthfully advertise it in lots as \"eligible sites for kingdoms.\"  And so on, past townships, whose names running (at forty miles an hour) no man can read, and round the famous \"horseshoe curve\"--where it looks as if the train were trying to get its head round in order to swallow its tail--down into valleys already taking their evening tints of misty purple, and pink, and pale blue. And then Derry.  Just before we arrived there, two freight trains had selected Derry as an opportune spot for a collision, and had collided accordingly. There could have been very little reservation about their collision, for the wreck was complete, and when we got under way again we could just make out by the moonlight the scattered limbs of carriages lying heaped about on the bank. In some places it looked as if a clumsy apprentice had been trying to make packing-cases out of freight wagons, but had given up on finding that he had broken the pieces too small. And they were too big for matches. So it was rather a useless sort of collision, after all--and no one was hurt.  But \"the Pennsylvania Limited\" has very little leisure to think about other people's collisions, and so we were soon on our way again through the moonlit country, with the hills in the distance lying still and black, like round-backed monsters sleeping, and the stations going by in sudden snatches of lamplight, and every now and then a train, its bell giving a wail exactly like the sound of a shell as it passes over the trenches. And so to Pittsburg, and, our \"five minutes\" over, the train stole away like a hyena, snarling and hiccoughing, and we were again out in the country, with everything about us beautified by the gracious alchemy of the moonlight and the stars.  And the Ohio River rolled alongside, with its steamers ploughing up furrows of ghostly white froth, and unwinding as they went long streamers of ghostly black--and then I fell asleep.  When I awoke next morning I was in Indiana, and very sunny it looked without a hill in sight to make a shadow. The water stood in lakes on the dead level of the country, and horses, cattle, sheep, and here and there a pig--a pregustation of Chicago--grazed and rooted, very well satisfied apparently with pastures that had no ups and downs to trouble them as they loitered about. And as the morning wore on, the people woke up, and were soon as busy as their windmills. In the fields the teams were ploughing; in the towns, the children were trooping off to school. But the eternal level began at last, apparently, to weary the Pennsylvania Limited, for it commenced slackening speed and finding frivolous pretexts for coming nearly to a standstill--the climax being reached when we halted in front of a small, piebald pig. We looked at the pig and the pig looked at us, and the pig got the best of it, for we sneaked off, leaving the porker master of the situation and still looking.  But these great flats--what a paradise of snipe they are, and how golf-players might revel on them! Birds were abundant. Crows went about in bands recruiting \"black marauders\" in every copse; blackbirds flew over in flocks, and small things of the linnet kind rose in wisps from the sedges and osiers. And there was another bird of which I did not then know the name, that was a surprise every time it left the ground, for it sate all black and flew half scarlet. Could not these marsh levels be utilized for the Indian water-nut, the singhara? In Asia where it is cultivated it ranks almost as a local staple of food, and is delicious.  A noteworthy feature of the country, by the way, is the sudden appearance of hedge-rows. No detail of landscape that I know of makes scenery at once so English. And then we find ourselves steaming along past beds of osiers, with long waterways stretching up northwards, with here and there painted duck, like the European sheldrake, floating under the shadows of the fir-trees, and then I became aware of a great green expanse of water showing through the trees, and I asked \"What is that? The water must be very deep to be such a colour.\" \"That is Lake Michigan,\" was the answer, \"and this is Chicago we are coming to now.\"  And very soon we found ourselves in the station of the great city by the lake, with the masts of shipping alongside the funnels of engines. But not a pig in sight!  I had thought that Chicago was all pigs.  And what a city it is, this central wonder of the States! As a whole, Chicago is nearly terrific. The real significance of this phoenix city is almost appalling. Its astonishing resurrection from its ashes and its tremendous energy terrify jelly-fishes like myself. Before they have got roads that are fit to be called roads, these Chicago men have piled up the new County Hall, to my mind one of the most imposing structures I have ever seen in all my wide travels.  Chicago does not altogether seem to like it, for every one spoke of it as \"too solid-looking,\" but for my part I think it almost superb. The architect's name, I believe, is Egan; but whence he got his architectural inspiration I cannot say. It reminds me in part of a wing of the Tuileries, but why it does I could not make up my mind.  Then again, look at this Chicago which allows its business thoroughfares to be so sumptuously neglected--some of them are almost as disreputable-looking as Broadway--and goes and lays out imperial \"boulevards\" to connect its \"system of parks.\" These boulevards, simply if left alone for the trees to grow up and the turf to grow thick, will before long be the finest in all the world. The streets in the city, however, if left alone much longer, would be a disgrace to--well, say Port Said. The local administration, they say, is \"corrupt.\" But that is the standing American explanation for everything with which a stranger finds fault. I was always told the same in New York--and would you seriously tell me that the municipal administration of New York is corrupt?--to account for congestion of traffic, fat policemen, bad lamps, sidewalks blocked with packing-cases, &c., &c. And in Chicago it accounts for the streets being more like rolling prairie than streets, for cigar stores being houses of assignation, for there being so much orange peel and"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5417"],["title","Struggling Upward, or Luke Larkin's Luck (#1)"],["body",". Hooper, \"but he probably had no expectation of succeeding.\"  \"I should think he would have kept on with the rest. I would have done so, though my chance would have been no better than his.\"  Indeed, it seemed strange that Tom should have given up so quickly. It soon appeared that it was not caprice, but that he had an object in view, and that a very discreditable one.  He waited till the boys were on their way back. By this time Luke was some eight rods in advance of his leading competitor. Then Tom began to be on the alert. As Luke came swinging on to victory he suddenly placed himself in his way. Luke's speed was so great that he could not check himself. He came into collision with Tom, and in an instant both were prostrate. Tom, however, got the worst of it. He was thrown violently backward, falling on the back of his head, and lay stunned and motionless on the ice. Luke fell over him, but was scarcely hurt at all. He was up again in an instant, and might still have kept the lead, but instead he got down on his knees beside Tom and asked anxiously: \"Are you much hurt, Tom?\"  Tom didn't immediately answer, but lay breathing heavily, with his eyes still closed.  Meanwhile, Randolph, with a smile of triumph, swept on to his now assured victory. Most of the boys, however, stopped and gathered round Luke and Tom.  This accident had been watched with interest and surprise from the starting-point.  \"Tom must be a good deal hurt,\" said Linton. \"What could possibly have made him get in Luke's way?\"  \"I don't know,\" said the teacher, slowly; \"it looks strange.\"  \"It almost seemed as if he got in the way on purpose,\" Linton continued.  \"He is a friend of Randolph Duncan, is he not?\" asked the teacher, abruptly.  \"They are together about all the time.\"  \"Ha!\" commented the teacher, as if struck by an idea. He didn't, however, give expression to the thought in his mind.  A minute more, and Randolph swept into the presence of the teacher.  \"I believe I have won?\" he said, with a smile of gratification on his countenance.  \"You have come in first,\" said the teacher coldly.  \"Luke was considerably ahead when he ran into Tom,\" suggested Linton.  \"That's not my lookout,\" said Randolph, shrugging his shoulders. \"The point is that I have come in first.\"  \"Tom Harper is a friend of yours, is he not?\" asked the teacher.  \"Oh, yes!\" answered Randolph, indifferently.  \"He seems to be a good deal hurt. It was very strange that he got in Luke's way.\"  \"So it was,\" said Randolph, without betraying much interest.  \"Will you lend me your skates, Randolph?\" asked Linton. \"I should like to go out and see if I can help Tom in any way.\"  If any other boy than Linton had made the request, Randolph would have declined, but he wished, if possible, to add Linton to his list of friends, and graciously consented.  Before Linton could reach the spot, Tom had been assisted to his feet, and, with a dazed expression, assisted on either side by Luke and Edmund Blake, was on his way back to the starting-point.  \"What made you get in my way, Tom?\" asked Luke, puzzled.  \"I don't know,\" answered Tom, sullenly.  \"Are you much hurt?\"  \"I think my skull must be fractured,\" moaned Tom.  \"Oh, not so bad as that,\" said Luke, cheerfully. \"I've fallen on my head myself, but I got over it.\"  \"You didn't fall as hard as I did,\" groaned Tom.  \"No, I presume not; but heads are hard, and I guess you'll be all right in a few days.\"  Tom had certainly been severely hurt. There was a swelling on the back of his head almost as large as a hen's egg.  \"You've lost the watch, Luke,\" said Frank Acken. \"Randolph has got in first.\"  \"Yes, I supposed he would,\" answered Luke, quietly.  \"And there is Linton Tomkins coming to meet us on Randolph's skates.\"  \"Randolph is sitting down on a log taking it easy. What is your loss, Luke, is his gain.\"  \"Yes.\"  \"I think he might have come back to inquire after you, Tom, as you are a friend of his.\"  Tom looked resentfully at Randolph, and marked his complacent look, and it occurred to him also that the friend he had risked so much to serve was very ungrateful. But he hoped now, at any rate, to get the watch, and thought it prudent to say nothing.  The boys had now reached the shore.  \"Hope you're not much hurt, Tom?\" said Randolph, in a tone of mild interest.  \"I don't know but my skull is fractured,\" responded Tom, bitterly.  \"Oh, I guess not. It's the fortune of war. Well, I got in first.\"  Randolph waited for congratulations, but none came. All the boys looked serious, and more than one suspected that there had been foul play. They waited for the teacher to speak.    CHAPTER III  RANDOLPH GETS THE WATCH   \"It is true,\" said the teacher, slowly. \"Randolph has won the race.\"  Randolph's face lighted up with exultation.  \"But it is also evident,\" continued Mr. Hooper, \"that he would not have succeeded but for the unfortunate collision between Luke Larkin and Tom Harper.\"  Here some of Luke's friends brightened up.  \"I don't know about that,\" said Randolph. \"At any rate, I came in first.\"  \"I watched the race closely,\" said the teacher, \"and I have no doubt on the subject. Luke had so great a lead that he would surely have won the race.\"  \"But he didn't,\" persisted Randolph, doggedly.  \"He did not, as we all know. It is also clear that had he not stopped to ascertain the extent of Tom's injuries he still might have won.\"  \"That's so!\" said half a dozen boys.  \"Therefore I cannot accept the result as indicating the superiority of the successful contestant.\"  \"I think I am entitled to the prize,\" said Randolph.  \"I concede that; but, under the circumstances, I suggest to you that it would be graceful and proper to waive your claim and try the race over again.\"  The boys applauded, with one or two exceptions.  \"I won't consent to that, Mr. Hooper,\" said Randolph, frowning. \"I've won the prize fairly and I want it.\"  \"I am quite willing Randolph should have it, sir,\" said Luke. \"I think I should have won it if I had not stopped with Tom, but that doesn't affect the matter one way or the other. Randolph came in first, as he says, and I think he is entitled to the watch.\"  \"Then,\" said Mr. Hooper, gravely, \"there is nothing more to be said. Randolph, come forward and receive the prize.\"  Randolph obeyed with alacrity, and received the Waterbury watch from the hands of Mr. Hooper. The boys stood in silence and offered no congratulations.  \"Now, let me say,\" said the teacher, \"that I cannot understand why there was any collision at all. Tom Harper, why did you get in Luke's way?\"  \"Because I was a fool, sir,\" answered Tom, smarting from his injuries, and the evident indifference of Randolph, in whose cause he had incurred them.  \"That doesn't answer my question. Why did you act like a fool, as you expressed it?\"  \"I thought I could get out of the way in time,\" stammered Tom, who did not dare to tell the truth.  \"You had no other reason?\" asked the teacher, searchingly.  \"No, sir. What other reason could I have?\" said Tom, but his manner betrayed confusion.  \"Indeed, I don't know,\" returned the teacher, quietly. \"Your action, however, spoiled Luke's chances and insured the success of Randolph.\"  \"And got me a broken head,\" muttered Tom, placing his hand upon the swelling at the back of his head.  \"Yes, you got the worst of it. I advise you to go home and apply cold water or any other remedy your mother may suggest.\"  Randolph had already turned away, meaning to return home. Tom joined him. Randolph would gladly have dispensed with his company, but had no decent excuse, as Tom's home lay in the same direction as his.  \"Well, Randolph, you've won the watch,\" said Tom, when they were out of hearing of the other boys.  \"Yes,\" answered Randolph, indifferently. \"I don't care so much for that as for the ten dollars my father is going to give me.\"  \"That's what I thought. You've got another watch, you know--more valuable.\"  \"Well, what of it?\" said Randolph, suspiciously.  \"I think you might give me the Waterbury. I haven't got any.\"  \"Why should I give it to you?\" answered Randolph, coldly.  \"Because but for me you wouldn't have won it, nor the ten dollars, neither.\"  \"How do you make that out?\"  \"The teacher said so himself.\"  \"I don't agree to it.\"  \"You can't deny it. Luke was seven or eight rods ahead when I got in his way.\"  \"Then it was lucky for me.\"  \"It isn't lucky for me. My head hurts awfully.\"  \"I'm very sorry, of course.\"  \"That won't do me any good. Come, Randolph, give me the watch, like a good fellow.\"  \"Well, you've got cheek, I must say. I want the watch myself.\"  \"And is that all the satisfaction I am to get for my broken head?\" exclaimed Tom, indignantly.  Randolph was a thoroughly mean boy, who, if he had had a dozen watches, would have wished to keep them all for himself.  \"I've a great mind to tell Luke and the teacher of the arrangement between us.\"  \"There wasn't any arrangement,\" said Randolph, sharply. \"However, as I'm really sorry for you, I am willing to give you a quarter. There, now, don't let me hear any more about the matter.\"  He drew a silver quarter from his vest pocket and tendered it to Tom.  Tom Harper was not a sensitive boy, but his face flushed with indignation and shame, and he made no offer to take the money.  \"Keep your quarter, Randolph Duncan,\" he said scornfully. \"I think you're the meanest specimen of a boy that I ever came across. Any boy is a fool to be your friend. I don't care to keep company with you any longer.\"  \"This to me!\" exclaimed Randolph, angrily. \"This is the pay I get for condescending to let you go with me.\"  \"You needn't condescend any longer,\" said Tom, curtly, and he crossed to the other side of the street.  Randolph looked after him rather uneasily. After all, he was sorry to lose his humble follower.  \"He'll be coming round in a day or two to ask me to take him back,\" he reflected. \"I would be willing to give him ten cents more, but as for giving him the watch, he must think me a "]]]
