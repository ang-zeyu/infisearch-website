He remembered then the vial of tiny golden pellets Uvrei had given him before he left Morethis, and took one. Perhaps that was what the ancient one had meant. At any rate, Emrys thought he felt better afterward.  He examined his body in the mirror to see if bruises had come, but the tawny, muscle-rippled flesh was unmarked. At length he put on his clothes and, leaving the hotel, went to a jeweler, where he bought a costly bracelet to be sent to the girl of the night before. Such a grandiose gesture relieved him--he had always felt--of all further obligation.  He did not wish to repeat his experience with the liquor, so he did not go to a bar. He had no friends on Earth--nor could he have acknowledged them if he had. He did not wish to repeat his disappointment of the previous night, so he did not seek female companionship--although it was obvious from the eyes of the women he passed that he would have no difficulty whenever he changed his mind. But what should he do? What did young men do with their leisure, he tried to remember, when they had nothing but leisure?         *       *       *       *       *  He dined alone, finally, on a variety of rare terrestrial foods that did not taste quite as he expected, and went to the theater. The play was one he had seen a hundred times before under a hundred different names on many different planets. He went then to a nightclub, but it was crowded and noisy, and the girls did not excite him. Going back to the hotel, he found that sleep, at least, came easily.  _But I did not_, he thought, _do what I did merely for the sake of a good night's rest._  The third day, he wandered into a museum. He found himself less bored than he had expected. Perhaps culture would be most therapeutic for him until he reached his ultimate adjustments. Accordingly, he went from the museum to a revival of a nineteenth-century opera. He didn't like it; in fact, it disturbed him so much that he left before the final curtain and walked through the streets for hours, until he ran into a girl who was also walking the streets, and went home with her.  The experience with the drab, as with the courtesan, was mechanically satisfactory, emotionally inadequate. He paid her--knowing she, too, would have given herself for nothing, had she known how--and went to his hotel limp with the same not-physical weakness he had felt before. The effects of the trip or the accident were lingering. He half expected Uvrei to appear that night, but the old one did not come. Why should he? This talk of spirit-son and soul-father was sophistry; there had been a bargain and each had kept his part.  The afternoon of the fourth day, a vidicast reporter called to ask whether Emrys Shortmire was any relation to the Jan Shortmire who had invented the space-warp engines. Emrys could not deny his identity without jeopardizing his inheritance; however, he refused to be interviewed personally or let his picture be used. He did not, he said, want to be dwarfed by his father's reputation. Nonetheless, his arrival was mentioned on the newscasts and panic rose up in him when he heard his name spoken publicly.  The next day a letter came for him. People rarely wrote letters any more, except to the distant planets, yet this one had an Earth postmark. Cold with panic again, he tore it open and read:      My dear Mr. Shortmire:      This evening's vidicast informed me that you were on Earth. You     will not, I am sure, know my name. However, I was a friend of your     father's, when we were both young men, and it would give me great     pleasure to make your acquaintance.      NICHOLAS DYALL         *       *       *       *       *  Emrys crumpled up the letter and hurled it across the room. He knew Dyall for an old--associate of Jan Shortmire's, but he had not thought him to be alive. What had Dyall done to warrant the longevity treatment? He was nothing but a glorified machinist, a technician. And now he might wreck all of Emrys' plans. But if the young man made no reply, perhaps the old one would take the hint. And so it turned out; there was no further word from Nicholas Dyall.  Finally, two weeks after Emrys had first come to Earth, he got a telecall from Peter Hubbard. His documents were all in order and he could receive his inheritance as soon as he passed the physical examination.  Emrys went to the doctor's offices feeling a cold touch of apprehension again. But all Dr. Jameson said when the examination was finished was, \"You have the physique of a man fifteen years your junior, Mr. Shortmire.\"  Emrys fastened his tunic with fingers that shook from relief. \"Guess I'm lucky,\" he muttered.  The doctor cleared his throat. \"Peter Hubbard was telling me about your mother, that she was....\"  Hubbard, that old fool! And Emrys had been so sure of his discretion. \"My mother was Morethan, yes.\" Then he realized it was possible that Hubbard, too, had felt there might be something not-quite-human manifest in his body and had tried to prepare the doctor. Emrys made his tone more conciliatory. \"On both Morethis and Earth, the child takes citizenship from the father, so--\"  \"I wasn't worrying about any legal problems; I was merely thinking that medical science would be interested.\"  \"I do not wish the fact of my--of my birth publicized in any way--until after my death,\" Emrys added placatorily. \"Surely you can understand what hell life would become if people knew I was half Morethan?\"  The doctor sighed. \"Yes, I know. I can't blame you.\"  \"Tell me, Doctor,\" Emrys asked tensely, \"is there anything about me that doesn't seem ... quite human?\"  The doctor shook his head. \"Only that you're so young for your age. Mr. Shortmire, was your mother one of the caste they call the 'immortals'?\" Then he flushed. \"Forgive me. I didn't mean to violate--\"  Emrys laughed sourly. \"Don't worry; I don't hold to the Morethan beliefs. She was one of the so-called gods, yes. They do live somewhat longer than either the common people or terrestrials; I guess that's why the legend arose, probably why I look so young, too. I should be glad I didn't inherit a--less pleasant trait.\"  \"You should, indeed,\" the doctor said somberly.   III  \"I love you, Emrys,\" the woman said, and died agonizedly in his arms. He looked down at the contorted, leaden face, ravaged by sickness, and thought: _Even when she was beautiful, I could not love her._ He could not even feel sorry for her, except in a remote, intellectual way. He could not even feel sorry for himself and his own inability to feel.  Since none of the servants was left in the house--those who were still alive had fled to the country, where there was less chance of contagion--he took her body to the crematorium himself. Other people were there, consigning their grisly burdens to the automatic fires--thin, sickly creatures they were, who would soon be carrion for the firebirds themselves. Whereas he--if he had an emotion left, it would be shame--shame for the radiant youth and health that he saw mirrored in their dully wondering eyes.  Outside, the street was clamorous with the taped importunities of the empty vehicles--so many machines, because there were so few people left. But he chose to walk.  The air was sweet and clean, because the Dyall machines came and took away the bodies of those who fell in the street, and then cleaned those streets as carefully and tenderly as they had done when the walks and gutters had abounded with the vibrant slovenliness of the living. Emrys could, of course, have thrown the woman's body out into the gutter, and the machines would have carried her in their steel maws to the crematorium. But some remembered emotion had kept him from doing such a thing, and had made him give her to the flames with what small ceremony he could muster.  She had been the last mistress remaining to him, and probably, he thought, to any man in the city. Perhaps, out in the country, there might be women with life and lust in them still, but such women as were left here could no longer be considered women. This last one had not been even human for the past week; yet he had tended her--why, he could not say, except that he had nothing better to do. For one thing, she had been quieter when he was near her, and he could not bear her cries.  He was glad when she did die, because playing the good Samaritan had grown tedious as, in their turn, all other roles had palled. Even though he knew there would be no more women for him, he was glad. During the first few weeks of the plague, when everyone who had been alive had known that soon they would be dead, all the people on Earth had rushed to squander the life which suddenly seemed to fill them to bursting. Then a man could have had all the women he wanted, all of anything he wanted, for the asking, except the one thing he really wanted--the assurance of life.         *       *       *       *       *  Not everyone had plunged into an orgy of joyless pleasure. There were some who took refuge in prayer--addressed either to the traditional Deity or to the recent importations from the other planets. But, in the end, it was the same for all, prayerful and profligate alike. The only exceptions were the lucky few who seemed to be immune, like Emrys Shortmire, and those who escaped from the cities--to the country or, if they were rich, the other planets. So, even if Emrys had craved women before, he would have had enough of them by now.  As he passed through the streets, he heard a man who walked alone and talked to himself curse the name of Jan Shortmire. _They would tear me to pieces if they knew I was his flesh and blood_, Emrys thought,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/51842"],["title","Beyond Bedlam (#1)"],["body","know there were laws about taking your drugs?  There was a long pause and Mary knew she was supposed to leave. She wanted, though, to stay with Captain Thiel and talk with him. She wondered how it would be if he were appointed her father.  Mary was not hurt that her shy compliment to him had gone unnoticed. She had only wanted something to talk about. Finally she said desperately, \"Captain Thiel, how is it possible for a body to change as much from one Ego shift to another as it does between Susan and me?\"  \"There isn't all the change you imagine,\" he said. \"Have you had your first physiology?\"  \"Yes. I was very good....\" Mary saw from his smile that her inadvertent little conceit had trapped her.  \"Then, Miss Mary Walden, how do _you_ think it is possible?\"  Why did teachers and medicops have to be this way? When all you wanted was to have them talk to you, they turned everything around and made you think.  She quoted unhappily from her schoolbook, \"The main things in an ego shift are the two vegetative nervous systems that translate the conditions of either personality to the blood and other organs right from the brain. The vegetative nervous systems change the rate at which the liver burns or stores sugar and the rate at which the kidneys excrete....\"  Through the closed door to the other room, Mrs. Harris's voice raised at the visiophone said distinctly, \"_But, Mr. Walden...._\"  \"Reabsorb,\" corrected Captain Thiel.  \"What?\" She didn't know what to listen to--the medicop or the distant voice of Mrs. Harris.  \"It's better to think of the kidneys as reabsorbing salts and nutrients from the filtrated blood.\"  \"Oh.\"  \"_But, Mr. Walden, we can overdo a good thing. The proper amount of neglect is definitely required for full development of some personality types and Mary certainly is one of those...._\"  \"What about the pituitary gland that's attached to the brain and controls all the other glands during the shift of egos?\" pressed Captain Thiel distractingly.  \"_But, Mr. Walden, too much neglect at this critical point may cause another personality to split off and we can't have that. Adequate personalities are congenital. A new one now would only rob the present personalities. You are the appointed parent of this child and the Board of Education will enforce your compliance with our diagnosis...._\"  Mary's mind leaped to a page in one of her childhood storybooks. It was an illustration of a little girl resting beneath a great tree that overhung a brook. There were friendly little wild animals about. Mary could see the page clearly and she thought about it very hard instead of crying.  \"Aren't you interested any more, Mary?\" Captain Thiel was looking at her strangely.  The agitation in her voice was a surprise. \"I have to get home. I have a lot of things to do.\"  Outside, when Mrs. Harris seemed suddenly to realize that something was wrong, and delicately probed to find out whether her angry voice had been overheard, Mary said calmly and as if it didn't matter, \"Was my father home when you called him before?\"  \"Why--yes, Mary. But you mustn't pay any attention to conversations like that, darling.\"  _You can't force him to like me_, she thought to herself, and she was angry with Mrs. Harris because now her father would only dislike her more.  Neither her father nor her mother was home when Mary walked into the evening-darkened apartment. It was the first day of the family shift, and on that day, for many periods now, they had not been home until late.  Mary walked through the empty rooms, turning on lights. She passed up the electrically heated dinner her father had set out for her. Presently she found herself at the storage room door. She opened it slowly.  After hesitating a while she went in and began an exhausting search for the old storybook with the picture in it.  Finally she knew she could not find it. She stood in the middle of the junk-filled room and began to cry.         *       *       *       *       *  The day which ended for Mary Walden in lonely weeping should have been, for Conrad Manz, a pleasant rest day with an hour of rocket racing in the middle of it. Instead, he awakened with a shock to hear his wife actually _talking_ while she was _asleep_.  He stood over her bed and made certain that she was asleep. It was as though her mind thought it was somewhere else, doing something else. Vaguely he remembered that the ancients did something called _dreaming_ while they slept and the thought made him shiver.  Clara Manz was saying, \"Oh, Bill, they'll catch us. We can't pretend any more unless we have drugs. Haven't we any drugs, Bill?\"  Then she was silent and lay still. Her breathing was shallow and even in the dawn light her cheeks were deeply flushed against the blonde hair.  Having just awakened, Conrad was on a very low drug level and the incident was unpleasantly disturbing. He picked up his pharmacase from beside his bed and made his way to the bathroom. He took his hypothalamic block and the integration enzymes and returned to the bedroom. Clara was still sleeping.  She had been behaving oddly for some time, but there had never been anything as disturbing as this. He felt that he should call a medicop, but, of course, he didn't want to do anything that extreme. It was probably something with a simple explanation. Clara was a little scatterbrained at times. Maybe she had forgotten to take her sleeping compound and that was what caused _dreaming_. The very word made his powerful body chill. But if she was neglecting to take any of her drugs and he called in a medicop, it would be serious.  Conrad went into the library and found the _Family Pharmacy_. He switched on a light in the dawn-shrunken room and let his heavy frame into a chair. _A Guide to Better Understanding of your Family Prescriptions. Official Edition, 2831._ The book was mostly Medicorps propaganda and almost never gave a practical suggestion. If something went wrong, you called a medicop.  Conrad hunted through the book for the section on sleeping compound. It was funny, too, about that name Bill. Conrad went over all the men of their acquaintance with whom Clara had occasional affairs or with whom she was friendly and he couldn't remember a single Bill. In fact, the only man with that name whom he could think of was his own hyperalter, Bill Walden. But that was naturally impossible.  Maybe dreaming was always about imaginary people.      SLEEPING COMPOUND: An official mixture of soporific and     hypnotic alkaloids and synthetics. A critical drug; an essential     feature in every prescription. Slight deviations in following     prescription are unallowable because of the subtle manner in which     behavior may be altered over months or years. The first sleeping     compound was announced by Thomas Marshall in 1986. The formula has     been modified only twice since then.  There followed a tightly packed description of the chemistry and pharmacology of the various ingredients. Conrad skipped through this.      The importance of Sleeping Compound in the life of every individual     and to society is best appreciated when we recall Marshall's words     announcing its initial development:      \"It is during so-called _normal_ sleep that the vicious unconscious     mind responsible for wars and other symptoms of unhappiness     develops its resources and its hold on our conscious lives.      \"In this _normal_ sleep the critical faculties of the cortex are     paralyzed. Meanwhile, the infantile unconscious mind expands     misinterpreted experience into the toxic patterns of neurosis and     psychosis. The conscious mind takes over at morning, unaware that     these infantile motivations have been cleverly woven into its very     structure.      \"Sleeping Compound will stop this. There is no unconscious activity     after taking this harmless drug. We believe the Medicorps should at     once initiate measures to acclimatize every child to its use. In     these children, as the years go by, infantile patterns unable to     work during sleep will fight a losing battle during waking hours     with conscious patterns accumulating in the direction of     adulthood.\"  That was all there was--mostly the Medicorps patting its own back for saving humanity. But if you were in trouble and called a medicop, you'd risk getting into real trouble.  Conrad became aware of Clara standing in the doorway. The flush of her disturbed emotions and the pallor of her fatigue mixed in ragged banners on her cheeks.  Conrad waved the _Family Pharmacy_ with a foolish gesture of embarrassment.  \"Young lady, have you been neglecting to take your sleeping compound?\"  Clara turned utterly pale. \"I--I don't understand.\"  \"You were talking in your sleep.\"  \"I--was?\"  She came forward so unsteadily that he helped her to a seat. She stared at him. He asked jovially, \"Who is this 'Bill' you were so desperately involved with? Have you been having an affair I don't know about? Aren't my friends good enough for you?\"  The result of this banter was that she alarmingly began to cry, clutching her robe about her and dropping her blonde head on her knees and sobbing.         *       *       *       *       *  Children cried before they were acclimatized to the drugs, but Conrad Manz had never in his life seen an adult cry. Though he had taken his morning drugs and certain disrupting emotions were already impossible, nevertheless this sight was completely unnerving.  In gasps between her sobs, Clara was saying, \"Oh, I can't go back to taking them? But I can't keep this up! I just can't!\"  \"Clara, darling, I don't know what to say or do. I think we ought to call the Medicorps.\"  Intensely frightened, she rose and clung to him, begging, \"Oh, no, Conrad, that isn't necessary! It isn't necessary at all. I've only neglected to take my sleeping compound and it won't happen again. All I need is a sleeping compound. Please get my pharmacase for me and it will be all right.\"  She"]]]
