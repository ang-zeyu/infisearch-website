That sort of thing must stop, if I was going to get anywhere in my run through the maze. Too abrupt a change in the manners and morals of Winfred Tompkins, however, might arouse suspicion.  \"Any news today, Mary?\" I asked.  \"Nothing, sir. The kennels telephoned to say that Ponto had made a miraculous recovery and could come home tomorrow. I had them send word to the Club to tell you. And Mrs. Tompkins, as I said, forgot to eat her apple.\"  I looked at her. This was a cue. I mustn't miss it.  \"And the doctor didn't keep away?\" I asked.  \"Him? I should say not! Mrs. Tompkins felt quite unsettled right after lunch and phoned Dr. Rutherford to come over. He's with her now, upstairs, giving her an examination.\" She rolled her eyes significantly in the direction of the second story.  \"Wait a few minutes till I catch my breath and get my bearings, Mary,\" I said, \"and then tell Mrs. Tompkins most discreetly, if you know what I mean, that I have returned and am waiting in my--\" I waved vaguely at the room.  \"In your den, sir,\" she agreed. \"The name is Myrtle.\"  The den was one of those things I have never attained, perhaps because I never wanted to. There was a field-stone fireplace, over which the antlered head of a small stag presided with four upturned feet--like a calf in a butcher shop--that held two well dusted shotguns. The walls were lined with books up to a dado--books in sets, with red morocco and gilt bindings: Dickens, Thackeray, Surtees, Robert Louis Stevenson, Dumas, Balzac and similar standard authors--all highly respectable and mostly unread. On the table, beside a humidor and cigarette cases, was a formidable array of unused pipes. Above the shelves, the walls were adorned with etchings of ducks: ducks sitting, ducks swimming, ducks nesting, ducks flying and ducks hanging dead. It was as though Winnie's conscience or attorney had advised him: \"You can't go wrong on ducks, old boy!\" Instead, he had gone wild.  In one corner of the den my unregenerate Navy eye discerned a small portable bar, with gleaming glasses, decanters and syphons. Further investigation was rewarded by the makings of a very fair Scotch-and-soda. To my annoyance, the cigarette box contained only de luxe Benson & Hedges--it would!--while I am a sucker for Tareytons. Still, any cigarette is better than no cigarette. A little mooching around the fireplace revealed the switch which turned on an electric fire, ingeniously contrived to represent an expensive Manhattan architect's idea of smouldering peat. The whole effect was very cosy in the \"Town and Country\" sense--a gentleman's gun-room--and I had settled down most comfortably on the broad leather divan in front of this synthetic blaze when I was interrupted by an angry, tenor voice.  \"I say, Tompkins,\" soared the voice. \"I thought we had agreed to be civilized about this thing.\"  I raised my head to see a lean, dark-haired, dapper little man, with a dinky little British Raj mustache and a faint odor of antiseptics, glaring at me from the doorway.  \"Dr. Rutherford, I presume!\" I remarked.  \"Yes, Winnie,\" came a pleasant but irritated womanly voice from somewhere behind the doctor, \"and I too would like to know what this means.\"  \"Is that you, Jimmie?\" I guessed.  \"Of course it's me! Who else did you expect? One of those flashy blondes from your office?\"  \"Sh!\" shushed the doctor reprovingly. \"What about Virginia? What have you done with her?\"  This required serious thought. The glass of Scotch was a good alibi for amnesia. \"To whom do you refer?\" I asked, putting a slight thickness into my voice.  \"To Virginia, my wife!\" he snapped. \"We agreed--it was understood between the four of us--\"  I shook my head virtuously. \"I haven't set eyes on her all day,\" I said. \"I don't know where she is and I refuse to be held responsible for her in any particular. She's your look-out, not mine.\"  \"Why, you!--\" The doctor started forward, menacing me with his surgical little fists.  \"Wait a minute, Jerry,\" the contralto voice ordered. \"Let me handle this!\"  Germaine Tompkins stepped forward into the room and stood in the flickering light of the electric peat. \"Tell me, Winnie,\" she asked, \"has anything gone wrong?\"  My wife was a tall, slim girl, with dark eyes, dark hair parted sleekly in the 1860 style, and a cool, slender neck. She was wearing something low-cut in black velvet, with a white cameo brooch at the \"V\" of a bodice which suggested a potentially undemure Quakeress. I noticed that she had angry eyes, a sulky mouth and a puzzled expression.  \"I'm sorry, Jimmie,\" I replied, after a good look at her, \"but I have decided that I simply couldn't go through with it.\"  \"Do you mean to say--\" Dr. Rutherford began, only to be hushed by Germaine. \"Let me handle him, Jerry,\" she whispered. \"You'd better go. He's tight. I'll phone you in the morning.\"  \"All right, if you say so, dear,\" the doctor obeyed.  \"And be sure to send me a bill for this call,\" I added. \"Professional services and what-not. And don't come back to my house without my personal invitation.\"  Dr. Rutherford emitted a muttered comment and disappeared into the gloom of the hall. My wife followed him and I could hear a series of confused and comforting whispers sending him on his way. I had finished my Scotch and poured myself another before my wife rejoined me.  \"Have a drink?\" I asked.  \"No thank you!\" she snapped.  \"Mad at me?\"  \"What do you think?\" Her tone was cool enough to freeze lava.  \"You have every right to be!\" That answer, I had found by experience, was unanswerable.  \"What do you mean?\" she asked in some bewilderment. \"Yes, thanks, I will have a drink after all. You see, Winnie, after we had talked it all over the other night after the Bond Rally Dance and realized how we felt about it all, the four of us decided to be--well--civilized about things. And now--\"  \"I don't feel civilized about my wife,\" I said, pouring her a stiff one.  Her eyes glittered and her cheek was tinged with color. In spite of her anger, she responded to the idea of male brutes contesting for her favor.  \"I didn't think you cared a damn,\" she said at last, \"and it's pretty late in the day to make a change now. After all, there is Virginia.\"  That was the cue to clinch the situation. \"To hell with Virginia!\" I announced. \"I'd rather live with you as your friend than sleep with la Rutherford in ten thousand beds. I can't help it,\" I added boyishly.  She leaned forward and sniffed. \"You _have_ been drinking, haven't you?\" she remarked.  \"Of course I have! Today, in town, I suddenly realized what a damn fool I'd been to throw away something really fine for something very second-rate. So I drank. Too much. And the more I drank the more I knew that I was right and that it was here where I belong, with you. If you don't want me to stay, I'll go over to the Country Club for the night. I'll even phone Jerry Rutherford for you--him and his moustache--but I'm damned if I'll go running back to Virginia. She's not pukka!\" (\"How'm I doing?\" I added silently for the benefit of the Master of Ceremonies.)  \"Well--\" she said, after a long pause. \"Perhaps--It's so mixed up--Perhaps you'd better go to bed here and we can talk it over in the morning. All of us.\"  I shook my head. \"I don't want to hold any more mass-meetings on the state of our mutual affections. If you want that tenor tonsil-snatcher, you're welcome to him but I'm damned if I'll be a good sport about it. If you insist, I'll buy you a divorce, but I won't marry Virginia--that's final!\"  Germaine's face relaxed. She smiled. \"We'll see how things look to you in the morning,\" she said.  Now was the time to play the trump card.  \"Oh yes,\" I said. \"I brought home a present for you.\"  I walked over to the hanger in the corner and pulled the Tiffany packages from my overcoat pocket.  \"Here you are, Jimmie Tompkins,\" I said, \"with all my alleged love.\"  \"Alleged is right!\" But she picked eagerly at the wrappings and swiftly ferreted out the diamond brooch. \"Why, Winnie, it's lovely--\" she began, then whirled on me, her eyes blazing. \"Is this a joke?\" she demanded.  \"Of course not! What's the matter?\"  Her laugh was wild. \"Oh, nothing, Winnie. Nothing at all. It's just that you should have decided to give _me_--on _her_ birthday--a brooch with her initials in diamonds. See them! V.M.R.\"  So that's the catch, I thought. I should have guessed there would be something wrong with the set-up and I kicked myself for not having bothered to trace out the monogram.  \"Don't you see what I mean,\" I grated, \"or must I spell it out for you? Some time back, when we were considering all this civilized swapping of husbands and wives, I put in the order at Tiffany's for Virginia's birthday present. Today, when I picked it up, the clerk smirked at me--he knows your initials don't begin with V--and I suddenly knew I couldn't go ahead with the whole business. So I brought the brooch back to you as a trophy, if you want it. You can do what you like about it. It's yours. You see, Jimmie,\" I added, \"that's the way things are. I'm burning all my bridges.\"  \"Oh!\" she said. Then after a long pause, she added, \"Ah!\"  \"I don't think,\" she remarked, after another pause, \"that I'll want to keep this and I'm far too fond of Virginia Rutherford to humiliate her. I think I'll just take this back to Tiffany's and get something else.\"  So I had led trumps.  \"Here's something else to be going on with,\" I told her. \"I got this for you, anyhow, win, lose or draw\"--and I produced the gold bracelet. \"I thought it would go with that dress and your cameo and--if you still want to wear it--your"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/51855"],["title","Slave Planet (#1)"],["body","see why whatever's done here should occupy them--\"  \"Because you're not seeing them,\" Dr. Haenlingen said. \"Because you're thinking of the Confederation, not the people who compose the Confederation, all of the people on Mars, and Venus, the moons and Earth. The Confederation itself--the government--really doesn't care. Why should it? But the people do--or would.\"  \"Oh,\" Norma said, and then: \"Oh. Of course.\"  \"That's right,\" Dr. Haenlingen said. \"They hear about freedom, and all the rest, as soon as they're old enough to hear about anything. It's part of every subject they study in school, it's part of the world they live in, it's like the air they breathe. They can't question it: they can't even think about it.\"  \"And, of course, if they hear about Fruyling's World--\"  \"There won't be any way to disguise the fact,\" Dr. Haenlingen said. \"In the long run, there never is. And the fact will shock them into action. As long as they continue to live in that air of freedom and justice and equality under the law, they'll want to stop what we're doing here. They'll have to.\"  \"I see,\" Nonna said. \"Of course.\"  Dr. Haenlingen, still looking out at the world below, smiled faintly. \"Slavery,\" she said, \"is such an _ugly_ word.\"     2   The Commons Room of the Third Building of City One was a large affair, whose three bare metal walls enclosed more space than any other single living-quarters room in the Building; but the presence of the fourth wall made it seem tiny. That wall was nearly all window, a non-shatterable clear plastic immensely superior to that laboratory material, glass. It displayed a single unbroken sweep of forty feet, and it looked down on the forests of Fruyling's World from a height of sixteen stories. Men new to the Third Building usually sat with their backs to that enormous window, and even the eldest inhabitants usually placed their chairs somehow out of line with it, and looked instead at the walls, at their companions, or at their own hands.  Fruyling's World was disturbing, and not only because of the choking profusion of forest that always seemed to threaten the isolated clusters of human residence. A man could get used to forests. But at any moment, looking down or out across the gray-green vegetation, that man might catch sight of a native--an Elder, perhaps heading slowly out toward the Birth Huts hidden in the lashing trees, or a group of Small Ones being herded into the Third Building itself for their training. It was hard, perhaps impossible, to get used to that: when you had to see the natives you steeled yourself for the job. When you didn't have to see them you counted yourself lucky and called yourself relaxed.  It wasn't that the natives were hideous, either. Their very name had been given to them by men in a kind of affectionate mockery, since they weren't advanced enough even to have such a group-name of their own as \"the people.\" They were called Alberts, after a half-forgotten character in a mistily-remembered comic strip dating back before space travel, before the true beginnings of Confederation history. If you ignored the single, Cyclopean eye, the rather musty smell and a few other even more minor details, they looked rather like two-legged alligators four feet tall, green as jewels, with hopeful grins on their faces and an awkward, waddling walk like a penguin's. Seen without preconceptions they might have been called cute.  But no man on Fruyling's World could see the Alberts without preconceptions. They were not Alberts: they were slaves, as the men were masters. And slavery, named and accepted, has traditionally been harder on the master than the slave.  John Dodd, twenty-seven years old, master, part of the third generation, arranged his chair carefully so that it faced the door of the Commons Room, letting the light from the great window illumine the back of his head. He clasped his hands in his lap in a single, nervous gesture, never noticing that the light gave him a faint saintlike halo about his feathery hair. His companion took another chair, set it at right angles to Dodd's and gave it long and thoughtful consideration, as if the act of sitting down were something new and untried.  \"It's good to be off-duty,\" Dodd said violently. \"Good. Not to have to see them--not to have to think about them until tomorrow.\"  The standing man, shorter than Dodd and built heavily, actually turned and looked out at the window. \"And then tomorrow what do you do?\" he asked. \"Give up your job? You're just letting the thing get you, Johnny.\"  \"I'd give up my job in twenty seconds if I thought it would do any good,\" Dodd said. He shook his head. \"I give up a job here in the Buildings, and then what do I do? Go out and starve in the jungle? Nobody's done it, nobody's ever done it.\"  \"Well?\" the squat man said. \"Is that an excuse?\"  Dodd sighed. \"Those who work get fed,\" he said. \"And housed. And clothed. And--God help us--entertained, by 3D tapes older than our fathers are. If a man didn't work he'd get--cast out. Cut off.\"  \"There's more than 3D tapes,\" the squat man said, and grinned.  \"Sure.\" Dodd's voice was tired. \"But think about it for a minute, Albin. Do you know what we've got here?\"  \"We've got a nice, smooth setup,\" Albin said. \"No worries, no fights, a job to do and a place to do it in, time to relax, time to have fun. It's okay.\"  There was a little silence. Dodd's voice seemed more distant. \"Marxian economics,\" he said. \"Perfect Marxian economics, on a world that would make old Karl spin in his grave like an electron.\"  \"I guess so,\" Albin said. \"History's not my field. But--given the setup, what else could there be? What other choice have you got?\"  \"I don't know.\" Again a silence. Dodd's hands unclasped: he made a gesture as if he were sweeping something away from his face. \"There ought to be something else. Even on Earth, even before the Confederation, there were conscientious objectors.\"  \"History again,\" Albin said. He walked a few steps toward the window. \"Anyhow, that was for war.\"  \"I don't know,\" Dodd said. His hands went back into his lap, and his eyes closed. He spoke, now, like a man in a dream. \"There used to be all kinds of jobs. I guess there still are, in the Confederation. On Earth. Back home where none of us have ever been.\" He repeated the words like an echo: \"Back home.\" In the silence nothing interrupted him: behind his head light poured in from the giant window. \"A man could choose his own job,\" he went on, in the same tone. \"He could be a factory-worker or a professor or a truck-driver or a musician or--a lot of jobs. A man didn't have to work at one, whether he wanted to or not.\"  \"All right,\" Albin said. \"Okay. So suppose you had your choice. Suppose every job in every damn history you've ever heard of was open to you. Just what would you pick? Make a choice. Go ahead, make--\"  \"It isn't funny, Albin,\" Dodd said woodenly. \"It isn't a game.\"  \"Okay, it isn't,\" Albin said. \"So make it a game. Just for a minute. Think over all the jobs you can and make a choice. You don't like being here, do you? You don't like working with the Alberts. So where would you like to be? What would you like to do?\" He came back to the chair, his eyes on Dodd, and sat suddenly down, his elbows on his knees and his chin cupped in his hands, facing Dodd like a gnome out of pre-history. \"Go on,\" he said. \"Make a choice.\"  \"Okay,\" Dodd said without opening his eyes. His voice became more distant, dreamlike. \"Okay,\" he said again. \"I--there isn't one job, but maybe a kind of job. Something to do with growing things.\" There was a pause. \"I'd like to work somewhere growing things. I'd like to work with plants. They're all right, plants. They don't make you feel anything.\" The voice stopped.  \"Plants?\" Albin hooted gigantically. \"Good God, think about it! You're stuck on a planet that's over seventy per cent plant life--trees and weeds and jungles all over the land and even mats of green stuff covering the oceans and riding on the rivers--a planet that's just about nothing but plants, a king-sized hothouse for every kind of leaf and blade and flower and fruit you could ever dream up--\"  \"It's not the same,\" Dodd said.  \"You,\" Albin said, \"are out of your head. So if you're crazy for plants, so grow them in your spare time. If you've got a window in your room you can put up a window-box. If not, something else. Me, I think it's damn silly: with the plants all around here, what's the sense of growing more? But if you like it, God knows Fruyling's World is ready to provide it for you.\"  \"As a hobby,\" Dodd said flatly.  \"Well, then, a hobby,\" Albin said. \"If you're interested in it.\"  \"Interested.\" The word was like an echo. A silence fell. Albin's eyes studied Dodd, the thin face and the play of light on the hair. After a while he shrugged.  \"So it isn't plants,\" he said. \"It isn't any more than the Alberts and working with them. You want to do anything to get away from them--anything that won't remind you you have to go back.\"  \"Sure,\" Dodd said. \"Sure I do. So do all of us.\"  \"Not me,\" Albin said instantly. \"Not me, brother. I get my food and my clothing and my shelter, just like good old Marx, I guess, says I should. I'm a trainer for the Alberts, supportive work in the refining process, and some day I'll be a master trainer and get a little more pay, a little more status, you know?\" He grinned and sat straight. \"What the hell,\" he said \"It's a job. It pays my way. And there's enough leisure time for fun--and when I say fun I don't mean 3D tapes, Dodd. I really don't.\"  \"But you--\"  \"Look,\" Albin said. \"That's what's wrong with you, kid. You talk as if we all had nothing to do but work and watch tapes. What you need is a little education--a little real education--and I'm the one to give it to you.\"  Dodd opened his eyes. They looked very large and flat, like the eyes of a jungle animal. \"I don't need education,\" he said. \"And I don't need hobbies. I need to get off this planet,"]]]
