Klea greeted her sister with a loving glance but without speaking; she seemed too exhausted for words and she wiped the drops from her forehead with the linen veil that covered the back of her head as she seated herself on the lid of the chest.  Irene immediately glanced at the empty trencher, considering whether she had best confess her guilt to the wearied girl and beg for forgiveness, or divert the scolding she had deserved by some jest, as she had often succeeded in doing before.  This seemed the easier course and she adopted it at once; she went up to her sister quickly, but not quite unconcernedly, and said with mock gravity:  \"Look here, Klea, don't you notice anything in me?  I must look like a crocodile that has eaten a whole hippopotamus, or one of the sacred snakes after it has swallowed a rabbit.  Only think when I had eaten my own bread I found yours between my teeth--quite unexpectedly--but now--\"  Klea, thus addressed, glanced at the empty platter and interrupted her sister with a low-toned exclamation.  \"Oh! I was so hungry.\"  The words expressed no reproof, only utter exhaustion, and as the young criminal looked at her sister and saw her sitting there, tired and worn out but submitting to the injury that had been done her without a word of complaint, her heart, easily touched, was filled with compunction and regret.  She burst into tears and threw herself on the ground before her, clasping her knees and crying, in a voice broken with sobs:  \"Oh Klea! poor, dear Klea, what have I done! but indeed I did not mean any harm.  I don't know how it happened.  Whatever I feel prompted to do I do, I can't help doing it, and it is not till it is done that I begin to know whether it was right or wrong.  You sat up and worried yourself for me, and this is how I repay you--I am a bad girl!  But you shall not go hungry--no, you shall not.\"  \"Never mind; never mind,\" said the elder, and she stroked her sister's brown hair with a loving hand.  But as she did so she came upon the violets fastened among the shining tresses.  Her lips quivered and her weary expression changed as she touched the flowers and glanced at the empty saucer in which she had carefully placed them the clay before.  Irene at once perceived the change in her sister's face, and thinking only that she was surprised at her pretty adornment, she said gaily:  \"Do you think the flowers becoming to me?\"  Klea's hand was already extended to take the violets out of the brown plaits, for her sister was still kneeling before her, but at this question her arm dropped, and she said more positively and distinctly than she had yet spoken and in a voice, whose sonorous but musical tones were almost masculine and certainly remarkable in a girl:  \"The bunch of flowers belongs to me; but keep it till it is faded, by mid-day, and then return it to me.\"  \"It belongs to you?\"  repeated the younger girl, raising her eyes in surprise to her sister, for to this hour what had been Klea's had been hers also.  \"But I always used to take the flowers you brought home; what is there special in these?\"  \"They are only violets like any other violets,\" replied Klea coloring deeply.  \"But the queen has worn them.\"  \"The queen!\"  cried her sister springing to her feet and clasping her hands in astonishment.  \"She gave you the flowers?  And you never told me till now?  To be sure when you came home from the procession yesterday you only asked me how my foot was and whether my clothes were whole and then not another mortal word did you utter.  Did Cleopatra herself give you this bunch?\"  \"How should she?\"  retorted Klea.  \"One of her escort threw them to me; but drop the subject pray!  Give me the water, please, my mouth is parched and I can hardly speak for thirst.\"  The bright color dyed her cheeks again as she spoke, but Irene did not observe it, for--delighted to make up for her evil doings by performing some little service--she ran to fetch the water-jar; while Klea filled and emptied her wooden bowl she said, gracefully lifting a small foot, to show to her sister:  \"Look, the cut is almost healed and I can wear my sandal again.  Now I shall tie it on and go and ask Serapion for some bread for you and perhaps he will give us a few dates.  Please loosen the straps for me a little, here, round the ankle, my skin is so thin and tender that a little thing hurts me which you would hardly feel.  At mid-day I will go with you and help fill the jars for the altar, and later in the day I can accompany you in the procession which was postponed from yesterday.  If only the queen and the great foreigner should come again to look on at it!  That would be splendid!  Now, I am going, and before you have drunk the last bowl of water you shall have some bread, for I will coax the old man so prettily that he can't say 'no.'\"  Irene opened the door, and as the broad sunlight fell in it lighted up tints of gold in her chestnut hair, and her sister looking after her could almost fancy that the sunbeams had got entangled with the waving glory round her head.  The bunch of violets was the last thing she took note of as Irene went out into the open air; then she was alone and she shook her head gently as she said to herself:  \"I give up everything to her and what I have left she takes from me.  Three times have I met the Roman, yesterday he gave me the violets, and I did want to keep those for myself--and now--\"  As she spoke she clasped the bowl she still held in her hand closely to her and her lips trembled pitifully, but only for an instant; she drew herself up and said firmly:  \"But it is all as it should be.\"  Then she was silent; she set down the water-jar on the chest by her side, passed the back of her hand across her forehead as if her head were aching, then, as she sat gazing down dreamily into her lap, her weary head presently fell on her shoulder and she was asleep.     CHAPTER II.  The low brick building of which the sisters' room formed a part, was called the Pastophorium, and it was occupied also by other persons attached to the service of the temple, and by numbers of pilgrims.  These assembled here from all parts of Egypt, and were glad to pass a night under the protection of the sanctuary.  Irene, when she quitted her sister, went past many doors--which had been thrown open after sunrise--hastily returning the greetings of many strange as well as familiar faces, for all glanced after her kindly as though to see her thus early were an omen of happy augury, and she soon reached an outbuilding adjoining the northern end of the Pastophorium; here there was no door, but at the level of about a man's height from the ground there were six unclosed windows opening on the road.  From the first of these the pale and much wrinkled face of an old man looked down on the girl as she approached.  She shouted up to him in cheerful accents the greeting familiar to the Hellenes \"Rejoice!\"  But he, without moving his lips, gravely and significantly signed to her with his lean hand and with a glance from his small, fixed and expressionless eyes that she should wait, and then handed out to her a wooden trencher on which lay a few dates and half a cake of bread.  \"For the altar of the god?\"  asked the girl.  The old man nodded assent, and Irene went on with her small load, with the assurance of a person who knows exactly what is required of her; but after going a few steps and before she had reached the last of the six windows she paused, for she plainly heard voices and steps, and presently, at the end of the Pastophorium towards which she was proceeding and which opened into a small grove of acacias dedicated to Serapis--which was of much greater extent outside the enclosing wall--appeared a little group of men whose appearance attracted her attention; but she was afraid to go on towards the strangers, so, leaning close up to the wall of the houses, she awaited their departure, listening the while to what they were saying.  In front of these early visitors to the temple walked a man with a long staff in his right hand speaking to the two gentlemen who followed, with the air of a professional guide, who is accustomed to talk as if he were reading to his audience out of an invisible book, and whom the hearers are unwilling to interrupt with questions, because they know that his knowledge scarcely extends beyond exactly what he says.  Of his two remarkable-looking hearers one was wrapped in a long and splendid robe and wore a rich display of gold chains and rings, while the other wore nothing over his short chiton but a Roman toga thrown over his left shoulder.  His richly attired companion was an old man with a full and beardless face and thin grizzled hair.  Irene gazed at him with admiration and astonishment, but when she had feasted her eyes on the stuffs and ornaments he wore, she fixed them with much greater interest and attention on the tall and youthful figure at his side.  \"Like Hui, the cook's fat poodle, beside a young lion,\" thought she to herself, as she noted the bustling step of the one and the independent and elastic gait of the other.  She felt irresistibly tempted to mimic the older man, but this audacious impulse was soon quelled for scarcely had the guide explained to the Roman that it was here that those pious recluses had their cells who served the god in voluntary captivity, as being consecrated to Serapis, and that they received their food through those windows--here he pointed upwards with his staff when suddenly a shutter, which the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5462"],["title","The Sisters — Volume 2 (#1)"],["body","placed on little tables of elegant workmanship.  Like all the other furniture in the queen's dressing-tent these were made of gleaming ivory, standing out in fine relief from the tent-cloth which was sky-blue woven with silver lilies and ears of corn, and from the tiger-skins which covered all the cushions, while white woollen carpets, bordered with a waving scroll in blue, were spread on the ground.  The queen threw herself on a seat in front of her dressing-table, and sat staring at herself in a mirror, as if she now saw her face and her abundant, reddish-fair hair for the first time; then she said, half turning to Zoe and half to her favorite Athenian waiting-maid, who stood behind her with her other women:  \"It was folly to dye my dark hair light; but now it may remain so, for Publius Scipio, who has no suspicion of our arts, thought this color pretty and uncommon, and never will know its origin.  That Egyptian headdress with the vulture's head which the king likes best to see me in, the young Greek Lysias and the Roman too, call barbaric, and so every one must call it who is not interested in the Egyptians.  But to-night we are only ourselves, so I will wear the chaplet of golden corn with sapphire grapes.  Do you think, Zoe, that with that I could wear the dress of transparent bombyx silk that came yesterday from Cos?  But no, I will not wear that, for it is too slight a tissue, it hides nothing and I am now too thin for it to become me.  All the lines in my throat show, and my elbows are quite sharp--altogether I am much thinner.  That comes of incessant worry, annoyance, and anxiety.  How angry I was yesterday at the council, because my husband will always give way and agree and try to be pleasant; whenever a refusal is necessary I have to interfere, unwilling as I am to do it, and odious as it is to me always to have to stir up discontent, disappointment, and disaffection, to take things on myself and to be regarded as hard and heartless in order that my husband may preserve undiminished the doubtful glory of being the gentlest and kindest of men and princes.  My son's having a will of his own leads to agitating scenes, but even that is better than that Philopator should rush into everybody's arms.  The first thing in bringing up a boy should be to teach him to say 'no.'  I often say 'yes' myself when I should not, but I am a woman, and yielding becomes us better than refusal--and what is there of greater importance to a woman than to do what becomes her best, and to seem beautiful?  \"I will decide on this pale dress, and put over it the net-work of gold thread with sapphire knots; that will go well with the head-dress.  Take care with your comb, Thais, you are hurting me!  Now--I must not chatter any more.  Zoe, give me the roll yonder; I must collect my thoughts a little before I go down to talk among men at the banquet.  When we have just come from visiting the realm of death and of Serapis, and have been reminded of the immortality of the soul and of our lot in the next world, we are glad to read through what the most estimable of human thinkers has said concerning such things.  Begin here, Zoe.\"  Cleopatra's companion, thus addressed, signed to the unoccupied waiting- women to withdraw, seated herself on a low cushion opposite the queen, and began to read with an intelligent and practised intonation; the reading went on for some time uninterrupted by any sound but the clink of metal ornaments, the rustle of rich stuffs, the trickle of oils or perfumes as they were dropped into the crystal bowls, the short and whispered questions of the women who were attiring the queen, or Cleopatra's no less low and rapid answers.  All the waiting-women not immediately occupied about the queen's person-- perhaps twenty in all, young and old-ranged themselves along the sides of the great tent, either standing or sitting on the ground or on cushions, and awaiting the moment when it should be their turn to perform some service, as motionless as though spellbound by the mystical words of a magician.  They only made signs to each other with their eyes and fingers, for they knew that the queen did not choose to be disturbed when she was being read to, and that she never hesitated to cast aside anything or anybody that crossed her wishes or inclinations, like a tight shoe or a broken lutestring.  Her features were irregular and sharp, her cheekbones too strongly developed, and the lips, behind which her teeth gleamed pearly white- though too widely set--were too full; still, so long as she exerted her great powers of concentration, and listened with flashing eyes, like those of a prophetess, and parted lips to the words of Plato, her face had worn an indescribable glow of feeling, which seemed to have come upon her from a higher and better world, and she had looked far more beautiful than now when she was fully dressed, and when her women crowded round leer--Zoe having laid aside the Plato--with loud and unmeasured flattery.  Cleopatra delighted in being thus feted, and, in order to enjoy the adulation of a throng, she would always when dressing have a great number of women to attend her toilet; mirrors were held up to her on every side, a fold set right, and the jewelled straps of her sandals adjusted.  One praised the abundance of her hair, another the slenderness of her form, the slimness of her ankles, and the smallness of her tiny hands and feet.  One maiden remarked to another--but loud enough to be heard-- on the brightness of her eyes which were clearer than the sapphires on her brow, while the Athenian waiting-woman, Thais, declared that Cleopatra had grown fatter, for her golden belt was less easy to clasp than it had been ten days previously.  The queen presently signed to Zoe, who threw a little silver ball into a bowl of the same metal, elaborately wrought and decorated, and in a few minutes the tramp of the body-guard was audible outside the door of the tent.  Cleopatra went out, casting a rapid glance over the roof--now brightly illuminated with cressets and torches--and the white marble statues that gleamed out in relief against the dark clumps of shrubs; and then, without even looking at the tent where her children were asleep, she approached the litter, which had been brought up to the roof for her by the young Macedonian nobles.  Zoe and Thais assisted her to mount into it, and her ladies, waiting-women, and others who had hurried out of the other tents, formed a row on each side of the way, and hailed their mistress with loud cries of admiration and delight as she passed by, lifted high above them all on the shoulders of her bearers.  The diamonds in the handle of her feather-fan sparkled brightly as Cleopatra waved a gracious adieu to her women, an adieu which did not fail to remind them how infinitely beneath her were those she greeted.  Every movement of her hand was full of regal pride, and her eyes, unveiled and untempered, were radiant with a young woman's pleasure in a perfect toilet, with satisfaction in her own person, and with the anticipation of the festive hours before her.  The litter disappeared behind the door of the broad steps that led up to the roof, and Thais, sighing softly, said to herself, \"If only for once I could ride through the air in just such a pretty shell of colored and shining mother-of-pearl, like a goddess! carried aloft by young men, and hailed and admired by all around me!  High up there the growing Selene floats calmly and silently by the tiny stars, and just so did she ride past in her purple robe with her torch-bearers and flames and lights-past us humble creatures, and between the tents to the banquet--and to what a banquet, and what guests!  Everything up here greets her with rejoicing, and I could almost fancy that among those still marble statues even the stern face of Zeno had parted its lips, and spoken flattering words to her.  And yet poor little Zoe, and the fair-haired Lysippa, and the black-haired daughter of Demetrius, and even I, poor wretch, should be handsomer, far handsomer than she, if we could dress ourselves with fine clothes and jewels for which kings would sell their kingdoms; if we could play Aphrodite as she does, and ride off in a shell borne aloft on emerald-green glass to look as if it were floating on the waves; if dolphins set with pearls and turquoises served us for a footstool, and white ostrich-plumes floated over our heads, like the silvery clouds that float over Athens in the sky of a fine spring day.  The transparent tissue that she dared not put on would well become me!  If only that were true which Zoe was reading yesterday, that the souls of men were destined to visit the earth again and again in new forms!  Then perhaps mine might some day come into the world in that of a king's child.  I should not care to be a prince, so much is expected of him, but a princess indeed! That would be lovely!\"  These and such like were Thais' dreams, while Zoe stood outside the tent of the royal children with her cousin, the chief-attendant of prince Philopator, carrying on an eager conversation in a low tone.  The child's nurse from time to time dried her eyes and sobbed bitterly as she said: \"My own baby, my other children, my husband and our beautiful house in Alexandria--I left them all to suckle and rear a prince.  I have sacrificed happiness, freedom, and my nights'-sleep for the sake of the queen and of this child, and how am I repaid for all this?  As if I were a lowborn wench instead of the daughter and wife of noble men; this woman, half a child still, scarcely yet nineteen, dismisses me from her service before you and all her ladies every ten days!  And why?  Because the ungoverned blood of her race flows in her son's veins, and because he does not rush into the arms of a mother who for days does not ask for him at all, and never troubles herself about him but in some idle moment when she has gratified every other whim."]]]
