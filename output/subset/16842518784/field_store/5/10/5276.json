This kind of appeal does not go down with the ordinary man and woman--first, because there are many who think that in spite of occasional hardships the public advantage is, on the whole, very well served by the existing laws; secondly, because any alterations which might be desirable could very easily be made without recourse to woman's suffrage; and thirdly, because the suffragist consistently acts on the principle of bringing up against man everything that can possibly be brought up against him, and of never allowing anything to appear on the credit side of the ledger.  The arguments which the woman suffragist really places confidence in are those which are provided by undefined general principles, apothegms set out in the form of axioms, formulae which are vehicles for fallacies, ambiguous abstract terms, and \"question-begging\" epithets. Your ordinary unsophisticated man and woman stand almost helpless against arguments of this kind.  For these bring to bear moral pressure upon human nature.  And when the intellect is confused by a word or formula which conveys an ethical appeal, one may very easily find oneself committed to action which one's unbiased reason would never have approved. The very first requirement in connexion with any word or phrase which conveys a moral exhortation is, therefore, to analyse it and find out its true signification. For all such concepts as justice, rights, freedom, chivalry--and it is with these that we shall be specially concerned--are, when properly defined and understood beacon-lights, but when ill understood and undefined, stumbling-blocks in the path of humanity.  We may appropriately begin by analysing the term \"Woman's Rights\" and the correlative formula \"Woman has a right to the suffrage.\"  Our attention here immediately focuses upon the term _right_.  It is one of the most important of the verbal agents by which the suffragist hopes to bring moral pressure to bear upon man.  Now, the term _right_ denotes in its juridical sense a debt which is owed to us by the State. A right is created when the community binds itself to us, its individual members, to intervene by force to restrain any one from interfering with us, and to protect us in the enjoyment of our faculties, privileges, and property.  The term is capable of being given a wider meaning.  While no one could appropriately speak of our having a _right_ to health or anything that man has not the power to bestow, it is arguable that there are, independent of and antecedent to law, elementary rights: a right to freedom; a right to protection against personal violence; a right to the protection of our property; and a right to the impartial administration of regulations which are binding upon all. Such a use of the term _right_ could be justified on the ground that everybody would be willing to make personal sacrifices, and to combine with his fellows for the purpose of securing these essentials--an understanding which would almost amount to legal sanction.  The suffragist who employs the term \"Woman's _Rights_\" does not employ the word rights in either of these senses. Her case is analogous to that of a man who should in a republic argue about the divine _right_ of kings; or that of the Liberal who should argue that it was his _right_ to live permanently under a Liberal government; or of any member of a minority who should, with a view of getting what he wants, argue that he was contending only for his rights.  The woman suffragist is merely bluffing.  Her formula \"_Woman's Rights_\" means simply \"_Woman's Claims_.\"  For the moment--for we shall presently be coming back to the question of the enforcement of rights--our task is to examine the arguments which the suffragist brings forward in support of her claims.  First and chief among these is the argument that the _Principle of Justice_ prescribes that women should be enfranchised.  When we inquire what the suffragist understands under the Principle of Justice, one receives by way of answer only the _petitio principii [question begging]_ that Justice is a moral principle which includes woman suffrage among its implications.  In reality it is only very few who clearly apprehend the nature of Justice. For under this appellation two quite different principles are confounded.  The primary and correct signification of the term Justice will perhaps be best arrived at by pursuing the following train of considerations:--  When man, long impatient at arbitrary and quite incalculable autocratic judgments, proceeded to build up a legal system to take the place of these, he built it upon the following series of axioms:--(_a_) All actions of which the courts are to take cognisance shall be classified. (_b_) The legal consequences of each class of action shall be definitely fixed. (_c_) The courts shall adjudicate only on questions of fact, and on the issue as to how the particular deed which is the cause of action should be classified. And (_d_) such decisions shall carry with them in an automatic manner the appointed legal consequences.  For example, if a man be arraigned for the appropriation of another man's goods, it is an axiom that the court (when once the questions of fact have been disposed of) shall adjudicate only on the issue as to whether the particular appropriation of goods in dispute comes under the denomination of larceny, burglary, or other co-ordinate category; and that upon this the sentence shall go forth: directing that the legal consequences which are appointed to that particular class of action be enforced.  This is the system every one can see administered in every court of justice.  There is, however, over and above what has just been set out another essential element in Justice. It is an element which readily escapes the eye.  I have in view the fact that the classifications which are adopted and embodied in the law must not be arbitrary classifications. They must all be conformable to the principle of utility, and be directed to the advantage of society.  If, for instance, burglary is placed in a class apart from larceny, it is discriminated from it because this distinction is demanded by considerations of public advantage. But considerations of utility would not countenance, and by consequence Justice would not accept, a classification of theft into theft committed by a poor man and theft committed by a rich man.  The conception of Justice is thus everywhere interfused with considerations of utility and expediency.  It will have become plain that if we have in view the justice which is administered in the courts--we may here term it _Juridical Justice_--then the question as to whether it is _just_ to refuse the suffrage to woman will be determined by considering whether the classification of men as voters and of women as non-voters is in the public interest. Put otherwise, the question whether it would be just that woman should have a vote would require the answer \"Yes\" or \"No,\" according as the question whether it would be expedient or inexpedient that woman should vote required the answer \"Yes\" or \"No.\" But it would be for the electorate, not for the woman suffragist, to decide that question.  There is, as already indicated, another principle which passes under the name of Justice. I have in view the principle that in the distribution of wealth or political power, or any other privileges which it is in the power of the State to bestow, every man should share equally with every other man, and every woman equally with every man, and that in countries where Europeans and natives live side by side, these latter should share all privileges equally with the white--the goal of endeavour being that all distinctions depending upon natural endowment, sex, and race should be effaced.  We may call this principle the _Principle of Egalitarian Equity_--first, because it aims at establishing a quite artificial equality; secondly, because it makes appeal to our ethical instincts, and claims on that ground to override the distinctions of which formal law takes account.  But let us reflect that we have here a principle which properly understood, embraces in its purview all mankind, and not mankind only but also the lower animals. That is to say, we have here a principle, which consistently followed out, would make of every man and woman _in primis [at first]_ a socialist; then a woman suffragist; then a philo-native, negrophil, and an advocate of the political rights of natives and negroes; and then, by logical compulsion ant anti-vivisectionist, who accounts it _unjust_ to experiment on an animal; a vegetarian, who accounts it _unjust_ to kill animals for food; and findly one who, like the Jains, accounts it unjust to take the life of even verminous insects.  If we accept this principle of egalitarian equity as of absolute obligation, we shall have to accept along with woman's suffrage all the other \"isms\" believed in, and agitated for, by the cranks who are so numerously represented in the ranks of woman suffragists.  If, on the other hand, we accept the doctrine of egalitarian equity with the qualification that it shall apply only so far as what it enjoins is conformable to public advantage, we shall again make expediency the criterion of the justice of woman's suffrage.  Before passing on it will be well to point out that the argument from Justice meets us not only in the form that Justice requires that woman should have a vote, but also in all sorts of other forms. We encounter it in the writings of publicists, in the formula _Taxation_ _carries with it a Right to Representation_; and we encounter it in the streets, on the banners of woman suffrage processions, in the form _Taxation without Representation is Tyranny_.

Only enough time to think. He couldn't stop thinking. Panting over a smothered spark of campfire, smoldering moss and leaves, he thought. Drinking sparkling but polluted water from a twisting mountain stream and trying unsuccessfully to trap silver shavings of fish with his naked hands, he thought.  His civilian job was that of a genopseudoxenobeastimacroiologist, a specialized field with peacetime applications that had come out of the War Games--specialized to an almost comic-opera intensity. He knew virtually everything about almost nothing at all. Yet, delirious with hunger, from this he fashioned in his mind a way to provide food for everybody. Even Jonahs.  After they caught him--weeks before the Tag spot would have faded off--he wasn't sure whether his idea had been a sick dream or not. But he intended to find out. He wouldn't let any other mob stop him from that.  Danniels had decided he was against mobs, whether their violence and stupidity was social or anti-social. People are better as individuals.  The driver of the hot-rod was also picking at his food uncertainly. Probably a social vegetarian, Danniels supposed. An irresponsible faddist.  The counterman stopped staring and cleared his throat apologetically. \"This ain't the Ritz but it don't look good for customers to sit with hats on.\"  Danniels knew that applied to only non-vegetarians, but he put his Stetson, reluctantly, on an aluminum tree.         *       *       *       *       *  The teen-ager looked up. And did not go back to the food. Danniels knew that he had been found out.  The counterman went back to wiping down the bar.  The youth was still looking at Danniels.  \"You better eat if you don't want me to be discovered,\" Danniels said gently.  Young eyes moved back and forth, searching, not finding.  \"It won't do you any good to run,\" Danniels continued. \"The waitress and the counterman will swear they had nothing to do with me. But you were driving me, eating with me.\"  \"You can't let even a Jonah die,\" the youngster said in a hoarse whisper that barely carried across the table.  Danniels shook his head sadly. \"It won't work. You might have slowed down enough to let me grab onto the rear bumper or tossed me out some food. But you took me into your car, sat down at a table with me.\"  \"And this is the thanks I get!\"  Danniels felt his face flush. \"Look, son, this isn't a game where you can afford to play by good sportsmanship. That's somebody else's rules, designed to make sure you get at least no better a break than anyone else. You have to play by your rules--designed to give _you_ the best possible break. Let's get out of here.\"  He wolfed the last bite and jammed his hat back on his head, pulling it down about his ears. The sweat band had rubbed the flour off his hair in a narrow band. A band of green. The mark of the Jonah.  In the last war games, Danniels had come into the sights of a Canadian's diffusion rifle. For six months he had worn a cancerous badge of luminosity over his heart. Until his comrades had trapped him and through a system similar to the one their rifles employed turned his hair to green and cast him out.  Danniels scooped up both checks and with deep pain paid both of them to save time. He wanted to get his companion out of there before he broke.  The heat struck at their faces like jets of boiling water. The authorities said nuclear explosion had had nothing to do with changing climatic conditions so radically, but _something_ had.  The two of them were walking towards the parked car when the Wolf Pack got to them.   II  The horrible part was that Danniels knew they wouldn't kill him. No one could kill.  But the members of the Wolf Packs wanted to. They were the professional soldiers, policemen, prizefighters and gangsters of a society that had rejected them. They were able to resist some of the pacifism of the Broadcasters. In fact, they were able to resist quite a lot.  The first one was a round-shouldered little man with silver spectacles. He kicked Danniels in the pit of the stomach with steel-shod toes. A clean-cut athletic boy grabbed the running teen-ager and ripped the red tunic halfway off. From the pavement Danniels at last isolated the doubt that had been nagging him. His companion wore a tight tee-shirt under the coat. She was a girl.  Danniels saw a heavy shoe aimed at his face but it went far afield. Running feet went past him completely.  He was left alone, unharmed, with only the breath knocked out of him momentarily.  They were closing in on the girl who had picked him up.  This Pack was all men, although there were female and co-ed groups just as vicious. Beating up a girl, Danniels knew, would give an added sexual kick to their usual masochosadism.  They were a Pack. A mob. They were like the soldiers who had hunted him down and had him permanently tagged a Jonah. His men had been looked upon favorably by his society, while the Wolf Pack was so ill-favored it was completely ignored in absolute contempt. But they were the same in the essentials: a mob.  And once again Danniels, who was incapable of harming the smallest living creature, wanted to kill men. But he couldn't.  All his life he had experienced this mad fury of desire and it shamed him. He wanted to destroy men of stupidity, greed and brutality on sight. Any other kind of conflict with them was weak compromise.  At times, he wondered if this atavistic if pro-survival trait had not shamed him so much that he over-compensated for it by violently refusing to take any kind of life. Like all men of his time, he asked himself: how much of my mind is the Broadcasters' and how much me?  If he couldn't destroy, he could defend.  With the idea still only half-formed, he lurched to his feet and stumbled into the side of the hot-rod. He fumbled open the heated metal door and slid under the wheel.  He thumbed the drive on savagely and roared down on the mob.  Rubber screamed, whined and smelled as he applied the brakes just soon enough for the men to jump out of the way--away from the girl.  He folded back the door he hadn't latched, leaned down, grabbed the teen-ager by the leg and dragged her bruised form bumping up into the car.  The little man with silver glasses tried to reach into the car.  Danniels swung the door back into his face.  The glasses didn't break; but everything else did.  With one foot under the girl and the other on her, Danniels tagged the illegal acceleration wire most cars had rigged under the dashboard and raced away into the brassy sunshine.         *       *       *       *       *  She was slouched against his shoulder when the stars blazed out in the moonless night.  Tires hummed beneath them and their headlights ate up the white-striped typewriter ribbon before them.  The girl opened her eyes, hesitated as they focused on the weave pattern of denim in his shirt, and said, \"Where are they?\"  \"Back there some place,\" Danniels told her. \"They followed in their cars, a couple on motorcycles. But they must have been scared of traffic cops on the main highway. They dropped out.\"  She sat up and ran her fingers through her cropped mouse-colored hair. Her quick glance at him was questioning; but she answered her own question and reluctantly absorbed the truth of it. She knew he knew.  The girl huddled in the tatters of her bright tunic.  \"Just what do you expect to get out of helping me?\" she asked.  Danniels kept his eyes on the road. \"A free trip to Chicago.\"  \"You'll get us both arrested!\" she shrilled. \"Nobody can get past those roadblocks.\"  He nodded to himself, not caring if she saw the gesture in the uncertain light from the auto gauges.  \"All right,\" she admitted. \"I know what Chicago is. That's no crime.\"  \"You ought to,\" Danniels said. \"You're from there.\"  She was tired. It was a moment before she could continue fighting. \"That's foolish--\"  He hadn't been sure. If she hadn't hesitated he might have given up the notion.  \"That getup was what was foolish,\" Danniels snorted. \"Anybody would know you were trying to hide something as soon as they found out the masquerade.\"  \"You wouldn't have found it out,\" she said, \"if one of that Pack hadn't torn my jacket off.\"  \"I really don't know. It might be animal magnetism, if there is such a thing. But I can't be around a woman for long without knowing it. I repeat: why?\"  \"I--I didn't know what they would do to a girl outside.\"  \"For Peace sake, why did you have to come out at all?\"  The girl was silent for a mile.  \"Most Chicagoans think the rest of the world has reverted to barbarism,\" she told him.  \"A common complaint of city dwellers,\" he observed.  \"Don't joke!\" she demanded. \"Our food is running out. We have enough to last five more years if the present birth-death cycle maintains itself.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Danniels whistled mournfully.  \"And you have--let's see--about seven more years to go.\"  She nodded.  \"I came out to see what chance there was of ending this senseless blockade.\"  \"None at all,\" he snapped. \"No one is going to risk breaking the rules of the War Games just to save a few million lives.\"  \"But they will have to! The Broadcasters will make them.\"  \"You would be surprised at how much doublethink people can practice about not killing,\" he assured her from bitter, personal experience. \"They don't _know_ for certain that you will be starving in there, so they will be free to keep you inside.\"  The girl straightened her shoulders, emphasizing the femininity of her slender form.  \"We'll tell them,\" she said. \"_I'll_ tell them.\"  Danniels almost smiled, but not quite. His hands tightened on the steering wheel and he kept his eyes to the moving circle of light against the night.  \"You open your mouth about Chicago to the authorities or anyone else and they will slap you under sedation and keep you there until you die of old age.
