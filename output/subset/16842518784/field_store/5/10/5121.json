The first to speak had remained with Steffens.  Realizing that the robot could hear every word he was saying, Ball was for a while apprehensive. But the sheer unreality of standing and talking with a multi-limbed, intelligent hunk of dead metal upon the bare rock of a dead, ancient world, the unreality of it slowly died. It was impossible not to like the things. There was something in their very lines which was pleasant and relaxing.  Their builders, Steffens thought, had probably thought of that, too.  \"There's no harm in them,\" said Ball at last, openly, not minding if the robots heard. \"They seem actually glad we're here. My God, whoever heard of a robot being glad?\"  Steffens, embarrassed, spoke quickly to the nearest mechanical: \"I hope you will forgive us our curiosity, but--yours is a remarkable race. We have never before made contact with a race like yours.\" It was said haltingly, but it was the best he could do.  The robot made a singularly human nodding motion of its head.  \"I perceive that the nature of our construction is unfamiliar to you. Your question is whether or not we are entirely 'mechanical.' I am not exactly certain as to what the word 'mechanical' is intended to convey--I would have to examine your thought more fully--but I believe that there is fundamental similarity between our structures.\"  The robot paused. Steffens had a distinct impression that it was disconcerted.  \"I must tell you,\" the thing went on, \"that we ourselves are--curious.\" It stopped suddenly, struggling with a word it could not comprehend. Steffens waited, listening with absolute interest. It said at length:  \"We know of only two types of living structure. Ours, which is largely metallic, and that of the _Makers_, which would appear to be somewhat more like yours. I am not a--doctor--and therefore cannot acquaint you with the specific details of the Makers' composition, but if you are interested I will have a doctor brought forward. It will be glad to be of assistance.\"  It was Steffens' turn to struggle, and the robot waited patiently while Ball and the second robot looked on in silence. The Makers, obviously, were whoever or whatever had built the robots, and the \"doctors,\" Steffens decided, were probably just that--doctor-robots, designed specifically to care for the apparently flesh-bodies of the Makers.  The efficiency of the things continued to amaze him, but the question he had been waiting to ask came out now with a rush:  \"Can you tell us where the Makers are?\"  Both robots stood motionless. It occurred to Steffens that he couldn't really be sure which was speaking. The voice that came to him spoke with difficulty.  \"The Makers--are not here.\"  Steffens stared in puzzlement. The robot detected his confusion and went on:  \"The Makers have gone away. They have been gone for a very long time.\"  Could that be _pain_ in its voice, Steffens wondered, and then the spectre of the ruined cities rose harsh in his mind.  War. The Makers had all been killed in that war. And these had not been killed.  He tried to grasp it, but he couldn't. There were robots here in the midst of a radiation so lethal that _nothing_, _nothing_ could live; robots on a dead planet, living in an atmosphere of carbon dioxide.  The carbon dioxide brought him up sharp.  If there had been life here once, there would have been plant life as well, and therefore oxygen. If the war had been so long ago that the free oxygen had since gone out of the atmosphere--good God, how old were the robots? Steffens looked at Ball, then at the silent robots, then out across the field to where the rest of them stood. The black wheat. Steffens felt a deep chill.  Were they immortal?         *       *       *       *       *  \"Would you like to see a doctor?\"  Steffens jumped at the familiar words, then realized to what the robot was referring.  \"No, not yet,\" he said, \"thank you.\" He swallowed hard as the robots continued waiting patiently.  \"Could you tell me,\" he said at last, \"how old you are? Individually?\"  \"By your reckoning,\" said his robot, and paused to make the calculation, \"I am forty-four years, seven months, and eighteen days of age, with ten years and approximately nine months yet to be alive.\"  Steffens tried to understand that.  \"It would perhaps simplify our conversations,\" said the robot, \"if you were to refer to me by a name, as is your custom. Using the first--letters--of my designation, my name would translate as Elb.\"  \"Glad to meet you,\" Steffens mumbled.  \"You are called 'Stef,'\" said the robot obligingly. Then it added, pointing an arm at the robot near Ball: \"The age of--Peb--is seventeen years, one month and four days. Peb has therefore remaining some thirty-eight years.\"  Steffens was trying to keep up. Then the life span was obviously about fifty-five years. But the cities, and the carbon dioxide? The robot, Elb, had said that the Makers were similar to him, and therefore oxygen and plant life would have been needed. Unless--  He remembered the buildings on Tyban IV.  Unless the Makers had not come from this planet at all.  His mind helplessly began to revolve. It was Ball who restored order.  \"Do you build yourselves?\" the exec asked.  Peb answered quickly, that faint note of happiness again apparent, as if the robot was glad for the opportunity of answering.  \"No, we do not build ourselves. We are made by the--\" another pause for a word--\"by the _Factory_.\"  \"The Factory?\"  \"Yes. It was built by the Makers. Would you care to see it?\"  Both of the Earthmen nodded dumbly.  \"Would you prefer to use your--skiff? It is quite a long way from here.\"  It was indeed a long way, even by skiff. Some of the Aliencon crew went along with them. And near the edge of the twilight zone, on the other side of the world, they saw the Factory outlined in the dim light of dusk. A huge, fantastic block, wrought of gray and cloudy metal, lay in a valley between two worn mountains. Steffens went down low, circling in the skiff, stared in awe at the size of the building. Robots moved outside the thing, little black bugs in the distance--moving around their birthplace.         *       *       *       *       *  The Earthmen remained for several weeks. During that time, Steffens was usually with Elb, talking now as often as he listened, and the Aliencon team roamed the planet freely, investigating what was certainly the strangest culture in history. There was still the mystery of those buildings on Tyban IV; that, as well as the robots' origin, would have to be cleared up before they could leave.  Surprisingly, Steffens did not think about the future. Whenever he came near a robot, he sensed such a general, comfortable air of good feeling that it warmed him, and he was so preoccupied with watching the robots that he did little thinking.  Something he had not realized at the beginning was that he was as unusual to the robots as they were to him. It came to him with a great shock that not one of the robots had ever seen a living thing. Not a bug, a worm, a leaf. They did not know what flesh was. Only the doctors knew that, and none of them could readily understand what was meant by the words \"organic matter.\" It had taken them some time to recognize that the Earthmen wore suits which were not parts of their bodies, and it was even more difficult for them to understand why the suits were needed.  But when they did understand, the robots did a surprising thing.  At first, because of the excessive radiation, none of the Earthmen could remain outside the ship for long, even in radiation suits. And one morning, when Steffens came out of the ship, it was to discover that hundreds of the robots, working through the night, had effectively decontaminated the entire area.  It was at this point that Steffens asked how many robots there were. He learned to his amazement that there were more than nine million. The great mass of them had politely remained a great distance from the ship, spread out over the planet, since they were highly radioactive.  Steffens, meanwhile, courteously allowed Elb to probe into his mind. The robot extracted all the knowledge of matter that Steffens held, pondered over the knowledge and tried to digest it, and passed it on to the other robots. Steffens, in turn, had a difficult time picturing the mind of a thing that had never known life.  He had a vague idea of the robot's history--more, perhaps, then they knew themselves--but he refrained from forming an opinion until Aliencon made its report. What fascinated him was Elb's amazing philosophy, the only outlook, really, that the robot could have had.         *       *       *       *       *  \"What do you _do_?\" Steffens asked.  Elb replied quickly, with characteristic simplicity: \"We can do very little. A certain amount of physical knowledge was imparted to us at birth by the Makers. We spend the main part of our time expanding that knowledge wherever possible. We have made some progress in the natural sciences, and some in mathematics. Our purpose in being, you see, is to serve the Makers. Any ability we can acquire will make us that much more fit to serve when the Makers return.\"  \"When they return?\" It had not occurred to Steffens until now that the robots expected the Makers to do so.  Elb regarded him out of the band of the circling eye. \"I see you had surmised that the Makers were not coming back.\"  If the robot could have laughed, Steffens thought it would have, then. But it just stood there, motionless, its tone politely emphatic.  \"It has always been our belief that the Makers would return. Why else would we have been built?\"  Steffens thought the robot would go on, but it didn't. The question, to Elb, was no question at all.  Although Steffens knew already what the robot could not possibly have known--that the Makers were gone and would never come back--he was a long time understanding.

The region had not been desert when the vaults were constructed. The War had left its mark of devastation here, Rik saw, looking in vain for a trace of the magnificent towered city that had once been just beyond this spot.  He shook off his dismay and set himself to the task for which he'd emerged.  The animals had to be alive, yet, or they were doomed. He'd always regretted the haste in their preparations that had precluded preparing survival vaults for the food animals. The best they'd been able to do, before the Day of Devastation, was herd the stupid beasts into caves and pile the entrances with loose rock, hoping the animals would dig themselves out only after the worst fury of the War had passed.... Rik threw off the bitter memory, abruptly, as his ears detected a tiny buzz of sound.  He dropped to the ground and lay still, watching to see what sort of beast would appear. It sounded larger than the animals he remembered. \"I must be near a waterhole,\" he reasoned. \"There's a pathway here, made by many animals passing this way....\" he mused, studying the narrow, flattened track that he'd spotted in the night-chilled sand.  Then he saw something coming slowly up the trail, a thing much larger than the animals he remembered.  It was a long moment before he realized what it was, and smiled. Then he reached out his hands and had it. It buzzed loudly in his grip until he pounded it to silence on a rock. By the time he'd returned to the pump chamber, he'd managed to prise it open, but its contents--mangled by the smashing upon the rock--were barely fit to eat.  \"It's better than I could have hoped,\" he said to Zina, when they and the others had picked the thing clean. \"Life promises to be much more exciting, infinitely more sporting in this new age outside the vaults. With care, we can survive until our engineers rig up some whip-rays and herding-claws again.\"  \"It _will_ be fun,\" Zina agreed, smiling with grim anticipation. \"I enjoy a challenge in the hunt. Who'd have thought the animals would have come so _far_ from the caves!\"         *       *       *       *       *  It was hours later that the bus company grew worried about their missing vehicle, and started an investigation. But they could find no trace of the bus, anywhere, and it remained a mystery until the day everybody suddenly knew what had happened.  But that was far too late."]]]
