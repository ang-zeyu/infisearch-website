Maybe it was just sunbeams dancing off the water, huh?\"  Freddy Farmer wiped a hand across his eyes, sighed and shrugged.  \"Maybe,\" he said in a puzzled voice. \"But, if so, it's the first time I ever saw sunbeams send out dots and dashes.\"  \"Dots and dashes?\" Dave echoed. \"Did you catch any of them? The letters, I mean?\"  \"Too fast,\" Freddy said with a shake of his head. \"And what little I did catch didn't mean any letters in the Morse Code. But ... maybe I was just seeing things. Sorry.\"  Dave grinned and winked, and turned front once more.  \"Think nothing of it, my little pal,\" he said. \"Even the best of us make mistakes now and....\"  Dave clamped his lips shut on the last, sat up straight in the seat and stared hard down at the water to his right and some four or five miles away. Perhaps it actually was a sunbeam dancing back up at him, but for a brief instant he was certain he had seen four or five rapid flashes of light down on the surface of the water. Another moment and he was positive beyond all shadow of a doubt. There was a light flashing down there on the water. Rather it was the reflection of the sun's rays on a heliograph mirror. However, the flashes were both long and short, and Dave didn't have to look twice to realize perfectly well that some kind of a message was being flashed from down there on the water.  \"But how, and who's doing it?\" Dave gulped out the question aloud. \"Unless I'm completely nuts, or stone blind, there's nothing but water down there. Hey, Freddy!\"  \"Yes, I see it, too,\" the English youth spoke up. \"Thought I'd let you see it for yourself this time. What do you make of it, Dave? A bit weird, isn't it?\"  \"And a lot more than that!\" Dave grunted and was uncomfortably conscious of an eerie tingling at the back of his neck. \"I don't see a darn thing else but water and that flashing light. Hey! Do you suppose it could be a sheet of metal, or something, that's being caught by the sun as it rides those swells?\"  \"It could be, but I'm sure it isn't!\" Freddy Farmer replied in a tight voice. \"Dave, those are real dot and dash signals. Three dots--two dashes, then one dot and four dashes. Neither of those are Morse Code letters. Or International Morse, either. But, I'll eat my parachute pack if those aren't some kind of signals.\"  \"Check and double check!\" Dave grunted and scowled.  On impulse he took his eyes off the strange flashing signals far below and ahead, and twisting all the way around in the seat he took a good look at the surrounding heavens. Finally, he lowered his eyes to meet Freddy Farmer's puzzled gaze.  \"Notice something else, Freddy, that seems to be a little out of whack?\" he asked.  The English born R.A.F. ace took a quick look around, and shook his head.  \"Can't say I do,\" he said. \"Unless you mean us tooting around up here for no apparent reason ... at least, not to us. Why? What do you mean?\"  Dave made a little gesture with one hand that included a sweep of the surrounding air.  \"Just that,\" he said. \"Full of nothing but sky and air. How come? How come we're the only plane that's burning gas and oil in these parts? Why isn't there a sign of any Singapore Base planes out on patrol? Particularly the U-boat patrol planes. Don't they care any more if supply ships heading for Singapore get torpedoed? In short, where is everybody?\"  \"By jove, that's right, Dave!\" Freddy Farmer breathed with a catch in his voice. \"Of course, they may have scared U-boats and surface raiders away from here for good, yet.... Yet you'd think they'd still maintain some kind of daylight patrol just in case.\"  \"Took the words right out of my mouth,\" Dawson said with a grave nod. \"Of course, it is the month of December, and maybe they've declared a truce out here until Xmas comes and goes. But it's darn queer. No planes in the air. No ships on the water. Even the Harkness is out of sight, now. Just us.\"  \"And those queer light flashes down there,\" Freddy Farmer added. \"Dave! I think we should....\"  \"Doggone right!\" Dave cut in and shoved the stick forward. \"We'll take us a better look anyway. Hang on, pal! These Swordfish jobs lose altitude in plenty hurry!\"     CHAPTER THREE  _The Voice of Doom_   Dave wasn't kidding when he said that an aerial torpedo carrying Fairey Swordfish can go down in a hurry. The plane streaked seaward like a meteor in high gear. Dave held it in its steep dive until the rolling blue swells of the China sea came rushing up a little too close for comfort. Skillfully working the controls, he leveled off and shot the plane forward toward the spot where they had first noticed the weird flashes of light.  There were no flashes of light to be seen now, however. There was nothing but sun flooded rolling water. Dave stared hard, and so did Freddy Farmer, too. But it was just a waste of eyesight for all the good it did them.  \"That makes us nuts, Freddy!\" Dave sang out. \"I don't see a thing, do you?\"  \"Not a thing!\" Freddy called to him. \"I fancy it must have been the sun's rays playing tricks on the water.\"  \"Well, some trick, is all I've got to say,\" Dave grunted and climbed the Swordfish slightly for a better look. \"The same combinations of dots and dashes were repeated over and over again.\"  \"I know,\" Freddy said. \"Like a blasted call signal on the short-wave radio. If they'd been different and jumbled up then you could put it down to sunlight bouncing off the water, but ... _Dave!_ To the left! To the left! See that spot of white water? Foam? Dave! There's something there!\"  Dave had already snapped his eyes to the left and was staring at a patch of foamy white water on the surface of the seemingly limitless stretch of rolling blue. The white foamy patch was there for a very good reason. It was the telltale wake left by a diving submarine. And even as Dave realized that he caught sight of a long cigar shaped shadow sliding forward just under the surface of the water.  \"That's a submarine, Dave!\" Freddy Farmer's excited voice confirmed Dawson's belief at practically the same instant. \"It was on the surface and signalling us, but we couldn't see anything but the flash signals.\"  \"Sure, so what?\" Dave growled and veered the Swordfish around toward the shadow of the undersea craft. \"But why signal _us_? And, also, why signal us and then dive when we start to come down? Our markings are plain enough.\"  \"Maybe it's a German U-boat!\" Freddy cried excitedly.  \"Maybe,\" Dave said with a shrug. \"But it still doesn't make sense. _Why_ was the guy signalling to us?\"  \"Maybe he wasn't signalling to us,\" Freddy Farmer ventured.  Dave snorted and made a little gesture with his free hand.  \"Then who was he signalling to?\" he demanded. \"The man in the moon above us? I took a good look, Freddy. I'll swear on a ten foot stack of bibles that we're the only plane aloft in these parts. No, that underwater boat was signalling to us, and....\"  He left the rest hanging in midair as he suddenly saw the moving shadow of the submarine grow clearer and clearer as it rose to the surface. A moment later the surface of the blue water boiled white and the conning tower mast and hatch rose up into view. Another moment and the whole bridge and decks were awash. Like a man in a dream Dave blinked his eyes at the strange sight. It was a submarine sure enough, but it was of a type he had never seen in his life. And what was even more astonishing, it was painted a dull greenish blue to make it blend in well nigh perfectly with the surrounding waters.  \"Good Lord!\" Freddy Farmer gasped. \"What is it? Nazi, or one of our new types? And look at those two bow guns, Dave. And.... Dave! Look at those seamen spill out of that opened conning tower hatch! They're coming out like blasted rabbits. Get closer to the thing. It's like something out of a fairy story book.\"  Dave Dawson only half heard his friend's exclamations, for all of his attention and his eyes were fixed on the strange craft just off and below the left wings. Just as Freddy Farmer had said, the figures of seamen were popping out of the opened conning tower hatch like rabbits out of a hat. They looked neither German nor English. They were all short and stocky, and they moved about as though operated by strings held by invisible hands.  Wide eyed, Dave stared at them; watched them pop out and go scrambling down the bridge ladder and forward toward the bow. And then things happened so fast that both Dave and Freddy were too stunned and paralyzed to even think, let alone move. The two forward guns were swung around toward them, covers were ripped off, and in the next instant the muzzle of each gun belched out smoke and flame, and the Swordfish heeled over drunkenly on the opposite wings as though it had crashed full out into an invisible brick wall suspended in the sky.  A thousand steel fists hammered against Dave's body and his brain became filled with flashing white light. As though from a million miles away he heard the wild, excited yells from Freddy Farmer's lips. He heard also the scream of the Bristol Pegasus engine over-revving. And, although he was not conscious of doing so, he reached out and cut the ignition and hauled back the throttle with a single movement of his hand.  Then, just as suddenly as the flashing white light had filled his brain, the light disappeared, and he realized that the plane was cutting crazily down sidewise toward the rolling blue swells that were now perilously close. The engine cowling looked as though it had been hit by a twenty-ton tank. The metal was hanging in gleaming ribbons. And as for the engine itself, one whole side of the powerful radial engine was just so much mangled junk.  Sight and action became one for Dave. Even as he saw what the exploding shell from the mysterious submarine's gun had done, he slammed on opposite control hard and slowly got the Swordfish back onto even keel. But shell fragments had parted a couple of the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/50668"],["title","The Secret Martians (#1)"],["body","r?\"  Baxter looked me square in the eye. \"Damned if I know!\"     2   I stared at him, nonplussed. He'd spoken with evidence of utmost candor, and the Chief of Interplanetary Security was not one to be accused of a friendly josh, but--\"You're kidding!\" I said. \"You must be. Otherwise, why was I sent for?\"  \"Believe me, I wish I knew,\" he sighed. \"You were chosen, from all the inhabitants of this planet, and all the inhabitants of the Earth Colonies, by the Brain.\"  \"You mean that International Cybernetics picked me for a mission? That's crazy, if you'll pardon me, sir.\"  Baxter shrugged, and his genial smile was a bit tightly stretched. \"When the current emergency arose and all our usual methods failed, we had to submit the problem to the Brain.\"  \"And,\" I said, beginning to be fascinated by his bewildered manner, \"what came out?\"  He looked at me for a long moment, then picked up that brochure again, and said, without referring to it, \"Jery Delvin, five foot eleven inches tall--\"  \"Yes, but read me the part where it says why I was picked,\" I said, a little exasperated.  Baxter eyed me balefully, then skimmed the brochure through the air in my direction. I caught it just short of the carpet.  \"If you can find it, I'll read it!\" he said, almost snarling.  I looked over the sheet, then turned it over and scanned the black opposite side. \"All it gives is my description, governmental status, and address!\"  \"Uh-huh,\" Baxter grunted laconically. \"It amuses you, does it?\" The smile was still on his lips, but there was a grimness in the glitter of his narrowing eyes.  \"Not really,\" I said hastily. \"It baffles me, to be frank.\"  \"If you're sitting there in that hopeful stance awaiting some sort of explanation, you may as well relax,\" Baxter said shortly. \"I have none to make. IC had none to make. Damn it all to hell!\" He brought a meaty fist down on the desktop. \"No one has an explanation! All we know is that the Brain always picks the right man.\"  I let this sink in, then asked, \"What made you ask for a man in the first place, sir? I've always understood that your own staff represented some of the finest minds--\"  \"Hold it, son. Perhaps I didn't make myself clear. We asked for no man. We asked for a solution to an important problem. And your name was what we got. You, son, are the solution.\"  Chief of Security or not, I was getting a little burned up at his highhanded treatment of my emotions. \"How nice!\" I said icily. \"Now if I only knew the problem!\"  Baxter blinked, then lost some of his scowl. \"Yes, of course;\" Baxter murmured, lighting up a cigar. He blew a plume of blue smoke toward the ceiling, then continued. \"You've heard, of course, of the Space Scouts?\"  I nodded. \"Like the old-time Boy Scouts, only with rocket-names for their various troops in place of the old animal names.\"  \"And you recall the recent government-sponsored trip they had? To Mars and back, with the broadly-smiling government picking up the enormous tab?\"  I detected a tinge of cynicism in his tone, but said nothing.  \"What a gesture!\" Baxter went on, hardly speaking directly to me at all. \"Inter-nation harmony! Good will! If these mere boys can get together and travel the voids of space, then so can everyone else! Why should there be tensions between the various nations comprising the World Government, when there's none between these fine lads, one from every civilized nation on Earth?\"  \"You sound disillusioned, sir,\" I interjected.  He stared at me as though I'd just fallen in from the ceiling or somewhere. \"Huh? Oh, yes, Delvin, isn't it? Sorry, I got carried away. Where was I?\"  \"You were telling about how this gesture, the WG sending these kids off for an extraterrestrial romp, will cement relations between those nations who have remained hostile despite the unification of all governments on Earth. Personally, I think it was a pretty good idea, myself. Everybody likes kids. Take this jam we were trying to push. Pomegranate Nectar, it was called. Well, sir, it just wouldn't sell, and then we got this red-headed kid with freckles like confetti all over his slightly bucktoothed face, and we--Sir?\"  I'd paused, because he was staring at me like a man on the brink of apoplexy. I swallowed, and tried to look relaxed.  After a moment, he found his voice. \"To go on, Delvin. Do you recall what happened to the Space Scouts last week?\"  I thought a second, then nodded. \"They've been having such a good time that the government extended their trip by--Why are you shaking your head that way, sir?\"  \"Because it's not true, Delvin,\" he said. His voice was suddenly old and tired, and very much in keeping with his snowy hair. \"You see, the Space Scouts have vanished.\"  I came up in the chair, ramrod-straight. \"Their mothers--they've been getting letters and--\"  \"Forgeries, Fakes. Counterfeits.\"  \"You mean whoever took the Scouts is falsifying--\"  \"No. _My_ men are doing the work. Handpicked crews, day and night, have been sending those letters to the trusting mothers. It's been ghastly, Delvin. Hard on the men, terribly hard. Undotted _i_'s, misuse of tenses, deliberate misspellings. They take it out of an adult, especially an adult with a mind keen enough to get him into Interplanetary Security. We've limited the shifts to four hours per man per day. Otherwise, they'd all be gibbering by now!\"  \"And your men haven't found out anything?\" I marvelled.  Baxter shook his head.  \"And you finally had to resort to the Brain, and it gave you my name, but no reason for it?\"  Baxter cupped his slightly jowled cheeks in his hands and propped his elbows on the desktop, suddenly slipping out of his high position to talk to me man-to-man. \"Look, son, an adding machine--which is a minor form of an electronic brain, and even works on the same principle--can tell you that two and two make four. But can it tell you why?  \"Well, no, but--\"  \"That, in a nutshell is our problem. We coded and fed to the Brain every shred of information at our disposal; the ages of the children, for instance, and all their physical attributes, and where they were last seen, and what they were wearing. Hell, everything! The machine took the factors, weighed them, popped them through its billions of relays and tubes, and out of the end of the answer slot popped a single sheet. The one you just saw. Your dossier.\"  \"Then I'm to be sent to Mars?\" I said, nervously.  \"That's just it,\" Baxter sighed. \"We don't even know that! We're like a savage who finds a pistol: used correctly, it's a mean little weapon; pointed the wrong way, it's a quick suicide. So, you are our weapon. Now, the question is: Which way do we point you?\"  \"You got me!\" I shrugged hopelessly.  \"However, since we have nothing else to go on but the locale from which the children vanished, my suggestion would be to send you there.\"  \"Mars, you mean,\" I said.  \"No, to the spaceship _Phobos II_. The one they were returning to Earth in when they disappeared.\"  \"They disappeared from a spaceship? While in space?\"  Baxter nodded.  \"But that's impossible,\" I said, shaking my head against this disconcerting thought.  \"Yes,\" said Baxter. \"That's what bothers me.\"     3   _Phobos II_, for obvious reasons, was berthed in a Top Security spaceport. Even so, they'd shuttled it into a hangar, safe from the eyes of even their own men, and as a final touch had hidden the ship's nameplate beneath magnetic repair-plates.  I had a metal disk--bronze and red, the Security colors--insigniaed by Baxter and counterembossed with the President's special device, a small globe surmounted by clasping hands. It gave me authority to do anything. With such an identification disc, I could go to Times Square and start machine gunning the passers-by, and not one of New York's finest would raise a hand to stop me.  And, snugly enholstered, I carried a collapser, the restricted weapon given only to Security Agents, so deadly was its molecule-disrupting beam. Baxter had spent a tremulous hour showing me how to use the weapon, and especially how to turn the beam off. I'd finally gotten the hang of it, though not before half his kidney-shaped desk had flashed into nothingness, along with a good-sized swath of carpeting and six inches of concrete floor.  His parting injunction had been. \"Be careful, Delvin, huh?\"  Yes, parting. I was on my own. After all, with a Security disc--the Amnesty, they called it--such as I possessed, and a collapser, I could go anywhere, do anything, commandeer anything I might need. All with no questions asked. Needless to say, I was feeling pretty chipper as I entered the hangar housing _Phobos II_. At the moment, I was the most influential human being in the known universe.  The pilot, as per my videophoned request, was waiting there for me. I saw him as I stepped into the cool shadows of the building from the hot yellow sunlight outside. He was tall, much taller than I, but he seemed nervous as hell. At least he was pacing back and forth amid a litter of half-smoked cigarette butts beside the gleaming tailfins of the spaceship, and a fuming butt was puckered into place in his mouth.  \"Anders?\" I said, approaching to within five feet of him before halting, to get the best psychological effect from my appearance.  He turned, saw me, and hurriedly spat the butt out onto the cement floor. \"Yes, sir!\" he said loudly, throwing me a quivering salute. His eyes were a bit wild as they took me in.  And well they might be. An Amnesty-bearer can suddenly decide a subject is not answering questions to his satisfaction and simply blast the annoying party to atoms. It makes for straight responses. Of course, I was dressing the part, in a way. I wore the Amnesty suspended by a thin golden chain from my neck, and for costume I wore a raven-black blouse and matching uniform trousers and boots. I must have looked quite sinister. I'm under six feet, but I'm angular and wiry. Thus, in ominous black, with an Amnesty on my breast and a collapser in my holster, I"]]]
