They both jumped up at once, having good manners; but Hugh's rising was calm and leisurely, while the black-eyed lad scrambled to his feet, and darted swift looks here and there, preparing for flight.  \"How do you do?\" said Hildegarde, coming forward quickly and holding out her hand. \"You are not going, are you? I think you must be one of our new neighbours, and we ought to make acquaintance, oughtn't we?\"  The boy smiled, a little quick, frightened smile, \"just the way a bird would do if it could,\" Hildegarde thought, and laid a small brown paw timidly in hers.  \"This is my Beloved!\" said Hugh, by way of introduction. \"So you can see for yourself.\"  \"And am I not to hear my neighbour's name?\" asked Hildegarde.  \"I am Will Merryweather,\" said the black-eyed boy.  \"I am very glad to see you, Will. I hope you and Hugh will be friends, for it is so nice to have friends of one's own age, and Hugh has no one. You, of course, have brothers and sisters, and that is the best of all, isn't it?\"  There was no resisting Hildegarde's smile; the young Merryweather wavered, smiled, smiled again, and in five minutes they were all seated together, and chatting away like old friends.  It appeared that Master Will was pleased with his new surroundings, but that the absence of a base-ball nine was a tragic thing, not lightly to be contemplated. The house was \"no end;\" the dwelling they had just left was entirely too small for them.  \"You see,\" he said, \"when we went to that house we weren't born at all, most of us; that is, there was only Bell and the boys. So it was big enough then, and they had rooms to themselves, and all kinds of things. But then we began to come along, and at last it got so small that the boys had to sleep in the barn, and when there was more than one visitor I had to go on the parlour sofa, and it's a beast of a sofa to sleep on,--haircloth, you know, and you slide off all night; so father thought we'd better move, and we came here.\"  \"Is Bell your eldest sister?\" asked Hildegarde, not sure how far it would be right to question this frank youth.  \"Yes, that's Bell. She's no end nice and jolly; and she's in college, you know, and we have such larks when she comes home.\"  In college! Hildegarde's hopes fell. She knew she could not get on with college girls, though she had great respect for them. Dear me! Probably Bell would be very learned, and would despise her as an \"unidead girl.\" Cruel Dr. Johnson, to originate that injurious epithet!  At this moment she heard a fresh, joyous voice calling,--  \"Will! Willy boy! W--I--Double--L, where are you?\"  \"That's Bell,\" cried Will, starting up. \"She's come after me.\"  \"Here I am, Bell!\" he shouted. \"Here's a jolly place; come along! I say, may she come along?\" he added, turning to Hildegarde with a conscience-stricken look. Hildegarde nodded eagerly, hoping that his request had not been heard. Just beyond the Ladies' Garden was a high board-fence which separated Braeside from the neighbouring place. At the top of this fence appeared two small but strong-looking hands, and following them, a girl's face, blue-eyed, rosy-cheeked and smiling.  \"You little rascal!\" cried the girl; and then she caught sight of Hildegarde. \"Oh, I beg your pardon!\" she cried, hastily. \"I didn't know,--I was looking for my brother--\"  \"Oh, please come up!\" cried Hildegarde, running to the fence. \"Please come over! Oh, you mustn't hang by your hands that way; you'll get splinters in them. You are Miss Merryweather, and I am Hildegarde Grahame; so now we are introduced, and let me help you over, do!\"  Hildegarde delivered this breathlessly, and held out both hands to help the stranger; but the latter, with a frank smile and a nod, drew herself up without more ado, perched on the top of the fence, then sprang lightly to the ground.  \"Thank you so much!\" she said, warmly, taking Hildegarde's outstretched hand. \"Of course I didn't know I was trespassing, but I'm glad I came. And oh, what a lovely place! I didn't know there was such a place out of a book. Oh, the hedges! and the brook! and the trees! How can it be real?\"  Hildegarde nodded in delight. \"Yes!\" she said. \"That is just the way I felt when I first saw the place. It was some time before I could feel it right to come here without apologizing to the ghosts.\"  \"Your ancestors' ghosts?\" said Bell Merryweather, inquiringly. \"Aren't they your own ghosts? Haven't you lived here always?\"  Hildegarde explained that the place had belonged to a cousin of her mother's, who left it to her at his death.  \"Oh!\" said Miss Merryweather; then she considered a little, with her head on one side. Hildegarde decided that, though not a beauty, the new-comer had one of the pleasantest faces she had ever seen.  \"On the whole,\" the girl went on, \"I am rather glad that my theory was wrong. The truth is less romantic, but it makes you much more real and accessible, which is, after all, desirable in a country neighbourhood.\"  \"Do tell me what you mean!\" cried Hildegarde.  Miss Merryweather laughed.  \"If you are quite sure you won't mind?\" she said, tentatively. \"Well, your place is so beautiful,--even apart from this--this--bower of nymphs,--it is so shadowed with great trees, and so green with old turf, that when I saw you this morning walking under the tree, I made up a romance about you,--a pretty little romance. You are quite sure you don't mind? You were the last of an ancient family, and you were very delicate, and your mother kept you in this lovely solitude, hoping to preserve your precious life. And now,\" she burst into a clear peal of laughter, in which Hildegarde joined heartily, \"now I see you near, and you are no more delicate than I am, and you are not the last of an ancient family. At least, I hope you are not,\" she cried, growing suddenly grave.  \"Oh! do you like to make romances?\" cried Hildegarde, with ready tact waiving the last question. \"It is my delight, too. No, I am not in the least delicate, as you say, and we have only been here two years, my mother and I; yet it seems like home, and I hope we shall always live here now. And are you beginning to feel at all settled in,--I don't know any name for your house; we have called it just the 'Yellow House' as it had no special interest, being uninhabited. But I suppose you will give it a name?\"  \"If we can decide on one!\" said Bell Merryweather, laughing. \"The trouble is, there are so many of us to decide. I want to call it Gamboge: brief, you see, and simple. But one boy says it must be Chrome Castle, and another votes for Topaz Tower; so I don't know how it will end.\"  \"When I was a little girl,\" said Hildegarde, \"I had a book, the dearest little book, called 'Pumpkin House.' It was about--\"  \"Oh, DID you have 'Pumpkin House?'\" cried Bell Merryweather, eagerly. \"Oh! wasn't it a darling? And didn't you think you never could be perfectly happy till you could live in a pumpkin? And to think of my forgetting it now, just when the opportunity has come! Of course we shall call the new home Pumpkin House!\"  \"Will the others like it?\" asked Hildegarde.  \"They'd better!\" said Bell. \"And they will, of course. It was only because we had not found the right name that we did not agree. Thank you so much, Miss Grahame! Oh, I must go now, for I have fifty thousand things to do! But,--I am so glad to have met you.\"  \"And I to know you,\" cried Hildegarde, warmly. \"I hope we shall see a great deal of each other. We shall come to call in due form, as soon as you are ready to receive visitors. But meanwhile, allow me to present you with the freedom of the fence and of the Ladies' Garden. See! our two boys are deep in confidences already.\"  In truth, the black head and the red one were laid close together, and the two round faces wore the same look of deep importance.  \"Mine are green and white,\" said Will. \"That is Austrian, but I have them Crusaders a good deal of the time.\"  \"Mine are blue,\" said Hugh, \"and sometimes they are Americans, and sometimes they are Greeks and Trojans. Will you be my friend, and shall we fight great fights together?\"  \"All right,\" said Will Merryweather, shyly.  \"We will plan a campaign,\" cried Hugh, his eyes shining with ardour.  \"Yes; but now you must come in to your music lesson,\" said Hildegarde, taking his hand, and frowning at herself for feeling another little pang, as Hugh's face turned toward his new acquaintance.  \"Read the Talisman?\" cried Will. \"I'll be Saladin, and you be Richard.\"  \"Come along, Will,\" said his sister, taking him by the shoulders and marching him toward the fence.  \"Lots of sand that will do for Palestine!\" \"Plains of Marathon over beyond the stone wall!\" \"Turbans and lances!\" \"Horsetail helmets and real armour!\"  Still shouting, Will was pitched bodily over the fence by his stalwart sister, while Hugh went away holding Hildegarde's hand, and looking backward as he passed.  \"We will fight!\" he said, giving a little leap of joy. \"Our necks shall be clothed with thunder, and we shall say, 'Ha! ha!' among the trumpets. And will you bind my wounds, Beloved?\" he added, looking up in Hildegarde's face. \"And will you give me my shield, and tell me to come back with it or upon it? Will you do that? The cover of the washboiler will do beautifully for a shield.\"  \"So it will!\" said Hildegarde; and they went into the house together.     CHAPTER III.  PUMPKIN HOUSE.   When Mrs. Grahame and Hildegarde went to call on their new neighbours, two days after the meeting in the garden, they found them already entirely at home, the house looking as if they had always lived in it. The furniture was plain, and showed marks of hard usage; but there were plenty of pictures, and the right kind of pictures, as Hildegarde said to herself, with satisfaction; and there were books,--books everywhere. In the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5263"],["title","The Girl Scout Pioneers; Or, Winning the First B. C. (#1)"],["body"," time we had at the presentation!\"  \"Now come,\" softly ordered the tall girl. \"No use prowling around here, we can't see anything with matches. I promise you, Margaret, you shall have another badge in time for the rally if we do not find this,\" and reluctantly the party of searchers turned again in the direction of the village.  Watching their opportunity, the two mill girls came out from the shadows of the high fence they had been trusting to shield them from the view of the scouts. With quickened step they now turned again towards the station.  \"Dear me!\" exclaimed Tessie. \"Haven't we had awful luck for a start? Hope it won't follow us along.\"  \"Well, the more we delay the more I want to go back home,\" Dagmar replied rather timidly. \"Tessie, I am afraid I will not be able to look at things your way. I seem to have different ideas.\"  \"Now, Daggie. Don't go getting scary. I don't care whether you think my way or not. I won't fight about it. Let's hurry,\" and with renewed protestations of real companionship, the older girl grasped the arm of the younger, as if fearful of losing her hold on the other's confidence.  \"Oh, please don't call me Daggie,\" objected Dagmar, freeing herself from the rather too securely pressed arm grasp. \"You know how I hate that. Always makes me feel like a daggar. Call me Marrie. That's American, and I am an American, you know.\"  \"All right, little Liberty. I'll call you Georgianna Washington if you say so, Marrie. That's like putting on airs for Marie. But just as you say,\" evidently willing to make any concession to have the younger girl accept her own terms.  \"Wait! My foot struck something,\" exclaimed Dagmar, just reaching the spot where burnt matches left the trail of the girl scout searchers. \"There, I found the badge.\"  \"Oh, let's look! Is it gold?\" They stopped under the street lamp to examine the trinket.  \"No, it isn't gold, I think, but isn't it pretty?\"  \"Kinda,\" urging Dagmar along. \"Say, kid, what is this anyway? A stopover we've Struck? Are we going tonight or some other night?\"  \"I'll have to give this badge back.\"  \"Why will you? Didn't you find it? Isn't it yours?\"  \"Of course not. It belongs to the girl who lost it.\"  \"Oh, I see. That's why I should call you Georgianna Washington,\" with a note of scorn in her voice. \"Well, if you want to go back, and get some one to go out ringing the town bell with you, you may find the nice little girl scout who lost her baby badge. As for me--I'm going.\"  Sheer contempt now sounded unmistakably in the voice of the girl called Tessie. She shook herself free from Dagmar, and darted ahead with determination long delayed, and consequently more forceful.  For a moment the young girl hesitated. She sort of fondled the little scout badge in her hands, and might have been heard to sigh, if a girl of her severely disciplined temperament ever indulged in anything so weakly human as a sigh.  But as the fleeing girl more surely made her tracks to the station, thus leaving the other alone in the night, Dagmar, too, quickened her steps.  \"Tessie,\" she called finally. \"Tessie, wait. I can't go back now.\"  That was all Tessie wanted. She waited, and when again they took up tangled threads of their adventure it was scarcely possible either would allow any further interruptions to delay them.  And Dagmar clutched in her tightly clasped hand the lost scout badge.     CHAPTER II  WOODLAND THRILLS   It was Margaret Slowden who lost the Badge of Merit. The pretty gilt wreath, with its clover leaf center on a dainty white ribbon hanger, had been presented to Margaret on such an auspicious occasion, that the emblem meant much more to the girl scout than its official value of rank indicated.  The True Tred Troop of Flosston had been organized one month when Margaret won the medal. Shortly after the holidays, an event of unusual importance occurred in the mill town, when its small company of service boys returned from \"Over There.\" They were royally welcomed by the entire town folks, together with the many officials of the silk industries, from whose ranks the boys had marched away.  With the lads returned was Margaret's brother Tom. He was handsome and a Marine, and well might Mrs. Slowden and Margaret take pride in the honor their soldier brought them. On the night of the Great Welcome Home, the scout girls, then newly organized, assisted with ushering and attending to the platform needs of the speakers and honored heroes, each of the latter receiving a special small, gold military cross, the gift of the silk mill magnates. This insignia was presented by the most famous authorities of army and navy available, and Tom Slowden was given the special honor of a real military presentation of the D. S. C., he being the only member of Flosston recruits to receive such a notable tribute.  As might have been expected this gave real distinction to the Welcome Home, and Margaret was suffused with pardonable pride. But when she took her place in the check room, to attend to the coats and other belongings of the distinguished visitors--she was forgotten by her troop, and she remained there all during Tom's presentation. She never heard a word of major's wonderful speech, when the people fairly roared for Tom's glory. There she was, downstairs in the dark, lonely cloak room.  \"Oh, my dear!\" deplored Captain Clark. \"I never meant that you should stay down here at this time.\"  \"But it was my task,\" returned the melancholy Margaret.  \"I would not have had you miss your brother's presentation for the world! Such a thing can never come again. Why did you not call some of the girls to relieve you?\"  \"If Tom did anything like that he could never have received the D. S. C., and I am a Scout and pledged to honor commands,\" returned Margaret nobly.  For that sacrifice she received from the same platform, one week later, her own badge of merit, and the occasion was a real rally, with officials from headquarters, and all the neighboring troops participating.  Was it strange then that Margaret should lament her loss?  No other badge could actually take the place of that one, and while Captain Clark would immediately advise headquarters of the loss, and order a new one, the brave little scout girl would still feel she had lost that one vested with the special presentation honors.  On the morning following the loss, the girls of True Tred were seen out on the road so early, the station master, old Pete, hurried to his window, and got ready for business, surmising an excursion or at least a local convention imminent.  But no such occurrence was probable, it was only the troop out looking for the badge, and inevitably they did not find it. Signs made by Captain Clark were posted in the station, the post-office, and at prominent corners, but Margaret was disconsolate. She had called her badge the \"D. S. C.\" because of its connection with Tom's insignia, and though the big brother had promised the scout sister all sorts of valuable substitutes, offering her the little hand carved box he had brought for \"another girl,\" and which Margaret had openly coveted, even this did not seem adequate compensation.  All day at school the girls of True Tred planned and contrived little favors for their unhappy sister, and it was noticeable those of the classes who usually scoffed at the scouts and their activities, could not well conceal their admiration for the spirit of kindliness displayed.  The True Treds had members in the seventh and eighth grammar grades, and the girls' ages ranged from thirteen to fifteen years. Margaret Slowden was fifteen, Cleo Harris fourteen and Grace Philow and Madaline Mower were thirteen. This group was most active in the scout girls' movement, and although the organization was only three months old in Flosston, few there were in the town who had not seen and admired the smart little troopers, in their neat uniforms, always ready to assist in the home or in public at any task consigned to them. It was to be expected they would meet opposition in the way of criticism from such girls as are always indifferent to team play, and the best interests of the largest numbers, but the scouts knew how much they enjoyed their troop, and realized how beneficial was the attractive training they were receiving from its rules and regulations.  Grace and Madaline were still in the tenderfoot class, and wore the little brooch at the neck of their blouses. Margaret and Cleo were already in the first class, and permitted to wear the left sleeve badge, while others showed their rank in the Tenderfoot, the first and third class, three patrols of eight members each making up Flosston troop.  The real work of the scouts is so interesting in character that the writer has no idea of detracting from it, by relating the detail, feeling the charm and significance is best expressed in a real story of the live girls as they live their characteristic scout life. Nevertheless, it may not be amiss to call attention here to the value of such training given almost in play, and without question in such attractive forms as to make character building through its influence an ideal pastime, a valuable investment, and a complete program, for growing girls, who may emerge from the \"bundle of habits\" as strong members of society, progressive business women, or nicely trained little helpers for the home, or for the more sheltering conditions in whatever path of life they may be selected to tread.  That schools or even homes cannot compete with such training is evident, when one considers that a girl is creative, and should have ample chance to develop her character without force or rigid self defacing, instead of self creating rules; also it must be apparent that guidance is only successful when imposed gently, and with that subtle persuasion, ever aiming to show the result of correct training, and thus affording the principles of freedom for selection, with a knowledge of what that selection will result in."]]]
