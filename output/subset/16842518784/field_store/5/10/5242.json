Whatever it was, was surely to the full as great a coward as I was, or why permit, unchecked, my burglarious entry. Since I had been allowed to enter, the probability was that I should be at liberty to retreat,--and I was sensible of a much keener desire to retreat than I had ever had to enter.  I had to put the greatest amount of pressure upon myself before I could summon up sufficient courage to enable me to even turn my head upon my shoulders,--and the moment I did so I turned it back again. What constrained me, to save my soul I could not have said,--but I was constrained. My heart was palpitating in my bosom; I could hear it beat. I was trembling so that I could scarcely stand. I was overwhelmed by a fresh flood of terror. I stared in front of me with eyes in which, had it been light, would have been seen the frenzy of unreasoning fear. My ears were strained so that I listened with an acuteness of tension which was painful.  Something moved. Slightly, with so slight a sound, that it would scarcely have been audible to other ears save mine. But I heard. I was looking in the direction from which the movement came, and, as I looked, I saw in front of me two specks of light. They had not been there a moment before, that I would swear. They were there now. They were eyes,--I told myself they were eyes. I had heard how cats’ eyes gleam in the dark, though I had never seen them, and I said to myself that these were cats’ eyes; that the thing in front of me was nothing but a cat. But I knew I lied. I knew that these were eyes, and I knew they were not cats’ eyes, but what eyes they were I did not know,--nor dared to think.  They moved,--towards me. The creature to which the eyes belonged was coming closer. So intense was my desire to fly that I would much rather have died than stood there still; yet I could not control a limb; my limbs were as if they were not mine. The eyes came on,--noiselessly. At first they were between two and three feet from the ground; but, on a sudden, there was a squelching sound, as if some yielding body had been squashed upon the floor. The eyes vanished,--to reappear, a moment afterwards, at what I judged to be a distance of some six inches from the floor. And they again came on.  So it seemed that the creature, whatever it was to which the eyes belonged, was, after all, but small. Why I did not obey the frantic longing which I had to flee from it, I cannot tell; I only know, I could not. I take it that the stress and privations which I had lately undergone, and which I was, even then, still undergoing, had much to do with my conduct at that moment, and with the part I played in all that followed. Ordinarily I believe that I have as high a spirit as the average man, and as solid a resolution; but when one has been dragged through the Valley of Humiliation, and plunged, again and again, into the Waters of Bitterness and Privation, a man can be constrained to a course of action of which, in his happier moments, he would have deemed himself incapable. I know this of my own knowledge.  Slowly the eyes came on, with a strange slowness, and as they came they moved from side to side as if their owner walked unevenly. Nothing could have exceeded the horror with which I awaited their approach,--except my incapacity to escape them. Not for an instant did my glance pass from them,--I could not have shut my eyes for all the gold the world contains!--so that as they came closer I had to look right down to what seemed to be almost the level of my feet. And, at last, they reached my feet. They never paused. On a sudden I felt something on my boot, and, with a sense of shrinking, horror, nausea, rendering me momentarily more helpless, I realised that the creature was beginning to ascend my legs, to climb my body. Even then what it was I could not tell,--it mounted me, apparently, with as much ease as if I had been horizontal instead of perpendicular. It was as though it were some gigantic spider,--a spider of the nightmares; a monstrous conception of some dreadful vision. It pressed lightly against my clothing with what might, for all the world, have been spider’s legs. There was an amazing host of them,--I felt the pressure of each separate one. They embraced me softly, stickily, as if the creature glued and unglued them, each time it moved.  Higher and higher! It had gained my loins. It was moving towards the pit of my stomach. The helplessness with which I suffered its invasion was not the least part of my agony,--it was that helplessness which we know in dreadful dreams. I understood, quite well, that if I did but give myself a hearty shake, the creature would fall off; but I had not a muscle at my command.  As the creature mounted its eyes began to play the part of two small lamps; they positively emitted rays of light. By their rays I began to perceive faint outlines of its body. It seemed larger than I had supposed. Either the body itself was slightly phosphorescent, or it was of a peculiar yellow hue. It gleamed in the darkness. What it was there was still nothing to positively show, but the impression grew upon me that it was some member of the spider family, some monstrous member, of the like of which I had never heard or read. It was heavy, so heavy indeed, that I wondered how, with so slight a pressure, it managed to retain its hold,--that it did so by the aid of some adhesive substance at the end of its legs I was sure,--I could feel it stick. Its weight increased as it ascended,--and it smelt! I had been for some time aware that it emitted an unpleasant, foetid odour; as it neared my face it became so intense as to be unbearable.  It was at my chest. I became more and more conscious of an uncomfortable wobbling motion, as if each time it breathed its body heaved. Its forelegs touched the bare skin about the base of my neck; they stuck to it,--shall I ever forget the feeling? I have it often in my dreams. While it hung on with those in front it seemed to draw its other legs up after it. It crawled up my neck, with hideous slowness, a quarter of an inch at a time, its weight compelling me to brace the muscles of my back. It reached my chin, it touched my lips,--and I stood still and bore it all, while it enveloped my face with its huge, slimy, evil-smelling body, and embraced me with its myriad legs. The horror of it made me mad. I shook myself like one stricken by the shaking ague. I shook the creature off. It squashed upon the floor. Shrieking like some lost spirit, turning, I dashed towards the window. As I went, my foot, catching in some obstacle, I fell headlong to the floor.  Picking myself up as quickly as I could I resumed my flight,--rain or no rain, oh to get out of that room! I already had my hand upon the sill, in another instant I should have been over it,--then, despite my hunger, my fatigues, let anyone have stopped me if they could!--when someone behind me struck a light.      CHAPTER III.  THE MAN IN THE BED  The illumination which instantly followed was unexpected. It startled me, causing a moment’s check, from which I was just recovering when a voice said,  ‘Keep still!’  There was a quality in the voice which I cannot describe. Not only an accent of command, but a something malicious, a something saturnine. It was a little guttural, though whether it was a man speaking I could not have positively said; but I had no doubt it was a foreigner. It was the most disagreeable voice I had ever heard, and it had on me the most disagreeable effect; for when it said, ‘Keep still!’ I kept still. It was as though there was nothing else for me to do.  ‘Turn round!’  I turned round, mechanically, like an automaton. Such passivity was worse than undignified, it was galling; I knew that well. I resented it with secret rage. But in that room, in that presence, I was invertebrate.  When I turned I found myself confronting someone who was lying in bed. At the head of the bed was a shelf. On the shelf was a small lamp which gave the most brilliant light I had ever seen. It caught me full in the eyes, having on me such a blinding effect that for some seconds I could see nothing. Throughout the whole of that strange interview I cannot affirm that I saw clearly; the dazzling glare caused dancing specks to obscure my vision. Yet, after an interval of time, I did see something; and what I did see I had rather have left unseen.    [IMAGE: images/img_017.jpg  CAPTION: FOR WHEN IT SAID, ‘KEEP STILL!’ I KEPT STILL.]   I saw someone in front of me lying in a bed. I could not at once decide if it was a man or a woman. Indeed at first I doubted if it was anything human. But, afterwards, I knew it to be a man,--for this reason, if for no other, that it was impossible such a creature could be feminine. The bedclothes were drawn up to his shoulders; only his head was visible. He lay on his left side, his head resting on his left hand; motionless, eyeing me as if he sought to read my inmost soul. And, in very truth, I believe he read it. His age I could not guess; such a look of age I had never imagined. Had he asserted that he had been living through the ages, I should have been forced to admit that, at least, he looked it. And yet I felt that it was quite within the range of possibility that he was no older than myself,--there was a vitality in his eyes which was startling. It might have been that he had been afflicted by some terrible disease, and it was that which had made him so supernaturally ugly.  There was not a hair upon his face or head, but, to make up for it, the skin, which was a saffron yellow, was an amazing mass of wrinkles. The cranium, and, indeed, the whole skull, was so small as to be disagreeably suggestive of something animal. The nose, on the other hand, was abnormally large; so extravagant were its dimensions, and so peculiar its shape, it resembled the beak of some bird of prey.

No, he didn't want to bother learning something new. He decided that the roulette wheels were either honest or too deep for him. He'd have to relax with a crap game instead.  He had been standing at the table for some time before the rest of the congregation really noticed him. Then it was with awe. The first few passes he had made were unsuccessful. Earth gravity threw him off. But when he got the rhythm of it, he tossed a row of sevens. It was a customary form of challenge on Mars. Here, though, they simply pushed chips toward him. He missed a throw, as anyone would at home: simple courtesy. The next time around, he threw for a seven just to get the feel. He got a seven. The dice had not been substituted on him.  \"I say!\" he exclaimed. He looked up into eyes and eyes, all around the green table. \"I'm sorry. I guess I don't know your rules.\"  \"You did all right, brother,\" said a middle-aged lady with an obviously surgical bodice.  \"But--I mean--when do we start actually _playing_? What happened to the cocked dice?\"         *       *       *       *       *  The lady drew herself up and jutted an indignant brow at him. \"Sir! This is a church!\"  \"Oh--I see--excuse me, I, I, I--\" Matheny backed out of the crowd, shuddering. He looked around for some place to hide his burning ears.  \"You forgot your chips, pal,\" said a voice.  \"Oh. Thanks. Thanks ever so much. I, I, that is--\" Matheny cursed his knotting tongue. _Damn it, just because they're so much more sophisticated than I, do I have to talk like a leaky boiler?_  The helpful Earthman was not tall. He was dark and chisel-faced and sleekly pomaded, dapper in blue pajamas with a red zigzag, a sleighbell cloak and curly-toed slippers.  \"You're from Mars, aren't you?\" he asked in the friendliest tone Matheny had yet heard.  \"Yes. Yes, I am. M-my name's Peter Matheny. I, I--\" He stuck out his hand to shake and chips rolled over the floor. \"Damn! Oh, excuse me, I forgot this was a church. Never mind the chips. No, please. I just want to g-g-get the hell out of here.\"  \"Good idea. How about a drink? I know a bar downshaft.\"  Matheny sighed. \"A drink is what I need the very most.\"  \"My name's Doran. Gus Doran. Call me Gus.\"  They walked back to the deaconette's booth and Matheny cashed what remained of his winnings.  \"I don't want to--I mean if you're busy tonight, Mr. Doran--\"  \"Nah. I am not doing one thing in particular. Besides, I have never met a Martian. I am very interested.\"  \"There aren't many of us on Earth,\" agreed Matheny. \"Just a small embassy staff and an occasional like me.\"  \"I should think you would do a lot of traveling here. The old mother planet and so on.\"  \"We can't afford it,\" said Matheny. \"What with gravitation and distance, such voyages are much too expensive for us to make them for pleasure. Not to mention our dollar shortage.\" As they entered the shaft, he added wistfully: \"You Earth people have that kind of money, at least in your more prosperous brackets. Why don't you send a few tourists to us?\"  \"I always wanted to,\" said Doran. \"I would like to see the what they call City of Time, and so on. As a matter of fact, I have given my girl one of those Old Martian rings last Ike's Birthday and she was just gazoo about it. A jewel dug out of the City of Time, like, made a million years ago by a, uh, extinct race ... I tell you, she _appreciated_ me for it!\" He winked and nudged.  \"Oh,\" said Matheny.         *       *       *       *       *  He felt a certain guilt. Doran was too pleasant a little man to deserve--  \"Of course,\" Matheny said ritually, \"I agree with all the archeologists it's a crime to sell such scientifically priceless artifacts, but what can we do? We must live, and the tourist trade is almost nonexistent.\"  \"Trouble with it is, I hear Mars is not so comfortable,\" said Doran. \"I mean, do not get me wrong, I don't want to insult you or anything, but people come back saying you have given the planet just barely enough air to keep a man alive. And there are no cities, just little towns and villages and ranches out in the bush. I mean you are being pioneers and making a new nation and all that, but people paying half a megabuck for their ticket expect some comfort and, uh, you know.\"  \"I do know,\" said Matheny. \"But we're poor--a handful of people trying to make a world of dust and sand and scrub thorn into fields and woods and seas. We can't do it without substantial help from Earth, equipment and supplies--which can only be paid for in Earth dollars--and we can't export enough to Earth to earn those dollars.\"  By that time, they were entering the Paul Bunyan Knotty Pine Bar & Grill, on the 73rd Level. Matheny's jaw clanked down.  \"Whassa matter?\" asked Doran. \"Ain't you ever seen a ecdysiastic technician before?\"  \"Uh, yes, but--well, not in a 3-D image under ten magnifications.\"  Matheny followed Doran past a sign announcing that this show was for purely artistic purposes, into a booth. There a soundproof curtain reduced the noise level enough so they could talk in normal voices.  \"What'll you have?\" asked Doran. \"It's on me.\"  \"Oh, I couldn't let you. I mean--\"  \"Nonsense. Welcome to Earth! Care for a thyle and vermouth?\"  Matheny shuddered. \"Good Lord, no!\"  \"Huh? But they make thyle right on Mars, don't they?\"  \"Yes. And it all goes to Earth and sells at 2000 dollars a fifth. But you don't think we'd _drink_ it, do you? I mean--well, I imagine it doesn't absolutely _ruin_ vermouth. But we don't see those Earthside commercials about how sophisticated people like it so much.\"         *       *       *       *       *  \"Well, I'll be a socialist creeper!\" Doran's face split in a grin. \"You know, all my life I've hated the stuff and never dared admit it!\" He raised a hand. \"Don't worry, I won't blabbo. But I am wondering, if you control the thyle industry and sell all those relics at fancy prices, why do you call yourselves poor?\"  \"Because we are,\" said Matheny. \"By the time the shipping costs have been paid on a bottle, and the Earth wholesaler and jobber and sales engineer and so on, down to the retailer, have taken their percentage, and the advertising agency has been paid, and about fifty separate Earth taxes--there's very little profit going back to the distillery on Mars. The same principle is what's strangling us on everything. Old Martian artifacts aren't really rare, for instance, but freight charges and the middlemen here put them out of the mass market.\"  \"Have you not got some other business?\"  \"Well, we do sell a lot of color slides, postcards, baggage labels and so on to people who like to act cosmopolitan, and I understand our travel posters are quite popular as wall decoration. But all that has to be printed on Earth, and the printer and distributor keep most of the money. We've sold some books and show tapes, of course, but only one has been really successful--_I Was a Slave Girl on Mars_.  \"Our most prominent novelist was co-opted to ghostwrite that one. Again, though, local income taxes took most of the money; authors never have been protected the way a businessman is. We do make a high percentage of profit on those little certificates you see around--you know, the title deeds to one square inch of Mars--but expressed absolutely, in dollars, it doesn't amount to much when we start shopping for bulldozers and thermonuclear power plants.\"  \"How about postage stamps?\" inquired Doran. \"Philately is a big business, I have heard.\"  \"It was our mainstay,\" admitted Matheny, \"but it's been overworked. Martian stamps are a drug on the market. What we'd like to operate is a sweepstakes, but the anti-gambling laws on Earth forbid that.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Doran whistled. \"I got to give your people credit for enterprise, anyway!\" He fingered his mustache. \"Uh, pardon me, but have you tried to, well, attract capital from Earth?\"  \"Of course,\" said Matheny bitterly. \"We offer the most liberal concessions in the Solar System. Any little mining company or transport firm or--or anybody--who wanted to come and actually invest a few dollars in Mars--why, we'd probably give him the President's daughter as security. No, the Minister of Ecology has a better-looking one. But who's interested? We haven't a thing that Earth hasn't got more of. We're only the descendants of a few scientists, a few political malcontents, oddballs who happen to prefer elbow room and a bill of liberties to the incorporated state--what could General Nucleonics hope to get from Mars?\"  \"I see. Well, what are you having to drink?\"  \"Beer,\" said Matheny without hesitation.  \"Huh? Look, pal, this is on me.\"  \"The only beer on Mars comes forty million miles, with interplanetary freight charges tacked on,\" said Matheny. \"Heineken's!\"  Doran shrugged, dialed the dispenser and fed it coins.  \"This is a real interesting talk, Pete,\" he said. \"You are being very frank with me. I like a man that is frank.\"  Matheny shrugged. \"I haven't told you anything that isn't known to every economist.\"  _Of course I haven't. I've not so much as mentioned the Red Ankh, for instance. But, in principle, I have told him the truth, told him of our need; for even the secret operations do not yield us enough._  The beer arrived. Matheny engulfed himself in it. Doran sipped at a whiskey sour and unobtrusively set another full bottle in front of the Martian.  \"Ahhh!\" said Matheny. \"Bless you, my friend.\"  \"A pleasure.\"  \"But now you must let me buy you one.\"  \"That is not necessary. After all,\" said Doran with great tact, \"with the situation as you have been describing--\"  \"Oh, we're not _that_ poor! My expense allowance assumes I will entertain quite a bit.\"  Doran's brows lifted a few minutes of arc. \"You're here on business, then?\"  \"Yes. I told you we haven't any tourists. I was sent to hire a business manager for the Martian export trade.\"  \"What's wrong"]]]
