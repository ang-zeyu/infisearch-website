II Nephi 9:7.--And if so, (not an infinite atonement) this flesh     must have laid down to rot and to crumble to its mother earth, to     rise no more.  From the Bible:      Mark 14:22-25.--And as they did eat, Jesus took bread and blessed     and brake it, and gave to them, and said: Take, eat; this is my     body.      And he took the cup, and when he had given thanks, he gave it to     them: and they all drank of it.      And he said unto them, This is my blood of the new testament which     is shed for many.      Verily I say unto you, I will drink no more of the fruit of the     vine, until that day that I drink it new in the Kingdom of God.  From the Doctrine and Covenants:      Section 45:4.--(Utah edition) Saying, Father, behold the sufferings     and death of him who did no sin, in whom thou wast well pleased;     behold the blood of thy Son which was shed--the blood of him whom     thou gavest that thyself might be glorified.      Section 74:7.--But little children are holy, being sanctified     through the atonement of Jesus Christ, and this is what the     scriptures mean.      Section 76:39-41.--For all the rest shall be brought forth by the     resurrection of the dead, through the triumph and the glory of the     Lamb, who was slain, who was in the bosom of the Father before the     worlds were made. And this is the gospel, the glad tidings which     the voice out of the heavens bore record unto us. That he came into     the world, even Jesus, to be crucified for the world, and to bear     the sins of the world, and to sanctify the world, and to cleanse it     from all unrighteousness.      Section 29:1.--Listen to the voice of Jesus Christ, your Redeemer,     the Great I AM, whose arm of mercy hath atoned for your sins. Verse     17.--And it shall come to pass, because of the wickedness of the     world, that I will take vengeance upon the wicked, for they will     not repent; for the cup of mine indignation is full; for behold, my     blood shall not cleanse them if they hear me not.   STATEMENT OF AN ENEMY  But the report says: \"This doctrine was introduced by Brigham Young\" and that it meant \"death to anyone who left the Church * * * that the apostate whose throat was cut from ear to ear * * * saved his soul.\" Why you made this statement you best know; but were you not aware that it was but the repetition of the ravings of enemies of the Church, without one grain of truth? Did you not know that not a single individual was ever \"blood atoned,\" as you are pleased to call it, for apostasy or any other cause? Were you not aware, in repeating this false charge, that it was made by the most bitter enemies of the Church before the death of the Prophet Joseph Smith? Do you know of anyone whose blood was ever shed by the command of the Church, or members thereof, to \"save his soul?\" Did you not know that you were embittering the people against the \"Mormon\" Elders, and that just such malicious charges and false insinuations have made martyrs for the Church, whose blood does not \"cease to come up into the ears of the Lord of Sabaoth?\"  Never in the history of this people can the time be pointed to when the Church ever attempted to pass judgment on, or execute an apostate as per your statement. There are men living in Utah today who left the Church in the earliest history of our State who feel as secure, and are just as secure and free from molestation from their former associates as you or any other man could be.   EFFICACY OF THE BLOOD OF CHRIST  The Latter-day Saints believe in the efficacy of the blood of Christ. They believe that through obedience to the laws and ordinances of the Gospel they obtain a remission of sins; but this could not be if Christ had not died for _them_. If you did believe in blood atonement, I might ask you why the blood of Christ was shed? and _in whose stead was it shed_? I might ask you to explain the words of Paul: \"Without shedding of blood is no remission.\"   UNPARDONABLE SINS  Are you aware that there are certain sins that man may commit for which the atoning blood of Christ does not avail? Do you not know, too, that this doctrine is taught in the Book of Mormon? And is not this further reason why you should discard the Book as well as the name? Is it not safe for us to rely upon the scriptures for the solution of problems of this kind? Let me quote:  From the Book of Mormon:      II Nephi 9:35.--Wo unto the murderer who deliberately killeth, for     he shall die.      Alma 1:13, 14.--And thou hast shed the blood of a righteous man,     yea, a man who has done much good among this people; and were we to     spare thee, his blood would come upon us for vengeance.      Alma 42:19.--Now, if there were no law given--if a man murdered he     should die, would he be afraid he would die if he should murder?  From the Bible:      Genesis 9:12, 13.--And whoso sheddeth man's blood, by man shall his     blood be shed; for man shall not shed the blood of man.      For a commandment I give, that every man's brother shall preserve     the life of man, for in mine own image have I made man. (Inspired     translation.)      Luke 11:50.--That the blood of all the prophets, which was     shed from the foundation of the world, may be required of this     generation.      Hebrews 9:22.--And almost all things are by the law purged with     blood; and without shedding of blood is no remission.      Hebrews 10:26-29.--For if we sin wilfully, after that we have     received the knowledge of the truth, there remaineth no more     sacrifice for sins.      * * * *      He that despised Moses' law died without mercy under two or three     witnesses;      Of how much sorer punishment, suppose ye, shall he be thought     worthy, who hath trodden under foot the Son of God, and hath     counted the blood of the covenant, wherewith he was sanctified, an     unholy thing.      (I commend to you the careful reading of these two chapters:)      I John 3:15.--No murderer hath eternal life abiding in him.      I John 5:16.--If any man see his brother sin a sin which is not     unto death, he shall ask, and he shall give him life for them that     sin not unto death. There is a sin unto death: I do not say that he     shall pray for it.  From the Doctrine and Covenants:      Section 87:7.--That the cry of the saints, and of the blood of     the saints, shall cease to come up into the ears of the Lord of     Sabbath, from the earth, to be avenged of their enemies.      Section 101:80.--And for this purpose have I established the     constitution of this land, by the hands of wise men, whom I raised     up unto this very purpose, and redeemed the land by the shedding of     blood.      Section 42:18, 19.--And now, behold, I speak unto the church. Thou     shalt not kill; and he that kills shall not have forgiveness in     this world, nor in the world to come.      And again, I say, thou shalt not kill; but he that killeth shall     die.      Verse 79.--And it shall come to pass, that if any persons among you     shall kill, they shall be delivered up and dealt with according to     the laws of the land; for remember that he hath no forgiveness, and     it shall be proved according to the laws of the land.   THE LAW OF CAPITAL PUNISHMENT  In pursuance of, and in harmony with this scriptural doctrine, which has been the righteous law from the days of Adam to the present time, the founders of Utah incorporated in the laws of the Territory provisions for the capital punishment of those who wilfully shed the blood of their fellow man. This law, which is now the law of the State, granted unto the condemned murderer the privilege of choosing for himself whether he die by hanging, or whether he be shot, and thus have his blood shed in harmony with the law of God; and thus atone, so far as it is in his power to atone, for the death of his victim. Almost without exception the condemned party chooses the latter death. This is by the authority of the law of the land, not that of the Church. This law was placed on the statutes through the efforts of the \"Mormon\" legislators, and grants to the accused the right of jury trial. It is from this that the vile charge, which you are pleased to repeat, has been maliciously misconstrued by the enemies of the Church, who prefer to believe a lie. When men accuse the Church of practicing \"blood atonement\" on those who deny the faith, or, for that matter, on any living creature, they know that they bear false witness, and they shall stand condemned before the judgment seat of God.   PLURAL MARRIAGE  Since the action taken by the United States government, and also by the Church, in regard to plural marriage, I shall not discuss its virtues nor answer arguments in opposition to that principle as a principle of our faith. As you, however, are reported to have said that \"Brigham Young introduced\" that doctrine \"in Salt Lake City,\" I would be pleased if you would explain, as a matter of history, why Sidney Rigdon, before \"President Young introduced\" the doctrine, declared that the principle of plural marriage was introduced, to his knowledge, by Joseph Smith the Prophet, and that he, Sidney Rigdon, rejected that doctrine and \"warned Joseph Smith and his family\" that it would bring ruin upon them. You will find this in the _Messenger and Advocate_, published in June, 1846, volume 2, page 475, number 6. Will you kindly explain why this same Sidney Rigdon practiced polygamy, which he so fervently condemns? Will you kindly explain why Lyman Wight, James J. Strang, Gladden Bishop, William Smith, and others, none of whom had much love for President Young and did not follow him, also taught and practiced polygamy _before plural marriage was \"introduced by President Young_.\" If you doubt this, I will gladly furnish you with the proof. Indeed, you may find a great deal of it in the third volume of your church history.

The same ladder that Adam climbed, until beyond the reach of the fatal consequences of his transgression, the whole human race, inheriting from him the effects of the fall, must likewise climb, or they will never see the face of God in eternal glory.  The Paramount Purpose.--Let us keep in mind, however, that the gospel, even in a limited sense, is more than a means of escape from impending ills. It is the way of progress, the path to perfection, and as such was devised by the wisdom of the Gods, before this world rolled into existence. The origin of the gospel, and the grand purpose for which it was instituted, are briefly yet clearly outlined by the Prophet Joseph Smith in the following language:  Eternal Progression.--\"The first principles of man are self-existent with God. God himself, finding he was in the midst of spirits and glory, because he was more intelligent, saw proper to institute laws whereby the rest could have a privilege to advance like himself. The relationship we have with God places us in a situation to advance in knowledge. He has power to institute laws to instruct the weaker intelligences, that they may be exalted with himself, so that they may have one glory upon another.\"--(\"Times and Seasons,\" August 15, 1844; \"Improvement Era,\" January, 1909.)  Power and Benevolence of Deity.--Here are pointed out both the power and the benevolence of Deity. Our Father in heaven is no monopolist. While omnipotent and all-possessing, he is likewise altruistic and philanthropic. Instead of keeping to himself the glory that he found himself possessed of, he used his superior intelligence \"to institute laws\" whereby the lesser spirits surrounding him might advance toward the lofty plane that he occupies. He proposed to lift them to his own spiritual stature and share with them the empire of the universe.  Plato's View.--Our prophet's simple yet sublime setting forth of the divine power and benevolence, as exemplified in the establishment of a plan for man's eternal progress, is far more pointed and specific than the presentment made by Plato, the Greek philosopher, of a doctrine somewhat similar. Plato, as quoted by Emerson, says: \"Let us declare the cause which led the Supreme Ordainer to produce and compose the universe. He was good; and he who is good has no kind of envy. Exempt from envy, he wished that all things should be as much as possible like himself. Whosoever, taught by wise men, shall admit this as the prime cause of the origin and foundation of the world, will be in the truth.\"--(\"Representative Men,\" Lecture II.)  Man's Destiny.--There is a fitness, a propriety, in man's becoming like his Maker--God's child, fashioned in his image and endowed with divine attributes, developing to the fulness of the parental stature, as taught by Joseph; but how the same can be predicated of \"all things\"--beasts, fish, fowl, trees, plants, etc., as Plato implies, is not so clear. That the lower animals, as well as man, in fact all forms of life, animate and inanimate, are to be perpetuated and glorified, is a plain inference from the teachings of the prophet (D&C 77:2-4) but undoubtedly all will retain their identity, in their respective orders and spheres. No creature of God's, except man, is destined to become like God, in the fullest and highest sense. \"As much as possible\" is a saving clause, however, and Plato, therefore, is not committed to any contradictory proposition.    CHAPTER II.  Eternal Nature of Gospel Principles.  Gospel Code and Fundamentals.--The gospel, as a code or System of laws and ordinances, is a creation, a work of God; but like all other creations it was organized out of materials already existing. \"Intelligence or the light of truth was not created or made, neither indeed can be\" (D&C 93:29). Truth, \"eternal, unchanged, evermore\"--such is the gospel in its fundamental principles. These were never created. God did not make them; he \"instituted\" them, recognizing their worth, their utility, their adaptability to the purposes which he had in view. He saw that these principles were ennobling and exalting in their nature and tendency, and he therefore created a plan embodying them as the most effectual means for man's promotion.  Faith.--Take, for instance, faith--the first principle. Can you conceive of its creation as a principle? I cannot: but I can grasp the idea of its existence as a law, as an essential force, its adoption by divine wisdom, and its adaptation to the purposes of Deity. I can conceive of its bestowal upon man as an endowment from God, its assimilation, cultivation, growth and increase, as illustrated in the Book of Mormon, where it is compared to a seed germinating in the soul (Alma 32:28). But I cannot think of it, in its essential, fundamental nature, as having been called into existence. Faith is a gift from God, both as a law and a manifestation of spiritual power: but it is not a creation--not as a basic principle. The gospel code containing this law, however, may readily be conceived as the work of a divine Creator and Law-giver.  Repentance.--What is true of faith in this respect, is true also of repentance. God did not create repentance as a principle; it already existed as an essential to progress; but he made it obligatory upon sinful man, if he would be saved and put upon the road to perfection, to practice this principle--to turn away from evil and \"sin no more.\"  Baptism.--As for baptism, the idea of washing in order to be come clean is plain enough for a child's comprehension. It is this idea that underlies the baptismal ordinance. God did not create the fact that washing maketh clean--that is fundamental; but he instituted baptism for the remission of sins and made it a part of the gospel plan, because no unclean thing can enter into the kingdom of heaven.  Holy Ghost.--Divine Wisdom did not create the Holy Ghost: he is eternal, without beginning or end--he is God. Nor did it decree light necessary to illumination; that is a self-evident, self-existent truth. But Divine Wisdom instituted the laying on of hands for the gift (giving) of the Holy Ghost, and included it in the great progressive plan, because, without the illumination that comes from the Spirit of the Lord, man cannot be \"led into all truth.\"  Thus we might go on, taking up other features of the gospel, and in each one pointing out some underlying principle upon which this law or that ordinance has been based. The same philosophy will apply to them all. These fundamental principles are not creations--they are eternal truths, applied or adapted to ends foreseen and predestined by the all-wise Ordainer and Giver.  The gospel was instituted for the advancement of God's children, who had probably progressed as far as they could in the spirit at that time, before they were given bodies; and it was made effective for their further progress by the Atonement of Christ, offsetting the fall of Adam, and nullifying the deadly effects of the original transgression.  The Fall.--Right here let me suggest that Adam's transgression, while technically a sin, because of the broken law, should be stressed as the means whereby those spirits obtained their bodies, rather than as an act of moral turpitude. In law, crimes are of two general classes--malum per se and malum prohibitum. Malum per se means \"an evil in itself\"--an act essentially wrong; while malum prohibitum signifies \"that which is wrong because forbidden by law.\" Adam's transgression was malum prohibitum, and the consequent descent from an immortal to a mortal condition was \"THE FALL.\"  A Prearranged Plan.--It is evident from the revelations of God, particularly in modern times, that everything connected with man's mortal pilgrimage was understood and arranged before that pilgrimage began. Not alone was the gospel instituted: an executor was appointed to put it into effect. In other words, the machinery was constructed, and the power then turned on. The fall being foreseen, the redemption was ordained. Eternal progress and everlasting glory were the objects in view, and over the glad prospect, in spite of the pain and sorrow that must necessarily intervene, \"the Morning Stars sang together, and all the Sons of God shouted for joy\" (Job 38:7).    CHAPTER III.  The Fall and Redemption.  Essentials to Progress.--The story of God embraces the fall as well as the redemption of man. Both these mighty vicissitudes are steps in the march of human progress. The fall was just as necessary as the redemption, in order to make operative and effective the laws and ordinances of the gospel. In other words, the fall prepared the way for the redemption. How could redemption have been, had there been nothing to redeem? Of what use were a gospel of salvation where nothing needed to be saved?  Innocent Ignorance.--Had the spirits of men, \"all innocent in the beginning,\" remained where they were and just as they were, they would have had no need to exercise faith unto salvation. They would have had no need to repent or to be baptized, having no evil practices to turn away from, and no uncleanness to be washed away. But they would have remained ignorant as well as innocent, and without any further progression. The following passage from the Book of Mormon illustrates this point:  \"And now, behold, if Adam had not transgressed, he would not have fallen; but he would have remained in the Garden of Eden. And all things which were created must have remained in the same state which they were after they were created; and they must have remained forever and had no end. And they would have had no children; wherefore, they would have remained in a state of innocence, having no joy, for they knew no misery; doing no good, for they knew no sin. But behold, all things have been done in the wisdom of him who knoweth all things. Adam fell that men might be; and men are, that they might have"]]]
