The eldest, Jacky, about twelve years old, is a very lively boy, and often entertains me in the most pleasing manner by relating to me his different employments at school, and afterwards desiring me in my turn to relate to him all manner of things about Germany.  He repeats his _amo_, _amas_, _amavi_, in the same singing tone as our common school-boys.  As I happened once when he was by, to hum a lively tune, he stared at me with surprise, and then reminded me it was Sunday; and so, that I might not forfeit his good opinion by any appearance of levity, I gave him to understand that, in the hurry of my journey, I had forgotten the day.  He has already shown me St. James’s Park, which is not far from hence; and now let me give you some description of the renowned                             _St. James’s Park_.  The park is nothing more than a semicircle, formed of an alley of trees, which enclose a large green area in the middle of which is a marshy pond.  The cows feed on this green turf, and their milk is sold here on the spot, quite new.  In all the alleys or walks there are benches, where you may rest yourself.  When you come through the Horse Guards (which is provided with several passages) into the park, on the right hand is St. James’s Palace, or the king’s place of residence, one of the meanest public buildings in London.  At the lower end, quite at the extremity, is the queen’s palace, a handsome and modern building, but very much resembling a private house. As for the rest, there are generally everywhere about St. James’s Park very good houses, which is a great addition to it.  There is also before the semicircle of the trees just mentioned a large vacant space, where the soldiers are exercised.  How little this famous park is to be compared with our park at Berlin, I need not mention.  And yet one cannot but form a high idea of St. James’s Park and other public places in London; this arises, perhaps, from their having been oftener mentioned in romances and other books than ours have. Even the squares and streets of London are more noted and better known than many of our principal towns.  But what again greatly compensates for the mediocrity of this park, is the astonishing number of people who, towards evening in fine weather, resort here; our finest walks are never so full even in the midst of summer.  The exquisite pleasure of mixing freely with such a concourse of people, who are for the most part well-dressed and handsome, I have experienced this evening for the first time.  Before I went to the park I took another walk with my little Jacky, which did not cost me much fatigue and yet was most uncommonly interesting.  I went down the little street in which I live, to the Thames nearly at the end of it, towards the left, a few steps led me to a singularly pretty terrace, planted with trees, on the very brink of the river.  Here I had the most delightful prospect you can possibly imagine.  Before me was the Thames with all its windings, and the stately arches of its bridges; Westminster with its venerable abbey to the right, to the left again London, with St. Paul’s, seemed to wind all along the windings of the Thames, and on the other side of the water lay Southwark, which is now also considered as part of London.  Thus, from this single spot, I could nearly at one view see the whole city, at least that side of it towards the Thames.  Not far from hence, in this charming quarter of the town, lived the renowned Garrick.  Depend upon it I shall often visit this delightful walk during my stay in London.  To-day my two Englishmen carried me to a neighbouring tavern, or rather an eating-house, where we paid a shilling each for some roast meat and a salad, giving at the same time nearly half as much to the waiter, and yet this is reckoned a cheap house, and a cheap style of living.  But I believe, for the future, I shall pretty often dine at home; I have already begun this evening with my supper.  I am now sitting by the fire in my own room in London.  The day is nearly at an end, the first I have spent in England, and I hardly know whether I ought to call it only one day, when I reflect what a quick and varied succession of new and striking ideas have, in so short a time, passed in my mind.     CHAPTER III.                                                      _London_, 5_th_ _June_.  AT length, dearest Gedike, I am again settled, as I have now got my trunk and all my things from the ship, which arrived only yesterday.  Not wishing to have it taken to the Custom House, which occasions a great deal of trouble, I was obliged to give a douceur to the officers, and those who came on board the ship to search it.  Having pacified, as I thought, one of them with a couple of shillings, another came forward and protested against the delivery of the trunk upon trust till I had given him as much.  To him succeeded a third, so that it cost me six shillings, which I willingly paid, because it would have cost me still more at the Custom House.  By the side of the Thames were several porters, one of whom took my huge heavy trunk on his shoulders with astonishing ease, and carried it till I met a hackney coach.  This I hired for two shillings, immediately put the trunk into it, accompanying it myself without paying anything extra for my own seat.  This is a great advantage in the English hackney coaches, that you are allowed to take with you whatever you please, for you thus save at least one half of what you must pay to a porter, and besides go with it yourself, and are better accommodated.  The observations and the expressions of the common people here have often struck me as peculiar. They are generally laconic, but always much in earnest and significant. When I came home, my landlady kindly recommended it to the coachman not to ask more than was just, as I was a foreigner; to which he answered, “Nay, if he were not a foreigner I should not overcharge him.”  My letters of recommendation to a merchant here, which I could not bring with me on account of my hasty departure from Hamburgh, are also arrived. These have saved me a great deal of trouble in the changing of my money. I can now take my German money back to Germany, and when I return thither myself, refund to the correspondent of the merchant here the sum which he here pays me in English money.  I should otherwise have been obliged to sell my Prussian Fredericks-d’or for what they weighed; for some few Dutch dollars which I was obliged to part with before I got this credit they only gave me eight shillings.  A foreigner has here nothing to fear from being pressed as a sailor, unless, indeed, he should be found at any suspicious place.  A singular invention for this purpose of pressing is a ship, which is placed on land not far from the Tower, on Tower Hill, furnished with masts and all the appurtenances of a ship.  The persons attending this ship promise simple country people, who happen to be standing and staring at it, to show it to them for a trifle, and as soon as they are in, they are secured as in a trap, and according to circumstances made sailors of or let go again.  The footway, paved with large stones on both sides of the street, appears to a foreigner exceedingly convenient and pleasant, as one may there walk in perfect safety, in no more danger from the prodigious crowd of carts and coaches, than if one was in one’s own room, for no wheel dares come a finger’s breadth upon the curb stone.  However, politeness requires you to let a lady, or any one to whom you wish to show respect, pass, not, as we do, always to the right, but on the side next the houses or the wall, whether that happens to be on the right or on the left, being deemed the safest and most convenient.  You seldom see a person of any understanding or common sense walk in the middle of the streets in London, excepting when they cross over, which at Charing Cross and other places, where several streets meet, is sometimes really dangerous.  It has a strange appearance—especially in the Strand, where there is a constant succession of shop after shop, and where, not unfrequently, people of different trades inhabit the same house—to see their doors or the tops of their windows, or boards expressly for the purpose, all written over from top to bottom with large painted letters.  Every person, of every trade or occupation, who owns ever so small a portion of a house, makes a parade with a sign at his door; and there is hardly a cobbler whose name and profession may not be read in large golden characters by every one that passes.  It is here not at all uncommon to see on doors in one continued succession, “Children educated here,” “Shoes mended here,” “Foreign spirituous liquors sold here,” and “Funerals furnished here;” of all these inscriptions.  I am sorry to observe that “Dealer in foreign spirituous liquors” is by far the most frequent.  And indeed it is allowed by the English themselves, that the propensity of the common people to the drinking of brandy or gin is carried to a great excess; and I own it struck me as a peculiar phraseology, when, to tell you that a person is intoxicated or drunk, you hear them say, as they generally do, that he is in liquor.  In the late riots, which even yet are hardly quite subsided, and which are still the general topic of conversation, more people have been found dead near empty brandy-casks in the streets, than were killed by the musket-balls of regiments that were called in.  As much as I have seen of London within these two days, there are on the whole I think not very many fine streets and very fine houses, but I met everywhere a far greater number and handsomer people than one commonly meets in Berlin.  It gives me much real pleasure when I walk from Charing Cross up the Strand, past St. Paul’s to the Royal"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5255"],["title","The Book of Good Manners; a Guide to Polite Usage for All Social Functions (#1)"],["body","a visiting-card, to reach the hostess during        the ceremony.         When the invitation has been issued in the        name of the hostess only, a husband and wife        each send a card, and if in the name of hostess        and her daughter, each should send two        cards. If the invitation has been issued in        the name of the husband and wife, the wife        should send one and a husband two cards.         If the woman in the family is the only one        present at the function, she can leave cards        for the rest of the family.    MEN. Both the host and men wear the regulation        afternoon dress, consisting of the long        frock coat with single or double-breasted        waistcoat to match, or of some fancy cloth,        and gray trousers. White linen, a light tie,        a silk hat, gray gloves, and patent leather        shoes complete the costume.         The overcoat, hat, and cane are left in        the dressing-room, and the guest removes one        or both gloves as he pleases--remembering        that he must offer his ungloved right hand        to the hostess.    SHAKING HANDS. Guests on being presented to        the hostess should shake hands. If guest        takes leave of hostess, they should shake        hands. If the hostess is surrounded by        guests, a pleasant nod of farewell is admissible.    WOMEN. Women leave cards of their male relatives        as well as their own, even though their        names may be announced upon entering.        Guests leave their cards in a receptacle provided        for the purpose, or give them to the        servant at the door.         Women wear a costume appropriate for        the afternoon, and keep their hats and        gloves on.    AFTERNOON TEAS (INFORMAL). An afternoon tea is a        simple entertainment. Refreshments are        generally served to the guests. An innovation        lately introduced has become quite popular        --namely, young women, invited for        the purpose, wait upon the guests, bringing        in one dainty at a time.         An afternoon tea is called a formal afternoon        tea when engraved cards have been        issued, naming set date.    CARDS. Guests should leave cards in the hall, or        hand them to the servant. Women may        leave the cards of the men of her family.        Those unable to attend should send card the        same afternoon by mail or messenger.           See also AFTERNOON TEAS (Formal)-Cards.    DRESS. Both men and women wear afternoon dress.    GUESTS. All guests, both men and women, wear        afternoon dress.         Guests may suit their convenience in arriving        or departing--provided they do not        come at the opening hour, nor stay to the        last moment.         After the guests have left their wraps in        the dressing-rooms, they leave their cards in        the tray in the hall and enter the drawing-        room, the women preceding the men.         After greeting the hostess and being introduced        to those assisting her, the guests quietly move        away and mingle with the rest.         Each guest goes to the dining-room when        he pleases and leaves when he wishes. It is        not necessary upon departure to shake hands        with the hostess at a large reception, though        it is better to do so at a small affair.         It is not necessary for a guest to stay the        entire evening; twenty minutes is sufficient.    HOST. If present, he does not receive with his        wife. It is not essential that he be present        on such an occasion.    HOSTESS. The hostess wears full dress. Daughters        may assist, or young women may be asked to do so.    HOURS. From four to seven.    INVITATIONS. For an afternoon tea a visiting-        card may be used with the hour and date        written or engraved on it. They may be sent        by mail or messenger.         The invitation need not be acknowledged.    AFTERNOON WEDDING RECEPTIONS are conducted the        same as Wedding Receptions, which see.

AT HOMES.    AFTERNOON AT HOMES. The days for receiving        are engraved in the lower left hand        corner of the card, with hours specified if one        wishes.         No changes should be made in these hours        by the hostess unless for exceptional reasons,        and she should always be present at the        time set.         Unless very intimate, the call should be        made only on the specified days.    BACHELORS. It is not customary for a bachelor        to use \"At Home\" cards as a woman does,        nor to invite his friends by writing a date        and Music at four on his calling-cards in        place of an invitation.    DRESS. In the afternoon the caller should wear        afternoon dress, and in the evening evening        dress.    ACKNOWLEDGING INVITATIONS. Invitations to        an ordinary at home need no acknowledgment.    INVITATIONS. Cards for an \"At Home\" are engraved        with the hour for beginning the        entertainment--as, Chocolate at 4.30 o'clock.        The invitations to a formal \"At Home\"        should be sent in two envelopes, but to an        ordinary \"At Home\" in one envelope. For        informal affairs the hour may be written on        an ordinary \"At Home\" card.    BACHELORS' DINNERS. They follow the usual custom        of formal dinners, and may be as elaborate as        desired. Women may be invited. Such        dinners are often given for men only.    CALLS. Women do not call upon a bachelor        after attending a dinner given by him.    CHAPERONE. If women are present, a married        woman as chaperone is indispensable, and        her husband must also be invited. The host        should call upon the chaperone and personally        request the favor.         The chaperone is taken into dinner by the        host, unless the latter takes in the woman in        whose honor the dinner may be given. In        the latter case, the chaperone is seated at the        host's left. She gives the signal for the        women to leave the dining-room.         All guests should be introduced to the        chaperone, and she should be called upon        after a short time by the host.    DRESS. All guests wear evening dress.    HOST. The host should call upon the chaperone        within a few days after the dinner.         If men only are present, he either precedes        or follows the guests into the dining-room,        and if he has given the dinner in honor of        some man, he has the latter seated at his        right. His duties are the same as the host        at dinners.    INVITATIONS. These are usually given in brief        notes, but may be engraved, and are similar        to the regular invitations to dinners, and are        treated accordingly.    MEN. The men wear evening dress, and follow        the same etiquette as at other dinners.    WOMEN. The women wear evening dress, and        follow the same etiquette as at all dinners,        except that no calls are made by them afterward        upon the host.    BACHELOR'S FAREWELL DINNER.
