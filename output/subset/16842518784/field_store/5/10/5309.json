My answer is that in the revelation on Church government in the Doctrine and Covenants (sec. xx), the following in respect to the rise of the Church is given: \"The rise of the Church of Christ in these last days, _being one thousand eight hundred and thirty years since the coming of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ in the flesh_, it being regularly organized and established agreeable to the laws of our country, by the will and commandments of God, in the fourth month, and on the sixth day of the month, which is called April.\"  I believe that this--better than any other authority, fixes the time of the birth, or the \"coming of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ in the flesh;\" and that, as to the year at least, agrees with the Dionysian computation. It must be remembered that this revelation in section twenty of the Doctrine and Covenants was given before the Church was organized--at sundry times between the first and the sixth of April--and that the prophet was instructed to organize the Church on the sixth day of April, 1830, hence it was not mere chance that determined the day on which that organization took place, (History Joseph Smith, \"Millennial Star Supplement\" to vol. xiv, p. 22) a fact that is significant in view of the above considerations and those which follow in note 2.--Roberts.  2. The Day of Messiah's Birth.--Strictly speaking, if this Church was organized \"one thousand eight hundred and thirty years since the coming of our Lord and Savior in the flesh,\" then the sixth of April must have been the anniversary of the Savior's birthday. If the organization of the Church had been before or subsequent to that date, if only by one or any number of days, the great event would have been more or less than one thousand eight hundred and thirty years by just so many days. [This argument also holds good as to the year of Christ's birth.] Options formed by the study of chronological events may or may not be accurate. But we would scarcely think the Lord would make any mistake about dates. Least of all he who was born on that day, and on that day thirty-three years later was crucified.--Joseph F. Smith.  Let us inquire if the day observed by the Christian world as the {17} day of His [Christ's] birth--the 25th of December--is or is not the real Christmas day. A great many authors have found out from their researches, that it is not. I think that there is scarcely an author at the present day that believes that the twenty-fifth of December was the day that Christ was born on * * * It is generally believed and conceded by the learned who have investigated the matter, that Christ was born in April. * * * It is stated that according to the best of their [the learned] judgment from the researches they have made, Christ was crucified on the sixth of April. That is the day on which this Church was organized. But when these learned men go back from the day of his crucifixion to the day of his birth, they are at a loss, having no certain evidence or testimony by which they can determine it.--Orson Pratt.  In support of Elder Pratt's contention relative to the uncertainty of Christian scholars as to the day on which Jesus was born, I quote the statement of Rev. Charles F. Deem, author of \"The Light of the Nation,\" and president of the American Institute of Christian Philosophy. \"It is annoying to see learned men use the same apparatus of calculation and reach the most diverse results.\" In a foot note at page 32, in \"Light of the Nation,\" he refers to fifteen different authors all of whom are writers of note, who give different years for the birth of Christ varying from B. C. 1 to B. C. 7  3. Humble Nativity of Messiah.--In the rude limestone grotto attached to the inn as a stable, among the hay and straw spread for the food and rest of the cattle, weary with their day's journey, far from home, in the midst of strangers, in circumstances so devoid of all earthly comfort or splendor that it is impossible to imagine a humbler nativity, Christ was born. Distant but a few miles, on the plateau of the abrupt and singular hill now called _Jebel Fureidis_ or \"Little Paradise Mountain,\" towered the palace--fortress of the great Herod. The magnificent houses of his friends and courtiers crowded around its base. The humble wayfarers, as they passed near it, might have heard the hired and voluptuous minstrelsy with which its feasts were celebrated, or the shouting of the rough mercenaries whose arms enforced obedience to its despotic lord. But the true King of the Jews--the rightful Lord of the universe--was not to be found in palace or fortress. They who wear soft clothing are in kings' houses. The cattle stables of the lowly caravan-serai were a more fitting birthplace for him who came to reveal that the soul of the greatest monarch was no dearer or greater in God's sight than the soul of his meanest slave; for him who had not where to lay his head; for him who, from his cross of shame, was to rule the world!--Canon Farrar.  4. Character of Herod.--Now some there are who stand amazed at the diversity of Herod's nature and purposes; for when we have respect {18} to his magnificence, and the benefits which he bestowed on all mankind, there is no possibility for even those who had the least respect for him, to deny, or not openly confess, that he had a nature vastly beneficent; but when anyone looks upon the punishment he inflicted and the injuries he did, not only to his subjects, but to his nearest relatives, and takes notice of his severe and unrelenting disposition there, he will be forced to allow that he was brutish, and a stranger to all humanity. * * * If anyone was not very obsequious to him in his language, and would not confess himself to be his slave, or but seemed to think of any innovation in his government, he was not able to contain himself, but prosecuted his very kindred and friends and punished them as if they were enemies; and this wickedness he undertook out of a desire that he might be himself alone honored. * * * A man he was of great barbarity towards all men equally, and a slave to his passion; but above the consideration of what was right.--Josephus.  5. Last Illness of Herod.--But now Herod's distemper greatly increased upon him after a severe manner, and this by God's judgment upon him for his sins; for a fire glowed in him slowly, which did not so much appear to the touch outwardly, as it augmented his pains inwardly; for it brought upon him a vehement appetite to eating, which he could not avoid to supply with one sort of food or other. His entrails were exulcerated, and the chief violence of his pain lay on his colon; an aqueous and transparent liquor also had settled itself upon his feet; * * * and when he sat upright, he had a difficulty of breathing which was very loathsome, on account of the stench of his breath, and the quickness of his returns. He had also convulsions in all parts of his body, which increased his strength to an unsufferable degree. It was said by those who pretended to divine, and who were endowed with wisdom to foretell such things, that God inflicted this punishment on the king on account of his great impurity; yet was he still in hopes of recovering, though his afflictions seemed greater than anyone could bear.--Josephus.

State of the Religious World at Messiah's Birth.--At the time of the birth of the Son of God, the enfeebled world was tottering on its foundations. The national religions which had satisfied the parents, no longer proved sufficient for the children. The new generations could not repose contented within the ancient forms. The gods of every nation, when transported to Rome--then the dominant political power in the world--there lost their oracles, as the nations themselves had there lost their liberty. Brought face to face in the capital they had destroyed each other, and their divinity had vanished. A great void was thus occasioned in the religion of the world.  2. A kind of deism, destitute alike of spirit and of life, floated for a time above the abyss in which the vigorous superstitions of antiquity had been engulfed. But like all negative creeds it had no power to reconstruct. All nations were plunged in the grossest superstition. Most of them, indeed all except the Jews, supposed that each country and province was subjected to a set of very powerful beings whom they called gods, and whom the people, in order to live happily, must propitiate with various rites and ceremonies. These deities were supposed to differ materially from each other in sex, power, nature and offices. Some nations went beyond others in impiety of worship, but all stood chargeable with absurdity, if not gross stupidity in matters of religion. (See note 1, end of section.)  {21} 3. Thus every nation had a class of deities peculiar to itself,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5241"],["title","The Eye of Zeitoon (#1)"],["body","at their waists, swaggered about as if they, and only they, were history's heirs.  It was expedient to get out of their path alertly, but they cringed into second place before the Turks, who, without any swagger at all, lorded it over every one.  For the Turk is a conqueror, whatever else he ought to be.  The poorest Turkish servant is race-conscious, and unshakably convinced of his own superiority to the princes of the conquered.  One has to bear that fact in mind when dealing with the Turk;  it colors all his views of life, and accounts for some of his famous unexpectedness.  Will and I fell in love with the crowd, and engaged a room over the great arched entrance.  We were aware from the first of the dull red marks on the walls of the room, where bed-bugs had been slain with slipper heels by angry owners of the blood;  but we were not in search of luxury, and we had our belongings and a can of insect-bane brought down from the hotel at once.  The fact that stallions squealed and fought in the stalls across the courtyard scarcely promised us uninterrupted sleep;  but sleep is not to be weighed in the balance against the news of eastern nights.  We went down to the common room close beside the main entrance, and pushed the door open a little way;  the men who sat within with their backs against it would only yield enough to pass one person in gingerly at a time.  We saw a sea of heads and hats and faces.  It looked impossible to squeeze another human being in among those already seated on the floor, nor to make another voice heard amid all that babel.  But the babel ceased, and they did make room for us--places of honor against the far wall, because of our clean clothes and nationality. We sat wedged between a Georgian in smelly, greasy woolen jacket, and a man who looked Persian but talked for the most part French. There were other Persians beyond him, for I caught the word poul--money, the perennial song and shibboleth of that folk.  The day was fine enough, but consensus of opinion had it that snow was likely falling in the Taurus Mountains, and rain would fall the next day between the mountains and the sea, making roads and fords impassable and the mountain passes risky.  So men from the ends of earth sat still contentedly, to pass earth's gossip to and fro--an astonishing lot of it.  There was none of it quite true, and some of it not nearly true, but all of it was based on fact of some sort.  Men who know the khans well are agreed that with experience one learns to guess the truth from listening to the ever-changing lies.  We could not hope to pick out truth, but sat as if in the pit of an old-time theater, watching a foreign-language play and understanding some, but missing most of it.  There was a man who drew my attention at once, who looked and was dressed rather like a Russian--a man with a high-bridged, prominent, lean nose--not nearly so bulky as his sheepskin coat suggested, but active and strong, with a fiery restless eye.  He talked Russian at intervals with the men who sat near him at the end of the room on our right, but used at least six other languages with any one who cared to agree or disagree with him.  His rather agreeable voice had the trick of carrying words distinctly across the din of countless others.  \"What do you suppose is that man's nationality?\" I asked Will, shouting to him because of the roar, although he sat next me.  \"Ermenie!\" said a Turk next but one beyond Will, and spat venomously, as if the very name Armenian befouled his mouth.  But I was not convinced that the man with the aquiline nose was Armenian. He looked guilty of altogether too much zest for life, and laughed too boldly in Turkish presence.  In those days most Armenians thereabouts were sad.  I called Will's attention to him again.  \"What do you make of him?\"  \"He belongs to that quieter party in the opposite corner.\"  (Will puts two and two together all the time, because the heroes of dime novels act that way.)       \"They're gipsies, yet I'd say he's not--\"  \"He and the others are jingaan,\" said a voice beside me in English, and I looked into the Persian's gentle brown eyes.  \"The jingaan are street robbers pure and simple,\" he added by way of explanation.  \"But what nationality?\"  \"Jingaan might be anything.  They in particular would call themselves Rommany.  We call them Zingarri.  Not a dependable people--unless--\"  I waited in vain for the qualification.  He shrugged his shoulders, as if there was no sense in praising evil qualities.  But I was not satisfied yet.  They were swarthier and stockier than the man who had interested me, and had indefinite, soft eyes.  The man I watched had brown eyes, but they were hard.  And, unlike them, he had long lean fingers and his gestures were all extravagant. He was not a Jew, I was sure of that, nor a Syrian, nor yet a Kurd.  \"Ermenie--Ermenie!\" said the Turk, watching me curiously, and spitting again.  \"That one is Ermenie.  Those others are just dogs!\"  The crowd began to thin after a while, as men filed out to feed cattle and to cook their own evening meal.  Then the perplexing person got up and came over toward me, showing no fear of the Turk at all. He was tall and lean when he stood upright, but enormously strong if one could guess correctly through the bulky-looking outer garment.  He stood in front of Will and me, his strong yellow teeth gleaming between a black beard and mustache.  The Turk got up clumsily, and went out, muttering to himself.  I glanced toward the corner where the self-evident gipsies sat, and observed that with perfect unanimity they were all feigning sleep.  \"Eenglis sportmen!\" said the man in front of us, raising both hands, palms outward, in appraisal of our clothes and general appearance.  It was not surprising that he should talk English, for what the British themselves have not accomplished in that land of a hundred tongues has been done by American missionaries, teaching in the course of a generation thousands on thousands.  (There is none like the American missionary for attaining ends at wholesale.)  \"What countryman are you?\" I asked him.  \"Zeitoonli,\" he answered, as if the word were honor itself and explanation bound in one.  Yet he looked hardly like an honorable man.  \"The chilabi are staying here?\" he asked.  Chilabi means gentleman.  \"We wait on the weather,\" said I, not caring to have him turn the tables on me and become interrogator.  He laughed with a sort of hard good humor.  \"Since when have Eenglis sportmen waited on the weather?  Ah, but you are right, effendi, none should tell the truth in this place, unless in hope of being disbelieved!\"  He laid a finger on his right eye, as I have seen Arabs do when they mean to ascribe to themselves unfathomable cunning.  \"Since you entered this common room you have not ceased to observe me closely.  The other sportman has watched those Zingarri.  What have you learned?\"  He stood with lean hands crossed now in front of him, looking at us down his nose, not ceasing to smile, but a hint less at his ease, a shade less genial.  \"I have heard you--and them--described as jingaan,\" I answered, and he stiffened instantly.  Whether or not they took that for a signal--or perhaps he made another that we did not see--the six undoubted gipsies got up and left the room, shambling out in single file with the awkward gait they share in common with red Indians.  \"Jingaan,\" he said, \"are people who lurk in shadows of the streets to rob belated travelers.  That is not my business.\"  He looked very hard indeed at the Persian, who decided that it might as well be supper-time and rose stiffly to his feet.  The Persians rob and murder, and even retreat, gracefully.  He bade us a stately and benignant good evening, with a poetic Persian blessing at the end of it.  He bowed, too, to the Zeitoonli, who bared his teeth and bent his head forward something less than an inch.  \"They call me the Eye of Zeitoon!\" he announced with a sort of savage pride, as soon as the Persian was out of ear-shot.  Will pricked his ears--schoolboy-looking ears that stand out from his head.  \"I've heard of Zeitoon.  It's a village on a mountain, where a man steps out of his front door on to a neighbor's roof, and the women wear no veils, and--\"  The man showed his teeth in another yellow smile.  \"The effendi is blessed with intelligence!  Few know of Zeitoon.\"  Will and I exchanged glances.  \"Ours,\" said Will, \"is the best room in the khan, over the entrance gate.\"  \"Two such chilabi should surely live like princes,\" he answered without a smile.  If he had dared say that and smile we would have struck him, and Monty might have been alive to-day.  But he seemed to know his place, although he looked at us down his nose again in shrewd appraisal.  Will took out tobacco and rolled what in the innocence of his Yankee heart he believed was a cigarette.  I produced and lit what he contemptuously called a \"boughten cigaroot\"--Turkish Regie, with the scent of aboriginal ambrosia.  The Zeitoonli took the hint.  \"Yarim sa' at,\" he said. \"Korkakma!\"  \"Meanin'?\" demanded Will.  \"In half an hour.  Do not be afraid!\" said he.  \"Before I grow afraid of you,\" Will retorted, \"you'll need your friends along, and they'll need knives!\"  The Zeitoonli bowed, laid a finger on his eye again, smiled and backed away.  But he did not leave the room.  He went back to the end-wall against which he had sat before, and although he did not stare at us the intention not to let us out of sight seemed pretty obvious.  \"That half-hour stuff smacked rather of a threat,\" said Will.  \"Suppose we call the bluff, and keep him waiting.  What do you say if we go and dine at the hotel?\"  But in the raw enthusiasm of entering new quarters we had made up our minds that afternoon to try out our new camp kitchen--a contraption of wood and iron we had built with the aid of the mission carpenter. And the walk to the hotel would have been a long one, through Tarsus "]]]
