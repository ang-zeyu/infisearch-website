Where did you go?\"  He almost looked surprised. \"To Mars,\" he said, like he might have said Aunt Minnie's.  The three of us looked blank for a minute and then we caught on. It took us a while to recover from laughing and my sides were still aching when I saw McCleary's face. It definitely had a hurt look on it.  \"You don't think I did,\" he accused us.  \"Oh, come off it, McCleary,\" I said crossly. \"A gag's a gag, but it can be carried too far. Where'd you go? California, Oregon, some place like that?\"  \"I said I went to Mars,\" McCleary repeated hotly, \"and I can prove it!\"  \"Sure,\" I said. \"Like I can prove the world's flat and it's supported by four elephants standing on a turtle's back like the old Greeks....\"  I cut off. McCleary had thrown a couple of pasteboards on the desk and I picked them up. The printing on it was like you see on a Pullman ticket. It said something about a roomette, first-class passage on the _Martian Prince_, for $154.75, and there was even a place where they had the tax figured. In two blanks at the top of the ticket, they had it filled out to _E. C. McCleary and wife_. The bottom half was torn off, just like they do with train tickets.  \"Very clever,\" I said, \"but you shouldn't have gone to all that trouble to have these printed up.\"  McCleary scowled and dropped a little bunch of kodachrome slides on the desk. I took one and held it up to the light. It showed Mac and his wife mounted on something that looked like a cross between a camel and a zebra. They were at the top of a sand dune and in the distance you could see the towers of a city. The funny thing was the towers looked a little--but not much--like minarets and the sand dunes were colored a beautiful pink.  I passed it on to Donley and Young and started leafing through the rest. They were beautiful slides. McCleary and spouse in front of various structures in a delicately tinted marble and crystal city. McCleary in a pink-and-black boat on a canal that looked as wide as the Mississippi. McCleary standing on a strangely carved sandstone parapet, admiring a sunset caused by a sun looking half as big as ours. And everywhere were the dunes of pink sand.  \"Pictures can be faked, Mac,\" I said.  He looked hurt and got some things out of his desk--a sateen pillow with scenes like those on his snapshots, an urn filled with pink sand, a tiny boat like a gondola, only different, a letter opener made out of peculiar bubbly pink glass. They were all stamped \"Souvenir of Mars\" and that kind of junk you don't have made up for a gag. I know mass-produced articles when I see them.  \"We couldn't afford the first-class tour,\" McCleary said expansively, \"but I figure we can cover that next year.\" He turned to me puzzledly. \"I asked the passenger agent about the _Princess of Mars_ and he said he had never heard of the ship. And it's Mars City, not Marsport. Couldn't understand how you made a mistake.\"  \"It was easy,\" I said weakly. I pointed to the pasteboard ducats. \"Where'd you get these, Mac?\"  He waved generously in the direction of downtown. \"Like you said, there's a couple of agencies downtown....\"         *       *       *       *       *  You know, sometimes I think we misjudged McCleary. It takes a while to get to know a guy like Mac. Maybe his Louie _is_ brighter than Johnny, and maybe his chugmobile _is_ something terrific.  For the last few years, all on account of Mac, my two weeks in August have really been well spent Beautiful! Why, from Mars City you can see low-slung mountains in the distance and dunes of soft, red sand stretching out to them. And the sunsets when you're standing on the parapets of that delicate crystal city.... And, man, fishing in the Grand Canal....  How do you get to Mars? There's probably a couple of agencies in your own town. You can look them up in your phone book under \"Vacation at the Planets of Pleasure\" or something like that. They might be a little difficult to find, though.  You see, they're not very well advertised yet."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/51027"],["title","Jaywalker (#1)"],["body"," had to finish the job she'd started, and do it right now, this minute. It might already be too late ... she wished, suddenly, and for the very first time, that she'd paid more attention to Jack's ramblings about orbits and turn-over points and correction blasts, and all that gobbledegook. She glanced outside again and the sky was no longer deep blue, but black. She pressed herself up out of the soft chair--it was difficult, because of the one-and-a-half gravities the ship was holding--and plodded heavily up the aisle. Miss Eagen was just rising from the chair in which she sat for the take-off.  \"Miss Eagen--\"  \"Yes, Mrs. Fos--why, what's the matter?\"  Seeing the startled expression on the stewardess' face, Marcia realized she must be looking like a ghost. She put a hand to her cheek and found it clammy.  \"Come along,\" said Miss Eagen cheerfully. She put a firm arm around Marcia's shoulder. \"Just a touch of space-sickness. This way. _That's_ it. We'll have you fixed up in a jiffy.\"  \"It isn't s-space sickness,\" said Marcia in a very small and very positive voice. She let herself be led forward, through the door and to the left, where there was a small and compact ship's hospital.  \"Now, now,\" said Miss Eagen briskly, \"just you lie down there, Mrs. Foster. Does it hurt any special place?\"  Marcia lay down gratefully. She closed her eyes tightly and said, \"I'm not Mrs. Foster. It doesn't hurt.\"  \"You're not--\" Miss Eagen apparently decided to take one thing at a time. \"How do you feel?\"  \"Scared,\" said Marcia.  \"Why, what--is there to be scared of?\"  \"I'm pregnant.\"  \"Well, that's no--You're _what_?\"  \"I'm Mrs. McHenry. I'm Jack's wife.\"  There was such a long pause that Marcia opened her eyes. Miss Eagen was looking at her levelly. She said, \"I'll have to examine you.\"  \"I know. Go ahead.\"  Miss Eagen did, swiftly and thoroughly. \"You're so right,\" she breathed. She went to the small sink, stripping off her rubber gloves. With her back to Marcia, she said, \"I'll have to tell the captain, you know.\"  \"I know. I'd rather ... tell him myself.\"  \"Thanks,\" said Miss Eagen flatly. Marcia felt as if she'd been slapped. Miss Eagen dried her hands and crossed to an intercom. \"Eagen to Captain.\"  \"McHenry here.\"  \"Captain McHenry, could you come back to the hospital right away?\"  \"Not right away, Sue.\" _Sue! No wonder he had found it so easy to walk out!_ She looked at the trim girl with hating eyes. The intercom said, \"You know I've got course-correction computations from here to yonder. Give me another forty minutes.\"  \"I think,\" said Sue Eagen into the mike, \"that the computations can wait.\"  \"The hell you do!\" The red contact light on the intercom went out.  \"He'll be right here,\" said Miss Eagen.         *       *       *       *       *  Marcia sat up slowly, clumsily. Miss Eagen did not offer to help. Marcia's hands strayed to her hair, patted it futilely.  He came in, moving fast and purposefully, as always. \"Sue, what in time do you think you--_Marcia!_\" His dark face broke into a delighted grin and he put his arms out. \"You--you're here--_here_, on my ship!\"  \"I'm pregnant, Jack,\" she said. She put out a hand to ward him off. She couldn't bear the thought of his realizing what she had done while he had his arms around her.  \"You _are_? You--we--\" He turned to Miss Eagen, who nodded once, her face wooden. \"Just find it out?\"  This time Miss Eagen didn't react at all, and Marcia knew that she had to speak up. \"No, Jack. I knew weeks ago.\"  There was no describable change in his face, but the taut skin of his space-tanned cheek seemed, somehow, to draw inward. His eyebrow ridges seemed to be more prominent, and he looked older, and very tired. Softly and slowly he asked, \"What in God's name made you get on the ship?\"  \"I had to, Jack. I had to.\"  \"Had to kill yourself?\" he demanded brutally. \"This tears it. This ties it up in a box with a bloody ribbon-bow. I suppose you know what this means--what I've got to do now?\"  \"Spin ship,\" she replied immediately, and looked up at him pertly, like a kindergarten child who knows she has the right answer.  He groaned.  \"You said you could do it.\"  \"I can ... try,\" he said hollowly. \"But--why, _why_?\"  \"Because,\" she said bleakly, \"I learned long ago that a man grows to love what he has to fight for.\"  \"And you were going to make me fight for you and the child--even if the lives of a hundred and seventy people were involved?\"  \"You said you could handle it. I thought you could.\"  \"I'll try,\" he said wearily. \"Oh, I'll try.\" He went out, dragging his feet, his shoulders down, without looking at her.  There was a stiff silence. Marcia looked up at Miss Eagen. \"It's true, you know,\" she said. \"A man grows to love the things he has to defend, no matter how he felt about them before.\"  The stewardess looked at her, her face registering a strange mixture of detachment and wonder. \"You really believe that, don't you?\"  Marcia's patience, snapped. \"You don't have to look so superior. I know what's bothering _you_. Well, he's _my_ husband, and don't you forget it.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Miss Eagen's breath hissed in. Her eyes grew bright and she shook her head slightly. Then she turned on her heel and went to the intercom. Marcia thought for a frightened moment that she was going to call Jack back again. Instead she dialed and said, \"Hospital to Maintenance. Petrucelli?\"  \"Petrucelli here.\"  \"Come up with a crescent wrench, will you, Pet?\"  Another stiff silence. A question curled into Marcia's mind and she asked it. \"Do you work on all these ships at one time or another?\"  Miss Eagen did not beat around the bush. \"I've been with Captain McHenry for three years. I hope to work with him always. I think he's the finest in the Service.\"  \"He--th-thinks as well of you, no doubt.\"  Petrucelli lounged in, a big man, easy-going, powerful. \"What's busted, muscles?\"  \"Bolt the bed to the bulkhead, Pet. Mrs. McHenry--I'm sorry, but you'll have to get up.\"  Marcia bounced resentfully off the cot and stood aside. Petrucelli looked at her, cocked an eyebrow, looked at Miss Eagen, and asked, \"Jaywalker?\"  \"Please hurry, Pet.\" She turned to Marcia. \"I've got to explain to the passengers that there won't be any free fall. Most of them are looking forward to it.\" She went out.  Marcia watched the big man work for a moment. \"Why are you putting the bed on the wall?\"  He looked at her and away, quickly. \"Because, lady, when we start to spin, that outside bulkhead is going to be _down_. Centrifugal force, see?\" And before she could answer him he added, \"I can't talk and work at the same time.\"  Feeling very much put-upon, Marcia waited silently until he was finished, and the bed hung ludicrously to the wall like a walking fly. She thanked him timidly, and he ignored it and went out.  Miss Eagen returned.  \"That man was very rude,\" said Marcia.  Miss Eagen looked at her coolly. \"I'm sorry,\" she said, obviously not meaning sorry at all.  Marcia wet her lips. \"I asked you a question before,\" she said evenly. \"About you and the captain.\"  \"You did,\" said Sue Eagen. \"Please don't.\"  \"And why not?\"  \"Because,\" said Miss Eagen, and in that moment she looked almost as drawn as Jack had, \"I'm supposed to be of service to the passengers at all times no matter what. If I have feelings at all, part of my job is to keep them to myself.\"  \"Very courteous, I'm sure. However, I want to release you from your sense of duty. I'm _most_ interested in what you have to say.\"  Miss Eagen's arched nostrils seemed pinched and white. \"You really want me to speak my piece?\"         *       *       *       *       *  In answer Marcia leaned back against the bulkhead and folded her arms. Miss Eagen gazed at her for a moment, nodded as if to herself, and said, \"I suppose there always will be people who don't pay attention to the rules. Jaywalkers. But out here jaywalkers don't have as much margin for error as they do crossing against a traffic light on Earth.\" She looked Marcia straight in the eye. \"What makes a jaywalker isn't ignorance. It's a combination of stupidity and stubbornness. The jaywalker does _know_ better. In your case....\"  She sighed. \"It's well known--even by you--that the free-fall condition has a weird effect on certain people. The human body is in an unprecedented situation in free fall. Biologically it has experienced the condition for very short periods--falling out of trees, or on delayed parachute jumps. But it isn't constituted to take hour after hour of fall.\"  \"What about floating in a pool for hours?\" asked Marcia sullenly.  \"That's quite a different situation. 'Down' exists when you're swimming. Free-fall means that everything around you is 'up.' The body's reactions to free-fall go much deeper than space-nausea and a mild feeling of panic. When there's a glandular imbalance of certain kinds, the results can be drastic. Apparently some instinctual part of the mind reacts as if there were a violent emergency, when no emergency is recognized by the reasoning part of the mind. There are sudden floods of adrenalin; the 17-kesteroids begin spastic secretions; the--well, it varies in individuals. But it's pretty well established that the results can be fatal. It kills men with prostate trouble--sometimes. It kills women in menopause--often. It kills women in the early stages of pregnancy--_always_.\"  \"But how?\" asked Marcia, interested in spite of her resentment.  \"Convulsions. A battle royal between a glandular-level panic and a violent and useless effort of the will to control the situation. Muscles tear, working against one another. Lungs rupture and air is forced into the blood-stream, causing embolism and death. Not everything is known about it, but I would guess that pregnant women are especially susceptible because their protective reflexes, through and through, are much more easily stimulated.\"  \"And the only thing that can be done about it is to supply gravity?\"  \"Or"]]]
