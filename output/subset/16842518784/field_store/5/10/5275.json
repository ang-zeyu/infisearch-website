I was--I am--in love with Anne, Doctor.\"  \"Your marriage-night would kill you, John,\" he said.         *       *       *       *       *  I jumped up with ready-made fists, then flopped down onto the grass, laughing at the picture I saw. Battle of the Century. In this corner, wearing helmet, chastity-suit, and thirty-five feet of air-hose Roy McQueen, Ph. D. In the far corner, clad only in brown trunks (grass-stained on the seat, folks), John Bogardus, M.D. \"It makes a grand old dirty joke, doesn't it?\"  \"It makes a painful reality,\" Dr. McQueen said. \"I know how you must lie awake nights, thinking about gradually acclimatizing yourself to the contaminated world in which Anne lives. You know, though, that the death-rate with the lower animals who've tried this acclimatization is steep. Even the survivors don't survive very long, because of their low gut-tone and their tardy antibody response. I suppose, though, that the imminence of death is as helpless before love as the locksmith.\" Dr. McQueen sighed. \"If it's what you want, Johnny, I'll ignore everything we both know about the probable consequences and help you break out of here.... Think how embarrassed you'd feel, though, if you died of a _B. subtilis_ septicemia or a fulminant chicken-pox the day before the wedding.\"  \"I could have married Anne, and made her either an unkissed bride or an early widow,\" I said. \"Neither of these alternatives struck me as an attractive career for the woman I love, so I left her. It's so logical it's practically simple arithmetic. Anne put up a fight to keep me, Chief; it was most warming to my amour-propre. Women aren't logical like us men of science. What a stinking situation!\"  \"It is,\" Dr. McQueen said. \"But remember, John, lovers outside the Big Tank often get just as star-crossed as you and Anne.\"  \"And they have dental caries to contend with, which we don't,\" I said. \"Somehow, Chief, we'll get this experiment into its second generation, past the miseries of the gnotobiotic first-born, we Adams and Eves who were delivered into purity by aseptic Caesarian section. Maybe we'll have to toss coins or draw cards to pair up for parent-hood. But any kids we raise will be spared that indignity. Know how I've got it figured, Chief? We've got to make provision for exogamous matings, right? Novelty, in other words, is essential to romance. Here's the way we'll work it. We'll set half the babies, boys and girls together, on one side of a wall, half on the other side. We'll have established two tribes of kids, each growing up in ignorance of the other; and we'll keep them strictly apart till they're in their middle teens. Then, maybe the night of the Junior Prom, we'll cut a door-way in that wall and introduce them to each other.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Dr. McQueen smiled. \"That will be a splendid evening, John. And a situation to make an anthropologist's mouth water. You may have found the answer to one of your children's major problems. I only wish we had as simple a solution to the current troubles of John Bogardus.\"  \"Don't blame yourself for what's happened to me,\" I said. \"I've carried on pretty bad today, but that doesn't mean that I or any of the other Lapins blame you for causing us to be birthed into the Big Tank. It had to be done. Once Dr. Reyniers had made gnotobiotics possible, a colony of germ-free humans became available. You did a good and honest job of bringing us colonists up, Chief. As good a job as anyone could do.\"  \"Thank you, John,\" he said. \"I often wonder, though, whether the Nuremberg Principles really gave us the right to build and populate this germless microcosm. We told your mothers when they volunteered that the results of raising humans gnotobiotically would be important. They have indeed. Thousands of lives have been saved by what we've learned here. We saw to it, as we'd also promised your mothers, that your health hasn't suffered by reason of experiments, that you've been given the education you need to earn a good living, and especially that your dignity as human beings has always been respected. The core question is, did we have the right to involve fellow humans, not yet born, in a process the end of which we couldn't entirely predict? Enough of this, though. My conscience is my own problem. For your immediate relief I can offer only: keep busy.\"  \"Work is dandy, but liquor's quicker,\" I said. \"A wound of the heart calls for a therapeutic drunk.\"  \"I'll honor your prescription, Doctor,\" the Chief said. \"The moment I get outside, I'll Seitz you some of my own Scotch.\" He stood up and caught hold of his air-hose. \"Forgive me for behaving so like Pollyanna, John,\" he said. \"I wish I could offer you relief more potent than Scotch and sympathy.\"  \"Such spiritual Band-aids are all the help there is, Chief. Thank you for them.\"  He slapped me on the shoulder with his gloved right hand, then walked through the shower-room, trailing his black air-hose, and dropped down the manhole into the formaldehyde sump on his way back out into the world.  I sat on my bench in my artificial garden in the middle of the great steel womb I'd been delivered into, and I thought about my Anne.         *       *       *       *       *  \"If I had a chisel and about four tons of Carrara marble,\" the girl standing behind me said, \"I'd hack me out a statue on your model, and call it _The Thinker_.\" Dorothy--the Firebird--Damien plumped her little backside onto the bench beside me and scintillated eagerness to converse.  I didn't want to talk to anyone at the moment, certainly not to the Firebird. To employ a metaphor from an appetite less exalted than love, seeing the Firebird after losing Anne was too much like being offered hamburger after having had a filet mignon snatched from under nose.  Still, as my peripheral vision took in the Firebird's brilliantly distributed five-foot-three, I realized that my metaphor was false. That flame-colored hair and impish, freckled face; that halter taut as a double-barreled ballista cocked to fire twin rounds; I turned my attention to the girlscape beside me, quite innocent of covetousness, my interest purely aesthetic. No hamburger, this. Firebird Damien was filet mignon.  But she wasn't Anne.  Suddenly I was contrite toward my fellow captive. \"You're looking splendid, Miss Damien,\" I said.  \"And you got a face peeled off the iodine bottle. Tell mamma where it hurts.\"  \"Don't delve, doll.\"  \"Woman-trouble?\" she asked.  \"The term is tautological,\" I said. \"_Woman_ and _trouble_ are synonyms. If the language had any logic the words would rhyme.\"  The Firebird put a freckled arm across my shoulder and squeezed my deltoid with her resting hand. I shrugged. \"Don't try to shake me loose, Johnny,\" she said. \"I'm trying to find out what sort of people you are. Whether you're a Shrinker or a Flesh-Presser.\"  \"Obviously, you're of the Shrinker persuasion,\" I said.  \"Hoo-hah! Shrinkers are the other race from me,\" the Firebird said. \"They're the people who quail at shaking hands, who never slap a back nor playfully pinch. They hate to be crowded, don't like to be touched. My sort of people, though, tend to cuddle like puppies, or like cattle in a thunderstorm; we take comfort in the closeness of other humans. We're not erotic about this, Johnny. Not necessarily erotic, I mean. We have our moments, too, or the Shrinkers would long since have taken over the world in spite of their dreadful handicap. We're the people who make brilliant barbers. The kind who say hello to you with a Roman handshake and a clasp on the shoulder. We're the doctors with the healing touch, the most tender nurses. We're the Flesh-Pressers.\" She gently squeezed my shoulder-muscle again to demonstrate. \"Tell me what's the matter, Johnny. Maybe I can help.\"         *       *       *       *       *  \"No magic touch will cure my trouble,\" I said. \"Anne and I are through. It was hopeless. I was like the goldfish in love with the cat. So I called our romance to a halt today and drove home in my little green sports-car, feeling a little green and hardly sporty at all. Please don't mention this again, Firebird; not till I'm old and bald and my wound has healed to a thin white scar.\"  \"Can I say one thing?\"  \"You will, so do.\"  \"I'm really sorry, Johnny.\"  \"Thank you, Firebird,\" I said. \"The Chief promised to send some therapeutic juices through the Seitz filter. If you've a mind to sample a little sterile White Horse, perhaps tie one on with me this evening, you'd be most welcome.\"  \"I'll be proud and happy,\" the Firebird said. She scooted even closer.  I found her propinquity not at all unpleasant. Was I perhaps of the Flesh-Presser clan myself? The girl smelled good, the faint wholesome feminine odor of my Lapin foster-sisters--a perfume an outside wench, host to a universe of bacteria, could approximate only with Pepsodent and the most meticulous attention to her underarms, I gather from TV.  \"How am I to entertain you, sir?\" the Firebird asked me. \"I have current gossip, vintage scandal, clever anecdotes lifted from the steaming pages of my autoclaved _Reader's Digest_, imitations of bird-songs--heavy on the mating-calls, these--and sheer adoration.\" She paused. \"Scratch that last offering, Johnny,\" she said. \"It's un-hygienic for a girl to wear her heart on her sleeve, even here.\"  \"I've lost touch with the Big Tank social whirl these last few weeks,\" I said. \"I've been spending all my alive-time in the greater world of Valparaiso, Indiana. Bring me abreast of the local gossip, Firebird, if you please.\"  \"Gladly. First there's the case of Mary deWitte. She's still on the trail of her basketball star--a fellow named Lofting--confident that somehow they'll manage to compromise her hateful purity.... Maybe I shouldn't have mentioned Mary,\" she said, seeing that I was frowning.  \"I was just"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5183"],["title","The Unexpurgated Case Against Woman Suffrage (#1)"],["body","to the conclusion that a particular generalisation is out of conformity with his experience, that generalisation will go forward shorn of some, or perchance all, its authority.  But in any case each individual generalisation must be referred further.  And at the end it will, according as it finds, or fails to find, acceptance among the thoughtful, be endorsed as a truth, and be gathered into the garner of human knowledge; or be recognised as an error, and find its place with the tares, which the householder, in time of the harvest, will tell the reapers to bind in bundles to burn them.  A. E. W. 1913.    INTRODUCTION  Programme of this Treatise--Motives  from which Women Claim the Suffrage--Types of Men who Support the Suffrage--John Stuart Mill.  The task which I undertake here is to show that the Woman's Suffrage Movement has no real intellectual or moral sanction, and that there are very weighty reasons why the suffrage should not be conceded to woman.  I would propose to begin by analysing the mental attitude of those who range themselves on the side of woman suffrage, and then to pass on to deal with the principal arguments upon which the woman suffragist relies.  The preponderating majority of the women who claim the suffrage do not do so from motives of public interest or philanthropy.  They are influenced almost exclusively by two motives: resentment at the suggestion that woman should be accounted by man as inherently his inferior in certain important respects; and reprehension of a state of society in which more money, more personal liberty (In reality only more of the personal liberty which the possession of money confers), more power, more public recognition and happier physiological conditions fall to the share of man.  A cause which derives its driving force so little from philanthropy and public interest and so much from offended _amour propre_ and pretensions which are, as we shall see, unjustified, has in reality no moral prestige.  For its intellectual prestige the movement depends entirely on the fact that it has the advocacy of a certain number of distinguished men.  It will not be amiss to examine that advocacy.  The \"intellectual\" whose name appears at the foot of woman's suffrage petitions will, when you have him by himself, very often Make confession:--\"Woman suffrage,\" he will tell you, \"is not the grave and important cause which the ardent female suffragist deems it to be. Not only will it not do any of the things which she imagines it is going to do, but it will leave the world exactly where it is. Still--the concession of votes to women is desirable from the point of view of symmetry of classification; and it will soothe the ruffled feelings of quite a number of very worthy women.\"  It may be laid down as a broad general rule that only two classes of men have the cause of woman's suffrage really at heart.  The first is the crank who, as soon as he thinks he has discerned a moral principle, immediately gets into the saddle, and then rides hell-for-leather, reckless of all considerations of public expediency.  The second is that very curious type of man, who when it is suggested in his hearing that the species woman is, measured by certain intellectual and moral standards, the inferior of the species man, solemnly draws himself up and asks, \"Are you, sir, aware that you are insulting my wife?\"  To this, the type of man who feels every unfavourable criticism of woman as a personal affront to himself, John Stuart Mill, had affinities.  We find him writing a letter to the Home Secretary, informing him, in relation to a Parliamentary Bill restricting the sale of arsenic to male persons over twenty-one years, that it was a \"gross insult to every woman, all women from highest to lowest being deemed unfit to have poison in their possession, lest they shall commit murder.\"  We find him again, in a state of indignation with the English marriage laws, preluding his nuptials with Mrs. Taylor by presenting that lady with a formal charter; renouncing all authority over her, and promising her security against all infringements of her liberty which might proceed from _himself_.  To this lady he is always ascribing credit for his eminent intellectual achievements. And lest his reader should opine that woman stands somewhat in the shade with respect to her own intellectual triumphs, Mill undertakes the explanation. \"Felicitous thoughts,\" he tells us, \"occur by hundreds to every woman of intellect. But they are mostly lost for want of a husband or friend . . . to estimate them properly, and to bring them before the world; and even when they are brought before it they generally appear as his ideas.\"  Not only did Mill see woman and all her works through an optical medium which gave images like this; but there was upon his retina a large blind area. By reason of this last it was inapprehensible to him that there could be an objection to the sexes co-operating indiscriminately in work. It was beyond his ken that the sex element would under these conditions invade whole departments of life which are now free from it. As he saw things, there was in point of fact a risk of the human race dying out by reason of the inadequate imperativeness of its sexual instincts.  Mill's unfaithfulness to the facts cannot, however, all be put down to constitutional defects of vision. When he deals with woman he is no longer scrupulously conscientious. We begin to have our suspicions of his uprightness when we find him in his _Subjection of Women_ laying it down as a fundamental postulate that the subjection of woman to man is always morally indefensible. For no upright mind can fail to see that the woman who lives in a condition of financial dependence upon man has no moral claim to unrestricted liberty. The suspicion of Mill's honesty which is thus awakened is confirmed by further critical reading of his treatise. In that skilful tractate one comes across, every here and there, a _suggestio falsi [suggestion of a falsehood],_ or a _suppressio veri [suppression of the truth],_ or a fallacious analogy nebulously expressed, or a mendacious metaphor, or a passage which is contrived to lead off attention from some weak point in the feminist case.[1] Moreover, Mill was unmindful of the obligations of intellectual morality when he allowed his stepdaughter, in connexion with feminist questions, to draft letters [2] which went forward as his own.  [1] _Vide [See]_ in this connexion the incidental references to Mill on pp. 50, 81 footnote, and 139. [2] Vide _Letters of John Stuart Mill,_ vol. ii, pp. 51, 79, 80, 100, 141, 157, 238, 239, 247, 288, and 349. There is yet another factor which must be kept in mind in connexion with the writings of Mill. It was the special characteristic of the man to set out to tackle concrete problems and then to spend his strength upon abstractions.  In his _Political Economy_, where his proper subject matter was man with his full equipment of impulses, Mill took as his theme an abstraction: an _economic man_ who is actuated solely by the desire of gain. He then worked out in great elaboration the course of conduct which an aggregate of these puppets of his imagination would pursue. Having persuaded  himself, after this, that he had in his possession a _vade mecum_ _[handbook]_ to the comprehension of human societies, he now took it upon himself to expound the principles which govern and direct these. Until such time as this procedure was unmasked, Mill's political economy enjoyed an unquestioned authority.  Exactly the same plan was followed by Mill in handling the question of woman's suffrage. Instead of dealing with woman as she is, and with woman placed in a setting of actually subsisting conditions, Mill takes as his theme a woman who is a creature of his imagination. This woman is, _by assumption_, in mental endowments a replica of man. She lives in a world which is, _by tacit assumption_, free from complications of sex. And, if practical considerations had ever come into the purview of Mill's mind, she would, _by tacit assumption_, be paying her own way, and be making full personal and financial contributions to the State. It is in connexion with this fictitious woman that Mill sets himself to work out the benefits which women would derive from co-partnership with men in the government of the State, and those which such co-partnership would confer on the community. Finally, practising again upon himself the same imposition as in his _Political Economy_, this unpractical trafficker in abstractions sets out to persuade his reader that he has, by dealing with fictions of the mind, effectively grappled with the concrete problem of woman's suffrage.  This, then, is the philosopher who gives intellectual prestige to the Woman's Suffrage cause.  But is there not, let us in the end ask ourselves, here and there at least, a man who is of real account in the world of affairs, and who is--not simply a luke-warm Platonic friend or an opportunist advocate--but an impassioned promoter of the woman's suffrage movement? One knows quite well that there is. But then one suspects--one perhaps discerns by \"the spirit sense\"--that this impassioned promoter of woman's suffrage is, on the sequestered side of his life, an idealistic dreamer: one for whom some woman's memory has become, like Beatrice for Dante, a mystic religion.  We may now pass on to deal with the arguments by which the woman suffragist has sought to establish her case.
