It's a custom. She's satisfied. I never see her before that I remember.\"  \"You _don't_?\" she says. \"The--the _callousness_! You're revolting!\"  Brooks begins to sputter, then he snickers, and all of a sudden he's howling with laughter. He is laughing at Inspector Caldwell. Then I get it, and I snort. Then I hoot and holler. It gets funnier when she gets madder still. She near blows up from being mad!  We must look crazy, the two of us there in the post, just hollering with laughter while she gets furiouser and furiouser. Finally I have to lay down on the floor to laugh more comfortable. You see, she doesn't get a bit of what I've told her about there being a special kind of evolution on Moklin. The more disgusted and furious she looks at me, the harder I have to laugh. I can't help it.         *       *       *       *       *  When we set out for the other trading post next day, the atmosphere ain't what you'd call exactly cordial. There is just the Inspector and me, with Deeth and a couple of other Moklins for the look of things. She has on a green forest suit, and with her red hair she sure looks good! But she looks at me cold when Brooks says I'll take her over to the other post, and she doesn't say a word the first mile or two.  We trudge on, and presently Deeth and the others get ahead so they can't hear what she says. And she remarks indignant, \"I must say Mr. Brooks isn't very cooperative. Why didn't he come with me? Is he afraid of the men at the other post?\"  \"Not him,\" I says. \"He's a good guy. But you got authority over him and you ain't read his reports.\"  \"If I have authority,\" she says, sharp, \"I assure you it's because I'm competent!\"  \"I don't doubt it,\" I says. \"If you wasn't cute, he wouldn't care. But a man don't want a good-looking girl giving him orders. He wants to give them to her. A homely woman, it don't matter.\"         *       *       *       *       *  She tosses her head, but it don't displease her. Then she says, \"What's in the reports that I should have read?\"  \"I don't know,\" I admit. \"But he's been sweating over them. It makes him mad that nobody bothered to read 'em.\"  \"Maybe,\" she guesses, \"it was what I need to know about this other trading post. What do you know about it, Mr. Brinkley?\"  I tell her what Deeth has told Brooks. Brooks found out about it because one day some Moklins come in to trade and ask friendly why we charge so much for this and that. Deeth told them we'd always charged that, and they say the other trading post sells things cheaper, and Deeth says what trading post? So they up and tell him there's another post that sells the same kind of things we do, only cheaper. But that's all they'll say.  So Brooks tells Deeth to find out, and he scouts around and comes back. There is another trading post only fifteen miles away, and it is selling stuff just like ours. And it charges only half price. Deeth didn't see the men--just the Moklin clerks. We ain't been able to see the men either.  \"Why haven't you seen the men?\"  \"Every time Brooks or me go over,\" I explain, \"the Moklins they got working for them say the other men are off somewhere. Maybe they're starting some more posts. We wrote 'em a note, asking what the hell they mean, but they never answered it. Of course, we ain't seen their books or their living quarters--\"  \"You could find out plenty by a glimpse at their books!\" she snaps. \"Why haven't you just marched in and made the Moklins show you what you want to know, since the men were away?\"  \"Because,\" I says, patient, \"Moklins imitate humans. If we start trouble, they'll start it too. We can't set a example of rough stuff like burglary, mayhem, breaking and entering, manslaughter, or bigamy, or those Moklins will do just like us.\"  \"Bigamy!\" She grabs on that sardonic. \"If you're trying to make me think you've got enough moral sense--\"  I get a little mad. Brooks and me, we've explained to her, careful, how it is admiration _and_ the way evolution works on Moklin that makes Moklin kids get born with long whiskers and that the compliment the Moklin girl has paid me is just exactly that. But she hasn't listened to a word.  \"Miss Caldwell,\" I says, \"Brooks and me told you the facts. We tried to tell them delicate, to spare your feelings. Now if you'll try to spare mine, I'll thank you.\"  \"If you mean your finer feelings,\" she says, sarcastic, \"I'll spare them as soon as I find some!\"  So I shut up. There's no use trying to argue with a woman. We tramp on through the forest without a word. Presently we come on a nest-bush. It's a pretty big one. There are a couple dozen nests on it, from the little-bitty bud ones no bigger than your fist, to the big ripe ones lined with soft stuff that have busted open and have got cacklebirds housekeeping in them now.  There are two cacklebirds sitting on a branch by the nest that is big enough to open up and have eggs laid in it, only it ain't. The cacklebirds are making noises like they are cussing it and telling it to hurry up and open, because they are in a hurry.  \"That's a nest-bush,\" I says. \"It grows nests for the cacklebirds. The birds--uh--fertilize the ground around it. They're sloppy feeders and drop a lot of stuff that rots and is fertilizer too. The nest-bush and the cacklebirds kind of cooperate. That's the way evolution works on Moklin, like Brooks and me told you.\"  She tosses that red head of hers and stamps on, not saying a word. So we get to the other trading post. And there she gets one of these slow-burning, long-lasting mads on that fill a guy like me with awe.  There's only Moklins at the other trading post, as usual. They say the humans are off somewhere. They look at her admiring and polite. They show her their stock. It is practically identical with ours--only they admit that they've sold out of some items because their prices are low. They act most respectful and pleased to see her.  But she don't learn a thing about where their stuff comes from or what company is horning in on Moklin trade. And she looks at their head clerk and she burns and burns.         *       *       *       *       *  When we get back, Brooks is sweating over memorandums he has made, getting another report ready for the next Company ship. Inspector Caldwell marches into the trade room and gives orders in a controlled, venomous voice. Then she marches right in on Brooks.  \"I have just ordered the Moklin sales force to cut the price on all items on sale by seventy-five per cent,\" she says, her voice trembling a little with fury. \"I have also ordered the credit given for Moklin trade goods to be doubled. They want a trade war? They'll get it!\"         *       *       *       *       *  She is a lot madder than business would account for. Brooks says, tired, \"I'd like to show you some facts. I've been over every inch of territory in thirty miles, looking for a place where a ship could land for that other post. There isn't any. Does that mean anything to you?\"  \"The post is there, isn't it?\" she says. \"And they have trade goods, haven't they? And we have exclusive trading rights on Moklin, haven't we? That's enough for me. Our job is to drive them out of business!\"  But she is a lot madder than business would account for. Brooks says, very weary, \"There's nearly a whole planet where they could have put another trading post. They could have set up shop on the other hemisphere and charged any price they pleased. But they set up shop right next to us! Does _that_ make sense?\"  \"Setting up close,\" she says, \"would furnish them with customers already used to human trade goods. And it furnished them with Moklins trained to be interpreters and clerks! And--\" Then it come out, what she's raging, boiling, steaming, burning up about. \"And,\" she says, furious, \"it furnished them with a Moklin head-clerk who is a very handsome young man, Mr. Brooks! He not only resembles you in every feature, but he even has a good many of your mannerisms. You should be very proud!\"  With this she slams out of the room. Brooks blinks.  \"She won't believe anything,\" he says, sour, \"except only that man is vile. Is that true about a Moklin who looks like me?\"  I nod.  \"Funny his folks never showed him to me for a compliment-present!\" Then he stares at me, hard. \"How good is the likeness?\"  \"If he is wearing your clothes,\" I tell him, truthful, \"I'd swear he is you.\"  Then Brooks--slow, very slow--turns white. \"Remember the time you went off with Deeth and his folks, hunting? That was the time a Moklin got killed. You were wearing guest garments, weren't you?\"  I feel queer inside, but I nod. Guest garments, for Moklins, are like the best bedroom and the drumstick of the chicken among humans. And a Moklin hunting party is something. They go hunting _garlikthos_, which you might as well call dragons, because they've got scales and they fly and they are tough babies.  The way to hunt them is you take along some cacklebirds that ain't nesting--they are no good for anything while they're honeymooning--and the cacklebirds go flapping around until a _garlikthos_ comes after them, and then they go jet-streaking to where the hunters are, cackling a blue streak to say, \"Here I come, boys! Hold everything until I get past!\" Then the _garlikthos_ dives after them and the hunters get it as it dives.  You give the cacklebirds its innards, and they sit around and eat, cackling to each other, zestful, like they're bragging about the other times they done the same thing, only better.  \"You were wearing guest garments?\" repeats Brooks, grim.  I feel very queer inside, but I nod again. Moklin guest garments are mighty easy on the skin and feel mighty good. They ain't exactly practical hunting clothes, but the Moklins feel bad if a human that's their guest don't wear them.

Explain!\"  \"Uncle Isadore had it set up,\" I told him, using the same patiently impatient tone he used on me. \"He knew I'd recognize that lead coin. There was a cuff link in it.\"  \"A cuff link!\"  \"A studs and neck clasp man has to know about cuff links, too. This happens to be an expensive cuff link, but worth only about a year's salary, not a million dollars. They're held together by a jazzed-up electromagnetic force rather than by a clasp. This force is so strong it would take a derrick to pull them apart. The idea is to keep you from losing one. If you drop it to the floor, you just wave the mate around a little and it pops up through the air.\"  \"How do you get them apart?\"  \"Just slip them sideways, like a magnet. You can sheathe them in lead, like the one I found, to cut down the attraction. This is how they're packaged. You don't know about them because they're not advertised--that keeps them a luxury item, you know.\"  \"So your Uncle Isadore pasted one of them on the port button.\"  \"He didn't have to paste. All he had to do was stick it on. All I had to do was line up the mate to it and the attractive force pushed the button.\"  \"That's very neat,\" Rene said. \"But why the hell didn't he just leave the port open? He'd hardly do this sort of thing with his dying gasp.\"  \"I'm not sure,\" I admitted. \"As a matter of fact, I wonder why he radared _me_ if he really wanted to be rescued. He had plenty of friends who could rescue him more reliably.\"         *       *       *       *       *  I had an inkling of what had been on Uncle Isadore's mind. Although Uncle Izzy had had three--or was it four?--wives, he'd very carefully had no children. And it had occurred to him at an advanced age to take an interest in me.  He'd sent me through two years of general studies and reluctantly let me specialize in studs and neck clasps.  \"You were a grilch hop expert in Middle School,\" he had told me. \"How come you're getting so stuffy?\"  \"Because I can't be an adolescent all my life, Uncle Isadore,\" I had replied stiffly. \"I would like to get into some solid line of work and be a good citizen.\"  \"Phooey!\" he'd said. But he had let me do what I'd wanted. It was because of this that I had felt duty bound to answer his call for help.  I'd _not_ felt duty bound to take all the opportunities he'd tried to force on me when I got out of school. Mining the semi-solid seas of Alphard kappa. Fur trading on Procyon beta. And a hundred others, all obviously doomed to failure unless there was one lucky chance.  \"But I'm _happy_ here with my little room and my little job,\" I kept telling Uncle Isadore.  \"You only think you're happy because you don't know any better,\" he kept telling me.  Only, now that he was dead, he seemed to have me where he wanted me. Now that nothing could matter to him any longer.  \"Maybe he was getting senile,\" Rene suggested.  \"Uncle Izzy always said he'd rather die than--he _did_ die,\" I replied, suddenly recalling myself to the present and the open outside port of the ship. I realized how reluctant I was to go in. It was one thing to admit Uncle Izzy was dead--I cherished no great affection for him--but it was something else to have to face his dead body.  \"Would you mind going in first?\" I asked Rene.  He shrugged and shouldered the inside door open.  He came out, his face a study in perplexity. \"Not here!\" he said. \"This is the first time I've been wrong in fifteen years!\"  \"That's because it's the first time you've been up against Uncle Izzy. He must have closed the port behind him the same way I opened it.\"  I climbed through the door, feeling immensely relieved. I realized then what had really been worrying me. If the gods had abandoned Isadore at the last, what did they have in mind for the rest of us mere mortals?  I kicked at my mind irritably, knowing these were young thoughts. But then I _am_ young, I explained to myself.         *       *       *       *       *  The inside of the ship was neat and empty. Stuck on the instrument panel with a vaccup was a note, in Uncle Izzy's flowery script.      _My boy. I have died of boredom. Do not look for the remains. I     have hidden my body to avoid the banality of a decent burial.     I bequeath you my entire fortune. Find it._  Rene groaned. \"I suppose now you want to look for the body.\"  \"No. If he says it's hidden, it's hidden. But it would be a little silly to go off without finding his fortune, wouldn't it?\"  \"Looking for buried treasure wasn't in the contract,\" Rene pointed out. \"You'll have to make it worth my while.\"  \"Another five thousand,\" I said.  \"Make it ten. Payable if I find it.\"  \"Suppose _I_ find it?\"  \"Don't be ridiculous. You'd be a fool to take two steps on this planet without me.\"  He was right, of course. And if we left, I wouldn't get anything. I thought of Mother living by the bells at a Comfort Park. \"All right,\" I said.  \"What form was his fortune in?\" Rene asked. \"Money? Bonds? Polarian droplets? It would help to know what I'm looking for.\"  \"I have no idea,\" I confessed. \"Ordinarily it would take a computer to figure out Uncle Isadore's financial affairs. But he'd have been perfectly capable of selling out everything and taking his entire fortune along with him for some new project.\"  Rene had skillfully unscrewed the instrument panel and he lifted it off and began poking inside and removing mysterious bits of machinery. \"That makes it harder. You don't know whether he sold out or not?\"  \"I have no idea. He might have all his money piled in the locker of the Whist Club of Sirius beta. In that case, we look for a key. Or he might have a block of Eretrevium buried somewhere. Your guess is as good as mine.\"  \"If he's dug up the ground,\" Rene said, \"I'll recognize the spot. But that'll mean walking over every inch of ground for a day's journey around. Or more, if he did any overnight traveling.\"  \"Not Uncle Izzy,\" I said. \"He wouldn't be at all likely to spend a freezing night out on Alvarla, even for a good joke.\"  \"Radar equipment's in perfect shape,\" Rene said, shifting his activities to another segment of the ship's equipment. \"I wonder why he didn't leave it on so we could locate him easier. Not that we had any trouble. Or why he didn't continue broadcasting for help until he died.... Mind if I take some of the equipment?\"  \"You haven't been exactly generous with me.\"  \"I intend to subtract its value from the cost of supplies and mileage on my ship. I never said I was generous, but, by God, I'm honest.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Rene slid out the compartment of lunch packages, dumped them on the floor.  \"All unopened,\" he was saying disgustedly. Then he picked up a heavy, square object with sharp corners, open on three sides. \"What the hell is this?\"  \"A book,\" I informed him.  Rene opened it \"Hey! A real, antique book! Must be worth at least a thousand! Look at the _size_ of that print! You can read it with the naked eye, like an instrument panel! Well, here's a little piece of your fortune.\"  He tossed it to me and went on examining the lunch packages. He didn't trust me to help him because _I_ wouldn't be able to tell if they'd been opened and something inserted.  I hung the book by the covers and let the pages flip open. Nothing fell out. I sighed. I'd have to go through the whole damn thing.  \"I'm going back to your ship and read in comfort,\" I told Rene.  \"You're no help here anyway,\" he said, putting the lunch packages in a large plastic bag he'd found somewhere. \"No use letting these go to waste.\"  I didn't tell him I had the clue to Uncle Isadore's fortune in my hand. He didn't know Uncle Isadore, so he wouldn't have believed me.  Nothing is more uncomfortable than reading an antique book. There is no way to lie back and flash it on a screen or run the tape over your reading glasses while you lie prone and relax. You have to _hold_ it. If you try to hold it lying down, your arms get tired. If you put it down on a table to read, your neck gets tired from bending over. And the pages keep flipping and make you lose your place.  Still, I read it all the way through. It wasn't too bad. Not like Edgar Guest, of course, who was the only ancient author I liked in General Studies. But I found there was a sort of Grilch Hop beat to it that reminded me of the Footlooses I used to go to in Middle School. I grinned. It was funny to think of now.  I found no clues in the book. The only thing to do was read it again, more carefully.         *       *       *       *       *  I noticed there was one poem with a _real_ Grilch Hop beat. I thought suddenly of Sally, my regular partner at the Footlooses. She was very blonde and she affected a green crestwave in her hair, pulled over her forehead with a diamond clip. She was a beauty, all right. But she was a little silly. And she had that tendency to overdress.  No, I sighed, she wouldn't have done for a studs and neck clasp man. But I couldn't help wondering where she was now and what she was like now. Did she remember me, and did she think about me when she heard that song we used to dance to, because it was about a girl named Sally?      Once I knew a girl named Sally     Met her at a Footloose rally  I began humming the Grilch Hop tune to the ancient poem in Uncle Algy's book. It was fantastic how closely it fitted, though, of course, the words in the poem were plain silly.  But imagine finding a poem with a perfect Grilch Hop beat before anybody even knew what a grilch was! Before Venus was even discovered. Jump on both feet. Hop three times on the left foot. Jump. Hop three times on the right foot. The rhythm was correct, right down to the breakaway and four-step at the end of each run.  It was while I was singing this poem to a Grilch Hop tune that I noticed the clue. The poem was named \"The Dodo.\" And the rhyming was very smooth until I came to the lines:      \"Th"]]]
