If Christianity does, in an especial manner, _befit_ this faculty, if it is adapted to promote our general rectitude and happiness, and if it contains no principle which is not discernible in the government of the visible world, then there is no discrepancy between Christianity and Providence.  This is Butler’s position. He confines himself to proving such an analogy between revelation and the daily course of things, as that nothing known in the universe can be offered in disproof of Christianity. The mode of warfare was new. Without professing to prove Christianity to be true, he demonstrates that it cannot be proved to be false; and that if it be even probable, the rejection of it is a gross folly and a tremendous hazard. Every objection against it he proves to be equally forcible against facts which constantly occur, and which all admit, though none profess to understand. Thus leaving the ramparts of the church to be guarded by the mighty men who had valiantly maintained its defence, he quietly walked out into the camp of the enemy, and spiked every gun!  It has been said that the whole argument of the “Analogy” seems to be built on Ecclesiasticus xlii. 24: “All things are double, one against the other, and God hath made nothing imperfect.” If it be so, it involves no disparagement to have received thus the seminal idea of this immortal work. Who else has so gloriously discerned and expanded the profound philosophy of the son of Sirac? Others have uttered sentiments which seem to involve the whole exposition of Butler. Origen affirms that “he who believes the Scripture to have proceeded from Him who is the Author of nature, may well expect to find the same sort of difficulties in it, as are found in nature.” Shall we assign to Origen the whole credit of the “Analogy”? As well might we bestow all our admiration for the delightful papers of Addison, in the Spectator, to the classical authors from whom he selected appropriate mottoes! By such a rule, the entire merit of this most Christian work of Butler should be attributed to the pagan Quintilian, from whom he derives the motto which so appropriately graces his title-page.  A rapid sketch of the outline of the argument will aid the student at his outset. He begins by taking for granted the existence of an intelligent Author and Governor of the universe. Then, from the conditions and changes observed in the visible world, he argues the folly of objecting to revelation on account of doctrines which do but declare the same general laws and the same principles of government. That there is this harmony, he proves; and hence the probability that the same sort of government will prevail hereafter, which prevails now. He demonstrates that man is under exactly such a probation in this world, and as to this world, as revelation affirms him to be under, as to the next; and that embarrassments produced by the doctrine of necessity, involve nature no less than religion. He then evinces the need that man should be placed in a state of training and trial, if he is ever to be qualified for better conditions; and that this world, as now governed, is exactly adapted to give that training, and to produce such a character as will insure happiness under any possible contingencies. This is the argument of Part I.  Proceeding to examine Christianity, he discusses its importance, its proofs, the unavoidableness of its containing strange things, the absurdity of expecting fully to comprehend its statements, and the abundance of its evidence for candid minds, though they are not, and ought not to be, irresistible. He answers not only the objections to Christianity, but the objections against its proofs; which he shows are very different things. Though he keeps rigidly to the refutation of objections, and nowhere meddles with the direct evidence of Christianity, yet, by removing every objection, he does in fact confirm its claims. This clearing away of objections, _after_ the usual proofs are presented, crowns and completes the evidence. Thus the ultimate result of a study of his book is not only negative but positive; and such has been its effect on every candid and competent student.  We should remember that we have no right to require the removal of objections, and that therefore the whole of Butler’s work is in fact supererogatory; a concession and kindness to such as have doubts, either honest or captious. Our only rightful demand of Christianity is for _credentials_. It presents these in its nature, its miracles, its prophecies, its propagation, its influence, and its success. If these are competent, we should bow to its teachings. To suppose that we are capable of judging of the _propriety_ of all God’s law, or even to understand his reasons for it, if they were disclosed, is absurd.  It is true we naturally presume that a revelation in words, and a revelation by natural objects and the visible order of things, would coincide; but to find out the fact or the extent of such coincidence, is not our first business. We are to weigh the _testimony_ in favor of religion, embrace it, if sufficient, and attribute the obscurity of any part, to our present want of capacity. The solution of difficulties serves to _confirm_ our faith in Christianity, but has no place in our _ground of reception_: and we have no right to wait for such solution, however painful and embarrassing may be the difficulties.  Another, and perhaps even more important, use of the “Analogy,” is to dissipate the prejudices and objections to Christianity which prevent a candid study of its evidences. These prepossess and poison the mind, and obstruct or abate the force of the best arguments. Few, if any, after a careful examination of the positive evidences of Christianity, conclude them to be inadequate. But many are they, who having heard objections which their scanty learning does not enable them to answer, and their no less scanty interest in the subject does not induce them to examine, or which their inclinations lead them to cherish, cast it all aside. In this way they relieve themselves from the labor of investigation, as well as their compunctions of conscience; while they indulge both their love of sin and pride of singularity.  An instance of the use of this book to such a mind, we have in the case of Chalmers. He had read, when a young man, several infidel productions. Their semblance of logic and learning, and supercilious confidence of style, disposed him to regard all religion as mere superstition. His mind was poisoned. Accustomed as he had been to the positive and precise reasonings of mathematics, he could not find similar proofs for Christianity. But he was induced, by some friends, to study Butler’s Analogy. This, as he expresses it, took Christianity “out of the class of unlikelihoods.” It brought him to the investigation, as if the evidence was neither plus nor minus. He examined the evidences as he would have done a declaration that Cicero weighed just one hundred and fifty pounds; open to the smallest proof or presumption on the positive side of the question. Delivered from prejudice, not only against Christianity but against its proofs, he soon saw the madness of deism, and immovably accepted the word of God, though he did not, at that time, feel its transforming power on his own heart. Long afterwards he writes, “I cannot render sufficient homage to the argument, which first, addressing itself to the _subject-matter_ of Christianity, relieves it of all disproof, and pronounces it worthy of a trial; and then, addressing itself to the evidence of Christianity, relieves it of all objections, and makes good, to that evidence, all the entireness and efficiency which natively belong to it.” Years afterwards he said, “Butler made me a Christian.” That it did far more for him than to effect his change of sentiment, that it continued to be a light in his firmament, is touchingly told in the Preface of his Bridgewater Treatise, where he says, “I have derived greater aid from the views and reasonings of Butler, than I have been able to find, besides, in the whole range of our extant authorship.”  To the sincere believer in the word of God the study of Butler is of great use. Doubts are among Satan’s tried weapons, and often haunt the holiest, especially if of a contemplative turn. They see goodness oppressed, and vice rampant; the world ruled by wicked men, and truth making its way with difficulty. Their hearts are traitorous, their surroundings full of temptation, and the direct evidence of Christianity they may never have studied. To such the analogical argument comes with full power, meets a candid examination, and prevails.  To no Christian is this book so useful as the minister. He is constantly confronted by the difficulties which Butler so triumphantly handles. Here he is furnished, not only with a shield to protect his own mind from subtle darts, but a sword to demolish the cavil, and defend the system of which he is a public teacher.  To _all_ persons this book is of great value. We arrive at certainty in but few of our decisions, and are often obliged, even in matters of great moment, to act on probability. Thus we employ precautions when an evil is not certain to occur. If the evil would be very serious, we adopt the precaution, when there is but little probability, or perhaps a bare possibility, of its occurrence. Now, Butler has shown that if the proofs of revelation were weak, nay, if it had absolutely no proof, nay further, if on fair examination there appeared not even a probability of its truth, still there would remain a _possibility_, and this alone, considering the tremendous issues at stake, should make every man a Christian. This argument cannot be applied to Mahometanism or any other religion, because against those much may be advanced as _disproof_.

But if you put a sparrow or mouse on the grass plot, you know that directly your back is turned it will be off.  All animals move of themselves. But only so long as they are alive. When you find the body of a snake on the road, the first thing you do is to stir it with a stick. If it moves only as you move it, and as far as you move it, just as a bit of rope might do, you say it is dead. But if, when you touch it, it stirs of itself, wriggles about, and perhaps at last glides away, you know it is alive. Every living animal, of whatever kind, from yourself down to the tiniest creature that swims about in a little pool of water and cannot be seen without a microscope, moves of itself. Left to itself, it moves and rests, rests and moves; stirred by anything, away it goes, running, flying, creeping, crawling, or swimming.  Something of the kind sometimes happens with lifeless things. When a stone is carefully balanced on the top of a high wall, a mere touch will send it toppling down to the ground. But when it has reached the ground it stops there, and if you want to repeat the trick you must carry the stone up to the top of the wall again. You know the toy made like a mouse, which, when you touch it in a particular place, runs away apparently of its own accord, as if it were alive. But it soon stops, and when it has stopped you may touch it again and again without making it go on. Not until you have wound it up will it go on again as it did before. And every time you want it to run you must wind it up afresh. Living animals move again and again, and yet need no winding up, for they are always winding themselves up. Indeed, as we go on in our studies we shall come to look upon our own bodies and those of all animals as pieces of delicate machinery with all manner of springs, which are always running down but always winding themselves up again.  =3. You are warm=; beautifully warm, even on the coldest winter day, if you have been running hard; very warm if you are well wrapped up with clothing, which, as you say, keeps the cold out, but really keeps the warmth in. The bed you go to at night may be cold, but it is warm when you leave it in the morning. Your body is as good as a fire, warming itself and everything near it.  The bird too is warm, so is the dog and the horse, and every four-footed beast you know. Some animals however, such as reptiles, frogs, fish, snails, insects, and the like do not seem warm when you touch them. Yet really they are always a little warm, and some times they get quite warm. If you were to put a thermometer into a hive of bees when they are busy you would find that they are very warm indeed. All animals are more or less warm as long as they are alive, some of them, such as birds and four-footed beasts, being very warm. But only so long as they are alive; after death they quickly become cold. When you find a bird lying on the grass quite still, not stirring when it is touched, to make quite sure of its being dead you feel it. If it is quite cold, you say it has been dead some time; if it is still warm, you say it is only just dead--perhaps hardly dead, and may yet revive.  =4. You are warm, and you move about of yourself. You are able to move because you are warm; you are warm in order that you may move. How does this come about?= Just think for a moment of something which is not an animal, but which is warm and moves about, which only moves when it is warm, and which is warm in order that it may move. I mean a locomotive steam-engine. What makes the engine move? The burning coke or coal, whose heat turns the water into steam, and so works the piston, while at the same time the whole engine becomes warm. You know that for the engine to do so much work, to run so many miles, so much coal must be burnt; to keep it working it must be “stoked” with fresh coal, and all the while it is working it is warm: when its stock of coal is burnt out it stops, and, like a dead animal, grows cold.  Well, your body too, just like the steam-engine, moves about and is warm, because a fire is always burning in your body. That fire, like the furnace of the engine, needs fresh fuel from time to time, only your fuel is not coal, but food. In three points your body differs from the steam-engine. In the first place, you do not use your fire to change water into steam, but in quite a different way, as we shall see further on. Secondly, your fire is a burning not of dry coal, but of wet food, a burning which although an oxidation (Chemistry Primer, Art. 5) takes place in the midst of water, and goes on without any light being given out. Thirdly, the food you take is not burnt in a separate part of your body, in a furnace like that of the engine set apart for the purpose. The food becomes part and parcel of your body, and it is your whole body which is burnt, bit by bit.  Thus it is the food burning or being oxidized within your body, or as part of your body, which enables you to move and keeps you warm. If you try to do without food, you grow chilly and cold, feeble, faint, and too weak to move. If you take the right quantity of proper food, you will be able to get the best work out of the engine, your body; and if you work your body aright, you can keep yourself warm on the coldest winter day, without any need of artificial fire.  =5.= But if this be so, in order to oxidize your food, you =have need of oxygen=. The fire of the engine goes out if it is not fed with air as well as fuel. So will your fire too. If you were shut up in an air-tight room, the oxygen in the room would get less and less, from the moment you entered the room, being used up by you; the oxidation of your body would after a while flag, and you would soon die for want of fresh oxygen (see Chemistry Primer, p. 14).  You have, throughout your whole life, a need of fresh oxygen, you must always be breathing fresh air to carry on in your body the oxidation which gives you strength and warmth.  =6.= When a candle is burnt (Chemistry Primer, p. 6) it turns into carbonic acid, and water. When wood or coal is burnt, we get ashes as well. If you were to take all your daily food and dry it, it too would burn into ashes, carbonic acid, and water (with one or two other things of which we shall speak afterwards).  Your body is always giving out carbonic acid (Chemistry Primer, Exp. 7). Your body is always giving out water by the lungs, as seen when you breathe on a glass, by the skin, and by the kidneys; and we shall see that we always give out more water than we take in as food or drink. Your body too is daily giving out by the kidneys and bowels, matters which are not exactly ashes, but very like them. We do not oxidize our food quite into ashes, but very nearly; we burn it into substances which are no longer useful for oxidation in the body, and which, being useless, are cast out of the body as waste matters.  The tale then is complete. By the help of the oxygen of the air which you take in as you breathe, you oxidize the food which is in your body. You get rid of the water, the carbonic acid, and other waste matters which are left after the oxidation, and out of the oxidation you get the heat which keeps you warm and the power which enables you to move.  Thus all your life long you are in constant need of oxygen and food. The oxygen you take in at every breath, the food at every meal. How you get rid of the waste matters we shall see further on.  If you were to live, as one philosopher of old did, in a large pair of delicate scales, you would find that the scale in which you were would sink down at every meal, and gradually rise between as you got lighter and hungry. If the food you took were more than you wanted, so that it could not all be oxidized, it would remain in your body as part of your flesh, and you would grow heavier and stouter from day to day; if it were less, you would grow thinner and lighter; if it were just as much as and no more than you needed, you would remain day after day of exactly the same weight, the scale in which you sat rising as much between meals as it sank at the meal time.  What we have to learn in this Primer is--How the food becomes part and parcel of your body; how it gets oxidized; how the oxidation gives you power to move; how it is that you are able to move in all manner of ways, when you like, how you like, and as much as you like.  First of all we must learn something about the build of your body, of what parts it is made, and how the parts are put together.     THE PARTS OF WHICH THE BODY IS MADE UP. § II.   =7.= When you want to make a snow man, you take one great roll of snow to make the body or trunk. This you rest on two thinner rolls which serve as legs. Near the top of the trunk you stick in another thin roll on either side--these you call the two arms: and lastly, on quite the top of the trunk you place a round ball for a head. Head, trunk, and limbs, _i.e._ legs and arms--these together make up a complete body.  In your snow man these are all alike, all balls of snow differing only in size and form; but in your own body, head, trunk, and limbs are quite unlike, as you might easily tell on taking them to pieces. Now you cannot very well take your own body to pieces, but you easily can that of a dead rabbit. Suppose you take one of the limbs, say a leg, to begin with.  First of all there is the =skin= with the hair on the outside. If you carefully cut this through with a knife or pair of scissors and strip it off, you will find it smooth and shiny inside. Underneath the skin you see what you call =flesh=, rather paler, not so red as the flesh of beef or mutton, but still quite like it. Covering the flesh there may be a little =fat=. In a sheep’s leg as you see it at the butcher’s there is a good deal of fat, in the rabbit’s there is very little.  This reddish flesh you must henceforward learn to speak of as =muscle="]]]
