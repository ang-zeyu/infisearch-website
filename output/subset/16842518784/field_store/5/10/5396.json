I’ll pay you five cents extra for your trouble.”  He handed Dick a two-dollar bill, which our hero took into a store close by.  “Will you please change that, sir?” said Dick, walking up to the counter.  The salesman to whom he proffered it took the bill, and, slightly glancing at it, exclaimed angrily, “Be off, you young vagabond, or I’ll have you arrested.”  “What’s the row?”  “You’ve offered me a counterfeit bill.”  “I didn’t know it,” said Dick.  “Don’t tell me. Be off, or I’ll have you arrested.”     CHAPTER III. DICK MAKES A PROPOSITION   Though Dick was somewhat startled at discovering that the bill he had offered was counterfeit, he stood his ground bravely.  “Clear out of this shop, you young vagabond,” repeated the clerk.  “Then give me back my bill.”  “That you may pass it again? No, sir, I shall do no such thing.”  “It doesn’t belong to me,” said Dick. “A gentleman that owes me for a shine gave it to me to change.”  “A likely story,” said the clerk; but he seemed a little uneasy.  “I’ll go and call him,” said Dick.  He went out, and found his late customer standing on the Astor House steps.  “Well, youngster, have you brought back my change? You were a precious long time about it. I began to think you had cleared out with the money.”  “That aint my style,” said Dick, proudly.  “Then where’s the change?”  “I haven’t got it.”  “Where’s the bill then?”  “I haven’t got that either.”  “You young rascal!”  “Hold on a minute, mister,” said Dick, “and I’ll tell you all about it. The man what took the bill said it wasn’t good, and kept it.”  “The bill was perfectly good. So he kept it, did he? I’ll go with you to the store, and see whether he won’t give it back to me.”  Dick led the way, and the gentleman followed him into the store. At the reappearance of Dick in such company, the clerk flushed a little, and looked nervous. He fancied that he could browbeat a ragged boot-black, but with a gentleman he saw that it would be a different matter. He did not seem to notice the newcomers, but began to replace some goods on the shelves.  “Now,” said the young man, “point out the clerk that has my money.”  “That’s him,” said Dick, pointing out the clerk.  The gentleman walked up to the counter.  “I will trouble you,” he said a little haughtily, “for a bill which that boy offered you, and which you still hold in your possession.”  “It was a bad bill,” said the clerk, his cheek flushing, and his manner nervous.  “It was no such thing. I require you to produce it, and let the matter be decided.”  The clerk fumbled in his vest-pocket, and drew out a bad-looking bill.  “This is a bad bill, but it is not the one I gave the boy.”  “It is the one he gave me.”  The young man looked doubtful.  “Boy,” he said to Dick, “is this the bill you gave to be changed?”  “No, it isn’t.”  “You lie, you young rascal!” exclaimed the clerk, who began to find himself in a tight place, and could not see the way out.  This scene naturally attracted the attention of all in the store, and the proprietor walked up from the lower end, where he had been busy.  “What’s all this, Mr. Hatch?” he demanded.  “That boy,” said the clerk, “came in and asked change for a bad bill. I kept the bill, and told him to clear out. Now he wants it again to pass on somebody else.”  “Show the bill.”  The merchant looked at it. “Yes, that’s a bad bill,” he said. “There is no doubt about that.”  “But it is not the one the boy offered,” said Dick’s patron. “It is one of the same denomination, but on a different bank.”  “Do you remember what bank it was on?”  “It was on the Merchants’ Bank of Boston.”  “Are you sure of it?”  “I am.”  “Perhaps the boy kept it and offered the other.”  “You may search me if you want to,” said Dick, indignantly.  “He doesn’t look as if he was likely to have any extra bills. I suspect that your clerk pocketed the good bill, and has substituted the counterfeit note. It is a nice little scheme of his for making money.”  “I haven’t seen any bill on the Merchants’ Bank,” said the clerk, doggedly.  “You had better feel in your pockets.”  “This matter must be investigated,” said the merchant, firmly. “If you have the bill, produce it.”  “I haven’t got it,” said the clerk; but he looked guilty notwithstanding.  “I demand that he be searched,” said Dick’s patron.  “I tell you I haven’t got it.”  “Shall I send for a police officer, Mr. Hatch, or will you allow yourself to be searched quietly?” said the merchant.  Alarmed at the threat implied in these words, the clerk put his hand into his vest-pocket, and drew out a two-dollar bill on the Merchants’ Bank.  “Is this your note?” asked the shopkeeper, showing it to the young man.  “It is.”  “I must have made a mistake,” faltered the clerk.  “I shall not give you a chance to make such another mistake in my employ,” said the merchant sternly. “You may go up to the desk and ask for what wages are due you. I shall have no further occasion for your services.”  “Now, youngster,” said Dick’s patron, as they went out of the store, after he had finally got the bill changed. “I must pay you something extra for your trouble. Here’s fifty cents.”  “Thank you, sir,” said Dick. “You’re very kind. Don’t you want some more bills changed?”  “Not to-day,” said he with a smile. “It’s too expensive.”  “I’m in luck,” thought our hero complacently. “I guess I’ll go to Barnum’s to-night, and see the bearded lady, the eight-foot giant, the two-foot dwarf, and the other curiosities, too numerous to mention.”  Dick shouldered his box and walked up as far as the Astor House. He took his station on the sidewalk, and began to look about him.  Just behind him were two persons,—one, a gentleman of fifty; the other, a boy of thirteen or fourteen. They were speaking together, and Dick had no difficulty in hearing what was said.  “I am sorry, Frank, that I can’t go about, and show you some of the sights of New York, but I shall be full of business to-day. It is your first visit to the city, too.”  “Yes, sir.”  “There’s a good deal worth seeing here. But I’m afraid you’ll have to wait to next time. You can go out and walk by yourself, but don’t venture too far, or you will get lost.”  Frank looked disappointed.  “I wish Tom Miles knew I was here,” he said. “He would go around with me.”  “Where does he live?”  “Somewhere up town, I believe.”  “Then, unfortunately, he is not available. If you would rather go with me than stay here, you can, but as I shall be most of the time in merchants’-counting-rooms, I am afraid it would not be very interesting.”  “I think,” said Frank, after a little hesitation, “that I will go off by myself. I won’t go very far, and if I lose my way, I will inquire for the Astor House.”  “Yes, anybody will direct you here. Very well, Frank, I am sorry I can’t do better for you.”  “Oh, never mind, uncle, I shall be amused in walking around, and looking at the shop-windows. There will be a great deal to see.”  Now Dick had listened to all this conversation. Being an enterprising young man, he thought he saw a chance for a speculation, and determined to avail himself of it.  Accordingly he stepped up to the two just as Frank’s uncle was about leaving, and said, “I know all about the city, sir; I’ll show him around, if you want me to.”  The gentleman looked a little curiously at the ragged figure before him.  “So you are a city boy, are you?”  “Yes, sir,” said Dick, “I’ve lived here ever since I was a baby.”  “And you know all about the public buildings, I suppose?”  “Yes, sir.”  “And the Central Park?”  “Yes, sir. I know my way all round.”  The gentleman looked thoughtful.  “I don’t know what to say, Frank,” he remarked after a while. “It is rather a novel proposal. He isn’t exactly the sort of guide I would have picked out for you. Still he looks honest. He has an open face, and I think can be depended upon.”  “I wish he wasn’t so ragged and dirty,” said Frank, who felt a little shy about being seen with such a companion.  “I’m afraid you haven’t washed your face this morning,” said Mr. Whitney, for that was the gentleman’s name.  “They didn’t have no wash-bowls at the hotel where I stopped,” said Dick.  “What hotel did you stop at?”  “The Box Hotel.”  “The Box Hotel?”  “Yes, sir, I slept in a box on Spruce Street.”  Frank surveyed Dick curiously.  “How did you like it?” he asked.  “I slept bully.”  “Suppose it had rained.”  “Then I’d have wet my best clothes,” said Dick.  “Are these all the clothes you have?”  “Yes, sir.”  Mr. Whitney spoke a few words to Frank, who seemed pleased with the suggestion.  “Follow me, my lad,” he said.  Dick in some surprise obeyed orders, following Mr. Whitney and Frank into the hotel, past the office, to the foot of the staircase. Here a servant of the hotel stopped Dick, but Mr. Whitney explained that he had something for him to do, and he was allowed to proceed.  They entered a long entry, and finally paused before a door. This being opened a pleasant chamber was disclosed.  “Come in, my lad,” said Mr. Whitney.  Dick and Frank entered.     CHAPTER IV. DICK’S NEW SUIT   “Now,” said Mr. Whitney to Dick, “my nephew here is on his way to a boarding-school. He has a suit of clothes in his trunk about half worn. He is willing to give them to you. I think they will look better than those you have on.”  Dick was so astonished that he hardly knew what to say. Presents were something that he knew very little about, never having received any to his knowledge. That so large a gift should be made to him by a stranger seemed very wonderful.  The clothes were brought out, and turned out to be a neat gray suit.  “Before you put them on, my lad, you must"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/53480"],["title","The Leardo Map of the World, 1452 or 1453 (#1)"],["body","are indicated opposite the days of the month (fourth circle) on which Sunday falls in the years designated by the seven first letters of the alphabet. If we know the dominical letter for any particular year, we may thus determine the days of the week.[12] Leardo, however, does not specify the years to which the dominical letters in his calendar refer.  The eighth and ninth circles give the lengths of the days in hours and minutes.[13] From this we see that the vernal equinox fell on March 11, inasmuch as the calendar was constructed before the Gregorian reform. Finally, in the tenth circle saints’ days and other religious festivals are shown.[14]  The four figures in the spaces between the calendar and the outer edge of the parchment represent the four evangelists: the lion for St. Mark, the bull for St. Luke, the angel for St. Matthew, and the eagle (of which only the head shows) for St. John.[15]                                 The Map Disk  It should be noted first that east is at the top of the map and Jerusalem at the center; hence the long axis of the Mediterranean runs vertically up the southern half of the disk.  With the exception of the Red Sea, appropriately colored, the seas are uniformly blue. The lands are left the natural color of the bleached parchment except for a fiery red region in the far south bearing the legend: “Desert uninhabited because of heat,” and a dreary brown waste in the far north marked: “Desert uninhabited because of cold.” Islands are tinted either red or yellow, with green patches in the interior of Great Britain and Ireland. The only other natural features depicted are mountains, rivers, and lakes, although certain deserts are mentioned in legends. Mountain ranges are represented by rows of mounds, alternately red, green, and blue, and each rising symmetrically in two or three steps. Rivers are blue and, as frequently on medieval maps, sometimes connect one sea with another, or at least have common sources. A yellow lake, labeled “Sandy Sea,” lies in the midst of the Sahara.  Vignettes of castles, walled towns, and churches stand for cities, kingdoms, and regions. In most cases the names have been written upon the vignettes themselves; since the latter are also colored pink or green, the letters are frequently obscured and quite illegible. Many towns and districts are shown by red dots beside which the names are written in ink, once black but now faded with age. These names were inserted after the vignettes were drawn, for in many instances they are tilted or compressed to fit the available space. The draftsman did not venture to write any name to the left of the dot to which it belongs; as he could not write on the blue of the seas, he was obliged to invert the map in the case of places on south-facing coasts. Names of islands and seas, which had to be written on water surfaces, are inclosed in small yellow panels. The names of the continents, the two inscriptions relating to the polar and equatorial deserts, and the words “Terrestrial Paradise” are in red capitals; but all other names are in minuscule, usually without an initial capital. Besides place names there are a few longer legends.  Winds blowing from the four cardinal and four intermediate points of the compass are shown by eight faces around the edge of the disk. Those to the north, northwest, and northeast are blue, suggesting cold blasts from these quarters; the other faces are ruddy.  Although decorative, the Leardo map lacks many of the pictorial elements—animals, birds, preposterous monsters—that enliven the blank spaces on other medieval maps. With the exception of the eight wind faces and the symbolic figures of the evangelists no living creatures, whether animals or men, are graphically represented.                        Sources of Leardo’s Geography  Briefly stated, the sources of Leardo’s geography are to be sought in the information accumulated by the Greeks and Romans, as added to and altered during the early Middle Ages by the Church Fathers on the basis of the interpretation of the Bible and as later augmented by the work of medieval travelers, merchants, and sailors.  At a very early period the Greeks developed the idea (borrowed, perhaps, from the Babylonians[16]) that the earth is a flat disk surrounded by the Ocean Stream. This conception seems to have given rise to a cartographic tradition followed by certain ancient and medieval map-makers who had long outgrown the belief that the earth is actually flat. Thus Leardo draws a circular land mass, or _oikoumene_, surrounded by a narrow hem of water. We cannot, however, question his belief in the sphericity of the earth, for otherwise he could hardly have held the views expressed in the panel below the calendar. Furthermore, his two legends relating to the fiery and frozen deserts echo a theory that was propounded in classical times and based on the hypothesis of a spherical earth. This theory, worked out in detail by Crates of Mallos, is briefly as follows.[17] Around the equatorial circumference of the globe is a fiery zone so intensely hot that no man can cross it. This zone cuts off all communication with the southern hemisphere. The north and south polar caps are uninhabitable because of the cold. An ocean encircling the globe from north to south intercepts communication with the half of the northern hemisphere opposite the _oikoumene_. Many maps were made in the Middle Ages to illustrate this conception. Leardo presumably had it in mind and did not intend to represent either a flat disk or a complete hemisphere but merely a circular portion of the earth’s surface lying north of the equator.  In its orientation, with east and the Terrestrial Paradise at the top and with Jerusalem at the center, the map follows the Christian tradition of the earlier Middle Ages. Other features reflecting the influence of the Scriptures are Noah’s Ark resting on top of Mt. Ararat, Mt. Sinai, the exaggerated length of the River Jordan, and an inscription in the far northeast referring to Gog and Magog.  Later medieval contacts between Europe and remote lands are revealed in names derived from Marco Polo and possibly from other Western travelers who had visited the Orient, as well as in the Arabic names in Asia and Africa.  Medieval navigators’ charts also influenced Leardo. Towards the close of the thirteenth century sailors in the Mediterranean—particularly Italians and Catalans—began making marine maps (known as portolan charts) that far surpassed all earlier maps in the accurate delineation of coast lines. The majority of these show the Mediterranean and Atlantic coasts of Europe and of north Africa but little of the interior of the continents and nothing of the farther parts of Asia. Some, however, were used as the basis for maps of the world. On the latter the shore lines were derived from the navigators’ charts, and the remaining regions were compiled from other sources. The Leardo map belongs in this category.  Among the existing maps dating from the fourteenth and early fifteenth centuries our Leardo map is very closely related to the group of maps drawn by the famous Catalan cartographers of Majorca in the Balearic Islands. In its general outlines it is so strikingly like a Catalan map of about 1450 now preserved in the Este Library at Modena[18] that we must assume a common cartographic ancestor at no great distance back. There are, however, certain legends on the Este map that Leardo does not give, particularly the long inscriptions and a multitude of place names on the Mediterranean and Atlantic coasts. Leardo’s map, on the other hand, has features not shown on the Este map. These are of two sorts: (1) place names in Asia and Africa, the counterparts of which may be found on other Catalan[19] and Italian[20] maps of the period; and (2) river, mountain, and province names taken directly from Ptolemy. There are also not a few names whose origins or counterparts on other maps I have been unable to trace.  Ptolemy’s _Geography_ had been neglected during the earlier Middle Ages, but the enthusiastic interest in Greek literature which characterized the early Renaissance had led to its translation into Latin shortly before Leardo’s time.[21] A strict interpretation of Ptolemy’s data would have necessitated a complete redrafting of the outlines of the continents, as was done on the Ptolemaic atlases of the mid- and late fifteenth century. Leardo made no such attempt. The extent of his concession to the Ptolemaic geography was to sprinkle a few of Ptolemy’s names over a medieval base and to add the Rivers Indus and Oechardes in eastern Asia.[22]                     The Known World According to Leardo   The numbers in parentheses correspond to the reference numbers in the     Appendix (pp. 32-60) and on the key maps at the end of the book.  In the Appendix (pp. 31-67) I have tried to identify as many as possible of the names and other features shown on the Leardo map with existing places, or at least with corresponding features on other maps of the period. Here I propose to conduct the reader on a rapid sight-seeing tour around the map, pointing out some of the most interesting details only.                                     Asia  In the extreme north (left-hand side) there is a large structure which looks like an Italian church with its campanile (13). The legend beneath, suggested ultimately by a passage from Marco Polo, runs about thus: “[This is] the sepulcher of the [Grand Khan] and they do this when he comes to be carried for interment: he comes accompanied by many armed men who kill those whom they find on the roads, and they say that the souls of these are blessed because they accompany the soul of the Grand Khan to another life.” Marco Polo adds that at the time of the funeral of Mangou Khan 20,000 persons were thus slain! The actual place of burial of the Mongol Khans was in Cathay, far away from northern Russia where Leardo, following the"]]]
