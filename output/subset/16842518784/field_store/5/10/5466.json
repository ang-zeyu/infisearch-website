Viewed from a distance, the immense city looked like a gigantic furnace. Thick clouds of smoke hovered over its towers, obscuring the light of the burning May sun.  By the time the king had reached the palace, the multitude who had come to take part in the festival had formed themselves into a procession of interminable length, which wandered on through the straight streets of Babylon towards the royal palace.  Their road was strewn with myrtle and palm-branches, roses, poppy and oleander-blossoms, and with leaves of the silver poplar, palm and laurel; the air perfumed with incense, myrrh, and a thousand other sweet odors. Carpets and flags waved and fluttered from the houses.  Music too was there; the shrill peal of the Median trumpet, and soft tone of the Phrygian flute; the Jewish cymbal and harp, Paphlagonian tambourines and the stringed instruments of Ionia; Syrian kettle-drums and cymbals, the shells and drums of the Arians from the mouth of the Indus, and the loud notes of the Bactrian battle-trumpets.  But above all these resounded the rejoicing shouts of the Babylonian multitude, subjugated by the Persians only a few short years before, and yet, like all Asiatics, wearing their fetters with an air of gladness so long as the fear of their tyrant was before their eyes.  The fragrant odors, the blaze of color and sparkling of gold and jewels, the neighing of the horses, and shouts and songs of human beings, all united to produce a whole, at once bewildering and intoxicating to the senses and the feelings.  The messengers had not been sent up to Babylon empty-handed.  Beautiful horses, huge elephants and comical monkeys; rhinoceroses and buffaloes adorned with housings and tassels; double-humped Bactrian camels with gold collars on their shaggy necks; waggon-loads of rare woods and ivory, woven goods of exquisite texture, casks of ingots and gold-dust, gold and silver vessels, rare plants for the royal gardens, and foreign animals for the preserves, the most remarkable of which were antelopes, zebras, and rare monkeys and birds, these last being tethered to a tree in full leaf and fluttering among the branches.  Such were the offerings sent to the great king of Persia.  They were the tribute of the conquered nations and, after having been shown to the king, were weighed and tested by treasurers and secretaries, either declared satisfactory, or found wanting and returned, in which case the niggardly givers were condemned to bring a double tribute later.       [At the time of which we are writing, the kings of Persia taxed      their kingdom at whatever time and to whatever extent seemed good in      their own eyes.  Cambyses' successor, Darius, was the first to      introduce a regular system of taxation, in consequence of which he      was nicknamed \"the shopkeeper.\"  Up to a much later period it still      remained the duty of certain districts to send natural products to      the court  Herod. I.  192.  Xenoph.  Anab. IV. 5.]  The palace-gates were reached without hindrance, the way being kept clear by lines of soldiers and whipbearers stationed on either side of the street.  If the royal progress to the place of sacrifice, when five hundred richly-caprisoned horses had been led behind the king's chariot, could be called magnificent, and the march of the envoys a brilliant spectacle, the great throne-room presented a vision of dazzling and magic beauty.  In the background, raised on six steps, each of which was guarded, as it were, by two golden clogs, stood the throne of gold; above it, supported by four golden pillars studded with precious stones, was a purple canopy, on which appeared two winged discs, the king's Feruer.       [The Feruer or Ferwer is the spiritual part of every man-his soul      and reason.  It was in existence before the man was horn, joins him      at his birth and departs at his death.  The Ferwer keeps up a war      with the Diws or evil spirits, and is the element of man's      preservation in life.  The moment he departs, the body returns to      its original elements.  After death he becomes immortal if he has      done well, but if his deeds have been evil he is cast into hell.  It      is right to call upon the Ferwer and entreat his help.  He will      bring the prayer before God and on this account is represented as a      winged disc.]  Fan-bearers, high in office at the court, stood behind the throne, and, on either side, those who sat at the king's table, his relations and friends, and the most important among the officers of state, the priestly caste and the eunuchs.  The walls and ceiling of the entire hall were covered with plates of burnished gold, and the floor with purple carpets.  Before the silver gates lay winged bulls, and the king's body-guard-their dress consisting of a gold cuirass under a purple overcoat, and the high Persian cap, their swords in golden scabbards glittering with jewels, and their lances ornamented with gold and silver apples, were stationed in the court of the palace.  Among them the band of the \"Immortals\" was easily to be distinguished by their stately forms and dauntless bearing.  Officers, whose duty consisted in announcing and presenting strangers, and who carried short ivory staves, led the deputies into the hall, and up to the throne, where they cast themselves on the ground as though they would kiss the earth, concealing their hands in the sleeves of their robes.  A cloth was bound over the mouth of every man before he was allowed to answer the king's questions, lest the pure person of the king should be polluted by the breath of common men.  Cambyses' severity or mildness towards the deputations with whose chiefs he spoke, was proportioned to the obedience of their province and the munificence of their tribute-offerings.  Near the end of the train appeared an embassy from the Jews, led by two grave men with sharply-cut features and long beards.  Cambyses called on them in a friendly tone to stop.  The first of these men was dressed in the fashion of the Babylonian aristocracy.  The other wore a purple robe woven without seam, trimmed with bells and tassels, and held in at the waist by a girdle of blue, red and white.  A blue garment was thrown over his shoulders and a little bag suspended around his neck containing the sacred lots, the Urim and Thummin, adorned with twelve precious stones set in gold, and bearing the names of the tribes of Israel.  The high-priest's brow was grave and thoughtful.  A white cloth was wound round his head, the ends of which hung down to the shoulders.  \"I rejoice to behold you once more, Belteshazzar,\" exclaimed the king to the former of the two men.  \"Since the death of my father you have not been seen at my gate.\"  The man thus addressed bowed humbly and answered: \"The favor of the king rejoices his servant!  If it seem good unto thee, to cause the sun of thy favor to shine on me, thine unworthy servant, so hearken unto my petition for my nation, which thy great father caused to return unto the land of their fathers' sepulchres.  This old man at my side, Joshua, the high- priest of our God, hath not feared the long journey to Babylon, that he might bring his request before thy face.  Let his speech be pleasing in thine ears and his words bring forth fruit in thine heart.\"  \"I foresee what ye desire of me,\" cried the king.  \"Am I wrong, priest, in supposing that your petition refers to the building of the temple in your native land?\"  \"Nothing can be hidden from the eyes of my lord,\" answered the priest, bowing low.  \"Thy servants in Jerusalem desire to behold the face of their ruler, and beseech thee by my mouth to visit the land of their fathers, and to grant them permission to set forward the work of the temple, concerning which thine illustrious father (the favor of our God rest upon him), made a decree.\"  The king answered with a smile: \"You have the craft of your nation, and understand how to choose the right time and words for your petition.  On my birthday it is difficult for me to refuse my faithful people even one request.  I promise you, therefore, so soon as possible to visit Jerusalem and the land of your fathers.\"  \"By so doing thou wilt make glad the hearts of thy servants,\" answered the priest; \"our vines and olives will bear more fruit at thine approach, our gates will lift up their heads to receive thee, and Israel rejoice with shouts to meet his lord doubly blessed if as lord of the building--\"  \"Enough, priest, enough!\"  cried Cambyses.  \"Your first petition, I have said it, shall not remain unfulfilled; for I have long desired to visit the wealthy city of Tyre, the golden Sidon, and Jerusalem with its strange superstitions; but were I to give permission for the building now, what would remain for me to grant you in the coming year?\"  \"Thy servants will no more molest thee by their petitions, if thou grant unto them this one, to finish the temple of the Lord their God,\" answered the priest.  \"Strange beings, these men of Palestine!\"  exclaimed Cambyses.  \"I have heard it said that ye believe in one God alone, who can be represented by no likeness, and is a spirit.  Think ye then that this omnipresent Being requires a house?  Verily, your great spirit can be but a weak and miserable creature, if he need a covering from the wind and rain, and a shelter from the heat which he himself has created.  If your God be like ours, omnipresent, fall down before him and worship as we do, in every place, and feel certain that everywhere ye will be heard of him!\"  \"The God of Israel hears his people in every place,\" exclaimed the high- priest.  \"He heard us when we pined in captivity under the Pharaohs far from our land; he heard us weeping by the rivers of Babylon.  He chose thy father to be the instrument of our deliverance, and will hear my prayer this day and soften thine heart like wise."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5455"],["title","An Egyptian Princess — Volume 06 (#1)"],["body","and saying: \"You need say no more, brother; do what your heart bids you.  I know the power of love too, and I will help you to gain our mother's consent.\" Bartja threw himself at his brother's feet, overcome with gratitude and joy, but Cambyses raised him kindly and, looking especially at Nitetis and Kassandane, exclaimed: \"Listen, my dear ones, the stem of Cyrus is going to blossom afresh, for our brother Bartja has resolved to put an end to his single life, so displeasing to the gods.       [The Persians were commanded by their religion to marry, and the      unmarried were held up to ridicule.  Vendid.  IV.  Fargard.  130.      The highest duty of man was to create and promote life, and to have      many children was therefore considered praiseworthy.  Herod.  I.      136.]  In a few days the young lover will leave us for your country, Nitetis, and will bring back another jewel from the shores of the Nile to our mountain home.\"  \"What is the matter, sister?\"  cried Atossa, before her brother had finished speaking.  Nitetis had fainted, and Atossa was sprinkling her forehead with wine as she lay in her arms.  \"What was it?\"  asked the blind Kassandane, when Nitetis had awakened to consciousness a few moments later.  \"The joy--the happiness--Tachot,\" faltered Nitetis.  Cambyses, as well as his sister, had sprung to the fainting girl's help.  When she had recovered consciousness, he asked her to take some wine to revive her completely, gave her the cup with his own hand, and then went on at the point at which he had left off in his account: \"Bartja is going to your own country, my wife--to Naukratis on the Nile--to fetch thence the granddaughter of a certain Rhodopis, and daughter of a noble warrior, a native of the brave town of Phocaea, as his wife.\"  \"What was that?\"  cried the blind queen-mother.  \"What is the matter with you?\"  exclaimed Atossa again, in an anxious, almost reproachful tone.  \"Nitetis!\"  cried Croesus admonishingly.  But the warning came too late; the cup which her royal lover had given her slipped from her hands and fell ringing on the floor.  All eyes were fixed on the king's features in anxious suspense.  He had sprung from his seat pale as death; his lips trembled and his fist was clenched.  Nitetis looked up at her lover imploringly, but he was afraid of meeting those wonderful, fascinating eyes, and turned his head away, saying in a hoarse voice: \"Take the women back to their apartments, Boges.  I have seen enough of them--let us begin our drinking-bout--good-night, my mother; take care how you nourish vipers with your heart's blood.  Sleep well, Egyptian, and pray to the gods to give you a more equal power of dissembling your feelings.  To- morrow, my friends, we will go out hunting.  Here, cup-bearer, give me some wine! fill the large goblet, but taste it well--yes, well--for to- day I am afraid of poison; to-day for the first time.  Do you hear, Egyptian?  I am afraid of poison!  and every child knows--ah-ha--that all the poison, as well as the medicine comes from Egypt.\"  Nitetis left the hall,--she hardly knew how,--more staggering than walking.  Boges accompanied her, telling the bearers to make haste.  When they reached the hanging-gardens he gave her up to the care of the eunuch in attendance, and took his leave, not respectfully as usual, but chuckling, rubbing his hands, and speaking in an intimate and confidential tone: \"Dream about the handsome Bartja and his Egyptian lady-love, my white Nile-kitten!  Haven't you any message for the beautiful boy, whose love-story frightened you so terribly?  Think a little.  Poor Boges will very gladly play the go-between; the poor despised Boges wishes you so well--the humble Boges will be so sorry when he sees the proud palm-tree from Sais cut down.  Boges is a prophet; he foretells you a speedy return home to Egypt, or a quiet bed in the black earth in Babylon, and the kind Boges wishes you a peaceful sleep. Farewell, my broken flower, my gay, bright viper, wounded by its own sting, my pretty fir-cone, fallen from the tall pine-tree!\"  \"How dare you speak in this impudent manner?\" said the indignant princess.  \"Thank you,\" answered the wretch, smiling.  \"I shall complain of your conduct,\" threatened Nitetis.  \"You are very amiable,\" answered Boges.  \"Go out of my sight,\" she cried.  \"I will obey your kind and gentle hints;\" he answered softly, as if whispering words of love into her ear.  She started back in disgust and fear at these scornful words; she saw how full of terror they were for her, turned her back on him and went quickly into the house, but his voice rang after her: \"Don't forget my lovely queen, think of me now and then; for everything that happens in the next few days will be a keepsake from the poor despised Boges.\"  As soon as she had disappeared he changed his tone, and commanded the sentries in the severest and most tyrannical manner, to keep a strict watch over the hanging-gardens.  \"Certain death,\" said he, \"to whichever of you allows any one but myself to enter these gardens.  No one, remember--no one--and least of all messengers from the queen-mother, Atossa or any of the great people, may venture to set foot on these steps.  If Croesus or Oropastes should wish to speak to the Egyptian Princess, refuse them decidedly.  Do you understand?  I repeat it, whoever is begged or bribed into disobedience will not see the light of to-morrow's sun.  Nobody may enter these gardens without express permission from my own mouth.  I think you know me.  Here, take these gold staters, your work will be heavier now; but remember, I swear by Plithras not to spare one of you who is careless or disobedient.\"  The men made a due obeisance and determined to obey; they knew that Boges' threats were never meant in joke, and fancied something great must be coming to pass, as the stingy eunuch never spent his staters without good reason.  Boges was carried back to the banqueting-hall in the same litter, which had brought Nitetis away.  The king's wives had left, but the concubines were all standing in their appointed place, singing their monotonous songs, though quite unheard by the uproarious men.  The drinkers had already long forgotten the fainting woman.  The uproar and confusion rose with every fresh wine-cup.  They forgot the dignity of the place where they were assembled, and the presence of their mighty ruler.  They shouted in their drunken joy; warriors embraced one another with a tenderness only excited by wine, here and there a novice was carried away in the arms of a pair of sturdy attendants, while an old hand at the work would seize a wine-jug instead of a goblet, and drain it at a draught amid the cheers of the lookers-on.  The king sat on at the head of the table, pale as death, staring into the wine-cup as if unconscious of what was going on around hint.  But at the sight of his brother his fist clenched.  He would neither speak to him, nor answer his questions.  The longer he sat there gazing into vacancy, the firmer became his conviction that Nitetis had deceived him,--that she had pretended to love him while her heart really belonged to Bartja.  How shamefully they had made sport of him!  How deeply rooted must have been the faithlessness of this clever hypocrite, if the mere news that his brother loved some one else could not only destroy all her powers of dissimulation, but actually deprive her of consciousness!  When Nitetis left the hall, Otanes, the father of Phaedime had called out: \"The Egyptian women seem to take great interest in the love-affairs of their brothers-in-law.  The Persian women are not so generous with their feelings; they keep them for their husbands.\"  Cambyses was too proud to let it be seen that he had heard these words; like the ostrich, he feigned deafness and blindness in order not to seem aware of the looks and murmurs of his guests, which all went to prove that he had been deceived.  Bartja could have had no share in her perfidy; she had loved this handsome youth, and perhaps all the more because she had not been able to hope for a return of her love.  If he had had the slightest suspicion of his brother, he would have killed him on the spot.  Bartja was certainly innocent of any share in the deception and in his brother's misery, but still he was the cause of all; so the old grudge, which had only just been allowed to slumber, woke again; and, as a relapse is always more dangerous than the original illness, the newly-roused anger was more violent than what he had formerly felt.  He thought and thought, but he could not devise a fitting punishment for this false woman.  Her death would not content his vengeance, she must suffer something worse than mere death!  Should he send her back to Egypt, disgraced and shamed?  Oh, no!  she loved her country, and she would be received by her parents with open arms.  Should he, after she had confessed her guilt, (for he was determined to force a confession from her) shut her up in a solitary dungeon?  or should he deliver her over to Boges, to be the servant of his concubines?  Yes! now he had hit upon the right punishment.  Thus the faithless creature should be disciplined, and the hypocrite, who had dared to make sport of him--the All-powerful--forced to atone for her crimes.  Then he said to himself: \"Bartja must not stay here; fire and water have more in common than we two--he always fortunate and happy, and I so miserable.  Some day or other his descendants will divide my treasures, and wear my crown; but as yet I am king, and I will show that I am.\"  The thought of his proud, powerful position flashed through him like lightning.  He woke from his dreams into new life, flung his golden goblet far into the hall, so that the wine flew round like rain, and cried: \"We have had enough of this idle talk and useless noise.  Let us hold a council of war, drunken as we are, and consider what answer we ought to give the Massagetae.  Hystaspes, you "]]]
