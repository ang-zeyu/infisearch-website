General Drak turned back to the reports on his desk, trying again to puzzle out what had happened at Allani. Repulsed Us? Us Repulsed? How should it read?  \"Oh, well,\" Drak said resignedly. \"In the long run, I don't suppose it really makes much difference.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Miles away, in no man's land, stood a bunker of reinforced concrete and steel. Within the bunker were two men. They sat on opposite sides of a plain wooden table and their faces were stern and impassive. Beside each man was a pad and pencil. Upon each pad were marks.  Upon the table between them was a coin.  \"Your toss,\" said the man on the right.  The man on the left picked up the coin. \"Call it.\"  \"Heads.\"  It came up heads.  \"Damn,\" said the flipper, passing the coin across the table and standing up.  The other man smiled faintly, but said nothing.         *       *       *       *       *  Kelly reached for the kissoff switch, then hesitated. \"Look, Igor,\" he said, \"do we have to come out now, without charts? It gets risky, you know. How can we tell what's out there in normal space?\"  \"It is a risk we have to take,\" Beliakoff said stonily.  \"But why? What's wrong with the people of Mala having those books? Believe me, there's nothing dirty in them.\"  \"Look,\" Beliakoff said patiently, \"you know that Mala is a semi-restricted planet. Limited trading is allowed under control conditions. No articles are allowed on the planet except those on the approved list.\"  \"Yeah,\" Kelly said vaguely. \"Silly sort of rule.\"  \"Not at all. Mala is a mirror culture. They consider Earth and its ways to be absolute perfection. They copy everything of Earth's they can find.\"  \"Seems like a good idea. We _have_ got a real good culture.\"  \"Sure, but we developed into it. The Malans simply copy what they see, with no underlying tradition or rationale. Since they don't know why they're doing any particular thing, they can easily misinterpret it, warp it into something harmful.\"  \"They'll learn,\" Kelly said.  \"Of course they will. But in the meantime, the results can be devastating. They always are when a primitive race tries to ape the culture of a more advanced people. Look at what happened to the South Sea Islanders. All they picked up was the worst of French, British and American culture. You hardly see any more South Sea Islanders, do you? Same with the American Indians, with the Hottentots, and plenty of others.\"  \"I still think you're making too much of a fuss about it,\" Kelly said. \"All right, I gave them a lot of books on warfare and political organization. So what? What in blazes can they do with them?\"  \"The Malans,\" Beliakoff said grimly, \"have never had a war.\"  Kelly gulped. \"Never?\"  \"Never. They're a completely cooperative society. Or were, before they started reading those warfare books.\"  \"But they wouldn't start a war just because they've got some books on it, and know that Earth people do it, and--yeah, I guess they would.\" Quickly he set the dials. \"You're right, buddy. We have an absolute moral obligation to return and straighten out that mess.\"  \"I knew you'd see it that way,\" Beliakoff said approvingly. \"And there is the additional fact that the Galactic Council could hold us responsible for any deaths traceable to the books. It could mean Ran-hachi Prison for a hundred years or so.\"  \"Why didn't you say that in the first place?\" Kelly flipped the kissoff switch. The ship came out in normal space. Fortunately, there was no sun or planet in its path.  \"Hang on,\" Kelly said, \"we're going where we're going in a great big rush!\"  \"I just hope we'll be in time to salvage something,\" Beliakoff said, watching as their freighter plowed its way through the sea of space toward the unchanging stars.         *       *       *       *       *  With evident nervousness, Nob walked down a long, dim corridor toward the imperial chambers, carrying a small package in both hands. The Prime Minister of the Dictatorship was a small bald man with a great bulging forehead and small, glittering black eyes, made smaller by steel-rimmed spectacles. He looked the very incarnation of an evil genius, which was why he had been chosen as the Power Behind the Throne.  In point of fact, however, Nob was a mild, near-sighted, well-meaning little man, a lawyer by occupation, known throughout Mala for his prize rose gardens and his collection of Earth stamps. In spite of a temperamental handicap, he didn't find his new job too difficult. The Earth books were there and Nob simply interpreted them as literally as possible. Whenever a problem came up, Nob thought: how would they solve it on Earth? Then he would do the same, or as near the same as possible.  But dealing with the Empress presented problems of a unique nature. Nob couldn't find a book entitled _Ways and Means of Placating Royalty_. If such a book were obtainable, Nob would have paid any price for it.  He took a deep breath, knocked and opened the door into the Royal Chambers.  Instantly he ducked. A vase shattered against the wall behind him. Not so good, he thought, calculating the distance by which it had missed him. The Empress Jusa's aim was improving.  \"Nob, you dirty swine!\" the Empress shrieked.  \"At your service, Majesty,\" Nob answered, bowing low.  \"Where are the pearls, you insolent dolt?\"  \"Here, Majesty,\" Nob said, handing over the package. \"It strained the exchequer, buying them for you. The Minister of the Treasury threatened to desert to the enemy. He may still. The people are muttering about extravagance in high places. But the pearls are yours, Majesty.\"  \"Of course.\" Jusa opened the package and looked at the lustrous gems. \"Can I keep them?\" she asked, in a very small voice.  \"Of course not.\"  \"I didn't think so,\" Jusa said sadly. She had been just another Malan girl, but had been chosen as Empress on the basis of her looks, which were heartbreakingly lovely. It was axiomatic that an Empress should be heartbreakingly lovely. The Malans had seen enough Earth films to know that.  But an Empress should also be cold, calculating, cruel, as well as gracious, headstrong and generous to a fault. She should care nothing for her people, while, simultaneously, all she cared for was the people. She should act in a manner calculated to make her subjects love her in spite of and because of herself.         *       *       *       *       *  Jusa was a girl of considerable intelligence and she wanted to be as Earthly as the next. But the contradictions in her role baffled her.  \"Can't I keep them just for a little while?\" she pleaded, holding a single pearl up to the light.  \"It isn't possible,\" Nob said. \"We need guns, tanks, planes. Therefore you sell your jewelry. There are many Terran precedents.\"  \"But why did I have to insist upon the pearls in the first place?\" Jusa asked.  \"I explained! As Empress, you must be flighty, must possess a whim of iron, must have no regard for anyone else's feelings, must lust for expensive baubles.\"  \"All right,\" Jusa said.  \"All right, what?\"  \"All right, swine.\"  \"That's better,\" Nob said. \"You're learning, Jusa, you really are. If you could just fluctuate your moods more consistently--\"  \"I really will try,\" promised the Empress. \"I'll learn, Nob. You'll be proud of me yet.\"  \"Good. Now there are some problems of state which you must decide upon. Prisoners of war, for one thing. We have several possible means for disposing of them. First, we could--\"  \"You take care of it.\"  \"Now, now,\" Nob chided. \"Mustn't shirk your duty.\"  \"I'm not. I am simply being arbitrary and dictatorial. _You_ solve it, pig. And bring me diamonds.\"  \"Yes, Excellency,\" Nob said, bowing low. \"Diamonds. But the people--\"  \"I love the people. But to hell with them!\" she cried, fire in her eyes.  \"Fine, fine,\" Nob said, and bowed his way out of the room.  Jusa stood for a few moments in thought, then picked up a vase and shattered it on the floor. She made a mental note to order several dozen more.  Then she flung herself upon the royal couch and began to weep bitterly.  She was quite a young Empress and she had the feeling of being in beyond her depth. The problems of the war and of royalty had completely ended her social life.  She resented it; any girl would.         *       *       *       *       *  Nob, meanwhile, left the palace and went home in his armored car. The car had been ordered to protect him against assassins, who, according to the Earth books, aimed a good deal of their plots at Prime Ministers. Nob could see no reason for this, since if he weren't Prime Minister, any one of a thousand men could do the job with equal efficiency. But he supposed it had a certain symbolic meaning.  He reached his home and his wife kissed him on the cheek. \"Hard day at the palace, dear?\" she asked.  \"Quite hard,\" Nob said. \"Lots of work for after supper.\"  \"It just isn't fair,\" complained his wife. She was a plump, pleasant little person and she worried continually about her husband's health. \"They shouldn't make you work so hard.\"  \"But of course they should!\" said Nob, a little astonished. \"Don't you remember what I told you? All the books say that during a war, a Prime Minister is a harried, harassed individual, weighed down by the enormous burden of state, unable to relax, tense with the numerous strains of high office.\"  \"It isn't fair,\" his wife repeated.  \"No one said it was. But it's extremely Earthlike.\"  His wife shrugged her shoulders. \"Well, of course, if it's Earthlike, it must be right. Come eat supper, dear.\"         *       *       *       *       *  After eating, Nob attacked his mounds of paperwork. But soon he was yawning and his eyes burned. He turned to his wife, who was just finishing the dishes.  \"My dear,\" he said, \"do you suppose you could help me?\"  \"Is it proper?\" she asked.  \"Oh, absolutely. The books state"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/51449"],["title","Moral Equivalent (#2)"],["body"," the Prime Minister's wife tries in every way possible to relieve her husband of the burden of power.\"  \"In that case, I'll be happy to try.\" She sat down in front of the great pile of papers. \"But, dear, I don't know anything about these matters.\"  \"Rely on instinct,\" Nob answered, yawning. \"That's what I do.\"  Flattered by the importance of her task, she set to work with a will.  Several hours later, she awakened her husband, who was slumbering on the couch.  \"I've got them all finished except these,\" she said. \"In this one, I'm afraid I don't understand that word.\"  Nob glanced at the paper. \"Oh, propaganda. That means giving the people the facts, whether true or false. It's very important in any war.\"  \"I don't see why.\"  \"It's obvious. To have a genuine Earth-style war, you need ideological differences. That's why we chose a dictatorship and the other continent chose a democracy. The job of propaganda is to keep us different.\"  \"I see,\" she said dubiously. \"Well, this other paper is from General Heglm of Security. He asks what you are doing about the spy situation. He says it's very serious.\"  \"I had forgotten about that. He's right, it's reached a crisis point.\" He put the paper in his pocket. \"I'm going to take care of that personally, first thing in the morning.\"  In the last few hours, his wife had made no less than eight Major Policy Decisions, twenty Codifications, eight Unifications, and three Clarifications. Nob didn't bother to read them over. He trusted his wife's good judgment and common sense.  He went to bed that night with the feeling of a job well done. And before he fell asleep, he figured out exactly what he would do about the spy situation.         *       *       *       *       *  The next morning, Nob's orders went out by all means of communication. The results were gratifyingly swift, since the people of the dictatorship were completely behind the war and dutifully loved and hated their Empress, in whose name the order was signed.  A typical scene took place in the clubcar of the Char-Xil express. The occupants of the car, twenty-three commuting businessmen, sealed the doors as soon as they received Nob's order. The best-read among them, a salesman by the name of Thrang, was elected spokesman for the group.  \"Boys,\" said Thrang, \"I guess I don't have to tell you anything about the importance of this order. We all know what war is by now, don't we?\"  \"We sure do!\"  \"War is hell!\"  \"The war that the enemy thrust on us!\"  \"The war to start all wars!\"  \"That's right,\" Thrang said. \"And I guess we've all felt the pinch since the war started. Eh, boys?\"  \"I've done my part,\" said a man named Draxil. \"When the Prime Minister called for a cigarette shortage, I dumped twenty carloads of tobacco in the Hunto River. Now we got cigarette rationing!\"  \"That's the spirit,\" Thrang said. \"I know for a fact that others among you have done the same with sugar, canned goods, butter, meat and a hundred items. Everything's rationed now; everyone feels the pinch. But, boys, there's still more we have to do. Now a spy situation has come up and it calls for quick action.\"  \"Haven't we done enough?\" groaned a clothing-store owner.  \"It's never enough! In time of war, Earth people give till it hurts--then give some more! They know that no sacrifice is too much, that nothing counts but the proper prosecution of the war.\"  The clothing-store owner nodded vehemently. \"If it's Earthly, it's good enough for me. So what can we do about this spy situation?\"  \"That is for us to decide here and now,\" Thrang said. \"According to the Prime Minister, our dictatorship cannot boast a single act of espionage or sabotage done to it since the beginning of the war. The Chief of Security is alarmed. It's his job to keep all spies under surveillance. Since there are none, his department has lost all morale, which, in turn, affects the other departments.\"  \"Do we really need spies?\"  \"They serve a vital purpose,\" Thrang explained. \"All the books agree on this. Spies keep a country alert, on its toes, eternally vigilant. Through sabotage, they cut down on arms production, which otherwise would grow absurdly large, since it has priority over everything else. They supply Security with subjects for Interrogation, Confession, Brainwashing and Re-indoctrination. This in turn supplies data for the enemy propaganda machine, which in turn supplies material for our counter-propaganda machine.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Draxil looked awed. \"I didn't know it was so complicated.\"  \"That's the beauty of the Earth War,\" Thrang said. \"Stupendous yet delicate complications, completely interrelated. Leave out one seemingly unimportant detail and the whole structure collapses.\"  \"Those Terrans!\" Draxil said, shaking his head in admiration.  \"Now to work. Boys, I'm calling for volunteers. Who'll be a spy?\"  No one responded.  \"Really now!\" said Thrang. \"That's no attitude to take. Come on, some of you must be harboring treasonous thoughts. Don't be ashamed of it. Remember, it takes all kinds to make a war.\"  Little Herg, a zipper salesman from Xcoth, cleared his throat. \"I have a cousin who's Minister of War for the Allies.\"  \"An excellent motive for subversion!\" Thrang cried.  \"I rather thought it was,\" the zipper salesman said, pleased. \"Yes, I believe I can handle the job.\"  \"Splendid!\" Thrang said.  By then, the train had arrived at the station. The doors were unsealed, allowing the commuters to leave for their jobs. Thrang watched the zipper salesman depart, then hurried into the crowd. In a moment, he found a tall man wearing a slouch hat and dark glasses. On his lapel was a silver badge which read _Secret Police_.  \"See that man?\" Thrang asked, pointing to the zipper salesman.  \"You bet,\" the Secret Policeman said.  \"He's a spy! A dirty spy! Quick, after him!\"  \"He's being watched,\" said the Secret Policeman laconically.  \"I just wanted to make sure,\" Thrang said, and started to walk off.  He felt a heavy hand on his shoulder. He turned. The Secret Policeman had been joined by two tall men in slouch hats and dark glasses. They wore badges that said _Storm Troopers_.  \"You're under arrest,\" said the Secret Policeman.  \"Why? What have I done?\"  \"Not a thing, as far as we know,\" said a Storm Trooper. \"Not a single solitary thing. That's why we're arresting you.\"  \"Arbitrary police powers,\" the Secret Policeman explained. \"Suspension of search warrants and habeas corpus. Invasion of privacy. War, you know. Come along quietly, sir. You have a special and very important part to play in the war effort.\"  \"What's that?\"  \"You have been arbitrarily selected as Martyr,\" said the Secret Policeman.  Head held high, Thrang marched proudly to his destiny.         *       *       *       *       *  The whole of Mala took to war with a will. Soon books began to appear on the stalls: _War and You_ for the masses, _The Erotic Release of War_ for the elite, _The Inherent Will to Destroy_ for philosophers, and _War and Civilization_ for scholars. Volumes of personal experiences sold well. Among them was an account of daring sabotage by a former zipper salesman, and the dramatic story of the Martyrdom of Thrang.  War eliminated a thousand old institutions and unburdened the people of the heavy hand of tradition. War demonstrated clearly that everything was as temporary as a match-flash except Art and Man, because cities, buildings, parks, vehicles, hills, museums, monuments were as whispers of dust after the bombers had gone.  Among the proletariat, the prevailing opinion was voiced by Zun, who was quoted as saying at a war plant party, \"Well, there ain't nothin' in the stores I can buy. But I never made so much money in my life!\"  In the universities, professors boned up on the subject in order to fit themselves for Chairs of War that were sure to be endowed. All they had to do was wait until the recent crop of war profiteers were taxed into becoming philanthropists, or driven to it by the sense of guilt that the books assured them they would feel.  Armies grew. Soldiers learned to paint, salute, curse, appreciate home cooking, play poker, and fit themselves in every way for the post-war civilian life. They broadened themselves with travel and got a welcome vacation from home and hearth.  War, the Malans agreed, was certainly one of the cleverest of Earth institutions and as educational as it was entertaining.         *       *       *       *       *  \"Nope,\" Beliakoff was saying, \"you wouldn't like Ran-hachi Prison, not one little bit. It's on Mercury, you know, in the twilight zone. You blister by day and you freeze by night. Only two men have escaped from Ran-hachi in the last hundred years, and one of them figured his curve wrong and flipped into Sol.\"  \"What about the other one?\" Kelly asked, perspiring lightly.  \"His gyros fused. He was bound straight for the Coal Sack. Take him a couple of thousand years to get there, at his speed,\" Beliakoff finished dreamily. \"No, Johnny, you wouldn't like Ran-hachi.\"  \"Okay, okay,\" Kelly said. \"The death penalty would be better.\"  \"They give that only as a measure of extreme clemency,\" Beliakoff said with gloomy Slavic satisfaction.  \"Enough! We'll straighten out Mala.\" There was more hope than conviction in Kelly's voice. \"Thar she lies, off to starboard.\"  Mala was a tiny blue and brown sphere, suddenly growing larger in their screens.  Their radio blared on the emergency channel.  Kelly swore. \"That's the Galactic patrol boat from Azolith. What's he doing here?\"  \"Blockade,\" said Beliakoff. \"Standard practice to quarantine a planet at war. We can't touch down legally until the war's declared over.\"  \"Nuts. We're going down.\" Kelly touched the controls and the freighter began to descend into the interdicted area.  \"Attention, freighter!\" the radio blasted. \"This is the interdictory ship _Moth_. Heave to and identify yourself.\"  Beliakoff answered promptly in the Propendium language. \"Let's see 'em"]]]
