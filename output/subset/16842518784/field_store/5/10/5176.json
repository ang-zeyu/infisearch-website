Only now that we've eliminated famine, plague, and war, they'd breed beyond reason, breed till all the old evils came back to throttle them, if we didn't have strict population control._         *       *       *       *       *  \"Yeah,\" said her husband bitterly. \"They never even let my cousin have kids. Sterilized him damn near right after he was born.\"  _Then he's a moron, or carries hemophilia, or has some other hereditary taint_, I thought. _Can't they see we're doing it for their own good? It costs us fantastically in money and trouble, but the goal is a level of health and sanity such as this race never in its history dreamed possible._  \"They're stranglin' faith,\" muttered someone else.  _Anyone in the Empire may worship as he chooses, but should permission be granted to preach demonstrable falsehoods, archaic superstitions, or antisocial nonsense? The old \"free\" Earth was not noted for liberalism._  \"We want to be free.\"  _Free? Free for what? To loose the thousand Earthly races and creeds and nationalisms on each other--and on the Galaxy--to wallow in barbarism and slaughter and misery as before we came? To let our works and culture be thrown in the dust, the labor of a century be demolished, not because it is good or bad but simply because it is Valgolian? Epsilon Eridanian!_  \"We'll be free. Not too long to wait, either--\"  _That's up to nobody else but you!_  I couldn't get much specific information, but then I hadn't expected to. I collected my pay and drifted on eastward, talking to people of all classes--farmers, mechanics, shopowners, tramps, and such data as I gathered tallied with those of Intelligence.  About twenty-five per cent of the population, in North America at least--it was higher in the Orient and Africa--was satisfied with the Imperium, felt they were better off than they would have been in the old days. \"The Eridanians are pretty decent, on the whole. Some of 'em come in here and act nice and human as you please.\"  Some fifty per cent was vaguely dissatisfied, wanted \"freedom\" without troubling to define the term, didn't like the taxes or the labor draft or the enforced disarmament or the legal and social superiority of Valgolians or some such thing, had perhaps suffered in the reconquest. But this group constituted no real threat. It would tend to be passive whatever happened. Its greatest contribution would be sporadic rioting.  The remaining twenty-five per cent was bitter, waiting its chance, muttering of a day of revenge--and some portion of this segment was spreading propaganda, secretly manufacturing and distributing weapons, engaging in clandestine military drill, and maintaining contact with the shadowy Legion of Freedom.  Childish, melodramatic name! But it had been well chosen to appeal to a certain type of mind. The real, organized core of the anarch movement was highly efficient. In those months I spent wandering and waiting, its activities mounted almost daily.         *       *       *       *       *  The illegal radio carried unending programs, propaganda, fabricated stories of Valgolian brutality. I knew from personal experience that some were false, and I knew the whole Imperial system well enough to spot most of the rest at least partly invented. I realized we couldn't trace such a well-organized setup of mobile and coordinated units, and jamming would have been poor tactics, but even so--  _The day is coming.... Earthmen, free men, be ready to throw off your shackles.... Stand by for freedom!_  I stuck to my role. When autumn came, I drifted into one of the native cities, New Chicago, a warren of buildings near the remains of the old settlement, the same gigantic slum that its predecessor had been. I got a room in a cheap hotel and a job in a steel mill.  I was Conrad Haugen, Norwegian-American, assigned to a spaceship by the labor draft and liking it well enough to re-enlist when my term was up. I had wandered through much of the Empire and had had a great deal of contact with Eridanians, but was most emphatically not a Terrie. In fact, I thought it would be well if the redskin yoke could be thrown off, both because of liberty and the good pickings to be had in the Galaxy if the Empire should collapse. I had risen to second mate on an interstellar tramp, but could get no further because of the law that the two highest officers must be Valgolian. That had embittered me and I returned to Earth, foot-loose and looking for trouble.         *       *       *       *       *  I found it. With officer's training and the strength due to a home planet with a gravity half again that of Earth, I had no difficulty at all becoming a foreman. There was a big fellow named Mike Riley who thought he was entitled to the job. We settled it behind a shed, with the workmen looking on, and I beat him unconscious as fast as possible. The raw, sweating savagery of it made me feel ill inside. _They'd let_ this _loose among the stars_!  After that I was one of the boys and Riley was my best friend. We went out together, wenching and drinking, raising hell in the cold dirty canyons of steel and stone which the natives called streets. _Valgolia, Valgolia, the clean bare windswept heights of your mountains, soughing trees and thunderous waters and Maara waiting for me to come home!_ Riley often proposed that we find an Eridanian and beat him to death, and I would agree, hiccupping, because I knew they didn't go alone into native quarters any more. I sat in the smoky reek of the bars, half deafened by the clatter and raucousness called music, trying not to think of a certain low-ceilinged, quiet tavern amid the gardens of Kalariho, and sobbed the bitterness of Conrad Haugen into my beer.  \"Dirty redskins,\" I muttered. \"Dirty, stinking, bald-headed, sons of bitches. Them and their god-damn Empire. Why, y'know, if 't hadn' been f' their laws I'd be skipper o' my own ship now. I knew more'n that slob o' a captain. But he was born Eridanian--God, to get my hands on his throat!\"  Riley nodded. Through the haze of smoke I saw that his eyes were narrowed. He wasn't drunk when he didn't want to be, and at times like this he was suddenly as sober as I was, and that in spite of not having a Valgolian liver.  I bided my time, not too obviously anxious to contact the Legion. I just thought they were swell fellows, the only brave men left in the rotten, stinking Empire; I'd sure be on their side when the day came. I worked in the mill, and when out with the boys lamented the fact that we were really producing for the damned Eridanians, we couldn't even keep the products of our own sweat. I wasn't obtrusive about it, of course. Most of the time we were just boozing. But when the talk came to the Empire, I made it clear just where I stood.         *       *       *       *       *  The winter went. I continued the dreary round of days, wondering how long it would take, wondering how much time was left. If the Legion was at all interested, they would be checking my background right now. Let them. There wouldn't be much to check, but what there was had been carefully manufactured by the experts of the Intelligence Service.  Riley came into my room one evening. His face was tight, and he plunged to business. \"Con, do you really mean all you've said about the Empire?\"  \"Why, of course. I--\" I glanced out the window, as if expecting to see a spy. If there were any, I knew he would be native. The Empire just doesn't have enough men for a secret police, even if we wanted to indulge in that sort of historically ineffective control.  \"You'd like to fight them? Like really to help the Legion of Freedom when they strike?\"  \"You bet your obscenity life!\" I snarled. \"When they land on Earth, I'll get a gun somewhere and be right there in the middle of the battle with them!\"  \"Yeah.\" Riley puffed a cigaret for a while. Then he said, \"Look, I can't tell you much. I'm taking a chance just telling you this. It could mean my life if you passed it on to the Eridanians.\"  \"I won't.\"  His eyes were bleak. \"You damn well better not. If you're caught at that--\"  He drew a finger sharply across his throat.  \"Quit talking like a B-class stereo,\" I bristled. \"If you've got something to tell me, let's have it. Otherwise get out.\"  \"Yeah, sure. We checked up on you, Con, and we think you're as good a prospect as we ever came across. If you want to fight the Eridanians now--_join the Legion_ now--here's your chance.\"  \"My God, you know I do! But who--\"  \"I can't tell you a thing. But if you really want to join, memorize this.\" Riley gave me a small card on which was written a name and address. \"Destroy it, thoroughly. Then quit at the mill and drift to this other place, as if you'd gotten tired of your work and wanted to hit the road again. Take your time, don't make a beeline for it. When you do arrive, they'll take care of you.\"  I nodded, grimly. \"I'll do it, Mike. And thanks!\"  \"Just my job.\" He smiled, relaxing, and pulled a flask from his overcoat. \"Okay, Con, that's that. We'd better not go out to drink, after this, but nothing's to stop us from getting stinko here.\"   III  Spring had come and almost gone when I wandered into the little Maine town which was my destination. It lay out of the way, with forested hills behind it and the sea at its foot. Most of the houses were old, solidly built, almost like parts of the land, and the inhabitants were slow-spoken, steady folk, fishermen and artisans and the like, settled here and at home with the darkling woods and the restless sea and the high windy sky. I walked down a narrow street with a cool salt breeze ruffling my hair and decided that I liked Portsboro. It reminded me of my own home, twenty light-years away on the wide beaches of Kealvigh.  I made my way to Nat Hawkins' store and asked for work like any drifter. But when we were alone in the back room, I told him, \"I'm"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/51185"],["title","All Jackson's Children (#1)"],["body"," lost gem over the low mountains east of the plain. It washed the cliff with a cloak of effulgence and bathed the forbidden ship in an aura of gleaming silver.  Below the ledge, the reverent robots wavered occasionally and highlights of coruscation played capriciously across their plates. Their whispered invocations were a steady drone, like the soft touch of the wind.  \"Quit it!\" Drummond yelled angrily. \"Break it up! Go home!\"  Angus sat with his head against the cliff, face tilted up. \"That didn't help any.\"  \"When are they going to give up?\"  McIntosh glanced abstractedly at the horde. \"How long would we keep it up if _our_ God appeared among us?\"  Drummond swore. \"Damned if you haven't been reading the print off that Bible!\"  \"What do you suppose happened,\" Angus went on heedlessly, \"to make them more than clunkers--to make them grope for the basic truths?\"  Drummond spat disgustedly in answer.  \"Civilization goes on for a hundred years,\" Angus said as he leaned back and closed his eyes, \"spreading across a hunk of the Galaxy, carrying along its knowledge and religious convictions. And all the while, there's this little lost island of mimic beliefs--so much like our own creed, except that their god is called Jackson.\"  Drummond rose and paced. \"Well, you'll have plenty of time to set them straight, if we're still sitting on this shelf eleven hours from now.\"  \"Maybe that's what it'll take--bringing them step by step through theology.\"  \"Overnight?\"  No, not overnight, Angus realized. It would take months to pound in new convictions.  Drummond slipped down from the ledge. \"Here goes nothing.\"  Interestedly, Angus folded his arms and watched the other square his shoulders and march off confidently through the ranks of robots toward the ship in the distance.  For a moment, it seemed he would succeed. But two of the RAs suddenly reared erect and seized him by the arms. They bore him on their shoulders and deposited him back on the ridge beside McIntosh.  \"Warm tonight,\" Drummond observed bitterly, glancing up at the sky.  \"Sure is,\" Angus agreed, his voice calm. \"Wouldn't be surprised if we got some rain tomorrow.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Drummond flipped another pebble and it _pinged_ down on a metal back. \"Seven out of thirteen.\"  \"Getting good.\"  \"Look, let's tell 'em we're their Supervisor and end this marathon worship.\"  \"Which one of us is going to play the divine role?\"  \"What difference does it make?\"  Angus shrugged and his tired eyes stared off into the darkness. \"One of us is--Jackson. The other is an impostor, brought here to test their faith. When they find out which is which, what are they going to do to the impostor?\"  Drummond looked startled. \"I see what you mean.\"  The miniature moon had wheeled its way to the zenith and now the first gray tinge of dawn silhouetted the peaks of the mountain range.  Angus rose and stretched. \"We've got to find out what their function is.\"  \"Why?\"  \"It looks like religion is their only interest. But maybe that's because they're completely frustrated in their basic compulsion. If we could discover their function, maybe we could focus their attention back on it.\"  \"RA,\" Drummond mumbled puzzledly. \"Robot agriculturist?\"         *       *       *       *       *  Angus shook his head. \"They wouldn't be frustrated--not with a whole planet to farm. Besides, they'd be equipped with agricultural implements instead of wrenches.\"  Drummond got up suddenly. \"You figure it out. I have something else to try.\"  Angus followed him along the ledge until they reached the mouth of the cave.  \"What are you going to do?\"  Drummond hitched his trousers. \"The way we're ringed in here, it's a cinch we won't get past 'em in the six hours we have left.\"  \"So you're going to make off through the cave?\"  The younger man nodded. \"They might take off after me. That'll give you a chance to get to the ship and cut off those converters before they make like a nova.\"  Angus chuckled. \"Suppose half of them decide to stay here with me?\"  Drummond swore impatiently at his skepticism. \"At any rate, one of us might get back to the converters.\"  \"And leave the other here?\"  \"He can say he's Jackson and order an attack in force on the ship.\"  \"I don't follow you.\"  \"Skidding the ship in a circle with the exhaust blowers on,\" Drummond explained patiently, \"will take care of _ten thousand_ clunkers.\"  He dropped from the ledge and raced into the cave. None of the robots stirred. Either they hadn't noticed Drummond's departure, Angus reasoned, or they weren't concerned because they knew the cave led nowhere.         *       *       *       *       *  The sun came up, daubing the cliff with splotches of orange and purple and striking up scintillations in the beads of dew on the robots' backs.  And still the tiresomely shouted veneration continued.  Angus paced the ledge, stopping occasionally to stare into the impenetrable shadows of the cave. He checked his watch. Five hours to go--five hours, and then time would be meaningless for the rest of his life, with the ship destroyed.  It was unlikely that rescue would come. The wrecked spacer's automatic distress signals had gone out in an ever-expanding sphere for a hundred years, and he and Drummond had been the only humans to hear them.  Trade routes were pretty stable in this section of the Galaxy now. And it was hardly possible that, within the next ten or twenty years, one would be opened up that would intercept the SOS that had lured them here.  He stood up and surveyed the robots. \"RA-204.\"  204 reared erect. \"Yes, Jackson?\"  \"One of us is gone.\"  \"We know, O Supervisor.\"  \"Why did you let him get away?\"  \"If he is not the True Jackson, it doesn't matter that he fled. If he is the Supervisor, he will return. Otherwise, why did he come here to us in the first place?\"  Another robot straightened. \"We are ashamed, O Jackson, that we have failed the Divine Test and have not recognized our True Supervisor.\"  Angus held up his arms for silence. \"Once there was a cargo of robots. That was a hundred years ago. The ship was from Vega II. It developed trouble and crashed when it tried to land on this planet. There was--\"  \"What's a year, O Supervisor?\" asked 204.  \"A Vega-two, Jackson?\" said 76 bewilderedly.  \"What's a planet?\" another wanted to know.  McIntosh leaned back hopelessly against the cliff. All of their memories and a good deal of their vocabularies had been lost. He could determine how much only through days of conversation. It would take weeks to learn their function, to rekindle a sense of duty sufficiently strong to draw their interest away from religion. Unless--  He drew resolutely erect. \"Strip the converters! Pull the aft tube lining!\"  The robots looked uncomprehendingly at him. It was obvious they weren't trained for spacecraft maintenance.  But it had to have something to do with mechanics. \"A battle fleet is orbiting at one diameter! Arm all warheads on the double!\"  They stared helplessly at one another, then back at Angus. Not ordnancemen.  \"Pedestrian Strip Number Two is jammed! Crane crew, muster on the right!\"  The robots shifted uncertainly. Apparently they weren't civic maintenancemen, either.  Defeated, Angus scanned their blank face plates. For a moment, it was almost as though he could discern expressions of confusion. Then he laughed at the thought that metal could accommodate a frown.  Suddenly the robots shifted their gaze to the cave. Drummond, shoulders sagging dismally, walked out and squinted against the glare. Several of the robots started toward him.  \"Okay, okay!\" he growled, heading back for the ledge before they could reach him.         *       *       *       *       *  \"No luck?\" Angus asked.  Disgusted, Drummond clambered up beside him. \"The cave's just a nice-sized room.\"  \"Took you two hours to find that out?\"  The younger man shook his head. \"I was hiding by the entrance, waiting for the clunkers to break it up and give me a chance to run for the ship.... How many robots did we decide there were?\"  \"About eight hundred.\"  \"Wrong. You can add another four hundred or so.\"  \"In the cave?\"  Drummond nodded. \"With their parts spread all the way from here to hell and back.\"  \"Dismantled?\"  \"Down to the last nut and bolt. They've even got their secondary memory banks stripped.\"  Angus was thoughtfully silent a long while. \"RA ...\" he said finally. \"Robot Assembler!\"  \"That's what I figured.\" Drummond turned back toward the robots and funneled his voice through his hands.  \"Okay, you clunkers! I want all odd-numbered RAs stripped down for reconditioning!\" He glanced at Angus. \"When they get through, I'll have half of what's left strip the other half, and so forth.\"  McIntosh grinned caustically. \"Brilliant! The whole operation shouldn't take more than two or three days.\" Then his face took on a grim cast. \"Drummond, we've only got four hours left to get to those converters.\"  \"But you don't understand. Once they get started, they'll be so busy, we'll probably be able to walk away.\"  Angus smiled indulgently. \"Once they get started.\"  He nodded toward the robots.  They had all returned to their attitude of veneration.  \"It won't work,\" McIntosh explained. \"Their obsession with religion is stronger than their primary compulsion. That's probably because they've been satisfying their compulsion all along.\" He jerked a thumb in the direction of the cave.  Drummond swore venomously.  Angus dropped down on the ledge and folded his knees in his arms. He felt his age bearing down on him for the first time.  \"Twelve hundred robots,\" he said meditatively. \"Twelve hundred _RA_ robots. Out of touch with civilization for a century. Satisfying their primary function by disassembling and assembling one another. Going at it in shifts. Splitting themselves into three groups.\"  \"That device on their left thumb,\" Drummond interrupted. \"It's a burnisher. That's why they're so shiny.\"  Angus nodded. \"Three groups."]]]
