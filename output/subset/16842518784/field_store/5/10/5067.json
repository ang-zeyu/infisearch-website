Only be careful that you have no accidents.\"  \"We'll try to be careful,\" answered Dick, with a grim smile. \"We don't want a tumble if we can help it.\"  \"It is a grand sport,\" answered the head of the college. \"Before long I expect to see aeroplanes in constant use.\"  \"Wouldn't you like to go up with us some day, Doctor?\" questioned Tom, slyly.  \"Well--er--perhaps, Thomas. But not just yet. I wish--er--to see them more in general use first.\" And then the doctor bowed the students out.  The boys lost no time in preparing for the trip to Plankville. After a somewhat hasty lunch they put on their flying suits and then went down to where the Dartaway was housed, in one of the buildings attached to the gymnasium.  \"Looks to be all right,\" remarked Dick, after an inspection of the flying machine, and while Sam and Tom were filling the gasoline tank and the oil distributor.  The engine was tried out for a minute, and found to be in perfect order. As usual, as soon as the explosions of the motor were heard, a crowd commenced to gather, to see the start of the flight.  \"Wish you luck!\" cried Stanley.  \"Say, look out that you don't forget how to stop and sail to the North Pole!\" sang out Spud Jackson.  \"As if that could really occur!\" murmured William Philander Tubbs, with a lofty look of, disdain.  \"Sure it could happen,\" returned Spud, good-naturedly. \"Why, I heard of an airman who went up once and forgot how to turn his machine down, and he went around and around in a circle for sixteen hours. And then he dropped ker-plunk right on top of a baker's wagon and smashed twenty-six pies--all because his gasoline gave out.\"  \"Ridiculous!\" murmured William Philander.  \"Absolute fact, Tubbs,\" responded Spud, earnestly. \"Come with me, some day, and I'll show you where the pies made a dent in the street when the flying machine struck 'em.\" And then a general laugh went up, and the dudish student stepped back in the crowd, out of sight.  \"All aboard!\" sang out Dick, as he hopped into the driver's seat and took hold of the wheel. \"Start her up, somebody!\"  Sam and Tom got aboard and willing hands grasped the propellers and gave each a twist. Bang! bang! bang! went the explosions, and soon the propellers were revolving swiftly, and then with a swoop the Dartaway ran over the campus on its wheels and suddenly arose in the air. A cheer went up, and the students threw up their caps. Then Dick swung around in a quarter circle and headed directly for Plankville.  It was an ideal day for flying, not too hot or too cold, and with very little breeze, and that of the \"steady\" kind, not likely to develop \"holes\"--the one great terror of all airmen.  \"Wish we had the girls along,\" remarked Sam, when they were well on the way.  \"Not for this trip, Sam,\" answered Dick, grimly. \"We have got our work cut out for us.\"  \"Why, what do you mean?\"  \"If old Crabtree hasn't been caught yet me must see if we can't round him up.\"     CHAPTER III  A USELESS HUNT   \"Say, that's the talk!\" cried Tom, quickly. \"I hadn't thought of that,--but it's just what we ought to do.\"  \"It won't be easy, Tom,\" said his younger brother. \"The chances are that Crabtree has made good use of his time. He may be hundreds of miles away--bound for the West or the South, or Canada or Europe.\"  \"Well, we can have a try at finding him, anyway,\" put in Dick. \"Sometimes a criminal sticks close to the jail until the excitement is over, Look at those fellows who escaped from jail in New York City not long ago. The detectives thought they had gone to Chicago or St. Louis, and all the while they were on the East Side, right in New York!\"  \"Oh, my! but wouldn't I just like to land on old Crabtree!\" muttered Tom. \"I think I'd be apt to put him in the hospital first and jail afterwards! He certainly deserves it--for all the trouble he has caused us and our--er--friends.\"  \"'Friends' is good, with Dick engaged to marry Dora and you as good as engaged to Nellie,\" snorted Sam \"Precisely, and you and Grace making goo-goo eyes at each other,\" added Tom, with a wink at his younger brother. Then he quickly changed the subject. \"Dick, do you think you can strike a straight course for Plankville?\"  \"I'll try it,\" was the answer. \"I don't think I'll go much out of the way.\"  The Dartaway had a powerful motor, and once on the right trail the eldest Rover advanced his gasoline and spark, and they went rushing through the air at express-train speed. The boys were provided with face guards, so they did not mind this. They did not fly high, and so kept the railroad and other familiar objects fairly well in view. They passed over several villages, the inhabitants gazing up at them in open-mouthed wonder, and finally came in sight of a big church spire that they knew belonged in Plankville. Then Dick slowed down the engine, and soon they floated down in an open field close to the main street and not a great distance from the sheriff's office and the jail.  \"Well, it certainly didn't take long to get here,\" cried Tom, as he consulted his watch.  A man who lived close by was approaching and he readily agreed, for a small amount, to guard the biplane.  \"Have they caught those men who escaped from the jail?\" asked Sam, of the man.  \"Got two on 'em,\" was the reply. \"Dacker and Penfield.\"  \"What of Crabtree?\" asked Dick.  \"Nuthin' doin', up to an hour ago. The sheriff is out with about ten men, lookin' fer him.\"  \"Then there is no use of our going to the sherif's office,\" said Dick to his brothers \"We'll go right to the jail.\"  \"Will they let us in?\" asked Sam.  \"In the office, yes. We won't want to go to the cells,\" answered Dick, with a short laugh.  When they reached the office of the jail they found several men present, including the head keeper and one of the State detectives. The keeper had seen the Rover boys at the time of the capture of Crabtree and the others and he smiled a little as he shook hands.  \"Bad business,\" he said, in answer to a question Dick put. \"But I can't exactly blame my men for what happened.\"  \"Weren't you here at the time?\" asked Tom.  \"No, I was out of town--calling on my mother, who is very old and quite sick. There was a fire in the pantry off the kitchen, and for a few minutes it looked as if the old jail would burn to the ground. Of course the guards got excited, and all they thought of was to put out the blaze--and it's a good thing they did that. That's how the prisoners got away. I suppose you've heard that we rounded up two of them.\"  \"Yes,\" answered Dick. \"Have they any idea what became of Crabtree?\"  \"I haven't. If the sheriff knows anything he hasn't told it. By the way, boys, I'll tell you something, now you are here. That man is a hypnotist!\"  \"We know it,\" said Dick \"I thought I told you.\"  \"He tried to hypnotize one of the men one day,--almost got away, doing it!\"  \"Did he hire any lawyer to defend him?\" asked Tom, curiously.  \"I don't know about a lawyer. He had a man out to see him, several times. The two were very friendly.\"  \"They were?\" cried Dick. \"I never knew Josiah Crabtree had any friends, outside of the rascals he associated with. Who was the man?\"  \"He gave his name as John Smith. But I guess that was false, for he acted as if he didn't want to be known.\"  \"What kind of a looking man was he?\" asked Sam.  \"Why, he was a tall, thin fellow with a very pointed chin, and bushy black hair and heavy black eyebrows. When he spoke his voice had a regular rumble to it.\"  At this description the Rover boys shook their heads. They could think of nobody they had met who would fit the picture.  \"When was that man here last?\" asked Dick.  \"A couple of days ago. I didn't like him for a cent, but as the prisoners haven't been convicted of any crimes as yet I had to let 'em see their friends,\" explained the jail keeper.  \"What of Sobber, Larkspur and the others?\" questioned Tom.  \"All safe enough. Nobody else is going to get out of here if I can help it,\" and the keeper shook his head decidedly.  The boys remained at the jail for a while longer, and heard the particulars of how the fire had originated and of how the prisoners had gotten away. Two of the men had kept together, but Crabtree had gone off by himself, and the last seen of him was when he was running for the river, which flowed some distance back of the jail.  \"Let us go down to the river and take a look around,\" suggested Dick, at last, and bidding the jailer good-bye, they hurried away.  Along the river bank they found several men and boys, all looking for Crabtree, some thinking there might be a reward offered for the capture of the criminal. The Rovers joined in the hunt for the best part of an hour, but without success.  \"It's worse than looking for a pin in a haystack,\" grumbled Tom, presently. \"We might as well give it up.\"  \"Let us walk around the town and see if we can learn anything,\" suggested his big brother.  They walked down the main street of Plankville from end to end, questioning several people they knew. At last they got word that a mysterious automobile had passed through the town about midnight of the day Josiah Crabtree had broken from jail. But who had been in the touring car nobody could tell.  \"He may have escaped in that,\" declared Dick.  \"And if he did, that man who came to see him at the jail had the car,\" added Sam.  \"Just what I think,\" cried Tom. \"Well, if he got away in an auto there is no use of our looking for him here,\" he added, with a sigh.  Nevertheless, the boys hung around Plankville for an hour longer. Then they got aboard of the Dartaway, and with Tom at the wheel, and Dick with a pair of field glasses to his eyes, swung in several circles about the neighborhood.  \"No use,\" declared the oldest Rover boy, at last. \"It is getting late.

From the experience which I had gained during my two years' journeyings, both in surmounting the difficulties of travelling through a broken mountainous country, and in enduring privations of every sort, \"I was inspired with the desire of attempting it,\" provided I could be assisted in the expense that would necessarily be incurred for the outfit, and could find a few companions who would be contented with animal food, and willingly and patiently submit to the privation of flour, tea, and sugar, and resign themselves to my guidance.  I had well considered this interesting subject in all its bearings, and had discussed it with many of my acquaintances at Brisbane and its neighbouring district; who were generally of opinion that it was practicable, under the plan I had marked out: but with others, particularly at Sydney, I had to contend against a strong but kindly meant opposition to my journey. Some, who took more than a common interest in my pursuits, regretted that I should leave so promising a field of research as that which offered itself within the limits of New South Wales, and in which they considered I had laboured with some success during the last two years. Others considered the undertaking exceedingly dangerous, and even the conception of it madness on my part; and the consequence of a blind enthusiasm, nourished either by a deep devotion to science, or by an unreasonable craving for fame: whilst others did not feel themselves justified in assisting a man who they considered was setting out with an intention of committing suicide. I was not, however, blind as to the difficulties of the journey which I was determined to undertake; on the contrary, and I hope my readers will believe me to be sincere, I thought they would be many and great--greater indeed than they eventually proved to be; but, during my recent excursions through the Squatting districts, I had so accustomed myself to a comparatively wild life, and had so closely observed the habits of the aborigines, that I felt assured that the only real difficulties which I could meet with would be of a local character. And I was satisfied that, by cautiously proceeding, and always reconnoitring in advance or on either side of our course, I should be able to conduct my party through a grassy and well watered route; and, if I were so fortunate as to effect this, I felt assured that the journey, once commenced, would be finished only by our arrival at Port Essington. Buoyed up by this feeling, and by confidence in myself, I prevailed against the solicitations and arguments of my friends, and commenced my preparations, which, so far as my own slender means and the contributions of kind friends allowed, were rather hurriedly completed by the 13th August, 1844.  As our movements were to be comparatively in light marching order, our preparations were confined more to such provisions and stores as were actually necessary, than to anything else. But I had frequently reason to regret that I was not better furnished with instruments, particularly Barometers, or a boiling water apparatus, to ascertain the elevation of the country and ranges we had to travel over. The only instruments which I carried, were a Sextant and Artificial Horizon, a Chronometer, a hand Kater's Compass, a small Thermometer, and Arrowsmith's Map of the Continent of New Holland.  In arranging the plan of my journey I had limited my party to six individuals; and although many young men volunteered their services, I was obliged to decline their offers, and confine myself to the stated number, as it was intimately connected with the principles and the means on which I started.  On leaving Sydney, my companions consisted of Mr. James Calvert; Mr. John Roper; John Murphy, a lad of about 16 years old: of William Phillips, a prisoner of the Crown; and of \"Harry Brown,\" an aboriginal of the Newcastle tribe: making with myself six individuals.  We left Sydney, on the night of the 13th August, for Moreton Bay, in the steamer \"Sovereign,\" Captain Cape; and I have much pleasure in recording and thankfully acknowledging the liberality and disinterested kindness of the Hunter's River Steam Navigation Company, in allowing me a free passage for my party with our luggage and thirteen horses. The passage was unusually long, and, instead of arriving at Brisbane in three days, we were at sea a week, so that my horses suffered much for food and water, and became discouragingly poor. On arriving at Brisbane, we were received with the greatest kindness by my friends the \"Squatters,\" a class principally composed of young men of good education, gentlemanly habits, and high principles, and whose unbounded hospitality and friendly assistance I had previously experienced during my former travels through the district. These gentlemen and the inhabitants of Brisbane overloaded me with kind contributions, much of which, however, to avoid any unnecessary increase to my luggage, I found myself compelled to decline or leave behind; so that I had to forego the advantage of many useful and desirable articles, from their being too cumbersome for my limited means of carriage, and therefore interfering with the arrangements for my undertaking.  My means, however, had since my arrival been so much increased, that I was after much reluctance prevailed upon to make one change,--to increase my party; and the following persons were added to the expedition:--Mr. Pemberton Hodgson, a resident of the district; Mr. Gilbert; Caleb, an American negro; and \"Charley,\" an aboriginal native of the Bathurst tribe. Mr. Hodgson was so desirous of accompanying me that, in consideration of former obligations, I could not refuse him, and, as he was fond of Botanical pursuits, I thought he might be useful. Of Mr. Gilbert I knew nothing; he was in the service of Mr. Gould, the talented Zoologist who has added so much to our knowledge of the Fauna of Australia, and expressed himself so anxious for an opportunity of making important observations as to the limits of the habitat of the Eastern Coast Birds, and also where those of the North Coast commence; as well as of discovering forms new to Science during the progress of the journey, that, from a desire to render all the service in my power to Natural History, I found myself obliged to yield to his solicitations, although for some time I was opposed to his wish. These gentlemen equipped themselves, and added four horses and two bullocks to those already provided.  Perhaps, of all the difficulties I afterwards encountered, none were of so much real annoyance as those we experienced at first starting from Brisbane. Much rain had fallen, which filled the creeks and set them running, and made the road so boggy and soft as to render them almost impassable. It took us the whole day to transport our party, cattle, and provisions over the river, and the operation was not concluded before sunset; but, as it was a fine moonlight night, I determined to start, however short my first stage might be. Fortunately, my friends had lent me a bullock dray to convey a portion of our stores as far as Darling Downs; but, having purchased a light spring cart, it was also loaded; and, flattering myself that we should proceed comfortably and rapidly, I gave orders to march. After much continued difficulty in urging and assisting our horses to drag the cart through the boggy road, we arrived, at about one o'clock in the morning, at Cowper's Plains, about ten miles from Brisbane.   I now found my cart an impediment to our movements; but, as it had been an expensive article, I did not despair of its becoming more useful after passing the boggy country. A few days afterwards, however, an accident settled the question; the horses ran away with it, and thereby the shaft was broken, and the spring injured, so that I was compelled to leave it; which I then did most cheerfully, as it is always easier to man to yield to necessity, than to adopt an apparently inconvenient measure by his own free will. The load was removed to pack-horses, and we proceeded with comparative ease to Mr. Campbell's station, enjoying the hospitality of the settlers as we passed on, and carrying with us their best wishes.  I was fortunate in exchanging my broken cart for three good travelling bullocks, and afterwards purchased five draft-bullocks, which we commenced to break in for the pack-saddle; for I had by this time satisfied myself that we could not depend upon the horses for carrying our load. Neither my companions nor myself knew much about bullocks, and it was a long time before we were reconciled to the dangerous vicinity of their horns. By means, however, of iron nose-rings with ropes attached, we obtained a tolerable command over their movements; and, at last, by dint of habit, soon became familiar with, and even got attached to, our blunt and often refractory COMPAGNONS DE VOYAGE.  By a present from Messieurs Campbell and Stephens of four young steers and one old bullock, and of a fat bullock from Mr. Isaacs, our stock of cattle consisted now of 16 head: of horses we had 17: and our party consisted of ten individuals. Of provisions--we had 1200 lbs. of flour: 200 lbs. of sugar: 80 lbs. of tea: 20 lbs. of gelatine: and other articles of less consideration, but adding much to our comfort during the first few weeks of our journey. Of ammunition--we had about 30 pounds of powder, and 8 bags of shot of different sizes, chiefly of No. 4 and No. 6. Every one, at my desire, had provided himself with two pair of strong trowsers, three strong shirts, and two pair of shoes; and I may further remark that some of us were provided with Ponchos, made of light strong calico, saturated with oil, which proved very useful to us by keeping out the wet, and made us independent of the weather; so that we were well provided for seven months, which I was sanguine enough to think would be a sufficient time for our journey. The result proved that our"]]]
