He might have saved her life, but only casually, as a by-product of some larger scheme, and her appreciation held little gratitude.  The fat man shook his head without rancor. \"I have plenty of money, thank you, Mrs. Gabriel Lockard.... Come,\" he addressed her husband, \"if you get up, I'll drive you home. I warn you, be more careful in the future! Sometimes,\" he added musingly, \"I almost wish you would let something happen. Then my problem would not be any problem, would it?\"  Gabriel shivered. \"I'll be careful,\" he vowed. \"I promise--I'll be careful.\"  When he was sure that his charge was safely tucked in for the night, the fat man checked his personal possessions. He then requested a taxi driver to take him to the nearest zarquil game. The driver accepted the commission phlegmatically. Perhaps he was more hardened than the others had been; perhaps he was unaware that the fat man was not a desperate or despairing individual seeking one last chance, but what was known colloquially as a flying dutchman, a man, or woman, who went from one zarquil game to another, loving the thrill of the sport, if you could call it that, for its own sake, and not for the futile hope it extended and which was its sole shred of claim to moral justification. Perhaps--and this was the most likely hypothesis--he just didn't care.  Zarquil was extremely illegal, of course--so much so that there were many legitimate citizens who weren't quite sure just what the word implied, knowing merely that it was one of those nameless horrors so deliciously hinted at by the fax sheets under the generic term of \"crimes against nature.\" Actually the phrase was more appropriate to zarquil than to most of the other activities to which it was commonly applied. And this was one crime--for it was crime in law as well as nature--in which victim had to be considered as guilty as perpetrator; otherwise the whole legal structure of society would collapse.         *       *       *       *       *  Playing the game was fabulously expensive; it had to be to make it profitable for the Vinzz to run it. Those odd creatures from Altair's seventh planet cared nothing for the welfare of the completely alien human beings; all they wanted was to feather their own pockets with interstellar credits, so that they could return to Vinau and buy many slaves. For, on Vinau, bodies were of little account, and so to them zarquil was the equivalent of the terrestrial game musical chairs. Which was why they came to Terra to make profits--there has never been big money in musical chairs as such.  When the zarquil operators were apprehended, which was not frequent--as they had strange powers, which, not being definable, were beyond the law--they suffered their sentences with equanimity. No Earth court could give an effective prison sentence to a creature whose life spanned approximately two thousand terrestrial years. And capital punishment had become obsolete on Terra, which very possibly saved the terrestrials embarrassment, for it was not certain that their weapons could kill the Vinzz ... or whether, in fact, the Vinzz merely expired after a period of years out of sheer boredom. Fortunately, because trade was more profitable than war, there had always been peace between Vinau and Terra, and, for that reason, Terra could not bar the entrance of apparently respectable citizens of a friendly planet.  The taxi driver took the fat man to one of the rather seedy locales in which the zarquil games were usually found, for the Vinzz attempted to conduct their operations with as much unobtrusiveness as was possible. But the front door swung open on an interior that lacked the opulence of the usual Vinoz set-up; it was down-right shabby, the dim olive light hinting of squalor rather than forbidden pleasures. That was the trouble in these smaller towns--you ran greater risks of getting involved in games where the players had not been carefully screened.  The Vinoz games were usually clean, because that paid off better, but, when profits were lacking, the Vinzz were capable of sliding off into darkside practices. Naturally the small-town houses were more likely to have trouble in making ends meet, because everybody in the parish knew everybody else far too well.  The fat man wondered whether that had been his quarry's motive in coming to such desolate, off-trail places--hoping that eventually disaster would hit the one who pursued him. Somehow, such a plan seemed too logical for the man he was haunting.  However, beggars could not be choosers. The fat man paid off the heli-driver and entered the zarquil house. \"One?\" the small green creature in the slightly frayed robe asked.  \"One,\" the fat man answered.   III  The would-be thief fled down the dark alley, with the hot bright rays from the stranger's gun lancing out after him in flamboyant but futile patterns. The stranger, a thin young man with delicate, angular features, made no attempt to follow. Instead, he bent over to examine Gabriel Lockard's form, appropriately outstretched in the gutter. \"Only weighted out,\" he muttered, \"he'll be all right. Whatever possessed you two to come out to a place like this?\"  \"I really think Gabriel _must_ be possessed....\" the girl said, mostly to herself. \"I had no idea of the kind of place it was going to be until he brought me here. The others were bad, but this is even worse. It almost seems as if he went around looking for trouble, doesn't it?\"  \"It does indeed,\" the stranger agreed, coughing a little. It was growing colder and, on this world, the cities had no domes to protect them from the climate, because it was Earth and the air was breathable and it wasn't worth the trouble of fixing up.  The girl looked closely at him. \"You look different, but you _are_ the same man who pulled us out of that aircar crash, aren't you? And before that the man in the gray suit? And before that...?\"  The young man's cheekbones protruded as he smiled. \"Yes, I'm all of them.\"  \"Then what they say about the zarquil games is true? There are people who go around changing their bodies like--like hats?\" Automatically she reached to adjust the expensive bit of blue synthetic on her moon-pale hair, for she was always conscious of her appearance; if she had not been so before marriage, Gabriel would have taught her that.         *       *       *       *       *  He smiled again, but coughed instead of speaking.  \"But why do you do it? _Why!_ Do you like it? Or is it because of Gabriel?\" She was growing a little frantic; there was menace here and she could not understand it nor determine whether or not she was included in its scope. \"Do you want to keep him from recognizing you; is that it?\"  \"Ask him.\"  \"He won't tell me; he never tells me anything. We just keep running. I didn't recognize it as running at first, but now I realize that's what we've been doing ever since we were married. And running from you, I think?\"  There was no change of expression on the man's gaunt face, and she wondered how much control he had over a body that, though second- or third- or fourth-hand, must be new to him. How well could he make it respond? What was it like to step into another person's casing? But she must not let herself think that way or she would find herself looking for a zarquil game. It would be one way of escaping Gabriel, but not, she thought, the best way; her body was much too good a one to risk so casually.         *       *       *       *       *  It was beginning to snow. Light, feathery flakes drifted down on her husband's immobile body. She pulled her thick coat--of fur taken from some animal who had lived and died light-years away--more closely about herself. The thin young man began to cough again.  Overhead a tiny star seemed to detach itself from the pale flat disk of the Moon and hurl itself upward--one of the interstellar ships embarking on its long voyage to distant suns. She wished that somehow she could be on it, but she was here, on this solitary old world in a barren solar system, with her unconscious husband and a strange man who followed them, and it looked as if here she would stay ... all three of them would stay....  \"If you're after Gabriel, planning to hurt him,\" she asked, \"why then do you keep helping him?\"  \"I am not helping _him_. And he knows that.\"  \"You'll change again tonight, won't you?\" she babbled. \"You always change after you ... meet us? I think I'm beginning to be able to identify you now, even when you're ... wearing a new body; there's something about you that doesn't change.\"  \"Too bad he got married,\" the young man said. \"I could have followed him for an eternity and he would never have been able to pick me out from the crowd. Too bad he got married anyway,\" he added, his voice less impersonal, \"for your sake.\"  She had come to the same conclusion in her six months of marriage, but she would not admit that to an outsider. Though this man was hardly an outsider; he was part of their small family group--as long as she had known Gabriel, so long he must have known her. And she began to suspect that he was even more closely involved than that.  \"Why must you change again?\" she persisted, obliquely approaching the subject she feared. \"You have a pretty good body there. Why run the risk of getting a bad one?\"  \"This isn't a good body,\" he said. \"It's diseased. Sure, nobody's supposed to play the game who hasn't passed a thorough medical examination. But in the places to which your husband has been leading me, they're often not too particular, as long as the player has plenty of foliage.\"  \"How--long will it last you?\"  \"Four or five months, if I'm careful.\" He smiled. \"But don't worry, if that's what you're doing; I'll get it passed on before then. It'll be expensive--that's"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/50988"],["title","Bodyguard (#2)"],["body"," all. Bad landing for the guy who gets it, but then it was tough on me too, wasn't it?\"  \"But how did you get into this ... pursuit?\" she asked again. \"And why are you doing it?\" People didn't have any traffic with Gabriel Lockard for fun, not after they got to know him. And this man certainly should know him better than most.  \"Ask your husband.\"  The original Gabriel Lockard looked down at the prostrate, snow-powdered figure of the man who had stolen his body and his name, and stirred it with his toe. \"I'd better call a cab--he might freeze to death.\"  He signaled and a cab came.  \"Tell him, when he comes to,\" he said to the girl as he and the driver lifted the heavy form of her husband into the helicar, \"that I'm getting pretty tired of this.\" He stopped for a long spell of coughing. \"Tell him that sometimes I wonder whether cutting off my nose wouldn't, in the long run, be most beneficial for my face.\"         *       *       *       *       *  \"Sorry,\" the Vinzz said impersonally, in English that was perfect except for the slight dampening of the sibilants, \"but I'm afraid you cannot play.\"  \"Why not?\" The emaciated young man began to put on his clothes.  \"You know why. Your body is worthless. And this is a reputable house.\"  \"But I have plenty of money.\" The young man coughed. The Vinzz shrugged. \"I'll pay you twice the regular fee.\"  The green one shook his head. \"Regrettably, I do mean what I say. This game is really clean.\"  \"In a town like this?\"  \"That is the reason we can afford to be honest.\" The Vinzz' tendrils quivered in what the man had come to recognize as amusement through long, but necessarily superficial acquaintance with the Vinzz. His heavy robe of what looked like moss-green velvet, but might have been velvet-green moss, encrusted with oddly faceted alien jewels, swung with him.  \"We do a lot of business here,\" he said unnecessarily, for the whole set-up spelled wealth far beyond the dreams of the man, and he was by no means poor when it came to worldly goods. \"Why don't you try another town where they're not so particular?\"  The young man smiled wryly. Just his luck to stumble on a sunny game. He never liked to risk following his quarry in the same configuration. And even though only the girl had actually seen him this time, he wouldn't feel at ease until he had made the usual body-shift. Was he changing because of Gabriel, he wondered, or was he using his own discoverment and identification simply as an excuse to cover the fact that none of the bodies that fell to his lot ever seemed to fit him? Was he activated solely by revenge or as much by the hope that in the hazards of the game he might, impossible though it now seemed, some day win another body that approached perfection as nearly as his original casing had?  He didn't know. However, there seemed to be no help for it now; he would have to wait until they reached the next town, unless the girl, seeing him reappear in the same guise, would guess what had happened and tell her husband. He himself had been a fool to admit to her that the hulk he inhabited was a sick one; he still couldn't understand how he could so casually have entrusted her with so vital a piece of information.         *       *       *       *       *  The Vinzz had been locking antennae with another of his kind. Now they detached, and the first approached the man once more. \"There is, as it happens, a body available for a private game,\" he lisped. \"No questions to be asked or answered. All I can tell you is that it is in good health.\"  The man hesitated. \"But unable to pass the screening?\" he murmured aloud. \"A criminal then.\"  The green one's face--if you could call it a face--remained impassive.  \"Male?\"  \"Of course,\" the Vinzz said primly. His kind did have certain ultimate standards to which they adhered rigidly, and one of those was the curious tabu against mixed games, strictly enforced even though it kept them from tapping a vast source of potential players. There had also never been a recorded instance of humans and extraterrestrials exchanging identities, but whether that was the result of tabu or biological impossibility, no one could tell.  It might merely be prudence on the Vinzz' part--if it had ever been proved that an alien life-form had \"desecrated\" a human body, Earthmen would clamor for war ... for on this planet humanity held its self-bestowed purity of birthright dear--and the Vinzz, despite being unquestionably the stronger, were pragmatic pacifists. It had been undoubtedly some rabid member of the anti-alien groups active on Terra who had started the rumor that the planetary slogan of Vinau was, \"Don't beat 'em; cheat 'em.\"  \"It would have to be something pretty nuclear for the other guy to take such a risk.\" The man rubbed his chin thoughtfully. \"How much?\"  \"Thirty thousand credits.\"  \"Why, that's three times the usual rate!\"  \"The other will pay five times the usual rate.\"  \"Oh, all right,\" the delicate young man gave in. It was a terrific risk he was agreeing to take, because, if the other was a criminal, he himself would, upon assuming the body, assume responsibility for all the crimes it had committed. But there was nothing else he could do.         *       *       *       *       *  He looked at himself in the mirror and found he had a fine new body; tall and strikingly handsome in a dark, coarse-featured way. Nothing to match the one he had lost, in his opinion, but there were probably many people who might find this one preferable. No identification in the pockets, but it wasn't necessary; he recognized the face. Not that it was a very famous or even notorious one, but the dutchman was a careful student of the \"wanted\" fax that had decorated public buildings from time immemorial, for he was ever mindful of the possibility that he might one day find himself trapped unwittingly in the body of one of the men depicted there. And he knew that this particular man, though not an important criminal in any sense of the word, was one whom the police had been ordered to burn on sight. The abolishing of capital punishment could not abolish the necessity for self-defense, and the man in question was not one who would let himself be captured easily, nor whom the police intended to capture easily.  _This might be a lucky break for me after all_, the new tenant thought, as he tried to adjust himself to the body. It, too, despite its obvious rude health, was not a very comfortable fit. _I can do a lot with a hulk like this. And maybe I'm cleverer than the original owner; maybe I'll be able to get away with it._   IV  \"Look, Gabe,\" the girl said, \"don't try to fool me! I know you too well. And I know you have that man's--the real Gabriel Lockard's--body.\" She put unnecessary stardust on her nose as she watched her husband's reflection in the dressing table mirror.  Lockard--Lockard's body, at any rate--sat up and felt his unshaven chin. \"That what he tell you?\"  \"No, he didn't tell me anything really--just suggested I ask you whatever I want to know. But why else should he guard somebody he obviously hates the way he hates you? Only because he doesn't want to see his body spoiled.\"  \"It _is_ a pretty good body, isn't it?\" Gabe flexed softening muscles and made no attempt to deny her charge; very probably he was relieved at having someone with whom to share his secret.  \"Not as good as it must have been,\" the girl said, turning and looking at him without admiration. \"Not if you keep on the way you're coursing. Gabe, why don't you...?\"  \"Give it back to him, eh?\" Lockard regarded his wife appraisingly. \"You'd like that, wouldn't you? You'd be _his_ wife then. That would be nice--a sound mind in a sound body. But don't you think that's a little more than you deserve?\"  \"I wasn't thinking about that, Gabe,\" she said truthfully enough, for she hadn't followed the idea to its logical conclusion. \"Of course I'd go with you,\" she went on, now knowing she lied, \"when you got your ... old body back.\"  _Sure_, she thought, _I'd keep going with you to farjeen houses and thrill-mills._ Actually she had accompanied him to a thrill-mill only once, and from then on, despite all his threats, she had refused to go with him again. But that once had been enough; nothing could ever wash that experience from her mind or her body.  \"You wouldn't be able to get your old body back, though, would you?\" she went on. \"You don't know where it's gone, and neither, I suppose, does he?\"  \"I don't want to know!\" he spat. \"I wouldn't want it if I could get it back. Whoever it adhered to probably killed himself as soon as he looked in a mirror.\" He swung long legs over the side of his bed. \"Christ, anything would be better than that! You can't imagine what a hulk I had!\"  \"Oh, yes, I can,\" she said incautiously. \"You must have had a body to match your character. Pity you could only change one.\"         *       *       *       *       *  He rose from the bed and struck her right on the mouth. Although he hadn't used his full strength, the blow was painful nonetheless. She could feel the red of her lipstick become mixed with a warmer, liquid red that trickled slowly down her freshly powdered chin. She wouldn't cry, because he liked that, but crumpled to the ground and lay still. If, experience had taught her, she pretended to be hurt, he wouldn't hit her again. Only sometimes it was hard to remember that at the actual moment of hurt and indignity. He was too afraid of prison--a tangible prison. And perhaps, to do him credit, he didn't want to deface his own property.  He sat down on the edge of the bed again and lit a milgot stick. \"Oh, get up, Helen. You know I didn't hit you that hard.\"  \"Did you have to beat him up to get him to change bodies?\" she asked from the floor.  \"No.\" He laughed reminiscently. \"I just got him drunk. We were friends, so it was a cinch. He was my only friend; everybody else hated me because of my appearance.\" His features contorted. \"What made him think he "]]]
