I don't want to know differently--until it's too late.\"  This was just real great. Larson had some fantastic notion, and he wanted it to be true so damned badly that he was taking us into blind jeopardy when we had the means to probe it first. Real scientific, that.  Humans! Men, and their so-called sense of reason! Larson was a crowning example of the sloppy-hearted thing I was fleeing when I embarked on this joy-ride, and now it would probably be my undoing.  We were homing in on the transmission from \"New Columbia\", easing down into the atmosphere, and now clouds and land and water formations took shape. The beam led us to the sunlit rim of dawn, and suddenly we were hovering over a great forest, slit at intervals with streaks of glittering blue that looked like deep, wide rivers.  Now Mac touched a switch, and the CW whistle gave us a tight audio beam to follow to the source of the signal. Larson switched to the micro landing controls to ride in like a jet liner on the Frisco-Shanghai run. We slanted gently down until the forest became trees, and the little blue-green splotches were lush, grassy meadows.  And there was the tower, and the low buildings--and the spaceship!  Something happened to me inside when I saw that. It was a kind of tremolo feeling, like a note in a new symphony, a note that springs free and alone, wavering uncertainly, and you don't know which way it will turn.  In seconds that seemed like hours, we were on the ground, the ramp was jammed out and Larson was blundering down it crying like a baby.         *       *       *       *       *  I stood in the port breathing the warm air redolent with exotic new scents and yawped like an idiot, trying to make sense of the huge banner strung a hundred yards across one whole side of the little village. The banner read:      WELCOME, HANS! WELCOME           ALBERT E.     WE KNEW YOU WERE COMING,              SO--  And near the center of the banner was the largest chocolate cake, or facsimile thereof, in all creation. It must have been ten feet high and twenty feet in diameter.  But Hans Larson wasn't amused by the cosmic gag. He galloped off that gang-plank like a love-sick gorilla. And I'm a comet's uncle if Tina wasn't there, racing out to meet him, Larson had guessed the truth, and no wonder he hadn't had the guts to test it beforehand!  By the time I got down, out and over to where they were all wrapped up mingling tears, I had it pretty well doped out myself.  I don't know why we had figured that all progress and improvement in interstellar flight would cease just because we had left earth. The eternal, colossal conceit of men, I guess.  When our last signal back to earth had given the okay sign, sure, they started building bigger ships and recruiting another crew. But by the time that the _Albert E. II_, was ready to take off for a more extended expedition, the _Larson Drive_ was now the _Larson-McKendrick Drive_, with a velocity of a full half the speed of light, some five times our velocity.  Somehow, Tina had managed to get herself in the party, as Hans had sensed she would. And the time-differential, as it worked out, wasn't serious at all. Tina had been only 32 when we left her on earth. Including the year and a half she had already been with the colony on New Columbia, she was still quite a bit younger than Hans, and just twice as pretty as the day of their separation.  The tremolo note was rising now, the soft, mystic pitch of excitement inherent in the new world.  I turned to Mac, who was grinning like to split his face. I said, \"Looks like you were wrong, old boy--about the impossibility of colonizing.\"  He nodded his head readily, but he wouldn't tear his eyes away from that monsterous, preposterous chocolate cake. The attraction, I discovered, was a little bevy of on-lookers who stood at its base. They were a dozen or more most attractive colonists in the younger age-bracket and unmistakably of the opposite sex.  Mac said, \"Yeah, I was wrong about colonizing prospects. Dead wrong. Aren't you glad?\"  And now the tremolo feeling split into a crescendo of sub-harmonics and overtones, a magnificent chord of attunement with life and humanity everywhere in the universe. And all at once I knew _I was glad_, happy as hell to see these people from the old hometown of earth."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/51435"],["title","The Business, As Usual (#1)"],["body","toy--\"  \"Would they give up on something of which they were 'pretty well' certain?\"  \"They'd have to. Teddy, here, certainly couldn't tell them anything. They'd say it was a joke and forget it....\" His voice barely sounded the last few words. He no longer believed them. A smile flickered upon his face. \"Gentlemen, you don't think they'd--\"  \"The Russians,\" said Blake, without emotion, \"would go off their rockers, sir. To be unable to explain a thing like this would devastate their morale. The Communist is a man who must hold all the aces. He'll shuffle and reshuffle until he gets them, too. Well, we're giving him a cold deck, sir. There are no aces for him to find.\"  \"Hmmm,\" said the President. \"As long as there's any doubt in their minds, they'll have to keep plugging at it, won't they! And since there's no solution--\" His smile grew calculating. \"Yes, yes I begin to see. It's a small thing, to be sure, but I find I must leap at the opportunity to stick a few ants in _their_ pants for a change.\"  \"It won't wipe them out,\" began the Secretary.  \"But it'll wear them down a little,\" Blake finished.  \"Done!\" said the President. \"How soon can we get Operation Frustration under way?\"  \"The plane is ready to leave right now,\" said the Secretary, with a small blush. \"I--I rather thought you'd see this thing our way.\"  The President frowned at this, then shrugged. \"Good enough. Let's get this bear into the air.\"  <tb>  \"You sure this plane will work?\" asked the President, averting his face from the spray of leaves caught up in the shrieking jet stream of the waiting plane.  \"It's too simple not to,\" said Blake, clutching the suitcase--on whose side a large red \"Top Secret\" had been stenciled--to his chest, and shouting over the scream of the plane. \"The radar-resistant device is nothing more than a radio-receiver that blankets the structure, making the entire plane a receiver. If it receives the radar impulses, they can't bounce back and make a blip on the enemy radar screens.\"  The President sighed. \"You make it sound almost too easy. Very well.\" He shook the man's hand. \"Good luck.\"  \"Thank you, sir,\" said Blake, patting the suitcase. \"I'll take good care of Teddy.\"  The President nodded and moved away. Blake boarded the jet, and, minutes later, the President was watching a last fading streamer of the twin exhausts dwindling upon the eastern horizon.  \"I shan't sleep till he's back,\" said the Secretary.  \"Nor I,\" said the President. \"I have the weirdest damned apprehension....\"  \"About what, sir?\" asked the Secretary, as they made their way from the field.  \"About the--\" the President looked around, then lowered his voice to a whisper--\"the Russians. There's something in their makeup we may have overlooked.\"  \"Impossible, sir,\" said the Secretary of Defense. \"Blake is our top psychologist.\"  \"I hope you're right. If this fails, I'd hate for it to be traced to us.\"  \"It can't be. The jacket was made in Japan, the boots in Mexico, the parachute in--\"  \"I know, I know,\" said the President. \"But if they _should_ trace it to us, we'll be a laughing-stock.\"  \"They won't,\" the Secretary assured him.  <tb>  Two days later, Blake was back, his manner jovial when he met in secret session once more with the two executives.  \"Couldn't have gone more perfectly, gentlemen,\" he said, rubbing his hands together and bouncing on his toes. \"We passed directly over Moscow, at a height of ten miles, on the stroke of midnight. The night was overcast and starless. Teddy was dropped through the bomb bay. I saw his parachute open myself. He's down there now, and we're sure to see signs any day now of the little cracks in the Iron Curtain.\"  \"You had no trouble with the enemy?\" the President asked, though the answer--since Blake was back alive--was obvious.  \"None,\" Blake said. \"The radar shield performed exactly as specified, sir. Not a blink of a searchlight nor a single ground-to-air rocket did we see. Perhaps, on hearing us pass by, they sent up an investigating plane or two, but we were long gone by then. That's the advantage of moving faster than the sound you make,\" he added pontifically.  \"I still feel we've overlooked something,\" said the President. \"In the back of my mind, a small voice keeps trying to remind me of something about the Russians, something that should have made me veto this whole scheme at the start.\"  Blake looked puzzled. \"What about them, sir? If it's in regard to their psychology, I can assure you--\"  \"I don't mean their psychology at _all_,\" said the President. \"No, wait--yes, I do, in a minor way. They must pursue this thing, no matter what, but--\"  A light glimmered, then burned brightly in the President's eyes, and he stood up and smacked his fist into his open palm. \"Of course!\" he said. \"Their methods!\"  \"Methods?\" asked Blake, a little nervously.  The President's reply was interrupted by a knock at the door. The three men exchanged a look; then the Secretary jabbed the button, and Jenkins came in.  \"This just came for you, sir,\" he said, handing the Secretary a small envelope, and making his exit silently.  The President waited impatiently as the envelope was torn open and its contents read. Then the Secretary's hands opened limply and the message fell upon the table.  \"Diplomatic note--Russian--Teddy,\" he whispered.  \"What!\" yelped the President. He snatched the paper from the table and read it, then sank into his chair once more, his face grim and eyes suspiciously moist. \"The dirty, lowdown, rotten....\"  Blake, hovering at tableside, hesitated a moment, then asked, \"What about Teddy? What's happened?\"  \"What we might have expected,\" said the Secretary dolefully.  \"You don't mean--\" Blake mumbled, horrified. He couldn't continue, just waited for the worst.  The President nodded miserably.  \"He's confessed.\""]]]
