He had fully expected to have the watch to carry home and display to his mother. As it was, he was in no hurry to go home, but remained for two hours skating with the other boys. He used his friend Linton's skates, Linton having an engagement which prevented his remaining.  It was five o'clock when Luke entered the little cottage which he called home. His mother, a pleasant woman of middle age, was spreading the cloth for supper. She looked up as he entered.  \"Well, Luke?\" she said inquiringly.  \"I haven't brought home the watch, mother,\" he said. \"Randolph Duncan won it by accident. I will tell you about it.\"  After he had done so, Mrs. Larkin asked thoughtfully. \"Isn't it a little singular that Tom should have got in your way?\"  \"Yes; I thought so at the time.\"  \"Do you think there was any arrangement between him and Randolph?\"  \"As you ask me, mother, I am obliged to say that I do.\"  \"It was a very mean trick!\" said Mrs. Larkin, resentfully.  \"Yes, it was; but poor Tom was well punished for it. Why, he's got a bunch on the back of his head almost as large as a hen's egg.\"  \"I don't pity him,\" said Mrs. Larkin.  \"I pity him, mother, for I don't believe Randolph will repay him for the service done him. If Randolph had met with the same accident I am not prepared to say that I should have pitied him much.\"  \"You might have been seriously injured yourself, Luke.\"  \"I might, but I wasn't, so I won't take that into consideration. However, mother, watch or no watch, I've got a good appetite. I shall be ready when supper is.\"  Luke sat down to the table ten minutes afterward and proved his words good, much to his mother's satisfaction.  While he is eating we will say a word about the cottage. It was small, containing only four rooms, furnished in the plainest fashion. The rooms, however, were exceedingly neat, and presented an appearance of comfort. Yet the united income of Mrs. Larkin and Luke was very small. Luke received a dollar a week for taking care of the schoolhouse, but this income only lasted forty weeks in the year. Then he did odd jobs for the neighbors, and picked up perhaps as much more. Mrs. Larkin had some skill as a dressmaker, but Groveton was a small village, and there was another in the same line, so that her income from this source probably did not average more than three dollars a week. This was absolutely all that they had to live on, though there was no rent to pay; and the reader will not be surprised to learn that Luke had no money to spend for watches.  \"Are you tired, Luke?\" asked his mother, after supper.  \"No, mother. Can I do anything for you?\"  \"I have finished a dress for Miss Almira Clark. I suppose she will want to wear it to church to-morrow. But she lives so far away, I don't like to ask you to carry it to her.\"  \"Oh, I don't mind. It won't do me any harm.\"  \"You will get tired.\"  \"If I do, I shall sleep the better for it.\"  \"You are a good son, Luke.\"  \"I ought to be. Haven't I got a good mother?\"  So it was arranged. About seven o'clock, after his chores were done--for there was some wood to saw and split--Luke set out, with the bundle under his arm, for the house of Miss Clark, a mile and a half away.  It was a commonplace errand, that on which Luke had started, but it was destined to be a very important day in his life. It was to be a turning-point, and to mark the beginning of a new chapter of experiences. Was it to be for good or ill? That we are not prepared to reveal. It will be necessary for the reader to follow his career, step by step, and decide for himself.  Of course, Luke had no thought of this when he set out. To him it had been a marked day on account of the skating match, but this had turned out a disappointment. He accomplished his errand, which occupied a considerable time, and then set out on his return. It was half-past eight, but the moon had risen and diffused a mild radiance over the landscape. Luke thought he would shorten his homeward way by taking a path through the woods. It was not over a quarter of a mile, but would shorten the distance by as much more. The trees were not close together, so that it was light enough to see. Luke had nearly reached the edge of the wood, when he overtook a tall man, a stranger in the neighborhood, who carried in his hand a tin box. Turning, he eyed Luke sharply.  \"Boy, what's your name?\" he asked.  \"Luke Larkin,\" our hero answered, in surprise.  \"Where do you live?\"  \"In the village yonder.\"  \"Will you do me a favor?\"  \"What is it, sir?\"  \"Take this tin box and carry it to your home. Keep it under lock and key till I call for it.\"  \"Yes, sir, I can do that. But how shall I know you again?\"  \"Take a good look at me, that you may remember me.\"  \"I think I shall know you again, but hadn't you better give me a name?\"  \"Well, perhaps so,\" answered the other, after a moment's thought. \"You may call me Roland Reed. Will you remember?\"  \"Yes, sir.\"  \"I am obliged to leave this neighborhood at once, and can't conveniently carry the box,\" explained the stranger. \"Here's something for your trouble.\"  Luke was about to say that he required no money, when it occurred to him that he had no right to refuse, since money was so scarce at home. He took the tin box and thrust the bank-bill into his vest pocket. He wondered how much it was, but it was too dark to distinguish.  \"Good night!\" said Luke, as the stranger turned away.  \"Good night!\" answered his new acquaintance, abruptly.  If Luke could have foreseen the immediate consequences of this apparently simple act, and the position in which it would soon place him, he would certainly have refused to take charge of the box. And yet in so doing it might have happened that he had made a mistake. The consequences of even our simple acts are oftentimes far-reaching and beyond the power of human wisdom to foreknow.  Luke thought little of this as, with the box under his arm, he trudged homeward.    CHAPTER V  LUKE RECEIVES AN INVITATION   \"What have you there, Luke?\" asked Mrs. Larkin, as Luke entered the little sitting-room with the tin box under his arm.  \"I met a man on my way home, who asked me to keep it for him.\"  \"Do you know the man?\" asked his mother, in surprise.  \"No,\" answered Luke.  \"It seems very singular. What did he say?\"  \"He said that he was obliged to leave the neighborhood at once, and could not conveniently carry the box.\"  \"Do you think it contains anything of value?\"  \"Yes, mother. It is like the boxes rich men have to hold their stocks and bonds. I was at the bank one day, and saw a gentleman bring in one to deposit in the safe.\"  \"I can't understand that at all, Luke. You say you did not know this man?\"  \"I never met him before.\"  \"And, of course, he does not know you?\"  \"No, for he asked my name.\"  \"Yet he put what may be valuable property in your possession.\"  \"I think,\" said Luke, shrewdly, \"he had no one else to trust it to. Besides, a country boy wouldn't be very likely to make use of stocks and bonds.\"  \"No, that is true. I suppose the tin box is locked?\"  \"Yes, mother. The owner--he says his name is Roland Reed--wishes it put under lock and key.\"  \"I can lock it up in my trunk, Luke.\"  \"I think that will be a good idea.\"  \"I hope he will pay you for your trouble when he takes away the tin box.\"  \"He has already. I forgot to mention it,\" and Luke drew from his vest pocket, the bank-note he had thrust in as soon as received. \"Why, it's a ten-dollar bill!\" he exclaimed. \"I wonder whether he knew he was giving me as much?\"  \"I presume so, Luke,\" said his mother, brightening up. \"You are in luck!\"  \"Take it, mother. You will find a use for it.\"  \"But, Luke, this money is yours.\"  \"No, it is yours, for you are going to take care of the box.\"  It was, indeed, quite a windfall, and both mother and son retired to rest in a cheerful frame of mind, in spite of Luke's failure in the race.  \"I have been thinking, Luke,\" said his mother, at the breakfast-table, \"that I should like to have you buy a Waterbury watch out of this money. It will only cost three dollars and a half, and that is only one-third.\"  \"Thank you, mother, but I can get along without the watch. I cared for it chiefly because it was to be a prize given to the best skater. All the boys know that I would have won but for the accident, and that satisfies me.\"  \"I should like you to have a watch, Luke.\"  \"There is another objection, mother. I don't want any one to know about the box or the money. If it were known that we had so much property in the house, some attempt might be made to rob us.\"  \"That is true, Luke. But I hope it won't be long before you have a watch of your own.\"  When Luke was walking, after breakfast, he met Randolph Duncan, with a chain attached to the prize watch ostentatiously displayed on the outside of his vest. He smiled complacently, and rather triumphantly, when he met Luke. But Luke looked neither depressed nor angry.  \"I hope your watch keeps good time, Randolph,\" he said.  \"Yes; it hasn't varied a minute so far. I think it will keep as good time as my silver watch.\"  \"You are fortunate to have two watches.\"  \"My father has promised me a gold watch when I am eighteen,\" said Randolph, pompously.  \"I don't know if I shall have any watch at all when I am eighteen.\"  \"Oh, well, you are a poor boy. It doesn't matter to you.\"  \"I don't know about that, Randolph. Time is likely to be of as much importance to a poor boy as to a rich boy.\"  \"Oh, ah! yes, of course, but a poor boy isn't expected to wear a watch.\"  Here the conversation ended. Luke walked on with an amused smile on his face.  \"I wonder how it would seem to be as"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/542"],["title","The Life of Me: An Autobiography (#1)"],["body","Papa used to live.\"  During the two years my parents farmed away from their own farm, they spent many days of hard work driving back and forth, building a house, clearing some of the land, and building fences on their land.  And of course they had to have a well drilled and put up a windmill and water tank.  At the end of that two years, they took their two children and moved into their new house on the first farm they had ever owned. And Papa, with the aid of an efficient helpmate, continued to improve the farm.  They built a big barn and shelters for cows, hogs, horses, poultry, a hack, buggy, harness, and other things. And the family continued to grow.  George was born in 1900 and a daughter in 1901.  George lived 26 months and died with the croup.  The daughter lived only two weeks.  Earl was born in 1902 and Joel in 1904.  This was the state of the family in 1906, the year Grandpa died in his home, and the year I was born.  Aunts, Uncles, and cousins lived on three sides of us, and Grandma lived in the big house a quarter-mile north of us.  My parents were getting quite a collection of children by this time.  And it is not always easy to find family hand-me-down names for that many kids.  So by the time the seventh one arrived they had to go outside the family for a name.  I don't know how far out they went but they came back with what I have always thought was a \"far out\" name, Clarence Edgar, and they pinned it on me.  I was born January 11, 1906, in Jones County, West Texas, in the middle of a large family.  Frank was eight years old when I was born, Susie was seven, Earl three, and Joel 16 months. There were three others born later, Albert, Ollie Mae, and William Robert.  So, as you can see, my parents thrived and grew rich--if you count children as wealth.  There were ten of us, eight of whom attained full size and strength.  Five years after I was born, we moved to another farm about a half-mile east.  Albert was born at the first place we lived and William Robert was born at the second farm.  I know Ollie Mae was born sometime in between those two boys, but I don't know where she was born.  I'm sure it wasn't between the two farms. Wherever it was, she became one of us and is still with us.  Mama told me that the $300 they paid Grandpa for the farm was the hardest debt they ever had to pay off.  Money was hard to come by for a young couple just starting out.  Mama also told me all about how her family had moved from Kentucky to Dallas County, Texas, then again to Grayson County, then back to Kentucky, then again to Dallas County, and finally to Oklahoma.  During all this time Mama's younger brother Hugh was trailing along two years behind her.  They were seven and nine years old when they moved back to their old home in Kentucky.  There were 200 acres in the farm, and these two kids had four years in which to explore the meadows, the hills, the streams, and the woodlands.  There were three springs of water, acres and acres of wild berries, wild nuts, cherries, peaches, apples, and papaws. There were many kinds of birds as well as coons and skunks.  And for delicious food, there were swamp rabbits and opossums.  I was a young boy when Mama first told me that Hugh was her favorite brother.  It didn't mean much to me at that time.  But after I was a grown man, she told in detail how she and Hugh had roamed together over the old farm during those four years, how they had picked wild berries, and how they had carried them to the store in Hodgensville and had sold them for ten cents a gallon.  Emma's older sister and an older brother had long since married and lived far away.  Henry was still at home but he was older than Emma and too busy at other things to be interested in that kid stuff.  No wonder Hugh was her favorite brother.  They had played together, explored together, and had grown up together.  When I was young I heard Mama tell that her brother Hugh was shot to death one day while out on his horse.  I didn't know whether the Gaddies were living in Kentucky, Texas, or Oklahoma when he got shot.  When I heard how Hugh had died, I was old enough to know about Kentucky moonshiners, Texas cattle rustlers, and Oklahoma desperadoes.  I wondered if any of them had played a part in his death, but I didn't ask any questions .  Mama told me later that Hugh was a cowboy, had gotten his pay and was riding home when a man shot him in the back and took his money.  I was sorry I had ever wondered.  Mama told me that her brother Henry and the blacks around Duncan were not very friendly toward each other.  At least one time, the blacks held hands and formed a human chain across the road to keep Henry from coming by.  But Henry whipped up his horses and drove right through the crowd.  After that he carried a long blacksnake whip to use on them if they ever got close to his wagon again.  Part of the tradition that was handed down to us from the Gaddies and the Johnsons was that there were only three things to drink-- water, sweet milk, and buttermilk.  You might include clabber if you like.  But then, clabber was more of an \"eat\" than a drink. Soda pop was for the wealthy and foolhardy, and coffee was not permitted for three reasons:  it cost money, it was unnecessary and it was not good for you.  Money was for necessities.  Any drinks stronger than these mentioned were strictly forbidden.  Even the sound of the word \"whiskey\" carried with it an inkling of sin and dishonor.  Whiskey without drunkenness was improbable, and drunkenness was about as low as a person could go.  Mama grew up to hate whiskey because of its effect on men and because it tasted bad.  However, there was always a jug of it under her father's bed--for medical use only.  Any symptom of disease was treated immediately with whiskey.  Mama hated the taste of it.  Mama told us about a man--perhaps an uncle--who was sick in bed and who was fond of whiskey.  As he lay in bed, a few friends and kinfolks stopped by to see him.  And one by one he asked them to mix him a little toddy.  They did.  And wouldn't you know it, five or six toddies all in one man at one time made the man forget he was sick on disease and it made him fairly sick on whiskey which was what he had planned to be.  After I came into the Johnson family, Mama's people lived so far away I didn't get to know much about them.  We didn't get around to visiting them much.  But I remember we did go to Duncan one time to visit some of them.  It seems that the trip was made in about the year of 1916.  We went in our 1914 model Reo car.  I guess I was about ten years old.  I don't remember much about the people we went to see, but I remember the white rabbits and prairie dogs they had for pets.  They were running all over the place.  I suppose it was Uncle Henry's place and I believe the pets were Leo's, Uncle Henry's son.  Leo was perhaps four years older than I was--maybe even more.  I think I met Mama's sister and her older brother, Will, a time or two; I'm not sure.  But Henry was the only one of them I ever really knew.  Henry and his wife, I think her name was Emma also, came to Hamlin to visit Mama and Papa a couple of times after I was married.  Then, when I was attending college in Arkansas, my wife, Ima, and our youngest son, Larry, and I stopped by to visit Uncle Henry two or three times.  During one of those visits, Uncle Henry went out into his garage and took a book from the bottom of an old trunk.  The book was similar to a ledger, about seven inches wide and ten inches long, with a flexible cover.  In the book were 54 songs, handwritten with pen and ink, most of them in my father's hand, a few written by my mother.  It was my father's book which he had carried to parties and singings while he lived in Oklahoma.  When he heard a song he liked, he would write the words in his book of songs.  Other boys and girls had their books of songs also, including Uncle Henry.  Uncle Henry also had a mother-in-law--or rather, I think it was his mother-in-law-to-be--who gave him trouble at times.  One time she got mad at him for some reason and burned his book of songs. So Papa loaned Henry his song book.  Then the Johnsons moved away to Texas before Henry returned the book.  When he was through with the book, Henry hesitated to make a 400 mile round trip in a covered wagon just to return a borrowed book.  So he didn't return it right away.  He put it away for safekeeping.  It was forgotten until Henry mentioned it during a visit to Texas to see Mama and Papa 50 years later  Mama was about 80 years old when Uncle Henry took the book from the old trunk and asked me to take it to her.  Papa had died many years before.  I have one copy of those songs and there is a copy of them filed away at the University of Arkansas in Fayetteville.  Neither the Johnsons nor the Gaddies had any part in the Oklahoma land rush.  That took place in 1889, a few years before either family arrived in Oklahoma.  I never once saw my Grandma Gaddie.  She passed away in Oklahoma in 1912.  She suffered a sunstroke and died two weeks later.  Some years after that, Grandpa Gaddie came to live with us in Texas.  I don't remember exactly when he came, but he passed away while we were living on the Exum place, and we moved from there in 1917.  He seemed quite old, maybe old ahead of his time because of hard work and the severity of life at that time in our history.  Anyhow, he could do light odd jobs about the farm.  There were always outside chores to be done.  We kids were glad to have him help us do them.  And he kept us kids company at times when there was no work to be done.  But Grandpa was much more of a stranger to us than Grandma Johnson was.  She lived only a half-mile away; we grew up with her.  But I guess we hadn't seen Grandpa Gaddie more than once or twice before he came to live with us.  Grandpa was never much of a bother in any way.  He was never bedfast and never had to be waited on.  It didn't take"]]]
