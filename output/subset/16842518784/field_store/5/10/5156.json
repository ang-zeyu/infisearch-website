He can tell you the--the rest.\"  \"I'll go for a doctor,\" said Curt. \"Who have you had? Louise will stay with you.\"  \"Don't bring a doctor. There's no escaping this. I've known it for months. Wait here with me, Curt. I'll be gone soon.\"  Curt stared with pity at the great scientist whose mind had so disintegrated. \"You need a doctor. I'll call a hospital, Johns Hopkins, if you want.\"  \"Wait, maybe you're right. I have no phone here. Get Dr. Wilson--the Judge Building, Towson--find his home address in a phone book.\"  \"Fine. I'll only be a little while.\"  He stepped to the door.  \"Curt! Take the lane down to the new road--behind the farm. Quicker--it cuts off a mile or so--go down through the orchard--\"  \"All right. Take it easy now. I'll be right back.\"  Curt frantically got dressed, ran down the stairs and out to the car. He wondered absently what had become of the cadaverous Brown, who seemed to have vanished from the premises.         *       *       *       *       *  The wheels spun gravel as he started the car and whipped it out of the driveway. Then he was on the stretch of lane leading through the grove. The moonless night was utterly dark, and the stream of light ahead of the car seemed the only living thing upon the whole landscape. He almost wished he had taken the more familiar road. To get lost now might mean death for Dell.  No traffic flowed past him in either direction. There were no buildings showing lights. Overwhelming desolation seemed to possess the countryside and seep into his soul. It seemed impossible that this lay close to the other highway with which he was familiar.  He strained his eyes into the darkness for signs of an all-night gas station or store from which he could phone. Finally, he resigned himself to going all the way to Towson. At that moment he glimpsed a spark of light far ahead.  Encouraged, Curt stepped on the gas. In less than ten minutes he was at the spot. He braked the car to a stop, and surveyed the building as he got out. It seemed more like a power substation than anything else. But there should be a telephone, at least.  He knocked on the door. Almost instantly, footsteps sounded within.  The door swung wide.  \"I wonder if I could use your--\" Curt began. He gasped. \"Brown! Dell's dying--we've got to get a doctor for him--\"  As if unable to comprehend, the hired man stared dumbly for a long moment. His hollow-cheeked face was almost skeletal in the light that flooded out from behind him.  Then from somewhere within the building came a voice, sharp with tension. \"Brown! What the devil are you doing? Shut that door!\"  That brought the figure to life. He whipped out a gun and motioned Curt inward. \"Step inside. We'll have to decide what to do with you when Carlson finds you're here.\"  \"What's the matter with you?\" Curt asked, stupefied. \"Dell's dying. He needs help.\"  \"Get in here!\"  Curt moved slowly forward. Brown closed the door behind him and motioned toward a closed door at the other end of a short hall. They opened it and stepped into a dimly lighted room.  Curt's eyes slowly adjusted and he saw what seemed to be a laboratory. It was so packed with equipment that there was scarcely room for the group of twelve or fifteen men jammed closely about some object with their backs to Curt and Brown.  Brown shambled forward like an agitated skeleton, breaking the circle. Then Curt saw that the object of the men's attention was a large cathode ray screen occupied by a single green line. There was a pip on it rising sharply near one side of the two-foot tube. The pip moved almost imperceptibly toward a vertical red marker over the face of the screen. The men stared as if hypnotized by it.         *       *       *       *       *  The newcomers' arrival, however, disturbed their attention. One man turned with an irritable growl. \"Brown, for heaven's sake--\"  He was a bony creature, even more cadaverous than Brown. He caught sight of Curt's almost indecently robust face. He gasped and swore.  \"Who is this? What's he doing here?\"  The entire montage of skull faces turned upon Curt. He heard a sharp collective intake of breath, as if his presence were some unforeseen calamity that had shaken the course of their incomprehensible lives.  \"This is Curtis Johnson,\" said Brown. \"He got lost looking for a doctor for Dell.\"  A mummylike figure rose from a seat before the instrument. \"Your coming is tremendously unfortunate, but for the moment we can do nothing about it. Sit here beside me. My name is Tarron Sark.\"  The man indicated a chair.  \"My friend, Dr. Dell, is dying,\" Curt snapped out, refusing to sit down. \"I've got to get help. I saw your light and hoped you'd allow me to use your phone. I don't know who you are nor what Dell's hired man is doing here with you. But you've got to let me go for help!\"  \"No.\" The man, Sark, shook his head. \"Dell is reconciled. He has to go. We are awaiting precisely the event you would halt--his death.\"  He had known it, Curt thought, from the moment he entered that room. Like vultures sitting on cliffs waiting for the death of their prey, these fantastic men let their glance slip back to the screen. The green line was a third of the way toward the red marker now, and moving more rapidly.  It was nightmare--meaningless--  \"I'm not staying,\" Curt insisted. \"You can't prevent me from helping Dell without assuming responsibility for his death. I demand you let me call.\"  \"You're not going to call,\" said Sark wearily. \"And we assumed responsibility for Dell's death long ago. Sit down!\"  Slowly Curt sank down upon the chair beside the stranger. There was nothing else to do. He was powerless against Brown's gun. But he'd bring them to justice somehow, he swore.  He didn't understand the meaning of the slowly moving pattern on the 'scope face, yet, as his eyes followed that pip, he sensed tension in the watching men that seemed sinister, almost murderous. How?  What did the inexorably advancing pip signify?         *       *       *       *       *  No one spoke. The room was stifling hot and the breathing of the circle of men was a dull, rattling sound in Curt's ears.  Quickly then, gathering sudden momentum, the pip accelerated. The circle of men grew taut.  The pip crossed the red line--and vanished.  Only the smooth green trace remained, motionless and without meaning.  With hesitant shuffling of feet, the circle expanded. The men glanced uncertainly at one another.  One said, \"Well, that's the end of Dell. We'll soon know now if we're on the right track, or if we've botched it. Carlson will call when he's computed it.\"  \"The end of Dell?\" Curt repeated slowly, as if trying to convince himself of what he knew had happened. \"The pip on the screen--that showed his life leaving him?\"  \"Yes,\" said Sark. \"He knew he had to go. And there are perhaps hundreds more like him. But Dell couldn't have told you of that--\"  \"What will we do with him?\" Brown asked abruptly.  \"If Dell is dead, you murdered him!\" Curt shouted.  A rising personal fear grew within him. They could not release him now, even though his story would make no sense to anybody. But they had somehow killed Dell, or thought they had, and they wouldn't hesitate to kill Curt. He thought of Louise in the great house with the corpse of Haman Dell--if, of course, he was actually dead. But that was nonsense....  \"Dell must have sent you to us!\" Sark said, as if a great mystery had suddenly been lifted from his mind. \"He did not have time to tell you everything. Did he tell you to take the road behind the farm?\"  Curt nodded bitterly. \"He told me it was the quickest way to get to a doctor.\"  \"He did? Then he knew even better than we did how rapidly he was slipping. Yes, this was the quickest way.\"  \"What are you talking about?\" Curt demanded.  \"Did Dell say anything at all about what he wanted of you?\"  \"It was all wild. Something about helping with some crazy plans to retreat from the scientific world. He was going to finish talking in the morning, but I guess it wouldn't have mattered. I realize now that he was sick and irrational.\"  \"Too sick to explain everything, but not irrational,\" Sark said thoughtfully. \"He left it to us to tell you, since you are to succeed him.\"  \"Succeed Dell? In what?\"         *       *       *       *       *  Sark suddenly flipped a switch on a panel at his right. A screen lighted with some fuzzy image. It cleared with a slight dial adjustment, and Curt seemed to be looking at some oddly familiar moonlit ruin.  \"An American city,\" said Sark, hurrying his words now. \"Any city. They are all alike. Ruin. Death. This one died thirty years ago.\"  \"I don't understand,\" Curt complained, bewildered. \"Thirty years--\"  \"At another point in the Time Continuum,\" said Sark. \"The future. Your future, you understand. Or, rather, _our_ present, the one you created for us.\"  Curt recoiled at the sudden venom in Sark's voice. \"The _future_?\" That was what they had in common with Dell--psychosis, systematic delusions. He had suspected danger before; now it was imminent and terrifying.  \"Perhaps you are one of those who regard your accomplishments with pride,\" Sark went on savagely, ignoring or unaware of Curt's fear and horror. \"That the hydrogen bombs smashed the cities, and the aerosols destroyed the remnants of humanity seems insignificant to you beside the high technical achievement these things represent.\"  Curt's throat was dry with panic. Irrelevantly, he recalled the pain-fired eyes of Dell and the dying scientist's words: \"The responsibility for the coming destruction of civilization lies at the doors of the scientist mercenaries--\"  \"Some of us _did_ manage to survive,\" said Sark, glaring at the scene of gaunt rubble. Curt could see the veins pounding beneath the thin flesh of his forehead. \"We lived for twenty years with the dream of rebuilding a world, the same dream that has followed all wars. But at last we knew that the dream was truly vain this"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/51082"],["title","Coming Attraction (#1)"],["body","New York buildings. Before it occurred to me that I would be going out again, I automatically tore a tab from the film strip under my shirt. I developed it just to be sure. It showed that the total radiation I'd taken that day was still within the safety limit. I'm not phobic about it, as so many people are these days, but there's no point in taking chances.  I flopped down on the day bed and stared at the silent speaker and the dark screen of the video set. As always, they made me think, somewhat bitterly, of the two great nations of the world. Mutilated by each other, yet still strong, they were crippled giants poisoning the planet with their dreams of an impossible equality and an impossible success.  I fretfully switched on the speaker. By luck, the newscaster was talking excitedly of the prospects of a bumper wheat crop, sown by planes across a dust bowl moistened by seeded rains. I listened carefully to the rest of the program (it was remarkably clear of Russian telejamming) but there was no further news of interest to me. And, of course, no mention of the Moon, though everyone knows that America and Russia are racing to develop their primary bases into fortresses capable of mutual assault and the launching of alphabet-bombs toward Earth. I myself knew perfectly well that the British electronic equipment I was helping trade for American wheat was destined for use in spaceships.         *       *       *       *       *  I switched off the newscast. It was growing dark and once again I pictured a tender, frightened face behind a mask. I hadn't had a date since England. It's exceedingly difficult to become acquainted with a girl in America, where as little as a smile, often, can set one of them yelping for the police--to say nothing of the increasing puritanical morality and the roving gangs that keep most women indoors after dark. And naturally, the masks which are definitely not, as the Soviets claim, a last invention of capitalist degeneracy, but a sign of great psychological insecurity. The Russians have no masks, but they have their own signs of stress.  I went to the window and impatiently watched the darkness gather. I was getting very restless. After a while a ghostly violet cloud appeared to the south. My hair rose. Then I laughed. I had momentarily fancied it a radiation from the crater of the Hell-bomb, though I should instantly have known it was only the radio-induced glow in the sky over the amusement and residential area south of Inferno.  Promptly at twenty-two hours I stood before the door of my unknown girl friend's apartment. The electronic say-who-please said just that. I answered clearly, \"Wysten Turner,\" wondering if she'd given my name to the mechanism. She evidently had, for the door opened. I walked into a small empty living room, my heart pounding a bit.  The room was expensively furnished with the latest pneumatic hassocks and sprawlers. There were some midgie books on the table. The one I picked up was the standard hard-boiled detective story in which two female murderers go gunning for each other.  The television was on. A masked girl in green was crooning a love song. Her right hand held something that blurred off into the foreground. I saw the set had a handie, which we haven't in England as yet, and curiously thrust my hand into the handie orifice beside the screen. Contrary to my expectations, it was not like slipping into a pulsing rubber glove, but rather as if the girl on the screen actually held my hand.  A door opened behind me. I jerked out my hand with as guilty a reaction as if I'd been caught peering through a keyhole.  She stood in the bedroom doorway. I think she was trembling. She was wearing a gray fur coat, white-speckled, and a gray velvet evening mask with shirred gray lace around the eyes and mouth. Her fingernails twinkled like silver.  It hadn't occurred to me that she'd expect us to go out.  \"I should have told you,\" she said softly. Her mask veered nervously toward the books and the screen and the room's dark corners. \"But I can't possibly talk to you here.\"  I said doubtfully, \"There's a place near the Consulate....\"  \"I know where we can be together and talk,\" she said rapidly. \"If you don't mind.\"  As we entered the elevator I said, \"I'm afraid I dismissed the cab.\"         *       *       *       *       *  But the cab driver hadn't gone for some reason of his own. He jumped out and smirkingly held the front door open for us. I told him we preferred to sit in back. He sulkily opened the rear door, slammed it after us, jumped in front and slammed the door behind him.  My companion leaned forward. \"Heaven,\" she said.  The driver switched on the turbine and televisor.  \"Why did you ask if I were a British subject?\" I said, to start the conversation.  She leaned away from me, tilting her mask close to the window. \"See the Moon,\" she said in a quick, dreamy voice.  \"But why, really?\" I pressed, conscious of an irritation that had nothing to do with her.  \"It's edging up into the purple of the sky.\"  \"And what's your name?\"  \"The purple makes it look yellower.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Just then I became aware of the source of my irritation. It lay in the square of writhing light in the front of the cab beside the driver.  I don't object to ordinary wrestling matches, though they bore me, but I simply detest watching a man wrestle a woman. The fact that the bouts are generally \"on the level,\" with the man greatly outclassed in weight and reach and the masked females young and personable, only makes them seem worse to me.  \"Please turn off the screen,\" I requested the driver.  He shook his head without looking around. \"Uh-uh, man,\" he said. \"They've been grooming that babe for weeks for this bout with Little Zirk.\"  Infuriated, I reached forward, but my companion caught my arm. \"Please,\" she whispered frightenedly, shaking her head.  I settled back, frustrated. She was closer to me now, but silent and for a few moments I watched the heaves and contortions of the powerful masked girl and her wiry masked opponent on the screen. His frantic scrambling at her reminded me of a male spider.  I jerked around, facing my companion. \"Why did those three men want to kill you?\" I asked sharply.  The eyeholes of her mask faced the screen. \"Because they're jealous of me,\" she whispered.  \"Why are they jealous?\"  She still didn't look at me. \"Because of him.\"  \"Who?\"  She didn't answer.  I put my arm around her shoulders. \"Are you afraid to tell me?\" I asked. \"What _is_ the matter?\"  She still didn't look my way. She smelled nice.  \"See here,\" I said laughingly, changing my tactics, \"you really should tell me something about yourself. I don't even know what you look like.\"  I half playfully lifted my hand to the band of her neck. She gave it an astonishingly swift slap. I pulled it away in sudden pain. There were four tiny indentations on the back. From one of them a tiny bead of blood welled out as I watched. I looked at her silver fingernails and saw they were actually delicate and pointed metal caps.  \"I'm dreadfully sorry,\" I heard her say, \"but you frightened me. I thought for a moment you were going to....\"  At last she turned to me. Her coat had fallen open. Her evening dress was Cretan Revival, a bodice of lace beneath and supporting the breasts without covering them.  \"Don't be angry,\" she said, putting her arms around my neck. \"You were wonderful this afternoon.\"  The soft gray velvet of her mask, molding itself to her cheek, pressed mine. Through the mask's lace the wet warm tip of her tongue touched my chin.  \"I'm not angry,\" I said. \"Just puzzled and anxious to help.\"  The cab stopped. To either side were black windows bordered by spears of broken glass. The sickly purple light showed a few ragged figures slowly moving toward us.  The driver muttered, \"It's the turbine, man. We're grounded.\" He sat there hunched and motionless. \"Wish it had happened somewhere else.\"  My companion whispered, \"Five dollars is the usual amount.\"  She looked out so shudderingly at the congregating figures that I suppressed my indignation and did as she suggested. The driver took the bill without a word. As he started up, he put his hand out the window and I heard a few coins clink on the pavement.  My companion came back into my arms, but her mask faced the television screen, where the tall girl had just pinned the convulsively kicking Little Zirk.  \"I'm so frightened,\" she breathed.         *       *       *       *       *  Heaven turned out to be an equally ruinous neighborhood, but it had a club with an awning and a huge doorman uniformed like a spaceman, but in gaudy colors. In my sensuous daze I rather liked it all. We stepped out of the cab just as a drunken old woman came down the sidewalk, her mask awry. A couple ahead of us turned their heads from the half revealed face, as if from an ugly body at the beach. As we followed them in I heard the doorman say, \"Get along, grandma, and watch yourself.\"  Inside, everything was dimness and blue glows. She had said we could talk here, but I didn't see how. Besides the inevitable chorus of sneezes and coughs (they say America is fifty per cent allergic these days), there was a band going full blast in the latest robop style, in which an electronic composing machine selects an arbitrary sequence of tones into which the musicians weave their raucous little individualities.  Most of the people were in booths. The band was behind the bar. On a small platform beside them, a girl was dancing, stripped to her mask. The little cluster of men at the shadowy far end of the bar weren't looking at her.  We inspected the menu in gold script on the wall and pushed the buttons for breast of chicken, fried shrimps and two scotches. Moments later, the serving bell tinkled. I opened the gleaming panel and took out our drinks.         *       *       *       *       *  The cluster of men at the bar filed off toward the door,"]]]
