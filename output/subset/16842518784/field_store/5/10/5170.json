I'm very pleased to meet you, Mr.--Mr.--\"  \"Hope for your sake,\" he said to me, \"that you aren't what you seem--tadpole brother to one of them husbandless anura.\"  \"_What?_\"  \"A 'nuran is a female looking to nest. Anura is a herd of same. Come from Flatfolk ways.\"  \"Flatfolk are the Venusian natives, aren't they? Are you a Venusian? What part of Venus do you come from? Why did you say you hope--\"  He chuckled and swung me up into one of the bunks that lined the lifeboat. \"Questions you ask,\" he said in his soft voice. \"Venus is a sharp enough place for a dryhorn, let alone a tadpole dryhorn with a boss-minded sister.\"  \"I'm not a dryleg,\" I told him proudly. \"_We're_ from Undersea.\"  \"_Dryhorn_, I said, not dryleg. And what's Undersea?\"  \"Well, in Undersea we called foreigners and newcomers drylegs. Just like on Venus, I guess, you call them dryhorns.\" And then I told him how Undersea had been built on the bottom of the Gulf of Mexico, when the mineral resources of the land began to give out and engineers figured that a lot could still be reached from the sea bottoms.         *       *       *       *       *  He nodded. He'd heard about the sea-bottom mining cities that were bubbling under protective domes in every one of the Earth's oceans just about the same time settlements were springing up on the planets.  He looked impressed when I told him about Mom and Pop being one of the first couples to get married in Undersea. He looked thoughtful when I told him how Sis and I had been born there and spent half our childhood listening to the pressure pumps. He raised his eyebrows and looked disgusted when I told how Mom, as Undersea representative on the World Council, had been one of the framers of the Male Desuffrage Act after the Third Atomic War had resulted in the Maternal Revolution.         *       *       *       *       *  He almost squeezed my arm when I got to the time Mom and Pop were blown up in a surfacing boat.  \"Well, after the funeral, there was a little money, so Sis decided we might as well use it to migrate. There was no future for her on Earth, she figured. You know, the three-out-of-four.\"  \"How's that?\"  \"The three-out-of-four. No more than three women out of every four on Earth can expect to find husbands. Not enough men to go around. Way back in the Twentieth Century, it began to be felt, Sis says, what with the wars and all. Then the wars went on and a lot more men began to die or get no good from the radioactivity. Then the best men went to the planets, Sis says, until by now even if a woman can scrounge a personal husband, he's not much to boast about.\"  The stranger nodded violently. \"Not on Earth, he isn't. Those busybody anura make sure of that. What a place! Suffering gridniks, I had a bellyful!\"  He told me about it. Women were scarce on Venus, and he hadn't been able to find any who were willing to come out to his lonely little islands; he had decided to go to Earth where there was supposed to be a surplus. Naturally, having been born and brought up on a very primitive planet, he didn't know \"it's a woman's world,\" like the older boys in school used to say.  The moment he landed on Earth he was in trouble. He didn't know he had to register at a government-operated hotel for transient males; he threw a bartender through a thick plastic window for saying something nasty about the length of his hair; and _imagine_!--he not only resisted arrest, resulting in three hospitalized policemen, but he sassed the judge in open court!  \"Told me a man wasn't supposed to say anything except through female attorneys. Told _her_ that where _I_ came from, a man spoke his piece when he'd a mind to, and his woman walked by his side.\"  \"What happened?\" I asked breathlessly.  \"Oh, Guilty of This and Contempt of That. That blown-up brinosaur took my last munit for fines, then explained that she was remitting the rest because I was a foreigner and uneducated.\" His eyes grew dark for a moment. He chuckled again. \"But I wasn't going to serve all those fancy little prison sentences. Forcible Citizenship Indoctrination, they call it? Shook the dead-dry dust of the misbegotten, God forsaken mother world from my feet forever. The women on it deserve their men. My pockets were folded from the fines, and the paddlefeet were looking for me so close I didn't dare radio for more munit. So I stowed away.\"         *       *       *       *       *  For a moment, I didn't understand him. When I did, I was almost ill. \"Y-you mean,\" I choked, \"th-that you're b-breaking the law right now? And I'm with you while you're doing it?\"  He leaned over the edge of the bunk and stared at me very seriously. \"What breed of tadpole are they turning out these days? Besides, what business do _you_ have this close to the hull?\"  After a moment of sober reflection, I nodded. \"You're right. I've also become a male outside the law. We're in this together.\"  He guffawed. Then he sat up and began cleaning his blaster. I found myself drawn to the bright killer-tube with exactly the fascination Sis insists such things have always had for men.  \"Ferdinand your label? That's not right for a sprouting tadpole. I'll call you Ford. My name's Butt. Butt Lee Brown.\"  I liked the sound of Ford. \"Is Butt a nickname, too?\"  \"Yeah. Short for Alberta, but I haven't found a man who can draw a blaster fast enough to call me that. You see, Pop came over in the eighties--the big wave of immigrants when they evacuated Ontario. Named all us boys after Canadian provinces. I was the youngest, so I got the name they were saving for a girl.\"  \"You had a lot of brothers, Mr. Butt?\"  He grinned with a mighty set of teeth. \"Oh, a nestful. Of course, they were all killed in the Blue Chicago Rising by the MacGregor boys--all except me and Saskatchewan. Then Sas and me hunted the MacGregors down. Took a heap of time; we didn't float Jock MacGregor's ugly face down the Tuscany till both of us were pretty near grown up.\"  I walked up close to where I could see the tiny bright copper coils of the blaster above the firing button. \"Have you killed a lot of men with that, Mr. Butt?\"  \"Butt. Just plain Butt to you, Ford.\" He frowned and sighted at the light globe. \"No more'n twelve--not counting five government paddlefeet, of course. I'm a peaceable planter. Way I figure it, violence never accomplishes much that's important. My brother Sas, now--\"         *       *       *       *       *  He had just begun to work into a wonderful anecdote about his brother when the dinner gong rang. Butt told me to scat. He said I was a growing tadpole and needed my vitamins. And he mentioned, very off-hand, that he wouldn't at all object if I brought him some fresh fruit. It seemed there was nothing but processed foods in the lifeboat and Butt was used to a farmer's diet.  Trouble was, he was a special kind of farmer. Ordinary fruit would have been pretty easy to sneak into my pockets at meals. I even found a way to handle the kelp and giant watercress Mr. Brown liked, but things like seaweed salt and Venusian mud-grapes just had too strong a smell. Twice, the mechanical hamper refused to accept my jacket for laundering and I had to wash it myself. But I learned so many wonderful things about Venus every time I visited that stowaway....  I learned three wild-wave songs of the Flatfolk and what it is that the native Venusians hate so much; I learned how you tell the difference between a lousy government paddlefoot from New Kalamazoo and the slaptoe slinker who is the planter's friend. After a lot of begging, Butt Lee Brown explained the workings of his blaster, explained it so carefully that I could name every part and tell what it did from the tiny round electrodes to the long spirals of transformer. But no matter what, he would never let me hold it.  \"Sorry, Ford, old tad,\" he would drawl, spinning around and around in the control swivel-chair at the nose of the lifeboat. \"But way I look at it, a man who lets somebody else handle his blaster is like the giant whose heart was in an egg that an enemy found. When you've grown enough so's your pop feels you ought to have a weapon, why, then's the time to learn it and you might's well learn fast. Before then, you're plain too young to be even near it.\"  \"I don't have a father to give me one when I come of age. I don't even have an older brother as head of my family like your brother Labrador. All I have is Sis. And _she_--\"  \"She'll marry some fancy dryhorn who's never been farther South than the Polar Coast. And she'll stay head of the family, if I know her breed of green shata. _Bossy, opinionated._ By the way, Fordie,\" he said, rising and stretching so the fish-leather bounced and rippled off his biceps, \"that sister. She ever....\"  And he'd be off again, cross-examining me about Evelyn. I sat in the swivel chair he'd vacated and tried to answer his questions. But there was a lot of stuff I didn't know. Evelyn was a healthy girl, for instance; how healthy, exactly, I had no way of finding out. Yes, I'd tell him, my aunts on both sides of my family each had had more than the average number of children. No, we'd never done any farming to speak of, back in Undersea, but--yes, I'd guess Evelyn knew about as much as any girl there when it came to diving equipment and pressure pump regulation.  How would I know that stuff would lead to trouble for me?         *       *       *       *       *  Sis had insisted I come along to the geography lecture. Most of the other girls who were going to Venus for husbands talked to each other during the lecture, but not _my_ sister! She hung on every word, took notes even, and asked enough questions to make the perspiring purser really work in those orientation periods.  \"I am very sorry, Miss Sparling,\" he said with pretty heavy sarcasm, \"but I cannot remember any of the agricultural products of the Macro Continent. Since the human population is well below one per thousand square miles, it "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/51150"],["title","Venus is a Man's World (#2)"],["body","readily be understood that the quantity of tilled soil, land or sub-surface, is so small that--Wait, I remember something. The Macro Continent exports a fruit though not exactly an edible one. The wild _dunging_ drug is harvested there by criminal speculators. Contrary to belief on Earth, the traffic has been growing in recent years. In fact--\"  \"Pardon me, sir,\" I broke in, \"but doesn't _dunging_ come only from Leif Erickson Island off the Moscow Peninsula of the Macro Continent? You remember, purser--Wang Li's third exploration, where he proved the island and the peninsula didn't meet for most of the year?\"  The purser nodded slowly. \"I forgot,\" he admitted. \"Sorry, ladies, but the boy's right. Please make the correction in your notes.\"  But Sis was the only one who took notes, and she didn't take that one. She stared at me for a moment, biting her lower lip thoughtfully, while I got sicker and sicker. Then she shut her pad with the final gesture of the right hand that Mom used to use just before challenging the opposition to come right down on the Council floor and debate it out with her.  \"Ferdinand,\" Sis said, \"let's go back to our cabin.\"  The moment she sat me down and walked slowly around me, I knew I was in for it. \"I've been reading up on Venusian geography in the ship's library,\" I told her in a hurry.  \"No doubt,\" she said drily. She shook her night-black hair out. \"But you aren't going to tell me that you read about _dunging_ in the ship's library. The books there have been censored by a government agent of Earth against the possibility that they might be read by susceptible young male minds like yours. She would not have allowed--this Terran Agent--\"  \"Paddlefoot,\" I sneered.  Sis sat down hard in our zoom-air chair. \"Now that's a term,\" she said carefully, \"that is used only by Venusian riffraff.\"  \"They're not!\"  \"Not what?\"  \"Riffraff,\" I had to answer, knowing I was getting in deeper all the time and not being able to help it. I mustn't give Mr. Brown away! \"They're trappers and farmers, pioneers and explorers, who're building Venus. And it takes a real man to build on a hot, hungry hell like Venus.\"  \"Does it, now?\" she said, looking at me as if I were beginning to grow a second pair of ears. \"Tell me more.\"  \"You can't have meek, law-abiding, women-ruled men when you start civilization on a new planet. You've got to have men who aren't afraid to make their own law if necessary--with their own guns. That's where law begins; the books get written up later.\"  \"You're going to _tell_, Ferdinand, what evil, criminal male is speaking through your mouth!\"  \"Nobody!\" I insisted. \"They're my own ideas!\"  \"They are remarkably well-organized for a young boy's ideas. A boy who, I might add, has previously shown a ridiculous but nonetheless entirely masculine boredom with political philosophy. I plan to have a government career on that new planet you talk about, Ferdinand--after I have found a good, steady husband, of course--and I don't look forward to a masculinist radical in the family. Now, who has been filling your head with all this nonsense?\"         *       *       *       *       *  I was sweating. Sis has that deadly bulldog approach when she feels someone is lying. I pulled my pulpast handkerchief from my pocket to wipe my face. Something rattled to the floor.  \"What is this picture of me doing in your pocket, Ferdinand?\"  A trap seemed to be hinging noisily into place. \"One of the passengers wanted to see how you looked in a bathing suit.\"  \"The passengers on this ship are all female. I can't imagine any of them that curious about my appearance. Ferdinand, it's a man who has been giving you these anti-social ideas, isn't it? A war-mongering masculinist like all the frustrated men who want to engage in government and don't have the vaguest idea how to. Except, of course, in their ancient, bloody ways. Ferdinand, who has been perverting that sunny and carefree soul of yours?\"  \"Nobody! _Nobody!_\"  \"Ferdinand, there's no point in lying! I demand--\"  \"I told you, Sis. I told you! And don't call me Ferdinand. Call me Ford.\"  \"Ford? _Ford?_ Now, you listen to me, Ferdinand....\"  After that it was all over but the confession. That came in a few moments. I couldn't fool Sis. She just knew me too well, I decided miserably. Besides, she was a girl.  All the same, I wouldn't get Mr. Butt Lee Brown into trouble if I could help it. I made Sis promise she wouldn't turn him in if I took her to him. And the quick, nodding way she said she would made me feel just a little better.  The door opened on the signal, \"Sesame.\" When Butt saw somebody was with me, he jumped and the ten-inch blaster barrel grew out of his fingers. Then he recognized Sis from the pictures.  He stepped to one side and, with the same sweeping gesture, holstered his blaster and pushed his green hood off. It was Sis's turn to jump when she saw the wild mass of hair rolling down his back.  \"An honor, Miss Sparling,\" he said in that rumbly voice. \"Please come right in. There's a hurry-up draft.\"  So Sis went in and I followed right after her. Mr. Brown closed the door. I tried to catch his eye so I could give him some kind of hint or explanation, but he had taken a couple of his big strides and was in the control section with Sis. She didn't give ground, though; I'll say that for her. She only came to his chest, but she had her arms crossed sternly.  \"First, Mr. Brown,\" she began, like talking to a cluck of a kid in class, \"you realize that you are not only committing the political crime of traveling without a visa, and the criminal one of stowing away without paying your fare, but the moral delinquency of consuming stores intended for the personnel of this ship solely in emergency?\"         *       *       *       *       *  He opened his mouth to its maximum width and raised an enormous hand. Then he let the air out and dropped his arm.  \"I take it you either have no defense or care to make none,\" Sis added caustically.  Butt laughed slowly and carefully as if he were going over each word. \"Wonder if all the anura talk like that. And _you_ want to foul up Venus.\"  \"We haven't done so badly on Earth, after the mess you men made of politics. It needed a revolution of the mothers before--\"  \"Needed nothing. Everyone wanted peace. Earth is a weary old world.\"  \"It's a world of strong moral fiber compared to yours, Mr. Alberta Lee Brown.\" Hearing his rightful name made him move suddenly and tower over her. Sis said with a certain amount of hurry and change of tone, \"What _do_ you have to say about stowing away and using up lifeboat stores?\"         *       *       *       *       *  He cocked his head and considered a moment. \"Look,\" he said finally, \"I have more than enough munit to pay for round trip tickets, but I couldn't get a return visa because of that brinosaur judge and all the charges she hung on me. Had to stow away. Picked the _Eleanor Roosevelt_ because a couple of the boys in the crew are friends of mine and they were willing to help. But this lifeboat--don't you know that every passenger ship carries four times as many lifeboats as it needs? Not to mention the food I didn't eat because it stuck in my throat?\"  \"Yes,\" she said bitterly. \"You had this boy steal fresh fruit for you. I suppose you didn't know that under space regulations that makes him equally guilty?\"  \"No, Sis, he didn't,\" I was beginning to argue. \"All he wanted--\"  \"Sure I knew. Also know that if I'm picked up as a stowaway, I'll be sent back to Earth to serve out those fancy little sentences.\"  \"Well, you're guilty of them, aren't you?\"  He waved his hands at her impatiently. \"I'm not talking law, female; I'm talking sense. Listen! I'm in trouble because I went to Earth to look for a wife. You're standing here right now because you're on your way to Venus for a husband. So let's.\"  Sis actually staggered back. \"Let's? Let's _what_? Are--are you daring to suggest that--that--\"  \"Now, Miss Sparling, no hoopla. I'm saying let's get married, and you know it. You figured out from what the boy told you that I was chewing on you for a wife. You're healthy and strong, got good heredity, you know how to operate sub-surface machinery, you've lived underwater, and your disposition's no worse than most of the anura I've seen. Prolific stock, too.\"  I was so excited I just had to yell: \"Gee, Sis, say _yes_!\"         *       *       *       *       *  My sister's voice was steaming with scorn. \"And what makes you think that I'd consider you a desirable husband?\"  He spread his hands genially. \"Figure if you wanted a poodle, you're pretty enough to pick one up on Earth. Figure if you charge off to Venus, you don't want a poodle, you want a man. I'm one. I own three islands in the Galertan Archipelago that'll be good oozing mudgrape land when they're cleared. Not to mention the rich berzeliot beds offshore. I got no bad habits outside of having my own way. I'm also passable good-looking for a slaptoe planter. Besides, if you marry me you'll be the first mated on this ship--and that's a splash most nesting females like to make.\"  There was a longish stretch of quiet. Sis stepped back and measured him slowly with her eyes; there was a lot to look at. He waited patiently while she covered the distance from his peculiar green boots to that head of hair. I was so excited I was gulping instead of breathing. Imagine having Butt for a brother-in-law and living on a wet-plantation in Flatfolk country!  But then I remembered Sis's level head and I didn't have much hope any more.  \"You know,\" she began, \"there's more to marriage than just--\"  \"So there is,\" he cut in. \"Well, we can try each other for taste.\" And he pulled her in, both of his great hands practically covering her slim, straight back.  Neither of them said anything for a bit after he let go. Butt spoke up first.  \"Now, me,\" he said, \"I'd vote yes.\"  Sis ran the tip of her tongue kind of delicately from side to side of "]]]
