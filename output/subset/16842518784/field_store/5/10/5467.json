The Persians deliberated and resolved when they      were intoxicated, and when they were sober reconsidered their      determinations.  Tacitus tells the same of the old Germans.  Germ,      c. 22.]  Hystaspes, the father of Darius, was an old man.  He answered: \"It seems to me, that the messengers of this wandering tribe have left us no choice.  We cannot go to war against desert wastes; but as our host is already under arms and our swords have lain long in their scabbards, war we must have.  We only want a few good enemies, and I know no easier work than to make them.\"  At these words the Persians broke into loud shouts of delight; but Croesus only waited till the noise had ceased to say: \"Hystaspes, you and I are both old men; but you are a thorough Persian and fancy you can only be happy in battle and bloodshed.  You are now obliged to lean for support on the staff, which used to be the badge of your rank as commander, and yet you speak like a hot-blooded boy.  I agree with you that enemies are easy enough to find, but only fools go out to look for them.  The man who tries to make enemies is like a wretch who mutilates his own body.  If the enemies are there, let us go out to meet them like wise men who wish to look misfortune boldly in the face; but let us never try to begin an unjust war, hateful to the gods.  We will wait until wrong has been done us, and then go to victory or death, conscious that we have right on our side.\"  The old man was interrupted by a low murmur of applause, drowned however quickly by cries of \"Hystaspes is right!  let us look for an enemy!\"  It was now the turn of the envoy Prexaspes to speak, and he answered laughing: \"Let us follow the advice of both these noble old men.  We will do as Croesus bids us and not go out to seek an enemy, but at the same time we will follow Hystaspes' advice by raising our claims and pronouncing every one our enemy, who does not cheerfully consent to become a member of the kingdom founded by our great father Cyrus.  For instance, we will ask the Indians if they would feel proud to obey your sceptre, Cambyses.  If they answer no, it is a sign that they do not love us, and whoever does not love us, must be our enemy.\"  \"That won't do,\" cried Zopyrus.  \"We must have war at any price.\"  \"I vote for Croesus,\" said Gobryas.  \"And I too,\" said the noble Artabazus.  \"We are for Hystaspes,\" shouted the warrior Araspes, the old Intaphernes, and some more of Cyrus's old companions-in-arms.  \"War we must have at any price,\" roared the general Megabyzus, the father of Zopyrus, striking the table so sharply with his heavy fist, that the golden vessels rang again, and some goblets even fell; \"but not with the Massagetac--not with a flying foe.\"  \"There must be no war with the Massagetae,\" said the high-priest Oropastes.  \"The gods themselves have avenged Cyrus's death upon them.\"  Cambyses sat for some moments, quietly and coldly watching the unrestrained enthusiasm of his warriors, and then, rising from his seat, thundered out the words: \"Silence, and listen to your king!\"  The words worked like magic on this multitude of drunken men.  Even those who were most under the influence of wine, listened to their king in a kind of unconscious obedience.  He lowered his voice and went on: \"I did not ask whether you wished for peace or war--I know that every Persian prefers the labor of war to an inglorious idleness--but I wished to know what answer you would give the Massagetan warriors.  Do you consider that the soul of my father--of the man to whom you owe all your greatness--has been sufficiently avenged?\"  A dull murmur in the affirmative, interrupted by some violent voices in the negative, was the answer.  The king then asked a second question: \"Shall we accept the conditions proposed by their envoys, and grant peace to this nation, already so scourged and desolated by the gods?\"  To this they all agreed eagerly.  \"That is what I wished to know,\" continued Cambyses.  \"To-morrow, when we are sober, we will follow the old custom and reconsider what has been resolved on during our intoxication.  Drink on, all of you, as long as the night lasts.  To-morrow, at the last crow of the sacred bird Parodar, I shall expect you to meet me for the chase, at the gate of the temple of Bel.\"  So saying, the king left the hall, followed by a thundering \"Victory to the king!\"  Boges had slipped out quietly before him.  In the forecourt he found one of the gardener's boys from the hanging-gardens.  \"What do you want here?\"  asked Boges.  \"I have something for the prince Bartja.\"  \"For Bartja?  Has he asked your master to send him some seeds or slips?\"  The boy shook his sunburnt head and smiled roguishly.  \"Some one else sent you then?\"  said Boges becoming more attentive.  \"Yes, some one else.\"  \"Ah! the Egyptian has sent a message to her brother-in-law?\"  \"Who told you that?\"  \"Nitetis spoke to me about it.  Here, give me what you have; I will give it to Bartja at once.\"  \"I was not to give it to any one but the prince himself.\"  \"Give it to me; it will be safer in my hands than in yours.\"  \"I dare not.\"  \"Obey me at once, or--\"  At this moment the king came up.  Boges thought a moment, and then called in a loud voice to the whip-bearers on duty at the palace-gate, to take the astonished boy up.  \"What is the matter here?\"  asked Cambyses.  \"This fellow,\" answered the eunuch, \"has had the audacity to make his way into the palace with a message from your consort Nitetis to Bartja.\"  At sight of the king, the boy had fallen on his knees, touching the ground with his forehead.  Cambyses looked at him and turned deadly pale.  Then, turning to the eunuch, he asked: \"What does the Egyptian Princess wish from my brother?\"  \"The boy declares that he has orders to give up what has been entrusted to him to no one but Bartja.\"  On hearing this the boy looked imploringly up at the king, and held out a little papyrus roll.  Cambyses snatched it out of his hand, but the next moment stamped furiously on the ground at seeing that the letter was written in Greek, which he could not read.  He collected himself, however, and, with an awful look, asked the boy who had given him the letter.  \"The Egyptian lady's waiting-woman Mandane,\" he answered; \"the Magian's daughter.\"  \"For my brother Bartja?\"  \"She said I was to give the letter to the handsome prince, before the banquet, with a greeting from her mistress Nitetis, and I was to tell him .  .  .\"  Here the king stamped so furiously, that the boy was frightened and could only stammer: \"Before the banquet the prince was walking with you, so I could not speak to him, and now I am waiting for him here, for Mandane promised to give me a piece of gold if I did what she told me cleverly.\"  \"And that you have not done,\" thundered the king, fancying himself shamefully deceived.  \"No, indeed you have not.  Here, guards, seize this fellow!\"  The boy begged and prayed, but all in vain; the whip-bearers seized him quick as thought, and Cambyses, who went off at once to his own apartments, was soon out of reach of his whining entreaties for mercy.  Boges followed his master, rubbing his fat hands, and laughing quietly to himself.  The king's attendants began their work of disrobing him, but he told them angrily to leave him at once.  As soon as they were gone, he called Boges and said in a low voice: \"From this time forward the hanging-gardens and the Egyptian are under your control.  Watch her carefully!  If a single human being or a message reaches her without my knowledge, your life will be the forfeit.\"  \"But if Kassandane or Atossa should send to her?\"  \"Turn the messengers away, and send word that every attempt to see or communicate with Nitetis will be regarded by me as a personal offence.\"  \"May I ask a favor for myself, O King?\"  \"The time is not well chosen for asking favors.\"  \"I feel ill.  Permit some one else to take charge of the hanging-gardens for to-morrow only.\"  \"No!--now leave me.\"  \"I am in a burning fever and have lost consciousness three times during the day--if when I am in that state any one should  .  .  .\"  But who could take your place?\"  \"The Lydian captain of the eunuchs, Kandaules.  He is true as gold, and inflexibly severe.  One day of rest would restore me to health.  Have mercy, O King!\"  \"No one is so badly served as the king himself.  Kandaules may take your place to-morrow, but give hum the strictest orders, and say that the slightest neglect will put his life in danger.--Now depart.\"  \"Yet one word, my King: to-morrow night the rare blue lily in the hanging-gardens will open.  Hystaspes, Intaphernes, Gobyras, Croesus and Oropastes, the greatest horticulturists at your court, would very much like to see it.  May they be allowed to visit the gardens for a few minutes?  Kandaules shall see that they enter into no communication with the Egyptian.\"  \"Kandaules must keep his eyes open, if he cares for his own life.--Go!\"  Boges made a deep obeisance and left the king's apartment.  He threw a few gold pieces to the slaves who bore the torches before him.  He was so very happy.  Every thing had succeeded beyond his expectations:--the fate of Nitetis was as good as decided, and he held the life of Kandaules, his hated colleague, in his own hands.  Cambyses spent the night in pacing up and down his apartment.  By cock- crow he had decided that Nitetis should be forced to confess her guilt, and then be sent into the great harem to wait on the concubines.  Bartja, the destroyer of his happiness, should set off at once for Egypt, and on his return become the satrap of some distant provinces.  He did not wish to incur the guilt of a brother's murder, but he knew his own temper too well not to fear that in a moment of sudden anger, he might kill one he hated so much, and therefore wished to remove him out of the reach of his passion.  Two hours after the sun had risen,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5456"],["title","An Egyptian Princess â€” Volume 07 (#1)"],["body","a troop of the guards appeared in sight.  The captain of the whip-bearers went up to their commander, and, seconded by the shouts of the crowd, begged him to escort the stranger to the palace.  During this colloquy the traveller had mounted his servant's horse, and now followed in the wake of the Persians.  The good news flew like wind through the huge city.  As the riders proceeded, the crowd fell back more willingly, and loader and fuller grew the shouts of joy until at last their march was like a triumphal procession.  In a few minutes they drew up before the palace; but before the brazen gates had opened to admit them, another train came slowly into sight.  At the head rode a grey-headed old man; his robes were brown, and rent, in token of mourning, the mane and tail of his horse had been shorn off and the creature colored blue.--It was Hystaspes, coming to entreat mercy for his son.  The whip-bearer, delighted at this sight, threw himself down before the old man with a cry of joy, and with crossed arms told him what confidence the traveller had inspired him with.  Hystaspes beckoned to the stranger; he rode up, bowed gracefully and courteously to the old man, without dismounting, and confirmed the words of the whip bearer.  Hystaspes seemed to feel fresh confidence too after hearing the stranger, for he begged him to follow him into the palace and to wait outside the door of the royal apartment, while he himself, conducted by the head chamberlain, went in to the king.  When his old kinsman entered, Cambyses was lying on his purple couch, pale as death.  A cup-bearer was kneeling on the ground at his feet, trying to collect the broken fragments of a costly Egyptian drinking-cup which the king had thrown down impatiently because its contents had not pleased his taste.  At some distance stood a circle of court-officials, in whose faces it was easy to read that they were afraid of their ruler's wrath, and preferred keeping as far from him as possible.  The dazzling light and oppressive heat of a Babylonian May day came in through the open windows, and not a sound was to be heard in the great room, except the whining of a large dog of the Epirote breed, which had just received a tremendous kick from Cambyses for venturing to fawn on his master, and was the only being that ventured to disturb the solemn stillness.  Just before Hystaspes was led in by the chamberlain, Cambyses had sprung up from his couch.  This idle repose had become unendurable, he felt suffocated with pain and anger.  The dog's howl suggested a new idea to his poor tortured brain, thirsting for forgetfulness.  \"We will go out hunting!\"  he shouted to the poor startled courtiers. The master of the hounds, the equerries, and huntsmen hastened to obey his orders.  He called after them, \"I shall ride the unbroken horse Reksch; get the falcons ready, let all the dogs out and order every one to come, who can throw a spear.  We'll clear the preserves!\"  He then threw himself down on his divan again, as if these words had quite exhausted his powerful frame, and did not see that Hystaspes had entered, for his sullen gaze was fixed on the motes playing in the sunbeams that glanced through the window.  Hystaspes did not dare to address him; but he stationed himself in the window so as to break the stream of motes and thus draw attention to himself.  At first Cambyses looked angrily at him and his rent garments, and then asked with a bitter smile; \"What do you want?\"  \"Victory to the king!  Your poor servant and uncle has come to entreat his ruler's mercy.\"  \"Then rise and go!  You know that I have no mercy for perjurers and false swearers.  'Tis better to have a dead son than a dishonorable one.\"  \"But if Bartja should not be guilty, and Darius .  .  .\"  \"You dare to question the justice of my sentence?\"  \"That be far from me.  Whatever the king does is good, and cannot be gainsaid; but still .  .  .\"  \"Be silent!  I will not hear the subject mentioned again.  You are to be pitied as a father; but have these last few hours brought me any joy? Old man, I grieve for you, but I have as little power to rescind his punishment as you to recall his crime.\"  \"But if Bartja really should not be guilty--if the gods .  .  .\"  \"Do you think the gods will come to the help of perjurers and deceivers?\"  \"No, my King; but a fresh witness has appeared.\"  \"A fresh witness?  Verily, I would gladly give half my kingdom, to be convinced of the innocence of men so nearly related to me.\"  \"Victory to my lord, the eye of the realm!  A Greek is waiting outside, who seems, to judge by his figure and bearing, one of the noblest of his race.\"  The king laughed bitterly: \"A Greek!  Ah, ha!  perhaps some relation to Bartja's faithful fair one!  What can this stranger know of my family affairs?  I know these beggarly Ionians well.  They are impudent enough to meddle in everything, and think they can cheat us with their sly tricks.  How much have you had to pay for this new witness, uncle?  A Greek is as ready with a lie as a Magian with his spells, and I know they'll do anything for gold.  I'm really curious to see your witness. Call him in.  But if he wants to deceive me, he had better remember that where the head of a son of Cyrus is about to fall, a Greek head has but very little chance.\"  And the king's eyes flashed with anger as he said these words.  Hystaspes, however, sent for the Greek.  Before he entered, the chamberlains fastened the usual cloth before his mouth, and commanded him to cast himself on the ground before the king. The Greek's bearing, as he approached, under the king's penetrating glance, was calm and noble; he fell on his face, and, according to the Persian custom, kissed the ground.  His agreeable and handsome appearance, and the calm and modest manner in which he bore the king's gaze, seemed to make a favorable impression on the latter; he did not allow him to remain long on the earth, and asked him in a by no means unfriendly tone: \"Who are you?\"  \"I am a Greek nobleman.  My name is Phanes, and Athens is my home.  I have served ten years as commander of the Greek mercenaries in Egypt, and not ingloriously.\"  \"Are you the man, to whose clever generalship the Egyptians were indebted for their victories in Cyprus?\"  \"I am.\"  \"What has brought you to Persia?\"  \"The glory of your name, Cambyses, and the wish to devote my arms and experience to your service.\"  \"Nothing else?  Be sincere, and remember that one single lie may cost your life.  We Persians have different ideas of truth from the Greeks.\"  \"Lying is hateful to me too, if only, because, as a distortion and corruption of what is noblest, it seems unsightly in my eyes.\"  \"Then speak.\"  \"There was certainly a third reason for my coming hither, which I should like to tell you later.  It has reference to matters of the greatest importance, which it will require a longer time to discuss; but to-day--\"  \"Just to-day I should like to hear something new.  Accompany me to the chase.  You come exactly at the right time, for I never had more need of diversion than now.\"  \"I will accompany you with pleasure, if.  .  .\"  \"No conditions to the king!  Have you had much practice in hunting?\"  \"In the Libyan desert I have killed many a lion.\"  \"Then come, follow me.\"  In the thought of the chase the king seemed to have thrown off all his weakness and roused himself to action; he was just leaving the hall, when Hystaspes once more threw himself at his feet, crying with up-raised hands: \"Is my son--is your brother, to die innocent?  By the soul of your father, who used to call me his truest friend, I conjure you to listen to this noble stranger.\"  Cambyses stood still.  The frown gathered on his brow again, his voice sounded like a menace and his eyes flashed as he raised his hand and said to the Greek: \"Tell me what you know; but remember that in every untrue word, you utter your own sentence of death.\"  Phanes heard this threat with the greatest calmness, and answered, bowing gracefully as he spoke: \"From the sun and from my lord the king, nothing can be hid.  What power has a poor mortal to conceal the truth from one so mighty?  The noble Hystaspes has said, that I am able to prove your brother innocent.  I will only say, that I wish and hope I may succeed in accomplishing anything so great and beautiful.  The gods have at least allowed me to discover a trace which seems calculated to throw light on the events of yesterday; but you yourself must decide whether my hopes have been presumptuous and my suspicions too easily aroused.  Remember, however, that throughout, my wish to serve you has been sincere, and that if I have been deceived, my error is pardonable; that nothing is perfectly certain in this world, and every man believes that to be infallible which seems to him the most probable.\"  \"You speak well, and remind me of .  .  .  curse her! there, speak and have done with it!  I hear the dogs already in the court.\"  \"I was still in Egypt when your embassy came to fetch Nitetis.  At the house of Rhodopis, my delightful, clever and celebrated countrywoman, I made the acquaintance of Croesus and his son; I only saw your brother and his friends once or twice, casually; still I remembered the young prince's handsome face so well, that some time later, when I was in the workshop of the great sculptor Theodorus at Samos, I recognized his features at once.\"  \"Did you meet him at Samos?\"  \"No, but his features had made such a deep and faithful impression on Theodorus' memory, that he used them to beautify the head of an Apollo, which the Achaemenidae had ordered for the new temple of Delphi.\"  \"Your tale begins, at least, incredibly enough.  How is it possible to copy features so exactly, when you have not got them before you?\"  \"I can only answer that Theodorus has really completed this master-piece, and if you wish for a proof of his skill would gladly send you a second likeness of .  .  .\"  \"I have no desire for"]]]
