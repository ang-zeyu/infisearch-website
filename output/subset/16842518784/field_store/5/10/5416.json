[[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/538"],["title","Jean of the Lazy A (#2)"],["body",", and Lite said he didn't know. Neither of them said anything about the effect it would have upon their future; I don't suppose that Jean, at least, could remotely guess at the effect.  It is certain that Lite preferred not to do so.  They were no more than half way to town when they met a group of galloping horsemen, their coming heralded for a mile by the dust they kicked out of the trail.  In the midst rode Jean's father.  Alongside him rode the coroner, and behind him rode the sheriff. The rest of the company was made up of men who had heard the news and were coming to look upon the tragedy.  Lite drew a long breath of relief.  Aleck Douglas, then, had not been running away.    CHAPTER II  CONCERNING LITE AND A FEW FOOTPRINTS  \"Lucky you was with me all day, up to four o'clock, Lite,\" Jim said. \"That lets you out slick and clean, seeing the doctor claims he'd been dead six hours when he seen him last night.  Crofty--why, Crofty was laying in there dead when I was talking about him to you!  Kinda gives a man the creeps to think of it.  Who do you reckon done it, Lite?\"  \"How'n hell do _I_ know?\" Lite retorted irritably. \"I didn't see it done.\"  Jim studied awhile, an ear cocked for the signal that the coroner was ready to begin the inquest.  \"Say,\" he leaned over and whispered in Lite's ear, \"where was Aleck at, all day yesterday?\"  \"Riding over in the bend, looking for black-leg signs,\" said Lite promptly.  \"Packed a lunch, same as I did.\"  The answer seemed to satisfy Jim and to eliminate from his mind any slight suspicion he may have held, but Lite had a sudden impulse to improve upon his statement.  \"I saw Aleck ride into the ranch as I was coming home,\" he said.  As he spoke, his face lightened as with a weight lifted from his mind.  Later, when the coroner questioned him about his movements and the movements of Aleck, Lite repeated the lie as casually as possible.  It might have carried more weight with the jury if Aleck Douglas himself had not testified, just before then, that he had returned about three o'clock to the ranch and pottered around the corral with the mare and colt, and unsaddled his horse before going into the house at all.  It was only when he had discovered Johnny Croft's horse at the haystack, he said, that he began to wonder where the rider could be.  He had gone to the house--and found him on the kitchen floor.  Lite had not heard this statement, for the simple reason that, being a closely interested person, he had been invited to remain outside while Aleck Douglas testified.  He wondered why the jury,--men whom he knew and had known for years, most of them,--looked at one another so queerly when he declared that he had seen Aleck ride home.  The coroner also had given him a queer look, but he had not made any comment. Aleck, too, had turned his head and stared at Lite in a way which Lite preferred to think he had not understood.  Beyond that one statement which had produced such a curious effect, Lite did not have anything to say that shed the faintest light upon the matter.  He told where he had been, and that he had discovered the body just before Jean arrived, and that he had immediately started with her to town.  The coroner did not cross-question him.  Counting from four o'clock, which Jim had already named as the time of their separation, Lite would have had just about time to do the things he testified to doing.  The only thing he claimed to have done and could not possibly have done, was to see Aleck Douglas riding into the coulee.  Aleck himself had branded that a lie before Lite had ever uttered it.  The result was just what was to be expected.  Aleck Douglas was placed under arrest, and as a prisoner he rode back to town alongside the sheriff,--an old friend of his, by the way,--to where Jean waited impatiently for news.  It was Lite who told her.  \"It'll come out all right,\" he said, in his calm way that might hide a good deal of emotion beneath it.  \"It's just to have something to work from,--don't mean anything in particular. It's a funny way the law has got,\" he explained, \"of arresting the last man that saw a fellow alive, or the first one that sees him dead.\"  Jean studied this explanation dolefully.  \"They ought to find out the last one that saw him alive,\" she said resentfully, \"and arrest him, then,--and leave dad out of it.  There's no sense in the law, if that's the way it works.\"  \"Well, I didn't make the law,\" Lite observed, in a tone that made Jean look up curiously into his face.  \"Why don't they find out who saw him last?\" she repeated.  \"Somebody did.  Somebody must have gone there with him.  Lite, do you know that Art Osgood came into town with his horse all in a lather of sweat, and took the afternoon train yesterday?  I saw him.  I met him square in the middle of the street, and he didn't even look at me.  He was in a frightful hurry, and he looked all upset.  If I was the law, I'd leave dad alone and get after Art Osgood.  He acted to me,\" she added viciously, \"exactly as if he were running away!\"  \"He wasn't, though.  Jim told me Art was going to leave yesterday; that was in the forenoon.  He's going to Alaska,--been planning it all spring.  And Carl said he was with Art till Art left to catch the train. Somebody else from town here had seen him take the train, and asked about him.  No, it wasn't Art.\"  \"Well, who was it, then?\"  Never before had Lite failed to tell Jean just what she wanted to know. He failed now, and he went away as though he was glad to put distance between them. He did not know what to think.  He did not want to think. Certainly he did not want to talk, to Jean especially.  For lies never came easily to the tongue of Lite Avery.  It was all very well to tell Jean that he didn't know who it was; he did tell her so, and made his escape before she could read in his face the fear that he did know.  It was not so easy to guard his fear from the keen eyes of his fellows, with whom he must mingle and discuss the murder, or else pay the penalty of having them suspect that he knew a great deal more about it than he admitted.  Several men tried to stop him and talk about it, but he put them off. He was due at the ranch, he said, to look after the stock.  He didn't know a thing about it, anyway.  Lazy A coulee, when he rode into it, seemed to wear already an air of depression, foretaste of what was to come.  The trail was filled with hoofprints, and cut deep with the wagon that had borne the dead man to town and to an unwept burial.  At the gate he met Carl Douglas, riding with his head sunk deep on his chest.  Lite would have avoided that meeting if he could have done so unobtrusively, but as it was, he pulled up and waited while Carl opened the wire gate and dragged it to one side.  From the look of his face, Carl also would have avoided the meeting, if he could have done so.  He glanced up as Lite passed through.  \"Hell of a verdict,\" Lite made brief comment when he met Carl's eyes.  Carl stopped, leaning against his horse with one hand thrown up to the saddle-horn.  He was a small man, not at all like Aleck in size or in features.  He looked haggard now and white.  \"What do you make of it?\" he asked Lite.  \"Do you believe--?\"  \"Of course I don't!  Great question for a brother to ask,\" Lite retorted sharply.  \"It's not in Aleck to do a thing like that.\"  \"What made you say you saw him ride home?  You didn't, did you?\"  \"You heard what I said; take it or leave it.\"  Lite scowled down at Carl.  \"What was there queer about it?  Why--\"  \"If you'd been inside ten minutes before then,\" Carl told him bluntly, \"you'd have heard Aleck say he came home a full hour or more before you say you saw him ride in.  That's what's queer.  What made you do that? It won't help Aleck none.\"  \"Well, what are you going to do about it?\" Lite slouched miserably in the saddle, and eyed the other without really seeing him at all.  \"They can't prove anything on Aleck,\" he added with faint hope.  \"I don't see myself how they can.\"  Carl brightened perceptibly.  \"His being alone all day is bad; he can't furnish the alibi you can furnish. But they can't prove anything.  They'll turn him loose, the grand jury will; they'll have to.  They can't indict him on the evidence. They haven't got any evidence,--not any more than just the fact that he rode in with the news.  No need to worry; he'll be turned loose in a few days.\"  He picked up the gate, dragged it after him as he went through, and fumbled the wire loop into place over the post.  \"I wish,\" he said when he had mounted with the gate between them, \"you hadn't been so particular to say you saw him ride home about the same time you did. That looks bad, Lite.\"  \"Bad for who?\" Lite turned in the saddle aggressively.  \"Looks bad all around.  I don't see what made you do that;--not when you knew Jim and Aleck had both testified before you did.\"  Lite rode slowly down the road to the stable, and cursed the impulse that had made him blunder so.  He had no compunctions for the lie, if only it had done any good.  It had done harm; he could see now that it had. But he could not believe that it would make any material difference in Aleck's case.  As the story had been repeated to Lite by half a dozen men, who had heard him tell it, Aleck's own testimony had been responsible for the verdict.  Men had told Lite plainly that Aleck was a fool not to plead self-defense, even in face of the fact that Johnny Croft had not drawn any weapon.  Jim had declared that Aleck could have sworn that Johnny reached for his gun.  Others admitted voluntarily that while it would be a pretty weak defense, it would beat the story Aleck had told.  Lite turned the mare and colt into a shed for the night.  He milked the two cows without giving any thought to what he was doing, and carried the milk to the kitchen door before he realized that it would be wasted, sitting in pans when the house would be empty. Still, it occurred to him that he might as"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5388"],["title","The Crisis — Volume 01 (#1)"],["body","es, sah.\"  \"How's my little sweetheart, Ephum?\"  \"Bress your soul, sah,\" said Ephum, his face falling perceptibly, \"bress your soul, sah, Miss Jinny's done gone to Halcyondale, in Kaintuck, to see her grandma. Ole Ephum ain't de same nigger when she's away.\"  The young Captain's face showed as much disappointment as the darkey's.  \"Cuss it!\" said he, strongly, \"if that ain't too bad! I brought her a Creole doll from New Orleans, which Madame Claire said was dressed finer than any one she'd ever seen. All lace and French gewgaws, Colonel. But you'll send it to her?\"  \"That I will, Lige,\" said the Colonel, heartily. \"And she shall write you the prettiest note of thanks you ever got.\"  \"Bless her pretty face,\" cried the Captain. \"Her health, Colonel! Here's a long life to Miss Virginia Carvel, and may she rule forever! How old did you say this was?\" he asked, looking into the glass.  \"Over half a century,\" said Colonel Carvel.  \"If it came from the ruins of Pompeii,\" cried Captain Brent, \"it might be worthy of her!\"  \"What an idiot you are about that child, Lige,\" said the Colonel, who was not hiding his pleasure. The Colonel could hide nothing. \"You ruin her!\"  The bluff young Captain put down his glass to laugh.  \"Ruin her!\" he exclaimed. \"Her pa don't ruin her I eh, Ephum? Her pa don't ruin her!\"  \"Lawsy, Marse Lige, I reckon he's wuss'n any.\"  \"Ephum,\" said the Colonel, pulling his goatee thoughtfully, \"you're a damned impertinent nigger. I vow I'll sell you South one of these days. Have you taken that letter to Mr. Renault?\" He winked at his friend as the old darkey faded into the darkness of the store, and continued: \"Did I ever tell you about Wilson Peale's portrait of my grandmother, Dorothy Carvel, that I saw this summer at my brother Daniel's, in Pennsylvania? Jinny's going to look something like her, sir. Um! She was a fine woman. Black hair, though. Jinny's is brown, like her Ma's.\" The Colonel handed a cigar to Captain Brent, and lit one himself. \"Daniel has a book my grandfather wrote, mostly about her. Lord, I remember her! She was the queen-bee of the family while she lived. I wish some of us had her spirit.\"  \"Colonel,\" remarked Captain Lige, \"what's this I heard on the levee just now about your shootin' at a man named Babcock on the steps here?\"  The Colonel became very grave. His face seemed to grow longer as he pulled his goatee.  \"He was standing right where you are, sir,\" he replied (Captain Lige moved), \"and he proposed that I should buy his influence.\"  \"What did you do?\"  Colonel Carvel laughed quietly at the recollection  \"Shucks,\" said he, \"I just pushed him into the streets gave him a little start, and put a bullet past his ear, just to let the trash know the sound of it. Then Russell went down and bailed me out.\"  The Captain shook with laughter. But Mr. Eliphalet Hopper's eyes were glued to the mild-mannered man who told the story, and his hair rose under his hat.  \"By the way, Lige, how's that boy, Tato? Somehow after I let you have him on the 'Louisiana', I thought I'd made a mistake to let him run the river. Easter's afraid he'll lose the little religion she taught him.\"  It was the Captain's turn to be grave.  \"I tell you what, Colonel,\" said he; \"we have to have hands, of course. But somehow I wish this business of slavery had never been started!\"  \"Sir,\" said the Colonel, with some force, \"God made the sons of Ham the servants of Japheth's sons forever and forever.\"  \"Well, well, we won't quarrel about that, sir,\" said Brent, quickly. \"If they all treated slaves as you do, there wouldn't be any cry from Boston-way. And as for me, I need hands. I shall see you again, Colonel.\"  \"Take supper with me to-night, Lige,\" said Mr. Carvel. \"I reckon you'll find it rather lonesome without Jinny.\"  \"Awful lonesome,\" said the Captain. \"But you'll show me her letters, won't you?\"  He started out, and ran against Eliphalet.  \"Hello!\" he cried. \"Who's this?\"  \"A young Yankee you landed here this morning, Lige,\" said the Colonel. \"What do you think of him?\"  \"Humph!\" exclaimed the Captain.  \"He has no friends in town, and he is looking for employment. Isn't that so, sonny?\" asked the Colonels kindly.  \"Yes.\"  \"Come, Lige, would you take him?\" said Mr. Carvel.  The young Captain looked into Eliphalet's face. The dart that shot from his eyes was of an aggressive honesty; and Mr. Hopper's, after an attempt at defiance, were dropped.  \"No,\" said the Captain.  \"Why not, Lige?\"  \"Well, for one thing, he's been listening,\" said Captain Lige, as he departed.  Colonel Carvel began to hum softly to himself:--      \"'One said it was an owl, and the other he said nay,      One said it was a church with the steeple torn away,      Look a' there now!'  \"I reckon you're a rank abolitionist,\" said he to Eliphalet, abruptly.  \"I don't see any particular harm in keepin' slaves,\" Mr. Hopper replied, shifting to the other foot.  Whereupon the Colonel stretched his legs apart, seized his goatee, pulled his head down, and gazed at him for some time from under his eyebrows, so searchingly that the blood flew to Mr. Hopper's fleshy face. He mopped it with a dark-red handkerchief, stared at everything in the place save the gentleman in front of him, and wondered whether he had ever in his life been so uncomfortable. Then he smiled sheepishly, hated himself, and began to hate the Colonel.  \"Ever hear of the Liberator?\"  \"No, sir,\" said Mr. Hopper.  \"Where do you come from?\" This was downright directness, from which there was no escape.  \"Willesden, Massachusetts.\"  \"Umph! And never heard of Mr. Garrison?\"  \"I've had to work all my life.\"  \"What can you do, sonny?\"  \"I cal'late to sweep out a store. I have kept books,\" Mr. Hopper vouchsafed.  \"Would you like work here?\" asked the Colonel, kindly. The green eyes looked up swiftly, and down again.  \"What'll you give me?\"  The good man was surprised. \"Well,\" said he, \"seven dollars a week.\"  Many a time in after life had the Colonel reason to think over this scene. He was a man the singleness of whose motives could not be questioned. The one and sufficient reason for giving work to a homeless boy, from the hated state of the Liberator, was charity. The Colonel had his moods, like many another worthy man.  The small specks on the horizon sometimes grow into the hugest of thunder clouds. And an act of charity, out of the wisdom of God, may produce on this earth either good or evil.  Eliphalet closed with the bargain. Ephum was called and told to lead the recruit to the presence of Mr. Hood, the manager. And he spent the remainder of a hot day checking invoices in the shipping entrance on Second Street.  It is not our place here to chronicle Eliphalet's faults. Whatever he may have been, he was not lazy. But he was an anomaly to the rest of the young men in the store, for those were days when political sentiments decided fervent loves or hatreds. In two days was Eliphalet's reputation for wisdom made. During that period he opened his mouth to speak but twice. The first was in answer to a pointless question of Mr. Barbo's (aetat 25), to the effect that he, Eliphalet Hopper, was a Pierce Democrat, who looked with complacency on the extension of slavery. This was wholly satisfactory, and saved the owner of these sentiments a broken head. The other time Eliphalet spoke was to ask Mr. Barbo to direct him to a boardinghouse.  \"I reckon,\" Mr. Barbo reflected, \"that you'll want one of them Congregational boarding-houses. We've got a heap of Yankees in the town, and they all flock together and pray together. I reckon you'd ruther go to Miss Crane's nor anywhere.\"  Forthwith to Miss Crane's Eliphalet went. And that lady, being a Greek herself, knew a Greek when she saw one. The kind-hearted Barbo lingered in the gathering darkness to witness the game which ensued, a game dear to all New Englanders, comical to Barbo. The two contestants calculated. Barbo reckoned, and put his money on his new-found fellow-clerk. Eliphalet, indeed, never showed to better advantage. The shyness he had used with the Colonel, and the taciturnity practised on his fellow-clerks, he slipped off like coat and waistcoat for the battle. The scene was in the front yard of the third house in Dorcas Row. Everybody knows where Dorcas Row was. Miss Crane, tall, with all the severity of side curls and bombazine, stood like a stone lioness at the gate. In the background, by the steps, the boarders sat, an interested group. Eliphalet girded up his loins, and sharpened his nasal twang to cope with hers. The preliminary sparring was an exchange of compliments, and deceived neither party. It seemed rather to heighten mutual respect.  \"You be from Willesden, eh?\" said Crane. \"I calculate you know the Salters.\"  If the truth were known, this evidence of an apparent omniscience rather staggered Eliphalet. But training stood by him, and he showed no dismay. Yes, he knew the Salters, and had drawed many a load out of Hiram Salters' wood-lot to help pay for his schooling.  \"Let me see,\" said Miss Crane, innocently; \"who was it one of them Salters girls married, and lived across the way from the meetin'-house?\"  \"Spauldin',\" was the prompt reply.  \"Wal, I want t' know!\" cried the spinster: \"not Ezra Spauldin'?\"  Eliphalet nodded. That nod was one of infinite shrewdness which commended itself to Miss Crane. These courtesies, far from making awkward the material discussion which followed; did not affect it in the least.  \"So you want me to board you?\" said she, as if in consternation.  Eliphalet calculated, if they could come to terms. And Mr. Barbo keyed himself to enjoyment.  \"Single gentlemen,\" said she, \"pay as high as twelve dollars.\" And she added that they had no cause to complain of her table.  Eliphalet said he guessed he'd have to go somewhere else. Upon this the lady vouchsafed the explanation that those gentlemen had high positions and rented her large rooms. Since Mr. Hopper was from Willesden and knew the Salters,"]]]
