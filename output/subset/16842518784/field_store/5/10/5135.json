Jeremiah Smith was allowed to go along as an observer, and Dexter was accorded a similar favor. By evening, everything was in place. The colonel's Cadillac, parked in the valley's center, had something of the aspect of a chrome-bedizened lamb resting on an altar of crab grass, buttercups and mustard weeds. Surrounding it were half a dozen floodlights, suspended over it was a microphone, standing next to it was a pole supporting three P.A. speakers, and located several hundred feet away was a TV camera. Beyond this impressive  display, Old Man Tillson's homestead could be discerned, and beyond the homestead rose his mountainous collection of beer bottles.  Colonel Mortby came out of the command-post tent and walked over to where Dexter and Jeremiah were standing, looking down into the valley. He handed each of them a pair of cobalt-blue glasses. \"If you watch the blast, make sure you wear these,\" he said, raising his voice above the amplified purring of the Cadillac's motor. \"You'll be glad to hear that the two VEMs are already on their way, Mr. Foote--our walkie-talkie squad just called in. However, the creatures move so slowly that they probably won't be here before dawn.\"  Dexter came out of a brown study. \"One thing still bugs me,\" he said. \"Why should two members of a race of extraterrestrials technically intelligent enough to build spaceships behave like a pair of gluttonous savages the minute they land on another planet?\"  \"But you explained that,\" Jeremiah pointed out. \"They just can't resist eating American automobiles.\"  \"I'm afraid I got carried away by my analogy. Civilized beings simply don't go running across the countryside the minute they land, and start grabbing up everything that strikes their eye. They make contact with the authorities first, and _then_ they go running across the countryside and start grabbing up everything that strikes their eye.\"  Colonel Mortby grinned. \"You've got a good point there, Mr. Foote. Well, I'm going to see if I can't grab forty winks or so--it's been a trying day.\"  \"Me too,\" Jeremiah said, heading for his model A.  Left alone, Dexter wedged a flashlight in the fork of a little tree, sat down in its dim radiance, got out pen and notebook, and began his article. _The Solid Cheese Cadillac_, he wrote, _by Dexter Foote_....  Dawn found him dozing over page 16. \"There they are!\" someone shouted, jerking him awake. \"The filthy fiends!\"  The \"someone\" was General Longcombe. Joining him, Dexter saw the two VEMs. They were moving relentlessly across the valley floor toward the helpless Cadillac. Jeremiah came up, rubbing his eyes. Colonel Mortby could be discerned through the entrance of the command-post tent, leaning over a technician's shoulder.  The two VEMs reached the Cadillac and began licking off the chrome with their long, tong-like tongues. General Longcombe went wild. He waved his arms. \"Monsters!\" he screamed, \"I'll blow you to Kingdom Come personally!\" and stomped into the tent.  Dexter and Jeremiah started to put on their cobalt-blue glasses. Abruptly thunder sounded, and a shadow darkened the land. Looking skyward, Dexter saw it--  The ship. The saucer. Whichever word you cared to apply to it. But whichever noun you chose, you had to prefix it with the adjective \"gigantic,\" for the ventral hatch alone, which had just yawned open, was large enough to accommodate the Sugardale Methodist Church.  In the command-post tent, the general, as yet unaware of the UFO's presence, was giving the countdown in an anguished voice. \"Two--\"  In the valley, the two VEMs were trying vainly to extricate themselves from a huge metallic net that had dropped over them.  \"One--\"  On the lip of the valley, Dexter Foote was grappling with an insight.  \"Zero--\"  Pfft!...         *       *       *       *       *  \"It wasn't a dud after all,\" General Longcombe said. \"They cancelled out the chain-reaction with some kind of a ray. I wonder....\" He shook his head wistfully. \"What a weapon, though.\"  He and Colonel Mortby and the tech were standing by the chrome-stripped carcass of the Cadillac. Dexter and Jeremiah had just come up. \"My theory turned out to be a little bit off-center,\" Dexter said. \"You see, I overlooked the possibility that our children aren't necessarily the only galactic small fry who run away from home and get themselves in Dutch. My birthday-cake analogy still holds true, but I would have done better to have compared our late-model automobiles to appetizing candy bars, or Easter baskets filled with jelly beans and chocolate chickens.\"  The general regarded him blankly. \"I'm afraid I don't follow you at all, Mr. Foote.\"  \"Did you ever turn a pair of hungry kids loose in a candy store, sir?\"  Understanding came into General Longcombe's eyes then, and he turned and gazed sadly at his chromeless Cadillac. \"I wonder if they have castor oil on Planet X,\" he said.  \"I bet they have its equivalent,\" grinned Dexter Foote."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/50928"],["title","Hot Planet (#1)"],["body","the \"twilight\" belt had been flooded by this very liquid lava, which had cooled to a smoother surface than most Earthly lava flows.  How long it had stayed cool they didn't guess. But both men felt sure that Mercury must have periodic upheavals as heat accumulated inside it--heat coming not from radioactivity but from tidal energy. Mercury's orbit is highly eccentric. At perihelion, tidal force tries to pull it apart along the planet-to-sun line, while at aphelion the tidal force is less and the little world's own gravity tries to bring it back to a spherical shape. The real change in form is not great, but a large force working through even a small amount of distance can mean a good deal of energy.  If the energy can't leak out--and Mercury's rocks conduct heat no better than those of Earth--the temperature must rise.  Sooner or later, the men argued, deeply buried rock must fuse to magma. Its liquefaction would let the bulk of the planet give farther under tidal stress, so heat would be generated even faster. Eventually a girdle of magma would have to form far below the crust all around the twilight strip, where the tidal strain would be greatest. Sooner or later this would melt its way to the surface, giving the zone a period of intense volcanic activity and, incidentally, giving the planet a temporary atmosphere.  The idea was reasonable. It had, the astronomer admitted, been suggested long before to account for supposed vulcanism on the moon. It justified the careful examination that Schlossberg and Zaino gave the plain before they descended the ladder; for it made reasonable the occasional changes which were observed to occur in the pattern of cracks weaving over its surface.  No one was certain just how permanent the local surface was--though no one could really justify feeling safer on board the _Albireo_ than outside on the lava. If anything really drastic happened, the ship would be no protection.  The sun, hanging just above the horizon slightly to the watcher's right, cast long shadows which made the cracks stand out clearly; as far as either man could see, nothing had changed recently. They descended the ladder carefully--even the best designed spacesuits are somewhat vulnerable--and made their way to the spot where the tractors were parked.  A sheet-metal fence a dozen feet high and four times as long provided shade, which was more than a luxury this close to the sun. The tractors were parked in this shadow, and beside and between them were piles of equipment and specimens. The apparatus Schlossberg had devised was beside the tractor at the north end of the line, just inside the shaded area.  It was still just inside the shade when they finished, four hours later. Hargedon had joined them during the final hour and helped pack the equipment in the tractor he was to drive. Zaino had had no trouble in learning to make the observations Schlossberg wanted, and the youngster was almost unbearably cocky. Schlossberg hoped, as they returned to the _Albireo_, that no one would murder the communications expert in the next twelve hours. There would be nothing to worry about after the trip started; Hargedon was quite able to keep anyone in his place without being nasty about it. If Zaino had been going with Aiello or Harmon--but he wasn't, and it was pointless to dream up trouble.  And no trouble developed all by itself.   II  Zaino was not only still alive but still reasonably popular when the first of the tractors set out, carrying Eileen Harmon and Eric Trackman, the _Albireo's_ nuclear engineer.  It started more than an hour before the others, since the stratigrapher's drilling program, \"done\" or not, took extra time. The tractor hummed off to the south, since both Darkside routes required a long detour to pass the chasm to the west. Routes had been worked out from the stereo-photos taken during the orbital survey. Even Darkside had been covered fairly well with Uniquantum film under Venus light.  The Harmon-Trackman vehicle was well out of sight when Mardikian and Aiello started out on one of the Brightside routes, and a few minutes later Marini set out on the other with the spacesuit technician, Mary Spurr, driving.  Both vehicles disappeared quickly into a valley to the northeast, between the ash cones and a thousand-foot spine which rose just south of them. All the tractors were in good radio contact; Zaino made sure of that before he abandoned the radio watch to Rowson, suited up and joined Hargedon at the remaining one. They climbed in, and Hargedon set it in motion.  At about the same time, the first tractor came into view again, now traveling north on the farther side of the chasm. Hargedon took this as evidence that the route thus far was unchanged, and kicked in highest speed.  The cabin was pretty cramped, even though some of the equipment had been attached outside. The men could not expect much comfort for the next week.  Hargedon was used to the trips, however. He disapproved on principle of people who complained about minor inconveniences such as having to sleep in spacesuits; fortunately, Zaino's interest and excitement overrode any thought he might have had about discomfort.  This lasted through the time they spent doubling the vast crack in Mercury's crust, driving on a little to the north of the ship on the other side and then turning west toward the dark hemisphere. The route was identical to that of Harmon's machine for some time, though no trace of its passage showed on the hard surface. Then Hargedon angled off toward the southwest. He had driven this run often enough to know it well even without the markers which had been set out with the seismographs. The photographic maps were also aboard. With them, even Zaino had no trouble keeping track of their progress while they remained in sunlight.  However, the sun sank as they traveled west. In two hours its lower rim would have been on the horizon, had they been able to see the horizon; as it was, more of the \"sea level\" lava plain was in shadow than not even near the ship, and their route now lay in semi-darkness.  The light came from peaks projecting into the sunlight, from scattered sky-light which was growing rapidly fainter and from the brighter celestial objects such as Earth. Even with the tractor's lights it was getting harder to spot crevasses and seismometer markers. Zaino quickly found the fun wearing off ... though his pride made him cover this fact as best he could.  If Hargedon saw this, he said nothing. He set Zaino to picking up every other instrument, as any partner would have, making no allowance for the work the youngster was doing for Schlossberg. This might, of course, have had the purpose of keeping the radioman too busy to think about discomfort. Or it might merely have been Hargedon's idea of normal procedure.  Whatever the cause, Zaino got little chance to use the radio once they had driven into the darkness. He managed only one or two brief talks with those left at the ship.         *       *       *       *       *  The talks might have helped his morale, since they certainly must have given the impression that nothing was going on in the ship while at least he had something to do in the tractor. However, this state of affairs did not last. Before the vehicle was four hours out of sight of the _Albireo_, a broadcast by Camille Burkett reached them.  The mineralogist's voice contained at least as much professional enthusiasm as alarm, but everyone listening must have thought promptly of the dubious stability of Mercury's crust. The call was intended for her fellow geologists Mardikian and Harmon. But it interested Zaino at least as much.  \"Joe! Eileen! There's a column of what looks like black smoke rising over Northeast Spur. It can't be a real fire, of course; I can't see its point of origin, but if it's the convection current it seems to be the source must be pretty hot. It's the closest thing to a genuine volcano I've seen since we arrived; it's certainly not another of those ash mounds. I should think you'd still be close enough to make it out, Joe. Can you see anything?\"  The reply from Mardikian's tractor was inaudible to Zaino and Hargedon, but Burkett's answer made its general tenor plain.  \"I hadn't thought of that. Yes, I'd say it was pretty close to the Brightside route. It wouldn't be practical for you to stop your run now to come back to see. You couldn't do much about it anyway. I could go out to have a look and then report to you. If the way back is blocked there'll be plenty of time to work out another.\" Hargedon and Zaino passed questioning glances at each other during the shorter pause that followed.  \"I know there aren't,\" the voice then went on, responding to the words they could not hear, \"but it's only two or three miles, I'd say. Two to the spur and not much farther to where I could see the other side. Enough of the way is in shade so I could make it in a suit easily enough. I can't see calling back either of the dark-side tractors. Their work is just as important as the rest--anyway, Eileen is probably out of range. She hasn't answered yet.\"  Another pause.  \"That's true. Still, it would mean sacrificing that set of seismic records--no, wait. We could go out later for those. And Mel could take his own weather measures on the later trip. There's plenty of time!\"  Pause, longer this time.  \"You're right, of course. I just wanted to get an early look at this volcano, if it is one. We'll let the others finish their runs, and when you get back you can check the thing from the other side yourself. If it is blocking your way there's time to find an alternate route. We could be doing that from the maps in the meantime, just in case.\"  Zaino looked again at his companion.  \"Isn't that just my luck!\" he exclaimed. \"I jump at the first chance to get away from being bored to death. The minute I'm safely away, the only interesting thing of the whole operation happens--back at the ship!\"  \"Wh"]]]
