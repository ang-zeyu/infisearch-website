Go on with your story.\"  \"On my journey hither, which, thanks to your father's excellent arrangements, I performed in an incredibly short time, changing horses every sixteen or seventeen miles .  .  .\"  \"Who allowed you, a foreigner, to use the posthorses?\"  \"The pass drawn out for the son of Croesus, which came by chance into my hands, when once, in order to save my life, he forced me to change clothes with him.\"  \"A Lydian can outwit a fox, and a Syrian a Lydian, but an Ionian is a match for both,\" muttered the king, smiling for the first time; \"Croesus told me this story--poor Croesus!\"  and then the old gloomy expression came over his face and he passed his hand across his forehead, as if trying to smooth the lines of care away.  The Athenian went on: \"I met with no hindrances on my journey till this morning at the first hour after midnight, when I was detained by a strange occurrence.\"  The king began to listen more attentively, and reminded the Athenian, who spoke Persian with difficulty, that there was no time to lose.  \"We had reached the last station but one,\" continued he, \"and hoped to be in Babylon by sunrise.  I was thinking over my past stirring life, and was so haunted by the remembrance of evil deeds unrevenged that I could not sleep; the old Egyptian at my side, however, slept and dreamt peacefully enough, lulled by the monotonous tones of the harness bells, the sound of the horses' hoofs and the murmur of the Euphrates.  It was a wonderfully still, beautiful night; the moon and stars were so brilliant, that our road and the landscape were lighted up almost with the brightness of day.  For the last hour we had not seen a single vehicle, foot-passenger, or horseman; we had heard that all the neighboring population had assembled in Babylon to celebrate your birthday, gaze with wonder at the splendor of your court, and enjoy your liberality.  At last the irregular beat of horses' hoofs, and the sound of bells struck my ear, and a few minutes later I distinctly heard cries of distress.  My resolve was taken at once; I made my Persian servant dismount, sprang into his saddle, told the driver of the cart in which my slaves were sitting not to spare his mules, loosened my dagger and sword in their scabbards, and spurred my horse towards the place from whence the cries came.  They grew louder and louder.  I had not ridden a minute, when I came on a fearful scene.  Three wild-looking fellows had just pulled a youth, dressed in the white robes of a Magian, from his horse, stunned him with heavy blows, and, just as I reached them, were on the point of throwing him into the Euphrates, which at that place washes the roots of the palms and fig-trees bordering the high-road.  I uttered my Greek war-cry, which has made many an enemy tremble before now, and rushed on the murderers.  Such fellows are always cowards; the moment they saw one of their accomplices mortally wounded, they fled.  I did not pursue them, but stooped down to examine the poor boy, who was severely wounded.  How can I describe my horror at seeing, as I believed, your brother Bartja? Yes, they were the very same features that I had seen, first at Naukratis and then in Theodorus' workshop, they were .  .  .\"  \"Marvellous!\"  interrupted Hystaspes.  \"Perhaps a little too much so to be credible,\" added the king.  \"Take care, Hellene! remember my arm reaches far.  I shall have the truth of your story put to the proof.\"  \"I am accustomed,\" answered Phanes bowing low, \"to follow the advice of our wise philosopher Pythagoras, whose fame may perhaps have reached your ears, and always, before speaking, to consider whether what I am going to say may not cause me sorrow in the future.\"  \"That sounds well; but, by Mithras, I knew some one who often spoke of that great teacher, and yet in her deeds turned out to be a most faithful disciple of Angramainjus.  You know the traitress, whom we are going to extirpate from the earth like a poisonous viper to-day.\"  \"Will you forgive me,\" answered Phanes, seeing the anguish expressed in the king's features, \"if I quote another of the great master's maxims?\"  \"Speak.\"  \"Blessings go as quickly as they come.  Therefore bear thy lot patiently. Murmur not, and remember that the gods never lay a heavier weight on any man than he can bear.  Hast thou a wounded heart? touch it as seldom as thou wouldst a sore eye.  There are only two remedies for heart- sickness:--hope and patience.\"  Cambyses listened to this sentence, borrowed from the golden maxims of Pythagoras, and smiled bitterly at the word \"patience.\"  Still the Athenian's way of speaking pleased him, and he told him to go on with his story.  Phanes made another deep obeisance, and continued: \"We carried the unconscious youth to my carriage, and brought him to the nearest station. There he opened his eyes, looked anxiously at me, and asked who I was and what had happened to him?  The master of the station was standing by, so I was obliged to give the name of Gyges in order not to excite his suspicions by belying my pass, as it was only through this that I could obtain fresh horses.  \"This wounded young man seemed to know Gyges, for he shook his head and murmured: 'You are not the man you give yourself out for.' Then he closed his eyes again, and a violent attack of fever came on.  \"We undressed, bled him and bound up his wounds.  My Persian servant, who had served as overlooker in Amasis' stables and had seen Bartja there, assisted by the old Egyptian who accompanied me, was very helpful, and asserted untiringly that the wounded man could be no other than your brother.  When we had cleansed the blood from his face, the master of the station too swore that there could be no doubt of his being the younger son of your great father Cyrus.  Meanwhile my Egyptian companion had fetched a potion from the travelling medicine-chest, without which an Egyptian does not care to leave his native country.       [A similar travelling medicine-chest is to be seen in the Egyptian      Museum at Berlin.  It is prettily and compendiously fitted up, and      must be very ancient, for the inscription on the chest, which      contained it stated that it was made in the 11th dynasty (end of the      third century B. C.) in the reign of King Mentuhotep.]  The drops worked wonders; in a few hours the fever was quieted, and at sunrise the patient opened his eyes once more.  We bowed down before him, believing him to be your brother, and asked if he would like to be taken to the palace in Babylon.  This he refused vehemently, and asseverated that he was not the man we took him for, but, .  .  .\"  \"Who can be so like Bartja? tell me quickly,\" interrupted the king, \"I am very curious to know this.\"  \"He declared that he was the brother of your high-priest, that his name was Gaumata, and that this would be proved by the pass which we should find in the sleeve of his Magian's robe.  The landlord found this document and, being able to read, confirmed the statement of the sick youth; he was, however, soon seized by a fresh attack of fever, and began to speak incoherently.\"  \"Could you understand him?\"  \"Yes, for his talk always ran on the same subject.  The hanging-gardens seemed to fill his thoughts.  He must have just escaped some great danger, and probably had had a lover's meeting there with a woman called Mandane.\"  \"Mandane, Mandane,\" said Cambyses in a low voice; \"if I do not mistake, that is the name of the highest attendant on Amasis' daughter.\"  These words did not escape the sharp ears of the Greek.  He thought a moment and then exclaimed with a smile; \"Set the prisoners free, my King; I will answer for it with my own head, that Bartja was not in the hanging-gardens.\"  The king was surprised at this speech but not angry.  The free, unrestrained, graceful manner of this Athenian towards himself produced the same impression, that a fresh sea-breeze makes when felt for the first time.  The nobles of his own court, even his nearest relations, approached him bowing and cringing, but this Greek stood erect in his presence; the Persians never ventured to address their ruler without a thousand flowery and flattering phrases, but the Athenian was simple, open and straightforward.  Yet his words were accompanied by such a charm of action and expression, that the king could understand them, notwithstanding the defective Persian in which they were clothed, better than the allegorical speeches of his own subjects.  Nitetis and Phanes were the only human beings, who had ever made him forget that he was a king.  With them he was a man speaking to his fellow-man, instead of a despot speaking with creatures whose very existence was the plaything of his own caprice.  Such is the effect produced by real manly dignity, superior culture and the consciousness of a right to freedom, on the mind even of a tyrant.  But there was something beside all this, that had helped to win Cambyses' favor for the Athenian.  This man's coming seemed as if it might possibly give him back the treasure he had believed was lost and more than lost.  But how could the life of such a foreign adventurer be accepted as surety for the sons of the highest Persians in the realm?  The proposal, however, did not make him angry.  On the contrary, he could not help smiling at the boldness of this Greek, who in his eagerness had freed himself from the cloth which hung over his mouth and beard, and exclaimed: \"By Mithras, Greek, it really seems as if you were to prove a messenger of good for us!  I accept your offer.  If the prisoners, notwithstanding your supposition, should still prove guilty you are bound to pass your whole life at my court and in my service, but if, on the contrary, you are able to prove what I so ardently long for, I will make you richer than any of your countrymen.\"  Phanes answered by a smile which seemed to decline this munificent offer, and asked: \"Is it permitted me to put a few questions to yourself and to "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5457"],["title","An Egyptian Princess â€” Volume 08 (#1)"],["body","exhausted on the bed.  Nebenchari bent down, and before the royal physicians could return, kissed her forehead gently, murmuring: \"She dies my confederate.  The gods hearken to the prayers of those who die innocent.  By carrying the sword into Egypt, I shall avenge king Hophra's wrongs as well as my own.\"  When Nitetis opened her eyes once more, a few hours later, Kassandane was holding her right hand, Atossa kneeling at her feet, and Croesus standing at the head of her bed, trying, with the failing strength of old age, to support the gigantic frame of the king, who was so completely overpowered by his grief, that he staggered like a drunken man.  The dying girl's eyes lighted up as she looked round on this circle.  She was wonderfully beautiful.  Cambyses came closer and kissed her lips; they were growing cold in death.  It was the first kiss he had ever given her, and the last.  Two large tears sprang to her eyes; their light was fast growing dim; she murmured Cambyses' name softly, fell back in Atossa's arms, and died.  We shall not give a detailed account of the next few hours: it would be an unpleasant task to describe how, at a signal from the principal Persian doctor, every one, except Nebenchari and Croesus, hastily left the room; how dogs were brought in and their sagacious heads turned towards the corpse in order to scare the demon of death;--how, directly after Nitetis' death, Kassandane, Atossa and their entire retinue moved into another house in order to avoid defilement;--how fire was extinguished throughout the dwelling, that the pure element might be removed from the polluting spirits of death;--how spells and exorcisms were muttered, and how every person and thing, which had approached or been brought into contact with the dead body, was subjected to numerous purifications with water and pungent fluids.  The same evening Cambyses was seized by one of his old epileptic attacks. Two days later he gave Nebenchari permission to embalm Nitetis' body in the Egyptian manner, according to her last wish.  The king gave way to the most immoderate grief; he tore the flesh of his arms, rent his clothes and strewed ashes on his head, and on his couch.  All the magnates of his court were obliged to follow his example.  The troops mounted guard with rent banners and muffled drums.  The cymbals and kettle-drums of the \"Immortals\" were bound round with crape.  The horses which Nitetis had used, as well as all which were then in use by the court, were colored blue and deprived of their tails; the entire court appeared in mourning robes of dark brown, rent to the girdle, and the Magi were compelled to pray three days and nights unceasingly for the soul of the dead, which was supposed to be awaiting its sentence for eternity at the bridge Chinvat on the third night.  Neither the king, Kassandane, nor Atossa shrank from submitting to the necessary purifications; they repeated, as if for one of their nearest relations, thirty prayers for the dead, while, in a house outside the city gates Nebenchari began to embalm her body in the most costly manner, and according to the strictest rules of his art.        [Embalming was practised in three different ways.  The first cost a      talent of silver (L225.); the second 20 Minae (L60.) and the third      was very inexpensive.  Herod. II.  86-88.  Diod.  I. 9.  The brain      was first drawn out through the nose and the skull filled with      spices.  The intestines were then taken out, and the body filled in      like manner with aromatic spices.  When all was finished, the corpse      was left 70 days in a solution of soda, and then wrapped in bandages      of byssus spread over with gum.  The microscopical examinations of      mummy-bandages made by Dr. Ure and Prof. Czermak have proved that      byssus is linen, not cotton.  The manner of embalming just described      is the most expensive, and the latest chemical researches prove that      the description given of it by the Greeks was tolerably correct.  L.      Penicher maintains that the bodies were first somewhat dried in      ovens, and that then resin of the cedar-tree, or asphalte, was      poured into every opening.  According to Herodotus, female corpses      were embalmed by women.  Herod. II. 89.  The subject is treated in      great detail by Pettigrew, History of Egyptian Mummies.  London.      1834.  Czermak's microscopical examinations of Egyptian mummies show      how marvellously the smallest portions of the bodies were preserved,      and confirm the statements of Herodotus on many points.  The      monuments also contain much information in regard to embalming, and      we now know the purpose of nearly all the amulets placed with the      dead.]  For nine days Cambyses remained in a condition, which seemed little short of insanity.  At times furious, at others dull and stupefied, he did not even allow his relations or the high-priest to approach him.  On the morning of the tenth day he sent for the chief of the seven judges and commanded, that as lenient a sentence as possible should be pronounced on Gaumata.  Nitetis, on her dying-bed, had begged him to spare the life of this unhappy youth.  One hour later the sentence was submitted to the king for ratification. It ran thus: \"Victory to the king!  Inasmuch as Cambyses, the eye of the world and the sun of righteousness, hath, in his great mercy, which is as broad as the heavens and as inexhaustible as the great deep, commanded us to punish the crime of the son of the Magi, Gaumata, with the indulgence of a mother instead of with the severity of a judge, we, the seven judges of the realm, have determined to grant his forfeited life.  Inasmuch, however, as by the folly of this youth the lives of the noblest and best in this realm have been imperilled, and it may reasonably be apprehended that he may again abuse the marvellous likeness to Bartja, the noble son of Cyrus, in which the gods have been pleased in their mercy to fashion his form and face, and thereby bring prejudice upon the pure and righteous, we have determined to disfigure him in such wise, that in the time to come it will be a light matter to discern between this, the most worthless subject of the realm, and him who is most worthy.  We therefore, by the royal Will and command, pronounce sentence, that both the ears of Gaumata be cut off, for the honor of the righteous and shame of the impure.\"  Cambyses confirmed this sentence at once, and it was executed the same day.       [With reference to Gaumata's punishment, the same which Herodotus      says was inflicted on the pretended Smerdis, we would observe that      even Persians of high rank were sometimes deprived of their ears.      In the Behistan inscription (Spiegel p. 15 and 21.) the ears, tongue      and nose of the man highest in rank among the rebels, were cut off.      Similar punishments are quoted by Brisson.]  Oropastes did not dare to intercede for his brother, though this ignominious punishment mortified his ambitious mind more than even a sentence of death could have done.  As he was afraid that his own influence and consideration might suffer through this mutilated brother, he ordered him to leave Babylon at once for a country-house of his own on Mount Arakadris.  During the few days which had just passed, a shabbily-dressed and closely-veiled woman had watched day and night at the great gate of the palace; neither the threats of the sentries nor the coarse jests of the palace-servants could drive her from her post.  She never allowed one of the less important officials to pass without eagerly questioning him, first as to the state of the Egyptian Princess, and then what had become of Gaumata.  When his sentence was told her as a good joke by a chattering lamp-lighter, she went off into the strangest excitement, and astonished the poor man so much by kissing his robe, that he thought she must be crazed, and gave her an alms.  She refused the money, but remained at her post, subsisting on the bread which was given her by the compassionate distributors of food.  Three days later Gaumata himself, with his head bound up, was driven out in a closed harmamaxa.  She rushed to the carriage and ran screaming by the side of it, until the driver stopped his mules and asked what she wanted.  She threw back her veil and showed the poor, suffering youth her pretty face covered with deep blushes.  Gaumata uttered a low cry as he recognized her, collected himself, however, in a moment, and said: \"What do you want with me, Mandane?\"  The wretched girl raised her hands beseechingly to him, crying: \"Oh, do not leave me, Gaumata!  Take me with you!  I forgive you all the misery you have brought on me and my poor mistress.  I love you so much, I will take care of you and nurse you as if I were the lowest servant-girl.\"  A short struggle passed in Gaumata's mind.  He was just going to open the carriage-door and clasp Mandane-his earliest love-in his arms, when the sound of horses' hoofs coming nearer struck on his ear, and looking round he saw, a carriage full of Magi, among whom were several who had been his companions at the school for priests.  He felt ashamed and afraid of being seen by the very youths, whom he had often treated proudly and haughtily because he was the brother of the high-priest, threw Mandane a purse of gold, which his brother had given him at parting, and ordered the driver to go on as fast as possible.  The mules galloped off. Mandane kicked the purse away, rushed after the carriage and clung to it firmly.  One of the wheels caught her dress and dragged her down.  With the strength of despair she sprang up, ran after the mules, overtook them on a slight ascent which had lessened their speed, and seized the reins. The driver used his three-lashed whip, or scourge, the creatures reared, pulled the girl down and rushed on.  Her last cry of agony pierced the wounds of the mutilated man like a sharp lance-thrust.        "]]]
