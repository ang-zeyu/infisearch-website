But we will not sermonize; even at this distance we may hold out the strong arm of influence, assuring our readers that the highest aims of writers and publishers are for the advancement of the younger girls, whose minds, for the moment, are entrusted to our keeping.  Coming back to our group of Girl Scouts, now holding conclave in the school yard of Flosston grammar grades, we find Grace and Madeline forming themselves into a committee of two, with the avowed intention of getting lip a hiking party for their own special benefit. These younger girls must soon undergo the test necessary for their qualification as second class scouts, and a hike on this lovely spring afternoon would aid them greatly in acquiring the outdoor knowledge necessary.  Margaret was rather inclined to dissent when the jaunt was proposed, she did not feel quite as hiky as usual, and she promptly remembered she had promised her mother some assistance in the little kitchen garden both were developing.  \"Oh, come on,\" pleaded Grace. \"If you say you want to go, I am sure Captain Clark will agree. I know where we can get the loveliest watercress.\"  This lure won Margaret, who had now fully recovered her scout cheer, and was trying bravely to forget the loss of her cherished badge\".  \"Mother loves watercress,\" she conceded, \"and I would go, if we are sure to be back by five. I have to go call for the mail before dark.\"  \"Oh, goody-good!\" sang out Grace. \"Now I can surely get my nature work all nicely covered. I'll tell Madaline. She is over there coaxing Cleo,\" and with a risky flourish of her red tie, a hop, skip and a jump, the Tenderfoot pranced across the big green schoolyard, in a fashion that belied her limitations on the tenderfoot basis.  \"Yes, I'll go,\" Cleo was agreeing, \"but I am afraid we can't get Captain Clark. I know she is going out to Kingsley to form a troop. Maybe we can get Lieutenant Lindsley. She is free from Normal at four. They have a lecture after two-thirty almost every day.\"  \"Oh, Lieutenant Lindsley would be lots of fun. She knows everything in hill and dale, and is not afraid of snakes or cows. But do you think we should notify the other girls? It is rather hard to get in touch with them in time,\" Grace ranted on.  By this time Margaret and Madaline had joined the group, and now all the scouts in seventh and eighth grammar grades were discussing plans for the precipitous hike. There were Mable Blake, also a tenderfoot, Adaline Allen and Mildred Clark, second grades, and the McKay twins, first class scouts. All of these willingly agreed to make the foot trip out to the Falls.  The afternoon school session received scant attention from the prospective hikers, the Tenderfoots especially being absorbed in the prospects of a spring afternoon in the woods.  So interested were Grace and Madaline they exchanged preparatory notes in the five minute rest period, although that time was set aside for real relaxation, and no one was supposed to use eyes or fingers during the short rest.  When school was finally dismissed the girls arranged to pass the homes of most of the group, as many of them lived on the same Oakley Avenue, and thus notify parents of their scout plans for the hike, and when Lieutenant Lindsley was eventually picked up from the practicing department of the Normal School, the ranks were filled, and the hike moved off towards the River Road.  It was a glorious afternoon, in late April. The peach blossoms were just breaking into pink puff balls, and the pear trees were burdened with a crop of spring \"snow,\" fragrant in their whitest of dainty blossoms.  But the still life beauties were not more attractive than the joyous, happy, romping girls, who capered along from the more noisy town streets, into the highways and byways of the long green stretch of country leading to the river brink, and to the woods on its border.  \"I'm going to do something really great,\" declared Grace. \"I don't care just what it is, but I want to have a real record, when I am called up to take my degree test. I am not afraid of anything in daylight, so beware! I may do something very desperate and rash this afternoon.\"  \"Spare us,\" pleaded Madaline. \"I have seen some of our courage worked out in the woods before. Remember the time you nearly set fire to the river? Well, don't, please, go try anything like that today.\"  \"No, it must be something for which I should receive a badge of courage, if I were in the first class. I want to blush with fitting modesty when Captain Clark invests me with the next degree, and I shall only blush when reminded of my noble deed this afternoon.\"  \"Since you are not particular about what deed shall be the noble one, won't you just give me a hand, and help me save this heel of mine from a blistering shoe? The shoe was all right in school, but just now it has picked up a snag, somehow, and between the shoe and the snag, my life is not worth living.\"  \"Poor Madie,\" soothed her chum. \"Let us sit right down here and diagnose the case. I'm first rate at diagnosing anything but why my bureau can't stay fixed. It has chronic upsettedness, and all my operations are of no avail. There go the girls down into the hazel nut gully. Let's sit on this lovely mossy couch, and look after the heel. Doesn't moss grow beautifully smooth under the cedars? I wonder how it ever gets so velvety?\"  At the twined and natural woven seat, wrought from the uncovered roots of a great hemlock, the girls caressed and patted the velvet moss that formed a veritable carpet--no--it was softer than carpet, a silken velvet throw, over a natural cedar divan. Even the suffering heel was forgotten, in the joy of nature study, in green, with the darker green canopy of cedars, and the music of a running river at the foot of the sloping hill. Here the scent of watercress vied with the hemlock and cedar, for its place as nature's perfume, and only such mingling of wild ferns, trailing arbutus, budding bush, and leafing vine, could produce the aroma of incense that just then permeated the woody glen.  \"Don't let the girls get too far away from us,\" cautioned Madeline. \"I wouldn't like to get really lost, even for the joke of having you find me, Gracie.\"  \"But you would do a little thing like that to help me out on my personal bravery stunt?\" teased her companion. \"I wonder why only the first class girls are permitted to do all those wonderful things and get all the really high honors?\"  \"Because they have gone through all the necessary trials and examinations,\" replied Madaline sagely. \"You and I can get credit for our deeds, but we must show our full records to get the highest B. C. That's fair. You can't make a major out of a private. He has got to go up by degrees.\"  \"Well, maybe it is fair, but I just love the glory of presentations. I am so sorry for Margaret. I would have dug up the town today to find that Merit Badge she lost last night.\"  \"I like the way she braved it out, though,\" added Madaline. \"She felt badly enough, and it did mean so much to her,\" finished the sympathetic scout.  \"Oh, yes, I suppose so,\" rather reluctantly agreed the ambitious Grace. \"But I shouldn't relish the feeling that some grimy mill girl was wearing the badge in a smoky factory.\"  \"Oh, Grace, shame! That's not scouty. You must not speak so of the mill girls. We hope to take some of them in our troop before long. We would have no right to public support if we did not do something definite for others, and the mill girls have so few chances. So don't, Gracie dear, ever speak like that again.\"  \"I won't if you say so, also if it isn't scouty. I am out to win the goal, and I don't mind what I may have to do to get my scout good conduct ball into the official basket. Now, how's the heel? Did the little pad of soft leaves help to keep the pressure off?\"  \"Yes, that was a fine idea, and I shall see to it that some day, when original work is called for, you get credit for the nature-aid heel pad. Rather a clumsy title, but when we explain how easy it is to get soft leaves to make pads for suffering feet, I am sure it will be welcome news to many an ambitious hiker.\"  \"Oh, Madie dear,\" suddenly exclaimed Grace. \"Where are the girls gone? They are not in the hazel nut clump, and I can't hear a sound!\"  \"Oh, my! Suppose they have gone looking for us the other way?\"  Both girls in alarm, now scurried through the woods, calling and giving the \"Coo-ee\" call, but not a sound answered them. Birds were flitting about from limb to branch, and the strange stillness of the woods frightened the little Tenderfoots.  \"You go along the bank, and I'll scour the elderberry patch. This wood is so dense in spots, and so clear under the hemlocks, it is easy to lose and hard to find anyone in it,\" declared Grace. \"I'm glad I brought my big rope. I intended to tie every knot in the course, and cut them all out to fetch back finished, and I haven't even unwound the rope.\"  \"If there is anything easier than getting lost in the woods it must be getting caught at whispering in the eighth grade,\" grumbled Madaline. \"I wish my old heel had behaved itself.\"  \"And all the plans for my brave stunt gone to naught,\" put in the now breathless Grace. \"I would never have made up the hike if I had not determined to get a glory mark out of it. Now see where we are! Miles from home, and darkness coming on at each end. Where could those girls have gone to?\"  \"Sure as shooting they have gone on searching for us. There's the reservoir road, going in the opposite direction, and also Chestnut Hill. To go either of those roads meant getting entirely away from the foolish little scouts who stopped to chatter and chin.

But, not to be outdone in fun, and also, to keep herself from growing serious, she sang back at him:      \"I don't want to stay at this place,        I don't like it any more!      I am going to the mountains,        Where I've never been before.      I shall tramp the mountain pathways,        I shall climb the mountain's peak;      I don't want to stay in this place,        So I'll go away next week!\"  \"All right for you!\" declared Jack. \"Go on, and joy go with you! But don't you send me any picture postcards of yourself lost in a perilous mountain fastness,--'cause I won't come and rescue you. So there!\"  \"What is a mountain fastness?\" demanded Patty. \"It sounds frisky.\"  \"It isn't,\" replied Jack; \"it's a deep gorge, with ice-covered walls and no way out; and as the darkness falls, dreadful growls are heard on all sides, and wild animals prowl--and prowl--and prow-ow-owl!\"  Jack's voice grew deep and terrible, as he suggested the awful situation, but Patty laughed gaily as she said:  \"Well, as long as they keep on prowling, they certainly can't harm me. It all sounds rather interesting. At any rate, the ice-covered walls sound cool. You must admit Spring Beach is a hot place.\"  \"All places are hot in hot weather,\" observed Beatrice, sapiently; \"when there's an ocean breeze, it's lovely and cool here.\"  \"Yes,\" agreed Lora, \"when there IS. But there 'most generally ISN'T. To-day, I'm sure the thermometer must be about two hundred.\"  \"That's your heated imagination,\" said Jack. \"It's really about eighty-four in the shade.\"  \"Let's move around into the shade, then,\" said Patty. \"This side of the veranda is getting sunny.\"  So the young people went round the corner of the house to a cooler spot, and Nan expressed her intention of going down to the train to meet Mr. Fairfield.  \"You people,\" began Patty, after Nan had left them, \"mustn't talk as you do about my going away, before my stepmother. You see, we're going because she wants to go, but it isn't polite to rub it in!\"  \"I know it,\" said Beatrice, \"but I forgot it. But, I say, Patty, I think it's too bad for you to be trailed off there just to please her.\"  \"Not at all, Bee. She has stayed here three months to please me, and turn about is fair play.\"  \"It's Fairfield play, at any rate,\" put in Jack. \"You're a trump, Patty, to take it so sweetly. I wish you didn't have to go, though.\"  \"So say we all of us,\" declared Lora, but Patty ordered them, rather earnestly, to drop the subject and not refer to it again.  \"You must write me all about the Pageant, girls,\" she went on.  \"Can't I write too, though I'm not a girl?\" asked Jack.  \"No!\" cried Patty, holding up her hands in pretended horror. \"I couldn't receive a letter from a young man!\"  \"Oh, try it,\" said Jack, laughing. \"I'll help you. You've no idea how easy it is! Have you never had a letter from a man?\"  \"From papa,\" said Patty, putting the tip of her finger in her mouth, and speaking babyishly.  \"Papa, nothing! You get letters from those New York chaps, don't you, now?\"  \"Who New York chaps?\" asked Patty, opening her eyes wide, with an over-innocent stare.  \"Oh, that Harper kid and that Farrington cub and that Hepworth old gentleman!\"  \"What pretty pet names you call them! Yes, I get letters from them, but they're my lifelong friends.\"  \"That's the position I'm applying for. Don't you need one more L. L. F.?\" But Patty had turned to the girls, and they were counting up what few parties were to take place before Patty went away.  \"I'd have a farewell party myself,\" said Patty, thoughtfully, \"but there's so little time now, and Nan's pretty busy. I hate to bother her with it. You see, we leave next week,--Thursday.\"  \"And our house party comes that very day!\" said Beatrice, regretfully. \"And Captain Sayre is coming. He's the most stunning man! He's our second cousin, and older than we are, but he's just grand, isn't he, Lora?\"  \"Yes; and he'd adore Patty. Oh, girlie, DON'T go!\"  \"I think I'll kidnap Patty,\" said Jack. \"The day they start, I'll waylay the party as they board the train, and carry Patty off by force.\"  \"You'd have to get out a force of militia,\" laughed Patty. \"My father Fairfield is of a sharp-eyed disposition. You couldn't carry off his daughter under his nose.\"  \"Strategy!\" whispered Jack, in a deep, mysterious voice. \"I could manage it, somehow, I'm sure.\"  \"Well, it wouldn't do any good. He'd just come back after me, and we'd take the next train. But, oh, girls, I do wish I could stay here! I never had such a disappointment before. I've grown to love this place; and all you people; and my dear Camilla!\" Patty's blue eyes filled with real tears, as she dropped her light and bantering manner, and spoke earnestly.  \"It's a shame!\" declared Jack, as he noted the drops trembling on the long, curled lashes. \"Come on, girls, I'm going home before I express myself too strongly.\"  So Jack and the Sayre girls went away, and Patty went up to her own room.     CHAPTER II  MONA'S PLAN   That night, when Patty was alone in her own room, she threw herself into a rocking chair, and rocked violently, as was her habit, when she had anything to bother her. She looked about at the pretty room, furnished with all her dear and cherished belongings.  \"To go away from all this,\" she thought, \"and be mewed up in a little bare room, with a few sticks of horrid old furniture, and nowhere to put things away decently!\"  She glanced at her room wardrobes and numerous chiffoniers and dressing-tables.  \"Live in a trunk, I s'pose,\" she went on to herself; \"all my best frocks in a mess of wrinkles, all my best hats smashed to windmills! No broad ocean to look at! Nothing but mountains with trees all over their sides! Nothing to do but walk up rocky, steep paths to a spring, take a drink of water, and come stumbling down again! In the evenings, dress up, and promenade eighty thousand feet of veranda, AS ADVERTISED!\"  Roused to a frenzy by her own self-pity and indignation, Patty got up and stalked about the room. She flung off her pretty summer frock, and slipped on a blue silk kimono. Then she sat down in front of her dressing-table to brush her hair for the night.  She drew out the pins, and great curly masses came tumbling down around her shoulders. Patty's hair was truly golden, and did not turn darker as she grew older.  She brushed away slowly, and looked at herself in the mirror. What she saw must have surprised her, for she dropped her brush in astonishment.  \"Well, Patricia Fairfield!\" she exclaimed to her own reflection. \"You ought to be ashamed of yourself! YOU, who are supposed to be of amiable disposition, YOU whom people call 'Sunshine,' because of your good nature, YOU who have every joy and every blessing that heart can wish, you look like a sour-faced, cross-grained, disgruntled old maid! So there now! And, Miss, do you want to know what _I_ think of you?\" She picked up her hair brush, and shook it at the flushed, angry face in the mirror. \"Well, _I_ think you're a monster of selfishness! You're a dragon of ingratitude! And a griffin of cross-patchedness! Now, Miss, WILL you drop this attitude of injured innocence, and act like a civilised human being?\"  Patty was a little over hard on herself. She hadn't at all exhibited such traits as she charged herself with, but she was not a girl to do things by halves. She sat, calmly looking at her own face, until the lines smoothed themselves out of her forehead, the dimples came back to her cheeks, and the laughter to her blue eyes.  \"That's better!\" she said, wagging her head at the pretty, smiling face. \"Now, never again, Patty Fairfield, let me see you looking mopy or peevish about anything! Mind, not about anything at all! You have enough blessings and pleasures to make up for any disappointments that may come to you. So, now that you've braced up, just STAY braced up! See?\"  The scolding, though self-inflicted, did Patty good, and humming a lively tune, she busied herself with arranging some fans and frills in boxes to take away with her.  If stray thoughts of the Pageant or the Fancy Dance crept into her mind, she determinedly thrust them out, and forced her anticipations to the unknown fun and gaiety she would enjoy at the big Mountain Houses.  And when at last, ready for bed, she stood in front of her long cheval glass, the folds of her blue dressing gown trailing away from her pretty, lace-frilled nightgown, she shook her forefinger warningly at the smiling reflection.  \"Now, mind you, Patricia, not a whimper out of you to-morrow! Not a shadow of a shade of disappointment on your fair young brow? Only happy smiles and pleasant words, and just MAKE yourself enjoy the prospect of those poky, gloomy, horrid old mountains!\"  It will be easily seen that Patty was amenable to discipline, for next morning she went dancing downstairs, looking like amiability personified. Even Nan came to the conclusion that Patty was reconciled to the mountain trip, and had begun to see the pleasanter side of it.  Mr. Fairfield regarded his daughter approvingly. Though Patty had not been cross or glum the day before, she had been silent, and now she treated her hearers to a flood of gay and merry chatter.  Only a fleeting shadow across her face, or a sudden, pained look in her eyes when Spring Beach matters were mentioned, revealed to her watchful father the fact that Patty's gaiety was the result of brave and honest will-power. But such shadows passed as quickly as they came, and the girl's pleasant and sweet demeanour was not unappreciated by her elders.  She joined heartily in the plans for the mountain trip; discussed itineraries with her father, and costumes with Nan.  As the three sat on the veranda, thus engaged, a flying figure came through the gate like a whirlwind, and Mona Galbraith precipitated herself into the family group.  \"Why, Mona, you look a little,--er,--hasty!\" exclaimed Patty as, out of breath, their visitor plumped herself into a swing and"]]]
