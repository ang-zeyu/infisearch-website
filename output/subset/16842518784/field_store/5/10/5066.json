Presently he said, \"Aside from my private angle on the matter, there are some queer things about this business. Why should somebody out in space send us a broadcast? It's not from a planet, they say. If there's a spaceship on the way here, why warn us? If they want to be friends, they can't be sure we'll permit it. If they intend to be enemies, why throw away the advantage of surprise? In either case, it would be foolish to send cryptic messages on ahead. And any message would have to be cryptic.\"  The car went whirring along the roadway. Soon twinkling lights appeared among the trees. The small and larger buildings of Burke Development, Inc., came gradually into view. They were dark objects in a large empty space on the very edge of Burke's home town.  \"And why,\" he went on, \"why send a complex message if they only wanted to say that they were space travelers on the way to Earth?\"  The exit from the highway to Burke Development appeared. Burke swung off the surfaced road and into the four-acre space his small and unusual business did not begin to fill up.  \"If it were an offer of communication, it should be short and simple. Maybe an arithmetic sequence of dots, to say that they were intelligent beings and would like the sequence carried on if we had brains, too. Then we'd know somebody friendly was coming and wanted to exchange ideas before, if necessary, swapping bombs.\"  The car's headlights swept over the building in which the experimental work of Burke Development was done and on to the small house in which Sandy kept the books and records of the firm. Burke put on the brakes before the office door.  \"Just to see if my head is working right,\" he said, \"I raise a question about those signals. One doesn't send a long message to emptiness, repeated, in the hope that someone may be around to catch it. One calls, and sends a long message only when the call is answered. The call says who's wanted and who's calling, but nothing more. This isn't that sort of thing.\"  He got out of the car and opened the door on her side, then unlocked the office door and went in. He switched on the lights inside. For a moment, Sandy did not move. Then she slowly got out of the car and entered the office which was so completely familiar. Burke bent over the office safe, turning the tumbler-wheel to open it. He said over his shoulder, \"That special bulletin will be repeated on all the news broadcasts. You've got a little radio here. Turn it on, will you?\"  Again slowly, Sandy crossed the office and turned on the miniature radio on her desk. It warmed up and began to make noises. She dimmed it until it was barely audible. Burke stood up with a reel of brown tape. He put it on the office recorder, usually used for the dictation of the day's lab log.  \"I have a dream sometimes,\" said Burke. \"A recurrent dream. I've had it every so often since I was eleven. I've tried to believe it was simply a freak, but sometimes I've suspected I was a telepath, getting some garbled message from somewhere unguessable. That has to be wrong. And again I've suspected that--well--that I might not be completely human. That I was planted here on Earth, somehow, not knowing it, to be of use to--something not of Earth. And that's crazy. So I've been pretty leery of being romantic about anybody. Tonight I'd managed to persuade myself all those wild imaginings were absurd. And then the signals came.\" He paused and said unsteadily, \"I made this tape a year ago. I was trying to convince myself that it was nonsense. Listen. Remember, I made this a year ago!\"  The reels began to spin on the recorder's face. Burke's voice came out of the speaker, \"_These are the sounds of the dream_,\" it said, and stopped.  There was a moment of silence, while the twin reels spun silently. Then sounds came from the recorder. They were musical notes, reproduced from the tape. Sandy stared blankly. Disconnected, arbitrary flutelike sounds came out into the office of Burke Development, Inc. It was quite correct to call them elfin. They could be described as plaintive. They were not a melody, but a melody could have been made from them by rearrangement. They were very remarkably like the sounds from space. It was impossible to doubt that they were the same code, the same language, the same vocabulary of tones and durations.  Burke listened with a peculiarly tense expression on his face. When the recording ended, he looked at Sandy.  Sandy was disturbed. \"They're alike. But Joe, how did it happen?\"  \"I'll tell you later,\" he said grimly. \"The important thing is, am I crazy or not?\"  The desk radio muttered. It was an hourly news broadcast. Burke turned it up and a voice boomed:  \"_... one o'clock news. Messages have been received from space in the century's most stupendous news event! Full details will follow a word from our sponsor._\"  There followed an ardent description of the social advantage, personal satisfaction and business advancement that must instantly follow the use of a particular intestinal regulator. The commercial ended.  \"_From deepest space_,\" boomed the announcer's voice, \"_comes a mystery! There is intelligent life in the void. It has communicated with us. Today--_\"  Because of the necessity to give the later details of a cafe-society divorce case, a torch murder and a graft scandal in a large city's municipal budget, the signals from space could not be fully treated in the five-minute hourly news program. But fifteen seconds were spared for a sample of the cryptic sounds from emptiness. Burke listened to them with a grim expression.  \"I think,\" he said measuredly, \"that I am sane. I have heard those noises before tonight. I know them--I'll take you home, Sandy.\"  He ushered her out of the office and into his car.  \"It's funny,\" he said as he drove back toward the highway. \"This is probably the beginning of the most important event in human history. We've received a message from an intelligent race that can apparently travel through space. There's no way in the world to guess what it will bring about. It could be that we're going to learn sciences to make old Earth a paradise. Or it could mean that we'll be wiped out and a superior race will take over. Funny, isn't it?\"  Sandy said unsteadily, \"No. Not funny.\"  \"I mean,\" said Burke, \"when something really significant happens, which probably will determine Earth's whole future, all I worry about is myself--that I'm crazy, or a telepath, or something. But that's convincingly human!\"  \"What do you think I worry about?\" asked Sandy.  \"Oh ...\" Burke hesitated, then said uncomfortably, \"I was going to propose to you, and I didn't.\"  \"That's right,\" said Sandy. \"You didn't.\"  Burke drove for long minutes, frowning.  \"And I won't,\" he said flatly, after a time, \"until I know it's all right to do so. I've no explanation for what's kept me from proposing to you up to now, but apparently it's not nonsense. I _did_ anticipate the sounds that came in tonight from space and--I've always known those sounds didn't belong on Earth.\"  Then, driving doggedly through a warm and moonlit night, he told her exactly why the fluting sounds were familiar to him; how they'd affected his life up to now. He'd mentally rehearsed the story, anyhow, and it was reasonably well arranged. But told as fact, it was preposterous.  She listened in complete silence. He finished the tale with his car parked before the boardinghouse in which Sandy lived with her sister Pam, they being all that was left of a family. If she hadn't known Burke all her life, of course, Sandy would have dismissed him and his story together. But she did know him. It did explain why he felt tongue-tied when he wished to be romantic, and even why he recorded a weird sequence of notes on a tape recorder. His actions were reasonable reactions to an unreasonable, repeated experience. His doubts and hesitations showed a sound mind trying to deal with the inexplicable. And now that the signals from space had come, it was understandable that he should react as if they were a personal matter for his attention.  She had a disheartening mental picture of a place where strange trees waved long and ribbonlike leaves under an improbable sky. Still ...  \"Y--yes,\" she said slowly when he'd finished his uneasy account. \"I don't understand, but I can see how you feel. I--I guess I'd feel the same way if I were a man and what you've experienced happened to me.\" She hesitated. \"Maybe there will be an explanation now, since those signals have come. They do match the ones you recorded from your dream. They're the ones you know about.\"  \"I can't believe it,\" said Burke miserably, \"and I can't dismiss it. I can't do anything until I find out why I know that somewhere there's a place with two moons and queer trees....\"  He did not mention the part of his experience Sandy was most interested in--the person for whom he felt such anguished fear and such overwhelming joy when she was found. She didn't mention it either.  \"You go on home, Joe,\" she said quietly. \"Get a good night's sleep. Tomorrow we'll hear more about it and maybe it will all clear up. Anyhow--whatever turns out, I--I'm glad you did intend to ask me to marry you. I intended to say yes.\"     Chapter 2   Burke was no less disturbed, but his disturbance was of a different kind. After he left Sandy at the house where she and her sister boarded, he headed back to the plant. He wanted to think things out.  The messages from space, of course, must presage events of overwhelming importance. The coming of intelligent aliens to Earth might be comparable to the coming of white men to the American continents. They might bring superior techniques, irresistible weapons, and an assumption of superiority that would bring inevitable conflict with the aborigines of Earth. Judging by the actions of the white race on Earth, if the newcomers were merely explorers it could mean the coming doom of humanity's independence.

Doctor Wallington said you would want to know about it.\"  \"But what is it?\" demanded Sam, impatiently.  \"Josiah Crabtree has escaped from jail.\"  \"Escaped!\" ejaculated Tom.  \"Why, we were just talking about him!\" put in Dick \"When did this happen?\"  \"Last night, so the newspaper man said. It seems there was a small fire at the jail--down in the kitchen. There was great excitement, for supper was just being served. In the excitement three of the prisoners, who were out of their cells, escaped. Josiah Crabtree was one of them.\"  \"Too bad!\" murmured Sam. \"And we thought he was safe!\"  \"This spells Trouble for us,\" was Tom's comment, and Dick nodded his head, to show that he was of the same opinion.     CHAPTER II  ABOUT THE PAST   \"Did you get any more particulars?\" asked Sam, of the college poet.  \"No. The newspaper man was busy, so the Doctor said, and didn't have time to go into details,\" answered Songbird.  \"Did he say who the other prisoners were who got away?\" asked Dick.  \"Yes, a tramp who was up for robbing a man on the road and a bank clerk who took some money from the bank.\"  \"None of the crowd we are interested in,\" said Tom.  \"I'm glad of it,\" returned his older brother. \"It is bad enough for Crabtree to get away. I hope they keep a strict guard over the others after this.\"  \"Oh, they will, rest assured of that,\" came from Stanley Browne. \"The head jailer will get a raking over the coals for this, mark my words.\"  \"The Stanhopes and the Lanings will be sorry to learn that Crabtree got away,\" said Sam. \"I wonder if they aren't searching for him,\" mused Sam.  \"Oh, they'll search for all of them,\" put in Songbird. \"I think the newspaper man said the sheriff had a posse out.\"  \"Too bad!\" said Dick, shaking his head gravely. \"And just when we felt sure old Crabtree wouldn't be able to give us any more trouble!\"  \"It beats the nation, what that man can do!\" cried Sam. \"Maybe be hypnotized one of the jailers--just as he hypnotized Mrs. Stanhope years ago.  \"He'd be equal to it--if he got the chance,\" answered Tom; and then all of the students had to go in to their classes.  To those who have read the previous volumes in this \"Rover Boys Series\" of books, the lads we have just met will need no special introduction. For the benefit of my new readers, however, let me state that the Rover boys were three in number, Dick being the oldest, fun-loving Tom coming next, and Sam being about a year younger still. When at home they lived with their father, Anderson Rover, and their Uncle Randolph and Aunt Martha on a beautiful farm called Valley Brook, in New York State.  Years before, and while their father was in Africa, the three boys had been sent by their uncle to Putnam Hall Military Academy, as related in detail in the first volume of this series, called \"The Rover Boys at School.\" At the Hall they had made a number of friends, including Songbird Powell and the dudish student, William Philander Tubbs. They had also made some enemies, who did their best to bring the Rover boys to grief, but without success.  A term at school had been followed by a short cruise on the ocean, and then a trip to the jungles of Africa, whither the lads went to find their father, who had disappeared. Then, during vacation, the boys took a trip West, and then another trip on the Great Lakes. After that they went in the mountains, and then came back to Putnam Hall, to go into camp with their fellow cadets.  This term at Putnam Hall was followed by a long journey on land and sea, to a far-away island of the Pacific, where the boys and their friends had to play \"Robinson Crusoe\" for a while. Then they returned to this country, and, in a houseboat, sailed down the Ohio and the Mississippi Rivers. After leaving the Mississippi they took an outing on the plains, and then went down into southern waters, where, in the Gulf of Mexico, they solved the mystery of a deserted steam yacht.  \"And now for home and a big rest!\" said Dick, and they went back to the farm. But here something very unusual occurred, and the boys had as lively a time as ever.  While at school the three Rover boys had become well acquainted with three girls, Dora Stanhope and her cousins, the two Laning sisters, Nellie and Grace. Dora was the only daughter of Mrs. Stanhope, a widow, and soon she and Dick became the warmest of friends, while Tom was quite taken by Nellie, and Sam often \"paired off\" with Grace.  In those days Josiah Crabtree had been an instructor at Putnam Hall. He was very dictatorial, and none of the cadets liked him, and the Rovers liked him still less when they learned that he was trying to practically hypnotize Mrs. Stanhope into marrying him, so that he could get control of the fortune which the widow was holding in trust for Dora. They foiled the teacher's efforts to wed the lady, and in the end Josiah Crabtree had to leave Putnam Hall. Later still he was arrested for some of his misdeeds and given a short sentence in jail.  The Stanhope fortune, as a part of the money coming to the Stanhopes and the Lanings was called, had come to Mr. Stanhope in a peculiar way, and some outsiders claimed the treasure, which, at that time, was secreted in a spot among the West Indies called Treasure Isle. There was a lively chase to get there first, but the Rovers won out, and because of this their enemies were more bitter than ever.  The boys had finished their term at Putnam Hall and on their return home became students at Brill College, a fine institution of learning of the Middle West. At the same time Dora, Nellie, and Grace became pupils at Hope Seminary, located not many miles from Brill. At the college the Rovers made many friends, including Stanley Browne, already introduced, and Will, otherwise known as \"Spud,\" Jackson, a lad who loved potatoes, and who also loved to tell big yarns.  A term at college had been followed by a trip down East, taken for a peculiar reason, and then, while on a visit home, the three lads had become the possessors of an up-to-date biplane, which they named the Dartaway. In the biplane, as related in the volume before this, called \"The Rover Boys in the Air,\" our heroes made a somewhat spectacular trip from the farm to the college campus, much to the amazement of their fellow collegians and their instructors. Later they made a trip through the air to Hope Seminary, and at that time Dick was delighted to place upon Dora's finger a diamond engagement sing.  A short while later an alarming thing occurred. The boys were out in the Dartaway when they met Grace on the road and learned that Dora and Nellie had been abducted by Josiah Crabtree, Tad Sobber, and some of their other old enemies. They gave chase in the biplane, and, after several adventures, located the girls in a lonely mansion in the country, where they were prisoners, in charge of Sobber's aunt The boys at once went for the authorities, and, after something of a fight, the rascals were made prisoners, and the girls were rescued and taken back to the Seminary.  \"You will appear against these scoundrels?\" asked the sheriff, Jackson Fells, of the Rover boys, as they were about to leave the sheriff's office at Plankville.  \"We'll appear all right enough,\" Tom had answered. \"Why, Mr. Sheriff, you couldn't beat us away with a club!\" And so it had been arranged that the Rover boys should appear in court against the evildoers whenever wanted. Then Crabtree, Sobber, and the others had been put under lock and key in the old-fashioned country jail; and there, for the time being, the matter had rested.  \"I wish we could learn more about Crabtree's escape,\" remarked Tom, as he and his brothers entered the main building of the college.  \"So do I,\" added Sam. \"Can't we telephone over to Plankville, to Sheriff Fells?\"  \"More than likely the sheriff is out, hunting for Crabtree and the others,\" answered Dick. \"But I'll tell you what we might do--if the weather stays good,\" he added, suddenly.  \"Sail to Plankville in the Dartaway?\" queried both of the others.  \"Yes, if Doctor Wallington will give us permission.\"  \"He ought to--since we are so much interested in this case,\" returned Tom.  \"We'll find out, as soon as the morning session is over,\" said the eldest Rover boy; and then all hurried to their classes, for the final bell had ceased to ring.  It was hard work for the boys to keep their minds on their lessons. Dick, especially, was very serious, and for a good reason. Something was worrying him greatly--something of which Tom and Sam knew little. What it was we shall learn later.  The boys had a quarter of an hour after classes before going to lunch, and they immediately sought out Doctor Wallington, whom they found in his private office.  \"Yes, it is too bad that that rascal Crabtree escaped,\" said the head of the college. \"I can well imagine that you are worried--since he has caused you and your friends so much trouble in the past. Let us hope that the authorities will quickly recapture him.\"  \"Have you had any further word, sir?\" asked Dick.  \"I had word at eleven o'clock, from the newspaper office. Up to that time he had not been located.\"  \"We wish to ask a favor,\" went on Dick, and spoke about the proposed trip to Plankville.  \"Very well, you may go, and in your biplane if you deem it safe,\" said the worthy doctor.
