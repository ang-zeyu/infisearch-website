Then a noise became audible; it came from the direction of the rough stair of unhewn blocks, which led from the steep wall of the ravine down to the spring.  A shudder of terror passed through the tender, and not yet fully developed limbs of the shepherdess; still she did not move; the grey birds which were now sitting on a thorn-bush near her flew up, but they had merely heard a noise, and could not distinguish who it was that it announced.  The shepherdess's ear was sharper than theirs.  She heard that a man was approaching, and well knew that one only trod with such a step.  She put out her hand for a stone that lay near her, and flung it into the spring so that the waters immediately became troubled; then she turned on her side, and lay as if asleep with her head on her arm.  The heavy steps became more and more distinctly audible.  A tall youth was descending the rocky stair; by his dress he was seen to be one of the anchorites of Sinai, for he wore nothing but a shirt-shaped garment of coarse linen, which he seemed to have outgrown, and raw leather sandals, which were tied on to his feet with fibrous palm-bast.  No slave could be more poorly clothed by his owner and yet no one would have taken him for a bondman, for he walked erect and self-possessed.  He could not be more than twenty years of age; that was evident in the young soft hair on his upper lip, chin, and cheeks; but in his large blue eyes there shone no light of youth, only discontent, and his lips were firmly closed as if in defiance.  He now stood still, and pushed back from his forehead the superabundant and unkempt brown hair that flowed round his head like a lion's mane; then he approached the well, and as he stooped to draw the water in the large dried gourd-shell which he held, he observed first that the spring was muddy, and then perceived the goats, and at last their sleeping mistress.  He impatiently set down the vessel and called the girl loudly, but she did not move till he touched her somewhat roughly with his foot.  Then she sprang up as if stung by an asp, and two eyes as black as night flashed at him out of her dark young face; the delicate nostrils of her aquiline nose quivered, and her white teeth gleamed as she cried:  \"Am I a dog that you wake me in this fashion?\" He colored, pointed sullenly to the well and said sharply: \"Your cattle have troubled the water again; I shall have to wait here till it is clear and I can draw some.\"  \"The day is long,\" answered the shepherdess, and while she rose she pushed, as if by chance, another stone into the water.  Her triumphant, flashing glance as she looked down into the troubled spring did not escape the young man, and he exclaimed angrily:  \"He is right!  You are a venomous snake--a demon of hell.\"  She raised herself and made a face at him, as if she wished to show him that she really was some horrible fiend; the unusual sharpness of her mobile and youthful features gave her a particular facility for doing so. And she fully attained her end, for he drew back with a look of horror, stretched out his arms to repel her, and exclaimed as he saw her uncontrollable laughter,  \"Back, demon, back!  In the name of the Lord!  I ask thee, who art thou?\"  \"I am Miriam--who else should I be?\"  she answered haughtily.  He had expected a different reply, her vivacity annoyed him, and he said angrily, \"Whatever your name is you are a fiend, and I will ask Paulus to forbid you to water your beasts at our well.\"  \"You might run to your nurse, and complain of me to her if you had one,\" she answered, pouting her lips contemptuously at him.  He colored; she went on boldly, and with eager play of gesture.  \"You ought to be a man, for you are strong and big, but you let yourself be kept like a child or a miserable girl; your only business is to hunt for roots and berries, and fetch water in that wretched thing there.  I have learned to do that ever since I was as big as that!\"  and she indicated a contemptibly little measure, with the outstretched pointed fingers of her two hands, which were not less expressively mobile than her features.  \"Phoh! you are stronger and taller than all the Amalekite lads down there, but you never try to measure yourself with them in shooting with a bow and arrows or in throwing a spear!\"  \"If I only dared as much as I wish!\" he interrupted, and flaming scarlet mounted to his face, \"I would be a match for ten of those lean rascals.\"  \"I believe you,\" replied the girl, and her eager glance measured the youth's broad breast and muscular arms with an expression of pride. \"I believe you, but why do you not dare?  Are you the slave of that man up there?\"  \"He is my father and besides--\"  \"What besides?\" she cried, waving her hand as if to wave away a bat. \"If no bird ever flew away from the nest there would be a pretty swarm in it.  Look at my kids there--as long as they need their mother they run about after her, but as soon as they can find their food alone they seek it wherever they can find it, and I can tell you the yearlings there have quite forgotten whether they sucked the yellow dam or the brown one.  And what great things does your father do for you?\"  \"Silence!\" interrupted the youth with excited indignation.  \"The evil one speaks through thee.  Get thee from me, for I dare not hear that which I dare not utter.\"  \"Dare, dare, dare!\"  she sneered.  \"What do you dare then?  not even to listen!\"  \"At any rate not to what you have to say, you goblin!\" he exclaimed vehemently.  \"Your voice is hateful to me, and if I meet you again by the well I will drive you away with stones.\"  While he spoke thus she stared speechless at him, the blood had left her lips, and she clenched her small hands.  He was about to pass her to fetch some water, but she stepped into his path, and held him spell-bound with the fixed gaze of her eyes.  A cold chill ran through him when she asked him with trembling lips and a smothered voice, \"What harm have I done you?\"  \"Leave me!\" said he, and he raised his hand to push her away from the water.  \"You shall not touch me,\" she cried beside herself.  \"What harm have I done you?\"  \"You know nothing of God,\" he answered, \"and he who is not of God is of the Devil.\"  \"You do not say that of yourself,\" answered she, and her voice recovered its tone of light mockery.  \"What they let you believe pulls the wires of your tongue just as a hand pulls the strings of a puppet.  Who told you that I was of the Devil?\"  \"Why should I conceal it from you?\" he answered proudly.  \"Our pious Paulus, warned me against you and I will thank him for it.  'The evil one,' he says, 'looks out of your eyes,' and he is right, a thousand times right.  When you look at me I feel as if I could tread every thing that is holy under foot; only last night again I dreamed I was whirling in a dance with you--\"  At these words all gravity and spite vanished from Miriam's eyes; she clapped her hands and cried, \"If it had only been the fact and not a dream!  Only do not be frightened again, you fool!  Do you know then what it is when the pipes sound, and the lutes tinkle, and our feet fly round in circles as if they had wings?\"  \"The wings of Satan,\" Hermas interrupted sternly.  \"You are a demon, a hardened heathen.\"  \"So says our pious Paulus,\" laughed the girl.  \"So say I too,\" cried the young man.  \"Who ever saw you in the assemblies of the just?  Do you pray?  Do you ever praise the Lord and our Saviour?\"  \"And what should I praise them for?\"  asked Miriam.  \"Because I am regarded as a foul fiend by the most pious among you perhaps?\"  \"But it is because you are a sinner that Heaven denies you its blessing.\"  \"No--no, a thousand times no!\"  cried Miriam.  \"No god has ever troubled himself about me.  And if I am not good, why should I be when nothing but evil ever has fallen to my share?  Do you know who I am and how I became so?  I was wicked, perhaps, when both my parents were slain in their pilgrimage hither?  Why, I was then no more than six years old, and what is a child of that age?  But still I very well remember that there were many camels grazing near our house, and horses too that belonged to us, and that on a hand that often caressed me--it was my mother's hand--a large jewel shone.  I had a black slave too that obeyed me; when she and I did not agree I used to hang on to her grey woolly hair and beat her. Who knows what may have become of her?  I did not love her, but if I had her now, how kind I would be to her.  And now for twelve years I myself have eaten the bread of servitude, and have kept Senator Petrus's goats, and if I ventured to show myself at a festival among the free maidens, they would turn me out and pull the wreath out of my hair.  And am I to be thankful?  What for, I wonder?  And pious?  What god has taken any care of me?  Call me an evil demon--call me so!  But if Petrus and your Paulus there say that He who is up above us and who let me grow up to such a lot is good, they tell a lie.  God is cruel, and it is just like Him to put it into your heart to throw stones and scare me away from your well.\"  With these words she burst out into bitter sobs, and her features worked with various and passionate distortion.  Hermas felt compassion for the weeping Miriam.  He had met her a hundred times and she had shown herself now haughty, now discontented, now exacting and now wrathful, but never before soft or sad.  To-day, for the first time, she had opened her heart to him; the tears which disfigured her countenance gave her character a value which it had never before had in his eyes, and when he saw her weak and unhappy he felt ashamed of his hardness.  He went up to her kindly and said: \"You need not cry; come to the well again always, I will not prevent you.\"  His deep voice sounded soft and kind as he spoke, but she sobbed more passionately than before, almost convulsively, and she tried "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5494"],["title","Homo Sum â€” Volume 01 (#2)"],["body","speak but she could not.  Trembling in every slender limb, shaken with grief, and overwhelmed with sorrow, the slight shepherdess stood before him, and he felt as if he must help her.  His passionate pity cut him to the heart and fettered his by no means ready tongue.  As he could find no word of comfort, he took the water-gourd in his left hand and laid his right, in which he had hitherto held it, gently on her shoulder.  She started, but she let him do it; he felt her warm breath; he would have drawn back, but he felt as if he could not; he hardly knew whether she was crying or laughing while she let his hand rest on her black waving hair.  She did not move.  At last she raised her head, her eyes flashed into his, and at the same instant he felt two slender arms clasped round his neck.  He felt as if a sea were roaring in his ears, and fire blazing in his eyes.  A nameless anguish seized him; he tore himself violently free, and with a loud cry as if all the spirits of hell were after him he fled up the steps that led from the well, and heeded not that his water-jar was shattered into a thousand pieces against the rocky wall.  She stood looking after him as if spell-bound.  Then she struck her slender hand against her forehead, threw herself down by the spring again and stared into space; there she lay motionless, only her mouth continued to twitch.  When the shadow of the palm-tree grew longer she sprang up, called her goats, and looked up, listening, to the rock-steps by which he had vanished; the twilight is short in the neighborhood of the tropics, and she knew that she would be overtaken by the darkness on the stony and fissured road down the valley if she lingered any longer.  She feared the terrors of the night, the spirits and demons, and a thousand vague dangers whose nature she could not have explained even to herself; and yet she did not stir from the spot nor cease listening and waiting for his return till the sun had disappeared behind the sacred mountain, and the glow in the west had paled.  All around was as still as death, she could hear herself breathe, and as the evening chill fell she shuddered with cold.  She now heard a loud noise above her head.  A flock of wild mountain goats, accustomed to come at this hour to quench their thirst at the spring, came nearer and nearer, but drew back as they detected the presence of a human being.  Only the leader of the herd remained standing on the brink of the ravine, and she knew that he was only awaiting her departure to lead the others down to drink.  Following a kindly impulse, she was on the point of leaving to make way for the animals, when she suddenly recollected Hermas's threat to drive her from the well, and she angrily picked up a stone and flung it at the buck, which started and hastily fled.  The whole herd followed him.  Miriam listened to them as they scampered away, and then, with her head sunk, she led her flock home, feeling her way in the darkness with her bare feet.     CHAPTER II.  High above the ravine where the spring was lay a level plateau of moderate extent, and behind it rose a fissured cliff of bare, red-brown porphyry.  A vein of diorite of iron-hardness lay at its foot like a green ribbon, and below this there opened a small round cavern, hollowed and arched by the cunning hand of nature.  In former times wild beasts, panthers or wolves, had made it their home; it now served as a dwelling for young Hermas and his father.  Many similar caves were to be found in the holy Fountain, and other anchorites had taken possession of the larger ones among them.  That of Stephanus was exceptionally high and deep, and yet the space was but small which divided the two beds of dried mountain herbs where, on one, slept the father, and on the other, the son.  It was long past midnight, but neither the younger nor the elder cave- dweller seemed to be sleeping.  Hermas groaned aloud and threw himself vehemently from one side to the other without any consideration for the old man who, tormented with pain and weakness, sorely needed sleep. Stephanus meanwhile denied himself the relief of turning over or of sighing, when he thought he perceived that his more vigorous son had found rest.  \"What could have robbed him of his rest, the boy who usually slept so soundly, and was so hard to waken?\"  \"Whence comes it,\" thought Stephanus, \"that the young and strong sleep so soundly and so much, and the old, who need rest, and even the sick, sleep so lightly and so little.  Is it that wakefulness may prolong the little term of life, of which they dread the end?  How is it that man clings so fondly to this miserable existence, and would fain slink away, and hide himself when the angel calls and the golden gates open before him!  We are like Saul, the Hebrew, who hid himself when they came to him with the crown!  My wound burns painfully; if only I had a drink of water.  If the poor child were not so sound asleep I might ask him for the jar.\"  Stephanus listened to his son and would not wake him, when he heard his heavy and regular breathing.  He curled himself up shivering under the sheep-skin which covered only half his body, for the icy night wind now blew through the opening of the cave, which by day was as hot as an oven.  Some long minutes wore away; at last he thought he perceived that Hermas had raised himself.  Yes, the sleeper must have wakened, for he began to speak, and to call on the name of God.  The old man turned to his son and began softly, \"Do you hear me, my boy?\"  \"I cannot sleep,\" answered the youth.  \"Then give me something to drink,\" asked Stephanus, \"my wound burns intolerably.\"  Hermas rose at once, and reached the water-jar to the sufferer.  \"Thanks, thanks, my child,\" said the old man, feeling for the neck of the jar.  But he could not find it, and exclaimed with surprise: \"How damp and cold it is--this is clay, and our jar was a gourd.\"  \"I have broken it,\"  interrupted  Hermas,  \"and Paulus lent me his.\"  \"Well, well,\" said Stephanus anxious for drink; he gave the jar back to his son, and waited till he had stretched himself again on his couch. Then he asked anxiously: \"You were out a long time this evening, the gourd is broken, and you groaned in your sleep.  Whom did you meet?\"  \"A demon of hell,\" answered Hermas.  \"And now the fiend pursues me into our cave, and torments me in a variety of shapes.\"  \"Drive it out then and pray,\" said the old man gravely.  \"Unclean spirits flee at the name of God.\"  \"I have called upon Him,\" sighed Hermas, \"but in vain; I see women with ruddy lips and flowing Hair, and white marble figures with rounded limbs and flashing eyes beckon to me again and again.\"  \"Then take the scourge,\" ordered the father, \"and so win peace.\"  Hermas once more obediently rose, and went out into the air with the scourge; the narrow limits of the cave did not admit of his swinging it with all the strength of his arms.  Very soon Stephanus heard the whistle of the leathern thongs through the stillness of the night, their hard blows on the springy muscles of the man and his son's painful groaning.  At each blow the old man shrank as if it had fallen on himself.  At last he cried as loud as he was able \"Enough--that is enough.\"  Hermas came back into the cave, his father called him to his couch, and desired him to join with him in prayer.  After the 'Amen' he stroked the lad's abundant hair and said, \"Since you went to Alexandria, you have been quite another being.  I would I had withstood bishop Agapitus, and forbidden you the journey.  Soon, I know, my Saviour will call me to himself, and no one will keep you here; then the tempter will come to you, and all the splendors of the great city, which after all only shine like rotten wood, like shining snakes and poisonous purple-berries--\"  \"I do not care for them,\" interrupted Hermas, \"the noisy place bewildered and frightened me.  Never, never will I tread the spot again.\"  \"So you have always said,\" replied Stephanus, \"and yet the journey quite altered you.  How often before that I used to think when I heard you laugh that the sound must surely please our Father in Heaven.  And now? You used to be like a singing bird, and now you go about silent, you look sour and morose, and evil thoughts trouble your sleep.\"  \"That is my loss,\" answered Hermas.  \"Pray let go of my hand; the night will soon be past, and you have the whole live-long day to lecture me in.\"  Stephanus sighed, and Hermas returned to his couch.  Sleep avoided them both, and each knew that the other was awake, and would willingly have spoken to him, but dissatisfaction and defiance closed the son's lips, and the father was silent because he could not find exactly the heart-searching words that he was seeking.  At last it was morning, a twilight glimmer struck through the opening of the cave, and it grew lighter and lighter in the gloomy vault; the boy awoke and rose yawning.  When he saw his father lying with his eyes open, he asked indifferently, \"Shall I stay here or go to morning worship?\"  \"Let us pray here together,\" begged the father.  \"Who knows how long it may yet be granted to us to do so?  I am not far from the day that no evening ever closes.  Kneel down here, and let me kiss the image of the Crucified.\"  Hermas did as his father desired him, and as they were ending their song of praise, a third voice joined in the 'Amen.'  \"Paulus!\" cried the old man.  \"The  Lord be praised! pray look to my wound then.  The arrow head seeks to work some way out, and it burns fearfully.\"  \"The new comer, an anchorite, who for all clothing wore a shirt-shaped coat of brown undressed linen, and a sheep-skin, examined the wound carefully, and laid some herbs on it, murmuring meanwhile some pious texts.  \"That is much easier,\" sighed the old man.  \"The Lord has mercy on me for your goodness' sake.\"  \"My goodness?  I am a vessel of wrath,\" replied Paulus, with a deep, rich; sonorous voice, and his peculiarly"]]]
