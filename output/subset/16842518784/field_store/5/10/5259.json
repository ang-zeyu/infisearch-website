Norah put all the food not in cans inside the old-fashioned icebox which took the place of a refrigerator. Philip thought he was too disturbed to be able to sleep, but he did, and Norah, exhausted, was asleep as soon as her head touched the pillow.  His last doubt of his wife's sanity vanished when, the next morning, they found the icebox door open and half the food gone.         *       *       *       *       *  \"That settles it!\" Philip announced. \"Come on, Norah, put your coat on. You're coming with me to the lab and we'll report what's happened. They'll find those creatures if they have to tear the house apart to do it. That boy must have been telling the truth.\"  \"You couldn't keep me away,\" Norah responded. \"I'll never spend another minute alone in this house while those dreadful things are in it.\"  But of course when they got to the front door, there they were, circling them, their teeth bared. The same with the back door and all the first floor windows.  \"That's SK540 all right, leading them,\" Philip whispered through clenched jaws. He could smash them all, he supposed, in time, with what weapons he had. But he worked in the laboratory. He knew their value to science, especially SK540's.  Rats couldn't talk, he knew, and they couldn't understand human speech. Nevertheless, some kind of communication might establish itself. SK540's eyes were too intelligent not to believe that he was getting the gist of talk directed to him.  \"This is utterly ridiculous,\" Philip grated. \"If you won't let us out, how can we keep bringing food into the house for you? We'll all starve, you and we together.\"  He could have sworn SK540 was considering. But he guessed the implicit answer. Let either one of them out, now they knew the rats were there, and men from the laboratory would come quickly and overwhelm and carry off the besiegers. It was a true impasse.  \"Philip,\" Norah reminded him, \"if you don't go to work, they know we haven't a phone, and somebody will be here pretty soon to find out if anything's wrong.\"  But that wouldn't help, Philip reflected gloomily; they'd let anyone in, and keep him there.  And he thought to himself, and was careful not to say it aloud: rats are rats. Even if they are 25th generation laboratory-born. When the other food was gone there would be human meat.  He did not want to look at them any more. He took Norah's arm and turned away into their bedroom.  They stayed there all day, too upset to think of eating, talking and talking to no conclusion. As dusk came on they did not light the gas. Exhausted, they lay down on the bed without undressing.  After a while there was a quiet scratching at the door.  \"Don't let them in!\" Norah whispered. Her teeth were chattering.  \"I must, dear,\" he whispered back. \"It isn't 'them,' I'm sure of it--it's just SK540 himself. I've been expecting him. We've got to reach some kind of understanding.\"  \"With a rat?\"  \"With a super-rat. We have no choice.\"  Philip was right. SK540 alone stood there and sidled in as the door closed solidly again behind him.  How could one communicate with a rat? Philip could think of no way except to pick him up, place him where they were face to face, and talk.  \"Are your--followers outside?\" he asked.  A rodent's face can have no expression, but Philip caught a glance of contempt in the beady eyes. The slaves were doubtless bedded down in their hideaway, with strict orders to stay there and keep quiet.  \"You know,\" Philip Vinson went on, \"I could kill you, very easily.\" The words would mean nothing to SK540; the tone might. He watched the beady eyes; there was nothing in them but intelligent attention, no flicker of fear.  \"Or I could tie you up and take you to the laboratory and let them decide whether to keep you or kill you. We are all much bigger and stronger than you. Without your army you can't intimidate us.\"  There was, of course, no answer. But SK540 did a startling and touching thing. He reached out one front paw, as if in appeal.  Norah caught her breath in astonishment.         *       *       *       *       *  \"He--he just wants to be free,\" she said in a choked whisper.  \"You mean you're not afraid of him any more?\"  \"You said yourself he couldn't intimidate us without his army.\"  Philip thought a minute. Then he said slowly:  \"I wonder if we had the right to do this to him in the first place. He would have been an ordinary laboratory rat, mindless and contented; we've made him into a neurotic alien in his world.\"  \"You're not responsible, darling; you're a technician, not a biochemist.\"  \"I share the responsibility. We all do.\"  \"So what? The fact remains that it was done, and here he is--and here we are.\"  The doorbell rang.  Philip and Norah exchanged glances. SK540 watched them.  \"It's probably Kelly, from the lab,\" Philip said, \"trying to find out why I wasn't there today. It's just about quitting time, and he lives nearest us.\"  Norah astonished him. She picked up SK540 from the bed-side table where Philip had placed him, and hid him under her pillow.  \"Get rid of whoever it is,\" she said defensively. Philip stared for an instant, then walked briskly downstairs. He was back in a few minutes.  \"It was Kelly, all right,\" he told her. \"I said you were sick and I couldn't leave you to phone. I said I'd be there tomorrow. Now what?\"  SK540's white whiskers emerged from under the pillow, and he jumped over to the table again. Norah's cheeks were pink.  \"When it came to the point, I just couldn't,\" she explained shamefacedly. \"I suddenly realized that he's a _person_. I couldn't let him be taken back to prison.\"  \"Aren't you frightened any more?\"  \"Not of him.\" She faced the super-rat squarely. \"Look,\" she said, \"if we take care of you, will you get rid of that gang of yours, so we can be free too?\"  \"That's nonsense, Norah,\" Philip objected. \"He can't possibly understand you.\"  \"Dogs and cats learn to understand enough, and he's smarter than any dog or cat that ever lived.\"  \"But--\"  The words froze on his lips. SK540 had jumped to the floor and run to the door. There he stood and looked back at them, his tail twitching.  \"He wants us to follow him,\" Norah murmured.  There was no sign of a hole in the back wall of the disused pantry. But behind it they could hear squeaks and rustlings.  SK540 scratched delicately at almost invisible cracks. A section of the wall, two by four inches, fell out on the floor.  \"So that's where some of the oatmeal went,\" Norah commented. \"Made into paste.\"  \"Sh!\"  SK540 vanished through the hole. They waited, listening to incomprehensible sounds. Outside it had grown dark.         *       *       *       *       *  Then the leader emerged and stood to one side of the long line that pattered through the hole. The two humans stared, fascinated, as the line made straight for the back door and under it. SK540 stayed where he was.  \"Will they go back to the lab?\" Norah asked.  Philip shrugged.  \"It doesn't matter. Some of them may ... I feel like a traitor.\"  \"I don't. I feel like one of those people who hid escaped war prisoners in Europe.\"  When the rats were all gone, they turned to SK540. But without a glance at them he re-entered the hiding-place. In a minute he returned, herding two white rats before him. He stood still, obviously expectant.  Philip squatted on his heels. He picked up the two refugees and looked them over.  \"Both females,\" he announced briefly. \"And both pregnant.\"  \"Is he the father?\"  \"Who else? He'd see to that.\"  \"And will they inherit his--his--\"  \"His 'super-ratism'? That's the whole point. That's the object of the entire experiment. They were going to try it soon.\"  The three white rats had scarcely moved. The two mothers-to-be had apparently fallen asleep. Only SK540 stood quietly eying the humans. When they left him to find a place where they could talk in private he did not follow them.  \"It comes down to this,\" Philip said at the end of half an hour's fruitless discussion. \"We promised him, or as good as. He believed us and trusted us.  \"But if we keep to our promise we're _really_ traitors--to the human race.\"  \"You mean, if the offspring should inherit his brain-power, they might overrun us all?\"  \"Not might. Would.\"  \"So--\"  \"So it's an insoluble problem, on our terms. We have to think of this as a war, and of them as our enemies. What is our word of honor to a rat?\"  \"But to a super-rat--to SK540--\"  As if called, SK540 appeared.  Had he been listening? Had he understood? Neither of them dared to voice the question aloud in his presence.  \"Later,\" Philip murmured.  \"We must eat,\" said Norah. \"Let's see what's left in the way of food.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Everything tasted flat; they weren't very hungry after all. There was enough left over to feed the three rats. But they had evidently helped themselves earlier; they left the scraps untasted.  Neither of the humans guessed what else had vanished from the pantry shelves--what, when he had heard enough, SK540 had slipped away and sprinkled on the remaining contents of the icebox, wherever the white powder would not show.  They did not know until it was too late--until both of them lay writhing in their last spasms on their bedroom floor.  By the time the house was broken into and their bodies found, SK540 and his two wives were far away, and safe....  And this, children, is the true account, handed down by tradition from the days of our great Founder, of how the human race ceased to exist and we took over the world."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/51752"],["title","If You Was a Moklin (#1)"],["body","port and goes in, and the door closes and the Moklins pull back. Then the _Palmyra_ booms. The ground-repulsor unit is on. She heaves up, like she is grunting, and goes bulging up into the air, and the humming gets deeper and deeper, and fainter and fainter--and suddenly there's a keen whistling and she's gone. It's all very normal. Nobody would guess that this is the last time but one a Earth ship will ever lift off Moklin!  Inspector Caldwell taps her foot, icy. \"When will you send for Mr. Brooks?\" she demands.  \"Right away,\" I says to her. \"Deeth--\"  \"I sent a runner for him, ma'am,\" says Deeth. \"If he was in hearing of the ship's landing, he may be on the way here now.\"  He bows and goes in the trade room. There are Moklins that came to see the ship land, and now have tramped over to do some trading. Inspector Caldwell jumps.  \"Wh-what's that?\" she asks, tense.  The trees that crowded off the field to make room for the _Palmyra_ are waddling back. I realize for the first time that it might look funny to somebody just landed on Moklin. They are regular-looking trees, in a way. They got bark and branches and so on. Only they can put their roots down into holes they make in the ground, and that's the way they stay, mostly. But they can move. Wild ones, when there's a water shortage or they get too crowded or mad with each other, they pull up their roots and go waddling around looking for a better place to take root in.  The trees on our landing field have learned that every so often a ship is going to land and they've got to make room for it. But now the ship is gone, and they're lurching back to their places. The younger ones are waddling faster than the big ones, though, and taking the best places, and the old grunting trees are waving their branches indignant and puffing after them mad as hell.  I explain what is happening. Inspector Caldwell just stares. Then Sally comes lumbering up. I got a friendly feeling for Sally. She's pretty old--her trunk is all of three feet thick--but she always puts out a branch to shade my window in the morning, and I never let any other tree take her place. She comes groaning up, and uncoils her roots, and sticks them down one by one into the holes she'd left, and sort of scrunches into place and looks peaceful.  \"Aren't they--dangerous?\" asks Inspector Caldwell, pretty uneasy.  \"Not a bit,\" I says. \"Things can change on Moklin. They don't have to fight. Things fight in other places because they can't change and they get crowded, and that's the only way they can meet competition. But there's a special kind of evolution on Moklin. Cooperative, you might call it. It's a nice place to live. Only thing is everything matures so fast. Four years and a Moklin is grown up, for instance.\"  She sniffs. \"What about that other trading post?\" she says, sharp. \"Who's back of it? The Company is supposed to have exclusive trading rights here. Who's trespassing?\"  \"Brooks is trying to find out,\" I says. \"They got a good complete line of trade goods, but the Moklins always say the humans running the place have gone off somewhere, hunting and such. We ain't seen any of them.\"  \"No?\" says the girl, short. \"_I'll_ see them! We can't have competition in our exclusive territory! The rest of Mr. Brooks' reports--\" She stops. Then she says, \"That clerk of yours reminds me of someone I know.\"  \"He's a Moklin,\" I explain, \"but he looks like a Company man named Casey. Casey's Area Director over on Khatim Two now, but he used to be here, and Deeth is the spit and image of him.\"  \"Outrageous!\" says Inspector Caldwell, looking disgusted.  There's a couple of trees pushing hard at each other. They are fighting, tree-fashion, for a specially good place. And there's others waddling around, mad as hell, because somebody else beat them to the spots they liked. I watch them. Then I grin, because a couple of young trees duck under the fighting big ones and set their roots down in the place the big trees was fighting over.  \"I don't like your attitude!\" says Inspector Caldwell, furious.  She goes stamping into the post, leaving me puzzled. What's wrong with me smiling at those kid trees getting the best of their betters?         *       *       *       *       *  That afternoon Brooks comes back, marching ahead of a pack of woods-Moklins with greenish skins and saucer eyes that've been guiding him around. He's a good-looking kind of fellow, Brooks is, with a good build and a solid jaw.  When he comes out of the woods on the landing field--the trees are all settled down by then--he's striding impatient and loose-jointed. With the woods-Moklins trailing him, he looks plenty dramatic, like a visi-reel picture of a explorer on some unknown planet, coming back from the dark and perilous forests, followed by the strange natives who do not yet know whether this visitor from outer space is a god or what. You know the stuff.  I see Inspector Caldwell take a good look at him, and I see her eyes widen. She looks like he is a shock, and not a painful one.  He blinks when he sees her. He grunts. \"What's this? A she-Moklin?\"  Inspector Caldwell draws herself up to her full five-foot-three. She bristles.  I say quick, \"This here is Inspector Caldwell that the _Palmyra_ dumped off here today. Uh--Inspector, this is Brooks, the Head Trader.\"  They shake hands. He looks at her and says, \"I'd lost hope my reports would ever get any attention paid to them. You've come to check my report that the trading post on Moklin has to be abandoned?\"  \"I have not!\" says Inspector Caldwell, sharp. \"That's absurd! This planet has great potentialities, this post is profitable and the natives are friendly, and the trade should continue to increase. The Board is even considering the introduction of special crops.\"  That strikes me as a bright idea. I'd like to see what would happen if Moklins started cultivating new kinds of plants! It would be a thing to watch--with regular Moklin plants seeing strangers getting good growing places and special attention! I can't even guess what'll happen, but I want to watch!  \"What I want to ask right off,\" says Inspector Caldwell, fierce, \"is why you have allowed a competitive trading post to be established, why you did not report it sooner, and why you haven't identified the company back of it?\"  Brooks stares at her. He gets mad.  \"Hell!\" he says. \"My reports cover all that! Haven't you read them?\"  \"Of course not,\" says Inspector Caldwell. \"I was given an outline of the situation here and told to investigate and correct it.\"  \"Oh!\" says Brooks. \"That's it!\"  Then he looks like he's swallowing naughty words. It is funny to see them glare at each other, both of them looking like they are seeing something that interests them plenty, but throwing off angry sparks just the same.  \"If you'll show me samples of their trade goods,\" says Inspector Caldwell, arrogant, \"and I hope you can do _that_ much, I'll identify the trading company handling them!\"  He grins at her without amusement and leads the way to the inside of the trading post. We bring out the stuff we've had some of our Moklins go over and buy for us. Brooks dumps the goods on a table and stands back to see what she'll make of them, grinning with the same lack of mirth. She picks up a visi-reel projector.  \"Hmm,\" she says, scornful. \"Not very good quality. It's....\" Then she stops. She picks up a forest knife. \"This,\" she says, \"is a product of--\" Then she stops again. She picks up some cloth and fingers it. She really steams. \"I see!\" she says, angry. \"Because we have been on this planet so long and the Moklins are used to our goods, the people of the other trading post _duplicate_ them! Do they cut prices?\"  \"Fifty per cent,\" says Brooks.  I chime in, \"But we ain't lost much trade. Lots of Moklins still trade with us, out of friendship. Friendly folks, these Moklins.\"  Just then Deeth comes in, looking just like Casey that used to be here on Moklin. He grins at me.  \"A girl just brought you a compliment,\" he lets me know.  \"Shucks!\" I says, embarrassed and pleased. \"Send her in and get a present for her.\"  Deeth goes out. Inspector Caldwell hasn't noticed. She's seething over that other trading company copying our trade goods and underselling us on a planet we're supposed to have exclusive. Brooks looks at her grim.  \"I shall look over their post,\" she announces, fierce, \"and if they want a trade war, they'll get one! We can cut prices if we need to--we have all the resources of the Company behind us!\"  Brooks seems to be steaming on his own, maybe because she hasn't read his reports. But just then a Moklin girl comes in. Not bad-looking, either. You can see she is a Moklin--she ain't as convincing human as Deeth is, say--but she looks pretty human, at that. She giggles at me.  \"Compliment,\" she says, and shows me what she's carrying.  I look. It's a Moklin kid, a boy, just about brand-new. And it has my shape ears, and its nose looks like somebody had stepped on it--my nose is that way--and it looks like a very small-sized working model of me. I chuck it under the chin and say, \"Kitchy-coo!\" It gurgles at me.  \"What's your name?\" I ask the girl.  She tells me. I don't remember it, and I don't remember ever seeing her before, but she's paid me a compliment, all right--Moklin-style.  \"Mighty nice,\" I say. \"Cute as all get-out. I hope he grows up to have more sense than I got, though.\" Then Deeth comes in with a armload of trade stuff like Old Man Bland gave to the first Moklin kid that was born with long whiskers like his, and I say, \"Thanks for the compliment. I am greatly honored.\"  She takes the stuff and giggles again, and goes out. The kid beams at me over her shoulder and waves its fist. Mighty humanlike. A right cute kid, any way you look at it.  Then I hear a noise. Inspector Caldwell is regarding me with loathing in her eyes.  \"Did you say they were friendly creatures?\" she asks, bitter. \"I think affectionate would be a better word!\" Her"]]]
