European cartographers of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries seem to have known and cared little about the relative positions of places in Asia; as Italian merchants by this time had established contacts with the Mongols in southern Russia, what was more natural than to place the Mongol overlord’s tomb in the hinterland of the Black Sea? Here there was more available space than in the Far East, and here on Leardo’s map the Grand Khan’s tomb could be made symmetrically to balance Prester John’s palace across the map in Africa (299).  South of the sepulcher we see the River Volga (6, 7) flowing into the northwestern corner of the Caspian (250). A branch from the east (8), perhaps the Kama, joins the Volga where the latter bends at a right angle to the south. East of the lower Volga is a “desert of thirty days” (10), Polo’s mysterious demon-haunted desert of Lop, where the traveler hears ringing bells and other uncanny sounds (possibly “singing sands”). Like the Grand Khan’s tomb, this desert is also wofully misplaced, since the actual desert of Lop lies in eastern Chinese Turkestan. The responsibility is not Leardo’s, however, for the Lop desert is in the same place on the Catalan Atlas of 1375 and on the Este map.  Farther east, beyond a row of six castles representing towns on the borderlands of China (35-40), we come to a gulf of the encircling ocean and to a great system of mountains. The gulf (11), which contains three islands, appears in almost the same position and form on the Este map, where there is a legend explaining that on the islands griffons and falcons are found and that the natives are not allowed to kill them without the permission of the Grand Khan of the Tatars. This is also from Marco Polo, who writes that the islands where the gerfalcons are bred lie so far north that the North Star is left behind you in the south! The mountains southeast of the gulf make an enclosure shaped something like a θ (42-47). Inside the northern half of this θ a legend tells us that “this is the province of Gog and Magog, where many tribes of the Jews were shut in” (70), referring to the medieval tradition that Alexander the Great enclosed Gog and Magog—the terrible hordes of Antichrist—within the Caspian Mountains. On many maps the mountains of Gog and Magog in the Far East are named thus. Leardo, however, places “M^o Gaspio” (Caspiae Montes) (4) north of the Caspian Sea somewhat nearer the position at which Ptolemy had placed them. To the mountains of Gog and Magog he assigns names derived from Ptolemy’s northeastern Asia. Running westward from the southern basin formed by these mountains Leardo has added a river (49), the Oechardes of Ptolemy. Near the point where this river emerges from the mountain rim we see a red spot labeled “Iron gate” (72) and, immediately to the west, two short red marks, “Statues of Alexander” (73). The iron gate was built by Alexander in the wall enclosing Gog and Magog, and the statues represent trumpeters set up by Alexander to keep guard over these unclean hordes. On the Catalan maps the trumpeters themselves are shown with their trumpets.  Immediately west of the statues appears “Mount Tanacomedo” (48), an amusing instance of Leardo’s carelessness; he has here evidently copied “Montana Comedorum” from a Ptolemaic map, combining the last part of the first word with the first part of the last! At the extreme eastern edge of the world disk we see the Terrestrial Paradise (63) surrounded by an enormous wall to keep out curious intruders. The River Indus flows southwestward to a great delta near the entrance of the Persian Gulf (84). Many of the place names in India correspond with those of the Catalan maps and in turn were derived from Marco Polo. The scene of St. Thomas’ mission and of the early introduction of Christianity into India is indicated by the inscription: “Here preached St. Thomas” (113).  In central Asia, we note two rivers entering the eastern side of the Caspian Sea, the Jaxartes (117) and Oxus (118). The Lake of Aral, in which these great streams actually have their outlet, seems to have been wholly unknown to the geographers both of antiquity and of medieval Europe. Moslem scholars, however, were aware of its existence. Leardo’s castles of Organa and of Organzia (Urganj) (120, 121) at the mouth of the Jaxartes and his place name Orcania (132) on the Oxus recall Matthew Arnold’s description of the Oxus at the close of _Sohrab and Rustum_:    But the majestic river floated on ...   Right for the polar star, past Orgunjè,   Brimming, and bright, and large.  The Tigris and Euphrates (165, 166) join, reaching the Persian Gulf (267) as a single stream flowing between two large edifices that represent Susiana (172) and Babylonia (173). To the east of the Tigris a nameless river (139) having its headwaters in a large lake (138) also enters the Persian Gulf. This same stream on the Catalan Atlas and on the Este map rises in a double source, two bodies of water that have been identified with Lakes Van and Urmia. Leardo connects the Euphrates (166) with the Mediterranean through the Orontes (168) and with the Red Sea (268) through the Jordan (167).  The most prominent feature in Arabia is Mecca (211), a large domed and towered building in good Italian Renaissance style and presumably representing a mosque. Several corrupted Turkish place names (227, 228, 229, 232) along with classical names (224, 231, 233-235) appear in Asia Minor.  The Indian Ocean is filled with yellow and red islands. A legend asserting that pepper and spice are found in these islands (275) comes from Marco Polo’s description of the East Indian archipelago. The largest of all the islands, lying off the coast of India, is marked Taprobana (269) and probably represents Sumatra.                                    Africa  Leardo’s Africa, like that of the Este map, has a very unusual shape. Two gulfs reach inland from the Indian Ocean and from the Atlantic, partially cutting off the southern extremity of the continent. On the Este map the eastern gulf is not as prominent as that of Leardo’s map, but the western is even deeper. Kretschmer suggests that these features have sprung from a combination of the ancient doctrine of a vast austral continent with Ptolemy’s theory that the Indian Ocean is surrounded by land.[23] Certain Arabic maps show an eastward projection of Africa like those of the Este map and Leardo, although they do not indicate anything corresponding to the western gulf.  Prester John’s castle (299) bulks large in the interior of Africa. In the twelfth century, reports spread through Europe of the vast realm of a fabulous Christian monarch in the heart of Asia. By the fourteenth century, however, Prester John’s empire had been transferred to Africa, where it became associated with the Christian kingdom of Abyssinia. The elaborate edifice with which Leardo represents Prester John’s empire may be intended for the sumptuous palace described in the thirteenth-century _Letter of Prester John_.  Like most medieval cartographers, Leardo makes the Nile (312) rise in West Africa (338). In this he follows Herodotus, Pliny, Mela, and other ancient authorities. Ptolemy, however, seems to have had a more correct view, placing the sources of the river in the Mountains of the Moon in eastern Africa. Nothing daunted, most of the fifteenth-century cartographers who used the writings of Ptolemy boldly transferred the Mountains of the Moon to West Africa to suit their theory of the river’s course. Thus, on the Leardo map we see the Montes Lunae (334) on the north coast of the West African gulf. Thence four streams flow north into a lake, out of which the Nile makes its way eastward and another stream flows westward into the Atlantic. The latter stream represents, perhaps, a combination of Niger and Senegal, of which some faint knowledge may have been gained through traders who had crossed the Sahara. The lower Nile is joined by the River “Stapus” (313), doubtless the Astapus of Ptolemy or the modern Blue Nile. On the Este map this tributary rises in the Terrestrial Paradise, there placed in East Africa.  To the mountain range of North Africa, the Carena of the Catalan maps, Leardo has added Ptolemaic names (385-392).                              The Mediterranean  The outlines of the Mediterranean (433) and Black Seas (431) are more correct than any other features which Leardo draws. This, of course, is due to the fact that they were derived ultimately from the portolan charts. Leardo preserves the faulty orientation of the Mediterranean characteristic of the latter. If we assume that the perpendicular line extending from the wind-blower off the west coast of Spain through Jerusalem to the wind-blower east of the Terrestrial Paradise is intended to run due east and west, we see that the axis of the Mediterranean with the adjoining shores has been turned counter-clockwise some twelve degrees. This is probably because of failure on the part of the makers of the original portolan charts to take into consideration the declination of the compass.[24]  Leardo’s place names along the Mediterranean and Black Sea coasts are all derived from the portolan charts, although Leardo wrote names only where it was easy to do so without crowding. The least successful portion of Leardo’s Mediterranean coast is that of Spain: the shore is here unduly elongated as compared with that of the Este Catalan map, Barcelona (475) and Ampurias (476) being placed too far northeast on what ought to be the French shore line.                                    Europe  As on the Catalan maps, the geography of northwestern Europe is badly distorted. The Seine (448), Rhine (487), and Elbe (488) all flow parallel with one another but slightly to the south of west. The course of the Danube (552) with its southern branches is more true to nature. The Baltic Sea (577) and Scandinavia are drawn much as on the Este map.   "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/53481"],["title","Printing Telegraphy... A New Era Begins (#1)"],["body"," great advantage over the Morse telegraph.  In 1911, Western Union began investigating systems used in Europe. The first to be tested was the Creed, a system for transmitting and printing Continental or Morse code signals at high speed. After observing several other systems, the Murray Multiplex, an improved and modernized version of the Baudot Multiplex, was found to show better operating features and, due to the use of the five-unit permutation code, more efficient use of telegraph lines.  By agreement with Donald Murray, and with his cooperation, the so-called Western Union Multiplex was developed, using Murray’s phonic wheel drive and synchronous correction. Western Union engineers designed tape transmitters and an autocontrol device for transmitting service signals. A keyboard-operated, five-unit-code, tape punch was supplied by the Morkrum Company. A page printer, which was later converted to print on gummed tape, was supplied by the Kleinschmidt Electric Company. The Western Union Multiplex was effective in increasing operating efficiency and came into extensive use throughout the system.  From that time on, development of the Baudot permutation-code printing telegraph apparatus was furthered by various companies, such as Bell Laboratories, Western Electric, the Morkrum Company, the Kleinschmidt Electric Company, as well as the companies of J. E. Wright, L. M. Potts, and others.  It appears that all of these inventors experimented with the idea of operating all transmitting and receiving apparatus at identical speeds to transmit a five-unit-code combination by first transmitting a pulse to start both transmitter and the distant receiver at the same time. Synchronous operation was obtained by electric motors equipped with governors to maintain correct speed; some used tuning-fork-controlled impulse motors. A system of five relays with progressive contact arrangements to cause cascade operation was also used to provide correct timing. Later, when correctly-timed, 60-cycle alternating current became available (see page 27), synchronous motors did the job.  Teleprinter apparatus using this synchronous method worked very well for point-to-point transmission as was used by the telegraph companies and news-distributing organizations to carry local traffic. It did not, however, solve the sought-for plan for a teleprinter intercommunicating system. When attempts were made to connect printers at different distant points in a telegraph intercommunicating circuit while using the synchronous principle, false reception and printing errors would occur, due to variation in line circuit conditions and to a variation of the mechanical start operation at outlying teleprinters. This required frequent overline adjustment to keep the connected apparatus in phase.  The following is an excerpt from a patent application of Dr. Louis M. Potts (later to become research engineer for the Morkrum-Kleinschmidt Corporation), filed June 17, 1909, giving his idea for achieving a teleprinter intercommunicating system on the synchronous principle. Dr. Potts was a very capable telegraph engineer. His early association was with the telegraph system of the Rowland Telegraphic Company which had limited use in the early 1900s.    In those synchronous telegraph systems wherein the sending and the   receiving commutator brushes constantly rotate, it is necessary to   adjust these brushes so that they will approximately simultaneously   engage corresponding segments. To effect this adjustment there is   usually provided a special device embodying an additional segment on   each commutator, and the adjustment consists in causing the brushes to   arrive approximately simultaneously on this segment at the two ends of   the line. Such adjustment is known as “finding the letter” and has to   be made every time synchronism has been interrupted. According to the   present invention, the necessity of providing additional means for   performing the so-called operation of “finding the letter” is rendered   unnecessary, since the transmitting and receiving commutator brushes   at the two ends of the line start up afresh as it were for each   signal.  In a later patent application, filed October 11, 1913, Dr. Potts stated:    This machine has also the advantage of being able to operate with a   very short code. In order to adapt it to Morse circuits, it should be   capable of operating with a code at least as short as the Morse code.   In the present machine, I preferably employ a five unit code which,   together with the starting impulse and the lag between signals, is   actually shorter than the Morse code. Counting the five code impulse   periods, the starting impulse period and the period of lag between   impulses, each signal in my case, may be considered in comparison with   the Morse code as being seven units long, whereas the Morse code is   8.5 units long. The average signal being shorter than the Morse, the   delicacy of adjustment will be less and the distance of operation   greater than a Morse telegraph for the same rate of transmission in   words per minute.  Dr. Potts, however, still depended on like synchronous operation at both terminals, and dual start, so he did not have the answer after all!  John E. Wright, who in the 1890s designed and built step-by-step printing apparatus, including the Wright-Negron bulletin printer, also turned his thoughts toward the five-unit permutation code for printer operation and built several variations using the synchronous principle. The Superintendent of Telegraphs for the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad thought well of Wright’s apparatus and placed some in operation. But, here again, reliable operation could be maintained only in point-to-point operation. As will be noted in Chapter 2, Mr. Wright’s patents were purchased by the Kleinschmidt Electric Company in 1922.  A paper issued by Siemens-Halske of Germany in January of 1917[1] states that the Siemens Pendel Telegraph “is among the forerunners of the eventual worldwide start-stop system for intercommunication by the printed word.” The following excerpt translated from that description briefly explains the operation:    The Pendel Telegraph uses the five-unit permutation code to select   characters, and operates on a start-stop principle. It is intended for   station-to-station, one-way operation, the line current normally being   closed to the positive side of the line battery. Transmission is under   control of a keyboard with keys arranged as in a typewriter. Upon the   depression of a key, the line battery is reversed, thereby   transmitting a negative pulse to line which effects the start of both   transmitter and receiver at the same time. Thereafter,   five-code-combination pulses are transmitted, followed by positive   current to line, thus restoring the circuit system to a normally   closed line condition.    The name “Pendel Telegraph” would make one think that the timing of   the transmitter and receiver were under control of a swinging   pendulum. This is not the case. However, it does have a plan for   simulating the action of a pendulum by an arrangement of springs and   semi-rotating weights to effect synchronism for each printing cycle;   and energy is derived from a motor which intermittently winds a power   mainspring to an even tension. This arrangement is started in   operation at both terminals at the same time and provides isochronal   motion at both transmitter and receiver for each transmitted   character. Due to multiple operations of the springs and weights used   to provide synchronous action, the operating speed is limited to four   or five letters per second.  In England, too, there was work being done along these same lines. Mr. H. H. Harrison, who is so well known for his contributions over the years in the telegraph field, devised printer apparatus using the five-unit code which is described in Herbert’s _Telegraphy_,[2] as follows:    The instrument is provided with a Baudot 5-key keyboard, and has a   step-by-step distributor which is mounted inside the casing. The   standard Baudot alphabet is used, but each letter or character is   prefixed by a positive starting impulse. Every time a key is depressed   a universal bar is actuated which closes contacts giving the starting   impulse and the distributors at both ends of the line step through six   spaces. The combiner is of the electrical type invented by Baudot, and   is similar to that used in Siemens’ new automatic printing telegraph.   Five relays of the class used for telephone purposes are set at the   receiving end, according to whether some of the stepping impulses are   positive or negative. The distributor is a trunk hunting switch as   used in automatic telephony, and consists of a ratchet wheel and   stepping electromagnet. On the shaft of the ratchet wheel is fixed a   wiper which sweeps over a semi-circular bank of contacts in response   to the stepping impulses. Two-way working is secured by means of the   differential balance.    (The article ends with the statement that a typewriter keyboard is   being constructed to replace the five keys.)  It appears that all of these telegraph engineers and inventors envisioned a start-stop system and experimented with the idea of operating all transmitting and receiving apparatus at identical speeds by inserting a start signal before each group of letter code signals, to start both transmitter and distant receiver at the same time, and a stop condition between code groups.  In the following chapters will be shown the contributions made by both the Kleinschmidt and the Morkrum companies in the printing telegraph field, and finally their joint efforts which were to lead up to the establishment of that now worldwide intercommunicating system, the TELEX.
