Most women would have been in my arms and would have had their noses buried in my chest.\"  \"I'm sorry, colonel, if my education in how to be afraid has been neglected.\" She coughed at the dust.  \"Aren't you really afraid, Nedra?\" he asked.  \"No.\"  \"Then you aren't an ordinary human!\" The instant he had blurted out the words, he was sorry he had spoken. It was possible to give away too much too soon.  \"Then what am I?\" Her voice was calm.  He dodged her question. \"Aren't you even afraid to die?\"  \"When so many have died already, why should I hesitate to join them?\" the nurse answered. She released his arm and brushed dust from the shoulders of her uniform. She glanced up at him and it seemed that some kind of a radiation flowed from her eyes, a wave of it that sent a tingle over his entire skin surface. Outside, another smaller boulder went bouncing past the entrance to the tunnel. Fumbling in his pockets for cigarettes, Zen found a crumpled package. He offered one to the nurse but she thanked him and refused it. He did not insist. Cigarettes were too precious to waste on people who didn't really want them. Outside, another man began to scream. The nurse moved automatically in that direction. He caught her arm and held her back.  \"Wait until the rocks stop rolling, Nedra.\"  She did not protest. Looking up at him, she said, \"You think I'm one of the new people, don't you?\"  Zen coughed and swore at the cigarette, insisting that the tobacco was moist. This was a lie and both knew it. But--what to say? Her question was a complete stunner. \"What makes you think that?\" he asked, desperate for words.  \"I just think it. It's true, isn't it?\"  As an intelligence officer, Zen was accustomed to asking the questions, but this nurse had completely turned the tables on him. He took a deep drag on the cigarette. \"I don't know. Are you?\" He made his voice as casual as was possible.  Her eyes studied him. The trace of a smile came over her face and tugged at the comers of her lips. \"Do you mind if I ask you a question?\"  \"Go right ahead.\" The man had stopped screaming outside but another boulder was going past. In the distance, the avalanche was trying to grind to a halt but it sounded as if millions of tons of rock were on the move to a safer location.  \"Are _you_ one of the new people?\" the nurse asked.  The cough was real this time. Zen could not suppress his surprise. \"What on earth makes you ask a question like that?\"  \"I just felt like asking it,\" the nurse replied. \"Am I wrong?\"  \"Who are the new people?\"  \"Why, everybody has heard of them. They're the new race that is going to provide the nucleus for new growth after all ordinary men and women have been destroyed in this war.\" Surprise showed in her violet eyes. \"Do you mean you have never heard of them?\"  \"I've heard the usual rumors that are afloat,\" Zen said, shrugging. \"But all the stories have impressed me as a pack of lies. Really, I think the enemy has started most of them, to get us to relax our war effort.\"  \"Do you honestly think that?\" Her voice had a puzzled note in it. \"I mean, honestly and truly.\"  \"I think what the evidence tells me to think, nothing less. In this case, I have seen none of the so-called evidence.\"  Shrugging, Zen moved toward the opening of the tunnel, then drew back as a mass of rock crashed outside. \"It's raining boulders out there,\" he said. \"What do you know about the so-called new people?\"  \"Not much,\" she answered.  \"You're a very lovely liar, but the fact that you are lovely doesn't make you any less a liar,\" Zen said. She was very beautiful with her violet eyes and bronze hair, but an overworked intelligence officer could not be concerned with these things.  \"Thank you, colonel,\" she said. \"But I do not relish being called a liar.\" Her face showed hurt, just the right amount of it, but at the same time her eyes laughed at him. \"However, I guess there is nothing I can do about it, is there?\" Somehow she contrived to look like a small girl who has been unjustly accused of some deed she has not committed.  In the distance the avalanche had ground to a halt. Now, no more boulders were bounding down the hill. A vast, puzzled silence held the mountains. In that silence, Zen fancied he could hear the thoughts of the frightened men who had remained alive thus far, and were wondering how to prolong their precarious existence. They were also wondering if staying alive was worth the effort involved. Why not give up now and be done with all tragedy, with all tears, with all trying to find the road to the future?  Up the trail a man began to scream.  Like a homing pigeon that has finally found the right direction, the nurse moved toward the sound. Zen caught her arm again. Looking puzzled, she stopped. \"Please, colonel. I am needed up there.\" She nodded up the slope in the direction of the screaming man.  \"You are probably needed by many others,\" he commented.  She did not seem to understand. \"But I am a nurse. It is my duty to help those who are wounded.\"  \"I know.\" He was a little startled to find himself in sympathy with this impulse. \"But, not yet.\"  \"Why not?\"  \"Because that slope is still too hot to be safe.\" He held up his left wrist. Instead of a watch, he wore a miniature radiation counter there. The needle was creeping up toward the red line.  \"The radiation count is about forty right here at the mouth of this prospect hole,\" he pointed out.  \"That is interesting,\" the nurse said. The tone of her voice said it was not important.  \"Halfway up the slope, it will hit a hundred. At the top of the ridge, where the explosion took place, the count may reach a thousand.\" In his opinion, he had said enough.  In her opinion, he had not said anything at all. \"That makes no difference. Wounded men are up there. I am a nurse. My duty is clear to me.\"  \"If you try to help them under these circumstances, you will become a casualty yourself.\"  \"But what of the men who need help?\"  \"They will simply have to get out of the radiation zone themselves, or wait until the area is clear and help can reach them.\"  \"You are heartless!\"  \"Not at all,\" he denied. \"If anything could be done to help them I would be doing it. Don't you understand what has happened? That was an Asian N bomb that exploded. In an N bomb the immediate effect is minor. The real purpose of the weapon is to spray the area with high intensity radiation, to make the ground unfit for living for months. Any living creature caught within the direct blast of the radiation is doomed, and neither you, nor I, nor the medics, can do anything to help them--\" He broke off as another man began screaming up the slope.  The nurse was irresolute. \"But that man needs help,\" she pointed out.  \"Certainly he needs help,\" Zen agreed.  \"Well--\"  Zen watched her carefully. She seemed to understand his words but something else pulled at her far more strongly: the screaming of the injured man. Each time the soldier cried out, she started in his direction.  \"Well, well, thank you, colonel.\" Turning, she moved with a sure stride up the slope.  Zen swore under his breath and started after her, then caught the motion as the question rose in him as to why she should throw her life away. She knew the meaning of radiation in lethal quantities. Unquestionably, she also knew what would happen to any normal human who ventured into a hot zone.  Was she, then, a normal human being? Was he actually witnessing one of the miracles performed by the new people? If she came off the mountain slope alive, it would certainly prove something. Zen cursed again. She was going where he could not safely follow. If she returned unharmed, he had enough proof to warrant following her to the ends of the earth, if need be.     III   The radio transmitter inside Zen's pack was small but very powerful. It did not look like a radio transmitter at all; there was no antenna and no apparent source of power. Only the tiny earphone and the throat microphone revealed its true nature.  He slipped the phone into his ear, fitted the microphone against his throat, then picked up the piece of plastic tubing that was red on one end and green on the other. Wires ran from each end of this tube to the small box that housed the transmitter.  \"Red goes to the right hand,\" he muttered. \"Green to the left. Or is it the other way around?\" Making up his mind that red went to the right, he closed his fingers around the ends of the plastic tube, then watched the tiny meter on top of the small box that contained the transmitter.  The needle moved on the dial.  \"Calling nine dash nine,\" he spoke. \"This is six one calling nine dash nine.\" He repeated the call three times, then sat back on his haunches to await an answer.  \"Come in six one,\" the earphone said. \"What color is red?\"  \"It's green this week,\" Zen answered promptly.  \"What color was it last week?\"  \"Last week? Um. Oh, yes. No color.\"  \"And that means--\"  \"White. This is Kurt Zen, colonel, intelligence, reporting. Connect me immediately with General Stocker.\"  Satisfied with the identity of the caller, the operator said, \"Just a minute, colonel, I'll see if the general will talk to you.\"  \"Tell him it's important,\" Zen urged.  \"They always say that,\" the operator sighed. \"I'll put you through as soon as I can.\"  \"Kurt, boy, where are you?\" General Stacker's voice boomed into a distant microphone. The general's voice always boomed, he was always hearty, he was always sure that while things might look black right now, they would work out all right in the end. By the time the booming voice reached Zen's earphone, it had been transformed into a tinny squeak. Kurt thought he detected an uneasy note in the squeak and he wondered if the general had finally glimpsed the end, and was finding it not quite as he had supposed.  \"In hell, general,\" Zen answered. He swiftly told where he was and what had happened. \"Cuso's blooper knocked out the last pass by which we can bring an effective force against him."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/502"],["title","Desert Gold (#1)"],["body","gh.  \"Get the little basket in my pack,\" he said.  Cameron complied, and saw his comrade drop the basket into the deep hole, where it kept the sides from caving in and allowed the water to seep through.  While Cameron watched, the basket filled.  Of all the strange incidents of his desert career this was the strangest. Curiously he picked up the peach branch and held it as he had seen it held.  The thing, however, was dead in his hands.  \"I see you haven't got it,\" remarked his comrade.  \"Few men have.\"  \"Got what?\" demanded Cameron.  \"A power to find water that way.  Back in Illinois an old German used to do that to locate wells.  He showed me I had the same power. I can't explain.  But you needn't look so dumfounded.  There's nothing supernatural about it.\"  \"You mean it's a simple fact--that some men have a magnetism, a force or power to find water as you did?\"  \"Yes.  It's not unusual on the farms back in Illinois, Ohio, Pennsylvania.  The old German I spoke of made money traveling round with his peach fork.\"  \"What a gift for a man in the desert!\"  Cameron's comrade smiled--the second time in all those days.  They entered a region where mineral abounded, and their march became slower.  Generally they took the course of a wash, one on each side, and let the burros travel leisurely along nipping at the bleached blades of scant grass, or at sage or cactus, while they searched in the canyons and under the ledges for signs of gold.  When they found any rock that hinted of gold they picked off a piece and gave it a chemical test.  The search was fascinating.  They interspersed the work with long, restful moments when they looked afar down the vast reaches and smoky shingles to the line of dim mountains. Some impelling desire, not all the lure of gold, took them to the top of mesas and escarpments; and here, when they had dug and picked, they rested and gazed out at the wide prospect.  Then, as the sun lost its heat and sank lowering to dent its red disk behind far-distant spurs, they halted in a shady canyon or likely spot in a dry wash and tried for water.  When they found it they unpacked, gave drink to the tired burros, and turned them loose.  Dead mesquite served for the campfire.  While the strange twilight deepened into weird night they sat propped against stones, with eyes on the dying embers of the fire, and soon they lay on the sand with the light of white stars on their dark faces.  Each succeeding day and night Cameron felt himself more and more drawn to this strange man.  He found that after hours of burning toil he had insensibly grown nearer to his comrade.  He reflected that after a few weeks in the desert he had always become a different man. In civilization, in the rough mining camps, he had been a prey to unrest and gloom.  But once down on the great billowing sweep of this lonely world, he could look into his unquiet soul without bitterness. Did not the desert magnify men?  Cameron believed that wild men in wild places, fighting cold, heat, starvation, thirst, barrenness, facing the elements in all their ferocity, usually retrograded, descended to the savage, lost all heart and soul and became mere brutes.  Likewise he believed that men wandering or lost in the wilderness often reversed that brutal order of life and became noble, wonderful, super-human.  So now he did not marvel at a slow stir stealing warmer along his veins, and at the premonition that perhaps he and this man, alone on the desert, driven there by life's mysterious and remorseless motive, were to see each other through God's eyes.  His companion was one who thought of himself last.  It humiliated Cameron that in spite of growing keenness he could not hinder him from doing more than an equal share of the day's work.  The man was mild, gentle, quiet, mostly silent, yet under all his softness he seemed to be made of the fiber of steel.  Cameron could not thwart him. Moreover, he appeared to want to find gold for Cameron, not for himself.  Cameron's hands always trembled at the turning of rock that promised gold; he had enough of the prospector's passion for fortune to thrill at the chance of a strike.  But the other never showed the least trace of excitement.  One night they were encamped at the head of a canyon.  The day had been exceedingly hot, and long after sundown the radiation of heat from the rocks persisted.  A desert bird whistled a wild, melancholy note from a dark cliff, and a distant coyote wailed mournfully. The stars shone white until the huge moon rose to burn out all their whiteness.  And on this night Cameron watched his comrade, and yielded to interest he had not heretofore voiced.  \"Pardner, what drives you into the desert?\"  \"Do I seem to be a driven man?\"  \"No. But I feel it.  Do you come to forget?\"  \"Yes.\"  \"Ah!\" softly exclaimed Cameron.  Always he seemed to have known that. He said no more.  He watched the old man rise and begin his nightly pace to and fro, up and down.  With slow, soft tread, forward and back, tirelessly and ceaselessly, he paced that beat. He did not look up at the stars or follow the radiant track of the moon along the canyon ramparts.  He hung his head.  He was lost in another world.  It was a world which the lonely desert made real. He looked a dark, sad, plodding figure, and somehow impressed Cameron with the helplessness of men.  Cameron grew acutely conscious of the pang in his own breast, of the fire in his heart, the strife and torment of his passion-driven soul. He had come into the desert to remember a woman.  She appeared to him then as she had looked when first she entered his life--a golden-haired girl, blue-eyed, white-skinned, red-lipped, tall and slender and beautiful. He had never forgotten, and an old, sickening remorse knocked at his heart.  He rose and climbed out of the canyon and to the top of a mesa, where he paced to and fro and looked down into the weird and mystic shadows, like the darkness of his passion, and farther on down the moon track and the glittering stretches that vanished in the cold, blue horizon.  The moon soared radiant and calm, the white stars shone serene.  The vault of heaven seemed illimitable and divine.  The desert surrounded him, silver-streaked and black-mantled, a chaos of rock and sand, silent, austere, ancient, always waiting.  It spoke to Cameron.  It was a naked corpse, but it had a soul.  In that wild solitude the white stars looked down upon him pitilessly and pityingly. They had shone upon a desert that might once have been alive and was now dead, and might again throb with life, only to die.  It was a terrible ordeal for him to stand alone and realize that he was only a man facing eternity.  But that was what gave him strength to endure. Somehow he was a part of it all, some atom in that vastness, somehow necessary to an inscrutable purpose, something indestructible in that desolate world of ruin and death and decay, something perishable and changeable and growing under all the fixity of heaven.  In that endless, silent hall of desert there was a spirit; and Cameron felt hovering near him what he imagined to be phantoms of peace.  He returned to camp and sought his comrade.  \"I reckon we're two of a kind,\" he said.  \"It was a woman who drove me into the desert.  But I come to remember.  The desert's the only place I can do that.\"  \"Was she your wife?\" asked the elder man.  \"No.\"  A long silence ensued.  A cool wind blew up the canyon, sifting the sand through the dry sage, driving away the last of the lingering heat. The campfire wore down to a ruddy ashen heap.  \"I had a daughter,\" said Cameron's comrade.  \"She lost her mother at birth.  And I--I didn't know how to bring up a girl.  She was pretty and gay.  It was the--the old story.\"  His words were peculiarly significant to Cameron.  They distressed him. He had been wrapped up in his remorse.  If ever in the past he had thought of any one connected with the girl he had wronged he had long forgotten.  But the consequences of such wrong were far-reaching.  They struck at the roots of a home.  Here in the desert he was confronted by the spectacle of a splendid man, a father, wasting his life because he could not forget--because there was nothing left to live for.  Cameron understood better now why his comrade was drawn by the desert.  \"Well, tell me more?\" asked Cameron, earnestly.  \"It was the old, old story.  My girl was pretty and free.  The young bucks ran after her.  I guess she did not run away from them. And I was away a good deal--working in another town.  She was in love with a wild fellow.  I knew nothing of it till too late.  He was engaged to marry her. But he didn't come back.  And when the disgrace became plain to all, my girl left home.  She went West.  After a while I heard from her.  She was well--working--living for her baby.  A long time passed. I had no ties.  I drifted West.  Her lover had also gone West.  In those days everybody went West.  I trailed him, intending to kill him. But I lost his trail.  Neither could I find any trace of her.  She had moved on, driven, no doubt, by the hound of her past.  Since then I have taken to the wilds, hunting gold on the desert.\"  \"Yes, it's the old, old story, only sadder, I think,\" said Cameron; and his voice was strained and unnatural.  \"Pardner, what Illinois town was it you hailed from?\"  \"Peoria.\"  \"And your--your name?\" went on Cameron huskily.  \"Warren--Jonas Warren.\"  That name might as well have been a bullet.  Cameron stood erect, motionless, as men sometimes stand momentarily when shot straight through the heart.  In an instant, when thoughts resurged like blinding flashes of lightning through his mind, he was a swaying, quivering, terror-stricken man.  He mumbled something hoarsely and backed into the shadow.  But he need not have feared discovery, however surely his agitation might have betrayed him.  Warren sat brooding over the campfire, oblivious of his comrade, absorbed in the past.  Cameron swiftly "]]]
