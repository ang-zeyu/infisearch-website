And the baron's daughter was suddenly inspired to be brave, not wishing to disappoint the venturous immortal.  So she rose and took the magic wand in her hand, waving it three times above the head of the fairy.  \"By my powers as a mortal,\" she said, marveling even then at the strange speech, \"I command you to become a brave and gallant youth--handsome, strong, fearless!  And such shall you remain for the space of one year.\"  As she ceased speaking the fairy was gone, and a slender youth, dark-eyed and laughing, was holding her hand in his and kissing it gratefully.  \"I thank you, most lovely maiden,\" he said, in a pleasant voice, \"for giving me a place in the world of mortals.  I shall ride at once in search of adventure, but my good sword is ever at your service.\"  With this he gracefully arose and began to buckle on his magnificent armor and to fasten the sword to his belt.  Seseley drew a long, sighing breath of amazement at her own powers, and turning to Berna and Helda she asked:  \"Do I see aright?  Is the little fairy really transformed to this youth?\"  \"It certainly seems so,\" returned Helda, who, being unabashed by the marvels she had beheld, turned to gaze boldly upon the young knight.  \"Do you still remember that a moment ago you were a fairy?\" she inquired.  \"Yes, indeed,\" said he, smiling; \"and I am really a fairy now, being but changed in outward form.  But no one must know this save yourselves, until the year has expired and I resume my true station. Will you promise to guard my secret?\"  \"Oh, yes!\" they exclaimed, in chorus.  For they were delighted, as any children might well be, at having so remarkable a secret to keep and talk over among themselves.  \"I must ask one more favor,\" continued the youth: \"that you give me a name; for in this island I believe all men bear names of some sort, to distinguish them one from another.\"  \"True,\" said Seseley, thoughtfully.  \"What were you called as a fairy?\"  \"That does not matter in the least,\" he answered, hastily.  \"I must have an entirely new name.\"  \"Suppose we call him the Silver Knight,\" suggested Berna, as she eyed his glistening armor.  \"Oh, no!--that is no name at all!\" declared Helda.  \"We might better call him Baron Strongarm.\"  \"I do not like that, either,\" said the Lady Seseley, \"for we do not know whether his arm is strong or not.  But he has been transformed in a most astonishing and bewildering manner before our very eyes, and I think the name of Prince Marvel would suit him very well.\"  \"Excellent!\" cried the youth, picking up his richly graven shield. \"The name seems fitting in every way.  And for a year I shall be known to all this island as Prince Marvel!\"    5.  The King of Thieves  Old Marshelm, the captain of the guard, was much surprised when he saw the baron's daughter and her playmates approach her father's castle escorted by a knight in glittering armor.  To be sure it was a rather small knight, but the horse he led by the bridle was so stately and magnificent in appearance that old Marshelm, who was an excellent judge of horses, at once decided the stranger must be a personage of unusual importance.  As they came nearer the captain of the guard also observed the beauty of the little knight's armor, and caught the glint of jewels set in the handle of his sword; so he called his men about him and prepared to receive the knight with the honors doubtless due his high rank.  But to the captain's disappointment the stranger showed no intention of entering the castle.  On the contrary, he kissed the little Lady Seseley's hand respectfully, waved an adieu to the others, and then mounted his charger and galloped away over the plains.  The drawbridge was let down to permit the three children to enter, and the great Baron Merd came himself to question his daughter.  \"Who was the little knight?\" he asked.  \"His name is Prince Marvel,\" answered Seseley, demurely.  \"Prince Marvel?\" exclaimed the Baron.  \"I have never heard of him. Does he come from the Kingdom of Dawna, or that of Auriel, or Plenta?\"  \"That I do not know,\" said Seseley, with truth.  \"Where did you meet him?\" continued the baron.  \"In the forest, my father, and he kindly escorted us home.\"  \"Hm!\" muttered the baron, thoughtfully.  \"Did he say what adventure brought him to our Kingdom of Heg?\"  \"No, father.  But he mentioned being in search of adventure.\"  \"Oh, he'll find enough to busy him in this wild island, where every man he meets would rather draw his sword than eat,\" returned the old warrior, smiling.  \"How old may this Prince Marvel be?\"  \"He looks not over fifteen years of age,\" said Seseley, uneasy at so much questioning, for she did not wish to be forced to tell an untruth. \"But it is possible he is much older,\" she added, beginning to get confused.  \"Well, well; I am sorry he did not pay my castle a visit,\" declared the baron.  \"He is very small and slight to be traveling this dangerous country alone, and I might have advised him as to his welfare.\"  Seseley thought that Prince Marvel would need no advice from any one as to his conduct; but she wisely refrained from speaking this thought, and the old baron walked away to glance through a slit in the stone wall at the figure of the now distant knight.  Prince Marvel was riding swiftly toward the brow of the hill, and shortly his great war-horse mounted the ascent and disappeared on its farther slope.  The youth's heart was merry and light, and he reflected joyously, as he rode along, that a whole year of freedom and fascinating adventure lay before him.  The valley in which he now found himself was very beautiful, the soft grass beneath his horse's feet being sprinkled with bright flowers, while clumps of trees stood here and there to break the monotony of the landscape.  For an hour the prince rode along, rejoicing in the free motion of his horse and breathing in the perfume-laden air.  Then he found he had crossed the valley and was approaching a series of hills.  These were broken by huge rocks, the ground being cluttered with boulders of rough stone.  His horse speedily found a pathway leading through these rocks, but was obliged to proceed at a walk, turning first one way and then another as the path zigzagged up the hill.  Presently, being engaged in deep thought and little noting the way, Prince Marvel rode between two high walls of rock standing so close together that horse and rider could scarcely pass between the sides. Having traversed this narrow space some distance the wall opened suddenly upon a level plat of ground, where grass and trees grew.  It was not a very big place, but was surely the end of the path, as all around it stood bare walls so high and steep that neither horse nor man could climb them.  In the side of the rocky wall facing the entrance the traveler noticed a hollow, like the mouth of a cave, across which was placed an iron gate.  And above the gateway was painted in red letters on the gray stone the following words:               WUL-TAKIM          KING OF THIEVES               ------         HIS TREASURE HOUSE              KEEP OUT   Prince Marvel laughed on reading this, and after getting down from his saddle he advanced to the iron gate and peered through its heavy bars.  \"I have no idea who this Wul-Takim is,\" he said, \"for I know nothing at all of the ways of men outside the forest in which I have always dwelt. But thieves are bad people, I am quite sure, and since Wul-Takim is the king of thieves he must be by far the worst man on this island.\"  Then he saw, through the bars of the gate, that a great cavern lay beyond, in which were stacked treasures of all sorts: rich cloths, golden dishes and ornaments, gemmed coronets and bracelets, cleverly forged armor, shields and battle-axes.  Also there were casks and bales of merchandise of every sort.  The gate appeared to have no lock, so Prince Marvel opened it and walked in.  Then he perceived, perched on the very top of a pyramid of casks, the form of a boy, who sat very still and watched him with a look of astonishment upon his face.  \"What are you doing up there?\" asked the prince.  \"Nothing,\" said the boy.  \"If I moved the least little bit this pile of casks would topple over, and I should be thrown to the ground.\"  \"Well,\" returned the prince, \"what of it?\"  But just then he glanced at the ground and saw why the boy did not care to tumble down.  For in the earth were planted many swords, with their sharp blades pointing upward, and to fall upon these meant serious wounds and perhaps death.  \"Oh, ho!\" cried Marvel; \"I begin to understand.  You are a prisoner.\"  \"Yes; as you will also be shortly,\" answered the boy.  \"And then you will understand another thing--that you were very reckless ever to enter this cave.\"  \"Why?\" inquired the prince, who really knew little of the world, and was interested in everything he saw and heard.  \"Because it is the stronghold of the robber king, and when you opened that gate you caused a bell to ring far down on the hillside.  So the robbers are now warned that an enemy is in their cave, and they will soon arrive to make you a prisoner, even as I am.\"  \"Ah, I see!\" said the prince, with a laugh, \"It is a rather clever contrivance; but having been warned in time I should indeed be foolish to be caught in such a trap.\"  With this he half drew his sword, but thinking that robbers were not"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/51801"],["title","The Immortals (#1)"],["body"," was as yet unable to say positively that it was responsible for the splendid health he was enjoying. His impatience to know the sociological consequences of the hormone had made him bring a sample of it to Staghorn.  After sniffing at the bottle, Staghorn had poured its contents into Humanac's analyzer.  The giant computer gurgled and belched a few seconds while it assessed the nature of the formula. Then Staghorn connected the analyzer with the machine's memory units.  As far as Humanac was concerned, the Y Hormone was now an accepted part of human history.  But, except for this one added factor, the rest of Humanac's vast memory was solidly based upon the complete known history of the earth and the human race. Its principles of operation were the same as those controlling other electronic \"brains,\" which could be programmed to predict tides, weather, election results or the state of a department-store inventory at any given date in the future. Humanac differed chiefly in the tremendously greater capacity of its memory cells. Over the years it had digested thousands of books, codifying and coordinating the information as fast as it was received. Its photocells had recorded millions of visual impressions. Its auditory units had absorbed the music and languages of the centuries. And its methods of evaluation had been given a strictly human touch by feeding into its resistance chambers the cephalic wave patterns produced by the brains of Staghorn's colleagues.         *       *       *       *       *  An added feature, though by no means an original one, was the screen upon which Humanac produced visually the events of the time and place for which the controls were set.  This screen was simply the big end of a cathode-ray tube, similar to those used in television sets. It was adapted from I.B.M.'s 704 electronic computer used by the Vanguard tracking center to produce visual predictions of the orbits of artificial satellites.  Staghorn was constantly having trouble explaining to people that Humanac was not a time machine that could look into the past or future. Its pictures of past events were based upon information already present in its memory cells. Its pictures of future events were predictions calculated according to the laws of probability. But because Humanac, unlike a human, never forgot any of the million and one variables impinging upon any human situation, its predictions were startlingly accurate.  Humanac had never been exposed to pictures of Dr. Peccary's home town nor to those of a girl named Jenny Cheever. It arrived at the likeness of both town and girl through a purely mathematical process.  Staghorn's ultimate purpose in building the machine was to use it in developing a true science of history. Because Humanac was only a machine, Staghorn could alter its memory at will. By removing the tiny unit upon which the Battle of Hastings was recorded and then \"re-playing\" English history without it, he could find out what actual effect that particular battle had.  He was surprised to discover that it had very little. According to Humanac, the Normans would have conquered England anyway a few months later.  At another time, while reviewing the events leading up to the American Revolution, Humanac had produced a picture of Benjamin Franklin kissing a beautiful young woman in the office of his printing shop. On impulse Staghorn removed this seemingly insignificant event from Humanac's memory and then turned the time dial forward to the present to see what effect, if any, the episode had had upon history.  To his amazement, with that single kiss missing, Humanac produced a picture of the American continent composed of six different nations speaking French, German, Chinese, Hindu, Arabic and Muskogean--the last being the language of an Indian nation occupying the Mississippi Valley and extending northward to Lake Winnepeg. It served as a buffer state between the Hindus and Chinese in the west and the French, Germans and Arabs to the east.         *       *       *       *       *  It was Humanac's ability to predict the future consequences of any hypothetical event, however, that made it an instrument capable of revolutionizing history. Once its dependability was thoroughly established, it would be possible for a Secretary of State to submit to Humanac the contents of a note intended for a foreign country, then turn the time controls ahead and get Humanac's prediction of the note's consequences.  If the consequences were good, the note would then be sent.  If they were bad, the Secretary could destroy the note and try others--until he composed one that produced the desired result.  Humanac's flaw was that it had no way of explaining the predictions produced on its screen. It merely showed what would happen when and if certain things were done. It left it up to the human operator to figure out why things happened that way.  This was what was troubling Dr. Peccary.  He could see not the remotest relationship between his Y Hormone and the fact that a mathematical probability named Miss Terry should refuse another mathematical probability named Paul permission to climb to the top of a six-foot playground slide.  Meanwhile Staghorn had been using the fine adjustment on the geographic locator and now grunted his satisfaction. \"Good! We're in the building, at least.\"  On the screen was a dusky corridor. On either side of it were classroom doors, some closed, some ajar. Staghorn moved his hand from the fine adjustment to the even more delicate vernier control which permitted him to shift the geographic focus inches at a time. The focus drifted slowly forward to one of the half-open doors, and then he and Dr. Peccary were able to see into the classroom.  It was deserted. Desks were thick with dust. Books, yellow with age, were strewn on the floor.  Staghorn's hand sought the vernier control again. The picture led them on down the corridor to another open door.  Again it was a scene of desolation.  \"This can have nothing to do with my Y Hormone!\" Peccary insisted.  \"Then why is your picture on the wall there?\" Staghorn said with a note of malicious pleasure.  Dr. Peccary looked and started. On the classroom wall was a faded photograph of himself. Except that he was wearing a different suit in the picture, he looked just as he looked at the present moment. Staghorn got a closer focus on the photograph so that Peccary could read the legend beneath it. _Dr. Clarence Peccary, the man who gave the world the Y Hormone._  \"All right then,\" said Peccary, somewhat mollified by this tribute. \"If they put my picture on school room walls a hundred years from now, it means I'm an honored man, a man the world admires. And therefore the Y Hormone _can't_ be the cause of all this desolation!\"  \"I've found that Humanac's reasoning and human reasoning differ in many ways,\" said Staghorn. On the screen they were out in the corridor again when from somewhere ahead came a woman's voice.  \"You may recite now, Paul. Please stand up.\"  \"Ah, that sounds like Miss Terry,\" said Staghorn. He fingered the vernier control. The focal point slid forward along the corridor.  \"Stand up and recite, Paul,\" Miss Terry said more sharply.  \"I think they're in the room on the left,\" said Peccary.   II  The focus shifted to the open door and then Peccary and Staghorn could see into the classroom. This one was in slightly better order than the others and was occupied by two people. In front sat Miss Terry, obviously the teacher, and at one of the desks sat Paul. He seemed to be the entire class. At Miss Terry's urging he was coming to his feet, his face still stained with tears. He held his book a few inches from his nose and stared over the top of it sullenly.  \"Go ahead, Paul,\" said Miss Terry, sweetly stubborn. \"I'm waiting.\"  Paul looked at his book and read from it in a monotone, enunciating each word carefully as though it had no relationship to the other words. \"I am a human being and as long as I obey the six rules I shall live forever.\"  \"Very good, Paul. Now read the six rules.\"  Paul sniffled loudly and commenced reading again. \"Rule one: I must never go near fire or my clothing may catch aflame and burn me up. Rule two: I must keep away from deep water or I may fall in and drown. Rule three: I must stay away from high places or I may fall and dash my brains out.\" He paused to sniffle and wipe his nose on his sleeve, then sighed and continued dismally. \"Rule four: I must never play with sharp things or I may cut myself and bleed to death. Rule five: I must never ride horses or I may fall off and break my neck.\" Paul paused, lowering his book.  \"And the sixth rule?\" said Miss Terry. \"Go ahead and read the sixth rule.\"  Reluctantly Paul lifted his book. \"Rule six: Starting when I'm twenty-one I must take Dr. Peccary's Y Hormone once a week to keep me young and healthy forever.\"  \"Excellent, Paul!\" said Miss Terry. \"And which rule were you breaking just now on the playground?\"  \"I was breaking Rule Three,\" Paul said, then quoted sadly, \"I must stay away from high places or I may fall and dash my brains out.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Dr. Peccary was on his feet stomping around in front of the computer. \"Sheer idiocy,\" he muttered. \"He doesn't have any brains to dash out! I'll admit that a computer with sufficient information about the state of the world might be able to make accurate predictions of events a few months or possibly a year into the future--but not one hundred years! In that long an interval even the most trivial error could distort every circuit in the machine.\" He jabbed a finger toward the screen where Paul was seated at his desk again. \"And that's what that picture is--a distortion. I'm not going to let it influence me one bit in what I intend to--\" He broke off because of what was happening on the screen.  From somewhere outside the school building came the wail of a deep-throated alarm. Both Miss Terry and"]]]
