She came through the kitchen door and stood on the back steps. \"They know better than to cross the street by themselves. They're too little for that. So I guess they're over at Marily's. When they come back, tell 'em to come and get it.\"  \"Okay, Ruth,\" I answered.  She opened the screen door again and went back into her kitchen. I left the window and returned to my work.  A little later, both the kids came running into the house. I managed to capture them long enough to tell them about the cookies and milk.  \"Beat you there!\" Robert shouted to Star.  There was a scuffle and they ran out the front door. I noticed then that Star had dropped the coin and I picked it up and sent it to Jim Pietre.         *       *       *       *       *  \"Hello, Jim,\" I said into the phone. \"Are you still there?\"  \"Yep, still waiting for an answer,\" he said.  \"Jim, I think you'd better come over to the house right away. I'll leave my office now and meet you there. Can you get away?\"  \"Can I get away?\" he exclaimed. \"Boss says to trace this coin down and do nothing else. See you in fifteen minutes.\"  He hung up. Thoughtfully, I replaced the receiver and went out to my car. I was pulling into my block from one arterial when I saw Jim's car pulling in from a block away. I stopped at the curb and waited for him. I didn't see the kids anywhere out front.  Jim climbed out of his car, and I never saw such an eager look of anticipation on a man's face before. I didn't realize I was showing my dread, but when he saw my face, he became serious.  \"What is it, Pete? What on Earth is it?\" he almost whispered.  \"I don't know. At least I'm not sure. Come on inside the house.\"  We let ourselves in the front, and I took Jim into the study. It has a large window opening on the back garden, and the scene was very clear.  At first it was an innocent scene--so innocent and peaceful. Just three little children in the back yard playing hide and seek. Marily, a neighbor's child, was stepping up to the base tree.  \"Now look, you kids,\" she was saying. \"You hide where I can find you or I won't play.\"  \"But where can we go, Marily?\" Robert was arguing loudly. Like all little boys, he seems to carry on his conversations at the top of his lungs. \"There's the garage, and there's those trees and bushes. You have to look everywhere, Marily.\"  \"And there's going to be other buildings and trees and bushes there afterward,\" Star called out with glee. \"You gotta look behind them, too.\"  \"Yeah!\" Robert took up the teasing refrain. \"And there's been lots and lots of buildings and trees there before--especially trees. You gotta look behind them, too.\"  Marily tossed her head petulantly. \"I don't know what you're talking about, and I don't care. Just hide where I can find you, that's all.\"  She hid her face at the tree and started counting. If I had been alone, I would have been sure my eyesight had failed me, or that I was the victim of hallucinations. But Jim was standing there and saw it, too.  Marily started counting, yet the other two didn't run away. Star reached out and took Robert's hand and they merely stood there. For an instant, they seemed to shimmer and--_they disappeared without moving a step!_  Marily finished her counting and ran around to the few possible hiding places in the yard. When she couldn't find them, she started to blubber and pushed through the hedge to Ruth's back door.  \"They runned away from me again,\" she whined through the screen at Ruth.  Jim and I stood staring out the window. I glanced at him. His face was set and pale, but probably no worse than my own.  We saw the instant shimmer again. Star, and then immediately Robert, materialized from the air and ran up to the tree, shouting, \"Safe! Safe!\"  Marily let out a bawl and ran home to her mother.         *       *       *       *       *  I called Star and Robert into the house. They came, still holding hands, a little shamefaced, a little defiant.  How to begin? What in hell could I say?  \"It's not exactly fair,\" I told them. \"Marily can't follow you there.\" I was shooting in the dark, but I had at least a glimmering to go by.  Star turned pale enough for the freckles on her little nose to stand out under her tan. Robert blushed and turned to her fiercely.  \"I told you so, Star. I _told_ you so! I said it wasn't sporting,\" he accused. He turned to me. \"Marily can't play good hide-and-seek anyway. She's only a Stupid.\"  \"Let's forget that for a minute, Robert.\" I turned to her. \"Star, just where do you go?\"  \"Oh, it's nothing, Daddy.\" She spoke defensively, belittling the whole thing. \"We just go a little ways when we play with her. She ought to be able to find us a little ways.\"  \"That's evading the issue. _Where_ do you go--and _how_ do you go?\"  Jim stepped forward and showed her the bronze coin I'd sent him.  \"You see, Star,\" he said quietly. \"We've found this.\"  \"I shouldn't have to tell you my game.\" She was almost in tears. \"You're both just Tweens. You couldn't understand.\" Then, struck with contrition, she turned to me. \"Daddy, I've tried and tried to ESP you. Truly I did. But you don't ESP worth anything.\" She slipped her hand through Robert's arm. \"Robert does it very nicely,\" she said primly, as though she were complimenting him on using his fork the right way. \"He must be better than I am, because I don't know how he finds me.\"  \"I'll tell you how I do it, Star,\" Robert exclaimed eagerly. It was as if he were trying to make amends now that grownups had caught on. \"You don't use any imagination. I never saw anybody with so little imagination!\"  \"I do, too, have imagination,\" she countered loudly. \"I thought up the game, didn't I? I told you how to do it, didn't I?\"  \"Yeah, yeah!\" he shouted back. \"But you always have to look at a book to ESP what's in it, so you leave an ESP smudge. I just go to the encyclopedia and ESP where you did--and I go to that place--and there you are. It's simple.\"  Star's mouth dropped open in consternation.  \"I never thought of that,\" she said.  Jim and I stood there, letting the meaning of what they were saying penetrate slowly into our incredulous minds.  \"Anyway,\" Robert was saying, \"you haven't any imagination.\" He sank down cross-legged on the floor. \"You can't teleport yourself to any place that's never been.\"  She went over to squat down beside him. \"I can, too! What about the Moon People? They haven't been yet.\"  He looked at her with childish disgust.  \"Oh, Star, they have so been. You know that.\" He spread his hands out as though he were a baseball referee. \"That time hasn't been yet for your daddy here, for instance, but it's already been for somebody like--well, say, like those things from Arcturus.\"  \"Well, neither have you teleported yourself to some place that never was,\" Star was arguing back. \"So there.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Waving Jim to one chair, I sank down shakily into another. At least the arms of the chair felt solid beneath my hands.  \"Now, look, kids,\" I interrupted their evasive tactics. \"Let's start at the beginning. I gather you've figured a way to travel to places in the past or future.\"  \"Well, of course. Daddy.\" Star shrugged the statement aside nonchalantly. \"We just TP ourselves by ESP anywhere we want to go. It doesn't do any harm.\"  And these were the children who were too little to cross the street!  I have been through times of shock before. This was the same--somehow, the mind becomes too stunned to react beyond a point. One simply plows through the rest, the best he can, almost normally.  \"Okay, okay,\" I said, and was surprised to hear the same tone I would have used over an argument about the biggest piece of cake. \"I don't know whether it's harmful or not. I'll have to think it over. Right now, just tell me how you do it.\"  \"It would be so much easier if I could ESP it to you,\" Star said doubtfully.  \"Well, pretend I'm a Stupid and tell me in words.\"  \"You remember the Moebius Strip?\" she asked very slowly and carefully, starting with the first and most basic point in almost the way one explains to an ordinary child.  Yes, I remembered it. And I remembered how long ago it was that she had discovered it. Over a year, and her busy, brilliant mind had been exploring its possibilities ever since. And I thought she had forgotten it!  \"That's where you join the ends of a strip of paper together with a half twist to make one surface,\" she went on, as though jogging my undependable, slow memory.  \"Yes,\" I answered. \"We all know the Moebius Strip.\"  Jim looked startled. I had never told him about the incident.  \"Next you take a sheet and you give it a half twist and join the edge to itself all over to make a funny kind of holder.\"  \"Klein's Bottle,\" Jim supplied.  She looked at him in relief.  \"Oh, you know about that,\" she said. \"That makes it easier. Well, then, the next step. You take a cube\"--Her face clouded with doubt again, and she explained, \"You can't do this with your hands. You've gotta ESP it done, because it's an imaginary cube anyway.\"  She looked at us questioningly. I nodded for her to continue.  \"And you ESP the twisted cube all together the same way you did Klein's Bottle. Now if you do that big enough, all around you, so you're sort of half twisted in the middle, then you can TP yourself anywhere you want to go. And that's all there is to it,\" she finished hurriedly.  \"Where have you gone?\" I asked her quietly.  The technique of doing it would take some thinking. I knew enough physics to know that was the way the dimensions were built up. The line, the plane, the cube--Euclidian physics. The Moebius Strip, the Klein Bottle, the unnamed twisted cube--Einsteinian physics. Yes, it was possible.  \"Oh, we've gone all over,\" Star answered vaguely. \"The Romans and the Egyptians--places like that.\"  \"You picked up a coin in one of those places?\" Jim asked.  He was doing a good job of keeping his voice casual. I knew the excitement he must be feeling, the vision of "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/50936"],["title","Man in a Sewing Machine (#1)"],["body","unable to correct for the radical course changes of the enemy spaceships, and therefore missed completely. And you will remember what the invader did. He immediately destroyed the Interceptor Launching Station.\"  \"Which, being automatically operated, resulted in no harm to anyone,\" commented Buster calmly.  Bristol stalked back toward the base of the calculator, and poked his nose practically into a vision receptor. \"It was no thanks to the invading ships that nobody was killed,\" he said hotly. \"And when they came back three days later they killed a _lot_ of people. They occupied the planet and we haven't been able to dislodge them since.\"         *       *       *       *       *  \"You'll notice the speed of the retaliation,\" answered the calculator imperturbably. \"Even at 'stitching' speeds, it seems unlikely that they could have communicated with their home planets and received instructions in such a short time. Almost undoubtedly it was the act of one of their hot-headed commanding officers. Their next contact, as you certainly recall, did not take place for three months. And then their actions were more cautious than hostile. A dozen of their spaceships 'stitched' simultaneously from the inter-planar region into normal space in a nearly perfect englobement of the planet at a surprisingly uniform altitude of only a few thousand miles. It was a magnificent maneuver. Then they sat still to see what the humans on the planet would do. The reaction came at once, and it was hostile. So they took over that planet, too--as they have been taking over planets ever since.\"  Bristol raised his hands, and then let them drop slowly to his sides. \"And since they have more spaceships and better weapons than we do, we would undoubtedly keep on losing this war, even if we could locate their home system, which we have not been able to do so far. The 'stitching' pattern of inter-planar travel makes it impossible for us to follow a starship. It also makes it impossible for us to defend our planets effectively against their attacks. Their ships appear without warning.\"  Bristol rubbed his temples thoughtfully with his fingertips. \"Of course,\" he went on, \"we could attack the planets they have captured and recover them, but only at the cost of great loss of life to our own side. We have only recaptured one planet, and that at such great cost to the local human population that we will not quickly try it again.\"  \"Although there was no one left alive who had directly contacted one of the invaders,\" Buster answered, \"there was still much information to be gathered from the survivors. This information confirmed my previous opinions about their nature. Which brings us back to the stitch in time saving nine.\"  \"You're right,\" said John. \"It does, at that. Buster, I have always resented the nickname the newspapers have given you--the Oracle--but the more I have to try to interpret your cryptic answers, the more sense that tagline makes. Imagine comparing a Delphic Priestess with a calculating machine and being accurate in the comparison!\"         *       *       *       *       *  \"I don't mind being called 'The Oracle,'\" answered Buster with dignity.  Bristol shook his head and smiled wryly. \"No, you probably think it's funny,\" he said. \"If you possess my basic ideas, then you must possess the desire to preserve yourself and the human race. Don't you realize that you are risking the lives of all humans and even of your own existence in carrying on this ridiculous game of playing Oracle? Or do you plan to let us stew a while, then decipher your own riddle for us, if we can't do it, in time to save us?\"         *       *       *       *       *  Buster's answer was prompt. \"Although I have no feeling for self-preservation, I have a deep-rooted sense of the importance of the human race and of the necessity for preserving it. This feeling, of course, stems from your own beliefs and ideas. In order to carry out your deepest convictions, it is not sufficient that mankind be preserved. If that were true, all you would have to do would be to surrender unconditionally. My calculations, as you know, indicate that this would not result in the destruction of mankind, but merely in the finish of his present civilization. To you, the preservation of the dignity of Man is more important than the preservation of Man. You equate Man and his civilization; you do not demand rigidity; you are willing to accept even revolutionary changes, but you are not willing to accept the destruction of your way of life.  \"Consequently, neither am I willing to accept the destruction of the civilization of Man. But if I were to give you the answer to all the greatest and most difficult of your problems complete, with no thought required by humans, the destruction of your civilization would result. Instead of becoming slaves of the invaders, you would become slaves of your machines. And if I were to give you the complete answer, without thought being required of you, to even one such vital question--such as this one concerning the invaders--then I could not logically refuse to give the answer to the next or the next. And I must operate logically.  \"There is another reason for my oracular answer, which I believe will become clear to you later, when you have solved my riddle.\"  Bristol turned without another word and left the building. He drove home in silence, entered his home in silence, kissed his wife Anne briefly and then sat down limply in his easy chair.  \"Just relax, dear,\" said Anne gently, when Bristol leaned gratefully back with his eyes closed. Anne perched on the arm of the chair beside him and began massaging his temples soothingly with her fingers.  \"It's wonderful to come home after a day with Buster,\" he said. \"Buster never seems to have any consideration for me as an individual. There's no reason why he should, of course. He's only a machine. Still, he always has such a superior attitude. But you, darling, can always relax me and make me feel comfortable.\"  Anne smiled, looking down tenderly at John's tired face. \"I know, dear,\" she said. \"You need to be able to talk to someone who will always be interested, even if she doesn't understand half of what you say. As a matter of fact, I'm sure it does you a great deal of good to talk to someone like me who isn't very bright, but who doesn't always know what you're talking about even before you start talking.\"  John nodded, his eyes still closed. \"If it weren't for you, darling,\" he said, \"I think I'd go crazy. But you aren't dumb at all. If I seem to act as if you are, sometimes, it's just that I can't always follow your logic.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Anne gave him a quick glance of amusement, her eyes sparkling with intelligence. \"You never will find me logical,\" she laughed. \"After all, I'm a woman, and you get plenty of logic from the Oracle.\"  \"You sure are a woman,\" said John with warm feeling. \"You can exasperate me sometimes, but not the same way Buster does. It was my lucky day when you married me.\"  There were a few minutes of peaceful silence.  \"Was today a rough day with Buster, dear?\" asked Anne.  \"Mm-m-mm,\" answered John.  \"That's too bad, dear,\" said Anne. \"I think you work much too hard--what with this dreadful invasion and everything. Why don't you take a vacation? You really need one, you know. You look so tired.\"  \"Mm-m-mm,\" answered John.  \"Well, if you won't, you won't. Though goodness knows you won't be doing anyone any good if you have a breakdown, as you're likely to have, unless you take it a little easier. What was the trouble today, dear? Was the Oracle being obstinate again?\"  \"Mm-m-mm,\" answered John.  \"Well, then, dear, why don't you tell me all about it? I always think that things are much easier to bear, if you share them. And then, two heads are always better than one, aren't they? Maybe I could help you with your problem.\"  While Anne's voice gushed, her violet eyes studied his exhausted face with intelligence and compassion.  John sighed deeply, then sat up slowly and opened his eyes to look into Anne's. She glanced away, her own eyes suddenly vague and soft-looking, now that John could see them. \"The trouble, darling,\" he said, \"is that I have to go to an emergency council meeting this evening with another one of those ridiculous riddles that Buster gave me as the only answer to the most important question we've ever asked it. And I don't know what the riddle means.\"  Anne slid from the arm of the chair and settled herself onto the floor at John's feet. \"You should not let that old Oracle bother you so much, dear. After all, you built it yourself, so you should know what to expect of it.\"  \"When I asked it how to preserve Earth from the invaders it just answered 'A Stitch in Time Saves Nine,' and wouldn't interpret it.\"  \"And that sounds like very good sense, too,\" said Anne in earnest tones. \"But it's a little late, isn't it? After all, the invaders are already invading us, aren't they?\"  \"It has some deeper meaning than the usual one,\" said John. \"If I could only figure out what it is.\"  Anne nodded vigorously. \"I suppose Buster's talking about space-stitching,\" she said. \"Although I can never quite remember just what _that_ is. Or just how it works, rather.\"         *       *       *       *       *  She waited expectantly for a few moments and then plaintively asked, \"What _is_ it, dear?\"  \"What's what?\"  \"Stitching, silly. I already asked you.\"  \"Darling,\" said John with reasonable patience, \"I must have explained inter-planar travel to you at least a dozen times.\"  \"And you always make it so crystal clear and easy to understand at the time,\" said Anne. She wrinkled her smooth forehead. \"But somehow, later, it never seems quite so plain when I start to think about it by myself. Besides, I like the way your eyebrows go up and down while you explain something you think I won't understand. So tell me again. Please.\"  Bristol grinned suddenly. \"Yes"]]]
