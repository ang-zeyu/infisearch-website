The field was crowded and he caught some of the buzzing conversation.  \"... never knew one myself, but let me tell you....\"  \"... knew a fellow once who married one, never had a moment's rest afterward....\"  \"... no comparison with colonial women. They got culture....\"  \"... I'd give a lot to know the girl who's got number twenty-five....\"  \"Let's meet back here with the girls who have picked our numbers,\" Hill said. \"Maybe we could trade.\"  Karl nodded, though privately he felt that the number system was just as good as depending on first impressions.  There was a murmur from the crowd and he found his gaze riveted overhead. High above, in the misty blue sky, was a sudden twinkle of fire.  He reached up and wiped his sweaty face with a muddy hand and brushed aside a straggly lock of tangled hair. It wouldn't hurt to try to look his best.  The twinkling fire came nearer.   II  \"A Mr. Macdonald to see you, Mr. Escher.\"  Claude Escher flipped the intercom switch.  \"Please send him right in.\"  That was entirely superfluous, he thought, because MacDonald would come in whether Escher wanted him to or not.  The door opened and shut with a slightly harder bang than usual and Escher mentally braced himself. He had a good hunch what the problem was going to be and why it was being thrown in their laps.  MacDonald made himself comfortable and sat there for a few minutes, just looking grim and not saying anything. Escher knew the psychology by heart. A short preliminary silence is always more effective in browbeating subordinates than an initial furious bluster.  He lit a cigarette and tried to outwait MacDonald. It wasn't easy--MacDonald had great staying powers, which was probably why he was the head of the department.  Escher gave in first. \"Okay, Mac, what's the trouble? What do we have tossed in our laps now?\"  \"You know the one--colonization problem. You know that when we first started to colonize, quite a large percentage of the male population took to the stars, as the saying goes. The adventuresome, the gamblers, the frontier type all decided they wanted to head for other worlds, to get away from it all. The male of the species is far more adventuresome than the female; the men left--but the women didn't. At least, not in nearly the same large numbers.  \"Well, you see the problem. The ratio of women to men here on Earth is now something like five to three. If you don't know what that means, ask any man with a daughter. Or any psychiatrist. Husband-hunting isn't just a pleasant pastime on Earth. It's an earnest cutthroat business and I'm not just using a literary phrase.\"  He threw a paper on Escher's desk. \"You'll find most of the statistics about it in that, Claude. Notice the increase in crimes peculiar to women. Shoplifting, badger games, poisonings, that kind of thing. It's quite a list. You'll also notice the huge increase in petty crimes, a lot of which wouldn't have bothered the courts before. In fact, they wouldn't even have been considered crimes. You know why they are now?\"  Escher shook his head blankly.  \"Most of the girls in the past who didn't catch a husband,\" MacDonald continued, \"grew up to be the type of old maid who's dedicated to improving the morals and what-not of the rest of the population. We've got more puritanical societies now than we ever had, and we have more silly little laws on the books as a result. You can be thrown in the pokey for things like violating a woman's privacy--whatever that means--and she's the one who decides whether what you say or do is a violation or not.\"  Escher looked bored. \"Not to mention the new prohibition which forbids the use of alcohol in everything from cough medicines to hair tonics. Or the cleaned up moral code that reeks--if you'll pardon the expression--of purity. Sure, I know what you mean. And you know the solution. All we have to do is get the women to colonize.\"  MacDonald ran his fingers nervously through his hair.  \"But it won't be easy, and that's why it's been given to us. It's your baby, Claude. Give it a lot of thought. Nothing's impossible, you know.\"  \"Perpetual motion machines are,\" Escher said quietly. \"And pulling yourself up by your boot-straps. But I get the point. Nevertheless, women just don't want to colonize. And who can blame them? Why should they give up living in a luxury civilization, with as many modern conveniences as this one, to go homesteading on some wild, unexplored planet where they have to work their fingers to the bone and play footsie with wild animals and savages who would just as soon skin them alive as not?\"  \"What do you advise I do, then?\" MacDonald demanded. \"Go back to the Board and tell them the problem is not solvable, that we can't think of anything?\"  Escher looked hurt. \"Did I say that? I just said it wouldn't be easy.\"  \"The Board is giving you a blank check. Do anything you think will pay off. We have to stay within the letter of the law, of course, but not necessarily the spirit.\"  \"When do they have to have a solution?\"  \"As soon as possible. At least within the year. By that time the situation will be very serious. The psychologists say that what will happen then won't be good.\"  \"All right, by then we'll have the answer.\"  MacDonald stopped at the door. \"There's another reason why they want it worked out. The number of men applying to the Colonization Board for emigration to the colony planets is falling off.\"  \"How come?\"  MacDonald smiled. \"On the basis of statistics alone, would you want to emigrate from a planet where the women outnumber the men five to three?\"  When MacDonald had gone, Escher settled back in his chair and idly tapped his fingers on the desk-top. It was lucky that the Colonization Board worked on two levels. One was the well-publicized, idealistic level where nothing was too good and every deal was 99 and 44/100 per cent pure. But when things got too difficult for it to handle on that level, they went to Escher and MacDonald's department. The coal mine level. Nothing was too low, so long as it worked. Of course, if it didn't work, you took the lumps, too.  He rummaged around in his drawer and found a list of the qualifications set up by the Board for potential colonists. He read the list slowly and frowned. You had to be physically fit for the rigors of space travel, naturally, but some of the qualifications were obviously silly. You couldn't guarantee physical perfection in the second generation, anyway.  He tore the qualification list in shreds and dropped it in the disposal chute. That would have to be the first to go.  There were other things that could be done immediately. For one thing, as it stood now, you were supposed to be financially able to colonize. Obviously a stupid and unappealing law. That would have to go next.  He picked up the sheet of statistics that MacDonald had left and read it carefully. The Board could legalize polygamy, but that was no solution in the long run. Probably cause more problems than it would solve. Even with women as easy to handle as they were nowadays, one was still enough.  Which still left him with the main problem of how to get people to colonize who didn't _want_ to colonize.  The first point was to convince them that they wanted to. The second point was that it might not matter whether they wanted to or not.  No, it shouldn't be hard to solve at all--provided you held your nose, silenced your conscience, and were willing to forget that there was such a thing as a moral code.   III  Phyllis Hanson put the cover over her typewriter and locked the correspondence drawer. Another day was done, another evening about to begin.  She filed into the washroom with the other girls and carefully redid her face. It was getting hard to disguise the worry lines, to paint away the faint crow's-feet around her eyes.  She wasn't, she admitted to herself for the thousandth time, what you would call beautiful. She inspected herself carefully in her compact mirror. In a sudden flash of honesty, she had to admit that she wasn't even what you would call pretty. Her face was too broad, her nose a fraction too long, and her hair was dull. Not homely, exactly--but not pretty, either.  Conversation hummed around her, most of it from the little group in the corner, where the extreme few who were married sat as practically a race apart. Their advice was sought, their suggestions avidly followed.  \"Going out tonight, Phyl?\"  She hesitated a moment, then slowly painted on the rest of her mouth. The question was technically a privacy violator, but she thought she would sidestep it this time, instead of refusing to answer point-blank.  \"I thought I'd stay home tonight. Have a few things I want to rinse out.\"  The black-haired girl next to her nodded sympathetically. \"Sure, Phyl, I know what you mean. Just like the rest of us--waiting for the phone to ring.\"  Phyllis finished washing up and then left the office, carefully noting the girl who was waiting for the boss. The girl was beautiful in a hard sort of way, a platinum blonde with an entertainer's busty figure. Waiting for a plump, middle-aged man like a stagestruck kid outside a theatre.  At home, in her small two-room bachelor-girl apartment, she stripped and took a hot, sudsing shower, then stepped out and toweled herself in front of a mirror. She frowned slightly. You didn't know whether you should keep yourself in trim just on some off-chance, or give up and let yourself go.  She fixed dinner, took a moderately long time doing the dishes, and went through the standard routine of getting a book and curling up on the sofa. It was a good book of the boot-legged variety--scientifically written with enough surplus heroes and heroines and lushly described love affairs to hold anybody's interest.  It held hers for ten pages and then she threw the book across the room, getting a savage delight at the way the pages ripped"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/51268"],["title","The Girls From Earth (#2)"],["body"," fluttered to the floor.  What was the use of kidding herself any longer, of trying to live vicariously and hoping that some day she would have a home and a husband? She was thirty now; the phone hadn't rung in the last three years. She might as well spend this evening as she had spent so many others--call up the girls for a bridge game and a little gossip, though heaven knew you always ended up envying the people you were gossiping about.  Perhaps she should have joined one of the organizations at the office that did something like that seven nights out of every seven. A bridge game or a benefit for some school or a talk on art. Or she could have joined the Lecture of the Week club, or the YWCA, or any one of the other government-sponsored clubs designed to fill the void in a woman's life.  But bridge games and benefits and lectures didn't take the place of a husband and family. She was kidding herself again.  She got up and retrieved the battered book, then went over to the mail slot. She hadn't had time to open her mail that morning; most of the time it wasn't worth the effort. Advertisements for book clubs, lecture clubs, how to win at bridge and canasta....  Her fingers sprang the metal tabs on a large envelope and she took out the contents and spread it wide.  She gasped. It was a large poster, about a yard square. A man was on it, straddling a tiny city and a small panorama of farms and forests at his feet. He was a handsome specimen, with wavy blond hair and blue eyes and a curly mat on his bare chest that was just enough to be attractive without being apelike. He held an axe in his hands and was eyeing her with a clearly inviting look of brazen self-confidence.  _It was definitely a privacy violator and she should notify the authorities immediately!_  Bright lettering at the top of the poster shrieked: \"Come to the Colonies, the Planets of Romance!\"  _Whoever had mailed it should be arrested and imprisoned! Preying on...._  The smaller print at the bottom was mostly full of facts and figures. The need for women out on the colony planets, the percentage of men to women--a startling disproportion--the comfortable cities that weren't nearly as primitive as people had imagined, and the recently reduced qualifications.  She caught herself admiring the man on the poster. Naturally, it was an artist's conception, but even so....  And the cities were far in advance of the frontier settlements, where you had to battle disease and dirty savages.  It was all a dream. She had never done anything like this and she wouldn't think of doing it now. And had any of her friends seen the poster? Of course, they probably wouldn't tell her even if they had.  _But the poster was a violation of privacy. Whoever had sent it had taken advantage of information that was none of their business. It was up to her to notify the authorities!_         *       *       *       *       *  She took another look at the poster.  The letter she finally finished writing was very short. She addressed it to the box number in the upper left-hand corner of the plain wrapper that the poster had come in.   IV  The dress lay on the counter, a small corner of it trailing off the edge. It was a beautiful thing, sheer sheen satin trimmed in gold nylon thread. It was the kind of gown that would make anybody who wore it look beautiful. The price was high, much too high for her to pay. She knew she would never be able to buy it.  But she didn't intend to buy it.  She looked casually around and noted that nobody was watching her. There was another woman a few counters down and a man, obviously embarrassed, at the lingerie counter. Nobody else was in sight. It was a perfect time. The clerk had left to look up a difficult item that she had purposely asked for and probably wouldn't be back for five minutes.  Time enough, at any rate.  The dress was lying loose, so she didn't have to pry it off any hangers. She took another quick look around, then hurriedly bundled it up and dropped it in her shopping bag.  She had taken two self-assured steps away from the counter when she felt a hand on her shoulder. The grip was firm and muscular and she knew she had lost the game. She also knew that she had to play it out to the end, to grasp any straw.  \"Let go of me!\" she ordered in a frostily offended voice.  \"Sorry, miss,\" the man said politely, \"but I think we have a short trip to take.\"  She thought for a moment of brazening it out further and then gave up. She'd get a few weeks or months in the local detention building, a probing into her background for the psychological reasons that prompted her to steal, and then she'd be out again.  They couldn't do anything to her that mattered.  She shrugged and followed the detective calmly. None of the shoppers had looked up. None seemed to notice anything out of the ordinary.  In the detention building she thanked her good luck that she was facing a man for the sentence, instead of one of the puritanical old biddies who served on the bench. She even found a certain satisfaction in the presence of the cigar smoke and the blunt, earthy language that floated in from the corridor.  \"Why did you steal it?\" the judge asked. He held up the dress, which, she noted furiously, didn't look nearly as nice as it had under the department store lights.  \"I don't have anything to say,\" she said. \"I want to see a lawyer.\"  She could imagine what he was thinking. Another tough one, another plain jane who was shoplifting for a thrill.  And she probably was. You had to do _something_ nowadays. You couldn't just sit home and chew your fingernails, or run out and listen to the endless boring lectures on art and culture.  \"Name?\" he asked in a tired voice.  She knew the statistics he wanted. \"Ruby Johnson, 32, 145 pounds, brown hair and green eyes. Prints on file.\"  The judge leaned down and mentioned something to the bailiff, who left and presently came back with a ledger. The judge opened it and ran his fingers down one of the pages.  The sentence would probably be the usual, she thought--six months and a fine, or perhaps a little more when they found out she had a record for shoplifting.  A stranger in the courtroom in the official linens of the government suddenly stepped up beside the judge and looked at the page. She could hear a little of what he said:  \"... anxiety neurosis ... obvious feeling of not being wanted ... probably steals to attract attention ... recommend emigration.\"  \"In view of some complicating factors, we're going to give you a choice,\" the judge finally said. \"You can either go to the penitentiary for ten years and pay a $10,000 fine, or you can ship out to the colony planets and receive a five-hundred-dollar immigration bonus.\"  She thought for a minute that she hadn't heard right. Ten thousand dollars and ten years! It was obvious that the state was interested in neither the fine nor in paying her room and board for ten years. She could recognize a squeeze play when she saw it, but there was nothing she could do about it.  \"I wouldn't call that a choice,\" she said sourly. \"I'll ship out.\"   V  Suzanne was proud of the apartment. It had all the modern conveniences, like the needle shower with the perfume dispenser, the built-in soft-drink bar in the library, the all-communications set, and the electrical massager. It was a nice, comfortable setup, an illusion of security in an ever-changing world.  She lit a cigarette and chuckled. Mrs. Burger, the fat old landlady, thought she kept up the apartment by working as a buyer for one of the downtown stores.  Well, maybe some day she would.  But not today. And not tonight.  The phone rang and she answered in a casual tone. She talked for a minute, then let a trace of sultriness creep into her voice. The conversation wasn't long.  She let the receiver fall back on the base and went into the bedroom to get a hat box. She wouldn't need much; she'd probably be back that same night.  It was a nice night and since the address was only a few blocks away, she decided to walk it. She blithely ignored the curious stares from other pedestrians, attracted by the sharp, clicking sound of her heels on the sidewalk.  The address was a brownstone that looked more like an office building than anything else, but then you could never tell. She pressed the buzzer and waited a moment for the sound to echo back and forth on the inside. She pressed it again and a moment later a suave young man appeared in the doorway.  \"Miss Carstens?\"  She smiled pertly.  \"We've been expecting you.\"  She wondered a little at the \"we,\" but dutifully smiled and followed him in.  The glare of the lights inside the office blinded her for a moment. When she could focus them again, her smile became slightly blurry at the edges and then disappeared entirely. She wasn't alone. There was a battery of chairs against one side of the room. She recognized most of the girls sitting in them.  She forced a smile to her lips and tried to laugh.  \"I'm sure there's been some mistake! Why, I never....\"  The young man coughed politely. \"I'm afraid there's been no mistake. Full name, please.\"  \"Suzanne Carstens,\" she said grimly, and gave the other statistics he wanted. She idly wondered what stoolie had peddled the phone numbers.  \"Suzanne Carstens,\" the young man noted, and slowly shook his head. \"A very pretty name, but no doubt not your own. It actually doesn't matter, though. Take a seat over there.\"  She did as he asked and he faced the entire group.  \"I and the other gentlemen here represent the Colonization Board. We've interceded with the local authorities in order to offer you a choice. We would like to ship you out to the colony planets. Naturally, we will pay you the standard emigration bonus of five hundred dollars. The colonists need wives; they offer you--security.\"  He stressed the word slightly.  \"Now, of course, if you don't prefer the colony planets, you can stay behind and face the penalties of ten years in jail"]]]
