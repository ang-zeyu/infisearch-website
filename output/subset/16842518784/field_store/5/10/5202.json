Theodor and Frieda got out their briefcases, switched on projectors, and began silently checking through their material.  Celeste fiddled with the TV and got a newscast. But she found her eyes didn't want to absorb the blocks of print that rather swiftly succeeded each other, so, after a few moments, she shrugged impatiently and switched to audio.  At the noise, the others looked around at her with surprise and some irritation, but in a few moments they were also listening.  \"The two rocket ships sent out from Mars Base to explore the orbital positions of Phobos and Deimos--that is, the volume of space they'd be occupying if their positions had remained normal--report finding masses of dust and larger debris. The two masses of fine debris are moving in the same orbits and at the same velocities as the two vanished moons, and occupy roughly the same volumes of space, though the mass of material is hardly a hundredth that of the moons. Physicists have ventured no statements as to whether this constitutes a confirmation of the Disintegration Hypothesis.  \"However, we're mighty pleased at this news here. There's a marked lessening of tension. The finding of the debris--solid, tangible stuff--seems to lift the whole affair out of the supernatural miasma in which some of us have been tempted to plunge it. One-hundredth of the moons has been found.  \"The rest will also be!\"  Edmund had turned his back on the window. Frieda and Theodor had switched off their projectors.  \"Meanwhile, Earthlings are going about their business with a minimum of commotion, meeting with considerable calm the strange threat to the fabric of their Solar System. Many, of course, are assembled in churches and humanist temples. Kometevskyites have staged helicopter processions at Washington, Peking, Pretoria, and Christiana, demanding that instant preparations be made for--and I quote--'Earth's coming leap through space.' They have also formally challenged all astronomers to produce an explanation other than the one contained in that strange book so recently conjured from oblivion, _The Dance of the Planets_.  \"That about winds up the story for the present. There are no new reports from Interplanetary Radar, Astronomy, or the other rocket ships searching in the extended Mars volume. Nor have any statements been issued by the various groups working on the problem in Astrophysics, Cosmic Ecology, the Congress for the Discovery of New Purposes, and so forth. Meanwhile, however, we can take courage from the words of a poem written even before Dr. Kometevsky's book:      \"This Earth is not the steadfast place     We landsmen build upon;     From deep to deep she varies pace,     And while she comes is gone.     Beneath my feet I feel     Her smooth bulk heave and dip;     With velvet plunge and soft upreel     She swings and steadies to her keel     Like a gallant, gallant ship.\"         *       *       *       *       *  While the TV voice intoned the poem, growing richer as emotion caught it up, Celeste looked around her at the others. Frieda, with her touch of feminine helplessness showing more than ever through her business-like poise. Theodor leaning forward from his scarlet cloak thrown back, smiling the half-smile with which he seemed to face even the unknown. Black Edmund, masking a deep uncertainty with a strong show of decisiveness.  In short, her family. She knew their every quirk and foible. And yet now they seemed to her a million miles away, figures seen through the wrong end of a telescope.  Were they really a family? Strong sources of mutual strength and security to each other? Or had they merely been playing family, experimenting with their notions of complex marriage like a bunch of silly adolescents? Butterflies taking advantage of good weather to wing together in a glamorous, artificial dance--until outraged Nature decided to wipe them out?  As the poem was ending, Celeste saw the door open and Rosalind come slowly in. The Golden Woman's face was white as the paths she had been treading.  Just then the TV voice quickened with shock. \"News! Lunar Observatory One reports that, although Jupiter is just about to pass behind the Sun, a good coronagraph of the planet has been obtained. Checked and rechecked, it admits of only one interpretation, which Lunar One feels duty-bound to release. _Jupiter's fourteen moons are no longer visible!_\"  The chorus of remarks with which the Wolvers would otherwise have received this was checked by one thing: the fact that Rosalind seemed not to hear it. Whatever was on her mind prevented even that incredible statement from penetrating.  She walked shakily to the table and put down a briefcase, one end of which was smudged with dirt.  Without looking at them, she said, \"Ivan left the Deep Space Bar twenty minutes ago, said he was coming straight here. On my way back I searched the path. Midway I found this half-buried in the dirt. I had to tug to get it out--almost as if it had been cemented into the ground. Do you feel how the dirt seems to be _in_ the leather, as if it had lain for years in the grave?\"  By now the others were fingering the small case of microfilms they had seen so many times in Ivan's competent hands. What Rosalind said was true. It had a gritty, unwholesome feel to it. Also, it felt strangely heavy.  \"And see what's written on it,\" she added.  They turned it over. Scrawled with white pencil in big, hasty, frantic letters were two words:  \"Going down!\"         *       *       *       *       *  _The other gods_, Dotty dreamt, _are combing the whole Universe for us. We have escaped them many times, but now our tricks are almost used up. There are no doors going out of the Universe and our boats are silver beacons to the hunters. So we decide to disguise them in the only way they can be disguised. It is our last chance._         *       *       *       *       *  Edmund rapped the table to gain the family's attention. \"I'd say we've done everything we can for the moment to find Ivan. We've made a thorough local search. A wider one, which we can't conduct personally, is in progress. All helpful agencies have been alerted and descriptions are being broadcast. I suggest we get on with the business of the evening--which may very well be connected with Ivan's disappearance.\"  One by one the others nodded and took their places at the round table. Celeste made a great effort to throw off the feeling of unreality that had engulfed her and focus attention on her microfilms.  \"I'll take over Ivan's notes,\" she heard Edmund say. \"They're mainly about the Deep Shaft.\"  \"How far have they got with that?\" Frieda asked idly. \"Twenty-five miles?\"  \"Nearer thirty, I believe,\" Edmund answered, \"and still going down.\"  At those last two words they all looked up quickly. Then their eyes went toward Ivan's briefcase.         *       *       *       *       *  _Our trick has succeeded_, Dotty dreamt. _The other gods have passed our hiding place a dozen times without noticing. They search the Universe for us many times in vain. They finally decide that we have found a door going out of the Universe. Yet they fear us all the more. They think of us as devils who will some day return through the door to destroy them. So they watch everywhere. We lie quietly smiling in our camouflaged boats, yet hardly daring to move or think, for fear that the faintest echoes of our doings will give them a clue. Hundreds of millions of years pass by. They seem to us no more than drugged hours in a prison._         *       *       *       *       *  Theodor rubbed his eyes and pushed his chair back from the table. \"We need a break.\"  Frieda agreed wearily. \"We've gone through everything.\"  \"Good idea,\" Edmund said briskly. \"I think we've hit on several crucial points along the way and half disentangled them from the great mass of inconsequential material. I'll finish up that part of the job right now and present my case when we're all a bit fresher. Say half an hour?\"  Theodor nodded heavily, pushing up from his chair and hitching his cloak over a shoulder.  \"I'm going out for a drink,\" he informed them.  After several hesitant seconds, Rosalind quietly followed him. Frieda stretched out on a couch and closed her eyes. Edmund scanned microfilms tirelessly, every now and then setting one aside.  Celeste watched him for a minute, then sprang up and started toward the room where Dotty was asleep. But midway she stopped.  _Not my child_, she thought bitterly. _Frieda's her mother, Rosalind her nurse. I'm nothing at all. Just one of the husband's girl friends. A lady of uneasy virtue in a dissolving world._  But then she straightened her shoulders and went on.         *       *       *       *       *  Rosalind didn't catch up with Theodor. Her footsteps were silent and he never looked back along the path whose feeble white glow rose only knee-high, lighting a low strip of shrub and mossy tree trunk to either side, no more.  It was a little chilly. She drew on her gloves, but she didn't hurry. In fact, she fell farther and farther behind the dipping tail of his scarlet cloak and his plodding red shoes, which seemed to move disembodied, like those in the fairy tale.  When she reached the point where she had found Ivan's briefcase, she stopped altogether.  A breeze rustled the leaves, and, moistly brushing her cheek, brought forest scents of rot and mold. After a bit she began to hear the furtive scurryings and scuttlings of forest creatures.  She looked around her half-heartedly, suddenly realizing the futility of her quest. What clues could she hope to find in this knee-high twilight? And they'd thoroughly combed the place earlier in the night.  Without warning, an eerie tingling went through her and she was seized by a horror of the cold, grainy Earth underfoot--an ancestral terror from the days when men"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/51353"],["title","Dr. Kometevsky's Day (#2)"],["body","at ghost stories about graves and tombs.  A tiny detail persisted in bulking larger and larger in her mind--the unnaturalness of the way the Earth had impregnated the corner of Ivan's briefcase, almost as if dirt and leather co-existed in the same space. She remembered the queer way the partly buried briefcase had resisted her first tug, like a rooted plant.  She felt cowed by the mysterious night about her, and literally dwarfed, as if she had grown several inches shorter. She roused herself and started forward.  Something held her feet.  They were ankle-deep in the path. While she looked in fright and horror, they began to sink still lower into the ground.  She plunged frantically, trying to jerk loose. She couldn't. She had the panicky feeling that the Earth had not only trapped but invaded her; that its molecules were creeping up between the molecules of her flesh; that the two were becoming one.  And she was sinking faster. Now knee-deep, thigh-deep, hip-deep, waist-deep. She beat at the powdery path with her hands and threw her body from side to side in agonized frenzy like some sinner frozen in the ice of the innermost circle of the ancients' hell. And always the sense of the dark, grainy tide rose inside as well as around her.  She thought, _he'd just have had time to scribble that note on his briefcase and toss it away._ She jerked off a glove, leaned out as far as she could, and made a frantic effort to drive its fingers into the powdery path. Then the Earth mounted to her chin, her nose, and covered her eyes.  She expected blackness, but it was as if the light of the path stayed with her, making a little glow all around. She saw roots, pebbles, black rot, worn tunnels, worms. Tier on tier of them, her vision penetrating the solid ground. And at the same time, the knowledge that these same sorts of things were coursing up through her.         *       *       *       *       *  And still she continued to sink at a speed that increased, as if the law of gravitation applied to her in a diminished way. She dropped from black soil through gray clay and into pale limestone.  Her tortured, rock-permeated lungs sucked at rock and drew in air. She wondered madly if a volume of air were falling with her through the stone.  A glitter of quartz. The momentary openness of a foot-high cavern with a trickle of water. And then she was sliding down a black basalt column, half inside it, half inside gold-flecked ore. Then just black basalt. And always faster.  It grew hot, then hotter, as if she were approaching the mythical eternal fires.         *       *       *       *       *  At first glance Theodor thought the Deep Space Bar was empty. Then he saw a figure hunched monkeylike on the last stool, almost lost in the blue shadows, while behind the bar, her crystal dress blending with the tiers of sparkling glasses, stood a grave-eyed young girl who could hardly have been fifteen.  The TV was saying, \"... in addition, a number of mysterious disappearances of high-rating individuals have been reported. These are thought to be cases of misunderstanding, illusory apprehension, and impulse traveling--a result of the unusual stresses of the time. Finally, a few suggestible individuals in various parts of the globe, especially the Indian Peninsula, have declared themselves to be 'gods' and in some way responsible for current events.  \"It is thought--\"  The girl switched off the TV and took Theodor's order, explaining casually, \"Joe wanted to go to a Kometevskyite meeting, so I took over for him.\" When she had prepared Theodor's highball, she announced, \"I'll have a drink with you gentlemen,\" and squeezed herself a glass of pomegranate juice.  The monkeylike figure muttered, \"Scotch-and-soda,\" then turned toward Edmund and asked, \"And what is your reaction to all this, sir?\"         *       *       *       *       *  Theodor recognized the shrunken wrinkle-seamed face. It was Colonel Fortescue, a military antique long retired from the Peace Patrol and reputed to have seen actual fighting in the Last Age of Madness. Now, for some reason, the face sported a knowing smile.  Theodor shrugged. Just then the TV \"big news\" light blinked blue and the girl switched on audio. The Colonel winked at Theodor.  \"... confirming the disappearance of Jupiter's moons. But two other utterly fantastic reports have just been received. First, Lunar Observatory One says that it is visually tracking fourteen small bodies which it believes may be the lost moons of Jupiter. They are moving outward from the Solar System at an incredible velocity and are already beyond the orbit of Saturn!\"  The Colonel said, \"Ah!\"  \"Second, Palomar reports a large number of dark bodies approaching the Solar System at an equally incredible velocity. They are at about twice the distance of Pluto, but closing in fast! We will be on the air with further details as soon as possible.\"  The Colonel said, \"Ah-ha!\"  Theodor stared at him. The old man's self-satisfied poise was almost amusing.  \"Are you a Kometevskyite?\" Theodor asked him.  The Colonel laughed. \"Of course not, my boy. Those poor people are fumbling in the dark. Don't you see what's happened?\"  \"Frankly, no.\"  The Colonel leaned toward Theodor and whispered gruffly, \"The Divine Plan. God is a military strategist, naturally.\"  Then he lifted the scotch-and-soda in his clawlike hand and took a satisfying swallow.  \"I knew it all along, of course,\" he went on musingly, \"but this last news makes it as plain as a rocket blast, at least to anyone who knows military strategy. Look here, my boy, suppose you were commanding a fleet and got wind of the enemy's approach--what would you do? Why, you'd send your scouts and destroyers fanning out toward them. Behind that screen you'd mass your heavy ships. Then--\"  \"You don't mean to imply--\" Theodor interrupted.  The girl behind the bar looked at them both cryptically.  \"Of course I do!\" the Colonel cut in sharply. \"It's a war between the forces of good and evil. The bright suns and planets are on one side, the dark on the other. The moons are the destroyers, Jupiter and Saturn are the big battleships, while we're on a heavy cruiser, I'm proud to say. We'll probably go into action soon. Be a corking fight, what? And all by divine strategy!\"  He chuckled and took another big drink. Theodor looked at him sourly. The girl behind the bar polished a glass and said nothing.         *       *       *       *       *  Dotty suddenly began to turn and toss, and a look of terror came over her sleeping face. Celeste leaned forward apprehensively.  The child's lips worked and Celeste made out the sleepy-fuzzy words: \"They've found out where we're hiding. They're coming to get us. No! Please, no!\"  Celeste's reactions were mixed. She felt worried about Dotty and at the same time almost in terror of her, as if the little girl were an agent of supernatural forces. She told herself that this fear was an expression of her own hostility, yet she didn't really believe it. She touched the child's hand.  Dotty's eyes opened without making Celeste feel she had quite come awake. After a bit she looked at Celeste and her little lips parted in a smile.  \"Hello,\" she said sleepily. \"I've been having such funny dreams.\" Then, after a pause, frowning, \"I really am a god, you know. It feels very queer.\"  \"Yes, dear?\" Celeste prompted uneasily. \"Shall I call Frieda?\"  The smile left Dotty's lips. \"Why do you act so nervous around me?\" she asked. \"Don't you love me, Mummy?\"  Celeste started at the word. Her throat closed. Then, very slowly, her face broke into a radiant smile. \"Of course I do, darling. I love you very much.\"  Dotty nodded happily, her eyes already closed again.  There was a sudden flurry of excited voices beyond the door. Celeste heard her name called. She stood up.  \"I'm going to have to go out and talk with the others,\" she said. \"If you want me, dear, just call.\"  \"Yes, Mummy.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Edmund rapped for attention. Celeste, Frieda, and Theodor glanced around at him. He looked more frightfully strained, they realized, than even they felt. His expression was a study in suppressed excitement, but there were also signs of a knowledge that was almost too overpowering for a human being to bear.  His voice was clipped, rapid. \"I think it's about time we stopped worrying about our own affairs and thought of those of the Solar System, partly because I think they have a direct bearing on the disappearances of Ivan end Rosalind. As I told you, I've been sorting out the crucial items from the material we've been presenting. There are roughly four of those items, as I see it. It's rather like a mystery story. I wonder if, hearing those four clues, you will come to the same conclusion I have.\"  The others nodded.  \"First, there are the latest reports from Deep Shaft, which, as you know, has been sunk to investigate deep-Earth conditions. At approximately twenty-nine miles below the surface, the delvers have encountered a metallic obstruction which they have tentatively named the durasphere. It resists their hardest drills, their strongest corrosives. They have extended a side-tunnel at that level for a quarter of a mile. Delicate measurements, made possible by the mirror-smooth metal surface, show that the durasphere has a slight curvature that is almost exactly equal to the curvature of the Earth itself. The suggestion is that deep borings made anywhere in the world would encounter the durasphere at the same depth.  \"Second, the movements of the moons of Mars and Jupiter, and particularly the debris left behind by the moons of Mars. Granting Phobos and Deimos had duraspheres proportional in size to that of Earth, then the debris would roughly equal in amount the material in those two duraspheres' rocky envelopes. The suggestion is that the two duraspheres suddenly burst from their envelopes with such titanic velocity as to leave those disrupted envelopes "]]]
