By the way,\" he said very casually, \"how _did_ you escape?\"  She told him where to go in a primitive, timeless fashion.  \"No,\" Danniels said. \"I'm going to Chicago.\"  \"Not with me,\" the girl assured him quietly. \"We have enough to feed without bringing in another Jonah. Besides you might be an F.B.I. man or something trying to find our escape route.\"  \"I'd be a Mountie then. The F.B.I. has deteriorated pretty badly. Spent itself on political security. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police lends us men and women during peacetime. Up until the War Games anyway--even though Britain would like to see us _constantly_ disrupted. But,\" he said heavily, \"I am not a government agent of any kind. Just the Jonah I appear to be.\"         *       *       *       *       *  She shivered. \"I can't take the responsibility. I can't either expose our escape route--or bring in another mouth, to bring starvation a moment closer.\"  \"Look, what can I call you?\" he demanded in exasperation.  \"Julie. Julie Amprey.\"  \"Abe Danniels. Look, Julie--\"  \"You were named after Lincoln?\" she asked quietly.  \"A long time after. Look, Julie, I want to get into Chicago because of the old Milne Laboratories.\" He caught his breath for a long second. \"They are still standing?\"  Julie nodded and looked ahead, through the insect-spotted windscreen. \"Partial operation, when I left.\"  Danniels gave a low whistle. \"Lord, after all these years!\"  \"We manage.\"  \"Fine! Julie, I'm sure that if I can get back in a laboratory I can find a way of ending this condemned Famine--inside Chicago and outside.\"  \"That sounds a little like delusions of grandeur to me,\" the girl said uncertainly.  \"It was my field for ten years. Before the last War Games. I had time to think while my platoon was hunting me down, after I had been tagged out. I thought faster than I ever thought before.\"  Julie studied his face for a long moment.  \"What was your idea?\"  \"The encephalographic inversion patterns of the Broadcasters,\" he said quickly, \"can be applied to animals as well as human beings, on the right frequencies. Even microscopic animals. Bacteria. If you control the actions of bacteria, you control their reproduction. They could be made to multiply and assume different forms--the form of food, for example.\"  Danniels took a deep breath and plunged into his idea as they drove on through the deepening night. He talked and explained to her, and, in doing so, he clarified points that he hadn't been sure of himself.  He stopped at last because his throat was momentarily too dry to continue.  \"It's too big a responsibility for me,\" Julie said.  Defeat stung him so badly he was afraid he had slumped physically. But it won't be permanent defeat, he told himself. I've come this far and I'll find some other way into Chicago.  \"I haven't the right to turn down something this big,\" Julie said. \"I'll have to let you put it to the mayor and the city council.\"  He relaxed a trifle, condemning himself for the weak luxury. He couldn't afford it yet. He ran his fingers through his flour-dusted green hair and the electricity of the movement dragged off much of the whiteness. His skin, like that of most people, had been given a slight negative charge by molecularization to repell dirt and germs. The powder was anxious to remove itself and dye or bleach refused to take at all.  \"We're nearing the rim of the first blockade zone,\" Danniels told the girl. \"Where to?\"  \"Circle around to first unrestricted beach of the lake shore.\"  \"And then.\"  \"Underwater.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Illegal traffic in and out of Disaster Areas was not completely unheard of. There was a small but steady flow both ways that the authorities could not or would not completely check. The patrols seemingly were as alert as humanly possible. Capture meant permanent oblivion for Disaster Residents under sedation, while Outsiders got prescribed periods of Morphinvert-induced antipode depression of the brain, a rather sophisticated but effective form of torture. A few minutes under the drug frequently had an introspective duration of years. Therefore, under the typical sentence of three months, a felon lived several lifetimes in constant but varying stages of acute agony and post-hysteric terror.  While few personalities survived, many useful human machines were later salvaged by skillful lobotomies.  Lake Michigan beaches were pretty good, Danniels observed. Better than at Hawaii. This one had been cleaned up for a sub-division that had naturally never been completed. It had been christened Falstaff Cove, although it was almost a mathematically straight half mile of off-white sand.  He had shifted to four-wheel drive at the girl's direction and bored through the sand to the southernmost corner of the beach, where it blurred into weeds, rocks, dirt and incredible litter. He braked. The car settled noticeably.  \"There's a two-man submarine out there in the water under the overhang,\" Julie said without prompting. \"We got it from the Armed Forces Day display at Soldier's Field.\"  \"What I'd like to know is how you get the car in and out of it?\" Danniels said.  Anger, disgust and fatigue crossed the girl's face. It was after all, a very young face, he thought. \"We have Outside contacts of sorts,\" she said. \"Nobody trusts them very much.\"  He nodded. There was a lot of money in the Federal Reserve Vaults inside the city.  The two of them got out of the car.  Julie stripped off her jeans, revealing the bottom half of a swimsuit and nicely turned, but pale, legs. \"We'll have to wade out to the sub.\"  \"What about the car?\" Danniels asked. \"Is your friend going to pick it up?\"  \"No! They don't know about this place.\"  He reached in the window and turned the ignition. \"Want me to run it off into the water? You don't want to tag this spot for the authorities.\"  \"No, I--I guess not. I don't know what to do! I'm not used to this kind of thing. I don't know why I _ever_ come. We paid an awful lot for the car....\"  He found the girl's wailing unpleasant. \"It's your car, but take my advice. Let me get rid of it for you.\"  \"But,\" she protested, \"if you run it into the water they can see from the air in daylight. I know. They used to spot our sub. Why not run it off into those weeds and little trees? They'll hide it and maybe we could get it later.\"  It wasn't a bad idea but he didn't feel like admitting it. He gunned the rod into the tangle of undergrowth.         *       *       *       *       *  Danniels came back to the girl with his arms and face laced with scratches from the limbs.  He tried to roll his trousers up at the cuff but they wouldn't stay. So he would spend a soggy ten minutes while they dried.  He told the girl to go ahead and he went after her, marking the spongy wet sand and slapping into the white-scummed, very blue water.  The tiny submarine was just where Julie had said it would be. He waited impatiently as she worked the miniature airlock.  They squeezed down into the metallic hollowness of the interior and Julie screwed the hatch shut, a Mason lid inappropriately on a can of sardines.  There were a lot of white-on-black dials that completely baffled Danniels. He had never been particularly mechanically minded. His field was closer to pure science than practical engineering. Because of this, rather than in spite of it, he had great respect for engineering.  It bothered him being in such close quarters with a woman after the months of isolation as a Jonah, but he had enough of the conventions of society fused into him and enough other problems to attempt easing his discomfort.  \"It isn't much further,\" Julie at last assured him.  He was becoming bored to the point of hysteria. For the past several months he hadn't had much diversion but he had not been confined to what was essentially an oil drum wired for light and sound.  One of the lights changed size and pattern.  He found himself tensing. \"That?\" He pointed.  \"Sonadar,\" Julie hissed. \"Patrol boat above us. Don't make any noise.\"  Danniels pictured the heavily equipped police boat droning past above them and managed to keep quite silent.  Something banged on the hull.  It came from the outside and it rang against the port side, then the starboard. The rhythm was the same, unbroken. Danniels knew somehow the noise from both sides were made by the same agency. Something with a twelve-foot reach.  Something that knew the Morse code.  Da-da-da. Dit-dit-dit. Da-da-da.  S. O. S.  _Help._  \"It's not the police,\" Julie said. \"We've heard it before.\" She added, \"They used to dump non-dangerous amounts of radioactives into the lake,\" as she decided the police boat had gone past and started up the engines again.  Danniels never forgot that call for help. Not as long as he lived.   III  The electron microscope revealed no significant change in the pattern of the bacteria.  Danniels decided to feed the white mice. He got out of his plastic chair and took a small cloth bag of corn from the warped, sticking drawer of the lab table.  Rationing out a handful of the withered kernels, he went down the rows of cages. A few, with steel instead of aluminum wiring, were flecked with rust. The mice inside were all healthy. Danniels was not using them in experiments; he was incapable of taking their lives. But some experimenter after him might use them. In any case, he was also incapable of letting them starve to death.  He had been out of jail less than two weeks.  The city council had thrown him into the Cook County lockup until they decided what to do with him. He hadn't known what happened to the girl, Julie Amprey, for bringing him back with her.  He was surprised to see Chicago functioning as well as it was after thirteen years of isolation. There were still a few cars and trucks running here and there, although most people walked or rode bicycles. But the atmosphere seemed heavy and"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/51833"],["title","Meeting of the Minds (#1)"],["body","his revolver and continued his patrol.         *       *       *       *       *  A large black animal had seized the Quedak, and he felt heavy jaws close over his back. He tried to fight; but, blinded by a sudden beam of yellow light, he was betrayed by total and enervating confusion.  The yellow light went off. The black beast bit down hard on the Quedak's armored back. The Quedak mustered his remaining strength, and, uncoiling his long, scorpion-jointed tail, lashed out.  He missed, but the black beast released him hastily. They circled each other, the Quedak hoisting his tail for a second blow, the beast unwilling to turn loose this prey.  The Quedak waited for his chance. Elation filled him. This pugnacious animal could be the first, the first on this planet to experience the Quedak mission. From this humble creature a start could be made....  The beast sprang and its white teeth clicked together viciously. The Quedak moved out of the way and its barb-headed tail flashed out, fastening itself in the beast's back. The Quedak held on grimly while the beast leaped and squirmed. Setting his feet, the Quedak concentrated on the all-important task of pumping a tiny white crystal down the length of his tail and under the beast's skin.  But this most important of the Quedak faculties was still dormant. Unable to accomplish anything, the Quedak released his barbs, and, taking careful aim, accurately drove his sting home between the black beast's eyes. The blow, as the Quedak had known, was lethal.  The Quedak took nourishment from the body of its dead foe; regretfully, for by inclination the Quedak was herbivorous. When he had finished, the Quedak knew that he was in desperate need of a long period of rest. Only after that could the full Quedak powers be regained.  He crawled up and down the piles of goods in the yard, looking for a place to hide. Carefully he examined several bales. At last he reached a stack of heavy boxes. One of the boxes had a crack just large enough to admit him.  The Quedak crawled inside, down the shiny, oil-slick surface of a machine, to the far end of the box. There he went into the dreamless, defenseless sleep of the Quedak, serenely trusting in what the future would bring.   PART TWO   I  The big gaff-headed schooner was pointed directly at the reef-enclosed island, moving toward it with the solidity of an express train. The sails billowed under powerful gusts of the northwest breeze, and the rusty Allison-Chambers diesel rumbled beneath a teak grating. The skipper and mate stood on the bridge deck and watched the reef approach.  \"Anything yet?\" the skipper asked. He was a stocky, balding man with a perpetual frown on his face. He had been sailing his schooner among the uncharted shoals and reefs of the Southwest Pacific for twenty-five years. He frowned because his old ship was not insurable. His deck cargo, however, _was_ insured. Some of it had come all the way from Ogdensville, that transshipment center in the desert where spaceships landed.  \"Not a thing,\" the mate said. He was watching the dazzling white wall of coral, looking for the gleam of blue that would reveal the narrow pass to the inner lagoon. This was his first trip to the Solomon Islands. A former television repairman in Sydney before he got the wanderlust, the mate wondered if the skipper had gone crazy and planned a spectacular suicide against the reef.  \"Still nothing!\" he shouted. \"Shoals ahead!\"  \"I'll take it,\" the skipper said to the helmsman. He gripped the wheel and watched the unbroken face of the reef.  \"Nothing,\" the mate said. \"Skipper, we'd better come about.\"  \"Not if we're going to get through the pass,\" the skipper said. He was beginning to get worried. But he had promised to deliver goods to the American treasure-hunters on this island, and the skipper's word was his bond. He had picked up the cargo in Rabaul and made his usual stops at the settlements on New Georgia and Malaita. When he finished here, he could look forward to a thousand-mile run to New Caledonia.  \"There it is!\" the mate shouted.  A thin slit of blue had appeared in the coral wall. They were less than thirty yards from it now, and the old schooner was making close to eight knots.         *       *       *       *       *  As the ship entered the pass, the skipper threw the wheel hard over. The schooner spun on its keel. Coral flashed by on either side, close enough to touch. There was a metallic shriek as an upper main-mast spreader snagged and came free. Then they were in the pass, bucking a six-knot current.  The mate pushed the diesel to full throttle, then sprang back to help the skipper wrestle with the wheel. Under sail and power the schooner forged through the pass, scraped by an outcropping to port, and came onto the placid surface of the lagoon.  The skipper mopped his forehead with a large blue bandanna. \"Very snug work,\" he said.  \"_Snug!_\" the mate cried. He turned away, and the skipper smiled a brief smile.  They slid past a small ketch riding at anchor. The native hands took down sail and the schooner nosed up to a rickety pier that jutted out from the beach. Lines were made fast to palm trees. From the fringe of jungle above the beach a white man came down, walking briskly in the noonday heat.  He was very tall and thin, with knobby knees and elbows. The fierce Melanesian sun had burned out but not tanned him, and his nose and cheekbones were peeling. His horn-rimmed glasses had broken at the hinge and been repaired with a piece of tape. He looked eager, boyish, and curiously naive.  One hell-of-a-looking treasure-hunter, the mate thought.  \"Glad to see you!\" the man called out. \"We'd about given you up for lost.\"  \"Not likely,\" the skipper said. \"Mr. Sorensen, I'd like you to meet my new mate, Mr. Willis.\"  \"Glad to meet you, Professor,\" the mate said.  \"I'm not a professor,\" Sorensen said, \"but thanks anyhow.\"  \"Where are the others?\" the skipper asked.  \"Out in the jungle,\" Sorensen said. \"All except Drake, and he'll be down here shortly. You'll stay a while, won't you?\"  \"Only to unload,\" the skipper said. \"Have to catch the tide out of here. How's the treasure-hunting?\"  \"We've done a lot of digging,\" Sorensen said. \"We still have our hopes.\"  \"But no doubloons yet?\" the skipper asked. \"No pieces of eight?\"  \"Not a damned one,\" Sorensen said wearily. \"Did you bring the newspapers, Skipper?\"  \"That I did,\" Sorensen replied. \"They're in the cabin. Did you hear about that second spaceship going to Mars?\"  \"Heard about it on the short wave,\" Sorensen said. \"It didn't bring back much, did it?\"  \"Practically nothing. Still, just think of it. _Two_ spaceships to Mars, and I hear they're getting ready to put one on Venus.\"  The three men looked around them and grinned.  \"Well,\" the skipper said, \"I guess maybe the space age hasn't reached the Southwest Pacific yet. And it certainly hasn't gotten to _this_ place. Come on, let's unload the cargo.\"         *       *       *       *       *  This place was the island of Vuanu, southernmost of the Solomons, almost in the Louisade Archipelago. It was a fair-sized volcanic island, almost twenty miles long and several wide. Once it had supported half a dozen native villages. But the population had begun to decline after the depredations of the blackbirders in the 1850s. Then a measles epidemic wiped out almost all the rest, and the survivors emigrated to New Georgia. A ship-watcher had been stationed here during the Second World War, but no ships had come this way. The Japanese invasion had poured across New Guinea and the upper Solomons, and further north through Micronesia. At the end of the war Vuanu was still deserted. It was not made into a bird sanctuary like Canton Island, or a cable station like Christmas Island, or a refueling point like Cocos-Keeling. No one even wanted to explode alphabet bombs on it. Vuanu was a worthless, humid, jungle-covered piece of land, free to anyone who wanted it.  William Sorensen, general manager of a chain of liquor stores in California, decided he wanted it.  Sorensen's hobby was treasure-hunting. He had looked for Lafitte's treasure in Louisiana and Texas, and for the Lost Dutchman Mine in Arizona. He had found neither. His luck had been better on the wreck-strewn Gulf coast, and on an expedition to Dagger Cay in the Caribbean he had found a double handful of Spanish coins in a rotting canvas bag. The coins were worth about three thousand dollars. The expedition had cost very much more, but Sorensen felt amply repaid.  For many years he had been interested in the Spanish treasure galleon _Santa Teresa_. Contemporary accounts told how the ship, heavily laden with bullion, sailed from Manila in 1689. The clumsy ship, caught in a storm, had run off to the south and been wrecked. Eighteen survivors managed to get ashore with the treasure. They buried it, and set sail for the Phillipines in the ship's pinnacle. Two of them were alive when the boat reached Manila.  The treasure island was tentatively identified as one of the Solomons. But which one?  No one knew. Treasure-hunters looked for the cache on Bougainville and Buka. There was a rumor about it on Malaita, and even Ontong Java received an expedition. But no treasure was recovered.  Sorensen, researching the problem thoroughly, decided that the _Santa Teresa_ had sailed completely through the Solomons, almost to the Louisades. The ship must have escaped destruction until it crashed into the reef at Vuanu.  His desire to search for the treasure might have remained only a dream if he hadn't met Dan Drake. Drake was also an amateur treasure-hunter. More important, he owned a fifty-five-foot Hanna ketch.  Over an evening's drinks the Vuanu expedition was born.  Additional members were recruited. Drake's ketch was put into seagoing condition, equipment and money saved or gathered. Several other possible treasure sites in the Southwest Pacific were researched. Finally, vacation time"]]]
