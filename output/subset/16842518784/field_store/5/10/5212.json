[[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/51408"],["title","Angel's Egg (#2)"],["body"," I saw Camilla standing near my feet with her neck out and head low, and the angel put a hand on either side of her scraggy comb. Camilla relaxed, clucked in the normal way, and spread her wings for a shelter. The angel went under it, but only to oblige Camilla, I think--at least, she stuck her head through the wing feathers and winked.  She must have seen something else then, for she came out and flew back to me and touched a finger to my cheek, looked at the finger, saw it was wet, put it in her mouth, made a face, and laughed at me.  We went outdoors into the sun (Camilla, too) and the angel gave me an exhibition of what flying ought to be. Not even Wagner can speak of joy as her first free flying did. At one moment she would be hanging in front of my eyes, radiant and delighted; the next instant she would be a dot of color against a cloud. Try to imagine something that would make a hummingbird seem dull and sluggish!  They do hum. Softer than a hummingbird; louder than a dragonfly. Something like the sound of hawk-moths--_Hemaris thisbe_, for instance, the one I used to call Hummingbird Moth when I was a child.  I was frightened, naturally. Frightened first at what might happen to her, but that was unnecessary; I don't think she would be in danger from any savage animal except possibly Man. I saw a Cooper's hawk slant down the invisible toward the swirl of color where she was dancing by herself. Presently she was drawing iridescent rings around him. Then, while he soared in smaller circles, I could not see her, but (maybe she felt my fright) she was again in front of me, pressing my forehead in the now familiar way.  I knew she was amused, and caught the idea that the hawk was a \"lazy character.\" Not quite the way I'd describe _Accipiter Cooperi_, but it's all in the point of view. I believe she had been riding his back, no doubt with her telepathic hands on his predatory head.  Later I was frightened by the thought that she might not want to return to me. Could I compete with sunlight and open sky? The passage of that terror through me brought her swiftly back, and her hands said with great clarity: \"Don't ever be afraid of anything. It isn't necessary for you.\"  Once this afternoon I was saddened by the realization that old Judy can take little part in what goes on now. I can well remember Judy running like the wind. The angel must have heard this thought in me, for she stood a long time beside Judy's drowsy head, while Judy's tail thumped cheerfully on the warm grass....         *       *       *       *       *  In the evening the angel made a heavy meal on two or three cake crumbs and another drop of sherry, and we had what was almost a sustained conversation. I will write it in that form this time, rather than grope for anything more exact.  I asked her: \"How far away is your home?\"  \"My home is here.\"  \"I meant the place your people came from.\"  \"Ten light years.\"  \"The images you showed me--that quiet valley--that is ten light years away?\"  \"Yes. But that was my father talking to you, through me. He was grown when the journey began. He is two hundred and forty years old--our years, thirty-two days longer than each of yours.\"  Mainly I was conscious of a flood of relief. I had feared, on the basis of terrestrial biology that her explosively rapid growth after hatching must foretell a brief life. But it's all right--she can outlive me, and by a few hundred years at that.  \"Your father is here now, on this planet? Shall I see him?\"  She took her hands away--listening, I believe. The answer was: \"No. He is sorry. He is ill and cannot live long. I am to see him in a few days, when I fly a little better. He taught me for twenty years after I was born.\"  \"I don't understand. I thought that--\"  \"Later, friend. My father is grateful for your kindness to me.\"  I don't know what I thought about that. I felt no faintest trace of condescension in the message.  \"And he was showing me things he had seen with his own eyes, ten light years away?\"  \"Yes.\" Then she wanted me to rest a while; I am sure she knows what a huge effort it is for my primitive brain to function in this way. But before she ended the conversation by humming down to her nest she gave me this, and I received it with such clarity that I cannot be mistaken: \"He says that only fifty million years ago it was a jungle there, just as Terra is now.\"         *       *       *       *       *  June 8  When I woke four days ago, the angel was having breakfast, and little Camilla was dead. The angel watched me rub sleep out of my eyes, watched me discover Camilla, and then flew to me.  I received this: \"Does it make you unhappy?\"  \"I don't know exactly.\" You can get fond of a hen, especially a cantankerous and homely old one whose personality has a lot in common with your own.  \"She was old. She wanted a flock of chicks, and I couldn't stay with her. So I--\" something obscure here; probably my mind was trying too hard to grasp it--\"so I saved her life.\" I could make nothing else out of it. She said \"saved.\"  Camilla's death looked natural, except that I should have expected the death contractions to muss the straw and that hadn't happened. Maybe the angel had arranged the old lady's body for decorum, though I don't see how her muscular strength would have been equal to it, Camilla weighed at least seven pounds.  As I was burying her at the edge of the garden and the angel was humming over my head, I recalled a thing which, when it happened, I had dismissed as a dream. Merely a moonlight image of the angel standing in the nest box with her hands on Camilla's head, then pressing her mouth gently on Camilla's throat, just before the hen's head sank down out of my line of vision. Probably I actually awoke and saw it happen. I am somehow unconcerned--even, as I think more about it, pleased.  After the burial the angel's hands said: \"Sit on the grass and we'll talk. Question me; I'll tell you what I can. My father asks you to write it down.\"  So that is what we have been doing for the last four days. I have been going to school, a slow but willing pupil. Rather than enter anything in this journal, for in the evenings I was exhausted, I made notes as best I could. The angel has gone now to see her father and will not return until morning. I shall try to make a readable version of my notes.  Since she had invited questions, I began with something which had been bothering me, as a would-be naturalist, exceedingly. I couldn't see how creatures no larger than the adults I had observed could lay eggs, as large as Camilla's. Nor could I understand why, if they were hatched in an almost adult condition and able to eat a varied diet, she had any use for that ridiculous, lovely and apparently functional pair of breasts.         *       *       *       *       *  When the angel grasped my difficulty, she exploded with laughter--her kind, which buzzed her all over the garden and caused her to fluff my hair on the wing and pinch my earlobe. She lit on a rhubarb leaf and gave a delectably naughty representation of herself as a hen laying an egg, including the cackle. She got me to bumbling helplessly--my kind of laughter--and it was some time before we could quiet down. Then she did her best to explain.  They are true mammals, and the young--not more than two or at most three in a lifetime averaging two hundred and fifty years--are delivered in very much the human way. The baby is nursed, human fashion, until his brain begins to respond a little to their unspoken language. That takes three to four weeks. Then he is placed in an altogether different medium.  She could not describe that clearly, because there was very little in my educational storehouse to help me grasp it. It is some gaseous medium which arrests bodily growth for an almost indefinite period, while mental growth continues. It took them, she says, about seven thousand years to perfect this technique after they first hit on the idea; they are never in a hurry.  The infant remains under this delicate and precise control for anywhere from fifteen to thirty years, the period depending not only on his mental vigor, but also on the type of lifework he tentatively elects as soon as his brain is knowing enough to make a choice. During this period his mind is guided with patience by teachers who--         *       *       *       *       *  It seems those teachers know their business. This was peculiarly difficult for me to assimilate, although the facts came through clearly enough. In their world, the profession of teacher is more highly honored than any other--can such a thing be possible?--and so difficult to enter that only the strongest minds dare to attempt it.  I had to rest a while after absorbing that.  An aspirant must spend fifty years, not including the period of infantile education, merely getting ready to begin, and the acquisition of factual knowledge, while not understressed, takes only a small proportion of those fifty years. Then, if he's good enough, he can take a small part in the elementary instruction of a few babies, and if he does well on that basis for another thirty or forty years, he is considered a fair beginner....  Once upon a time I myself lurched around stuffy classrooms, trying to insert a few predigested facts--I wonder how many of them _were_ facts--into the minds of bored and preoccupied adolescents, some of whom may have liked me moderately well. I was even able to shake hands and be nice while their terribly well-meaning parents explained to me how they ought to be educated. So much of our human effort goes down the drain of futility, I sometimes wonder how we ever got as far as the Bronze Age. Somehow we did, though, and a short way beyond.  After that preliminary stage of an angel's education is finished, the baby is transferred to more ordinary surroundings, and his bodily growth completes itself in a very short time. Wings grow abruptly, as I have seen, and he reaches a maximum"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5141"],["title","What Katy Did at School (#1)"],["body","at one side; there was no green grass either. A gravel path took up the whole of the narrow front yard; and, what with the blazing color of the paint and the wide-awake look of the blindless windows, the house had somehow the air of standing on tip-toe and staring hard at something,--the dust in the road, perhaps; for there seemed to be nothing to stare at.  Elsie's heart sank indescribably, as she and John got very slowly out of the carryall, and Alexander, putting his arm over the fence, rapped loudly at the front door.  It was some minutes before the rap was answered.  Then a heavy step was heard creaking through the hall, and somebody began fumbling at an obstinate bolt, which would not move. Next, a voice which they recognized as Mrs. Worrett's called: \"Isaphiny, Isaphiny, come and see if you can open this door.\"  \"How funny!\"  whispered Johnnie, beginning to giggle.  \"Isaphiny\" seemed to be upstairs; for presently they heard her running down, after which a fresh rattle began at the obstinate bolt.  But still the door did not open, and at length Mrs. Worrett put her lips to the keyhole, and asked,--  \"Who is it?\"  The voice sounded so hollow and ghostly, that Elsie jumped, as she answered: \"It's I, Mrs. Worrett,--Elsie Carr.  And Johnnie's here, too.\"  \"Ts, ts, ts!\" sounded from within, and then came a whispering; after which Mrs. Worrett put her mouth again to the keyhole, and called out: \"Go round to the back, children.  I can't make this door open anyway. It's swelled up with the damp.\"  \"Damp!\" whispered Johnnie; \"why, it hasn't rained since the third week in August; papa said so yesterday.\"  \"That's nothing, Miss Johnnie,\" put in Alexander, overhearing her. \"Folks hereaway don't open their front doors much,--only for weddings and funerals and such like.  Very likely this has stood shut these five years.  I know the last time I drove Miss Carr out, before she died, it was just so; and she had to go round to the back, as you're a-doing now.\"  John's eyes grew wide with wonder; but there was no time to say any thing, for they had turned the corner of the house, and there was Mrs. Worrett waiting at the kitchen door to receive them.  She looked fatter than ever, Elsie thought; but she kissed them both, and said she was real glad to see a Carr in her house at last.  \"It was too bad,\" she went on, \"to keep you waiting so.  But the fact is I got asleep and when you knocked, I waked up all in a daze, and for a minute it didn't come to me who it must be.  Take the bags right upstairs, Isaphiny; and put them in the keeping-room chamber.  How's your pa, Elsie,--and Katy?  Not laid up again, I hope.\"  \"Oh, no; she seems to get better all the time.\"  \"That's right,\" responded Mrs. Worrett, heartily.  \"I didn't know but what, with hot weather, and company in the house, and all,--there's a chicken, Johnnie,\" she exclaimed, suddenly interrupting herself, as a long-legged hen ran past the door.  \"Want to chase it right away? You can, if you like.  Or would you rather go upstairs first?\"  \"Upstairs, please,\" replied John, while Elsie went to the door, and watched Alexander driving away down the dusty road.  She felt as if their last friend had deserted them.  Then she and Johnnie followed Isaphiny upstairs.  Mrs. Worrett never \"mounted\" in hot weather she told them.  The spare chamber was just under the roof.  It was very hot, and smelt as if the windows had never been opened since the house was built.  As soon as they were alone, Elsie ran across the room, and threw up the sash; but the moment she let go, it fell again with a crash which shook the floor and made the pitcher dance and rattle in the wash-bowl.  The children were dreadfully frightened, especially when they heard Mrs. Worrett at the foot of the stairs calling to ask what was the matter.  \"It's only the window,\" explained Elsie, going into the hall.  \"I'm so sorry; but it won't stay open.  Something's the matter with it.\"  \"Did you stick the nail in?\" inquired Mrs. Worrett.  \"The nail?  No, ma'am.\"  \"Why, how on earth did you expect it do stay up then?  You young folks never see what's before your eyes.  Look on the window-sill, and you'll find it.  It's put there a purpose.\"  Elsie returned, much discomfited.  She looked, and, sure enough, there was a big nail, and there was a hole in the side of the window-frame in which to stick it.  This time she got the window open without accident; but a long blue paper shade caused her much embarrassment. It hung down, and kept the air from coming in.  She saw no way of fastening it.  \"Roll it up, and put in a pin,\" suggested John.  \"I'm afraid of tearing the paper.  Dear, what a horrid thing it is!\" Replied Elsie in a disgusted tone.  However, she stuck in a couple of pins and fastened the shade out of the way.  After that, they looked about the room.  It was plainly furnished, but very nice and neat.  The bureau was covered with a white towel, on which stood a pincushion, with \"Remember Ruth\" stuck upon it in pins.  John admired this very much, and felt that she could never make up her mind to spoil the pattern by taking out a pin, however great her need of one might be.  \"What a high bed!\" she exclaimed.  \"Elsie, you'll have to climb on a chair to get into it; and so shall I.\"  Elsie felt of it.  \"Feathers!\" she cried a tone of horror.  \"O John! why did we come?  What shall we do?\"  \"I guess we shan't mind it much,\" replied John, who was perfectly well, and considered these little variations on home habits rather as fun than otherwise.  But Elsie gave a groan.  Two nights on a feather-bed! How should she bear it!  Tea was ready in the kitchen when they went downstairs.  A small fire had been lighted to boil the water.  It was almost out, but the room felt stiflingly warm, and the butter was so nearly melted that Mrs. Worrett had to help it with a tea-spoon.  Buzzing flies hovered above the table, and gathered thick on the plate of cake.  The bread was excellent, and so were the cottage cheeses and the stewed quinces; but Elsie could eat nothing.  She was in a fever of heat.  Mrs. Worrett was distressed at this want of appetite; and so was Mr. Worrett, to whom the children had just been introduced.  He was a kindly-looking old man, with a bald head, who came to supper in his shirt-sleeves, and was a thin as his wife was fat.  \"I'm afraid the little girl don't like her supper, Lucinda,\" he said. \"You must see about getting her something different for to-morrow.\"  \"Oh! it isn't that.  Every thing is very nice, only, I'm not hungry,\" pleaded Elsie, feeling as if she should like to cry.  She did cry a little after tea, as they sat in the dusk; Mr. Worrett smoking his pipe and slapping mosquitoes outside the door, and Mrs. Worrett sleeping rather noisily in a big rocking-chair.  But not even Johnnie found out that she was crying; for Elsie felt that she was the naughtiest child in the world to behave so badly when everybody was so kind to her.  She repeated this to herself many times, but it didn't do much good.  As often as the thought of home and Katy and papa came, a wild longing to get back to them would rush over her, and her eyes would fill again with sudden tears.  The night was very uncomfortable.  Not a breath of wind was stirring, or none found its way to the stifling bed where the little sisters lay.  John slept pretty well, in spite of heat and mosquitoes, but Elsie hardly closed her eyes.  Once she got up and went to the window, but the blue paper shade had become unfastened, and rattled down upon her head with a sudden bump, which startled her very much.  She could find no pins in the dark, so she left it hanging; whereupon it rustled and flapped through the rest of the night, and did its share toward keeping her awake.  About three o'clock she fell into a doze; and it seemed only a minute after that before she waked up to find bright sunshine in the room, and half a dozen roosters crowing and calling under the windows.  Her head ached violently.  She longed to stay in bed, but was afraid it would be thought impolite, so she dressed and went down with Johnnie; but she looked so pale and ate so little breakfast that Mrs. Worrett was quite troubled, and said she had better not try to go out, but just lie on the lounge in the best room, and amuse herself with a book.  The lounge in the best room was covered with slippery purple chintz. It was a high lounge and very narrow.  There was nothing at the end to hold the pillow in its place; so the pillow constantly tumbled off and jerked Elsie's head suddenly backward, which was not at all comfortable.  Worse,--Elsie having dropped into a doze, she herself tumbled to the floor, rolling from the glassy, smooth chintz as if it had been a slope of ice.  This adventure made her so nervous that she dared not go to sleep again, though Johnnie fetched two chairs, and placed them beside the sofa to hold her on.  So she followed Mrs. Worretts advice, and \"amused herself with a book.\"  There were not many books in the best room.  The one Elsie chose was a fat black volume called \"The Complete Works of Mrs. Hannah More.\"  Part of it was prose, and part was poetry.  Elsie began with a chapter called \"Hints on the Formation of the Character of a Youthful Princess.\" But there were a great many long words in it; so she turned to a story named \"Coelebs in Search of a Wife.\"  It was about a young gentleman who wanted to get married, but who didn't feel sure that there were any young ladies nice enough for him; so he went about making visits, first to one and then to another; and, when he had stayed a few days at a house, he would always say, \"No, she won't do,\" and then he would go away.  At last, he found a young lady who seemed the very person, who visited the poor, and got up early in the morning, and always wore white, and never forgot to wind up her watch or do her duty; and Elsie almost thought that now the difficult young gentleman must be satisfied, and say, \"This is"]]]
