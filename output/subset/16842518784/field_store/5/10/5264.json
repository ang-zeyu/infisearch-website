I began to see that this opposability of the two types was one of the great driving forces of the people.  In the evening I was transported to the night club and I was a success. I would not entertain them with blue jokes or blue lyrics, but the patrons seemed fascinated by my simple imitations of all the instruments of the orchestra and my singing of comic ballads that Eustace had taught me in odd moments that day. They were also interested in the way that I drank gin--that is, emptying the bottle without breaking the seal. (It seems that the grub-people are unable to absorb a liquid without making direct contact with it.)  And I met Margaret, one of the \"girl\" singers.  I had been wondering to which type of people I might show affinity. Now I knew. I was definitely a Beta type, for I was attracted to Margaret, who was unmistakably a Gamma. I began to understand the queer effect that these types have on each other.  She came over to my cage.  \"I want to rub your head for good luck before I go on,\" she said.  \"Thank you, Margaret,\" I replied, \"but that is not my head.\"  She sang with incomparable sadness, with all the sorrow and sordidness that appear to be the lot of unfortunate Gammas. It was the essence of melancholy made into music. It was a little bit like the ghost music on the asteroid Artemis, a little like the death chants on Dolmena. Sex and sorrow. Nostalgia. Regret.  Her singing shook me with a yearning that had no precedent.  She came back to my cage.  \"You were wonderful, Margaret,\" I said.  \"I'm always wonderful when I'm singing for my supper. I am less wonderful in the rare times that I am well fed. But are you happy, little buddy?\"  \"I had become almost so, till I heard you sing. Now I am overcome with sorrow and longing. Margaret, I am fascinated with you.\"  \"I go for you too, blob. You're my buddy. Isn't it funny that the only buddy I have in the world is a blob? But if you'd seen some of the guys I've been married to--boy! I wouldn't insult you by calling them blobs. Have to go now. See you tomorrow night--if they keep us both on.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Now there was a problem to face. It was necessary that I establish control over my environment, and at once. How else could I aspire to Margaret?  I knew that the heart of the entire place here was neither the bar nor the entertainment therein, nor the cuisine, nor the dancing. The heart of the enterprise was the Casino. Here was the money that mattered; the rest was but garnish.  I had them bring me into the gambling rooms.  I had expected problems of complexity here with which the patrons worked for their gain or loss. Instead there was an almost amazing simplicity. All the games were based on first aspect numbers only. Indeed, everything on the Planet Florida seemed based on first aspect numbers.  Now it is an elemental fact that first aspect numbers do not carry within them their own prediction. Nor were the people even possessed of the prediction key that lies over the very threshold of the second aspect series.  These people were actually wagering sums--the symbols of prosperity--blindly, not knowing for sure whether they would win or lose. They were selecting numbers by hunch or at random with no assurance of profit. They were choosing a hole for a ball to fall into without knowing whether that was the right hole!  I do not believe that I was ever so amazed at anything in my life.  But here was my opportunity to establish control over my environment.  I began to play the games.  Usually I would watch a round first, to be sure that I understood just what was going on. Then I would play a few times ... as many as it took to break the game.  I broke game after game. When he could no longer pay me, Blackjack closed the Casino in exasperation.  Then we played poker, he and I and several others. This was even more simple. I suddenly realized that the grub-people could see only one side of the cards at a time.  I played and I won.  I owned the Casino now, and all of those people were now working for me. Billy Wilkins also played with us, so that in short order I also owned the Reptile Ranch.  Before the evening was over, I owned a race track, a beach hotel, and a theater in a place named New York.  I had begun to establish control over my environment....         *       *       *       *       *  Later. Now started the golden days. I increased my control and did what I could for my friends.  I got a good doctor for my old friend and roommate, Pete the python, and he began receiving treatment for his indigestion. I got a jazzy sports car for my friend Eustace imported from somewhere called Italy. And I buried Margaret in mink, for she had a fix on the fur of that mysterious animal. She enjoyed draping it about her in the form of coats, capes, cloaks, mantles and stoles, though the weather didn't really require it.  I had now won several banks, a railroad, an airline, and a casino in somewhere named Havana.  \"You're somebody now,\" said Margaret. \"You really ought to dress better. Or are you dressed? I never know. I don't know if part of that is clothes or if all of it is you. But at least I've learned which is your head. I think we should be married in May. It's so common to be married in June. Just imagine me being Mrs. George Albert Leroy Ellery McIntosh! You know, we have become quite an item. And do you know there are three biographies of you out--_Burgeoning Blob_, _The Blob from Way Out_, _The Hidden Hand Behind the Blob--What Does it Portend?_ And the governor has invited us to dine tomorrow. I do wish you would learn to eat. If you weren't so nice, you'd be creepy. I always say there's nothing wrong with marrying a man, or a blob, with money. It shows foresight on the part of a girl. You know you will have to get a blood test? You had better get it tomorrow. You do have blood, don't you?\"  I did, but not, of course, of the color and viscosity of hers. But I could give it that color and viscosity temporarily. And it would react negative in all the tests.  She mused, \"They are all jealous of me. They say they wouldn't marry a blob. They mean they couldn't.... Do you have to carry that tin ball with you all the time?\"  \"Yes. It is my communication sphere. In it I record my thoughts. I would be lost without it.\"  \"Oh, like a diary. How quaint!\"  Yes, those were the golden days. The grubs appeared to me in a new light, for was not Margaret also a grub? Yet she seemed not so unfinished as the rest. Though lacking a natural outer casing, she had not the appearance of crawling out from under a rock. She was quite an attractive \"girl.\" And she cared for me.  What more could I wish? I was affluent. I was respected. I was in control of my environment. And I could aid my friends, of whom I had now acquired an astonishing number.  Moreover, my old space-ineptitude sickness had left me. I never felt better in my life. Ah, golden days, one after the other like a pleasant dream. And soon I am to be married!   IV  There has been a sudden change. As on the Planet Hecube, where full summer turns into the dead of the winter in minutes, to the destruction of many travelers, so was it here. My world is threatened!  It is tottering, all that I have built up. I will fight. I will have the best lawyers on the planet. I am not done. But I am threatened....  Later. This may be the end. The appeal court has given its decision. A blob may not own property in Florida. A blob is not a person.  Of course I am not a person. I never pretended to be. But I am a _personage_! I will yet fight this thing....  Later. I have lost everything. The last appeal is gone. By definition, I am an animal of indeterminate origin, and my property is being completely stripped from me.  I made an eloquent appeal and it moved them greatly. There were tears in their eyes. But there was greed in the set of their mouths. They have a vested interest in stripping me. Each will seize a little.  And I am left a pauper, a vassal, an animal, a slave. This is always the last doom of the marooned, to be a despised alien at the mercy of a strange world.  Yet it should not be hopeless. I will have Margaret. Since my contract with Billy Wilkins and Blackjack Bracken, long since bought up, is no longer in effect, Margaret should be able to handle my affairs as a person. I believe that I have great earning powers yet, and I can win as much as I wish by gambling. We will treat this as only a technicality. We shall acquire new fortune. I will reestablish control over my environment. I will bring back the golden days. A few of my old friends are still loyal to me, Margaret, Pete the python, Eustace....  Later. The world has caved in completely. Margaret has thrown me over.  \"I'm sorry, blobby,\" she said, \"but it just won't work. You're still nice, but without money you are only a blob. How could I marry a blob?\"  \"But we can earn more money! I am talented.\"  \"No, you're box-office poison now. You were a fad, and fads die quickly.\"  \"But, Margaret, I can win as much as I wish by gambling.\"  \"Not a chance, blobby. Nobody will gamble with you any more. You're through, blob. I will miss you, though. There will be a new blue note in my ballads when I sing for my supper, after the mink coats are all gone. 'By now.\"  \"Margaret, do not leave me! What of all our golden days together?\"  But all she said was \"'By now.\"  And she was gone forever.         *       *       *       *       *  I am desolate and my old space-ineptitude has returned. My recovery was an illusion. I am so ill with awkwardness that I can no longer fly. I must walk on the ground like one of the giant grubs. A curse on this planet Florida and all its sister orbs! What a miserable world this is!  How could I have been tricked by a young Gamma type of the walking grub? Let her crawl back under her ancestral rocks with all the rest of her kind.... No, no, "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/51781"],["title","The King of the City (#1)"],["body"," rookie, you got a lot to learn. This guy is bankrolled. I seen the wad when he paid Haug off. So all right, we cut you in. Now, get this....\"  He gave me detailed instructions. When he was finished, I said, \"Don't wait up for me.\"  I took the speaker out of my ear and dropped it into the disposal slot. We drove along quietly for quite a while.  I was beginning to recognize my surroundings. This section of the turnpike had been opened the year before I left home. Except for the lack of traffic and the dark windows along the way it hadn't changed.  I was wondering just what Lefty's next move would be when a pair of powerful beams came on from the left, then pulled onto the highway, speeding up to pace me. I rocketed past before he had made full speed. I heard a loud spang, and glass chips scattered on my shoulder. I twisted and looked. A starred hole showed in the bubble, above the rear seat.         *       *       *       *       *  \"Duck!\" I yelled. Stenn leaned over, put his head down.  The beams were gaining on me. I twisted the rear viewer, hit the I/R switch. A three-ton combat car, stripped, but still mounting twin infinite repeaters. Against that, old 16 was a kiddie car. I held my speed and tried to generate an idea. What I came up with wasn't good, but it was all I had.  A half a mile ahead there should be a level-split, one of those awkward ones that caused more than one pile-up in the first few months the turnpike was open. Maybe my playmates didn't know about it.  They were about to overtake me now. I slowed just a little, and started fading to the right. They followed me, crowding my rear wheel. I heard the spang again, twice, but nothing hit me. I was on the paved shoulder now, and could barely see the faded yellow cross-hatching that warned of the abutment that divided the pavement ahead.  I held the hack in the yellow until the last instant, then veered right and cleared the concrete barrier by a foot, hit the down-curve at a hundred and eighty in a howl of gyros and brakes--and the thunderous impact of the combat car.  Then I was off the pavement, fighting the wheel, slamming through underbrush, then miraculously back on the hard surface and coasting to a stop in the clear.  I took a deep breath and looked back. The burning remains of the car were scattered for a quarter of a mile along the turnpike. That would have been me if I had gauged it wrong.  I looked at the canopy of the hack. Three holes, not a foot apart, right where a passenger's head would be if he were sitting upright. Stenn was unconcernedly brushing glass dust from his jacket.  \"Very neat, Mr. Smith,\" he said. \"Now shall we resume our journey?\"  \"Maybe it's time you leveled with me, Stenn,\" I said.  He raised his eyebrows at me slightly.  \"When Joe Naples' boy Friday pointed the gun at your head you didn't bat an eyelash,\" I said.  \"I believe those were your instructions,\" Stenn said mildly.  \"Pretty good for a simple businessman. I don't see you showing any signs of the shakes now, either, after what some might call a harrowing experience.\"  \"I have every confidence in your handling--\"  \"Nuts, Stenn. Those three holes are pretty well grouped, wouldn't you say? The man that put them there was hitting where he was aiming. And he was aiming for you.\"  \"Why me?\" Stenn looked almost amused.  \"I thought it was a little shakedown crew, out to teach me a lesson,\" I said. \"Until I saw where the shots were going.\"  Stenn looked at me thoughtfully. He reached up and took a micro-speaker from his ear.  \"The twin to the one you rashly disposed of,\" he said. \"Mr. Haug was kind enough to supply it--for a fee. I must tell you that I had a gun in my hand as we approached the South Radial Intermix. Had you accepted the invitation to turn off, I would have halted the car, shot you and gone on alone. Happily, you chose to resist the temptation, for reasons of your own....\" He looked at me inquiringly.  \"Maybe I'm sap enough to take the job seriously,\" I said.  \"That may possibly be true,\" Stenn said.  \"What's your real errand here, Stenn? Frankly, I don't have time to get involved.\"  \"Really? One wonders if you have irons in the fire, Smith. But never mind. I shan't pry. Are we going on?\"  I gave him my stern penetrating look.  \"Yeah,\" I said. \"We're going on.\"         *       *       *       *       *  In twenty minutes, we were on the Inner Concourse and the polyarcs were close together, lighting the empty sweep of banked pavement. The lights of the city sparkled across the sky ahead, and gave me a ghostly touch of the old thrill of coming home.  I doused that feeling fast. After eight years there was nothing left there for me to come home to. The city had a lethal welcome for intruders; it wouldn't be smart to forget that.  I didn't see the T-Bird until his spot hit my eyes and he was beside me, crowding.  I veered and hit the brakes, with a half-baked idea of dropping back and cutting behind him, but he stayed with me. I had a fast impression of squealing metal and rubber, and then I was skidding to a stop up against the deflector rails with the T-Bird slanted across my prow. Its lid popped almost before the screech died away, and I was looking down the muzzles of two power pistols. I kept both hands on the wheel, where they could see them, and sat tight.  I wondered whose friends we had met this time.  Two men climbed out, the pistols in sight, and came up to the hack. The first one was a heavy-set Slavic type zipped into a tight G. I. weather suit. He motioned. I opened up and got out, not making any sudden movements. Stenn followed. A cold wind was whipping along the concourse, blowing a fine misty rain hard against my cheek. The polyarcs cast black shadows on gray faces.  The smaller man moved over to Stenn and crowded him back against the hack. The Slav motioned again, and I moved over by the T-Bird. He fished my wallet out and put it in his pocket without looking at it. I heard the other man say something to Stenn, and then the sound of a blow. I turned my head slowly, so as not to excite my watchdog. Stenn was picking himself up. He started going through his pockets, showing everything to the man with the gun, then dropping it on the ground. The wind blew cards and papers along until they soaked up enough water to stick. Stenn carried a lot of paper.         *       *       *       *       *  The gunny said something and Stenn started pulling off his coat. He turned it inside out, and held it out. The gunny shook his head, and motioned to my Slav. He looked at me, and I tried to read his mind. I moved across toward the hack. I must have guessed right because he didn't shoot me. The Slav pocketed his gun and took the coat. Methodically, he tore the lining out, found nothing, dropped the ripped garment and kicked it aside. I shifted position, and the Slav turned and backhanded me up against the hack.  \"Lay off him, Heavy,\" the other hood said. \"Maxy didn't say nothing about this mug. He's just a Escort.\"  Heavy started to get his gun out again. I had an idea he was thinking about using it. Maybe that's why I did what I did. As his hand dipped into his pocket, I lunged, wrapped an arm around him and yanked out my own artillery. I held onto a handful of the weather suit and dug the pistol in hard. He stood frozen. Heavy wasn't as dumb as he looked.  His partner had backed a step, the pistol in his hand covering all of us.  \"Drop it, Slim,\" I said. \"No hard feelings, and we'll be on our way.\"  Stenn stood absolutely motionless. He was still wearing his mild expression.  \"Not a chance, mug,\" the gunny said softly. No one moved.  \"Even if you're ready to gun your way through your pal, I can't miss. Better settle for a draw.\"  \"Maxy don't like draws, mister.\"  \"Stenn,\" I said. \"Get in the T-Bird. Head back the way we came, and don't slow down to read any billboards.\"  Stenn didn't move.         *       *       *       *       *  \"Get going,\" I said. \"Slim won't shoot.\"  \"I employed you,\" Stenn said, \"to take care of the heroics.\"  \"If you've got any better ideas it's time to speak up, Stenn. This is your only out, the way I see it.\"  Stenn looked at the man with the gun.  \"You referred to someone named 'Maxy.' Would that by any chance be Mr. Max Arena?\"  Slim looked at him and thought about it.  \"Could be,\" he said.  Stenn came slowly over to the Slav. Standing well out of the line of fire, he carefully put a hand in the loose pocket of the weather suit and brought out the pistol. I saw Slim's eyes tighten. He was having to make some tough decisions in a hurry.  Stenn moved offside, pistol in hand.  \"Move away from him, Smith,\" he said.  I didn't know what he had in mind, but it didn't seem like the time to argue. I moved back.  \"Drop your gun,\" he said.  I risked a glance at his mild expression.  \"Are you nuts?\"  \"I came here to see Mr. Arena,\" he said. \"This seems an excellent opportunity.\"  \"Does it? I--\"  \"Drop it now, Smith. I won't warn you again.\"  I dropped it.  Slim swiveled on Stenn. He was still in an awkward spot.  \"I want you to take me to Mr. Arena,\" Stenn said. \"I have a proposition to put before him.\" He lowered the gun and handed it to Heavy.  It seemed like a long time until Slim lowered his gun.  \"Heavy, put him in the back seat.\" He motioned me ahead, watched me as he climbed in the T-Bird.  \"Nice friends you got, mug,\" he said. The T-Bird started up, backed, and roared off toward the city. I stood under the polyarcs and watched the tail glare out of sight.  Max Arena was the man I had come to the city to find.   III  Old number 16 was canted against the deflector rail, one side shredded into curled strips of crumpled metal. I looked closer. Under the flimsy fairings, gray armor showed. Maybe there was more to Haug's best hack than met the eye. I climbed in and kicked over the starter. The turbos sounded as good as ever. I eased the gyros in; she backed off the rail with a screech of ripped metal.  I had lost my customer,"]]]
