Or even further back than that? Did it go back, say, twenty-four years, to the time when he was sixteen and had killed his stepfather? He could still see Karl Brodek lying there with his head crushed, could still feel the terror rising in him at what he had done....  Then he had turned and fled the small community on Fairhurst--one of the Clytemnestra planets--and made for the capital, where he shipped out on one of the small tramp freighters that voyaged among the planets of that system. None of the four other planets was human-inhabitable, but two had mining stations, and one had a native civilization advanced enough to make trading practicable, though not very profitable.         *       *       *       *       *  For the next four years, he drifted from one tenth-rate ship to another, one ill-paid job to another. In all this time, he never left the Clytemnestra System. As soon as he was satisfied that his former neighbors were not going to set the law on his trail, he had no desire to go away. It wasn't place-liking that kept him; it was dread of the Jump.  Most spacemen never do quite get over their dread of the hyperspace Jump, but with Len the dread amounted almost to a mania. He was ashamed of the feeling, especially since he suspected he'd picked up that extra dollop of terror from the creatures on the native planet.  Self-respecting colonials didn't associate with non-humans, but during those first years of fear that his fellow men were hunting him, he'd felt safe only with the flluska. He learned a little of their language, and he spent such spare time as he had on Liman, their planet. He couldn't breathe the atmosphere, but there were the trading domes; nobody minded if he used them when there was no trade going on.  The flluska were a religious people, with gods and demons similar to those of the terrestrial cosmogonies. Only, while their gods lived conventionally in the sky, their demons lived in hyperspace. Len was too unsophisticated himself to wonder how so primitive a people could have evolved such a concept as hyperspace in their theology. He merely grew to share their terror of it.  The year Len was twenty, the _Perseus_, one of the star freighters that made the long haul from Castor to Capella, found itself in Fairhurst Station short one deckhand. The man they'd shipped out with was in jail, waiting to see whether a manslaughter or assault charge was going to be lodged against him. The ship could not afford to wait. The station was scoured for a replacement and Len Mattern was the best man they could find.  Normally the starships did not take on untrained hands. Even the lowliest crewman was supposed to have spent a minimum number of years at the space schools, because in theory, all promotions came from the ranks, even in the merchant service. But in spite of his lack of training, they offered him the job. The bigline ships never liked to sail shorthanded; in case of trouble, that could be a basis for legal action.         *       *       *       *       *  Len knew the opportunity offered him was a dazzling one--not only far more money than he'd ever seen before, but the chance of breaking out of the system. He was afraid though, terribly afraid. \"I've never made the Jump,\" he told the second officer in a quavering voice.  \"You'll never be a real spaceman until you do.\" The second officer was patient, because he knew Mattern was his only chance of making the crew up to its full complement.  \"I've heard tell that--things change their shapes in Hyperspace.\"  \"Maybe they do; maybe it's their real shapes you see out there. Who's to tell what the truth is?\"  Len licked dry lips and tried again. \"They say there're people--beings, anyway--_living_ in hyperspace.\" That tale he had heard from spacemen who had made the Jump. Even if he'd believed in the flluska's demons, he would have had the good sense not to admit such a thing to a starship officer--a man of sophistication from the Near Planets, perhaps even Earth herself. Still, spacemen were notorious myth-spinners. Perhaps he had made a fool of himself, anyway.  But the second officer wasn't laughing. \"Federation law says we should have nothing to do with the creatures of hyperspace. If we leave them alone, they don't bother us.\"  It would have been better if the officer had laughed at him and said there was nothing in hyperspace but space. \"Will we see them?\"  \"Does a ship going through ordinary space see any of us?\" the officer returned. \"The creatures of hyperspace live on their own planets, and we give those planets a wide berth. Simple as that.\" He added, \"What are you so afraid of, boy? Not a ship's been lost in hyperspace for over two centuries, and there haven't been any blowups for years.\"  \"Blowups?\" Len repeated.  \"Accidents. A technical term. You've taken worse risks shipping out in those tincan tramps.\"  Finally, Len gave in--to his own common sense more than to the officer's--and signed up for the voyage. He filled out the necessary forms--hundreds of them, it seemed like. When it came to each line for next of kin, he left a blank on every one.  \"Haven't you any relatives at all?\" the second officer asked, surprised.  \"Not a one.\" Len didn't bother to mention that half-brother back on Fairhurst; a five-year-old kid isn't much kin to speak of. Besides, the boy probably didn't even know he had a brother--he'd been less than a year old when Len left. One of the barren women must have adopted him and brought him up as her own.         *       *       *       *       *  So Len Mattern filled out all the papers and was inscribed on the ship's rolls. And he made the terrible jump through hyperspace for the first time.  People who traveled on spaceships only as passengers never could understand why the Jump was invariably referred to as \"terrible.\" That was because before the ship made the Jump they'd be given drugs, in their cocktails, in their food at dinner, or in their drinking water--and the next day they'd wake up and find they had slept right through the whole thing, so it couldn't be so awful. Of course those who traveled around the universe a lot were bound to catch on. Someday they'd miss a meal or not drink anything and they'd find themselves awake while the ship was Jumping. But the shipping lines didn't take any chances and the aberrant passengers would also find themselves locked in their cabins with smooth metal shutters where the mirrors used to be.  But one thing that couldn't be helped: They couldn't be stopped from looking down at themselves and seeing extra arms and legs; or finding no arms and legs at all, but tentacles instead; or that their skin had turned into shining scales or that there was an extra eye in the back of their head. And when the time came for another Jump, they would _ask_ to be drugged.  However, crewmen couldn't be drugged. They had to be awake to tend the ship. The credo of the Space Service was that you couldn't trust a machine to itself any more than you could trust an extraterrestrial, a non-human. If a man wasn't in charge, ultimately everything would go to pot. That was part of the space tradition, like the primitive axes that hung on the bulkheads, so a man could smash his way to the modern fire-fighting equipment. Except, of course, that if fire really broke out, it would be quicker to press the button that sent the automatic fire-fighting machines into immediate action. But still the axes hung there, because they had always hung there--and, like all the metal on the ship, they had to be kept polished.  Each time a ship made the Jump, the crewmen stayed awake. They saw space and time change before their eyes. They saw their own fellows turn into monsters. It was an awful thing to see, even though they knew it wasn't actually a change, but a shift to another aspect of themselves. Worse than the seeing was the _feeling_. It was like being turned inside out, organ by organ--your heart and your liver and your guts and all the rest, each carefully turned inside out, the way a woman takes off her gloves, smoothing each one with great precision. The hellish part was that it didn't hurt. A man felt as if he were being twisted and wrenched apart, and it didn't hurt, and it was the wrongness of that more than anything else that--well, that was why the pay was so high on the starships. So many of them went mad.         *       *       *       *       *  All this Len Mattern had heard of and had expected--though no amount of expectation could have braced him for that kind of reality. But there was more to it than he had heard, and it was the extra part that the second officer seemed curiously anxious to deny. \"You saw nobody--nothing at the portholes,\" he told Mattern after that first Jump. \"You just imagined it.\"  Mattern had been a spaceman long enough to be able to distinguish imagination from reality. Perhaps the creatures of hyperspace did live on planets, but it seemed they did not breathe the atmosphere of those planets as human beings breathe air, and so they were not confined to them. They could move around freely in the starless dusk of their universe. And, if there was a pact, then they must be intelligent creatures--though he would have known that anyway, for they spoke to him. He could hear them through the tight walls of the ship--less in his ears than his mind--cajoling, entreating, _promising_. And he shut his ears and his mind, because he was afraid.  At the end of the voyage, he was offered a permanent berth on the _Perseus_. \"We don't usually take crewmen from the Far Planets,\" the second"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/51845"],["title","Wolfbane (#1)"],["body"," flung herself into his arms.  A new dominance cycle was begun at the moment he returned her frantic kisses.  Glenn knew, and Gala knew, that he had over her an edge, an advantage--the weather gauge, initiative of fire, percentage, the can't-lose lack of tension. Call it anything, but it was life itself to such as Glenn Tropile. He knew, and she knew, that having the advantage he would press it and she would yield--on and on, in a rising spiral.  He did it because it was his life, the attaining of an advantage over anyone he might encounter; because he was (unwelcomely but justly) called a Son of the Wolf.         *       *       *       *       *  A world away, a Pyramid squatted sullenly on the planed-off top of the highest peak of the Himalayas.  It had not been built there. It had not been carried there by Man or Man's machines. It had--come, in its own time; for its own reasons.  Did it wake on that day, the thing atop Mount Everest, or did it ever sleep? Nobody knew. It stood, or sat, there, approximately a tetrahedron. Its appearance was known: constructed on a base line of some thirty-five yards, slaggy, midnight-blue in color. Almost nothing else about it was known--at least, to mankind.  It was the only one of its kind on Earth, though men thought (without much sure knowledge) that there were more, perhaps many thousands more, like it on the unfamiliar planet that was Earth's binary, swinging around the miniature Sun that hung at their common center of gravity like an unbalanced dumbbell. But men knew very little about that planet itself, only that it had come out of space and was now there.  Time was when men had tried to label that binary, more than two centuries before, when it had first appeared. \"Runaway Planet.\" \"The Invader.\" \"Rejoice in Messias, the Day Is at Hand.\" The labels were sense-free; they were Xs in an equation, signifying only that there was _something_ there which was unknown.  \"The Runaway Planet\" stopped running when it closed on Earth.  \"The Invader\" didn't invade; it merely sent down one slaggy, midnight-blue tetrahedron to Everest.  And \"Rejoice in Messias\" stole Earth from its sun--with Earth's old moon, which it converted into a miniature sun of its own.  That was the time when men were plentiful and strong--or thought they were--with many huge cities and countless powerful machines. It didn't matter. The new binary planet showed no interest in the cities or the machines.  There was a plague of things like Eyes--dust-devils without dust, motionless air that suddenly tensed and quivered into lenticular shapes. They came with the planet and the Pyramid, so that there probably was some connection. But there was nothing to do about the Eyes. Striking at them was like striking at air--was the same thing, in fact.  While the men and machines tried uselessly to do something about it, the new binary system--the stranger planet and Earth--began to move, accelerating very slowly.  But accelerating.  In a week, astronomers knew something was happening. In a month, the Moon sprang into flame and became a new sun--beginning to be needed, for already the parent Sol was visibly more distant, and in a few years it was only one other star among many.         *       *       *       *       *  When the little sun was burned to a clinker, they--whoever \"they\" were, for men saw only the one Pyramid--would hang a new one in the sky. It happened every five clock-years, more or less. It was the same old moon-turned-sun, but it burned out, and the fires needed to be rekindled.  The first of these suns had looked down on an Earthly population of ten billion. As the sequence of suns waxed and waned, there were changes, climatic fluctuation, all but immeasurable differences in the quantity and kind of radiation from the new source.  The changes were such that the forty-fifth such sun looked down on a shrinking human race that could not muster up a hundred million.  A frustrated man drives inward; it is the same with a race. The hundred million that clung to existence were not the same as the bold, vital ten billion.  The thing on Everest had, in its time, received many labels, too: The Devil, The Friend, The Beast, A Pseudo-living Entity of Quite Unknown Electrochemical Properties.  All these labels were also Xs.  If it did wake that morning, it did not open its eyes, for it had no eyes--apart from the quivers of air that might or might not belong to it. Eyes might have been gouged; therefore it had none. So an illogical person might have argued--and yet it was tempting to apply the \"purpose, not function\" fallacy to it. Limbs could be crushed; it had no limbs. Ears could be deafened; it had none. Through a mouth, it might be poisoned; it had no mouth. Intentions and actions could be frustrated; apparently it had neither.  It was there. That was all.  It and others like it had stolen the Earth and the Earth did not know why. It was there. And the one thing on Earth you could not do was hurt it, influence it, or coerce it in any way whatever.  It was there--and it, or the masters it represented, owned the Earth by right of theft. Utterly. Beyond human hope of challenge or redress.   II  Citizen and Citizeness Roget Germyn walked down Pine Street in the chill and dusk of--one hoped--a Sun Re-creation Morning.  It was the convention to pretend that this was a morning like any other morning. It was not proper either to cast frequent hopeful glances at the sky, nor yet to seem disturbed or afraid because this was, after all, the forty-first such morning since those whose specialty was Sky Viewing had come to believe the Re-creation of the Sun was near.  The Citizen and his Citizeness exchanged the assurance-of-identity sign with a few old friends and stopped to converse. This also was a convention of skill divorced from purpose. The conversation was without relevance to anything that any one of the participants might know, or think, or wish to ask.  Germyn said for his friends a twenty-word poem he had made in honor of the occasion and heard their responses. They did line-capping for a while--until somebody indicated unhappiness and a wish to change by frowning the Two Grooves between his brows. The game was deftly ended with an improvised rhymed exchange.  Casually, Citizen Germyn glanced aloft. The sky-change had not begun yet; the dying old Sun hung just over the horizon, east and south, much more south than east. It was an ugly thought, but suppose, thought Germyn, just _suppose_ that the Sun were not re-created today? Or tomorrow. Or--  Or ever.  The Citizen got a grip on himself and told his wife: \"We shall dine at the oatmeal stall.\"  The Citizeness did not immediately reply. When Germyn glanced at her with well-masked surprise, he found her almost staring down the dim street at a Citizen who moved almost in a stride, almost swinging his arms. Scarcely graceful.  \"That might be more Wolf than man,\" she said doubtfully.  Germyn knew the fellow. Tropile was his name. One of those curious few who made their homes outside of Wheeling, though they were not farmers. Germyn had had banking dealings with him--or would have had, if it had been up to Tropile.  \"That is a careless man,\" he decided, \"and an ill-bred one.\"  They moved toward the oatmeal stall with the gait of Citizens, arms limp, feet scarcely lifted, slumped forward a little. It was the ancient gait of fifteen hundred calories per day, not one of which could be squandered.         *       *       *       *       *  There was a need for more calories. So many for walking, so many for gathering food. So many for the economical pleasures of the Citizens, so many more--oh, many more, these days!--to keep out the cold. Yet there were no more calories; the diet the whole world lived on was a bare subsistence diet.  It was impossible to farm well when half the world's land was part of the time drowned in the rising sea, part of the time smothered in falling snow.  Citizens knew this and, knowing, did not struggle--it was ungraceful to struggle, particularly when one could not win. Only--well, Wolves struggled, wasting calories, lacking grace.  Citizen Germyn turned his mind to more pleasant things.  He allowed himself his First Foretaste of the oatmeal. It would be warm in the bowl, hot in the throat, a comfort in the belly. There was a great deal of pleasure there, in weather like this, when the cold plucked through the loosened seams and the wind came up the sides of the hills. Not that there wasn't pleasure in the cold itself, for that matter. It was proper that one should be cold now, just before the re-creation of the Sun, when the old Sun was smoky-red and the new one not yet kindled.  \"--still looks like Wolf to me,\" his wife was muttering.  \"Cadence,\" Germyn reproved his Citizeness, but took the sting out of it with a Quirked Smile.  The man with the ugly manners was standing at the very bar of the oatmeal stall where they were heading. In the gloom of mid-morning, he was all angles and strained lines. His head was turned awkwardly on his shoulder, peering toward the back of the stall where the vendor was rhythmically measuring grain into a pot. His hands were resting helter-skelter on the counter, not hanging by his sides.  Citizen Germyn felt a faint shudder from his wife. But he did not reprove her again, for who could blame her? The exhibition was revolting.  She said faintly: \"Citizen, might we dine on bread this morning?\"  He hesitated and glanced again at the ugly man. He said indulgently, knowing that he was indulgent: \"On Sun Re-creation Morning, the Citizeness may dine on bread.\" Bearing in mind the occasion, it was only a small favor and therefore a very proper one.  The bread was good, very good. They shared out the half-kilo between them and ate it in silence, as it deserved. Germyn finished his first portion and, in the prescribed pause before beginning his second, elected to refresh his eyes upward.  He nodded to his wife and "]]]
