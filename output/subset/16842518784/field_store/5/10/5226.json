My groupmaster and socializer are on vacation duty in the Adirondacks. My Queen Mother is busy replacing Girls Next Door.\"  \"Yes, it all fits,\" Potshelter proclaimed excitedly. \"Don't you see, Krumbine? Except for a set of mischances that would only occur once in a billion billion times, the letter would never have been conceived or sent.\"  \"You may have something there,\" Krumbine concurred. \"But in any case, boy, why did you--er--written this letter to this particular girl? What is there about Jane Dough that made you do it?\"  \"Well, you see, sir, she's--\"         *       *       *       *       *  Just then, the door re-dilated and a blue matron machine conducted a young woman into the office. She was slim and she had a head of hair that would have graced a museum beauty, while across the back and--well, \"chest\" is an inadequate word--of her paper chemise, \"JANE DOUGH\" was silk-screened in the palest pink.  Krumbine did not repeat his last question. He had to admit to himself that it had been answered fully. Potshelter whistled respectfully. The blue detective engines gave hard-boiled grunts. Even the blue matron machine seemed awed by the girl's beauty.  But she had eyes only for Richard Rowe. \"My Grand Central man,\" she breathed in amazement. \"The man I've dreamed of ever since. My man with hair.\" She noticed the way he was looking at her and she breathed harder. \"Oh, darling, what have you done?\"  \"I tried to send you a letter.\"  \"A letter? For me? Oh, darling!\"         *       *       *       *       *  Krumbine cleared his throat. \"Potshelter, I'm going to wind this up fast. Miss Dough, could you transfer to this young man's hive?\"  \"Oh, yes, sir! Mine has an over-plus of Girls Next Door.\"  \"Good. Mr. Rowe, there's a sky-pilot two levels up--look for the usual white collar just below the photocells. Marry this girl and take her home to your hive. If your Queen Mother objects refer her to--er--Potshelter here.\"  He cut short the young people's thanks. \"Just one thing,\" he said, wagging a finger at Rowe. \"Don't written any more letters.\"  \"Why ever would I?\" Richard answered. \"Already my action is beginning to seem like a mad dream.\"  \"Not to me, dear,\" Jane corrected him. \"Oh, sir, could I have the letter he sent me? Not to do anything with. Not to show anyone. Just to keep.\"  \"Well, I don't know--\" Krumbine began.  \"Oh, _please_, sir!\"  \"Well, I don't know why not, I was going to say. Here you are, miss. Just see that this husband of yours never writtens another.\"  He turned back as the contracting door shut the young couple from view.  \"You were right, Potshelter,\" he said briskly. \"It was one of those combinations of mischances that come up only once in a billion billion times. But we're going to have to issue recommendations for new procedures and safeguards that will reduce the possibilities to one in a trillion trillion. It will undoubtedly up the Terran income tax a healthy percentage, but we can't have something like this happening again. Every boy must marry the Girl Next Door! And the first-class mails must not be interfered with! The advertising must go through!\"  \"I'd almost like to see it happen again,\" Potshelter murmured dreamily, \"if there were another Jane Dough in it.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Outside, Richard and Jane had halted to allow a small cortege of machines to pass. First came a squad of police machines with Black Sorter in their midst, unmuzzled and docile enough, though still gnashing his teeth softly. Then--stretched out horizontally and borne on the shoulders of Gray Psychiatrist, Black Coroner, White Nursemaid Seven and Greasy Joe--there passed the slim form of Pink Wastebasket, snow-white in death. The machines were keening softly, mournfully.  Round about the black pillars, little mecho-mops were scurrying like mice, cleaning up the last of the first-class-mail bits of confetti.  Richard winced at this evidence of his aberration, but Jane squeezed his hand comfortingly, which produced in him a truly amazing sensation that changed his whole appearance.  \"I know how you feel, darling,\" she told him. \"But don't worry about it. Just think, dear, I'll always be able to tell your friends' wives something no other woman in the world can boast of: that my husband once wrote me a letter!\""]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/51531"],["title","With These Hands (#1)"],["body","st--even an artist who could carpenter as well as he did himself.  Labuerre had made Halvorsen learn carpentry, and Labuerre had been right. You build a scaffold so you can sculp up high, not so it will collapse and you break a leg. You build your platforms so they hold the rock steady, not so it wobbles and chatters at every blow of the chisel. You build your armatures so they hold the plasticine you slam onto them.  But the help-wanted ads wanted no builders of scaffolds, platforms and armatures. The factories were calling for setup men and maintenance men for the production and assembly machines.  From upstate, General Vegetables had sent a recruiting team for farm help--harvest setup and maintenance men, a few openings for experienced operators of tank-caulking machinery. Under \"office and professional\" the demand was heavy for computer men, for girls who could run the I.B.M. Letteriter, esp. familiar sales and collections corresp., for office machinery maintenance and repair men. A job printing house wanted an esthetikon operator for letterhead layouts and the like. A.T. & T. wanted trainees to earn while learning telephone maintenance. A direct-mail advertising outfit wanted an artist--no, they wanted a sales-executive who could scrawl picture-ideas that would be subjected to the criticism and correction of the esthetikon.  Halvorsen leafed tiredly through the rest of the paper. He knew he wouldn't get a job, and if he did he wouldn't hold it. He knew it was a terrible thing to admit to yourself that you might starve to death because you were bored by anything except art, but he admitted it.  It had happened often enough in the past--artists undergoing preposterous hardships, not, as people thought, because they were devoted to art, but because nothing else was interesting. If there were only some impressive, sonorous word that summed up the aching, oppressive futility that overcame him when he tried to get out of art--only there wasn't.  He thought he could tell which of the photos in the tabloid had been corrected by the esthetikon.  There was a shot of Jink Bitsy, who was to star in a remake of _Peter Pan_. Her ears had been made to look not pointed but pointy, her upper lip had been lengthened a trifle, her nose had been pugged a little and tilted quite a lot, her freckles were cuter than cute, her brows were innocently arched, and her lower lip and eyes were nothing less than pornography.  There was a shot, apparently uncorrected, of the last Venus ship coming in at La Guardia and the average-looking explorers grinning. Caption: \"Austin Malone and crew smile relief on safe arrival. Malone says Venus colonies need men, machines. See story p. 2.\"  Petulantly, Halvorsen threw the paper under the table and walked out. What had space travel to do with him? Vacations on the Moon and expeditions to Venus and Mars were part of the deadly encroachment on his livelihood and no more.   II  He took the subway to Passaic and walked down a long-still traffic beltway to his studio, almost the only building alive in the slums near the rusting railroad freightyard.  A sign that had once said \"F. Labuerre, Sculptor--Portraits and Architectural Commissions\" now said \"Roald Halvorsen; Art Classes--Reasonable Fees.\" It was a grimy two-story frame building with a shopfront in which were mounted some of his students' charcoal figure studies and oil still-lifes. He lived upstairs, taught downstairs front, and did his own work downstairs, back behind dirty, ceiling-high drapes.  Going in, he noticed that he had forgotten to lock the door again. He slammed it bitterly. At the noise, somebody called from behind the drapes: \"Who's that?\"  \"Halvorsen!\" he yelled in a sudden fury. \"I live here. I own this place. Come out of there! What do you want?\"  There was a fumbling at the drapes and a girl stepped between them, shrinking from their dirt.  \"Your door was open,\" she said firmly, \"and it's a shop. I've just been here a couple of minutes. I came to ask about classes, but I don't think I'm interested if you're this bad-tempered.\"  A pupil. Pupils were never to be abused, especially not now.  \"I'm terribly sorry,\" he said. \"I had a trying day in the city.\" Now turn it on. \"I wouldn't tell everybody a terrible secret like this, but I've lost a commission. You understand? I thought so. Anybody who'd traipse out here to my dingy abode would be _simpatica_. Won't you sit down? No, not there--humor an artist and sit over there. The warm background of that still-life brings out your color--quite good color. Have you ever been painted? You've a very interesting face, you know. Some day I'd like to--but you mentioned classes.  \"We have figure classes, male and female models alternating, on Tuesday nights. For that I have to be very stern and ask you to sign up for an entire course of twelve lessons at sixty dollars. It's the models' fees--they're exorbitant. Saturday afternoons we have still-life classes for beginners in oils. That's only two dollars a class, but you might sign up for a series of six and pay ten dollars in advance, which saves you two whole dollars. I also give private instructions to a few talented amateurs.\"  The price was open on that one--whatever the traffic would bear. It had been a year since he'd had a private pupil and she'd taken only six lessons at five dollars an hour.  \"The still-life sounds interesting,\" said the girl, holding her head self-consciously the way they all did when he gave them the patter. It was a good head, carried well up. The muscles clung close, not yet slacked into geotropic loops and lumps. The line of youth is heliotropic, he confusedly thought. \"I saw some interesting things back there. Was that your own work?\"  She rose, obviously with the expectation of being taken into the studio. Her body was one of those long-lined, small-breasted, coltish jobs that the pre-Raphaelites loved to draw.  \"Well--\" said Halvorsen. A deliberate show of reluctance and then a bright smile of confidence. \"_You'll_ understand,\" he said positively and drew aside the curtains.  \"What a curious place!\" She wandered about, inspecting the drums of plaster, clay and plasticene, the racks of tools, the stands, the stones, the chisels, the forge, the kiln, the lumber, the glaze bench.  \"I _like_ this,\" she said determinedly, picking up a figure a half-meter tall, a Venus he had cast in bronze while studying under Labuerre some years ago. \"How much is it?\"  An honest answer would scare her off, and there was no chance in the world that she'd buy. \"I hardly ever put my things up for sale,\" he told her lightly. \"That was just a little study. I do work on commission only nowadays.\"  Her eyes flicked about the dingy room, seeming to take in its scaling plaster and warped floor and see through the wall to the abandoned slum in which it was set. There was amusement in her glance.  _I am not being honest, she thinks. She thinks that is funny. Very well, I will be honest._ \"Six hundred dollars,\" he said flatly.         *       *       *       *       *  The girl set the figurine on its stand with a rap and said, half angry and half amused: \"I don't understand it. That's more than a month's pay for me. I could get an S.P.G. statuette just as pretty as this for ten dollars. Who do you artists think you are, anyway?\"  Halvorsen debated with himself about what he could say in reply:  _An S.P.G. operator spends a week learning his skill and I spend a lifetime learning mine._  _An S.P.G. operator makes a mechanical copy of a human form distorted by formulae mechanically arrived at from psychotests of population samples. I take full responsibility for my work; it is mine, though I use what I see fit from Egypt, Greece, Rome, the Middle Ages, the Renaissance, the Augustan and Romantic and Modern Eras._  _An S.P.G. operator works in soft, homogeneous plastic; I work in bronze that is more complicated than you dream, that is cast and acid-dipped today so it will slowly take on rich and subtle coloring many years from today._  _An S.P.G. operator could not make an Orpheus Fountain_--  He mumbled, \"Orpheus,\" and keeled over.         *       *       *       *       *  Halvorsen awoke in his bed on the second floor of the building. His fingers and toes buzzed electrically and he felt very clear-headed. The girl and a man, unmistakably a doctor, were watching him.  \"You don't seem to belong to any Medical Plans, Halvorsen,\" the doctor said irritably. \"There weren't any cards on you at all. No Red, no Blue, no Green, no Brown.\"  \"I used to be on the Green Plan, but I let it lapse,\" the artist said defensively.  \"And look what happened!\"  \"Stop nagging him!\" the girl said. \"I'll pay you your fee.\"  \"It's supposed to come through a Plan,\" the doctor fretted.  \"We won't tell anybody,\" the girl promised. \"Here's five dollars. Just stop nagging him.\"  \"Malnutrition,\" said the doctor. \"Normally I'd send him to a hospital, but I don't see how I could manage it. He isn't on any Plan at all. Look, I'll take the money and leave some vitamins. That's what he needs--vitamins. And food.\"  \"I'll see that he eats,\" the girl said, and the doctor left.  \"How long since you've had anything?\" she asked Halvorsen.  \"I had some coffee today,\" he answered, thinking back. \"I'd been working on detail drawings for a commission and it fell through. I told you that. It was a shock.\"  \"I'm Lucretia Grumman,\" she said, and went out.  He dozed until she came back with an armful of groceries.  \"It's hard to get around down here,\" she complained.  \"It was Labuerre's studio,\" he told her defiantly. \"He left it to me when he died. Things weren't so rundown in his time. I studied under him; he was one of the last. He had a joke--'They don't really want my stuff, but they're ashamed to let me starve.' He warned me that they wouldn't be ashamed to let _me_ starve, but I insisted and he took me in.\"  Halvorsen drank some milk and ate some bread. He thought of the change"]]]
