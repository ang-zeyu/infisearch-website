Doors were opened all along the corridor; light steps passed Priscilla’s room. She heard the rustle of silk and the sweet, high tinkle of girlish laughter.  She stayed in her room till the last footsteps had died away, then in desperation made a rush for it, flew down the wide stairs in a bashful agony, and, as a matter of course, entered the spacious dining-hall by the door devoted to the dons.  A girl’s life at one of the women’s colleges is supposed to be more or less an unfettered sort of existence. The broad rules guiding conduct are few and little more than those which must be exercised in any well-organized family. But there is the unspoken etiquette made chiefly by the students themselves, which fills the place like an atmosphere, and which can only be transgressed at the risk of surly glances and muttered comments and even words of derision.  No student was expected to enter the hall by the dons’ entrance, and for this enormity to be perpetrated by a fresher immediately made her the cynosure of all eyes. Poor Priscilla was unconscious of any offense. She grew scarlet under the gaze of the merciless young eyes and further added to her sins by sitting down at one of the tables at the top of the hall.  No one reproved her in words or requested her to take a lower seat, but some rude giggles were not inaudible; and Priscilla, who would thankfully have taken her dinner in the scullery, heard hints about a certain young person’s presumption, and about the cheek of those wretched freshers, which must instantly be put down with a high hand.  Priscilla had choked over her soup, and was making poor way with the fish that followed, when suddenly a sweet, low voice addressed her.  “This is your first evening at St. Benet’s,” said the voice. “I hope you will be happy. I know you will, after a little.”  Priscilla turned and met the full gaze of lovely eyes, brown like a nut, soft and deep as the thick pile of velvet, and yet with a latent flash and glow in them which gave them a red, half-wild gleam now and then. The lips that belonged to this face were slightly parted in a smile; the smile and the expression in the eyes stole straight down with a glow of delicious comfort into Priscilla’s heart.  “Thank you,” she said in her stiff, wooden tone; but her eyes did not look stiff, and the girl began to talk again.  “I believe my room is next to yours. My name is Oliphant— Margaret Oliphant, but every one calls me Maggie. That is, of course, I mean my friends do. Would you like to come into my room and let me tell you some of the rules?”  “Thank you,” said Priscilla again. She longed to add, “I should love beyond words to come into your room”; but instead she remarked icily, “I think Miss Heath has given me printed rules.”  “Oh, you have seen our dear Dorothea— I mean Miss Heath. Isn’t she lovely?”  “I don’t know,” answered Priscilla. “I think she’s rather a plain person.”  “My dear Miss”— I have not caught your name— “you really are too deliciously prosaic. Stay here for a month, and then tell me if you think Dorothea— I mean Miss Heath— plain. No, I won’t say any more. You must find out for yourself. But now, about the rules. I don’t mean the _printed_ rules. We have, I assure you, at St. Benet’s all kinds of little etiquettes which we expect each other to observe. We are supposed to be democratic and inclined to go in for all that is advanced in womanhood. But, oh dear, oh dear! let any student dare to break one of our own little pet proprieties, and you will see how conservative we can be.”  “Have I broken any of them?” asked Priscilla in alarm. “I did notice that every one stared at me when I came into the hall, but I thought it was because my face was fresh, and I hoped people would get accustomed to me by and by.”  “You poor, dear child, there are lots of fresh faces here besides yours. You should have come down under the shelter of my wing, then it would have been all right.”  “But what have I done? Do tell me. I’d much rather know.”  “Well, dear, you have _only_ come into the hall by the dons’ entrance, and you have _only_ seated yourself at the top of the table, where the learned students who are going in for a tripos take their august meals. That is pretty good for a fresher. Forgive me, we call the new girls freshers for a week or two. Oh, you have done nothing wrong. Of course not, how could you know any better? Only I think it would be nice to put you up to our little rules, would it not?”  “I should be very much obliged,” said Priscilla. “And please tell me now where I ought to sit at dinner.”  Miss Oliphant’s merry eyes twinkled.  “Look down this long hall,” she said. “Observe that door at the further end— that is the students’ door; through that door you ought to have entered.”  “Yes— well, well?”  “What an impatient ‘well, well.’ I shall make you quite an enthusiastic Benetite before dinner is over.”  Priscilla blushed.  “I am sorry I spoke too eagerly,” she said.  “Oh, no, not a bit too eagerly.”  “But please tell me where I ought to have seated myself.”  “There is a table near that lower entrance, Miss——”  “Peel,” interposed Priscilla. “My name is Priscilla Peel.”  “How quaint and great-grandmotherly. Quite delicious! Well, Miss Peel, by that entrance door is a table, a table rather in a draught, and consecrated to the freshers— there the freshers humbly partake of nourishment.”  “I see. Then I am as far from the right place as I can be.”  “About as far as you can be.”  “And that is why all the girls have stared so at me.”  “Yes, of course; but let them stare. Who minds such a trifle?”  Priscilla sat silent for a few moments. One of the neat waiting-maids removed her plate; her almost untasted dinner lay upon it. Miss Oliphant turned to attack some roast mutton with truly British vigor.  By and by Priscilla’s voice, stiff but with a break in it, fell upon her ear.  “I think the students at St. Benet’s must be very cruel.”  “My dear Miss Peel, the honor of the most fascinating college in England is imperiled. Unsay those words.”  Maggie Oliphant was joking. Her voice was gay with badinage, her eyes brimful of laughter. But Priscilla, unaccustomed to light repartee or chaff in any form, replied to her with heavy and pained seriousness.  “I think the students here are cruel,” she repeated. “How can a stranger know which is the dons’ entrance and which is the right seat to take at table? If nobody shows her, how can a stranger know? I do think the students are cruel, and I am sorry— very sorry I came.”     CHAPTER III AN UNWILLING “AT HOME”   Most of the girls who sat at those dinner-tables had fringed or tousled or curled locks. Priscilla’s were brushed simply away from her broad forehead. After saying her last words, she bent her head low over her plate and longed even for the protection of a fringe to hide her burning blushes. Her momentary courage had evaporated; she was shocked at having betrayed herself to a stranger; her brief fit of passion left her stiffer and shyer than ever. Blinding tears rushed to Priscilla’s eyes, and her terror was that they would drop on to her plate. Suppose some of those horrid girls saw her crying? Hateful thought. She would rather die than show emotion before them.  At this moment a soft, plump little hand was slipped into hers and the sweetest of voices said:  “I am so sorry anything has seemed unkind to you. Believe me, we are not what you imagine. We have our fun and our prejudices, of course, but we are not what you think we are.”  Priscilla could not help smiling, nor could she resist slightly squeezing the fingers which touched hers.  “You are not unkind, I know,” she answered; and she ate the rest of her dinner in a comforted frame of mind.  After dinner one of the lecturers who resided at Heath Hall, a pleasant, bright girl of two- or three-and-twenty, came and introduced herself, and presently took Priscilla with her to her own room, to talk over the line of study which the young girl proposed to take up. This conference lasted some little time, and then Priscilla, in the lecturer’s company, returned to the hall for tea.  A great many girls kept coming in and out. Some stayed to have tea, but most helped themselves to tea and bread and butter and took them away to partake of in their own private rooms.  Maggie Oliphant and Nancy Banister presently rushed in for this purpose. Maggie, seeing Priscilla, ran up to her.  “How are you getting on?” she asked brightly. “Oh, by-the-by, will you cocoa with me to-night at half-past ten?”  “I don’t know what you mean,” answered Priscilla. “But I’ll do it,” she added, her eyes brightening.  “All right, I’ll explain the simple ceremony when you come. My room is next to yours, so you’ll have no difficulty in finding me out. I don’t expect to have any one present except Miss Banister,” nodding her head in Nancy’s direction, “and perhaps one other girl. By-by, I’ll see you at half-past ten.”  Maggie turned to leave the hall, but Nancy lingered for a moment by Priscilla’s side.  “Wouldn’t you like to take your tea up to your room?” she asked. “We most of us do it. You may, you know.”  “I don’t think I wish to,” answered Priscilla in an uncertain voice.  Nancy half turned to go, then came back.  “You are going to unpack by and by, aren’t you?” she asked.  “Oh, yes, when I get back to my room.”  “Perhaps you ought to know beforehand; the girls will be coming to call.”  Priscilla raised her eyes.  “What girls?” she asked, alarm in her tone.  “Oh, most of the students in your corridor. They always call on a fresher the first night in her room. You need not bother yourself about them; they’ll just talk for a little while and then go away. What is the matter, Miss Peel? Maggie has told me your name, you see.”  “What you tell me sounds so very— very formal.”  “But it isn’t— not really. Shall I come and help you to entertain them?”  “I wish——” began"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/49897"],["title","The Gravity Business (#1)"],["body","to himself, too.\" Reba smiled at Grampa brilliantly. \"And maybe I thought he might grow into a man like his grandfather.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Grampa turned red and looked quickly toward Four. The boy was staring intently at Fweep. \"What you doing, Four?\"  \"Trying to figure out what Fweep does with the sweepings,\" Four said absently. \"The outer inch or two of his body gets cloudy and then slowly clears. I think I'll try him with a bigger particle.\"  \"That's the idea, Four. You'll be a Peppergrass yet. How about building me a pircuit?\"  \"You get the other one figured out?\"  \"It was easy,\" Grampa said breezily, \"once you understood the principle. The player who moved second could always win if he used the right strategy. Dividing the thirteen lights into three sections of four each--\"  \"That's right,\" Four agreed. \"I can make you a new one by cannibalizing the other pircuit, but I'll need a few extra parts.\"  Grampa pushed the wall beside his chair and a drawer slid out of it.  Inside were row after row of nipple-topped, flat-sided, flexible free-fall bottles and a battered cigar box. \"Thought you'd say that,\" he said, picking out the box. \"Help yourself.\" With the other hand, he lifted out one of the bottles and took a long drag on it. \"Ahhh!\" he sighed, wiped his mouth with the back of his hand, and carefully put the bottle away.  \"What is that stuff you drink, Grampa?\" Four asked.  \"Tonic, boy. Keeps me young and frisky. Now about that pircuit--\"  \"Did you ever work on Niccolò Tartaglia's puzzle about the three lovely brides, the three jealous husbands, the river and the two-passenger rowboat?\"  \"Yep,\" Grampa said. \"Too easy.\"  Four thought a moment. \"There's a modern variation with three missionaries and three cannibals. Same river, same rowboat and only one of the cannibals can row. If the cannibals outnumber the missionaries--\"  \"Sounds good, boy,\" Grampa said eagerly. \"Whip it up for me.\"  \"Okay, Grampa.\" Four looked at Fweep again. The translucent sphere had paused at Grampa's feet.  Grampa reached down to pat it. For an instant, his hand disappeared into Fweep, and then the alien creature rolled away. This time its path seemed crooked.  Its gelatinous form jiggled. \"Hic!\" it said.         *       *       *       *       *  As if in response, the flivver vibrated. Grampa looked querulously toward the airlock. \"Flivver shouldn't shake like that. Not with the polarizer turned on.\"  The airlock door swung inward. Through the oval doorway walked Fred, followed closely by Junior. They were sweat-stained and weary, scintillation counters dangling heavily from their belts.  \"Any luck?\" Reba asked brightly.  \"Do we look it?\" Junior grumbled.  \"Where's Joyce?\" asked Fred. \"Might as well get everybody in on this at once. Joyce!\"  The door to his wife's room opened instantly. Behind it, Joyce was regal and slim. The pose was spoiled immediately by her avid question: \"Any uranium? Radium? Thorium?\"  \"No,\" Fred said slowly, \"and no other heavy metals, either. There's a few low-grade iron deposits and that's it.\"  \"Then what makes this planet so heavy?\" Reba asked.  Junior shrugged helplessly and collapsed into a chair. \"Your guess is as good as anybody's.\"  \"Then we've wasted another week on a worthless rock,\" Joyce complained. She turned savagely on Fred. \"This was going to make us all filthy rich. We were going to find radioactives and retire to Earth like billionaires. And all we've done is spent a year of our lives in this cramped old flivver--and we don't have many of them to spare!\" She glared venomously at Grampa.  \"We've still got Fweepland,\" Four said solemnly.  \"Fweepland?\" Reba repeated.  \"This planet. It's not big, but it's fertile and it's harmless. As real estate, it's worth almost as much as if it were solid uranium.\"  \"A good thing, too,\" Junior said glumly, \"because this looks like the end of our search. Short of a miracle, we'll spend the rest of our lives right here--involuntary colonists.\"  Joyce spun on him. \"You're joking!\" she screeched.  \"I wish I were,\" Junior said. \"But the polarizer won't work. Either it's broken or there's something about the gravity around here that just won't polarize.\"  \"It's these '23 models,\" Grampa put in disgustedly. \"They never were any good.\"         *       *       *       *       *  The land of the Fweep turned slowly on its axis. The orange sun set and rose again and stared down once more at the meadow where the improbable spaceship rested on its improbable stern. The sixteen Earth hours that the rotation had taken had changed nothing inside the ship, either.  Grampa looked up from his pircuit and said, \"If I were you, Junior, I would take a good look at the TV repairman when we get back to Earth. _If_ we get back to Earth,\" he amended. \"You can't be Four's father. All over the Universe, gravity is the same, and if it's gravity, the polarizer will polarize it.\"  \"That's just supposition,\" Junior said stubbornly. \"The fact is, it isn't because it doesn't. Q.E.D.\"  \"Maybe the polarizer is broken,\" Fred suggested.  Grampa snorted. \"Broken-shmoken. Nothing to break, Young Fred. Just a few coils of copper wire and they're all right. We checked. We know the power plant is working: the lights are on, the air and water recirculation systems are going, the food resynthesizer is okay. And, anyway, the polarizer could work from the storage battery if it had to.\"  \"Then it goes deeper,\" Junior insisted. \"It goes right to the principle of polarization itself. For some reason, it doesn't work here. Why? Before we can discover the answer to that, we'll have to know more about polarization itself. How does it work, Grampa?\"  Grampa gave him a sarcastic grin. \"Now you're curious, eh? Couldn't be bothered with Grampa's invention before. Oh, no! Too busy. Accept without question the blessings that the Good Lord provideth--\"  \"Let's not get up on any pulpits,\" Fred growled. \"Come on, Grampa, what's the theory behind polarization?\"  Grampa looked at the four faces staring at him hopefully and the jeering grin turned to a smile. \"Well,\" he said, \"at last. You know how light is polarized, eh?\" The smile faded. \"No, I guess you don't.\"         *       *       *       *       *  He cleared his throat professorially. \"Well, now, in ordinary light the vibrations are perpendicular to the ray in all directions. When light is polarized by passing through crystals or by reflection or refraction at non-metallic surfaces, the paths of the vibrations are still perpendicular to the ray, but they're in straight lines, circles or ellipses.\"  The faces were still blank and unillumined.  \"Gravity is similar to light,\" he pressed on. \"In the absence of matter, gravity is non-polarized. Matter polarizes gravity in a circle around itself. That's how we've always known it until the invention of spaceships and later the polarizer. The polarizer polarizes gravity into a straight line. That makes the ship take off and continue accelerating until the polarizer is shut off or its angle is shifted.\"  The faces looked at him silently. Finally Joyce could endure it no longer. \"That's just nonsense! You all know it. Grampa's no genius. He's just a tinkerer. One day he happened to tinker out the polarizer. He doesn't know how it works any more than I do.\"  \"Now wait a minute!\" Grampa protested. \"That's not fair. Maybe I didn't figure out the theory myself, but I read everything the scientists ever wrote about it. Wanted to know myself what made the blamed thing work. What I told you is what the scientists said, near as I remember. Now me--I'm like Edison. I do it and let everybody else worry over 'why.'\"  \"The only thing you ever did was the polarizer,\" Joyce snapped. \"And then you spent everything you got from it on those fool perpetual-motion machines and those crazy longevity schemes when any moron would know they were impossible.\"  Grampa squinted at her sagely. \"That's what they said about the gravity polarizer before I invented it.\"  \"But you don't really know why it works,\" Junior persisted.  \"Well, no,\" Grampa admitted. \"Actually I was just fiddling around with some coils when one of them took off. Went right through the ceiling, dragging a battery behind it. I guess it's still going. Ought to be out near the Horsehead Nebula by now. Luckily, I remembered how I'd wound it.\"  \"Why won't the ship work then, if you know so much?\" Joyce demanded ironically.  \"Well, now,\" Grampa said in bafflement, \"it rightly should, you know.\"         *       *       *       *       *  \"We're stuck,\" Reba said softly. \"We might as well admit it. All we can do is set the transmitter to send out an automatic distress call--\"  \"Which,\" Joyce interrupted, \"might get picked up in a few centuries.\"  \"And make the best of what we've got,\" Reba went on, unheeding. \"If we look at it the right way, it's quite a lot. A beautiful, fertile world. Earth gravity. The flivver--even if the polarizer won't work, there's the resynthesizer; it will keep us in food and clothes for years. By then, we should have a good-sized community built up, because out here we won't have to stop with one child. We can have all the babies we want.\"  \"You know the law: one child per couple,\" Joyce reminded her frigidly. \"You can condemn yourself to exile from civilization if you wish. Not me.\"  Junior frowned at his wife. \"I believe you're actually glad it happened.\"  \"I could think of worse things,\" Reba said.  \"I like your spunk, Reb,\" Grampa muttered.  \"Speaking of children,\" Junior said, \"where's Four?\"  \"Here.\" Four came through the airlock and trudged across the room, carrying a curious contraption made of tripod legs supporting a small box from which dangled a plumb bob. Behind Four, like a round, raspberry shadow, rolled Fweep.  \"Fweep?\" it queried hopefully.  \"Not now,\" said Four.  \"Where've you been?\" Reba asked anxiously. \"What've you been doing?\"  \"I've been all over Fweepland,\" Four said wearily, \"trying to locate its"]]]
