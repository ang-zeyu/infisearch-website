Lon Simpson cultivated his _thanar_ fields. But he began to worry. His new power source was more than a repair for a broken-down tractor. It was valuable. It was riches! He had in it one of those basic, overwhelmingly important discoveries by which human beings have climbed up from the status of intelligent Earthbound creatures to galactic colonists--And a lot of good it had done them!  It was a basic principle for power supply that would relieve mankind permanently of the burden of fuels. The number of planets available for colonization would be multiplied. The cost of every object made by human beings would be reduced by the previous cost of power. The price of haulage from one planet to another would be reduced to a fraction. Every member of the human race would become richer as a result of the gadget now attached to Lon Simpson's tractor. He was entitled to royalties on the wealth he was to distribute. But....  He was a _thanar_ farmer on Cetis Gamma Two. His crop was mortgaged. He could not possibly hope to raise enough money to get back to Earth to arrange for the marketing of his invention. Especially, he could not conceivably raise money enough to take Cathy with him. He had riches, but they weren't available. And something else might happen to ruin him at any time.  Something else did. The freezer element of his deep-freeze locker broke down. He didn't notice it. He had a small kitchen locker in which food for week-to-week use was stored. He didn't know anything about the deep-freeze unit that held a whole growing season's supply of food. The food in it--all imported from Earth and very expensive--thawed, fermented, spoiled, developed evil smelling gases, and waited for an appropriate moment to reveal itself as a catastrophe.  There were other things to worry about at the time. A glacier up at Cetis Gamma Two's polar region began to retreat, instead of growing as was normal for the season. There was a remarkable solar prominence of three days' duration swinging around the equator of the local sun. There was a meeting of directors of the Cetis Gamma Trading Company, at which one of the directors pointed out that the normal curve of increase for profits was beginning to flatten out, and something had to be done to improve the financial position of the company. Ugly sun-spots appeared on the northern hemisphere of Cetis Gamma. If there had been any astronomers on the job, there would have been as much excitement as a four alarm fire. But there were no astronomers.  The greatest agitation on the second planet of Cetis Gamma Two was felt by Lon Simpson. Cathy had made friends with a married woman colonist who would chaperon her on a visit to Lon's farm, and was coming out to visit and see the place that was to be the scene of the ineffable, unparalleled happiness she and Lon would know after they were married.  She came, she saw, she was captivated. Lon blissfully opened the door of the house she was to share. He had spent the better part of two days cleaning up so it would be fit for her to look at. Cathy entered. There was a dull, booming noise, a hissing, and a bubbling, and then a rank stench swept through the house and strangled them.         *       *       *       *       *  The boom, of course, was the bursting open of the deep-freeze locker from the pressure of accumulated gases within it. The smell was that of the deep-freeze contents, ten days thawed out without Lon knowing it. There are very few smells much worse than frozen fish gone very, very bad in a hot climate. If there are worse smells, they come from once-frozen eggs bursting from their shells when pressure outside them is relieved. In this case, trimmings were added by fermenting strawberries, moldy meat and badly decayed vegetables, all triumphantly making themselves known at the same instant.  Cathy gasped and choked. Lon got her out of doors, gasping himself. It was not difficult to deduce what had happened.  He opened the house windows from the outside, so the smell could go away. But he knew despair.  \"I--can't show you the house, Cathy,\" he said numbly. \"My locker went bad and all the food followed suit.\"  \"Lon!\" wailed Cathy. \"It's terrible! How will you eat?\"  Lon began to realize that the matter was more serious than the loss of an opportunity for a sentimental inspection of the house. He had dreamed splendidly, of late. He didn't quite know how he was going to manage it, but since his tractor was working magnificently he had come to picture himself and Cathy in the r√¥le of successful colonists, zestfully growing _thanar_ leaves for the increasing multitudes of people who needed a milligram a day.  He'd reverted to the pictured dreams in the Cetis Gamma Trading Company's advertisements. He'd daydreamed of himself and Cathy as growing with the colony, thriving as it throve, and ultimately becoming moderately rich--in children and grandchildren, anyhow--with life stretching out before them in a sort of rosy glow. He'd negligently assumed that somehow they would also be rich from the royalties on his invention. But now he came down to reality.  His house was uninhabitable for the time being. He could continue to cultivate his fields, but he wouldn't be able to eat. The local plant-life was not suitable for human digestion. He had to live on food imported from Earth. Now he had to buy a new stock from the Company, and it would bankrupt him.  With an invention worth more--probably--than the Cetis Gamma Company itself, if he could realize on it, he still was broke. His crop was mortgaged. If Carson learned about his substitute for a generator, the Company would immediately clamp down to get it away from him.  He took Cathy back to Cetopolis. He feverishly appealed to other colonists. He couldn't tell them about his generator substitute. If they knew about it, in time Carson would know. If they used it, Carson would eventually get hold of a specimen, to send back to Earth for pirating by the Cetis Gamma Trading Company. All Lon could do was try desperately to arrange to borrow food to live on until his crop came in, though even then he wouldn't be in any admirable situation.  He couldn't borrow food in quantity. Other colonists had troubles, too. They'd give him a meal, yes, but they couldn't refill his freezer without emptying their own. Which would compel them to buy more. Which would be charged against their crops. Which would simply hasten the day when they would become day-laborers on the Company's _thanar_ farm.  Lon had about two days' food in the kitchen locker. He determined to stretch it to four. Then he'd have to buy more. With each meal, then, his hopes of freedom and prosperity--and Cathy--grew less.  Of course, he could starve....         *       *       *       *       *  Rhadampsicus was enormously and pleasantly interested in what went on in Cetis Gamma's photosphere. From the ninth planet, he scanned the prominences with enthusiasm, making notes. Nodalictha tried to take a proper wifely interest in her husband's hobby, but she could not keep it up indefinitely. She busied herself with her housekeeping. She fashioned a carpet of tufted methane fibres and put up curtains at the windows. She enlarged the garden Rhadampsicus had made, adding borders of crystallized ammonia and a sort of walkway with a hedge of monoclinic sulphur which glittered beautifully in the starlight. She knew that this was only a temporary dwelling, but she wanted Rhadampsicus to realize that she could make any place a comfortable home.  He remained absorbed in the phenomena of the local sun. One great prominence, after five days of spectacular existence, divided into two which naturally moved apart and stationed themselves at opposite sides of the sun's equator. They continued to rotate with the sun itself, giving very much the effect of an incipient pinwheel. Two other minor prominences came into being midway between them. Rhadampsicus watched in fascination.  Nodalictha came and reposed beside him on a gentle slope of volcanic slag. She waited for him to notice her. She would not let herself be sensitive about his interest in his hobby, of course, but she could not really find it absorbing for herself. A trifle wistfully, she sent her thoughts to the female biped on the second planet.  After a while she said in distress, \"Rhadampsicus! Oh, they are so unhappy!\"  Rhadampsicus gallantly turned his attention from the happenings on the sun.  \"What's that, darling?\"  \"Look!\" said Nodalictha plaintively. \"They are so much in love, Rhadampsicus! And they can't marry because he hasn't anything edible to share with her!\"  Rhadampsicus scanned. He was an ardent and sentimental husband. If his new little wife was distressed about anything at all, Rhadampsicus was splendidly ready to do something about it.         *       *       *       *       *  Lon Simpson looked at his kitchen locker. The big deep-freezer was repaired now. Once a season, a truck came out from Cetopolis and filled it. The food was costly. A season's supply was kept in deep-freeze. Once in one or two weeks, one refilled the kitchen locker. It was best to leave the deep-freeze locker closed as much as possible. But now the big deep-freeze was empty. He'd cleaned out the ghastly mess in it, and he had it running again, but he had nothing to put in it. To have it refilled would put him hopelessly at the Company's mercy, but there was nothing else to do.  Bitterly, he called the Trading Company office, and Carson answered.  \"This is Simpson,\" Lon told him. \"How much--\"  \"The price for a generator,\" said Carson, bored, \"is the same as before. Do you want it sent "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/51121"],["title","Spoken For (#1)"],["body"," that, I can only guess. The ship must have been involved in some accident. I must have been transferred to the lifeboat.\"  \"Alone?\" asked Carol's father.  \"No. There were two other patients with me. They were found dead. I was the only one left alive. The bodies of the crew members who transferred us weren't found at all. They might have gone back for more patients and then been unable to get away again.\"  \"Who found your lifeboat?\"  \"The crew of a freighter, who spotted it drifting across a space lane. They took me on board and revived me. But they were in a hurry and didn't have much time to stay and investigate.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Mr. Marsh was thoughtful and silent.  Carol asked, \"Weren't there any records in the lifeboat?\"  \"Nobody thought of that, at least not in the beginning. At first, when I regained consciousness, my mind was almost a complete blank. Then I began to remember things, but not enough. I couldn't recall where the colony had been, and after I had recovered enough to be able to get around, I began looking for my wife and children. I haven't come across a trace of them, although I've been on many worlds.\"  The food had long been ready and waiting. Until now, no one had thought of getting it. He stared as if through the wall and Carol, after she had set the dishes before him, had to remind him of their presence. When he did eat, it was automatically, without enjoyment.  Afterward, her father surprised Carol by saying, \"Why not stay with us overnight, Mr. Callendar? We have an extra room, and tomorrow I may be able to give you a little helpful information.\"  The man's eyes came alive. \"You're serious? You think that from what I told you, you'll be able to guess where I came from?\"  \"I used the word 'might.' Don't get your hopes up too much.\"  His face fell again. \"Thanks for warning me,\" he said in a flat tone.  When, later on, he had gone to his room, Carol said, \"Dad, do you really think you can help him?\"  \"That depends on your idea of help. Why are you so interested in him? Perhaps you're falling in love with him, Carol?\"  \"I think so.\"  \"Under the circumstances, that's completely idiotic. Would there be any sense in asking _why_ you fell in love with him?\"  \"Well, he looked so _lost_! I guess it's maternal--\"  \"As genuine a case of the grand passion as I've ever encountered,\" he said drily. \"Almost as genuine as your previous experience.\"  Carol flushed. \"He isn't like John.\"         *       *       *       *       *  \"Fortunately, you are right. Burr was essentially a selfish baby. I can't imagine him spending _his_ life looking for a wife and children he had lost. In future, Carol, if you must fall in love at all, do it suddenly. You choose much better that way.\"  \"Yes, I know,\" she said. \"Except for the fact that the wife and children may interfere. But don't worry, Dad. This time I'm not quitting my job and moving several million miles away to try to forget.\"  \"There'll be no need for that.\" His face took on a troubled expression. \"You'll have to face your problem right here.\"         *       *       *       *       *  \"You haven't answered _my_ question,\" said Carol. \"Do you really think you can help him?\"  \"That isn't an easy one to answer. We'll have to prepare him for a shock, Carol. A first-class shock. That's why I wanted to be sure you were in love with him. It may make things easier for him to stand.\"  \"What things?\"  Her father hesitated. \"Have you ever heard of this L-treatment he mentioned?\"  She shook her head.  \"I thought not. Carol,\" he said, and his voice was unexpectedly full of compassion, \"you're going to have a very sick man on your hands. It won't be pleasant for either you or me, and it's going to be horrible for him. But it must be gone through. He must be told.\"  \"For heaven's sake, what is it?\"  \"The L in L-treatment,\" he said slowly, \"stands for longevity. That was what he was treated for. But you see now why it was found to be dangerous and discontinued. The reason you never heard of it is that it was developed and discarded two hundred years ago. Callendar wasn't adrift in space for a year or two, as he thinks. He was adrift for two centuries.\"  \"No! Oh, _no_!\"  \"That's why the clothes in those pictures seemed odd. They've been in style and out again half a dozen times, with slight changes each time. That is why, furthermore, he can't find his wife and children on any of Jupiter's moons. The moons were first colonized ninety years ago.\"  \"But he says--\"  \"He'll never see his wife and children again. They've lived their lives and died and been buried in the past. He should have died with them in his own time and not lived into ours.\"  \"No,\" said Carol, \"or I'd never have known him.\"  She was white and trembling, and her father pulled her to him and let her head rest on his shoulder.  Mr. Marsh said, \"Perhaps you're right. I don't know. Anyway, he'll have to be told. And for your sake, I'd better do the telling.\"  Carol was silent, and they both thought of the sleeping man who didn't know that his old life had ended and that a new life was to begin so painfully in the morning."]]]
