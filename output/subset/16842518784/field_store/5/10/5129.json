Boyle, watching the first red tongue of flame lick out from the building behind, patted the serum case and set himself for the next step.  Immortality.         *       *       *       *       *  Locke took the helicar down through the mountains, skirting a clear swift river that broke into tumultuous falls a hundred yards below Boyle's cottage, and set it down in a flagstone court.  \"Out,\" Boyle ordered.  Moira met them in the spacious living room, her pretty face comical with surprise and dismay.  \"Philip, what's _happened_? You look so--\"  She saw the alien then and put a hand to her mouth.  \"Keep her quiet while I deal with Fermiirig,\" Boyle said to Locke. \"I have no time for argument. If either of you gives me any trouble....\"  He left the threat to Locke's stunned fancy and turned on the Alcorian.  \"Let me have the injection you had ready for Cornelison. Now.\"  The Alcorian moved his narrow shoulders in what might have been a shrug. \"You are making a mistake. You are not fitted for life beyond the normal span.\"  \"I didn't bring you here to moralize,\" Boyle said. \"If you mean to see your mate again, Fermiirig, give me the injection!\"  \"There was a time in your history when force was justifiable,\" Fermiirig said. \"But that time is gone. You are determined?\" He shook his head soberly when Boyle did not answer. \"I was afraid so.\"  He took the hypodermic needle out of its case, squeezed out a pale drop of liquid and slid the point into the exposed vein of Boyle's forearm.  Boyle, watching the slow depression of the plunger, asked: \"How long a period will this guarantee, in Earth time?\"  \"Seven hundred years,\" Fermiirig said. He withdrew the instrument and replaced it in its case, his liquid glance following Boyle's rising gesture with the freeze-gun. \"At the end of that time, the treatment may be renewed if facilities are available.\"  _Immortality!_  \"Then I won't need you any more,\" Boyle said, and rayed him down. \"Nor these other two.\"  Locke, characteristically, sprang up and tried to shield Moira with his own body. \"Boyle, what are you thinking of? You can't murder us without--\"  \"There's a very effective rapids a hundred yards down river,\" Boyle said. \"You'll both be quite satisfactorily dead after going through it, I think. Possibly unrecognizable, too, though that doesn't matter particularly.\"  He was pressing the firing stud, slowly because something in the tension of the moment appealed to the sadism in his nature, when an Orderman's freeze-beam caught him from behind and dropped him stiffly beside Fermiirig.         *       *       *       *       *  The details of his failure reached him later in his cell, anticlimactically, through a fat and pimply jailer inflated to bursting with the importance of guarding the first murderer in his generation.  \"AL&O kept this quiet until the Council killing,\" the turnkey said, \"but it had to come out when the Board of Order went after you. The Alcorians are telepathic. Santikh led the Ordermen to your place in the mountains. Fermiirig guided her.\"  He grinned vacuously at his prisoner, visibly pleased to impart information. \"Lucky for you we don't have capital punishment any more. As it is, you'll get maximum, but they can't give you more than life.\"  Lucky? The realization of what lay ahead of him stunned Boyle with a slow and dreadful certainty.  A sentence of life.  Seven hundred years.  Not immortality--  Eternity."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5089"],["title","Boris Godunov: a drama in verse (#1)"],["body","power upon me. Ah! How heavy    My weight of obligation!

Now let us go to kneel before the tombs    Of Russia's great departed rulers. Then    Bid summon all our people to a feast,    All, from the noble to the poor blind beggar.    To all free entrance, all most welcome guests.     (Exit, the Boyars following.)     PRINCE VOROTINSKY. (Stopping Shuisky.)    You rightly guessed.     SHUISKY.           Guessed what?     VOROTINSKY.                Why, you remember--    The other day, here on this very spot.     SHUISKY. No, I remember nothing.     VOROTINSKY.                    When the people    Flocked to the Virgin's Field, thou said'st--     SHUISKY.                           'Tis not    The time for recollection. There are times    When I should counsel you not to remember,    But even to forget. And for the rest,    I sought but by feigned calumny to prove thee,    The truelier to discern thy secret thoughts.    But see! The people hail the tsar--my absence    May be remarked. I'll join them.     VOROTINSKY.                    Wily courtier!     NIGHT  Cell in the Monastery of Chudov (A.D. 1603)     FATHER PIMEN, GREGORY (sleeping)     PIMEN (Writing in front of a sacred lamp.)    One more, the final record, and my annals    Are ended, and fulfilled the duty laid    By God on me a sinner. Not in vain    Hath God appointed me for many years    A witness, teaching me the art of letters;    A day will come when some laborious monk    Will bring to light my zealous, nameless toil,    Kindle, as I, his lamp, and from the parchment    Shaking the dust of ages will transcribe    My true narrations, that posterity    The bygone fortunes of the orthodox    Of their own land may learn, will mention make    Of their great tsars, their labours, glory, goodness--    And humbly for their sins, their evil deeds,    Implore the Saviour's mercy.--In old age    I live anew; the past unrolls before me.--    Did it in years long vanished sweep along,    Full of events, and troubled like the deep?    Now it is hushed and tranquil. Few the faces    Which memory hath saved for me, and few    The words which have come down to me;--the rest    Have perished, never to return.--But day    Draws near, the lamp burns low, one record more,    The last. (He writes.)     GREGORY. (Waking.) Ever the selfsame dream! Is 't possible?    For the third time! Accursed dream! And ever    Before the lamp sits the old man and writes--    And not all night, 'twould seem, from drowsiness,    Hath closed his eyes. I love the peaceful sight,    When, with his soul deep in the past immersed,    He keeps his chronicle. Oft have I longed    To guess what 'tis he writes of. Is 't perchance    The dark dominion of the Tartars? Is it    Ivan's grim punishments, the stormy Council    of Novgorod? Is it about the glory    Of our dear fatherland?--I ask in vain!    Not on his lofty brow, nor in his looks    May one peruse his secret thoughts; always    The same aspect; lowly at once, and lofty--    Like some state Minister grown grey in office,    Calmly alike he contemplates the just    And guilty, with indifference he hears    Evil and good, and knows not wrath nor pity.     PIMEN. Wakest thou, brother?     GREGORY.             Honoured father, give me    Thy blessing.     PIMEN.      May God bless thee on this day,    Tomorrow, and for ever.     GREGORY.              All night long    Thou hast been writing and abstained from sleep,    While demon visions have disturbed my peace,    The fiend molested me. I dreamed I scaled    By winding stairs a turret, from whose height    Moscow appeared an anthill, where the people    Seethed in the squares below and pointed at me    With laughter. Shame and terror came upon me--    And falling headlong, I awoke. Three times    I dreamed the selfsame dream. Is it not strange?     PIMEN. 'Tis the young blood at play; humble thyself    By prayer and fasting, and thy slumber's visions    Will all be filled with lightness. Hitherto    If I, unwillingly by drowsiness    Weakened, make not at night long orisons,    My old-man's sleep is neither calm nor sinless;    Now riotous feasts appear, now camps of war,    Scuffles of battle, fatuous diversions    Of youthful years.     GREGORY.         How joyfully didst thou    Live out thy youth! The fortress of Kazan    Thou fought'st beneath, with Shuisky didst repulse    The army of Litva. Thou hast seen the court,    And splendour of Ivan. Ah! Happy thou!    Whilst I, from boyhood up, a wretched monk,    Wander from cell to cell! Why unto me    Was it not given to play the game of war,    To revel at the table of a tsar?    Then, like to thee, would I in my old age    Have gladly from the noisy world withdrawn,    To vow myself a dedicated monk,    And in the quiet cloister end my days.     PIMEN. Complain not, brother, that the sinful world    Thou early didst forsake, that few temptations    The All-Highest sent to thee. Believe my words;    The glory of the world, its luxury,    Woman's seductive love, seen from afar,    Enslave our souls. Long have I lived, have taken    Delight in many things, but never knew    True bliss until that season when the Lord    Guided me to the cloister. Think, my son,    On the great tsars; who loftier than they?    God only. Who dares thwart them? None. What then?    Often the golden crown became to them    A burden; for a cowl they bartered it.    The tsar Ivan sought in monastic toil    Tranquility; his palace, filled erewhile    With haughty minions, grew to all appearance    A monastery; the very rakehells seemed    Obedient monks, the terrible tsar appeared    A pious abbot. Here, in this very cell    (At that time Cyril, the much suffering,    A righteous man, dwelt in it; even me    God then made comprehend the nothingness    Of worldly vanities), here I beheld,    Weary of angry thoughts and executions,    The tsar; among us, meditative, quiet    Here sat the Terrible; we motionless    Stood in his presence, while he talked with us    In tranquil tones. Thus spake he to the abbot    And all the brothers: \"My fathers, soon will come    The longed-for day; here shall I stand before you,    Hungering for salvation; Nicodemus,    Thou Sergius, Cyril thou, will all accept    My spiritual vow; to you I soon shall come    Accurst in sin, here the clean habit take,    Prostrate, most holy father, at thy feet.\"    So spake the sovereign lord, and from his lips    Sweetly the accents flowed. He wept; and we    With tears prayed God to send His love and peace    Upon his suffering and stormy soul.--    What of his son Feodor? On the throne    He sighed to lead the life of calm devotion.    The royal chambers to a cell of prayer    He turned, wherein the heavy cares of state    Vexed not his holy soul. God grew to love    The tsar's humility; in his good days    Russia was blest with glory undisturbed,    And in the hour of his decease was wrought    A miracle unheard of; at his bedside,    Seen by the tsar alone, appeared a being    Exceeding bright, with whom Feodor 'gan    To commune, calling him great Patriarch;--    And all around him were possessed with fear,    Musing upon the vision sent from Heaven,    Since at that time the Patriarch was not present    In church before the tsar. And when he died    The palace was with holy fragrance filled.    And like the sun his countenance outshone.    Never again shall we see such a tsar.--    O, horrible, appalling woe! We have sinned,    We have angered God; we have chosen for our ruler    A tsar's assassin.     GREGORY.         Honoured father, long    Have I desired to ask thee of the death    Of young Dimitry, the tsarevich; thou,    'Tis said, wast then at Uglich.     PIMEN.                        Ay, my son,    I well remember. God it was who led me    To witness that ill deed, that bloody sin.    I at that time was sent to distant Uglich    Upon some mission. I arrived at night.    Next morning, at the hour of holy mass,    I heard upon a sudden a bell toll;    'Twas the alarm bell. Then a cry, an uproar;    Men rushing to the court of the tsaritsa.    Thither I haste, and there had flocked already    All Uglich. There I see the young tsarevich    Lie slaughtered: the queen mother in a swoon    Bowed over him, his nurse in her despair    Wailing; and then the maddened people drag    The godless, treacherous nurse away. Appears    Suddenly in their midst, wild, pale with rage,    Judas Bityagovsky. \"There, there's the villain!\"    Shout on all sides the crowd, and in a trice    He was no more. Straightway the people rushed    On the three fleeing murderers; they seized    The hiding miscreants and led them up    To the child's corpse yet warm; when lo! A marvel--    The dead child all at once began to tremble!    \"Confess!\" the people thundered; and in terror    Beneath the axe the villains did confess--    And named Boris.     GREGORY.       How many summers lived    The murdered boy?     PIMEN.          Seven summers; he would now    (Since then have passed ten years--nay, more--twelve years)    He would have been of equal age to thee,    And would have reigned; but God deemed otherwise.    This is the lamentable tale wherewith    My chronicle doth end; since then I little    Have dipped in worldly business. Brother Gregory,    Thou hast illumed thy mind by earnest study;    To thee I hand my task. In hours exempt    From the soul's exercise, do"]]]
