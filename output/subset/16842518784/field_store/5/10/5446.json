In the earliest ages even he is      prominent in the nether world.  He conducts the mummifying process,      preserves the corpse, guards the Necropolis, and, as Hermes      Psychopompos (Hermanubis), opens the way for the souls.  According      to Plutarch \"He is the watch of the gods as the dog is the watch of      men.\"]  The remnants of the meat offerings from the altars were consumed by them; to the perfect satisfaction of the devotees, who, when they found that by the following day the meat had disappeared, believed that it had been accepted and taken away by the spirits of the underworld.  They also did the duty of trusty watchers, for they were a dangerous foe for any intruder who, under the shadow of the night, might attempt to violate a grave.  Thus--on that summer evening of the year 1352 B.C., when we invite the reader to accompany us to the Necropolis of Thebes--after the priests' hymn had died away, all was still in the City of the Dead.  The soldiers on guard were already returning from their first round when suddenly, on the north side of the Necropolis, a dog barked loudly; soon a second took up the cry, a third, a fourth.  The captain of the watch called to his men to halt, and, as the cry of the dogs spread and grew louder every minute, commanded them to march towards the north.  The little troop had reached the high dyke which divided the west bank of the Nile from a branch canal, and looked from thence over the plain as far as the river and to the north of the Necropolis.  Once more the word to \"halt\" was given, and as the guard perceived the glare of torches in the direction where the dogs were barking loudest, they hurried forward and came up with the author of the disturbance near the Pylon of the temple erected by Seti I., the deceased father of the reigning King Rameses II.       [The two pyramidal towers joined by a gateway which formed the      entrance to an Egyptian temple were called the Pylon.]  The moon was up, and her pale light flooded the stately structure, while the walls glowed with the ruddy smoky light of the torches which flared in the hands of black attendants.  A man of sturdy build, in sumptuous dress, was knocking at the brass- covered temple door with the metal handle of a whip, so violently that the blows rang far and loud through the night.  Near him stood a litter, and a chariot, to which were harnessed two fine horses.  In the litter sat a young woman, and in the carriage, next to the driver, was the tall figure of a lady.  Several men of the upper classes and many servants stood around the litter and the chariot.  Few words were exchanged; the whole attention of the strangely lighted groups seemed concentrated on the temple-gate.  The darkness concealed the features of individuals, but the mingled light of the moon and the torches was enough to reveal to the gate-keeper, who looked down on the party from a tower of the Pylon, that it was composed of persons of the highest rank; nay, perhaps of the royal family.  He called aloud to the one who knocked, and asked him what was his will.  He looked up, and in a voice so rough and imperious, that the lady in the litter shrank in horror as its tones suddenly violated the place of the dead, he cried out--\"How long are we to wait here for you--you dirty hound?  Come down and open the door and then ask questions.  If the torch-light is not bright enough to show you who is waiting, I will score our name on your shoulders with my whip, and teach you how to receive princely visitors.\"  While the porter muttered an unintelligible answer and came down the steps within to open the door, the lady in the chariot turned to her impatient companion and said in a pleasant but yet decided voice, \"You forget, Paaker, that you are back again in Egypt, and that here you have to deal not with the wild Schasu,--[A Semitic race of robbers in the cast of Egypt.]--but with friendly priests of whom we have to solicit a favor. We have always had to lament your roughness, which seems to me very ill- suited to the unusual circumstances under which we approach this sanctuary.\"  Although these words were spoken in a tone rather of regret than of blame, they wounded the sensibilities of the person addressed; his wide nostrils began to twitch ominously, he clenched his right hand over the handle of his whip, and, while he seemed to be bowing humbly, he struck such a heavy blow on the bare leg of a slave who was standing near to him, an old Ethiopian, that he shuddered as if from sudden cold, though- knowing his lord only too well--he let no cry of pain escape him. Meanwhile the gate-keeper had opened the door, and with him a tall young priest stepped out into the open air to ask the will of the intruders.  Paaker would have seized the opportunity of speaking, but the lady in the chariot interposed and said:  \"I am Bent-Anat, the daughter of the King, and this lady in the litter is Nefert, the wife of the noble Mena, the charioteer of my father.  We were going in company with these gentlemen to the north-west valley of the Necropolis to see the new works there.  You know the narrow pass in the rocks which leads up the gorge.  On the way home I myself held the reins and I had the misfortune to drive over a girl who sat by the road with a basket full of flowers, and to hurt her--to hurt her very badly I am afraid.  The wife of Mena with her own hands bound up the child, and then she carried her to her father's house--he is a paraschites--[One who opened the bodies of the dead to prepare them for being embalmed.]-- Pinem is his name.  I know not whether he is known to you.\"  \"Thou hast been into his house, Princess?\"  \"Indeed, I was obliged, holy father,\" she replied, \"I know of course that I have defiled myself by crossing the threshold of these people, but--\"  \"But,\" cried the wife of Mena, raising herself in her litter, \"Bent-Anat can in a day be purified by thee or by her house-priest, while she can hardly--or perhaps never--restore the child whole and sound again to the unhappy father.\"  \"Still, the den of a paraschites is above every thing unclean,\" said the chamberlain Penbesa, master of the ceremonies to the princess, interrupting the wife of Mena, \"and I did not conceal my opinion when Bent-Anat announced her intention of visiting the accursed hole in person.  I suggested,\" he continued, turning to the priest, \"that she should let the girl be taken home, and send a royal present to the father.\"  \"And the princess?\"  asked the priest.  \"She acted, as she always does, on her own judgment,\" replied the master of the ceremonies.  \"And that always hits on the right course,\" cried the wife of Mena.  \"Would to God it were so!\"  said the princess in a subdued voice.  Then she continued, addressing the priest, \"Thou knowest the will of the Gods and the hearts of men, holy father, and I myself know that I give alms willingly and help the poor even when there is none to plead for them but their poverty.  But after what has occurred here, and to these unhappy people, it is I who come as a suppliant.\"  \"Thou?\"  said the chamberlain.  \"I,\" answered the princess with decision.  The priest who up to this moment had remained a silent witness of the scene raised his right hand as in blessing and  spoke.  \"Thou hast done well.  The Hathors fashioned thy heart and the Lady of Truth guides it.  Thou hast broken in on our night-prayers to request us to send a doctor to the injured girl?\"       [Hathor was Isis under a substantial form.  She is the goddess of      the pure, light heaven, and bears the Sun-disk between cow-horns on      a cow's head or on a human head with cow's ears.  She was named the      Fair, and all the pure joys of life are in her gift.  Later she was      regarded as a Muse who beautifies life with enjoyment, love, song,      and the dance.  She appears as a good fairy by the cradle of      children and decides their lot in life.  She bears many names: and      several, generally seven, Hathors were represented, who personified      the attributes and influence of the goddess.]  \"Thou hast said.\"  \"I will ask the high-priest to send the best leech for outward wounds immediately to the child.  But where is the house of the paraschites Pinem?  I do not know it.\"  \"Northwards from the terrace of Hatasu,--[A great queen of the 18th dynasty and guardian of two Pharaohs]--close to--; but I will charge one of my attendants to conduct the leech.  Besides, I want to know early in the morning how the child is doing.--Paaker.\"  The rough visitor, whom we already know, thus called upon, bowed to the earth, his arms hanging by his sides, and asked:  \"What dost thou command?\"  \"I appoint you guide to the physician,\" said the princess.  \"It will be easy to the king's pioneer to find the little half-hidden house again--       [The title here rendered pioneer was that of an officer whose duties      were those at once of a scout and of a Quarter-Master General.  In      unknown and comparatively savage countries it was an onerous post.      --Translator.]  besides, you share my guilt, for,\" she added, turning to the priest, \"I confess that the misfortune happened because I would try with my horses to overtake Paaker's Syrian racers, which he declared to be swifter than the Egyptian horses.  It was a mad race.\"  \"And Amon be praised that it ended as it did,\" exclaimed the master of the ceremonies.  \"Packer's chariot lies dashed in pieces in the valley, and his best horse is badly hurt.\"  \"He will see to him when he has taken the physician to the house of the paraschites,\" said the princess.  \"Dost thou know, Penbesa--thou anxious guardian of a thoughtless girl--that to-day for the first time I am glad that my father is at the war in distant Satiland?\"--[Asia].  \"He would not have welcomed us kindly!\"  said the master of the ceremonies, laughing.  \"But the leech, the leech!\"  cried Bent-Anat"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/544"],["title","Anne's House of Dreams (#1)"],["body","there are no cannibals in Japan.\"  \"Your wedding dress is a dream, anyhow,\" sighed Diana rapturously. \"You'll look like a perfect queen in it--you're so tall and slender. How DO you keep so slim, Anne?  I'm fatter than ever--I'll soon have no waist at all.\"  \"Stoutness and slimness seem to be matters of predestination,\" said Anne.  \"At all events, Mrs. Harmon Andrews can't say to you what she said to me when I came home from Summerside, 'Well, Anne, you're just about as skinny as ever.'  It sounds quite romantic to be 'slender,' but 'skinny' has a very different tang.\"  \"Mrs. Harmon has been talking about your trousseau.  She admits it's as nice as Jane's, although she says Jane married a millionaire and you are only marrying a 'poor young doctor without a cent to his name.'\"  Anne laughed.  \"My dresses ARE nice.  I love pretty things.  I remember the first pretty dress I ever had--the brown gloria Matthew gave me for our school concert.  Before that everything I had was so ugly.  It seemed to me that I stepped into a new world that night.\"  \"That was the night Gilbert recited 'Bingen on the Rhine,' and looked at you when he said, 'There's another, NOT a sister.'  And you were so furious because he put your pink tissue rose in his breast pocket!  You didn't much imagine then that you would ever marry him.\"  \"Oh, well, that's another instance of predestination,\" laughed Anne, as they went down the garret stairs.    CHAPTER 2  THE HOUSE OF DREAMS  There was more excitement in the air of Green Gables than there had ever been before in all its history.  Even Marilla was so excited that she couldn't help showing it--which was little short of being phenomenal.  \"There's never been a wedding in this house,\" she said, half apologetically, to Mrs. Rachel Lynde.  \"When I was a child I heard an old minister say that a house was not a real home until it had been consecrated by a birth, a wedding and a death.  We've had deaths here--my father and mother died here as well as Matthew; and we've even had a birth here.  Long ago, just after we moved into this house, we had a married hired man for a little while, and his wife had a baby here.  But there's never been a wedding before.  It does seem so strange to think of Anne being married.  In a way she just seems to me the little girl Matthew brought home here fourteen years ago.  I can't realize that she's grown up.  I shall never forget what I felt when I saw Matthew bringing in a GIRL.  I wonder what became of the boy we would have got if there hadn't been a mistake.  I wonder what HIS fate was.\"  \"Well, it was a fortunate mistake,\" said Mrs. Rachel Lynde, \"though, mind you, there was a time I didn't think so--that evening I came up to see Anne and she treated us to such a scene.  Many things have changed since then, that's what.\"  Mrs. Rachel sighed, and then brisked up again.  When weddings were in order Mrs. Rachel was ready to let the dead past bury its dead.  \"I'm going to give Anne two of my cotton warp spreads,\" she resumed. \"A tobacco-stripe one and an apple-leaf one.  She tells me they're getting to be real fashionable again.  Well, fashion or no fashion, I don't believe there's anything prettier for a spare-room bed than a nice apple-leaf spread, that's what.  I must see about getting them bleached.  I've had them sewed up in cotton bags ever since Thomas died, and no doubt they're an awful color.  But there's a month yet, and dew-bleaching will work wonders.\"  Only a month!  Marilla sighed and then said proudly:  \"I'm giving Anne that half dozen braided rugs I have in the garret. I never supposed she'd want them--they're so old-fashioned, and nobody seems to want anything but hooked mats now.  But she asked me for them--said she'd rather have them than anything else for her floors. They ARE pretty.  I made them of the nicest rags, and braided them in stripes.  It was such company these last few winters.  And I'll make her enough blue plum preserve to stock her jam closet for a year.  It seems real strange.  Those blue plum trees hadn't even a blossom for three years, and I thought they might as well be cut down.  And this last spring they were white, and such a crop of plums I never remember at Green Gables.\"  \"Well, thank goodness that Anne and Gilbert really are going to be married after all.  It's what I've always prayed for,\" said Mrs. Rachel, in the tone of one who is comfortably sure that her prayers have availed much.  \"It was a great relief to find out that she really didn't mean to take the Kingsport man.  He was rich, to be sure, and Gilbert is poor--at least, to begin with; but then he's an Island boy.\"  \"He's Gilbert Blythe,\" said Marilla contentedly.  Marilla would have died the death before she would have put into words the thought that was always in the background of her mind whenever she had looked at Gilbert from his childhood up--the thought that, had it not been for her own wilful pride long, long ago, he might have been HER son. Marilla felt that, in some strange way, his marriage with Anne would put right that old mistake.  Good had come out of the evil of the ancient bitterness.  As for Anne herself, she was so happy that she almost felt frightened. The gods, so says the old superstition, do not like to behold too happy mortals.  It is certain, at least, that some human beings do not.  Two of that ilk descended upon Anne one violet dusk and proceeded to do what in them lay to prick the rainbow bubble of her satisfaction.  If she thought she was getting any particular prize in young Dr. Blythe, or if she imagined that he was still as infatuated with her as he might have been in his salad days, it was surely their duty to put the matter before her in another light.  Yet these two worthy ladies were not enemies of Anne; on the contrary, they were really quite fond of her, and would have defended her as their own young had anyone else attacked her.  Human nature is not obliged to be consistent.  Mrs. Inglis--nee Jane Andrews, to quote from the Daily Enterprise--came with her mother and Mrs. Jasper Bell.  But in Jane the milk of human kindness had not been curdled by years of matrimonial bickerings.  Her lines had fallen in pleasant places.  In spite of the fact--as Mrs. Rachel Lynde would say--that she had married a millionaire, her marriage had been happy.  Wealth had not spoiled her.  She was still the placid, amiable, pink-cheeked Jane of the old quartette, sympathising with her old chum's happiness and as keenly interested in all the dainty details of Anne's trousseau as if it could rival her own silken and bejewelled splendors.  Jane was not brilliant, and had probably never made a remark worth listening to in her life; but she never said anything that would hurt anyone's feelings--which may be a negative talent but is likewise a rare and enviable one.  \"So Gilbert didn't go back on you after all,\" said Mrs. Harmon Andrews, contriving to convey an expression of surprise in her tone.  \"Well, the Blythes generally keep their word when they've once passed it, no matter what happens.  Let me see--you're twenty-five, aren't you, Anne? When I was a girl twenty-five was the first corner.  But you look quite young.  Red-headed people always do.\"  \"Red hair is very fashionable now,\" said Anne, trying to smile, but speaking rather coldly.  Life had developed in her a sense of humor which helped her over many difficulties; but as yet nothing had availed to steel her against a reference to her hair.  \"So it is--so it is,\" conceded Mrs. Harmon.  \"There's no telling what queer freaks fashion will take.  Well, Anne, your things are very pretty, and very suitable to your position in life, aren't they, Jane? I hope you'll be very happy.  You have my best wishes, I'm sure.  A long engagement doesn't often turn out well.  But, of course, in your case it couldn't be helped.\"  \"Gilbert looks very young for a doctor.  I'm afraid people won't have much confidence in him,\" said Mrs. Jasper Bell gloomily.  Then she shut her mouth tightly, as if she had said what she considered it her duty to say and held her conscience clear.  She belonged to the type which always has a stringy black feather in its hat and straggling locks of hair on its neck.  Anne's surface pleasure in her pretty bridal things was temporarily shadowed; but the deeps of happiness below could not thus be disturbed; and the little stings of Mesdames Bell and Andrews were forgotten when Gilbert came later, and they wandered down to the birches of the brook, which had been saplings when Anne had come to Green Gables, but were now tall, ivory columns in a fairy palace of twilight and stars.  In their shadows Anne and Gilbert talked in lover-fashion of their new home and their new life together.  \"I've found a nest for us, Anne.\"  \"Oh, where?  Not right in the village, I hope.  I wouldn't like that altogether.\"  \"No.  There was no house to be had in the village.  This is a little white house on the harbor shore, half way between Glen St. Mary and Four Winds Point.  It's a little out of the way, but when we get a 'phone in that won't matter so much.  The situation is beautiful.  It looks to the sunset and has the great blue harbor before it.  The sand-dunes aren't very far away--the sea winds blow over them and the sea spray drenches them.\"  \"But the house itself, Gilbert,--OUR first home?  What is it like?\"  \"Not very large, but large enough for us.  There's a splendid living room with a fireplace in it downstairs, and a dining room that looks out on the harbor, and a little room that will do for my office.  It is about sixty years old--the oldest house in Four Winds.  But it has been kept in pretty good repair, and was all done over about fifteen years ago--shingled, plastered and re-floored.  It was well built to begin with.  I understand that there was some romantic story connected with its building, but the man I rented it from didn't know it.\"  \"He said Captain Jim was the only one who could"]]]
