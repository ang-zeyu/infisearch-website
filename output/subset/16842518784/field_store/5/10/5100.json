But pardon me for interrupting, my good man. What's the bad, bad hunch about this time?\"  \"Okay, I can take it.\" Dave grinned at him. But the grin quickly faded. \"Maybe it isn't a hunch,\" he said. \"Maybe it's just me. But I'm wondering if Old Man Jinx isn't catching up to us, Freddy?\"  \"Rubbish!\" the British-born air ace snorted. \"Positively ridiculous. Just because I had a little trouble with that Lightning, and brought it in for a terrible landing? Why--\"  \"And my crate couldn't fly for beans!\" Dawson interrupted. \"Plus the fact that it took us years to finally get away from North Africa. Plus the fact that we almost cashed in our chips in that pea soup fog. Plus--Oh nuts! Don't pay any attention to me. I've just turned into a wet smack of late. Call me Old Woman Dawson, pal.\"  \"I'd call you a lot of things, only there are ladies at the next table!\" Freddy Farmer said, and gave him the stern eye. \"You're just wound up a bit, Dave. Relax, old thing. Lord knows that's what you've told me enough times. Look, I've got a surprise, Dave!\"  \"Hold it!\" Dawson cried, and raised both hands in protest. \"If you think you're going to drag me halfway across London to see some weather-beaten joint where one of your famous kings stopped for tea and crumpets, you're--\"  \"The Holborn!\" Freddy stopped him. \"It's a theatre, and there's a very funny show playing there. Part American cast, too. I got the tickets this afternoon without saying anything to you. Well, what about it? Shall we go, or just sit here and mope about your blasted hunches?\"  \"Part American cast?\" Dawson echoed.  \"Yes, but they don't spoil the show too much, I hear!\" Freddy snapped at him. \"Well, is it a go?\"  \"On one condition,\" Dave said, and gave Farmer a very grave look.  \"And that is?\" the English youth walked into the trap.  \"That you wait until it's over before you ask me to explain the jokes and tag lines!\" Dawson said with a chuckle. Then quickly, \"Now, now, little man! Food's scarce in England. Put down that plate!\"  \"As if I'd waste a crumb on the likes of you!\" Freddy Farmer growled, but he did release his sudden hold on his plate. \"Now if there were a hammer or a length of lead pipe handy. Oh well, probably neither would make an impression on your thick skull!\"  Dawson laughed at the look on Freddy's face, and as he resumed eating his meal he suddenly realized that his mood of gloom and depression had gone. He felt swell; sitting right on top of the world.  As it was still early evening, the two aces took their time finishing the meal. But finally they settled the check and wandered out into the blacked out streets of London. As they reached the Strand they both impulsively paused and peered at the shadowy sky line. It was a long time since the Luftwaffe had given up the attempt to force stout-hearted London to its knees, but many scars of those weeks and months of nightly sky horror were still visible. No, there were not heaps of bomb rubble all about. On the contrary, Londoners had pitched to with a will and cleaned up their beloved city. The scars that Dawson and Freddy Farmer saw were simply the gaping holes where once a building, or a theater, or a row of shops, had been. In other words, it was not what they saw that sent their thoughts flying back to the blitz of London; it was the familiar things that they didn't see. And would never see again.  \"The dirty beggars!\" Freddy Farmer said in a low, strained voice. \"The dirty dogs for doing this to London!\"  \"Yeah,\" Dawson murmured. \"But they're getting paid back, pal. And how they're getting paid back! Before we're through they'll wish they'd never been born.\"  \"What a pity,\" young Farmer grunted.  \"Huh, pity?\" Dawson echoed sharply. \"Because we're smacking them plenty, and--\"  \"No,\" Freddy interrupted. \"I mean, what a pity any of them were ever born in the first place. So help me, I don't believe I'll ever live to see the day when just hearing the word Nazi won't make my blood boil, and make me see red.\"  \"And that goes for millions of people, Freddy,\" Dawson said. \"But right now, nuts to the future. Shall we try to flag a taxi in this sprawled out coal mine, or is the Holborn near enough to walk?\"  \"It's not far, so let's walk,\" young Farmer said. \"It will be like old times, perhaps.\"  \"Okay, Grandpa!\" Dawson laughed. \"But watch your step, and don't trip over your beard. And by all means, don't let us get lost, see?\"  \"Lost?\" Freddy Farmer snorted. \"Why, you could dump me down in any part of London, and I'd--\"  \"Which might not be such a bad idea at that!\" Dawson chuckled. \"Okay, my handsome guide, let's get going.\"  Keeping close to each other, they strolled up the Strand toward Aldwych Circle and Kingsway. They took their time, which was the best thing to do in London's blackout. Time and time again they almost bumped into persons coming their way. And more than once their teeth clicked as they went down off a curbstone they didn't see until too late. Eventually, though, they turned into Kingsway and started along toward High Holborn where the theater was located.  After a couple of blocks, however, they ran into a detour. And after a block or so the detour ran into another detour. And some ten minutes after that Dawson nudged his shoulder against Freddy Farmer's.  \"I don't want to imply anything, kind sir,\" he said, \"but you do happen to know where the heck we are, don't you?\"  \"Of course!\" the English youth snapped. \"This is Serle Street close by Lincoln's Fields. Second right and then first left will bring us right out on High Holborn at Chancery Lane.\"  \"Well, all those names make it _sound_ as if you knew what you're talking about,\" Dawson murmured.  \"Don't be silly!\" Freddy snapped. \"Would you get lost in a blackout in your precious New York?\"  \"Could happen, could happen,\" Dawson grunted. \"But I'm just hoping it isn't happening here.\"  \"No fear of that, my little man,\" Freddy assured him. \"Take hold of Pater's hand, and he'll lead you.\"  However, Dawson refused to do that. Fifteen minutes later, as the pair came to a cross street, Freddy Farmer paused and rubbed a hand down the side of his face.  \"Blast it, there shouldn't be a cross street here!\" he muttered.  \"Oh, oh!\" Dawson groaned. \"And my mother warned me, too!\"  \"Oh, shut up!\" Farmer growled. \"It's probably a new one they've made since I was here last.\"  Dawson didn't say anything. A small metal plate on the step post of the first building of the cross street caught his eye. He moved closer and snapped on his small pocket flashlight for an instant. When he came back to Freddy his voice was brittle.  \"And how were things in 1810 when you were here last, pal?\" he snapped. \"That's when that post plate says that building was built. Made the street since the blitz, huh? Or was there a blitz in 1810?\"  \"Oh, good grief, Dave, I'm afraid--!\" Freddy Farmer began.  \"I'm not _afraid_ we're lost!\" Dawson cut in. \"I'm dead certain, dope. Give me a shilling!\"  \"Why?\" Freddy demanded.  \"I'm going to toss it,\" Dawson said. \"Heads we go to the right, tails we go to the left.\"  \"But what about straight ahead?\" Farmer asked.  \"I've had enough of going straight ahead on this street!\" Dawson growled. \"For all you know it may go right off the edge of a cliff. But okay. If the shilling lands edge up we go straight ahead. Flash your beam on the sidewalk, Freddy.\"  Young Farmer did that. Dawson flipped the coin, which made a tinkling sound as it hit the sidewalk and bounced around. Finally it came to rest with the King's head showing.  \"We turn right,\" Dawson grunted, and picked up the shilling. \"And I'll just keep this as a little souvenir of the night's travels. Of all the--!\"  \"I'm sorry, Dave, blast it all!\" Freddy Farmer groaned. \"I guess the London streets aren't what they used to be.\"  \"In more ways than one, pal!\" Dave murmured. \"But dry your tears, little fellow. It's okay. Maybe we'll bump into a taxi at the next corner, or one of your London Bobbies who can give us a bearing and put us on the beam.\"  If the two air aces had turned left at that cross street they would have met a patrolling Bobbie within the next two hundred yards. But they turned right, and in so doing walked straight into the beginning of their greatest battle with Death, and Satan's forces of evil and ruthless destruction!     CHAPTER THREE  _The Dead Can't Breathe_   It was no doubt their imagination, but as Freddy Farmer and Dave Dawson walked along the street to the right they both felt as though it was even more blacked out. They could hardly see a dozen steps in front of them. On both sides the street was lined by a solid row of four or five story city dwellings, not one of which showed so much as a tiny pin point of light. Perhaps they were filled with men, women, and children, but as far as Freddy and Dave could tell they might well have been lost in the very heart of a completely dead city. They didn't even meet anybody on the sidewalk. In fact, they didn't meet anything but darkness, and more darkness. Clouds had crawled across the face of the sky, so it was only by straining their eyes that they were able to make out the silhouettes of the building tops. And to add to all that, the street seemed to go on and on, with not one single intersection.  Finally Dave drew to a halt, and made sounds in his throat.  \"Well, I guess we're even now, kid,\" he said with a groan. \"Because if you didn't lose us before, I sure have lost us now. This doggone street is like a subway tunnel with no end.\"  \"Quite!\" Freddy murmured. \"I almost wish the Luftwaffe would come over, so we could have some light and maybe see something. This is definitely a mess.\"  \"With all the trimmings,\" Dawson added. \"Look. Let's put it that that shilling gave us a bum steer. Let's go back and try the other way for a while. We're not going to meet anything this way, that's a cinch.\"  \"Right-o with me,\" young Farmer said. Then suddenly he grabbed Dawson's"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/50661"],["title","Dave Dawson at Singapore (#1)"],["body","of shoulders as broad as the back of a taxi cab. His face was lined and wrinkled from countless hours on the bridge in fair weather and bad. And it was the color of well tanned saddle leather, save a spot on each cheek that was apple red. The eyes were small and set wide apart, but in their depths was a glint that gave you the feeling the man could see right through six inch steel armor. All in all, Captain Standers looked quite capable of leaping overboard and shoving his cruiser back into deep water should it ever run aground.  He swept the two R.A.F. youths with his gimlet eyes as they entered his quarters and saluted.  \"At ease, Gentlemen,\" he said in a voice that could double for a foghorn. \"Be seated. It seems that news of your coming to Singapore has traveled ahead of you. I have a wireless, here, from Air Vice Marshal Bostworth, of Singapore Air Base. He has made a request regarding you two.\"  \"Air Vice Marshal Bostworth, of Singapore Base!\" Dawson gasped as the Cruiser's captain paused for breath. \"But there must be some mistake, sir. I mean, we saw Air Vice Marshal Bostworth just before we left England. It was he who okayed our request for transfer to duty with the Far East Fleet Air Arm.\"  Captain Standers snorted softly and gave Dawson a look as though he were some school kid who had fumbled his homework.  \"Quite, Flight Lieutenant,\" he said. \"But we've been at sea close to three weeks. It's quite possible to _fly_ from London to Singapore, via Egypt, in less than half that time.\"  \"Yes, sir, of course,\" Dave murmured as his face burned. \"I.... Well, it sort of startled me, sir.\"  \"Quite so,\" the Harkness' commander grunted. \"That is neither here nor there, however. The wireless is from Air Vice Marshal Bostworth, and it was sent from R.A.F. Base at Singapore. The request is for you two pilots to take one of the Harkness' planes aloft and cruise over the Singapore Strait for two hours and then proceed to the R.A.F. Base on the Island. Air Vice Marshal Bostworth will meet you there. You've got that all clear?\"  Freddy and Dave looked at each other, and their thoughts were identical. Was somebody trying to kid somebody, or something? Why in the world were they to take one of the Harkness' Bristol powered Fairey \"Swordfishes\" aloft and use up gas and oil for an hour or two? Why not go right on into the Johore Strait Naval Anchorage aboard the Harkness, and then step ashore to meet the Air Vice Marshal? It certainly didn't make sense, and the bewildered look that spread over each youth's face said as much to Captain Standers. He shrugged and made a little gesture with his hand.  \"Don't bother asking me questions,\" he said. \"I haven't the faintest idea what the answers should be. Sounds like so much R.A.F. rubbish, I fancy. However, the request has the approval of the Base Admiral, so there's only one thing I can do about it. Assign you to one of our planes, and let you go your way.\"  \"Begging your pardon, sir,\" Freddy Farmer spoke up, his face slightly crimson, \"but was that all to the message? Just that we go aloft and spend two hours in the air before landing at Singapore R.A.F. Base?\"  \"That was all, definitely,\" the Cruiser's captain replied. \"As a matter of fact, I didn't believe it myself and had the first message checked. The repeat was the same, however. Also, both messages were in a new emergency code. You say you saw Air Vice Marshal Bostworth just before you left England?\"  \"Yes, sir,\" the boys replied in one voice.  \"I see,\" the senior officer murmured. Then flinging them a keen look, \"He didn't mention anything about coming out to Singapore himself? Didn't say he might have a job for you two to do out here? The three of us know that Air Vice Marshal Bostworth is connected with Air Intelligence. And, naturally, your service records are not exactly deep dark secrets. You aren't, perhaps, as ignorant of what all this crazy business means as you appear to be, eh?\"  The two R.A.F. pilots grinned, but they both shook their heads.  \"Sorry, sir, but it's as much of a mystery to us,\" Freddy Farmer spoke for them. \"Air Vice Marshal Bostworth didn't even give us an inkling that he might be coming out here. It really is surprising news to us, sir.\"  Captain Standers hesitated as though about to speak, then thought better of it and pushed up onto his feet.  \"Well, one can't know about everything in this blasted war, I fancy,\" he grunted. \"You two had better get on with it. Use the plane on Catapult Number Three. I've already told the signal officer to make ready. Good luck. And, by the way!\"  \"Yes, sir?\" the two pilots murmured as the Cruiser's commander paused and scowled at his gnarled hands.  \"When you finally land at Singapore R.A.F. Base,\" he finally said, \"please mention to Air Vice Marshal Bostworth that I'd jolly well like to have the plane back before we put to sea again. Planes are hard enough to get as it is. Well, luck to you anyway.\"  Some twenty minutes later Dave Dawson and Freddy Farmer were seated in a pontoon fitted, Bristol Pegasus engined Fairey \"Swordfish\" mounted on the starboard launching arm of Number Three catapult. The engine was ticking over and the Signal Officer standing on the flight bridge was ready to \"shoot\" the plane off into the air as soon as Dave at the controls gave him the signal.  Checking his engine instruments for the last time, the Yank R.A.F. ace turned in the seat and looked back at his English pal.  \"All set for the mystery ride, Freddy?\" he called out.  Young Farmer made a face and nodded.  \"Let her go, Dave,\" he replied. \"But I certainly hope these two hours whizz by, so's we can land at Singapore Base and find out what in the world this all means!\"  \"You and me both!\" Dave grunted. \"I've been given a lot of screwy orders in my time, but this one is certainly tops. Oh, well, we'll get a nice look at this neck of the Far East, anyway. Okay! Hold your hat. The balloon's going up!\"  Turning front, Dave nodded to the waiting signal officer, and automatically braced his body and put his head firmly against the back rest, so that it wouldn't be snapped back when the launching \"trigger\" was pulled. A couple of seconds later the Swordfish's engine was roaring out its mighty song of power and straining at the locking-dogs that held it on the catapult arm. Another second and it was as though an invisible giant had slammed the rear end of the plane with the side of a barn door, or something. The Swordfish leaped forward like a scared cat. It shot off the end of the catapult arm, sank toward the water for a brief instant, then rose upward as the whirling prop bit into the air and produced flying speed.  Once clear and curving upward, Dave throttled slightly and held the nose on a gentle climb toward Heaven. He turned and grinned at Freddy and then glanced down back at the Harkness cutting through the sun flooded waters of the China Sea like a perfectly streamlined battle grey fish. For a moment signal flags that spelled out G-O-O-D L-U-C-K fluttered in the wind, then they were hauled down and the Harkness began falling far astern of the climbing plane. Dave looked front again, leveled off at a comfortable six thousand feet and relaxed comfortably in the seat.  \"Ladies and Gentlemen!\" came Freddy Farmer's voice to his ears. \"On the far left you have the British owned island of Singapore. Just above it is the Malay Peninsula where they produce about eighty per cent of all the rubber in the world. And tin, also. A bit more to the north is French Indo-China. Far to the right are the Philippines. And way in back of you are the Dutch East Indies, including Borneo and Sumatra. If you smoke cigars, Ladies and Gentlemen, you should be doubly interested in Sumatra because the famous Sumatra leaf used as an outside wrapper for many, many brands of cigars comes from Sumatra. Personally, I'm not very interested because I do not smoke cigars. However....\"  \"However, shut up, Professor!\" Dave interrupted with a laugh. \"We can see it all, and we studied all about these parts when we were in school. But ... there is one question I would like to ask the learned Professor.\"  \"Certainly, my child, certainly,\" Freddy Farmer replied. \"Go right ahead. What do you want to know?\"  \"Boy, are you sticking your chin out!\" Dave chuckled. \"Okay! Why _are_ we flying around up here, Professor?\"  \"Good Lord, I should have suspected that!\" Freddy Farmer groaned. \"Well, it's a secret. A very deep dark secret. Only one man knows. And so far he hasn't told anybody. He.... Hey, Dave!\"  \"Don't shout, I haven't jumped out, yet,\" Dave cried and turned quickly around. \"What...?\"  Dave stopped short and stared hard at his pal. Freddy Farmer was leaning way forward to the right and gaping puzzle eyed down at the rolling surface of the China Sea far ahead. He didn't switch his gaze to Dave's face. He simply made a little movement with one hand and kept his eyes riveted on something ahead.  \"Take a look way out there, Dave!\" he shouted. \"I thought I saw some flashes of light.\"  \"Light?\" Dawson echoed sharply. \"This time of day? Are you nuts, or just seeing things?\"  \"I saw something!\" the English youth said. \"At least I'd be willing to swear to it. Sort of flashes of light, as though some surface ship were signaling by mirror. You know, by heliograph.\"  Dave didn't make any comment to that for a moment or two. He had turned front and was sweeping the waters ahead and below with his eyes. However, that was all he saw. Just a limitless expanse of robin's egg blue water that was streaked and smeared with the gold of the blazing sun. True, the rays of the sun bouncing off the rolling blue swells seemed to shower up clusters of golden specks in all directions that dazzled his eyes. But no matter how hard he strained his eyes he could see not the slightest sign of a surface ship, to say nothing of the telltale ribbon of smoke trailing back from her stacks. Eventually he gave it up and turned to look at his pal"]]]
