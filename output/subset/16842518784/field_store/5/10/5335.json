But the walking-stick did not think best to answer immediately, but took entirely a new and surprising track. It actually went to quoting Scripture!  “My eyes are dim,” said the cane, “and I never had much learning; canes weren’t sent to school when I was young. Won’t you read the thirty-fifth verse of the twentieth chapter of Acts.”  Willie turned to the stand and saw the Bible open at that verse. He did not feel surprised. It seemed natural enough to him. He read the verse, not aloud, but to himself, for Old Ebony seemed to hear his thoughts. He read:--  “Ye ought to support the weak, and to remember the words of the Lord Jesus, how he said, It is more blessed to give than to receive.”  “Now,” said the walking-stick, stepping or hopping up toward the lounge and leaning thoughtfully over the head of it, “Now, I say that it is a shame that when the birthday of that Lord Jesus, who gave himself away, and who said it is more blessed to give than to receive, comes round, all of you Sunday-school scholars are thinking only of what you are going to get.”  Willie was about to say that they gave as well as received on Christmas, and that his class had already raised the money to buy a Bible Dictionary for their teacher. But Old Ebony seemed to guess his thought, and he only said, “And that’s another shame!”  Willie couldn’t see how this could be, and he thought the walking-stick was using very strong language indeed. I think myself the cane spoke too sharply, for I don’t think the harm lies in giving to and receiving from our friends, but in neglecting the poor. But you don’t care what I think, you want to know what the cane said.  “I’m pretty well acquainted with Scripture,” said Old Ebony, “having spent fourteen years in company with a minister. Now won’t you please read the twelfth and thirteenth verses of the fourteenth chapter of”--  But before the cane could finish the sentence, Willie heard some one opening the door. It was his father. He looked round in bewilderment. The oil in the lamp had burned out, and it was dark. The fire was low, and the room chilly.  “Heigh-ho, Willie, my son,” said Mr. Blake, “where’s your light, and where’s your fire. This is a cold reception. What have you been doing?”  “Listening to the cane talk,” he replied; and thinking what a foolish answer that was, he put on some more coal, while his mother, who was lighting the lamp, said he must have been dreaming. The walking-stick stood in its corner, face to the wall, as if it had never been a talking stick.     CHAPTER IV.  _MR. BLAKE AGREES WITH THE WALKING-STICK._   Early on Sunday morning Willie awoke and began to think about Sitles, and to wish he had money to buy him a broom-machine. And then he thought of widow Martin. But all his thinking would do no good. Then he thought of what Old Ebony had said, and he wished he could know what that text was that the cane was just going to quote.  “It was,” said Willie, “the twelfth and thirteenth verses of the fourteenth chapter of something. I’ll see.”  So he began with the beginning of the Bible, and looked first at Genesis xiv. 12, 13. But it was about the time when Abraham had heard of the capture of Lot and mustered his army to recapture him. He thought a minute.  “That can’t be what it is,” said Willie, “I’ll look at Exodus.”  In Exodus it was about standing still at the Red Sea and waiting for God’s salvation. It might mean that God would deliver the poor. But that was not just what the cane was talking about. It was about giving gifts to friends. So he went on to Leviticus. But it was about the wave offering, and the sin offering, and the burnt offering. That was not it. And so he went from book to book until he had reached the twelfth and thirteenth verses of the fourteenth chapter of the book of Judges. He was just reading in that place about Samson’s riddle, when his mamma called him to breakfast.  He was afraid to say anything about it at the table for fear of being laughed at. But he was full of what the walking-stick said. And at family worship his father read the twentieth chapter of Acts. When he came to the part about its being more blessed to give than to receive, Willie said, “That’s what the cane said.”  “What did you say?” asked his father.  “I was only thinking out loud,” said Willie.  “Don’t think out loud while I am reading,” said Mr. Blake.  Willie did not find time to look any further for the other verses. He wished his father had happened on them instead of the first text which the cane quoted.  In church he kept thinking all the time about the cane. “Now what could it mean by the twelfth and thirteenth verses of the fourteenth chapter? There isn’t anything in the Bible against giving away presents to one’s friends. It was only a dream anyhow, and maybe there’s nothing in it.”  But he forgot the services, I am sorry to say, in his thoughts. At last Mr. Blake arose to read his text. Willie looked at him, but thought of what the cane said. But what was it that attracted his attention so quickly?  “The twelfth and thirteenth verses”--  “Twelfth and thirteenth!” said Willie to himself.  “Of the fourteenth chapter,” said the minister.  “Fourteenth chapter!” said Willie, almost aloud.  “Of Luke.”  Willie was all ears, while Mr. Blake read: “Then said he also to him that bade him, When thou makest a dinner or a supper, call not thy friends, nor thy brethren, neither thy kinsmen, nor thy rich neighbors, lest they also bid thee again, and a recompense be made thee. But when thou makest a feast, call the poor, the maimed, the lame, the blind.”  “That’s it!” he said, half aloud, but his mother jogged him.  The minister added the next verse also, and read: “And thou shalt be blessed, for they cannot recompense thee; for thou shalt be recompensed at the resurrection of the just.”  Willie had never listened to a sermon as he did to that. He stopped two or three times to wonder whether the cane had been actually about to repeat his father’s text to him, or whether he had not heard his father repeat it at some time, and had dreamed about it.  I am not going to tell you much about Mr. Blake’s sermon. It was a sermon that he and the walking-stick had prepared while they were going round among the poor. I think Mr. Blake did not strike his cane down on the sidewalk for nothing. Most of that sermon must have been hammered out in that way, when he and the walking-stick were saying, “Something must be done!” For that was just what that sermon said. It told about the wrong of forgetting, on the birthday of Christ, to do anything for the poor. It made everybody think. But Mr. Blake did not know how much of that sermon went into Willie Blake’s long head, as he sat there with his white full forehead turned up to his father.     CHAPTER V.  _THE FATHER PREACHES AND THE SON PRACTICES._   That afternoon, Willie was at Sunday-school long before the time. He had a plan.  “I’ll tell you what, boys,” said he, “let’s not give Mr. Marble anything this year; and let’s ask him not to give us anything. Let’s get him to put the money he would use for us with the money we should spend on a present for him, and give it to buy coal for Old Aunt Parm’ly.”  “I mean to spend all my money on soft gum drops and tarts,” said Tommy Puffer; “they’re splendid!” and with that he began, as usual, to roll his soft lips together in a half chewing, half sucking manner, as if he had a half dozen cream tarts under his tongue, and two dozen gum drops in his cheeks.  “Tommy,” said stumpy little Sammy Bantam, “it’s a good thing you didn’t live in Egypt, Tommy, in the days of Joseph.”  “Why?” asked Tommy.  “Because,” said Sammy, looking around the room absently, as if he hardly knew what he was going to say, “because, you see”--and then he opened a book and began to read, as if he had forgotten to finish the sentence.  “Well, why?” demanded Tommy, sharply.  “Well, because if Joseph had had to feed you during the seven years of plenty, there wouldn’t have been a morsel left for the years of famine!”  The boys laughed as boys will at a good shot, and Tommy reddened a little and said, regretfully, that he guessed the Egyptians hadn’t any dough-nuts.  Willie did not forget his main purpose, but carried his point in his own class. He still had time to speak to some of the boys and girls in other classes. Everybody liked to do what Willie asked; there was something sweet and strong in his blue eyes, eyes that “did not seem to have any bottom, they were so deep,” one of the girls said. Soon there was an excitement in the school, and about the door; girls and boys talking and discussing, but as soon as any opposition came up Willie’s half coaxing but decided way bore it down. I think he was much helped by Sammy’s wit, which was all on his side. It was agreed, finally, that whatever scholars meant to give to teachers, or teachers to scholars, should go to the poor.  The teachers caught the enthusiasm, and were very much in favor of the project, for in the whole movement they saw the fruit of their own teaching.  The superintendent had been detained, and was surprised to find the school standing in knots about the room. He soon called them to order, and expressed his regrets that they should get into such disorder. There was a smile on all faces, and he saw that there was something more in the apparent disorder than he thought. After school it was fixed that each class should find its own case of poverty. The young men’s and the young women’s Bible classes undertook to supply Sitles with a broom-machine, a class of girls took Aunt Parm’ly under their wing, other classes knew of other cases of need, and so each class had its hands full. But Willie could not get any class to see that Widow Martin"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/52972"],["title","Letters from Muskoka (#1)"],["body","of our confinement was, however, much relieved by the pleasant society and kindness of two most amiable English ladies, who were going out to reside with a near relative at Montreal. Every day, after the saloon dinner, they came to our cabin, which they christened the “drawing-room,” and our pleasant conversations there laid the foundation of a friendship which I trust will ever remain unbroken. Our nights from various causes were weary and sleepless, but in the early morning and for some hours we had a diversion, which the proximity of our cabin to the steward’s pantry procured for us. Almost as soon as it was light, _Jupiter thundered from Olympus_, or in other words our black steward, who was punctiliously addressed as “Mr. H----s,” began the day’s proceedings by having the crockery and glass broken during the night by the rolling of the ship removed, and every order was given with a dignified pomposity which was most amusing.  We gave him and his assistants the sobriquet of “Jupiter and his satellites!” Mr. H----s was a portly negro of an imposing presence, and a benign expression of countenance which a little reminded one of “Uncle Tom” in Mrs. Beecher Stowe’s celebrated work. He exacted implicit obedience, but he was a very good man, strictly honest to his employers, and very considerate to those over whom he had any authority. Not once during the voyage did we hear from his lips an oath or an unseemly word.  The stewardess told us that he had a very pretty wife in London, a young Englishwoman, with a remarkably fair complexion. She also told us an amusing anecdote of Mr. H----s as steward of a troop-ship going out to India. One Sunday afternoon the young officers, tired of playing off practical jokes on each other, and half dead with _ennui_, applied to Mr. H----s to lend them a book to read.  “You know the sort of book we want, H----s,” said they; “plenty of love and fighting, and battles, and all that sort of thing!”  “I understand, gentlemen,” said Mr. H----s, and presently returned with a _large Bible_ which he placed before them. “There, gentlemen, you will find in that book all you want--beautiful love stories, fierce wars, and plenty of battles!”  His colour, however, was somewhat against him, and I could hardly keep my countenance when a young under-steward, to whom we were indebted for much attention, said to me with quite an injured air, “You know, ma’am, it does take it out of a feller to have to say ‘sir’ to a nigger!”  Of the young friend C. W., who came out with us, we saw but little, for though he had a first-class berth, he was a great deal in the steerage with your brother, who was a veritable “Mark Tapley” among the poor emigrants. He helped the minister in charge to keep order among them, he procured all manner of little extra comforts for the sick women from the surly cooks, and was the delight of all the children, who followed him in troops. He managed to be a good deal in our cabin when we were too ill to move, and also came to us on deck when we were able to crawl there. He was a favourite with all our fellow-passengers, and every lady knew she might depend upon his gentlemanly attentions if required. This comforted me a little for his being in such a disagreeable position.  The sea continued very rough indeed even after we were in the Gulf of St. Lawrence, and though I thought the _real blue water_ which I saw for the first time very beautiful, yet I could by no means join in the raptures of my fellow-passengers, but strictly averred, that although a passionate admirer of “Old Ocean,” it was most decidedly when I viewed it from _terra-firma_. I will not weary you with minute details of our slow passage up the beautiful St. Lawrence, nor dilate upon the interest I felt in watching, first the thinly-scattered white huts, and afterwards the thickly-clustered villages of the “habitants,” with their curious churches and shining spires, backed by the dark pine forests, and behind them ranges of blue-capped mountains, compared with which the hills of my own dear England were as hillocks.  We landed at Quebec and went to the Victoria Hotel, where your sister and I passed a few miserable hours of suspense and anxiety. We found ourselves at the very beginning of an immense journey utterly without means to carry us on beyond the first few stages. The little extra expenses paid on leaving the ship, and the clearing our baggage as far as Toronto, had all but emptied our purse. We were rich in nothing but delusive hopes and expectations, doomed, like the glass basket of celebrated “Alnaschars,” to be shattered and broken to pieces.  We half expected to find a letter with a small remittance waiting for us at the Quebec P. O. Our young friend C. W. was in the same strait, as his money-order was only payable in a bank at Toronto. Both the gentlemen left us and crossed the water to the town of Quebec, where, finding on due inquiry no letter of any kind, your brother was compelled to pledge his gold watch and seal, upon which, though so valuable, he could only get five pounds advanced. This unavoidable delay lost us the mid-day train to Montreal, by which we saw our kind friends depart after taking a most affectionate leave and engaging us to correspond with them. When our two gentlemen returned we were nearly starving, as we did not like to go to the _table-d’hôte_ without them, and the dinner had long been over. We all sallied forth, and found in a small wayside tavern a homely but excellent meal, and best of all, a private room to take it in. From thence we went to the station and started by the seven p.m. train for Montreal, being quite thankful that our journey had at length begun.     LETTER II.   My last letter left us starting from Quebec in the seven p.m. train for Montreal. Our party consisting of four people, we had a compartment to ourselves, but were some time in settling comfortably, as our old dog “Nero” had to be smuggled in and kept quiet under your sister’s waterproof-cloak, for fear the vigilant guard should consign him to the luggage-car, where he would infallibly have barked himself to death.  I noticed very little in the neighbourhood of Quebec, being too much occupied with my own sad thoughts, and regrets for those I had left behind; but I did observe that the cows, horses, and pigs all appeared very small and manifestly inferior to the cattle in England.  During this journey I could not help contrasting the mode of travelling in Canada with the same in the “old country,” and giving a decided preference to the former. It would be almost impossible for either murder, robbery, or any kind of outrage to be perpetrated where the compartments are all open, and the supervision of the guard walking up and down incessant. It is also a great alleviation to the fatigue of travelling to have the refreshment of iced water to drink, and the option of washing faces and hands. Towards night we were beguiled into “Pullman’s” sleeping-cars, little imagining how greatly it would add to the expense of the journey. Sleep, however, I found to be impossible in these close boxes, tier above tier, and towards midnight, half smothered, I made my way to the carriage we had occupied before retiring.  About this time the train came to a sudden stop, and at last I asked the guard why we were so long stationary. He told me that a train which ought to have been in before us was missing, that men had gone out with lanterns to look for it, and that for fear of being run into we must wait till it came up. A most dreary four hours we passed before we were released. We were at a small station in a barren spot of country, where nothing was to be seen in the dim light but a few miserable-looking wooden houses scattered about. It was a cheerless prospect, and we were thankful when at length we went on.  We passed the morning more agreeably, as the guard, a quiet, intelligent man, entered into conversation with us. He was telling us of a curious and erudite book about to be published at Boston, Massachusetts, compiled by one of his relations, from numerous records and papers treasured in the family, and handed down from one generation to another, beginning with the first landing of the “Pilgrim Fathers.”  His ancestor, with his family, came out in the _Mayflower_, and from that time to the present they had had an unbroken succession of godly ministers, who in the early times of their settlement were called, in the old Puritan phraseology, “sons of thunder.” In the spring of 1871, he had attended the annual family gathering at Boston, to which the remotest connections, if possible, came. I regret much that I did not take down his name.  In consequence of our long delay in the night, we did not arrive at Montreal in time for the early train, but had to breakfast there, and remain a few hours. When we started, we found that we had a hot and dusty journey before us. I greatly admired the environs of Montreal, particularly some pretty villa residences, perched, as it were, in terraces one above the other.  An incident occurred in the course of the day which afforded me a few moments of exquisite satisfaction, which every mother will understand.  While our train was drawn up before a small station, an emigrant train, going to some distant part, went past. Numbers of the emigrants were there who had been steerage passengers on board our vessel from England. As your brother was standing, with C. W., on the steps of one of the carriages, he was recognised, and they immediately vociferated, “Mr. K.! Mr. K.! three cheers for Mr. K.!” Then arose three deafening cheers, which died away in the distance; but not before your sister and I, looking out of the window, saw an indefinite number of pocket-handkerchiefs, of all colours and dimensions, fluttering from the windows in token of recognition.  Towards the evening of this day, as we were nearing Toronto, another stoppage occurred, similar to the one of the night before."]]]
