A Novel (#2)"],["body"," sat together in a dark, low-ceilinged room; its open door--it was far too hot to close anything that admitted air--gave straight onto the street, and the one big window opened on a courtyard, where a pair of game-cocks fought in and out between the restless legs of horses, while a yelling horde betted on them. On a heap of grass fodder in a corner of the yard an all-but-naked expert in inharmony thumped a skin tom-tom with his knuckles, while at his feet the own-blood brother to the screech-owls wailed of hell's torments on a wind instrument.  Din--glamour--stink--incessant movement--interblended poverty and riches rubbing shoulders--noisy self-interest side by side with introspective revery, where stray priests nodded in among the traders,--many-peopled India surged in miniature between the four hot walls and through the passage to the overflowing street; changeable and unexplainable, in ever-moving flux, but more conservative in spite of it than the very rocks she rests on--India who is sister to Aholibah and mother of all fascination.  In that room with the long window, low-growled, the one thin thread of clear-sighted unselfishness was reeling out to very slight approval. Mahommed Gunga paced the floor and kicked his toes against the walls, as he turned at either end, until his spurs jingled, and looked with blazing dark-brown eyes from one man to the other.  “What good ever came of listening to priests?” he asked. “All priests are alike--ours, and theirs, and padre-sahibs! They all preach peace and goad the lust that breeds war and massacre! Does a priest serve any but himself? Since when? There will come this rising that the priests speak of--yes! Of a truth, there will, for the priests will see to it! There is a padre-sahib here in Howrah now for the Hindoo priests to whet their hate on. You saw the woman ride past here a half-hour gone? There is a pile of tinder ready here, and any fool of a priest can make a spark! There will be a rising, and a big one!”  “There will! Of a truth, there will!” Alwa, his cousin, crossed one leg above the other with a clink of spurs and scabbard. He had no objection to betraying interest, but declined for the present to betray his hand.  “There will be a blood-letting that will do no harm to us Rajputs!”  said another man, whose eyes gleamed from the darkest corner; he, too, clanked his scabbard as though the sound were an obbligato to his thoughts. “Sit still and say nothing is my advice; we will be all ready to help ourselves when the hour comes!”  “It is this way,” said Mahommed Gunga, standing straddle-legged to face all five of them, with his back to the window. He stroked his black beard upward with one hand and fingered with the other at his sabre-hilt. “Without aid when the hour does come, the English will be smashed--worn down--starved out--surrounded--stamped out--annihilated--so!” He stamped with his heel descriptively on the hard earth floor. “And then, what?”  “Then, the plunder!” said Alwa, showing a double row of wonderful white teeth. The other four grinned like his reflections. “Ay, there will be plunder--for the priests! And we Rajputs will have new masters over us! Now, as things are, we have honorable men. They are fools, for any man is a fool who will not see and understand the signs. But they are honest. They ride straight! They look us straight between the eyes, and speak truth, and fear nobody! Will the Hindoo priests, who will rule India afterward, be thus? Nay! Here is one sword for the British when the hour comes!”  “I have yet to see a Hindoo priest rule me or plunder me!” said Alwa with a grin.  “You will live to see it!” said Mahommed Gunga. “Truly, you will live to see it, unless you throw your weight into the other scale! What are we Rajputs without a leader whom we all trust? What have we ever been?”  He swung on his heels suddenly--angrily--and began to pace the floor again--then stopped.  “Divided, and again subdivided--one-fifth Mohammedan and four-fifths Hindoo--clan within clan, and each against the other. Do we own Rajputana? Nay! Do we rule it? Nay! What were we until Cunnigan-bahadur came?”  “Ah!” All five men rose with a clank in honor to the memory of that man. “Cunnigan-bahadur! Show us such another man as he was, and I and mine ride at his back!” said Alwa. “Not all the English are like Cunnigan! A Cunnigan could have five thousand men the minute that he asked for them!”  “Am I a wizard?--Can I cast spells and bring dead men's spirits from the dead again? I know of no man to take his place,” said Mahommed Gunga sadly.  He was the poorest of them, but they were all, comparatively speaking, poor men; for the long peace had told its tale on a race of men who are first gentlemen, then soldiers, and last--least of all--and only as a last resource, landed proprietors. The British, for whom they had often fought because that way honor seemed to lie, had impoverished them afterward by passing and enforcing zemindary laws that lifted nine-tenths of the burden from the necks of starving tenants. The new law was just, as the Rajputs grudgingly admitted, but it pinched their pockets sadly; like the old-time English squires, they would give their best blood and their last rack-rent-wrung rupee for the cause that they believed in, but they resented interference with the rack-rents! Mahommed Gunga had had influence enough with these five landlord relations of his to persuade them to come and meet him in Howrah City to discuss matters; the mere fact that he had thought it worth his while to leave his own little holding in the north had satisfied them that he would be well worth listening to--for no man rode six hundred miles on an empty errand. But they needed something more than words before they pledged the word that no Rajput gentleman will ever break.  “Find us a Cunnigan--bring him to us--prove him to us--and if a blade worth having from end to end of Rajputana is not at his service, I myself will gut the Hindoo owner of it! That is my given word!” said Alwa.  “He had a son,” said Mahommed Gunga quietly.  “True. Are all sons like their fathers? Take Maharajah Howrah here; his father was a man with whom any soldier might be proud to pick a quarrel. The present man is afraid of his own shadow on the wall--divided between love for the treasure-chests he dare not broach and fear of a brother whom he dare not kill. He is priest-ridden, priest-taught, and fit to be nothing but a priest. Who knows how young Cunnigan will shape? Where is he? Overseas yet! He must prove himself, as his father did, before he can hope to lead a free regiment of horse!”  “Then Cunnigan-bahadur's watch-word 'For the peace of India,' is dead-died with him?” asked Mahommed Gunga. “We are each for our own again?”  “I have spoken!” answered Alwa. As the biggest clan-chief left on all that countryside, he had a right to speak before the others, and he knew that what he said would carry weight when they had all ridden home again, and the report had gone abroad in ever-widening rings. “If the English can hold India, let them! I will not fight against them, for they are honest men for all their madness. If they cannot, then I am for Rajputana, not India--India may burn or rot or burst to pieces, so long as Rajputana stands! But--” He paused a moment, and looked at each man in turn, and tapped his sabre-hilt, “--if a Cunnigan-bahadur were among us--a man whom I could trust to lead me and mine and every man--I would lend him my sword for the sheer honor of helping him hack truth out of corruption! I have nothing more to say!”  “One word more, cousin!” said Mahommed Gunga. “I was risaldar in Cunnigan-bahadur's regiment of horse. There was more than mere discipline between us. I ate his salt. Once--when he might have saved himself the trouble without any daring to reproach him--he risked his own life, and a troop, and his reputation to save a woman of my family from capture, and something worse. There was never a Rajput or any other native woman wronged while he was with us.”  “Well?”  “I am no friend of Christian priests--of padres. But--”  “She who rode by just now? What, then?”  “I ride northward now, and then very likely South again. I can do nothing in the matter, yet--were he in my shoes, and she a native woman at the mercy of the troops--Cunnigan-bahadur would have assigned a guard for her.”  “Ho! So I am thy sepoy?” sneered Alwa, standing sideways--looking sideways--and throwing out his chest. “I am to do thy bidding, guarding stray padres” (he spoke the word as though it were a bad taste he was spitting from his mouth), “and herding women without purdah, while thou ridest on assignations Allah knows where? Since when?”  “I have yet to refuse to guard thy back, or thy good name, Alwa!”  Mahommed Gunga eyed him straight, and thrust his hilt out. “The woman is nothing to me--the padre-sahib less. It is because of the debt I owe to Cunnigan that I ask this favor.”  “Oh. It is granted! Should she appeal to me, I will rip Howrah into rags and burn this city to protect her if need be! She must first ask, though, even as thou didst.”  Mahommed Gunga saluted him, bolt-upright as a lance, and without the slightest change in his expression.  “The word is sufficient, cousin!”  Alwa returned his salute, and raised his voice in a gruff command. A saice outside the window woke as though struck by a stick--sprang to his feet--and passed the order on. A dozen horses clattered in the courtyard and filed through the arched passage to the street, and Alwa mounted. The others, each with his escort, followed suit, and a moment later, with no further notice of one another, but with as much pomp and noise as though they owned the whole of India, the five rode off, each on his separate way, through the scattering crowd.  Then Mahommed Gunga called for his own horse and the lone armed man of his own race who acted squire to him.  “Did any overhear our talk?” he asked.  “No, sahib.”  “Not the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/51530"],["title","The Last Letter (#1)"],["body","memories. I find myself thinking of fur-clad witch-doctors dipping long pointed sticks in bubbling black cauldrons. No wonder Pink Wastebasket couldn't take it, brave girl.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Firming himself behind his desk, he pushed a number of buttons and spoke long numbers and meaningful alphabetical syllables into several microphones. Banks of colored lights around the desk began to blink like a theatre marquee sending Morse Code, while phosphorescent arrows crawled purposefully across maps and space-charts and through three-dimensional street diagrams.  \"There!\" he said at last. \"The sender of the letter is being apprehended and will be brought directly here. We'll see what sort of man this Richard Rowe is--if we can assume he's human. Seven precautionary cordons are being drawn around his population station: three composed of machines, two of SBI agents, and two consisting of human and mechanical medical-combat teams. Same goes for the intended recipient of the letter. Meanwhile, a destroyer squadron of the Solar Fleet has been detached to orbit over NewNew York.\"  \"In case it becomes necessary to Z-Bomb?\" Potshelter asked grimly.  Krumbine nodded. \"With all those villains lurking just outside the Solar System in their invisible black ships, with planeticide in their hearts, we can't be too careful. One word transmitted from one spy to another and anything may happen. And we must bomb before they do, so as to contain our losses. Better one city destroyed than a traitor on the loose who may destroy many cities. One hundred years ago, three person-to-person postcards went through the mails--just three postcards, Potshelter!--and _pft_ went Schenectady, Hoboken, Cicero, and Walla Walla. Here, as long as you're mixing them, try one of these oval blues--I find them best for steady swallowing.\"  Bells jangled. Krumbine grabbed up two phones, holding one to each ear. Potshelter automatically picked up a third. The ringing continued. Krumbine started to wedge one of his phones under his chin, nodded sharply at Potshelter and then toward a cluster of microphones at the end of the table. Potshelter picked up a fourth phone from behind them. The ringing stopped.  The two men listened, looking doped, Krumbine with an eye fixed on the sweep second hand of the large wall clock. When it had made one revolution, he cradled his phones. Potshelter followed suit.  \"I do like the simplicity of the new on-the-hour Puffyloaf phono-commercial,\" the latter remarked thoughtfully. \"The Bread That's Lighter Than Air. Nice.\"  Krumbine nodded. \"I hear they've had to add mass to the leadfoil wrapping to keep the loaves from floating off the shelves. Fact.\"         *       *       *       *       *  He cleared his throat. \"Too bad we can't listen to more phono-commercials, but even when there isn't a crisis on the agenda, I find I have to budget my listening time. One minute per hour strikes a reasonable balance between duty and self-indulgence.\"  The nearest wall began to sing:      Mister J. Augustus Krumbine,     We all think you're fine, fine, fine, fine.     Now out of the skyey blue     Come some telegrams for you.  The wall opened to a small heart shape toward the center and a sheaf of pale yellow envelopes arced out and plopped on the middle of the desk. Krumbine started to leaf through them, scanning the little transparent windows.  \"Hm, Electronic Soap ... Better Homes and Landing Platforms ... Psycho-Blinkers ... Your Girl Next Door ... Poppy-Woppies ... Poopsy-Woopsies....\"  He started to open an envelope, then, after a quick look around and an apologetic smile at Potshelter, dumped them all on the disposal hopper, which gargled briefly.  \"After all, there _is_ a crisis this morning,\" he said in a defensive voice.  Potshelter nodded absently. \"I can remember back before personalized delivery and rhyming robots,\" he observed. \"But how I'd miss them now--so much more distingué than the hives with their non-personalized radio, TV and stereo advertising. For that matter, I believe there are some backward areas on Terra where the great advertising potential of telephones and telegrams hasn't been fully realized and they are still used in part for personal communication. Now me, I've never in my life sent or received a message except on my walky-talky.\" He patted his breast pocket.  Krumbine nodded, but he was a trifle shocked and inclined to revise his estimate of Potshelter's social status. Krumbine conducted his own social correspondence solely by telepathy. He shared with three other SBI officials a private telepath--a charming albino girl named Agnes.  \"Yes, and it's a very handsome walky-talky,\" he assured Potshelter a little falsely. \"Suits you. I like the upswept antenna.\" He drummed on the desk and swallowed another blue tranquilizer. \"Dammit, what's happened to those machines? They ought to have the two spies here by now. Did you notice that the second--the intended recipient of the letter, I mean--seems to be female? Another good Terran name, too, Jane Dough. Hive in Upper Manhattan.\" He began to tap the envelope sharply against the desk. \"Dammit, where _are_ they?\"  \"Excuse me,\" Potshelter said hesitantly, \"but I'm wondering why you haven't read the message inside the envelope.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Krumbine looked at him blankly. \"Great Scott, I assumed that at least _it_ was in some secret code, of course. Normally I'd have asked you to have Pink Wastebasket try her skill on it, but....\" His eyes widened and his voice sank. \"You don't mean to tell me that it's--\"  Potshelter nodded grimly. \"Hand-written, too. Yes.\"  Krumbine winced. \"I keep trying to forget that aspect of the case.\" He dug out the message with shaking fingers, fumbled it open and read:      _Dear Jane_,      _It must surprise you that I know your name, for our hives are     widely separated. Do you recall day before yesterday when your     guided tour of Grand Central Spaceport got stalled because the     aide blew a fuse? I was the young man with hair in the tour behind     yours. You were a little frightened and a groupmistress was     reassuring you. The machine spoke your name._      _Since then I have been unable to forget you. When I go to sleep,     I dream of your face looking up sadly at the mistress's kindly     photocells. I don't know how to get in touch with you, but my     grandfather has told me stories his grandfather told him that     his grandfather told him about young men writing what he calls     love-letters to young ladies. So I am writing you a love-letter._      _I work in a first-class advertising house and I will slip this     love-letter into an outgoing ten-thousand-pack and hope._      _Do not be frightened of me, Jane. I am no caveman except for my     hair. I am not insane. I am emotionally disturbed, but in a way     that no machine has ever described to me. I want only your     happiness._      _Sincerely_,      _Richard Rowe_  Krumbine slumped back in his chair, which braced itself manfully against him, and looked long and thoughtfully at Potshelter. \"Well, if that's a code, it's certainly a fiendishly subtle one. You'd think he was talking to his Girl Next Door.\"  Potshelter nodded wonderingly. \"I only read as far as where they were planning to blow up Grand Central Spaceport and all the guides in it.\"  \"Judas Priest, I think I have it!\" Krumbine shot up. \"It's a pilot advertisement--Boy Next Door or--that kind of thing--printed to look like hand-writtening, which would make all the difference. And the pilot copy got mailed by accident--which would mean there is no real Richard Rowe.\"  At that instant, the door dilated and two blue detective engines hustled a struggling young man into the office. He was slim, rather handsome, had a bushy head of hair that had somehow survived evolution and radioactive fallout, and across the chest and back of his paper singlet was neatly stamped: \"RICHARD ROWE.\"  When he saw the two men, he stopped struggling and straightened up. \"Excuse me, gentlemen,\" he said, \"but these police machines must have made a mistake. I've committed no crime.\"  Then his gaze fell on the hand-addressed envelope on Krumbine's desk and he turned pale.         *       *       *       *       *  Krumbine laughed harshly. \"No crime! No, not at all. Merely using the mails to communicate. Ha!\"  The young man shrank back. \"I'm sorry, sir.\"  \"Sorry, he says! Do you realize that your insane prank has resulted in the destruction of perhaps a half-billion pieces of first-class advertising?--in the strangulation of a postal station and the paralysis of Lower Manhattan?--in the mobilization of SBI reserves, the de-mothballing of two divisions of G. I. machines and the redeployment of the Solar Battle Fleet? Good Lord, boy, why did you do it?\"  Richard Rowe continued to shrink but he squared his shoulders. \"I'm sorry, sir, but I just had to. I just had to get in touch with Jane Dough.\"  \"A girl from another hive? A girl you'd merely gazed at because a guide happened to blow a fuse?\" Krumbine stood up, shaking an angry finger. \"Great Scott, boy, where was Your Girl Next Door?\"  Richard Rowe stared bravely at the finger, which made him look a trifle cross-eyed. \"She died, sir, both of them.\"  \"But there should be at least six.\"  \"I know, sir, but of the other four, two have been shipped to the Adirondacks on vacation and two recently got married and haven't been replaced.\"  Potshelter, a faraway look in his eyes, said softly, \"I think I'm beginning to understand--\"  But Krumbine thundered on at Richard Rowe with, \"Good Lord, I can see you've had your troubles, boy. It isn't often we have these shortages of Girls Next Door, so that temporarily a boy can't marry the Girl Next Door, as he always should. But, Judas Priest, why didn't you take your troubles to your psychiatrist, your groupmaster, your socializer, your Queen Mother?\"  \"My psychiatrist is being overhauled,"]]]
