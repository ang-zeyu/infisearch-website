I offered a reward of fifty dollars, and have him here safe   in jail. The persons who took him brought him to Fredericktown jail.   I wish you to write to no person in this state but myself. Kephart   and myself are determined to go the whole hog for any negro you can   find, and you must give me the earliest information, as soon as you   do find any. Enclosed you will receive a handbill, and I can make a   good bargain, if you can find them. I will in all cases, as soon as   a negro runs off, send you a handbill immediately, so that you may   be on the look-out. Please tell the constable to go on with the sale   of John’s property; and, when the money is made, I will send on an   order to you for it. Please attend to this for me; likewise write to   me, and inform me of any negro you think has run away,—no matter   where you think he has come from, nor how far,—and I will try and   find out his master. Let me know where you think he is from, with   all particular marks, and if I don’t find his master, _Joe’s dead!_    Write to me about the crooked-fingered negro, and let me know which   hand and which finger, color, &c.; likewise any mark the fellow has   who says he got away from the negro-buyer, with his height and   color, or any other you think has run off.    Give my respects to your partner, and be sure you write to no person   but myself. If any person writes to you, you can inform me of it,   and I will try to _buy_ from them. I think we can make money, if we   do business together; for I have plenty of money, if you can find   plenty of negroes. Let me know if Daniel is still where he was, and   if you have heard anything of Francis since I left you. Accept for   yourself my regard and esteem.                                                      REUBEN B. CARLLEY.    JOHN C. SAUNDERS.  This letter strikingly illustrates the character of these fellow-patriots with whom the great men of our land have been acting in conjunction, in carrying out the beneficent provisions of the Fugitive Slave Law.  With regard to the _Kephart_ named in this letter the community of Boston may have a special interest to know further particulars, as he was one of the dignitaries sent from the South to assist the good citizens of that place in the religious and patriotic enterprise of 1851, at the time that Shadrach was unfortunately rescued. It therefore may be well to introduce somewhat particularly JOHN KEPHART, as sketched by RICHARD H. DANA, Jr., one of the lawyers employed in the defence of the perpetrators of the rescue.    I shall never forget John Caphart. I have been eleven years at the   bar, and in that time have seen many developments of vice and   hardness, but I never met with anything so cold-blooded as the   testimony of that man. John Caphart is a tall, sallow man, of about   fifty, with jet-black hair, a restless, dark eye, and an anxious,   care-worn look, which, had there been enough of moral element in the   expression, might be called melancholy. His frame was strong, and in   youth he had evidently been powerful, but he was not robust. Yet   there was a calm, cruel look, a power of will and a quickness of   muscular action, which still render him a terror in his vocation.    In the manner of giving in his testimony there was no bluster or   outward show of insolence. His contempt for the humane feelings of   the audience and community about him was too true to require any   assumption of that kind. He neither paraded nor attempted to conceal   the worst features of his calling. He treated it as a matter of   business which he knew the community shuddered at, but the moral   nature of which he was utterly indifferent to, beyond a certain   secret pleasure in thus indirectly inflicting a little torture on   his hearers.    I am not, however, altogether clear, to do John Caphart justice,   that he is entirely conscience-proof. There was something in his   anxious look which leaves one not without hope.    At the first trial we did not know of his pursuits, and he passed   merely as a police-man of Norfolk, Virginia. But, at the second   trial, some one in the room gave me a hint of the occupations many   of these police-men take to, which led to my cross-examination.      _From the Examination of John Caphart, in the “Rescue Trials,”       at Boston, in June and Nov., 1851, and October, 1852._    _Question._ Is it a part of your duty, as a police-man, to take up   colored persons who are out after hours in the streets?    _Answer._ Yes, sir.    _Q._ What is done with them?    _A._ We put them in the lock-up, and in the morning they are brought   into court and ordered to be punished,—those that are to be   punished.    _Q._ What punishment do they get?    _A._ Not exceeding thirty-nine lashes.    _Q._ Who gives them these lashes?    _A._ Any of the officers. I do, sometimes.    _Q._ Are you paid _extra_ for this? How much?    _A._ Fifty cents a head. It used to be sixty-two cents. Now it is   fifty. Fifty cents for each one we arrest, and fifty more for each   one we flog.    _Q._ Are these persons you flog men and boys only, or are they women   and girls also?    _A._ Men, women, boys and girls, just as it happens.    [The government interfered, and tried to prevent any further   examination; and said, among other things, that he only performed   his duty as police-officer under the law. After a discussion, Judge   Curtis allowed it to proceed.]    _Q._ Is your flogging confined to these cases? Do you not flog   slaves at the request of their masters?    _A._ Sometimes I do. Certainly, when I am called upon.    _Q._ In these cases of private flogging, are the negroes sent to   you? Have you a place for flogging?    _A._ No. I go round, as I am sent for.    _Q._ Is this part of your duty as an officer?    _A._ No, sir.    _Q._ In these cases of private flogging, do you inquire into the   circumstances, to see what the fault has been, or if there is any?    _A._ That’s none of my business. I do as I am requested. The master   is responsible.    _Q._ In these cases, too, I suppose you flog women and girls, as   well as men.    _A._ Women and men.    _Q._ Mr. Caphart, how long have you been engaged in this business?    _A._ Ever since 1836.    _Q._ How many negroes do you suppose you have flogged, in all, women   and children included?    _A._ [Looking calmly round the room.] I don’t know how many niggers   you have got here in Massachusetts, but I should think I had flogged   as many as you’ve got in the state.    [The same man testified that he was often employed to pursue   fugitive slaves. His reply to the question was, “I never refuse a   good job in that line.”]    _Q._ Don’t they sometimes turn out bad jobs?    _A._ Never, if I can help it.    _Q._ Are they not sometimes discharged after you get them?    _A._ Not often. I don’t know that they ever are, except those   Portuguese the counsel read about.    [I had found, in a Virginia report, a case of some two hundred   Portuguese negroes, whom this John Caphart had seized from a vessel,   and endeavored to get condemned as slaves, but whom the court   discharged.]  Hon. John P. Hale, associated with Mr. Dana, as counsel for the defence, in the Rescue Trials, said of him, in his closing argument:    Why, gentlemen, _he sells agony_! Torture is his stock-in-trade! He   is a walking scourge! He hawks, peddles, retails, groans and tears   about the streets of Norfolk!

William Jay, of New York:                                        _Halifax, N. C., Nov. 16, 1839._    DEAR SIR: I have shipped in the brig Addison,—prices are below:                      No. 1.

Delia Averit,     475.00    The two girls that cost $650 and $625 were bought before I shipped   my first. I have a great many negroes offered to me, but I will not   pay the prices they ask, for I know they will come down. I have no   opposition in market. I will wait until I hear from you before I   buy, and then I can judge what I must pay. Goodwin will send you the   bill of lading for my negroes, as he shipped them with his own.   Write often, as the times are critical, and it depends on the prices   you get to govern me in buying. Yours, &c.,                                                           G. W. BARNES.

Nine   days before, namely, 7th Nov., Mr. Barnes advised Mr. Freeman of   having shipped a lot of forty-three men and women. Mr. Freeman,   informing one of his correspondents of the state of the market,   writes (_Sunday_, 21st Sept., 1839), “I bought a boy yesterday,   sixteen years old, and likely, _weighing_ one hundred and ten   pounds, at $700. I sold a likely girl, twelve years old, at $500. I   bought a man yesterday, twenty years old, six feet high, at $820;   one _to-day_, twenty-four years old, at $850, black and sleek as a   mole.”  The writer has drawn in this work only one class of the negro-traders. There are all varieties of them, up to the great wholesale purchasers, who keep their large"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/54812"],["title","A Key to Uncle Tom's Cabin (#2)"],["body","-houses; who are gentlemanly in manners and courteous in address; who, in many respects, often perform actions of real generosity; who consider slavery a very great evil, and hope the country will at some time be delivered from it, but who think that so long as clergyman and layman, saint and sinner, are all agreed in the propriety and necessity of slave-holding, it is better that the necessary trade in the article be conducted by men of humanity and decency, than by swearing, brutal men, of the Tom Loker school. These men are exceedingly sensitive with regard to what they consider the injustice of the world in excluding them from good society, simply because they undertake to supply a demand in the community which the bar, the press and the pulpit, all pronounce to be a proper one. In this respect, society certainly imitates the unreasonableness of the ancient Egyptians, who employed a certain class of men to prepare dead bodies for embalming, but flew at them with sticks and stones the moment the operation was over, on account of the sacrilegious liberty which they had taken. If there is an ill-used class of men in the world, it is certainly the slave-traders; for, if there is no harm in the institution of slavery,—if it is a divinely-appointed and honorable one, like civil government and the family state, and like other species of property relation,—then there is no earthly reason why a man may not as innocently be a slave-trader as any other kind of trader.                                   CHAPTER III.                           MR. AND MRS. SHELBY.   It was the design of the writer, in delineating the domestic arrangements of Mr. and Mrs. Shelby, to show a picture of the fairest side of slave-life, where easy indulgence and good-natured forbearance are tempered by just discipline and religious instruction, skilfully and judiciously imparted.  The writer did not come to her task without reading much upon both sides of the question, and making a particular effort to collect all the most favorable representations of slavery which she could obtain. And, as the reader may have a curiosity to examine some of the documents, the writer will present them quite at large. There is no kind of danger to the world in letting the very fairest side of slavery be seen; in fact, the horrors and barbarities which are necessarily inherent in it are so terrible that one stands absolutely in need of all the comfort which can be gained from incidents like the subjoined, to save them from utter despair of human nature. The first account is from Mr. J. K. Paulding’s Letters on Slavery; and is a letter from a Virginia planter, whom we should judge, from his style, to be a very amiable, agreeable man, and who probably describes very fairly the state of things on his own domain.    DEAR SIR: As regards the first query, which relates to the “rights   and duties of the slave,” I do not know how extensive a view of this   branch of the subject is contemplated. In its simplest aspect, as   understood and acted on in Virginia, I should say that the slave is   entitled to an abundance of good plain food; to coarse but   comfortable apparel; to a warm but humble dwelling; to protection   when well, and to succor when sick; and, in return, that it is his   duty to render to his master all the service he can consistently   with perfect health, and to behave submissively and honestly. Other   remarks suggest themselves, but they will be more appropriately   introduced under different heads.    2d. “The domestic relations of master and slave.”—These relations   are much misunderstood by many persons at the North, who regard the   terms as synonymous with oppressor and oppressed. Nothing can be   further from the fact. The condition of the negroes in this state   has been greatly ameliorated. The proprietors were formerly fewer   and richer than at present. Distant quarters were often kept up to   support the aristocratic mansion. They were rarely visited by their   owners; and heartless overseers, frequently changed, were employed   to manage them for a share of the crop. These men scourged the land,   and sometimes the slaves. Their tenure was but for a year, and of   course they made the most of their brief authority. Owing to the   influence of our institutions, property has become subdivided, and   most persons live on or near their estates. There are exceptions, to   be sure, and particularly among wealthy gentlemen in the towns; but   these last are almost all enlightened and humane, and alike liberal   to the soil and to the slave who cultivates it. I could point out   some noble instances of patriotic and spirited improvement among   them. But, to return to the resident proprietors: most of them have   been raised on the estates; from the older negroes they have   received in infancy numberless acts of kindness; the younger ones   have not unfrequently been their playmates (not the most suitable, I   admit), and much good-will is thus generated on both sides. In   addition to this, most men feel attached to their property; and this   attachment is stronger in the case of persons than of things. I know   it, and feel it. It is true, there are harsh masters; but there are   also bad husbands and bad fathers. They are all exceptions to the   rule, not the rule itself. Shall we therefore condemn in the gross   those relations, and the rights and authority they imply, from their   occasional abuse? I could mention many instances of strong   attachment on the part of the slave, but will only adduce one or   two, of which I have been the object. It became a question whether a   faithful servant, bred up with me from boyhood, should give up his   master or his wife and children, to whom he was affectionately   attached, and most attentive and kind. The trial was a severe one,   but he determined to break those tender ties and remain with me. I   left it entirely to his discretion, though I would not, from   considerations of interest, have taken for him quadruple the price I   should probably have obtained. Fortunately, in the sequel, I was   enabled to purchase his family, with the exception of a daughter,   happily situated; and nothing but death shall henceforth part them.   Were it put to the test, I am convinced that many masters would   receive this striking proof of devotion. A gentleman but a day or   two since informed me of a similar, and even stronger case, afforded   by one of his slaves. As the reward of assiduous and delicate   attention to a venerated parent, in her last illness, I proposed to   purchase and liberate a healthy and intelligent woman, about thirty   years of age, the best nurse, and, in all respects, one of the best   servants in the state, of which I was only part owner; but she   declined to leave the family, and has been since rather better than   free. I shall be excused for stating a ludicrous case I heard of   some time ago:—A favorite and indulged servant requested his master   to sell him to another gentleman. His master refused to do so, but   told him he was at perfect liberty to go to the North, if he were   not already free enough. After a while he repeated the request; and,   on being urged to give an explanation of his singular conduct, told   his master that he considered himself consumptive, and would soon   die; and he thought Mr. B—— was better able to bear the loss than   his master. He was sent to a medicinal spring and recovered his   health, if, indeed, he had ever lost it, of which his master had   been unapprised. It may not be amiss to describe my deportment   towards my servants, whom I endeavor to render happy while I make   them profitable. I never turn a deaf ear, but listen patiently to   their communications. I chat familiarly with those who have passed   service, or have not begun to render it. With the others I observe a   more prudent reserve, but I encourage all to approach me without   awe. I hardly ever go to town without having commissions to execute   for some of them; and think they prefer to employ me, from a belief   that, if their money should not quite hold out, I would add a little   to it; and I not unfrequently do, in order to get a better article.   The relation between myself and my slaves is decidedly friendly. I   keep up pretty exact discipline, mingled with kindness, and hardly   ever lose property by thievish, or labor by runaway slaves. I never   lock the outer doors of my house. It is done, but done by the   servants; and I rarely bestow a thought on the matter. I leave home   periodically for two months, and commit the dwelling-house, plate,   and other valuables, to the servants, without even an enumeration of   the articles.    3d. “The duration of the labor of the slave.”—The day is usually   considered long enough. Employment at night is not exacted by me,   except to shell corn once a week for their own consumption, and on a   few other extraordinary occasions. _The people_, as we generally   call them, are required to leave their houses at daybreak, and to   work until dark, with the intermission of half an hour to an hour at   breakfast, and one to two hours at dinner, according to the season   and sort of work. In this respect I suppose our negroes will bear a   favorable comparison with any laborers whatever.    4th. “The liberty usually allowed the slave,—his holidays and   amusements, and the way in which they usually spend their evenings   and holidays.”—They are prohibited from going off the estate without   first obtaining leave; though they often transgress, and with   impunity, except in flagrant cases. Those who have wives on other   plantations visit them on certain specified nights, and have an   allowance of time for going and returning, proportioned to the   distance. My negroes are permitted, and, indeed, encouraged, to   raise as many ducks and chickens as they can; to cultivate   vegetables for their own use, and a patch of corn for "]]]
