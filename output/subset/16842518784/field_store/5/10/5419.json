Kinglake: A Biographical and Literary Study (#2)"],["body","as irritation in the taunt.  “A graceful Preface to ‘Eothen,’” wrote to me a now famous lady who as a girl had known Mrs. Procter well, “made friendly company yesterday to a lonely meal, and brought back memories of Mr. Kinglake’s kind spoiling of a raw young woman, and of the wit, the egregious vanity, the coarseness, the kindness, of that hard old worldling our Lady of Bitterness.”  In the presence of one man, Tennyson, she laid aside her shrewishness: “talking with Alfred Tennyson lifts me out of the earth earthy; a visit to Farringford is like a retreat to the religious.”  A celebrity in London for fifty years, she died, witty and vigorous to the last, in 1888.  “You and I and Mr. Kinglake,” she says to Lord Houghton, “are all that are left of the goodly band that used to come to St. John’s Wood; Eliot Warburton, Motley, Adelaide, Count de Verg, Chorley, Sir Edwin Landseer, my husband.”  “I never could write a book,” she tells him in another letter, “and one strong reason for not doing so was the idea of some few seeing how poor it was.  Venables was one of the few; I need not say that you were one, and Kinglake.”  Kinglake was called to the Chancery Bar, and practised apparently with no great success.  He believed that his reputation as a writer stood in his way.  When, in 1845, poor Hood’s friends were helping him by gratuitous articles in his magazine, “Hood’s Own,” Kinglake wrote to Monckton Milnes refusing to contribute.  He will send £10 to buy an article from some competent writer, but will not himself write.  “It would be seriously injurious to me if the author of ‘Eothen’ were _affichéd_ as contributing to a magazine.  My frailty in publishing a book has, I fear, already hurt me in my profession, and a small sin of this kind would bring on me still deeper disgrace with the solicitors.”  Twice at least in these early years he travelled.  “Mr. Kinglake,” writes Mrs. Procter in 1843, “is in Switzerland, reading Rousseau.”  And in the following year we hear of him in Algeria, accompanying St. Arnaud in his campaign against the Arabs.  The mingled interest and horror inspired in him by this extra-ordinary man finds expression in his “Invasion of the Crimea” (ii. 157).  A few, a very few survivors, still remember his appearance and manners in the forties.  The eminent husband of a lady, now passed away, who in her lifetime gave Sunday dinners at which Kinglake was always present, speaks of him as _sensitive_, quiet in the presence of noisy people, of Brookfield and the overpowering Bernal Osborne; liking their company, but never saying anything worthy of remembrance.  A popular old statesman, still active in the House of Commons, recalls meeting him at Palmerston, Lord Harrington’s seat, where was assembled a party in honour of Madame Guiccioli and her second husband, the Marquis de Boissy, and tells me that he attached himself to ladies, not to gentlemen, nor ever joined in general tattle.  Like many other famous men, he passed through a period of shyness, which yielded to women’s tactfulness only.  From the first they appreciated him; “if you were as gentle as your friend Kinglake,” writes Mrs. Norton reproachfully to Hayward in the sulks.  Another coæval of those days calls him handsome—an epithet I should hardly apply to him later—slight, not tall, sharp featured, with dark hair well tended, always modishly dressed after the fashion of the thirties, the fashion of Bulwer’s exquisites, or of H. K. Browne’s “Nicholas Nickleby” illustrations; leaving on all who saw him an impression of great personal distinction, yet with an air of youthful _abandon_ which never quite left him: “He was pale, small, and delicate in appearance,” says Mrs. Simpson, Nassau Senior’s daughter, who knew him to the end of his life; while Mrs. Andrew Crosse, his friend in the Crimean decade, cites his finely chiselled features and intellectual brow, “a complexion bloodless with the pallor not of ill-health, but of an old Greek bust.”     CHAPTER II “EOTHEN”   “EOTHEN” appeared in 1844.  Twice, Kinglake tells us, he had essayed the story of his travels, twice abandoned it under a sense of strong disinclination to write.  A third attempt was induced by an entreaty from his friend Eliot Warburton, himself projecting an Eastern tour; and to Warburton in a characteristic preface the narrative is addressed.  The book, when finished, went the round of the London market without finding a publisher.  It was offered to John Murray, who cited his refusal of it as the great blunder of his professional life, consoling himself with the thought that his father had equally lacked foresight thirty years before in declining the “Rejected Addresses”; he secured the copyright later on. It was published in the end by a personal friend, Ollivier, of Pall Mall, Kinglake paying £50 to cover risk of loss; even worse terms than were obtained by Warburton two years afterwards from Colburn, who owned in the fifties to having cleared £6,000 by “The Crescent and the Cross.”  The volume was an octavo of 418 pages; the curious folding-plate which forms the frontispiece was drawn and coloured by the author, and was compared by the critics to a tea-tray.  In front is Moostapha the Tatar; the two foremost figures in the rear stand for accomplished Mysseri, whom Kinglake was delighted to recognize long afterwards as a flourishing hotel keeper in Constantinople, and Steel, the Yorkshire servant, in his striped pantry jacket, “looking out for gentlemen’s seats.”  Behind are “Methley,” Lord Pollington, in a broad-brimmed hat, and the booted leg of Kinglake, who modestly hid his figure by a tree, but exposed his foot, of which he was very proud.  Of the other characters, “Our Lady of Bitterness” was Mrs. Procter, “Carrigaholt” was Henry Stuart Burton of Carrigaholt, County Clare.  Here and there are allusions, obvious at the time, now needing a scholiast, which have not in any of the reprints been explained.  In their ride through the Balkans they talked of old Eton days.  “We bullied Keate, and scoffed at Larrey Miller and Okes; we rode along loudly laughing, and talked to the grave Servian forest as though it were the Brocas clump.” {22}  Keate requires no interpreter; Okes was an Eton tutor, afterwards Provost of King’s.  Larrey or Laurie Miller was an old tailor in Keate’s Lane who used to sit on his open shop-board, facing the street, a mark for the compliments of passing boys; as frolicsome youngsters in the days of Addison and Steele, as High School lads in the days of Walter Scott, were accustomed to “smoke the cobler.” The Brocas was a meadow sacred to badger-baiting and cat-hunts.  The badgers were kept by a certain Jemmy Flowers, who charged sixpence for each “draw”; Puss was turned out of a bag and chased by dogs, her chance being to reach and climb a group of trees near the river, known as the “Brocas Clump.”  Of the quotations, “a Yorkshireman hippodamoio” (p. 35) is, I am told, an _obiter dictum_ of Sir Francis Doyle.  “Striving to attain,” etc. (p. 33), is taken not quite correctly from Tennyson’s “Timbuctoo.”  Our crew were “a solemn company” (p. 57) is probably a reminiscence of “we were a gallant company” in “The Siege of Corinth.” For “‘the own armchair’ of our Lyrist’s ‘Sweet Lady Anne’” (p. 161) see the poem, “My own armchair” in Barry Cornwall’s “English Lyrics.”  “Proud Marie of Anjou” (p. 96) and “single-sin —” (p. 121), are unintelligible; a friend once asked Kinglake to explain the former, but received for answer, “Oh! that is a private thing.”  It may, however, have been a pet name for little Marie de Viry, Procter’s niece, and the _chère amie_ of his verse, whom Eothen must have met often at his friend’s house.  The St. Simonians of p. 83 were the disciples of Comte de St. Simon, a Parisian reformer in the latter part of the eighteenth century, who endeavoured to establish a social republic based on capacity and labour. Père Enfantin was his disciple.  The “mystic mother” was a female Messiah, expected to become the parent of a new Saviour.  “Sir Robert once said a good thing” (p. 93), refers possibly to Sir Robert Peel, not famous for epigram, whose one good thing is said to have been bestowed upon a friend before Croker’s portrait in the Academy.  “Wonderful likeness,” said the friend, “it gives the very quiver of the mouth.” “Yes,” said Sir Robert, “and the arrow coming out of it.”  Or it may mean Sir Robert Inglis, Peel’s successor at Oxford, more noted for his genial kindness and for the perpetual bouquet in his buttonhole at a date when such ornaments were not worn, than for capacity to conceive and say good things.  In some mischievous lines describing the Oxford election where Inglis supplanted Peel, Macaulay wrote      “And then said all the Doctors sitting in the Divinity School,     Not this man, but Sir Robert’—now Sir Robert was a fool.”  But in the fifth and later editions Kinglake altered it to “Sir John.”  By a curious oversight in the first two editions (p. 41) _Jove_ was made to gaze on Troy from Samothrace; it was rightly altered to Neptune in the third; and “eagle eye of Jove” in the following sentence was replaced by “dread Commoter of our globe.”  The phrase “a natural Chiffney-bit” (p. 109), I have found unintelligible to-day through lapse of time even to professional equestrians and stable-keepers.  Samuel Chiffney, a famous rider and trainer, was born in 1753, and won the Derby on Skyscraper in 1789.  He managed the Prince of Wales’s stud, was the subject of discreditable insinuations, and was called before the Jockey Club. Nothing was proved against him, but in consequence of the _fracas_ the Prince severed his connection with the Club and sold his horses. Chiffney invented a bit named after him; a curb with two snaffles, which gave a stronger bearing on the sides of a horse’s mouth.  His rule in racing was to keep a slack rein and to ride a waiting race, not calling on his horse till near the end.

It was pledged to the rescue of the Vaterland. He was sent to prison for dipping his handkerchief in the blood of Sand, beheaded for liberty at Mannheim. Afterwards he was liberated, and went to Berlin and married my mother, who died when I was young. Twice again he was in prison because the societies met at his house. We were very poor, my friend. You in America know not the meaning of that word. His health broke, and when '48 came, he was an old man. His hair was white, and he walked the streets with a crutch. But he had saved a little money to send me to Jena.  \"He was proud of me. I was big-boned and fair, like my mother. And when I came home at the end of a Semester I can see him now, as he would hobble to the door, wearing the red and black and gold of the Burschenschaft. And he would keep me up half the night-telling him of our 'Schlager' fights with the aristocrats. My father had been a noted swordsman in his day.\"  He stopped abruptly, and colored. For Stephen was staring at the jagged scar, He had never summoned the courage to ask Richter how he came by it.  \"Schlager fights?\" he exclaimed.  \"Broadswords,\" answered the German, hastily. \"Some day I will tell you of them, and of the struggle with the troops in the 'Breite Strasse' in March. We lost, as I told you because we knew not how to hold what we had gained.  \"I left Germany, hoping to make a home here for my poor father. How sad his face as he kissed me farewell! And he said to me: 'Carl, if ever your new Vaterland, the good Republic, be in danger, sacrifice all. I have spent my years in bondage, and I say to you that life without liberty is not worth the living.' Three months I was gone, and he was dead, without that for which he had striven so bravely. He never knew what it is to have an abundance of meat. He never knew from one day to the other when he would have to embrace me, all he owned, and march away to prison, because he was a patriot.\" Richter's voice had fallen low, but now he raised it. \"Do you think, my friend,\" he cried, \"do you think that I would not die willingly for this new country if the time should come. Yes, and there are a million like me, once German, now American, who will give their lives to preserve this Union. For without it the world is not fit to live in.\"  Stephen had food for thought as he walked northward through the strange streets on that summer evening. Here indeed was a force not to be reckoned, and which few had taken into account.     CHAPTER II  ABRAHAM LINCOLN  It is sometimes instructive to look back and see hour Destiny gave us a kick here, and Fate a shove there, that sent us in the right direction at the proper time. And when Stephen Brice looks backward now, he laughs to think that he did not suspect the Judge of being an ally of the two who are mentioned above. The sum total of Mr. Whipple's words and advices to him that summer had been these. Stephen was dressed more carefully than usual, in view of a visit to Bellefontaine Road. Whereupon the Judge demanded whether he were contemplating marriage. Without waiting for a reply he pointed to a rope and a slab of limestone on the pavement below, and waved his hand unmistakably toward the Mississippi.  Miss Russell was of the opinion that Mr. Whipple had once been crossed in love.  But we are to speak more particularly of a put-up job, although Stephen did not know this at the time.  Towards five o'clock of a certain afternoon in August of that year, 1858, Mr. Whipple emerged from his den. Instead of turning to the right, he strode straight to Stephen's table. His communications were always a trifle startling. This was no exception.  \"Mr. Brice,\" said he, \"you are to take the six forty-five train on the St. Louis, Alton, and Chicago road tomorrow morning for Springfield, Illinois.\"  \"Yes sir.\"  \"Arriving at Springfield, you are to deliver this envelope into the hands of Mr. Abraham Lincoln, of the law firm of Lincoln & Herndon.\"  \"Abraham Lincoln!\" cried Stephen, rising and straddling his chair. \"But, sir--\"  \"Abraham Lincoln,\" interrupted the Judge, forcibly \"I try to speak plainly, sir. You are to deliver it into Mr. Lincoln's hands. If he is not in Springfield, find out where he is and follow him up. Your expenses will be paid by me. The papers are important. Do you understand, sir?\"  Stephen did. And he knew better than to argue the matter with Mr. Whipple. He had read in the Missouri Democrat of this man Lincoln, a country lawyer who had once been to Congress, and who was even now disputing the senatorship of his state with the renowned Douglas. In spite of their complacent amusement, he had won a little admiration from conservative citizens who did not believe in the efficacy of Judge Douglas's Squatter Sovereignty. Likewise this Mr. Lincoln, who had once been a rail-sputter, was uproariously derided by Northern Democrats because he had challenged Mr. Douglas to seven debates, to be held at different towns in the state of Illinois. David with his sling and his smooth round pebble must have had much of the same sympathy and ridicule.  For Mr. Douglas, Senator and Judge, was a national character, mighty in politics, invulnerable in the armor of his oratory. And he was known far and wide as the Little Giant. Those whom he did not conquer with his logic were impressed by his person.  Stephen remembered with a thrill that these debates were going on now. One, indeed, had been held, and had appeared in fine print in a corner of the Democrat. Perhaps this Lincoln might not be in; Springfield; perhaps he, Stephen Brice, might, by chance, hit upon a debate, and see and hear the tower of the Democracy, the Honorable Stephen A. Douglas.  But it is greatly to be feared that our friend Stephen was bored with his errand before he arrived at the little wooden station of the Illinois capital. Standing on the platform after the train pulled out, he summoned up courage to ask a citizen with no mustache and a beard, which he swept away when he spat, where was the office of Lincoln & Herndon. The stranger spat twice, regarded Mr. Brice pityingly, and finally led him in silence past the picket fence and the New England-looking meeting-house opposite until they came to the great square on which the State House squatted. The State House was a building with much pretension to beauty, built in the classical style, of a yellow stone, with sold white blinds in the high windows and mighty columns capped at the gently slanting roof. But on top of it was reared a crude wooden dome, like a clay head on a marble statue.  \"That there,\" said the stranger, \"is whar we watches for the County Delegations when they come in to a meetin'.\" And with this remark, pointing with a stubby thumb up a well-worn stair, he departed before Stephen could thank him. Stephen paused under the awning, of which there were many shading the brick pavement, to regard the straggling line of stores and houses which surrounded and did homage to the yellow pile. The brick house in which Mr. Lincoln's office was had decorations above the windows. Mounting the stair, Stephen found a room bare enough, save for a few chairs and law books, and not a soul in attendance. After sitting awhile by the window, mopping his brow with a handkerchief, he went out on the landing to make inquiries. There he met another citizen in shirt sleeves, like unto the first, in the very act of sweeping his beard out of the way of a dexterous expectoration.  \"Wal, young man,\" said he, \"who be you lookin' for here?\"  \"For Mr. Lincoln,\" said Stephen.  At this the gentleman sat down on the dirty top step; and gave vent to quiet but annoying laughter.  \"I reckon you come to the wrong place.\"  \"I was told this was his office,\" said Stephen, with some heat.  \"Whar be you from?\" said the citizen, with interest.  \"I don't see what that has to do with it,\" answered our friend.  \"Wal,\" said the citizen, critically, \"if you was from Philadelphy or Boston, you might stand acquitted.\"  Stephen was on the point of claiming Boston, but wisely hesitated.  \"I'm from St. Louis, with a message for Mr. Lincoln,\" he replied.  \"Ye talk like y e was from down East,\" said the citizens who seemed in the humor for conversation. \"I reckon old Abe's' too busy to see you. Say, young man, did you ever hear of Stephen Arnold Douglas, alias the Little Giant, alias the Idol of our State, sir?\"  This was too much for Stephen, who left the citizen without the compliment of a farewell. Continuing around the square, inquiring for Mr. Lincoln's house, he presently got beyond the stores and burning pavements on to a plank walk, under great shade trees, and past old brick mansions set well back from the street. At length he paused in front of a wooden house of a dirty grayish brown, too high for its length and breadth, with tall shutters of the same color, and a picket fence on top of the retaining wall which lifted the yard above the plank walk. It was an ugly house, surely. But an ugly house may look beautiful when surrounded by such heavy trees as this was. Their shade was the most inviting thing Stephen had seen. A boy of sixteen or so was swinging on the gate, plainly a very mischievous boy, with a round, laughing, sunburned face and bright eyes. In front of the gate was a shabby carriage with top and side curtains, hitched to a big bay horse.  \"Can you tell me where Mr. Lincoln lives?\" inquired Stephen.  \"Well, I guess,\" said the boy. \"I'm his son, and he lives right here when he's at home. But that hasn't been often lately.\"  \"Where is he?\" asked Stephen, beginning to realize the purport of his conversations with citizens.  Young Mr. Lincoln mentioned the name of a small town in the northern part of the state, where he said his father would stop that night. He told Stephen that he looked wilted, invited him into the house to have a glass of lemonade, and to join"]]]
