I'm pretty ugly and I looked like a bum, but I was young. You had to grant me that.  She waved a hand at the rows of bound _News_ and left me alone with them. I wasn't sure if I was allowed to hunt up a table to lay the books on or not, so I took the volume for last year and laid it on the floor. That was the cleanest floor I ever saw.  It didn't take me long to find the story. The victim was a big man, because the story was on the second page of the Nov. 4 edition.  I started to tear the page out, then only memorized the name and home address. Somebody was sure to see me and I couldn't risk trouble just now.  I stuck the book back in line and left by the side door.         *       *       *       *       *  I went to a dry-cleaner, not the cheapest place I knew, because I wouldn't be safe with the change from a twenty in that neighborhood. My suit was cleaned while I waited. I paid a little extra and had it mended. Funny thing about a suit--it's almost never completely shot unless you just have it ripped off you or burned up. It wasn't exactly in style, but some rich executives wore suits out of style that they had paid a lot of money for. I remembered Fredric March's double-breasted in _Executive Suite_ while Walter Pidgeon and the rest wore Ivy Leagues. Maybe I would look like an eccentric executive.  I bought a new shirt, a good used pair of shoes, and a dime pack of single-edged razor blades. I didn't have a razor, but anybody with nerve can shave with a single-edge blade and soap and water.  The clerk took my two bucks in advance and I went up to my room.  I washed out my socks and underwear, took a bath, shaved and trimmed my hair and nails with the razor blade. With some soap on my finger, I scrubbed my teeth. Finally I got dressed.  Everything was all right except that I didn't have a tie. They had them, a quarter a piece, where I got the shoes. It was only six blocks--I could go back. But I didn't want to wait. I wanted to complete the picture.  The razor blade sliced through the pink bath towel evenly. I cut out a nice modern-style tie, narrow, with some horizontal stripes down at the bottom. I made a tight, thin knot. It looked pretty good.  I was ready to leave, so I started for the door. I went back. I had almost forgotten my luggage. The box still had three unwrapped blades in it. I pocketed it. I hefted the used blade, dulled by all the work it had done. You can run being economical into stinginess. I tossed it into the wastebasket.  I had five hamburgers and five cups of coffee. I couldn't finish all of the French fries.  \"Mac,\" I said to the fat counterman, who looked like all fat countermen, \"give me a Milwaukee beer.\"  He stopped polishing the counter in front of his friend. \"Milwaukee, Wisconsin, or Milwaukee, Oregon?\"  \"Wisconsin.\"  He didn't argue.  It was cold and bitter. All beer is bitter, no matter what they say on TV. I like beer. I like the bitterness of it.  It felt like another, but I checked myself. I needed a clear head. I thought about going back to the hotel for some sleep; I still had the key in my pocket (I wasn't trusting it to any clerk). No, I had had sleep on Thanksgiving, bracing up for trying the lift at Brother Partridge's. Let's see, it was daylight outside again, so this was the day after Thanksgiving. But it had only been sixteen or twenty hours since I had slept. That was enough.  I left the money on the counter for the hamburgers and coffee and the beer. There was $7.68 left.  As I passed the counterman's friend on his stool, my voice said, \"I think you're yellow.\"  He turned slowly, his jaw moving further away from his brain.  I winked. \"It was just a bet for me to say that to you. I won two bucks. Half of it is yours.\" I held out the bill to him.  His paw closed over the money and punched me on the biceps. Too hard. He winked back. \"It's okay.\"  I rubbed my shoulder, marching off fast, and I counted my money. With my luck, I might have given the counterman's friend the five instead of one of the singles. But I hadn't. I now had $6.68 left.  \"I _still_ think you're yellow,\" my voice said.  It was my voice, but it didn't come from me. There were no words, no feeling of words in my throat. It just came out of the air the way it always did.  I ran.         *       *       *       *       *  Harold R. Thompkins, 49, vice-president of Baysinger's, was found dead behind the store last night. His skull had been crushed by a vicious beating with a heavy implement, Coroner McClain announced in preliminary verdict. Tompkins, who resided at 1467 Claremont, Edgeway, had been active in seeking labor-management peace in the recent difficulties....  I had read that a year before. The car cards on the clanking subway and the rumbling bus didn't seem nearly so interesting to me. Outside the van, a tasteful sign announced the limits of the village of Edgeway, and back inside, the monsters of my boyhood went _bloomp_ at me.  I hadn't seen anything like them in years.  The slimy, scaly beasts were slithering over the newspaper holders, the ad card readers, the girl watchers as the neat little carbon-copy modern homes breezed past the windows.  I ignored the devils and concentrated on reading the withered, washed-out political posters on the telephone poles. My neck ached from holding it so stiff, staring out through the glass. More than that, I could feel the jabberwocks staring at me. You know how it is. You can feel a stare with the back of your neck and between your eyes. They got one brush of a gaze out of me.  The things abruptly started their business, trying to act casually as if they hadn't been waiting for me to look at them at all. They had a little human being of some sort.  It was the size of a small boy, like the small boy who looked like me that they used to destroy when I was locked up with them in the dark. Except this was a man, scaled down to child's size. He had sort of an ugly, worried, tired, stupid look and he wore a shiny suit with a piece of a welcome mat or something for a necktie. Yeah, it was me. I really knew it all the time.  They began doing things to the midget me. I didn't even lift an eyebrow. They couldn't do anything worse to the small man than they had done to the young boy. It was sort of nostalgic watching them, but I really got bored with all that violence and killing and killing the same kill over and over. Like watching the Saturday night string of westerns in a bar.  The sunlight through the window was yellow and hot. After a time, I began to dose.  The shrieks woke me up.  For the first time, I could hear the shrieks of the monster's victim and listen to their obscene droolings. For the very first time in my life. Always before it had been all pantomime, like Charlie Chaplin. Now I heard the sounds of it all.  They say it's a bad sign when you start hearing voices.  I nearly panicked, but I held myself in the seat and forced myself to be rational about it. My own voice was always saying things _everybody_ could hear but which I didn't say. It wasn't any worse to be the _only_ one who could hear other things I never said. I was as sane as I ever was. There was no doubt about that.  But a new thought suddenly impressed itself on me.  Whatever was punishing me for my sin was determined that I turn back before reaching 1467 Claremont.         *       *       *       *       *  \"Clrmnt,\" the driver announced, sending the doors hissing open and the bus cranking to a stop.  I walked through the gibbering monsters, and passing the driver's seat, I heard my voice say, \"Don't splatter me by starting up too soon, fat gut.\"  The driver looked at me with round eyes. \"No, sir, I won't.\"  The monsters gave it up and stopped existing.  The bus didn't start until I was halfway up the block of sandine moderns and desk-size patios.  Number 1423 was different from the other houses. It was on fire.  One of the most beautiful women I've ever seen came running up to me. What black hair, what red lips, what sparkling eyes she had when I finally got up that far! \"Sir,\" she said, \"my baby brother is in there. I'd be so grateful--\"  I grabbed for her. My hand went right on through. I didn't try grabbing her again. This time, I had a feeling I would feel her. I didn't want to be _that_ bad off.  I walked on, ignoring the flames shooting out of 1423.  As I reached the patio of 1467, the flames stopped. It was a queer kind of break. No fadeout, just a stoppage. I took a step backward. No flames this time, but the very worst and very biggest monster of them all. Coming suddenly like that, it got to my spine and stomach, even though I was pretty used to them. I stepped away from it and it was gone.  Number 1467 was different from the other houses, and it wasn't even on fire. It was on two lots, and it had two picture windows, but only one little porch and front door. I guess even the well-to-do have a hard time finding big houses and good building sites and the right neighborhood. The trouble is so many people are well-to-do and there just aren't enough old manses to go around.  I strolled up the stucco path and lifted the wrought-iron knocker, which rang a bell.  The door opened and there was a girl there. She wasn't much compared to the one I put my hand through. But she was all right--brown hair, a nice face underneath the current shades of cosmetics, no figure for a stripper, but it would pass.  \"You the maid?\" I inquired.  \"I am Miss Tompkins,\" she said.  \"Oh. Any relation to Harold J. Tompkins?\"  \"My father. He died last year.\"  \"Can I see your mother?\"  \"Mother died a few months after Daddy did.\"  \"You'll do then.\"  I stepped inside. Miss Tompkins seemed too surprised to protest.  \"I'm William Hagle,\" I said. \"I want to help you.\"  \"Mr. Hagle, whatever it is--insurance--\"  \"That's not it exactly,\" I told her. \"I just want to help you. I only want to do whatever you want me to do.\"  She stared at me, her"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/51662"],["title","Breakdown (#1)"],["body"," must be starting high....\" He stopped, because they were all staring at him, and because he couldn't remember Frances clearly. \"Just a joke,\" he said, laughing and rising. \"Let's eat. I'm starved.\"         *       *       *       *       *  They ate in the kitchen. They talked--or rather Edna, Gloria and Walt did. Harry nodded and said uh-huh and used his mouth for chewing.  Walt and Gloria went home at ten-fifteen. They said goodbye at the door and Harry walked away. He heard Gloria whispering something about Doctor Hamming.  He was sitting in the living room when Edna came in. She was crying. \"Harry, please see the doctor.\"  He got up. \"I'm going out. I might even sleep out!\"  \"But why, Harry, why?\"  He couldn't stand to see her crying. He went to her, kissed her wet cheek, spoke more softly. \"It'll do me good, like when I was a kid.\"  \"If you say so, Harry.\"  He left quickly. He went outside and across the yard to the road. He looked up it and down it, to the north and to the south. It was a bright night with moon and stars, but he saw nothing, no one. The road was empty. It was always empty, except when Walt and Gloria walked over from their place a mile or so south. But once it hadn't been empty. Once there'd been cars, people....  He had to do something. Just sitting and looking at the sky wouldn't help him. He had to go somewhere, see someone.  He went to the barn and looked for his saddle. There was no saddle. But he'd had one hanging right behind the door. Or had he?  He threw a blanket over Plum, the big mare, and tied it with a piece of wash line. He used another piece for a bridle, since he couldn't find that either, and didn't bother making a bit. He mounted, and Plum moved out of the barn and onto the road. He headed north, toward town.  Then he realized he couldn't go along the road this way. He'd be reported. Breaking travel regulations was a serious offense. He didn't know what they did to you, but it wasn't anything easy like a fine.  He cut into an unfenced, unplanted field.  His headache was back, worse now than it had ever been. His entire head throbbed, and he leaned forward and put his cheek against Plum's mane. The mare whinnied uneasily, but he kicked her sides and she moved forward. He lay there, just wanting to go somewhere, just wanting to leave his headache and confusion behind.  He didn't know how long it was, but Plum was moving cautiously now. He raised his head. They were approaching a fence. He noticed a gate off to the right, and pulled the rope so Plum went that way. They reached the gate and he got down to open it, and saw the sign. \"Phineas Grotton Farm.\" He looked up at the sky, found the constellations, turned his head, and nodded. He'd started north, and Plum had continued north. He'd crossed land belonging both to himself and the Franklins. Now he was leaving the Franklin farm. North of the Franklins were the Bessers. Who was this Phineas Grotton? Had he bought out Lon Besser? But anything like that would've gotten around.  Was he forgetting again?         *       *       *       *       *  Well, no matter. Mr. Grotton would have to excuse his trespass. He opened the gate, led Plum through it, closed the gate. He mounted and rode forward, still north, toward the small Pangborn place and after the Pangborns the biggest farm in the county--old Wallace Elverton's place. The fields here, as everywhere in the county, lay fallow. Seemed as if the government had so much grain stored up they'd be able to get along without crops for years more.  He looked around. Somehow, the country bothered him. He wasn't sure why, but ... everything was wrong.  His head weighed an agonized ton. He put it down again. Plum went sedately forward. After a while she stopped. Harry looked up. Another fence. And what a fence! About ten feet of heavy steel mesh, topped by three feet of barbed-wire--five separate strands. What in the world had Sam Pangborn been thinking of to put up a monster like this?  He looked around. The gate should be further west. He rode that way. He found no gate. He turned back, heading east. No gate. Nothing but fence. And wasn't the fence gradually curving inward? He looked back. Yes, there _was_ a slight inward curve.  He dismounted and tied Plum to the fence, then stepped back and figured the best way to get to the other side.  The best way, the only way, was to claw, clutch and clamber, as they used to say back when he was a kid.  It took some doing. He tore his shirt on the barbed wire, but he got over and began walking, straight ahead, due north. The earth changed beneath his feet. He stooped and touched it. Sand. Hard-packed sand. He'd never seen the like of it in this county.  He walked on. A sound came to him; a rising-falling whisper. He listened to it, and looked up every so often at the sky, to make sure he was heading in the right direction.  And the sand ended. His shoes plunked over flooring.  Flooring!  He knelt to make sure, and his hand felt wooden planks. He rose, and glanced up to see if he was still outdoors. Then he laughed. It was a sick laugh, so he stopped it.  He took another step. His shoes sounded against the wood. He walked. More wood. Wood that went on, as the sand had. And the roaring sound growing louder. And the air changing, smelling like air never had before in Cultwait County.         *       *       *       *       *  His entire body trembled. His mind trembled too. He walked, and came to a waist-high metal railing, and made a tiny sound deep in his throat. He looked out over water, endless water rolling in endless waves under the night sky. Crashing water, topped with reflected silver from the moon. Pounding water, filling the air with spray.  He put out his hands and grasped the railing. It was wet. He raised damp fingers to his mouth. Salt.  He stepped back, back, and turned and ran. He ran wildly, blindly, until he could run no more. Then he fell, feeling the sand beneath him, and shut his eyes and mind to everything.  Much later, he got up and went to the fence and climbed it. He came down on the other side and looked around and saw Plum. He walked to her, mounted her, sat still. The thoughts, or dreams, or whatever they were which had been torturing him these past few weeks began torturing him again.  It was getting light. His head was splitting.  Davie. His son Davie. Fourteen years old. Going to high school in town....  _Town!_ He should've gone there in the first place! He would ride east, to the road, then head south, back toward home. That would bring him right down Main Street. Regulations or not, he'd talk to people, find out what was happening.  He kicked Plum's sides. The mare began to move. He kept kicking until she broke into a brisk canter. He held on with hands and legs.  Why hadn't he seen the Pangborns and Elvertons lately--a long time lately?  _The ocean. He'd seen the ocean. Not a reservoir or lake made by flooding and by damming, but salt water and enormous. An ocean, where there could be no ocean. The Pangborns and Elvertons had been where that ocean was now. And after the Elvertons had come the Dobsons. And after them the new plastics plant. And after that the city of Crossville. And after that...._  He was passing his own farm. He hadn't come through town, and yet here he was at his own farm. Could he have forgotten where town was? Could it be north of his home, not south? Could a man get so confused as to forget things he'd known all his life?  He reached the Shanks' place, and passed it at a trot. Then he was beyond their boundaries and breaking regulations again. He stayed on the road. He went by a small house and saw colored folks in the yard. There'd been no colored folks here. There'd been Eli Bergen and his family and his mother, in a bigger, newer house. The colored folks heard Plum's hooves and looked up and stared. Then a man raised his voice. \"Mistah, you breakin' regulations! Mistah, the police gonnah get you!\"         *       *       *       *       *  He rode on. He came to another house, neat and white, with three children playing on a grassy lawn. They saw him and ran inside. A moment later, adult voices yelled after him:  \"You theah! Stop!\"  \"Call the sheriff! He's headin' foah Piney Woods!\"  There was no place called Piney Woods in this county.  Was this how a man's mind went?  He came to another house, and another. He passed ten all told, and people shouted at him for breaking regulations, and the last three or four sounded like Easterners. And their houses looked like pictures of New England he'd seen in magazines.  He rode on. He never did come to town. He came to a ten-foot fence with a three-foot barbed-wire extension. He got off Plum and ripped his clothing climbing. He walked over hard-packed sand, and then wood, and came to a low metal railing. He looked out at the ocean, gleaming in bright sunlight, surging and seething endlessly. He felt the earth sway beneath him. He staggered, and dropped to his hands and knees, and shook his head like a fighter hit too many times. Then he got up and went back to the fence and heard a sound. It was a familiar sound, yet strange too. He shaded his eyes against the climbing sun. Then he saw it--a car. _A car!_         *       *       *       *       *  It was one of those tiny foreign jobs that run on practically no gas at all. It stopped beside him and two men got out. Young men with lined, tired faces; they wore policemen's uniforms. \"You broke regulations, Mr. Burr. You'll have to come with us.\"  He nodded. He wanted to. He wanted to be taken care of. He turned toward Plum.  The other officer was walking around the horse. \"Rode her hard,\" he said, and he sounded real worried. \"Shouldn't have done that, Mr. Burr. We have so very few now....\"  The officer holding Harry's arm said, \"Pete.\"  The officer examining Plum said, \"It won't make any difference in a while.\"  Harry looked at both of them, and felt sharp, personal fear.  \"Take the horse"]]]
