From time to time also the deep roar of the king's war-lions       [See Diodorus, 1. 47.  Also the pictures of the king rushing to the      fight.]  might be heard; these beasts followed him into the fight, and were now howling for food, as they had been kept fasting to excite their fury.  In the midst of the camp stood the king's tent, surrounded by foot and chariot-guards.  The auxiliary troops were encamped in divisions according to their nationality, and between them the Egyptian legions of heavy-armed soldiers and archers.  Here might be seen the black Ethiopian with wooly matted hair, in which a few feathers were stuck--the handsome, well proportioned \"Son of the desert\" from the sandy Arabian shore of the Red Sea, who performed his wild war-dance flourishing his lance, with a peculiar wriggle of his--hips pale Sardinians, with metal helmets and heavy swords--light colored Libyans, with tattooed arms and ostrich- feathers on their heads-brown, bearded Arabs, worshippers of the stars, inseparable from their horses, and armed, some with lances, and some with bows and arrows.  And not less various than their aspect were the tongues of the allied troops--but all obedient to the king's word of command.  In the midst of the royal tents was a lightly constructed temple with the statues of the Gods of Thebes, and of the king's forefathers; clouds of incense rose in front of it, for the priests were engaged from the eve of the battle until it was over, in prayers, and offerings to Amon, the king of the Gods, to Necheb, the Goddess of victory, and to Menth, the God of war.  The keeper of the lions stood by the Pharaoh's sleeping-tent, and the tent, which served as a council chamber, was distinguished by the standards in front of it; but the council-tent was empty and still, while in the kitchen-tent, as well as in the wine-store close by, all was in a bustle.  The large pavilion, in which Rameses and his suite were taking their evening meal, was more brilliantly lighted than all the others; it was a covered tent, a long square in shape, and all round it were colored lamps, which made it as light as day; a body-guard of Sardinians, Libyans, and Egyptians guarded it with drawn swords, and seemed too wholly absorbed with the importance of their office even to notice the dishes and wine-jars, which the king's pages--the sons of the highest families in Egypt--took at the tent-door from the cooks and butlers.  The walls and slanting roof of this quickly-built and movable banqueting- hall, consisted of a strong, impenetrable carpet-stuff, woven at Thebes, and afterwards  dyed purple at Tanis by the Phoenicians.  Saitic artists had embroidered the vulture, one of the forms in which Necheb appears, a hundred times on the costly material with threads of silver.  The cedar- wood pillars of the tent were covered with gold, and the ropes, which secured the light erection to the tent-pegs, were twisted of silk, and thin threads of silver.  Seated round four tables, more than a hundred men were taking their evening meal; at three of them the generals of the army, the chief priests, and councillors, sat on light stools; at the fourth, and at some distance from the others, were the princes of the blood; and the king himself sat apart at a high table, on a throne supported by gilt figures of Asiatic prisoners in chains.  His table and throne stood on a low dais covered with panther-skin; but even without that Rameses would have towered above his companions.  His form was powerful, and there was a commanding aspect in his bearded face, and in the high brow, crowned with a golden diadem adorned with the heads of two Uraeus-snakes, wearing the crowns of Upper and Lower Egypt.  A broad collar of precious stones covered half his breast, the lower half was concealed by a scarf or belt, and his bare arms were adorned with bracelets.  His finely-proportioned limbs looked as if moulded in bronze, so smoothly were the powerful muscles covered with the shining copper- colored skin.  Sitting here among those who were devoted to him, he looked with kind and fatherly pride at his blooming sons.  The lion was at rest--but nevertheless he was a lion, and terrible things might be looked for when he should rouse himself, and when the mighty hand, which now dispensed bread, should be clenched for the fight.  There was nothing mean in this man, and yet nothing alarming; for, if his eye had a commanding sparkle, the expression of his mouth was particularly gentle; and the deep voice which could make itself heard above the clash of fighting men, could also assume the sweetest and most winning tones. His education had not only made him well aware of his greatness and power, but had left him also a genuine man, a stranger to none of the emotions of the human soul.  Behind Pharaoh stood a man, younger than himself, who gave him his wine- cup after first touching it with his own lips; this was Mena, the king's charioteer and favorite companion.  His figure was slight and yet vigorous, supple and yet dignified, and his finely-formed features and frank bright eyes were full at once of self-respect and of benevolence. Such a man might fail in reflection and counsel, but would be admirable as an honorable, staunch, and faithful friend.  Among the princes, Chamus sat nearest to the king;       [He is named Cha-em-Us on the monuments, i. e., 'splendor in      Thebes.' He became the Sam, or high-priest of Memphis.  His mummy      was discovered by Mariette in the tomb of Apis at Saqqarah during ha      excavations of the Serapeum at Memphis.]  he was the eldest of his sons, and while still young had been invested with the dignity of high-priest of Memphis.  The curly-haired Rameri, who had been rescued from imprisonment--into which he had fallen on his journey from Egypt--had been assigned a place with the younger princes at the lowest end of the table.  \"It all sounds very threatening!\"  said the king.  \"But though each of you croakers speaks the truth, your love for me dims your sight.  In fact, all that Rameri has told me, that Bent-Anat writes, that Mena's stud-keeper says of Ani, and that comes through other channels--amounts to nothing that need disturb us.  I know your uncle--I know that he will make his borrowed throne as wide as he possibly can; but when we return home he will be quite content to sit on a narrow seat again.  Great enterprises and daring deeds are not what he excels in;  but he is very apt at carrying out a ready-made system, and therefore I choose him to be my Regent.\"  \"But Ameni,\" said Chamus, bowing respectfully to his father, \"seems to have stirred up his ambition, and to support him with his advice.  The chief of the House of Seti is a man of great ability, and at least half of the priesthood are his adherents.\"  \"I know it,\" replied the king.  \"Their lordships owe me a grudge because I have called their serfs to arms, and they want them to till their acres.  A pretty sort of people they have sent me!  their courage flies with the first arrow.  They shall guard the camp tomorrow; they will be equal to that when it is made clear to their understanding that, if they let the tents be taken, the bread, meat and wines-skins will also fall into the hands of the enemy.  If Kadesh is taken by storm, the temples of the Nile shall have the greater part of the spoil, and you yourself, my young high-priest of Memphis, shall show your colleagues that Rameses repays in bushels that which he has taken in handfuls from the ministers of the Gods.\"  \"Ameni's disaffection,\" replied Chamus, \"has a deeper root; thy mighty spirit seeks and finds its own way--\"  \"But their lordships,\" interrupted Rameses, \"are accustomed to govern the king too, and I--I do not do them credit.  I rule as vicar of the Lord of the Gods, but--I myself am no God, though they attribute to me the honors of a divinity; and in all humility of heart I willingly leave it to them to be the mediators between the Immortals and me or my people.  Human affairs certainly I choose to manage in my own way.  And now no more of them.  I cannot bear to doubt my friends, and trustfulness is so dear, so essential to me, that I must indulge in it even if my confidence results in my being deceived.\"  The king glanced at Mena, who handed him a golden cup--which he emptied. He looked at the glittering beaker, and then, with a flash of his grave, bright eyes, he added:  \"And if I am betrayed--if ten such as Ameni and Ani entice my people into a snare--I shall return home, and will tread the reptiles into dust.\"  His deep voice rang out the words, as if he were a herald proclaiming a victorious deed of arms.  Not a word was spoken, not a hand moved, when he ceased speaking.  Then he raised his cup, and said:  \"It is well before the battle to uplift our hearts!  We have done great deeds; distant nations have felt our hand; we have planted our pillars of conquest by their rivers, and graven the record of our deeds on their rocks.       [Herodotus speaks of the pictures graven on the rocks in the      provinces conquered by Rameses II., in memory of his achievements.      He saw two, one of which remains on a rock near Beyrut.]  Your king is great above all kings, and it is through the might of the Gods, and your valor my brave comrades.  May to-morrow's fight bring us new glory!  May the Immortals soon bring this war to a close!  Empty your wine cups with me--To victory and a speedy return home in peace!\"  \"Victory!  Victory!  Long life to the Pharaoh!  Strength and health!\" cried the guests of the king, who, as he descended from his throne, cried to the drinkers:  \"Now, rest till the star of Isis sets.  Then follow me to prayer at the altar of Amon, and then-to battle.\"  Fresh cries of triumph sounded through the "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5448"],["title","Uarda : a Romance of Ancient Egypt — Volume 10 (#1)"],["body","painfully raised herself on her feet with the help of her stick, she found a knife and a small flask which she slipped into her dress, and then, bent and trembling, with a last effort of her remaining strength she dragged herself as far as Nemu's tent.  Here she found Uarda bound hand and foot, and Kaschta lying on the ground in a heavy drunken slumber.  The girl shrank together in alarm when she saw the old woman, and Scherau, who crouched at her side, raised his hands imploringly to the witch.  \"Take this knife, boy,\" she said to the little one.  \"Cut the ropes the poor thing is tied with.  The papyrus cords are strong, saw them with the blade.\"       [Papyrus was used not only for writing on, but also for ropes.  The      bridge of boats on which Xerxes crossed the Hellespont was fastened      with cables of papyrus.]  While the boy eagerly followed her instructions with all his little might, she rubbed the soldier's temples with an essence which she had in the bottle, and poured a few drops of it between his lips.  Kaschta came to himself, stretched his limbs, and stared in astonishment at the place in which he found himself.  She gave him some water, and desired him to drink it, saying, as Uarda shook herself free from the bonds:  \"The Gods have predestined you to great things, you white maiden.  Listen to what I, old Hekt, am telling you.  The king's life is threatened, his and his children's; I purpose to save them, and I ask no reward but this- that he should have my body embalmed and interred at Thebes.  Swear to me that you will require this of him when you have saved him.\"  \"In God's name what is happening?\"  cried Uarda.  \"Swear that you will provide for my burial,\" said the old woman.  \"I swear it!\"  cried the girl.  \"But for God's sake--\"  \"Katuti, Paaker, and Nemu are gone to set fire to the palace when Rameses is sleeping, in three places.  Do you hear, Kaschta!  Now hasten, fly after the incendiaries, rouse the servants, and try to rescue the king.\"  \"Oh fly, father,\"  cried the  girl, and they both rushed away in the darkness.  \"She is honest and will keep her word,\" muttered Hekt, and she tried to drag herself back to her own tent; but her strength failed her half-way. Little Scherau tried to support her, but he was too weak; she sank down on the sand, and looked out into the distance.  There she saw the dark mass of the palace, from which rose a light that grew broader and broader, then clouds of black smoke, then up flew the soaring flame, and a swarm of glowing sparks.  \"Run into the camp, child,\" she cried, \"cry fire, and wake the sleepers.\"  Scherau ran off shouting as loud as he could.  The old woman pressed her hand to her side, she muttered: \"There it is again.\"  \"In the other world--Assa--Assa,\" and her trembling lips were silent for ever.     CHAPTER XLIII.  Katuti had kept her unfortunate nephew Paaker concealed in one of her servants' tents.  He had escaped wounded from the battle at Kadesh, and in terrible pain he had succeeded, by the help of an ass which he had purchased from a peasant, in reaching by paths known to hardly any one but himself, the cave where he had previously left his brother.  Here he found his faithful Ethiopian slave, who nursed him till he was strong enough to set out on his journey to Egypt.  He reached Pelusium, after many privations, disguised as an Ismaelite camel-driver; he left his servant, who might have betrayed him, behind in the cave.  Before he was permitted to pass the fortifications, which lay across the isthmus which parts the Mediterranean from the Red Sea, and which were intended to protect Egypt from the incursions of the nomad tribes of the Chasu, he was subjected to a strict interrogatory, and among other questions was asked whether he had nowhere met with the traitor Paaker, who was minutely described to him.  No one recognized in the shrunken, grey-haired, one-eyed camel-driver, the broad-shouldered, muscular and thick-legged pioneer.  To disguise himself the more effectually, he procured some hair-dye--a cosmetic known in all ages--and blackened himself.       [In my papyrus there are several recipes for the preparation of      hair-dye; one is ascribed to the Lady Schesch, the mother of Teta,      wife of the first king of Egypt.  The earliest of all the recipes      preserved to us is a prescription for dyeing the hair.]  Katuti had arrived at Pelusium with Ani some time before, to superintend the construction of the royal pavilion.  He ventured to approach her disguised as a negro beggar, with a palm-branch in his hand.  She gave him some money and questioned him concerning his native country, for she made it her business to secure the favor even of the meanest; but though she appeared to take an interest in his answers, she did not recognize him; now for the first time he felt secure, and the next day he went up to her again, and told her who he was.  The widow was not unmoved by the frightful alteration in her nephew, and although she knew that even Ani had decreed that any intercourse with the traitor was to be punished by death, she took him at once into her service, for she had never had greater need than now to employ the desperate enemy of the king and of her son-in-law.  The mutilated, despised, and hunted man kept himself far from the other servants, regarding the meaner folk with undiminished scorn.  He thought seldom, and only vaguely of Katuti's daughter, for love had quite given place to hatred, and only one thing now seemed to him worth living for-- the hope of working with others to cause his enemies' downfall, and of being the instrument of their death; so he offered himself to the widow a willing and welcome tool, and the dull flash in his uninjured eye when she set him the task of setting fire to the king's apartments, showed her that in the Mohar she had found an ally she might depend on to the uttermost.  Paaker had carefully examined the scene of his exploit before the king's arrival.  Under the windows of the king's rooms, at least forty feet from the ground, was a narrow parapet resting on the ends of the beams which supported the rafters on which lay the floor of the upper story in which the king slept.  These rafters had been smeared with pitch, and straw had been laid between them, and the pioneer would have known how to find the opening where he was to put in the brand even if he had been blind of both eyes.  When Katuti first sounded her whistle he slunk to his post; he was challenged by no watchman, for the few guards who had been placed in the immediate vicinity of the pavilion, had all gone to sleep under the influence of the Regent's wine.  Paaker climbed up to about the height of two men from the ground by the help of the ornamental carving on the outside wall of the palace; there a rope ladder was attached, he clambered up this, and soon stood on the parapet, above which were the windows of the king's rooms, and below which the fire was to be laid.  Rameses' room was brightly illuminated.  Paaker could see into it without being seen, and could bear every word that was spoken within.  The king was sitting in an arm-chair, and looked thoughtfully at the ground; before him stood the Regent, and Mena stood by his couch, holding in his hand the king's sleeping-robe.  Presently Rameses raised his head, and said, as he offered his hand with frank affection to Ani:  \"Let me bring this glorious day to a worthy end, cousin.  I have found you my true and faithful friend, and I had been in danger of believing those over-anxious counsellors who spoke evil of you.  I am never prone to distrust, but a number of things occurred together that clouded my judgment, and I did you injustice.  I am sorry, sincerely sorry; nor am I ashamed to apologize to you for having for an instant doubted your good intentions.  You are my good friend--and I will prove to you that I am yours.  There is my hand-take it; and all Egypt shall know that Rameses trusts no man more implicitly than his Regent Ani.  I will ask you to undertake to be my guard of honor to-night--we will share this room. I sleep here; when I lie down on my couch take your place on the divan yonder.\"  Ani had taken Rameses' offered hand, but now he turned pale as he looked down.  Paaker could see straight into his face, and it was not without difficulty that he suppressed a scornful laugh.  Rameses did not observe the Regent's dismay, for he had signed to Mena to come closer to him.  \"Before I sleep,\" said the king, \"I will bring matters to an end with you too.  You have put your wife's constancy to a severe test, and she has trusted you with a childlike simplicity that is often wiser than the arguments of sages, because she loved you honestly, and is herself incapable of guile.  I promised you that I would grant you a wish if your faith in her was justified.  Now tell me what is your will?\"  Mena fell on his knees, and covered the king's robe with kisses.  \"Pardon!\"  he exclaimed.  \"Nothing but pardon.  My crime was a heavy one, I know; but I was driven to it by scorn and fury--it was as if I saw the dishonoring hand of Paaker stretched out to seize my innocent wife, who, as I now know, loathes him as a toad--\"  \"What was that?\"  exclaimed the king.  \"I thought I heard a groan outside.\"  He went up to the window and looked out, but he did not see the pioneer, who watched every motion of the king, and who, as soon as he perceived that his involuntary sigh of anguish had been heard, stretched himself close under the balustrade.  Mena had not risen from his knees when the king once more turned to him.  \"Pardon me,\" he said again.  \"Let me be near thee again as before, and drive thy chariot.  I live only through thee, I am of no worth but through thee, and by thy favor, my king, my lord, my father!\"  Rameses signed to his favorite to rise.  \"Your request was granted,\" said he, \"before you made it.  I am still in your debt on your fair wife's account.  Thank"]]]
