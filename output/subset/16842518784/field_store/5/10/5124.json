There were few extraterrestrial clocks because most non-humans had time sense, Michael knew, and needed no mechanical devices.  \"This,\" said Carpenter, \"is Times Square. Once it wasn't really square, but it is contrary to Nekkarian custom to do, say, imply, or permit the existence of anything that isn't true, so when Nekkar entered the Union, we had to square off the place. And, of course, install the clocks. Finest clock museum in the Union, I understand.\"  \"The pictures in my history books--\" Michael began.  \"Did I hear you correctly, sir?\" The capes of a bright blue cloak trembled with the indignation of a scarlet, many-tentacled being. \"Did you use the word _history_?\" He pronounced it in terms of loathing. \"I have been grossly insulted and I shall be forced to report you to the police, sir.\"  \"Please don't!\" Carpenter begged. \"This youth has just come from one of the Brotherhoods and is not yet accustomed to the ways of our universe. I know that, because of the great sophistication for which your race is noted, you will overlook this little gaucherie on his part.\"  \"Well,\" the red one conceded, \"let it not be said that Meropians are not tolerant. But, be careful, young man,\" he warned Michael. \"There are other beings less sophisticated than we. Guard your tongue, or you might find yourself in trouble.\"  He indicated the stalwart constable who, splendid in gold helmet and gold-spangled pink tights, surveyed the terrain haughtily from his floating platform in the air.  \"I should have told you,\" Carpenter reproached himself as the Meropian swirled off. \"Never mention the word 'history' in front of a Meropian. They rose from barbarism in one generation, and so they haven't any history at all. Naturally, they're sensitive in the extreme about it.\"  \"Naturally,\" Michael said. \"Tell me, Mr. Carpenter, is there some special reason for everything being decorated in red and green? I noticed it along the way and it's all over here, too.\"  \"Why, Christmas is coming, my boy,\" Carpenter answered, surprised. \"It's July already--about time they got started fixing things up. Some places are so slack, they haven't even got their Mother's Week shrines cleared away.\"         *       *       *       *       *  A bevy of tiny golden-haired, winged creatures circled slowly over Times Square.  \"Izarians,\" Carpenter explained \"They're much in demand for Christmas displays.\"  The small mouths opened and clear soprano voices filled the air: \"It came upon the midnight clear, that glorious song of old, from angels bending near the Earth to tune their harps of gold. Peace on Earth, good will to men, from Heaven's All-Celestial. Peace to the Universe as well and every extraterrestrial.... Beat the drum and clash the cymbals; buy your Christmas gifts at Nimble's.\"  \"This beautiful walk you see before you,\" Carpenter said, waving an expository arm, \"shaded by boogil trees from Dschubba, is called Broadway. To your left you will be delighted to see--\"  \"Listen, could we--\" Michael began.  \"--Forty-second Street, which is now actually the forty-second--\"  \"By the way--\"  \"It is extremely rude and hence illegal,\" Carpenter glared, \"to interrupt anyone who is speaking.\"  \"But I would like,\" Michael whispered very earnestly, \"to get washed. If I might.\"  The other man frowned. \"Let me see. I believe one of the old landmarks was converted into a lavatory. Only thing of suitable dimensions. Anyhow, it was absolutely useless for any other purpose. We have to take a taxi there; it's more than two hundred yards. Custom, you know.\"  \"A taxi? Isn't there one closer?\"  \"Ah, impatient youth! There aren't too many altogether. The installations are extremely expensive.\"  They hailed the nearest taxi, which happened to be one of the variety equipped with dancing girls. Fortunately the ride was brief.  Michael gazed at the Empire State Building with interest. It was in a remarkable state of preservation and looked just like the pictures in his history--in his books, except that none of them showed the huge golden sign \"Public-Washport\" riding on its spire.  Attendants directed traffic from a large circular desk in the lobby. \"Mercurians, seventy-eighth floor. _A_ group Vegans, fourteenth floor right. _B_ group, fourteenth floor left. _C_ group, fifteenth floor right. _D_ group, fifteenth floor left. Sirians, forty-ninth floor. Female humans fiftieth floor right, males, fiftieth floor left. Uranians, basement....\"  Carpenter and Michael shared an elevator with a group of sad-eyed, translucent Sirians, who were singing as usual and accompanying themselves on _wemps_, a cross between a harp and a flute. \"Foreign planets are strange and we're subject to mange. Foreign atmospheres prove deleterious. Only with our mind's eye can we sail through the sky to the bright purple swamps of our Sirius.\"  The cost of the compartment was half that of the feeding station; one credit in the slot unlocked the door. There was an advideo here, too:  \"Friend, do you clean yourself each day? Now, let's not be evasive, for each one has his favored way. Some use an abrasive and some use oil. Some shed their skins, in a brand-new hide emerging. Some rub with grease put up in tins. For others there's deterging. Some lick themselves to take off grime. Some beat it off with rope. Some cook it away in boiling lime. Old-fashioned ones use soap. More ways there are than I recall, and each of these will differ, but the only one that works for all is Omniclene from Kiffa.\"         *       *       *       *       *  \"And now,\" smiled Carpenter as the two humans left the building, \"we must see you registered for a nice family. Nothing too ostentatious, but, on the other hand, you mustn't count credits and ally yourself beneath your station.\"  Michael gazed pensively at two slender, snakelike Difdans writhing \"Only 99 Shopping Days Till Christmas\" across an aquamarine sky.  \"They won't be permanent?\" he asked. \"The family, I mean?\"  \"Certainly not. You merely hire them for whatever length of time you choose. But why are you so anxious?\"  The young man blushed. \"Well, I'm thinking of having a family of my own some day. Pretty soon, as a matter of fact.\"  Carpenter beamed. \"That's nice; you're being adopted! I do hope it's an Earth family that's chosen you--it's so awkward being adopted by extraterrestrials.\"  \"Oh, no! I'm planning to have my own. That is, I've got a--a girl, you see, and I thought after I had secured employment of some kind in Portyork, I'd send for her and we'd get married and....\"  \"_Married!_\" Carpenter was now completely shocked. \"You _mustn't_ use that word! Don't you know marriage was outlawed years ago? Exclusive possession of a member of the opposite sex is slavery on Talitha. Furthermore, supposing somebody else saw your--er--friend and wanted her also; you wouldn't wish him to endure the frustration of not having her, would you?\"  Michael squared his jaw. \"You bet I would.\"  Carpenter drew himself away slightly, as if to avoid contamination. \"This is un-Universal. Young man, if I didn't have a kind heart, I would report you.\"  Michael was too preoccupied to be disturbed by this threat. \"You mean if I bring my girl here, I'd have to share her?\"  \"Certainly. And she'd have to share you. If somebody wanted you, that is.\"  \"Then I'm not staying here,\" Michael declared firmly, ashamed to admit even to himself how much relief his decision was bringing him. \"I don't think I like it, anyhow. I'm going back to the Brotherhood.\"  There was a short cold silence.  \"You know, son,\" Carpenter finally said, \"I think you might be right. I don't want to hurt your feelings--you _promise_ I won't hurt your feelings?\" he asked anxiously, afraid, Michael realized, that he might call a policeman for ego injury.  \"You won't hurt my feelings, Mr. Carpenter.\"  \"Well, I believe that there are certain individuals who just cannot adapt themselves to civilized behavior patterns. It's much better for them to belong to a Brotherhood such as yours than to be placed in one of the government incarceratoriums, comfortable and commodious though they are.\"  \"Much better,\" Michael agreed.  \"By the way,\" Carpenter went on, \"I realize this is just vulgar curiosity on my part and you have a right to refuse an answer without fear of hurting my feelings, but how do you happen to have a--er--girl when you belong to a Brotherhood?\"  Michael laughed. \"Oh, 'Brotherhood' is merely a generic term. Both sexes are represented in our society.\"  \"On Talitha--\" Carpenter began.  \"I know,\" Michael interrupted him, like the crude primitive he was and always would be. \"But our females don't mind being generic.\"         *       *       *       *       *  A group of Sirians was traveling on the shelf above him on the slow, very slow jet bus that was flying Michael back to Angeles, back to the Lodge, back to the Brotherhood, back to her. Their melancholy howling was getting on his nerves, but in a little while, he told himself, it would be all over. He would be back home, safe with his own kind.  \"When our minds have grown tired, when our lives have expired, when our sorrows no longer can weary us, let our ashes return, neatly packed in an urn, to the bright purple swamps of our Sirius.\"  The advideo crackled: \"The gown her fairy godmother once gave to Cinderella was created by the haute couture of fashion-wise Capella.\"  The ancient taxi was there, the one that Michael had taken from the Lodge, early that morning, to the little Angeleno landing field, as if it had been waiting for his return.  \"I see you're back, son,\" the driver said without surprise. He set the noisy old rockets blasting. \"I been to Portyork once. It's not a bad place to"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/50848"],["title","Soldier Boy (#1)"],["body"," it was ended now and it was time to move.  \"We'd better get going,\" he finally said, and there was quiet. \"Lieutenant Bossio has gone on to your sister colony at Planet Three of this system. He'll return to pick me up by nightfall and I'm instructed to have you gone by then.\"  For a long moment they waited, and then one man abruptly walked off and the rest followed quickly; in a moment they were all gone. One or two stopped long enough to complain about the fleet, and the big gloomy man said he wanted guns, that's all, and there wouldn't nobody get him off his planet. When he left, Dylan breathed with relief and went out to check the bomb, grateful for the action.  Most of it had to be done in the open. He found a metal bar in the radio shack and began chopping at the frozen ground, following the wire. It was the first thing he had done with his hands in weeks, and it felt fine.  Dylan had been called up out of a bar--he and Bossio--and told what had happened, and in three weeks now they had cleared four colonies. This would be the last, and the tension here was beginning to get to him. After thirty years of hanging around and playing like the town drunk, a man could not be expected to rush out and plug the breach, just like that. It would take time.  He rested, sweating, took a pull from the bottle on his hip.  Before they sent him out on this trip they had made him a captain. Well, that was nice. After thirty years he was a captain. For thirty years he had bummed all over the west end of space, had scraped his way along the outer edges of Mankind, had waited and dozed and patrolled and got drunk, waiting always for something to happen. There were a lot of ways to pass the time while you waited for something to happen, and he had done them all.  Once he had even studied military tactics.  He could not help smiling at that, even now. Damn it, he'd been green. But he'd been only nineteen when his father died--of a hernia, of a crazy fool thing like a hernia that killed him just because he'd worked too long on a heavy planet--and in those days the anti-war conditioning out on the Rim was not very strong. They talked a lot about guardians of the frontier, and they got him and some other kids and a broken-down doctor. And ... now he was a captain.  He bent his back savagely, digging at the ground. You wait and you wait and the edge goes off. This thing he had waited for all those damn days was upon him now and there was nothing he could do but say the hell with it and go home. Somewhere along the line, in some dark corner of the bars or the jails, in one of the million soul-murdering insults which are reserved especially for peacetime soldiers, he had lost the core of himself, and it didn't particularly matter. That was the point: it made no particular difference if he never got it back. He owed nobody. He was tugging at the wire and trying to think of something pleasant from the old days, when the wire came loose in his hands.  Although he had been, in his cynical way, expecting it, for a moment it threw him and he just stared. The end was clean and bright. The wire had just been cut.         *       *       *       *       *  Dylan sat for a long while by the radio shack, holding the ends in his hands. He reached almost automatically for the bottle on his hip and then, for the first time he could remember, let it go. This was real, there was no time for that.  When Rossel came up, Dylan was still sitting. Rossel was so excited he did not notice the wire.  \"Listen, soldier, how many people can your ship take?\"  Dylan looked at him vaguely. \"She sleeps two and won't take off with more'n ten. Why?\"  His eyes bright and worried, Rossel leaned heavily against the shack. \"We're overloaded. There are sixty of us and our ship will only take forty. We came out in groups, we never thought....\"  Dylan dropped his eyes, swearing silently. \"You're sure? No baggage, no iron rations; you couldn't get ten more on?\"  \"Not a chance. She's only a little ship with one deck--she's all we could afford.\"  Dylan whistled. He had begun to feel light-headed. \"It 'pears that somebody's gonna find out first hand what them aliens look like.\"  It was the wrong thing to say and he knew it. \"All right,\" he said quickly, still staring at the clear-sliced wire, \"we'll do what we can. Maybe the colony on Three has room. I'll call Bossio and ask.\"  The colonist had begun to look quite pitifully at the buildings around him and the scurrying people.  \"Aren't there any fleet ships within radio distance?\"  Dylan shook his head. \"The fleet's spread out kind of thin nowadays.\" Because the other was leaning on him he felt a great irritation, but he said, as kindly as he could, \"We'll get 'em all out. One way or another, we won't leave anybody.\"  It was then that Rossel saw the wire. Thickly, he asked what had happened.  Dylan showed him the two clean ends. \"Somebody dug it up, cut it, then buried it again and packed it down real nice.\"  \"The damn fool!\" Rossel exploded.  \"Who?\"  \"Why, one of ... of us, of course. I know nobody ever liked sitting on a live bomb like this, but I never....\"  \"You think one of your people did it?\"  Rossel stared at him. \"Isn't that obvious?\"  \"Why?\"  \"Well, they probably thought it was too dangerous, and silly too, like most government rules. Or maybe one of the kids....\"         *       *       *       *       *  It was then that Dylan told him about the wire on Lupus V. Rossel was silent. Involuntarily, he glanced at the sky, then he said shakily, \"Maybe an animal?\"  Dylan shook his head. \"No animal did that. Wouldn't have buried it, or found it in the first place. Heck of a coincidence, don't you think? The wire at Lupus was cut just before an alien attack, and now this one is cut too--newly cut.\"  The colonist put one hand to his mouth, his eyes wide and white.  \"So something,\" said Dylan, \"knew enough about this camp to know that a bomb was buried here and also to know why it was here. And that something didn't want the camp destroyed and so came right into the center of the camp, traced the wire, dug it up and cut it. And then walked right out again.\"  \"Listen,\" said Rossel, \"I'd better go ask.\"  He started away but Dylan caught his arm.  \"Tell them to arm,\" he said, \"and try not to scare hell out of them. I'll be with you as soon as I've spliced this wire.\"  Rossel nodded and went off, running. Dylan knelt with the metal in his hands.  He began to feel that, by God, he was getting cold. He realized that he'd better go inside soon, but the wire had to be spliced. That was perhaps the most important thing he could do now, splice the wire.  All right, he asked himself for the thousandth time, who cut it? How? Telepathy? Could they somehow control one of us?  No. If they controlled one, then they could control all, and then there would be no need for an attack. But you don't know, you don't really know.  Were they small? Little animals?  Unlikely. Biology said that really intelligent life required a sizable brain and you would have to expect an alien to be at least as large as a dog. And every form of life on this planet had been screened long before a colony had been allowed in. If any new animals had suddenly shown up, Rossel would certainly know about it.  He would ask Rossel. He would damn sure have to ask Rossel.  He finished splicing the wire and tucked it into the ground. Then he straightened up and, before he went into the radio shack, he pulled out his pistol. He checked it, primed it, and tried to remember the last time he had fired it. He never had--he never had fired a gun.         *       *       *       *       *  The snow began falling near noon. There was nothing anybody could do but stand in the silence and watch it come down in a white rushing wall, and watch the trees and the hills drown in the whiteness, until there was nothing on the planet but the buildings and a few warm lights and the snow.  By one o'clock the visibility was down to zero and Dylan decided to try to contact Bossio again and tell him to hurry. But Bossio still didn't answer. Dylan stared long and thoughtfully out the window through the snow at the gray shrouded shapes of bushes and trees which were beginning to become horrifying. It must be that Bossio was still drunk--maybe sleeping it off before making planetfall on Three. Dylan held no grudge. Bossio was a kid and alone. It took a special kind of guts to take a ship out into space alone, when Things could be waiting....  A young girl, pink and lovely in a thick fur jacket, came into the shack and told him breathlessly that her father, Mr. Rush, would like to know if he wanted sentries posted. Dylan hadn't thought about it but he said yes right away, beginning to feel both pleased and irritated at the same time, because now they were coming to him.  He pushed out into the cold and went to find Rossel. With the snow it was bad enough, but if they were still here when the sun went down they wouldn't have a chance. Most of the men were out stripping down their ship and that would take a while. He wondered why Rossel hadn't yet put a call through to Three, asking about room on the ship there. The only answer he could find was that Rossel knew that there was no room, and he wanted to put off the answer as long as possible. And, in a way, you could not blame him.  Rossel was in his cabin with the big, gloomy man--who turned out to be Rush, the one who had asked about sentries. Rush was methodically cleaning an old hunting rifle. Rossel was surprisingly full of hope.  \"Listen, there's a mail ship due in, been due since yesterday. We might get the rest of the folks out on that.\"  Dylan shrugged. \"Don't count on it.\"  \"But they have a contract!\"  The soldier grinned.  The big man, Rush, was paying no attention. Quite suddenly he said: \"Who cut that wire, Cap?\"         *       *       *       *       *  Dylan swung slowly to look at him. \"As far as I can figure, an alien cut it.\"  Rush"]]]
