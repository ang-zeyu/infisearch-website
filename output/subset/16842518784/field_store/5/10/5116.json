A real eater would have let the egg slide down rapidly yet gently, without making an obvious effort. This uncontrolled, amateur speed, thought the judges, could only lead to a stomachache.  Ollie devoured the second egg, the third, the fourth, and the rest of his allotted ten. At that point, one of the judges asked, \"How do you feel?\"  \"Hungry.\"  \"Stomach hurt?\"  \"Only from hunger. It feels like it got nothin' in it. Somehow, them eggs don't fill me up.\"  Somebody in the audience laughed. The judges exchanged glances and ordered more eggs brought on. From the crowd of watchers, cries of encouragement came to Ollie. At this stage, there was still nobody who thought that he had a chance.  Ollie proceeded to go through twenty eggs, forty, sixty, a hundred. By that time, the judges and the crowd were in a state of unprecedented excitement.  Again a judge demanded, \"How do you feel?\"  \"Still hungry. They don't fill me up at all.\"  \"But those are large eggs. Do you know how much a hundred of them weigh? Over fifteen pounds!\"  \"I don't care how much they weigh. I'm still hungry.\"  \"Do you mind if we weigh you?\"  \"So long as you don't stop givin' me eggs, okay.\"  They brought out a scale and Ollie stepped on it. He weighed one hundred and thirty-nine pounds, on the nose.  Then he started eating eggs again. At the end of his second hundred, they weighed him once more. Ollie weighed one hundred thirty-eight and three-quarters.  The judges stared at each other and then at Ollie. For a moment the entire audience sat in awed silence, as if watching a miracle. Then the mood of awe passed.  One of the judges said wisely, \"He palms them and slips them to a confederate.\"  \"Out here on the stage?\" demanded another judge. \"Where's his confederate? Besides, you can see for yourself that he eats them. You can watch them going down his throat.\"  \"But that's impossible. If they really went down his throat, he'd gain weight.\"  \"I don't know how he does it,\" admitted the other. \"But he does.\"  \"The man is a freak. Let's get some doctors over here.\"  Ollie ate another hundred and forty-three eggs, and then had to stop because the restaurant ran out of them. The other contestants never even had a chance to get started.         *       *       *       *       *  When the doctor came and they told him the story, his first impulse seemed to be to grin. He knew a practical joke when he heard one. But they put Ollie on the scales--by this time he weighed only a hundred thirty-eight and a quarter pounds--and fed him a two pound loaf of bread. Then they weighed him again.  He was an even one hundred and thirty-eight.  \"At this rate, he'll starve to death,\" said the doctor, who opened his little black bag and proceeded to give Ollie a thorough examination.  Ollie was very unhappy about it because it interfered with his eating, and he felt more hungry than ever. But they promised to feed him afterward and, more or less unwillingly, he submitted.  \"Bad teeth, enlarged heart, lesion on each lung, flat feet, hernia, displaced vertebrae--you name it and he has it,\" said the doctor. \"Where the devil did he come from?\"  Ollie was working on an order of roast beef and was too busy to reply.  Somebody said, \"He's a rag-picker. I've seen him around.\"  \"When did he start this eating spree?\"  With stuffed mouth, Ollie mumbled, \"Today.\"  \"Today, eh? What happened today that makes you able to eat so much?\"  \"I just feel hungry.\"  \"I can see that. Look, how about going over to the hospital so we can really examine you?\"  \"No, sir,\" said Ollie. \"You ain't pokin' no needles into me.\"  \"No needles,\" agreed the doctor hastily. If there was no other way to get blood samples, they could always drug him with morphine and he'd never know what had happened. \"We'll just look at you. And we'll feed you all you can eat.\"  \"All I can eat? It's a deal!\"         *       *       *       *       *  The humor was crude, but it put the point across--the photographer assigned to the contest had snapped a picture of Ollie in the middle of gulping two eggs. One was traveling down his gullet, causing a lump in his throat, and the other was being stuffed into his mouth at the same time. The caption writer had entitled the shot: THE MAN WHO BROKE THE ICEBOX AT MONTE'S, and the column alongside was headed, Eats Three Hundred and Forty-three Eggs. \"I'm Hungry!\" He Says.  Zolto put the paper down. \"This is the one,\" he said to his wife. \"There can be no doubt that this person has found it.\"  \"I knew it was no longer in the alley,\" said Pojim. Ordinarily a comely female, she was now deep in thought, and succeeded in looking beautiful and pensive at the same time. \"How are we to get it back without exciting unwelcome attention?\"  \"Frankly,\" said Zolto, \"I don't know. But we'd better think of a way. He must have mistaken it for a nut and swallowed it. Undoubtedly the hospital attendants will take X-rays of him and discover it.\"  \"They won't know what it is.\"  \"They will operate to remove it, and then they will find out.\"  Pojim nodded. \"What I don't understand,\" she said, \"is why it had this effect. When we lost it, it was locked.\"  \"He must have opened it by accident. Some of these creatures, I have noticed, have a habit of trying to crack nuts with their teeth. He must have bitten on the proper switch.\"  \"The one for inanimate matter? I think, Zolto, that you're right. The stomach contents are collapsed and passed into our universe through the transfer. But the stomach itself, being part of a living creature, cannot pass through the same switch. And the poor creature continually loses weight because of metabolism. Especially, of course, when he eats.\"  \"Poor creature, you call him? You're too soft-hearted, Pojim. What do you think we'll be if we don't get the transfer back?\"  He hunched up his shoulders and laughed.  Pojim said, \"Control yourself, Zolto. When you laugh, you don't look human, and you certainly don't sound it.\"  \"What difference does it make? We're alone.\"  \"You can never tell when we'll be overheard.\"  \"Don't change the subject. What are we supposed to do about the transfer?\"  \"We'll think of a way,\" said Pojim, but he could see she was worried.         *       *       *       *       *  In the hospital, they had put Ollie into a bed. They had wanted a nurse to bathe him, but he had objected violently to this indignity, and finally they had sent in a male orderly to do the job. Now, bathed, shaven and wearing a silly little nightgown that made him ashamed to look at himself, he was lying in bed, slowly starving to death.  A dozen empty plates, the remains of assorted specialties of the hospital, filled with vitamins and other good things, lay around him. Everything had tasted fine while going down, but nothing seemed to have stuck to him.  All he could do was brood about the puzzled and anxious looks on the doctors' faces when they examined him.  The attack came without warning. One moment Ollie was lying there unhappily, suffering hunger pangs, and the next moment somebody had punched him in the stomach. The shock made him start and then look down. But there was nobody near him. The doctors had left him alone while they looked up articles in textbooks and argued with each other.  He felt another punch, and then another and another. He yelled in fright and pain.  After five minutes, a nurse looked in and asked casually, \"Did you call?\"  \"My stomach!\" groaned Ollie. \"Somebody's hittin' me in my stomach!\"  \"It's a tummyache,\" she said with a cheerful smile. \"It should teach you not to wolf your food.\"  Then she caught a glimpse of his stomach, from which Ollie, in his agony, had cast off the sheet, and she gulped. It was swollen like a watermelon--or, rather, like a watermelon with great warts. Lumps stuck out all over it.  She rushed out, calling, \"Doctor Manson! Doctor Manson!\"  When she returned with two doctors, Ollie was in such acute misery that he didn't even notice them. One doctor said, \"Well, I'll be damned!\" and began tapping the swollen stomach.  The other doctor demanded, \"When did this happen?\"  \"Right now, I guess,\" replied the nurse. \"Just a few minutes ago his stomach was as flat as the way it was when you saw it.\"  \"We'd better give him a shot of morphine to put him out of his pain,\" said the first doctor, \"and then we'll X-ray him.\"  Ollie was in a semi-coma as they lifted him off his bed and wheeled him into the X-ray room. He didn't hear a word of the ensuing discussion about the photographs, although the doctors talked freely in front of him--freely and profanely.  It was Dr. Manson who demanded, \"What in God's name are those things, anyway?\"  \"They look like pineapples and grapefruit,\" replied the bewildered X-ray specialist.  \"Square-edged pineapples? Grapefruit with one end pointed?\"  \"I didn't say that's what they are,\" returned the other defensively. \"I said that's what they look like. The grapefruit could be eggplant,\" he added in confusion.  \"Eggplant, my foot. How the devil did they get into his stomach, anyway? He's been eating like a pig, but even a pig couldn't have gotten those things down its throat.\"  \"Wake him up and ask him.\"  \"He doesn't know any more than we do,\" said the nurse. \"He told me that it felt as if somebody was hitting him in the stomach. That's all he'd be able to tell us.\"  \"He's got the damnedest stomach I ever heard of,\" marveled Dr. Manson. \"Let's open it up and take a look at it from the inside.\"  \"We'll have to get his consent,\" said the specialist nervously. \"I know it would be interesting, but we can't cut into him unless he's willing.\"  \"It would be for his own good. We'd get that unsliced fruit salad out of him.\" Dr. Manson stared at the X-ray plates again. \"Pineapples, grapefruit, something that looks like a banana with a small bush on top. Assorted large round objects. And what looks like a nut. A small nut.\"  If Ollie had been aware, he might "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/50796"],["title","Shipping Clerk (#2)"],["body","told Dr. Manson that the nut was the kernel of the trouble. As it was, all he could do was groan.  \"He's coming to,\" said the nurse.  \"Good,\" asserted Dr. Manson. \"Get a release, Nurse, and the minute he's capable of following directions, have him sign it.\"         *       *       *       *       *  In the corridor outside, two white-clad interns stopped at the door of Ollie's room and listened. They could not properly have been described as man and woman, but at any rate one was male and the other female. If you didn't look at them too closely, they seemed to be human, which, of course, was what they wanted you to think.  \"Just as I said,\" observed Zolto. \"They intend to operate. And their attention has already been drawn to the nut.\"  \"We can stop them by violence, if necessary. But I abhor violence.\"  \"I know, dear,\" Zolto said thoughtfully. \"What has happened is clear enough. He kept sending all that food through, and our people analyzed it and discovered what it was. They must have been surprised to discover no message from us, but after a while they arrived at the conclusion that we needed some of our own food and they sent it to us. It's a good thing that they didn't send more of it at one time.\"  \"The poor man must be in agony as it is.\"  \"Never mind the poor man. Think of our own situation.\"  \"But don't you see, Zolto? His digestive juices can't dissolve such unfamiliar chemical constituents, and his stomach must be greatly irritated.\"  She broke off for a moment as the nurse came past them, giving them only a casual glance. The X-ray specialist followed shortly, his face reflecting the bewilderment he felt as a result of studying the plate he was holding.  \"That leaves only Dr. Manson with him,\" said Zolto. \"Pojim, I have a plan. Do you have any of those pandigestive tablets with you?\"  \"I always carry them. I never know when in this world I'll run into something my stomach can't handle.\"  \"Fine.\" Zolto stepped back from the doorway, cleared his throat, and began to yell, \"Calling Dr. Manson! Dr. Manson, report to surgery!\"  \"You've been seeing too many of their movies,\" said Pojim.  But Zolto's trick worked. They heard Dr. Manson mutter, \"Damn!\" and saw him rush into the corridor. He passed them without even noticing that they were there.  \"We have him to ourselves,\" said Zolto. \"Quick, the tablets.\"  They stepped into the room, where Zolto passed a small inhalator back and forth under Ollie's nose. Ollie jerked away from it, and his eyes opened.  \"Take this,\" said Pojim, with a persuasive smile. \"It will ease your pain.\" And she put two tablets into Ollie's surprised mouth.  Automatically, Ollie swallowed and the tablets sped down to meet the collection in his stomach. Pojim gave him another smile, and then she and Zolto were out of the room.  To Ollie, things seemed to be happening in more and more bewildering fashion. No sooner had these strange doctors left than Dr. Manson came rushing back, cursing, in a way that would have shocked Hippocrates, the unknown idiot who had summoned him to surgery. Then the nurse came in, with a paper. Ollie gathered that he was being asked to sign something.  He shook his head vigorously. \"Not me. I don't sign _nothin'_, sister.\"  \"It's a matter of life and death. Your own life and death. We have to get those things out of your stomach.\"  \"No, sir, you're not cuttin' me open.\"  Dr. Manson gritted his teeth in frustration. \"You don't feel so much pain now because of the morphine I gave you. But it's going to wear off in a few minutes and then you'll be in agony again. You'll have to let us operate.\"  \"No, sir,\" repeated Ollie stubbornly. \"You're not cuttin' me open.\"  And then he almost leaped from his bed. His already distended stomach seemed to swell outward, and before the astonished eyes of doctor and nurse, a strange new bump appeared.  \"Help!\" yelled Ollie.  \"That's exactly what we're trying to do,\" said Dr. Manson angrily. \"Only you won't let us. Now sign that paper, man, and stop your nonsense.\"  Ollie groaned and signed. The next moment he was being rushed into the operating room.         *       *       *       *       *  The morphine was wearing off rapidly, and he lay, still groaning, on the table. From the ceiling, bright lights beat down upon him. Near his head the anesthetist stood with his cone of sleep poised in readiness. At one side a happy Dr. Manson was slipping rubber gloves on his antiseptic hands, while the attentive nurses and assistants waited.  Two interns were standing near the doorway. One of them, Zolto, said softly, \"We may have to use violence after all. They must not find it.\"  \"I should have given him a third tablet,\" said Pojim, the other intern, regretfully. \"Who would have suspected that the action would be so slow?\"  They fell silent. Zolto slipped a hand into his pocket and grasped the weapon, the one he had hoped he wouldn't have to use.  Dr. Manson nodded curtly and said, \"Anesthetic.\"  And then, as the anesthetist bent forward, it happened. Ollie's uncovered stomach, lying there in wait for the knife, seemed to heave and boil. Ollie shrieked and, as the assembled medicos watched in dazed fascination, the knobs and bumps smoothed out. The whole stomach began to shrink, like a cake falling in when some one has slammed the oven door. The pandigestive tablets had finally acted.  Ollie sat up. He forgot that he was wearing the skimpy and shameless nightgown, forgot, too, that he had a roomful of spectators. He pushed away the anesthetist who tried to stop him.  \"I feel fine,\" he said.  \"Lie down,\" ordered Dr. Manson sternly. \"We're going to operate and find out what's wrong with you.\"  \"You're not cuttin' into me,\" said Ollie. He swung his feet to the floor and stood up. \"There ain't nothin' wrong with me. I feel wonderful. For the first time in my life I ain't hungry, and I'm spoilin' for trouble. Don't nobody try to stop me.\"  He started to march across the floor, pushing his way through the protesting doctors.  \"This way,\" said one of the interns near the door. \"We'll get your clothes.\" Ollie looked at her in suspicion, but she went on, \"Remember? I'm the one who gave you the tablets to make the pain go away.\"  \"They sure worked,\" said Ollie happily, and allowed himself to be led along.  He heard the uproar behind him, but he paid no attention. Whatever they wanted, he was getting out of here, fast. There might have been trouble, but at a critical point the public address system swung into operation, thanks to the foresight of his intern friends, who had rigged up a special portable attachment to the microphone. It started calling Dr. Manson, calling Dr. Kolanyi, calling Dr. Pumber, and all the others.  In the confusion, Ollie escaped and found himself, for the first time in his life, a passenger in a taxicab. With him were the two friendly interns, no longer in white.  \"Just in case any more of those lumps appear in your stomach,\" said the female, \"you'd better take another couple of tablets.\"  She was so persuasive that Ollie put up only token resistance. The tablets went down his stomach, and then he settled back to enjoy the cab ride. It was only later that he wondered where they were taking him. By that time, he was too sleepy to wonder very much.  With the aid of the first two tablets, he had digested the equivalent of a tremendous meal. The blood coursed merrily in his veins and arteries, and he had a warm sensation of well-being.  As the taxi sped along, his eyes closed.         *       *       *       *       *  \"You transmitted the message in one of the latter tablets?\" asked Zolto in their native tongue.  \"I have explained all that has happened,\" replied his wife. \"They will stop sending food and wait for other directives.\"  \"Good. Now we'll have to get the transfer out of him as soon as possible. We ourselves can operate and he will never be the wiser.\"  \"I wonder,\" said Pojim. \"Once we have the transfer, it will only be a nuisance to us. We'll have to guard it carefully and be in continual fear of losing it. Perhaps it would be more sensible to leave it inside him.\"  \"Inside him? Pojim, my sweet, have you taken leave of your senses?\"  \"Not at all. It is easier to guard a man than a tiny object. I took a look at one of the X-ray plates, and it is clear that the transfer switch has adhered to his stomach. It will remain there indefinitely. Suppose we focus a transpositor on that stomach of his. Then, as the objects we want arrive from our own universe in their collapsed condition, we can transpose them into our laboratory, enlarge them, and send them off to Aldebaran, where they are needed.\"  \"But suppose that he and that stomach of his move around!\"  \"He will stay in one place if we treat him well. Don't you see, Zolto? He is a creature who has always lacked food. We shall supply him such food as his own kind have never dreamed of, complete with pandigestion fluid. At the same time, we shall set him to doing light work in order to keep him busy. Much of his task will involve studying and improving himself. And at night we shall receive the things we need from our own universe.\"  \"And when we have enough to supply the colony on Aldebaran II?\"  \"Then it will be time enough to remove the transfer switch.\"  Zolto laughed. It was a laugh that would have been curiously out of place in a human being, and if the taxi driver hadn't been so busy steering his way through traffic, he would have turned around to look. Pojim sensed the danger, and held up a warning finger.  Zolto subsided. \"You have remarkable ideas, my wife. Still, I see no reason why this should not work. Let us try it.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Ollie awoke to a new life. He was feeling better than he had ever felt in his entire miserable existence. The two interns who had come along with him had been transformed magically into a kindly lady and gentleman, who wished to hire him to do easy work at an excellent salary. Ollie let"]]]
