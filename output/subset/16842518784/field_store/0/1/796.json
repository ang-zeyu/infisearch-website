I was shortly again at the castle, and the Princess gave me her hand to kiss and then brought her children, the young princes and princesses, and we played together, as if we had known each other for years.  Those were happy days when, after school--for I was now attending school--I could go to the castle and play.  We had everything the heart could wish.  I found playthings there which my mother had shown me in the shop-windows, and which were so dear, she told me, that poor people could live a whole week on what they cost.  When I begged the Princess' permission to take them home and show them to my mother, she was perfectly willing.  I could turn over and over and look for hours at a time at beautiful picture books, which I had seen in the book stores with my father, but which were made only for very good children.  Everything which belonged to the young princes belonged also to me--so I thought, at least.  Furthermore, I was not only allowed to carry away what I wished, but I often gave away the playthings to other children.  In short, I was a young Communist, in the full sense of the term.  I remember at one time the Princess had a golden snake which coiled itself around her arm as if it were alive, and she gave it to us for a plaything.  As I was going home I put the snake on my arm and thought I would give my mother a real fright with it.  On the way, however, I met a woman who noticed the snake and begged me to show it to her; and then she said if she could only keep the golden snake, she could release her husband from prison with it. Naturally I did not stop to think for a minute, but ran away and left the woman alone with the golden serpent-bracelet.  The next day there was much excitement.  The poor woman was brought to the castle and the people said she had stolen it.  Thereupon I grew very angry and explained with holy zeal that I had given her the bracelet and that I would not take it back again.  What further occurred I know not, but I remember that after that time, I showed the Princess everything I took home with me.  It was a long time before my conceptions of Meum and Tuum were fully settled, and at a very late period they were at times confused, just as it was a long time before I could distinguish between the blue and red colors.  The last time I remember my friends laughing at me on this account was when my mother gave me some money to buy apples.  She gave me a groschen.  The apples cost only a sechser, and when I gave the woman the groschen, she said, very sadly as it seemed to me, that she had sold nothing the whole livelong day and could not give me back a sechser.  She wished I would buy a groschen's worth.  Then it occurred to me that I also had a sechser in my pocket, and thoroughly delighted that I had solved the difficult problem, I gave it to the woman and said: \"Now you can give me back a sechser.\"  She understood me so little however that she gave me back the groschen and kept the sechser.  At this time, while I was making almost daily visits to the young princes at the castle, both to play as well as to study French with them, another image comes up in my memory.  It was the daughter of the Princess, the Countess Marie.  The mother died shortly after the birth of the child and the Prince subsequently married a second time.  I know not when I saw her for the first time.  She emerges from the darkness of memory slowly and gradually--at first like an airy shadow which grows more and more distinct as it approaches nearer and nearer, at last standing before my soul like the moon, which on some stormy night throws back the cloud-veils from across its face.  She was always sick and suffering and silent, and I never saw her except reclining upon her couch, upon which two servants brought her into the room and carried her out again, when she was tired.  There she lay in her flowing white drapery, with her hands generally folded.  Her face was so pale and yet so mild, and her eyes so deep and unfathomable, that I often stood before her lost in thought and looked upon her and asked myself if she was not one of the \"strange people\" also.  Many a time she placed her hand upon my head and then it seemed to me that a thrill ran through all my limbs and that I could not move or speak, but must forever gaze into her deep, unfathomable eyes.  She conversed very little with us, but watched our sports, and when at times we grew very noisy and quarrelsome, she did not complain but held her white hands over her brow and closed her eyes as if sleeping.  But there were days when she said she felt better, and on such days she sat up on her couch, conversed with us and told us curious stories.  I do not know how old she was at that time.  She was so helpless that she seemed like a child, and yet was so serious and silent that she could not have been one.  When people alluded to her they involuntarily spoke gently and softly.  They called her \"the angel,\" and I never heard anything said of her that was not good and lovely.  Often when I saw her lying so silent and helpless, and thought that she would never walk again in life, that there was for her neither work nor joy, that they would carry her here and there upon her couch until they laid her upon her eternal bed of rest, I asked myself why she had been sent into this world, when she could have rested so gently on the bosom of the angels and they could have borne her through the air on their white wings, as I had seen in some sacred pictures.  Again I felt as if I must take a part of her burden, so that she need not carry it alone, but we with her.  I could not tell her all this for I knew it was not proper.  I had an indefinable feeling.  It was not a desire to embrace her.  No one could have done that, for it would have wronged her.  It seemed to me as if I could pray from the very bottom of my heart that she might be released from her burden.  One warm spring day she was brought into our room.  She looked exceedingly pale; but her eyes were deeper and brighter than ever, and she sat upon her couch and called us to her.  \"It is my birth-day,\" said she, \"and I was confirmed early this morning.  Now, it is possible,\" she continued as she looked upon her father with a smile, \"that God may soon call me to him, although I would gladly remain with you much longer.  But if I am to leave you, I desire that you should not wholly forget me; and, therefore, I have brought a ring for each of you, which you must now place upon the fore-finger.  As you grow older you can continue to change it until it fits the little finger; but you must wear it for your lifetime.\"  With these words she took the five rings she wore upon her fingers, which she drew off, one after the other, with a look so sad and yet so affectionate, that I pressed my eyes closely to keep from weeping.  She gave the first ring to her eldest brother and kissed him, the second and third to the two princesses, and the fourth to the youngest prince, and kissed them all as she gave them the rings.  I stood near by, and, looking fixedly at her white hand, saw that she still had a ring upon her finger; but she leaned back and appeared wearied.  My eyes met hers, and as the eyes of a child speak so loudly, she must have easily known my thoughts, I would rather not have had the last ring, for I felt that I was a stranger; that I did not belong to her, and that she was not as affectionate to me as to her brothers and sisters.  Then came a sharp pain in my breast as if a vein had burst or a nerve had been severed, and I knew not which way to turn to conceal my anguish.  She soon raised herself again, placed her hand upon my forehead and looked down into my heart so deeply that I felt I had not a thought invisible to her.  She slowly drew the last ring from her finger, gave it to me and said; \"I intended to have taken this with me, when I went from you, but it is better you should wear it and think of me when I am no longer with you.  Read the words engraved upon the ring: 'As God wills.'  You have a passionate heart, easily moved.  May life subdue but not harden it.\"  Then she kissed me as she had her brothers and gave me the ring.  All my feelings I do not truly know.  I had then grown up to boyhood, and the mild beauty of the suffering angel could not linger in my young heart without alluring it.  I loved her as only a boy can love, and boys love with an intensity and truth and purity which few preserve in their youth and manhood; but I believed she belonged to the \"strange people\" to whom you are not allowed to speak of love.  I scarcely understood the earnest words she spoke to me.  I only felt that her soul was as near to mine as one human soul can be to another.  All bitterness was gone from my heart.  I felt myself no longer alone, no longer a stranger, no longer shut out.  I was by her, with her and in her.  I thought it might be a sacrifice for her to give me the ring, and that she might have preferred to take it to the grave with her, and a feeling arose in my soul which overshadowed all other feelings, and I said with quivering voice: \"Thou must keep the ring if thou dost not wish to give it to me; for what is thine is mine.\"  She looked at me a moment surprised and thoughtfully.  Then she took the ring, placed it on her finger, kissed me once more on the forehead, and said gently to me: \"Thou knowest not what thou sayest.  Learn to understand thyself. Then shall thou be happy and make many others happy.\"     FOURTH MEMORY.  Every life has its years in which one progresses as on a tedious and dusty street of poplars, without caring to know where he is.  Of these years nought remains in memory but the sad feeling that we have advanced and only grown older.  While the river of life glides along smoothly, it remains the same river; only the landscape on either bank seems to change.  But then come the cataracts of life.  They are firmly fixed in memory,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14534"],["title","Christmas with Grandma Elsie (#1)"],["body","girls?\" said Max, addressing Evelyn and Rosie.  \"Yes,\" they replied, \"but a still better one at Woodburn.\"  \"When are you and Lu going to invite us again?\" asked Rosie.  \"When papa gives permission,\" answered Max, sending a smiling, persuasive glance in his father's direction.  \"It is quite possible you may not have very long to wait for that, Max,\" was the kindly indulgent rejoinder from the captain.  \"It is Rosie's turn this year,\" remarked Grandma Elsie; \"Rosie's and Walter's and mine. I want all the young people of the connection--and as many of the older ones as we can make room for--to come to Ion for the Christmas holidays, or at least the greater part of them; we will settle particulars as to the time of coming and going, later on. Captain, I want you and Violet and all your children for the whole time.\"  \"Thank you, mother; you are most kind, and I do not now see anything in the way of our acceptance of your invitation,\" he said; but added with a playful look at Violet, \"unless my wife should object.\"  \"If I should, mamma, you will receive my regrets in due season,\" laughed Violet.  The faces of the children were beaming with delight, and their young voices united in a chorus of expressions of pleasure and thanks to Grandma Elsie.  \"I am glad you are all pleased with the idea,\" she said. \"We will try to provide as great a variety of amusements as possible, and shall be glad of any hints or suggestions from old or young in regard to anything new in that line.\"  \"We will all try to help you, mamma,\" Violet said, \"and not be jealous or envious if your party should far outshine ours of last year.\"  \"And we have more than a month to get ready in,\" remarked Rosie with satisfaction. \"Oh I'm so glad mamma has decided on it in such good season!\"  \"Hello!\" cried Max, glancing back toward an intersecting road which they had just crossed, \"Here they come!\"  \"Who?\" asked several voices, while all turned their heads to see for themselves.  \"The Oaks, and the Roselands folks,\" answered Max, and as he spoke two large sleighs came swiftly up in the rear of their own, their occupants calling out merry greetings, and receiving a return in kind.  The wind had fallen, the cold was not intense, and they were so well protected against it by coats and robes of fur, that they scarcely felt it, and found the ride so thoroughly enjoyable that they kept it up through the whole morning, managing their return so that Ion was reached only a few minutes before the dinner hour.  Ion was a sort of headquarters for the entire connection, and everybody seemed to feel perfectly at home. Grandma Elsie was a most hospitable hostess, and it was a very cheerful, jovial party that surrounded her well-spread table that day.  After dinner, while the older people conversed together in the parlors, the younger ones wandered at will through the house.  The girls were together in a small reception-room, chatting about such matters as particularly interested them--their studies, sports, plans for the purchase or making of Christmas gifts, and what they hoped or desired to receive. \"I want jewelry,\" said Sidney Dinsmore. \"I'd rather have that than anything else. But it must be handsome: a diamond pin or ring, or ear-rings.\"  \"Mamma says diamonds are quite unsuitable for young girls,\" said Rosie. \"So I prefer pearls: and I'm rather in hopes she may give me some for Christmas.\"  \"I'd rather have diamonds anyhow,\" persisted Sydney. \"See Maud's new ring, just sent her by a rich old aunt of ours. I'm sure it looks lovely on her finger and shows off the beauty of her hand.\"  \"Yes, I've been admiring it,\" said Lulu, \"and I thought I'd never seen it before.\"  Maud held out her hand with, evident pride and satisfaction, while the others gathered round her eager for a close inspection of the ring.  They all admired it greatly and Maud seemed gratified.  \"Yes,\" she said, \"it certainly is a beauty, and Chess says it must be worth a good deal; that centre stone is quite large, you see, and there are six others in a circle around it.\"  \"I should think you'd feel very rich,\" remarked Lulu; \"I'd go fairly wild with delight if I had such an one given me.\"  \"Well then, why not give your father a hint that you'd like such a Christmas gift from him?\" asked Sydney.  \"I'm afraid it would cost too much,\" said Lulu, \"and I wouldn't want papa to spend more on me than he could well afford.\"  \"Why, he could afford it well enough!\" exclaimed Maud. \"Your father is very rich--worth his millions, I heard Cousin Horace say not long ago; and he knows of course.\"  Lulu looked much surprised. \"Papa never talks of how much money he has,\" she said, \"and I never supposed it was more than about enough to keep us comfortable; but millions means a great deal doesn't it?\"  \"I should say so indeed! more than your mind or mine can grasp the idea of.\"  Lulu's eyes sparkled. \"I'm ever so glad for papa!\" she said; \"he's just the right person to have a great deal of money, for he will be sure to make the very best use of it.\"  \"And for a part of it, that will be diamonds for you, won't it?\" laughed Maud.  \"I hope the captain will think so by the time she's grown up,\" remarked Rosie, with a pleasant look at Lulu; \"or sooner if they come to be thought suitable for girls of her age.\"  \"That's nice in you Rosie,\" Lulu said, flushing with pleasure, \"and I hope you will get your pearls this Christmas.\"  \"I join in both wishes,\" said Evelyn Leland, \"and hope everyone of you will receive a Christmas gift quite to her mind: but, oh girls, don't you think it would be nice to give a good time to the poor people about us?\"  \"What poor people?\" asked Sydney.  \"I mean both the whites and the blacks,\" explained Evelyn. \"There are those Jones children that live not far from Woodburn, for instance: their mother's dead and the father gets drunk and beats and abuses them, and altogether I'm sure they are very, very forlorn.\"  \"Oh yes,\" cried Lulu, \"it would be just splendid to give them a good time!--nice things to eat and to wear, and toys too. I'll talk to papa about it, and he'll tell us what to give them and how to give it.\"  \"And there are a number of other families in the neighborhood probably quite as poor and forlorn,\" said Lora Howard. \"Oh I think it would be delightful to get them all together somewhere and surprise them with a Christmas tree loaded with nice things! Lets do it, girls. We all have some pocket money, and we can get our fathers and mothers to tell us how to use it to the best advantage, and how to manage the giving.\"  \"I haven't a bit more pocket money than I need to buy the presents I wish to give my own particular friends,\" objected Sydney.  \"It's nice, and right too, I think, to give tokens of love to our dear ones,\" Evelyn said, \"but we need not make them very expensive in order to give pleasure;--often they would prefer some simple little thing that is the work of our own hands--and so we would have something left for the poor and needy, whom the Bible teaches us we should care for and relieve to the best of our ability.\"  \"Yes, I daresay you are right,\" returned Sydney, \"but I sha'n't make any rash promises in regard to the matter.\"     CHAPTER II.   In the parlor the older people were conversing on somewhat similar topics: first discussing plans for the entertainment and gratification of their children and other young relatives, during the approaching holidays, then of the needs of the poor of the neighborhood, and how to supply them; after that they talked of the claims of Home and Foreign Missions; the perils threatening their country from illiteracy, anarchy, heathenism, Mormonism, Popery, Infidelity, etc., not omitting the danger from vast wealth accumulating in the hands of individuals and corporations; also they spoke of the heavy responsibility entailed by its possession.  They were patriots and Christians; anxious first of all for the advancement of Christ's kingdom upon earth, secondly for the welfare and prosperity of the dear land of their birth--the glorious old Union transmitted to us by our revolutionary fathers.  It was a personal question with each one, \"How can I best use for the salvation of my country and the world, the time, talents, influence and money God has entrusted to my keeping.\"  They acknowledged themselves stewards of God's bounty, and as such desired to be found faithful; neglecting neither the work nearest at hand nor that in far distant lands where the people sit in great darkness and the region and shadow of death, that on them the \"Sun of righteousness might arise with healing in his wings.\"  It had been expected that the guests would stay at Ion till bedtime, but a thaw had set in and ice and snow were fast disappearing from the roads; therefore all departed for their homes directly after an early tea.  Lulu was very quiet during the homeward drive; her thoughts were full of Maud's surprising assertion in regard to her father's wealth.  \"I wonder if it is really so,\" she said to herself. \"I'm tempted to ask papa; but he might not like it, and I wouldn't want to do anything to vex or trouble him,--my dear, dear kind father!\"  An excellent opportunity for a private chat with him was afforded her shortly after their arrival at home. The little ones were fretful and Violet went to the nursery with them; Max hastened to his own room to finish a composition he was expected to hand to his father the next morning, Gracie, weary with the excitement of the day, and the long morning drive, went directly to her bed, and having seen her in it, and left her there with a loving good night, the captain and Lulu presently found themselves the only occupants of the library.  Taking possession of a large easy chair, \"Come and sit on my knee and tell me how you have enjoyed your day,\" he said, giving her a fond fatherly smile.  \"Very much indeed, papa,\" she answered, accepting his invitation, putting her arm round his neck and laying her cheek to his.  His arm was"]]]
