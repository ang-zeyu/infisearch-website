She bade me sell her bedstead and her bureau, and bring you the proceeds, to settle what she owed you. She was very anxious that I should see to it, for she felt that you had done a great deal for her; and she spoke of how often you had climbed the hill both by day and night, to visit her. So, please give me the bill, doctor, so that I may settle it at once, as I promised her.\"  \"What relatives has the child?\" asked the doctor shortly.  \"She has none at all in these parts,\" replied Gertrude. \"She has been with me all through her mother's illness, and now she is mine. Her mother's family are all gone. She might perhaps be sent to her father's parish in Bergamaskische, but I shall not do that; she belongs now to us.\"  \"I would not go there,\" said the child firmly in a low tone, clinging to Gertrude's dress with both hands.  The doctor opened a big book, tore out a leaf, and drew his pen twice across the closely written page.  \"There,\" he said, handing the cancelled sheet to Gertrude, \"that is all the bill I shall give you.\"  \"Oh, doctor, may God reward you,\" said Gertrude. \"Go, child, and thank the doctor, for you owe him a great deal.\"  The child obeyed after her own fashion. She planted herself before the big man, looked steadily at him with her great black eyes and said somewhat hoarsely,  \"Thank you.\" It sounded more like a command than anything else.  The doctor laughed.  \"She is rather alarming,\" he said, \"she is evidently not accustomed to say anything she does not really mean. I like that. But come, I must be off,\" and handing the medicine to Gertrude he left the room quickly so as to avoid her repeated thanks.  The little boy was standing where his mother had left him, still staring at the restless horse. The doctor looked kindly at the little fellow.  \"Would you like to take care of a horse?\" he asked, as he got into his wagon.  \"No, I should like to drive one of my own,\" replied the child without hesitation.  \"Well, you are quite right there: stick to that, my boy,\" said the doctor, and drove away.  As Gertrude, holding a child by each hand, climbed the hillside, the boy said gaily,  \"Say, mother, I can have one, can't I?\"  \"Do you mean to be a gentleman like the doctor, and own a horse, Dietrich?\" asked the mother.  The boy nodded.  \"So you can, if you will work hard for it, and stick to your work well. You see the doctor had to do that for a long time, and has to do it still, and if you stick to your work as he has, and never stop nor get tired till it is done, and well done, then you will be a gentleman, even if you are not a doctor. It doesn't matter what you do; you may be a gentleman if you persevere and work hard and faithfully.\"  \"Yes, with a horse,\" said Dietrich.  The little girl had been listening intently to every word of this conversation. Her black eyes blazed out suddenly as she looked up to Gertrude and said decidedly,  \"I'll be one too.\"  \"Yes, Yes, Mr. Veronica! Mr. Veronica! that sounds well,\" cried Dietrich, and he laughed aloud at the idea.  Veronica thought it no laughing matter, however. She pressed Gertrude's hand firmly and looked up with glowing eyes, as she said, \"I can be one too, can't I mother; say?\"  \"You should not laugh, Dietrich,\" said his mother kindly. \"Veronica can be exactly what you can be. If she works steadily, and does not grow tired and careless, but keeps on till her work is finished and well finished, she will be a lady as you will be a gentleman.\"  Veronica trotted along contentedly after this explanation. She did not speak again. The frowning brows were smoothed and the fiery eyes now shone with the light of childish joy as she caught sight of the first flowers that began to peep above the ground. The child's face looked fairly charming now; her well-formed features framed by the dark locks, made a beautiful picture.  Dietrich was also silent: but he was pursuing the same train of thought, for he broke out presently,  \"Will she have a horse too?\"  \"Why not, as well as you. It all depends on how steadily and how faithfully you both work,\" replied Gertrude.  \"Well, then, we shall have two horses,\" cried the boy, joyfully. \"Where shall we put the stable, mother?\"  \"We can see to that bye and bye, there is plenty of time for that. It won't do for you to be thinking about the horse all the time, you know, you must keep your mind on your work if you mean to do it well.\"  Dieterli said no more. He was busy trying to decide on which side of the house it would be best to put the stable.  That night, Gertrude again hurried down the hill to the doctor's houses and this time she brought him back with her.  Her husband's illness had taken a turn for the worse, and the next day he died.     CHAPTER II.  WITH FRESH COURAGE.   A few days later a numerous company of mourners followed another black bier to the sunny church-yard.  Steffan, the saddler, had been universally respected. He had begun life modestly; there had been no large industries in Tannenegg in his early days. He married the quiet and orderly Gertrude, who worked with him at his trade, and helped support the frugal household. Soon the flood of prosperity invaded Fohrensee, and naturally the only saddler in the vicinity had his hands full of work.  Now Gertrude's help was needed in earnest, and she did not fail. They were soon in possession of a nice little house of their own, with a garden about it, and no matter how much work she might have to do in the shop, everything in her own province of housekeeping was as well and carefully ordered as if Gertrude had no other business to occupy her time and thoughts. And Steffan, Gertrude and their little Dieterli lived simple, useful and contented lives and were a good example to all the neighborhood.  Now, to-day, Gertrude stood weeping by the window and looked across to the church-yard, where that very morning they had laid her good man. Now she must make her way alone; she had no one to help her, no one belonging to her except her two children, and for them she must work, for she never admitted for a moment that the orphaned Veronica was not hers to care for as well as her own little Dietrich.  She did not lose courage. As soon as the first benumbing effect of her sorrow had passed a little, she gazed up at the shining heavens and said to herself, \"He who has sent this trouble will send me strength to bear it;\" and in full trust in this strength she went to work, and seemed able to do more than ever.  Her property, outside of the little capital which her husband had laid by, consisted of her house, which was free from debt, and of which she could let a good part. The question was, whether she could carry on the remunerative business that her husband had been engaged in, until little Dietrich should be old enough to assume the direction of it, and pursue it as his father had done before him. Gertrude retained the services of a workman who had been employed by Steffan, and she herself did not relax her labors early and late, to oversee the work and keep all in running order.  For the first few weeks after her mother's death little Veronica sat every evening weeping silently by herself in a dark corner of the room. When Gertrude found her thus grieving, she asked kindly what ailed her, and again and again, she received only this sorrowful answer,  \"I want my mother.\"  Gertrude drew the child tenderly towards her, caressing her, and promising her that they would all go together some day to join her mother, who had only gone on before, that she might get strong and well again. And gradually this second mother grew to take the place of her own, and no game, no amusement could draw the loving child away from Gertrude's side. Only Dietrich could succeed in enticing her to go with him now and then.  The lad's love for his mother showed itself in a louder and more demonstrative manner. He often threw his arms about her neck, crying passionately,  \"My mother belongs to me and to nobody else.\"  Then Veronica's brows would knit over her flashing eyes, until they formed a long straight line across her face. But she did not speak. And Gertrude would put one arm about the boy's neck and the other about the little girl's, and say,  \"You must not speak so, Dietrich. I belong to you both, and you both belong to me.\"  In general, the two children were excellent friends, and completely inseparable. They were not happy unless they shared everything together and wherever one went, the other must go too. They went regularly to school every morning, and were always joined by two of the neighbors' children, who went with them.  These were, the son of the shoemaker, long, bony Jost, with his little, cunning eyes,--and the sexton's boy, who was as broad as he was long, and from whose round face two pale eyes peered forth upon the world, in innocently stupid surprise. His name was Blasius, nicknamed Blasi.  Often, on the way to school, quarrels arose between Dieterli and the two other boys. It would occur to one of them to try what Veronica would do if he were to give her a blow with his fist. Scarcely had he opened his attack when he found himself lying on his nose, while Dieterli played a vigorous tattoo on his back with no gentle fists. Or the sport would be to plant a good hard snow-ball between Veronica's shoulders, with the mortifying result to the aggressive boy, of being pelted in the face with handfuls of wet snow, until he was almost stifled, and cried out for mercy. Dieterli was not afraid of either of them; for though smaller and thinner than either, he was also much more lithe, and could glide about like a lizard before, behind and all around his adversaries, and slip through their fingers while they were trying to catch him. Veronica was well avenged, and went on the rest of her way without fear of molestation. If one of the other lads felt in a friendly mood, and wished to act as escort to the little girl, Dieterli soon gave him "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14627"],["title","Veronica (#2)"],["body","understand that that was his own place, and he would give it up to no one.  Every evening \"Cousin Judith\" came for a little visit, to give Gertrude some friendly advice about the children, or the household economy. She used to say that the gentle widow needed some one now and then to show claws in her behalf, and Judith knew herself to be in full possession of claws, and of the power to use them, an accomplishment of which she was somewhat proud. One evening she crossed over between daylight and dark, and entered the room where Veronica was, with her favorite plaything in her hand, moving it back and forth as she sat in the window in the waning light. She could read very nicely now for two years had passed since she had lost her own mother, and had become Gertrude's child. Many a time had she read over the motto which shone out so mysteriously from the breast of the opened rose. To-day she was poring over it again, and her absorption in \"that same old rose,\" as Dieterli called it, had so annoyed the lively lad that he left her, and had gone out into the kitchen to find his mother. When Judith saw the girl sitting thus alone, buried in thought, she asked her what she was thinking about in the twilight all by herself.  Dieterli, whom no sound ever escaped, had heard Cousin Judith come in, and came running in from the kitchen to see what was going on. Veronica looked up at the visitor and asked earnestly,  \"Cousin Judith, what is fortune?\"  \"Ah, you are always asking some strange question that no one else ever thought of asking;\" said Cousin Judith, \"where on earth did you ever hear of fortune?\"  \"Here,\" said Veronica, holding up the rose with the golden verse in the centre. \"Shall I read it to you?\"  \"Yes, do, child.\"  Veronica read--      \"Fortune stands ready, full in sight;      He wins who knows to grasp it right.\"  \"Well, it means this--I should say--fortune is whatever anyone wants the most.\"  \"Fortune is a horse, then,\" said Dietrich quickly.  Veronica sat thinking. \"But, Cousin Judith,\" she said presently, \"how can any one 'grasp fortune'?\"  \"With your hands,\" replied Cousin Judith unhesitatingly, \"You see, our hands are given us to work with, and if we use them diligently and do our work well, as it ought to be done, then fortune comes to us; so don't you see we 'grasp it' with our hands?\"  The verse had now become endued with life, and meant something real and attractive to Veronica. She did not lay her rose out of her hand for a long time, that evening, notwithstanding that Dietrich cast threatening glances upon it, and finally broke out in vexation,  \"I will tear off the spring some time, and spoil the thing altogether.\"  The rose was not put into the book and the book into the cup-board, until the time came for the children to say their evening prayers. This was the closing act of every day; and it was so fixed and regular a habit, that the children never needed to be bidden to fold their hands, and kneel to ask God's blessing before they slept.     CHAPTER III.  NINE YEARS LATER.   A sunshiny Easter morning shone over hill and valley. A crowd of holiday-making people poured out of the little church at Tannenegg, and scattered in every direction. A long row of blooming lads and lassies came in close ranks, moving slowly towards the parsonage. They were the newly-confirmed young people of the parish, who had that day partaken of the Communion for the first time. They were going to the house of their pastor, to express their gratitude for his careful and tender teaching and guidance, before they went out into the world. Among these were Dietrich and Veronica. Gertrude stood at a little distance from the church, and watched the procession as it passed by. Her eyes were filled with tears of pleasurable emotion, as she noticed that her dark-eyed Veronica was conspicuous among all the maidens for the tasteful neatness of her costume, and for the sweetness and grace of her bearing. The glance which Veronica cast upon the mother in passing was full of love and gratitude; and seemed to repeat the words that the faithful girl had spoken in the morning, as she left her to go to the church. \"I cannot thank you enough, as long as I live, for what you have done for me, mother.\" A yet brighter expression of happiness crossed Gertrude's countenance when the young men came in procession after the girls, as her eyes fell on the well-formed lad, a head taller than his companions, who nodded at her, and greeted her with merry laughing looks, kissing his hand again and again, and yet once again. That was her tall handsome Dietrich. His mother's heart leaped in her breast at the sight of his fresh young life, so full of hope and promise. Gertrude waited till the visit to the pastor was over, and the young people had separated on their various paths. Then she in her turn entered the parsonage. She wished herself to speak her thanks to this true and long tried adviser and friend, for all that he had done for her children.  \"You are a fortunate mother,\" said the aged pastor, after he had listened to Gertrude's expressions of gratitude. \"Those are two uncommon children that the good God has confided to your care, and I feel the greatest interest in them. The lad has a clear head, and a winning grace that draws everyone to him. Veronica is serious and conscientious; she has a calm steady nature and can be depended upon for fidelity to duty, such as it is rare to find. The children will be your stay and comfort in your old age. May you keep them in the paths of virtue.\"  \"With God's help;\" said Gertrude, and she left the parsonage with tears of happiness in her eyes. As she passed the garden of her neighbor Judith, the latter called out over the low hedge,  \"They have just gone by, all four of them. It always seems to me strange that while all babies in the cradle look just alike, so that you can't tell them apart, they grow up to be such very different men and women.\"  \"No, no, these four were never alike,\" replied Gertrude, \"but I agree that they grow more and more unlike every day.\"  \"Yes, that they do. And of you three near neighbors, you certainly have drawn the best lot in children,\" said Judith with enthusiasm, \"two like your two are not to be found in a long day's journey. Veronica will fully repay you for what you have done for her.\"  \"I have been repaid long ago by the child's attachment to me. She has never given me anything but satisfaction ever since her mother died. If I have any anxiety about Veronica it is lest she over-work herself. There is something feverish in her love of work; she can never do enough. No matter how late I go into her room at night, she is always finishing off some piece of work; and no matter how early I get up in the morning, she has already begun something new. If I had not positively forbidden it, she would keep at it even on a Sunday. It is a real source of anxiety to me, lest she should over-work and break down.\"  \"Oh, I don't think you need be afraid of that, Gertrude; work never yet hurt any one, least of all the young folks. Let her work away. But I don't see the need of her scowling so all the time. She looks for all the world as if she were fighting and struggling against enemies and difficulties of all sorts. I like better Dietrich's laughing eyes; they are so full of fun. When he goes down the street singing--      'Gladly and merrily      Live to-day cheerily,      Black care and sorrow      Leave till to-morrow,'  it goes right to my heart, and I could sing too for very joy. No one can help loving him.\"  Gertrude listened with sunshine in her face to these words of praise, but a little cloud of anxiety shadowed her eyes as she said,  \"Yes, God be praised, he is a good boy and means well, but I do wish that he had a little of Veronica's firmness of purpose. It is very pleasant to have every one like him, but too great popularity is not always a good thing. And those two companions that are always hanging about him, are not such as I myself would choose for his friends.\"  \"If they could all be put to some steady work it would be the best thing for them,\" said Judith. \"Idleness is the mother of mischief. Blasi is not an ill-meaning fellow, but he is lazy, greatly to his own injury. Long Jost is the worst of the two; a sly-boots, and a rare one too. It is to be hoped that he will break his own leg, when he's trying to trip some one else up with it.\"  \"No, no, Judith, on this holy Easter day, we will not have such unkind hopes as that. I hope and believe that the good God holds the children in his protecting hand. We have given them to him; that is my comfort and support Good-bye, Judith; come often to see us; we are always glad of your company.\"  On the evening of this sunny Easter day, while rosy clouds moved slowly across the clear sky, and the golden glow faded in the far west behind the wooded heights, Gertrude came back from a long walk in the fields and woods. On one side of her strode Dietrich, talking rapidly and earnestly: the fresh joy of youth was written in every movement of his little figure, and laughed from the depths of his clear eyes. On the other side Veronica walked, listening in silence. Her noble features, above which her black hair fell in shining waves, had a serious, thoughtful expression, but every now and then, when Dietrich let fall some particularly apt expression, a look would cross her face that irradiated it like a sunbeam crossing a shadowed plain. Mother Gertrude looked now proudly at her radiant son, now approvingly at her stately daughter, and again she lifted grateful glances towards the glowing heavens where she saw promise of another brilliant day to come. Far and wide, in all Tannenegg, was not to be found that day, such another happy mother as Gertrude.  When they reached the crossways where the footpath led up by the tavern of the Rehbock, Dietrich turned into it, and his mother was about to follow him, but Veronica drew her back,"]]]
