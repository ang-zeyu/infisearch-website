Song 3. _Praise to God for our Redemption_.  1 Blest be the wisdom and the power, The justice and the grace, That join'd in council to restore And save our ruin'd race!  2 Our father eat forbidden fruit, And from his glory fell; And we, his children, thus were brought To death, and near to hell.  3 Blest be the Lord, that sent his Son To take our flesh and blood; He for our lives gave up his own, To make our peace with God.  4 He honour'd all his Father's laws, Which we have disobey'd; He bore our sins upon the cross, And our full ransom paid.  5 Behold him rising from the grave; Behold him rais'd on high: He pleads his merits there to save Transgressors doom'd to die.  6 There on a glorious throne, he reigns, And by his power divine Redeems us from the slavish chains Of Satan, and of sin.  7 Thence shall the Lord to judgment come, And, with a sovereign voice, Shall call, and break up every tomb, While waking saints rejoice.  8 O may I then with joy appear Before the Judge's face, And, with the blest assembly there, Sing his redeeming grace!   Song 4. _Praise for Mercies Spiritual and Temporal_.  1 Whene'er I take my walks abroad, How many poor I see? What shall I render to my God For all his gifts to me?  2 Not more than others I deserve, Yet God hath given me more; For I have food, while others starve, Or beg from door to door.  3 How many children in the street Half naked I behold? While I am clothed from head to feet, And cover'd from the cold.  4 While some poor wretches scarce can tell Where they may lay their head, I have a home wherein to dwell, And rest upon my bed.  5 While others early learn to swear, And curse, and lie, and steal, Lord, I am taught thy name to fear, And do thy holy will.  6 Are these thy favours, day by day To me above the rest? Then let me love thee more than they, And try to serve thee best.   Song 5. _Praise for Birth and Education in a Christian Land_.  1 Great God, to thee my voice I raise, To thee my youngest hours belong; I would begin my life with praise, Till growing years improve the song.  2 'Tis to thy soveraign grace I owe, That I was born on Brittish ground, Where streams of heavenly mercy flow, And words of sweet salvation sound.  3 I would not change my native land For rich Peru, with all her gold: A nobler prize lies in my hand Than East or Western Indies hold.  4 How do I pity those that dwell Where ignorance and darkness reigns; They know no heav'n, they fear no hell, Those endless joys, those endless pains.  5 Thy glorious promises, O Lord, Kindle my hope and my desire; While all the preachers of thy word Warn me t' escape eternal fire.  6 Thy praise shall still employ my breath, Since thou hast mark'd my way to heaven; Nor will I run the road to death, And wast the blessings thou hast given.   Song 6. _Praise for the Gospel_.  1 Lord, I ascribe it to thy grace, And not to chance as others do, That I was born of Christian race, And not a Heathen, or a Jew.  2 What would the ancient Jewish kings, And Jewish prophets once have given, Could they have heard these glorious things, Which Christ reveal'd, and brought from heav'n!  3 How glad the Heathens would have been, That worship idols, wood, and stone, If they the book of God had seen, Or Jesus and his gospel known!  4 Then if the Gospel I refuse, How shall I e'er lift up mine eyes? For all the Gentiles and the Jews Against me will in judgment rise.   Song 7. _The Excellency of the Bible_.  1 Great God, with wonder and with praise, On all thy works I look; But still thy wisdom, power and grace Shine brighter in thy Book.  2 The stars that in their courses roll, Have much instruction given; But thy good Word informs my soul How I may climb to heaven.  3 The fields provide me food, and show The goodness of the Lord; But fruits of life and glory grow In thy most holy Word.  4 Here are my choicest treasures hid, Here my best comfort lies; Here my desires are satisfy'd; And hence my hopes arise.  5 Lord, make me understand thy law, Show what my faults have been; And from thy Gospel let me draw Pardon for all my sin.  6 Here would I learn how Christ has dy'd To save my soul from hell: Not all the books on earth beside Such heav'nly wonders tell.  7 Then let me love my Bible more, And take a fresh delight By day to read these wonders o'er, And meditate by night.   Song 8. _Praise to God for learning to read_.  1 The praises of my tongue I offer to the Lord, That I was taught, and learnt so young To read his holy Word.  2 That I am taught to know The danger I was in, By nature and by practice too A wretched slave to sin.  3 That I am led to see I can do nothing well; And whither shall a sinner flee, To save himself from hell?  4 Dear Lord, this book of thine Informs me where to go For grace to pardon all my sin, And make me holy too.  5 Here I can read and learn How Christ the Son of God Did undertake our great concern, Our ransom cost his blood.  6 And now he reigns above, He sends his Spirit down, To show the wonders of his love, And make his Gospel known.  7 O may that Spirit teach, And make my heart receive Those truths which all thy servants preach, And all thy saints believe!  8 Then shall I praise the Lord In a more chearful strain, That I was taught to read his Word, And have not learnt in vain.   Song 9. The All-Seeing God.  1 Almighty God, thy piercing eye Strikes through the shades of night, And our most secret actions lie All open to thy sight.  2 There's not a sin that we commit, Nor wicked word we say, But in thy dreadful book `tis writ Against the judgment-day.  3 And must the crimes that I have done Be read and publish'd there, Be all exposed before the sun, While men and angels hear?  4 Lord, at thy feet ashamed I lie, Upward I dare not look; Pardon my sins before I die, And blot them from thy book.  5 Remember all the dying pains That my Redeemer felt, And let his blood wash out my stains, And answer for my guilt.  6 O may I now for ever fear T' indulge a sinful thought, Since the great God can see, and hear, And writes down every fault!   Song 10. _Solemn Thoughts of God and Death_.  1 There is a God that reigns above, Lord of the heavens, and earth, and seas: I fear his wrath, I ask his love, And with my lips I sing his praise.  2 There is a law which he has writ, To teach us all what we must do; My soul, to his commands submit, For they are holy, just and true.  3 There is a Gospel of rich grace, Whence sinners all their comfort draw; Lord, I repent, and seek thy face; For I have often broke thy law.  4 There is an hour when I must die, Nor do I know how soon `twill come; A thousand children young as I Are call'd by death to hear their doom.  5 Let me improve the hours I have Before the day of grace is fled; There's no repentance in the grave, No pardons offer'd to the dead.  6 Just as a tree cut down, that fell To north, or southward, there it lies: So man departs to heaven or hell, Fix'd in the state wherein he dies.   Song 11. _Heaven and Hell_.  1 There is beyond the sky A heaven of joy and love, And holy children, when they die, Go to that world above.  2 There is a dreadful hell, And everlasting pains, There sinners must with devils dwell In darkness, fire, and chains.  3 Can such a wretch as I Escape this cursed end? And may I hope, whene'er I die, I shall to heaven ascend?  4 Then will I read and pray While I have life and breath; Lest I should be cut off to day, And sent t' eternal death.   Song 12. _The Advantages of early Religion_.  1 Happy's the child whose youngest years Receive instruction well; Who hates the sinner's path, and fears The road that leads to hell.  2 When we devote our youth to God, 'Tis pleasing in his eyes; A flower, when offer'd in the bud, Is no vain sacrifice.  3 'Tis easier work if we begin To fear the Lord betimes; While sinners that grow old in sin Are hard'ned in their crimes.  4 'Twill save us from a thousand snares To mind religion young; Grace will preserve our following years And make our vertue strong.  5 To thee, Almighty God, to thee Our childhood we resign; 'Twill please us to look back and see That our whole lives were thine.  6 Let the sweet work of prayer and praise, Employ my youngest breath; Thus I'm prepar'd for longer days, Or fit for early death.   Song 13. _The Danger of Delay_.  1 Why should I say, \"`Tis yet too soon \"To seek for heaven or think of death?\" A flower may fade before `tis noon, And I this day may lose my breath.  2 If this rebellious heart of mine, Despise the gracious calls of Heaven; I may be hard'ned in my sin, And never have repentance given.  3 What if the Lord grow wroth, and swear While I refuse to read and pray, That he'll refuse to lend an ear, To all my groans another day?  4 What if his dreadful anger burn, While I refuse his offer'd grace, And all his love to fury turn, And strike me dead upon the place?  5 'Tis dangerous to provoke a God; His power and vengeance none can tell: One stroke of his almighty rod Shall send young sinners quick to hell.  6 Then `twill for ever be in vain To cry for pardon or for grace, To wish I had my time again, Or hope to see my Maker's face.   Song 14. _Examples of early piety_.  1 What blest examples do I find Writ in the Word of Truth, Of children that began to mind Religion in their youth.  2 Jesus, who reigns above the skie, And keeps the world in awe; Was once a child as young as I, And kept his Father's law.  3 At twelve years old he talk'd with men, (The Jews all wondering stand;) Yet he obey'd his Mother then, And "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13439"],["title","Divine Songs (#2)"],["body","at her command.  4 Children a sweet hosanna sung, And blest their Saviour's name; They gave him honour with their tongue While scribes and priests blaspheme.  5 Samuel the child was wean'd, and brought To wait upon the Lord; Young Timothy betimes was taught To know his holy Word.  6 Then why should I so long delay What others learn so soon? I would not pass another day Without this work begun.   Song 15. _Against Lying_.  1 O `tis a lovely thing for youth To walk betimes in wisdom's way; To fear a lye, to speak the truth, That we may trust to all they say.  2 But lyars we can never trust, Though they should speak the thing that's true, And he that does one fault at first, And lyes to hide it, makes it two.  3 Have we not known, nor heard, nor read, How God abhors deceit and wrong? How Ananias was struck dead Catch'd with a lye upon his tongue?  4 So did his wife Sapphira die When she came in, and grew so bold As to confirm that wicked lye That just before her husband told.  5 The Lord delights in them that speak The words of truth; but every lyar Must have his portion in the lake That burns with brimstone and with fire.  6 Then let me always watch my lips, Lest I be struck to death and hell, Since God a book of reckoning keeps For every lye that children tell.   Song 16. _Against Quarrelling and Fighting_.  1 Let dogs delight to bark and bite, For God has made them so; Let bears and lyons growl and fight, For `tis their nature too.  2 But, children, you should never let Such angry passions rise; Your little hands were never made To tear each other's eyes.  3 Let love thro' all your actions run, And all your words be mild; Live like the blessed Virgin's Son, That sweet and lovely child.  4 His soul was gentle as a lamb; And as his stature grew, He grew in favour both with man And God his Father too.  5 Now, Lord of all, he reigns above, And from his heavenly throne, He sees what children dwell in love, And marks them for his own.   Song 17. _Love between Brothers and Sisters_.  1 What ever brawls are in the street There should be peace at home; Where sisters dwell and brothers meet Quarrels shou'd never come.  2 Birds in their little nests agree; And `tis a shameful sight, When children of one family Fall out, and chide, and fight.  3 Hard names at first, and threatening words, That are but noisy breath, May grow to clubs and naked swords, To murder and to death.  4 The devil tempts one mother's son To rage against another: So wicked Cain was hurried on, Till he had kill'd his brother.  5 The wise will make their anger cool At least before `tis night; But in the bosom of a fool It burns till morning light.  5 Pardon, O Lord, our childish rage; Our little brawls remove; That as we grow to riper age, Our hearts may all be love.   Song 18. _Against Scoffing and calling Names_.  1 Our tongues were made to bless the Lord, And not speak ill of men: When others give a railing word, We must not rail again.  2 Cross words and angry names require To be chastiz'd at school; And he's in danger of hell-fire, That calls his brother, fool.  3 But lips that dare be so prophane To mock and jeer and scoff At holy things, or holy men, The Lord shall cut them off.  4 When children, in their wanton play Served old Elisha so, And bade the prophet go his way, \"Go up, thou bald head, go.\"  5 God quickly stopt their wicked breath, And sent two raging bears, That tore them limb from limb to death, With blood and groans and tears.  6 Great God, how terrible art thou To sinners ne'er so young! Grant me thy grace and teach me how To tame and rule my tongue.   Song 19. _Against Swearing and Cursing, and taking God's Name in vain_.  1 Angels that high in glory dwell Adore thy Name, Almighty God! And devils tremble down in hell Beneath the terrors of thy rod.  2 And yet how wicked children dare Abuse thy dreadful glorious Name! And when they're angry, how they swear, And curse their fellows, and blaspheme!  3 How will they stand before thy face, Who treated thee with such disdain, While thou shalt doom them to the place Of everlasting fire and pain?  4 Then never shall one cooling drop To quench their burning tongues be giv'n. But I will praise thee here, and hope Thus to employ my tongue in heav'n.  5 My heart shall be in pain to hear Wretches affront the Lord above; 'Tis that great God whose power I fear, That heavenly Father whom I love.  6 If my companions grow profane, I'll leave their friendship when I hear Young sinners take thy name in vain, And learn to curse, and learn to swear.   Song 20. _Against Idleness and Mischief_.  1 How doth the little busy bee Improve each shining hour, And gather honey all the day From every opening flower!  2 How skilfully she builds her cell! How neat she spreads the wax! And labours hard to store it well With the sweet food she makes.  3 In works of labour or of skill I would be busy too: For Satan finds some mischief still For idle hands to do.  4 In books, or work, or healthful play Let my first years be past, That I may give for every day Some good account at last.   Song 21. _Against evil Company_.  1 Why should I join with those in play In whom I've no delight; Who curse and swear, but never play; Who call ill names, and fight?  2 I hate to hear a wanton song: Their words offend my ears: I should not dare defile my tongue With language such as theirs.  3 Away from fools I'll turn my eyes, Nor with the scoffers go: I would be walking with the wise, That wiser I may grow.  4 From one rude boy, that's used to mock, They learn the wicked jest: One sickly sheep infects the flock, And poisons all the rest.  5 My God, I hate to walk or dwell With sinful children here: Then let me not be sent to hell, Where none but sinners are.   Song 22. _Against Pride in Clothes_.  1 Why should our garments, made to hide Our parents' shame, provoke our pride? The art of dress did ne'er begin Till Eve our mother learnt to sin.  2 When first she put the covering on, Her robe of innocence was gone; And yet her children vainly boast In the sad marks of glory lost.  3 How proud we are! how fond to shew Our clothes, and call them rich and new, When the poor sheep and silkworms wore That very clothing long before!  4 The tulip and the butterfly Appear in gayer coats than I: Let me be dress'd fine as I will, Flies, worms, and flowers exceed me still.  5 Then will I set my heart to find Inward adornings of the mind: Knowledge and virtue, truth and grace, These are the robes of richest dress.  6 No more shall worms with me compare, This is the raiment angels wear: The Son of God, when here below, Put on this blest apparel too.  6 It never fades, it ne'er grows old, Nor fears the rain, nor moth, nor mould: It takes no spot, but still refines; The more `tis worn, the more it shines.  7 In this on earth would I appear, Then go to heaven, and wear it there: God will approve it in his sight; 'Tis his own work, and his delight.   Song 23. _Obedience to Parents_.  1 Let children that would fear the Lord Hear what their teachers say; With reverence meet their parents' word, And with delight obey.  2 Have you not heard what dreadful plagues Are threaten'd by the Lord, To him that breaks his father's law, Or mocks his mother's word?  3 What heavy guilt upon him lies! How cursed is his name! The ravens shall pick out his eyes, And eagles eat the same.  4 But those who worship God, and give Their parents honour due, Here on this earth they long shall live, And live hereafter, too.   Song 24. _The Child's Complaint_.  1 Why should I love my sports so well, So constant at my play, And lose the thoughts of heaven and hell, And then forget to pray?  2 What do I read my Bible for, But, Lord, to learn thy will? And shall I daily know thee more, And less obey thee still?  3 How senseless is my heart, and wild! How vain are all my thoughts! Pity the weakness of a child, And pardon all my faults.  4 Make me thy heavenly voice to hear, And let me love to pray; Since God will lend a gracious ear To what a child can say.   Song 25. _A Morning Song_.  1 My God, who makes the sun to know His proper hour to rise; And, to give light to all below, Doth send him round the skies:  2 When from the chambers of the east His morning race begins, He never tires, nor stops to rest, But round the world he shines.  3 So, like the sun, would I fulfil The business of the day; Begin my work betimes, and still March on my heavenly way.  4 Give me, O Lord, thy early grace, Nor let my soul complain That the young morning of my day Has all been spent in vain!   Song 26. _An Evening Song_.  1 And now another day is gone, I'll sing my Maker's praise! My comforts every hour make known His providence and grace.  2 But how my childhood runs to waste My sins how great their sum! Lord, give me pardon for the past, And strength for days to come.  3 I lay my body down to sleep, Let angels guard my head; And, through the hours of darkness, keep Their watch around my head.  4 With cheerful heart I close mine eyes, Since thou wilt not remove; And in the morning let me rise Rejoicing in thy love.   Song 27. _For the Lord's Day Morning_.  1 This is the day when Christ arose So early from the dead: Why should I my eyelids close, And waste my hours in bed?  2 This is the day when Jesus broke The powers of death and hell; And shall I still wear Satan's yoke, And love my sins so well?  3 To-day, with pleasure, Christians meet, To pray, and hear thy Word; And I would go with cheerful feet To learn thy will, O Lord!  4 I'll leave my sport, to read and pray, And so prepare for heaven: O may I love this blessed day The best of all the seven!   Song 28. _For Lord's Day Evening_.  1 Lord, how delightful `tis to see A whole assembly worship thee! At once they sing, at once they pray; They hear of heaven, and learn the way.  2 I have been there, and still would go 'Tis like a little heaven below! Not all my pleasure and my play Should tempt me to forget this day.  3 O write upon my memory,"]]]
