All of his schoolmates used to say that they \"liked\" the spring, some of the girls would even say that they \"dearly loved\" the spring, but they could not understand the madness that blazed in Yan's eyes when springtime really came--the flush of cheek--the shortening breath--the restless craving for action--the chafing with flashes of rebellion at school restraints--the overflow of nervous energy--the bloodthirst in his blood--the hankering to run--to run to the north, when the springtime tokens bugled to his every sense.  Then the wind and sky and ground were full of thrill. There was clamour everywhere, but never a word. There was stirring within and without. There was incentive in the yelping of the Wild Geese; but it was only tumult, for he could not understand why he was so stirred. There were voices that he could not hear--messages that he could not read; all was confusion of tongues. He longed only to get away.  \"If only I could get away. If--if--Oh, God!\" he stammered in torment of inexpression, and then would gasp and fling himself down on some bank, and bite the twigs that chanced within reach and tremble and wonder at himself.  Only one thing kept him from some mad and suicidal move--from joining some roving Indian band up north, or gypsies nearer--and that was the strong hand at home.     III  His Adjoining Brothers   Yan had many brothers, but only those next him in age were important in his life. Rad was two years older--a strong boy, who prided himself on his \"common sense.\" Though so much older, he was Yan's inferior at school. He resented this, and delighted in showing his muscular superiority at all opportunities. He was inclined to be religious, and was strictly proper in his life and speech. He never was known to smoke a cigarette, tell a lie, or say \"gosh\" or \"darn.\" He was plucky and persevering, but he was cold and hard, without a human fiber or a drop of red blood in his make-up. Even as a boy he bragged that he had no enthusiasms, that he believed in common sense, that he called a spade a spade, and would not use two words where one would do. His intelligence was above the average, but he was so anxious to be thought a person of rare sagacity and smartness, unswayed by emotion, that nothing was too heartless for him to do if it seemed in line with his assumed character. He was not especially selfish, and yet he pretended to be so, simply that people should say of him significantly and admiringly: \"Isn't he keen? Doesn't he know how to take care of himself?\" What little human warmth there was in him died early, and he succeeded only in making himself increasingly detested as he grew up.  His relations to Yan may be seen in one incident.  Yan had been crawling about under the house in the low wide cobwebby space between the floor beams and the ground. The delightful sensation of being on an exploring expedition led him farther (and ultimately to a paternal thrashing for soiling his clothes), till he discovered a hollow place near one side, where he could nearly stand upright. He at once formed one of his schemes--to make a secret, or at least a private, workroom here. He knew that if he were to ask permission he would be refused, but if he and Rad together were to go it might receive favourable consideration on account of Rad's self-asserted reputation for common sense. For a wonder, Rad was impressed with the scheme, but was quite sure that they had \"better not go together to ask Father.\" He \"could manage that part better alone,\" and he did.  Then they set to work. The first thing was to deepen the hole from three feet to six feet everywhere, and get rid of the earth by working it back under the floor of the house. There were many days of labour in this, and Yan stuck to it each day after returning from school. There were always numerous reasons why Rad could not share in the labour. When the ten by fourteen-foot hole was made, boards to line and floor it were needed. Lumber was very cheap--inferior, second-hand stuff was to be had for the asking--and Yan found and carried boards enough to make the workroom. Rad was an able carpenter and now took charge of the construction. They worked together evening after evening, Yan discussing all manner of plans with warmth and enthusiasm--what they would do in their workshop when finished--how they might get a jig-saw in time and saw picture frames, so as to make some money. Rad assented with grunts or an occasional Scripture text--that was his way. Each day he told Yan what to go on with while he was absent.  The walls were finished at length; a window placed in one side; a door made and fitted with lock and key. What joy! Yan glowed with pleasure and pride at the triumphant completion of his scheme. He swept up the floor for the finishing ceremony and sat down on the bench for a grand gloat, when Rad said abruptly:  \"Going to lock up now.\" That sounded gratifyingly important. Yan stepped outside. Rad locked the door, put the key in his pocket, then turning, he said with cold, brutal emphasis:  \"Now you keep out of my workshop from this on. _You_ have nothing to do with it. It's mine. I got the permission to make it.\" All of which he could prove, and did.         *       *       *       *       *  Alner, the youngest, was eighteen months younger than Yan, and about the same size, but the resemblance stopped there. His chief aim in life was to be stylish. He once startled his mother by inserting into his childish prayers the perfectly sincere request: \"Please, God, make me an awful swell, for Jesus sake.\" Vanity was his foible, and laziness his sin.  He could be flattered into anything that did not involve effort. He fairly ached to be famous. He was consuming with desire to be pointed out for admiration as the great this, that or the other thing--it did not matter to him what, as long as he could be pointed out. But he never had the least idea of working for it. At school he was a sad dunce. He was three grades below Yan and at the bottom of his grade. They set out for school each day together, because that was a paternal ruling; but they rarely reached there together. They had nothing in common. Yan was full of warmth, enthusiasm, earnestness and energy, but had a most passionate and ungovernable temper. Little put him in a rage, but it was soon over, and then an equally violent reaction set in, and he was always anxious to beg forgiveness and make friends again. Alner was of lazy good temper and had a large sense of humour. His interests were wholly in the playground. He had no sympathy with Yan's Indian tastes--\"Indians in nasty, shabby clothes. Bah! Horrid!\" he would scornfully say.  These, then, were his adjoining brothers.  What wonder that Yan was daily further from them.     IV  The Book   But the greatest event of Yan's then early life now took place. His school readers told him about Wilson and Audubon, the first and last American naturalists. Yan wondered why no other great prophet had arisen. But one day the papers announced that at length he had appeared. A work on the Birds of Canada, by ..., had come at last, price one dollar.  Money never before seemed so precious, necessary and noble a thing. \"Oh! if I only had a dollar.\" He set to work to save and scrape. He won marbles in game, swopped marbles for tops, tops for jack-knives as the various games came around with strange and rigid periodicity. The jack-knives in turn were converted into rabbits, the rabbits into cash of small denominations. He carried wood for strange householders; he scraped and scraped and saved the scrapings; and got, after some months, as high as ninety cents. But there was a dread fatality about that last dime. No one seemed to have any more odd jobs; his commercial luck deserted him. He was burnt up with craving for that book. None of his people took interest enough in him to advance the cash even at the ruinous interest (two or three times cent per cent) that he was willing to bind himself for. Six weeks passed before he achieved that last dime, and he never felt conscience-clear about it afterward.  He and Alner had to cut the kitchen wood. Each had his daily allotment, as well as other chores. Yan's was always done faithfully, but the other evaded his work in every way. He was a notorious little fop. The paternal poverty did not permit his toilet extravagance to soar above one paper collar per week, but in his pocket he carried a piece of ink eraser with which he was careful to keep the paper collar up to standard. Yan cared nothing about dress--indeed, was inclined to be slovenly. So the eldest brother, meaning to turn Alner's weakness to account, offered a prize of a twenty-five-cent necktie of the winner's own choice to the one who did his chores best for a month. For the first week Alner and Yan kept even, then Alner wearied, in spite of the dazzling prize. The pace was too hot. Yan kept on his usual way and was duly awarded the twenty-five cents to be spent on a necktie. But in the store a bright thought came tempting him. Fifteen cents was as much as any one should spend on a necktie--that's sure; the other ten would get the book. And thus the last dime was added to the pile. Then, bursting with joy and with the pride of a capitalist, he went to the book-shop and asked for the coveted volume.  He was tense with long-pent feeling. He expected to have the bookseller say that the price had gone up to one thousand dollars, and that all were sold. But he did not. He turned silently, drew the book out of a pile of them, hesitated and said, \"Green or red cover?\"  \"Green,\" said Yan, not yet believing. The book-man looked inside, then laid it down, saying in a cold, business tone, \"Ninety cents.\"  \"Ninety cents,\" gasped Yan. Oh! if only he had known the ways of booksellers or the workings of cash discounts. For six weeks had he been barred this happy land--had suffered starvation; he had "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13499"],["title","Two Little Savages (#2)"],["body","funds, he had fractured his conscience and all to raise that ten cents--that unnecessary dime.  He read that book reverentially all the way home. It did not give him what he wanted, but that doubtless was his own fault. He pored over it, studied it, loved it, never doubting that now he had the key to all the wonders and mysteries of Nature. It was five years before he fully found out that the text was the most worthless trash ever foisted on a torpid public. Nevertheless, the book held some useful things; first, a list of the bird names; second, some thirty vile travesties of Audubon and Wilson's bird portraits.  These were the birds thus maligned:  Duck Hawk                     Rose-breasted Grosbeak Sparrow Hawk                  Bobolink White-headed Eagle            Meadow Lark Great Horned Owl              Bluejay Snowy Owl                     Ruffed Grouse Red-headed Woodpecker         Great Blue Heron Golden-winged Woodpecker      Bittern Barn-swallow                  Wilson's Snipe Whip-poor-will                Long-biller Curlew Night Hawk                    Purple Gallinule Belted Kingfisher             Canada Goose Kingbird                      Wood Duck Woodthrush                    Hooded Merganser Catbird                       Double-crested Cormorant White-bellied Nuthatch        Arctic Tern Brown Creeper                 Great Northern Diver Bohemian Chatterer            Stormy Petrel Great Northern Shrike         Arctic Puffin Shore Lark                    Black Guillemot  [Illustration: \"He already knew the Downy Woodpecker\"]   But badly as they were presented, the pictures were yet information, and were entered in his memory as lasting accessions to his store of truth about the Wild Things.  Of course, he already knew some few birds whose names are familiar to every schoolboy: the Robin, Bluebird, Kingbird, Wild Canary, Woodpecker, Barn-swallow, Wren, Chickadee, Wild Pigeon, Humming-bird, Pewee, so that his list was steadily increased.     V  The Collarless Stranger     Oh, sympathy! the noblest gift of God to man.   The greatest bond there is twixt man and man.   The strongest link in any friendship chain.   The single lasting hold in kinship's claim.   The only incorrosive strand in marriage bonds.   The blazing torch where genius lights her lamp.   The ten times noble base of noblest love.   More deep than love--more strong than hate--the biggest thing   in all the universe--the law of laws.   Grant but this greatest gift of God to man--this single link   concatenating grant, and all the rest are worthless or comprised.  Each year the ancient springtime madness came more strongly on Yan. Each year he was less inclined to resist it, and one glorious day of late April in its twelfth return he had wandered northward along to a little wood a couple of miles from the town. It was full of unnamed flowers and voices and mysteries. Every tree and thicket had a voice--a long ditch full of water had many that called to him. \"_Peep-peep-peep_,\" they seemed to say in invitation for him to come and see. He crawled again and again to the ditch and watched and waited. The loud whistle would sound only a few rods away, \"_Peep-peep-peep_,\" but ceased at each spot when he came near--sometimes before him, sometimes behind, but never where he was. He searched through a small pool with his hands, sifted out sticks and leaves, but found nothing else. A farmer going by told him it was only a \"spring Peeper,\" whatever that was, \"some kind of a critter in the water.\"  Under a log not far away Yan found a little Lizard that tumbled out of sight into a hole. It was the only living thing there, so he decided that the \"Peeper\" must be a \"Whistling Lizard.\" But he was determined to see them when they were calling. How was it that the ponds all around should be full of them calling to him and playing hide and seek and yet defying his most careful search? The voices ceased as soon as he came near, to be gradually renewed in the pools he had left. His presence was a husher. He lay for a long time watching a pool, but none of the voices began again in range of his eye. At length, after realizing that they were avoiding him, he crawled to a very noisy pond without showing himself, and nearer and yet nearer until he was within three feet of a loud peeper in the floating grass. He located the spot within a few inches and yet could see nothing. He was utterly baffled, and lay there puzzling over it, when suddenly all the near Peepers stopped, and Yan was startled by a footfall; and looking around, he saw a man within a few feet, watching him.  Yan reddened--a stranger was always an enemy; he had a natural aversion to all such, and stared awkwardly as though caught in crime.  The man, a curious looking middle-aged person, was in shabby clothes and wore no collar. He had a tin box strapped on his bent shoulders, and in his hands was a long-handled net. His features, smothered in a grizzly beard, were very prominent and rugged. They gave evidence of intellectual force, with some severity, but his gray-blue eyes had a kindly look.  He had on a common, unbecoming, hard felt hat, and when he raised it to admit the pleasant breeze Yan saw that the wearer had hair like his own--a coarse, paleolithic mane, piled on his rugged brow, like a mass of seaweed lodged on some storm-beaten rock.  \"F'what are ye fynding, my lad?\" said he in tones whose gentleness was in no way obscured by a strong Scottish tang.  Still resenting somewhat the stranger's presence, Yan said:  \"I'm not finding anything; I am only trying to see what that Whistling Lizard is like.\"  The stranger's eyes twinkled. \"Forty years ago Ah was laying by a pool just as Ah seen ye this morning, looking and trying hard to read the riddle of the spring Peeper. Ah lay there all day, aye, and mony anither day, yes, it was nigh onto three years before Ah found it oot. Ah'll be glad to save ye seeking as long as Ah did, if that's yer mind. Ah'll show ye the Peeper.\"  Then he raked carefully among the leaves near the ditch, and soon captured a tiny Frog, less than an inch long.  \"Ther's your Whistling Lizard: he no a Lizard at all, but a Froggie. Book men call him _Hyla pickeringii_, an' a gude Scotchman he'd make, for ye see the St. Andrew's cross on his wee back. Ye see the whistling ones in the water put on'y their beaks oot an' is hard to see. Then they sinks to the bottom when ye come near. But you tak this'n home and treat him well and ye'll see him blow out his throat as big as himsel' an' whistle like a steam engine.\"  Yan thawed out now. He told about the Lizard he had seen.  \"That wasna a Lizard; Ah niver see thim aboot here. It must a been a two-striped _Spelerpes_. A _Spelerpes_ is nigh kin to a Frog--a kind of dry-land tadpole, while a Lizard is only a Snake with legs.\"  This was light from heaven. All Yan's distrust was gone. He warmed to the stranger. He plied him with questions; he told of his getting the Bird Book. Oh, how the stranger did snort at \"that driveling trash.\" Yan talked of his perplexities. He got a full hearing and intelligent answers. His mystery of the black ground-bird with a brown mate was resolved into the Common Towhee. The unknown wonderful voice in the spring morning, sending out its \"_cluck, cluck, cluck, clucker_,\" in the distant woods, the large gray Woodpecker that bored in some high stub and flew in a blaze of gold, and the wonderful spotted bird with red head and yellow wings and tail in the taxidermist's window, were all resolved into one and the same--the Flicker or Golden-winged Woodpecker. The Hang-nest and the Oriole became one. The unknown poisonous-looking blue Hornet, that sat on the mud with palpitating body, and the strange, invisible thing that made the mud-nests inside old outbuildings and crammed them with crippled Spiders, were both identified as the Mud-wasp or _Pelopæus_.  A black Butterfly flew over, and Yan learned that it was a Camberwell Beauty, or, scientifically, a _Vanessa antiopa_, and that this one must have hibernated to be seen so early in the spring, and yet more, that this beautiful creature was the glorified spirit of the common brown and black spiney Caterpillar.  The Wild Pigeons were flying high above them in great flocks as they sat there, and Yan learned of their great nesting places in the far South, and of their wonderful but exact migrations without regard to anything but food; their northward migration to gather the winged nuts of the Slippery Elm in Canada; their August flight to the rice-fields of Carolina; their Mississippi Valley pilgrimage when the acorns and beech-mast were falling ripe.  What a rich, full morning that was. Everything seemed to turn up for them. As they walked over a piney hill, two large birds sprang from the ground and whirred through the trees.  \"Ruffed Grouse or 'patridge', as the farmers call them. There's a pair lives nigh aboots here. They come on this bank for the Wintergreen berries.\"  And Yan was quick to pull and taste them. He filled his pockets with the aromatic plant--berries and all--and chewed it as he went. While they walked, a faint, far drum-thump fell on their ears. \"What's that?\" he exclaimed, ever on the alert. The stranger listened and said:  \"That's the bird ye ha' just seen; that's the Cock Partridge drumming for his mate.\"  The Pewee of his early memories became the Phoebe of books. That day his brookside singer became the Song-sparrow; the brown triller, the Veery Thrush. The Trilliums, white and red, the Dogtooth Violet, the Spring-beauty, the Trailing Arbutus--all for the first time got names and became real friends, instead of elusive and beautiful, but depressing mysteries.  The stranger warmed, too, and his rugged features glowed; he saw in Yan one minded like himself, tormented with the knowledge-hunger, as in youth he himself had been; and now it was a priceless privilege to save the boy some of what he had suffered.
