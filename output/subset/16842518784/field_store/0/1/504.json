They hoped to succeed as     easily with Weybehays' company, and in the meanwhile broke open     the chests of merchandise which had been saved from the vessel.     Jerome Cornelis caused clothing to be made             [Sidenote: 1629]     for his company out of the rich stuffs which he found therein,     choosing to himself a bodyguard, each of whom he clothed in scarlet,     embroidered with gold and silver. Regarding the women as part of     the spoil, he took one for himself, and gave one of the daughters     of the minister to a principal member of his party, abandoning     the other three for public use. He drew up also certain rules for     the future conduct of his men.  [Illustration: A DUTCH MAN-OF-WAR OF THE END OF THE 17th CENTURY. From a print after Vandervelde.]      \"After these horrible proceedings he caused himself to be elected     captain-general by a document which he compelled all his     companions to sign. He afterwards sent twenty-two men in two     shallops to destroy the company of Weybehays, but they met with a     repulse. Taking with him thirty-seven men, he went himself against     Weybehays, who received him at the water's edge as he disembarked,     and forced him to retire, although the lieutenant and his men had     no weapons but clubs, the ends of which were armed with spikes.     Finding force unavailing, the mutineer had recourse to other     means. He proposed a treaty of peace, the chaplain, who remained     with Weybehays, drawing up the conditions. It was agreed to with     this proviso, that Weybehays' company should remain unmolested,     and they, upon their part, agreed to deliver up a little boat in     which one of the sailors had escaped from the island where     Cornelis was located to that of Weybehays, receiving in return     some stuffs for clothing his people. During his negotiations     Cornelis wrote to certain French soldiers who belonged to the     lieutenant's company offering to each a sum of money to corrupt     them, with the hope that with this assistance he might easily     compass his design. His letters, which were without effect, were     shown to Weybehays, and Cornelis, who was ignorant of their     disclosure, having arrived the next day with three or four others     to find Weybehays and bring him the apparel, the latter caused him     to be attacked, killed two or three of the company, and took     Cornelis himself prisoner. One of them, by name Wouterlos, who     escaped from this rout, returned the following day to renew the     attack, but with little success.      \"Pelsart arrived during these occurrences in the frigate _Sardam_.     As he approached the wreck he observed smoke from a distance, a     circumstance that afforded him great consolation, since he     perceived by it that his people were not all dead. He cast anchor,     and threw himself immediately into a skiff with bread and wine,     and proceeded to land on one of the islands. Nearly at the same     time a boat came alongside with four armed men. Weybehays, who was     one of the four, ... informed him of the massacre, and advised him     to return as speedily as possible to his vessel, for that the     conspirators designed to surprise him, having already murdered     twenty-five persons, and to attack him with two shallops, adding     that he himself had that morning been at close quarters with them.     Pelsart perceived at the same time the two shallops coming towards     him, and had scarcely got on board his own vessel before they came     alongside. He was surprised to see the people covered with     embroidery of gold and silver and weapons in their hands, and     demanded of them why they approached the vessel armed. They     replied that they would inform him when they came on board. He     commanded them to cast their arms into the sea, or otherwise he     would sink them. Finding themselves compelled          [Sidenote: 1629]     to submit, they threw away their weapons, and being ordered on     board, were immediately placed in irons. One of them, named Jan     de Bremen, confessed that he had put to death or assisted in the     assassination of twenty-seven persons. The same evening Weybehays     brought his prisoner on board.      \"On the 18th day of September the captain and the master-pilot,     taking with them ten men of Weybehays' company, passed over in     boats to the island of Cornelis. Those who still remained thereon     lost all courage as soon as they saw them, and allowed themselves     to be placed in irons.\"  Pelsart remained another week at the Abrolhos, endeavouring to recover some of the _Batavia's_ treasure, and succeeded in finding all but one chest. The mutineers were tried by the officers of the _Sardam_, and all but two were executed before the ship left the scene of their awful crime. The two men who were not hanged were put on shore on the mainland, and were probably the first Europeans to end their lives upon the continent. Dutch vessels for many years afterwards sought for traces of the marooned seamen, but none were ever discovered.  The 1644 voyage of Tasman was made expressly for the purpose of exploring the north and north-western shores of the continent, and to prove the existence or otherwise of straits separating it from New Guinea. Tasman's instructions show this, and prove that while the existence of the straits was suspected, and although Torres had unconsciously passed through them, they were not known. Tasman explored a long length of coast-line, establishing its continuity from the extreme north-western point (Arnhem Land) as far as the twenty-second degree of south latitude (Exmouth Gulf). He failed to prove the existence of Torres Straits, but to him, it is generally agreed, is due the discovery and naming of the Gulf of Carpentaria (Carpenter in Tasman's time being President at Amsterdam of the Dutch East India Company) and the naming of a part of North Australia, as he had previously named the island to the south, after Van Diemen. From this voyage dates the name New Holland: the great stretch of coast-line embracing his discoveries became known to his countrymen as Hollandia Nova, a name which in its English form was adopted for the whole continent, and remained until it was succeeded by the more euphonious name of Australia. Tasman continued doing good service for the Dutch East India Company until his death at Batavia about 1659.  The last Dutch voyage which space permits us to mention    [Sidenote: 1727] briefly is that of the _Zeewigk_, which ship was wrecked on the Abrolhos in 1727, with a quantity of treasure on board. Some of the crew built a sloop out of the wreck and made their way to Batavia, taking with them the bulk of the treasure; but from time to time, even down to the present century, relics of the wreck, including several coins, have been recovered, and are now to be seen in the museum of the West Australian capital. But before the Dutch had given up exploring the coast of New Holland, Dampier, the first Englishman to set foot upon its shores, had twice visited the continent, and with his two voyages the English naval story of Australia may properly begin.     CHAPTER II.  DAMPIER: THE FIRST ENGLISHMAN IN AUSTRALIA.       \"I dined with Mr. Pepys, where was Captain Dampier, who had been a     famous buccaneer, had brought hither the painted Prince Job, and     printed a relation of his very strange adventure and his     observations. He was now going abroad again by the King's     encouragement, who furnished a ship of 290 tons. He seemed a more     modest man than one would imagine by the relation of the crew he     had consorted with. He brought a map of his observations of the     course of the winds of the South Sea, and assured us that the maps     hitherto extant were all false as to the Pacific Sea, which he     makes on the south of the line, that on the north and running by     the coast of Peru being I exceedingly tempestuous.\"  Thus wrote John Evelyn on August 6th, 1698.  Of the adventurous career of Dampier prior to this date too much fiction and quite enough history has already been written; but we cannot omit a short account of the buccaneer's life up to the time of his receiving King William's commission.  Dampier was born in 1652 at East Coker,               [Sidenote: 1673-1698] Somersetshire. Of his parents he tells us that \"they did not originally design me for the sea, but bred me at school till I came of years fit for a trade. But upon the death of my mother they who had the disposal of me took other measures, and, having removed me from the Latin school to learn writing and arithmetic, they soon placed me with a master of a ship at Weymouth, complying with the inclinations I had very early of seeing the world.\"  Dampier made several voyages in merchantmen; then he shipped as able seaman on the _Royal Prince_, Captain Sir Edward Spragge, and served under him till the death of that commander at the end of the Dutch war in 1673. Soon after he made a voyage to the West Indies; then began an adventurous life--ashore cutting logwood in the Bay of Campeachy when not fighting; afloat a buccaneer--of which he has given us details in his _Voyage round the Terrestrial Globe_.  In March, 1686, Dampier in a little barque, the _Cygnet_, commanded by Captain Swan, quitted the American coast and sailed westward across the Pacific. On this voyage the _Cygnet_ touched at the Ladrones, the Bashee Islands, the Philippines, Celebes, Timor, New Holland, and the Nicobar Islands. Here Dampier left his ship and worked his way to England, which he reached in 1691. (The _Cygnet_ was afterwards lost off Madagascar.) He had brought home with him from Mindanao a tattooed slave, whom he called the \"Painted Prince Jeoey,\" and who was afterwards exhibited as the first painted savage ever seen in England. \"Jeoey,\" who died at Oxford, is"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13"],["title","The Hunting of the Snark: An Agony in Eight Fits (#1)"],["body","was to tingle his bell.       He was thoughtful and grave--but the orders he gave           Were enough to bewilder a crew.      When he cried “Steer to starboard, but keep her head larboard!”            What on earth was the helmsman to do?       Then the bowsprit got mixed with the rudder sometimes:           A thing, as the Bellman remarked,      That frequently happens in tropical climes,           When a vessel is, so to speak, “snarked.”       But the principal failing occurred in the sailing,           And the Bellman, perplexed and distressed,      Said he had hoped, at least, when the wind blew due East,           That the ship would not travel due West!       But the danger was past--they had landed at last,           With their boxes, portmanteaus, and bags:      Yet at first sight the crew were not pleased with the view,           Which consisted of chasms and crags.       The Bellman perceived that their spirits were low,           And repeated in musical tone      Some jokes he had kept for a season of woe--           But the crew would do nothing but groan.       He served out some grog with a liberal hand,           And bade them sit down on the beach:      And they could not but own that their Captain looked grand,           As he stood and delivered his speech.       “Friends, Romans, and countrymen, lend me your ears!”            (They were all of them fond of quotations:      So they drank to his health, and they gave him three cheers,           While he served out additional rations).       “We have sailed many months, we have sailed many weeks,           (Four weeks to the month you may mark),      But never as yet (’tis your Captain who speaks)           Have we caught the least glimpse of a Snark!       “We have sailed many weeks, we have sailed many days,           (Seven days to the week I allow),      But a Snark, on the which we might lovingly gaze,           We have never beheld till now!       “Come, listen, my men, while I tell you again           The five unmistakable marks      By which you may know, wheresoever you go,           The warranted genuine Snarks.       “Let us take them in order. The first is the taste,           Which is meagre and hollow, but crisp:      Like a coat that is rather too tight in the waist,           With a flavour of Will-o’-the-wisp.       “Its habit of getting up late you’ll agree           That it carries too far, when I say      That it frequently breakfasts at five-o’clock tea,           And dines on the following day.       “The third is its slowness in taking a jest.           Should you happen to venture on one,      It will sigh like a thing that is deeply distressed:           And it always looks grave at a pun.       “The fourth is its fondness for bathing-machines,           Which is constantly carries about,      And believes that they add to the beauty of scenes--           A sentiment open to doubt.       “The fifth is ambition. It next will be right           To describe each particular batch:      Distinguishing those that have feathers, and bite,           And those that have whiskers, and scratch.       “For, although common Snarks do no manner of harm,           Yet, I feel it my duty to say,      Some are Boojums--” The Bellman broke off in alarm,           For the Baker had fainted away.                          Fit the Third                       THE BAKER’S TALE        They roused him with muffins--they roused him with ice--           They roused him with mustard and cress--      They roused him with jam and judicious advice--           They set him conundrums to guess.       When at length he sat up and was able to speak,           His sad story he offered to tell;      And the Bellman cried “Silence! Not even a shriek!”            And excitedly tingled his bell.       There was silence supreme! Not a shriek, not a scream,           Scarcely even a howl or a groan,      As the man they called “Ho!” told his story of woe           In an antediluvian tone.       “My father and mother were honest, though poor--”            “Skip all that!” cried the Bellman in haste.      “If it once becomes dark, there’s no chance of a Snark--           We have hardly a minute to waste!”       “I skip forty years,” said the Baker, in tears,           “And proceed without further remark      To the day when you took me aboard of your ship           To help you in hunting the Snark.       “A dear uncle of mine (after whom I was named)           Remarked, when I bade him farewell--”       “Oh, skip your dear uncle!” the Bellman exclaimed,           As he angrily tingled his bell.       “He remarked to me then,” said that mildest of men,           “‘If your Snark be a Snark, that is right:      Fetch it home by all means--you may serve it with greens,           And it’s handy for striking a light.       “‘You may seek it with thimbles--and seek it with care;           You may hunt it with forks and hope;      You may threaten its life with a railway-share;           You may charm it with smiles and soap--’”       (“That’s exactly the method,” the Bellman bold           In a hasty parenthesis cried,      “That’s exactly the way I have always been told           That the capture of Snarks should be tried!”)       “‘But oh, beamish nephew, beware of the day,           If your Snark be a Boojum! For then      You will softly and suddenly vanish away,           And never be met with again!’       “It is this, it is this that oppresses my soul,           When I think of my uncle’s last words:      And my heart is like nothing so much as a bowl           Brimming over with quivering curds!       “It is this, it is this--” “We have had that before!”            The Bellman indignantly said.      And the Baker replied “Let me say it once more.           It is this, it is this that I dread!       “I engage with the Snark--every night after dark--           In a dreamy delirious fight:      I serve it with greens in those shadowy scenes,           And I use it for striking a light:       “But if ever I meet with a Boojum, that day,           In a moment (of this I am sure),      I shall softly and suddenly vanish away--           And the notion I cannot endure!”                          Fit the fourth                         THE HUNTING        The Bellman looked uffish, and wrinkled his brow.           “If only you’d spoken before!      It’s excessively awkward to mention it now,           With the Snark, so to speak, at the door!       “We should all of us grieve, as you well may believe,           If you never were met with again--      But surely, my man, when the voyage began,           You might have suggested it then?       “It’s excessively awkward to mention it now--           As I think I’ve already remarked.”       And the man they called “Hi!” replied, with a sigh,           “I informed you the day we embarked.       “You may charge me with murder--or want of sense--           (We are all of us weak at times):      But the slightest approach to a false pretence           Was never among my crimes!       “I said it in Hebrew--I said it in Dutch--           I said it in German and Greek:      But I wholly forgot (and it vexes me much)           That English is what you speak!”       “’Tis a pitiful tale,” said the Bellman, whose face           Had grown longer at every word:      “But, now that you’ve stated the whole of your case,           More debate would be simply absurd.       “The rest of my speech” (he explained to his men)           “You shall hear when I’ve leisure to speak it.      But the Snark is at hand, let me tell you again!           ’Tis your glorious duty to seek it!       “To seek it with thimbles, to seek it with care;           To pursue it with forks and hope;      To threaten its life with a railway-share;           To charm it with smiles and soap!       “For the Snark’s a peculiar creature, that won’t           Be caught in a commonplace way.      Do all that you know, and try all that you don’t:           Not a chance must be wasted to-day!       “For England expects--I forbear to proceed:           ’Tis a maxim tremendous, but trite:      And you’d best be unpacking the things that you need           To rig yourselves out for the fight.”       Then the Banker endorsed a blank cheque (which he crossed),           And changed his loose silver for notes.      The Baker with care combed his whiskers and hair,           And shook the dust out of his coats.       The Boots and the Broker were sharpening a spade--           Each working the grindstone in turn:      But the Beaver went on making lace, and displayed           No interest in the concern:       Though the Barrister tried to appeal to its pride,           And vainly proceeded to cite      A number of cases, in which making laces           Had been proved an infringement of right.       The maker of Bonnets ferociously planned           A novel arrangement of bows:      While the Billiard-marker with quivering hand           Was chalking the tip of his nose.       But the Butcher turned nervous, and dressed himself fine,           With yellow kid gloves and a ruff--      Said he felt it exactly like going to dine,           Which the Bellman declared was all “stuff.”       “Introduce me, now there’s a good fellow,” he said,           “If we happen to meet it together!”       And the Bellman, sagaciously nodding his head,           Said “That must depend on the weather.”       The Beaver went simply galumphing about,           At seeing the Butcher so shy:      And even the Baker, though stupid and stout,           Made an effort to wink with one eye.       “Be a man!” said the Bellman in wrath, as he heard           The Butcher beginning to sob.      “Should we meet with a Jubjub, that desperate bird,           We shall need all our strength for the job!”                          Fit the Fifth                     THE BEAVER’S LESSON        They sought it with"]]]
