The elements of truth are befogged in vague and amateurish mysticism, and the subject of individual efficiency when we get beyond mere preaching and moralizing is a chaos of isms.  The time is ripe for a real analysis of these important problems,--a serious and scientific analysis with a clear and practical exposition of facts and principles and rules for conduct.  Men and women must be fundamentally trained so that they can look deep into their own minds and see where the screw is loose, where oil is needed, and so readjust themselves and their living for a greater efficiency.  [Sidenote: The Virus of Failure]  The embittered, the superstitious, the prejudiced, all those who scorpion-like sting themselves with the virus of failure, must be given an antidote of understanding that will repair their deranged mental machinery.  The conscientious but foolish business man who is worrying himself into failure and an early grave must be taught the physiological effects of ideas and given a new standard of values.  The profligate must be lured from his emotional excesses and debaucheries, not by moralizings, but by showing him just how these things fritter his energies and retard his progress.  [Sidenote: Practical Formulas for Every Day]  It must be made plain to the successful promoter, to the rich banker, how a man may be a financial success and yet a miserable failure so far as true happiness is concerned, and how by scientific self-development he can acquire greater riches within than all his vaults of steel will hold.  This _Basic Course of Reading_ offers just such an analysis and exposition of fundamental principles. It furnishes definite and scientific answers to the problems of life. It will reveal to you unused or unintelligently used mental forces vastly greater than those now at your command.  [Sidenote: Your Undiscovered Resources]  We go even further, and say that this _Basic Course of Reading_ provides a practicable formula for the everyday use of these vast resources. It will enable you to acquire the magical qualities and still more magical effects that spell success and happiness, without straining your will to the breaking point and making life a burden. It will give you a definite prescription like the physician's, \"Take one before meals,\" and as easily compounded, which will enable you to be prosperous and happy.  In the development of one's innate resources, such as powers of observation, imagination, correct judgment, alertness, resourcefulness, application, concentration, and the faculty of taking prompt advantage of opportunities, the study of the mental machine is bound to be the first step. It must be the ultimate resource for self-training in efficiency for the promoter with his appeal to the cupidity and imaginations of men as surely as for the artist in his search for poetic inspiration.  [Sidenote: Man's Mind Machine]  No man can get the best results from any machine unless he understands its mechanism. We shall draw aside the curtain and show you the mind in operation.  The mastery of your own powers is worth more to you than all the knowledge of outside facts you can crowd into your head. Read and study and practice the teachings of this _Basic Course_, and they will make you in a new sense the master of yourself and of your future.  In this _Basic Course of Reading_ we shall begin by giving you a thorough understanding of certain mental operations and processes.  [Sidenote: Abjuring Mysticisms]  We shall lead your interest away from \"vague mysticisms\" and emphasize such phases of scientific psychological theory as bear directly on practical achievement.  We shall give you a practical working knowledge of concentrative mental methods and devices. We shall clear away the mysteries and misapprehensions that now envelop this particular field.  In the present volume we shall begin with a discussion of certain aspects of the relation between the mind and the body.  [Sidenote: Psychology, Physiology and Relationships]  However we look at it, it is impossible to understand the mind without some knowledge of the bodily machine through which the mind works. The investigation of the mind and its conditions and problems is primarily the business of psychology, which seeks to describe and explain them. It would seem to be entirely distinct from physiology, which seeks to classify and explain the facts of bodily structure and operation. But all sciences overlap more or less. And this is particularly true of psychology, which deals with the mind, and physiology, which deals with the body.  It is the mind that we are primarily interested in. But every individual mind resides within, or at least expresses itself through, a body. Upon the preservation of that body and upon the orderly performance of its functions depend our health and comfort, our very lives.  [Sidenote: Abode and instrument of Mind]  Then, too, considered merely as part of the outside world of matter, man's body is the physical fact with which he is most in contact and most immediately concerned. It furnishes him with information concerning the existence and operations of other minds. It is in fact his only source of information about the outside world.  First of all, then, you must form definite and intelligent conclusions concerning the relations between the mind and the body.  [Sidenote: Manner of Handling Mental Processes]  This will be of value in a number of ways. In the first place, you will understand the bodily mechanism through which the mind operates, and a knowledge of this mechanism is bound to enlighten you as to the character of the _mental_ processes themselves. In the second place, it is worth while to know the extent of the mind's influence over the body, because this knowledge is the first step toward obtaining bodily efficiency through the mental control of bodily functions. And, finally, a study of this bodily mechanism is of very great practical importance in itself, for the body is the instrument through which the mind acts in its relations with the world at large.  From a study of the bodily machine, we shall advance to a consideration of the mental processes themselves, not after the usual manner of works on psychology, but solely from the standpoint of practical utility and for the establishment of a scientific concept of the mind capable of everyday use.  [Sidenote: Fundamental Laws and Practical Methods]  The elucidation of every principle of mental operation will be accompanied by illustrative material pointing out just how that particular law may be employed for the attainment of specific practical ends. There will be numerous illustrative instances and methods that can be at once made use of by the merchant, the musician, the salesman, the advertiser, the employer of labor, the business executive.  [Sidenote: Special Business Topics]  In this way this _Basic Course of Reading_ will lay a firm and broad foundation, first, for an understanding of the methods and devices whereby any man may acquire full control and direction of his mental energies and may develop his resources to the last degree; second, for an understanding of the psychological methods for success in any specific professional pursuit in which he may be particularly interested; and third, for an understanding of the methods of applying psychological knowledge to the industrial problems of office, store and factory.  The first of these--that is to say, instruction in methods for the attainment of any goal consistent with native ability--will follow right along as part of this _Basic Course of Reading._ The second and third--that is to say, the study of special commercial and industrial topics--are made the subject of special courses supplemental to this _Basic Course_ and for which it can serve only as an introduction.  [Sidenote: A Step Beyond Collegiate Psychology]  In this _Basic Course of Reading_ we shall show you how you may acquire perfect individual efficiency. And, most remarkable of all, we shall show you how you may acquire it _without that effort to obtain it, that straining of the will, that struggling with wasteful inclinations and desires, that is itself the essence of inefficiency_.  The facts and principles set forth in this _Basic Course_ are new and wonderful and inspiring. They have been established and attested by world-wide and exhaustive scientific research and experiment.  [Sidenote: The Eternal Laws of Individual Achievement]  You may be a college graduate. You may have had the advantage of a college course in psychology. But you have probably had no instruction in the practical application of your knowledge of mental operations. So far as we are aware, there are few universities in the world that embrace in their curricula a course in \"applied\" psychology. For the average college man this _Basic Course of Reading_ will be, therefore, in the nature of a post-graduate course, teaching him how to make practical use of the psychology he learned at college, and in addition giving him facts about the mind unknown to the college psychology of a few years ago.  In these books you will probe deeply into the normal human mind.  You will see also the fantastic and distorted shape of its manifestations in disease.  You will learn the Eternal Laws of Individual Achievement.  [Sidenote: How to Master Our Methods]  And you will be taught how to apply them to your own business or profession.  But mark this word of warning. To comprehend the teachings of this _Basic Course_ well enough to put them into practice demands from you careful study and reflection. It requires persistent application. Do not attempt to browse through the pages that follow. They are worth all the time that you can put upon them.  The mind is a complex mechanism. Each element is alone a fitting subject for a lifetime's study. Do not lose sight of the whole in the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13791"],["title","Psychology and Achievement (#2)"],["body","of the parts.  All the books bear upon a central theme. They will lead you on step by step. Gradually your conception of your relations to the world will change. A new realization of power will come upon you. You will learn that you are in a new sense the master of your fate. You will find these books, like the petals of a flower, unfolding one by one until a great and vital truth stands revealed in full-blown beauty.  To derive full benefit from the _Course_ it is necessary that you should do more than merely understand each sentence as you go along. You must grasp the underlying train of thought. You must perceive the continuity of the argument.  It is necessary, therefore, that you do but a limited amount of reading each day, taking ample time to reflect on what you have read. If any book is not entirely clear to you at first, go over it again. Persistence will enable any man to acquire a thorough comprehension of our teachings and a profound mastery of our methods.     TWO LAWS OF SUCCESS-ACHIEVEMENT     CHAPTER II  TWO LAWS OF SUCCESS-ACHIEVEMENT   [Sidenote: The One-Man Business Corporation]  As a working unit you are a kind of one-man business corporation made up of two departments, the mental and the physical.  Your mind is the executive office of this personal corporation, its directing \"head.\" Your body is the corporation's \"plant.\" Eyes and ears, sight and smell and touch, hands and feet--these are the implements, the equipment.  We have undertaken to teach you how to acquire a perfect mastery of your own powers and meet the practical problems of your life in such a way that success will be swift and certain.  [Sidenote: Business and Bodily Activity]  First of all it is necessary that you should accept and believe two well-settled and fundamental laws.  I. _All human achievement comes about through bodily activity._  II. _All bodily activity is caused, controlled and directed by the mind._  Give the first of these propositions but a moment's thought. You can conceive of no form of accomplishment which is not the result of some kind of bodily activity. One would say that the master works of poetry, art, philosophy, religion, are products of human effort furthest removed from the material side of life, yet even these would have perished still-born in the minds conceiving them had they not found transmission and expression through some form of bodily activity. You will agree, therefore, that the first of these propositions is so self-evident, so axiomatic, as neither to require nor to admit of formal proof.  The second proposition is not so easily disposed of. It is in fact so difficult of acceptance by some persons that we must make very plain its absolute validity. Furthermore, its elucidation will bring forth many illuminating facts that will give you an entirely new conception of the mind and its scope and influence.  [Sidenote: The Enslaved Brain]  Remember, when we say \"mind,\" we are not thinking of the brain. The brain is but one of the organs of the body, and, by the terms of our proposition as stated, is as much the slave of the mind as is any other organ of the body. To say that the mind controls the body presupposes that mind and body are distinct entities, the one belonging to a spiritual world, the other to a world of matter.  That the mind is master of the body is a settled principle of science. But we realize that its acceptance may require you to lay aside some preconceived prejudices. You may be one of those who believe that the mind is nothing more nor less than brain activity. You may believe that the body is all there is to man and that mind-action is merely one of its functions.  [Sidenote: First Step Toward Self-Realization]  If so, we want you nevertheless to realize that, while as a matter of philosophic speculation you retain these opinions, you may at the same time for practical purposes regard the mind as an independent causal agency and believe that it can and does control and determine and _cause_ any and every kind of bodily activity. We want you to do this because this conclusion is at the basis of a practical system of mental efficiency and because, as we shall at once show you, it is capable of proof by the established methods of physical science.     RELATION OF MIND ACTIVITY TO BODILY ACTIVITY     CHAPTER III  RELATION OF MIND ACTIVITY TO BODILY ACTIVITY  POINT OF VIEW FROM WHICH YOU MUST APPROACH THIS PROBLEM   [Sidenote: Speculation and Practical Science]  The fact is, one's opinion as to whether mind controls body or body makes mind-action depends altogether upon the point of view. And the first step for us to take is to agree upon the point of view we shall assume.  Two points of view are possible. One is _speculative_, the other _practical_.  [Sidenote: Philosophic Riddles and Personal Effectiveness]  The _speculative point of view_ is that of the philosopher and religionist, who ponder the tie that binds \"soul\" and body in an effort to solve the riddle of \"creation\" and pierce the mystery of the \"hereafter.\"  The _practical point of view_ is that of the modern practical scientist, who deals only with actual facts of human experience and seeks only immediate practical results.  The speculative problem is the historical and religious one of the mortality or immortality of the soul. The practical problem is the scientific one that demands to know what the mental forces are and how they can be used most effectively.  [Sidenote: What We Want to Know]  There is no especial need here to trace the historical development of these two problems or enter upon a discussion of religious or philosophical questions.  Our immediate interest in the mind and its relationship to the body is not because we want to be assured of the salvation of our souls after death.  _We want to know all we can about the reality and certainty and character of mental control of bodily functions because of the practical use we can make of such knowledge in this life, here and now._  [Sidenote: Spiritualist, Materialist and Scientist]  The practical scientist has nothing in common with either spiritualists, soul-believers, on the one hand, or materialists on the other. So far as the mortality of the soul is concerned, he may be either a spiritualist or a materialist But spiritualism or materialism is to him only an intellectual pastime. It is not his trade. In his actual work he seeks only practical results, and so confines himself wholly to the actual facts of human experience.  The practical scientist knows that as between two given facts, and _only_ as between these two, one may be the \"cause\" of the other. But he is not interested in the \"creative origin\" of material things. He does not attempt to discover \"first\" causes.  [Sidenote: Science of Cause and Effect]  The practical scientist ascribes all sorts of qualities to electricity and lays down many laws concerning it without having the remotest idea as to what, in the last analysis, electricity may actually be. He is not concerned with ultimate truths. He does his work, and necessarily so, upon the principle that for all practical purposes he is justified in using any given assumption as a working hypothesis if everything happens just as if it were true.  The practical scientist applies the term \"cause\" to any object or event that is the invariable predecessor of some other object or event.  For him a \"cause\" is simply any object or event that may be looked upon as forecasting the action of some other object or the occurrence of some other event.  The point with him is simply this, Does or does not this object or this event in any way affect that object or that event or determine its behavior?  [Sidenote: Causes and \"First\" Causes]  No matter where you look you will find that every fact in Nature is relatively cause and effect according to the point of view. Thus, if a railroad engine backs into a train of cars it transmits a certain amount of motion to the first car. This imparted motion is again passed on to the next car, and so on. The motion of the first car is, on the one hand, the effect of the impact of the engine, and is, on the other hand, the \"cause\" of the motion of the second car. And, in general, what is an \"effect\" in the first car becomes a \"cause\" when looked at in relation to the second, and what is an \"effect\" in the second becomes a \"cause\" in relation to the third. So that even the materialist will agree that \"cause\" and \"effect\" are relative terms in dealing with any series of facts in Nature.  [Sidenote: A Common Platform for All]  A man may be either a spiritualist, believing that the mind is a manifestation of the super-soul, or he may be a materialist, and in either case he may at the same time and with perfect consistency believe, as a practical scientist, that the mind is a \"cause\" and has bodily action as its \"effect.\"  Naturally this point of view offers no difficulties whatever to the spiritualist. He already looks upon the mind or soul as the \"originating cause\" of everything.  [Sidenote: Thoughts Treated as Causes]  But the materialist, too, may in accordance with his speculative theory continue to insist that _brain-action_ is the \"originating cause\" of mental life; yet if the facts show that certain thoughts are invariably followed by certain bodily activities, the materialist may without violence to his theories agree to the great practical value of _treating these thoughts as immediate causes_, no matter what the history of creation may have been.  Whatever the brand of your materialism or your religious belief, you can join us in accepting this practical-science point of view as a common platform upon which to approach our second fundamental proposition, that \"all bodily activity is caused, controlled and directed by the mind.\"  [Sidenote: Scientific Method with Practical Problems]  Ignoring all religious and metaphysical questions, we have, then, to ask ourselves merely: _Can the mind be relied upon"]]]
