Presently they were out of sight of the shore and the Cricket turned upon his heel and hopped away.                       CRICKETS          The Cricket is the kind of chap         For whom I never cared a rap!         I always thought he hopped about         The fields, because he had the gout         And lost his crutches in the crops,         And that's the reason why he hops.         But now I'll have to change my mind         Because I see he's very kind,         For he who is a friend in need         Is quite the best of friends indeed.  [Illustration]     [Illustration]  CHAPTER V   And Kernel Cob and Sweetclover sailed and sailed for many days and nights.  \"I wonder where we are and if we shall ever be on land again,\" sighed poor little Sweetclover.  \"Of course we will,\" answered Kernel Cob although he, too, was doubtful, but being a soldier he had to keep his courage up and to cheer Sweetclover. So he pretended that they were perfectly safe.  And on they sailed and you couldn't see anything but water for miles and miles, no matter where you looked.  \"What's that?\" said Sweetclover, and she was so excited that she nearly tipped over the boat.  \"I can't see anything but water and a little too much of that to suit me,\" said Kernel Cob.  \"Don't you see something dark against the sky?\" she asked.  \"No, I don't,\" said Kernel Cob, and he shaded his eyes with his hand the way sailors do when they look for something at sea.  \"I hope it isn't a whale,\" said Sweetclover.  \"It had better not be,\" said Kernel Cob, \"if he knows what's good for him,\" and he patted his sword in a very brave manner.  \"It's getting bigger and bigger,\" said Sweetclover. \"Don't you see it?\"  \"Sure!\" said Kernel Cob, \"I saw it all the time, it's a ship.\" And like all people who tell fibs he was found out, for it wasn't a ship at all.  \"It's land!\" said Sweetclover, joyfully, and sure enough it was, for soon you could see the trees. And as they sailed closer the trees grew taller and taller, and after a while you could see the shore.  \"It's a little island,\" said Sweetclover.  \"What's an island?\" asked Kernel Cob.  \"Didn't you ever go to school?\" asked Sweetclover.  \"No, but I wish I had.\"  But Kernel Cob didn't answer. He just steered the shoeboat toward the shore by putting one leg over the side as if it were a rudder, and in a little while they ran the boat up on the shore and Sweetclover hopped out and Kernel Cob pulled the boat up on the beach so the tide, when it came in, wouldn't take it out to sea again.  And they walked along the beach.  \"I'm very hungry,\" said Sweetclover.  \"Sit down here,\" said Kernel Cob, \"and I'll see if I can find something for dinner.\" And he went along the beach.  After he had walked a long distance, he found a tree with some nuts on it, and he picked a lot of them and put them in his hat and started back to Sweetclover.  You may imagine his astonishment when he reached the spot where he had left her and discovered that she was not there.  But, all about on the sand, he saw foot-prints as of a great number of bare footed people.  \"The savages have taken her,\" he muttered, and drawing his sword he ran off in the direction they had taken.  Through the woods he ran, and pretty soon he came to a clearing and there was Sweetclover surrounded by about a thousand savages shouting and dancing and waving spears above their heads. And Kernel Cob grasped his sword firmly in his hand and ran at them, and, so fiercely did he fight, that in a minute he had driven away about a hundred of them. And he would have driven them all away, but his foot slipped and, before he could get up again, he was overpowered and bound hand and foot.  And they brought him before their chief who was a great giant.  And when it was night, the savages tied the two captives to trees and went to sleep about a great fire. And in the middle of the night when Kernel Cob was thinking of some way in which to make their escape, he heard something stirring in the grass at his feet.  \"Who's that?\" he whispered.  \"Tommy Hare,\" was the reply, and he ran out from a stone behind which he had been hiding.  \"Good for you!\" said Kernel Cob. \"Come stand up on your hind legs, like a good fellow, and untie me from this tree.\"  \"Who are you?\" asked Tommy cautiously.  \"I'm Kernel Cob and this is my little friend Sweetclover and we're looking for Jackie and Peggs' motheranfather and we've been captured by the savages who may keep us here forever if you don't help us.\"  \"That I will,\" said Tommy, and in a jiffy he had gnawed them free.  \"Now, show us the way down to the beach as quickly as you can,\" said Kernel Cob, \"for it will be daylight soon and then it will be too late. Come.\"  And they started running as fast as they could.  And not a minute too soon, for they had got only half way when they heard the shouts of the savages and knew that their escape had been discovered.  Faster and faster they ran, but the savages gained on them at every step and were soon close upon their heels.  [Illustration]  \"Jump on my back!\" shouted Tommy, \"for I can run faster than all of them put together.\"  And they did so and flew over the ground as fast as the wind.  And they reached the shore and jumped into the shoeboat and Tommy shoved them off with a great push that put them out of sight of land, and the savages' spears fell in the water behind them.  \"That was a narrow escape,\" said Sweetclover, as she settled down in the boat. \"I hope Tommy Hare wasn't caught by the savages.\"  But she needn't have worried in the least about Tommy, for as soon as he had pushed them off, he scurried away and was at that moment sitting under a tree, eating his breakfast.  [Illustration]     [Illustration]  CHAPTER VI   Kernel Cob and Sweetclover sailed all day. The shoeboat rode the waves with perfect ease. Up it went and up till it came to the top of a great wave, and then it would race down on the other side as if they were bob-sledding and great sport it was, too, out in the middle of the ocean, and Sweetclover laughed and even old serious Kernel Cob smiled and forgot all about fighting.  Toward the afternoon, the sea quieted down and they rode along faster and presently, Sweetclover, who was always watching, cried out:  \"I see another island!\"  \"So it is!\" said Kernel Cob, looking in the wrong direction.  \"Not over there. Look!\" and she pointed.  Sure enough. There was a large black stretch of what appeared to be land. And it was very flat.  \"I hope there will be no more savages to fight,\" said Sweetclover.  \"I hope there will,\" said Kernel Cob.  \"It's moving,\" said Sweetclover. \"It seems to be coming this way.\"  \"Where did it go?\" asked Kernel Cob, for at that moment it disappeared altogether.  \"I'm sure I saw it,\" said Sweetclover. \"Didn't you?\"  But Kernel Cob only frowned and looked serious.  And, in a few minutes, they saw it again, but this time it was very much nearer and bigger and the sun made it look very smooth.  \"It's a whale!\" said Sweetclover.  \"Who cares,\" said he, and drew his sword.  And the turtle, for it was a turtle and not a whale at all, came towards them and it was very large, nearly as big around as an acre. And when it got very near to the boat, its head came up out of its shell and the little shoe boat shook with the waves it made.  And the turtle was just about to snap the boat in its mouth when Kernel Cob swung his sword and with one mighty stroke cut off its head.  \"Ha, ha!\" cried Kernel Cob, but, receiving no reply from Sweetclover, he looked about and found she had fainted.  He found also that the boat was leaking badly from a crack in the side made, no doubt, by the turtle.  Quickly, he lifted Sweetclover and carried her aboard the back of the turtle and laid her gently down, for the shoe was sinking and he was no sooner out of it than it turned over on its side.  \"Not a minute too soon,\" muttered Kernel Cob, \"and now to revive Sweetclover.\" This he soon did and she opened her eyes and looked about in wonder.  \"Where are we?\" she asked.  \"On the old turtle's back,\" laughed Kernel Cob.  \"But we shall never get anywhere now, for we have no sail,\" said Sweetclover. And she began to cry.  \"Crying never did anybody any good,\" said Kernel Cob, \"I wish you would stop.\"  \"I can't help it,\" said Sweetclover, \"I'm miserable.\"  \"What's all this about?\" said a strange voice, and looking about quickly, they saw a sea-horse riding up to them.  \"I am very glad to see you,\" said Kernel Cob.  \"You're just in time to give us a lift on our journey.\"  \"With pleasure,\" whinnied the sea-horse. \"And where might you be going?\"  \"To find Jackie and Peggs' motheranfather,\" said Sweetclover.  \"Well, leap on my back,\" said the Horse, \"and I'll see that you get there if it's in the water.\"  So Kernel Cob got astride the horse and helped Sweetclover to mount behind him.  \"Where are we?\" asked Kernel Cob.  \"Cuba is right over there,\" said the sea-horse pointing with his ear.  \"Well, let's see if they are there, if you please,\" said Sweetclover.  \"Aye, aye, Miss,\" he said, and trotted away as nearly like a real horse as he could.  They had gone along for a couple of hours without mishap when a storm came up. At first the sea-horse paid no attention to the storm, but one great big clap of thunder rang out and a flash of lightning struck so close it startled him.  With a great leap, he started forward, his eyes bulging from his head, and, with a stream of foam flung out from his mouth, he turned and raced through the water at a terrific rate, Kernel Cob and Sweetclover clinging to him with all their strength.  \"He's a runaway,\" shouted Kernel Cob and, sure enough, the horse was mad and nothing could stop him. On and on they raced, but everything must come to an end and along about the afternoon, they saw land in the distance."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14114"],["title","Plutarch's Lives, Volume 2 (of 4) (#1)"],["body","sword-cut on the arm, when Agesipolis, the Spartan king, came to the rescue from the other wing, and most unexpectedly saved the lives of both.  V. After this, the Spartans behaved towards Thebes outwardly as friends and allies, but really viewed with suspicion the spirit and strength of that state. They especially disliked the club presided over by Ismenias and Androkleides, of which Pelopidas was a member, as being of democratic and revolutionary principles. Consequently Archias and Leontidas[4] and Philippus, men of the aristocratic party, wealthy and unscrupulous, persuaded Phœbidas, a Laconian who was passing through the town with an armed force, to seize the Kadmeia[5] by surprise, and, banishing the party that opposed them, establish an aristocratic oligarchy which would be subservient to Sparta.  He was persuaded to do this, and attacked the unsuspecting Thebans during the feast of Thesmophoria. When he gained possession of the height, Ismenias was seized and conveyed to Lacedæmon, and there not long afterwards made away with. Pelopidas, Pherenikus, and Androkleides, with many others, went into exile and were outlawed by proclamation. Epameinondas stayed at home disregarded, not being thought to be a man of action, because of his philosophical habits, nor a man of any power, because of his poverty.  VI. When the Lacedæmonians removed Phœbidas from his command and fined him a hundred thousand drachmas, but nevertheless held the Kadmeia with a garrison, all the other Greeks wondered at their inconsistency, in punishing the doer but approving of the deed; but the Thebans, who had lost their old constitution and were now held in bondage by the party of Archias and Leontidas, had lost all hope of release from their tyrants, who they perceived were merely acting as a guard to the Spartan supremacy in Greece, and therefore could not be put a stop to, unless their enterprise by sea and land could also be checked. However, Leontidas and his party, learning that the exiles were living at Athens, and were popular with the people there, and respected by the upper classes, began to plot against them, and by sending thither men who were unknown to the exiles, they killed Androkleides by stratagem, but failed with the others. There came also despatches from Lacedæmon to the Athenians, ordering them not to take them in nor to meddle in the matter, but to banish the exiles, on the ground that they had been proclaimed to be public enemies by their allies. But the Athenians, who besides their natural and innate kindness were returning a debt of gratitude to the Thebans, who had been main instruments in the re-establishment of their government, and had decreed that if an Athenian should march in arms against the tyrants through Bœotia, no Bœotian should see or hear him, did the Theban exiles no harm.  VII. Now Pelopidas, although one of the youngest of the exiles, yet used to encourage each of them separately, and would make speeches to them all, pointing out that it was both dishonourable and wicked for them to endure to see their country enslaved and garrisoned by foreigners, and, caring only to save their own lives, to shelter themselves behind decrees of the Athenians, and to pay servile court to the orators who had influence with the people. Rather was it, he urged, their duty to run the greatest risk, taking pattern by the courage and patriotism of Thrasybulus, so that, as he once, starting from Thebes, drove out the thirty tyrants from Athens, they also in their turn, starting from Athens, might set Thebes free. When then he prevailed with these arguments, they sent secretly to Thebes to communicate their determination to such of their friends as were left there. They agreed, and Charon, who was the leading man among them, offered his house for their reception, and Phillidas proceeded to act as secretary to the polemarchs, Archias and Philippus. Epameinondas had long been instilling feelings of patriotism into the youth of Thebes; for in the gymnasia he would bid them lay hold of the Lacedæmonians and wrestle with them, and then seeing them pluming themselves on their success, he would upbraid them, telling them that they ought rather to feel ashamed at being, through their own cowardice, in bondage to men whom they so greatly excelled in strength.  VIII. When a day was fixed on for the attempt, the exiles determined that Pherenikus, with the main body, should remain in the Thriasian[6] plain, while a few of the youngest men ran the risk of entering the city; and if anything were to befall these men, the others would take care that neither their parents nor their children should want for necessaries. First Pelopidas volunteered for the attempt, then Mellon and Damokleides and Theopompus, men of the first families, faithful friends to one another, and ever rivals in glory and bravery. Having made up a party of twelve in all, and embraced those who were to stay, and sent a messenger before them to Charon, they set out, dressed in short cloaks, with hounds and carrying stakes for hunting nets, so that no one whom they met on the road might suspect them, but that they might seem to be merely ranging about the country and hunting. When their messenger reached Charon, and told him that they were on their way, Charon did not, even now that the danger was close to him, falter in his determination, but acted like an honourable man, and received them into his house. But one Hipposthenides, not a bad man, but one who loved his country and favoured the exiles, yet proved wanting in that audacity which this emergency, a hazardous one indeed, and the attempt they had in hand, required.  Apparently the importance of the issue with which he was dealing turned him dizzy; he with difficulty grasped the idea that, trusting in the desperate hopes of exiles, these men were in some fashion about to attempt to overthrow the Lacedæmonian government in Thebes, and the power of Sparta. He went quietly home, and sent one of his friends to Mellon and Pelopidas, bidding them put off their design for the present, to go back to Athens, and await a better opportunity. Chlidon was the name of the messenger, and he hurriedly went to his own house, and, leading out his horse, asked for his bridle. His wife was at her wit's end, as she had it not to give him, but she said that she had lent it to a neighbour. Hereupon there was a quarrel, and words of ill omen were used, for his wife said that she wished it might be a bad journey for him, and for those that sent him; so that Chlidon, having wasted a great part of the day in this squabble, and also drawing a bad augury from what had happened, gave up his journey altogether, and betook himself to something else. So near was this greatest and most glorious of his adventures of missing its opportunity at its very outset.  IX. Now Pelopidas and his party changed their clothes with country people, and separating, came into the city by different ways while it was still daylight. There was a strong wind, and the weather was snowy, so that they were the less noticed, as most people had betaken themselves to their houses on account of the storm; but those who were in the plot met them as they entered, and brought them to Charon's house. With the exiles, they amounted to forty-eight in all.  As to their oppressors, Phillidas the secretary, who had been working with the exiles and knew all their plans, having long before invited Archias and his friends to a wine party to meet certain courtesans, intended to endeavour to hand them over to their assailants in as enervated and intoxicated a condition as possible. However before they were very far gone in liquor a rumour was brought to their ears, which, although true, was without confirmation and very vague, to the effect that the exiles were concealed in the city. Though Phillidas endeavoured to change the subject, still Archias sent one of his servants to Charon, ordering him to come instantly. Now it was evening, and Pelopidas and his party were preparing themselves, in the house, and had already got their corslets on, and had girt on their swords. Suddenly, a knock was heard at the door. One of them ran out, and hearing the servant say that Charon had been sent for by the polemarchs, he in great trepidation brought the news to the rest. At once it occurred to all that the plot had been betrayed, and that they all were lost, without even having done anything worthy of their courage. Yet they agreed that Charon should comply with the summons and that he should unsuspiciously present himself before the Spartan chiefs. He was a man of courage, and slow to lose heart, but now he was panic-stricken and terrified lest when so many brave citizens lost their lives, some suspicion of treachery might rest on himself. So, just when he was going, he brought his son from the women's apartments, a boy still, but in beauty and strength surpassing all of his own age, and handed him over to Pelopidas's party, bidding them treat him as an enemy and show no mercy, if they should find _him_ guilty of any deceit or treachery. Many of them shed tears at the feeling shown by Charon, and his noble spirit, and all felt shame, that he should think any of them so base and so affected by their present danger, as to suspect him or even to blame him, and they begged him not to mix up his son with them, but put him out of the way of the coming stroke, that he might be saved and escape from the tyrants, and some day return and avenge his father and his friends. But Charon refused to take away his son, for what life, he asked, or what place of safety could be more honourable to him than an easy death with his father and so many friends? After praying and embracing them all, and bidding them be of good cheer, he went away, taking great pains to adopt a look and tone of voice as different as possible to that of a conspirator.  X. When he came to the door, Archias and Philippus met him and said,"]]]
