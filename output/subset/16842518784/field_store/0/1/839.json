The one noticeable difference between the two was that Frank was high-tempered and quick, whereas Jack was always cool and collected. And this very fact had more than once showed that Jack, while not exactly more dependable, could always be relied upon to keep his head.  While both were skillful in the use of weapons, here was a place where Frank excelled. He was a dead shot with rifle or revolver and was a strong swordsman. Jack was a good shot himself and a skillful fencer, but he was not in Frank's class when it came to the use of sword or firearms.  Upon their last expedition Jack and Frank had acted as first and second officers respectively of the submarine, and both now held the rank of first lieutenant. Their promotions had come deservedly. They had the implicit confidence of Lord Hastings and more than once had offered valuable advice, which Lord Hastings had acted upon.  Now a few words about the progress of the war. The seven seas had for some time, save for the presence of the German submarines, been swept clear of German, Austrian and Turkish fighting ships. Not a one remained at large to prey upon the shipping of the Allies. The real fighting strength of the navies of the three central powers still remained in their own fortified bases, well guarded by mines.  The Allies had established such an effective blockade that none dared to venture forth. So the naval situation was practically at a standstill, where indications pointed to its remaining until the main German fleet, bottled up in Heligoland, and the main Austrian fleet in the Adriatic should summon sufficient courage to sally forth and give battle; and there had been nothing to indicate any sudden action on the part of either.  On several occasions British submarines had penetrated the mine fields and created considerable havoc, and aircraft had dropped bombs from the air. But along these lines the German submarines had been more successful and now were the one real menace confronting the naval supremacy of the Entente powers.  Hundreds of ships, large and small, had fallen easy prey to these under-sea terrors. Big ocean liners, crowded with passengers, non-combatants, had been sent to the bottom with terrible loss of innocent lives. Chief among these tragedies laid to the door of the German submarines was the sinking of the Cunard liner _Lusitania_, in which more than a thousand men, women and children had been drowned.  And, so far as the British public knew, England had taken no steps to combat this under-sea peril. However, as Lord Hastings had told the boys at the opening of this story, Great Britain had taken such steps, and that they were effective was evident from his additional statement that in the neighborhood of a hundred submarines had \"vanished.\"  But this warfare was not to end until the submarine evil had been eradicated. The German under-sea craft must be disposed of so effectively as to preclude further danger to British shipping. And it was in this work that Jack and Frank were soon to play a prominent part.     CHAPTER II.  ON ACTIVE SERVICE AGAIN.   For some reason unknown to Jack and Frank, when morning came, Lord Hastings announced that the start would not be made until after nightfall, at which both lads showed keen disappointment.  \"I'll tell you what you can do,\" said Lord Hastings. \"I'll give you an order for my motorboat and you can go to Gravesend during the day if you care to. I'll meet you there at the Lion Inn to-night at 10 o'clock.\"  Frank was delighted.  \"That's better than hanging around here all day, waiting for night to come,\" he said. \"What do you say, Jack?\"  \"Anything to humor you,\" replied the latter with a smile.  \"Take all your things with you,\" said Lord Hastings; \"and, above all, hang on to that motorboat. Don't let anybody get it away from you.\"  \"We'll hang on to it, never fear,\" replied Frank. \"Come on, Jack.\"  \"Wait a minute,\" ordered Lord Hastings. \"You'll need this written order to get the boat.\"  \"I'd forgotten, sir,\" said Frank.  Lord Hastings scribbled rapidly on a piece of paper, which he passed to Jack.  \"This will fix you up,\" he said. \"Now remember, 10 o'clock sharp.\"  The boys nodded their understanding of this order, saluted and left. Getting their things together, they hurried to the river, where Lord Hastings kept his motorboat; and an hour and a half later they were proceeding slowly down the river.  \"Guess none of the enemy will ever get in here,\" declared Frank, after a careful survey of the river.  \"Guess not,\" replied Jack. \"Look at the boats. You wouldn't think we were at war.\"  \"Not if it wasn't for the warships,\" agreed Frank. \"And there are enough of them to make it hot for any hostile fleet. But it's a wonder to me some of these German submarines haven't taken a little trip up the Thames.\"  \"Mines,\" replied Jack briefly.  \"True,\" said Frank, \"but you will remember we took a pretty long jaunt up the Dardanelles, and passed through the Kiel canal.\"  \"And when you stop to think of it, we're pretty lucky to be here right now,\" returned Jack dryly.  \"Well, so we are, if that's the way you look at it. However, I wouldn't mind having another such chance.\"  \"You'll probably get it.\"  Conversation lagged as the boys took in the scenes about them; and there was little more talk during the trip. They stopped more than once, and, loitering along, it was dark when they neared their destination.  As they would have drawn up to the wharf there was a sudden flash of light--gone in a moment--followed by a dark body that swished by them like a flash.  Frank uttered an exclamation of astonishment.  \"See that?\" he demanded.  \"Yes. What could it have been?\"  \"You've got me, but it's heading toward the open sea. Great Scott! Maybe it's an enemy.\"  \"An enemy?\"  \"Yes; you know how anxious the Germans are over this submarine business. Maybe this fellow has been spying about. May be going to report to a German submarine out there some place.\"  \"Think we had better follow and have a look?\" asked Jack.  \"Believe it would be a good idea. Let's go.\"  Without another word, Jack brought the boat about and headed after the one that had so recently dashed by them. In the darkness ahead there was nothing to be seen.  \"Like looking for a needle in a haystack,\" Jack called to Frank.  \"That fellow can't be up to any good,\" declared Frank. \"He showed no light and was going in a terrible hurry. There's something up.\"  \"Does seem that way,\" agreed Jack.  \"Say! Is this as fast as this thing can go?\" demanded Frank. \"We won't ever get any place this way. Let her out a bit.\"  Jack did so and the little boat seemed literally to fly over the dark water. This terrific speed Jack kept up for some time and then slowed down.  \"We'll bump into something at this rate,\" he said; \"and that would settle the whole business. We must be cautious.\"  \"Cautious!\" repeated Frank. \"We won't find that German being cautious.\"  \"If we weren't cautious, it wouldn't do us any good if we did find him,\" argued Jack. \"First thing you know we would be at the bottom.\"  Frank considered this point a moment.  \"Guess you're right,\" he said at last.  \"Swish!\" went something at this moment, and, turning quickly, Frank saw a dark shape speeding away up the river.  \"Hey! There went one the other way,\" he cried to Jack.  \"That so?\" replied Jack anxiously. \"There is something up here, and I'm going to find out what it is.\"  He slowed down even more, and, striking a match, lighted the searchlight, which, until this moment, he had not deemed advisable.  As the light flashed over the water, the lad made out another small motorboat dead ahead, upon which signs of life became apparent. Jack saw figures gesticulating violently; then the boat headed directly for the one occupied by the two boys.  \"Guns, Frank!\" said Jack quietly. \"They are coming at us.\"  \"Leave it to me,\" replied Frank. \"You run the boat. I'll do the rest.\"  \"Don't shoot unless you have to,\" warned Jack.  Frank made no reply.  Jack kept the light full upon the approaching boat. He could see several oilskin-clad figures and that was all; and then came a hail from the oncoming boat.  \"What do you want here?\"  The query was in English. Jack answered the hail.  \"What are you doing here yourself?\" he demanded. \"We are British officers. I command you to surrender.\"  \"More likely German officers,\" was the response. \"Heave to now. I'm coming aboard you.\"  \"If you do you'll get a warm welcome,\" replied Jack.  He stopped the boat and drew his own revolvers.  \"Stand back!\" he cried, as the other boat came closer.  In the glint of the searchlight the men aboard the other boat made out the boys' uniforms. The boat slowed down and the men talked among themselves.  \"They wear British uniforms,\" said one in a low voice.  \"That's no sign they are English,\" said another.  \"Tell 'em to give the countersign,\" said a third.  Another hail came from the boat.  \"Pass the countersign,\" it said.  \"I don't know any countersign,\" replied Jack, and would have said more, had not a voice from the other boat interrupted him.  \"I thought not; hands up now or you are dead men. Quick!\"  Jack made his decision in a moment. Much as he would have liked to fight it out, he determined upon a wiser course.  \"Hands up, Frank,\" he said quietly. \"They've got the drop on us.\"  He raised his hands in the air.  Not so Frank.  \"They won't get me without a fight,\" declared the lad angrily, and, raising his voice, he cried:  \"Come and get me, if you want me.\"  At the same moment he raised his revolver and fired.  \"Here,\" cried Jack angrily, \"don't be a fool. Give me that gun.\"  He seized Frank's wrist and wrenched the revolver from his grasp.  The latter turned on his chum angrily.  \"What do you mean by that?\" he demanded. \"Have you turned coward, that you surrender to a couple of Germans without a fight?\"  \"I haven'"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14711"],["title","The Boy Allies Under the Sea; Or, The Vanishing Submarines (#2)"],["body","turned crazy,\" replied Jack quietly. \"They are too many for us; that's all.\"  The other boat came alongside now and an officer stepped aboard the boys' craft.  \"Your weapons,\" he said in perfect English.  \"Then please step aboard my boat. You shall be taken to Gravesend at once.\"  \"Gravesend!\" echoed Jack. \"You couldn't take us to a better place. But if you are German, why should you take us there?\"  \"German,\" repeated the man. \"You know we are English. You are the German spies.\"  \"No such thing,\" declared Frank, taking a hand in things. \"We are British officers and we thought you were German spies. That's why I fired at you. We thought you were here to learn the secret of the vanishing submarines.\"  \"Frank!\" cried Jack in warning, but it was too late.  \"The vanishing submarines, eh?\" repeated the stranger. \"So you have given yourselves away. Who but a German spy would be here seeking word of the vanishing submarines?\"  \"But I tell you----\" began Jack.  \"Silence,\" thundered the officer. \"You have betrayed yourselves, and that is enough. I give you my word you shall be shot in the morning.\"  \"Oh, I guess not,\" replied Frank with a laugh. \"I guess Lord Hastings will be able to get us out of this mess.\"  \"Lord Hastings?\"  \"Why, yes, we happen to serve under him; that's all.\"  \"Tell it to the marines,\" replied the man with sarcasm. \"I am not asking you to admit anything, for I know enough now.\"  \"Oh, all right,\" said Frank.  \"Climb into my boat,\" ordered their captor.  The lads complied.  \"Say,\" said Frank, \"this is Lord Hastings' motorboat. He told us not to lose it. Tie it on behind and pull it along, will you?\"  \"We'll pull it along all right,\" replied their captor. \"Now the best thing you fellows can do is to keep quiet.\"  The lads obeyed this gruff command, for they had nothing particular to talk about.  Half an hour later the motorboat docked at Gravesend and the boys were ordered to climb out, which they did, under the noses of their captors' weapons.  \"Where to now?\" asked Frank.  \"Where I tell you,\" was the reply.  Jack was struck by a sudden thought.  \"Will you tell me what time it is, sir?\" he asked the leader of the party which surrounded them.  \"As you ask in such a polite way, I shall do so,\" was the reply. \"I wouldn't tell this other fellow anything. He's too smart.\" He produced his watch, and after a glance at it, said: \"Five minutes to ten.\"  \"By George!\" exclaimed Jack. \"And we were to meet Lord Hastings at the Lion Inn at 10 o'clock.\"  \"I can promise you'll be at the Lion Inn at 10 o'clock,\" replied the leader of the capturing party, \"but whether you will find Lord Hastings there I can't say.\"  \"You mean you are taking us there?\" asked Jack.  \"Exactly.\"  \"That's what I call luck,\" broke in Frank. \"We'll be all right in a few moments now, Jack.\"  \"You'll be all right till in the morning, I can guarantee that,\" growled their captor.  At the door of the inn he motioned them to enter ahead of him. They did so and the first person on whom their eyes rested was Lord Hastings.  \"Well, I see you are on time----\" the latter began, and then broke off as he saw the armed men behind them.  \"Yes, sir, we are on time,\" replied Frank with a smile, \"and we have brought company to see you, sir!\"     CHAPTER III.  A LESSON.   Lord Hastings was on his feet by this time and advanced toward the two lads and their captors.  \"What's the meaning of this?\" he demanded of the man who appeared to be the leader.  \"We caught these fellows scooting down the Thames in a high-power motorboat, sir,\" was the reply. \"They were unable to give a satisfactory account of themselves and one of them took a shot at us. So we brought them here.\"  \"Do you know who they are?\" asked Lord Hastings, smiling a bit to himself.  \"No, sir; but I would take them for a couple of German spies, sir.\"  \"H-m-m,\" muttered Lord Hastings. He stroked his chin a moment and then asked: \"And what do you intend to do with them?\"  \"Turn them over to Colonel Masterson, sir, who will return about midnight. He is stopping here, sir.\"  Lord Hastings seemed to consider the matter a few moments, and then, with a gesture, he turned on his heel, remarking:  \"Well, I can't see that it is any of my business.\"  \"Very good, sir,\" said the boys' captor.  Frank and Jack had remained quiet up to this time, but now the former took a step after his commander, exclaiming:  \"Aren't you going to get us out of this, sir? You can explain that we have done no wrong.\"  Lord Hastings turned toward him.  \"I have this officer's word,\" he said, indicating the boys' captor, \"that you were captured under suspicious circumstances. I thought I knew you--both of you--but it may be that I have been mistaken. Stranger things have happened than for a man to sell out to the enemy. I cannot interfere with the officer in the performance of his duty.\"  \"But, sir----\" began Jack.  Now the officer interrupted.  \"You know them?\" he asked of Lord Hastings.  \"I thought I did,\" was the reply. \"It would seem that I have been mistaken.\"  \"I should say it does,\" said the officer. \"Certainly they were making their way down the river for no good purpose.\"  \"I am afraid I must agree with you. However, I shall not interfere. You may do as you think best with them.\"  \"Very good, sir.\" The officer motioned the boys to precede him to the stairs at the far end of the room. \"Up with you,\" he commanded.  Frank hung back.  \"Prod him up a bit there, men,\" instructed the officer.  A second man advanced and pushed his revolver against Frank's ribs.  \"Move along,\" he commanded gruffly.  \"Now look here----\" began the lad, but Jack interrupted him.  \"Come, Frank, don't be a fool,\" he said.  He led the way up the stairs, and Frank, still grumbling, followed. At the top of the steps the boys were marched into a small room. The door closed behind them and a key turned in the lock.  \"Now,\" said Frank, turning to his friend, \"what is the meaning of all this?\"  \"You know just as much about it as I do,\" was the reply.  \"But a word from Lord Hastings would have settled all this.\"  \"But he didn't give it, did he?\"  \"No, he didn't; and that's what seems so strange. It looks to me as though we are in for a peck of trouble.\"  \"Say! you heard what Lord Hastings said about 'selling out.' Do you think he believes us guilty of such a thing?\"  \"It's hard to tell what a man believes in times like these. Men have been stood up against a wall and shot on less evidence. You remember taking a shot at the other boat, don't you?\"  \"Yes, but----\"  \"'Buts' won't help us any, I'm afraid. I can't account for Lord Hastings' actions, but you may be sure he has good reasons for whatever he does. It may even be true that he suspects us.\"  \"By George! I don't believe that,\" exclaimed Frank.  \"It doesn't seem possible; but still you can't tell.\"  \"But what are we going to do?\"  \"Do? There is nothing we can do. We'll have to stay here until they decide what to do with us. There is nothing else to do.\"  The boys kept up their conversation for some time, and the more they talked the more they became convinced that their plight was more serious than they had at first supposed. It seemed very plain to them now that Lord Hastings must believe in their guilt and that he would not raise a finger in their behalf.  It was after midnight and the boys were still talking when the key again turned in the lock of the heavy door. It swung inward and their captor entered.  \"Down stairs,\" he said briefly, motioning them to march down ahead of him.  The lads obeyed this order.  There was no one in the room below; and the lads sat down before the fireplace to await whatever might transpire.  \"There will be no use trying to escape,\" said their captor. \"The place is surrounded. You would be shot down like dogs. Now just be as comfortable as you can. I have business elsewhere.\"  He wheeled about quickly and disappeared through the door and the lads heard him lock it after him.  \"Well, why are we allowed to sit here in solitary glory?\" asked Frank.  \"Ask me something easy,\" returned Jack. \"We're here; that's all I know about it. However, I don't imagine we shall be here alone very long.\"  And he was right, although the first corner could not possibly have been in his mind, nor the nature of his coming.  Jack's attention was attracted toward the window by a slight squeaky sound. The lad glanced toward it, but no second sound followed immediately.  \"Sounded like some one at the window,\" he said to Frank.  \"I didn't hear anything,\" said the latter.  A moment later the noise came again. Jack sat up straight in his chair.  \"Hear that?\" he asked.  Frank nodded affirmatively.  \"Some one there, all right,\" he agreed.  He made as though to rise, but Jack stayed him.  \"Wait and see what happens,\" he said softly.  Both leaned back in their chairs and seemed to pay no further heed to the window. But without looking each became aware that the window was being raised softly, and clear across the room they could hear the breathing of a man. A foot sounded on the floor and at that moment both boys sprang to their feet and faced the intruder.  Before either could speak, the newcomer laid a finger to his lips in a sign for silence and came toward them.  \"Quick!\" he whispered, when he was close to them. \"Tell me what you have learned. This may be your only chance!\"  Frank and Jack stepped back in astonishment.  \"Tell you what?\" demanded the latter.  \"What you have learned,\" repeated the man. \"About the vanishing submarines. What has happened to them?\"  Noticing the apparently puzzled looks on the faces of the two boys, the man smiled slightly and thrust a hand into his inside vest pocket.  \"I see,\" he whispered. \"You want to be sure it is all right. Here. Look!\" he exhibited a small card. \"My number. Thirty-two. See it?\"  Jack's quick mind took in the situation on the instant.  \"But you are no German,\" he protested.  \"No, I'm English. Name of Davis. But I am in the game for what it's worth, the"]]]
