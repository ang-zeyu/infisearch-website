By the time he reached home he had forgotten almost everything the famous doctor, Aunt Polly Woodchuck, had said to him. About all Mr. Crow could recall of their talk was that Aunt Polly had told him his swollen foot was caused by gout; and that she had given him samples of such food as he might eat, and also such as he mightn't.  He had put the two kinds in different pockets, just as Aunt Polly had suggested. And all he had to do when he was hungry was to look into his pockets and see what food he might safely choose for his meal. Well, Mr. Crow was hungry as a bear by the time he reached his house. And the first thing he did was to feel in his left-hand pocket. He drew forth a kernel of corn.  \"Good!\" he cried. \"That's exactly what I'd like for my dinner. And if Farmer Green hadn't tarred his corn before planting it I know exactly where I'd go.\" Then he thought deeply for a few minutes. \"I'll go over to the corn-crib and see if I can't find some corn on the ground!\" he exclaimed a little later. While he was thinking he ate the sample of corn, without once noticing what he did.  So Mr. Crow flew swiftly to the farm-yard. It happened that there was nobody about. And, luckily, Mr. Crow found enough corn scattered near the door of the corn-crib to furnish him with a good dinner.  The next morning, as soon as it began to grow light (for Mr. Crow was an early riser), he felt in his left-hand pocket once more. And he pulled out an elderberry.  \"That won't do!\" he said. \"It's too early in the season for elderberries.\" But he ate the sample--though he found it rather dry, for it was a last year's berry. And then he fished a bird's egg out of the same pocket. \"My favorite breakfast!\" he remarked. He ate the egg. And at once he started out to hunt for more. Some people say that he robbed the nests of several small birds before he had breakfast enough.  Mr. Crow then proceeded to pass the morning very pleasantly, by making calls on his friends. He enjoyed their surprise at seeing his bandaged foot.  \"I've the worst case of gout Aunt Polly Woodchuck has ever seen,\" he told every one with an air of pride.  When lunch time came, it found Mr. Crow with a hearty appetite. And once more he felt in his left-hand pocket to see what he might have for his meal.  He pulled out a squirming field-mouse. Mr. Crow was about to eat him; but the mouse slipped away and hid in a hollow stump. So Mr. Crow lost him. Then he went soaring off across the pasture. And when he came home again he didn't seem hungry at all. Whatever he may have found to eat, it seemed to satisfy him.  By this time Mr. Crow had quite recovered from the fear that had seized him when he first discovered his swollen foot. And before he went to sleep that night he thought he would take the bandage off his foot and look at it. He had some trouble in removing the bandage. And when he had succeeded in unwinding it he could hardly believe his eyes. His foot was its natural size again!  Old Mr. Crow looked at the bandage. And he saw, clinging to it, a mass of caked mud. He could not understand that.  \"Anyhow, I'm cured,\" he said sadly. He was disappointed, because there were still a good many of his friends to whom he had not yet shown his bandaged foot. \"I don't consider that Aunt Polly Woodchuck is as good a doctor as people say,\" Mr. Crow grumbled. \"Here she's gone and cured my foot almost a week before I wanted her to!\"  And the next day he went over to see the old lady and complain about her mistake.  \"What have you been eating?\" she asked Mr. Crow.  He told her.  \"Ah!\" said Aunt Polly. \"It's your mistake--and not mine. You ate what was in your _left-hand pocket_, instead of what was in the right-hand one. If you had followed my instructions everything would have been all right.\"  Old Mr. Crow felt very much ashamed. There was nothing he could say. So he slunk away and moped for three days.  Though he did not know it, the trouble with his foot was simply this: He had daubed so much tar on his foot, in Farmer Green's cornfield, that the soft earth had stuck to it in a big ball.  Mr. Crow recovered his spirits at last. And neither he nor Aunt Polly Woodchuck ever discovered that he never had gout at all. He forgave her, at last, for having cured his foot too quickly, for the affair gave him something to talk about for a long time afterward. He never tired of telling his friends about the trouble he had had.  But many of the feathered folk in Pleasant Valley grew very weary of the tale before they heard the last of it.     VIII  THE NEW UMBRELLA   Old Mr. Crow was feeling very happy, because he had a new umbrella--the only umbrella that was owned for miles around. And wherever Mr. Crow went, the umbrella went too, tucked snugly under his wing.  There was only one thing that could have made Mr. Crow feel any happier; and that was rain. As soon as it rained he intended to spread the umbrella over his head and go to call upon all of his friends.  But not a drop of rain had fallen for weeks. And so far as old Mr. Crow could judge, there wasn't a single sign of a storm anywhere. Nevertheless, he continued to carry his umbrella every time he stirred away from his house. And although the weather was so dry, he found a good deal of pleasure in showing his umbrella to his neighbors.  Now, old Mr. Crow had a cousin of whom you have heard. His name was Jasper Jay; and he was a great dandy. He always took pride in his handsome blue suit, of which he was very vain.  Being an inquisitive fellow, Jasper Jay was much interested in Mr. Crow's umbrella. Whenever he met Mr. Crow he asked the old gentleman to spread the umbrella; and once Mr. Crow had let Jasper hold it for as long as ten seconds, \"just to see how it felt.\"  After that Jasper Jay could not get the umbrella out of his mind. He began calling at Mr. Crow's house every day; and all the time he was there he never took his eyes off the umbrella.  At last the two cousins met in the woods one day. As usual, Mr. Crow had his umbrella tucked under his wing. But when Jasper asked him to spread it, Mr. Crow refused.  \"I can't keep putting my umbrella up and down,\" he said. \"If I did, the first thing I knew it would be worn out; and then what would happen to me if it should rain?\"  \"You'd get wet,\" said Jasper Jay.  \"Exactly!\" Mr. Crow replied. \"And at my age I might take cold and be very ill, perhaps.\"  \"Where are you going?\" Jasper inquired pleasantly. He was disappointed; but he did not let his cousin see that.  \"I'm on my way to a big meeting of the Crow family,\" the old gentleman replied.  \"And you're taking your umbrella?\" Jasper asked, as if he were greatly astonished.  \"Why--yes!\" Mr. Crow answered. \"You seem surprised.\"  \"I am,\" said Jasper Jay with a sad shake of his head. \"I'd hate to risk it, if I were you. There'll be some rough young fellows there and you're likely to lose your umbrella. I'm afraid they'll take it away from you.\"  Old Mr. Crow looked worried.  \"I don't know what to do,\" he said anxiously. \"It's an important meeting. They're expecting me. And I'm late, as it is. If I go back home and leave my umbrella I'm afraid they'll think I'm not coming.\"  \"I suppose I could help you just this once,\" Jasper Jay remarked. \"Of course, it's not a thing I'd do for everybody. But since you're my cousin, if you want me to do it I'll take care of your umbrella until you come back again.\"  \"Will you wait right here?\" Mr. Crow asked him.  \"Yes!\"  \"Will you promise not to spread the umbrella?\"  At that question Jasper Jay's face fell. But pretty soon he said cheerfully:  \"I promise not to put it up--unless it should rain.\"  Mr. Crow looked carefully at the sky. There was not a cloud to be seen. So he turned to Jasper Jay with a smile and placed the umbrella carefully in his hands.  Then Mr. Crow flew away.  \"It certainly can't rain,\" he said to himself.  Mr. Crow arrived at the meeting quite out of breath. And his friends noticed that he seemed uneasy about something. He kept looking up at the sky and asking everybody what he thought about the weather.     IX  CAUGHT IN THE RAIN   Left alone in the woods with Mr. Crow's umbrella, Jasper Jay had a fine time. First he looked at the umbrella very closely, from the handle to the slender tip. Then he placed it under his wing and strutted back and forth upon the ground, just as he had seen Mr. Crow parade before his friends. And Jasper wished that someone would come along and see him.  But nobody came. So after a while he grew tired of wishing. And the next thing he did was to unfasten the strap that kept the folds of the umbrella wrapped about its stick.  \"I'm not putting it up,\" he told himself. \"I didn't promise I wouldn't do this. I only agreed not to spread the umbrella unless it rained.\"  Just then a low rumble caught his ear.  \"That's thunder!\" he cried. \"I do hope it will rain!\"  In a short time the sky grew dark. And pretty soon great drops came pattering down upon the leaves over Jasper's head.  \"Hurrah!\" he shouted. And then he flew straight up to the very top of a tall tree, where he perched himself on a limb and spread Mr. Crow's umbrella.  Though it was soon raining hard, the rain did not fall any too heavily to please Jasper Jay. He enjoyed the pleasant-sounding patter over his head. And he liked to watch the trickle of the water as it ran off the umbrella and fell upon the leaves beneath him.  Now, while Jasper Jay was having a good time, there was one person who was not enjoying the shower at all--and that was old Mr. Crow. You remember that he had gone to a crows' meeting. And as soon as it began to sprinkle the meeting broke up. Old Mr. Crow was the first one to leave; and he was in a great hurry. He wished he had not left his umbrella with Jasper Jay, for he did not want anybody but himself to use it--especially for the first time. As you know, ever since Mr. Crow had owned his umbrella it had not rained once."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14403"],["title","1001 Questions and Answers on Orthography and Reading (#1)"],["body","letters?_   Those which are produced by the same organs of speech in a similar           position.    75. _Give an example of a Cognate letter._   D is a cognate of T.    76. _What are Quiescent letters?_   Those that are silent.    77. _How many uses have Silent letters?_   Five.    78. _What are they?_   To modify vowels; to modify consonants; to determine           signification; to determine origin; and to distinguish           words of like signification.    79. _What are Explodents?_   Those letters whose sound cannot be prolonged.    80. _Name the Explodents._   B, D, G, J, P, Q, T, and K.    81. _What are the principle organs of speech?_   Lips, teeth, tongue, and palate.    82. _What is meant by Organical division of the consonants?_   Pertaining to those particular organs used in their pronunciation.    83. _Name the Organical divisions._   Labials, Dentals, Linguals, and Palatals.    84. _What are Labials?_   Those letters whose sounds are modified by the lips.    85. _Name them._   B, F, M, P, V, W, and Wh.    86. _What are Dentals?_   Those letters whose sounds are modified by the teeth.    87. _Name them._   J, S, Z, Ch, Sh, Zh, C and G soft.    88. _What are Linguals?_   Those letters whose sounds are modified by the tongue.    89. _Name them._   D, L, N, R, T, Y, and Th.    90. _What are Palatals?_   Those letters whose sounds are modified by the palate.    91. _Name them._   K, Q, X, Ng, C and G hard.    92. _What letters have no Organical classification?_   H, and all the vowels.    93. _What is an Aphthong?_   A silent letter or combination.    94. _How many kinds of Aphthongs?_   Three.    95. _What are they?_   Vowels, Consonants, and Combinations.    96. _What letters are never silent?_   F, J, Q, R, and X.    97. _In what words is V silent?_   Sevennight and twelvemonth.    98. _In what word is Z silent?_   Rendezvous.    99. _What letters are never doubled?_   X and H.    100. _How many words contain all the vowels in regular order?_   Two.    101. _What are they?_   Abstemious and Facetious.    102. _What is a Diphthong?_   Two vowels sounded together in the same syllable.    103. _Name the Diphthongs._   Ou, Ow, Oi, and Oy.    104. _How many sounds do they represent?_   Two.    105. _What are the sounds called?_   Diphthongal sounds.    106. _How many kinds of Diphthongs are there?_   Two.    107. _What are they?_   Separable and Inseparable.    108. _Which ones are Separable?_   Oi and Oy.    109. _What is an Improper Diphthong?_   The union of two vowels in a syllable, one of which is silent.    110. _By what other name are they known?_   Digraph.    111. _How many Digraphs are there?_   Twenty-five.    112. _Name them._   Aa, Ae, Ai, Ao, Au, Aw, Ay, Ea, Ee, Ei, Eo, Eu, Ew, Ey, Ie, Oa,           Oe, Oi, Oo, Ou, Ow, Ua, Ue, Ui, and Uy.    113. _What is a Trigraph?_   A union of three vowels in one syllable, two of which are silent,           or all three representing one sound.    114. _How many Trigraphs are there?_   Eight.    115. _Name them._   Awe, Aye, Eau, Eou, Eye, Ieu, Iew, and Uoi.    116. _What is a Tetragraph?_   Union of four vowels in one syllable.    117. _How many Tetragraphs are there?_   One.    118. _What is it?_   Ueue in the word Queue.    119. _May the terms Digraph, etc., be used with the Consonants?_   They may.    120. _Give example of Consonant Digraph._   Gh, in the word laugh.    121. _Give example of Consonant Trigraph._   Thr, in the word throw.    122. _Give example of Consonant Tetragraph._   Phth, in the word phthisic.    123. _What is a regular Triphthong?_   A vowel trigraph in which all three of the vowels are sounded.    124. _Give an example._   Quoit.
