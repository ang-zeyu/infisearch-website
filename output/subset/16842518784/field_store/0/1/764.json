It is itself too much of a problem to interpret to us the meaning of our life, and make us feel that it is worth the living.\"  In these words Eucken states his conviction that Christianity in its orthodox forms cannot solve the problem of the present. This, however, is not all he has to say concerning religion. He is, in truth, a great believer in religion, and as will be seen, he believes that later it will again step forth in a changed form as \"the fact of facts\" to wield a power perhaps greater than ever before.  As in the case of religion, _Immanent Idealism_ is a theory that gives life an invisible basis, but the invisible has been regarded as that which lies at the root of the present world, and not as a separate higher world outside our own. The Divine it considers not as a personal being apart from the world, but as a power existing in and permeating it, that indeed which gives to the world its truth and depth. Man belongs to the visible world, but inwardly he is alive to the presence of a deeper reality, and his ambition must be to become himself a part of this deeper whole. If by turning from his superficial life he can set himself in the depths of reality, then a magnificent life, with the widest prospects, opens out before him. \"He may win the whole of infinity for his own, and set himself free from the triviality of the merely human without losing himself in an alien world.\" And if he does so, he is led to place greater emphasis upon the high ideals of life than upon material progress. He learns to value the beautiful far above the merely useful; the inner life above mere existence, a genuine spiritual culture above the mere perfecting of natural and social conditions. There is brought into view a new and deeper life in which the emphasis is placed upon the good, the beautiful, and the true. In this way idealism has inspired many men to put forth their energies for the highest aims, has lifted the individual above the narrowness of a life devoted to himself alone, and has produced characters of exceptional beauty and strength. It claims, indeed, to be able to shape the world of man more satisfactorily than religion can, for it has no need for doctrines of the Divine, the Divine being immediately present in the world. But despite its great influence in the past, its power has of late been considerably weakened.  The question of the existence of a deeper invisible reality in the world has become as problematic as the doctrines of religion.  To be a whole-hearted believer in the older forms of idealism it is necessary that the universe be regarded as ultimately reasonable and harmonious, and there must be a belief in the possibilities of great development on the part of the human being. But a serious study of things reveals to us the fact that the universe is not entirely reasonable and harmonious. If it were, then man's effort towards the ideal would be helped by the whole universe, but that is far from being the case; progress means fight, and difficult fight; there is definite opposition to the efforts of man to raise himself. Moreover, there is evil in the world, let pantheists and others say what they will. Eucken refuses to close his eyes to, or to explain away, opposition, pain, and evil--the world is far from being wholly reasonable and harmonious, and idealists must acknowledge this fact. The natural sciences, too, by emphasising the reign of law, tend to limit more and more the possibilities of the human being, ultimately robbing him of all freedom--hence of all possibility of creation. And how can one be an enthusiastic devotee of idealism if he is led to doubt man's power to aim at, fight towards, or even choose the highest?  Idealism was at its height in those red-letter days when a high state of culture had been attained, and great personalities produced masterpieces in art, music, and literature. The progress of the sciences and of man's natural activity has directed the spirit of the age towards material progress; the ideals of mankind tend to become external and superficial, and the interest in the invisible world falls to a minimum.  To some extent, too, idealism breathes of aristocracy--a most unpopular characteristic in a democratic age. Experience shows that man is raised above himself only in rare cases, and that the great things in the realms of art, music, and literature are very largely the monopoly of the few, and these mainly of the leisured classes. Hence the appeal of idealism to certain types of men and women must necessarily be a feeble one.  Then, again, there is the general indifference of mankind to lofty aims; this militates against the power of idealism even more than in the case of religion, for while in the latter there is the idea of a personal God who is pleased or displeased urging men to renewed effort, the teachings of idealism may appear to be mere abstractions, and can, as such, possess little driving-power for the ordinary mind.  Idealism, too, seems to be a mere compromise between religion and a life devoted to sense experience, and like most compromises it lacks the enthusing power of the original ideas.  Finally, the whole theory leaves us in uncertainty--\"that which was intended to give a firm support, and to point out a clear course to our life, has itself become a difficult problem.\"  But Eucken has more to say concerning idealism, even though in a different form from the theories of the past. Indeed, his philosophy is generally classed amongst the idealisms. Eucken makes a great endeavour, however, to avoid the difficulties and objections to the idealistic position; later we shall see that a great measure of success has crowned his efforts.  Having discussed the two solutions that place special stress on the invisible world, he proceeds to deal with the theories which emphasise the relation of the life of man to the material world.  He first treats of _Naturalism_, that solution of the problem that makes the sense experience of surrounding nature the basis of life, subordinating even the life of the soul to the level of the natural, material world.  Nature in the early ages had been superficially explained, often in the light of religious doctrine. Man gave to nature a variety of explanations and of colouring, depending largely upon his ideas of the place of nature in relation to himself and to the invisible world. But such anthropomorphic explanations could not long survive the progress of the sciences, for a scientific comprehension of nature could only be attained by getting rid of all human colouring, and by investigating nature entirely by itself, out of all relation to the human soul. Man then investigated nature more and more as an object apart from himself.  The first result of these investigations was to impress upon him the reality of nature as something independent, and to increase on a very large scale his knowledge of, and control over nature. When man began to formulate and understand nature, he began, too, to invent machines to profit from the knowledge he gained. Hence followed a marvellously fruitful period of human activity, an activity which at first strengthened man in his own soul, and gave him increased consciousness of independence and power. While he was compelled to admit the greatness of the natural world, he became more and more convinced that he himself was far greater, for could he not put the laws of nature to his own use and profit? Hence the gain to man at this stage of the development of the sciences was very great, for he had come to appreciate more than before the superiority of the human soul over the material world. Hence resulted a more robust type of life, \"a life energetic, masculine, pressing forward unceasingly.\" Matters, however, were not destined to remain long at this stage. As man's knowledge of the processes of nature increased further, a twofold result followed. On the one hand, the sense world of nature became increasingly absorbing in interest; on the other hand, laws were formulated and nature was conceived of as being a chain of cause and effect, a combination of mechanical elements whose interactions were according to law, and could be foretold with the utmost precision.  These two factors worked in the same direction, namely, that of rendering less necessary the conception of a spiritual world. The interest of mankind became so concentrated upon material things that the interest in the invisible decreased, while the mechanical, soulless elements with their ceaseless actions and reactions in definite order, and according to inviolable law, were held sufficient to account for the phenomena of nature. The keynote was \"relation to environment\"; a constantly changing environment, changing according to law, called for ceaseless readjustment, and the adaptation to environment was held to be the stimulus to all activity in the natural world.  The later development of biology, and the doctrine of the evolution of species, gradually extended this conception of nature to include man himself.  What he had regarded as his distinctive characteristics were held to be but the product of natural factors, and his life was regarded, too, as under the domain of rigid, inviolable law. There was no room for, and no need of, the conception of free, originative thought. Thought was simply an answer to the demand that the sense world was making, entirely dependent upon the external stimulus, just as any other activity was entirely dependent on an external stimulus. So thought came to be regarded as resulting from mere sense impression, which latter corresponded to the external stimulus. It is obvious that the idea of the freedom of the human soul, and of human personality as previously understood, had to go. Man was simply the result of the interaction of numerous causes--and like the rest of nature, involved no independent spiritual element.

The very denseness of the darkness of the age in which he came makes the clearness of the light more wonderful, and accounts for the joy with which it was received and the rapidity with which it spread.  Not to enter into the niceties of chronological questions, the mission of Buddha may be roughly said to have commenced about five hundred years before the commencement of our era, and with incessant labors and long and repeated journeys to have lasted forty-five years, when at about the age of eighty he died, or, as the Buddhists more truthfully and more beautifully say, entered Nirvana.

Here the great Buddhist development first comes in contact with authentic history during the third century B.C. in the reign of the great Asoka, the discovery of whose rock inscriptions shed such a flood of light on primitive Buddhism, while it still retained enough of its primitive power, as we learn from those inscriptions themselves, to turn that monarch from a course of cruel tyranny, and, as we learn from the history of Ceylon, to induce his son and daughter to abandon royalty and become the first missionaries to that beautiful island.  H.T.N.       INTRODUCTION.    The golden age--when men were brothers all,   The golden rule their law and God their king;   When no fierce beasts did through the forests roam,   Nor poisonous reptiles crawl upon the ground;   When trees bore only wholesome, luscious fruits,   And thornless roses breathed their sweet perfumes;   When sickness, sin and sorrow were unknown,   And tears but spoke of joy too deep for words;   When painless death but led to higher life,   A life that knows no end, in that bright world   Whence angels on the ladder Jacob saw,   Descending, talk with man as friend to friend--   That age of purity and peace had passed,   But left a living memory behind,   Cherished and handed down from sire to son   Through all the scattered peoples of the earth,   A living prophecy of what this world,   This sad and sinful world, might yet become.    The silver age--an age of faith, not sight--   Came next, when reason ruled instead of love;   When men as through a glass but darkly saw   What to their fathers clearly stood revealed   In God's own light of love-illumined truth,   Of which the sun that rising paints the east,   And whose last rays with glory gild the west,   Is but an outbirth.  Then were temples reared,   And priests 'mid clouds of incense sang His praise   Who out of densest darkness called the light,   And from His own unbounded fullness made   The heavens and earth and all that in them is.   Then landmarks were first set, lest men contend   For God's free gifts, that all in peace had shared.   Then laws were made to govern those whose sires   Were laws unto themselves.  Then sickness came,   And grief and pain attended men from birth to death.   But still a silver light lined every cloud,   And hope was given to cheer and comfort men.    The brazen age, brilliant but cold, succeeds.   This was an age of knowledge, art and war,   When the knights-errant of the ancient world,   Adventures seeking, roamed with brazen swords   Which by a wondrous art--then known, now lost--   Were hard as flint, and edged to cut a hair   Or cleave in twain a warrior armor-clad   And armed with shields adorned by Vulcan's art,   Wonder of coming times and theme for bards.[1]   Then science searched through nature's heights and depths.   Heaven's canopy thick set with stars was mapped,   The constellations named, and all the laws searched out   That guide their motions, rolling sphere on sphere.[2]   Then men by reasonings piled up mountain high   Thought to scale heaven, and to dethrone heaven's king,   Whose imitators weak, with quips and quirks   And ridicule would now destroy all sacred things.   This age great Homer and old Hesiod sang,   And gods they made of hero, artist, bard.    At length this twilight of the ages fades,   And starless night now sinks upon the world--   An age of iron, cruel, dark and cold.   On Asia first this outer darkness fell,   Once seat of paradise, primordial peace,   Perennial harmony and perfect love.   A despot's will was then a nation's law;   An idol's car crushed out poor human lives,   And human blood polluted many shrines.   Then human speculation made of God   A shoreless ocean, distant, waveless, vast,   Of truth that sees not and unfeeling love,   Whence souls as drops were taken back to fall,   Absorbed and lost, when, countless ages passed,   They should complete their round as souls of men,   Of beasts, of birds and of all creeping things.   And, even worse, the cruel iron castes,   One caste too holy for another's touch,   Had every human aspiration crushed,   The common brotherhood of man destroyed,   And made all men but Pharisees or slaves.   And worst of all--and what could e'en be worse?--   Woman, bone of man's bone, flesh of his flesh,   The equal partner of a double life,   Who in the world's best days stood by his side   To lighten every care, and heighten every joy,   And in the world's decline still clung to him,   She only true when all beside were false,   When all were cruel she alone still kind,   Light of his hearth and mistress of his home,   Sole spot where peace and joy could still be found--   Woman herself cast down, despised was made   Slave to man's luxury and brutal lust.   Then war was rapine, havoc, needless blood,   Infants impaled before their mothers' eyes,   Women dishonored, mutilated, slain,   Parents but spared to see their children die.   Then peace was but a faithless, hollow truce,   With plots and counter-plots; the dagger's point   And poisoned cup instead of open war;   And life a savage, grim conspiracy   Of mutual murder, treachery and greed.   O dark and cruel age!  O cruel creeds!   O cruel men!  O crushed and bleeding hearts,   That from the very ground in anguish cry:   \"Is there no light--no hope--no help--no God?\"   [1]See Hesiod's description of the shield of Hercules, the St. George of that ancient age of chivalry.

Northward from Ganges' stream and India's plains   An ancient city crowned a lofty hill,   Whose high embattled walls had often rolled   The surging, angry tide of battle back.   Walled on three sides, but on the north a cliff,   At once the city's quarry and its guard,   Cut out in galleries, with vaulted roofs[1]   Upborne upon cyclopean columns vast,   Chiseled with art, their capitals adorned   With lions, elephants, and bulls, life size,   Once dedicate to many monstrous gods   Before the Aryan race as victors came,   Then prisons, granaries and magazines,   Now only known to bandits and wild beasts.   This cliff, extending at each end, bends north,   And rises in two mountain-chains that end   In two vast snow-capped Himalayan peaks,   Between which runs a glittering glacial stream,   A mighty moving mass of crystal ice,   Crushing the rocks in its resistless course;   From which bursts forth a river that had made   Of all this valley one great highland lake,   Which on one side had burst its bounds and cut   In myriad years a channel through the rock,   So narrow that a goat might almost leap   From cliff to cliff--these cliffs so smooth and steep   The eagles scarce could build upon their sides;   This yawning chasm so deep one scarce could hear   The angry waters roaring far below.    This stream, guided by art, now fed a lake   Above the city and behind this cliff,   Which, guided thence in channels through the rock,   Fed many fountains, sending crystal streams   Through every street and down the terraced hill,   And through the plain in little silver streams,   Spreading the richest verdure far and wide.[2]   Here was the seat of King Suddhodana,   His royal park, walled by eternal hills,   Where trees and shrubs and flowers all native grew;   For in its bounds all the four seasons met,   From ever-laughing, ever-blooming spring   To savage winter with eternal snows.   Here stately palms, the banyan's many trunks,   Darkening whole acres with its grateful shade,   And bamboo groves, with graceful waving plumes,   The champak, with its fragrant golden flowers,   Asokas, one bright blaze of brilliant bloom,   The mohra, yielding food and oil and wine,   The sacred sandal and the spreading oak,   The mountain-loving fir and spruce and pine,   And giant cedars, grandest of them all,   Planted in ages past, and thinned and pruned   With that high art that hides all trace of art,[3]   Were placed to please the eye and show their form   In groves, in clumps, in jungles and alone.
