Though these books were subsequently destroyed in a big fire that demolished the entire street, luckily for him, he had sent his MS. to the publishers, Messrs. Bettesworth and Batley, a week or so before the conflagration broke out; so that he was, at any rate, spared the loss of his own arduous and invaluable work.  The publishers did not accept the MS. at once. At that time there were very severe laws in operation against anything savouring of witchcraft and magic, and as the manuscript dealt at length with these subjects, and in a manner that left no doubt whatever that he, Thomas Maitland, had practised sorcery extensively, Messrs. Bettesworth and Batley were forced to consider whether it would be injurious to them to publish it. Mrs. Bettesworth was eventually consulted--as indeed she always was, on extraordinary occasions--and her interest in the MS. being roused, she decided in its favour. Within a week of its publication, however, it was suppressed by law; all the copies saving three presentation ones to the author, which he successfully concealed, were destroyed; Messrs. Bettesworth and Batley were put in the stocks on Ludgate Hill and fined heavily, and he, Thomas Maitland, was ordered to be arrested, flogged and imprisoned.  \"But,\" wrote Maitland, \"I was not to be caught napping. My previous adventures and hairbreadth escapes had rendered me unusually wary, and perceiving a number of people, among whom were two or three sheriff's officers, approaching my house, I at once interpreted their mission, and climbing through a trap-door leading on to the roof of the building, nimbly made my way to the end of the row, and slipping down a waterpipe easily eluded my enemies. London, however, being now too hot to hold me, I booked passage on board the _Peterkin_, a Thames trading vessel of some eighty tons, and sailed for Boston. My flight had been so hasty that I brought very little with me--nothing in fact except the clothes I stood in--a stout winter suit of home-spun brown cloth, a cloak, and a pair of good, strong leather leggings--a purse of fifty sovereigns (all I had), a knife, pistol and two copies of my precious book, the third copy, alas! I had left behind in my hurry.\"  After giving a few unimportant details as to his life on board ship, Maitland went on to say:--  \"Owing to a succession of storms the _Peterkin_ was driven out of her course, and after narrowly escaping being dashed to pieces on the Florida reefs, Lat. 24-1/2° N., Long. 82° W., we ran ashore with the loss of only two lives--the second mate and cabin boy--on the Isthmus of Yucatan, close to the estuary of a river.[1] Here we were forced to spend nearly a year, during which time I made several journeys of exploration into the interior of the continent. In the course of one of my rambles amid a dense mass of tropical foliage, I suddenly found myself face to face with a gigantic stone Sphinx, which I at once recognized and identified. It was Tat-Nuada, an Atlantean deity, elaborately described in one of the burned books. Much excited, I set to work, and, after clearing the base of the idol of fungi and other vegetable growth adhering to it, discovered a superscription in Atlantean dialect to the effect that the image had been set up there by one Hullir--to commemorate the destruction of Atlantis, of which catastrophe Hullir believed himself and his family, _i.e._ his wife Ozilmeave and daughters, Taramoo and Nikétoth, and the crew of his yacht, the _Chaac-molré_ (ten in number), the sole survivors.  \"Here, then, to my unutterable joy, was strong corroborative evidence of the great disaster narrated in detail in the manuscripts I had found in Inisturk Island. The existence of Atlantis was now thoroughly substantiated. On all sides of me I stumbled across further evidences of these early settlers. Here, standing in bold outline on a slight eminence, was a stone edifice adorned with symbolical carvings of eggs, harps, mastodons, triangles, and numerous other objects, all of which were capable of interpretation, and indicated that the building was a temple to some god.  \"I was much struck by the extraordinary similarity in many of the things I saw--notably in the sphinx, idols and symbols--to many I had seen in Egypt, and to some extent in Ireland, and I at once set to work to draw up a careful analogy between the languages of those countries.  \"The word Banchicheisi[2] I found to contain the Celtic ban, a barrow; and Coptic isi, plenty; whilst I recognized in the words Coulmenes,[3] the Celtic Coul, a man's name, _i.e._ Finn, son of Coul; in Thottirnanoge, the Coptic Thoth, _i.e._ name of ancient Egyptian deity, and Erse Tirnanoge, the name of the wife of Oisin, the last of the Feni; in Chaac-molrée[4] the Coptic deity, ré; in Ozilmeave,[5] the Celtic Meave, a girl's name; in Taramoo,[6] the Celtic Tara, a girl's name; and in Nikétoth,[7] toth, the Erse technical form of feminine gender; and comparing the alphabets I traced a very striking likeness between the Atlantean--  \"[Atlantean: a] (a) and the Gaelic or Erse [Erse: A] [Atlantean: B] (B) and the Coptic [Coptic: B] [Atlantean: d] (d) and Erse [Erse: D] [Atlantean: g] (g) and Erse [Erse: g] [Atlantean: T] (T) and Coptic [Coptic: T]  \"and many of the other letters. To the Atlantean  \"[Atlantean: C, O, E, Z][8]  \"I could, however, find no likeness.  \"From all these similarities, _i.e._ in architecture, symbols, letters, and words, I could come to no other conclusion than that there was some strong connecting link between Atlantis and ancient Ireland and Egypt.  \"Assuredly this great link could not have been merely due to stray survivors of the great catastrophe! Was it not much more probable that the earliest inhabitants of Ireland and Egypt had originally migrated from Atlantis, carrying its language, and ways and customs with them? Moreover, since the Atlanteans were so deeply versed in magic and everything appertaining to the occult, this migration would account for the mysticism that has always been so closely associated with Egypt and Ireland, and for the psychic faculty so strongly observable in the inhabitants of these two countries.  \"I was highly satisfied--I had proved much and my discoveries had upset many of the theories advanced by the modern sages. I could now positively assert that the wisdom of the world came not from the East but from the West. It was to the golden West--to Banchicheisi, capital of Atlantis, that humanity owed its knowledge of the sciences and arts, and of all things good and evil. Eden, if Eden existed at all, was not in Asia, it was in Atlantis; and the Deluge, that is recorded in the Hebrew Bible, and is traditional in the histories of nearly every tribe and nation, was none other than the mighty inrush of the ocean over Atlantis, due to some abnormal submarine earthquake.  \"Of what eventually became of the Atlanteans whose relics I had so opportunely alighted upon, I could only surmise.  \"The last record I found was on a tablet set up by Nikétoth. On this she spoke of the death of Hullir and Ozilmeave, of the inter-marriage of the crew of the _Chaac-molré_ with native women; of the consequent growth of the colony; and of her determination to leave it, and, accompanied by a chosen few, to push her way further inland.[9]  \"The anxiety of my comrades to leave the continent, perforce put an end to my explorations, and in the beginning of the year 1692--exactly ten months after our landing--the _Peterkin_ was refloated.  \"This time nothing happened to impede our progress, and in April of the same year, we sighted Boston. Here I remained for some months, making many new friends, and studying magic and sorcery. But the love of travel had laid so strong a hold on me that I again took to a roving life. I set sail for Spain in November 1692; landed at Corunna, and made my way to Madrid, where I arrived on January 1, 1693.\"  For the rest, Hamar had to turn to Messrs. Fox and Pool's addendum, _i.e._ the footnote that Matt Kelson had read aloud.  Hamar was now inclined to regard the book in a very different light. What he had read seemed to him to be set down in too simple, straightforward, and, at the same time, detailed a manner to be other than true. Up to the present he had not believed in ghosts and witches, for the very simple reason that--like all sceptics--he had never inquired into the testimony respecting them. He had pooh-poohed the subject, because every one he knew pooh-poohed it, and also because it had never seemed worth his while to do otherwise. But provided he thought it would pay him, he was ready to believe in anything--in Christianity, Mahommedanism, Buddhism, Theosophy, or any other creed; and granted the book he had in his hands was really written by Maitland, and Maitland was _bona fide_ (which Hamar saw no reason to doubt), and granted, also, that Maitland was sane and logical--which from his writing he certainly appeared to be--then there was a certain amount in the volume that in Hamar's opinion was \"a find.\" Needless to say, he referred to the magic of the Atlanteans--the art through the practice of which they had got in touch with the Powers that could endow them with riches. The actual history of Atlantis--once he was satisfied there had been such a place--did not interest him. He skimmed through it quickly, and I append a brief summary, only, for the benefit of more intelligent and disinterested readers.  The Atlanteans were the oldest intelligent race in the world--they existed contemporaneously with Paleolithic man, with whom their mariners and explorers frequently came in contact, and about whom their novelists wrote the most delightful stories, just as Fenimore Cooper and Mayne Reid, in these days, have written the most delightful stories about the Red Indians. In religion they were polytheists; they believed that, in the work of Creation, many Powers participated; that some of these Powers were benevolent, some"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14328"],["title","The Consolation of Philosophy (#1)"],["body","true nature; (2) he      knows not the end towards which the whole universe tends; (3) he      knows not the means by which the world is governed.     BOOK I.    SONG I.  BOETHIUS' COMPLAINT.       Who wrought my studious numbers       Smoothly once in happier days,     Now perforce in tears and sadness       Learn a mournful strain to raise.     Lo, the Muses, grief-dishevelled,       Guide my pen and voice my woe;     Down their cheeks unfeigned the tear drops       To my sad complainings flow!     These alone in danger's hour       Faithful found, have dared attend     On the footsteps of the exile       To his lonely journey's end.     These that were the pride and pleasure       Of my youth and high estate     Still remain the only solace       Of the old man's mournful fate.     Old? Ah yes; swift, ere I knew it,       By these sorrows on me pressed     Age hath come; lo, Grief hath bid me       Wear the garb that fits her best.     O'er my head untimely sprinkled       These white hairs my woes proclaim,     And the skin hangs loose and shrivelled       On this sorrow-shrunken frame.     Blest is death that intervenes not       In the sweet, sweet years of peace,     But unto the broken-hearted,       When they call him, brings release!     Yet Death passes by the wretched,       Shuts his ear and slumbers deep;     Will not heed the cry of anguish,       Will not close the eyes that weep.     For, while yet inconstant Fortune       Poured her gifts and all was bright,     Death's dark hour had all but whelmed me       In the gloom of endless night.     Now, because misfortune's shadow       Hath o'erclouded that false face,     Cruel Life still halts and lingers,       Though I loathe his weary race.     Friends, why did ye once so lightly       Vaunt me happy among men?     Surely he who so hath fallen       Was not firmly founded then.    I.   While I was thus mutely pondering within myself, and recording my sorrowful complainings with my pen, it seemed to me that there appeared above my head a woman of a countenance exceeding venerable. Her eyes were bright as fire, and of a more than human keenness; her complexion was lively, her vigour showed no trace of enfeeblement; and yet her years were right full, and she plainly seemed not of our age and time. Her stature was difficult to judge. At one moment it exceeded not the common height, at another her forehead seemed to strike the sky; and whenever she raised her head higher, she began to pierce within the very heavens, and to baffle the eyes of them that looked upon her. Her garments were of an imperishable fabric, wrought with the finest threads and of the most delicate workmanship; and these, as her own lips afterwards assured me, she had herself woven with her own hands. The beauty of this vesture had been somewhat tarnished by age and neglect, and wore that dingy look which marble contracts from exposure. On the lower-most edge was inwoven the Greek letter [Greek: P], on the topmost the letter [Greek: Th],[A] and between the two were to be seen steps, like a staircase, from the lower to the upper letter. This robe, moreover, had been torn by the hands of violent persons, who had each snatched away what he could clutch.[B] Her right hand held a note-book; in her left she bore a staff. And when she saw the Muses of Poesie standing by my bedside, dictating the words of my lamentations, she was moved awhile to wrath, and her eyes flashed sternly. 'Who,' said she, 'has allowed yon play-acting wantons to approach this sick man--these who, so far from giving medicine to heal his malady, even feed it with sweet poison? These it is who kill the rich crop of reason with the barren thorns of passion, who accustom men's minds to disease, instead of setting them free. Now, were it some common man whom your allurements were seducing, as is usually your way, I should be less indignant. On such a one I should not have spent my pains for naught. But this is one nurtured in the Eleatic and Academic philosophies. Nay, get ye gone, ye sirens, whose sweetness lasteth not; leave him for my muses to tend and heal!' At these words of upbraiding, the whole band, in deepened sadness, with downcast eyes, and blushes that confessed their shame, dolefully left the chamber.  But I, because my sight was dimmed with much weeping, and I could not tell who was this woman of authority so commanding--I was dumfoundered, and, with my gaze fastened on the earth, continued silently to await what she might do next. Then she drew near me and sat on the edge of my couch, and, looking into my face all heavy with grief and fixed in sadness on the ground, she bewailed in these words the disorder of my mind:  FOOTNOTES:  [A] [Greek: P] (P) stands for the Political life, the life of action; [Greek: Th] (Th) for the Theoretical life, the life of thought.  [B] The Stoic, Epicurean, and other philosophical sects, which Boethius regards as heterodox. See also below, ch. iii., p. 14.    SONG II.  HIS DESPONDENCY.       Alas! in what abyss his mind       Is plunged, how wildly tossed!     Still, still towards the outer night       She sinks, her true light lost,     As oft as, lashed tumultuously     By earth-born blasts, care's waves rise high.      Yet once he ranged the open heavens,       The sun's bright pathway tracked;     Watched how the cold moon waxed and waned;       Nor rested, till there lacked     To his wide ken no star that steers     Amid the maze of circling spheres.      The causes why the blusterous winds       Vex ocean's tranquil face,     Whose hand doth turn the stable globe,       Or why his even race     From out the ruddy east the sun     Unto the western waves doth run:      What is it tempers cunningly       The placid hours of spring,     So that it blossoms with the rose       For earth's engarlanding:     Who loads the year's maturer prime     With clustered grapes in autumn time:      All this he knew--thus ever strove       Deep Nature's lore to guess.     Now, reft of reason's light, he lies,       And bonds his neck oppress;     While by the heavy load constrained,     His eyes to this dull earth are chained.    II.   'But the time,' said she, 'calls rather for healing than for lamentation.' Then, with her eyes bent full upon me, 'Art thou that man,' she cries, 'who, erstwhile fed with the milk and reared upon the nourishment which is mine to give, had grown up to the full vigour of a manly spirit? And yet I had bestowed such armour on thee as would have proved an invincible defence, hadst thou not first cast it away. Dost thou know me? Why art thou silent? Is it shame or amazement that hath struck thee dumb? Would it were shame; but, as I see, a stupor hath seized upon thee.' Then, when she saw me not only answering nothing, but mute and utterly incapable of speech, she gently touched my breast with her hand, and said: 'There is no danger; these are the symptoms of lethargy, the usual sickness of deluded minds. For awhile he has forgotten himself; he will easily recover his memory, if only he first recognises me. And that he may do so, let me now wipe his eyes that are clouded with a mist of mortal things.' Thereat, with a fold of her robe, she dried my eyes all swimming with tears.    SONG III.  THE MISTS DISPELLED.       Then the gloom of night was scattered,       Sight returned unto mine eyes.     So, when haply rainy Caurus       Rolls the storm-clouds through the skies,     Hidden is the sun; all heaven       Is obscured in starless night.     But if, in wild onset sweeping,       Boreas frees day's prisoned light,     All suddenly the radiant god outstreams,     And strikes our dazzled eyesight with his beams.    III.   Even so the clouds of my melancholy were broken up. I saw the clear sky, and regained the power to recognise the face of my physician. Accordingly, when I had lifted my eyes and fixed my gaze upon her, I beheld my nurse, Philosophy, whose halls I had frequented from my youth up.  'Ah! why,' I cried, 'mistress of all excellence, hast thou come down from on high, and entered the solitude of this my exile? Is it that thou, too, even as I, mayst be persecuted with false accusations?'  'Could I desert thee, child,' said she, 'and not lighten the burden which thou hast taken upon thee through the hatred of my name, by sharing this trouble? Even forgetting that it were not lawful for Philosophy to leave companionless the way of the innocent, should I, thinkest thou, fear to incur reproach, or shrink from it, as though some strange new thing had befallen? Thinkest thou that now, for the first time in an evil age, Wisdom hath been assailed by peril? Did I not often in days of old, before my servant Plato lived, wage stern warfare with the rashness of folly? In his lifetime, too, Socrates, his master, won with my aid the victory of an unjust death. And when, one after the other, the Epicurean herd, the Stoic, and the rest, each of them as far as in them lay, went about to seize the heritage he left, and were dragging me off protesting and resisting, as their booty, they tore in pieces the garment which I had woven with my own hands, and, clutching the torn pieces, went off, believing that the whole of me had passed into their possession. And some of them, because some traces of my vesture were seen upon them, were destroyed through the mistake of the lewd multitude, who falsely deemed them to be my disciples. It may be thou knowest not of the banishment of Anaxagoras, of the poison draught of Socrates, nor of Zeno's torturing, because these things happened in a distant country; yet mightest thou have learnt the fate of Arrius, of Seneca, of Soranus, whose stories are neither old nor unknown to fame. These men were brought to destruction for no other reason than that, settled as they were in my principles, their lives were a manifest contrast to the ways of the wicked. So there is nothing thou shouldst wonder at, if on the seas of this life we"]]]
