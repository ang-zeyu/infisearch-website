Oh, I say!\" he suggested loudly, and sought safety by slipping rapidly down his side of the wall, scratching his hands and bare knees as he fell.  This fine triumph had been at a cost. Archie surveyed himself. His new suit was clearly disreputable. And, in his mother's eyes, the one crime punishable by whipping was to make a new suit disreputable. The more he studied the extent of the damage, the more he felt convinced that, in the expiation of this potty little offence, his body would be commandeered to play a painful and rather passive part.  His brain, therefore, worked rapidly and well. It was more than possible, thought he, that his mother's sympathy could be induced to exceed her indignation. She was really an affectionate woman; and this was the line to go upon. So he squeezed the scratches in his knees to expedite the issue of blood, and bravely entered the house.  \"Mother,\" he called, introducing suitable pathos into his tones, \"Mother, I've fallen all down the wall!\"  This effective opening, should it seem successful, it was his intention to follow up with seasonable allusions to his birthday. But alas! one glimpse of Mrs. Pennybet's face when she saw his suit, showed him the folly of remaining on the scene, and with the speed of a fawn, he was out in the garden, and up an elm tree, swaying about like a crow's nest. And there, a minute later, was Mrs. Pennybet standing below, her skirts held up in one hand, a small cane in the other.  \"Come down, Archie,\" she said. \"Come down.\"  \"Not a bit of it,\" replied her son. \"You come up!\"         *       *       *       *       *  At least Mrs. Pennybet, a vivacious _raconteuse_, always declared to me that such was his reply. I do not trust these mothers, however, and regard it as a piece of her base embroidery. At any rate, it is certain that her effort to secure Archie for punishment was quite unsuccessful. And, an hour afterwards, a small figure came quietly down the trunk of the tree, and, entering the room where his mother was, sat quickly in a big arm-chair, and held on tightly to its arms. This position prevented access to that particular area of Archie Pennybet, which, in the view of himself, his mother, and all sound conservatives, must be exposed, if corporal punishment is to be the standard thing. Mrs. Pennybet, good woman, admitted her defeat, and kissed him repeatedly, while he still held himself tight in his chair.  Such was Archie Pennybet, whom Mrs. Pennybet considered a remarkably fine boy, and the son of a remarkably fine woman. In this battle of wits he undoubtedly won. And it is a fact that throughout life he made a point of winning, as all shall see, who read Rupert Ray's story.  He was a mischievous, tumbling scamp, I suppose; but what are we to say? All young animals gambol, and are saucy. Only this morning I was watching a lamb butt its mother in the ribs, and roll in the grass, and dirty its wool--the graceless young rascal!   §3  But come, we are keeping Edgar Gray Doe waiting.  If you have ever steamed up the Estuary of the Fal, that stately Cornish river, and gazed with rapture at the lofty and thick-wooded hills, through which the wide stream runs, you have probably seen on the eastern bank the splendid mansion of Graysroof. You have admired its doric façade and the deep, green groves that embrace it on every side. Perhaps it has been pointed out to you as the home of Sir Peter Gray, the once-famous Surrey bowler, and the parent of a whole herd of young cricketing Grays.  It was in this palatial dwelling that little Edgar Gray Doe awoke to a consciousness of himself, and of many other remarkable things; such things as the broad, silver mouth of the Fal; the green slopes, on which his house stood; the rather fearsome woods that surrounded it; and, above all, the very obvious fact that he was not as other boys. For instance, his cricketing cousins, these Gray boys, were sons with a visible mother and father, and, in being so, appeared to conform to a normal condition, while _he_ was a nephew with an uncle and aunt. Again these fellows were blue-eyed and drab, and, as such, were decent and reasonable, while _he_ was brown-eyed and preposterously fair-haired. To be sure, it was only his oval face that saved him from the horrible indignity of being called \"Snowball.\"  One morning of that perfect summer, which was the sixth of Rupert Ray, and the eighth of Archie Pennybet, Edgar Gray Doe felt some elation at the prospect of a visit from a very imposing friend. This person was staying down the stream at Falmouth; and he and his mother had been invited by Lady Gray to spend the day at Graysroof. His name was Archie Pennybet. And the power of his personality lay in these remarkable qualities: first, he enjoyed the distinction of being two years older than Master Doe; secondly, he had a genius for games that thrilled, because they were clearly sin; and thirdly, his hair was dark and glossy, so he could legitimately twit other people with being albinos.  And to-day this exciting creature would have to devote himself entirely to Edgar Doe, as the Gray boys were safely billeted in public and preparatory schools, and there was thus no sickening possibility of his chasing after them, or going on to their side against Edgar.  Edgar Doe knew that Mrs. Pennybet and Archie were coming in a row-boat from Falmouth, and it was a breathless moment when he saw them stepping on to the Graysroof landing-stage, and Lady Gray walking down the sloping lawn to meet them.  \"Hallo, kid,\" shouted Archie. \"Mother, there's Edgar!\"  Rather startled by this sudden notoriety, Edgar approached the new arrivals.  \"Hallo, kid,\" repeated Master Pennybet; and then stopped, his supply of greetings being exhausted.  \"Hallo,\" answered Edgar, slowly and rather shyly, for he was two years younger than anyone present.  \"Welcome to the Fal,\" said Lady Gray to Mrs. Pennybet. \"Archie, are you going to give me a kiss?\"  \"No,\" announced Archie firmly. \"I don't kiss mother's friends now.\"  Lady Gray concealed the fact that she thought her guest's little boy a hateful child, and, having patted his head, sent him off with Edgar Doe to play in the Day-nursery.  Of course the Master of the Ceremonies in the Day-nursery was Master Pennybet. Master Doe was his devoted mate. The first game was a disgusting one, called \"Spits.\" It consisted in the two combatants facing each other with open umbrellas, and endeavouring to register points by the method suggested in the title of the game; the umbrella was a shield, with which to intercept any good shooting. Luckily for their self-respect in later years, this difficult game soon yielded place to an original competition, known as \"Fire and Water.\" You placed a foot-bath under that portable gas-stove which was in the Day-nursery; you lit all the trivets in the stove to represent a house on fire; and you had a pail, ready to be filled from the bathroom, which, need we say, was the fire-station. The rules provided that the winner was he who could extinguish the conflagration raging in the foot-bath in the shortest possible time, and with the least expenditure of water. But the natural desire to win and to record good times meant that you were apt, in the haste and enthusiasm of the moment, to miss the bath entirely, and to flood quite a different part of the nursery. It was this flaw in an otherwise simple game, which brought the play to an end. Intimations that an aquatic tourney of some sort was the feature in the Day-nursery began to leak through to the room below. The competitors were apprehended and brought for judgment before the ladies, who were sitting in the garden and watching the Fal as it streamed by to the sea.  \"They had better go and play in the Beach Grove,\" sighed Lady Gray.  This ruling Archie did not veto or contest, for he had wearied of indoor amusements, and felt that the well-timbered groves would afford new avenues for play. So the boys departed like deer among the trunks of the trees.  It was a cosy conversation which the ladies enjoyed after this. Any conversation would be cosy that had been reared in the glory of such a garden, and in the comfort of those lazy chairs. Mrs. Pennybet began by declaring, as these shameless ladies do, that her hostess's fair-haired nephew was quite the most beautiful child she had ever seen; she could hug him all day; nay, she could eat him. And, thereupon Lady Gray told her the whole story of Edgar Gray Doe; how his mother had been Sir Peter's sister, and the loveliest woman in Western Cornwall; how she had paid with her life for Edgar's being; and how her husband, the chief of lovers, had quickly followed his young bride.  \"They're an emotional lot, these Does,\" said Lady Gray. \"As surely as they come fair-haired, they are brilliantly romantic and blindly adoring. And Edgar's every inch a Doe. Anybody can lead him into mischief. And anybody who likes will do so.\"  \"Oh, I suppose he's troublesome like all boys,\" suggested Mrs. Pennybet, with a rapid mental survey of the existence of Archie. \"He will grow into a fine man some day.\"  \"Perhaps,\" said Lady Gray, staring over the tranquil water of the Fal, as though it represented the intervening years. \"We shall see.\"  \"And Archie,\" continued Mrs. Pennybet, \"though he's a plague now, will be a brilliant and dominating man, I think. He's not easily mastered, and I don't believe adverse circumstances will ever beat him.... Isn't it funny to think that these restless boys are here to inherit the world? We old fogies\"--Mrs. Pennybet laughed, for she didn't mean what she said--\"are really done for and shelved. These boys are the interesting ones, whose tales have yet to be told.\"  The speaker dropped her voice, as she found herself moralising; and Lady Gray perceived that an atmosphere of tender speculation had risen around their conversation. She turned her face away, and looked over that "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15040"],["title","McGuffey's Fifth Eclectic Reader (#1)"],["body","RKS.  The great object to be accomplished in reading, as a rhetorical exercise, is to convey to the hearer, fully and clearly, the ideas and feelings of the writer.  In order to do this, it is necessary that a selection should be carefully studied by the pupil before he attempts to read it. In accordance with this view, a preliminary rule of importance is the following:  RULE 1.--Before attempting to read a lesson, the learner should make himself fully acquainted with the subject as treated of in that lesson, and endeavor to make the thought and feeling and sentiments of the writer his own.  REMARK.--When he has thus identified himself with the author, he has the substance of all rules in his own mind. It is by going to nature that we find rules. The child or the savage orator never mistakes in inflection or emphasis or modulation. The best speakers and readers are those who follow the impulse of nature, or most closely imitate it as observed in others.  II. ARTICULATION.  Articulation is the utterance of the elementary sounds of a language, and of their combinations.  An Elementary Sound is a simple, distinct sound made by the organs of speech.  The Elementary Sounds of the English language are divided into Vocals, Subvocals, and Aspirates.  ELEMENTARY SOUNDS.--VOCALS.  Vocals are sounds which consist of pure tone only. A diphthong is a union of two vocals, commencing with one and ending with the other.  DIRECTION.--Put the lips, teeth, tongue, and palate in their proper position; pronounce the word in the chart forcibly, and with the falling inflection, several times in succession; then drop the subvocal or aspirate sounds which precede or follow the vocal, and repeat the vocals alone.  Table of Vocals.              Long Vocals. Vocal   as in      Vocal   as in -----   -----      -----   ----- a       hate         e     err a       hare         i     pine a       far          o     no a       pass         u     tube a       fall         u     burn e       eve         oo     cool              Short Vocals Vocal   as in      Vocal   as in -----   -----      -----   ----- a       mat          o     hot e       met          u     us i       it          oo     book    Diphthongs. Vocal     as in ------   -------- oi, oy   oil, boy ou, ow   out,now  REMARK 1.--In this table, the short sounds, except u, are nearly or quite the same in quality as certain of the long sounds. The difference consists chiefly in quantity.  REMARK 2. The vocals are often represented by other letters or combinations of letters than those used in the table; for instance, a is represented by ai in hail, ea in steak, etc.  REMARK 3.--As a general rule, the long vocals and the diphthongs should be articulated with a full, clear utterance; but the short vocals have a sharp, distinct, and almost explosive utterance.    SUBVOCALS AND ASPIRATES.  Subvocals are those sounds in which the vocalized breath is more or less obstructed.  Aspirates consist of breath only, modified by the vocal organs.  Words ending with subvocal sounds should be selected for practice on the subvocals; words beginning or ending with aspirate sounds may be used for practice on the aspirates. Pronounce these words forcibly and distinctly several times in succession; then drop the other sounds, and repeat the subvocals and aspirates alone. Let the class repeat the words and elements at first in concert, then separately.  Table of Subvocals and Aspirates. Subvocal   as in          Subvocal   as in --------   -----          --------   ----- b          babe              p       rap d          bad               t       at g          nag               k       book j          judge             ch      rich v          move              f       life th         with              th      Smith z          buzz              s       hiss z          azure(azh'ure)    sh      rush    REMARK.--These sixteen sounds make eight pairs of cognates. In articulating the aspirates, the vocal organs are put in the position required in the articulation of the corresponding subvocals; but the breath is expelled with some force without the utterance of any vocal sound. The pupil should first verify this by experiment, and then practice on these cognates.  The following subvocals and aspirates have no cognates.   SUBVOCALS.  Subvocal   as in      Subvocal   as in --------   -----      --------   ----- l          mill         r        rule m          rim          r        car n          run          w        win ng         sing         y        yet  ASPIRATES  Aspirate   as in --------   ----- h          hat wh         when    SUBSTITUTES.  Substitutes are characters used to represent sounds ordinarily represented by other characters.  TABLE OF SUBSTITUTES.

DIRECTION.--Give to each sound, to each syllable, and to each word its full, distinct, and appropriate utterance.  For the purpose of avoiding the more common errors under this head, observe the following rules:  RULE II.--Avoid the omission of unaccented vowels.  EXAMPLES.  Incorrect      Correct            Incorrect      Correct ---------      -----------        ----------     --------- Sep'rate       sep-a-rate         Ev'dent        ev-i-dent met-ric'l      met-ric-al         mem'ry         mem-o-ry 'pear          ap-pear            'pin-ion       o-pin-ion com-p'tent     com-pe-tent        pr'pose        pro-pose pr'cede        pre-cede           gran'lar       gran-u-lar 'spe-cial      es-pe-cial         par-tic'lar    par-tic-u-lar    RULE III.--Avoid sounding incorrectly the unaccented vowels.  EXAMPLES.  Incorrect       Correct            Incorrect       Correct ----------      -----------        ------------    ------------ Sep-er-ate      sep-a-rate         Mem-er-ry       mem-o-ry met-ric-ul      met-ric-al         up-pin-ion      o-pin-ion up-pear         ap-pear            prup-ose        pro-pose com-per-tent    com-pe-tent        gran-ny-lar     gran-u-lar dum-mand        de-mand            par-tic-e-lar   par-tic-u-lar ob-stur-nate    ob-sti-nate        ev-er-dent      ev-i-dent   REMARK I.--In correcting errors of this kind in words of more than one syllable, it is very important to avoid a fault which is the natural consequence of an effort to articulate correctly. Thus, in endeavoring to sound correctly the a in met'ric-al, the pupil is very apt to say met-ric-al'. accenting the last syllable instead of the first.  REMARK 2.--The teacher should bear it in mind that in correcting a fault there is always danger of erring in the opposite extreme. Properly speaking, there is no danger of learning to articulate too distinctly, but there is danger of making the obscure sounds too prominent, and of reading in a slow, measured, and unnatural manner.  RULE IV.--Utter distinctly the terminating subvocals and aspirates.  EXAMPLES.  Incorrect     Correct      Incorrect     Correct ---------     -------      ---------     ------- An'           and          Mos'          mosque ban'          band         near-es'      near-est moun'         mound        wep'          wept mor-nin'      morn-ing     ob-jec'       ob-ject des'          desk         sub-jec       sub-ject   REMARK 1.--This omission is still more likely to occur when several consonants come together.   EXAMPLES.  Incorrect     Correct          Incorrect      Correct ---------     --------         ---------      ---------- Thrus'        thrusts          Harms'         harm'st beace         beasts           wrongs'        wrong'st thinks'       thinkst          twinkles'      twinkl'dst weps'         weptst           black'ns       black'n'dst   REMARK 2.--In all cases of this kind these sounds are omitted, in the first instance, merely because they are difficult, and require care and attention for their utterance, although after a while it becomes a habit. The only remedy is to devote that care and attention which may be necessary. There is no other difficulty, unless there should be a defect in the organs of speech, which is not often the case.  RULE V.--A void blending syllables which belong to different words.  EXAMPLES.  INCORRECT.            CORRECT. ----------            ------------ He ga-zdupon.         He gazed upon. Here res tsis sed.    Here rests his head. Whattis sis sname?    What is his name? For ranninstantush.   For an instant hush. Ther ris sa calm,     There is a calm. For tho stha tweep.   For those that weep. God sglorou simage.   God's glorious image.   EXERCISES IN ARTICULATION.  This exercise and similar ones will afford valuable aid in training the organs to a distinct articulation.    Every vice fights against nature.   Folly is never pleased with itself.   Pride, not nature, craves much.   The little tattler tittered at the tempest.   Titus takes the petulant outcasts.   The covetous partner is destitute of fortune.   No one of you knows where the shoe pinches.   What can not be cured must be endured.   You can not catch old birds with chaff.   Never sport with the opinions of others.   The lightnings"]]]
