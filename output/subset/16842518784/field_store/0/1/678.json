Everything is sand and lots of it. Besides the real coast is over here to our starboard hand side. You can't hear any surf there!\"  \"Maybe so, but I can hear what I believe to be the pounding of waves on a shore, just the same!\" stoutly insisted Harry.  \"Listen a minute,\" exclaimed Tom raising a hand for silence.  \"There!\" cried Harry after an interval. \"There it is again!\"  \"Jack,\" Tom asked turning to his chum, \"can you get it?\"  With his face a trifle paler than was his wont, Jack nodded his head and with his lips closed tightly peered into the fog.  \"Great Wigglin' Pollywogs!\" ejaculated Tom. \"If we're into a surf the Fortuna had better give up now! We can't ever expect to get out of that sort of a mess with this little rabbit!\"  \"Two times heavy on the dish washing for Thomas!\" gloated Harry. \"But we're not into the surf yet a while! Listen!\"  His hand was held up again for silence. From the cabin came the sound of the clock striking the hour in nautical fashion.  \"Five bells!\" announced Jack.  \"Let's see,\" mused Harry. \"I never can get used to that.\"  \"Ten thirty,\" Tom put in, \"if it was a railroader; half past o'clock for you Dutchmen,\" he added with a chuckle, wrinkling a freckled nose at Harry and winking at Jack.  \"All right!\" assented Harry. \"Log a surf heard at--how many bells? Oh, yes, five bells in the morning. Log Tom Blackwood for uncivil language to an officer and for refusing duty under fire!\"  \"Hark, boys!\" commanded Jack \"We may be getting into a mess and it's no time for joking and carrying on like that!\"  \"You're right, Jack, as always!\" assented Tom. \"Just to show that I'm serious, I'll joke no more until this fog lifts!\"  \"Here, too!\" declared Harry. \"But look at Rowdy! What's the matter, Rowdy, old chap?\" he continued as a great white bulldog came up the ladder from the cabin. \"What ails you?\"  The bulldog was evidently excited about something for the hair on his shoulders and neck was standing straight up while from his throat issued a low fierce growl scarcely audible above the noise of the tumbling waters. His every action bespoke antipathy to something. Raising himself upon his hind legs, the dog rested his paws upon the window sill of the pilot house. He peered eagerly into the white shroud of mist that enveloped the motor boat.  \"He hears that surf, too!\" declared Tom. \"He hears it!\"  \"I don't believe it's surf he hears,\" Jack stated. \"He looks just like he did back there in Mobile when we found that black browed fellow trying to board the Fortuna.  \"Good old Rowdy!\" soothingly murmured Tom reaching over to give the dog a pat. \"What do you see, boy? Tell your friend.\"  \"Looks to me like it might be a person he scents!\" Harry stated. \"Only it isn't a likely place for a person to be out in this mess!\"  \"We're out in this mess, aren't we?\" objected Tom.  Jack's hands swiftly traveled over the switchboard seeming to find as if by instinct just the right levers. The engines stopped and then reversed full speed! The Fortuna shook and quivered from stern to stern. She fell off slightly into the trough.  \"On deck!\" shouted Jack. \"Here's a collision.\"  Tom and Harry were on deck instantly. Jack leaned against the switchboard and groaned. The next instant came a crash!       CHAPTER II  CRIPPLED BY THE STRANGER   With a lunge the Fortuna struck a dark object riding the crest of an oncoming wave. Jack stood against the switchboard scarcely daring to look while Arnold came crowding up the companion-way his face blanched and eyes staring. Harry and Tom were on the forward deck looking along either side of the plunging boat.  \"What did we hit?\" queried Arnold in a shaking tone.  \"I don't know,\" replied Jack. \"Whatever it was, we don't seem to be sunk yet, though. Maybe it was just a few floating boards washed adrift from some vessel.\"  \"What did you see, boys?\" Arnold called out to his companions on deck. \"Did we hit something or did it hit us?\"  \"Looks to me as if we had run down a row boat and cut her right in two!\" declared Tom. \"I was sure I saw the stern of a boat just sinking here on the starboard side.\"  Jack reeled against the wheel, covering his face with his hands. Despite his efforts a groan escaped him. Arnold sprang toward his chum and put an arm about his shoulders with a friendly air.  \"What's the matter, Jack? Are you hurt?\" he asked solicitously.  \"Only inside\" replied Jack. \"I'm sure I saw a man in a row boat loom up out of the fog just before we struck. The shudder that ran through the Fortuna told me only too plainly that we had hit something more than a mere board or two. I can't bear to think that we've run down a man out here in the Gulf! It's too bad!\"  \"Maybe it was only an empty boat, Jack,\" comforted Arnold. \"Did you hear anyone cry out or see anything of a man overboard?\"  \"No,\" was Jack's answer, \"I didn't. I just felt that something was going to happen and then we struck the boat. I guess it's all right and we'd better get the Fortuna with her nose into it or we'll roll the engines off their beds. This is surely a choppy sea!\"  Suiting the action to the words Jack reached for the levers on the switchboard just as Tom and Harry returned to the shelter of the pilot house dripping from the sheets of spray that had come aboard while the vessel lay rolling in the trough of the sea.  \"Great Wiggling Pollywogs!\" exclaimed Tom, \"this is sure a nasty piece of weather! I'm glad I'm on top and not sloshing around in the Gulf right now. Bet that fellow in the boat is wet all right.\"  \"Hark, Tom!\" cautioned Harry. \"You mustn't talk like that.\"  \"I'm going back to finish my cooking,\" announced Arnold. \"We'll all be hungry enough to eat a raw dog. And speaking of dogs,\" he continued pointing at the white bulldog still holding his position at the pilot house window, \"what's the matter with Rowdy?\"  \"Rowdy scents something he doesn't like,\" explained Tom.  \"I wonder,\" began Jack and then without finishing his half begun sentence he dashed madly from the pilot house and flung himself into the bow of the yacht now gaining headway under the impetus of the engines. Flat on deck he fell and crawling to the rail peered eagerly over the side. His friends saw him turn an agonized and pleading glance in their direction and then reach far over the rail of the vessel. In an instant Tom and Harry were by his side eager to be of any possible assistance to their chum.  \"What is it?\" began Tom, but Harry motioned him to silence.  \"Sit on his legs!\" he commanded and Tom with a flash of comprehension obeyed unquestioningly. His weight on Jack's feet enabled the captain to lean far over the rail and grasp the wrists of a clinging figure gripping with the tenacity of despair the links of the cable that still hung from the hawse pipes.  Harry, too, leaned far out and in his eagerness to be of help nearly lost his balance and all but plunged into the sea.  \"Steady!\" gasped Jack. \"Slow and steady now or he's gone!\"  With a mighty heave the two boys dragged the figure to a level with the rail and then Tom left his post and came to their help.  It was now but a short task to get the rescued person on deck, but he was so chilled and exhausted that he could not stand.  \"Let's put him below as quickly as we can, boys,\" Jack suggested. \"Arnold has some hot coffee already cooking and that'll help him as much as anything we can do. Easy with him, now, maybe he's hurt.\"  With tenderness and skill the boys who had been trained to care for injured persons helped the visitor who had boarded their vessel so strangely and all unannounced down the companion-way into the cabin where he was speedily given a change of clothing followed by a steaming cup of fragrant coffee.  Jack again assumed command in the pilot house while Arnold took up his interrupted preparations for the meal.  \"Be sure you fry an extra big piece of that Red Snapper for the new lad,\" directed Tom as he prepared to go again to the pilot house. \"He's about half starved and pretty near used up, I guess!\"  \"You know I'll take care of him all right!\" replied Arnold. \"I'm sorry we broke his boat up like that but I guess we can all take a knot out of our neckties today. Wasn't it lucky he caught the cable, though? I'm delighted that we were able to save him!\"  \"Of course, we couldn't be blamed for running into him,\" said Tom. \"I'm glad we rescued him from his awful predicament and now we'll have to be extra good to him to make up for it!\"  So saying he passed up the companion-way and into the pilot house joining Harry and Jack at their ceaseless vigil.  Busily engaged with his work in the kitchenette, Arnold was quite surprised to observe the door leading into the after cabin open softly. It admitted the newly found stranger. He had been given spare clothes belonging to the boys and looked little the worse for his rough experience of only a short time before. His eyes were black and piercing and might have been pleasant were it not for his disagreeable habit of not looking directly at the one with whom he was talking. His glance roved about the place taking in every detail yet never resting long in any one place.  \"How do you do?\" pleasantly queried Arnold resolving to be congenial in spite of his instant distrust of the other. \"I'm sorry we ran you down and ruined your boat, but I'm glad we got you aboard in time to save your life. It was a lucky accident.\"  Advancing in his frank and friendly manner he held out his hand in greeting. The stranger at first drew back, then as if thinking better of his resolve, he thrust forth his hand for a quick handshake, almost instantly releasing Arnold's grasp.  \"What is your name, may I ask?\" questioned Arnold.  \"Carlos Madero is my right name, but they call me Charley,\" was the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13859"],["title","Boy Scouts in Southern Waters; Or, Spaniard's Treasure Chest (#2)"],["body","ad's almost surly response. \"I live at Pass Christian and work on a shrimping schooner. My boat is gone now.\"  Arnold busied himself with the operation of the stove for a moment to regain his composure, for the fellow's manner had angered him immediately. Presently he turned and said:  \"My name is Arnold Poysor. I am from Chicago and so are my chums. We are down here for a vacation and pleasure trip. We're sorry we smashed your boat, but if you'll accept it, we'll give you the one we're towing behind us. We bought it in Mobile.\"  \"All right!\" replied Carlos. \"You ought to do that much.\"  Arnold now prepared the table for dinner and calling his companions to eat he introduced them to Carlos as they entered the cabin. Jack remained at the wheel while the others ate.  All the boys tried to make pleasant conversation for the newcomer but he greedily devoured the food set before him in a ravenous manner. His conversation was little better than monosyllables. At last the boys in despair gave up the effort of entertainment and fell to discussing their situation amongst themselves. They recounted the incidents of their trip down the Great Lakes, through the Erie Canal and down the Hudson River, their pleasant run down the east coast of the United States to the Florida Keys, past the Dry Tortugas and up to Mobile.  To all of their conversation Carlos listened intently, eating in silence, but keenly alert to every word that was said. Finally as the talk lulled to an occasional remark he looked up and said:  \"What are you here for, anyway?\"  \"I told you,\" replied Arnold, \"we're here for a pleasant vacation trip. We'll be joined later by the father of the boy at the wheel and then we expect to go on up the Mississippi to our home at Chicago. Didn't you believe me at first?\"  \"No,\" bluntly replied Carlos, \"I didn't.\"  \"All right,\" laughed Arnold, \"we'll forgive you this time.\"  To relieve the tense situation Tom sprang to his feet saying that he would go and relieve Jack at the wheel while his friend ate.  Once in the pilot house he was met with a questioning look from Jack who was holding the wheel with one hand and Rowdy with the other. The dog was struggling wildly to free himself.  \"What's the matter with Rowdy?\" questioned Tom wonderingly.  \"I'll never tell you,\" Jack panted, \"he's been trying to get down into the cabin like all possessed ever since dinner was called. I've had my own sweet time to keep him here.\"  \"Maybe the poor tyke is getting hungry like the rest of us human beings,\" ventured Tom. \"Rowdy, are you hungry?\" he asked.  Rowdy's reply was a glance from bloodshot eyes toward his friend, then he launched himself against the door leading to the cabin emitting growls that were unmistakably vicious.  \"That's pretty near talking, Jack!\" Tom stated.  With a knowing look Jack assented and pointing with his thumb toward the newcomer's direction nodded his head once or twice. Securing a length of small line Jack made Rowdy fast to a ring bolt in the pilot house floor and then went into the cabin for his dinner.  He had no better success in his effort at conversation with the stranger than his chums had met and shortly gave over trying to be pleasant. Making a hurried meal he again hastened to the pilot house where he assumed charge of the craft, for the fog was still thick.  Arnold in an effort to be friendly asked Carlos to inspect the Fortuna from the interior, which offer was quickly accepted.  \"Here,\" explained Arnold, standing near the bulkhead separating the pilot house from the cabin, \"is the forward part of the vessel. I suppose you'd call it the forecastle, but we have the fuel tanks, chain locker and lazarette here. On occasion we can use this space for extra bunks, but with the Pullman berths in the cabins we don't often need the room for anything but storage.\"  \"Where is your gasoline?\" asked Carlos displaying some interest.  \"In tanks right up in the eyes of her,\" replied Arnold glad that he was interesting his visitor. \"Then you see the engines amidships here with a berth on each side. The switchboard is in the center of the pilot house so the stairways are on each side of the engines. In the next compartment aft are more berths. Then still further aft, you see are the kitchenette on one side and the wash room on the other. Abaft of that is the after cabin that we use as a dining room. With the folding berths we can accommodate twelve people easily. It makes a fine home, all right.\"  \"Can I go to sleep?\" inquired Carlos. \"I'm right tired.\"  \"Sure you may,\" declared Arnold. \"Take the after cabin and make yourself comfortable. I'll go up forward and let you sleep.\"  So saying he joined his companions in the pilot house and reported to them the result of his effort to placate their visitor.  For half an hour the Fortuna breasted the waves plunging through the thick fog. Anxiously the boys peered ahead ever alert.  Directly the vibrations of the motors grew fainter. The boys glanced at each other wonderingly. Rowdy tugged at the rope that confined him and growled savagely. Jack's face went white as he reached for the switch. He looked at the other boys in wonder.  The Fortuna's engines came to a dead stop!       CHAPTER III  A MYSTERIOUS MESSAGE   \"Pull off the hood over the engines,\" cried Jack to Harry who was quickly down the companion-way, \"and see if the wires from the magneto are disconnected. I made a new clip while we were at Mobile and maybe it has broken and cut off the current.\"  \"Phew!\" ejaculated Tom who was preparing to follow Harry below. \"I'll bet something's broke loose all right. Smell it?\"  \"Sure enough I smell gasoline strong!\" declared Jack.  \"Some odoriferous, whatever that means!\" cried Arnold. \"Smells like the gas house up near Goose Island in the North Branch of the Chicago River,\" he added holding his nose.  \"Switch on the electric lights and see where the gasoline pipe has broken loose,\" suggested Jack. \"It seems to me the feed pipe must have become broken. That's an awful smell!\"  \"I'll venture there are gallons of gasoline in the bilge right now!\" averred Harry. \"Better open the windows a bit and let it air out in here. Suppose you get the bilge pump to work, Tom, and I'll try to find the leak.\"  \"Sure, I'll pump the bilge,\" assented Tom. \"Just look here at the stuff slopping up through the floor boards,\" he continued. \"It surely looks as if we'd lost some fuel.\"  \"That's funny,\" declared Jack. \"I wonder how it could have happened. The pipes were all right when we fitted out and nothing we have done since could have injured them.\"  A shout from Harry announced a discovery. He was backing out of the compartment under the pilot house floor and just forward of the engines. As he appeared his face was the picture of rage.  \"What's it?\" queried Tom. \"Don't hold your breath that way, you're apt to choke if you do,\" he laughed.  \"Where is the fellow that opened that drain cock?\" shouted Harry shaking his fist in the air. \"Someone deliberately drained our gasoline into the bilge. I found the drain cock wide open!\"  \"Nobody opened it,\" asserted Jack. \"We were all in the pilot house since dinner watching the fog and we couldn't reach the pipe.\"  \"I hate to say it, Jack, but we were not all in the pilot house,\" answered Tom. \"Maybe it isn't fair to the chap, but that fellow we nearly run over doesn't look good to me. I rather suspect him.\"  \"Hush, my lad,\" Jack warned. \"A good Boy Scout doesn't accuse anyone until he has proof, and we have no proof yet of his guilt.\"  \"All right, Jack,\" unwillingly replied Tom, \"but I can't help feel the way I feel, can I? He didn't impress me very favorably.\"  \"And then, look at Rowdy!\" put in Harry. \"He spotted the fellow when he was still hanging on the cable and he tried to get back into the cabin all the time to eat up his visitor.\"  \"Well, let's go back and wake him up and see what he knows,\" suggested Jack. \"Maybe he can put up a good story that will satisfy even you chaps. I can hardly believe anyone would do a thing like that. He has no motive for attempting to cripple us like this.\"  The boys moved with one accord toward the after cabin. The Fortuna rolled viciously in the trough of the choppy sea, making their footing extremely unsteady. Jack swung open the door.  Starting back in amazement he bumped into Tom who was following closely. Harry was at their heels peering over their shoulders.  \"Where is he?\" gasped Jack wonderingly. \"Where did he go?\"  \"The bird has flown!\" declared Tom in a tragic tone.  \"Bag and baggage!\" asserted Harry.  True enough, not a sign of the stranger remained except the pile of water soaked garments in which he had been clothed when first brought into the cabin. These lay in a heap on the floor.  \"Maybe he's out on the after deck,\" ventured Jack still hopeful.  \"Let's see,\" answered Tom. \"If he is there, I'll cook and wash dishes and scrub decks for a week on end!\"  The after deck was empty. The visitor was nowhere in sight.  \"Well, it looks as if he had come up out of the sea like a modern Neptune and like Old Neptune has gone back into it again,\" Jack said, his voice shaking. You don't suppose the fright he had turned his head and made him commit suicide, do you?\"  \"Suicide your tintype!\" stoutly scorned Tom. \"Do you think that fellow would commit suicide in a rowboat?\"  \"What do you mean?\" questioned Jack wonderingly.  \"I mean that our young pirate friend got one perfectly good square meal of food, one entire new outfit of clothes and one rowboat from this bunch of kindergartners. Then he opened the drip cock in our fuel tank and sneaked out the back door and is gone.\"  \"Good night,\" vociferated Harry. \"It's as clear as mud! Look at what that young villain has done! Why, he's a thief!\"  \"Easy now,\" admonished Jack. \"We mustn't call him names. Maybe things look black for him, but it may come out all right.\"  \"Yea-ah!\" scorned Tom. \"When I can see the back of my neck it will. That guy's crooked! That's what I"]]]
