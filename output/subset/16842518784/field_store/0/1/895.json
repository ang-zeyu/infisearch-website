All were alarmed, and \"rush of blood, strangulation\" were the conjectures, but the doctor, when asked the cause, grimly told them it was a Negro child. There was a family conclave, the coachman heard of it and leaving his own family went West, and has never returned. As soon as Mrs. Marshall was able to travel she was sent away in deep disgrace. Her husband died within the year of a broken heart.  Ebenzer Fowler, the wealthiest colored man in Issaquena County, Miss., was shot down on the street in Mayersville, January 30, 1885, just before dark by an armed body of white men who filled his body with bullets. They charged him with writing a note to a white woman of the place, which they intercepted and which proved there was an intimacy existing between them.  Hundreds of such cases might be cited, but enough have been given to prove the assertion that there are white women in the South who love the Afro-American's company even as there are white men notorious for their preference for Afro-American women.  There is hardly a town in the South which has not an instance of the kind which is well known, and hence the assertion is reiterated that \"nobody in the South believes the old thread bare lie that negro men rape white women.\" Hence there is a growing demand among Afro-Americans that the guilt or innocence of parties accused of rape be fully established. They know the men of the section of the country who refuse this are not so desirous of punishing rapists as they pretend. The utterances of the leading white men show that with them it is not the crime but the _class_. Bishop Fitzgerald has become apologist for lynchers of the rapists of _white_ women only. Governor Tillman, of South Carolina, in the month of June, standing under the tree in Barnwell, S.C., on which eight Afro-Americans were hung last year, declared that he would lead a mob to lynch a _negro_ who raped a _white_ woman. So say the pulpits, officials and newspapers of the South. But when the victim is a colored woman it is different.  Last winter in Baltimore, Md., three white ruffians assaulted a Miss Camphor, a young Afro-American girl, while out walking with a young man of her own race. They held her escort and outraged the girl. It was a deed dastardly enough to arouse Southern blood, which gives its horror of rape as excuse for lawlessness, but she was an Afro-American. The case went to the courts, an Afro-American lawyer defended the men and they were acquitted.  In Nashville, Tenn., there is a white man, Pat Hanifan, who outraged a little Afro-American girl, and, from the physical injuries received, she has been ruined for life. He was jailed for six months, discharged, and is now a detective in that city. In the same city, last May, a white man outraged an Afro-American girl in a drug store. He was arrested, and released on bail at the trial. It was rumored that five hundred Afro-Americans had organized to lynch him. Two hundred and fifty white citizens armed themselves with Winchesters and guarded him. A cannon was placed in front of his home, and the Buchanan Rifles (State Militia) ordered to the scene for his protection. The Afro-American mob did not materialize. Only two weeks before Eph. Grizzard, who had only been _charged_ with rape upon a white woman, had been taken from the jail, with Governor Buchanan and the police and militia standing by, dragged through the streets in broad daylight, knives plunged into him at every step, and with every fiendish cruelty a frenzied mob could devise, he was at last swung out on the bridge with hands cut to pieces as he tried to climb up the stanchions. A naked, bloody example of the blood-thirstiness of the nineteenth-century civilization of the Athens of the South! No cannon or military was called out in his defense. He dared to visit a white woman.  At the very moment these civilized whites were announcing their determination \"to protect their wives and daughters,\" by murdering Grizzard, a white man was in the same jail for raping eight-year-old Maggie Reese, an Afro-American girl. He was not harmed. The \"honor\" of grown women who were glad enough to be supported by the Grizzard boys and Ed Coy, as long as the liaison was not known, needed protection; they were white. The outrage upon helpless childhood needed no avenging in this case; she was black.  A white man in Guthrie, Oklahoma Territory, two months ago inflicted such injuries upon another Afro-American child that she died. He was not punished, but an attempt was made in the same town in the month of June to lynch an Afro-American who visited a white woman.  In Memphis, Tenn., in the month of June, Ellerton L. Dorr, who is the husband of Russell Hancock's widow, was arrested for attempted rape on Mattie Cole, a neighbors cook; he was only prevented from accomplishing his purpose, by the appearance of Mattie's employer. Dorr's friends say he was drunk and not responsible for his actions. The grand jury refused to indict him and he was discharged.     3 _The_ NEW CRY   The appeal of Southern whites to Northern sympathy and sanction, the adroit, insiduous plea made by Bishop Fitzgerald for suspension of judgment because those \"who condemn lynching express no sympathy for the _white_ woman in the case,\" falls to the ground in the light of the foregoing.  From this exposition of the race issue in lynch law, the whole matter is explained by the well-known opposition growing out of slavery to the progress of the race. This is crystalized in the oft-repeated slogan: \"This is a white man's country and the white man must rule.\" The South resented giving the Afro-American his freedom, the ballot box and the Civil Rights Law. The raids of the Ku-Klux and White Liners to subvert reconstruction government, the Hamburg and Ellerton, S.C., the Copiah County, Miss., and the Layfayette Parish, La., massacres were excused as the natural resentment of intelligence against government by ignorance.  Honest white men practically conceded the necessity of intelligence murdering ignorance to correct the mistake of the general government, and the race was left to the tender mercies of the solid South. Thoughtful Afro-Americans with the strong arm of the government withdrawn and with the hope to stop such wholesale massacres urged the race to sacrifice its political rights for sake of peace. They honestly believed the race should fit itself for government, and when that should be done, the objection to race participation in politics would be removed.  But the sacrifice did not remove the trouble, nor move the South to justice. One by one the Southern States have legally(?) disfranchised the Afro-American, and since the repeal of the Civil Rights Bill nearly every Southern State has passed separate car laws with a penalty against their infringement. The race regardless of advancement is penned into filthy, stifling partitions cut off from smoking cars. All this while, although the political cause has been removed, the butcheries of black men at Barnwell, S.C., Carrolton, Miss., Waycross, Ga., and Memphis, Tenn., have gone on; also the flaying alive of a man in Kentucky, the burning of one in Arkansas, the hanging of a fifteen-year-old girl in Louisiana, a woman in Jackson, Tenn., and one in Hollendale, Miss., until the dark and bloody record of the South shows 728 Afro-Americans lynched during the past eight years. Not fifty of these were for political causes; the rest were for all manner of accusations from that of rape of white women, to the case of the boy Will Lewis who was hanged at Tullahoma, Tenn., last year for being drunk and \"sassy\" to white folks.  These statistics compiled by the _Chicago Tribune_ were given the first of this year (1892). Since then, not less than one hundred and fifty have been known to have met violent death at the hands of cruel bloodthirsty mobs during the past nine months.  To palliate this record (which grows worse as the Afro-American becomes intelligent) and excuse some of the most heinous crimes that ever stained the history of a country, the South is shielding itself behind the plausible screen of defending the honor of its women. This, too, in the face of the fact that only _one-third_ of the 728 victims to mobs have been _charged_ with rape, to say nothing of those of that one-third who were innocent of the charge. A white correspondent of the _Baltimore Sun_ declares that the Afro-American who was lynched in Chestertown, Md., in May for assault on a white girl was innocent; that the deed was done by a white man who had since disappeared. The girl herself maintained that her assailant was a white man. When that poor Afro-American was murdered, the whites excused their refusal of a trial on the ground that they wished to spare the white girl the mortification of having to testify in court.  This cry has had its effect. It has closed the heart, stifled the conscience, warped the judgment and hushed the voice of press and pulpit on the subject of lynch law throughout this \"land of liberty.\" Men who stand high in the esteem of the public for Christian character, for moral and physical courage, for devotion to the principles of equal and exact justice to all, and for great sagacity, stand as cowards who fear to open their mouths before this great outrage. They do not see that by their tacit encouragement, their silent acquiescence, the black shadow of lawlessness in the form of lynch law is spreading its wings over the whole country.  Men who, like Governor Tillman, start the ball of lynch law rolling for a certain crime, are powerless to stop it when drunken or criminal white toughs feel like hanging an Afro-American on any pretext.  Even to the better class of Afro-Americans the crime of rape is so revolting they have too often taken the white man's word and given lynch law neither the investigation nor condemnation it deserved.  They forget that a concession of the right to lynch a man for a certain crime,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14976"],["title","Mob Rule in New Orleans (#1)"],["body"," at 2   o'clock this morning Captain Day, with Sergeant Aucoin and Corporals   Perrier and Trenchard, with a good squad of men, were beating the weeds   for the black.  The _New Orleans Picayune_ of the same date described the occurrence, and from its account one would think it was an entirely different affair. Both of the two accounts cannot be true, and the unquestioned fact is that neither of them sets out the facts as they occurred. Both accounts attempt to fix the beginning of hostilities upon the colored men, but both were compelled to admit that the colored men were sitting on the doorsteps quietly conversing with one another when the three policemen went up and accosted them. The _Times-Democrat_ unguardedly states that one of the two colored men tried to run away; that Mora seized him and then drew his billy and struck him on the head; that Charles broke away from him and started to run, after which the shooting began. The _Picayune_, however, declares that Pierce began the firing and that his two shots point blank at Aucoin were the first shots of the fight. As a matter of fact, Pierce never fired a single shot before he was covered by Aucoin's revolver. Charles and the officers did all the shooting. The _Picayune_'s account is as follows:    Patrolman Mora was shot in the right hip and dangerously wounded last   night at 11:30 o'clock in Dryades Street, between Washington and Sixth,   by two Negroes, who were sitting on a door step in the neighborhood.    The shooting of Patrolman Mora brings to memory the fact that he was one   of the partners of Patrolman Trimp, who was shot by a Negro soldier of   the United States government during the progress of the Spanish-American   war. The shooting of Mora by the Negro last night is a very simple   story. At the hour mentioned, three Negro women noticed two suspicious   men sitting on a door step in the above locality. The women saw the two   men making an apparent inspection of the building. As they told the   story, they saw the men look over the fence and examine the window   blinds, and they paid particular attention to the make-up of the   building, which was a two-story affair. About that time Sergeant J.C.   Aucoin and Officers Mora and J.D. Cantrell hove in sight. The women   hailed them and described to them the suspicious actions of the two   Negroes, who were still sitting on the step. The trio of bluecoats, on   hearing the facts, at once crossed the street and accosted the men. The   latter answered that they were waiting for a friend whom they were   expecting. Not satisfied with this answer, the sergeant asked them where   they lived, and they replied \"down town,\" but could not designate the   locality. To other questions put by the officers the larger of the two   Negroes replied that they had been in town just three days.    As this reply was made, the larger man sprang to his feet, and Patrolman   Mora, seeing that he was about to run away, seized him. The Negro took a   firm hold on the officer, and a scuffle ensued. Mora, noting that he was   not being assisted by his brother officers, drew his billy and struck   the Negro on the head. The blow had but little effect upon the man, for   he broke away and started down the street. When about ten feet away, the   Negro drew his revolver and opened fire on the officer, firing three or   four shots. The third shot struck Mora in the right hip, and was   subsequently found to have taken an upward course. Although badly   wounded, Mora drew his pistol and returned the fire. At his third shot   the Negro was noticed to stagger, but he did not fall. He continued his   flight. At this moment Sergeant Aucoin seized the other Negro, who   proved to be a youth, Leon Pierce. As soon as Officer Mora was shot he   sank to the sidewalk, and the other officer ran to the nearest   telephone, and sent in a call for the ambulance. Upon its arrival the   wounded officer was placed in it and conveyed to the hospital. An   examination by the house surgeon revealed the fact that the bullet had   taken an upward course. In the opinion of the surgeon the wound was a   dangerous one.  But the best proof of the fact that the officers accosted the two colored men and without any warrant or other justification attempted to arrest them, and did actually seize and begin to club one of them, is shown by Officer Mora's own statement. The officer was wounded and had every reason in the world to make his side of the story as good as possible. His statement was made to a _Picayune_ reporter and the same was published on the twenty-fifth inst., and is as follows:    I was in the neighborhood of Dryades and Washington Streets, with   Sergeant Aucoin and Officer Cantrell, when three Negro women came up and   told us that there were two suspicious-looking Negroes sitting on a step   on Dryades Street, between Washington and Sixth. We went to the place   indicated and found two Negroes. We interrogated them as to who they   were, what they were doing and how long they had been here. They replied   that they were working for some one and had been in town three days. At   about this stage the larger of the two Negroes got up and I grabbed him.   The Negro pulled, but I held fast, and he finally pulled me into the   street. Here I began using my billet, and the Negro jerked from my grasp   and ran. He then pulled a gun and fired. I pulled my gun and returned   the fire, each of us firing about three shots. I saw the Negro stumble   several times, and I thought I had shot him, but he ran away and I don't   know whether any of my shots took effect. Sergeant Aucoin in the   meantime held the other man fast. The man was about ten feet from me   when he fired, and the three Negresses who told us about the men stood   away about twenty-five feet from the shooting.  Thus far in the proceeding the Monday night episode results in Officer Mora lying in the station wounded in the hip; Leonard Pierce, one of the colored men, locked up in the station, and Robert Charles, the other colored man, a fugitive, wounded in the leg and sought for by the entire police force of New Orleans. Not sought for, however, to be placed under arrest and given a fair trial and punished if found guilty according to the law of the land, but sought for by a host of enraged, vindictive and fearless officers, who were coolly ordered to kill him on sight. This order is shown by the _Picayune_ of the twenty-sixth inst., in which the following statement appears:    In talking to the sergeant about the case, the captain asked about the   Negro's fighting ability, and the sergeant answered that Charles, though   he called him Robinson then, was a desperate man, and it would be best   to shoot him before he was given a chance to draw his pistol upon any of   the officers.  This instruction was given before anybody had been killed, and the only evidence that Charles was a desperate man lay in the fact that he had refused to be beaten over the head by Officer Mora for sitting on a step quietly conversing with a friend. Charles resisted an absolutely unlawful attack, and a gun fight followed. Both Mora and Charles were shot, but because Mora was white and Charles was black, Charles was at once declared to be a desperado, made an outlaw, and subsequently a price put upon his head and the mob authorized to shoot him like a dog, on sight.  The New Orleans _Picayune_ of Wednesday morning said:    But he has gone, perhaps to the swamps, and the disappointment of the   bluecoats in not getting the murderer is expressed in their curses, each   man swearing that the signal to halt that will be offered Charles will   be a shot.  In that same column of the _Picayune_ it was said:    Hundreds of policemen were about; each corner was guarded by a squad,   commanded either by a sergeant or a corporal, and every man had the word   to shoot the Negro as soon as he was sighted. He was a desperate black   and would be given no chance to take more life.  Legal sanction was given to the mob or any man of the mob to kill Charles at sight by the Mayor of New Orleans, who publicly proclaimed a reward of two hundred and fifty dollars, not for the arrest of Charles, not at all, but the reward was offered for Charles's body, \"dead or alive.\" The advertisement was as follows:    +$250 REWARD+    Under the authority vested in me by law, I hereby offer, in the name of   the city of New Orleans, $250 reward for the capture and delivery, dead   or alive, to the authorities of the city, the body of the Negro   murderer,    +ROBERT CHARLES+,    who, on Tuesday morning, July 24, shot and killed    Police Captain John T. Day and Patrolman Peter J. Lamb, and wounded    Patrolman August T. Mora.    PAUL CAPDEVIELLE, Mayor  This authority, given by the sergeant to kill Charles on sight, would have been no news to Charles, nor to any colored man in New Orleans, who, for any purpose whatever, even to save his life, raised his hand against a white man. It is now, even as it was in the days of slavery, an unpardonable sin for a Negro to resist a white man, no matter how unjust or unprovoked the white man's attack may be. Charles knew this, and knowing to be captured meant to be killed, he resolved to sell his life as dearly as possible.  The next step in the terrible tragedy occurred between 2:30 and 5 o'clock Tuesday morning, about four hours after the affair on Dryades Street. The man hunt, which had been inaugurated soon after Officer Mora had been carried to the station, succeeded in running down Robert Charles, the wounded fugitive, and located him at 2023 4th Street. It was nearly 2 o'clock in the morning when a large detail of police surrounded the block with the intent to kill Charles on sight. Capt. Day had charge of the squad of police. Charles, the wounded man, was in his house when the police arrived, fully prepared, as results afterward showed, to die in his own home. Capt. Day started for Charles's room."]]]
