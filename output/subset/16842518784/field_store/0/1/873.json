The spring is not easily wound up, but it has enormous power, and the events of to-day show that it has not lost its elasticity. But how much more might have been accomplished, how much loss and suffering prevented, had knowledge awakened more interest and a prophetic imagination guided and inspired action directed to a definite goal, had we set our ideals clearly before us and carefully thought out the steps to be taken one by one towards their realisation!  The recognition of these conditions is needed now, and will in the coming changes be needed more and more. Enthusiasm and sanity must be united to carry us safely forward. Tradition and custom will count for less either in maintaining or in preventing what is evil. Many old modes of thought, many old habits which checked us in the downward as well as hindered us in the upward path, will have been destroyed by the fire through which we have been passing. We need a conscious plan more than ever for rebuilding and good workmanship in execution detail by detail.      Image the whole, then execute the parts.         Fancy the fabric     Quite ere you build, ere steel strike fire from quartz,         Ere mortar dab brick.  Then take the trowel and see that brick by brick each course is truly laid.  But we are not building a new city on unoccupied ground; there are some foundations truly laid which have withstood the fire and storm and which cannot be disturbed without both risk and useless toil. There are still edifices standing to which time has given a beauty and tradition a sanctity which newer creations cannot possess. They cannot be removed without irreparable loss. Like any other metaphor, that of rebuilding a city as compared with the action of a state, of a nation, after a time of change and trouble, is misleading if pressed too far. Progress for a nation must rather be the growth and development of a living organism adapting itself to new conditions or altered environment. We should \"lop the moulder'd branch away,\" amputate the diseased tissue, as the true Conservative policy, and tend and foster the healthy growths with utmost care, as the true method for the Liberal who aims at improvement and fuller life.  One other thing must be said of the spirit in which the work of Reconstruction should be undertaken, which goes to the root of the whole matter, and a word must be used which we would have avoided if possible--\"the word is too often profaned for me to profane it.\" But search for a substitute has been unavailing.  There are some words which are better unspoken, except in case of necessity, that become soiled by common use. The too ready employment of them may savour indeed of that unctuous tone which makes ordinary Englishmen and boys squirm. \"Conscience\" is one. When a man speaks of his conscience you at once, and quite rightly, begin to suspect him. He is probably going to refuse some hard task which others are undertaking, to do something which is offensive to his fellows, or at best, in sheer obstinacy to insist on a course of conduct which he knows cannot be justified by reason. Someone has defined \"conscience\" as the \"deification of our prejudices\"; the giving of a kind of divine authority to something we will insist on doing though it brings no good, even causes harm, to ourselves and offends and injures others, or the giving a name which should be sacred as commanding what we want to do for other reasons. A staunch Nonconformist--one of the clearest thinkers and probably the finest preacher of the last generation--how he would have hated the phrase, but one cannot pause for another!--truly said of the passive resisters in his day, \"There is a deal more of politics than of conscience in their action.\" Yet there are times when even the word conscience may have to be used, and no other will suffice. Another is \"Duty\"--so often put forward as the excuse for people doing something stupid, probably something they have been in the habit of doing and seem unable to give up, but which is really only a nuisance to themselves and also to others. Yet there are under the abused words ideas which should be the guide of life.  The third is \"Love\"--an earnest and intense desire for the welfare of our fellow-men, keen joy in their happiness, keen sorrow in their troubles. The word is out and shall not, except perhaps in a quotation, be used again. To use the word lightly or without grave reason seems almost a breach of the third clause of the Decalogue, remembering what is said to be its equivalent by one who of all men who have lived had the most intimate means of knowing. All work of reconstruction must be inspired by a spirit of true philanthropy; without that the labour is in vain. There is no other motive power that can move the world in the path of true progress.  It will be said that this is both obvious and to be ignored--a platitude with a flavour of cant. Is it? Do we not hear again and again the appeal to envy and hatred as motives of action, a desire in social life to pull down, if levelling up is not immediately practicable? Is not jealousy of the success of others, whether individuals or classes or states, again and again what really prompts a policy? Even in dealing with the countries which are our declared enemies, the desire to injure ought not to be our guide. If and when they relinquish the aims and cease from such acts as forced us into war with them and make restitution for the wrongs they have committed, the right policy is, as far as possible, having clue regard to the just claims and interest of our friends, to do what will be for their true benefit also in the long run. No doubt there is a disgraceful and fatal policy, sometimes adopted by English Governments, to be resolutely withstood--the policy of trying \"to conciliate our enemies by giving away our friends.\" We shall hear of it again in dealing both with Ireland and with certain colonies when Germany claims their return. On the other hand, the first maxim in all negotiation, the first principle of sound diplomacy, is always to give to the other side, and give without grudging, all he wants, provided it does not interfere with what it is important for your side to secure. Never be afraid of giving the opposing party too much, provided you get what your side really ought to have. How often has one heard in discussing a settlement the objection raised that the other party is getting too much! It is an old-time fallacy to think that practical good sense and the highest philanthropy are antagonistic; only be certain that if in any case they seem to be so, the latter is to prevail.  With a good map you may safely have Mr. Worldly Wiseman's company to the village of Morality, and visit the \"judicious gentleman named Legality\" and \"his charming son Civility\"--yet find a straight road thence to the Celestial City without deviating to the \"great town\" of Carnal Policy. An apology perhaps is due in the twentieth century for using the language of an earlier day; but everyone naturally thinks in the language in which he was brought up, and education is now no doubt sufficiently general to make allusion recognisable and translation easy. There are still some survivals from a past generation who prefer even the \"minor prophets\" as literature to the most \"up-to-date\" modern utterances, though they have long ago relinquished the idea that there is the slightest personal merit in doing so. Even when the older language was half forgotten there were within our memory some who would use it if they could, and perhaps did so when they felt strongly, as a Scotsman in strange lands may, when deeply moved, revert to what convention insists on calling his \"native doric.\"  The question may fairly be put to all who are dealing with proposals for reconstruction: \"Is the aim you have in view definitely and clearly to promote the general benefit?\" Most would no doubt be able quite honestly to answer, \"Yes, that is my desire\"; but we must go a step farther, \"Are you willing to make that object paramount? If it were proved that in order to provide decent housing for a number of workers your dividends would be reduced, are you prepared still to urge that the required accommodation shall be provided? If the removal or the imposition of a particular tariff will benefit the community as a whole, are you prepared to vote for such a change, though owing to it the business in which you are personally interested may make less profit?\" There are some men whose conduct shows that an answer could be given by them in the affirmative. When the great majority can so answer with truth, we need have no fear that the rebuilding of Britain, even if mistakes are made, will be on sound foundations.  To sum up: in considering each proposal we must first examine the spirit and the aim. Try the spirit, test the aims put before us by every means in our power; venture to measure them by the moral canons of the great thinkers and seers which have stood the test of time. Adopt the rules to which the acts of those who have benefited mankind have conformed or which have received the consent of the best--the \"golden\" rule, hard though it be to apply rightly and thoroughly, or Kant's principle that each act of the individual (or community) is to be tested by the standard whether or no it can be made of universal application, whether it can command approval if taken as a guide for their actions by other men or other nations as well as our own. Goodwill and Charity, to be strong and true, must begin at home, but for their full fruition require a field which has no bounds.      That man's the best Cosmopolite     Who loves his native country best.

The ratio of the ultimate strength to the working strength is called the _factor of safety_.

Barlow's experiments give the lateral adhesion of fir as 600 lbs. per square inch, and the factor of safety employed varies in practice from 4 to 6, giving a working strength of from 150 to 100 lbs. per square inch.   =TABLE OF COMPRESSIVE RESISTANCE OF TIMBER.=    Length      Safety       Length    Safety     Length    Safety   given in    Weig't in   given in   Wt. in    given in   Wt. in   Diameters.

PRACTICAL RULES.  =Tensional Strain.=    Let T = whole tensional strain.   \"   S = strength per square inch.   \"   a = sectional area in inches.   Then we have T = Sa.  Now to find the necessary sectional area for resisting any strain, we have the following general formula:         T   a = ---        S  [TeX: $a = \\frac{T}{S}$]  or, by substituting the working strengths for the various materials in the formula, we have for wood,                    a = T/2000    Wrought Iron,   a = T/1500    Cast Iron,      a = T/4500  But, in practice, cast iron is seldom used except to resist compression.  =Strains of Compression.= Allowing the same letters to denote the same things as above, we have for    Wood, a = T/1000    Wrought Iron, a = T/12000    Cast Iron, a = T/25000  As this pamphlet has to do with wooden bridges only, nothing will be said of the proper relative dimensions of cast-iron columns to sustain the strains to which they may be subjected, but a table of the strength of columns will be found further on.  =Transverse Strains.=    Let W = breaking weight in lbs.    \"  s = constant in table.    \"  b = breadth in inches.    \"  d = depth in inches.    \"  L = length in inches.  Then, for the power of a beam to resist a transverse strain, we shall have,        4 sbd²   W = ------         L  [TeX: $W = \\frac{4 sbd^2}{L}$]  This formula has been derived from experiments made by the most reliable authorities.  The constant, 1250, adopted for wood in the following formula, is an average constant, derived from the table, of those woods more commonly used.  Now to reduce the formula to the most convenient shape for use, we substitute the value of s, and we have        4 x 1250 bd²   W = ------------,            L  [TeX: $W = \\frac{4 \\times 1250 bd^2}{L}$]  or        5000 bd²   W = --------.           L   [TeX: $W = \\frac{5000 bd^2}{L}$]  But, to reduce the load to the proper working strain, we must divide this equivalent by 4, the factor of safety, and we shall have        5000 bd²   W = --------.          4L  [TeX: $W = \\frac{5000 bd^2}{4 L}$]  Let us apply the formula--    Case I. Given a span of 14 feet,                 a breadth of 8 inches,                 a depth of 14 inches.  Required the safe load.                    5000 bd²   The formula W = --------                      4L  [TeX: $W = \\frac{5000 bd^2}{4 L}$]  becomes, by substitution,        5000 x 8 x 196   W = -------------- = 11.666 lbs.           4 x 8  [TeX: $W = \\frac{5000 \\times 8 \\times 196}{4 \\times 168} = 11,666$ lbs.]    Case II. Given the safety load 18000 lbs.                  the breadth 9 inches,                  the length 14 feet.  Required the depth. From the above formula we have           -------         / W X 4L   d =  /  ------      \\/   5000 b   [TeX: $d = \\sqrt{\\frac{w \\times 4L}{5000 b}}$]  substituting           ----------------         / 18000 x 168 x 4      ------   d =  /  --------------- =   / 268.8 = 16, inches nearly.      \\/      5000 x 9       \\/   [TeX: $d = \\sqrt{\\frac{1800 \\times 168 \\times 4}{5000 \\times 9}}  = \\sqrt{268.8} = 16$]    Case III. Given the safety load 22,400 lbs.   the depth 18 inches.   the length 14 feet.  Required the breadth. Deriving b from the foregoing, we have,          W x 4L   b = ----------       5000 x d²  [TeX: $b = \\frac{W \\times 4L}{5000 \\times d^2}$]  substituting        22400 x 4 x 168   b = --------------- = 9.3 inches nearly.         5000 x 324  [TeX: $b = \\frac{22400 \\times 4 \\times 168}{5000 \\times 324} = 9.3$]  For a cast iron beam or girder--Mr. Hodgkinson found from numerous carefully conducted experiments that, by arranging the material in the form of an inverted T--thus creating a small top flange as well as the larger bottom one, the resistance was increased, per unit of section, over that of a rectangular beam, in the ratio of 40 to 23.  In this beam the areas of the top and bottom flanges are inversely proportional to the power of the iron to resist compression and extension. Mr. Hodgkinson's formula for the dimensions of his girder, is         26 ad   W = ------          L  [TeX: $W = \\frac{26 ad}{L}$]  The factor of safety being 6 for cast iron beams--the formula for the working load will be,         26 ad   W = ------         6 L  [TeX: $W = \\frac{26 ad}{6 L}$]  and, to find area of lower flange, we shall have        6 WL   a = ----       26 d  [TeX: $a = \\frac{6 WL}{26 d}$]  The general proportions of his girders are as follows:    Length,             16   Height,              1   Area Top Flange,     1.0   Area Bottom Flange,  6.1  In the above formula for cast iron beams,    W = weight in tons.   a = area in square inches of bottom flange.   d = depth in inches.   h = length in inches.  The web uniting the two flanges must be made solid--as any opening, by causing irregularity in cooling, would seriously affect the strength of the beam.  _Example._--Required the dimensions of a Hodgkinson girder--for a span of 60 feet--with a load of 10 tons in the centre.        6 x 10 x 60 x 12   a = ---------------- = 37 inches nearly.             60 x 12        26 x -------               16  [TeX: $a = \\frac{6 \\times 10 \\times 60 \\times 12}{26 \\times \\frac{60 \\times 12}{16}} = 37$]  and the area of the top flange will be,    37   -- = 6.16 inches--   6  [TeX: $\\frac{37}{6} = 6.16$]  so that our dimensions will be as follows:    Length,              30 feet.   Depth,               45 inches.   Area Top Flange,      6.16 inches.   Area Bottom Flange,  37 inches.  [Illustration: Pl. 1.]  The thickness of web is usually a little greater at the bottom than at the top, and varies from 1/14 to 1/24 of the depth of the girder. The bottom rib is usually made from six to eight times as wide as it is thick, and the top rib from three to six times as wide as thick, so that, in the example above given, we could have as dimensions for the parts    Top Flange,     4 1/4 x 1 1/2 inches nearly.   Bottom Flange,  6 x 2 1/2 inches nearly.   Web,            1 1/2 inches thick.  The simplest bridge, consisting of a single stick, to span openings of 20 feet and under, is calculated according to the formula            ------          /  4WL   d =   / ------ --       \\/  5000 b   [TeX: $d = \\sqrt{\\frac{4 WL}{5000 b}}$]  _Example._--The depth of a beam, of 12 feet span and 12 feet wide, to support a load of 22400 lbs. will be            ------       --------------------          / 4WL        / 4 X 22400 x 12 x 12      -------   d =   / ------ =   /  ------------------- =   / 215.04 = 15 in. nearly       \\/  5000 b   \\/        5000 x 12        \\/   [TeX: $d = \\sqrt\\frac{4 WL}{5000 b}} = \\sqrt\\frac{4 \\times 22400 \\times 12 \\times 12}{5000 \\times 12} = \\sqrt{215.04} = 15$]  The following Table was calculated by the above rule--and the dimensions altered according to the actual practice of the writer.    Span.  Breadth.  Depth.      4       10       12     6       10       12     8       12       12    10       12       13    12       12       15    16       12       18    18       12       20    20       12       22  These dimensions will give ample strength and stiffness. Fig. 1, Plate I. gives an illustration of this kind of bridge--in which a, a, are the bolsters or wall plates, shown in section, to which the bridge beams are notched and bolted. Fig. 1, A, Plate I, shows the method of diagonally bracing these beams by planks, dimensions of which in general use are 6 to 8 by 2 to 3 inches. The track should rest on ties, about 6 inches by 8 or 10 inches--the same bolt confining the ends of the ties and diagonal braces when practicable. These ties should be notched on the string pieces 2 or 3 inches--without cutting "]]]
