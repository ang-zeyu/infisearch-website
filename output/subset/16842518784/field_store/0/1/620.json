Sexual inversion, as here understood, means sexual instinct turned by inborn constitutional abnormality toward persons of the same sex. It is thus a narrower term than homosexuality, which includes all sexual attractions between persons of the same sex, even when seemingly due to the accidental absence of the natural objects of sexual attraction, a phenomenon of wide occurrence among all human races and among most of the higher animals. It is only during recent years that sexual inversion has been recognized; previously it was not distinguished from homosexuality in general, and homosexuality was regarded as a national custom, as an individual vice, or as an unimportant episode in grave forms of insanity.[1] We have further to distinguish sexual inversion and all other forms of homosexuality from another kind of inversion which usually remains, so far as the sexual impulse itself is concerned, heterosexual, that is to say, normal. Inversion of this kind leads a person to feel like a person of the opposite sex, and to adopt, so far as possible, the tastes, habits, and dress of the opposite sex, while the direction of the sexual impulse remains normal. This condition I term sexo-esthetic inversion, or Eonism.      The nomenclature of the highly important form of sexual     perversion with which we are here concerned is extremely varied,     and most investigators have been much puzzled in coming to a     conclusion as to the best, most exact, and at the same time most     colorless names to apply to it.      The first in the field in modern times was Ulrichs who, as early     as 1862, used the appellation \"Uranian\" (Uranier), based on the     well-known myth in Plato's _Banquet_. Later he Germanized this     term into \"Urning\" for the male, and \"Urningin\" for the female,     and referred to the condition itself as \"Urningtum.\" He also     invented a number of other related terms on the same basis; some     of these terms have had a considerable vogue, but they are too     fanciful and high-strung to secure general acceptance. If used in     other languages than German they certainly should not be used in     their Germanized shape, and it is scarcely legitimate to use the     term \"Urning\" in English. \"Uranian\" is more correct.      In Germany the first term accepted by recognized scientific     authorities was \"contrary sexual feeling\" (Konträre     Sexualempfindung). It was devised by Westphal in 1869, and used     by Krafft-Ebing and Moll. Though thus accepted by the earliest     authorities in this field, and to be regarded as a fairly     harmless and vaguely descriptive term, it is somewhat awkward,     and is now little used in Germany; it was never currently used     outside Germany. It has been largely superseded by the term     \"homosexuality.\" This also was devised (by a little-known     Hungarian doctor, Benkert, who used the pseudonym Kertbeny) in     the same year (1869), but at first attracted no attention. It     has, philologically, the awkward disadvantage of being a bastard     term compounded of Greek and Latin elements, but its     significance--sexual attraction to the same sex--is fairly clear     and definite, while it is free from any question-begging     association of either favorable or unfavorable character. (Edward     Carpenter has proposed to remedy its bastardly linguistic     character by transforming it into \"homogenic;\" this, however,     might mean not only \"toward the same sex,\" but \"of the same     kind,\" and in German already possesses actually that meaning.)     The term \"homosexual\" has the further advantage that on account     of its classical origin it is easily translatable into many     languages. It is now the most widespread general term for the     phenomena we are dealing with, and it has been used by     Hirschfeld, now the chief authority in this field, as the title     of his encyclopedic work, _Die Homosexualität_.      \"Sexual Inversion\" (in French \"inversion sexuelle,\" and in     Italian \"inversione sessuale\") is the term which has from the     first been chiefly used in France and Italy, ever since Charcot     and Magnan, in 1882, published their cases of this anomaly in the     _Archives de Neurologie_. It had already been employed in Italy     by Tamassia in the _Revista Sperimentale di Freniatria_, in 1878.     I have not discovered when and where the term \"sexual inversion\"     was first used. Possibly it first appeared in English, for long     before the paper of Charcot and Magnan I have noticed, in an     anonymous review of Westphal's first paper in the _Journal of     Mental Science_ (then edited by Dr. Maudsley) for October, 1871,     that \"Conträre Sexualempfindung\" is translated as \"inverted     sexual proclivity.\" So far as I am aware, \"sexual inversion\" was     first used in English, as the best term, by J.A. Symonds in 1883,     in his privately printed essay, _A Problem in Greek Ethics_.     Later, in 1897, the same term was adopted, I believe for the     first time publicly in English, in the present work.      It is unnecessary to refer to the numerous other names which have     been proposed. (A discussion of the nomenclature will be found in     the first chapter of Hirschfeld's work, _Die Homosexualität_, and     of some special terms in an article by Schouten,     _Sexual-Probleme_, December, 1912.) It may suffice to mention the     ancient theological and legal term \"sodomy\" (sodomia) because it     is still the most popular term for this perversion, though, it     must be remembered, it has become attached to the physical act of     intercourse _per anum_, even when carried out heterosexually, and     has little reference to psychic sexual proclivity. This term has     its origin in the story (narrated in Genesis, ch. xix) of Lot's     visitors whom the men of Sodom desired to have intercourse with,     and of the subsequent destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah. This     story furnishes a sufficiently good ground for the use of the     term, though the Jews do not regard sodomy as the sin of Sodom,     but rather inhospitality and hardness of heart to the poor (J.     Preuss, _Biblisch-Talmudische Medizin_, pp. 579-81), and     Christian theologians also, both Catholic and Protestant (see,     e.g., _Jahrbuch für sexuelle Zwischenstufen_, vol. iv, p. 199,     and Hirschfeld, _Homosexualität_, p. 742), have argued that it     was not homosexuality, but their other offenses, which provoked     the destruction of the Cities of the Plain. In Germany \"sodomy\"     has long been used to denote bestiality, or sexual intercourse     with animals, but this use of the term is quite unjustified. In     English there is another term, \"buggery,\" identical in meaning     with sodomy, and equally familiar. \"Bugger\" (in French,     _bougre_) is a corruption of \"Bulgar,\" the ancient Bulgarian     heretics having been popularly supposed to practise this     perversion. The people of every country have always been eager to     associate sexual perversions with some other country than their     own.      The terms usually adopted in the present volume are \"sexual     inversion\" and \"homosexuality.\" The first is used more especially     to indicate that the sexual impulse is organically and innately     turned toward individuals of the same sex. The second is used     more comprehensively of the general phenomena of sexual     attraction between persons of the same sex, even if only of a     slight and temporary character. It may be admitted that there is     no precise warrant for any distinction of this kind between the     two terms. The distinction in the phenomena is, however, still     generally recognized; thus Iwan Bloch applies the term     \"homosexuality\" to the congenital form, and     \"pseudo-homosexuality\" to its spurious or simulated forms. Those     persons who are attracted to both sexes are now usually termed     \"bisexual,\" a more convenient term than \"psycho-sexual     hermaphrodite,\" which was formerly used. There remains the normal     person, who is \"heterosexual.\"  Before approaching the study of sexual inversion in cases which we may investigate with some degree of scientific accuracy, there is interest in glancing briefly at the phenomena as they appear before us, as yet scarcely or at all differentiated, among animals, among various human races, and at various periods.  Among animals in a domesticated or confined state it is easy to find evidence of homosexual attraction, due merely to the absence of the other sex.[2] This was known to the ancients; the Egyptians regarded two male partridges as the symbol of homosexuality, and Aristotle noted that two female pigeons would cover each other if no male was at hand. Buffon observed many examples, especially among birds. He found that, if male or female birds of various species--such as partridges, fowls, and doves--were shut up together, they would soon begin to have sexual relations among themselves, the males sooner and more frequently than the females. More recently Sainte-Claire Deville observed that dogs, rams, and bulls, when isolated, first became restless and dangerous, and then acquired a permanent state of sexual excitement, not obeying the laws of heat, and leading them to attempts to couple together; the presence of the opposite sex at once restored them to normal conditions.[3] Bombarda of Lisbon states that in Portugal it is well known that in every herd of bulls there is nearly always one bull who is ready to lend himself to the perverted whims of his companions.[4] It may easily be observed how a cow in heat exerts an exciting influence on other cows, impelling them to attempt to play the bull's part. Lacassagne has "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13611"],["title","Studies in the Psychology of Sex, Volume 2 (#2)"],["body","noted among young fowls and puppies, etc., that, before ever having had relations with the opposite sex, and while in complete liberty, they make hesitating attempts at intercourse with their own sex.[5] This, indeed, together with similar perversions, may often be observed, especially in puppies, who afterward become perfectly normal. Among white rats, which are very sexual animals, Steinach found that, when deprived of females, the males practise homosexuality, though only with males with whom they have long associated; the weaker rats play the passive part. But when a female is introduced they immediately turn to her; although they are occasionally altogether indifferent to sex, they never actually prefer their own sex.[6]  With regard to the playing of the female part by the weaker rats it is interesting to observe that Féré found among insects that the passive part in homosexual relations is favored by fatigue; among cockchafers it was the male just separated from the female who would take the passive part (on the rare occasions when homosexual relations occurred) with a fresh male.[7]  Homosexuality appears to be specially common among birds. It was among birds that it attracted the attention of the ancients, and numerous interesting observations have been made in more recent times. Thus Selous, a careful bird-watcher, finds that the ruff, the male of the _Machetes pugnax_, suffers from sexual repression owing to the coyness of the female (the reeve), and consequently the males often resort to homosexual intercourse. It is still more remarkable that the reeves also, even in the presence of the males, will court each other and have intercourse.[8] We may associate this with the high erotic development of birds, the difficulty with which tumescence seems to occur in them, and their long courtships.  Among the higher animals, again, female monkeys, even when grown up (as Moll was informed), behave in a sexual way to each other, though it is difficult to say how far this is merely in play. Dr. Seitz, Director of the Frankfurt Zoölogical Garden, gave Moll a record of his own careful observations of homosexual phenomena among the males and females of various animals confined in the Garden (_Antelope cervicapra, Bos Indicus, Capra hircus, Ovis steatopyga_).[9] In all such cases we are not concerned with sexual inversion, but merely with the accidental turning of the sexual instinct into an abnormal channel, the instinct being called out by an approximate substitute, or even by diffused emotional excitement, in the absence of the normal object.  It is probable, however, that cases of true sexual inversion--in which gratification is preferably sought in the same sex--may be found among animals, although observations have rarely been made or recorded. It has been found by Muccioli, an Italian authority on pigeons, that among Belgian carrier-pigeons inverted practices may occur, even in the presence of many of the other sex.[10] This seems to be true inversion, though we are not told whether these birds were also attracted toward the opposite sex. The birds of this family appear to be specially liable to sexual perversion. Thus M.J. Bailly-Maitre, a breeder of great knowledge and a keen observer, wrote to Girard that \"they are strange creatures in their manners and customs and are apt to elude the most persistent observer. No animal is more depraved. Mating between males, and still more frequently between females, often occurs at an early age: up to the second year. I have had several pairs of pigeons formed by subjects of the same sex who for many months behaved as if the mating were natural. In some cases this had taken place among young birds of the same nest, who acted like real mates, though both subjects were males. In order to mate them productively we have had to separate them and shut each of them up for some days with a female.\"[11] In the Berlin Zoölogical Gardens also, it has been noticed that two birds of the same sex will occasionally become attached to each other and remain so in spite of repeated advances from individuals of opposite sex. This occurred, for instance, in the case of two males of the Egyptian goose who were thus to all appearance paired, and always kept together, vigorously driving away any female that approached. Similarly a male Australian sheldrake was paired to a male of another species.[12]  Among birds generally, inverted sexuality seems to accompany the development of the secondary sexual characters of the opposite sex which is sometimes found. Thus, a poultry-breeder describes a hen (colored Dorking) crowing like a cock, only somewhat more harshly, as a cockerel crows, and with an enormous comb, larger than is ever seen in the male. This bird used to try to tread her fellow-hens. At the same time she laid early and regularly, and produced \"grand chickens.\"[13] Among ducks, also, it has occasionally been observed that the female assumes at the same time both male livery and male sexual tendencies. It is probable that such observations will be multiplied in the future, and that sexual inversion in the true sense will be found commoner among animals than at present it appears to be.  Traces of homosexual practices, sometimes on a large scale, have been found among all the great divisions of the human race. It would be possible to collect a considerable body of evidence under this head.[14] Unfortunately, however, the travellers and others on whose records we are dependent have been so shy of touching these subjects, and so ignorant of the main points for investigation, that it is very difficult to discover sexual inversion in the proper sense in any lower race. Travellers have spoken vaguely of crimes against nature without defining the precise relationship involved nor inquiring how far any congenital impulse could be distinguished.  Looking at the phenomena generally, so far as they have been recorded among various lower races, we seem bound to recognize that there is a widespread natural instinct impelling men toward homosexual relationships, and that this has been sometimes, though very exceptionally, seized upon and developed for advantageous social purposes. On the whole, however, unnatural intercourse (sodomy) has been regarded as an antisocial offense, and punishable sometimes by the most serious penalties that could be invented. This was, for instance, the case in ancient Mexico, in Peru, among the Persians, in China, and among the Hebrews and Mohammedans.  Even in very early history it is possible to find traces of homosexuality, with or without an implied disapproval. Its existence in Assyria and Babylonia is indicated by the Codex Hamurabi and by inscriptions which do not on the whole refer to it favorably.[15] As regards Egypt we learn from a Fayum papyrus, found by Flinders Petrie, translated by Griffiths, and discussed by Oefele,[16] that more than four thousand years ago homosexual practices were so ancient that they were attributed to the gods Horus and Set. The Egyptians showed great admiration of masculine beauty, and it would seem that they never regarded homosexuality as punishable or even reprehensible. It is notable, also, that Egyptian women were sometimes of very virile type, and Hirschfeld considers that intermediate sexual types were specially widespread among the Egyptians.[17]  One might be tempted to expect that homosexual practices would be encouraged whenever it was necessary to keep down the population. Aristotle says that it was allowed by law in Crete for this end. And Professor Haddon tells me that at Torres Straits a native advocated sodomy on this ground.[18] There seems, however, on the whole, to be little evidence pointing to this utilization of the practice. The homosexual tendency appears to have flourished chiefly among warriors and warlike peoples. During war and the separation from women that war involves, the homosexual instinct tends to develop; it flourished, for instance, among the Carthaginians and among the Normans, as well as among the warlike Dorians, Scythians, Tartars, and Celts,[19] and, when there has been an absence of any strong moral feeling against it, the instinct has been cultivated and, idealized as a military virtue, partly because it counteracts the longing for the softening feminine influences of the home and partly because it seems to have an inspiring influence in promoting heroism and heightening _esprit de corps_. In the lament of David over Jonathan we have a picture of intimate friendship--\"passing the love of women\"--between comrades in arms among a barbarous, warlike race. There is nothing to show that such a relationship was sexual, but among warriors in New Caledonia friendships that were undoubtedly homosexual were recognized and regulated; the fraternity of arms, according to Foley,[20] complicated with pederasty, was more sacred than uterine fraternity. We have, moreover, a recent example of the same relationships recognized in a modern European race--the Albanians.      Hahn, in the course of his _Albanische Studien_ (1854, p. 166),     says that the young men between 16 and 24 lore boys from about 12     to 17. A Gege marries at the age of 24 or 25, and then he     usually, but not always, gives up boy-love. The following passage     is reported by Hahn as the actual language used to him by an     Albanian Gege: \"The lover's feeling for the boy is pure as     sunshine. It places the beloved on the same pedestal as a saint.     It is the highest and most exalted passion of which the human     breast is capable. The sight of a beautiful youth awakens     astonishment in the lover, and opens the door of his heart to the     delight which the contemplation of this loveliness affords. Love     takes possession of him so completely that all his thought and     feeling goes out in it. If he finds himself in the presence of     the beloved, he rests absorbed in gazing on him. Absent, he     thinks of "]]]
