Then he searched the forest with keen, suspicious glances.  \"Come, Paul,\" he said, \"we must run. The woods are full of the savages. I've found out that there's a great war party between us and Marlowe, and I've hid the powder in a cave. I turned the horses loose, hoping that we'll get 'em some time later; but just now you and I have to save ourselves.\"  Paul came back to earth. Danger still threatened! But he was free for the time, and he was with his comrade!  \"You lead the way, Henry,\" he said. \"I'll follow, and do whatever you say.\"  Henry Ware made no reply, but bent his ear again, in the attitude of one who listens. Paul watched his face attentively, seeking to read his knowledge there.  \"The big war band is not far away,\" said Henry, \"and it's likely that they've heard my shot. It would carry far on such a still, clear morning as this. I didn't want them to hear it.\"  \"But I'm glad you did shoot,\" said Paul. \"It was a mighty welcome sound to me.\"  \"Yes,\" said Henry, with grim humor, \"it was the right thing at the right time. Hark to that!\" A single note, very faint and very far, rose and was quickly gone, like the dying echo of music. Only the trained ranger of the wilderness would have noticed it at all, but Henry Ware knew.  \"Yes, they've heard,\" he said, \"and they're telling it to each other. They are also telling it to us. They're between us and Marlowe, and they are between us and Wareville, so we must run to the north, and run as fast as we can.\"  He led the way with swift, light footsteps through the forest, and Paul followed close behind, each boy carrying on his shoulder two rifles and at his waist a double stock of bullets and powder.  Paul scarcely felt any fear now for the future. The revulsion from the stake and torture was so great that it did not seem to him that he could be taken again. Moreover, they had seized him the first time when he was asleep. They had taken an unfair advantage.  The sun rose higher, gilding the brown forest with fine filmy gold, like a veil, and the boys ran silently on among the trees and the undergrowth. Behind them, and spread out like a fan, came many warriors, fierce for their lives. Amid such scenes was the Great West won.     CHAPTER II  IN THE RIVER   Paul, while not the equal of Henry in the woods, was a strong and enduring youth. His muscles were like wire, and there were few better runners west of the mountains. Although the weight of the second rifle might tell after a while, he did not yet feel it, and with springy step he sped after Henry, leaving the choice of course and all that pertained to it to his comrade. After a while they heard a second cry--a wailing note--and Henry raised his head a little.  \"They've come to the two who fell,\" he said.  But after the single lament, the warriors were silent, and Paul heard nothing more in the woods but their own light footsteps and his own long breathing. Little birds flitted through the boughs of the trees, and now and then a hare hopped up and ran from their path. The silence became terrible, full of omens and presages, like the stillness before coming thunder.  \"It means something,\" said Henry; \"I think we've stumbled into a regular nest of those Shawnees, and they're likely to be all about us.\"  As if confirming his words, the far, faint note came from their right, and then, in reply, from their left. Henry stopped so quickly that Paul almost ran into him.  \"I was afraid it would be that way,\" he said. \"They're certainly all around us except in front, and maybe there, too.\"  Visions of the torture rose before Paul again.  \"What are we to do?\" he said.  \"We must hide.\"  \"Hide I Why, they could find us in the forest, as I would find a man in an open field.\"  \"I don't mean hide here,\" said Henry; \"the river is just ahead, and I think that if we reach it in time we can find a place. Come, Paul, we must run as we never ran before.\"  The two boys sped with long, swift bounds through the forest as only those who run for their lives can run. Now the voices of the pursuit became frequent, and began to multiply. Henry, with his instinctive skill in the forest, read their meaning. The pursuers were sure of triumph. But Henry shut his lips tightly, and resolved that he and Paul should yet elude them.  \"The river is not more than a half mile ahead,\" he said. \"Come, Paul, faster! A little faster, if you can!\"  Paul obeyed, and the two, bending their heads lower, sped on with astonishing speed. Trees and bushes slid behind them. Before them appeared a blue streak, that broadened swiftly and became a river.  \"We must not let them see us,\" said Henry. \"Bend as low as you can, and be as quiet as you can!\"  Paul obeyed, and in a few more minutes they were at the river's edge.  \"Fasten your bullets and powder around your neck,\" said Henry, \"and keep the rifle on your shoulder.\"  Paul did so, following Henry's quick example, and the two stepped into the water, which soon reached to their waists. Henry had been along this river before, and at this crisis in the lives of his comrade and himself he remembered. Dense woods lined both banks of the stream, which was narrow here for miles, and a year or two before a hurricane had cut down the trees as a reaper mows the wheat. The surface of the water was covered with fallen trunks and boughs, and for a half mile at least they had become matted together like a great raft, out of which grass and weeds already were growing. But Paul did not know it, and suddenly he stopped.  \"Why, what has become of the river?\" he exclaimed, pointing ahead.  The stream seemed to stop against a bank of logs and foliage.  Henry laughed softly.  \"It is the great natural raft,\" he said. \"There is where we are to hide.\"  He hastened his steps, wading as rapidly as he could, and Paul kept by his side. He comprehended Henry's plan, their last and desperate chance. In a few moments more they were at the great raft, and in the bank, amid a dense, almost impenetrable mass of foliage, they hid their rifles and ammunition. Henry uttered a deep sigh as he did it.  \"I hate like everything to leave them,\" he said, \"but if we come to close quarters with any of those fellows, we must trust to our knives and hatchets.\"  Then he turned reluctantly away. It was not a deep river, nowhere above their necks, and he pushed a way amid the trees and foliage that were packed upon the surface, Paul, as usual, following closely. Now and then he dived under a big log, and came up on the other side, his head well hidden among upthrust boughs and among the weeds and grass that had grown in the soil formed by the silt of the river. And Paul always carefully imitated him.  When they were about thirty yards into the mass Paul felt Henry's hand on his shoulder. \"Look back, Paul,\" was whispered in his ear, \"but be sure not to move a single bough.\" Paul slowly and cautiously turned his head, and saw a sight that made him quiver.  Running swiftly, savage warriors were coming into view on either bank of the river--tall men, dark with paint, and, as he well knew, hot with the desire to take life.  \"I thank God that this place is here!\" breathed Paul.  \"Yes, it was just made for us,\" said Henry, and he laughed ever so little. \"Come, Paul, we must get farther into it. But be sure you don't shake any boughs.\"  They waded on, only their heads above the current, and these always hidden by the interlacing trunks and branches. A great shout, fierce with triumph, rose behind them.  \"They've found where our trail entered the water, and they think they've got us,\" whispered Henry. \"Now, be still, Paul; we'll hide here.\"  They pushed themselves into a mass of debris, where logs and boughs, swept by the current, formed a little arch over the stream. There they stood up to their chins in water, with their heads covered by the arch. Through the slits between the trunks and boughs they could see their pursuers.  It was a numerous band--thirty or forty men--and they divided now into several parties. Some ran along the banks of the stream and others sprang from log to log over the raft, searching everywhere, with keen, black eyes trained to note every movement of the wilderness.  Paul felt Henry's hand again on his shoulder, but neither boy spoke. Both felt as if they were in a little cage, with the fiercest of all wild animals around it and reaching long paws through the bars at them. Each sank a little deeper into the water, barely leaving room to breathe, and watched their enemies still searching, searching everywhere. They heard the patter of moccasins on the logs, and now and then they saw brown, muscular legs passing by. Two warriors stopped within ten feet of them and exchanged comment. Henry, who understood their language, knew that they were puzzled and angry. But Paul, without knowing a word that they said, understood, too. His imagination supplied the place of knowledge. They were full of wrath because they had lost the trail of the two whom they had regarded as certainly theirs, and to seek them in the vast maze of logs and brush was like looking for one dead leaf among the millions.  The two warriors stood still for a full minute, and then moved on out of sight. Paul drew a deep breath of relief, like a sigh, and Henry's hand was pressed once more upon his shoulder.  \"Not a sound yet, not a sound, Paul!\" he whispered ever so softly. \"They will hunt here a long time.\"  More warriors, treading on the logs, showed that his caution was not misplaced. They poked now and then in the water, amid the great mass of debris, and one stood on a log so near to the two lads that they could have reached out and touched his moccasined feet. But their covert was too close to be suspected, and soon the man passed on.  Presently all of them were out of sight; but Henry, a true son of caution and the wilderness, would not yet let Paul stir.  \"They will come back this way,\" he said. \"We risk nothing by"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14880"],["title","McGuffey's Fourth Eclectic Reader (#1)"],["body","O'er, for over; 't is, for it is.

(9)  ELEMENTARY SOUNDS  Articulation is the utterance of the elementary sounds of a language, and of their combinations.  An Elementary Sound is a simple, distinct sound made by the organs of speech.  The Elementary Sounds of the English language are divided into Vocals, Subvocals, and Aspirates.  Vocals are those sounds which consist of pure tone only. They are the most prominent elements of speech. A diphthong is a union of two vocals, commencing with one and ending with the other.  Subvocals are those sounds in which the vocalized breath is more or less obstructed.  Aspirates consist of breath only, modified by the vocal organs.   VOCALS.  DIRECTIONS FOR ARTICULATION.  1. Let the mouth be open, and the teeth, tongue, and palate in their proper position.  2. Pronounce the word in the CHART forcibly, and with the falling inflection, several times in succession; then drop the subvocal or aspirate sounds which precede or follow the vocal, and repeat the vocals alone.   TABLE.  Long Vocals.  Sound   Word    Sound   Word a       hate    e       err a       hare    i       pine a       far     o       no a       pass    u       tube a       fall    u       burn e       eve     oo      cool  Short Vocals.

The difference consists chiefly in quantity. As a rule, the long vocals should be prolonged with a full, clear utterance; but the short vocals should be uttered sharply and almost explosively.  Diphthongs.  oi, oy, as in coin, boy.        ou, ow, as in noun, now.   SUBVOCALS AND ASPIRATES.  DIRECTIONS FOR ARTICULATION.  Pronounce distinctly and forcibly, several times in succession, words in which these sounds occur as elements; then drop the other sounds, and repeat the subvocals and aspirates alone. Each subvocal in the first table should be practiced in connection with its cognate sound.  Let the class repeat the words and elements, at first in concert; then separately.  Select words ending with subvocal sounds for practice on subvocals; words beginning or ending with aspirate sounds, for practice on aspirates.   COGNATE SOUNDS.  Subvocals               Aspirates Sound  Example          Sound   Example b      babe             p       rap d      rod              t       at g      fog              k       book j      judge            ch      chat v      live             f       file th     them             th      myth z      buzz             s       sink zh     azure            sh      shine w      win              wh      when   REMARK.--These eighteen sounds make nine pairs of cognate sounds. In articulating the aspirates, the vocal organs are put in the position as required for the articulation of the corresponding subvocals; but the breath is expelled with some force, without the utterance of any vocal sound. Let the pupil verify this by experiment, and then practice on these cognates.  The following sounds are not cognates.  SUB VOCALS.
