Jan squirmed around and touched the hand with his nose, then edged nearer Brother Antoine, who called the dogs about him.  It was a splendid sight to see them cross the enclosure, their great heads held proudly, their eyes beaming with intelligence and kindness, the strong muscles moving beneath the tawny skins, as though each one of them, old and young, understood that the honor of his forefathers must be guarded from any act that would injure it.  Bruno limped slowly, Jan's mother walked sedately beside him, back of them were Jupiti√©re, Junon, Mars, Vulcan, Pluton, Leon, and among the older dogs came those the same age as Jan and Rollo, followed by the mothers with still smaller puppies. They reached a place in the yard where all of them stopped, and though the man in the fur coat, who stood a distance back of Brother Antoine and the younger man, called to them, the dogs only wagged their tails and did not go any closer.  \"You will have to come further,\" said the monk. \"The dogs know that they must not cross to you, for the first thing a puppy learns is to respect the boundary line.\"  The fur-coated man moved to where Brother Antoine and the other man stood, then the dogs grouped about while the monk talked to the visitors.  \"They seem to understand every word you say,\" the old man spoke. \"Their eyes are so intelligent.\"  \"They are living sermons on obedience, loyalty, and self-sacrifice,\" answered Brother Antoine's gentle voice. \"Not one of these dogs would hesitate to risk his life to save his most bitter enemy. That has been their heritage for almost a thousand years, now.\"  \"Natural instinct counts for a great deal,\" the grey-eyed man spoke as he looked into the upturned faces of the dogs, \"but the patient training you give them has developed it.\"  \"The older dogs help us teach the youngsters,\" went on the monk, whose hand rested on Jan's head. \"We send out four dogs each morning--two younger ones and two of the old ones. One pair goes on the trail down the Italian slope toward Aosta, the other travels the Swiss path leading to Martigny. None of them turns back until the last cabin of refuge has been reached, where they look to see if any person is waiting. It is not unusual for the dogs to stay out all night in a hard storm. There have been many instances of their remaining away for two days and nights, without food or shelter, though at any time they could have come home.\"  \"Our guide showed us the cabin,\" interrupted the older man. \"The footprints of the dogs proved they had been there a short time before us. We followed their tracks until the storm covered them. It was a lucky thing the storm did not break earlier.\"  \"The dogs would have found you, Mr. Pixley,\" the monk replied. \"You see, since we have had a telephone from the Hospice, each time travellers start up the trails, we know when they leave Martigny or Aosta and how many are on the way. If they do not reach here in reasonable time, or a storm breaks, we send out the dogs at once. It was much harder in the other days, before we had telephones, for we could not tell how many poor souls were struggling in the snow. The dogs seemed to understand, too, and so they kept on searching until they believed they had found all.\"  \"I would not have attempted this trip had I not been assured that it was too early for a bad storm,\" said Mr. Pixley. \"It is foolhardy, not courageous, to face these mountains in a winter storm. I cannot imagine any one being so rash as to try it, but I suppose many do?\"  \"During the winter only poor peasants travel the Pass,\" was Brother Antoine's answer. \"They cross from Italy to seek work in the vineyards of France or Switzerland for the summer. When summer is over they return home this way, because it would mean a long and expensive trip by rail, which would take all they have earned for a whole year. An entire family will travel together, and often the youngest will be a babe in its mother's arms.\"  \"I should think they would wait till later in the summer, and take no risks.\"  \"Only the good God knows when a snow storm will overtake one in the Pass of Great St. Bernard,\" Brother Antoine said. \"Even in our summer months, when a light shower of rain falls in the Valley below, it becomes a heavy snow up here, and many people are taken unawares. After winter really begins, in September, the snow is often from seven to ten feet deep and the drifts pile up against the walls of the Hospice as high as the third story roof.\"  \"I had planned to visit Berne,\" Mr. Pixley spoke now, \"but after this sample of your winter weather I have decided to return home to California. I do not enjoy snow storms. We have none where I live, you know.\"  Brother Antoine nodded. \"Yes, I know; but I hope some day you will visit Berne and see Barry. His skin was mounted and is kept in the Museum at Berne. You know his record? He saved forty-two people and died in 1815, just after the terrible storm that cost the lives of almost all the Hospice dogs. Only three St. Bernards lived through those days--Barry, Pluto, and Pallas. A few crawled home to die of exhaustion and cold; the rest lie buried under thousands of feet of snow, but they all died like heroes!\"  \"A glorious record!\" exclaimed the younger man, who had been patting Jan while the others talked. \"I remember, when I was a very small boy, that I found a picture in a book. It showed a St. Bernard dog digging a man from the snow, and last night I recognized the picture in that painting which hangs over the fireplace in the refectory.\"  \"It was a gift from a noted artist,\" replied the monk. \"The dogs used to carry a little saddle with a warm shawl, but the extra weight was hard on them, so we do not use the saddle any longer, but a flagon, or wooden keg of white brandy that we call 'kirsch,' is fastened to the collar, together with a bell, so that the tinkling will tell that help is near, even though it may be too dark for any one to see the dog.\"  \"I notice that most of the dogs are short-haired,\" the grey-eyed man observed. \"Such fur as this pup's would afford better protection against the cold. He has a magnificent coat of hair!\"  \"That is the only point against him,\" said Brother Antoine. \"During the big storm of 1815 we learned that long-haired dogs break down from the snow clinging and freezing like a coat of mail; or the thick hair holding moisture developed pneumonia. We brought Newfoundland dogs to fill the kennels when only three St. Bernards were left, but the long, heavy hair of the new breed that was part Newfoundland and part St. Bernard proved a failure. They could not stand the snow storms. Now, we very rarely keep a long-haired pup. He is generally sold or presented to some one who will give him kind treatment.\"  Jan looked suddenly at Rollo and the other puppies near him. All except himself had short hair. Now he remembered his mother's worried eyes each time the monks had examined him. He hurried to her side and pushed her with his nose, as he whispered, \"Mother, will they send me away because I have long hair? You know, Brother Antoine said that I was one of the best dogs they have had for a long time!\"  \"Don't worry, Jan,\" she soothed him. \"Even though your fur is long, you are so strong and so like your father, who had long hair, too, that I am sure you will be kept here. Hurry, Jan I Brother Antoine is calling you back.\"  Jan pushed among the other dogs until he stood again at the monk's side. The two strangers looked at Jan, and Brother Antoine touched the pup's head lovingly.  \"His father was one of our best dogs,\" the monk spoke. \"But that was not surprising. He was a direct descendant of Barry. Four travellers owe their lives to Jan's father, Rex.\"  The little fellow tried not to look too proud as he listened again to the story his mother had told him and Rollo many times.  \"Rex was guiding four men to the Hospice after a big storm last Fall. It was the worst since 1815. The men told us the story after they reached us. They had lost all hope, their guide had fallen down a crevasse and they were exhausted when Rex found them. They knew that their only chance of life was to follow him. He went ahead, moving very slowly and looking back while he barked to encourage them. An ice-bridge had formed. It was hidden by deep snow and they did not understand the danger that Rex knew so well. The dog went ahead, the men keeping closely behind him. Half way across he turned and began barking fiercely, and as they drew nearer, he started toward them uttering savage snarls.  \"They thought the dog had gone mad, and backed away as he advanced threateningly. Then suddenly his snarl turned to a mournful howl that was lost in frightful cracking as the ice-bridge broke away. Rex was never seen again, but his warning prevented those four men from being smothered in the chasm under hundreds of feet of snow. So, you see, this little fellow comes of royal blood. That is why we named him 'Prince Jan.' He looks just like his father, too!\"  Jan thrust his warm nose into Brother Antoine's hand.  \"I want to be like my father and Barry,\" he said, hoping they would understand him, as he understood them. \"I will do my very best to be worthy of them both!\"  The visitors and the monk did not know what Jan said, but the other dogs understood. Bruno's dim eyes beamed on the pup.  \"You will be a credit to us all, Prince Jan!\"  The strangers and Brother Antoine left the yard, and the dogs formed in little groups to talk among themselves, as they always did when new people came to see them.  \"That man came from America,\" Bruno said to Jan's mother.  \"Lots of people from America visit us,\" she replied, trying not to yawn, for the storm had kept her awake. All night, while she felt the warm little bodies of the puppies pressed against her side, she had stared into the darkness, thinking of the time when Prince Jan and his brother must go out, like their father, Rex, to do the work of the St. Bernards.  \"Yes,\""]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/149"],["title","The Lost Continent (#1)"],["body","iful; but they could not deceive us as to the blackness and the terrors of the storm-lashed ocean which they hid.  I was at breakfast when my chief engineer entered and saluted. His face was grave, and I thought he was even a trifle paler than usual.  ‚ÄúWell?‚Äù I asked.  He drew the back of his forefinger nervously across his brow in a gesture that was habitual with him in moments of mental stress.  ‚ÄúThe gravitation-screen generators, sir,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúNumber one went to the bad about an hour and a half ago. We have been working upon it steadily since; but I have to report, sir, that it is beyond repair.‚Äù  ‚ÄúNumber two will keep us supplied,‚Äù I answered. ‚ÄúIn the meantime we will send a wireless for relief.‚Äù  ‚ÄúBut that is the trouble, sir,‚Äù he went on. ‚ÄúNumber two has stopped. I knew it would come, sir. I made a report on these generators three years ago. I advised then that they both be scrapped. Their principle is entirely wrong. They‚Äôre done for.‚Äù And, with a grim smile, ‚ÄúI shall at least have the satisfaction of knowing my report was accurate.‚Äù  ‚ÄúHave we sufficient reserve screen to permit us to make land, or, at least, meet our relief halfway?‚Äù I asked.  ‚ÄúNo, sir,‚Äù he replied gravely; ‚Äúwe are sinking now.‚Äù  ‚ÄúHave you anything further to report?‚Äù I asked.  ‚ÄúNo, sir,‚Äù he said.  ‚ÄúVery good,‚Äù I replied; and, as I dismissed him, I rang for my wireless operator. When he appeared, I gave him a message to the secretary of the navy, to whom all vessels in service on thirty and one hundred seventy-five report direct. I explained our predicament, and stated that with what screening force remained I should continue in the air, making as rapid headway toward St. Johns as possible, and that when we were forced to take to the water I should continue in the same direction.  The accident occurred directly over 30¬∞ and about 52¬∞ N. The surface wind was blowing a tempest from the west. To attempt to ride out such a storm upon the surface seemed suicidal, for the Coldwater was not designed for surface navigation except under fair weather conditions. Submerged, or in the air, she was tractable enough in any sort of weather when under control; but without her screen generators she was almost helpless, since she could not fly, and, if submerged, could not rise to the surface.  All these defects have been remedied in later models; but the knowledge did not help us any that day aboard the slowly settling Coldwater, with an angry sea roaring beneath, a tempest raging out of the west, and 30¬∞ only a few knots astern.  To cross thirty or one hundred seventy-five has been, as you know, the direst calamity that could befall a naval commander. Court-martial and degradation follow swiftly, unless as is often the case, the unfortunate man takes his own life before this unjust and heartless regulation can hold him up to public scorn.  There has been in the past no excuse, no circumstance, that could palliate the offense.  ‚ÄúHe was in command, and he took his ship across thirty!‚Äù That was sufficient. It might not have been in any way his fault, as, in the case of the Coldwater, it could not possibly have been justly charged to my account that the gravitation-screen generators were worthless; but well I knew that should chance have it that we were blown across thirty today‚Äîas we might easily be before the terrific west wind that we could hear howling below us, the responsibility would fall upon my shoulders.  In a way, the regulation was a good one, for it certainly accomplished that for which it was intended. We all fought shy of 30¬∞ on the east and 175¬∞ on the west, and, though we had to skirt them pretty close, nothing but an act of God ever drew one of us across. You all are familiar with the naval tradition that a good officer could sense proximity to either line, and for my part, I am as firmly convinced of the truth of this as I am that the compass finds the north without recourse to tedious processes of reasoning.  Old Admiral Sanchez was wont to maintain that he could smell thirty, and the men of the first ship in which I sailed claimed that Coburn, the navigating officer, knew by name every wave along thirty from 60¬∞N. to 60¬∞S. However, I‚Äôd hate to vouch for this.  Well, to get back to my narrative; we kept on dropping slowly toward the surface the while we bucked the west wind, clawing away from thirty as fast as we could. I was on the bridge, and as we dropped from the brilliant sunlight into the dense vapor of clouds and on down through them to the wild, dark storm strata beneath, it seemed that my spirits dropped with the falling ship, and the buoyancy of hope ran low in sympathy.  The waves were running to tremendous heights, and the Coldwater was not designed to meet such waves head on. Her elements were the blue ether, far above the raging storm, or the greater depths of ocean, which no storm could ruffle.  As I stood speculating upon our chances once we settled into the frightful Maelstrom beneath us and at the same time mentally computing the hours which must elapse before aid could reach us, the wireless operator clambered up the ladder to the bridge, and, disheveled and breathless, stood before me at salute. It needed but a glance at him to assure me that something was amiss.  ‚ÄúWhat now?‚Äù I asked.  ‚ÄúThe wireless, sir!‚Äù he cried. ‚ÄúMy God, sir, I cannot send.‚Äù  ‚ÄúBut the emergency outfit?‚Äù I asked.  ‚ÄúI have tried everything, sir. I have exhausted every resource. We cannot send,‚Äù and he drew himself up and saluted again.  I dismissed him with a few kind words, for I knew that it was through no fault of his that the mechanism was antiquated and worthless, in common with the balance of the Coldwaterl‚Äôs equipment. There was no finer operator in Pan-America than he.  The failure of the wireless did not appear as momentous to me as to him, which is not unnatural, since it is but human to feel that when our own little cog slips, the entire universe must necessarily be put out of gear. I knew that if this storm were destined to blow us across thirty, or send us to the bottom of the ocean, no help could reach us in time to prevent it. I had ordered the message sent solely because regulations required it, and not with any particular hope that we could benefit by it in our present extremity.  I had little time to dwell upon the coincidence of the simultaneous failure of the wireless and the buoyancy generators, since very shortly after the Coldwater had dropped so low over the waters that all my attention was necessarily centered upon the delicate business of settling upon the waves without breaking my shipl‚Äôs back. With our buoyancy generators in commission it would have been a simple thing to enter the water, since then it would have been but a trifling matter of a forty-five degree dive into the base of a huge wave. We should have cut into the water like a hot knife through butter, and have been totally submerged with scarce a jar‚ÄîI have done it a thousand times‚Äîbut I did not dare submerge the Coldwater for fear that it would remain submerged to the end of time‚Äîa condition far from conducive to the longevity of commander or crew.  Most of my officers were older men than I. John Alvarez, my first officer, is twenty years my senior. He stood at my side on the bridge as the ship glided closer and closer to those stupendous waves. He watched my every move, but he was by far too fine an officer and gentleman to embarrass me by either comment or suggestion.  When I saw that we soon would touch, I ordered the ship brought around broadside to the wind, and there we hovered a moment until a huge wave reached up and seized us upon its crest, and then I gave the order that suddenly reversed the screening force, and let us into the ocean. Down into the trough we went, wallowing like the carcass of a dead whale, and then began the fight, with rudder and propellers, to force the Coldwater back into the teeth of the gale and drive her on and on, farther and farther from relentless thirty.  I think that we should have succeeded, even though the ship was wracked from stem to stern by the terrific buffetings she received, and though she were half submerged the greater part of the time, had no further accident befallen us.  We were making headway, though slowly, and it began to look as though we were going to pull through. Alvarez never left my side, though I all but ordered him below for much-needed rest. My second officer, Porfirio Johnson, was also often on the bridge. He was a good officer, but a man for whom I had conceived a rather unreasoning aversion almost at the first moment of meeting him, an aversion which was not lessened by the knowledge which I subsequently gained that he looked upon my rapid promotion with jealousy. He was ten years my senior both in years and service, and I rather think he could never forget the fact that he had been an officer when I was a green apprentice.  As it became more and more apparent that the Coldwater, under my seamanship, was weathering the tempest and giving promise of pulling through safely, I could have sworn that I perceived a shade of annoyance and disappointment growing upon his dark countenance. He left the bridge finally and went below. I do not know that he is directly responsible for what followed so shortly after; but I have always had my suspicions, and Alvarez is even more prone to place the blame upon him than I.  It was about six bells of the forenoon watch that Johnson returned to the bridge after an absence of some thirty minutes. He seemed nervous and ill at ease‚Äîa fact which made little impression on me at the time, but which both Alvarez and I recalled subsequently.  Not three minutes after his reappearance at my side the Coldwater suddenly commenced to lose headway. I seized the telephone at my elbow, pressing upon the button which would call the chief engineer to the instrument in the bowels of the ship, only to find him already at the receiver attempting to reach me.  ‚ÄúNumbers one, two,"]]]
