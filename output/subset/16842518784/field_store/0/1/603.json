The Saxons came from part of the land that is now known as Germany, and the Vikings from Denmark and from Scandinavia.  A third important tribe was that of the Goths, who dwelt first in South Sweden, and then in Germany.  All these people resembled one another in their way of life, in their religion, and in their ideas of what deeds were good and what were evil. Their lands were barren--too mountainous or too cold to bring forth fruitful crops, and their homes were not such as would tempt men never to leave them. So, though they built their little groups of wooden houses in the valleys of their lands, and made fields and pastures about them, these were often left to the care of the women and the feeble men, while the strong men made raids over the sea to other countries, where they engaged in the fighting which they loved, and whence they brought back plunder to their homes. North, South, East, and West they went, till few parts of Europe had not learnt to know and fear them.  Their ships were long and narrow, driven often by oars as well as sails, and outside them, along the bulwarks, the crew hung their round shields made of yellow wood from the lime-tree. The men wore byrnies or breast-plates, and helmets, and they were armed with swords, long spears, or heavy battle-axes. They were enemies none could afford to despise, for they had great stature and strength of body, joined to such fierceness and delight in war that they held a man disgraced if he died peacefully at home. Moreover, they knew nothing of mercy to the conquered.  Courage, not only to fight, but also to bear suffering without impatience or complaint, and the virtue of faithfulness were the qualities they most honoured. To be wanting in courage was disgraceful in their eyes, but it was equally disgraceful to refuse to help kinsfolk, to lie, to deceive, or to desert a chief.  If they put their enemies to death with fearful tortures, they did not treat them more severely than the traitors they discovered among themselves, and if they had no pity for those they conquered, yet they knew well how to admire great leaders, and how to serve them faithfully. But we can best realise their ideas on these matters by considering their religion and their stories.  They worshipped one chief god, Odin, and other gods and goddesses who were his children. Odin was often called All-father because he was the helper and friend of human beings, and appeared on earth in the form of an old man, \"one-eyed and seeming ancient,\" with cloud-blue hood and grey cloak. He had courage, strength, and wondrous wisdom, for he knew all events that happened in the world, and he understood the speech of birds, and all kinds of charms and magic arts. Men served him by brave fighting in a good cause, and when they perished in battle he received their souls in his dwelling of Valhalla in the city of Asgard, where they spent each day in warfare, and where at evening the dead were revived, the wounded healed, and all feasted together in Odin's palace. There they fed upon the flesh of the boar Saehrimner, which was renewed as fast as it was eaten. Certain maidens called Valkyrie, or Choosers of the Slain, were Odin's messengers whom he sent forth into the battles of the world to find the warriors whom he had appointed to die, and to bring them to Valhalla.  In the story of Sigurd Odin has a very important part to play, but for the understanding of the tale it is necessary to know something about another of the gods. This is Loki, who, though sprung from the race of the giants, yet lived with the sons of Odin in Asgard, behaving sometimes as their trusty helper, but more often as their cunning enemy. He caused much wretchedness, not only among the gods, but on earth also, for he delighted in the sight of misery. His vices were all those most hateful to the Norse people, for he was before all things a liar, a deceiver, a faith-breaker, a skilful worker of mischief by guile instead of by fair fight. There are many stories of his cunning thefts, of the miseries he wrought among his companions, and of his envy of the beloved god Balder, whom he slew by a trick. His children were terrible monsters, as hated as himself. Yet, strange to say, Loki was Odin's companion in many of his adventures.  The gods inhabited Asgard, a city standing on a high mountain in the middle of the world. Odin's palace of Valhalla was there, and other palaces for his sons and daughters. All round Asgard lay Midgard, or the ordinary world of men and women. Its caves and waste places were inhabited by dwarfs, whom Odin had banished from the light of day for various ill deeds. They were a spiteful and cunning race, jealous of mankind, and eager to recover their lost power. Their strength lay in their wondrous skill in handicraft, for they could forge more deadly weapons, and fashion more lovely jewels than any made by the hands of men. But, though possessed of wisdom, they had no spirit of kindness, no respect for right, and no dislike of wrong.  Around Midgard lay the sea, and beyond that Utgard, a hideous frozen country inhabited by giants, enemies of the gods.  But this arrangement of the world was only for a season. The gods themselves looked forward to a time of defeat and death, when Asgard should perish in flames and the world with it, and the sun and moon should be darkened, and they themselves should be slain. This great day was called Ragnarok, or sometimes the Twilight of the Gods. Then Loki would gather giants and monsters to a great battle against the gods, who would slay their enemies, but who would themselves fall in the struggle. The sea would drown the earth, the stars would fall, and all things would pass away.  This terrible fate the gods awaited with calm and cheerfulness, showing even greater courage than in their many deeds of war. They had to submit to this fate, for there were three beings even greater than they. These were the Norns, deciders of the fate of gods and men alike. They were three giant maidens who dwelt by a sacred, wisdom-giving fountain, and who controlled the lives of men, giving to each sickness and health, success and failure and death when they would. No man or god might escape what the Norns decreed for him.  Many stories of these gods, together with tales of famous men, were told among the northern peoples. These stories were passed on from one to another by word of mouth, till they grew much longer and fuller, and the happening of certain historical events helped to take them from country to country.  As we have seen, all the races of the North were warlike and eager for adventure, and so when trouble came upon them in their own homes, they readily took to the sea to plunder the coasts or to conquer other lands. Between 800 and 900 A.D., when the Danes were invading England, many were driven from Norway because they refused to submit to a king called Harold Fairhair, and when he pursued them to the Orkney and Faroe Islands they took refuge on the coasts of Iceland. There they settled, built themselves wooden houses, planted such crops as would grow in that bleak land, and founded a commonwealth. Little by little they left the old Viking life, and it lived only in their songs and stories.  They had come to Iceland with a vast stock of tales in poetry, which were related or sung by professional poets, called skalds, at all kinds of feasts and gatherings. The skalds arranged and improved the old stories, but they were not written down until about the time of our King Stephen, when some unknown writer collected them into one book called the Elder Edda. Very soon after this another book was written containing the same stories in prose and called the Younger or Prose Edda. In this way many of the old poems, and a great many stories containing much information about the religion which the people took with them to Iceland, have been preserved.  But it was from neither of the Eddas that William Morris took his story of Sigurd.  All through the period from 800 A.D. till about the time of Henry III. of England, the skalds had been re-telling many of the poetic stories in prose, and as the people grew more civilised, one tale after another was written down in its new form.  These prose tales were called Sagas, and among the very greatest is the Volsunga Saga, or Story of Sigurd. It is a tale which has been told in other lands besides Iceland. We read part of the same story in the Old English poem of Beowulf, and in Germany it was made into a great poem called the Nibelungenlied. The German musician, Richard Wagner, set it to music in a famous series of operas called the Nibelungen Ring. But his tale differs in many points from that contained in Morris's poem, for Morris chose the old saga as it was written in Iceland, not the German story. On this he founded his poem, adding much beautiful description, and greatly lengthening the whole.  The story deals first with a certain King Volsung, to whose son, Sigmund, Odin presented a magic sword.  But Siggeir, the jealous king of the Goths, slew Volsung, and took Sigmund prisoner that he might have the sword for himself. Only after many toils and perils did Sigmund win it back and reign in his father's kingdom. At last in his old age he fell in battle and the sword of Odin was shattered. But his wife, Queen Hiordis, kept the fragments for the son who was born to her soon after in Denmark, whither she fled for safety. This son of Sigmund and Hiordis was Sigurd the Volsung. He was brought up in Denmark and grew strong and beautiful, brave, kind of heart, and utterly truthful in word and deed.  When he became a man he longed to win fame and kingship by mighty deeds, and when his tutor told him of a great dragon that guarded a hoard of ill-gotten gold in "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13486"],["title","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung (#2)"],["body","mountains, he resolved to kill it. So the fragments of Odin's sword were forged into a new blade, and Sigurd slew the dragon and took the gold, but with it he brought on himself a curse which had been put upon the treasure by the dwarf from whom it had been stolen.  Sigurd then found and wakened Brynhild, a maiden who lay in an enchanted sleep upon a high mountain. They loved one another, and Sigurd gave her a ring from the dragon's treasure, promising to return and marry her.  Then the curse led him to join with the fierce and treacherous Niblungs or Cloudy People. Their king and his mother grew jealous when they saw Sigurd more mighty and more beloved than themselves, and by enchantments they caused him to forget Brynhild, to wed the princess Gudrun, and at last to aid the Niblung king, Gunnar, to win Brynhild for his own wife.  Then the curse of the gold brought death to many, for Sigurd and Brynhild discovered all the treachery of the Niblungs, who, in their anger, slew Sigurd, and Brynhild killed herself that she might not live and sorrow for him.  Such is the story of Sigurd as it was told a thousand years ago in distant Iceland, and as it is retold in this poem by William Morris.     THE STORY OF SIGURD THE VOLSUNG.   BOOK I.  SIGMUND.   _Of the dwelling of King Volsung, and the wedding of Signy his daughter._     There was a dwelling of Kings ere the world was waxen old;   Dukes were the door-wards there, and the roofs were thatched with gold:   Earls were the wrights that wrought it, and silver nailed its doors;   Earls' wives were the weaving-women, queens' daughters strewed its floors,   And the masters of its song-craft were the mightiest men that cast   The sails of the storm of battle adown the bickering blast.   There dwelt men merry-hearted, and in hope exceeding great   Met the good days and the evil as they went the way of fate:   There the Gods were unforgotten, yea whiles they walked with men,   Though e'en in that world's beginning rose a murmur now and again   Of the midward time and the fading and the last of the latter days,   And the entering in of the terror, and the death of the People's Praise.    Thus was the dwelling of Volsung, the King of the Midworld's Mark,   As a rose in the winter season, a candle in the dark;   And as in all other matters 'twas all earthly houses' crown,   And the least of its wall-hung shields was a battle-world's renown,   So therein withal was a marvel and a glorious thing to see,   For amidst of its midmost hall-floor sprang up a mighty tree,   That reared its blessings roofward, and wreathed the roof-tree dear   With the glory of the summer and the garland of the year.   I know not how they called it ere Volsung changed his life,   But his dawning of fair promise, and his noontide of the strife,   His eve of the battle-reaping and the garnering of his fame,   Have bred us many a story and named us many a name;   And when men tell of Volsung, they call that war-duke's tree,   That crowned stem, the Branstock; and so was it told unto me.    So there was the throne of Volsung beneath its blossoming bower,   But high o'er the roof-crest red it rose 'twixt tower and tower,   And therein were the wild hawks dwelling, abiding the dole of their lord;   And they wailed high over the wine, and laughed to the waking sword.    Still were its boughs but for them, when lo, on an even of May   Comes a man from Siggeir the King with a word for his mouth to say:   \"All hail to thee King Volsung, from the King of the Goths I come:   He hath heard of thy sword victorious and thine abundant home;   He hath heard of thy sons in the battle, the fillers of Odin's Hall;   And a word hath the west-wind blown him, (full fruitful be its fall!)   A word of thy daughter Signy the crown of womanhood:   Now he deems thy friendship goodly, and thine help in the battle good,   And for these will he give his friendship and his battle-aid again:   But if thou wouldst grant his asking, and make his heart full fain,   Then shalt thou give him a matter, saith he, without a price,   --Signy the fairer than fair, Signy the wiser than wise.\"  Now the message gladdened Volsung and his sons, but no word spake Signy, till the king asked her what her mind might be. Then said Signy, \"I will wed the Goth king, and yet shall I rue my lot in his hall.\" And Volsung urged her with kind words to do nought against her will, but her mind was fixed, and she said she wrought but what the gods had fore-ordained. So the earl of Siggeir went his way with gifts and fair words, bidding the Goth king come ere a month was over to wed the white-handed Signy and bear her home.    So on Mid-Summer Even ere the undark night began   Siggeir the King of the Goth-folk went up from the bath of the swan   Unto the Volsung dwelling with many an Earl about;   There through the glimmering thicket the linked mail rang out,   And sang as mid the woodways sings the summer-hidden ford:   There were gold-rings God-fashioned, and many a Dwarf-wrought sword,   And many a Queen-wrought kirtle and many a written spear;   So came they to the acres, and drew the threshold near,   And amidst of the garden blossoms, on the grassy, fruit-grown land,   Was Volsung the King of the Wood-world with his sons on either hand;   Therewith down lighted Siggeir the lord of a mighty folk,   Yet showed he by King Volsung as the bramble by the oak,   Nor reached his helm to the shoulder of the least of Volsung's sons.   And so into the hall they wended, the Kings and their mighty ones;   And they dight the feast full glorious, and drank through the death of the        day,   Till the shadowless moon rose upward, till it wended white away;   Then they went to the gold-hung beds, and at last for an hour or twain   Were all things still and silent, save a flaw of the summer rain.    But on the morrow noontide when the sun was high and bare,   More glorious was the banquet, and now was Signy there,   And she sat beside King Siggeir, a glorious bride forsooth;   Ruddy and white was she wrought as the fair-stained sea-beast's tooth,   But she neither laughed nor spake, and her eyes were hard and cold,   And with wandering side-long looks her lord would she behold.   That saw Sigmund her brother, the eldest Volsung son,   And oft he looked upon her, and their eyes met now and anon,   And ruth arose in his heart, and hate of Siggeir the Goth,   And there had he broken the wedding, but for plighted promise and troth.   But those twain were beheld of Siggeir, and he deemed of the Volsung kin,   That amid their might and their malice small honour should he win;   Yet thereof made he no semblance, but abided times to be,   And laughed out with the loudest, amid the hope and the glee.   And nought of all saw Volsung, as he dreamed of the coming glory,   And how the Kings of his kindred should fashion the round world's story.    So round about the Branstock they feast in the gleam of the gold;   And though the deeds of man-folk were not yet waxen old,   Yet had they tales for songcraft, and the blossomed garth of rhyme;   Tales of the framing of all things and the entering in of time   From the halls of the outer heaven; so near they knew the door.   Wherefore uprose a sea-king, and his hands that loved the oar   Now dealt with the rippling harp-gold, and he sang of the shaping of earth,   And how the stars were lighted, and where the winds had birth,   And the gleam of the first of summers on the yet untrodden grass.   But e'en as men's hearts were hearkening some heard the thunder pass   O'er the cloudless noontide heaven; and some men turned about   And deemed that in the doorway they heard a man laugh out.   Then into the Volsung dwelling a mighty man there strode,   One-eyed and seeming ancient, yet bright his visage glowed:   Cloud-blue was the hood upon him, and his kirtle gleaming-grey   As the latter morning sundog when the storm is on the way:   A bill he bore on his shoulder, whose mighty ashen beam   Burnt bright with the flame of the sea and the blended silver's gleam.   And such was the guise of his raiment as the Volsung elders had told   Was borne by their fathers' fathers, and the first that warred in the wold.    So strode he to the Branstock nor greeted any lord,   But forth from his cloudy raiment he drew a gleaming sword,   And smote it deep in the tree-hole, and the wild hawks overhead   Laughed 'neath the naked heaven as at last he spake and said:    \"Earls of the Goths, and Volsungs, abiders on the earth,   Lo there amid the Branstock a blade of plenteous worth!   The folk of the war-wand's forgers wrought never better steel   Since first the burg of heaven uprose for man-folk's weal.   Now let the man among you whose heart and hand may shift   To pluck it from the oakwood e'en take it for my gift.   Then ne'er, but his own heart falter, its point and edge shall fail   Until the night's beginning and the ending of the tale.   Be merry Earls of the Goth-folk, O Volsung Sons be wise   And reap the battle-acre that ripening for you lies:   For they told me in the wild wood, I heard on the mountain side,   That the shining house of heaven is wrought exceeding wide,   And that there the Early-comers shall have abundant rest   While Earth grows scant of great ones, and fadeth from its best,   And fadeth from its midward and groweth poor and vile:--   All hail to thee King Volsung! farewell for a little while!\"    So sweet his speaking sounded, so wise his words did seem,   That moveless all men sat there, as in a happy dream   We stir not lest we waken; but there his speech had end,   And slowly down the hall-floor, and outward did he wend;   And none would cast him a question or follow on his ways,   For they knew that the gift was Odin's, a sword for the world to praise.    But now spake Volsung the King: \"Why sit ye silent and still?   Is the Battle-Father's visage a token of terror and ill?   Arise O Volsung Children, Earls of the Goths"]]]
