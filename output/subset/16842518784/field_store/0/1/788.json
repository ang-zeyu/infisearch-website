The child, exhausted with the heat and weight of her thick armor of clothes, panted and struggled after him at first with some difficulty. She said nothing, but her little eyes kept watching first Peter, as he sprang nimbly hither and thither on his bare feet, clad only in his short light breeches, and then the slim-legged goats that went leaping over rocks and shrubs and up the steep ascents with even greater ease. All at once she sat herself down on the ground, and as fast as her little fingers could move, began pulling off her shoes and stockings. This done she rose, unwound the hot red shawl and threw it away, and then proceeded to undo her frock. It was off in a second, but there was still another to unfasten, for Dete had put the Sunday frock on over the everyday one, to save the trouble of carrying it. Quick as lightning the everyday frock followed the other, and now the child stood up, clad only in her light short-sleeved under garment, stretching out her little bare arms with glee. She put all her clothes together in a tidy little heap, and then went jumping and climbing up after Peter and the goats as nimbly as any one of the party. Peter had taken no heed of what the child was about when she stayed behind, but when she ran up to him in her new attire, his face broke into a grin, which grew broader still as he looked back and saw the small heap of clothes lying on the ground, until his mouth stretched almost from ear to ear; he said nothing, however. The child, able now to move at her ease, began to enter into conversation with Peter, who had many questions to answer, for his companion wanted to know how many goats he had, where he was going to with them, and what he had to do when he arrived there. At last, after some time, they and the goats approached the hut and came within view of Cousin Dete. Hardly had the latter caught sight of the little company climbing up towards her when she shrieked out: \"Heidi, what have you been doing! What a sight you have made of yourself! And where are your two frocks and the red wrapper? And the new shoes I bought, and the new stockings I knitted for you--everything gone! not a thing left! What can you have been thinking of, Heidi; where are all your clothes?\"  The child quietly pointed to a spot below on the mountain side and answered, \"Down there.\" Dete followed the direction of her finger; she could just distinguish something lying on the ground, with a spot of red on the top of it which she had no doubt was the woollen wrapper.  \"You good-for-nothing little thing!\" exclaimed Dete angrily, \"what could have put it into your head to do like that? What made you undress yourself? What do you mean by it?\"  \"I don't want any clothes,\" said the child, not showing any sign of repentance for her past deed.  \"You wretched, thoughtless child! have you no sense in you at all?\" continued Dete, scolding and lamenting. \"Who is going all that way down to fetch them; it's a good half-hour's walk! Peter, you go off and fetch them for me as quickly as you can, and don't stand there gaping at me, as if you were rooted to the ground!\"  \"I am already past my time,\" answered Peter slowly, without moving from the spot where he had been standing with his hands in his pockets, listening to Dete's outburst of dismay and anger.  \"Well, you won't get far if you only keep on standing there with your eyes staring out of your head,\" was Dete's cross reply; \"but see, you shall have something nice,\" and she held out a bright new piece of money to him that sparkled in the sun. Peter was immediately up and off down the steep mountain side, taking the shortest cut, and in an incredibly short space of time had reached the little heap of clothes, which he gathered up under his arm, and was back again so quickly that even Dete was obliged to give him a word of praise as she handed him the promised money. Peter promptly thrust it into his pocket and his face beamed with delight, for it was not often that he was the happy possessor of such riches.  \"You can carry the things up for me as far as Uncle's, as you are going the same way,\" went on Dete, who was preparing to continue her climb up the mountain side, which rose in a steep ascent immediately behind the goatherd's hut. Peter willingly undertook to do this, and followed after her on his bare feet, with his left arm round the bundle and the right swinging his goatherd's stick, while Heidi and the goats went skipping and jumping joyfully beside him. After a climb of more than three-quarters of an hour they reached the top of the Alm mountain. Uncle's hut stood on a projection of the rock, exposed indeed to the winds, but where every ray of sun could rest upon it, and a full view could be had of the valley beneath. Behind the hut stood three old fir trees, with long, thick, unlopped branches. Beyond these rose a further wall of mountain, the lower heights still overgrown with beautiful grass and plants, above which were stonier slopes, covered only with scrub, that led gradually up to the steep, bare rocky summits.  Against the hut, on the side looking towards the valley, Uncle had put up a seat. Here he was sitting, his pipe in his mouth and his hands on his knees, quietly looking out, when the children, the goats and Cousin Dete suddenly clambered into view. Heidi was at the top first. She went straight up to the old man, put out her hand, and said, \"Good-evening, Grandfather.\"  \"So, so, what is the meaning of this?\" he asked gruffly, as he gave the child an abrupt shake of the hand, and gazed long and scrutinisingly at her from under his bushy eyebrows. Heidi stared steadily back at him in return with unflinching gaze, for the grandfather, with his long beard and thick grey eyebrows that grew together over his nose and looked just like a bush, was such a remarkable appearance, that Heidi was unable to take her eyes off him. Meanwhile Dete had come up, with Peter after her, and the latter now stood still a while to watch what was going on.  \"I wish you good-day, Uncle,\" said Dete, as she walked towards him, \"and I have brought you Tobias and Adelaide's child. You will hardly recognise her, as you have never seen her since she was a year old.\"  \"And what has the child to do with me up here?\" asked the old man curtly. \"You there,\" he then called out to Peter, \"be off with your goats, you are none too early as it is, and take mine with you.\"  Peter obeyed on the instant and quickly disappeared, for the old man had given him a look that made him feel that he did not want to stay any longer.  \"The child is here to remain with you,\" Dete made answer. \"I have, I think, done my duty by her for these four years, and now it is time for you to do yours.\"  \"That's it, is it?\" said the old man, as he looked at her with a flash in his eye. \"And when the child begins to fret and whine after you, as is the way with these unreasonable little beings, what am I to do with her then?\"  \"That's your affair,\" retorted Dete. \"I know I had to put up with her without complaint when she was left on my hands as an infant, and with enough to do as it was for my mother and self. Now I have to go and look after my own earnings, and you are the next of kin to the child. If you cannot arrange to keep her, do with her as you like. You will be answerable for the result if harm happens to her, though you have hardly need, I should think, to add to the burden already on your conscience.\"  Now Dete was not quite easy in her own conscience about what she was doing, and consequently was feeling hot and irritable, and said more than she had intended. As she uttered her last words, Uncle rose from his seat. He looked at her in a way that made her draw back a step or two, then flinging out his arm, he said to her in a commanding voice: \"Be off with you this instant, and get back as quickly as you can to the place whence you came, and do not let me see your face again in a hurry.\"  Dete did not wait to be told twice. \"Good-bye to you then, and to you too, Heidi,\" she called, as she turned quickly away and started to descend the mountain at a running pace, which she did not slacken till she found herself safely again at Dorfli, for some inward agitation drove her forwards as if a steam-engine was at work inside her. Again questions came raining down upon her from all sides, for every one knew Dete, as well as all particulars of the birth and former history of the child, and all wondered what she had done with it. From every door and window came voices calling: \"Where is the child?\" \"Where have you left the child, Dete?\" and more and more reluctantly Dete made answer, \"Up there with Alm-Uncle!\" \"With Alm-Uncle, have I not told you so already?\"  Then the women began to hurl reproaches at her; first one cried out, \"How could you do such a thing!\" then another, \"To think of leaving a helpless little thing up there,\"--while again and again came the words, \"The poor mite! the poor mite!\" pursuing her as she went along. Unable at last to bear it any longer Dete ran forward as fast as she could until she was beyond reach of their voices. She was far from happy at the thought of what she had done, for the child had been left in her care by her dying mother. She quieted herself, however, with the idea that she would be better able to do something for the child if she was earning plenty of money, and it was a relief to her to think that she would soon be far away from all these people who were making such a fuss about the matter, and she rejoiced further still that she was at liberty now to take such a good place.    CHAPTER II. AT HOME WITH GRANDFATHER  As soon as Dete had disappeared the old man went back to his bench, and there he remained seated, staring on the ground without uttering a sound, while thick curls of smoke floated upward from his pipe. Heidi, meanwhile, was enjoying herself in her new surroundings; she looked about till she "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14486"],["title","The Thunder Bird (#1)"],["body","n't going to take me in as one more kid to look after.  I'll come in as his equal in honesty and business ability,--instead of just a new fad of Mary V's--\"  \"Well, for gracious sake, Johnny!  If you feel that way about it, why didn't you say so?  You don't seem to care what I think, or how I feel about it.  You don't seem to care whether you ever get married or not. And I'm sure I wasn't the one that did the proposing.  Why, it will take years and _years_ to square up with dad, if you insist on doing it in a regular business way--\"  Johnny's harsh laugh stopped her.  \"You see, you do know where I stand, after all.  If I let it slide, the way you want me to, that's exactly what you'd be thinking after awhile--that I never had squared up with your dad.  You'd look down on me, and so would your father and your mother.  They'd always be afraid I'd do some fool thing and sting your dad again for a few thousand.\"  \"Well, of all the crazy talk!  And I've gone to the trouble of coaxing dad to give you a share in the Rolling R instead of putting it in his will for me.  And dad's going to do it--\"  \"Oh, no, he isn't.  I don't want any share in the Rolling R.  I'd go to jail before I'd take it.\"  Mary V produced woman's final argument.  \"If you cared anything at all for me, Johnny, when I ask you to come back and do what dad is willing to have you do, you'd do it.  I don't see how you can be stubborn enough to refuse such a perfectly wonderful offer.  You wouldn't, if you cared a snap about me.  You act just as if you were sorry--\"  \"Aw, lay off that don't-care stuff!\" Johnny growled indignantly. \"Caring for you has got nothing to do with it, I tell you.  It's just simply a question of what kinda mark I am.  You know I care!\"  \"Well, then, if you do you'll come right over here.  If you start now you can be here by sundown, and it's nice and quiet and no wind at all. You've absolutely no excuse, Johnny, and you know it.  When dad's willing to forget about those horses--\"  \"When I come, your dad won't have anything to forget about,\" Johnny reiterated obstinately.  \"I do wish you'd look at the thing right!\"  Mary V changed her tactics, relying now upon intimidation.  \"I shall begin to look for you in about an hour,\" she said sweetly.  \"I shall keep on looking till you come, or till it gets too dark.  If you care anything about me, Johnny, you'll be here.  I'll have dinner all ready, so you needn't wait to eat.\"  Then she hung up.  Johnny rattled the hook impatiently, called hello with irritated insistence, and finally succeeded in raising Central's impersonal: \"Number, please?\"  Whereupon he flung himself angrily out of the booth.  \"Do you want to pay at this end?\"  The girl at the desk looked up at him with a gleam of curiosity.  Mentally Johnny accused her of \"listening in.\"  He snapped an affirmative at her and waited until \"long distance\" told her the amount.  \"Four dollars and eighty-five cents,\" she announced, giving him a pert little smile.  Johnny flipped a small gold piece to the desk and marched off, scorning his fifteen cents change with the air of a millionaire.  Johnny was angry, grieved, disappointed, worried--and would have been wholly miserable had not his anger so dominated his other emotions that he could continue mentally his argument against the attitude of Mary V and the Rolling R.  They refused to take him seriously, which hurt Johnny's self-esteem terribly.  Were he older, were he a property owner, Sudden Selmer would not so lightly wave aside that debt.  He would pay Johnny the respect of fighting for his just rights.  But no--just because he was barely of age, just because he was Johnny Jewel, they all acted as though--why, darn 'em, they acted as though he was a kid offering to earn money to pay for a broken plate!  And Mary V--  Well, Mary V was a great little girl, but she would have to learn some day that Johnny was master.  He considered this as good a day as any for the lesson.  Better, because he was really upholding his principles by not going to the ranch meekly submissive, because Mary V had announced that she would be looking for him.  Johnny winced from the thought of Mary V, out on the porch, watching the sky toward Tucson for the black speck that would be his airplane; listening for the high, strident drone that would herald his coming.  She would cry herself to sleep.  But she had deliberately sentenced herself to tears and disappointment, he told himself sternly.  She must have known he was in earnest about not coming.  She had no right to think she could kid him out of something big and vital to his honor.  She ought to know him by this time.  Briefly he considered returning to the hotel and calling up the ranch, just to tell her not to look for him because he was not coming.  But the small matter of paying the toll deterred him.  It was humiliating to admit, even to himself, that he could not afford another long-distance conversation with Mary V, but he had come to the point in his finances where a two-bit piece looked large as a dollar.  He would miss that small gold piece.  Since the government had refused to consider accepting his services and paying him a bonus for his plane, he would have to sell it--if he could.  There it sat, reared up on its two little wheels, its nose poked rakishly out of an old shed that had been remodelled to accommodate it, its tail sticking out at the other side so that it slightly resembled a turtle with its shell not quite covering its extremities.  The Mexican boy whom Johnny had hired to watch the plane in his absence lay asleep under one wing.  A faint odor of varnish testified to the heat of the day that was waning toward a sultry night.  Without disturbing the boy Johnny rolled a smoke and stood, as he had stood many and many a time, staring at his prize and wondering what to do with it.  He had to have money.  That was flat, final, admitting no argument.  At a reasonable estimate, three thousand dollars were tied up in that machine.  He could not afford to sell it for any less.  Yet there did not seem to be a man in the country willing to pay three thousand dollars for it.  It was a curiosity, a thing to come out and stare at, a thing to admire; but not to buy, even though Johnny had as an added inducement offered to teach the buyer to fly before the purchase price was taken from the bank.  The stalking shadow of a man moving slowly warned Johnny of an approaching visitor.  He did not trouble to turn his head; he even moved farther into the shed, to tighten a turnbuckle that was letting a cable sag a little.  \"Hello, old top--how they using yuh?\" greeted a voice that had in it a familiar, whining note.  Johnny's muscles stiffened.  Hostility, suspicion, surprise surged confusingly through his brain.  He turned as one who was bracing himself to meet an enemy, with a primitive prickling where the bristles used to rise on the necks of our cavemen ancestors.     CHAPTER TWO  AND THE CAT CAME BACK  \"Why, hello, Bland,\" Johnny exclaimed after the first blank silence. \"I thought you was tied up in a sack and throwed into the pond long ago!\"  The visitor grinned with a sour droop to his mouth, a droop which Johnny knew of old.  \"But the cat came back,\" he followed the simile, blinking at Johnny with his pale, opaque blue eyes.  \"What yuh doing here?  Starting an aviation school?\"  \"Yeah.  Free instruction.  Want a lesson?\" Johnny retorted, only half the sarcasm intended for Bland; the rest going to the town that had failed to disgorge a buyer for what he had to sell.  \"Aw, I suppose you think you could give me lessons, now you've learned to do a little straightaway flying without landing on your tail,\" Bland fleered, with the impatience of the seasoned flyer for the novice who thinks well of himself and his newly acquired skill.  \"Say, that was some bump you give yourself on the dome when we lit over there in that sand patch.  I tried to tell yuh that sand looked loose--\"  \"Yes, you did--not!  You was scared stiff.  Your face looked like the inside of a raw bacon rind!\"  \"Sure, I was scared.  So would you of been if you'd a known as much about it as I knew.  I knew we was due to pile up, when you grabbed the control away from me.  You'll make a flyer, all right--and a good one, if yuh last long enough.  But you can't learn it all in a day, bo--take it from me.  Anyway, I got no kick to make.  It was you and the plane that got the bumps.  All I done was bite my tongue half off!\"  Boy that he was, Johnny laughed over this.  The idea of Bland biting his tongue tickled him and served to blur his antagonism for the tricky aviator who had played so large a part in his salvaging of this very airplane.  \"Uh course you'll laugh--but you wasn't laughing then.  I'll say you wasn't.  I thought you was croaked.  Cost something to repair the plane, too.  I'm saying it did.  Had to have a new propeller, and a new crank-case for the motor--cost the old man at the ranch close to three hundred dollars before I turned her over to him, ready to take the air again.  That's including what he paid me, of course.  But I guess you know what it cost, when he handed you the bill.\"  This was news to Johnny, news that made his soul squirm.  Lying there sick at the Rolling R ranch, he had not known what was taking place. He had found his airplane ready to fly, when he was at last able to walk out to the corrals, but no one seemed to know how much the repairing had cost.  Certainly Sudden Selmer himself had suffered a lapse of memory on the subject.  All the more reason then why Johnny should repay his debt.  \"What I'm wondering about is why you aren't in Los Angeles,\" he evaded the unpleasant subject awkwardly.  \"Old Sudden gave you money to go, and dumped you at the depot, didn't he?  That's what Mary V told me.\"  \"He did--and I missed my train.  And while I was waiting for the next I must 'a' et something poison.  I was awful sick.  I guess it was ten days or so before I come "]]]
