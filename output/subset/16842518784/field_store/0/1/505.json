Then the Butcher contrived an ingenious plan           For making a separate sally;      And had fixed on a spot unfrequented by man,           A dismal and desolate valley.       But the very same plan to the Beaver occurred:           It had chosen the very same place:      Yet neither betrayed, by a sign or a word,           The disgust that appeared in his face.       Each thought he was thinking of nothing but “Snark”            And the glorious work of the day;      And each tried to pretend that he did not remark           That the other was going that way.       But the valley grew narrow and narrower still,           And the evening got darker and colder,      Till (merely from nervousness, not from goodwill)           They marched along shoulder to shoulder.       Then a scream, shrill and high, rent the shuddering sky,           And they knew that some danger was near:      The Beaver turned pale to the tip of its tail,           And even the Butcher felt queer.       He thought of his childhood, left far far behind--           That blissful and innocent state--      The sound so exactly recalled to his mind           A pencil that squeaks on a slate!       “’Tis the voice of the Jubjub!” he suddenly cried.           (This man, that they used to call “Dunce.”)      “As the Bellman would tell you,” he added with pride,           “I have uttered that sentiment once.       “’Tis the note of the Jubjub! Keep count, I entreat;           You will find I have told it you twice.      ’Tis the song of the Jubjub! The proof is complete,           If only I’ve stated it thrice.”       The Beaver had counted with scrupulous care,           Attending to every word:      But it fairly lost heart, and outgrabe in despair,           When the third repetition occurred.       It felt that, in spite of all possible pains,           It had somehow contrived to lose count,      And the only thing now was to rack its poor brains           By reckoning up the amount.       “Two added to one--if that could but be done,”            It said, “with one’s fingers and thumbs!”       Recollecting with tears how, in earlier years,           It had taken no pains with its sums.       “The thing can be done,” said the Butcher, “I think.           The thing must be done, I am sure.      The thing shall be done! Bring me paper and ink,           The best there is time to procure.”       The Beaver brought paper, portfolio, pens,           And ink in unfailing supplies:      While strange creepy creatures came out of their dens,           And watched them with wondering eyes.       So engrossed was the Butcher, he heeded them not,           As he wrote with a pen in each hand,      And explained all the while in a popular style           Which the Beaver could well understand.       “Taking Three as the subject to reason about--           A convenient number to state--      We add Seven, and Ten, and then multiply out           By One Thousand diminished by Eight.       “The result we proceed to divide, as you see,           By Nine Hundred and Ninety Two:      Then subtract Seventeen, and the answer must be           Exactly and perfectly true.       “The method employed I would gladly explain,           While I have it so clear in my head,      If I had but the time and you had but the brain--           But much yet remains to be said.       “In one moment I’ve seen what has hitherto been           Enveloped in absolute mystery,      And without extra charge I will give you at large           A Lesson in Natural History.”       In his genial way he proceeded to say           (Forgetting all laws of propriety,      And that giving instruction, without introduction,           Would have caused quite a thrill in Society),       “As to temper the Jubjub’s a desperate bird,           Since it lives in perpetual passion:      Its taste in costume is entirely absurd--           It is ages ahead of the fashion:       “But it knows any friend it has met once before:           It never will look at a bribe:      And in charity-meetings it stands at the door,           And collects--though it does not subscribe.       “Its’ flavour when cooked is more exquisite far           Than mutton, or oysters, or eggs:      (Some think it keeps best in an ivory jar,           And some, in mahogany kegs:)       “You boil it in sawdust: you salt it in glue:           You condense it with locusts and tape:      Still keeping one principal object in view--           To preserve its symmetrical shape.”       The Butcher would gladly have talked till next day,           But he felt that the lesson must end,      And he wept with delight in attempting to say           He considered the Beaver his friend.       While the Beaver confessed, with affectionate looks           More eloquent even than tears,      It had learned in ten minutes far more than all books           Would have taught it in seventy years.       They returned hand-in-hand, and the Bellman, unmanned           (For a moment) with noble emotion,      Said “This amply repays all the wearisome days           We have spent on the billowy ocean!”       Such friends, as the Beaver and Butcher became,           Have seldom if ever been known;      In winter or summer, ’twas always the same--           You could never meet either alone.       And when quarrels arose--as one frequently finds           Quarrels will, spite of every endeavour--      The song of the Jubjub recurred to their minds,           And cemented their friendship for ever!                          Fit the Sixth                    THE BARRISTER’S DREAM        They sought it with thimbles, they sought it with care;           They pursued it with forks and hope;      They threatened its life with a railway-share;           They charmed it with smiles and soap.       But the Barrister, weary of proving in vain           That the Beaver’s lace-making was wrong,      Fell asleep, and in dreams saw the creature quite plain           That his fancy had dwelt on so long.       He dreamed that he stood in a shadowy Court,           Where the Snark, with a glass in its eye,      Dressed in gown, bands, and wig, was defending a pig           On the charge of deserting its sty.       The Witnesses proved, without error or flaw,           That the sty was deserted when found:      And the Judge kept explaining the state of the law           In a soft under-current of sound.       The indictment had never been clearly expressed,           And it seemed that the Snark had begun,      And had spoken three hours, before any one guessed           What the pig was supposed to have done.       The Jury had each formed a different view           (Long before the indictment was read),      And they all spoke at once, so that none of them knew           One word that the others had said.       “You must know--” said the Judge: but the Snark exclaimed “Fudge!”            That statute is obsolete quite!      Let me tell you, my friends, the whole question depends           On an ancient manorial right.       “In the matter of Treason the pig would appear           To have aided, but scarcely abetted:      While the charge of Insolvency fails, it is clear,           If you grant the plea ‘never indebted.’       “The fact of Desertion I will not dispute;           But its guilt, as I trust, is removed      (So far as related to the costs of this suit)           By the Alibi which has been proved.       “My poor client’s fate now depends on your votes.”            Here the speaker sat down in his place,      And directed the Judge to refer to his notes           And briefly to sum up the case.       But the Judge said he never had summed up before;           So the Snark undertook it instead,      And summed it so well that it came to far more           Than the Witnesses ever had said!       When the verdict was called for, the Jury declined,           As the word was so puzzling to spell;      But they ventured to hope that the Snark wouldn’t mind           Undertaking that duty as well.       So the Snark found the verdict, although, as it owned,           It was spent with the toils of the day:      When it said the word “GUILTY!” the Jury all groaned,           And some of them fainted away.       Then the Snark pronounced sentence, the Judge being quite           Too nervous to utter a word:      When it rose to its feet, there was silence like night,           And the fall of a pin might be heard.       “Transportation for life” was the sentence it gave,           “And _then_ to be fined forty pound.”       The Jury all cheered, though the Judge said he feared           That the phrase was not legally sound.       But their wild exultation was suddenly checked           When the jailer informed them, with tears,      Such a sentence would have not the slightest effect,           As the pig had been dead for some years.       The Judge left the Court, looking deeply disgusted:           But the Snark, though a little aghast,      As the lawyer to whom the defense was entrusted,           Went bellowing on to the last.       Thus the Barrister dreamed, while the bellowing seemed           To grow every moment more clear:      Till he woke to the knell of a furious bell,           Which the Bellman rang close at his ear.                         Fit the Seventh                      THE BANKER’S FATE        They sought it with thimbles, they sought it with care;           They pursued it with forks and hope;      They threatened its life with a railway-share;           They charmed it with smiles and soap.

It might amuse a friend or an enemy to read how I gradually learnt from the truth of some stray legend or from the falsehood of some dominant philosophy, things that I might have learnt from my catechism--if I had ever learnt it. There may or may not be some entertainment in reading how I found at last in an anarchist club or a Babylonian temple what I might have found in the nearest parish church.  If any one is entertained by learning how the flowers of the field or the phrases in an omnibus, the accidents of politics or the pains of youth came together in a certain order to produce a certain conviction of Christian orthodoxy, he may possibly read this book. But there is in everything a reasonable division of labour. I have written the book, and nothing on earth would induce me to read it.       I add one purely pedantic note which comes, as a note naturally should, at the beginning of the book.  These essays are concerned only to discuss the actual fact that the central Christian theology (sufficiently summarized in the Apostles' Creed) is the best root of energy and sound ethics.  They are not intended to discuss the very fascinating but quite different question of what is the present seat of authority for the proclamation of that creed.  When the word \"orthodoxy\" is used here it means the Apostles' Creed, as understood by everybody calling himself Christian until a very short time ago and the general historic conduct of those who held such a creed.  I have been forced by mere space to confine myself to what I have got from this creed; I do not touch the matter much disputed among modern Christians, of where we ourselves got it.  This is not an ecclesiastical treatise but a sort of slovenly autobiography.  But if any one wants my opinions about the actual nature of the authority, Mr. G.S.Street has only to throw me another challenge, and I will write him another book.    II THE MANIAC        Thoroughly worldly people never understand even the world; they rely altogether on a few cynical maxims which are not true. Once I remember walking with a prosperous publisher, who made a remark which I had often heard before; it is, indeed, almost a motto of the modern world.  Yet I had heard it once too often, and I saw suddenly that there was nothing in it.  The publisher said of somebody, \"That man will get on; he believes in himself.\" And I remember that as I lifted my head to listen, my eye caught an omnibus on which was written \"Hanwell.\"  I said to him, \"Shall I tell you where the men are who believe most in themselves? For I can tell you.  I know of men who believe in themselves more colossally than Napoleon or Caesar.  I know where flames the fixed star of certainty and success.  I can guide you to the thrones of the Super-men. The men who really believe in themselves are all in lunatic asylums.\"  He said mildly that there were a good many men after all who believed in themselves and who were not in lunatic asylums. \"Yes, there are,\" I retorted, \"and you of all men ought to know them. That drunken poet from whom you would not take a dreary tragedy, he believed in himself.  That elderly minister with an epic from whom you were hiding in a back room, he believed in himself. If you consulted your business experience instead of your ugly individualistic philosophy, you would know that believing in himself is one of the commonest signs of a rotter.  Actors who can't act believe in themselves; and debtors who won't pay.  It would be much truer to say that a man will certainly fail, because he believes in himself.  Complete self-confidence is not merely a sin; complete self-confidence is a weakness.  Believing utterly in one's self is a hysterical and superstitious belief like believing in Joanna Southcote:  the man who has it has `Hanwell' written on his face as plain as it is written on that omnibus.\"  And to all this my friend the publisher made this very deep and effective reply, \"Well, if a man is not to believe in himself, in what is he to believe?\" After a long pause I replied, \"I will go home and write a book in answer to that question.\"  This is the book that I have written in answer to it.       But I think this book may well start where our argument started-- in the neighbourhood of the mad-house. Modern masters of science are much impressed with the need of beginning all inquiry with a fact. The ancient masters of religion were quite equally impressed with that necessity.  They began with the fact of sin--a fact as practical as potatoes.  Whether or no man could be washed in miraculous waters, there was no doubt at any rate that he wanted washing. But certain religious leaders in London, not mere materialists, have begun in our day not to deny the highly disputable water, but to deny the indisputable dirt.  Certain new theologians dispute original sin, which is the only part of Christian theology which can really be proved.  Some followers of the Reverend R.J.Campbell, in their almost too fastidious spirituality, admit divine sinlessness, which they cannot see even in their dreams.  But they essentially deny human sin, which they can see in the street.  The strongest saints and the strongest sceptics alike took positive evil as the starting-point of their argument.  If it be true (as it certainly is) that a man can feel exquisite happiness in skinning a cat, then the religious philosopher can only draw one of two deductions. He must either deny the existence of God, as all atheists do; or he must deny the present union between God and man, as all Christians do. The new theologians seem to think it a highly rationalistic solution to deny the cat.       In this remarkable situation it is plainly not now possible (with any hope of a universal appeal) to start, as our fathers did, with the fact of sin.  This very fact which was to them (and is to me) as plain as a pikestaff, is the very fact that has been specially diluted or denied.  But though moderns deny the existence of sin, I do not think that they have yet denied the existence of a lunatic asylum.  We all agree still that there is a collapse of the intellect as unmistakable as a falling house.  Men deny hell, but not, as yet, Hanwell.  For the purpose of our primary argument the one may very well stand where the other stood.  I mean that as all thoughts and theories were once judged by whether they tended to make a man lose his soul, so for our present purpose all modern thoughts and theories may be judged by whether they tend to make a man lose his wits.       It is true that some speak lightly and loosely of insanity as in itself attractive.  But a moment's thought will show that if disease is beautiful, it is generally some one else's disease. A blind man may be picturesque; but it requires two eyes to see the picture.  And similarly even the wildest poetry of insanity can only be enjoyed by the sane.  To the insane man his insanity is quite prosaic, because it is quite true.  A man who thinks himself a chicken is to himself as ordinary as a chicken.  A man who thinks he is a bit of glass is to himself as dull as a bit of glass. It is the homogeneity of his mind which makes him dull, and which makes him mad.  It is only because we see the irony of his idea that we think him even amusing; it is only because he does not see the irony of his idea that he is put in Hanwell at all.  In short, oddities only strike ordinary people.  Oddities do not strike odd people.  This is why ordinary people have a much more exciting time; while odd people are always complaining of the dulness of life. This is also why the new novels die so quickly, and why the old fairy tales endure for ever.  The old fairy tale makes the hero a normal human boy; it is his adventures that are startling; they startle him because he is normal.  But in the modern psychological novel the hero is abnormal; the centre is not central. Hence the fiercest adventures fail to affect him adequately, and the book is monotonous.  You can make a story out of a hero among dragons; but not out of a dragon among dragons.  The fairy tale discusses what a sane man will do in a mad world.  The sober realistic novel of to-day discusses what an essential lunatic will do in a dull world.       Let us begin, then, with the mad-house; from this evil and fantastic inn let us set forth on our intellectual journey.  Now, if we are to glance at the philosophy of sanity, the first thing to do in the matter is to blot out one big and common mistake.  There is a notion adrift everywhere that imagination, especially mystical imagination, is dangerous to man's mental balance.  Poets are commonly spoken of as psychologically unreliable; and generally there is a vague association between wreathing laurels in your hair and sticking straws in it. Facts and history utterly contradict this view.  Most of the very great poets have been not only sane, but extremely business-like; and if Shakespeare ever really held horses, it was because he was much the safest man to hold them.  Imagination does not breed insanity. Exactly what does breed insanity is reason.  Poets do not go mad; but chess-players do.  Mathematicians go mad, and cashiers; but creative artists very seldom.  I am not, as will be seen, in any sense attacking logic:  I only say that this danger does lie in logic, not in imagination.  Artistic paternity is as wholesome as physical paternity.  Moreover, it is worthy of remark that when a poet really was morbid it was commonly because he had some weak spot of rationality on his brain.  Poe, for instance, really was morbid; not because he was poetical, but because he was specially analytical.  Even chess was too poetical for him; he disliked chess because it was full of knights and castles, like a poem.  He avowedly preferred the black discs of draughts, because they were more like the mere black dots on a diagram. Perhaps the strongest case of all is this:  that only one great English poet"]]]
