The general opinion as to the hopelessness of my trying to get nearer than thirty miles to the front had so communicated itself to me that had I been turned back there on the quay at Folkstone, I would have been angry, but hardly surprised.  Not until the boat was out in the channel did I feel sure that I was to achieve even this first leg of the journey.  Even then, all was not well. With Folkstone and the war office well behind, my mind turned to submarines as a sunflower to the sun. Afterward I found that the thing to do is not to think about submarines. To think of politics, or shampoos, or of people one does not like, but not of submarines. They are like ghosts in that respect. They are perfectly safe and entirely innocuous as long as one thinks of something else.  And something went wrong almost immediately.  It was imperative that I get to Calais. And the boat, which had intended making Calais, had had a report of submarines and headed for Boulogne. This in itself was upsetting. To have, as one may say, one's teeth set for Calais, and find one is biting on Boulogne, is not agreeable. I did not want Boulogne. My pass was from Calais. I had visions of waiting in Boulogne, of growing old and grey waiting, or of trying to walk to Calais and being turned back, of being locked in a cow stable and bedded down on straw. For fear of rousing hopes that must inevitably be disappointed, again nothing happened.  There were no other women on board: only British officers and the turbaned and imposing Indians. The day was bright, exceedingly cold. The boat went at top speed, her lifeboats slung over the sides and ready for lowering. There were lookouts posted everywhere. I did not think they attended to their business. Every now and then one lifted his head and looked at the sky or at the passengers. I felt that I should report him. What business had he to look away from the sea? I went out to the bow and watched for periscopes. There were black things floating about. I decided that they were not periscopes, but mines. We went very close to them. They proved to be buoys marking the Channel.  I hated to take my eyes off the sea, even for a moment. If you have ever been driven at sixty miles an hour over a bad road, and felt that if you looked away the car would go into the ditch, and if you will multiply that by the exact number of German submarines and then add the British Army, you will know how I felt.  Afterward I grew accustomed to the Channel crossing. I made it four times. It was necessary for me to cross twice after the eighteenth of February, when the blockade began. On board the fated Arabic, later sunk by a German submarine, I ran the blockade again to return to America. It was never an enjoyable thing to brave submarine attack, but one develops a sort of philosophy. It is the same with being under fire. The first shell makes you jump. The second you speak of, commenting with elaborate carelessness on where it fell. This is a gain over shell number one, when you cannot speak to save your life. The third shell you ignore, and the fourth you forget about--if you can.  Seeing me alone the captain asked me to the canvas shelter of the bridge. I proceeded to voice my protest at our change of destination. He apologised, but we continued to Boulogne.  \"What does a periscope look like?\" I asked. \"I mean, of course, from this boat?\"  \"Depends on how much of it is showing. Sometimes it's only about the size of one of those gulls. It's hard to tell the difference.\"  I rather suspect that captain now. There were many gulls sitting on the water. I had been looking for something like a hitching post sticking up out of the water. Now my last vestige of pleasure and confidence was gone. I went almost mad trying to watch all the gulls at once.  \"What will you do if you see a submarine?'  \"Run it down,\" said the captain calmly. \"That's the only chance we've got. That is, if we see the boat itself. These little Channel steamers make about twenty-six knots, and the submarine, submerged, only about half of that. Sixteen is the best they can do on the surface. Run them down and sink them, that's my motto.\"  \"What about a torpedo?\"  \"We can see them coming. It will be hard to torpedo this boat--she goes too fast.\"  Then and there he explained to me the snowy wake of the torpedo, a white path across the water; the mechanism by which it is kept true to its course; the detonator that explodes it. From nervousness I shifted to enthusiasm. I wanted to see the white wake. I wanted to see the Channel boat dodge it. My sporting blood was up. I was willing to take a chance. I felt that if there was a difficulty this man would escape it. I turned and looked back at the khaki-coloured figures on the deck below.  Taking a chance! They were all taking a chance. And there was one, an officer, with an empty right sleeve. And suddenly what for an enthusiastic moment, in that bracing sea air, had seemed a game, became the thing that it is, not a game, but a deadly and cruel war. I never grew accustomed to the tragedy of the empty sleeve. And as if to accentuate this thing toward which I was moving so swiftly, the British Red Cross ship, from Boulogne to Folkstone, came in sight, hurrying over with her wounded, a great white boat, garnering daily her harvest of wounded and taking them \"home.\"  Land now--a grey-white line that is the sand dunes at Ambleteuse, north of Boulogne. I knew Ambleteuse. It gave a sense of strangeness to see the old tower at the water's edge loom up out of the sea. The sight of land was comforting, but vigilance was not relaxed. The attacks of submarines have been mostly made not far outside the harbours, and only a few days later that very boat was to make a sensational escape just outside the harbour of Boulogne.  All at once it was twilight, the swift dusk of the sea. The boat warped in slowly. I showed my passport, and at last I was on French soil. North and east, beyond the horizon, lay the thing I had come to see.     CHAPTER II  \"SOMEWHERE IN FRANCE\"   Many people have seen Boulogne and have written of what they have seen: the great hotels that are now English hospitals; the crowding of transport wagons; the French signs, which now have English signs added to them; the mixture of uniforms--English khaki and French blue; the white steamer waiting at the quay, with great Red Crosses on her snowy funnels. Over everything, that first winter of the war, hung the damp chill of the Continental winter, that chill that sinks in and never leaves, that penetrates fur and wool and eats into the spirit like an acid.  I got through the customs without much difficulty. I had a large package of cigarettes for the soldiers, for given his choice, food or a smoke, the soldier will choose the latter. At last after much talk I got them in free of duty. And then I was footfree.  Here again I realise that I should have encountered great difficulties. I should at least have had to walk to Calais, or to have slept, as did one titled Englishwoman I know, in a bathtub. I did neither. I took a first-class ticket to Calais, and waited round the station until a train should go.  And then I happened on one of the pictures that will stand out always in my mind. Perhaps it was because I was not yet inured to suffering; certainly I was to see many similar scenes, much more of the flotsam and jetsam of the human tide that was sweeping back and forward over the flat fields of France and Flanders.  A hospital train had come in, a British train. The twilight had deepened into night. Under the flickering arc lamps, in that cold and dismal place, the train came to a quiet stop. Almost immediately it began to unload. A door opened and a British nurse alighted. Then slowly and painfully a man in a sitting position slid forward, pushing himself with his hands, his two bandaged feet held in the air. He sat at the edge of the doorway and lowered his feet carefully until they hung free.  \"Frozen feet from the trenches,\" said a man standing beside me.  The first man was lifted down and placed on a truck, and his place was filled immediately by another. As fast as one man was taken another came. The line seemed endless. One and all, their faces expressed keen apprehension, lest some chance awkwardness should touch or jar the tortured feet. Ten at a time they were wheeled away. And still they came and came, until perhaps two hundred had been taken off. But now something else was happening. Another car of badly wounded was being unloaded. Through the windows could be seen the iron framework on which the stretchers, three in a tier, were swung.  Halfway down the car a wide window was opened, and two tall lieutenants, with four orderlies, took their places outside. It was very silent. Orders were given in low tones. The muffled rumble of the trucks carrying the soldiers with frozen feet was all that broke the quiet, and soon they, too, were gone; and there remained only the six men outside, receiving with hands as gentle as those of women the stretchers so cautiously worked over the window sill to them. One by one the stretchers came; one by one they were added to the lengthening line that lay prone on the stone flooring beside the train. There was not a jar, not an unnecessary motion. One great officer, very young, took the weight of the end as it came toward him, and lowered it with marvellous gentleness as the others took hold. He had a trick of the wrist that enabled him to reach up, take hold and lower the stretcher, without freeing his hands. He was marvellously strong, marvellously tender.  The stretchers were laid out side by side. Their occupants did not speak or move. It was as if they had reached their limit of endurance. They lay with closed eyes, or with impassive, upturned faces, swathed in their brown blankets against the chill.

What shines, is born but for the moment's pleasure; The genuine leaves posterity a treasure.  _Merry Person_. Posterity! I'm sick of hearing of it; Supposing I the future age would profit, Who then would furnish ours with fun? For it must have it, ripe and mellow; The presence of a fine young fellow, Is cheering, too, methinks, to any one. Whoso can pleasantly communicate, Will not make war with popular caprices, For, as the circle waxes great, The power his word shall wield increases. Come, then, and let us now a model see, Let Phantasy with all her various choir, Sense, reason, passion, sensibility, But, mark me, folly too! the scene inspire.  _Manager_. But the great point is action! Every one Comes as spectator, and the show's the fun. Let but the plot be spun off fast and thickly, So that the crowd shall gape in broad surprise, Then have you made a wide impression quickly, You are the man they'll idolize. The mass can only be impressed by masses; Then each at last picks out his proper part. Give much, and then to each one something passes, And each one leaves the house with happy heart. Have you a piece, give it at once in pieces! Such a ragout your fame increases; It costs as little pains to play as to invent. But what is gained, if you a whole present? Your public picks it presently to pieces.  _Poet_. You do not feel how mean a trade like that must be! In the true Artist's eyes how false and hollow! Our genteel botchers, well I see, Have given the maxims that you follow.  _Manager_. Such charges pass me like the idle wind; A man who has right work in mind Must choose the instruments most fitting. Consider what soft wood you have for splitting, And keep in view for whom you write! If this one from _ennui_ seeks flight, That other comes full from the groaning table, Or, the worst case of all to cite, From reading journals is for thought unable. Vacant and giddy, all agog for wonder, As to a masquerade they wing their way; The ladies give themselves and all their precious plunder And without wages help us play. On your poetic heights what dream comes o'er you? What glads a crowded house? Behold Your patrons in array before you! One half are raw, the other cold. One, after this play, hopes to play at cards, One a wild night to spend beside his doxy chooses, Poor fools, why court ye the regards, For such a set, of the chaste muses? I tell you, give them more and ever more and more, And then your mark you'll hardly stray from ever; To mystify be your endeavor, To satisfy is labor sore.... What ails you? Are you pleased or pained? What notion----  _Poet_. Go to, and find thyself another slave! What! and the lofty birthright Nature gave, The noblest talent Heaven to man has lent, Thou bid'st the Poet fling to folly's ocean! How does he stir each deep emotion? How does he conquer every element? But by the tide of song that from his bosom springs, And draws into his heart all living things? When Nature's hand, in endless iteration, The thread across the whizzing spindle flings, When the complex, monotonous creation Jangles with all its million strings: Who, then, the long, dull series animating, Breaks into rhythmic march the soulless round? And, to the law of All each member consecrating, Bids one majestic harmony resound? Who bids the tempest rage with passion's power? The earnest soul with evening-redness glow? Who scatters vernal bud and summer flower Along the path where loved ones go? Who weaves each green leaf in the wind that trembles To form the wreath that merit's brow shall crown? Who makes Olympus fast? the gods assembles? The power of manhood in the Poet shown.  _Merry Person_. Come, then, put forth these noble powers, And, Poet, let thy path of flowers Follow a love-adventure's winding ways. One comes and sees by chance, one burns, one stays, And feels the gradual, sweet entangling! The pleasure grows, then comes a sudden jangling, Then rapture, then distress an arrow plants, And ere one dreams of it, lo! _there_ is a romance. Give us a drama in this fashion! Plunge into human life's full sea of passion! Each lives it, few its meaning ever guessed, Touch where you will, 'tis full of interest. Bright shadows fleeting o'er a mirror, A spark of truth and clouds of error, By means like these a drink is brewed To cheer and edify the multitude. The fairest flower of the youth sit listening Before your play, and wait the revelation; Each melancholy heart, with soft eyes glistening, Draws sad, sweet nourishment from your creation; This passion now, now that is stirred, by turns, And each one sees what in his bosom burns. Open alike, as yet, to weeping and to laughter, They still admire the flights, they still enjoy the show; Him who is formed, can nothing suit thereafter; The yet unformed with thanks will ever glow.  _Poet_. Ay, give me back the joyous hours, When I myself was ripening, too, When song, the fount, flung up its showers Of beauty ever fresh and new. When a soft haze the world was veiling, Each bud a miracle bespoke, And from their stems a thousand flowers I broke, Their fragrance through the vales exhaling. I nothing and yet all possessed, Yearning for truth and in illusion blest. Give me the freedom of that hour, The tear of joy, the pleasing pain, Of hate and love the thrilling power, Oh, give me back my youth again!  _Merry Person_. Youth, my good friend, thou needest certainly When ambushed foes are on thee springing, When loveliest maidens witchingly Their white arms round thy neck are flinging, When the far garland meets thy glance, High on the race-ground's goal suspended, When after many a mazy dance In drink and song the night is ended. But with a free and graceful soul To strike the old familiar lyre, And to a self-appointed goal Sweep lightly o'er the trembling wire, There lies, old gentlemen, to-day Your task; fear not, no vulgar error blinds us. Age does not make us childish, as they say, But we are still true children when it finds us.  _Manager_. Come, words enough you two have bandied, Now let us see some deeds at last; While you toss compliments full-handed, The time for useful work flies fast. Why talk of being in the humor? Who hesitates will never be. If you are poets (so says rumor) Now then command your poetry. You know full well our need and pleasure, We want strong drink in brimming measure; Brew at it now without delay! To-morrow will not do what is not done to-day. Let not a day be lost in dallying, But seize the possibility Right by the forelock, courage rallying, And forth with fearless spirit sallying,-- Once in the yoke and you are free.   Upon our German boards, you know it, What any one would try, he may; Then stint me not, I beg, to-day, In scenery or machinery, Poet. With great and lesser heavenly lights make free, Spend starlight just as you desire; No want of water, rocks or fire Or birds or beasts to you shall be. So, in this narrow wooden house's bound, Stride through the whole creation's round, And with considerate swiftness wander From heaven, through this world, to the world down yonder.         PROLOGUE       IN HEAVEN.   [THE LORD. THE HEAVENLY HOSTS _afterward_ MEPHISTOPHELES. _The three archangels_, RAPHAEL, GABRIEL, _and_ MICHAEL, _come forward_.]  _Raphael_. The sun, in ancient wise, is sounding,   With brother-spheres, in rival song; And, his appointed journey rounding,   With thunderous movement rolls along. His look, new strength to angels lending,   No creature fathom can for aye; The lofty works, past comprehending,   Stand lordly, as on time's first day.  _Gabriel_. And swift, with wondrous swiftness fleeting,   The pomp of earth turns round and round, The glow of Eden alternating   With shuddering midnight's gloom profound; Up o'er the rocks the foaming ocean   Heaves from its old, primeval bed, And rocks and seas, with endless motion,   On in the spheral sweep are sped.  _Michael_. And tempests roar, glad warfare waging,   From sea to land, from land to sea, And bind round all, amidst their raging,   A chain of giant energy. There, lurid desolation, blazing,   Foreruns the volleyed thunder's way: Yet, Lord, thy messengers[2] are praising   The mild procession of thy day.  _All Three_. The sight new strength to angels lendeth,   For none thy being fathom may, The works, no angel comprehendeth,   Stand lordly as on time's first day.  _Mephistopheles_. Since, Lord, thou drawest near us once again, And how we do, dost graciously inquire, And to be pleased to see me once didst deign, I too among thy household venture nigher. Pardon, high words I cannot labor after, Though the whole court should look on me with scorn; My pathos certainly would stir thy laughter, Hadst thou not laughter long since quite forsworn. Of sun and worlds I've nought to tell worth mention, How men torment themselves takes my attention. The little God o' the world jogs on the same old way And is as singular as on the world's first day. A pity 'tis thou shouldst have given The fool, to make him worse, a gleam of light from heaven; He calls it reason, using it To be more beast than ever beast was yet. He seems to me, (your grace the word will pardon,) Like a long-legg'd grasshopper in the garden, Forever on the wing, and hops and sings The same old song, as in the grass he springs; Would he but stay there! no; he needs must muddle His prying nose in every puddle.  _The Lord_. Hast nothing for our edification? Still thy old work of accusation? Will things on earth be never right for thee?  _Mephistopheles_. No, Lord! I find them still as bad as bad can be. Poor souls! their miseries seem so much to please 'em, I scarce can find it in my heart to tease 'em.  _The Lord_. Knowest thou Faust?  _Mephistopheles_. The Doctor?  _The Lord_. Ay, my servant!  _Mephistopheles_.        He! Forsooth! he serves you in a famous fashion; No earthly meat or drink can feed his passion; Its grasping greed no space can measure; Half-co"]]]
