Below is a table giving general dimensions, in inches, of the several parts of a bridge of this description.    Span.  Bolsters.  Stringers.   Ties.   Braces.   Diameter of Bolts.      4     12 x 12    10 x 12     6 x 8    2 x 8         1 inch.    10     12 x 12    12 x 13     6 x 8    2 x 8         1  \"    16     14 x 14    12 x 18     6 x 8    2 x 8         1  \"    20     14 x 14    12 x 22     6 x 8    2 x 8         1  \"   Each bolt must have a washer under the head, and also under the nut. For a span of from 15 to 30 feet, we can use the combination shown in Plate II, Fig. 3. The piece A F must have the same dimensions as a simple string piece of a length A B--so that it may not yield between B and either of the points A or D. The two braces D F and E F must be stiff enough to support the load coming upon them. Suppose the weight on a pair of drivers of a Locomotive to be 10 tons, then each side must bear 5 tons, and each brace 2-1/2 tons = 2-1/2 x 2240 = 5600 lbs. Now, to allow for sudden or extra strains, call 8000 lbs. the strain to be supported by each brace, and, accordingly, 8 square inches of sectional area would be sufficient for compression only; but, as the brace is inclined, the strain is increased. Let the vertical distance from A to D be 10 ft., and, calling the span 30 ft.--A B will be 15 ft.--from whence D F must be 18 ft., then we shall have the proportion    10 : 18 :: 8000 : 14400 lbs.  which would require an area of about 15 square inches of section to resist compression, or a piece 3x5 inches. Now, as this stick is more than 6 or 8 diameters in length, it will yield by bending--and consequently its area must be increased. The load, which a piece of wood acting as a post or strut will safely sustain, is found by the formula already given.        2240 bd³   W = --------          L²  [TeX: $W = \\frac{2240 bd^3}{L^2}$]  Now substituting 3 for b, and 5 for d, we have        2240 x 3 x 125   840000   W = -------------- = ------ = 2592 lbs.            324           324  [TeX: $W=\\frac{2240 \\times 3 \\times 125}{324}=\\frac{840000}{324}=2592$]  which is not enough. Using 6 for b and 8 for d, we have        2240 x 6 x 512   W = -------------- = 21238 lbs.             324  [TeX: $W = \\frac{2240 \\times 6 \\times 512}{324} = 21238$]  which is something larger than is actually required, but it is no harm to have an excess of strength. Now in many cases this arrangement would be objectionable, as not affording sufficient head room on account of the braces--and we can as well use the form of structure given in Pl. I. Fig. 3, since it is evidently immaterial whether the point B be supported on F or suspended from it, provided we can prevent motion in the feet of the braces, which is done by notching them into the stringer at that point. This of course creates a tensional strain along the stringer, which is found as follows:--Representing the applied weight by F B, Pl. II, Fig. 2, draw B D parallel to F C, also D H parallel to A C--D H is the tension. This is the graphical construction, and is near enough for practice. Geometrically we have the two similar triangles A F B and D F H, whence    A F : D F :: A B : D H              D F x A B   and D H = ---------                A F  [TeX: $DH = \\frac{DF \\times AB}{AF}$]  This style of structure may be used up to 50 feet, but it is not employed for spans exceeding 30 feet in length. It is very customary to make the braces in pairs so as to use smaller scantling, and gain in lateral stiffness--the two pieces forming one brace by being properly blocked and bolted together. Below is given a table of dimensions for the various parts of this style of structure:    Span.    Rise.    Bolster.    Stringer.     Braces.     Rod.                                                          No. Size.     15        6      12 x 12     12 x 12       2--5 x 6    1-1/8    20        7      14 x 14     12 x 13       2--5 x 8    1-3/8    25        8      14 x 14     12 x 15       2--6 x 8    1-1/2    30       10      14 x 14     12 x 18       2--6 x 9    1-5/8  Single Beams under each rail firmly braced laterally, and trussed by an iron rod, (or preferably by two iron rods,) and a post on the under side of the beam. The deflection of the rod is usually taken at 1\\8 of the span. Pl. II., Fig. 1, represents this style of trussing a beam--which is generally used for spans of from 15 to 30 ft. Below is a table of dimensions for this truss with single and double rods; if double rods are used only half the given section will be necessary for each one of the pair.    Span.     Rise.      Stringer.    Post.      Rod.           Rods.   Feet.    In Feet.                          (single.)      (double.)     15       1-7/8      12 x 12      6 x 8    2-1/8 diam. or 1-1/2 diam.    20       2-1/2      12 x 14      7 x 8    2-1/2   \"      1-3/4   \"    25       3-1/8      12 x 16      8 x 8    2-3/4   \"      2       \"    30       3-3/4      13 x 18      9 x 9    3       \"      2-1/8   \"  It is as well to tenon the post into the beam, and also strap it firmly with iron plates--and the end should be shod with iron to form a saddle for the rods to bear upon.  Now if we should make a bridge, on the plan of Fig. 3, Pl. I., 75 or 100 feet, or perhaps more, in length, the braces A F and F C, would not only be very long but very large and heavy, and one chief requisite in a good bridge is, to have all the beams so proportioned that they will resist all the strains acting upon them, without being unnecessarily large. It now becomes necessary to have a different arrangement of the parts of the truss in order to obtain increased length of span.  Suppose we have a span, of 40 feet, as represented in Fig 2, Pl. I. Now instead of running the braces from A C until they meet in a point, as before we stop them at a, and c, and place the straining beam, a c, between them to prevent those points from approaching, suspend the points B and D from them, and start the braces B b and D b--and, if the truss were longer, would continue on in the same manner as far as needful. To prevent the. truss from altering its form, as shown by the dotted lines A' b C', and A E C, by any passing load, we insert the counter braces marked R.  The braces A a and C c, must support all of the weight of the bridge and its load within the parallelogram B a c D--and the next set of braces, B b and D b, sustain that part of the load which comes over the centre of the bridge. Consequently the braces must increase in size from the centre towards the abutments. The rods resist the same pressure in amount as their braces--but being vertical, do not need the increase, given to the braces on account of their inclination--but increase simply with the strain upon them, from the centre to the ends of the truss.  There are many forms of small bridges differing from those enumerated, in various minor details, but sufficient has been said to give the reader a fair idea of the strains upon the different parts, and how to arrange and proportion the materials to resist them.     PRACTICAL RULES AND EXAMPLES IN WOODEN BRIDGE BUILDING.   In any case that may arise, we must determine approximately the gross weight of the bridge and its load--as a basis, and then we can proceed as follows--in case of a Howe, Pratt, or Arch Brace Truss.   =To find the dimensions of the Lower Chord.=  The tension at the centre of the Lower Chord is found by _dividing the_ _product of the weight of the whole bridge and load by the span_, by sight times the height--or letting T=tension in lbs., W=weight of bridge and load in lbs., S=span in feet, and h=rise or height--we have        W x S   T = ----- --.        8 h  [TeX: $T = \\frac{W \\times S}{8 h}$]  In this case we have taken the rise at 1/8 of the span, which is evidently the best ratio between those dimensions, as it equalizes the vertical and horizontal forces. As to the proportions of the _bays_ or _panels_, (or that portion of the truss bounded by two adjacent verticals, as struts or ties, and the chords,) the ratio of the rise (or the vertical distance between the centre lines of the two chords,) and the length on the chord should be such, that the diagonal truss members may make an angle of about 50° with the chords; as the size of the timbers is increased by decreasing the angle, and, if the angle is increased, there are more timbers required.  Mr. G.L. Vose, in his admirable work on R.R. Construction, observes very truly that \"The braces, at the end of a long span, may be nearer the vertical than those near the centre, as they have more work to do. If the end panel be made twice as high as long, and the centre panel square, the intermediates varying as their distance from the end, a good architectural effect is produced.\"  Now it is necessary for us to have some data from which to determine the approximate weight of the bridge, and also its load. These can be found by comparing weights of bridges in common use, as obtained from reports. In a small bridge of short span, the weight of the structure itself may be entirely neglected, because of. the very small proportion the strains caused by it bear to those due to the load;--but, in long spans, the weight becomes a very important element in the calculations for strength and safety--inasmuch as it may exceed the weight of the load.  In all Bridges of 120 ft. span, about 1/3 of a ton, per foot run, will be the weight of each truss for a single track, including floor timbers--transverse bracing, &c. If the bridge were loaded with Locomotives only, the greatest load would be, on the whole bridge--160 tons = 1.33 tons per ft. run of the bridge or .666 tons per ft. run of each truss. Now if we make the rise of the bridge 15 ft., and divide the span into 12 panels of 10 ft. each, we shall have for total weight of bridge and load 240 tons, or for a single truss 10 tons to each panel.   =Lower Chords.= Now to find the tension on the Lower Chords,        W x S   T = ---"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14874"],["title","Elsie's Womanhood (#1)"],["body","far from looking old, I think. I have grown so sick of your silly, brainless fops, who expect women neither to talk sense nor understand it.\"  \"Ah, I dare say! and Mr. Travilla is the most sensible and polished of men--always excepting my own spouse, of course. And you won't be taken away from us; so I give my consent.\"  Elsie's only answer was a mirthful, amused look.  \"Oh, but I am glad to see you back!\" Carrie ran on. \"It seems an age since you went away.\"  \"Thank you. And your husband? what is he like?\"  \"I was never good at description, but he is a fine specimen of a Kentucky planter, and very fond of his wife. By the way, you must blame me that Edward and Lora were so late in welcoming you home. I arrived only yesterday morning, quite fatigued with my journey, and begged them to wait till to-day, and bring me with them.\"  \"That was right. We have not seen Enna yet, or Arthur. Grandpa and Mrs. Dinsmore and Walter called yesterday. But there is the dinner-bell. Let me conduct you to the dining-room.\"  They were just in time to sit down with the others.  Elsie quickly perceived by her Aunt Lora's look and manner, that she, too, had heard the news, but no remark was make on the subject till the ladies had retired to the drawing-room, leaving the gentlemen to the enjoyment of their after-dinner cigars.  Then Mrs. Howard, facing round upon her niece as they entered the room, exclaimed, \"Elsie, you naughty child! are you not ashamed of yourself?\"  \"On account of what, auntie?\"  \"Such unconscious innocence!\" cried Lora, throwing up the white and jeweled hands she had rested lightly for an instant upon the young girl's shoulder, while gazing steadily into the smiling, blushing, sparkling face. \"You haven't been planning and promising to give Adelaide and me a nephew older than ourselves? I tell you, miss, I refuse my consent. Why, it's absurd! the very idea! I used to think him almost an elderly gentleman when you were a chit of eight or nine.\"  \"I remember having had some such idea myself; but he must have been growing young since then,\" returned Elsie, demurely.  \"He seems to have been standing still (waiting for you, I suppose); but I never was more astonished in my life!\" said Lora, dropping into a chair.  \"It has been a genuine surprise to us all,\" remarked Rose.  \"To me as much as anyone, mamma,\" said Elsie. \"I--had thought he was engaged to you, Aunt Adie.\"  \"To _me_, child!\"  \"Why, my dear, I surely told you about her engagement to my brother Edward?\" exclaimed Adelaide and Rose simultaneously.  \"You tried, mamma, and it was all my own fault that I did not hear the whole truth. And, Aunt Adie, I cannot understand how he could ever fancy me, while he might have hoped there was a possibility of winning you.\"  \"'Twould have been a much more suitable match,\" said Lora. \"Though I'd have preferred the one in contemplation, except that in the other case, she would not be carried quite away from us. But suppose we proceed to business. We should have a double wedding, I think.\"  \"Oh, don't talk of it yet,\" said Rose, with a slight tremble in her voice, and looking at Elsie's flushed, conscious face with eyes full of unshed tears. \"Adelaide's is to be within the next two months, and--we cannot give up Elsie so suddenly.\"  \"Of course not,\" said Adelaide; \"and I should have serious objections to being used as a foil to Elsie's youth and beauty.\"  The Howards and Mr. Travilla stayed to tea, and shortly before that meal the party was increased by the arrival of Walter Dinsmore and Mrs. Dick Percival.  Enna had lost flesh and color; and long indulgence of a fretful, peevish temper had drawn down the corners of her mouth, lined her forehead, and left its ugly pencilings here and there over the once pretty face, so that it already began to look old and care-worn. She was very gayly dressed, in the height of the fashion, and rather overloaded with jewelry; but powder and rouge could not altogether conceal the ravages of discontent and passion. She was conscious of the fact, and inwardly dwelt with mortification and chagrin upon the contrast presented by her own faded face to that of Elsie, so fair and blooming, so almost childish in its sweet purity and innocence of expression.  \"So you are single yet,\" Enna said, with a covert sneer; \"and not likely to marry either, so far as I've been able to learn. They'll soon begin to call you an old maid.\"  \"Will they?\" said Mr. Dinsmore, with a laugh in which all present joined, Enna herself excepted; \"well, if she is a fair specimen of that much-abused class, they are far more attractive than is generally supposed.\"  \"You needn't laugh,\" said Enna; \"I was four years younger than she is now, when I married. I wasn't going to wait till they began to call me an old maid.\"  \"To bear that reproach is not the worst calamity that can befall a woman,\" replied Mr. Dinsmore gravely; then changed the subject by a kind inquiry in regard to Arthur.  \"Slowly and steadily improving,\" answered Walter. \"The doctors are now satisfied that he is not permanently crippled, though he still uses a crutch.\"     CHAPTER SECOND.      \"Mutual love, the crown of all our bliss.\"                      --MILTON'S PARADISE LOST.   After a half hour of waiting for her son's return, Mrs. Travilla sat down to her lonely cup of tea. There was no lack of delicacies on the table, and in all Edward's taste had been consulted. To make him comfortable and happy was, next to serving her God, the great aim and object of his mother's life; and, in a less degree, of that of every servant in the house. They had all been born and brought up at Ion, and had all these years known him as the kindest, most reasonable and considerate of masters.  \"Wish Massa Edard come. Dese waffles jes' prime to-night, an' he so fond ob dem,\" remarked a pretty mulatto girl, handing a plate of them to her mistress.  \"Yes, Prilla, he expected to be at home, but is probably taking tea at the Oaks or Roselands.\" And the old lady supped her tea and ate her waffles with a serene, happy face, now and then lighted up by a pleased smile which her attendant handmaiden was at a loss to interpret.  Having finished her meal, Mrs. Travilla threw a shawl about her shoulders and stepped out upon the veranda; then, tempted by the beauty of the night, walked down the avenue to meet her son or see if there were any signs of his approach.  She had not gone half the distance ere the sound of horses' hoofs reached her ear--distant at first but coming rapidly nearer, till a lady and gentleman drew rein at the gate, while the servant who had been riding in the rear dismounted and threw it open.  They came dashing up, but paused and drew rein again at sight of the old lady standing there under the trees.  \"Mother,\" cried her son, springing from the saddle, \"you were not alarmed? anxious? surely.\"  \"No, no, Edward, but glad to see you and Elsie! my dear child, this is very kind.\"  \"Not at all, dear Mrs. Travilla; it is so lovely an evening for a ride; or walk either,\" she added, giving her hand to her escort and springing lightly to the ground.  Mr. Travilla put the hand into that of his mother. \"Take her to your heart, mother; she is mine--ours!\" he said, in low tones tremulous with joy.  The old lady folded the slight girlish form to her breast for a moment, with a silence more eloquent than words.  \"Thank God! thank God!\" she murmured at length. \"He has given me my heart's desire;\" and mingled caresses and tears fell upon Elsie's face. \"For many years I have loved you as my own child, and now I am to have you. How bright our home will be, Edward. But we are darkening another. Her father; can he--has he----\"  \"He has given her to me,\" answered the son quickly, \"and she has--we have given ourselves to each other. Let me give an arm to each of you and we will go into the house.\"         *       *       *       *       *  The veranda at the Oaks was deserted, and the house very quiet, though lights still shone here and there, as Mr. Travilla and Elsie rode up and dismounted on their return from Ion.  A servant rose from the grass, where he had been lying at his ease; came forward and led away his young mistress's pony, while the lover bade her a tender good-night, sprang into the saddle again, and presently disappeared, lost to view amid the trees and the windings of the road, though the sound of horse's hoofs still came faintly to Elsie's ear as she stood intently listening, a sweet smile irradiating every feature.  Absorbed in her own thoughts, and in the effort to catch those fast-retreating sounds, she did not hear a step approaching from behind; but an arm encircled her waist, and a low-breathed \"My darling\" woke her from her reverie.  She looked up, her eyes beaming with affection; \"Papa; I am rather late, am I not?\"  \"Not very. Hark! the clock is but just striking ten. Come, let us sit down here for a little. We have hardly had a chat together to-day.\" He sighed slightly as he drew her closer to him.  \"No, papa dear, there has been so much company,\" she answered, laying her head on his shoulder. \"And----\"  \"And what?\" as she paused. \"Your father used to know all that concerned you one way or the other. Is he to be shut out from your confidence now? Ah, I think he must have been for some time past.\"  \"I could not tell you _that_, papa,\" she murmured, blushing visibly in the moonlight. \"Indeed, I hardly knew it myself till----\"  \"Till when?\"  \"The night of Sophie's wedding.\"  \"Ah!\" he said, musingly; \"but I cannot get over my surprise; he is your senior by so many years, and you have known him from childhood and looked upon him as a sort of uncle. I wonder at your choice.\"  \"But you don't object, papa?\"  \"No, if I must give you away--and I've always known that would come some time--I would rather it should be to him than any one else, for I can never doubt that he will be tender and true to my precious one, when she leaves her father's home for his.\"  \"Papa, papa,"]]]
