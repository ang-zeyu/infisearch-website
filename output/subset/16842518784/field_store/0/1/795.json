No one but a fool will deny the importance of knowing what the Native thinks before we legislate for him. It is in the hope of enlightening an otherwise barren controversy that we shall publish from time to time Mr. Plaatje's letters, commending them always to the more thoughtful and practical of our readers. -- `Pretoria News', September, 1910. ==  (The writer of this appreciation, the Editor of the Pretoria evening paper, was Reuter's war correspondent in the siege of Mafeking.)             (B)     Prologue    We have often read books, written by well-known scholars, who disavow, on behalf of their works, any claim to literary perfection. How much more necessary, then, that a South African native workingman, who has never received any secondary training, should in attempting authorship disclaim, on behalf of his work, any title to literary merit. Mine is but a sincere narrative of a melancholy situation, in which, with all its shortcomings, I have endeavoured to describe the difficulties of the South African Natives under a very strange law, so as most readily to be understood by the sympathetic reader.  The information contained in the following chapters is the result of personal observations made by the author in certain districts of the Transvaal, Orange \"Free\" State and the Province of the Cape of Good Hope. In pursuance of this private inquiry, I reached Lady Brand early in September, 1913, when, my financial resources being exhausted, I decided to drop the inquiry and return home.  But my friend, Mr. W. Z. Fenyang, of the farm Rietfontein, in the \"Free\" State, offered to convey me to the South of Moroka district, where I saw much of the trouble, and further, he paid my railway fare from Thaba Ncho back to Kimberley.  In the following November, it was felt that as Mr. Saul Msane, the organizer for the South African Native National Congress, was touring the eastern districts of the Transvaal, and Mr. Dube, the President, was touring the northern districts and Natal, and as the finances of the Congress did not permit an additional traveller, no information would be forthcoming in regard to the operation of the mischievous Act in the Cape Province.  So Mr. J. M. Nyokong, of the farm Maseru, offered to bear part of the expenses if I would undertake a visit to the Cape.  I must add that beyond spending six weeks on the tour to the Cape, the visit did not cost me much, for Mr. W. D. Soga, of King Williamstown, very generously supplemented Mr. Nyokong's offer and accompanied me on a part of the journey.  Besides the information received and the hospitality enjoyed from these and other friends, the author is indebted, for further information, to Mr. Attorney Msimang, of Johannesburg.  Mr. Msimang toured some of the Districts, compiled a list of some of the sufferers from the Natives' Land Act, and learnt the circumstances of their eviction. His list, however, is not full, its compilation having been undertaken in May, 1914, when the main exodus of the evicted tenants to the cities and Protectorates had already taken place, and when eyewitnesses of the evils of the Act had already fled the country. But it is useful in showing that the persecution is still continuing, for, according to this list, a good many families were evicted a year after the Act was enforced, and many more were at that time under notice to quit.  Mr. Msimang, modestly states in an explanatory note, that his pamphlet contains \"comparatively few instances of actual cases of hardship under the Natives' Land Act, 1913, to vindicate the leaders of the South African Native National Congress from the gross imputation, by the Native Affairs Department, that they make general allegations of hardships without producing any specific cases that can bear examination.\"  Mr. Msimang, who took a number of sworn statements from the sufferers, adds that \"in Natal, for example, all of these instances have been reported to the Magistrates and the Chief Native Commissioner. Every time they are told to find themselves other places, or remain where they are under labour conditions.  At Peters and Colworth, seventy-nine and a hundred families respectively are being ejected by the Government itself without providing land for them.\"  Some readers may perhaps think that I have taken the Colonial Parliament rather severely to task.  But to any reader who holds with Bacon, that \"the pencil hath laboured more in describing the afflictions of Job than the felicities of Solomon,\" I would say: \"Do, if we dare make the request, and place yourself in our shoes.\" If, after a proper declaration of war, you found your kinsmen driven from pillar to post in the manner that the South African Natives have been harried and scurried by Act No. 27 of 1913, you would, though aware that it is part of the fortunes of war, find it difficult to suppress your hatred of the enemy.  Similarly, if you see your countrymen and countrywomen driven from home, their homes broken up, with no hopes of redress, on the mandate of a Government to which they had loyally paid taxation without representation -- driven from their homes, because they do not want to become servants; and when you know that half of these homeless ones have perforce submitted to the conditions and accepted service on terms that are unprofitable to themselves; if you remember that more would have submitted but for the fact that no master has any use for a servant with forty head of cattle, or a hundred or more sheep; and if you further bear in mind that many landowners are anxious to live at peace with, and to keep your people as tenants, but that they are debarred from doing so by your Government which threatens them with a fine of 100 Pounds or six months' imprisonment, you would, I think, likewise find it very difficult to maintain a level head or wield a temperate pen.  For instance, let us say, the London County Council decrees that no man shall rent a room, or hire a house, in the City of London unless he be a servant in the employ of the landlord, adding that there shall be a fine of one hundred pounds on any one who attempts to sell a house to a non-householder; imagine such a thing and its effects, then you have some approach to an accurate picture of the operation of the South African Natives' Land Act of 1913.  In conclusion, let me ask the reader's support in our campaign for the repeal of such a law, and in making this request I pray that none of my readers may live to find themselves in a position so intolerable.  When the narrative of this book up to Chapter XVIII was completed, it was felt that an account of life in South Africa, without a reference to the war or the rebellion would be but a story half told, and so Chapters XIX-XXV were added. It will be observed that Chapters XX-XXIV, unlike the rest of the book, are not the result of the writer's own observations. The writer is indebted for much of the information in these five chapters to the Native Press and some Dutch newspapers which his devoted wife posted to him with every mail.  These papers have been a source of useful information.  Of the Dutch newspapers special thanks are due to `Het Westen' of Potchefstroom, which has since March 1915 changed its name to `Het Volksblad'. Most of the Dutch journals, especially in the northern Provinces, take up the views of English-speaking Dutch townsmen (solicitors and Bank clerks), and publish them as the opinion of the South African Dutch. `Het Westen' (now `Het Volksblad'), on the other hand, interprets the Dutch view, sound, bad or indifferent, exactly as we ourselves have heard it expressed by Dutchmen at their own farms.  Translations of the Tipperary Chorus into some of the languages which are spoken by the white and black inhabitants of South Africa have been used here and there as mottoes; and as this book is a plea in the main for help against the \"South African war of extermination\", it is hoped that admirers of Tommy Atkins will sympathize with the coloured sufferers, who also sing Tommy Atkins' war songs.  This appeal is not on behalf of the naked hordes of cannibals who are represented in fantastic pictures displayed in the shop-windows in Europe, most of them imaginary; but it is on behalf of five million loyal British subjects who shoulder \"the black man's burden\" every day, doing so without looking forward to any decoration or thanks.  \"The black man's burden\" includes the faithful performance of all the unskilled and least paying labour in South Africa, the payment of direct taxation to the various Municipalities, at the rate of from 1s. to 5s. per mensum per capita (to develop and beautify the white quarters of the towns while the black quarters remain unattended) besides taxes to the Provincial and Central Government, varying from 12s. to 3 Pounds 12s. per annum, for the maintenance of Government Schools from which native children are excluded.  In addition to these native duties and taxes, it is also part of \"the black man's burden\" to pay all duties levied from the favoured race.  With the increasing difficulty of finding openings to earn the money for paying these multifarious taxes, the dumb pack-ox, being inarticulate in the Councils of State, has no means of making known to its \"keeper\" that the burden is straining its back to breaking point.  When Sir John French appealed to the British people for more shells during Easter week, the Governor-General of South Africa addressing a fashionable crowd at the City Hall, Johannesburg, most of whom had never seen the mouth of a mine, congratulated them on the fact that \"under the strain of war and rebellion the gold industry had been maintained at full pitch,\" and he added that \"every ounce of gold was worth many shells to the Allies.\"  But His Excellency had not a word of encouragement for the 200,000 subterranean heroes who by day and by night, for a mere pittance, lay down their limbs and their"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14521"],["title","Memories: A Story of German Love (#1)"],["body","I was another being, and when I asked my mother what it meant, she replied it was an Easter song they were singing in the church.  What bright, holy song it was, which at that time surged through my soul, I have never been able to discover.  It must have been an old church hymn, like those which many a time stirred the rugged soul of our Luther.  I never heard it again, but many a time even now when I hear an adagio of Beethoven's, or a psalm of Marcellus, or a chorus of Handel's, or a simple song in the Scotch Highlands or the Tyrol, it seems to me as if the lofty church windows again glistened and the organ-tones once more surged through my soul, and a new world revealed itself--more beautiful than the starry heavens and the violet perfume.  These things I remember in my earliest childhood, and intermingled with them are my dear mother's looks, the calm, earnest gaze of my father, gardens and vine leaves, and soft green turf, and a very old and quaint picture-book--and this is all I can recall of the first scattered leaves of my childhood.  Afterwards it grows brighter and clearer.  Names and faces appear--not only father and mother, but brothers and sisters, friends and teachers, and a multitude of _strange people_.  Ah! yes, of these _strange people_ there is so much recorded in memory.     SECOND MEMORY.  Not far from our house, and opposite the old church with the golden cross, stood a large building, even larger than the church, and having many towers.  They looked exceedingly gray and old and had no golden cross, but stone eagles tipped the summits and a great white and blue banner fluttered from the highest tower, directly over the lofty doorway at the top of the steps, where, on either side, two mounted soldiers stood sentinels.  The building had many windows, and behind the windows you could distinguish red-silk curtains with golden tassels.  Old lindens encircled the grounds, which, in summer, overshadowed the gray masonry with their green leaves and bestrewed the turf with their fragrant white blossoms.  I had often looked in there, and at evening when the lindens exhaled their perfumes and the windows were illuminated, I saw many figures pass and repass like shadows. Music swept down from on high, and carriages drove up, from which ladies and gentlemen alighted and ascended the stairs.  They all looked so beautiful and good!  The gentlemen had stars upon their breasts, and the ladies wore fresh flowers in their hair; and I often thought,--Why do I not go there too?  One day my father took me by the hand and said: \"We are going to the castle; but you must be very polite if the Princess speaks to you, and kiss her hand.\"  I was about six years of age and as delighted as only one can be at six years of age.  I had already indulged in many quiet fancies about the shadows which I had seen evenings through the lighted windows, and had heard many good things at home of the beneficence of the Prince and Princess; how gracious they were; how much help and consolation they brought to the poor and sick; and that they had been chosen by the grace of God to protect the good and punish the bad.  I had long pictured to myself what transpired in the castle, so that the Prince and Princess were already old acquaintances whom I knew as well as my nut-crackers and leaden soldiers.  My heart beat quickly as I ascended the high stairs with my father, and just as he was telling me I must call the Princess \"Highness,\" and the Prince \"Serene Highness,\" the folding-door opened and I saw before me a tall figure with brilliantly piercing eyes.  She seemed to advance and stretch out her hand to me.  There was an expression on her countenance which I had long known, and a heavenly smile played about her cheeks. I could restrain myself no longer, and while my father stood at the door bowing very low--I knew not why--my heart sprang into my throat. I ran to the beautiful lady, threw my arms round her neck and kissed her as I would my mother.  The beautiful, majestic lady willingly submitted, stroked my hair and smiled; but my father took my hand, led me away, and said I was very rude, and that he should never take me there again.  I grew utterly bewildered.  The blood mounted to my cheeks, for I felt that my father had been unjust to me.  I looked at the Princess as if she ought to shield me, but upon her face was only an expression of mild earnestness.  Then I looked round upon the ladies and gentlemen assembled in the room, believing that they would come to my defense.  But as I looked, I saw that they were laughing.  Then the tears sprang into my eyes, and out of the door, down the stairs, and past the lindens in the castle yard, I rushed home, where I threw myself into my mother's arms and sobbed and wept.  \"What has happened to you?\" said she.  \"Oh! mother!\" I cried; \"I was at the Princess', and she was such a good and beautiful woman, just like you, dear mother, that I had to throw my arms round her neck and kiss her.\"  \"Ah!\" said my mother; \"you should not have done that, for they are strangers and high dignitaries.\"  \"And what then are strangers?\" said I.  \"May I not love all people who look upon me with affectionate and friendly eyes?\"  \"You can love them, my son,\" replied my mother, \"but you should not show it.\"  \"Is it then something wrong for me to love people?\" said I.  \"Why cannot I show it?\"  \"Well, perhaps you are right,\" said she, \"but you must do as your father says, and when you are older you will understand why you cannot embrace every woman who regards you with affectionate and friendly eyes.\"  That was a sad day.  Father came home, agreed I had been very uncivil. At night my mother put me to bed, and I prayed, but I could not sleep, and kept wondering what these strange people were, whom one must not love.        *      *      *      *      *  Thou poor human heart!  So soon in the spring are thy leaves broken and the feathers torn from the wings!  When the spring-red of life opens the hidden calyx of the soul, it perfumes our whole being with love. We learn to stand and to walk, to speak and to read, but no one teaches us love.  It is inherent in us like life, they say, and is the very deepest foundation of our existence.  As the heavenly bodies incline to and attract each other, and will always cling together by the everlasting law of gravitation, so heavenly souls incline to and attract each other, and will always cling together by the everlasting law of love.  A flower cannot blossom without sunshine, and man cannot live without love.  Would not the child's heart break in despair when the first cold storm of the world sweeps over it, if the warm sunlight of love from the eyes of mother and father did not shine upon him like the soft reflection of divine light and love?  The ardent yearning, which then awakes in the child, is the purest and deepest love.  It is the love which embraces the whole world; which shines resplendent wherever the eyes of men beam upon it, which exults wherever it hears the human voice.  It is the old, immeasurable love, a deep well which no plummet has ever sounded; a fountain of perennial richness.  Whoever knows it also knows that in love there is no More and no Less; but that he who loves can only love with the whole heart, and with the whole soul; with all his strength and with all his will.  But, alas, how little remains of this love by the time we have finished one-half of our life-journey!  Soon the child learns that there are strangers, and ceases to be a child.  The spring of love becomes hidden and soon filled up.  Our eyes gleam no more, and heavy-hearted we pass one another in the bustling streets.  We scarcely greet each other, for we know how sharply it cuts the soul when a greeting remains unanswered, and how sad it is to be sundered from those whom we have once greeted, and whose hands we have clasped.  The wings of the soul lose their plumes; the leaves of the flower fast fall off and wither; and of this fountain of love there remain but a few drops.  We still call these few drops love, but it is no longer the clear, fresh, all-abounding child-love.  It is love with anxiety and trouble, a consuming flame, a burning passion; love which wastes itself like rain-drops upon the hot sand; love which is a longing, not a sacrifice; love which says \"Wilt thou be mine,\" not love which says, \"I must be thine.\"  It is a most selfish, vacillating love.  And this is the love which poets sing and in which young men and maidens believe; a fire which burns up and down, yet does not warm, and leaves nothing behind but smoke and ashes.  All of us at some period of life have believed that these rockets of sunbeams were everlasting love, but the brighter the glitter, the darker the night which follows.  And then when all around grows dark, when we feel utterly alone, when all men right and left pass us by and know us not, a forgotten feeling rises in the breast.  We know not what it is, for it is neither love nor friendship.  You feel like crying to him who passes you so cold and strange: \"Dost thou not know me?\"  Then one realizes that man is nearer to man than brother to brother, father to son, or friend to friend. How an old, holy saying rings through our souls, that strangers are nearest to us.  Why must we pass them in silence?  We know not, but must resign ourselves to it.  When two trains are rushing by upon the iron rails and thou seest a well-known eye that would recognize thee, stretch out thy hand and try to grasp the hand of a friend, and perhaps thou wilt understand why man passes man in silence here below.  An old sage says: \"I saw the fragments of a wrecked boat floating on the sea.  Only a few meet and hold together a long time.  Then comes a storm and drives them east and west, and here below they will never meet again.  So it is with mankind.  Yet no one has seen the great shipwreck.\"     THIRD MEMORY.  The clouds in the sky of childhood do not last long,"]]]
