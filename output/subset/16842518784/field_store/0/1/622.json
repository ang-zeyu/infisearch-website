Histories of Sexual Development.     SEXUAL SELECTION IN MAN.  The External Sensory Stimuli Affecting Selection in Man--The Four Senses Involved.   Tumescence--the process by which the organism is brought into the physical and psychic state necessary to insure conjugation and detumescence--to some extent comes about through the spontaneous action of internal forces. To that extent it is analogous to the physical and psychic changes which accompany the gradual filling of the bladder and precede its evacuation. But even among animals who are by no means high in the zoölogical scale the process is more complicated than this. External stimuli act at every stage, arousing or heightening the process of tumescence, and in normal human beings it may be said that the process is never completed without the aid of such stimuli, for even in the auto-erotic sphere external stimuli are still active, either actually or in imagination.  The chief stimuli which influence tumescence and thus direct sexual choice come chiefly--indeed, exclusively--through the four senses of touch, smell, hearing, and sight. All the phenomena of sexual selection, so far as they are based externally, act through these four senses.[1] The reality of the influence thus exerted may be demonstrated statistically even in civilized man, and it has been shown that, as regards, for instance, eye-color, conjugal partners differ sensibly from the unmarried persons by whom they are surrounded. When, therefore, we are exploring the nature of the influence which stimuli, acting through the sensory channels, exert on the strength and direction of the sexual impulse, we are intimately concerned with the process by which the actual form and color, not alone of living things generally, but of our own species, have been shaped and are still being shaped. At the same time, it is probable, we are exploring the mystery which underlies all the subtle appreciations, all the emotional undertones, which are woven in the web of the whole world as it appeals to us through those sensory passages by which alone it can reach us. We are here approaching, therefore, a fundamental subject of unsurpassable importance, a subject which has not yet been accurately explored save at a few isolated points and one which it is therefore impossible to deal with fully and adequately. Yet it cannot be passed over, for it enters into the whole psychology of the sexual instinct.  Of the four senses--touch, smell, hearing, and sight--with which we are here concerned, touch is the most primitive, and it may be said to be the most important, though it is usually the last to make its appeal felt. Smell, which occupies the chief place among many animals, is of comparatively less importance, though of considerable interest, in man; it is only less intimate and final than touch. Sight occupies an intermediate position, and on this account, and also on account of the very great part played by vision in life generally as well as in art, it is the most important of all the senses from the human sexual point of view. Hearing, from the same point of view, is the most remote of all the senses in its appeal to the sexual impulse, and on that account it is, when it intervenes, among the first to make its influence felt.   FOOTNOTES:  [1] Taste must, I believe, be excluded, for if we abstract the parts of touch and smell, even in those abnormal sexual acts in which it may seem to be affected, taste could scarcely have any influence. Most of our \"tasting,\" as Waller puts it, is done by the nose, which, in man, is in specially close relationship, posteriorly, with the mouth. There are at most four taste sensations--sweet, bitter, salt, and sour--if even all of these are simple tastes. What commonly pass for taste sensations, as shown by some experiments of G.T.W. Patrick (_Psychological Review_, 1898, p. 160), are the composite results of the mingling of sensations of smell, touch, temperature, sight, and taste.     TOUCH.  I.  The Primitive Character of the Skin--Its Qualities--Touch the Earliest Source of Sensory Pleasure--The Characteristics of Touch--As the Alpha and Omega of Affection--The Sexual Organs a Special Adaptation of Touch--Sexual Attraction as Originated by Touch--Sexual Hyperæsthesia to Touch--The Sexual Associations of Acne.   We are accustomed to regard the skin as mainly owing its existence to the need for the protection of the delicate vessels, nerves, viscera, and muscles underneath. Undoubtedly it performs, and by its tough and elastic texture is well fitted to perform, this extremely important service. But the skin is not merely a method of protection against the external world; it is also a method of bringing us into sensitive contact with the external world. It is thus, as the organ of touch, the seat of the most widely diffused sense we possess, and, moreover, the sense which is the most ancient and fundamental of all--the mother of the other senses.  It is scarcely necessary to insist that the primitive nature of the sensory function of the skin with the derivative nature of the other senses, is a well ascertained and demonstrable fact. The lower we descend in the animal scale, the more varied we find the functions of the skin to be, and if in the higher animals much of the complexity has disappeared, that is only because the specialization of the various skin regions into distinct organs has rendered this complexity unnecessary. Even yet, however, in man himself the skin still retains, in a more or less latent condition, much of its varied and primary power, and the analysis of pathological and even normal phenomena serves to bring these old powers into clear light.      Woods Hutchinson (_Studies in Human and Comparative Pathology_,     1901, Chapters VII and VIII) has admirably set forth the immense     importance of the skin, as in the first place \"a tissue which is     silk to the touch, the most exquisitely beautiful surface in the     universe to the eye, and yet a wall of adamant against hostile     attack. Impervious alike, by virtue of its wonderful responsive     vitality, to moisture and drought, cold and heat, electrical     changes, hostile bacteria, the most virulent of poisons and the     deadliest of gases, it is one of the real Wonders of the World.     More beautiful than velvet, softer and more pliable than silk,     more impervious than rubber, and more durable under exposure than     steel, well-nigh as resistant to electric currents as glass, it     is one of the toughest and most dangerproof substances in the     three kingdoms of nature\" (although, as this author adds, we     \"hardly dare permit it to see the sunlight or breathe the open     air\"). But it is more than this. It is, as Woods Hutchinson     expresses it, the creator of the entire body; its embryonic     infoldings form the alimentary canal, the brain, the spinal cord,     while every sense is but a specialization of its general organic     activity. It is furthermore a kind of \"skin-heart,\" promoting the     circulation by its own energy; it is the great heat-regulating     organ of the body; it is an excretory organ only second to the     kidneys, which descend from it, and finally it still remains the     seat of touch.      It may be added that the extreme beauty of the skin as a surface     is very clearly brought out by the inadequacy of the comparisons     commonly used in order to express its beauty. Snow, marble,     alabaster, ivory, milk, cream, silk, velvet, and all the other     conventional similes furnish surfaces which from any point of     view are incomparably inferior to the skin itself. (Cf. Stratz,     _Die Schönheit des Weiblichen Körpers_, Chapter XII.)      With reference to the extraordinary vitality of the skin,     emphasized by Woods Hutchinson, it may be added that, when     experimenting on the skin with the electric current, Waller found     that healthy skin showed signs of life ten days or more after     excision. It has been found also that fragments of skin which     have been preserved in sterile fluid for even as long as nine     months may still be successfully transplanted on to the body.     (_British Medical Journal_, July 19, 1902.)      Everything indicates, remark Stanley Hall and Donaldson (\"Motor     Sensations in the Skin,\" _Mind_, 1885), that the skin is \"not     only the primeval and most reliable source of our knowledge of     the external world or the archæological field of psychology,\" but     a field in which work may shed light on some of the most     fundamental problems of psychic action. Groos (_Spiele der     Menschen_, pp. 8-16) also deals with the primitive character of     touch sensations.      Touch sensations are without doubt the first of all the sensory"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13613"],["title","Studies in the Psychology of Sex, Volume 4 (#2)"],["body","to prove pleasurable. We should, indeed, expect this     from the fact that the skin reflexes have already appeared before     birth, while a pleasurable sensitiveness of the lips is doubtless     a factor in the child's response to the contact of the maternal     nipple. Very early memories of sensory pleasure seem to be     frequently, perhaps most frequently, tactile in character, though     this fact is often disguised in recollection, owing to tactile     impression being vague and diffused; there is thus in Elizabeth     Potwin's \"Study of Early Memories\" (_Psychological Review_,     November, 1901) no separate group of tactile memories, and the     more elaborate investigation by Colegrove (\"Individual Memories,\"     _American Journal of Psychology_, January, 1899) yields no     decisive results under this head. See, however, Stanley Hall's     valuable study, \"Some Aspects of the Early Sense of Self,\"     _American Journal of Psychology_, April, 1898. Külpe has a     discussion of the psychology of cutaneous sensations (_Outlines     of Psychology_ [English translation], pp. 87 et seq.)      Harriet Martineau, at the beginning of her _Autobiography_,     referring to the vivid character of tactile sensations in early     childhood, remarks, concerning an early memory of touching a     velvet button, that \"the rapture of the sensation was really     monstrous.\" And a lady tells me that one of her earliest memories     at the age of 3 is of the exquisite sensation of the casual     contact of a cool stone with the vulva in the act of urinating.     Such sensations, of course, cannot be termed specifically sexual,     though they help to furnish the tactile basis on which the     specifically sexual sensations develop.      The elementary sensitiveness of the skin is shown by the fact     that moderate excitation suffices to raise the temperature, while     Heidenhain and others have shown that in animals cutaneous     stimuli modify the sensibility of the brain cortex, slight     stimulus increasing excitability and strong stimulus diminishing     it. Féré has shown that the slight stimulus to the skin furnished     by placing a piece of metal on the arm or elsewhere suffices to     increase the output of work with the ergograph. (Féré, _Comptes     Rendus Société de Biologie_, July 12, 1902; id., _Pathologic des     Emotions_, pp. 40 et seq.)      Féré found that the application of a mustard plaster to the skin,     or an icebag, or a hot-water bottle, or even a light touch with a     painter's brush, all exerted a powerful effect in increasing     muscular work with the ergograph. \"The tonic effect of cutaneous     excitation,\" he remarks, \"throws light on the psychology of the     caress. It is always the most sensitive parts of the body which     seek to give or to receive caresses. Many animals rub or lick     each other. The mucous surfaces share in this irritability of the     skin. The kiss is not only an expression of feeling; it is a     means of provoking it. Cataglottism is by no means confined to     pigeons. The tonic value of cutaneous stimulation is indeed a     commonly accepted idea. Wrestlers rub their hands or limbs, and     the hand-shake also is not without its physiological basis.      \"Cutaneous excitations may cause painful sensations to cease. Many     massage practices which favor work act chiefly as sensorial     stimulants; on this account many nervous persons cannot abandon     them, and the Greeks and Romans found in massage not only health,     but pleasure. Lauder Brunton regards many common manoeuvres, like     scratching the head and pulling the mustache, as methods of     dilating the bloodvessels of the brain by stimulating the facial     nerve. The motor reactions of cutaneous excitations favor this     hypothesis.\" (Féré, _Travail et Plaisir_, Chapter XV, \"Influence     des Excitations du Toucher sur le Travail.\")  The main characteristics of the primitive sense of touch are its wide diffusion over the whole body and the massive vagueness and imprecision of the messages it sends to the brain. This is the reason, why it is, of all the senses, the least intellectual and the least æsthetic; it is also the reason why it is, of all the senses, the most-profoundly emotional. \"Touch,\" wrote Bain in his _Emotions and Will_, \"is both the alpha and the omega of affection,\" and he insisted on the special significance in this connection of \"tenderness\"--a characteristic emotional quality of affection which is directly founded on sensations of touch. If tenderness is the alpha of affection, even between the sexes, its omega is to be found in the sexual embrace, which may be said to be a method of obtaining, through a specialized organization of the skin, the most exquisite and intense sensations of touch.      \"We believe nothing is so exciting to the instinct or mere     passions as the presence of the hand or those tactile caresses     which mark affection,\" states the anonymous author of an article     on \"Woman in her Psychological Relations,\" in the _Journal of     Psychological Medicine_, 1851. \"They are the most general stimuli     in lower animals. The first recourse in difficulty or danger, and     the primary solace in anguish, for woman is the bosom of her     husband or her lover. She seeks solace and protection and repose     on that part of the body where she herself places the objects of     her own affection. Woman appears to have the same instinctive     impulse in this respect all over the world.\"  It is because the sexual orgasm is founded on a special adaptation and intensification of touch sensations that the sense of touch generally is to be regarded as occupying the very first place in reference to the sexual emotions. Féré, Mantegazza, Penta, and most other writers on this question are here agreed. Touch sensations constitute a vast gamut for the expression of affection, with at one end the note of minimum personal affection in the brief and limited touch involved by the conventional hand-shake and the conventional kiss, and at the other end the final and intimate contact in which passion finds the supreme satisfaction of its most profound desire. The intermediate region has its great significance for us because it offers a field in which affection has its full scope, but in which every road may possibly lead to the goal of sexual love. It is the intimacy of touch contacts, their inevitable approach to the threshold of sexual emotion, which leads to a jealous and instinctive parsimony in the contact of skin and skin and to the tendency with the increased sensitiveness of the nervous system involved by civilization to restrain even the conventional touch manifestation of ordinary affection and esteem. In China fathers leave off kissing their daughters while they are still young children. In England the kiss as an ordinary greeting between men and women--a custom inherited from classic and early Christian antiquity--still persisted to the beginning of the eighteenth century. In France the same custom existed in the seventeenth century, but in the middle of that century was beginning to be regarded as dangerous,[2] while at the present time the conventional kiss on the cheek is strictly differentiated from the kiss on the mouth, which is reserved for lovers. Touch contacts between person and person, other than those limited and defined by custom, tend to become either unpleasant--as an undesired intrusion into an intimate sphere--or else, when occurring between man and woman at some peculiar moment, they may make a powerful reverberation in the emotional and more specifically sexual sphere. One man falls in love with his future wife because he has to carry her upstairs with a sprained ankle. Another dates his love-story from a romp in which his cheek accidentally came in contact with that of his future wife. A woman will sometimes instinctively strive to attract the attention of the man who appeals to her by a peculiar and prolonged pressure of the hand--the only touch contact permitted to her. Dante, as Penta has remarked, refers to \"sight or touch\" as the two channels through which a woman's love is revived (_Purgatorio_, VIII, 76). Even the hand-shake of a sympathetic man is enough in some chaste and sensitive women to produce sexual excitement or sometimes even the orgasm. The cases in which love arises from the influence of stimuli coming through the sense of touch are no doubt frequent, and they would be still more frequent if it were not that the very proximity of this sense to the sexual sphere causes it to be guarded with a care which in the case of the other senses it is impossible to exercise. This intimacy of touch and the reaction against its sexual approximations leads to what James has called \"the _antisexual instinct_, the instinct of personal isolation, the actual repulsiveness to us of the idea of intimate contact with most of the persons we meet, especially those of our own sex.\" He refers in this connection to the unpleasantness of the sensation felt on occupying a seat still warm from the body of another person.[3] The Catholic Church has always recognized the risks of vuluptuous emotion involved in tactile contacts, and the facility with which even the most innocent contacts may take on a libidinous character.[4]      The following observations were written by a lady (aged 30) who     has never had sexual relationships: \"I am only conscious of a     very sweet and pleasurable emotion when coming in contact with     honorable men, and consider that a comparison can be made between     the idealism of such emotions and those of music, of beauties of     Nature, and of productions of art. While studying and writing     articles upon a new subject I came in contact with a specialist,     who rendered me considerable aid, and, one day, while jointly     correcting a piece of work, he touched my hand. This produced a     sweet and"]]]
