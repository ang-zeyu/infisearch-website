Very terrible,  though very calm, is outraged Nature.   Though the mills of God grind slowly,    Yet they grind exceeding small; Though He sit, and wait with patience,    With exactness grinds He all.   It is, I believe, one of the most hopeful among the many hopeful  signs of the times, that the civilised nations of Europe and America  are awakening slowly but surely to this truth.  The civilised world  is learning, thank God, more and more of the importance of physical  science; year by year, thank God, it is learning to live more and  more according to those laws of physical science, which are, as the  great Lord Bacon said of old, none other than \"Vox Dei in rebus  revelata\"--the Word of God revealed in facts; and it is gaining by so  doing, year by year, more and more of health and wealth; of peaceful  and comfortable, even of graceful and elevating, means of life for  fresh millions.  If you want to know what the study of physical science has done for  man, look, as a single instance, at the science of Sanatory Reform;  the science which does not merely try to cure disease, and shut the  stable-door after the horse is stolen, but tries to prevent disease;  and, thank God! is succeeding beyond our highest expectations.  Or  look at the actual fresh amount of employment, of subsistence, which  science has, during the last century, given to men; and judge for  yourselves whether the study of it be not one worthy of those who  wish to help themselves, and, in so doing, to help their fellow-men.   Let me quote to you a passage from an essay urging the institution of  schools of physical science for artisans, which says all I wish to  say and more:  \"The discoveries of Voltaic electricity, electromagnetism, and  magnetic electricity, by Volta, OErsted, and Faraday, led to the  invention of electric telegraphy by Wheatstone and others, and to the  great manufactures of telegraph cables and telegraph wire, and of the  materials required for them.  The value of the cargo of the Great  Eastern alone in the recent Bombay telegraph expedition was  calculated at three millions of pounds sterling.  It also led to the  employment of thousands of operators to transmit the telegraphic  messages, and to a great increase of our commerce in nearly all its  branches by the more rapid means of communication.  The discovery of  Voltaic electricity further led to the invention of electro-plating,  and to the employment of a large number of persons in that business.   The numerous experimental researches on specific heat, latent heat,  the tension of vapours, the properties of water, the mechanical  effect of heat, etc., resulted in the development of steam-engines,  and railways, and the almost endless employments depending upon their  construction and use.  About a quarter of a million of persons are  employed on railways alone in Great Britain.  The various original  investigations on the chemical effects of light led to the invention  of photography, and have given employment to thousands of persons who  practise that process, or manufacture and prepare the various  material and articles required in it.  The discovery of chlorine by  Scheele led to the invention of the modern processes of bleaching,  and to various improvements in the dyeing of the textile fabrics, and  has given employment to a very large number of our Lancashire  operatives.  The discovery of chlorine has also contributed to the  employment of thousands of printers, by enabling Esparto grass to be  bleached and formed into paper for the use of our daily press.  The  numerous experimental investigations in relation to coal-gas have  been the means of extending the use of that substance, and of  increasing the employment of workmen and others connected with its  manufacture.  The discovery of the alkaline metals by Davy, of  cyanide of potassium, of nickel, phosphorus, the common acids, and a  multitude of other substances, has led to the employment of a whole  army of workmen in the conversion of those substances into articles  of utility.  The foregoing examples might be greatly enlarged upon,  and a great many others might be selected from the sciences of  physics and chemistry:  but those mentioned will suffice.  There is  not a force of Nature, nor scarcely a material substance that we  employ, which has not been the subject of several, and in some cases  of numerous, original experimental researches, many of which have  resulted, in a greater or less degree, in increasing the employment  for workmen and others.\" {1}  \"All this may be very true.  But of what practical use will physical  science be to me?\"  Let me ask in return:  Are none of you going to emigrate?  If you  have courage and wisdom, emigrate you will, some of you, instead of  stopping here to scramble over each other's backs for the scraps,  like black-beetles in a kitchen.  And if you emigrate, you will soon  find out, if you have eyes and common sense, that the vegetable  wealth of the world is no more exhausted than its mineral wealth.   Exhausted?  Not half of it--I believe not a tenth of it--is yet  known.  Could I show you the wealth which I have seen in a single  Tropic island, not sixty miles square--precious timbers, gums,  fruits, what not, enough to give employment and wealth to thousands  and tens of thousands, wasting for want of being known and worked-- then you would see what a man who emigrates may do, by a little sound  knowledge of botany alone.  And if not.  Suppose that any one of you, learning a little sound  Natural History, should abide here in Britain to your life's end, and  observe nothing but the hedgerow plants, he would find that there is  much more to be seen in those mere hedgerow plants than he fancies  now.  The microscope will reveal to him in the tissues of any wood,  of any seed, wonders which will first amuse him, then puzzle him, and  at last (I hope) awe him, as he perceives that smallness of size  interferes in no way with perfection of development, and that  \"Nature,\" as has been well said, \"is greatest in that which is  least.\"  And more.  Suppose that he went further still.  Suppose that  he extended his researches somewhat to those minuter vegetable forms,  the mosses, fungi, lichens; suppose that he went a little further  still, and tried what the microscope would show him in any stagnant  pool, whether fresh water or salt, of Desmidiae, Diatoms, and all  those wondrous atomies which seem as yet to defy our classification  into plants or animals.  Suppose he learnt something of this, but  nothing of aught else.  Would he have gained no solid wisdom?  He  would be a stupider man than I have a right to believe any of my  readers to be, if he had not gained thereby somewhat of the most  valuable of treasures--namely, that inductive habit of mind, that  power of judging fairly of facts, without which no good or lasting  work will be done, whether in physical science, in social science, in  politics, in philosophy, in philology, or in history.  But more:  let me urge you to study Natural Science, on grounds which  may be to you new and unexpected--on social, I had almost said on  political, grounds.  We all know, and I trust we all love, the names of Liberty, Equality,  and Brotherhood.  We feel, I trust, that these words are too  beautiful not to represent true and just ideas; and that therefore  they will come true, and be fulfilled, somewhen, somewhere, somehow.   It may be in a shape very different from that which you, or I, or any  man expects; but still they will be fulfilled.  But if they are to come true, it is we, the individual men, who must  help them to come true for the whole world, by practising them  ourselves, when and where we can.  And I tell you--that in becoming  scientific men, in studying science and acquiring the scientific  habit of mind, you will find yourselves enjoying a freedom, an  equality, a brotherhood, such as you will not find elsewhere just  now.  Freedom:  what do we want freedom for?  For this, at least; that we  may be each and all able to think what we choose; and to say what we  choose also, provided we do not say it rudely or violently, so as to  provoke a breach of the peace.  That last was Mr. Buckle's definition  of freedom of speech.  That was the only limit to it which he would  allow; and I think that that is Mr. John Stuart Mill's limit also.   It is mine.  And I think we have that kind of freedom in these  islands as perfectly as any men are likely to have it on this earth.  But what I complain of is, that when men have got the freedom, three  out of four of them will not use it.  What?--someone will answer--Do  you suppose that I will not say what I choose, and that I dare not  speak my own mind to any man?  Doubtless.  But are you sure first,  that you think what you choose, or only what someone else chooses for  you?  Are you sure that you make up your own mind before you speak,  or let someone else make it up for you?  Your speech may be free  enough, my good friend; and Heaven forbid that it should be anything  else:  but are your thoughts free likewise?  Are you sure that,  though you may hate bigotry in others, you are not somewhat of a  bigot yourself?  That you do not look at only one side of a question,  and that the one which pleases you?  That you do not take up your  opinions at second hand, from some book or some newspaper, which  after all only reflects your own feelings, your own opinions?  You  should ask yourselves that question, seriously and often:  \"Are my  thoughts really free?\"  No one values more highly than I do the  advantage of a free press.  "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10251"],["title","Town Geology (#2)"],["body","you must remember always that a  newspaper editor, however honest or able, is no more infallible than  the Pope; that he may, just as you may, only see one side of a  question, while any question is sure to have two sides, or perhaps  three or four; and if you only see the side which suits you, day  after day, month after month, you must needs become bigoted to it.   Your thoughts must needs run in one groove.  They cannot (as Mr.  Matthew Arnold would say) \"play freely round\" a question; and look it  all over, boldly, patiently, rationally, charitably.  And I tell you that if you, or I, or any man, want to let our  thoughts play freely round questions, and so escape from the tendency  to become bigoted and narrow-minded which there is in every human  being, then we must acquire something of that inductive habit of mind  which the study of Natural Science gives.  It is, after all, as  Professor Huxley says, only common sense well regulated.  But then it  is well regulated; and how precious it is, if you can but get it.   The art of seeing, the art of knowing what you see; the art of  comparing, of perceiving true likenesses and true differences, and so  of classifying and arranging what you see:  the art of connecting  facts together in your own mind in chains of cause and effect, and  that accurately, patiently, calmly, without prejudice, vanity, or  temper--this is what is wanted for true freedom of mind.  But  accuracy, patience, freedom from prejudice, carelessness for all  except the truth, whatever the truth may be--are not these the  virtues of a truly free spirit?  Then, as I said just now, I know no  study so able to give that free habit of mind as the Study of Natural  Science.  Equality, too:  whatever equality may or may not be just, or  possible; this at least, is just, and I hope possible; that every  man, every child, of every rank, should have an equal chance of  education; an equal chance of developing all that is in him by  nature; an equal chance of acquiring a fair knowledge of those facts  of the universe which specially concern him; and of having his reason  trained to judge of them.  I say, whatever equal rights men may or  may not have, they have this right.  Let every boy, every girl, have  an equal and sound education.  If I had my way, I would give the same  education to the child of the collier and to the child of a peer.  I  would see that they were taught the same things, and by the same  method.  Let them all begin alike, say I.  They will be handicapped  heavily enough as they go on in life, without our handicapping them  in their first race.  Whatever stable they come out of, whatever  promise they show, let them all train alike, and start fair, and let  the best colt win.  Well:  but there is a branch of education in which, even now, the  poor man can compete fairly against the rich; and that is, Natural  Science.  In the first place, the rich, blind to their own interest,  have neglected it hitherto in their schools; so that they have not  the start of the poor man on that subject which they have on many.   In the next place, Natural Science is a subject which a man cannot  learn by paying for teachers.  He must teach it himself, by patient  observation, by patient common sense.  And if the poor man is not the  rich man's equal in those qualities, it must be his own fault, not  his purse's.  Many shops have I seen about the world, in which fools  could buy articles more or less helpful to them; but never saw I yet  an observation-shop, nor a common-sense shop either.  And if any man  says, \"We must buy books:\" I answer, a poor man now can obtain better  scientific books than a duke or a prince could sixty years ago,  simply because then the books did not exist.  When I was a boy I  would have given much, or rather my father would have given much, if  I could have got hold of such scientific books as are to be found now  in any first-class elementary school.  And if more expensive books  are needed; if a microscope or apparatus is needed; can you not get  them by the co-operative method, which has worked so well in other  matters?  Can you not form yourselves into a Natural Science club,  for buying such things and lending them round among your members; and  for discussion also, the reading of scientific papers of your own  writing, the comparing of your observations, general mutual help and  mutual instructions?  Such societies are becoming numerous now, and  gladly should I see one in every town.  For in science, as in most  matters, \"As iron sharpeneth iron, so a man sharpeneth the  countenance of his friend.\"  And Brotherhood:  well, if you want that; if you want to mix with  men, and men, too, eminently worth mixing with, on the simple ground  that \"a man's a man for a' that;\" if you want to become the  acquaintances, and--if you prove worthy--the friends, of men who will  be glad to teach you all they know, and equally glad to learn from  you anything you can teach them, asking no questions about you, save,  first--Is he an honest student of Nature for her own sake?  And next- -Is he a man who will not quarrel, or otherwise behave in an  unbrotherly fashion to his fellow-students?--If you want a ground of  brotherhood with men, not merely in these islands, but in America, on  the Continent--in a word, all over the world--such as rank, wealth,  fashion, or other artificial arrangements of the world cannot give  and cannot take away; if you want to feel yourself as good as any man  in theory, because you are as good as any man in practice, except  those who are better than you in the same line, which is open to any  and every man; if you wish to have the inspiring and ennobling  feeling of being a brother in a great freemasonry which owns no  difference of rank, of creed, or of nationality--the only  freemasonry, the only International League which is likely to make  mankind (as we all hope they will be some day) one--then become men  of science.  Join the freemasonry in which Hugh Miller, the poor  Cromarty stonemason, in which Michael Faraday, the poor bookbinder's  boy, became the companions and friends of the noblest and most  learned on earth, looked up to by them not as equals merely but as  teachers and guides, because philosophers and discoverers.  Do you wish to be great?  Then be great with true greatness; which  is,--knowing the facts of nature, and being able to use them.  Do you  wish to be strong?  Then be strong with true strength; which is,  knowing the facts of nature, and being able to use them.  Do you wish  to be wise?  Then be wise with true wisdom; which is, knowing the  facts of nature, and being able to use them.  Do you wish to be free?   Then be free with true freedom; which is again, knowing the facts of  nature, and being able to use them.  I dare say some of my readers, especially the younger ones, will  demur to that last speech of mine.  Well, I hope they will not be  angry with me for saying it.  I, at least, shall certainly not he  angry with them.  For when I was young I was very much of what I  suspect is their opinion.  I used to think one could get perfect  freedom, and social reform, and all that I wanted, by altering the  arrangements of society and legislation; by constitutions, and Acts  of Parliament; by putting society into some sort of freedom-mill, and  grinding it all down, and regenerating it so.  And that something can  be done by improved arrangements, something can be done by Acts of  Parliament, I hold still, as every rational man must hold.  But as I grew older, I began to see that if things were to be got  right, the freedom-mill would do very little towards grinding them  right, however well and amazingly it was made.  I began to see that  what sort of flour came out at one end of the mill, depended mainly  on what sort of grain you had put in at the other; and I began to see  that the problem was to get good grain, and then good flour would be  turned out, even by a very clumsy old-fashioned sort of mill.  And  what do I mean by good grain?  Good men, honest men, accurate men,  righteous men, patient men, self-restraining men, fair men, modest  men.  Men who are aware of their own vast ignorance compared with the  vast amount that there is to be learned in such a universe as this.   Men who are accustomed to look at both sides of a question; who,  instead of making up their minds in haste like bigots and fanatics,  wait like wise men, for more facts, and more thought about the facts.   In one word, men who had acquired just the habit of mind which the  study of Natural Science can give, and must give; for without it  there is no use studying Natural Science; and the man who has not got  that habit of mind, if he meddles with science, will merely become a  quack and a charlatan, only fit to get his bread as a spirit-rapper,  or an inventor of infallible pills.  And when I saw that, I said to myself--I will train myself, by  Natural Science, to the truly rational, and therefore truly able and  useful, habit of mind; and more, I will, for it is my duty as an  Englishman, train every Englishman over whom I can get influence in  the same scientific habit of mind, that I may, if possible, make him,  too, a rational and an able man.  And, therefore, knowing that most of you, my readers--probably all of  you, as you ought and must if you are Britons, think much of social  and political questions---therefore, I say, I entreat you to  cultivate the scientific spirit by which alone you can judge justly  of those questions.  I ask you to learn how to \"conquer nature by  obeying her,\" as the great Lord Bacon said two hundred and fifty  years ago.  For so only will you in your theories and your movements,  draw \"bills which nature will honour\"--to use Mr. Carlyle's famous  parable--because they are according to her unchanging laws, and not  have them returned on your hands, as too many theorists' are, with  \"no effects\""]]]
