Hustle into your pajamas.\"  Perhaps Midshipman Dalzell did not make all the speed that his roommate desired, but at last Dan was safely rid of his uniform, underclothing and shoes, and stood arrayed in pajamas.  \"Now, I'll hide this doughface over night,\" whispered Darrin, going toward Dalzell's bed.  \"At the same time you get the articles of your equipment out from under your bed clothes and hang them up where they belong.\"  \"I'll have to light the candle for that,\" muttered Dan.  \"If you do, I'll blow it out.  There's a regulation against running lights in the rooms after taps.\"  \"Do you worship the little blue-covered volume of regulations, Dave?\" Dan demanded with a laugh.  \"No; but I don't propose to take any chances in my last year here. I don't intend to lose my commission in the Navy just because I can't control myself.\"  Dan sniffed, but he silently got his parts of uniform out from between the sheets and hung up the articles where they belonged, in this going by the sense of feeling.  Then, all in the dark as they were, Midshipman Dave Darrin seized his chum and roommate by the shoulders.  \"Danny boy,\" he commanded firmly, \"come over with an account of yourself!  Why this mad prank tonight---and what was it?\"     CHAPTER II  SOME ONE PUSHES THE TUNGSTEN   You don't have to know every blessed thing that I do, do you?\" demanded Dan Dalzell, in an almost offended tone.  \"No; and I have no right to know anything that you don't tell me willingly.  Are you ready to give me any explanation of tonight's foolishness?  \"Seeing that you kept awake for me, and were on hand to let me in, I suppose I'll have to,\" grumbled Dan.  \"Well, then?  \"Dave, for the first time tonight, I struck my flag.\"  \"Struck to whom?\"  \"Oh---a girl, of course,\" grunted Dan.  \"You?  A girl?\" repeated Dave in amazement.  \"Yes; is it any crime for me to get acquainted with a girl, and to call on her at her home?\"  \"Certainly not.  But, Dan, I didn't believe that you ever felt a single flutter of the pulse when girls were around.  I thought you were going to grow up into a cheerful, happy old bachelor.\"  \"So did I,\" sighed Dan.  \"And now you've gone and met your fate?\"  \"I'm not so sure about that,\" Dalzell retorted moodily.  \"Do you mean that you don't stand any real show in front of the pair of bright eyes that have made you strike your colors?\"  \"I'm afraid I don't.\"  \"Dan, is the game worth the candle,\" argued Darrin.  \"You're mightily interested in Belle Meade, aren't you?\"  \"Yes; but that's different, Danny boy.\"  \"How is it different, I'd like to know?\"  \"Well, in the first place, there's no guesswork in my case.  Belle and I are engaged, and we feel perfectly sure each of the other. I'm so sure of Belle that I dream about her only in my leisure moments.  I don't ever let her face come between myself and the pages of a textbook.  I am here at the Naval Academy working for a future that Belle is to share with me when the time comes, and so, in justice to her, I don't let the thought of her get between myself and the duties that will lead to the career she is to share with me.\"  \"Humph!\" commented Midshipman Dalzell.  \"Above all, Dan, I've never Frenched it over the wall.  I don't take any disciplinary chances that can possibly shut me off from the career that Belle and I have planned.  Belle Meade, Danny boy, would be the first to scold me if she knew that I had Frenched it over the wall in order to meet her.\"  \"Well, Miss Preston doesn't know but what I had regular leave tonight,\" Danny replied.  \"Miss Preston?\" repeated Dave his interest taking a new tack. \"I don't believe I know her.\"  \"I guess you don't,\" Dan replied.  \"She's new in Annapolis.  Visiting her uncle and aunt, you know.  And her mother's with her.\"  \"Are your intentions serious in this, Danny?\" Darrin went on.  \"Blessed if I know,\" Dalzell answered candidly.  \"She's a mighty fine girl, is May Preston.  I don't suppose I'll ever be lucky enough to win the regard of such a really fine girl.\"  \"Then you aren't engaged?\"  \"Hang it, man!  This evening is only the second time that I've met Miss Preston.\"  \"And you've risked your commission to meet a girl for the second time?\" Dave demanded almost unbelievingly.  \"I haven't risked it much,\" Dan answered.  \"I'm in safe, now, and ready to face any discipline officer.\"  \"But wouldn't this matter wait until November, when you're pretty sure to have the privilege of town leave again?\" pressed Midshipman Darrin.  \"By November a girl like Miss Preston might be married to some one else,\" retorted Dan Dalzell.  \"It was a fool risk to take, Dan!\"  \"If you look at it that way.\"  \"Will you promise me not to take the risk again, Danny boy?\"  \"No.\"  \"It's a serious affair, then, so far as you are concerned,\" grinned Dave, though in the dark Dan could not see his face.  \"For your sake, Danny, I hope Miss Preston is as much interested in you as you certainly are in her.\"  \"Are you going to lecture me?\"  \"Not tonight, Dan.\"  \"Then I'm going to get in between sheets.  It's chilly here in the room.\"  \"Duck!\" whispered Dave with sudden energy.  Footsteps could be heard coming down the corridor.  It was a noise like a discipline officer.  Three doors above that of the room occupied by our midshipman friends were opened, one after the other.  Then a hand rested on the knob of the door to Dave and Dan's room.  The door was opened, and the rays of a pocket electric light flashed into the room.  Dan lay on one side, an arm thrown out of bed, his breathing regular but a trifle loud.  Dave Darrin had again found recourse to a snore.  In an instant the door closed.  Any discipline officer ought to be satisfied with what this one had seen.  \"Safe!\" chuckled Dalzell.  \"An awfully close squeak,\" whispered Dave across the intervening room.  \"What if he had started his rounds ten minutes earlier?\"  \"He didn't, though,\" replied Dan contentedly.  Now another set of footsteps passed hurriedly along the \"deck\" outside.  \"What's that?\" questioned a voice sharply.  \"You say that you saw some one entering a room from the upper end of the terrace?\"  \"Oh, by George,\" groaned Dan Dalzell, now beginning to shiver in earnest.  \"Some meddling marine sentry has gone and whispered tales.\"  \"Keep a stiff upper lip,\" Dave whispered hoarsely, encouragingly. \"If the officer returns don't give yourself away by your shaking.\"  \"But if he asks me?\"  \"If you're asked a direct question,\" sighed Dave mournfully, \"you'll have to give a truthful answer.\"  \"And take my medicine!\"  \"Of course.\"  That annoying discipline officer was now on his way back, opening doors once more.  Moreover, the two very wide-awake midshipmen could hear him asking questions in the rooms further along the \"deck.\"  \"He's questioning each man,\" whispered Dave.  \"Of course,\" nodded Dan gloomily.  \"It'll be our turn soon.\"  \"D-D-Dave!\"  \"What?\"  \"I---I'm feeling ill---or I'm going to.\"  \"Don't have cold feet, old fellow.  Take your dose like a man---if you have to.\"  \"D-Dave, I wonder if I couldn't have a real sickness?  Couldn't it be something so you'll have to jump up and help me to hospital? Couldn't I have---a---a fit?\"  \"A midshipman subject to fits would be ordered before a medical board, and then dropped from the brigade,\" Dave replied thoughtfully. \"No; that wouldn't do.\"  That meddling discipline officer was getting closer and closer. Dave and Dan could hear him asking questions in each room that he visited.  And there are no \"white lies\" possible to a midshipman. When questioned he must answer truthfully.  If the officers over him catch him in a lie they will bring him up before a court-martial, and his dismissal from the service will follow.  If the officers don't catch him in a lie, but his brother midshipmen do, they won't report him, but they'll ostracize him and force him to resign. A youngster with the untruthful habit can find no happiness at the Naval Academy.  \"He---he's in the next room now,\" whispered Dan across the few feet of space.  \"Yes,\" returned Dave Darrin despairingly, \"and I can't think of a single, blessed way of getting you out of the scrape.\"  \"Woof!\" sputtered Midshipman Dan Dalzell, which was a brief way of saying, \"Here he comes, now, for our door.\"  Then a hand rested on the knob and the door swung open.  Lieutenant Adams, U.S.N., entered the room.  \"Mr. Darrin, are you awake?\" boomed the discipline officer.  Dave stirred in bed, rolled over so that he could see the lieutenant, and then replied:  \"Yes, sir.\"  \"Rise, Mr. Darrin, and come to attention.\"  Dave got out of bed, but purposely stumbled in doing so.  This might give the impression that he had been actually awakened.  \"Mr. Darrin,\" demanded Lieutenant Adams, \"have you been absent from this room tonight?\"  \"Yes, sir.\"  \"After taps was sounded?\"  \"No, sir.\"  \"You are fully aware of what you have answered?\"  \"Yes, sir.\"  \"Very good.\"  That was all.  A midshipman's word must be taken, for he is a gentleman---that is to say, a man of honor.  \"Mr. Dalzell!\"  Poor Dan stirred uneasily.  \"Mr. Dalzell!\" This time the Naval officer's voice was sharper.  Dan acted as though he were waking with difficulty.  He had no intention, in the face of a direct question, of denying that he had been absent without leave.  But he moved thus slowly, hoping desperately that the few seconds of time thus rained would be sufficient to bring to him some inspiration that might save him.  \"Mr Dalzell, come to attention!\"  Dan stood up, the personification of drowsiness, saluted, then let his right hand fall at his side and stood blinking, bracing for them correct military attitude.  \"It's too bad to disturb the boy!\" thought Lieutenant Adams. \"Surely, this young man hasn't been anywhere but in bed since taps.\""]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12776"],["title","Dave Darrin at Vera Cruz: Fighting with the U.S. Navy in Mexico (#1)"],["body","I have for not courting the activities of the police.\"  It was plain that a fearful, even though brief struggle, took place in the stranger's mind before he made reply to Dave's taunt.  \"I'll find you again, and the next time you shall not get off so easily,\" muttered the other.  \"Depend upon it, I shall see you again!\"  With that the stranger walked toward Broadway.  Smiling, Dave strolled more slowly after him.  By the time the naval ensign reached the corner of that great artery of human life, the stranger had lost himself in the crowds of people that thronged Broadway.  \"If I see him again within twenty-four hours, I think I shall know him,\" laughed Darrin.  \"My first blow put a red welt on his cheek for purposes of identification.\"  Then Darrin finished his walk, turning in at the Allsordia.  Dan Dalzell had also finished his bath, and lounging comfortably in his pajamas, was reading a late edition of the evening newspaper. \"Have any fun?\" asked Ensign Dalzell, glancing up.  \"Just a little bit of a frolic,\" smiled Darrin, and told his chum what had happened.  \"I'm glad you punched the scoundrel,\" flared Danny Grin.  \"I couldn't do anything else,\" Dave answered soberly, \"and if it weren't for the shame of treating a woman in such high-handed fashion as that fellow did, I'd look upon the whole affair as a pleasant diversion.\"  \"So he's going to look for you and find you, then settle up this night's business with you, is he?\" demanded Dalzell, with one of the grins that had made him famous.  \"Humph!  If he finds you after ten o`clock to-morrow morning, it will be aboard one of our biggest battleships and among fifteen hundred fighting men.\"  \"I'm afraid I shall never see him again,\" sighed Dave.  \"It's too bad, too, for I'm not satisfied with the one blow that I had the pleasure of giving him.  I'd like to meet the fellow in a place where I could express and fully back up my opinion of him.\"  \"I wonder if you'll ever meet him again?\" mused Dalzell, aloud.  \"It's not worth wondering about,\" Dave returned.  \"I must get into my bath now.  I'll be out soon.\"  Fifteen minutes later Darrin looked into the room, saying good night to his chum.  Then he retired to his own sleeping room; five minutes later he was sound asleep.  No strangers to our readers are Dave Darrin and Dan Dalzell \"Darry\" and \"Danny Grin,\" as they were known to many of their friends. As members of that famous schoolboy group known as Dick & Co. they were first encountered in the pages of the _\"Grammar School Boys Series.\"_  All our readers are familiar with the careers in sport and adventure that were achieved by those splendid Gridley boys, Dick Prescott, Dave Darrin, Greg Holmes, Dan Dalzell, Tom Reade and Harry Hazelton.  The same boys, a little older and twice as daring, were again found in the pages of the _\"High School Boys Series,\"_ and then immediately afterward in the _\"High School Boys' Vacation Series.\"_  It was in the _\"Dick Prescott Christmas Series\"_ that we found all six of our fine, manly young friends in the full flower of high school boyhood.  A few months after that the six were separated. The further fortunes of Dick Prescott and Greg Holmes are then found in the _\"West Point Series,\"_ while the careers of Darrin and Dalzell are set forth in the _\"Annapolis Series,\"_ just as the adventures of Reade and Hazelton are set forth in the _\"Young Engineers Series.\"_  At Annapolis, Darrin and Dalzell went through stirring times, indeed, as young midshipmen.  Now, we again come upon them when they have become commissioned officers in the Navy.  They are now seen at the outset of their careers as ensigns, ordered to duty aboard the dreadnought \"_Long Island_\" in the latter part of March, 1914.  Certainly the times were favorable for them to see much of active naval service, though as yet they could hardly more than guess the fact.  General Huerta, who had usurped the presidency of Mexico following the death---as suspected, by assassination---of the former president Madero---had not been recognized as president by the United States. Some of Madero's friends and former followers, styling themselves the \"Constitutionalists\" had taken to the field in rebellion against the proclaimed authority of the dictator, Huerta.  The two factions had long fought fiercely, and between the two warring parties that had rapidly reduced life in Mexico, to a state of anarchy, scores of Americans had been executed through spite, as it was alleged, and American women and children had also suffered at the hands of both factions.  Lives and property of citizens of European governments had been sacrificed, and now these European governments looked askance at the Washington government, which was expected to safeguard the rights of foreigners in Mexico.  To the disappointment and even the resentment of a large part of the people of the United States, the Washington government had moved slowly, expressing its hope that right would triumph in Mexico without outside armed interference.  This policy of the national administration had become known as watchful waiting.  Many approved of it; other Americans demanded a policy of active intervention in Mexico to end the uncertainty and the misery caused by the helpless of many nations, who were ground between the opposing factions of revolution in Mexico.  With this brief explanation we will once more turn to the fortunes of Ensigns Dave and Dan.  At 6.45 the next morning the telephone bell began to tinkle in Dave's room.  It continued to ring until Darrin rose, took down the receiver, and expressed, to the clerk, on duty below, his thanks for having been called.  \"Turn out, Danny Grin!\" Darry shouted from the bathroom.  \"Come, now, sir!  Show a foot!  Show a foot, sir!\"  Drowsily, Dalzell thrust one bare foot out from under the sheet.  \"Are you awake in sea-going order, sir?\" Dave asked, jovially.  \"Aye, aye, sir.\"  \"Then remain awake, Mr. Dalzell, until I have been through the motions of a cold bath.\"  With that Darrin shut the door.  From the bathroom came the sounds of a shower, followed by much splashing.  \"Turn out the port watch, Mr. Dalzell,\" came, presently, through the closed bathroom door.  \"The bathroom watch is yours.  Hose down, sir.\"  With that Dave stepped into his own room to dress.  It was not long before the two young naval officers left their rooms, each carrying a suit case.  To the top of each case was strapped a sword, emblem of officer's rank, and encased in chamois-skin.  Going below, the pair breakfasted, glancing, in the meantime, over morning newspapers.  Just before nine-thirty that same morning, our young naval officers, bent on joining their ship, stepped along briskly through the Brooklyn Navy Yard.  It was really an inspiring place.  Sailors, marines and officers, too, were in evidence.  In the machine shops and about the docks thousands of men were performing what once would have passed for the work of giants. Huge pieces of steel were being shaped; heavy drays carried these pieces of steel; monster cranes hoisted them aboard ships lying at the docks or standing shored up in the dry docks.  There was noise in the air; the spirit of work and accomplishment pervaded the place, for word had come from Washington that many ships might soon be needed in Mexican waters.  Eight dreadnoughts lay at their berths.  Even as the boys crossed the great yard a cruiser was being warped in, after an eighteen-thousand mile voyage.  Alongside floating stages in the basins lay submarines and torpedo boat destroyers.  A naval collier was being coaled.  A Navy launch was in sight and coming closer, bearing a draft of marines bound for duty on one of the battleships.  Every sight spoke proudly of the naval might of a great nation, yet that might was not at all in proportion with the naval needs of such a vast country.  \"It does an American good, just to be in a place like this, doesn't it?\" asked Danny Grin.  \"It does, indeed,\" Dave answered.  Then, his bewilderment increasing, he turned to a marine who stood at a distance of some sixty feet from where he had halted.  \"My man!\" Dave called.  Instantly the marine wheeled about.  Noting the suit cases, with the swords strapped to them, the marine recognized these young men in civilian attire as naval officers.  Promptly his hand sought his cap visor in clean-cut salute, which both young ensigns as promptly returned.  \"Be good enough to direct me to the `_Long Island_,'\" Darrin requested.  \"Yes, sir,\" and the marine, stepping closer, led the way past three large buildings.  \"There she is, over there, sir,\" said the marine, a minute later, pointing.  \"Shall I carry your suit cases, sir, to the deck?\"  \"It won't be necessary, thank you,\" Darrin replied.  \"Very good, sir,\" and again the marine saluted.  Returning the salute, the two young officers hurried forward.  As they strode along, their eyes feasting on the strong, proud lines of the dreadnought on which they were to serve, their staunch young hearts swelled with pride.  And there, over the battleship's stern, floated the Flag, which they had taken most solemn oath to defend with their lives and with their honor, whether at home, or on the other side of the world.  In both breasts stirred the same emotions of love of country. Just then neither felt like speaking.  They hastened on in silence. Up the gang-plank they strode.  At a word from the officer on deck, two young sailors, serving as messengers, darted down the plank, saluting, then relieving the young officers of their suit cases.  Up the gang-plank, and aboard, walked the young ensigns.  First the eyes of Ensigns Darrin and Dalzell sought the Flag.  Bringing their heels together, standing erect, they faced the Stars and Stripes, flying at the stern, bringing their hands up smartly in salute.  The officer of the deck returned to the youngsters the salute on behalf of the Flag.  Then Darrin and Dalzell approached the officer of the deck.  \"I am Ensign"]]]
