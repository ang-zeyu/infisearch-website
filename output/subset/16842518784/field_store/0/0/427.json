The boasts of the Colonel remained as yet unproven, but, be that as it may, Betty had, notwithstanding her many faults, endeared herself to all. She made sunshine and happiness everywhere; the old people loved her; the children adored her, and the broad shouldered, heavy footed young settlers were shy and silent, yet blissfully happy in her presence.  \"Betty, will you fill my pipe?\" asked the Colonel, when he had finished his supper and had pulled his big chair nearer the fire. His oldest child, Noah, a sturdy lad of six, climbed upon his knee and plied him with questions.  \"Did you see any bars and bufflers?\" he asked, his eyes large and round.  \"No, my lad, not one.\"  \"How long will it be until I am big enough to go?\"  \"Not for a very long time, Noah.\"  \"But I am not afraid of Betty's bar. He growls at me when I throw sticks at him, and snaps his teeth. Can I go with you next time?\"  \"My brother came over from Short Creek to-day. He has been to Fort Pitt,\" interposed Mrs. Zane. As she was speaking a tap sounded on the door, which, being opened by Betty, disclosed Captain Boggs his daughter Lydia, and Major Samuel McColloch, the brother of Mrs. Zane.  \"Ah, Colonel! I expected to find you at home to-night. The weather has been miserable for hunting and it is not getting any better. The wind is blowing from the northwest and a storm is coming,\" said Captain Boggs, a fine, soldierly looking man.  \"Hello, Captain! How are you? Sam, I have not had the pleasure of seeing you for a long time,\" replied Colonel Zane, as he shook hands with his guests.  Major McColloch was the eldest of the brothers of that name. As an Indian killer he ranked next to the intrepid Wetzel; but while Wetzel preferred to take his chances alone and track the Indians through the untrodden wilds, McColloch was a leader of expeditions against the savages. A giant in stature, massive in build, bronzed and bearded, he looked the typical frontiersman. His blue eyes were like those of his sister and his voice had the same pleasant ring.  \"Major McColloch, do you remember me?\" asked Betty.  \"Indeed I do,\" he answered, with a smile. \"You were a little girl, running wild, on the Potomac when I last saw you!\"  \"Do you remember when you used to lift me on your horse and give me lessons in riding?\"  \"I remember better than you. How you used to stick on the back of that horse was a mystery to me.\"  \"Well, I shall be ready soon to go on with those lessons in riding. I have heard of your wonderful leap over the hill and I should like to have you tell me all about it. Of all the stories I have heard since I arrived at Fort Henry, the one of your ride and leap for life is the most wonderful.\"  \"Yes, Sam, she will bother you to death about that ride, and will try to give you lessons in leaping down precipices. I should not be at all surprised to find her trying to duplicate your feat. You know the Indian pony I got from that fur trader last summer. Well, he is as wild as a deer and she has been riding him without his being broken,\" said Colonel Zane.  \"Some other time I shall tell you about my jump over the hill. Just now I have important matters to discuss,\" answered the Major to Betty.  It was evident that something unusual had occurred, for after chatting a few moments the three men withdrew into the magazine room and conversed in low, earnest tones.  Lydia Boggs was eighteen, fair haired and blue eyed. Like Betty she had received a good education, and, in that respect, was superior to the border girls, who seldom knew more than to keep house and to make linen. At the outbreak of the Indian wars General Clark had stationed Captain Boggs at Fort Henry and Lydia had lived there with him two years. After Betty's arrival, which she hailed with delight, the girls had become fast friends.  Lydia slipped her arm affectionately around Betty's neck and said, \"Why did you not come over to the Fort to-day?\"  \"It has been such an ugly day, so disagreeable altogether, that I have remained indoors.\"  \"You missed something,\" said Lydia, knowingly.  \"What do you mean? What did I miss?\"  \"Oh, perhaps, after all, it will not interest you.\"  \"How provoking! Of course it will. Anything or anybody would interest me to-night. Do tell me, please.\"  \"It isn't much. Only a young soldier came over with Major McColloch.\"  \"A soldier? From Fort Pitt? Do I know him? I have met most of the officers.\"  \"No, you have never seen him. He is a stranger to all of us.\"  \"There does not seem to be so much in your news,\" said Betty, in a disappointed tone. \"To be sure, strangers are a rarity in our little village, but, judging from the strangers who have visited us in the past, I imagine this one cannot be much different.\"  \"Wait until you see him,\" said Lydia, with a serious little nod of her head.  \"Come, tell me all about him,\" said Betty, now much interested.  \"Major McColloch brought him in to see papa, and he was introduced to me. He is a southerner and from one of those old families. I could tell by his cool, easy, almost reckless air. He is handsome, tall and fair, and his face is frank and open. He has such beautiful manners. He bowed low to me and really I felt so embarrassed that I hardly spoke. You know I am used to these big hunters seizing your hand and giving it a squeeze which makes you want to scream. Well, this young man is different. He is a cavalier. All the girls are in love with him already. So will you be.\"  \"I? Indeed not. But how refreshing. You must have been strongly impressed to see and remember all you have told me.\"  \"Betty Zane, I remember so well because he is just the man you described one day when we were building castles and telling each other what kind of a hero we wanted.\"  \"Girls, do not talk such nonsense,\" interrupted the Colonel's wife who was perturbed by the colloquy in the other room. She had seen those ominous signs before. \"Can you find nothing better to talk about?\"  Meanwhile Colonel Zane and his companions were earnestly discussing certain information which had arrived that day. A friendly Indian runner had brought news to Short Creek, a settlement on the river between Fort Henry and Fort Pitt of an intended raid by the Indians all along the Ohio valley. Major McColloch, who had been warned by Wetzel of the fever of unrest among the Indians--a fever which broke out every spring--had gone to Fort Pitt with the hope of bringing back reinforcements, but, excepting the young soldier, who had volunteered to return with him, no help could he enlist, so he journeyed back post-haste to Fort Henry.  The information he brought disturbed Captain Boggs, who commanded the garrison, as a number of men were away on a logging expedition up the river, and were not expected to raft down to the Fort for two weeks.  Jonathan Zane, who had been sent for, joined the trio at this moment, and was acquainted with the particulars. The Zane brothers were always consulted where any question concerning Indian craft and cunning was to be decided. Colonel Zane had a strong friendly influence with certain tribes, and his advice was invaluable. Jonathan Zane hated the sight of an Indian and except for his knowledge as a scout, or Indian tracker or fighter, he was of little use in a council. Colonel Zane informed the men of the fact that Wetzel and he had discovered Indian tracks within ten miles of the Fort, and he dwelt particularly on the disappearance of Wetzel.  \"Now, you can depend on what I say. There are Wyandots in force on the war path. Wetzel told me to dig for the Fort and he left me in a hurry. We were near that cranberry bog over at the foot of Bald mountain. I do not believe we shall be attacked. In my opinion the Indians would come up from the west and keep to the high ridges along Yellow creek. They always come that way. But of course, it is best to know surely, and I daresay Lew will come in to-night or to-morrow with the facts. In the meantime put out some scouts back in the woods and let Jonathan and the Major watch the river.\"  \"I hope Wetzel will come in,\" said the Major. \"We can trust him to know more about the Indians than any one. It was a week before you and he went hunting that I saw him. I went to Fort Pitt and tried to bring over some men, but the garrison is short and they need men as much as we do. A young soldier named Clarke volunteered to come and I brought him along with me. He has not seen any Indian fighting, but he is a likely looking chap, and I guess will do. Captain Boggs will give him a place in the block house if you say so.\"  \"By all means. We shall be glad to have him,\" said Colonel Zane.  \"It would not be so serious if I had not sent the men up the river,\" said Captain Boggs, in anxious tones. \"Do you think it possible they might have fallen in with the Indians?\"  \"It is possible, of course, but not probable,\" answered Colonel Zane. \"The Indians are all across the Ohio. Wetzel is over there and he will get here long before they do.\"  \"I hope it may be as you say. I have much confidence in your judgment,\" returned Captain Boggs. \"I shall put out scouts and take all the precaution possible. We must return now. Come, Lydia.\"  \"Whew! What an awful night this is going to be,\" said Colonel Zane, when he had closed the door after his guests' departure. \"I should not care to sleep out to-night.\"  \"Eb, what will Lew Wetzel do on a night like this?\" asked Betty, curiously.  \"Oh, Lew will be as snug as a rabbit in his burrow,\" said Colonel Zane, laughing. \"In a few moments he can build a birch bark shack, start a fire inside and go to sleep comfortably.\"  \"Ebenezer, what is all this confab about? What did my brother tell you?\" asked Mrs. Zane, anxiously.  \"We are in for more trouble from the Wyandots and Shawnees. But, Bessie, I don't believe it will come soon. We are too well protected here for anything but a protracted siege.\"  Colonel Zane's light and rather evasive answer did not deceive his wife."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1262"],["title","The Heritage of the Desert: A Novel (#1)"],["body","be fatal. You're in sight from the camp-fire, but indistinct. By-and-by the outlaws will get here, and if any of them prowl around close, you and Mescal must pretend to be sweethearts. Understand? They'll pass by Mormon love-making without a second look. Now, lad, courage... Mescal, it may save his life.”  Naab returned to the fire, his shadow looming in gigantic proportions on the white canopy of a covered wagon. Fitful gusts of wind fretted the blaze; it roared and crackled and sputtered, now illuminating the still forms, then enveloping them in fantastic obscurity. Hare shivered, perhaps from the cold air, perhaps from growing dread. Westward lay the desert, an impenetrable black void; in front, the gloomy mountain wall lifted jagged peaks close to the stars; to the right rose the ridge, the rocks and stunted cedars of its summit standing in weird relief. Suddenly Hare's fugitive glance descried a dark object; he watched intently as it moved and rose from behind the summit of the ridge to make a bold black figure silhouetted against the cold clearness of sky. He saw it distinctly, realized it was close, and breathed hard as the wind-swept mane and tail, the lean, wild shape and single plume resolved themselves into the unmistakable outline of an Indian mustang and rider.  “Look!” he whispered to the girl. “See, a mounted Indian, there on the ridge--there, he's gone--no, I see him again. But that's another. Look! there are more.” He ceased in breathless suspense and stared fearfully at a line of mounted Indians moving in single file over the ridge to become lost to view in the intervening blackness. A faint rattling of gravel and the peculiar crack of unshod hoof on stone gave reality to that shadowy train.  “Navajos,” said Mescal.  “Navajos!” he echoed. “I heard of them at Lund; 'desert hawks' the men called them, worse than Piutes. Must we not alarm the men?--You--aren't you afraid?  “No.”  “But they are hostile.”  “Not to him.” She pointed at the stalwart figure standing against the firelight.  “Ah! I remember. The man Cole spoke of friendly Navajos. They must be close by. What does it mean?”  “I'm not sure. I think they are out there in the cedars, waiting.”  “Waiting! For what?”  “Perhaps for a signal.”  “Then they were expected?”  “I don't know; I only guess. We used to ride often to White Sage and Lund; now we go seldom, and when we do there seem to be Navajos near the camp at night, and riding the ridges by day. I believe Father Naab knows.”  “Your father's risking much for me. He's good. I wish I could show my gratitude.”  “I call him Father Naab, but he is not my father.”  “A niece or granddaughter, then?”  “I'm no relation. Father Naab raised me in his family. My mother was a Navajo, my father a Spaniard.”  “Why!” exclaimed Hare. “When you came out of the wagon I took you for an Indian girl. But the moment you spoke--you talk so well--no one would dream--”  “Mormons are well educated and teach the children they raise,” she said, as he paused in embarrassment.  He wanted to ask if she were a Mormon by religion, but the question seemed curious and unnecessary. His interest was aroused; he realized suddenly that he had found pleasure in her low voice; it was new and strange, unlike any woman's voice he had ever heard; and he regarded her closely. He had only time for a glance at her straight, clean-cut profile, when she turned startled eyes on him, eyes black as the night. And they were eyes that looked through and beyond him. She held up a hand, slowly bent toward the wind, and whispered:  “Listen.”  Hare heard nothing save the barking of coyotes and the breeze in the sage. He saw, however, the men rise from round the camp-fire to face the north, and the women climb into the wagon, and close the canvas flaps. And he prepared himself, with what fortitude he could command for the approach of the outlaws. He waited, straining to catch a sound. His heart throbbed audibly, like a muffled drum, and for an endless moment his ears seemed deadened to aught else. Then a stronger puff of wind whipped in, banging the rhythmic beat of flying hoofs. Suspense ended. Hare felt the easing of a weight upon him. Whatever was to be his fate, it would be soon decided. The sound grew into a clattering roar. A black mass hurled itself over the border of opaque circle, plunged into the light, and halted.  August Naab deliberately threw a bundle of grease-wood upon the camp- fire. A blaze leaped up, sending abroad a red flare. “Who comes?” he called.  “Friends, Mormons, friends,” was the answer.  “Get down--friends--and come to the fire.”  Three horsemen advanced to the foreground; others, a troop of eight or ten, remained in the shadow, a silent group.  Hare sank back against the stone. He knew the foremost of those horsemen though he had never seen him.  “Dene,” whispered Mescal, and confirmed his instinctive fear.  Hare was nervously alive to the handsome presence of the outlaw. Glimpses that he had caught of “bad” men returned vividly as he noted the clean-shaven face, the youthful, supple body, the cool, careless mien. Dene's eyes glittered as he pulled off his gauntlets and beat the sand out of them; and but for that quick fierce glance his leisurely friendly manner would have disarmed suspicion.  “Are you the Mormon Naab?” he queried.  “August Naab, I am.”  “Dry camp, eh? Hosses tired, I reckon. Shore it's a sandy trail. Where's the rest of you fellers?”  “Cole and his men were in a hurry to make White Sage to-night. They were travelling light; I've heavy wagons.”  “Naab, I reckon you shore wouldn't tell a lie?”  “I have never lied.”  “Heerd of a young feller thet was in Lund--pale chap--lunger, we'd call him back West?”  “I heard that he had been mistaken for a spy at Lund and had fled toward Bane.”  “Hadn't seen nothin' of him this side of Lund?”  “No.”  “Seen any Navvies?”  “Yes.”  The outlaw stared hard at him. Apparently he was about to speak of the Navajos, for his quick uplift of head at Naab's blunt affirmative suggested the impulse. But he checked himself and slowly drew on his gloves.  “Naab, I'm shore comin' to visit you some day. Never been over thet range. Heerd you hed fine water, fine cattle. An' say, I seen thet little Navajo girl you have, an' I wouldn't mind seein' her again.”  August Naab kicked the fire into brighter blaze. “Yes fine range,” he presently replied, his gaze fixed on Dene. “Fine water, fine cattle, fine browse. I've a fine graveyard, too; thirty graves, and not one a woman's. Fine place for graves, the canyon country. You don't have to dig. There's one grave the Indians never named; it's three thousand feet deep.”  “Thet must be in hell,” replied Dene, with a smile, ignoring the covert meaning. He leisurely surveyed Naab's four sons, the wagons and horses, till his eye fell upon Hare and Mescal. With that he swung in his saddle as if to dismount.  “I shore want a look around.”  “Get down, get down,” returned the Mormon. The deep voice, unwelcoming, vibrant with an odd ring, would have struck a less suspicious man than Dene. The outlaw wrung his leg back over the pommel, sagged in the saddle, and appeared to be pondering the question. Plainly he was uncertain of his ground. But his indecision was brief.  “Two-Spot, you look 'em over,” he ordered.  The third horseman dismounted and went toward the wagons.  Hare, watching this scene, became conscious that his fear had intensified with the recognition of Two-Spot as Chance, the outlaw whom he would not soon forget. In his excitement he moved against Mescal and felt her trembling violently.  “Are you afraid?” he whispered.  “Yes, of Dene.”  The outlaw rummaged in one of the wagons, pulled aside the canvas flaps of the other, laughed harshly, and then with clinking spurs tramped through the camp, kicking the beds, overturning a pile of saddles, and making disorder generally, till he spied the couple sitting on the stone in the shadow.  As the outlaw lurched that way, Hare, with a start of recollection, took Mescal in his arms and leaned his head against hers. He felt one of her hands lightly brush his shoulder and rest there, trembling.  Shuffling footsteps scraped the sand, sounded nearer and nearer, slowed and paused.  “Sparkin'! Dead to the world. Ham! Haw! Haw!”  The coarse laugh gave place to moving footsteps. The rattling clink of stirrup and spur mingled with the restless stamp of horse. Chance had mounted. Dene's voice drawled out: “Good-bye, Naab, I shore will see you all some day.” The heavy thuds of many hoofs evened into a roar that diminished as it rushed away.  In unutterable relief Hare realized his deliverance. He tried to rise, but power of movement had gone from him.  He was fainting, yet his sensations were singularly acute. Mescal's hand dropped from his shoulder; her cheek, that had been cold against his, grew hot; she quivered through all her slender length. Confusion claimed his senses. Gratitude and hope flooded his soul. Something sweet and beautiful, the touch of this desert girl, rioted in his blood; his heart swelled in exquisite agony. Then he was whirling in darkness; and he knew no more.       II. WHITE SAGE  THE night was as a blank to Hare; the morning like a drifting of hazy clouds before his eyes. He felt himself moving; and when he awakened clearly to consciousness he lay upon a couch on the vine-covered porch of a cottage. He saw August Naab open a garden gate to admit Martin Cole. They met as friends; no trace of scorn marred August's greeting, and Martin was not the same man who had shown fear on the desert. His welcome was one of respectful regard for his superior.  “Elder, I heard you were safe in,” he said, fervently. “We feared--I know not what. I was distressed till I got the news of your arrival. How's the young man?”  “He's very ill. But while there's life there's hope.”  “Will the Bishop administer to him?”  “Gladly, if the young man's willing. Come, let's go in.”  “Wait, August,” said"]]]
