The way to regenerate society is to start on the individual.  The law of influence through personal contact is too tremendous to be grasped. You influence one man and you have influenced a group of men, and then a group around each man of the group, and so on endlessly. Hand-picked fruit gets the first and best market. The keenest marksmen are picked out for the sharpshooters' corps.    The True Source of Strong Service.   One morning with a friend I walked out of the city of Geneva to where the waters of the lake flow with swift rush into the Rhone. And we were both greatly interested in the strange sight which has impressed so many travellers. There are two rivers whose waters come together here, the Rhone and the Arve, the Arve flowing into the Rhone. The waters of the Rhone are beautifully clear and sparkling. The waters of the Arve come through a clayey soil and are muddy, gray, and dull. And for a long distance the two waters are wholly distinct. Two rivers of water are in one river-bed, on one side the sparkling blue Rhone water, on the other the dull gray Arve water, and the line between the two sharply defined. And so it continues for a long distance. Then gradually they blend and the gray begins to tinge all through the blue.  I went to the guide-book and maps to find out something about this river that kept on its way undefiled by its neighbor for so long. Its source is in a glacier that is between ten thousand and eleven thousand feet high, descending \"from the gates of eternal night, at the foot of the pillar of the sun.\" It is fed continually by the melting glacier which, in turn, is being kept up by the snows and cold. Rising at this great height, ever being renewed steadily by the glacier, it comes rushing down the swift descent of the Swiss Alps through the lake of Geneva and on. There is the secret of purity, side by side with its dirty neighbor.  Our lives must have their source high up in the mountains of God, fed by a ceaseless supply. Only so can there be the purity, and the momentum that shall keep us pure, and keep us _moving_ down in contact with men of the earth. And we must keep closer to the source than is the Rhone at Geneva, else the streams flowing alongside will unduly influence us. Constant personal contact with Jesus is the beginning ever new of service.     The Triple Life: The Perspective of Service.        On An Errand for Jesus.     The Parting Message.     A Secret Life of Prayer.     An Open Life of Purity.     An Active Life of Service.     The Perspective of True Service.     A Long Time Coming.     The Triple Life: The Perspective of Service.  (Luke ix:1-6; x:1-3, 17; John xx:19-23; Matthew xxviii:18-20.)    On An Errand for Jesus.   You remember there were four times that Jesus picked out a group of men, and sent them on a special errand. About the middle of the second year of His public life, He chose out twelve men and commissioned them for a special bit of work. Six months before the tragic end, He chose seventy others and sent them out in twos into all the places He was planning to visit Himself. It was a remarkable campaign for carrying the news which He was preaching into all the villages of that whole country through which His journey south lay.  Then the evening of that never-to-be-forgotten resurrection day, under wholly changed conditions, He again commissions ten men of that first twelve. Things had radically changed with Jesus. And there had been a bad break in the loyalty of these men. Two of their number are absent. Judas has gone to his own place, and Thomas was not there that evening. His absence cost him a week of doubting and mental distress. Ten of the old inner circle are commissioned anew. And then do you remember the last time they were together? It was about six weeks later, on the rounded top of the old Olives Mount, the eleven men with the Master. Four times He commissioned a group of men for some service He wanted done.  There are two things in these four commissions that make them alike. The same two things are in each. The first thing is this: they are bidden to \"go.\" That ringing word \"go ye\" is in, each time. \"As the Father hath sent Me even so send I you.\" It is a familiar word to every follower of Jesus then, and now, and always. A true follower of His always is stirred by a spirit of _\"go.\"_ A going Christian is a growing Christian. A going church has always been a growing church. Those ages when the church lost the vision of her Master's face on Olives, and let other sounds crowd out of her ears the sound of His voice, were stagnant ages. They are commonly spoken of in history as the dark ages. \"Go\" is the ringing keynote of the Christian life, whether in a man or in the church.  The second thing found always in each of these commissions is this: they were qualified, or empowered to go. Whom God calls He always qualifies. Where His voice comes His Spirit breathes. If there has come to you some bit of a call to service, to teach a class, or write a special letter, or speak a word, or take up something needing to be done. And you hesitate. You think that you cannot. You are not fit, you think, not qualified. The thing to do is to do it.  If the call is clear go ahead. Need is one of the strong calling voices of God. It is always safe to respond. Put _out_ your foot in the answering swing, even though you cannot see clearly the place to put it _down_. God attends to that part. Power comes _as we go_.    The Parting Message.   Just now I want to talk with you a bit about the last one of these commissions, the Olivet commission. I do not know just what day it was given or at what hour. But I have thought it was in the twilight of a Sabbath evening. There's a yellow glow of light filling all the western sky running along the broken line of those hills yonder, and through the trees, and in upon this group of men standing.  Here in full view lies little Bethany fragrant with memories of Jesus' power. Over yonder, those tree tops down in a bit of valley with the brook--that is _Gethsemane_. And farther over there is the fortress city of _Jerusalem_. And just outside its wall is the bit of a knoll called _Calvary_. Here under these trees every night that last week of the tragedy Jesus had slept out in the open, with His seamless coat wrapped about Him. This is the spot He chooses for the good-by word. It is full of most precious, fragrant memories.  Here is the man who has been Simon, but out of whom a new man was coming these days, Peter, the man of rock. And here are John and James, sons of fire and of thunder, sons of their mother. And there, little Scotch Andrew. At least our Scotch friends seem to have adopted him as their very own. And close by his side is his friend with the Greek name, Philip. And here the man to whom Jesus paid the great tribute of naming him the guileless man.  And the others, not so well known to us, but very well known to Jesus, and to be not a whit less faithful than their brothers these coming days. But somehow as you look you are at once irresistibly drawn past these to _Him_--the Man in the midst. The Man with the great face, torn with the thorns, and cut with the thongs, but shining with a sweet, wondrous, beauty light.  It is the last time they are together. He is going away; coming back soon, they understand. They do not know just how soon. But meanwhile in His absence they are to be as He Himself would be if He remained among men. They are to stand for Him. And so with eyes fixed on His face they look, and listen, and wonder a bit, just what the last word will be.  What would you expect it to be? It was the good-by word between men who were lovers, dearest friends. The tenderest thing would be said and the most important. The one going away would speak of that which lay closest down in His own heart. And whatever He might say would sink deepest into their hearts, and control their action in the after days.  He had been talking to them very insistently, about an hour before, down in the city, about _waiting there_ until the Holy Spirit came upon them. And that word has fastened itself into their minds with newly sharpened hooks of steel points. Now He talks about their being His witnesses, here at home among their own folks, and out among their half-breed Samaritan neighbors, whom they didn't like, and then--with eyes looking yearningly out and finger pointing steadily out--to the farthest reach of the planet. And now, as He is about to go, this is the word that comes from those lips:      \"All power hath been given unto Me.       Therefore go ye,     And make disciples of all nations.\"    A Secret Life of Prayer.   There are four things in that good-by word. Three are directly spoken, and one is not spoken, but directly implied. First is this, your chief work is to win men. That is directly said. The second is implied--it is the toughest task you ever undertook. That is implied in this that it will take more power than they have. A power that only He has. A supernatural power. And we all know how true that is. Of all luggage man is the hardest to move. He _won't_ move unless he _will_. Every man of us that has ever tried to change somebody's else purpose knows how impossible it is unless by the inward pull. You simply _cannot_ without the man's consent. The third thing is this: I have all the power needed. The fourth this: _You_ go.  And the Master meant to tell them, and to tell us, this: that a man should lead a triple life, three lives in one. We sometimes hear of a man leading a double life in a bad sense. In a good sense, every one of us should be living a triple life, three distinct lives in one. The first of these three lives is this: _a secret life, lived with Jesus, hidden from the eyes of men_. An inner life of closest contact with Him, that the outside folks know nothing about.  Notice again the four statements in that good-by word.

You don't think any of these Union generals here in the East can whip our Lee, do you?\"  \"Of course not!\" said Happy Tom.  \"Besides, Lee has me to help him.\"  \"How are Colonel Talbot and Lieutenant-Colonel St. Hilaire?\" asked Harry.  \"Sound asleep, both of 'em,\" replied St. Clair.  \"And it's a strange thing, too.  They were sitting in a wagon, having resumed that game of chess which they began in the Valley of Virginia, but they were so exhausted that both fell sound asleep while playing.  They are sitting upright, as they sleep, and Lieutenant-Colonel St. Hilaire's thumb and forefinger rest upon a white pawn that he intended to move.\"  \"I hope they won't be jarred out of their rest and that they'll sleep on,\" said Harry.  \"Nobody deserves it more.\"  He waved a hand to his friends and continued his ride toward the rear. The column passed slowly on in silence.  Now and then gusts of rain lashed across his face, but he liked the feeling.  It was a fillip to his blood, and his nerves began to recover from the tremendous strain and excitement of the last four days.  Obeying his orders he rode almost directly back toward the field of Gettysburg from which the Southern forces were still marching.  A friendly voice from a little wood hailed him, and he recognized it at once as that of Sherburne, who sat his horse alone among the trees.  \"Come here, Harry,\" he said.  \"Glad to find you alive, Sherburne.  Where's your troop?\"  \"What's left of it is on ahead.  I'll join the men in a few minutes. But look back there!\"  Harry from the knoll, which was higher than he had thought, gazed upon a vast and dusky panorama.  Once more the field of Gettysburg swam before him, not now in fire and smoke, but in vapors and misty rain. When he shut his eyes he saw again the great armies charging on the slopes, the blazing fire from hundreds of cannon and a hundred thousand rifles. There, too, went Pickett's brigades, devoted to death but never flinching.  A sob burst from his throat, and he opened his eyes again.  \"You feel about it as I do,\" said Sherburne.  \"We'll never come back into the North.\"  \"It isn't merely a feeling within me, I know it.\"  \"So do I, but we can still hold Virginia.\"  \"I think so, too.  Come, we'd better turn.  There goes the field of Gettysburg.  The rain and mist have blotted it out.\"  The panorama, the most terrible upon which Harry had ever looked, vanished in the darkness.  The two rode slowly from the knoll and into the road.  \"It will be daylight in an hour,\" said Sherburne, \"and by that time the last of our men will be gone.\"  \"And I must hasten to our commander-in-chief,\" said Harry.  \"How is he?\" asked Sherburne.  \"Does he seem downcast?\"  \"No, he holds his head as high as ever, and cheers the men.  They say that Pickett's charge was a glorious mistake, but he takes all the blame for it, if there is any.  He doesn't criticize any of his generals.\"  \"Only a man of the greatest moral grandeur could act like that.  It's because of such things that our people, boys, officers and all, will follow him to the death.\"  \"Good-by, Sherburne,\" said Harry.  \"Hope I'll see you again soon.\"  He urged his horse into a faster gait, anxious to overtake Lee and report that all was well with the rear guard.  He noticed once more, and with the greatest care that long line of the wounded and the unwounded, winding sixteen miles across the hills from Gettysburg to Chambersburg, and his mind was full of grave thoughts.  More than two years in the very thick of the greatest war, then known, were sufficient to make a boy a man, at least in intellect and responsibility.  Harry saw very clearly, as he rode beside the retreating but valiant army that had failed in its great attempt, that their role would be the defensive.  For a little while he was sunk in deep depression.  Then invincible youth conquered anew, and hope sprang up again.  The night was at the darkest, but dawn was not far away.  Fugitive gusts of wind drenched him once more, but he did not mind it, nor did he pay any attention to the occasional growl of a distant gun.  He was strong in the belief that Meade would not pursue--at least not yet.  A general who had just lost nearly one-third of his own army was not in much condition to follow his enemy.  He urged his horse to increased speed, and pressed on toward the head of the column.  The rain ceased and cool puffs of wind came out of the east. Then the blackness there turned to gray, which soon deepened into silver. Through the silver veil shot a bolt of red fire, and the sun came over the hills.  Although the green world had been touched with brown by the hot sun of July it looked fresh and beautiful to Harry.  The brown in the morning sunlight was a rosy red, and the winds of dawn were charged with life. His horse, too, felt the change and it was easy now to force him into a gallop toward a fire on a low hill, which Harry felt sure had been built to cook breakfast for their great commander.  As he approached he saw Lee and his generals standing before the blaze, some eating, and others drinking.  An orderly, near by, held the commander's famous horse, Traveller, and two or three horses belonging to the other generals were trying to find a little grass between the stony outcrops of the hills.  Harry felt an overwhelming curiosity, but he kept it in restraint, dismounting at a little distance, and approaching on foot.  He could not observe much change in the general's appearance.  His handsome gray suit was as neat as ever, and the three stars, the only marks of his rank that he wore, shone untarnished upon his collar. The dignified and cheerful manner that marked him before Gettysburg marked him also afterward.  To Harry, so young and so thoroughly charged with the emotions of his time and section, he was a figure to be approached with veneration.  He saw the stalwart and bearded Longstreet and other generals whom he knew, among them the brilliant Stuart in his brilliant plumage, but rather quiet and subdued in manner now, since he had not come to Gettysburg as soon as he was needed.  Harry hung back a little, fearing lest he might be regarded as thrusting himself into a company so much his superior in rank, but Lee saw him and beckoned to him.  \"I sent you back toward Gettysburg to report on our withdrawal, Lieutenant Kenton,\" he said.  \"Yes, sir.  I returned all the way to the field.  The last of our troops should be leaving there just about now.  The Northern army had made no preparation for immediate pursuit.\"  \"Your report agrees with all the others that I have received.  How long have you been without sleep?\"  \"I don't know, sir,\" he said at last.  \"I can't remember.  Maybe it has been two or three days.\"  Stuart, who held a cup of coffee in his hand, laughed.  \"The times have been such that there are generals as well as lieutenants,\" he said, \"who can't remember when they've slept.\"  \"You're exhausted, my lad,\" said Lee gravely and kindly, \"and there's nothing more you can do for us just now.  Take some breakfast with us, and then you must sleep in one of the wagons.  An orderly will look after your horse.\"  Lee handed him a cup of coffee with his own hand, and Harry, thanking him, withdrew to the outer fringe of the little group, where he took his breakfast, amazed to find how hungry he was, although he had not thought of food before.  Then without a word, as he saw that the generals were engrossed in a conference, he withdrew.  \"You'll find Lieutenant Dalton of the staff in the covered wagon over there,\" said the orderly who had taken his horse.  \"The general sent him to it more'n two hours ago.\"  \"Then I'll be inside it in less than two minutes,\" said Harry.  But with rest in sight he collapsed suddenly.  His head fell forward of its own weight.  His feet became lead.  Everything swam before his eyes. He felt that he must sleep or die.  But he managed to drag himself to the wagon and climbed inside.  Dalton lay in the center of it so sound asleep that he was like one dead.  Harry rolled him to one side, making room for himself, and lay down beside him.  Then his eyes closed, and he, too, slept so soundly that he also looked like one dead.  He was awakened by Dalton pulling at him.  The young Virginian was sitting up and looking at Harry with curiosity.  He clapped his hands when the Kentuckian opened his eyes.  \"Now I know that you're not dead,\" he said.  \"When I woke up and found you lying beside me I thought they had just put your body in here for safekeeping.  As that's not the case, kindly explain to me and at once what you're doing in my wagon.\"  \"I'm waking up just at present, but for an hour or two before that I was sleeping.\"  \"Hour or two?  Hour or two?  Hear him!  An orderly who I know is no liar told me that you got in here just after dawn.  Now kindly lift that canvasflap, look out and tell me what you see.\"  Harry did as he was told, and was amazed.  The same rolling landscape still met his eyes, and the sun was just about as high in the sky as it was when he had climbed into the wagon.  But it was in the west now instead of the east.  \"See and know, young man!\" said Dalton, paternally.  \"The entire day has elapsed and here you have lain in ignorant slumber, careless of everything, reckless of what might happen to the army.  For twelve hours General Lee has been without your advice, and how, lacking it, he has got this far, Heaven alone knows.\"  \"It seems that he's pulled through, and, since I'm now awake, you can hurry to him and tell him I'm ready to furnish the right plans to stop the forthcoming Yankee invasion.\"  \"They'll keep another day, but we've certainly had a good sleep, Harry.\"  \"Yes, a provision or ammunition wagon isn't a bad place for a wornout soldier.  I remember I slept in another such as this in the Valley of Virginia, when we were with Jackson.\"  He stopped suddenly and choked.  He could not mention the name of "]]]
