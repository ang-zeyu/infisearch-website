But fortune favours the brave.  The adventurous juvenile rushed down the path, shot like an arrow through the doorway, and the next instant was seen ploughing up the snow in the playground, and eventually disappearing head first into the middle of a big drift.  His companions all rushed down in a body to haul him out of the snow. Acton smacked him on the back, and called him a trump; while Jack Vance presented him on the spot with a mince-pie, which had been slightly damaged in one of the donor's many tumbles, but was, as he remarked, \"just as good as new for eating.\"  From that moment until the day he left there was never a more popular boy at The Birches than Diggory Trevanock.  \"I say,\" remarked Mugford, as they met a short time later in the cloak-room, \"that was awfully good of you to go down the slide instead of me; what ever made you do it?\"  \"Well,\" answered the other calmly, \"I thought it would save me a lot of bother if I showed you fellows at once that I wasn't a muff.  I don't mind telling you I was in rather a funk when it came to the start; but I'd said I'd do it, and of course I couldn't draw back.\"  The numerous stirring events which happened at The Birches during the next three terms, and which it will be my pleasing duty to chronicle in subsequent chapters, gave the boys plenty of opportunity of testing the character of their new companion, or, in plainer English, of finding out the stuff he was made of; and whatever his other faults may have been, this at least is certain, that no one ever found occasion to charge Diggory Trevanock with being either a muff or a coward.  One might have thought that the slide episode would have afforded excitement enough for a new boy's first day at school; yet before it closed he was destined to be mixed up in an adventure of a still more thrilling character.  The Birches was an old house, and though its outward appearance was modern enough, the interior impressed even youthful minds with a feeling of reverence for its age.  The heavy timbers, the queer shape of some of the bedrooms and attics, the narrow, crooked passages, and the little unexpected flights of stairs, were all things belonging to a bygone age, of which the pupils were secretly proud, and which caused them to remember the place, and think of it at the time, as being in some way different from an ordinary school.  \"I say, Diggy,\" exclaimed Jack Vance, addressing the new boy by the friendly abbreviation, which seemed by mutual consent to have been bestowed upon him in recognition of his daring exploit--\"I say, Diggy, you're in my bedroom: there's you, and me, and Mugford.  Mug's an awful chump, but he's a good-natured old duffer, and you and I'll do the fighting.\"  \"What do you mean?\"  \"Why, sometimes when Blake is out spending the evening, and old Welsby is shut up in his library, the different rooms make raids on one another.  It began the term before last.  Blake had been teaching us all about how the Crusaders used to go out every now and then and make war in Palestine, and so the fellows on the west side of the house called themselves the Crusaders, and we were Infidels, and they'd come over and rag us, and we should drive them back.  Miss Eleanor came up one night, and caught us in the middle of a battle.  O Diggy, she is a trump! Blake asked her next day before us all which boys had been out on the landing, because he meant to punish them; and she laughed, and said: 'I'm sure I can't tell you.  Why, when I saw they were all in their night-shirts, I shut my eyes at once!'  Of course it was all an excuse for not giving us away.  She doesn't mind seeing chaps in their night-shirts when they're ill, we all know that; and once or twice when for some reason or other she told us on the quiet that there mustn't be any disturbance that evening, no one ever went crusading-- Acton would have licked them if they had.  Acton's going to propose to Miss Eleanor some day, he told us so, and--\"  \"But what about the bedrooms?\" interrupted Diggory; \"have you given up having crusades?\"  \"Yes, but we have other things instead.  We call our rooms by different names, and it's all against all; one lot come and make a raid on you, and then you go and pay them out.  This term Kennedy and Jacobs sleep in the room above ours, and next to the big attic.  They're always reading sea stories, and they call their room the 'Main-top,' because it's so high up.  Then at the end of the passage are Acton, Shaw, and Morris, and they're the 'House of Lords;' and next to them is the 'Dogs' Home,' where all the other fellows are put.\"  A few hours later Diggory and his two room-mates were standing at the foot of their beds and discussing the formation of a few simple rules for conducting a race in undressing, the last man to put the candle out.  \"You needn't bother to race,\" said Mugford; \"I'll do it--I'm sure to be the last.\"  \"No, you aren't,\" answered Vance.  \"We'll give you coat and waistcoat start; it'll be good fun--\"  At this moment the door was suddenly flung open, two half-dressed figures sprang into the room, and discharged a couple of snowballs point-blank at its occupants.  One of the missiles struck Diggory on the shoulder, and the other struck Mugford fair and square on the side of the head, the fragments flying all over the floor.  There was a subdued yell of triumph, the door was slammed to with a bang, and the muffled sound of stockinged feet thudding up the neighbouring staircase showed that the enemy were in full retreat.  \"It's those confounded Main-top men!\" cried Jack Vance; \"I will pay them out.  I wonder where the fellows got the snow from?\"  \"Oh, I expect they opened the window and took it off the ledge,\" answered Diggory.  \"Look here--let's sweep it up into this piece of paper before it melts.\"  This having been done, the three friends hastily threw off their clothes and scrambled into bed, forgetting all about the proposed race in their eagerness to form some plan for an immediate retaliation on the occupants of the \"Main-top.\"  \"I wonder if they'll hear anything of the ghost again this term?\" said Mugford,  \"What ghost?\" asked Diggory.  \"Oh, it's nothing really,\" answered Vance; \"only somebody said once that the house is haunted, and Kennedy and Jacobs say the ghost must be in the big attic next their room.  They hear such queer noises sometimes that they both go under the bed-clothes.\"  \"Do they always do that?\"  \"Yes, so they say, whenever there is a row.\"  \"Well, then,\" said Diggory, \"I'll tell you what we'll do: we'll go very quietly up into that attic, and groan and knock on the wall until you think they've both got their heads well under the clothes, and then we'll rush in and bag their pillows, or drag them out of bed, or something of that sort.  You aren't afraid to go into the attic, are you?\" he continued, seeing that the others hesitated.  \"Why, of course there are no such things as ghosts.  Or, look here, I'll go in, and you can wait outside.\"  \"N--no, I don't mind,\" answered Vance; \"and it'll be an awful lark catching them with their heads under the clothes.\"  \"All right, then, let's do it; though I suppose we'd better wait till every one's in bed.\"  The last suggestion was agreed upon, and the three friends lay talking in an undertone until the sound of footsteps and the gleam of a candle above the door announced the fact that Mr. Blake was retiring to rest.  \"He's always last,\" said Vance; \"we must give him time to undress, and then we'll start.\"  A quarter of an hour later the three boys, in semi-undress, were creeping in single file up the narrow staircase.  \"Be careful,\" whispered Vance; \"there are several loose boards, and they crack like anything.\"  The small landing was reached in safety, and the moon, shining faintly through a little skylight formed of a single pane of glass, enabled them to distinguish the outline of two doors.  Now it was a very different matter, when lying warm and snug in bed, to talk about acting the ghost, from what it was, when standing shivering in the cold and darkness, to put the project into execution.  During the period of waiting the conversation had turned on haunted houses, and no one seemed particularly anxious to claim as it were the post of honour, and be the first to enter the big attic.  \"Go on!\" whispered Mugford, nudging Vance.  \"Go on!\" repeated the latter, giving Diggory's arm a gentle push.  The new boy had certainly undertaken to play the part of the ghost, and there was no excuse for his backing out of it at the last moment.  \"All right,\" he muttered, \"I'll go.\"  Just then a terrible thing happened.  Diggory clutched the door-knob as though it were the handle of a galvanic battery, while Mugford and Vance seized each other by the arm and literally gasped for breath.  The stillness had been broken by a slight sound, as of something falling inside the attic, and this was followed a moment later by a shrill, unearthly scream.  For five seconds the three companions stood petrified with horror, not daring to move; then followed another scream, if anything more horrible than the last, and accompanied this time by the clanking rattle of a chain being dragged across the floor.  That was enough.  Talk about a _sauve qui peut_! the wonder is that any one survived the stampede which followed.  The youngsters turned and flew down the stairs at break-neck speed, and hardly had they started when the door of the \"Main-top\" was flung open, and its two occupants rushed down after them.  As though to ensure the retreat being nothing less than a regular rout, Mugford, who was leading, missed his footing on the last step, causing every one to fall over him in turn, until all five boys"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10027"],["title","The Triple Alliance, Its Trials and Triumphs (#2)"],["body"," sprawling together in a mixed heap upon the floor.  Freeing themselves with some little difficulty from the general entanglement, they rose to their feet, and after surveying each other for a moment in silence, gave vent to a simultaneous ejaculation of \"_The ghost_!\"  \"What were you fellows doing up there?\" asked Kennedy.  \"Why, we came up to have a joke with you,\" answered Vance; \"but just when we got up to the landing, it--it made that noise!\"  There was the sound of the key turning in the lock of Mr. Blake's door.  \"_Cave_!\" whispered Mugford.  \"Tell him about it,\" added Vance; and giving Diggory a push, they all three darted into their room just as the master emerged from his, arrayed in dressing-gown and slippers.  \"Now, then,\" exclaimed the latter, holding his candle above his head, and peering down the passage, \"what's the meaning of this disturbance? I thought the whole house was falling down.--Come here, you two, and explain yourselves!\"  \"Please, sir,\" answered Kennedy and Jacobs in one breath, \"it's the ghost!\"  \"The ghost!  What ghost?  What d'you mean?\"  The two \"Main-top\" men began a hasty account of the cause of their sudden fright, taking care, however, to make no mention of the three hostile visitors who had shared in the surprise.  Mr. Blake listened to their story in silence, then all at once he burst out laughing, and without a word turned on his heel and went quickly upstairs.  He entered the attic, and in about half a minute they heard him coming back.  \"Ha, ha!  I've got your ghost; I've been trying to lay him for some time past.\"  The jingle of a chain was distinctly audible; Mr. Blake was evidently bringing the spectre down in his arms!  Diggory and Vance could no longer restrain their curiosity; they hopped out of bed and glanced round the corner of the door.  The master held in his hand a rusty old gin, the iron jaws of which were tightly closed upon the body of an enormous rat.  \"There's a monster for you!\" he said; \"I think it's the biggest I ever saw.  He'd carried the trap, chain and all, right across the room, but that finished him; he was as dead as a stone when I picked him up. Now get back to bed; I should think you're both nearly frozen.\"  Diggory and Jack Vance followed the advice given to Kennedy and Jacobs, and did so rather sheepishly.  They felt they had been making tools of themselves; yet it would never have done to own to such a thing.  \"What a lark!\" said the new boy, after a few moments' silence.  \"Wasn't it!\" returned Jack Vance; \"it's the best joke I've had for a long time.  But we didn't pay those fellows out for throwing those snowballs; we must do it some other night.  And now we three must swear to be friends, and stand by each other against all the world, and whatever happens.  What shall we call our room?\"  \"I know,\" answered Diggory: \"we'll call it 'The Triple Alliance!'\"    CHAPTER II.   THE PHILISTINES.  The Triple Alliance, the formation of which has just been described, was destined to be no mere form of speech or empty display of friendship. The members had solemnly sworn to stand by one another whatever happened, and the manner in which they carried out their resolve, and the important consequences which resulted from their concerted actions, will be made known to the reader as our story progresses.  Poor Mugford certainly seemed likely to be a heavy drag on the association; he was constantly tumbling into trouble, and needing to be pulled out again by those who had promised to be his friends.  An instance of this occurred on the day following Diggory's arrival at The Birches.  He and Vance had gone down after morning school into what was called the playroom, to partake of two more of the latter's mince-pies, and on their return to the schoolroom found a crowd assembled round Acton, who, seated on the top of a small cupboard which always served as a judicial bench, was hearing a case in which Mugford was the defendant, while Jacobs and another boy named Cross appeared as plaintiffs.  The charge was that the former was indebted to the latter for the sum of half a crown, which he had borrowed towards the end of the previous term, in separate amounts of one shilling and eighteen pence, promising to repay them, with interest, immediately after the holidays.  The money had been expended in the purchase of a disreputable old canary bird, for which Noaks, the manservant, had agreed to find board and lodging during the Christmas vacation.  Now, when the creditors reminded Mugford of his obligations, they found him totally unable to meet their demands for payment.  \"Now, look here,\" said Acton, addressing the defendant with great severity, \"no humbug--how much money did you bring back with you?\"  \"Well, I had to pay my brother before I came away for my share in a telescope we bought last summer, and then--\"  \"Bother your brother and the telescope!  Why can't you answer my question? How much money did you bring back with you?\"  \"Only five bob.\"  \"Then why in the name of Fortune don't you pay up?\"  \"Because I had to pay all that to Noaks for bird-seed.\"  \"D'you mean to say that that bird ate five shillings' worth of seed in four weeks?\"  \"Well, so Noaks says; he told me he'd kept scores of birds in his time, but he'd 'never seen one so hearty at its grub before.'  Those were the very words he used, and he said it was eating nearly all the day, and that's one reason why it looks such a dowdy colour, and never sings.\"  \"Well, all I can say is, if you believe all Noaks tells you, you're a fool.  But that's no reason why these two chaps should be done out of their money; so now, how are you going to pay them?\"  \"If they only wait till pocket-money's given out--\" began Mugford.  \"Oh no, we shan't!\" interrupted Cross.  \"He only gets sixpence a week, and he's always breaking windows and other things, and having it stopped.\"  There seemed only one way out of the difficulty, and that was to put as it were an execution into Mugford's desk, and realize a certain amount of his private property.  \"Look here,\" said Acton, \"he must sell something.--Now, then,\" he added, turning to the defendant, \"just shell out something and bring it here at once, and we'll have an auction.\"  The boy walked off to his desk, and after rummaging about in it for some little time, returned with a miscellaneous collection of small articles in his arms, which he proceeded to hand up one by one for the judge's inspection.  \"What's this?\"  \"Oh, its a book that was given me on my birthday, called 'Lofty Thoughts for Little Thinkers.'\"  \"Lofty grandmother!\" said Acton impatiently.  \"What else have you got ?\"  \"Well, here's a wire puzzle, only I think a bit of it's lost, and the clasp of a cricket belt, and old Dick Rodman's chessboard and some of the men, and some stuff for chilblains, and--\"  \"Oh, dry up!\" interrupted Acton; \"what bosh!  Who d'you expect would buy any of that rubbish?  Look here, we'll give you till after dinner, and unless you find something sensible by then, we shall come and hunt for ourselves.\"  \"That's just like Mug,\" said Jack Vance to Diggory, as the group of boys slowly dispersed; \"he's always doing something stupid.  But I suppose as we made that alliance, we ought to try to help the beggar somehow.\"  They followed their unfortunate comrade to his desk, which when opened displayed a perfect chaos of ragged books, loose sheets of paper, broken pen-holders, pieces of string, battered cardboard boxes, and other rubbish.  \"Look here, Mug, what have you got to sell? you'll have to fork out something.\"  \"I don't know,\" returned the other mournfully, stirring up the contents of the desk as though he were making a Christmas pudding.  \"I've got nothing, except--well, there's this book of Poe's, 'Tales of Adventure, Mystery, and Imagination,' and my clasp-knife; and perhaps some one would buy these fret-saw patterns or this dog-chain.\"  He turned out two or three more small articles and laid them on the form.  \"Are there any of these things you particularly wish to keep?\" asked Diggory; \"because, if so, Vance and I'll bid for them, and then you can buy them back from us again when you've got some more money.\"  \"That's awfully kind of you,\" answered Mugford, brightening up.  \"I'll tell you what I should like to keep, and that's my clasp-knife and the book; they're such jolly stories.  'The Pit and the Pendulum' always gives me bad dreams, and 'The Premature Burial' makes you feel certain you'll be buried alive.\"  \"All right; and did you bring a cake back with you?\"  \"Yes.\"  \"Well, then, sell that first, and you can share our grub.\"  The auction was held directly after dinner.  The cake fetched a shilling, and Diggory and Vance bid ninepence each for the book and pocket-knife; so Mugford came out of his difficulty without suffering any further loss than what was afterwards made good again by the generosity of his two comrades.  They, for their part, made no fuss over this little act of kindness, but handed the book and clasp-knife over to Mugford without waiting for the money, and little thinking what an important part these trifling possessions would play in the subsequent history of the Triple Alliance.  The sale had not long been concluded, and the little community were preparing to obey Acton's order to \"Come outside,\" when the latter rushed into the room finning with rage.  \"I say,\" he exclaimed, \"what do you think that beast of a Noaks has done?  Why, he's gone and put ashes all over our slide!\"  In their heart of hearts every one felt decidedly relieved at this announcement; still it was necessary, at all events, to simulate some of their leader's wrath, and accordingly there was a general outcry against the offender.  \"Oh, the cad!\"--\"What an awful shame!\"--\"Let's tell Blake!\" etc., etc.  \"Who is Noaks?\" asked Diggory.  \"Is he that sour-looking man who brings the boots in every morning?\"  \"Yes, that's so,\" answered Vance.  \"He hates us all--partly, I believe, because his son's"]]]
