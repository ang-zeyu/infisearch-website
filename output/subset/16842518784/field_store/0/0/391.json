Large re-enforcements have arrived--   Munitions, men, and horses-- For Grant, and all debarked, with stores.    The enemy’s field-works extend six miles-- The gate still hid; so well contrived.  Yesterday stung us; frozen shores   Snow-clad, and through the drear defiles  And over the desolate ridges blew A Lapland wind.                The main affair   Was a good two hours’ steady fight Between our gun-boats and the Fort.   The Louisville’s wheel was smashed outright. A hundred-and-twenty-eight-pound ball Came planet-like through a starboard port, Killing three men, and wounding all The rest of that gun’s crew, (The captain of the gun was cut in two); Then splintering and ripping went-- Nothing could be its continent.   In the narrow stream the Louisville, Unhelmed, grew lawless; swung around,   And would have thumped and drifted, till All the fleet was driven aground, But for the timely order to retire.  Some damage from our fire, ’tis thought, Was done the water-batteries of the Fort.  Little else took place that day,   Except the field artillery in line Would now and then--for love, they say--     Exchange a valentine. The old sharpshooting going on. Some plan afoot as yet unknown; So Friday closed round Donelson.  LATER.       Great suffering through the night-- A stinging one. Our heedless boys   Were nipped like blossoms. Some dozen   Hapless wounded men were frozen. During day being struck down out of sight, And help-cries drowned in roaring noise, They were left just where the skirmish shifted-- Left in dense underbrush now-drifted. Some, seeking to crawl in crippled plight, So stiffened--perished.                         Yet in spite Of pangs for these, no heart is lost. Hungry, and clothing stiff with frost, Our men declare a nearing sun Shall see the fall of Donelson.   And this they say, yet not disown The dark redoubts round Donelson,   And ice-glazed corpses, each a stone--     A sacrifice to Donelson; They swear it, and swerve not, gazing on A flag, deemed black, flying from Donelson. Some of the wounded in the wood   Were cared for by the foe last night, Though he could do them little needed good,   Himself being all in shivering plight. The rebel is wrong, but human yet; He’s got a heart, and thrusts a bayonet. He gives us battle with wondrous will-- The blufff’s a perverted Bunker Hill._  The stillness stealing through the throng The silent thought and dismal fear revealed;         They turned and went,     Musing on right and wrong     And mysteries dimly sealed-- Breasting the storm in daring discontent; The storm, whose black flag showed in heaven, As if to say no quarter there was given     To wounded men in wood,   Or true hearts yearning for the good-- All fatherless seemed the human soul. But next day brought a bitterer bowl--   On the bulletin-board this stood;    _Saturday morning at 3 A.M.     A stir within the Fort betrayed   That the rebels were getting under arms;     Some plot these early birds had laid.   But a lancing sleet cut him who stared   Into the storm. After some vague alarms,   Which left our lads unscared,   Out sallied the enemy at dim of dawn,     With cavalry and artillery, and went     In fury at our environment.   Under cover of shot and shell     Three columns of infantry rolled on,     Vomited out of Donelson--   Rolled down the slopes like rivers of hell,     Surged at our line, and swelled and poured   Like breaking surf. But unsubmerged     Our men stood up, except where roared   The enemy through one gap. We urged   Our all of manhood to the stress,   But still showed shattered in our desperateness.       Back set the tide,   But soon afresh rolled in;     And so it swayed from side to side--   Far batteries joining in the din,   Though sharing in another fray--     Till all became an Indian fight,   Intricate, dusky, stretching far away,   Yet not without spontaneous plan     However tangled showed the plight;   Duels all over ’tween man and man,   Duels on cliff-side, and down in ravine,     Duels at long range, and bone to bone;   Duels every where flitting and half unseen.     Only by courage good as their own,   And strength outlasting theirs,     Did our boys at last drive the rebels off.   Yet they went not back to their distant lairs     In strong-hold, but loud in scoff   Maintained themselves on conquered ground--   Uplands; built works, or stalked around.   Our right wing bore this onset. Noon   Brought calm to Donelson.  The reader ceased; the storm beat hard;   ’Twas day, but the office-gas was lit;   Nature retained her sulking-fit,       In her hand the shard. Flitting faces took the hue Of that washed bulletin-board in view, And seemed to bear the public grief As private, and uncertain of relief; Yea, many an earnest heart was won,   As broodingly he plodded on, To find in himself some bitter thing, Some hardness in his lot as harrowing       As Donelson.  That night the board stood barren there,   Oft eyes by wistful people passing,   Who nothing saw but the rain-beads chasing Each other down the wafered square, As down some storm-beat grave-yard stone. But next day showed--                       MORE NEWS LAST NIGHT.   STORY OF SATURDAY AFTERNOON.  VICISSITUDES OF THE WAR.    _The damaged gun-boats can’t wage fight For days; so says the Commodore. Thus no diversion can be had. Under a sunless sky of lead   Our grim-faced boys in blacked plight Gaze toward the ground they held before, And then on Grant. He marks their mood, And hails it, and will turn the same to good. Spite all that they have undergone, Their desperate hearts are set upon This winter fort, this stubborn fort, This castle of the last resort,       This Donelson.  1 P.M.            An order given   Requires withdrawal from the front   Of regiments that bore the brunt Of morning’s fray. Their ranks all riven Are being replaced by fresh, strong men. Great vigilance in the foeman’s Den; He snuffs the stormers. Need it is That for that fell assault of his, That rout inflicted, and self-scorn-- Immoderate in noble natures, torn By sense of being through slackness overborne-- The rebel be given a quick return: The kindest face looks now half stern. Balked of their prey in airs that freeze, Some fierce ones glare like savages. And yet, and yet, strange moments are-- Well--blood, and tears, and anguished War! The morning’s battle-ground is seen   In lifted glades, like meadows rare;   The blood-drops on the snow-crust there Like clover in the white-week show--   Flushed fields of death, that call again--   Call to our men, and not in vain, For that way must the stormers go.  3 P.M.            The work begins. Light drifts of men thrown forward, fade   In skirmish-line along the slope, Where some dislodgments must be made   Ere the stormer with the strong-hold cope.  Lew Wallace, moving to retake The heights late lost--                        (Herewith a break.   Storms at the West derange the wires. Doubtless, ere morning, we shall hear The end; we look for news to cheer--   Let Hope fan all her fires.)_   Next day in large bold hand was seen The closing bulletin:  VICTORY!         _Our troops have retrieved the day By one grand surge along the line; The spirit that urged them was divine.   The first works flooded, naught could stay The stormers: on! still on! Bayonets for Donelson!  Over the ground that morning lost Rolled the blue billows, tempest-tossed,   Following a hat on the point of a sword. Spite shell and round-shot, grape and canister, Up they climbed without rail or banister--   Up the steep hill-sides long and broad, Driving the rebel deep within his works. ’Tis nightfall; not an enemy lurks   In sight. The chafing men       Fret for more fight:   “To-night, to-night let us take the Den” But night is treacherous, Grant is wary; Of brave blood be a little chary. Patience! the Fort is good as won; To-morrow, and into Donelson._  LATER AND LAST.                  THE FORT IS OURS.    _A flag came out at early morn Bringing surrender. From their towers   Floats out the banner late their scorn. In Dover, hut and house are full   Of rebels dead or dying.   The national flag is flying From the crammed court-house pinnacle. Great boat-loads of our wounded go To-day to Nashville. The sleet-winds blow; But all is right: the fight is won, The winter-fight for Donelson.       Hurrah! The spell of old defeat is broke,   The Habit of victory begun; Grant strikes the war’s first sounding stroke       At Donelson.  For lists of killed and wounded, see The morrow’s dispatch: to-day ’tis victory._  The man who read this to the crowd   Shouted as the end he gained;   And though the unflagging tempest rained,     They answered him aloud. And hand grasped hand, and glances met In happy triumph; eyes grew wet. O, to the punches brewed that night Went little water. Windows bright Beamed rosy on the sleet without, And from the deep street came the frequent shout; While some in prayer, as these in glee, Blessed heaven for the winter-victory.  But others were who wakeful laid   In midnight beds, and early rose,   And, feverish in the foggy snows, Snatched the damp paper--wife and maid.   The death-list like a river flows     Down the pale sheet, And there the whelming waters meet.    Ah God! may Time with happy haste   Bring wail and triumph to a waste,     And war be done;   The battle flag-staff fall athwart   The curs’d ravine, and wither; naught     Be left of trench or gun;   The bastion, let it ebb away,   Washed with the river bed; and Day     In vain seek Donelson.    The Cumberland. (March, 1862.)   Some names there are of telling sound,   Whose voweled syllables free Are pledge that they shall ever live renowned;       Such seem to be A Frigate’s name (by present glory spanned)--       The Cumberland.              Sounding name as ere was sung,             Flowing, rolling on the tongue--             Cumberland! Cumberland!  She warred and sunk.

And I've thought some times that in order to mate mine with the St. Louis show, as you may say, I'd mebby ort to call myself St. Josiah.\"  \"Saint Josiah!\" sez I, and my axent wuz that icy cold that he shivered imperceptibly and added hastily, \"Well, we will leave that to the future to decide.\"  \"But,\" sez he firmly, spruntin' up agin, \"if the nation calls on me to name myself thus I shall respond, and expose myself at my Exposition as Saint Josiah.\"  Sez I anxiously, \"I wouldn't expose myself too much, Josiah. You remember the pa that took his weak-minded child to the ball, and told him to set still and not speak or they would find him out.  \"And they asked him question after question and he didn't say a word, and finally they begun to scoff at him and told him he wuz a fool, and he called out, 'Father, father, they've found me out.'\"  Josiah sez snappishly, \"What you mean by bringin' that old chestnut up I cant see.\"  \"Well,\" sez I, \"I shan't sew the moral on any tighter.\" But he kep' on ignorin' my sarcastick allusion.  \"To keep up the train of almost miraclous incidents marchin' along through the past connecting the St. Louis and the Allen Purchase like historical twins, I'm goin' to spend on the Exposition of Josiah Allen jest the amount paid for the other original purchase, and I may, for there is no tellin' what a Allen may do when his blood is rousted up, I may swing right out and pay jest the same amount St. Louis is payin' for her Exposition.\"  \"Fifty millions!\" sez I with emotions of or--or to think I had a pardner that would tell such a gigantic falsehood, and instinctively I thought of a story I'd hearn Thomas Jefferson tell the evenin' before.  He said three commercial travelers wuz talkin' before an old man from the country whose loose fittin' clothes were gently scattered with hay-seed. The first one told with minute particulars of a Western cyclone that had lifted a house and sot it down in a neighborin' township. The next one said that he wuz knowin' to the circumstances and how the cyclone swep back and brought the suller and sot it down under the house. And the third one remembered vividly how the cyclone went back the second time and brought the hole the suller left and distributed it round under the new site.  The old man listened with deep interest, and said he wuz glad he'd had the privelige of hearin' 'em, for their talk had cleared up a Bible verse he'd long pondered over.  They wuz astounded to think their talk had awakened religious meditations. But the old gentleman said their conversation had cleared up that passage where it said:  \"Annanias come forth.\"  He said it wuz now plain to him that it meant that these three drummers should stand before Annanias, the Prince of Liars, he takin' his place behind 'em, the fourth in the rank of liars.  But this is neither here or there I only mention it as comin' into my mind instinctively and onbeknown to myself as I hearn Josiah Allen's remark, it came and went, as thoughts will, like a lightning flash, even as I wuz repeatin' the words agin in wonderment and horrow.  \"Fifty million dollars!\"  \"No, I said to you, Samantha, that in our conversation we would leave out the orts, fifty dollars wuz what I meant. But as I said this is what I've thought when my brain wuz fired with ambition and glory of histin' the name of Allen up where it ort to be and will be. But when my blood has quieted down and I took a dispassionate view of the affair I have thought it would be more in keepin' with the old traditions of the Allen family, to spend jest fifteen, I can do a noble job with Uncle Sime's help and Ury's, with exactly the same sum that wuz paid for these purchases.\"  I see he wuz jest bound to ignore the millions. But I knowed it wouldn't do any good to keep twittin' him of it. And then he went on to describe more fully the Exposition of Josiah Allen that he'd been plottin' for weeks and weeks. He said that he and uncle Sime had used up two hull pads of writin' paper at a cost of five cents each, plannin' and figurin'. But he didn't begrech the outlay, he said. He wuz layin' out to have the lower paster used as a tentin' ground for the hull Allen race, and the Gowdeys if he decided they wuz worthy to jine in, he hadn't settled on that yet. The cow paster wuz to be used for Equinomical and Agricultural displays and also Peaceful Industries and Inventions, and the lane leadin' up to the barn from the lower paster he laid out to use as a Pike for all sorts of amusements, pitchin' quaits, bull-in-the-barnyard, turnin' hand-springs and summer sets, etc., etc.  Sez I coldly, \"It would draw quite a crowd to see you and Deacon Gowdey standin' on your two old bald heads turnin' a summer set.\"  \"Oh, I laid out to have younger people in such thrillin' seens, Ury and others.\" And then he went on to describe at length his Peaceful Industry Show.  I couldn't sot still to hear it only I felt I wanted to know the worst and cope with it as a surgeon probes to the quick in order to cure.  He thought he could git Aunt Huldy Wood, who wove carpets, to set up her loom for a few days under the big but-nut tree, and be weavin' there before the crowds. He said she wuz a peaceful old critter and would show off well in it. And Bildad Shoecraft, another good-natured creeter, he could bring his shoe-making bench and be tappin' boots. He could not only show off but make money at the same time, for he spozed that many a boot would be wore down to the quick walkin' round viewin' the attractions. And Blandina Teeter he spozed she could run my sewin' machine under the sugar maple. And he thought mebby I would set out under the slippery ellum makin' ginger cookies or fryin' nut-cakes, in either capacity he said I wuz a study for an artist and would draw crowds.  \"The wife of Josiah Allen fryin' nut-cakes, what a sound it would have through the world.\"  \"No, Josiah,\" sez I, \"I shan't try to fry nut-cakes in a open lot without ingregients or fire.\"  \"Well, mebby you'd ruther be one of the attractions of the Pike, Samantha. I hain't goin' to limit you to one thing. As the pardner of the originator of this stupengous scheme you are entitled to respect. There is where Napoleon, the other great actor in these twin dramas, missed it, he didn't use his wife as he ort to. But jest see the wonderful similarity in these cases. He had two step-children; the wife of Josiah had two; I am smaller in statute than my wife; so wuz Napoleon.\"  \"You spoke of your Peaceful Inventions, Josiah,\" sez I, wantin' to git his mind off, for truly I begun to fairly feel sick to the stomach to hear his talk about himself and the Great Conqueror.  \"Oh, yes, Samantha, that in itself will be worth double the price of admission.\"  \"Then you expect to ask pay, Josiah?\"  \"Certainly, why not? Do they not ask pay at the twin celebration?  \"But you spoke of inventions; I shall let the rest of the Allens show off. Lots of 'em have invented things, but of course my inventions will rank number one. There is my button on the suller door I cut it out of an old boot leg. Who ever hearn of a leather button before, and it works well if you don't want to fasten the door tight. Then there is that self actin' hen-coop of mine that lets a stick fall down and shuts the door when the hen walks up the ladder.\"  \"But no hen has ever clim the ladder yet, Josiah.\"  \"No, perhaps they hain't yet, but I'm expectin' to see 'em every day, 'tennyrate paint that coop a bright red and yaller and it will attract a crowd.  \"And then there is that travelin' rat trap of brother Henzy's, you know his grandmother wuz an Allen, I shall mayhap let him appear. And then there is all my farmin' implements and the rest of the Allen's I lay out to be just to all, and let 'em all come and show off in my Agricultural show.  \"But of course there has got to be a head to it; Napoleon wuz the head of the other Purchase, and I'm the head of this. In short, Samantha, I am _It_.\"  Oh, how full of pride and vain glory he wuz, and I knowed such feelin's would have to be brung down for his spiritual good. I realized it as he went on,  \"I tell you, Napoleon and I would have made a span, Samantha, if he could been spared till now.\"  Oh how shamed I wuz to hear such talk, but I sot demute for reasons named, and he sez agin, \"I thought mebby you would want to be one of the attractions of the Pike, Samantha; I lay out to have livin' statutes adornin' the side of the lane leadin' up from the beaver medder to the horse trough.\"  \"Livin' statutes!\" sez I, coldly, \"I don't know what you mean by them.\"  [Illustration]  \"Why, I thought for a few cents I could git a lot of children and old folks to be white-washed for a day or two and pose as statutes. It would be a new thing and a crackin' good idee, for livin' statutes that can wink, and bow, and talk, and walk round some, I don't believe wuz ever hearn on before.\"  \"No indeed,\" sez I, \"but I can tell you, Josiah Allen, I've played many strange parts in the role of life at your request, but I tell you once for all I shall never, _never_ be whitewashed and set up for a statute, you can set your mind to rest on that to once.\"  \"Mebby you'd ruther be a Historical Tabloo, Samantha; I lay out to have beautiful ones, and I thought I wouldn't confine myself to the States, but would branch out and have the foreign nations represented figuratively.  \"A naval battle between Russia and Japan would draw; if I could fix some floats on the creek my stun boat could represent Russia, and Deacon Huffer's Japan, I jest as lives mine would be blowed up and sunk as not, 'tain't good for much. And if I did have that I would have the Russian Bear set on the shore growlin', and the Powers furder back lookin' pleasantly on. You might be a Power, Samantha, if"]]]
