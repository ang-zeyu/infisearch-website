He was altogether a very precise and natty little personage, quiet and unpretending in demeanour, with a mild, thoughtful face in which two small ferrety eyes blinked and twinkled behind gold-rimmed glasses. But when things went wrong, when he had to deal with fools, or when scent was keen, or the enemy near, he would become as fierce and eager as any terrier.  He had just taken his place at his table and begun to arrange his papers, which, being a man of method, he kept carefully sorted by lots each in an old copy of the _Figaro_, when he was called to the telephone. His services were greatly needed, as we know, at the Lyons station and the summons was to the following effect:  \"Crime on train No. 45. A man murdered in the sleeper. All the passengers held. Please come at once. Most important.\"  A fiacre was called instantly, and M. Floçon, accompanied by Galipaud and Block, the two first inspectors for duty, was driven with all possible speed across Paris.  He was met outside the station, just under the wide verandah, by the officials, who gave him a brief outline of the facts, so far as they were known, and as they have already been put before the reader.  \"The passengers have been detained?\" asked M. Floçon at once.  \"Those in the sleeping-car only--\"  \"Tut, tut! they should have been all kept--at least until you had taken their names and addresses. Who knows what they might not have been able to tell?\"  It was suggested that as the crime was committed presumably while the train was in motion, only those in the one car could be implicated.  \"We should never jump to conclusions,\" said the Chief snappishly. \"Well, show me the train card--the list of the travellers in the sleeper.\"  \"It cannot be found, sir.\"  \"Impossible! Why, it is the porter's business to deliver it at the end of the journey to his superiors, and under the law--to us. Where is the porter? In custody?\"  \"Surely, sir, but there is something wrong with him.\"  \"So I should think! Nothing of this kind could well occur without his knowledge. If he was doing his duty--unless, of course, he--but let us avoid hasty conjectures.\"  \"He has also lost the passengers' tickets, which you know he retains till the end of the journey. After the catastrophe, however, he was unable to lay his hand upon his pocket-book. It contained all his papers.\"  \"Worse and worse. There is something behind all this. Take me to him. Stay, can I have a private room close to the other--where the prisoners, those held on suspicion, are? It will be necessary to hold investigations, take their depositions. M. le Juge will be here directly.\"  M. Floçon was soon installed in a room actually communicating with the waiting-room, and as a preliminary of the first importance, taking precedence even of the examination of the sleeping-car, he ordered the porter to be brought in to answer certain questions.  The man, Ludwig Groote, as he presently gave his name, thirty-two years of age, born at Amsterdam, looked such a sluggish, slouching, blear-eyed creature that M. Floçon began by a sharp rebuke.  \"Now. Sharp! Are you always like this?\" cried the Chief.  The porter still stared straight before him with lack-lustre eyes, and made no immediate reply.  \"Are you drunk? are you--Can it be possible?\" he said, and in vague reply to a sudden strong suspicion, he went on:  \"What were you doing between Laroche and Paris? Sleeping?\"  The man roused himself a little. \"I think I slept. I must have slept. I was very drowsy. I had been up two nights; but so it is always, and I am not like this generally. I do not understand.\"  \"Hah!\" The Chief thought he understood. \"Did you feel this drowsiness before leaving Laroche?\"  \"No, monsieur, I did not. Certainly not. I was fresh till then--quite fresh.\"  \"Hum; exactly; I see;\" and the little Chief jumped to his feet and ran round to where the porter stood sheepishly, and sniffed and smelt at him.  \"Yes, yes.\" Sniff, sniff, sniff, the little man danced round and round him, then took hold of the porter's head with one hand, and with the other turned down his lower eyelid so as to expose the eyeball, sniffed a little more, and then resumed his seat.  \"Exactly. And now, where is your train card?\"  \"Pardon, monsieur, I cannot find it.\"  \"That is absurd. Where do you keep it? Look again--search--I must have it.\"  The porter shook his head hopelessly.  \"It is gone, monsieur, and my pocket-book.\"  \"But your papers, the tickets--\"  \"Everything was in it, monsieur. I must have dropped it.\"  Strange, very strange. However--the fact was to be recorded, for the moment. He could of course return to it.  \"You can give me the names of the passengers?\"  \"No, monsieur. Not exactly. I cannot remember, not enough to distinguish between them.\"  \"_Fichtre_! But this is most devilishly irritating. To think that I have to do with a man so stupid--such an idiot, such an ass!\"  \"At least you know how the berths were occupied, how many in each, and which persons? Yes? You can tell me that? Well, go on. By and by we will have the passengers in, and you can fix their places, after I have ascertained their names. Now, please! For how many was the car?\"  \"Sixteen. There were two compartments of four berths each, and four of two berths each.\"  \"Stay, let us make a plan. I will draw it. Here, now, is that right?\" and the Chief held up the rough diagram, here shown--  [Illustration: Diagram of railroad car.]  \"Here we have the six compartments. Now take _a_, with berths 1, 2, 3, and 4. Were they all occupied?\"  \"No; only two, by Englishmen. I know that they talked English, which I understand a little. One was a soldier; the other, I think, a clergyman, or priest.\"  \"Good! we can verify that directly. Now, _b_, with berths 5 and 6. Who was there?\"  \"One gentleman. I don't remember his name. But I shall know him by appearance.\"  \"Go on. In _c_, two berths, 7 and 8?\"  \"Also one gentleman. It was he who--I mean, that is where the crime occurred.\"  \"Ah, indeed, in 7 and 8? Very well. And the next, 9 and 10?\"  \"A lady. Our only lady. She came from Rome.\"  \"One moment. Where did the rest come from? Did any embark on the road?\"  \"No, monsieur; all the passengers travelled through from Rome.\"  \"The dead man included? Was he Roman?\"  \"That I cannot say, but he came on board at Rome.\"  \"Very well. This lady--she was alone?\"  \"In the compartment, yes. But not altogether.\"  \"I do not understand!\"  \"She had her servant with her.\"  \"In the car?\"  \"No, not in the car. As a passenger by second class. But she came to her mistress sometimes, in the car.\"  \"For her service, I presume?\"  \"Well, yes, monsieur, when I would permit it. But she came a little too often, and I was compelled to protest, to speak to Madame la Comtesse--\"  \"She was a countess, then?\"  \"The maid addressed her by that title. That is all I know. I heard her.\"  \"When did you see the lady's maid last?\"  \"Last night. I think at Amberieux. about 8 p.m.\"  \"Not this morning?\"  \"No, sir, I am quite sure of that.\"  \"Not at Laroche? She did not come on board to stay, for the last stage, when her mistress would be getting up, dressing, and likely to require her?\"  \"No; I should not have permitted it.\"  \"And where is the maid now, d'you suppose?\"  The porter looked at him with an air of complete imbecility.  \"She is surely somewhere near, in or about the station. She would hardly desert her mistress now,\" he said, stupidly, at last.  \"At any rate we can soon settle that.\" The Chief turned to one of his assistants, both of whom had been standing behind him all the time, and said:  \"Step out, Galipaud, and see. No, wait. I am nearly as stupid as this simpleton. Describe this maid.\"  \"Tall and slight, dark-eyed, very black hair. Dressed all in black, plain black bonnet. I cannot remember more.\"  \"Find her, Galipaud--keep your eye on her. We may want her--why, I cannot say, as she seems disconnected with the event, but still she ought to be at hand.\" Then, turning to the porter, he went on. \"Finish, please. You said 9 and 10 was the lady's. Well, 11 and 12?\"  \"It was vacant all through the run.\"  \"And the last compartment, for four?\"  \"There were two berths, occupied both by Frenchmen, at least so I judged them. They talked French to each other and to me.\"  \"Then now we have them all. Stand aside, please, and I will make the passengers come in. We will then determine their places and affix their names from their own admissions. Call them in, Block, one by one.\"   CHAPTER III  The questions put by M. Floçon were much the same in every case, and were limited in this early stage of the inquiry to the one point of identity.  The first who entered was a Frenchman. He was a jovial, fat-faced, portly man, who answered to the name of Anatole Lafolay, and who described himself as a traveller in precious stones. The berth he had occupied was No. 13 in compartment _f_. His companion in the berth was a younger man, smaller, slighter, but of much the same stamp. His name was Jules Devaux, and he was a commission agent. His berth had been No. 15 in the same compartment, _f_. Both these Frenchmen gave their addresses with the names of many people to whom they were well known, and established at once a reputation for respectability which was greatly in their favour.  The third to appear was the tall, gray-headed Englishman, who had taken a certain lead at the first discovery of the crime. He called himself General Sir Charles Collingham, an officer of her Majesty's army; and the clergyman who shared the compartment was his brother, the Reverend Silas Collingham, rector of Theakstone-Lammas, in the county of Norfolk. Their berths were numbered 1 and 4 in _a_.  Before the English General was dismissed, he asked whether he was likely to be detained.  \"For the present, yes,\" replied M. Floçon, briefly. He did not care to"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11451"],["title","The Rome Express (#2)"],["body","asked questions. That, under the circumstances, was his business.  \"Because I should like to communicate with the British Embassy.\"  \"You are known there?\" asked the detective, not choosing to believe the story at first. It might be a ruse of some sort.  \"I know Lord Dufferin personally; I was with him in India. Also Colonel Papillon, the military attaché; we were in the same regiment. If I sent to the Embassy, the latter would, no doubt, come himself.\"  \"How do you propose to send?\"  \"That is for you to decide. All I wish is that it should be known that my brother and I are detained under suspicion, and incriminated.\"  \"Hardly that, Monsieur le General. But it shall be as you wish. We will telephone from here to the post nearest the Embassy to inform his Excellency--\"  \"Certainly, Lord Dufferin, and my friend, Colonel Papillon.\"  \"Of what has occurred. And now, if you will permit me to proceed?\"  So the single occupant of the compartment _b_, that adjoining the Englishmen, was called in. He was an Italian, by name Natale Ripaldi; a dark-skinned man, with very black hair and a bristling black moustache. He wore a long dark cloak of the Inverness order, and, with the slouch hat he carried in his hand, and his downcast, secretive look, he had the rather conventional aspect of a conspirator.  \"If monsieur permits,\" he volunteered to say after the formal questioning was over, \"I can throw some light on this catastrophe.\"  \"And how so, pray? Did you assist? Were you present? If so, why wait to speak till now?\" said the detective, receiving the advance rather coldly. It behooved him to be very much on his guard.  \"I have had no opportunity till now of addressing any one in authority. You are in authority, I presume?\"  \"I am the Chief of the Detective Service.\"  \"Then, monsieur, remember, please, that I can give some useful information when called upon. Now, indeed, if you will receive it.\"  M. Floçon was so anxious to approach the inquiry without prejudice that he put up his hand.  \"We will wait, if you please. When M. le Juge arrives, then, perhaps; at any rate, at a later stage. That will do now, thank you.\"  The Italian's lip curled with a slight indication of contempt at the French detective's methods, but he bowed without speaking, and went out.  Last of all the lady appeared, in a long sealskin travelling cloak, and closely veiled. She answered M. Floçon's questions in a low, tremulous voice, as though greatly perturbed.  She was the Contessa di Castagneto, she said, an Englishwoman by birth; but her husband had been an Italian, as the name implied, and they resided in Rome. He was dead--she had been a widow for two or three years, and was on her way now to London.  \"That will do, madame, thank you,\" said the detective, politely, \"for the present at least.\"  \"Why, are we likely to be detained? I trust not.\" Her voice became appealing, almost piteous. Her hands, restlessly moving, showed how much she was distressed.  \"Indeed, Madame la Comtesse, it must be so. I regret it infinitely; but until we have gone further into this, have elicited some facts, arrived at some conclusions--But there, madame, I need not, must not say more.\"  \"Oh, monsieur, I was so anxious to continue my journey. Friends are awaiting me in London. I do hope--I most earnestly beg and entreat you to spare me. I am not very strong; my health is indifferent. Do, sir, be so good as to release me from--\"  As she spoke, she raised her veil, and showed what no woman wishes to hide, least of all when seeking the good-will of one of the opposite sex. She had a handsome face--strikingly so. Not even the long journey, the fatigue, the worries and anxieties which had supervened, could rob her of her marvellous beauty.  She was a brilliant brunette, dark-skinned; but her complexion was of a clear, pale olive, and as soft, as lustrous as pure ivory. Her great eyes, of a deep velvety brown, were saddened by near tears. She had rich red lips, the only colour in her face, and these, habitually slightly apart, showed pearly-white glistening teeth.  It was difficult to look at this charming woman without being affected by her beauty. M. Floçon was a Frenchman, gallant and impressionable; yet he steeled his heart. A detective must beware of sentiment, and he seemed to see something insidious in this appeal, which he resented.  \"Madame, it is useless,\" he answered gruffly. \"I do not make the law; I have only to support it. Every good citizen is bound to that.\"  \"I trust I am a good citizen,\" said the Countess, with a wan smile, but very wearily. \"Still, I should wish to be let off now. I have suffered greatly, terribly, by this horrible catastrophe. My nerves are quite shattered. It is too cruel. However, I can say no more, except to ask that you will let my maid come to me.\"  M. Floçon, still obdurate, would not even consent to that.  \"I fear, madame, that for the present at least you cannot be allowed to communicate with any one, not even with your maid.\"  \"But she is not implicated; she was not in the car. I have not seen her since--\"  \"Since?\" repeated M. Floçon, after a pause.  \"Since last night, at Amberieux, about eight o'clock. She helped me to undress, and saw me to bed. I sent her away then, and said I should not need her till we reached Paris. But I want her now, indeed I do.\"  \"She did not come to you at Laroche?\"  \"No. Have I not said so? The porter,\"--here she pointed to the man, who stood staring at her from the other side of the table,--\"he made difficulties about her being in the car, saying that she came too often, stayed too long, that I must pay for her berth, and so on. I did not see why I should do that; so she stayed away.\"  \"Except from time to time?\"  \"Precisely.\"  \"And the last time was at Amberieux?\"  \"As I have told you, and he will tell you the same.\"  \"Thank you, madame, that will do.\" The Chief rose from his chair, plainly intimating that the interview was at an end.   CHAPTER IV  He had other work to do, and was eager to get at it. So he left Block to show the Countess back to the waiting-room, and, motioning to the porter that he might also go, the Chief hastened to the sleeping-car, the examination of which, too long delayed, claimed his urgent attention.  It is the first duty of a good detective to visit the actual theatre of a crime and overhaul it inch by inch,--seeking, searching, investigating, looking for any, even the most insignificant, traces of the murderer's hands.  The sleeping-car, as I have said, had been side-tracked, its doors were sealed, and it was under strict watch and ward. But everything, of course, gave way before the detective, and, breaking through the seals, he walked in, making straight for the little room or compartment where the body of the victim still lay untended and absolutely untouched.  It was a ghastly sight, although not new in M. Floçon's experience. There lay the corpse in the narrow berth, just as it had been stricken. It was partially undressed, wearing only shirt and drawers. The former lay open at the chest, and showed the gaping wound that had, no doubt, caused death, probably instantaneous death. But other blows had been struck; there must have been a struggle, fierce and embittered, as for dear life. The savage truculence of the murderer had triumphed, but not until he had battered in the face, destroying features and rendering recognition almost impossible.  A knife had given the mortal wound; that was at once apparent from the shape of the wound. It was the knife, too, which had gashed and stabbed the face, almost wantonly; for some of these wounds had not bled, and the plain inference was that they had been inflicted after life had sped. M. Floçon examined the body closely, but without disturbing it. The police medical officer would wish to see it as it was found. The exact position, as well as the nature of the wounds, might afford evidence as to the manner of death.  But the Chief looked long, and with absorbed, concentrated interest, at the murdered man, noting all he actually saw, and conjecturing a good deal more.  The features of the mutilated face were all but unrecognizable, but the hair, which was abundant, was long, black, and inclined to curl; the black moustache was thick and drooping. The shirt was of fine linen, the drawers silk. On one finger were two good rings, the hands were clean, the nails well kept, and there was every evidence that the man did not live by manual labour. He was of the easy, cultured class, as distinct from the workman or operative.  This conclusion was borne out by his light baggage, which still lay about the berth,--hat-box, rugs, umbrella, brown morocco hand-bag. All were the property of some one well to do, or at least possessed of decent belongings. One or two pieces bore a monogram, \"F.Q.,\" the same as on the shirt and under-linen; but on the bag was a luggage label, with the name, \"Francis Quadling, passenger to Paris,\" in full. Its owner had apparently no reason to conceal his name. More strangely, those who had done him to death had been at no pains to remove all traces of his identity.  M. Floçon opened the hand-bag, seeking for further evidence; but found nothing of importance,--only loose collars, cuffs, a sponge and slippers, two Italian newspapers of an earlier date. No money, valuables, or papers. All these had been removed probably, and presumably, by the perpetrator of the crime.  Having settled the first preliminary but essential points, he next surveyed the whole compartment critically. Now, for the first time, he was struck with the fact that the window was open to its full height. Since when was this? It was a question to be put presently to the porter and any others who had entered the car, but the discovery drew him to examine the window more closely, and with good results.  At the ledge, caught on a projecting point on the far side, partly in, partly out of the car, was a morsel of white lace, a scrap of feminine"]]]
