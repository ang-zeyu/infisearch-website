There was one queer thing about the house of West Inch.  It has been reckoned by engineers and other knowing folk that the boundary line between the two countries ran right through the middle of it, splitting our second-best bedroom into an English half and a Scotch half.  Now the cot in which I always slept was so placed that my head was to the north of the line and my feet to the south of it.  My friends say that if I had chanced to lie the other way my hair might not have been so sandy, nor my mind of so solemn a cast.  This I know, that more than once in my life, when my Scotch head could see no way out of a danger, my good thick English legs have come to my help, and carried me clear away. But at school I never heard the end of this, for they would call me \"Half-and-half\" and \"The Great Britain,\" and sometimes \"Union Jack.\" When there was a battle between the Scotch and English boys, one side would kick my shins and the other cuff my ears, and then they would both stop and laugh as though it were something funny.  At first I was very miserable at the Berwick Academy.  Birtwhistle was the first master, and Adams the second, and I had no love for either of them.  I was shy and backward by nature, and slow at making a friend either among masters or boys.  It was nine miles as the crow flies, and eleven and a half by road, from Berwick to West Inch, and my heart grew heavy at the weary distance that separated me from my mother; for, mark you, a lad of that age pretends that he has no need of his mother's caresses, but ah, how sad he is when he is taken at his word!  At last I could stand it no longer, and I determined to run away from the school and make my way home as fast as I might.  At the very last moment, however, I had the good fortune to win the praise and admiration of every one, from the headmaster downwards, and to find my school life made very pleasant and easy to me.  And all this came of my falling by accident out of a second-floor window.  This was how it happened.  One evening I had been kicked by Ned Barton, who was the bully of the school; and this injury coming on the top of all my other grievances, caused my little cup to overflow.  I vowed that night, as I buried my tear-stained face beneath the blankets, that the next morning would either find me at West Inch or well on the way to it. Our dormitory was on the second floor, but I was a famous climber, and had a fine head for heights. I used to think little, young as I was, of swinging myself with a rope round my thigh off the West Inch gable, and that stood three-and-fifty feet above the ground.  There was not much fear then but that I could make my way out of Birtwhistle's dormitory. I waited a weary while until the coughing and tossing had died away, and there was no sound of wakefulness from the long line of wooden cots; then I very softly rose, slipped on my clothes, took my shoes in my hand, and walked tiptoe to the window.  I opened the casement and looked out.  Underneath me lay the garden, and close by my hand was the stout branch of a pear tree. An active lad could ask no better ladder. Once in the garden I had but a five-foot wall to get over, and then there was nothing but distance between me and home.  I took a firm grip of a branch with one hand, placed my knee upon another one, and was about to swing myself out of the window, when in a moment I was as silent and as still as though I had been turned to stone.  There was a face looking at me from over the coping of the wall.  A chill of fear struck to my heart at its whiteness and its stillness. The moon shimmered upon it, and the eyeballs moved slowly from side to side, though I was hid from them behind the screen of the pear tree. Then in a jerky fashion this white face ascended, until the neck, shoulders, waist, and knees of a man became visible.  He sat himself down on the top of the wall, and with a great heave he pulled up after him a boy about my own size, who caught his breath from time to time as though to choke down a sob.  The man gave him a shake, with a few rough whispered words, and then the two dropped together down into the garden. I was still standing balanced with one foot upon the bough and one upon the casement, not daring to budge for fear of attracting their attention, for I could hear them moving stealthily about in the long shadow of the house.  Suddenly, from immediately beneath my feet, I heard a low grating noise and the sharp tinkle of falling glass.  \"That's done it,\" said the man's eager whisper.  \"There is room for you.\"  \"But the edge is all jagged!\" cried the other in a weak quaver.  The fellow burst out into an oath that made my skin pringle.  \"In with you, you cub,\" he snarled, \"or--\"  I could not see what he did, but there was a short, quick gasp of pain.  \"I'll go!  I'll go!\" cried the little lad.  But I heard no more, for my head suddenly swam, my heel shot off the branch, I gave a dreadful yell, and came down, with my ninety-five pounds of weight, right upon the bent back of the burglar.  If you ask me, I can only say that to this day I am not quite certain whether it was an accident or whether I designed it.  It may be that while I was thinking of doing it Chance settled the matter for me.  The fellow was stooping with his head forward thrusting the boy through a tiny window, when I came down upon him just where the neck joins the spine.  He gave a kind of whistling cry, dropped upon his face, and rolled three times over, drumming on the grass with his heels.  His little companion flashed off in the moonlight, and was over the wall in a trice.  As for me, I sat yelling at the pitch of my lungs and nursing one of my legs, which felt as if a red-hot ring were welded round it.  It was not long, as may be imagined, before the whole household, from the headmaster to the stable boy, were out in the garden with lamps and lanterns.  The matter was soon cleared: the man carried off upon a shutter, and I borne in much state and solemnity to a special bedroom, where the small bone of my leg was set by Surgeon Purdie, the younger of the two brothers of that name.  As to the robber, it was found that his legs were palsied, and the doctors were of two minds as to whether he would recover the use of them or no; but the Law never gave them a chance of settling the matter, for he was hanged after Carlisle assizes, some six weeks later.  It was proved that he was the most desperate rogue in the North of England, for he had done three murders at the least, and there were charges enough against him upon the sheet to have hanged him ten times over.  Well now, I could not pass over my boyhood without telling you about this, which was the most important thing that happened to me.  But I will go off upon no more side tracks; for when I think of all that is coming, I can see very well that I shall have more than enough to do before I have finished.  For when a man has only his own little private tale to tell, it often takes him all his time; but when he gets mixed up in such great matters as I shall have to speak about, then it is hard on him, if he has not been brought up to it, to get it all set down to his liking.  But my memory is as good as ever, thank God, and I shall try to get it all straight before I finish.  It was this business of the burglar that first made a friendship between Jim Horscroft, the doctor's son, and me.  He was cock boy of the school from the day he came; for within the hour he had thrown Barton, who had been cock before him, right through the big blackboard in the class-room.  Jim always ran to muscle and bone, and even then he was square and tall, short of speech and long in the arm, much given to lounging with his broad back against walls, and his hands deep in his breeches pockets.  I can even recall that he had a trick of keeping a straw in the corner of his mouth, just where he used afterwards to hold his pipe.  Jim was always the same for good and for bad since first I knew him.  Heavens, how we all looked up to him!  We were but young savages, and had a savage's respect for power.  There was Tom Carndale of Appleby, who could write alcaics as well as mere pentameters and hexameters, yet nobody would give a snap for Tom; and there was Willie Earnshaw, who had every date, from the killing of Abel, on the tip of his tongue, so that the masters themselves would turn to him if they were in doubt, yet he was but a narrow-chested lad, over long for his breadth; and what did his dates help him when Jack Simons of the lower third chivied him down the passage with the buckle end of a strap?  But you didn't do things like that with Jim Horscroft.  What tales we used to whisper about his strength!  How he put his fist through the oak-panel of the game-room door; how, when Long Merridew was carrying the ball, he caught up Merridew, ball and all, and ran swiftly past every opponent to the goal.  It did not seem fit to us that such a one as he should trouble his head about spondees and dactyls, or care to know who signed the Magna Charta.  When he said in open class that King Alfred was the man, we little boys all felt that very likely it was so, and that perhaps Jim knew more about it than the man who wrote the book.  Well, it was this business of the burglar that drew his attention to me; for he patted me on my head, and said that I was a spunky little devil, which blew me out with pride for a week on end.  For two years we were close  friends, for all the gap that the years had made between us, and though in passion or in want of thought he did many a thing that galled me, yet I loved him like a brother, and wept as much as would have filled an ink bottle when at last he went off to Edinburgh to study his father's profession.  Five years after that did I tide at Birtwhistle's, and when I left had become cock myself, for I was wiry and as tough"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11656"],["title","The Great Shadow and Other Napoleonic Tales (#2)"],["body"," whalebone, though I never ran to weight and sinew like my great predecessor.  It was in Jubilee Year that I left Birtwhistle's, and then for three years I stayed at home learning the ways of the cattle; but still the ships and the armies were wrestling, and still the great shadow of Bonaparte lay across the country.  How could I guess that I too should have a hand in lifting that shadow for ever from our people?   CHAPTER II.   COUSIN EDIE OF EYEMOUTH.  Some years before, when I was still but a lad, there had come over to us upon a five weeks' visit the only daughter of my father's brother. Willie Calder had settled at Eyemouth as a maker of fishing nets, and he had made more out of twine than ever we were like to do out of the whin-bushes and sand-links of West Inch.  So his daughter, Edie Calder, came over with a braw red frock and a five shilling bonnet, and a kist full of things that brought my dear mother's eyes out like a partan's. It was wonderful to see her so free with money, and she but a slip of a girl, paying the carrier man all that he asked and a whole twopence over, to which he had no claim.  She made no more of drinking ginger-beer than we did of water, and she would have her sugar in her tea and butter with her bread just as if she had been English.  I took no great stock of girls at that time, for it was hard for me to see what they had been made for.  There were none of us at Birtwhistle's that thought very much of them; but the smallest laddies seemed to have the most sense, for after they began to grow bigger they were not so sure about it.  We little ones were all of one mind: that a creature that couldn't fight and was aye carrying tales, and couldn't so much as shy a stone without flapping its arm like a rag in the wind, was no use for anything.  And then the airs that they would put on, as if they were mother and father rolled into one; for ever breaking into a game with \"Jimmy, your toe's come through your boot,\" or \"Go home, you dirty boy, and clean yourself,\" until the very sight of them was weariness.  So when this one came to the steading at West Inch I was not best pleased to see her.  I was twelve at the time (it was in the holidays) and she eleven, a thin, tallish girl with black eyes and the queerest ways.  She was for ever staring out in front of her with her lips parted, as if she saw something wonderful; but when I came behind her and looked the same way, I could see nothing but the sheep's trough or the midden, or father's breeches hanging on a clothes-line.  And then if she saw a lump of heather or bracken, or any common stuff of that sort, she would mope over it, as if it had struck her sick, and cry, \"How sweet! how perfect!\" just as though it had been a painted picture. She didn't like games, but I used to make her play \"tig\" and such like; but it was no fun, for I could always catch her in three jumps, and she could never catch me, though she would come with as much rustle and flutter as ten boys would make.  When I used to tell her that she was good for nothing, and that her father was a fool to bring her up like that, she would begin to cry, and say that I was a rude boy, and that she would go home that very night, and never forgive me as long as she lived.  But in five minutes she had forgot all about it.  What was strange was that she liked me a deal better than I did her, and she would never leave me alone; but she was always watching me and running after me, and then saying, \"Oh, here you are!\" as if it were a surprise.  But soon I found that there was good in her too.  She used sometimes to give me pennies, so that once I had four in my pocket all at the same time;  but the best part of her was the stories that she could tell. She was sore frightened of frogs, so I would bring one to her, and tell her that I would put it down her neck unless she told a story. That always helped her to begin; but when once she was started it was wonderful how she would carry on.  And the things that had happened to her, they were enough to take your breath away.  There was a Barbary rover that had been at Eyemouth, and he was coming back in five years in a ship full of gold to make her his wife;  and then there was a wandering knight who had been there also, and he had given her a ring which he said he would redeem when the time came.  She showed me the ring, which was very like the ones upon my bed curtain; but she said that this one was virgin gold.  I asked her what the knight would do if he met the Barbary rover, and she told me that he would sweep his head from his shoulders.   What they could all see in her was more than I could think.  And then she told me that she had been followed on her way to West Inch by a disguised prince.  I asked her how she knew it was a prince, and she said by his disguise.  Another day she said that her father was preparing a riddle, and that when it was ready it would be put in the papers, and anyone who guessed it would have half his fortune and his daughter.  I said that I was good at riddles, and that she must send it to me when it was ready.  She said it would be in the _Berwick Gazette_, and wanted to know what I would do with her when I won her.  I said I would sell her by public roup for what she would fetch; but she would tell no more stories that evening, for she was very techy about some things.  Jim Horscroft was away when Cousin Edie was with us, but he came back the very week she went; and I mind how surprised I was that he should ask any questions or take any interest in a mere lassie.  He asked me if she were pretty; and when I said I hadn't noticed, he laughed and called me a mole, and said my eyes would be opened some day.  But very soon he came to be interested in something else, and I never gave Edie another thought until one day she just took my life in her hands and twisted it as I could twist this quill.  That was in 1813, after I had left school, when I was already eighteen years of age, with a good forty hairs on my upper lip and every hope of more.  I had changed since I left school, and was not so keen on games as I had been, but found myself instead lying about on the sunny side of the braes, with my own lips parted and my eyes staring just the same as Cousin Edie's used to do.  It had satisfied me and filled my whole life that I could run faster and jump higher than my neighbour; but now all that seemed such a little thing, and I yearned, and yearned, and looked up at the big arching sky, and down at the flat blue sea, and felt that there was something wanting, but could never lay my tongue to what that something was.  And I became quick of temper too, for my nerves seemed all of a fret, and when my mother would ask me what ailed me, or my father would speak of my turning my hand to work, I would break into such sharp bitter answers as I have often grieved over since.  Ah! a man may have more than one wife, and more than one child, and more than one friend; but he can never have but the one mother, so let him cherish her while he may.  One day when I came in from the sheep, there was my father sitting with a letter in his hands, which was a very rare thing with us, except when the factor wrote for the rent.  Then as I came nearer to him I saw that he was crying, and I stood staring, for I had always thought that it was not a thing that a man could do.  I can see him now, for he had so deep a crease across his brown cheek that no tear could pass it, but must trickle away sideways and so down to his ear, hopping off on to the sheet of paper.  My mother sat beside him and stroked his hands like she did the cat's back when she would soothe it.  \"Aye, Jeannie,\" said he, \"poor Willie's gone.  It's from the lawyer, and it was sudden or they'd ha' sent word of it.  Carbuncle, he says, and a flush o' blood to the head.\"  \"Ah! well, his trouble's over,\" said my mother.  My father rubbed his ears with the tablecloth.  \"He's left a' his savings to his lassie,\" said he, \"and by gom if she's not changed from what she promised to be she'll soon gar them flee. You mind what she said of weak tea under this very roof, and it at seven shillings the pound!\"  My mother shook her head, and looked up at the flitches of bacon that hung from the ceiling.  \"He doesn't say how much, but she'll have enough and to spare, he says. And she's to come and bide with us, for that was his last wish.\"  \"To pay for her keep!\" cried my mother sharply.  I was sorry that she should have spoken of money at that moment, but then if she had not been sharp we would all have been on the roadside in a twelvemonth.  \"Aye, she'll pay, and she's coming this very day.  Jock lad, I'll want you to drive to Ayton and meet the evening coach.  Your Cousin Edie will be in it, and you can fetch her over to West Inch.\"  And so off I started at quarter past five with Souter Johnnie, the long-haired fifteen-year-old, and our cart with the new-painted tail-board that we only used on great days.  The coach was in just as I came, and I, like a foolish country lad, taking no heed to the years that had passed, was looking about among the folk in the Inn front for a slip of a girl with her petticoats just under her knees.  And as I slouched past and craned my neck there came a touch to my elbow, and there was a lady dressed all in black standing by the steps, and I knew that it was my  cousin Edie.  I knew it, I say, and yet had she not touched me I might have passed her a score of times and never known it.  My word, if Jim Horscroft had asked me then if she were pretty or no, I should have known how to answer him!  She was dark, much darker than is common among our border lasses, and yet with such a faint blush of pink breaking through her dainty colour, like the deeper flush at the heart of a sulphur rose. Her lips were red, and kindly, and firm; and even then, at the first glance, I saw that light of mischief and mockery that danced away at the back of her great dark eyes."]]]
