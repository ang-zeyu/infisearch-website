Likewise, inasmuch as she was the same Width all the way up and down, the same as a Poster Girl, and used to sport a Velvet Shroud with Black Beads on it, and could wield a Tooth-Pick and carry on a Conversation at the same time, he knew that sooner or later some Handsome Wretch with Money would try to Abduct her.  Sometimes he would bring a Friend Home to Dinner, and then if the Friend extended himself and told the Missus how well she was looking or Perjured himself over her Hand-Painting, Papa would get a Grouch and hide in the Corner.  [Illustration: BABY]  Then she would Fan herself rapidly and ask, \"Aren't you well, Dear?\"  Dear would force one of those Dying-Martyr Smiles and reply, \"I am quite well, Puss.\"  Then Puss would tell the Visitor that Baby was simply ruining his Health through Devotion to his Employers, but they didn't seem to Appreciate him at all.  After the Visitor went away there would be Language all over the Shop, and the poor Hired Girl would lock the Door and write to the Intelligence Office for a new Place.  Truly, it was a Happy Little Home, with the Reverse English.  She would Frisk his Wardrobe every day or two, looking for Evidence, and he would compel her to Itemize her Accounts so that he might be sure she was not giving Jewelry to the Iceman.  She would find a certain Passage in a Book, relating to Man's Cruelty and Woman's Silent Suffering, and then she would Mark the Passage and put it where he could Find it. Then when he Found it, he would Mark it \"Rot!\" and put it where She could find it, and then she would Weep and write Letters to Lady Authors telling them how Sad and Lonely she was.  But all the Time they kept up an Affectionate Front before their Acquaintances. They thought it better to avoid Scenes in Public; and although each knew that the other was False and had ceased to Love, they could not bring themselves to think of a Separation or a Divorce on account of the Cat--their Cat! The Cat must never know.  However, one of his Business Associates was On. He was a Bachelor and had lived at a European Hotel for Years, and he knew just how to Arbitrate a Domestic Scrap. So he sat down one day and gave the Husband a Good Talking-To. He said it was a Shame that such Nice People should have their Differences when it was so easy to be Happy. With that he handed over a Slew of Platitudes and Proverbs, such as: \"A Soft Answer Turneth Away Wrath,\" \"It takes Two to Make a Quarrel,\" \"Think Twice before you Speak once,\" _et cetera._  [Illustration: SWEETIE]  The Gist of his heart-to-heart Talk was that any Husband could stop Rough House Proceedings and shoot all kinds of Sweetness and Light into the sassiest Mooch a Wife ever got on to herself, if only he would refuse to Quarrel with her, receive her Flings without a Show of Wrath, and get up every Morning ready to Plug for a Renaissance of their Early Love.  Oh, but it was a Beauty Bright System! The European Hotel Bachelor said it couldn't Lose.  The Husband decided to give it a Trial. That very Afternoon he met his Wife, who had come out in her long Fawn-Colored Coat that fell straight in the Back. She had her Upper Rigging set, and was trying to Blanket everything on the Street. He flashed a Smiling Countenance, and said he was glad to see her. Then, instead of asking her When she left the House, and Where she had been since then, and How Soon she expected to go Home again, he told her she was looking Unusually Charming. She was Startled.  [Illustration: THE CAT]  He handed her a Ten and told her to have a Good Time. Now, usually, when she wanted any Pin Money, she had to Pry it out of him.  On her way home her Mind was in a Tumult. Why had he given her the Con Speech and all that Money? What was the Ulterior Motive? What had he been Doing that he should attempt to Coddle her into a Forgiving Mood? Did he Fear that she would get next to his Past? Huh?  He just couldn't Fool her. She knew Something was Doing. Else why should he try to Fix her?  As soon as he came Home that Evening she Accused him and said she knew All. Instead of Countering with the usual Gibe, he told her that she was the Only Woman he had ever Loved and would she go to a Show that Evening? She went, thinking that perhaps the Other Woman might be there and she could detect some Signal passing between them. While at the Theater he fanned her and explained the Plot, and was all Attention. They rode Home in a Cab, because he said a Car wasn't good enough for His Queen. After they were at Home he asked her to sing the Song he had liked so much in the Old Days, \"My Bonnie Lies Over the Ocean.\" This was Conclusive Proof to her that the Hussy's Name was Bonnie.  Next Morning before he started away he Kissed her, and it wasn't any Make-Believe such as you see in Comic Opera. It was a genuine Olga Nethersole Buss, full of Linger and Adhesion. To cap the Climax he said he would stop in and order some Violets.  As soon as the Door slammed she Staggered toward the Kitchen, holding on to the Furniture here and there, the same as a Sardou Heroine. In the Kitchen was a Box of Rough on Rats. Hastily Concealing it beneath the loose Folds of her Morning Gown, she went to her Room and looked in the Mirror.  Ah, when he saw that Cold, White Face, then he would be Sorry. Upon Second Thought, this didn't seem to be a Moral Certainty, so she Weakened and had the Girl take the Poison and Hide it. She said she would Live--Live to Forget his Perfidy.  That day she went back to Mamma, and took the Cat with her.  When he came Home in the Twilight he found no Wife, no Cat--only a Scribbled Note saying that he could no longer Deceive her; that she had seen through his Diabolical Plan to Lull her Suspicions, and that she was no longer Safe in the Same House.  When the Deserted Husband went to the Friend and told him what had Happened, the Wise Bachelor said:  \"I see. You did not go at her Strong enough.\"  MORAL: _They don't know Anything about it_.     _THE_ FABLE _OF THE_ EX-CHATTEL _AND THE_ AWFUL SWAT _THAT_ WAS WAITING _FOR THE COLONEL_   In one of the States of the Sunny South there stood a war-time House that had six white Columns along the Veranda, and the Chimney ran up the outside of the Wall.  This House was the Abode of a Colonel who had a silver-gray Goatee and the Manners of the Old School. All the First Families in the State were related to him, and therefore he was somewhat Particular as to who Lined Up with him when he took his Toddy.  He was proud of his Ancestry, and he carried the Scars to prove that he would Resent an Insult.  Now it happened that the Thirteenth Amendment signified nothing to him. He had been Reconstructed, but it didn't Take.  While on a Business Trip to the North he stopped at a Gaudy Hotel with all kinds of Mirrors and Onyx Stairways.  The Head Waiter at this Hotel was a Colored Gentleman with a False Front and a Dress Suit that fit him too soon. His Name was Mr. Winfield. He was President of the Colored Waiters' Union, Vice-President of the Republican County Central Committee, and Regal Commander of the Princes of Ethiopia.  His Honors lay Heavily upon him. He showed People where to sit in the Dining Room, and those who failed to Obey usually had to wait fifteen or twenty Minutes for their Vermicelli.  [Illustration: THE COLONEL]  Mr. Winfield favored his Feet somewhat, which caused him to walk Syncopated, but, everything considered, he was quite Important and fairly Warm.  One morning the Colonel went into the Dining Room, and after he had seated himself he called Mr. Winfield to him and said he wanted some Hot Biscuit. At the same time he addressed Mr. Winfield as a Black Hound. Mr. Winfield did not know that this was a Term of Endearment in Apahatchie County, so he picked up a Silver Fruit Dish and bounced it against the Colonel's Head.  The Colonel arose and pulled his Persuader, expecting to make it a Case of Justifiable Homicide, but two Waiters named George and Grant grabbed him and backed him up against the Wall.  There were other guests in the Dining Room, but they did not jump in with any Gun Plays and make it a Race War, because Apahatchie County was Eight Hundred Miles away. One of them Co-Operated to the extent of Ringing three times for a Policeman.  The Officer of the Law who arrived in a few Minutes was Mr. Otis Beasley, Most Worshipful Scribe of the Princes of Ethiopia, of which Mr. Winfield was the Regal Commander.  Mr. Beasley walked up to Mr. Winfield, and placing his Left Hand on his Brow, said, \"Hail, Brother.\"  \"Hail, Most Noble Prince!\" responded Mr. Winfield, making the Mystic Sign.  \"What are the Objects of our Beloved Fraternity?\" asked Mr. Beasley, in a whisper.  \"Hope, Coslosterousness, and Polotomy,\" replied the Regal Commander.  \"'Tis Well,\" said the Most Worshipful Scribe, giving him the Grip.  Having completed the Secret work, Mr. Beasley wanted to know what he could do for Brother Winfield.  \"Remove this Pusson,\" said Mr. Winfield, pointing at the Colonel.  So it came about that He who in Apahatchie County had trained them to hop off the Sidewalk and stand Uncovered until he had passed, now suffered the Hideous Degradation of being marched downstairs by One of Them and then slammed into the Hurry-Up Wagon. Under which Circumstances the Colonel had the Rabies.  [Illustration: MR. WINFIELD]  At the Police Station he was dragged before a Magistrate and was charged with Disorderly Conduct, Carrying Concealed Weapons, Assault and Battery, Assault with Intent to Kill, and Resisting an Officer.  The Magistrate was a White Man, and to him the Colonel appealed for Justice, claiming Brotherhood as a Caucasian. He told what would have happened in Apahatchie if any Coon had dared to lay a finger on a Colonel.  Here was an opening for the Court. It must be known that the Court lived in a Ward that was Dark in one End, and he was out for the Colored Vote in "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11947"],["title","On the Edge of the War Zone (#1)"],["body","ame. On one side I looked across the valley of the Marne to the heights crowned by the bombarded towns. On the other I looked across the valley of the Grande Morin, where, on the heights behind the trees, I knew little towns like Coutevoult and Montbarbin were evacuated. In the valley at the foot of the hill, Couilly and St. Germain, Montry and Esbly were equally deserted. No smoke rose above the red roofs. Not a soul was on the roads. Even the railway station was closed, and the empty cars stood, locked, on the side- tracks. It was strangely silent.  I don't know how many people there are at Voisins. I hear that there is no one at Quincy. As for Huiry? Well, our population--everyone accounted for before the mobilization--was twenty-nine. The hamlet consists of only nine houses. Today we are six grown people and seven children.  There is no doctor if one should be so silly as to fall ill. There are no civil authorities to make out a death certificate if one had the bad taste to die--and one can't die informally in France. If anyone should, so far as I can see, he would have to walk to his grave, dig it, and lie down in it himself, and that would be a scandal, and I am positive it would lead to a procès. The French love lawsuits, you know. No respectable family is ever without one.  However, there has not been a case of illness in our little community since we were cut off from the rest of the world.  Somehow, at times, in the silence, I get a strange sensation of unreality--the sort of intense feeling of its all being a dream. I wish I didn't. I wonder if that is not Nature's narcotic for all experiences outside those we are to expect from Life, which, in its normal course, has tragedies enough.  Then again, sometimes, in the night, I have a sensation as if I were getting a special view of a really magnificent spectacle to which the rest of \"my set\" had not been invited--as if I were seeing it at a risk, but determined to see it through.  I can imagine you, wrinkling your brows at me and telling me that that frame of mind comes of my theatre-going habit. Well, it is not worth while arguing it out. I can't. There is a kind of veil over it.  Nor were the day's mental adventures over.  I was just back from my promenade when my little French friend from the foot of the hill came to the door. I call her \"my little friend,\" though she is taller than I am, because she is only half my age. She came with the proposition that I should harness Ninette and go with her out to the battlefield, where, she said, they were sadly in need of help.  I asked her how she knew, and she replied that one of our old men had been across the river and brought back the news that the field ambulance at Neufmortier was short of nurses, and that it was thought that there were still many wounded men in the woods who had not yet been picked up.  I asked her if any official call for help had come. She said \"No,\" but she presented so strong a case in favor of volunteering that, at first, it seemed to me that there was nothing to do but go, and go quickly.  But before she got outside the gate I rushed after her to tell her that it seemed impossible,--that I knew they didn't want an old lady like me, however willing, an old lady very unsteady on her feet, absolutely ignorant of the simplest rules of \"first aid to the wounded,\" that they needed skilled and tried people, that we not only could not lend efficient aid, but should be a nuisance, even if, which I doubted, we were allowed to cross the Marne.  All the time I was explaining myself, with that diabolical dual consciousness which makes us spectator and listener to ourselves, in the back of my brain--or my soul--was running this query: \"I wonder what a raw battlefield looks like? I have a chance to see if I want to-- perhaps.\" I suppose that was an attack of involuntary, unpremeditated curiosity. I did not want to go.  I wonder if that was not the sort of thing which, if told in the confessional in ancient times, got one convicted of being \"possessed of the devil\"?  Of course Mlle. Henriette was terribly disappointed. Her mother would not let her go without me. I imagine the wise lady knew that I would not go. She tried to insist, but my mind was made up.  She argued that we could \"hunt for the dead,\" and \"carry consolation to the dying.\" I shook my head. I even had to cut the argument short by going into the house. I felt an imperative need to get the door closed between us. The habit I have--you know it well, it is often enough disconcerting to me--of getting an ill-timed comic picture in my mind, made me afraid that I was going to laugh at the wrong moment. If I had, I should never have been able to explain to her, and hope to be understood.  The truth was that I had a sudden, cinematographical vision of my chubby self--me, who cannot walk half a mile, nor bend over without getting palpitation--stumbling in my high-heeled shoes over the fields ploughed by cavalry and shell--breathlessly bent on carrying consolation to the dying. I knew that I should surely have to be picked up with the dead and dying, or, worse still, usurp a place in an ambulance, unless eternal justice--in spite of my age, my sex, and my white hairs--left me lying where I fell--and serve me good and right!  I know now that if the need and opportunity had come to my gate--as it might--I should, instinctively, have known what to do, and have done it. But for me to drive deliberately nine miles--we should have had to make a wide detour to cross the Marne on the pontoons-- behind a donkey who travels two miles an hour, to seek such an experience, and with several hours to think it over en route, and the conviction that I would be an unwelcome intruder--that was another matter.  I am afraid Mlle. Henriette will never forgive me. She will soon be walking around in a hospital, looking so pretty in her nurse's dress and veil. But she will always think that she lost a great opportunity that day--and a picturesque one.  By the way, I have a new inmate in my house--a kitten. He was evidently lost during the emigration. Amélie says he is three months old. He arrived at her door crying with hunger the other morning. Amélie loves beasties better than humans. She took him in and fed him. But as she has six cats already, she seemed to think that it was my duty to take this one. She cloaked that idea in the statement that it was \"good for me\" to have \"something alive\" moving about me in the silent little house. So she put him in my lap. He settled himself down, went to sleep, and showed no inclination to leave me.  At the end of two hours he owned me--the very first cat I ever knew, except by sight.  So you may dismiss that idea which torments you--I am no longer alone.  I am going to send this letter at once to be dropped in the box in front of the post-office, where I am very much afraid it may find that of last week, for we have had no letters yet nor have I seen or heard anything of the promised automobile postale. However, once a stamped letter is out of my hand, I always feel at least as if it had started, though in all probability this may rest indefinitely in that box in the \"deserted village.\"     II  September 25, 1914   IT is over a week since I wrote you. But I have really been very busy, and not had a moment.  To begin with, the very day after I wrote to you, Amélie came down with one of her sick headaches, and she has the most complete sort I ever met.  She crawled upstairs that morning to open my blinds. I gave one look at her, and ordered her back to bed. If there is anything that can make one look worse than a first-class bilious attack I have never met it. One can walk round and do things when one is suffering all sorts of pain, or when one is trembling in every nerve, or when one is dying of consumption, but I defy anyone to be useful when one has an active sick headache.  Amélie protested, of course; \"the work must be done.\" I did not see why it had to be. She argued that I was the mistress, \"had a right to be attended to--had a right to expect it.\" I did not see that either. I told her that her logic was false. She clinched it, as she thought, by declaring that I looked as if I needed to be taken care of.  I was indignant. I demanded the handglass, gave one look at myself, and I was inclined to let it slide off the bed to the floor, à la Camille, only Amélie would not have seen the joke. I did look old and seedy. But what of that? Of course Amélie does not know yet that I am like the \"Deacon's One Hoss Shay\"--I may look dilapidated, but so long as I do not absolutely drop apart, I can go.  So I told Amélie that if I were the mistress, I had a right to be obeyed, and that there were times when there was no question of mistress and maid, that this was one of those times, that she had been a trump and a brick, and other nice things, and that the one thing I needed was to work with my own hands. She finally yielded, but not to my arguments--to Nature.  Perhaps owing to the excitement of three weeks, perhaps to the fact that she had worked too hard in the sun, and also, it may be, owing to the long run she took, of which I wrote you in my letter of last week, it is the worst attack I ever saw. I can tell you I wished for a doctor, and she is even now only a little better.  However, I have had what we used to call \"a real nice time playing house.\" Having nothing else to do, I really enjoyed it. I have swept and dusted, and handled all my little treasures, touching everything with a queer sensation--it had all become so very precious. All the time my thoughts flew back to the past. That is the prettiest thing about housework--one can think of such nice things when one is working with one's hands, and is alone. I don't wonder Burns wrote verses as he followed the plough--if he really did.  I think I forgot to tell you in my letter of last week that the people-- drummed out of the towns on the other side of the Marne, that"]]]
