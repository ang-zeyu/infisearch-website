We washed our greasy moleskins     On the banks of the Condamine.--  Somebody tackling the “Old Bullock Dray”; it must be over fifty verses now. I saw a bushman at a country dance start to sing that song; he'd get up to ten or fifteen verses, break down, and start afresh. At last he sat down on his heel to it, in the centre of the clear floor, resting his wrist on his knee, and keeping time with an index finger. It was very funny, but the thing was taken seriously all through.  Irreverent echo from the old Lambing Flat trouble, from camp across the gully:      Rule Britannia!  Britannia rules the waves!     No more Chinamen will enter Noo South Wales!  and      Yankee Doodle came to town      On a little pony--     Stick a feather in his cap,      And call him Maccaroni!  All the camps seem to be singing to-night:      Ring the bell, watchman!      Ring! Ring! Ring!     Ring, for the good news      Is now on the wing!  Good lines, the introduction:      High on the belfry the old sexton stands,     Grasping the rope with his thin bony hands!...     Bon-fires are blazing throughout the land...     Glorious and blessed tidings!  Ring!  Ring the bell!      .   .   .   .   .  Granny Mathews fails to coax her niece into the kitchen, but persuades her to sing inside. She is the girl who learnt 'sub rosa' from the bad girl who sang “Madeline”. Such as have them on instinctively take their hats off. Diggers, &c., strolling past, halt at the first notes of the girl's voice, and stand like statues in the moonlight:      Shall we gather at the river,      Where bright angel feet have trod?     The beautiful--the beautiful river      That flows by the throne of God!--  Diggers wanted to send that girl “Home”, but Granny Mathews had the old-fashioned horror of any of her children becoming “public”--       Gather with the saints at the river,      That flows by the throne of God!      .   .   .   .   .  But it grows late, or rather, early. The “Eyetalians” go by in the frosty moonlight, from their last shift in the claim (for it is Saturday night), singing a litany.  “Get up on one end, Abe!--stand up all!” Hands are clasped across the kitchen table. Redclay, one of the last of the alluvial fields, has petered out, and the Roaring Days are dying.... The grand old song that is known all over the world; yet how many in ten thousand know more than one verse and the chorus? Let Peter McKenzie lead:      Should auld acquaintance be forgot,     And never brought to min'?  And hearts echo from far back in the past and across wide, wide seas:      Should auld acquaintance be forgot,     And days o' lang syne?  Now boys! all together!      For auld lang syne, my dear,      For auld lang syne,     We'll tak' a cup o' kindness yet,      For auld lang syne.      We twa hae run about the braes,      And pu'd the gowans fine;     But we've wandered mony a weary foot,      Sin' auld lang syne.  The world was wide then.      We twa hae paidl't i' the burn,      Frae mornin' sun till dine:  the log fire seems to grow watery, for in wide, lonely Australia--     But seas between us braid hae roar'd,      Sin' auld lang syne.  The kitchen grows dimmer, and the forms of the digger-singers seemed suddenly vague and unsubstantial, fading back rapidly through a misty veil. But the words ring strong and defiant through hard years:      And here's a hand, my trusty frien',      And gie's a grup o' thine;     And we'll tak' a cup o' kindness yet,      For auld lang syne.      .   .   .   .   .  And the nettles have been growing for over twenty years on the spot where Granny Mathews' big bark kitchen stood.     A Vision of Sandy Blight   I'd been humping my back, and crouching and groaning for an hour or so in the darkest corner of the travellers' hut, tortured by the demon of sandy blight. It was too hot to travel, and there was no one there except ourselves and Mitchell's cattle pup. We were waiting till after sundown, for I couldn't have travelled in the daylight, anyway. Mitchell had tied a wet towel round my eyes, and led me for the last mile or two by another towel--one end fastened to his belt behind, and the other in my hand as I walked in his tracks. And oh! but this was a relief! It was out of the dust and glare, and the flies didn't come into the dark hut, and I could hump and stick my knees in my eyes and groan in comfort. I didn't want a thousand a year, or anything; I only wanted relief for my eyes--that was all I prayed for in this world. When the sun got down a bit, Mitchell started poking round, and presently he found amongst the rubbish a dirty-looking medicine bottle, corked tight; when he rubbed the dirt off a piece of notepaper that was pasted on, he saw “eye-water”  written on it. He drew the cork with his teeth, smelt the water, stuck his little finger in, turned the bottle upside down, tasted the top of his finger, and reckoned the stuff was all right.  “Here! Wake up, Joe!” he shouted. “Here's a bottle of tears.”  “A bottler wot?” I groaned.  “Eye-water,” said Mitchell.  “Are you sure it's all right?” I didn't want to be poisoned or have my eyes burnt out by mistake; perhaps some burning acid had got into that bottle, or the label had been put on, or left on, in mistake or carelessness.  “I dunno,” said Mitchell, “but there's no harm in tryin'.”  I chanced it. I lay down on my back in a bunk, and Mitchell dragged my lids up and spilt half a bottle of eye-water over my eye-balls.  The relief was almost instantaneous. I never experienced such a quick cure in my life. I carried the bottle in my swag for a long time afterwards, with an idea of getting it analysed, but left it behind at last in a camp.  Mitchell scratched his head thoughtfully, and watched me for a while.  “I think I'll wait a bit longer,” he said at last, “and if it doesn't blind you I'll put some in my eyes. I'm getting a touch of blight myself now. That's the fault of travelling with a mate who's always catching something that's no good to him.”  As it grew dark outside we talked of sandy-blight and fly-bite, and sand-flies up north, and ordinary flies, and branched off to Barcoo rot, and struck the track again at bees and bee stings. When we got to bees, Mitchell sat smoking for a while and looking dreamily backwards along tracks and branch tracks, and round corners and circles he had travelled, right back to the short, narrow, innocent bit of track that ends in a vague, misty point--like the end of a long, straight, cleared road in the moonlight--as far back as we can remember.      .   .   .   .   .  “I had about fourteen hives,” said Mitchell--“we used to call them 'swarms', no matter whether they were flying or in the box--when I left home first time. I kept them behind the shed, in the shade, on tables of galvanised iron cases turned down on stakes; but I had to make legs later on, and stand them in pans of water, on account of the ants. When the bees swarmed--and some hives sent out the Lord knows how many swarms in a year, it seemed to me--we'd tin-kettle 'em, and throw water on 'em, to make 'em believe the biggest thunderstorm was coming to drown the oldest inhabitant; and, if they didn't get the start of us and rise, they'd settle on a branch--generally on one of the scraggy fruit trees. It was rough on the bees--come to think of it; their instinct told them it was going to be fine, and the noise and water told them it was raining. They must have thought that nature was mad, drunk, or gone ratty, or the end of the world had come. We'd rig up a table, with a box upside down, under the branch, cover our face with a piece of mosquito net, have rags burning round, and then give the branch a sudden jerk, turn the box down, and run. If we got most of the bees in, the rest that were hanging to the bough or flying round would follow, and then we reckoned we'd shook the queen in. If the bees in the box came out and joined the others, we'd reckon we hadn't shook the queen in, and go for them again. When a hive was full of honey we'd turn the box upside down, turn the empty box mouth down on top of it, and drum and hammer on the lower box with a stick till all the bees went up into the top box. I suppose it made their heads ache, and they went up on that account.  “I suppose things are done differently on proper bee-farms. I've heard that a bee-farmer will part a hanging swarm with his fingers, take out the queen bee and arrange matters with her; but our ways suited us, and there was a lot of expectation and running and excitement in it, especially when a swarm took us by surprise. The yell of 'Bees swarmin'!' was as good to us as the yell of 'Fight!' is now, or 'Bolt!' in town, or 'Fire' or 'Man overboard!' at sea.  “There was tons of honey. The bees used to go to the vineyards at wine-making and get honey from the heaps of crushed grape-skins thrown out in the sun, and get so drunk sometimes that they wobbled in their bee-lines home. They'd fill all the boxes, and then build in between and under the bark, and board, and tin covers. They never seemed to get the idea out of their heads that this wasn't an evergreen country, and it wasn't going to snow all winter. My younger brother Joe used to put pieces of meat on the tables near the boxes, and in front of the holes where the bees went in and out, for the dogs to grab at. But one old dog, 'Black Bill', was a match for him; if it was worth Bill's while, he'd camp there, and keep Joe and the other dogs from touching the meat--once it was put down--till the bees turned in for the night. And Joe would get the other kids round there, and when they weren't looking or thinking, he'd brush the bees with a stick and run. I'd lam him when I caught him at it. He was an awful young devil, was Joe, and he grew up steady, and respectable, and respected--and I went to the bad. I never trust a good boy now.... Ah, well!  “I remember the first swarm"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12317"],["title","Two Little Knights of Kentucky (#1)"],["body"," his fur is, like mamma's beaver jacket. And he has the kindest old face. Poor old fellow, is you hungry? Never mind, Keith'll get you something to eat pretty soon.\"  Putting his short, plump arms around the animal's neck, he hugged it lovingly up to him. A cunning gleam came into the man's eyes. He saw that he had gained the younger boy's sympathy, and he wanted Malcolm's also.  \"Is your home near here, my little gen'leman?\" he asked, in a friendly tone.  \"No, we live in the city,\" answered Malcolm, \"but my grandmother's place, where we are staying, is not far from here.\" He was stroking the bear with one hand as he spoke, and hunting in his pocket with the other, hoping to find some stray peanuts to give it.  \"Then maybe you know of some place where we could stay to-night. Even a shed to crawl into would keep us from freezing. It's an awful cold night not to have a roof over your head, or a crust to gnaw on, or a spark of fire to keep life in your body.\"  \"Maybe they'd let you stay in the waiting-room,\" suggested Malcolm. \"It is always good and warm in here. I'll ask the station-master. He's a friend of mine.\"  \"Oh, no! No, don't!\" exclaimed the tramp, hastily, pulling his old hat farther over his forehead, as if to hide the scar, and looking uneasily around. \"I wouldn't have you do that for anything. I've had dealings with such folks before, and I know how they'd treat _me_. I thought maybe there was a barn or a hay-shed or something on your grandmother's place, where we could lay up for repairs a couple of days. The beast needs a rest. Its foot's sore; and Jonesy there is pretty near to lung fever, judging from the way he coughs.\" He nodded toward the boy, who had placed his chair as close to the stove as possible. The child's face was drawn into a pucker by the tingling pains in his half-frozen feet, and his efforts to keep from coughing.  Malcolm looked at him steadily. He had read about boys who were homeless and hungry and cold, but he had never really understood how much it meant to be all that. This was the first time in his ten short years that he had ever come close to real poverty. He had seen the swarms of beggars that infest such cities as Naples and Rome, and had tossed them coppers because that seemed a part of the programme in travelling. He had not really felt sorry for them, for they did not seem to mind it. They sat on the steps in the warm Italian sunshine, and waited for tourists to throw them money, as comfortably as toads sit blinking at flies. But this was different. A wave of pity swept through Malcolm's generous little heart as he looked at Jonesy, and the man watching him shrewdly saw it.  \"Of course,\" he whined, \"a little gen'leman like you don't know what it is to go from town to town and have every door shut in your face. You don't think that this is a hard-hearted, stingy old world, because it has given you the cream of everything. But if you'd never had anything all your life but other people's scraps and leavings, and you hadn't any home or friends or money, and was sick besides, you'd think things wasn't very evenly divided. Wouldn't you now? You'd think it wasn't right that some should have all that heart can wish, and others not enough to keep soul and body together. If you'd a-happened to be Jonesy, and Jonesy had a-happened to 'a' been you, I reckon you'd feel it was pretty tough to see such a big difference between you. It doesn't seem fair now, does it?\"  \"No,\" admitted Malcolm, faintly. He had taken a dislike to the man. He could not have told why, but his child instinct armed him with a sudden distrust. Still, he felt the force of the whining appeal, and the burden of an obligation to help them seemed laid upon his shoulders.  \"Grandmother is afraid for anybody to sleep in the barn, on account of fire,\" he said, after a moment's thought, \"and I'm sure she wouldn't let you come into the house without you'd had a bath and some clean clothes. Grandmother is dreadfully particular,\" he added, hastily, not wanting to be impolite even to a tramp. \"Seems to me Keith and I have to spend half our time washing our hands and putting on clean collars.\"  \"Oh, I know a place,\" cried Keith. \"There's that empty cabin down by the spring-house. Nobody has lived in it since the new servants' cottage was built. There isn't any furniture in it, but there's a fireplace in one room, and it would be warmer than the barn.\"  \"That's just the trick!\" exclaimed Malcolm. \"We can carry a pile of hay over from the barn for you to sleep on. Aunt Allison will be out on this next train and I'll ask her. I am sure she will let you, because last night, when it was so cold, she said she felt sorry for anything that had to be out in it, even the poor old cedar trees, with the sleet on their branches. She said that it was King Lear's own weather, and she could understand how Cordelia felt when she said, _'Mine enemy's dog, though he had bit me, should have stood that night against my fire!'_ It is just like auntie to feel that way about it, only she's so good to everybody she couldn't have any enemies.\"  Something like a smile moved the tramp's stubby beard. \"So she's that kind, is she? Well, if she could have a soft spot for a dog that had bit her, and an enemy's dog at that, it stands to reason that she wouldn't object to some harmless travellers a-sleeping in an empty cabin a couple of nights. S'pose'n you show us the place, sonny, and we'll be moving on.\"  \"Oh, it wouldn't be right not to ask her first,\" exclaimed Malcolm. \"She'll be here in such a little while.\"  The man looked uneasy. Presently he walked over to the window and scraped a peep-hole on the frosted pane with his dirty thumbnail. \"Sun's down,\" he said. \"I'd like to get that bear's foot fixed comfortable before it grows any darker. I'd like to mighty well. It'll take some time to heat water to dress it. Is that cabin far from here?\"  \"Not if we go in at the back of the place,\" said Malcolm. \"It's just across the meadow, and over a little hill. If we went around by the big front gate it would be a good deal longer.\"  The man shifted uneasily from one foot to another, and complained of being hungry. He was growing desperate. For more reasons than one he did not want to be at the station when the train came in. That long red scar across his face had been described a number of times in the newspapers, and he did not care to be recognised just then.  The boys could not have told how it came about, but in a few minutes they were leading the way toward the cabin. The man had persuaded them that it was not at all necessary to wait for their Aunt Allison's permission, and that it was needless to trouble their grandmother. Why should the ladies be bothered about a matter that the boys were old enough to decide? So well had he argued, and so tactfully had he flattered them, that when they took their way across the field, it was with the feeling that they were doing their highest duty in getting these homeless wayfarers to the cabin as quickly as possible, on their own responsibility.  [Illustration: \"ACROSS THE SNOWY FIELDS.\"]  \"We can get back in time to meet the train, if we hurry,\" said Malcolm, looking at his watch again. \"There's still fifteen minutes.\"  No one saw the little procession file out of the waiting-room and across the snowy field, for it was growing dark, and the lamps were lighted and the curtains drawn in the few houses they passed. Malcolm went first, proudly leading the friendly old bear. Jonesy came next beside Keith, and the man shuffled along in the rear, looking around with suspicious glances whenever a twig snapped, or a distant dog barked.  As the wind struck against Jonesy's body, he drew the bit of blanket more closely around him, and coughed hoarsely. His teeth were chattering and his lips blue. \"You look nearly frozen,\" said Keith, who, well-clad and well-fed, scarcely felt the cold. \"Here! put this on, or you'll be sick,\" Unbuttoning his thick little reefer, he pulled it off and tied its sleeves around Jonesy's neck.  A strange look passed over the face of the man behind them. \"Blessed if the little kid didn't take it off his own back,\" he muttered. \"If any man had ever done that for me--just once--well, maybe, I wouldn't ha' been what I am now!\"  For a moment, as they reached the top of the hill, bear, boys, and man were outlined blackly against the sky like strange silhouettes. Then they passed over and disappeared in the thick clump of pine-trees, which hid the little cabin from the eyes of the surrounding world.    CHAPTER II.  GINGER AND THE BOYS.  In less time than one would think possible, a big fire was roaring in the cabin fireplace, water was steaming in the rusty kettle on the crane, and a pile of hay and old carpet lay in one corner, ready to be made into a bed. Keith had made several trips to the kitchen, and came back each time with his hands full.  Old Daphne, the cook, never could find it in her heart to refuse \"Marse Sydney's\" boys anything. They were too much like what their father had been at their age to resist their playful coaxing. She had nursed him when he was a baby, and had been his loyal champion all through his boyhood. Now her black face wrinkled into smiles whenever she heard his name spoken. In her eyes, nobody was quite so near perfection as he, except, perhaps, the fair woman whom he had married.  \"Kain't nobody in ten States hole a can'le to my Marse Sidney an' his Miss Elise,\" old Daphne used to say, proudly. \"They sut'n'ly is the handsomest couple evah jined togethah, an' the free-handedest. In all they travels by sea or by land they nevah fo'gits ole Daphne. I've got things from every country undah the shinin' sun what they done brung me.\"  Now, all the services she had once been proud to render them were willingly given to their little sons. When Keith came in with a pitiful tale of a tramp who was starving at their very gates, she gave him even more than he asked for, and almost "]]]
