Even the theories regarding the origin of the solar system are still conflicting and none is generally accepted.  The old nebular hypothesis is discredited and the theory of the spiral movement of the solar matter seems to be confirmed by phenomena observable in the heavens.  The one principle generally held by scientists is that, given matter and life and some creating force, our present marvelous complex universe has come into being according to laws usually called natural.  These laws are so invariable that they may be considered unchanging.  Even more definitely established is the so-called theory of evolution which is based on the careful observation and comparison of countless thousands of natural phenomena.  According to the Encyclopedia Britannica it is the history of the physical process by which all living beings have acquired the characteristics, physical, mental, moral, and spiritual, which now distinguish them. It recognizes the gradual development from the simplest to the most complex forms.  It is merely an attempt to describe in the light of careful observation and investigation the process of growth by which the world and the beings which inhabit it have grown into what they are.  A comparison of the Hebrew account of creation with those of other races and times is extremely suggestive.   II.  THE PRIESTLY STORY OF CREATION.  Note that the first and second chapters of Genesis contain two distinct accounts of creation.  Read Genesis 1:1--2:3 (see _Hist. Bib_., I, pp. 231-3 for modern translation), noting its picture of conditions in the universe before the actual work of creation began.  The creative power is the spirit or breath of God.  The Hebrew word for spirit (_ruah_) represents the sound of the breath as it emerges from the mouth or the sound of the wind as it sighs through the trees.  It is the effective symbol of a real and mighty force that cannot be seen or touched yet produces terrific effects, as when the cyclone rends the forest or transforms the sea into a mountain of billows and twists like straws the masts of wood and steel.  In the Old Testament the \"spirit of God\" or the \"spirit of the Holy One\" is God working (1) in the material universe, as in the work of creation, (2) in human history, as when he directs the life of nations, or (3) in the lives of men.  Note the method of creation and the distinctive work of each day. The process is that of separation.  It is orderly and progressive. The first three days of preparation in which (1) light and darkness, (2) air and water (separated by the firmament) and (3) land and vegetation are created, correspond to the work of the second three days in which are created (1) the heavenly bodies, (2) the birds and fishes (which live in the air and water) and (3) land animals and man.  The underlying conception of the universe is that held by most early peoples.  Compare the diagram in _Hastings' Dictionary of the Bible_ I, 503 or Kent's _Student's Old Testament_, Vol. I, p.  52 which illustrates it.  God's benign plan is revealed by the recurring words: \"God saw that it was good.\"  What was the culminating act of creation?  \"Created man in his image\" can not mean with a body like that of God (for in this story God is thought of as a spirit), but rather with a God-like spirit, mind, will, and power to rule.   III  THE EARLY PROPHETIC STORY OF CREATION.  The opening words of the second account of creation, which begins in the fourth verse of the second chapter of Genesis, imply that the earth and the heavens have already been created.  \"In the day that Jehovah made earth and heaven, no plant of the field was yet on the earth, and no herb of the field had yet sprung up, for Jehovah had not caused it to rain upon the earth, and there was no man to till the ground; but a mist used to rise from the earth and water the whole face of the ground.\"  It is possible that here only a part of the original story is preserved.  What is the order in the story of creation found in this second chapter?  The method of man's creation?  According to this account, the tree of life was planted in the garden that man, while he lived there, might enjoy immortality. Was the tree of the knowledge of good and evil placed in the garden to develop man's moral nature by temptation or merely to inculcate obedience?  The love between the sexes is apparently implanted in all living beings primarily for the conservation of the species, but the early prophet also recognized clearly the broader intellectual and moral aspects of the relation.  \"It is not good for man to be alone\" were the significant words of Jehovah.  Hence animals, birds, and, last of all, woman, were created to meet man's innate social needs. Man's words on seeing woman were:    \"This, now, is bone of my bone     And flesh of my flesh.   This one shall be called woman,     For from man was she taken.\"  What fundamental explanation is here given of the institution of marriage?  Compare Jesus' confirmation of this teaching in Matthew 19:4-5:  \"And he answered and said, Have ye not read, that he who made them from the beginning made them male and female, and said, For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife: and the two shall become one flesh?\"   IV.  A COMPARISON OF THE TWO ACCOUNTS OF CREATION.  The account of creation found in the second chapter suggests the simple, direct ideas of a primitive people; while the account in Genesis 1 has the exact, repetitious, majestic literary style of a legal writer.  Are the differences between these two accounts of creation greater than those between the parallel narratives in the Gospels?  We recognize that the differences in detail between the Gospel accounts of the same event are due to the fact that no two narrators tell the same story in the same way.  Are the variations between the two Biblical accounts of creation to be similarly explained?  A growing body of Biblical scholars hold, though many differ in judgment, that the account in the first chapter of Genesis was written by a priestly writer who lived about four hundred B.C., and the second account four hundred years earlier by a patriotic, prophetic historian.  Observe that the two accounts agree in the following fundamental teachings: (1) One supreme God is the Creator; (2) man is closely akin to God; (3) all else is created for man's best and noblest development.  Is the primary aim of these accounts to present scientific facts or to teach religious truths?  Paul says in Timothy that \"Every scripture inspired of God is also profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, for instruction which is in righteousness.\"  Is their religious value, even as in the parables of the New Testament, entirely independent of their historical or scientific accuracy?  Is there any contradiction between the distinctive teachings of the Bible and modern science?  Do not the Bible and science deal with two different but supplemental fields of life: the one with religion and morals, the other with the physical world?   V.  MAN'S CONQUEST AND RULERSHIP OF THE WORLD.  In the story of Genesis 1 man is commanded to subdue the earth and to have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the heavens and over every living thing that creeps upon the earth. How far has man already subdued the animals and made them serve him? How far has he conquered the so-called natural forces and learned to utilize them?  Is the latter day conquest of the air but a step in this progress?  Are all inventions and developments of science in keeping with the purpose expressed in Genesis 1?  Does the command imply the immediate or the gradual conquest of nature? Why?  Do science and the Bible differ or agree in their answers to these questions?   VI.  MAN'S RESPONSIBILITY AS THE RULER OF THE WORLD.  Consider the different ways in which the Biblical accounts of creation state that man is akin to God.  In the one account man was created in the image of God; in the other Jehovah formed man of the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils his own life-giving breath.  In what sense is man God-like?  Are all men \"made in the image of God\"?  Does this story imply that every man has the right and capacity to become God-like?  A high official of China, whose power of authority extends to questions of life and death, is called \"the father and mother of his people.\"  If he fails in the responsibility which his authority imposes upon him, and the people in consequence create a disturbance, he is severely punished, sometimes by death.  Does authority always imply responsibility?  Of what value to man is the conquest of the forces of nature?  President Roosevelt said that he considered the conservation of the natural resources of the United States the most important question before the American people.  Is this political question also a religious question?  Why did God give man authority over the animal world?  Does the responsibility that comes from this authority rest upon every man? One of the laws of the Boy Scouts reads:  \"A scout is kind.  He is a friend to animals.  He will not kill nor hurt any living creature needlessly, but will strive to save and protect all harmless life.\"  Is this a practical application of the teaching in Genesis 1?  If God's purpose is to make everything good, man's highest privilege, as well as duty, is to co-operate with him in realizing that purpose.  Are men to-day as a whole growing happier and nobler?  In what practical ways may a man contribute to the happiness and ennobling of his fellow men?  Is your community growing better?  What would be the result if you and others like yourself did your best to improve conditions?  If so, how?   _Questions for Further Consideration_.  Is man's possession of knowledge and power the ultimate object of creation?  If not, what is?  Does human experience suggest that man's life on earth is, in"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12436"],["title","The Night Horseman (#1)"],["body","the doctor, \"I have not yet decided--this precipitancy--\"  \"Oh,\" she said, and flushed. He perceived that she was on the verge of turning away, but something withheld her. \"There is no other physician within reach; my father is very ill. I only ask that you come as a diagnostician, doctor!\"  \"But a ride to your ranch,\" he said miserably. \"I presume you refer to riding a horse?\"  \"Naturally.\"  \"I am unfamiliar with that means of locomotion,\" said the doctor with serious eyes, \"and in fact have not carried my acquaintance with the equine species beyond a purely experimental stage. Anatomically I have a superficial knowledge, but on the one occasion on which I sat in a saddle I observed that the docility of the horse is probably a poetic fallacy.\"  He rubbed his left shoulder thoughtfully and saw a slight tremor at the corners of the girl's mouth. It caused his vision to clear and concentrate; he found that the lips were, in fact, in the very act of smiling. The face of the doctor brightened.  \"You shall ride my own horse,\" said the girl. \"She is perfectly gentle and has a very easy gait. I'm sure you'll have not the slightest trouble with her.\"  \"And you?\"  \"I'll find something about town; it doesn't matter what.\"  \"This,\" said the doctor, \"is most remarkable. You choose your mounts at random?\"  \"But you will go?\" she insisted.  \"Ah, yes, the trip to the ranch!\" groaned the doctor. \"Let me see: the physical obstacles to such a trip while many are not altogether insuperable, I may say; in the meantime the moral urge which compels me towards the ranch seems to be of the first order.\" He sighed. \"Is it not strange, Miss Cumberland, that man, though distinguished from the lower orders by mind, so often is controlled in his actions by ethical impulses which override the considerations of reason? An observation which leads us towards the conclusion that the passion for goodness is a principle hardly secondary to the passion for truth. Understand that I build the hypothesis only tentatively, with many reservations, among which--\"  He broke off short. The smile was growing upon her lips.  \"I will put together a few of my things,\" said the doctor, \"and come down to you at once.\"  \"Good!\" said the girl, \"I'll be waiting for you with two horses before you are ready.\"  He turned away, but had taken hardly a step before he turned, saying: \"But why are you so sure that you will be ready before I--\" but she was already down the steps from the veranda and stepping briskly down the street.  \"There is an element of the unexplainable in woman,\" said the doctor, and resumed his way to his room. Once there, something prompted him to act with the greatest possible speed. He tossed his toilet articles and a few changes of linen into a small, flexible valise and ran down the stairs. He reached the veranda again, panting, and the girl was not in sight; a smile of triumph appeared on the grave, colourless lips of the doctor. \"Feminine instinct, however, is not infallible,\" he observed to himself, and to one of the cowboys, lounging loosely in a chair nearby, he continued his train of thoughts aloud: \"Though the verity of the feminine intuition has already been thrown in a shade of doubt by many thinkers, as you will undoubtedly agree.\"  The man thus addressed allowed his lower jaw to drop but after a moment he ejaculated: \"Now what in hell d'you mean by that?\"  The doctor already turned away, intent upon his thoughts, but he now paused and again faced the cowboy. He said, frowning: \"There is unnecessary violence in your remark, sir.\"  \"Duck your glasses,\" said the worthy in question. \"You ain't talkin' to a book, you're talking to a man.\"  \"And in your attitude,\" went on the doctor, \"there is an element of offense which if carried farther might be corrected by physical violence.\"  \"I don't foller your words,\" said the cattleman, \"but from the drift of your tune I gather you're a bit peeved; and if you are--\"  His voice had risen to a ringing note as he proceeded and he now slipped from his chair and faced Randall Byrne, a big man, brown, hard-handed. The doctor crimsoned.  \"Well?\" he echoed, but in place of a deep ring his words were pitched in a high squeak of defiance.  He saw a large hand contract to a fist, but almost instantly the big man grinned, and his eyes went past Byrne.  \"Oh, hell!\" he grunted, and turned his back with a chuckle.  For an instant there was a mad impulse in the doctor to spring at this fellow but a wave of impotence overwhelmed him. He knew that he was white around the mouth, and there was a dryness in his throat.  \"The excitement of imminent physical contest and personal danger,\" he diagnosed swiftly, \"causing acceleration of the pulse and attendant weakness of the body--a state unworthy of the balanced intellect.\"  Having brought back his poise by this quick interposition of reason, he went his way down the long veranda. Against a pillar leaned another tall cattleman, also brown and lean and hard.  \"May I inquire,\" he said, \"if you have any information direct or casual concerning a family named Cumberland which possesses ranch property in this vicinity?\"  \"You may,\" said the cowpuncher, and continued to roll his cigarette.  \"Well,\" said the doctor, \"do you know anything about them?\"  \"Sure,\" said the other, and having finished his cigarette he introduced it between his lips. It seemed to occur to him instantly, however, that he was committing an inhospitable breach, for he produced his Durham and brown papers with a start and extended them towards the doctor.  \"Smoke?\" he asked.  \"I use tobacco in no form,\" said the doctor.  The cowboy stared with such fixity that the match burned down to his fingertips and singed them before he had lighted his cigarette.  \"'S that a fact?\" he queried when his astonishment found utterance. \"What d'you do to kill time? Well, I been thinking about knocking off the stuff for a while. Mame gets sore at me for having my fingers all stained up with nicotine like this.\"  He extended his hand, the first and second fingers of which were painted a bright yellow.  \"Soap won't take it off,\" he remarked.  \"A popular but inexcusable error,\" said the doctor. \"It is the tarry by-products of tobacco which cause that stain. Nicotine itself, of course, is a volatile alkaloid base of which there is only the merest trace in tobacco. It is one of the deadliest of nerve poisons and is quite colourless. There is enough of that stain upon your fingers--if it were nicotine--to kill a dozen men.\"  \"The hell you say!\"  \"Nevertheless, it is an indubitable fact. A lump of nicotine the size of the head of a pin placed on the tongue of a horse will kill the beast instantly.\"  The cowpuncher pushed back his hat and scratched his head.  \"This is worth knowin',\" he said, \"but I'm some glad that Mame ain't heard it.\"  \"Concerning the Cumberlands,\" said the doctor, \"I--\"  \"Concerning the Cumberlands,\" repeated the cattleman, \"it's best to leave 'em to their own concerns.\" And he started to turn away, but the thirst for knowledge was dry in the throat of the doctor.  \"Do I understand,\" he insisted, \"that there is some mystery connected with them?\"  \"From me,\" replied the other, \"you understand nothin'.\" And he lumbered down the steps and away.  Be it understood that there was nothing of the gossip in Randall Byrne, but now he was pardonably excited and perceiving the tall form of Hank Dwight in the doorway he approached his host.  \"Mr. Dwight,\" he said, \"I am about to go to the Cumberland ranch. I gather that there is something of an unusual nature concerning them.\"  \"There is,\" admitted Hank Dwight.  \"Can you tell me what it is?\"  \"I can.\"  \"Good!\" said the doctor, and he almost smiled. \"It is always well to know the background of a case which has to do with mental states. Now, just what do you know?\"  \"I know--\" began the proprietor, and then paused and eyed his guest dubiously. \"I know,\" he continued, \"a story.\"  \"Yes?\"  \"Yes, about a man and a hoss and a dog.\"  \"The approach seems not quite obvious, but I shall be glad to hear it.\"  There was a pause.  \"Words,\" said the host, at length, \"is worse'n bullets. You never know what they'll hit.\"  \"But the story?\" persisted Randall Byrne.  \"That story,\" said Hank Dwight, \"I may tell to my son before I die.\"  \"This sounds quite promising.\"  \"But I'll tell nobody else.\"  \"Really!\"  \"It's about a man and a hoss and a dog. The man ain't possible, the hoss ain't possible, the dog is a wolf.\"  He paused again and glowered on the doctor. He seemed to be drawn two ways, by his eagerness to tell a yarn and his dread of consequences.  \"I know,\" he muttered, \"because I've seen 'em all. I've seen\"--he looked far, as though striking a silent bargain with himself concerning the sum of the story which might safely be told--\"I've seen a hoss that understood a man's talk like you and me does--or better. I've heard a man whistle like a singing bird. Yep, that ain't no lie. You jest imagine a bald eagle that could lick anything between the earth and the sky and was able to sing--that's what that whistlin' was like. It made you glad to hear it, and it made you look to see if your gun was in good workin' shape. It wasn't very loud, but it travelled pretty far, like it was comin' from up above you.\"  \"That's the way this strange man of the story whistles?\" asked Byrne, leaning closer.  \"Man of the story?\" echoed the proprietor, with some warmth. \"Friend, if he ain't real, then I'm a ghost. And they's them in Elkhead that's got the scars of his comin' and goin'.\"  \"Ah, an outlaw? A gunfighter?\" queried the doctor.  \"Listen to me, son,\" observed the host, and to make his point he tapped the hollow chest of Byrne with a rigid forefinger, \"around these parts you know jest as much as you see, and lots of times you don't even know that much. What you see is sometimes your business, but mostly it ain't.\" He concluded impressively: \"Words is worse'n bullets!\"  \"Well,\" mused Byrne, \"I"]]]
