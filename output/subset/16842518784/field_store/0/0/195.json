Not a word was said. Blaize Shotterel, the porter, and old Josyna, his mother, together with Patience, the other woman-servant, betook themselves silently, and with troubled countenances, to the kitchen. Leonard Holt, the apprentice, lingered for a moment to catch a glance from the soft blue eyes of Amabel, the grocer's eldest daughter (for even the plague was a secondary consideration with him when she was present), and failing in the attempt, he heaved a deep sigh, which was luckily laid to the account of the discourse he had just listened to by his sharp-sighted master, and proceeded to the shop, where he busied himself in arranging matters for the night.  Having just completed his twenty-first year, and his apprenticeship being within a few months of its expiration, Leonard Holt began to think of returning to his native town of Manchester, where he intended to settle, and where he had once fondly hoped the fair Amabel would accompany him, in the character of his bride. Not that he had ever ventured to declare his passion, nor that he had received sufficient encouragement to make it matter of certainty that if he did so declare himself, he should be accepted; but being both \"proper and tall,\" and having tolerable confidence in his good looks, he had made himself, up to a short time prior to his introduction to the reader, quite easy on the point.  His present misgivings were occasioned by Amabel's altered manner towards him, and by a rival who, he had reason to fear, had completely superseded him in her good graces. Brought up together from an early age, the grocer's daughter and the young apprentice had at first regarded each other as brother and sister. By degrees, the feeling changed; Amabel became more reserved, and held little intercourse with Leonard, who, busied with his own concerns, thought little about her. But, as he grew towards manhood, he could not remain insensible to her extraordinary beauty--for extraordinary it was, and such as to attract admiration wherever she went, so that the \"Grocer's Daughter\" became the toast among the ruffling gallants of the town, many of whom sought to obtain speech with her. Her parents, however, were far too careful to permit any such approach. Amabel's stature was lofty; her limbs slight, but exquisitely symmetrical; her features small, and cast in the most delicate mould; her eyes of the softest blue; and her hair luxuriant, and of the finest texture and richest brown. Her other beauties must be left to the imagination; but it ought not to be omitted that she was barely eighteen, and had all the freshness, the innocence, and vivacity of that most charming period of woman's existence. No wonder she ravished every heart. No wonder, in an age when love-making was more general even than now, that she was beset by admirers. No wonder her father's apprentice became desperately enamoured of her, and proportionately jealous.  And this brings us to his rival. On the 10th of April, two gallants, both richly attired, and both young and handsome, dismounted before the grocer's door, and, leaving their steeds to the care of their attendants, entered the shop. They made sundry purchases of conserves, figs, and other dried fruit, chatted familiarly with the grocer, and tarried so long, that at last he began to suspect they must have some motive. All at once, however, they disagreed on some slight matter--Bloundel could not tell what, nor, perhaps, could the disputants, even if their quarrel was not preconcerted--high words arose, and in another moment, swords were drawn, and furious passes exchanged. The grocer called to his eldest son, a stout youth of nineteen, and to Leonard Holt, to separate them. The apprentice seized his cudgel--no apprentice in those days was without one--and rushed towards the combatants, but before he could interfere, the fray was ended. One of them had received a thrust through the sword arm, and his blade dropping, his antagonist declared himself satisfied, and with a grave salute walked off. The wounded man wrapped a lace handkerchief round his arm, but immediately afterwards complained of great faintness. Pitying his condition, and suspecting no harm, the grocer led him into an inner room, where restoratives were offered by Mrs. Bloundel and her daughter Amabel, both of whom had been alarmed by the noise of the conflict. In a short time, the wounded man was so far recovered as to be able to converse with his assistants, especially the younger one; and the grocer having returned to the shop, his discourse became so very animated and tender, that Mrs. Bloundel deemed it prudent to give her daughter a hint to retire. Amabel reluctantly obeyed, for the young stranger was so handsome, so richly dressed, had such a captivating manner, and so distinguished an air, that she was strongly prepossessed in his favour. A second look from her mother, however, caused her to disappear, nor did she return. After waiting with suppressed anxiety for some time, the young gallant departed, overwhelming the good dame with his thanks, and entreating permission to call again. This was peremptorily refused, but, notwithstanding the interdiction, he came on the following day. The grocer chanced to be out at the time, and the gallant, who had probably watched him go forth, deriding the remonstrances of the younger Bloundel and Leonard, marched straight to the inner room, where he found the dame and her daughter. They were much disconcerted at his appearance, and the latter instantly rose with the intention of retiring, but the gallant caught her arm and detained her.  \"Do not fly me, Amabel,\" he cried, in an impassioned tone, \"but suffer me to declare the love I have for you. I cannot live without you.\"  Amabel, whose neck and cheeks were crimsoned with blushes, cast down her eyes before the ardent regards of the gallant, and endeavoured to withdraw her hand.  \"One word only,\" he continued, \"and I release you. Am I wholly indifferent to you! Answer me--yes or no!\"  \"Do _not_ answer him, Amabel,\" interposed her mother. \"He is deceiving you. He loves you not. He would ruin you. This is the way with all these court butterflies. Tell him you hate him, child, and bid him begone.\"  \"But I cannot tell him an untruth, mother,\" returned Amabel, artlessly, \"for I do _not_ hate him.\"  \"Then you love me,\" cried the young man, falling on his knees, and pressing her hand to his lips. \"Tell me so, and make me the happiest of men.\"  But Amabel had now recovered from the confusion into which she had been thrown, and, alarmed at her own indiscretion, forcibly withdrew her hand, exclaiming in a cold tone, and with much natural dignity, \"Arise, sir. I will not tolerate these freedoms. My mother is right--you have some ill design.\"  \"By my soul, no!\" cried the gallant, passionately. \"I love you, and would make you mine.\"  \"No doubt,\" remarked Mrs. Bloundel, contemptuously, \"but not by marriage.\"  \"Yes, by marriage,\" rejoined the gallant, rising. \"If she will consent, I will wed her forthwith.\"  Both Amabel and her mother looked surprised at the young man's declaration, which was uttered with a fervour that seemed to leave no doubt of its sincerity; but the latter, fearing some artifice, replied, \"If what you say is true, and you really love my daughter as much as you pretend, this is not the way to win her; for though she can have no pretension to wed with one of your seeming degree, nor is it for her happiness that she should, yet, were she sought by the proudest noble in the land, she shall never, if I can help it, be lightly won. If your intentions are honourable, you must address yourself, in the first place, to her father, and if he agrees (which I much doubt) that you shall become her suitor, I can make no objection. Till this is settled, I must pray you to desist from further importunity.\"  \"And so must I,\" added Amabel. \"I cannot give you a hope till you have spoken to my father.\"  \"Be it so,\" replied the gallant. \"I will tarry here till his return.\"  So saying, he was about to seat himself, but Mrs. Bloundel prevented him.  \"I cannot permit this, sir,\" she cried. \"Your tarrying here may, for aught I know, bring scandal upon my house;--I am sure it will be disagreeable to my husband. I am unacquainted with your name and condition. You may be a man of rank. You may be one of the profligate and profane crew who haunt the court. You may be the worst of them all, my Lord Rochester himself. He is about your age, I have heard, and though a mere boy in years, is a veteran in libertinism. But, whoever you are, and whatever your rank and station may be, unless your character will bear the strictest scrutiny, I am certain Stephen Bloundel will never consent to your union with his daughter.\"  \"Nay, mother,\" observed Amabel, \"you judge the gentleman unjustly. I am sure he is neither a profligate gallant himself, nor a companion of such--especially of the wicked Earl of Rochester.\"  \"I pretend to be no better than I am,\" replied the young man, repressing a smile that rose to his lips at Mrs. Bloundel's address; \"but I shall reform when I am married. It would be impossible to be inconstant to so fair a creature as Amabel. For my rank, I have none. My condition is that of a private gentleman,--my name, Maurice Wyvil.\"  \"What you say of yourself, Mr. Maurice Wyvil, convinces me you will meet with a decided refusal from my husband,\" returned Mrs. Bloundel.  \"I trust not,\" replied Wyvil, glancing tenderly at Amabel. \"If I should be so fortunate as to gain _his_ consent, have I _yours_?\"  \"It is too soon to ask that question,\" she rejoined, blushing deeply. \"And now, sir, you must go, indeed, you must. You distress my mother.\"  \"If I do not distress _you_, I will stay,\" resumed Wyvil, with an imploring look.  \"Y"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11082"],["title","Old Saint Paul's: A Tale of the Plague and the Fire (#2)"],["body","_do_ distress me,\" she answered, averting her gaze.  \"Nay, then, I must tear myself away,\" he rejoined. \"I shall return shortly, and trust to find your father less flinty-hearted than he is represented.\"  He would have clasped Amabel in his arms, and perhaps snatched a kiss, if her mother had not rushed between them.  \"No more familiarities, sir,\" she cried angrily; \"no court manners here. If you look to wed my daughter, you must conduct yourself more decorously; but I can tell you, you have no chance--none whatever.\"  \"Time will show,\" replied Wyvil, audaciously. \"You had better give her to me quietly, and save me the trouble of carrying her off,--for have her I will.\"  \"Mercy on us!\" cried Mrs. Bloundel, in accents of alarm; \"now his wicked intentions are out.\"  \"Fear nothing, mother,\" observed Amabel, coldly. \"He will scarcely carry me off without my own consent; and I am not likely to sacrifice myself for one who holds me in such light esteem.\"  \"Forgive me, Amabel,\" rejoined Wyvil, in a voice so penitent that it instantly effaced her displeasure; \"I meant not to offend. I spoke only the language of distraction. Do not dismiss me thus, or my death will lie at your door.\"  \"I should be sorry for that,\" she replied; \"but, inexperienced as I am, I feel this is not the language of real regard, but of furious passion.\"  A dark shade passed over Wyvil's handsome features, and the almost feminine beauty by which they were characterized gave place to a fierce and forbidding expression. Controlling himself by a powerful effort, he replied, with forced calmness, \"Amabel, you know not what it is to love. I will not stir hence till I have seen your father.\"  \"We will see that, sir,\" exclaimed Mrs. Bloundel, angrily. \"What, ho! son Stephen! Leonard Holt! I say. This gentleman _will_ stay here, whether I like or not. Show him forth.\"  \"That I will, right willingly,\" replied the apprentice, rushing before the younger Bloundel, and flourishing his formidable cudgel. \"Out with you, sir! Out with you!\"  \"Not at your bidding you, saucy knave,\" rejoined Wyvil, laying his hand upon his sword: \"and if it were not for the presence of your mistress and her lovely daughter, I would crop your ears for your insolence.\"  \"Their presence shall not prevent me from making my cudgel and your shoulders acquainted, if you do not budge,\" replied the apprentice, sturdily.  Enraged by the retort, Wyvil would have drawn his sword, but a blow on the arm disabled him.  \"Plague on you, fellow!\" he exclaimed; \"you shall rue this to the last day of your existence.\"  \"Threaten those who heed you,\" replied Leonard, about to repeat the blow.  \"Do him no further injury!\" cried Amabel, arresting his hand, and looking with the greatest commiseration at Wyvil. \"You have dealt with him far too rudely already.\"  \"Since I have your sympathy, sweet Amabel,\" rejoined Wyvil, \"I care not what rude treatment I experience from this churl. We shall soon meet again.\" And bowing to her, he strode out of the room.  Leonard followed him to the shop-door, hoping some further pretext for quarrel would arise, but he was disappointed. Wyvil took no notice of him, and proceeded at a slow pace towards Cheapside.  Half an hour afterwards, Stephen Bloundel came home. On being informed of what had occurred, he was greatly annoyed, though he concealed his vexation, and highly applauded his daughter's conduct. Without further comment, he proceeded about his business, and remained in the shop till it was closed. Wyvil did not return, and the grocer tried to persuade himself they should see nothing more of him. Before Amabel retired to rest, he imprinted a kiss on her snowy brow, and said, in a tone of the utmost kindness, \"You have never yet deceived me, child, and I hope never will. Tell me truly, do you take any interest in this young gallant?\"  Amabel blushed deeply.  \"I should not speak the truth, father,\" she rejoined, after a pause, \"if I were to say I do not.\"  \"I am sorry for it,\" replied Bloundel, gravely. \"But you would not be happy with him. I am sure he is unprincipled and profligate:--you must forget him.\"  \"I will try to do so,\" sighed Amabel. And the conversation dropped.  On the following day, Maurice Wyvil entered the grocer's shop. He was more richly attired than before, and there was a haughtiness in his manner which he had not hitherto assumed. What passed between him and Bloundel was not known, for the latter never spoke of it; but the result may be gathered from the fact that the young gallant was not allowed an interview with the grocer's daughter.  From this moment the change previously noticed took place in Amabel's demeanour towards Leonard. She seemed scarcely able to endure his presence, and sedulously avoided his regards. From being habitually gay and cheerful, she became pensive and reserved. Her mother more than once caught her in tears; and it was evident, from many other signs, that Wyvil completely engrossed her thoughts. Fully aware of this, Mrs. Bloundel said nothing of it to her husband, because the subject was painful to him; and not supposing the passion deeply rooted, she hoped it would speedily wear away. But she was mistaken--the flame was kept alive in Amabel's breast in a manner of which she was totally ignorant. Wyvil found means to deceive the vigilance of the grocer and his wife, but he could not deceive the vigilance of a jealous lover. Leonard discovered that his mistress had received a letter. He would not betray her, but he determined to watch her narrowly.  Accordingly, when she went forth one morning in company with her younger sister (a little girl of some five years old), he made an excuse to follow them, and, keeping within sight, perceived them enter Saint Paul's Cathedral, the mid aisle of which was then converted into a public walk, and generally thronged with town gallants, bullies, bona-robas, cut-purses, and rogues of every description. In short, it was the haunt of the worst of characters of the metropolis. When, therefore, Amabel entered this structure, Leonard felt certain it was to meet her lover. Rushing forward, he saw her take her course through the crowd, and attract general attention from her loveliness--but he nowhere discerned Maurice Wyvil.  Suddenly, however, she struck off to the right, and halted near one of the pillars, and the apprentice, advancing, detected his rival behind it. He was whispering a few words in her ear, unperceived by her sister. Maddened by the sight, Leonard hurried towards them, but before he could reach the spot Wyvil was gone, and Amabel, though greatly confused, looked at the same time so indignant, that he almost regretted his precipitation.  \"You will, of course, make known to my father what you have just seen?\" she said in a low tone.  \"If you will promise not to meet that gallant again without my knowledge, I will not,\" replied Leonard.  After a moment's reflection, Amabel gave the required promise, and they returned to Wood-street together. Satisfied she would not break her word, the apprentice became more easy, and as a week elapsed, and nothing was said to him on the subject, he persuaded himself she would not attempt to meet her lover again.  Things were in this state at the opening of our tale, but upon the night in question, Leonard fancied he discerned some agitation in Amabel's manner towards him, and in consequence of this notion, he sought to meet her gaze, as before related, after prayers. While trying to distract his thoughts by arranging sundry firkins of butter, and putting other things in order, he heard a light footstep behind him, and turning at the sound, beheld Amabel.  \"Leonard,\" she whispered, \"I promised to tell you when I should next meet Maurice Wyvil. He will be here to-night.\" And without giving him time to answer, she retired.  For awhile, Leonard remained in a state almost of stupefaction, repeating to himself, as if unwilling to believe them, the words he had just heard. He had not recovered when the grocer entered the shop, and noticing his haggard looks, kindly inquired if he felt unwell. The apprentice returned an evasive answer, and half determined to relate all he knew to his master, but the next moment he changed his intention, and, influenced by that chivalric feeling which always governs those, of whatever condition, who love profoundly, resolved not to betray the thoughtless girl, but to trust to his own ingenuity to thwart the designs of his rival, and preserve her Acting upon this resolution, he said he had a slight headache, and instantly resumed his occupation.  At nine o'clock, the whole family assembled at supper. The board was plentifully though plainly spread, but the grocer observed, with some uneasiness, that his apprentice, who had a good appetite in ordinary, ate little or nothing. He kept his eye constantly upon him, and became convinced from his manner that something ailed him. Not having any notion of the truth, and being filled with apprehensions of the plague, his dread was that Leonard was infected by the disease. Supper was generally the pleasantest meal of the day at the grocer's house, but on this occasion it passed off cheerlessly enough, and a circumstance occurred at its close which threw all into confusion and distress. Before relating this, however, we must complete our description of the family under their present aspect.  Tall, and of a spare frame, with good features, somewhat austere in their expression, and of the cast which we are apt to term precise and puritanical, but tempered with great benevolence, Stephen Bloundel had a keen, deep-seated eye, overshadowed by thick brows, and suffered his long-flowing grey hair to descend over his shoulders. His forehead was high and ample, his chin square and well defined, and his general appearance exceedingly striking. In age he was about fifty. His integrity and fairness of dealing, never once called in question for a period of thirty years, had won him the"]]]
