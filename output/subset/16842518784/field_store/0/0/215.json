Among the bricklayers at work on a building which was being       erected in a great American city during the summer of 1914 were       two men who had not yet become citizens of the United States.       Born abroad, they still owed allegiance, one to the Emperor of       Austria, the other to the Czar of Russia.  Meeting in a new country, and using a new language which gave them a chance to understand each other, they had become well acquainted. They were members of the same labor union, and had worked side by side on several different jobs. In the course of time, a firm friendship had sprung up between them. Suddenly, on the same day, each was notified to call at the office of the agent of his government in the city. Next morning the Russian came to his boss to explain that he must quit work, that he had been called home to fight for the “Little Father” of the Russians. He found his chum, the Austrian, there ahead of him, telling that he had to go, for the Russians had declared war on Austria and the good Kaiser,[1] Franz Josef, had need of all his young men.   [1] In the German language, the title Kaiser means Emperor.        The two chums stared at each other in sorrow and dismay. The       pitiless arm of the god of war had reached across the broad       Atlantic, plucking them back from peace and security. With       weapons put into their hands they would be ordered to kill each       other on sight.        A last hand-clasp, a sorrowful “Good luck to you,” and they       parted.        Why was this necessary? What was this irresistible force, strong       enough to separate the two friends and drag them back five       thousand miles for the purpose of killing each other? To answer       these two questions is the purpose of this little volume.        Beginning with the summer of 1914, Europe and parts of Asia and       Africa were torn and racked with the most tremendous war that the       world has ever seen. Millions of men were killed. Other millions       were maimed, blinded, or disfigured for life. Still other       millions were herded into prison camps or forced to work like       convict laborers. Millions of homes were filled with grief.       Millions of women were forced to do hard work which before the       war had been considered beyond their power. Millions of children       were left fatherless. What had been the richest and most       productive farming land in Europe was made a barren waste.       Thousands of villages and towns were utterly destroyed and their       inhabitants were forced to flee, the aged, the sick, and the       infants alike.        In many cases, as victorious armies swept through Poland and       Serbia, the wretched inhabitants fled before them, literally       starving, because all food had been seized for the use of       fighting men. Dreadful diseases, which cannot exist where people       have the chance to bathe and keep themselves clean, once more       appeared, sweeping away hundreds of thousands of victims. The       strongest, healthiest, bravest men of a dozen different nations       were shot down by the millions or left to drag out a miserable       existence, sick or crippled for life. Silent were the wheels in       many factories which once turned out the comforts and luxuries of       civilization. There were no men to make toys for the children, or       to work for mankind’s happiness. The only mills and factories       which were running full time were those that turned out the tools       of destruction and shot and shell for the guns. Nations poured       out one hundred fifty million dollars a day for the purpose of       killing off the best men in Europe. Had the world gone mad? What       was the reason for it all?  [Illustration: Fleeing from their Homes, around which a Battle is Raging]        In 1913 Germans traveled in Russia and Englishmen traveled in       Germany freely and safely. Germans were glad to trade with       intercourse Russians, and happy to have Englishmen spend their       money in Germany. France and Austria exchanged goods and their       inhabitants traveled within each other’s boundaries. A Frenchman       might go anywhere through Germany and be welcomed. There was       nothing to make the average German hate the average Englishman or       Belgian. The citizen of Austria and the citizen of Russia could       meet and find plenty of ground for friendship.        We cannot explain this war, then, on the grounds of race hatred.       One can imagine that two men living side by side and seeing each       other every day might have trouble and grow to hate each other,       but in this great war soldiers were shooting down other soldiers       whom they had never seen before, with whom they had never       exchanged a word, and it would not profit them if they killed a       whole army of their opponents. In many cases, the soldiers did       not see the men whom they were killing. An officer with a       telescope watched where the shells from the cannon were falling       and telephoned to the captain in charge to change the aim a       trifle for his next shots. The men put in the projectile, closed       and fired the gun. Once in a while, a shell from the invisible       enemy, two, three, or four miles away, fell among them, killing       and wounding. When a regiment of Austrians were ordered to charge       the Russian trenches, they shot and bayoneted the Russians       because they were told to do so by their officers, and the       Russian soldiers shot the Austrians because their captains so       ordered them. The officers on each side were only obeying orders       received from their generals. The generals were only obeying       orders from the government.        In the end, then, we come back to the governments, and we wonder       what has caused these nations to fly at each other’s throats. The       question arises as to what makes up a government or why a       government has the right to rule its people.        In the United States, the government officials are simply the       servants of the people. Practically every man in our country,       unless he is a citizen of some foreign nation, has a right to       vote, and in many of the states women, too, have a voice in the       government. We, the people of the United States, can choose our       own lawmakers, can instruct them how to vote and, in some states,       can vote out of existence any law that they the people have made       which we do not like. In all states, we can show our disapproval       of what our law-makers have done by voting against them at the       next election. Such is the government of a republic, a       “government of the people, by the people, and for the people,” as       Abraham Lincoln called it. In the leading British colonies, the       people rule. Australian citizens voted against forcing men to       serve in the army. The result was very close and the vote of the       women helped to decide it. Canada, on the contrary, voted to       compel her men to go. How is it in Europe? Have the people of       Germany or Austria the right to vote on war? Were they consulted       before their governments called them to arms and sent them to       fight each other? It is plain that in order to understand what       this war is about, we must look into the story of how the       different governments of Europe came to be and learn why their       peoples obey them so unquestioningly.        We must remember that government by the people is a very new       thing. One hundred and thirty years ago, even in the United       States only about one-fourth of the men had the right to vote.       These were citizens of property and wealth. They did not think a       poor man was worth considering. In England, a country which       allows its people more voice in the government than almost any       other nation in Europe, it is only within the last thirty years       that all men could vote. There are some European countries, like       Turkey, where the people have practically no power at all and       others, like Austria, where they have very little voice in how       they shall be governed.        For over a thousand years, the men of Europe have obeyed without       thinking when their lords and kings have ordered them to pick up       their weapons and go to war. In many instances they have known       nothing of the causes of the conflict or of what they were       fighting for. A famous English writer has written a poem which       illustrates how little the average citizen has ever known       concerning the cause of war, and shows the difference between the       way in which war was looked upon by the men of old and the way in       which one should regard it. The poem runs as follows:  The Battle of Blenheim  It was a summer evening,     Old Kaspar’s work was done, And he before his cottage door     Was sitting in the sun, And by him sported on the green His little grandchild Wilhelmine.  She saw her brother Peterkin     Roll something large and round, Which he beside the rivulet     In playing there had found, He came to ask what he had found That was so large"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11200"],["title","The World War and What was Behind It; Or, The Story of the Map of Europe (#2)"],["body","smooth and round.  Old Kaspar took it from the boy,     Who stood expectant by; And then the old man shook his head,     And, with a natural sigh— “’Tis some poor fellow’s skull,” said he, “Who fell in the great victory.  “I find them in the garden,     For there’s many hereabout; And often when I go to plow,     The plowshare turns them out! For many a thousand men,” said he, “Were slain in the great victory.”  “Now tell us what ’twas all about,”     Young Peterkin he cries; And little Wilhelmine looks up     With wonder-waiting eyes— “Now tell us all about the war, And what they fought each other for.”  “It was the English,” Kaspar cried,     “Who put the French to rout; But what they fought each other for     I could not well make out; But everybody said,” quoth he, “That ’twas a famous victory.  “My father lived at Blenheim then,     Yon little stream hard by; They burnt his dwelling to the ground,     And he was forced to fly; So with his wife and child he fled, Nor had he where to rest his head.  “They say it was a shocking sight     After the field was won— For many thousand bodies here     Lay rotting in the sun; But things like that, you know, must be After a famous victory.  “Great praise the Duke of Marlborough won,     And our good Prince Eugene.” “Why, ’twas a very wicked thing!”     Said little Wilhelmine. “Nay, nay, my little girl,” quoth he, “It was a famous victory.  “And everybody praised the duke     Who this great fight did win.” “But what good came of it at last?”     Quoth little Peterkin. “Why, that I cannot tell,” said he; “But ’twas a famous victory.”  —_Robert Southey_.        Old Kaspar, who has been used to such things all his life, cannot       feel the wickedness and horror Of the battle. The children, on       the other hand, have a different idea of war. They are not       satisfied until they know what it was all about and what good       came of it, and they feel that “it was a very wicked thing.” If       the men in the armies had stopped to ask the reason why they were       killing each other and had refused to fight until they knew the       truth, the history of the world would have been very different.        One reason why we still have wars is that men refuse to think for       themselves, because it is so much easier to let their dead       ancestors think for them and to keep up customs which should have       been changed ages ago. People in Europe have lived in the midst       of wars or preparation for wars all their lives. There never has       been a time when Europe was not either a battlefield or a great       drill-ground for armies.        There was a time, long ago, when any man might kill another in       Europe and not be punished for his deed. It was not thought wrong       to take human life. Today it is not considered wrong to kill,       provided a man is ordered to do so by his general or his king.       When two kings go to war, each claiming his quarrel to be a just       one, wholesale murder is done, and each side is made by its       government to think itself very virtuous and wholly justified in       its killing. It should be the great aim of everyone today to help       to bring about lasting peace among all the nations.  [Illustration: A Drill Ground in Modern Europe.]        In order to know how to do this, we must study the causes of the       wars of the past. We shall find, as we do so, that almost all       wars can be traced to one of four causes: (1) the instinct among       barbarous tribes to fight with and plunder their neighbors; (2)       the ambition of kings to enlarge their kingdoms; (3) the desire       of the traders of one nation to increase their commerce at the       expense of some other nation; (4) a people’s wish to be free from       the control of some other country and to become a nation by       itself. Of the four reasons, only the last furnishes a just cause       for war, and this cause has been brought about only when kings       have sent their armies out, and forced into their kingdoms other       peoples who wished to govern themselves.           Questions for Review             Why must foreigners in the United States return to their           native lands when summoned by their governments?            How is it that war helps to breed diseases?            Is race hatred a cause of war or a result of it?            Whom do we mean by the government in the United States?            Who controls the government in Russia?            Who in England?            Who in Germany?            Who in France?            In Southey’s poem, how does the children’s idea of the battle           differ from that of their grandfather? Why?            Are people less likely to protest against war if their           forefathers have fought many wars?            What have been the four main causes of war?     Chapter II. Rome and the Barbarian Tribes        New governments in Europe.—Earliest times.—How civilization       began.—The rise of Rome.—Roman civilization.—Roman cruelty.—The       German tribes.—The Slavic tribes.—The Celtic tribes.—The Huns and       Moors.—The great Germanic invasions of the Roman world.         To search for the causes of the great war which began in Europe       in 1914, we must go far back into history. It should be       remembered that many of the governments of today have not lived       as long as that of our own country. This is, perhaps, a new       thought to some of us, who rather think that, as America is a new       country, it is the baby among the great nations. But, one hundred       and thirty years ago, when the United States was being formed,       there was no nation called Italy; the peninsula which we now know       by that name was cut up among nine or ten little governments.       There was no nation known as Germany; the land which is in the       present German empire was then divided among some thirty or       thirty-five different rulers. There was no Republic of France;       instead, France had a king whose will was law, and the French       people were cruelly oppressed. There was no kingdom of Belgium,       no kingdom of Serbia, of Bulgaria, of Roumania. The kingdom of       Norway was part of Denmark. The Republic of France, as we now       know it, dates back only to 1871; the Empire of Germany and the       United Kingdom of Italy to about the same time. The kingdoms of       Roumania, Serbia, and Bulgaria have been independent of Turkey       only since 1878. The kingdom of Albania did not exist before       1913. Most of the present nations of modern Europe, then, are       very new. The troubles which led to the great war, however,       originated in the dim twilight of history.        In the earliest days, there were no separate countries or       kingdoms. Men gathered together in little bands, each of which       had its leader. This leader was generally chosen because of his       bodily strength and courage. He was the best fighter of the       tribe. The people did not have any lasting homes. They moved       around from place to place, wherever they could find the best       hunting and fishing. When two tribes wanted the same hunting       grounds, they fought, and the weaker party had to give way.       Selfishness was supreme. If a man wanted anything which belonged       to his weaker neighbor, he simply beat this neighbor over the       head with his club, and took it. The stronger tribe attacked the       weaker, without any thought of whether or not its quarrel was       just.        Gradually, in the southern and warmer parts of Europe, the tribes       began to be more civilized. Towns sprang up. Ships were built.       Trade came to be one of the occupations. The fighting men needed       weapons and armor; so there grew up artisans who were skilled in       working metals. In Egypt and Syria there were people who had       reached quite a high degree of civilization, and gradually the       Europeans learned from them better ways of living. First the       Greeks, then the Etruscans (Ē-trŭs′cans), a people who lived in       Italy just north of where Rome now is, and finally the southern       Italians learned that it was possible to live in cities, without       hunting and plundering. Grazing (the tending of flocks of       animals) came to be the occupation of many. The owners of sheep       or cattle drove their flocks from place to place, as grass and       water failed them where they were. There was no separate       ownership of land.        At last came the rise of the city of Rome, which, starting out as       the stronghold of a little gang of robbers, spread its rule       gradually over all the surrounding country. By this time, the       barbarians of northern Europe had gotten past the use of clubs as       weapons. They, too, had learned to make tools and arms of bronze,       and those living near civilized countries had obtained swords of       iron. The club, however, still remained as the sign of authority.       The large bludgeon of the chief was carried before the tribe as a       sign of his power over them. You have all seen pictures of a king       sitting on his throne and holding a wand or stick in his right       hand. It is interesting to think that this scepter, which the       present king of England carries on state occasions to remind his       people of his power, is a relic of the old, old days when his       grandfather, many times removed, broke the head of his rival for       leadership in the tribe and set up his mighty club for his       awestruck people to worship.        The city of Rome (at first a republic, afterwards an empire)       spread its rule over all of Italy, over all the shores of the       Mediterranean Sea, and finally over all the countries of Europe       south and west of the rivers Danube and Rhine. One of the       emperors planted a colony north of the Danube near its"]]]
