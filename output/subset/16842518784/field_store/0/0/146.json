The prana collected, and formed globes.  On these pranic globes the process was repeated, with ether as the result, and the etheric globes formed.  Then the process was repeated on the etheric globes, as the modern scientists have discovered, and prakriti and prakritic globes came into being.  The true diameter of the earth, the ancient Hindu books say, is about 50,000 miles.  That is to say, the true surface of the earth is the line of twenty-four-hour axial rotation;  the line where gravity and apergy exactly balance;  where a moon would have to be placed to revolve once in 86,400 seconds.  Within that is prakriti;  without is ether.  It is also the line of no friction, which does exist between matter of different planes. There is friction between prakriti, between ether, between prana; but not between ether and prana, or ether and prakriti.  Friction is a phenomenon confined to the matter of each plane separately. We live at the bottom of this gaseous ocean--on its floor --21,000 miles from the surface and only 4,000 miles from the center.  Here, in a narrow \"skin\" limited to a few miles above and below us, is the realm of phenomena, where solid turns into liquid and liquid into gas, or vice versa.  The lesson impressed upon the pupil's mind by Hindu physics is that he lives far within the earth, not on it.  There is a comparatively narrow \"skin\" of and for phenomena within the etheric sun-globe, say the Eastern teachers, where the etheric solids, liquids, and gases meet and mingle and interchange.  Within this \"skin\" are all the planets--the \"gaseous\" atmosphere of the etheric globe stretching millions of miles beyond the outermost planetary orbit.  The earth is in this skin or belt of etheric phenomena, and its ether is in touch with the ether \"in manifestation\" on the etheric globe.  The sun and other etheric globes are within the corresponding \"skin\" of phenomena of the pranic globes.  The prana, manifesting as solid, liquid, and gas, or in combination and in forms, is in perfect touch with that of the etheric globe, and through that with the prana of the earth.  That our prana is in touch with that on the pranic globe in all its manifestations means much in metaphysics. The same is true of the manasic globe, and of our manasa.  The great lesson the Eastern physics burns into the pupil is that we are living not only within the prakritic earth, but within each of the other globes as well in identically the same way and subject to the same laws.  Our lives are not passed on one globe, but in four globes.  It is as if one said he lived in Buffalo, Erie county, New York, United States;  that he was a citizen of each and subject to the laws of each.  This question of the four globes, of the four planes of matter, of the four skins, and of the four conditions or states of all matter and necessarily of all persons, from the purely material standpoint, is not only the foundation of Oriental physics, but the very essence of Oriental metaphysics--its starting-point and corner-stone.  To one who carries with him, consciously or unconsciously, the concrete knowledge of the physics, the abstract teaching of the metaphysics presents no difficulty;  it is as clear as crystal.  But without the physical teaching the metaphysical is not translatable.  Our Western physics teaches that physical matter is divided into two kinds prakriti (commonly called \"physical matter\") and ether; that the differences of each of the elementary prakritic substances (iron, copper, sulphur, oxygen) are in their molecules, the fundamental atom being the same;  that each of these elementary substances vibrates only through one octave, though on different keys;  that it changes from solid to liquid and gas as the rate of vibration is increased and from gas to liquid and solid as its vibration is decreased within its octave; that the ether obeys identical laws;  that it has elementary substances vibrating through one octave only, and that these are solids, liquids, or gases on the etheric plane as prakriti is on this;  that these etheric substances change and combine in every way that prakriti does;  and that while all our prakritic substances vibrate within (say) fifty simply octaves, the lowest vibration of etheric matter begins over one thousand octaves beyond our highest, making a gulf to leap.  The Eastern physics presents this with a wealth of detail that dazes the Western student, and then adds:  \"But beyond the etheric plane (or octave) of vibration for matter there is a third plane (or octave) of vibration called prana and beyond that a fourth called manasa.  What is true of one plane is true of the other three. One law governs the four.  As above so below.  There is no real gulf;  there is perfect continuity.\"  The Western scientist teaches as the foundation of modern physics that \"each and every atom of prakritic matter is the center of an etheric molecule of many atoms;\"  that \"no two prakritic atoms touch,\" although their etheric envelopes or atmospheres do touch; and that \"all physical phenomena are caused by the chording vibration of the prakritic atom and its envelope of ether,\" each \"sounding the same note hundreds of octaves apart.\"  The \"solid earth\" with its atmosphere represents the atom with its ether. As all the oxygen and hydrogen do not combine to make the drop of water, some remaining in mechanical union to give it an atmosphere, and about one-fourth of its bulk being gas, so the atom formed of the ether does not use all the ether in its chemical union, retaining some in mechanical union for its envelope or atmosphere.  The Hindu physics goes much farther along this road.  It says that, when the pranic globes were formed, each atom of prana had its manasic envelope--was the center of a manasic molecule. When the etheric globes formed, each atom of ether was the center of a pranic molecule, each atom of which was surrounded with manasa.  When the prakriti was formed from the ether, each and every atom of prakriti had the triple etheric-pranic-manasic envelope.  \"Each and every prakritic atom is the center of an etheric molecule,\" says our Western science;  but that of the East adds this:  \"And each atom of that etheric molecule is the center of a pranic molecule, and each atom of prana in that pranic molecule is the center of a manasic molecule.\"  The four great globes of matter in the material universe are represented and reproduced in each and every atom of prakriti, which is in touch with each one of the four globes and a part of it.  The same is true of any aggregation of prakriti--of the earth itself and of all things in it, including man.  As there are four atoms in each one, so there are four earths, four globes, consubstantial, one for each of the four elements, and in touch with it.  One is formed of prakritic atoms--the globe we know; another, of the ether forming their envelopes;  another, of the prana envelopes of ether, and a fourth of the manasa around the pranic atom.  They are not \"skins\";  they are consubstantial. And what is true of atoms or globes is true of animals.  Each has four \"material\" bodies, with each body on the corresponding globe --whether of the earth or of the Universe.  This is the physical basis of the famous \"chain of seven globes\" that is such a stumbling-block in Hindu metaphysics.  The spirit passes through four to get in and three to get out--seven in all.  The Hindu understands without explanation.  He understands his physics.  The Hindu physics teaches, with ours, that \"the ether is the source of all energy,\" but, it adds, \"as prana is the source of all life, and manasa of all mind.\"  \"When the prakritic atom is vibrating in chord with its etheric envelope,\" say our textbooks, \"we have physical phenomena --light, heat, electricity.\"  \"Yes,\" says the Hindu teacher;  \"but when the atom and its ether and its prana are vibrating in chord, we have life and vital phenomena added to the energy.  When the atom and its ether, prana, and manasa are vibrating in chord, we have mind and mental phenomena added to the life and energy.\" Each atom has energy, life, and mind in posse.  In the living leaf the prakriti, ether, and prana are sounding the threefold silver chord of life.  In the animal, the manasa is sounding the same note with them, making the fourfold golden chord of mind.   Even in the plant there may be a faint manasic overtone, for the potentiality of life and mind is in everything.  This unity of the physical universe with the physical atom, and with all things created--earth, animal, or crystal--is the physical backbone of Oriental metaphysics.  Prakriti, ether, prana, and manasa are in our vernacular the Earth, Air, Fire, and Water of the old philosophers--the \"Four Elements.\"  The Oriental physics has been guarded most jealously.  For many thousands of years it has been the real occult and esoteric teaching, while the Oriental metaphysics has been open and exoteric.  It could not be understood without the key, and the key was in the physics known only to \"the tried and approved disciple.\"  A little has leaked out--enough to whet the appetite of the true student and make him ask for more.     Chapter Two  The Two Kinds of Perception   To the savage, matter appears in two forms--solid and liquid. As he advances a step he learns it has three forms--solid, liquid and gas.  He cannot see the gas, but he knows it is there.  A little further on he learns that matter as he knows it is only a minute portion of the great universe of matter--the few chords that can be struck on the five strings of his senses, and limited to one octave or key.  Whether the particular matter he investigates has a solid, a liquid, or a gaseous form depends upon its rate of vibration.  If it is a liquid, by raising its rate of vibration one third it becomes a gas;  by reducing it one third it becomes a solid."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10773"],["title","Ancient and Modern Physics (#2)"],["body","kind of matter has vibration only through one octave.  It is known to us only by its vibration in that octave.  Each kind of matter has a different octave--is set on a higher or lower key, so to speak, but all octaves of vibration are between the highest of hydrogen gas and the lowest of carbon.  In mechanical compounds, such as air or brass, the rate of vibration of the compound is the least common multiple of the two or more rates.  In chemical compounds, such as water or alcohol, the rate is that of the highest, the others uniting in harmonic fractions.  All matter as we know it through our senses--prakriti, as it is called in the Secret Doctrine to distinguish it from non-sensual matter--is the vibration of an universal Something, we do not know what, through these different octaves.  The elementary substances (so-called) are one and the same thing--this Something--in different keys and chords of vibration;  keys that run into one another, producing all sorts of beautiful harmonies.  Taking any one of these elements, or any of their compounds, all we know of it is limited strictly to its changes during vibration through one octave.  What happens when the vibration goes above or below the octave has not yet been treated hypothetically.  While some elements are vibrating on higher and some on lower keys, we can consider them all as vibrating within one great octave, that octave of the universal Something which produces sensual matter, or prakriti.  But matter is not confined, we know, to this great octave, although our sensual knowledge of it is strictly confined to it. How do we know it?  Knowledge comes to us in two ways, and there are two kinds of knowledge.  1. That which comes through our senses, by observation and experience.  This includes reasoning from relation.  2. That which comes through intuition--or, as some writers inaccurately say, \"through the formal laws of thought.\"  All the observation and experience of the rising and the setting of the sun for a thousand centuries could only have confirmed the first natural belief that it revolved daily around the earth; nor by joining this experience with other experiences could any deduction have come from our reason that would have opposed it. Not our reason but our intuition said that the sun stood still and the earth revolved daily.  The oldest books in existence tell us that this axial revolution of the earth was not only known in the very dawn of time but that it has been known to every race (except our own of European savages) from before the time thought was first transmitted by writing.  Ask the ablest living geographer or physicist to prove to you that the earth revolves daily and he will reply that it would be the job of his life.  It can be done at great expense and great labor, but that is because we know the answer and can invent a way of showing it, not because there are any observations from which a deduction would naturally follow.  Nearly if not all our great discoveries have come to us through intuition and not from observation and experience.  When we know the lines on which to work, when intuition has given us the KEY, then the observation and experience men prize so highly, and the reason they worship so devoutly, will fill in the details.  The knowledge that flows from observation and the reasoning from the facts it records, is never more than relatively true, it is always limited by the facts, and any addition to the facts requires the whole thing to be restated.  We never know all the facts;  seldom even the more important;  and reason grasps only details.  Lamarck's theory of evolution, known to all Asiatic races from time immemorial, was the intuitional and absolute knowledge that comes to all men when they reach a certain stage of development. Reason could never have furnished it from the facts, as Cuvier proved in the great debate in the French Academy in 1842, when he knocked Lamarck out, for the time being, because \"it did not conform to the facts, and did not follow from any relation of the facts.\"  Darwin's theory of the survival of the fittest in the struggle for existence, as an explanation of the origin of species, was from observation and experience.  It was based on observed facts. But Darwin was an evolutionist--a disciple of Lamarck.  He held the Key.  He used the Key.  The value of Darwin's work does not lie in his discovering that some bugs have been derived from other bugs and that the intermediate bugs have died off.  Its overwhelming value to mankind was in showing that work on the theory of evolution was correct work and that the theory was true.  When the intuition of man points out the way the reason of man can follow the path and macadam the road.  It usually does and claims all the credit for itself as the original discoverer.  This knowledge through intuition is absolute and exact.  It is not relatively true.  It is absolutely and invariably true.  No additional facts will ever modify it, or require a restatement.  When Sir William Hamilton based his Logic on the dictum that \"All knowledge is relative, and only relatively true,\" the proposition was self-evidently false.  It was in itself a statement of absolute knowledge about a certain thing.  It was in itself knowledge that was not relative.  All knowledge could not be relative if this knowledge was not.  This knowledge could not be either absolute or relative without upsetting his whole proposition, for, if relative, then it was not always true; and if absolute, then it was never true.  Sir William did not know the distinction between the two kinds of knowledge, and what he meant to say was that \"All knowledge obtained by observation and experience is relative, and only relatively true.\"  His knowledge of this relativity was not obtained by observation or from reason.  It could not possibly have been obtained in that way.  It came from intuition, and it was absolute and exact.  A man may have absolute and exact knowledge and yet not be able to put it into words that exactly express it to another.  Hamilton had this knowledge.  But it was not clearly formulated even in his own mind.  He had two separate and distinct meanings for the word \"knowledge,\" without being conscious of it.  We have yet to coin a proper word to express what comes to us through intuition.  The old English word \"wisdom\" originally did. The old verb \"wis\" was meant what a man knew without being told it, as \"ken\" meant knowledge by experience.  Try and prove by reason that a straight line is the shortest distance between two points, or that a part can never be greater than the whole, and your reason has an impossible task.  \"You must take them for axioms,\" it says.  You must take them because you wis them, not because you know (ken) them.  Intuitional knowledge must not be confounded with the relative knowledge that flows through the reason:  that \"If the sum of two numbers is one and their difference is five,\" the numbers are minus two and plus three.  The point cannot be too strongly enforced that there is a distinction between the sources of what we know, and that while all we know through our sensations is only relatively true, that which we know from intuition is invariably and absolutely true. This is seen through a glass darkly, in theology, where intuition is called inspiration and not differentiated from reason.  The false notion that we can only learn by observation and experience, that the concept can never transcend the observation, that we can only know what we can prove to our senses, has wrought incalculable injury to progress in philosophy.  Because our sensual knowledge of matter begins and ends with vibration in one octave it does not follow that this ends our knowledge of it.  We may have intuitional knowledge, and this intuitional knowledge is as susceptible to reason as if we had obtained it by observation.  The knowledge that comes through intuition tells us of matter vibrating in another great octave just beyond our own, which Science has chosen to name the etheric octave, or plane.  The instant our intuition reveals the cause of phenomena our reason drops in and tells us it is the chording vibration of the matter of the two planes--the physical and etheric--that produces all physical phenomena.  It goes further and explains its variations.  This knowledge of another octave or plane of matter comes from the logical relations of matter and its physical phenomena;  but there was nothing in the observation or experience of mankind that would have led us to infer from reason an etheric plane of matter.  It was \"revealed\" truth.  But the flash of revelation having once made the path apparent, the light of reason carries us through all the winding ways.  Our knowledge of the ether is not guess-work or fancy, any more than our geometry is, because it is based on axioms our reason cannot prove.  In both cases the basic axioms are obtained from intuition;  the structural work from reason.  Our knowledge of the ether may be as absolute and exact as our knowledge of prakriti, working on physical as we work on geometrical axioms.  The recognition of the two sources of knowledge, the work of the spirit within us and of the mind within us, is absolutely necessary to correctly comprehend the true significance of the results of modern science and to accept the ancient.     Chapter Three  Matter and Ether   It is not worthwhile translating Homer into English unless the readers of the translation understand English.  It is not worthwhile attempting to translate the occult Eastern physics into the language of our Western and modern physics, unless those who are to read the translation understand generally and broadly what our own modern physics teach.  It is not necessary that they should know all branches of our modern physics in all their minute ramifications;  but it is necessary that they should understand clearly the fundamental principles upon which our scientific"]]]
