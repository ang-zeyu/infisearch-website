[Footnote 4: I give the reading of the \"Miscellanies\" (1711), Faulkner and Hawkesworth. Scott and Craik print it: \"I confess I cannot (with submission) apprehend, nor is the consequence necessary.\" [T.S.]]  _First,_ One great advantage proposed by the abolishing of Christianity is, that it would very much enlarge and establish liberty of conscience, that great bulwark of our nation, and of the Protestant Religion, which is still too much limited by priestcraft, notwithstanding all the good intentions of the legislature, as we have lately found by a severe instance. For it is confidently reported, that two young gentlemen of real hopes, bright wit, and profound judgment, who upon a thorough examination of causes and effects, and by the mere force of natural abilities, without the least tincture of learning, having made a discovery, that there was no God, and generously communicating their thoughts for the good of the public, were some time ago, by an unparalleled severity, and upon I know not what obsolete law, broke for blasphemy.[5] And as it hath been wisely observed, if persecution once begins, no man alive knows how far it may reach, or where it will end.  [Footnote 5: No record of this \"breaking\" has been discovered. [T.S.]]  In answer to all which, with deference to wiser judgments, I think this rather shews the necessity of a nominal religion among us. Great wits love to be free with the highest objects; and if they cannot be allowed a God to revile or renounce, they will speak evil of dignities, abuse the government, and reflect upon the ministry; which I am sure few will deny to be of much more pernicious consequence, according to the saying of Tiberius, _Deorum offensa diis curae._[6] As to the particular fact related, I think it is not fair to argue from one instance, perhaps another cannot be produced; yet (to the comfort of all those who may be apprehensive of persecution) blasphemy we know is freely spoken a million of times in every coffeehouse and tavern, or wherever else good company meet. It must be allowed indeed, that to break an English free-born officer only for blasphemy, was, to speak the gentlest of such an action, a very high strain of absolute power. Little can be said in excuse for the general; perhaps he was afraid it might give offence to the allies, among whom, for aught we know, it may be the custom of the country to believe a God. But if he argued, as some have done, upon a mistaken principle, that an officer who is guilty of speaking blasphemy, may some time or other proceed so far as to raise a mutiny, the consequence is by no means to be admitted; for, surely the commander of an English army is likely to be but ill obeyed, whose soldiers fear and reverence him as little as they do a Deity.  [Footnote 6: Tacitus, \"Annals,\" bk. i., c. lxxiii. [T.S.]]  It is further objected against the Gospel System, that it obliges men to the belief of things too difficult for free-thinkers, and such who have shaken off the prejudices that usually cling to a confined education. To which I answer, that men should be cautious how they raise objections which reflect upon the wisdom of the nation. Is not every body freely allowed to believe whatever he pleases, and to publish his belief to the world whenever he thinks fit, especially if it serves to strengthen the party which is in the right? Would any indifferent foreigner, who should read the trumpery lately written by Asgil, Tindal, Toland, Coward,[7] and forty more, imagine the Gospel to be our rule of faith, and confirmed by parliaments? Does any man either believe, or say he believes, or desire to have it thought that he says he believes one syllable of the matter? And is any man worse received upon that score, or does he find his want of nominal faith a disadvantage to him in the pursuit of any civil or military employment? What if there be an old dormant statute or two against him, are they not now obsolete, to a degree, that Empsom and Dudley[8] themselves if they were now alive, would find it impossible to put them in execution?  [Footnote 7: John Asgill (1659-1738), became a member of Lincoln's Inn, and went over to Ireland in 1697, where he practised as a barrister, amassed a large fortune, and was elected to the Irish parliament. For writing \"An Argument, proving that Man may be translated from hence without passing through Death,\" he was, in 1700, expelled the House, and the book ordered to be burnt. On returning to England he was elected to parliament for Bramber, but suffered a second expulsion in 1712, also on account of this book. He was imprisoned for debt, and remained under the rules of the Fleet and King's Bench for thirty years, during which time he wrote and published various political tracts. His \"Argument\" attempted to \"interpret the relations between God and man by the technical rules of English law,\" and Coleridge thought no little of its power and style.  Matthew Tindal (1657-1733) was born at Beer Ferrers, in Devonshire. He studied at Oxford, and obtained a fellowship in All Souls. He was made LL.D. in 1685, and, although he professed himself a Roman Catholic in James II.'s reign, he managed to keep his fellowship after that monarch's flight by becoming Protestant again. His most important work was \"The Rights of the Christian Church Asserted,\" which the House of Commons in 1710 adjudged fit for burning by the hangman. In 1730 he published anonymously, the first part of \"Christianity as Old as Creation,\" a work which attacked strongly the authority of the Scriptures; a second volume was never published.  John Toland (1669-1722), born near Londonderry, and educated in a Catholic school. He professed himself a Protestant, and was sent to Glasgow and Edinburgh. In the latter university he graduated in his master's degree. While studying at Leyden he became a sceptic, and in 1695 published his \"Christianity not Mysterious,\" a work which aroused a wide controversy. In his \"Life of Milton\" (1698) he denied that King Charles was the author of \"Eikon Basilikae,\" and also attacked the Gospels. This also brought upon him rejoinders from Dr. Blackall and Dr. Samuel Clarke. He died at Putney, in easy circumstances, due to the presents made him while visiting German courts. He wrote other works, chief among which may be mentioned, \"Socinianism truly Stated\" (1705), \"Nazarenas\" (1718), and \"Tetradymus.\" His \"Posthumous Works\" were issued in two volumes in 1726, with a life by Des Maizeaux. Craik calls him \"a man of utterly worthless character,\" and refers to his being \"mixed up in some discreditable episodes as a political spy.\"  William Coward (1656?--1724?) was born at Winchester. He studied medicine and became a fellow of Wadham College, Oxford. His \"Second Thoughts concerning Human Souls,\" published in 1702, occasioned fierce disputes, on account of its materialism. The House of Commons ordered the work to be burnt by the hangman.  Asgill, Toland, Tindal, Collins, and Coward are classed as the Deistical writers of the eighteenth century. In his \"History of English Thought in the Eighteenth Century\" Mr. Leslie Stephen gives an admirable exposition of their views, and their special interpretation of Locke's theories.

[T.S.]]  It is likewise urged, that there are, by computation, in this kingdom, above ten thousand parsons, whose revenues added to those of my lords the bishops, would suffice to maintain at least two hundred young gentlemen of wit and pleasure, and freethinking, enemies to priestcraft, narrow principles, pedantry, and prejudices; who might be an ornament to the Court and Town: And then, again, so great a number of able [bodied] divines might be a recruit to our fleet and armies. This indeed appears to be a consideration of some weight: But then, on the other side, several things deserve to be considered likewise: As, first, whether it may not be thought necessary that in certain tracts of country, like what we call parishes, there shall be one man at least of abilities to read and write. Then it seems a wrong computation, that the revenues of the Church throughout this island would be large enough to maintain two hundred young gentlemen, or even half that number, after the present refined way of living; that is, to allow each of them such a rent, as in the modern form of speech, would make them easy. But still there is in this project a greater mischief behind; and we ought to beware of the woman's folly, who killed the hen that every morning laid her a golden egg. For, pray what would become of the race of men in the next age, if we had nothing to trust to beside the scrofulous, consumptive productions, furnished by our men of wit and pleasure, when, having squandered away their vigour, health and estates, they are forced by some disagreeable marriage to piece up their broken fortunes, and entail rottenness and politeness on their posterity? Now, here are ten thousand persons reduced by the wise regulations of Henry the Eighth,[9] to the necessity of a low diet, and moderate exercise, who are the only great restorers of our breed, without which the nation would in an age or two become one great hospital.  [Footnote 9: His seizures of the revenues of the Church. [T.S.]]  Another advantage proposed by the abolishing of Christianity, is the clear gain of one day in seven, which is now entirely lost, and consequently the kingdom one seventh less considerable in trade, business, and pleasure, besides the loss to the public of so many stately structures now in the hands of the Clergy, which might be converted into playhouses, exchanges, market houses, common dormitories, and other public edifices.

It contains nothing unusual, and is probably perfectly explicable psychologically by means of dreams.  There is little or no change in this underlying belief to be observed in the burial customs of the Egyptians during the late predynastic period.  Copper weapons and implements succeed stone in the graves.  All those objects in whose manufacture the new tools are used show changes of technique and form.  It is even curious to note that some of the older stone and flint objects, some of the older pots and pans, are still made as a matter of tradition.  The importance of this is not to be overlooked.  For centuries men had used flint knives and they had baked their bread in flat mud saucers set in the ashes.  For the centuries these flint knives and these cakes with their saucers had been placed in the graves.  Gradually metal knives and better bread pans displaced these more primitive objects in daily life; but the older primitive objects were still placed in the graves as a matter of tradition.  It must be remembered, of course, that these traditional objects were also in use in ancient traditional ceremonies on earth.  The sacrificial animals were still slaughtered with flint knives.  The old-style cakes were still offered in the holy places.  In other words, life on earth now consisted of ordinary material life and a traditional life--a life that clung to the forms of a more primitive civilization as somehow more effective with the divine powers.  This view is closely reflected in the grave furniture; here, too, were the practical objects and the traditional ceremonial objects.  Life after death is still always the same as life on earth--with the same physical needs, with the same need of help from supernatural powers or against supernatural powers. The spirit of the man needed the spirit of the copper axe to swing in battle; but just as much he needed the spirit of the flint knife to make the first cut across the throat of the spirit bull of sacrifice.  Remember this--the other world, in which lived the spirit of the dead, was filled with the spirits or ghosts of all things and animals.  The other, the unseen, was a duplicate of this world; all things which have shape were there --even to the black fields and the broad river of Egypt.  This is the foundation of the Egyptian conception of immortality.  Through all the modifications and accretions of the following three thousand years, this foundation idea is always clearly visible. All the statues, the carved and painted tombs, all the curious little model boats and workshops, all the painted mummies, all the amulets, the scarabs, the little funerary statuettes,--all this mummery which seems to be so characteristic and so essential, is only the means to an end, and an ever changing means to secure a successful comfortable existence of the spirit in the life after death,--in the ghostly duplicate of life on earth.     IV. THE EARLY DYNASTIC PERIOD   It is clear that the effort to attain an immortality which is merely a ghostly continuation of life on earth must reflect the general development of Egyptian culture,--especially the advance in arts and crafts.  One of the most striking examples of this fact is the introduction of metal working mentioned above and the consequent placing of both flint and copper in the grave, --the division of grave furniture into practical objects and ceremonial objects, which is the foundation for the use of symbolic objects in later times.  The advance in arts and crafts not only suggests new ideas of the necessities of the spirit, but it provides the necessary technical skill for the more effective satisfaction of all the needs of the dead.  This takes, first of all, the form of supplying a place for the burial, which furnishes greater security to the body and a better communication between the living and the dead.  From the First Dynasty, say from 3300 B.C. down, as soon as the Egyptian had mastered the use of mud-brick and wood, we gain the certainty of an idea which could only be guessed at in the primitive period.  A place is provided above the grave at which the living could meet the spirit of the dead with _periodical_ offerings of food and other necessities.  In the life after death, spirit food and drink, once used, ceased to be, just as in life on earth, and had to be renewed from day to day, lest the spirit of the dead suffer from hunger and thirst.  One of the great developments of the first six dynasties looked to the provision of these daily necessities.  The invention of writing was immediately utilized.  About the beginning of the First Dynasty writing was invented for administrative and other practical purposes.  Gravestones, bearing in relief the name of the dead, were set up in the offering places of the kings and court people.  These were probably reminders for use in some simple formula recited in presenting the periodical offerings.  As the Egyptians became more familiar with the use of writing, the offering formula was written out in full, enlarged and modified.  Sculptures, both relief and statuary, in every stage of their development, were used as magical accessories to the offering rites.  So, also, the whole history of Egyptian architecture was reflected in the tomb; for every advance brought about some change in the form or structure.  In fact, the whole development of the form of the Egyptian tomb depended on the development of technical skill.  The same funerary functions are served throughout.  As all the great artisans were at the command of the king, all the great technical discoveries and inventions were first made in his service.  But every permanent gain in knowledge was a benefit to the race and utilized by the common people.  So, for example, the skill acquired in stone-cutting, during the construction of the great pyramids, was utilized a little later in producing rock-cut tombs from one end of Egypt to the other.  The functions of the grave remained the same.  Yet with the changes in form resulting from the growth of skill, modifications in the funerary customs crept in.  The mud-brick tombs of the early part of the First Dynasty, like the pre-dynastic graves, had only one chamber, limited in size by the length of logs obtainable to form the roof.  The growing desire for ostentation found a way to enlarge the tombs by building them with a number of chambers.  The burial was placed in the central chamber and the burial furniture in the additional chambers.  In this way the separation of the furniture and the actual burial was brought about.     V. THE OLD EMPIRE   Another change comes in the Fourth Dynasty, and is to be noted first in the royal tombs, as is always the case.  The Egyptians had now learned to cut stone and build with it.  The burial chambers hollowed in the solid rock were necessarily smaller than the old chambers dug in the gravel and no longer sufficient to contain the great mass of furniture gathered by a king for his grave.  On the other hand, the chapels with the increase in architectural skill could be build of great size.  Corresponding to these technical conditions we find a great increase in the importance of the chapel.  It becomes a great temple, whose magazines were filled with all those objects which had formerly been placed in the burial chamber and were so necessary to the life of the spirit.  The temples of the third pyramid, for example, contained nearly two thousand stone vessels.  Great estates were set aside by will, and the income appointed to the support of certain persons who on their side were obliged to keep up the temple, to make the offerings and to recite the magical formulas which would provide the spirit with all its necessities.  Following closely the growth in importance of the royal chapels, the private offering places assumed a greater importance.  The custom of periodic offerings and the use of magical texts grew until it reached its highest point in the Fifth Dynasty.  At this time there is a burial chamber deep underground where the dead was laid securely in ancient traditional attitude, with his clothing and a few personal ornaments.  As a rule, it is only the women, always conservative, that have anything more.  Above this grave, there is a solid rectangular structure, with a chapel or offering place on the side towards the valley.  The offering place is always there, no matter how poor or small the tomb.  But to understand just what the Egyptian thought, we must turn to the better tombs.  The walls are of limestone carved with reliefs representing the important processes of daily life,--sowing, reaping, cattle-herding, hunting, pot-making, weaving,--all those actions which furnish the daily supplies.  The dead man is represented overseeing all this.  Finally, near the offering niche, he is represented seated, usually with his wife at a table bearing loaves of the traditional _ta_ bread.  Beside him are represented heaps of provisions--meat, cakes, vegetables, wine and beer.  A list of objects is never missing, marked with numbers,--a thousand loaves of bread, a thousand head of cattle, a thousand jars of wine, a thousand garments, and so on. We know from latter inscriptions that these words, properly recited, created for the spirit a store of spirit objects in equal numbers.  Below the niche is an altar for receiving actual offerings of food and drink.  It is clear that the living, coming to this offering place with or without material offerings, could, by proper recitation, secure to the spirit of the dead all its daily needs.  This offering niche is the door of the other world --symbolically and actually.  In many graves the niche is carved to represent a door--sometimes opening in, and sometimes opening out.  Moreover, in several cases the figure of the dead is carved half emerging from the opening door--a figure in all ways like the figure of the dead as he is represented in the scenes from life."]]]
