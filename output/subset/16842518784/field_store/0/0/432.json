When the watch had been run up to twenty dollars, it seemed to Baard that his brother was not acting rightly, and he continued to bid until he got it almost up to thirty; as Anders kept on, it struck Baard that his brother could not remember how kind he had always been to him, nor that he was the elder of the two, and the watch went up to over thirty dollars.  Anders still kept on.  Then Baard suddenly bid forty dollars, and ceased to look at his brother.  It grew very still in the auction-room, the voice of the lensmand one was heard calmly naming the price.  Anders, standing there, thought if Baard could afford to give forty dollars he could also, and if Baard grudged him the watch, he might as well take it.  He bid higher.  This Baard felt to be the greatest disgrace that had ever befallen him; he bid fifty dollars, in a very low tone.  Many people stood around, and Anders did not see how his brother could so mock at him in the hearing of all; he bid higher. At length Baard laughed.  \"A hundred dollars and my brotherly affection in the bargain,\" said he, and turning left the room.  A little later, some one came out to him, just as he was engaged in saddling the horse he had bought a short time before.  \"The watch is yours,\" said the man; \"Anders has withdrawn.\"  The moment Baard heard this there passed through him a feeling of compunction; he thought of his brother, and not of the watch.  The horse was saddled, but Baard paused with his hand on its back, uncertain whether to ride away or no.  Now many people came out, among them Anders, who when he saw his brother standing beside the saddled horse, not knowing what Baard was reflecting on, shouted out to him:--  \"Thank you for the watch, Baard!  You will not see it run the day your brother treads on your heels.\"  \"Nor the day I ride to the gard again,\" replied Baard, his face very white, swinging himself into the saddle.  Neither of them ever again set foot in the house where they had lived with their father.  A short time after, Anders married into a houseman's family; but Baard was not invited to the wedding, nor was he even at church.  The first year of Anders' marriage the only cow he owned was found dead beyond the north side of the house, where it was tethered, and no one could find out what had killed it.  Several misfortunes followed, and he kept going downhill; but the worst of all was when his barn, with all that it contained, burned down in the middle of the winter; no one knew how the fire had originated.  \"This has been done by some one who wishes me ill,\" said Anders,--and he wept that night.  He was now a poor man and had lost all ambition for work.  The next evening Baard appeared in his room.  Anders was in bed when he entered, but sprang directly up.  \"What do you want here?\" he cried, then stood silent, staring fixedly at his brother.  Baard waited a little before he answered,--  \"I wish to offer you help, Anders; things are going badly for you.\"  \"I am faring as you meant I should, Baard!  Go, I am not sure that I can control myself.\"  \"You mistake, Anders; I repent\"--  \"Go, Baard, or God be merciful to us both!\"  Baard fell back a few steps, and with quivering voice he murmured,--  \"If you want the watch you shall have it.\"  \"Go, Baard!\" shrieked the other, and Baard left, not daring to linger longer.  Now with Baard it had been as follows: As soon as he had heard of his brother's misfortunes, his heart melted; but pride held him back.  He felt impelled to go to church, and there he made good resolves, but he was not able to carry them out.  Often he got far enough to see Anders' house; but now some one came out of the door; now there was a stranger there; again Anders was outside chopping wood, so there was always something in the way.  But one Sunday, late in the winter, he went to church again, and Anders was there too.  Baard saw him; he had grown pale and thin; he wore the same clothes as in former days when the brothers were constant companions, but now they were old and patched. During the sermon Anders kept his eyes fixed on the priest, and Baard thought he looked good and kind; he remembered their childhood and what a good boy Anders had been.  Baard went to communion that day, and he made a solemn vow to his God that he would be reconciled with his brother whatever might happen.  This determination passed through his soul while he was drinking the wine, and when he rose he wanted to go right to him and sit down beside him; but some one was in the way and Anders did not look up.  After service, too, there was something in the way; there were too many people; Anders' wife was walking at his side, and Baard was not acquainted with her; he concluded that it would be best to go to his brother's house and have a serious talk with him. When evening came he set forth.  He went straight to the sitting-room door and listened, then he heard his name spoken; it was by the wife.  \"He took the sacrament to-day,\" said she; \"he surely thought of you.\"  \"No; he did not think of me,\" said Anders.  \"I know him; he thinks only of himself.\"  For a long time there was silence; the sweat poured from Baard as he stood there, although it was a cold evening.  The wife inside was busied with a kettle that crackled and hissed on the hearth; a little infant cried now and then, and Anders rocked it.  At last the wife spoke these few words:--  \"I believe you both think of each other without being willing to admit it.\"  \"Let us talk of something else,\" replied Anders.  After a while he got up and moved towards the door.  Baard was forced to hide in the wood-shed; but to that very place Anders came to get an armful of wood.  Baard stood in the corner and saw him distinctly; he had put off his threadbare Sunday clothes and wore the uniform he had brought home with him from the war, the match to Baard's, and which he had promised his brother never to touch but to leave for an heirloom, Baard having given him a similar promise.  Anders' uniform was now patched and worn; his strong, well-built frame was encased, as it were, in a bundle of rags; and, at the same time, Baard heard the gold watch ticking in his own pocket.  Anders walked to where the fagots lay; instead of stooping at once to pick them up, he paused, leaned back against the wood-pile and gazed up at the sky, which glittered brightly with stars.  Then he drew a sigh and muttered,--  \"Yes--yes--yes;--O Lord!  O Lord!\"  As long as Baard lived he heard these words.  He wanted to step forward, but just then his brother coughed, and it seemed so difficult, more was not required to hold him back.  Anders took up his armful of wood, and brushed past Baard, coming so close to him that the twigs struck his face, making it smart.  For fully ten minutes he stood as if riveted to the spot, and it is doubtful when he would have left, had he not, after his great emotion, been seized with a shivering fit that shook him through and through. Then he moved away; he frankly confessed to himself that he was too cowardly to go in, and so he now formed a new plan.  From an ash-box which stood in the corner he had just left, he took some bits of charcoal, found a resinous pine-splint, went up to the barn, closed the door and struck a light.  When he had lit the pine-splint, he held it up to find the wooden peg where Anders hung his lantern when he came early in the morning to thresh.  Baard took his gold watch and hung it on the peg, blew out his light and left; and then he felt so relieved that he bounded over the snow like a young boy.  The next day he heard that the barn had burned to the ground during the night.  No doubt sparks had fallen from the torch that had lit him while he was hanging up his watch.  This so overwhelmed him that he kept his room all day like a sick man, brought out his hymn-book, and sang until the people in the house thought he had gone mad.  But in the evening he went out; it was bright moonlight.  He walked to his brother's place, dug in the ground where the fire had been, and found, as he had expected, a little melted lump of gold.  It was the watch.  It was with this in his tightly closed hand that he went in to his brother, imploring peace, and was about to explain everything.  A little girl had seen him digging in the ashes, some boys on their way to a dance had noticed him going down toward the place the preceding Sunday evening; the people in the house where he lived testified how curiously he had acted on Monday, and as every one knew that he and his brother were bitter enemies, information was given and a suit instituted.  No one could prove anything against Baard, but suspicion rested on him. Less than ever, now, did he feel able to approach his brother.  Anders had thought of Baard when the barn was burned, but had spoken of it to no one.  When he saw him enter his room, the following evening, pale and excited, he immediately thought: \"Now he is smitten with remorse, but for such a terrible crime against his brother he shall have no forgiveness.\"  Afterwards he heard how people had seen Baard go down to the barn the evening of the fire, and, although nothing was brought to light at the trial, Anders firmly believed his brother to be guilty.  They met at the trial; Baard in his good clothes, Anders in his patched ones.  Baard looked at his brother as he entered, and his eyes wore so piteous an expression of entreaty that Anders felt it in the inmost depths of his heart.  \"He does not want me to say anything,\" thought Anders, and when he was asked if he suspected his brother of the deed, he said loudly and decidedly, \"No!\"  Anders took to hard drinking from that day, and was soon far on the road to ruin.  Still worse was it with Baard; although he did not drink, he was scarcely to be"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12644"],["title","Through the Iron Bars: Two Years of German Occupation in Belgium (#1)"],["body","women sobbed on seeing them, others cursed their guards, others plundered a flower shop and showered flowers upon them. At last two stalwart workmen shouldered away the escort, and, helped by the crowd, which paralysed the movements of the Germans, succeeded in kidnapping the prisoners, and getting them away to the neighbouring streets. They could never be discovered, and it was the last display of the kind which the Governor gave to Brussels.  During the siege, people had learnt to recognize the voice of every fort of Antwerp. They said to each other: \"That is Lizele, Wavre Ste. Catherine, Waelhem.\" One after the other the Belgian guns were silenced, first Wavre, then Waelhem ... and the vibrating boom of the German heavies was heard louder than ever. The listening Bruxellois grew paler, straining every nerve to catch the voice of Antwerp. It was as if their own life as a nation was slowly dying away, as if they were mourning their own agony. But still the valiant spirit of the first days prevailed. \"They will be beaten for all that. What was Antwerp compared with the Marne? All forts must fall under 'their' artillery. After all, the nest is empty; the King and the army are safe.\"  Since those days a kind of reckless indifference has seized the Belgians. If we must lose everything to gain everything, let us lose it. The sooner the better. It is the spirit of a poor man burning his furniture in order to shelter his children from cold, or of a Saint suffering every physical privation in order to gain the Kingdom of Heaven. It is an uncanny spirit composed of wild energy and bitter-sweet irony. \"First Liège, then Brussels, then Namur, now Antwerp. The King has gone, the Government has gone. If all Belgium has to go, let it go. It is the price we have to pay. The victory of our soul shall be all the greater if our body is shattered and tortured.\"  Henceforth, the voice of Belgium reaches us only from time to time. Its sound is muffled by the enemy's strangle-hold, which grows tighter and tighter. Before the fall of Antwerp, the German administration of General von der Goltz had merely a temporary character. We knew that most of the high officials were stopping in Brussels on their way to Paris. On the other hand, any skilful move of the Allies, any successful sortie from Antwerp, might have jeopardized all the conqueror's plans and necessitated an immediate retreat. The Yser-Ypres struggle barred the way to Brussels as well as to Calais. The Germans knew now that they were safe, at least for a good many months, and began systematically to \"organize the country.\" All communications with the uninterrupted part of Belgium were interrupted. It became more and more difficult and dangerous to cross the Dutch frontier without a special permit. The economic and moral pressure increased steadily, and the conflict between conquerors and patriots began, a conflict unrelieved by dramatic interest or excitement from outside, which carried the country back to the worst days of Austrian and Spanish domination.     II.  THE LOWERED FLAG.   The contrast which I have endeavoured to indicate, in the first chapter, between the attitude of the German administration before the fall of Antwerp and its behaviour afterwards is nowhere so well marked as in the measures taken for the purpose of repressing all Belgian manifestations of patriotism.  During the two first months of occupation, the Germans made at least a show of respecting the loyal feelings of the population. In his first proclamation, dated September 2nd, in which he announced his appointment as General Governor of Belgium, Baron von der Goltz declared that \"he asked no one to renounce his patriotic feelings.\" And when, a few days later, the Governor of Brussels, Baron von Luttwitz, issued a poster \"advising\" the citizens to take their flags from their windows, he did this in conciliatory words, giving the pretext that these manifestations might provoke reprisals from the German troops passing through the town: \"The Military Governor does not intend in the least to hurt, by such a measure, the feelings and self-respect of the inhabitants. His only aim is to protect them against all harm.\" (September 16th.) Every Belgian was still wearing the national colours, pictures of the King and Queen were sold in the streets, and the Brabançonne was hummed, whistled, and sung all over the country. The people had lost every right but one: they could still show the enemy, in spite of the declarations of the German Press, that they were not yet ready to accept his rule.  This apparent tolerance is easy to explain. After the massacres of August, the German authorities were anxious not to exasperate public opinion, and not to spoil by uselessly vexatious measures the effect which had been produced. During the Marne and the three sorties of the Belgian army, they had only a very small number of men at their disposal to garrison the largest towns. The slightest progress of the Belgian army might have endangered their line of communications. We know now that the withdrawal of the seat of the government from Brussels to Liege was at one moment seriously contemplated, and that the same troops were made to pass again and again through the streets of the capital in order to give the illusion that the garrison was stronger than it really was (_Frankfurter Zeitung_, August 22nd, 1916). Besides, Germany had not yet given up all hopes of coming to terms with King Albert, since a third attempt was to be made at Antwerp to separate the Belgian Government from the Allies. In these circumstances it seemed wiser to let the Belgian folk indulge in their harmless manifestations of loyalty, so long as they did not cause any disturbance and did not complicate the task of the military.  Let us look now at the next phase. As soon as the Belgian army has achieved its junction with the Allies on the Yser and all communications are cut between the Government and the people, the Germans cease to consider Belgium as an occupied territory, and seize upon every pretext to treat her as a conquered country, which will, sooner or later, become part of the Empire. They no longer take the trouble to explain or justify their oppressive measures, or to reconcile them with their former promises. They simply ignore them. First in Namur (November the 15th, 1914), then in Brussels (June the 30th, 1915), it becomes a crime to wear the tricolour cockade. The Te Deum, which is celebrated every year, on November 15th, in honour of King Albert's Saint's day, is forbidden. From the month of March, 1915, it is practically a forbidden thing to sing the Brabançonne, even in the schools. All patriotic manifestations, on the occasion of the King's Birthday (April 8th) and of the anniversary of Belgian Independence day (July 21st) are severely prosecuted.  In some of the orders issued there is still a weak attempt at \"respecting,\" in a German way, \"the people's patriotic feelings.\" The Governor of Namur, for instance, discriminates with the acutest subtlety between wearing the national colours in private and in public, and the Brabançonne can for a time be sung, so long as it is not rendered \"in a provoking manner.\" In fact, the Belgians are free to manifest their patriotism so long as they are neither seen nor heard. They are generously allowed to line their cupboards with tricolour paper and to hum their national tunes in the depth of their cellars. But, in most of the orders made under Governor von Bissing's rule (his reign began on December 3rd, 1914), this last pretence of consideration and respect disappears entirely. \"I warn the public,\" declares the Governor of Brussels on July the 18th, 1914, \"that any demonstration whatsoever is forbidden on July 21st next.\"  More than that, the German Administration frequently goes out of its way to hurt the people's feelings. The fact of helping a patriot to join the Army is not merely punished as a crime against the Germans, it is delicately called \"a crime of treason,\" and when people are condemned because they are suspected of belonging to the Belgian intelligence service, the public posters announcing their condemnation speak of them as supplying information \"to the enemy.\"  The sham tolerance of the first days has given way to a restless repression, and even, during the last year, to deliberate persecution. Schools may be inspected at any time by the authorities and every \"anti-German manifestation\" (that is to say, any pro-Belgian teaching) is severely punished. Shops are raided so that every patriotic picture post-card (especially the portraits of the Royal Family) may be seized, and even the intimacy of the private home is not respected. To begin with, the Belgians have been allowed to show their loyalty--with discretion; next, every patriotic manifestation is excluded from public life; and last, the Germans, through their spies, penetrate the homes of every citizen, and endeavour to extirpate by a reign of terror these same feelings which they so emphatically promised to respect.         *       *       *       *       *  People who are leading a quiet life and who enjoy the blessings of an autonomous Government will perhaps not appreciate the importance which the Belgians attach, at the present moment, to these patriotic manifestations. They may imagine that, so long as national life is assured and citizens are otherwise left alone by their conquerors, public affirmation of loyalty to King and country is of secondary importance.  God knows that the economic situation of occupied Belgium is bad enough, and the endless and tragic lists of condemnations and deportations are there to prove that her people are living under the most barbarous regime of modern times. But, even if this was not the case, anybody with the slightest knowledge of their national character would understand the extraordinary value which the Belgians attached to their last privilege and the deep indignation"]]]
