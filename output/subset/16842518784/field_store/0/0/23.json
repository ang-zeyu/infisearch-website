One day Lord Hastings had come home with the announcement that he had been called back into the diplomatic service. It was the aim of the British government to align Greece and Roumania on the side of the Allies. Realizing that they could not hope to accompany Lord Hastings, and not wishing to remain idle longer, Frank and Jack had requested Lord Hastings to have them assigned on active duty at once. Lord Hastings promised to do his best.  And this was the reason that Frank Chadwick and Jack Templeton found themselves aboard H.M.S. _Queen Mary_ when she steamed out to the North Sea on an evening in the last week of May, 1916.    CHAPTER II  A BIT OF HISTORY   Up to this time the German Sea fleet, as a unit, had suffered comparatively little damage in the great war. Sheltered as it was behind the great fortress of Heligoland, the British sea forces had been unable to reach it; nor would the Germans venture forth to give battle to the English, in spite of the bait that more than once had been placed just outside the mine fields that guarded the approach to the great German fortress itself.  To have attacked this fortress would have been foolhardy and the British knew it. The British fleet, powerful though it was, would have been no match for the great guns of the German fortress, even had the battleships been able to force a passage of the mine fields; and this latter feat would have been a wonderful one in itself, could it be accomplished.  Upon several occasions German battleships, cruisers and submarines had ventured from behind the mine field and had delivered raids upon the British coast, almost 400 miles away. How they escaped the eyes of the waiting British was a riddle that so far had not been explained. But while they reached alien shores in safety, they had not returned with the same success. Twice the British had come into contact with these German raiders and in each case the enemy had come off second best. Several German cruisers had been sent to the bottom.  After occasions like these, the Germans would lie long behind their snug walls before venturing forth into the open again. They held the British navy in too great awe to treat it lightly.  But the fact that the British were able to keep the German fleet bottled up was a victory in itself, though a bloodless one. Practically all commerce with Germany had been shut off. It settled down to a question of how long the German Empire could survive without the necessary food and other commodities reaching her shores. What little in the way of foodstuffs did reach Germany came by the way of the Scandinavian countries--Norway, Sweden and Denmark; also some grain was still being shipped in by the way of Roumania and was being transported up the Danube, which had been opened to traffic again after Serbia had been crushed.  But these supplies were not great enough to take care of the whole German population. In the conquest of Russian Poland, Germany had improved her lot somewhat, for the fertile fields had immediately been planted and a good crop had been reaped.  And the one thing that prevented Germany from importing the things that would in the end be necessary to her existence was the British supremacy of the sea, abetted now somewhat by the navies of France, Italy and Japan. German commerce had been cleared from the seven seas. What vessels of war had been scattered over the world at the outbreak of the war had either been sent to the bottom, captured or were interned in foreign ports. These latter were of no value to Germany.  It had been more than a year now since the last German commerce raider had been sunk. The German commercial flag was seen no more in the four corners of the globe. It appeared that Germany was nearing the end of her rope.  And yet, bottled up in Heligoland, remained the German high sea fleet practically intact. It was a formidable fleet and one, it seemed, that should not be afraid to venture from behind the protection of the fortress. And some day, the world knew, when all other ways had failed, this great fleet would steam forth to give battle to the British, in a last effort of the German Emperor to turn the tide in his favor; and while, in the allied nations at least, there was no doubt of the ultimate outcome of such a struggle, it was realized that the German fleet would give a good account of itself when it did venture forth.  Therefore, it was considered just as well that the British keep the German high sea fleet bottled up and give it no chance to reach the open, where, although the greater part might be sent to the bottom, some vessels might escape and embark upon a cruise of commerce warfare. This bloodless victory, it was pointed out, was of just as great value to Great Britain as if all the German ships of war had been at the bottom of the North Sea. Bottled up as they were, they were just as ineffective.  This was the situation, then, when the _Queen Mary,_ with Jack and Frank aboard, steamed down the Thames and out into the North Sea to take up again her patrol of those waters; and there was nothing to warn those on board of the great battle that even now was impending and that was to result disastrously for Great Britain, even though the Germans were to suffer no less.  Mess over, Frank and Jack made their way to their own quarters amidships. Here they sat down and for some time talked over the events of the days gone by.  \"I guess there will be nothing for us to do this night,\" said Frank at last. \"We may as well turn in.\"  \"I am afraid there will be nothing for us to do for some time to come,\" was Jack's reply. \"I am afraid it will be rather monotonous sailing about the North Sea looking for German warships, when the latter are afraid to come out and fight.\"  \"Well, you can't tell,\" said Frank. \"However, that's one beauty of a submarine. You don't have to wait around for something to happen. You can go out and make it happen.\"  \"That's so. But, by Jove! I wish these fellows would come out and fight! Maybe we could put an end to this war real quickly.\"  \"Yes, but we might not,\" returned Frank.  \"Why, don't you think we can thrash them?\"  \"I suppose we can; but at the same time they can do a lot of damage. Besides, some of them have come out. We've sunk some, of course, but the others have returned safely enough. I can't see any excuse for that.\"  \"It does seem that they should have been caught,\" Jack agreed, \"but I guess Admiral Jellicoe, Admiral Beatty and the admiralty know what is going on.\"  \"Sometimes it doesn't look like it,\" declared Frank. \"I suppose there are still some of these German submarines scooting about almost under our feet.\"  \"I suppose so. However, ordinarily, as you know, they won't attack a battleship. It's too risky. If they miss with the first torpedo, the chances are they will be sunk.\"  \"Well, we sunk a few,\" said Frank.  \"I know we did; but we took long chances.\"  \"The Germans take long chances, too.\"  \"You must have a little German blood in you, Frank,\" said Jack, with a smile. \"If I didn't know you better, I would think you were sticking up for them.\"  \"No, I'm not sticking up for them; but they do things we seem to be afraid to do. To my way of thinking, we should have gone and cleaned up Heligoland a long time ago.\"  \"By Jove! You want the enemy to win this war quickly, don't you?\"  \"No, but----\"  \"Come, now. You know very well what would have happened if we had tried to take a fleet into Heligoland. They would have blown us out of the water.\"  \"Well, such things have been done,\" grumbled Frank. \"I can tell you a couple of cases. At Mobile Bay----\"  \"Oh, I've heard all that before. But conditions now are absolutely different. What was done fifty years ago can't be done today.\"  \"They aren't being done, that much is sure,\" replied Frank. \"But this argument is not doing us any good. Me for a little sleep.\"  \"I'm with you,\" said Jack.  And half an hour later, as the _Queen Mary_ still steamed due east, Frank and Jack slept.  Above, the third officer held the bridge. The great searchlight forward lighted the water for some distance ahead, and aft a second light cast its powerful rays first to port and then to starboard. There was not another vessel in sight.  Farther to the east, other British battleships patrolled the sea, their lights also flashing back and forth. It would be a bold enemy who would venture to run that blockade; and yet, in spite of this, the strictest watch was maintained. For the fact still remained fresh in the minds of the British that upon two occasions the Germans had run the British blockade; and both times the failure of the British to intercept them had resulted in heavy loss of life on the coast, where the German warships had shelled unfortified towns--against all rules of civilized warfare--killing thousands of helpless men, women and children.  It was against some such similar attack that the British warships were patrolling every mile of water. The British coast must be protected. No more German raiders must be allowed to slip through and bombard undefended coast towns.  Also, strict watch was kept aloft. For almost nightly now, huge German Zeppelins were sailing across the sea and dropping bombs upon the coast of Kent, upon Dover, and close even to London itself. It was feared that one of these monsters of the air might swoop down upon the battleships and, with a well directed bomb, send the vessel to the bottom of the sea.  All British war vessels were equipped with anti-aircraft guns and these were ever loaded and ready for action; for there was no telling what moment they might be called into use to repel a foe. Upon several occasions attacks of the Zeppelins had been beaten off with these guns, though, up to date, none had been brought down.  But now there had been perfected a new anti-aircraft gun. With this it was believed that the battleship stood a good chance of bringing down a Zeppelin should it "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10081"],["title","The Boy Allies at Jutland; Or, The Greatest Naval Battle of History (#2)"],["body","near enough.  With such a gun the _Queen Mary_ had been equipped as she was overhauled in dry dock. With this gun went four men. One to stand by the gun at night and keep watch of the sky and a second to do duty in the day time. The other two men stood relief watches and were of additional need should one of the first men be injured, taken sick or killed.  And so it was that, as the _Queen Mary_ continued on her way, one of these men stood by his gun just aft of the bridge, watching the sky. Nor did he shirk his task.  Almost continuously his eye swept the dark heavens, following, as well as he could, in the path of one or the other of the searchlights. He used powerful night glasses for this purpose. Suddenly he gave a start. He looked closely again through his glasses. Then he uttered a cry of alarm.  The third officer, on the bridge, gave an exclamation.  \"What do you see?\" he demanded.  \"Zeppelin,\" was the reply. \"Douse the light aft. Have the man forward see if he can pick up the craft with his flash. About two points east by north.\"  There came sharp commands aboard the _Queen Mary._    CHAPTER III  WARSHIP AND ZEPPELIN   A bell tinkled in the engine room of the _Queen Mary_. The ship slowed down. Captain Raleigh had been called by the third officer. He took the bridge and issued his orders sharply.  There was no telling whether the Zeppelin sighted by the man at the gun would attack the ship, but Captain Raleigh considered it best to be on the safe side. That was why he had left orders to be called immediately should an enemy appear.  Again a bell tinkled in the engine room, following an order from the commander of the _Queen Mary_.  The great engines stopped and became silent.  \"Cut off all lights!\" was the next command.  A moment later the great ship was in darkness.  Frank and Jack, in their quarters, were awakened by the sounds of confusion above. All hands had not been piped on deck, so most of the men still lay asleep, unconscious of what was going on above, but the two lads, dressing hurriedly, made their way on deck. They walked forward, toward the bridge.  All was dark and it was this that told Frank and Jack that something was going on.  \"Wonder what's up?\" said Frank.  \"Airship, I guess,\" was the reply. \"Can't see any other reason for extinguishing all lights.\"  Near the bridge the lads stopped and waited to see what would happen. All was quiet aboard. Not a sound came from the officers or the men on deck. Then Captain Raleigh commanded:  \"Try the forward searchlight there. See if you can pick her up!\"  The light flashed aloft; and there, so far above the _Queen Mary_ as to be little more than a tiny speck, hovered a giant Zeppelin; and even as they looked, the airship came lower.  \"She's sighted us,\" said Captain Raleigh to his first officer, who stood beside him. \"Try a shot, Mr. Harrison.\"  The first officer passed the word and a second later there came the sound of the anti-aircraft gun. The gunner had taken his range at the moment the flashlight revealed the airship.  The shot brought no noticeable result.  \"Fifteen knots ahead, Mr. Harrison!\" ordered the captain.  He was afraid that the Zeppelin might drop a bomb on the ship; and from that moment until the end of the battle the _Queen Mary_ did not pause. First she headed to port and then to starboard, manoeuvering rapidly that the German airmen might not be able to reach her with a bomb.  \"Another shot!\" commanded Captain Raleigh.  Still no result.  \"Funny she doesn't rise and try and escape,\" said Frank.  \"No, it's not,\" returned Jack. \"They don't know anything about this new anti-aircraft gun. They believe they are out of range.\"  \"Well, they're likely to hit us with one of those bombs, and then where will we be?\" said Frank.  \"If they hit us you won't know anything about it,\" was Jack's response.  Again the _Queen Mary_ tried a shot at the Zeppelin.  A cheer went up from the members of the crew who stood upon deck; for the Zeppelin was seen to wabble.  \"Nicked her,\" shouted the first officer.  Jack, standing near the rail, heard something whiz by his head. Instinctively the lad ducked. He knew in a moment what had passed him; he heard something splash into the sea.  \"Bomb just missed us, sir!\" he cried, stepping forward.  \"Where?\" demanded Captain Raleigh.  \"Right here, forward, sir,\" replied Jack.  Captain Raleigh gave a quick command to his first officer, who passed it to the man at the wheel.  \"Hard a-port!\" he cried.  The ship veered crazily; and at the some moment, Frank, who was standing where Jack had been a moment before, heard something swish past.  \"Another bomb, sir!\" he reported.  There was no reply from the bridge. Captain Raleigh felt that, by bringing the ship's head hard to port, he had spoiled the range of the enemy in the air.  For some time no more bombs dropped near.  Again the _Queen Mary_ fired at the Zeppelin; and again and again.  The last shot was rewarded by another cheer from the crew. The giant Zeppelin was seen to drop suddenly.  The crew cheered loud and long for it appeared that the Zeppelin was about to drop into the sea. Down she came and still down; and then her descent suddenly halted.  To those aboard the _Queen Mary_ this was unexplainable.  \"Fire again, quickly!\" shouted the captain.  The air gun boomed. At the same moment a man was seen to lean over the side of the Zeppelin. He dropped something.  Again Captain Raleigh acted promptly and brought the head of the _Queen Mary_ around. The German bomb missed. Before another could be dropped, the man who manned the anti-aircraft gun fired again.  Another cheer from the crew.  The Zeppelin began to sink slowly.  \"Full speed ahead!\" cried Captain Raleigh. \"They'll sink us!\"  The _Queen Mary_ leaped ahead just in time.  And then the Zeppelin dropped.  With a splash it hit the water perhaps a quarter of a mile from the British battleship. Came cries from the men, caught beneath the gas bag. At that moment Jack stood close to the bridge. Captain Raleigh saw him.  \"Man a boat, Mr. Templeton,\" he called, \"and rescue those fellows in the water.\"  Quickly Jack sprang to obey. Frank leaped after him. Hurriedly a small boat was gotten out and launched. A half dozen sailors sprang in and took up the oars. Frank and Jack leaped in after them.  The oars glistened in the glare of the searchlight as the men raised them and awaited the word.  \"Give way,\" said Jack.  The boat sped over the smooth surface of the sea.  Close to the wreckage of the Zeppelin it approached; and cries told Jack that some of the Germans still lived.  \"Hurry!\" he cried, and the men increased their stroke.  Near the wreckage Jack gave the command to cease rowing. A German swam toward the boat. Hands helped him in and he lay in the bottom panting. Other forms swam toward them. These, too, were lifted in the boat. And at last Jack counted fifteen Germans who had been saved.  \"Are you all here?\" he asked of a German officer.  \"All but Commander Butz, sir,\" was the man's reply.  Jack commanded his men to row closer to the wreckage.  \"Ahoy there!\" he shouted, when he had come close.  The lad thought he heard a muffled answer, but he could not make sure. He called again. This time the answer came plainer.  \"Where are you?\" asked Jack.  \"Under the wreckage,\" was the reply.  Jack scrutinized the wreckage closely.  \"Looks like it might sink any minute,\" he said \"But we can't leave him there.\"  \"What are you going to do?\" asked Frank.  For answer Jack arose in the boat. Quickly he threw off his coat and kicked off his shoes. Then he poised himself on the edge of the boat.  \"I'm going after him,\" he replied.  Before Frank could reply, he had dived head first into the sea.  With a cry of alarm, Frank also sprang to his feet and divested himself of his coat and shoes.  \"Stay close, men!\" he commanded. \"I'll lend a hand if it's needed.\"  He, too, leaped into the water.  Rapidly, Jack swam close to the wreckage. He continued to call to the German, and while he received an answer each time, he could not locate the man. Twice he swam around all that remained of the huge Zeppelin. By this time Frank had come up with him.  \"Can't you find him?\" he asked.  \"No,\" returned Jack, \"and I am rather afraid to swim under there. The balloon may sink and carry me under. But if I were certain in exactly what spot the man is imprisoned, I'd have a try at it.\"  Frank listened attentively; and directly the German's voice came again. To Frank it seemed that the voice came from directly ahead of him.  \"Lay hold of this end here,\" he said to Jack. \"If you can lift it a bit I'll go under and have a look.\"  \"Better let me do it, Frank,\" said Jack.  \"No; you're stronger than I am. You can hold this up better.\"  Jack did as his chum requested and a moment later Frank disappeared under the wreckage, diving first to make sure that he got under.  Under the water the lad swam forward. His hand touched something that was threshing about.  He felt sure it was the German. He rose. His head came in contact with something, but the lad opened his eyes and saw that he was above the surface. The imprisoned German was close beside him.  \"Dive!\" said Frank. \"You can come out all right.\"  \"Can't,\" was the reply. \"My arm is caught.\"  Frank made a quick examination.  \"I can loosen it,\" he said at last, \"but I'll probably break the arm.\"  \"Loosen it,\" said the German, quietly.  Frank took a firm hold on the arm at the elbow and gave a quick wrench. He felt something give, and when he released his hold on the man's arm, the latter sank suddenly.  Frank dived after him quickly. It was even as the lad feared. The German had fainted from the pain of the arm, which Frank had broken cleanly as he released it.  Frank dived deep and his outstretched hand encountered the German. The lad grasped the man firmly by the collar and then struck upwards. A moment later he succeeded in making his way to where Jack still tugged at the balloon.  Jack lent a"]]]
