What ho, there! Keep strict watch without; and suffer not this man to pass forth!\"     CHAPTER III. Showing that \"our pleasant vices are made the whips to scourge us.\"   We must now request the reader to visit the noble mansion in the Strand, erected by Thomas Cecil, then Earl of Exeter, and bearing-his name; in a chamber of which Lord Roos and the Countess of Exeter will be found alone together--alone for the last time.  Very different was the deportment of the guilty pair towards each other from what it used to be. The glances they exchanged were no longer those of passionate love, but of undissembled hatred. Bitter reproaches had been uttered on one side, angry menaces on the other. Ever since the fatal order had been wrested from the Countess, her peace of mind had been entirely destroyed, and she had become a prey to all the horrors of remorse. Perceiving the change in her sentiments towards him, Lord Roos strove, by the arts which had hitherto proved so successful, to win back the place he had lost in her affections; but failing in doing so, and irritated by her reproaches, and still more by her coldness, he gave vent to his displeasure in terms that speedily produced a decided quarrel between them; and though reconciled in appearance, they never again were to each other what they had been.  As this was to be their final meeting, they had agreed not to embitter it with unavailing reproaches and recriminations. Lord Roos acquainted the Countess that he had decided upon travelling into Italy and Spain, and remaining abroad for a lengthened period; and the announcement of his intention was received by her without an objection. Perhaps he hoped that when put to this trial she might relent. If so, he was disappointed. She even urged him not to delay his departure, and concluded her speech with these words--  \"Something tells me we shall meet no more in this world. But we are certain to meet hereafter at the Judgment Seat. How shall we regard each other then?\"  \"Trouble me not with the question,\" rejoined Lord Roos gloomily; \"I have not come here to listen to sermons, and will brook no more reproaches.\"  \"I do not mean to reproach you, William,\" she returned meekly; \"but the thought of our dire offence rises perpetually before me. Would we could undo what we have done!\"  \"I tell you it is too late,\" rejoined Lord Roos harshly.  At this moment Diego suddenly presented himself, and apologizing for the abruptness of his entrance, accounted for it by saying that Sarah Swarton besought a word with his Lordship. She brought a message, he added, from Lady Roos, who was much worse, and not finding his Lordship at his own residence had ventured to follow him to Exeter House to deliver it.  \"I will come to her anon,\" said Lord Roos carelessly.  \"No, no; admit her at once, Diego,\" cried the Countess; \"I would hear what she has to say.\" And the next moment Sarah Swarton being ushered into the room, she rushed up to her and eagerly demanded, \"How fares it with your lady? Is there any hope for her?\"  \"None whatever,\" replied Sarah, shaking her head sadly. \"She is past all chance of recovery.\"  \"Then Heaven pardon me!\" ejaculated the Countess, clasping her hands together, and falling upon her knees.  Sarah Swarton gazed at her in astonishment; while Lord Roos, rushing towards her, commanded her to rise.  \"Take heed what you say and do, Countess,\" he whispered. \"You will excite this woman's suspicions.\"  \"Why should your ladyship implore Heaven's pardon because my poor dear lady is near her end?\" inquired Sarah.  \"I sue for it because I have caused her much affliction,\" replied the Countess.  \"Your message, Sarah--your message?\" interposed Lord Roos. \"What have you to say to me?\"  \"My lady desires to see you once more before she expires, my lord,\" replied Sarah. \"She would take leave of you; and--and--she has something to impart to you. You will not refuse her last request?\"  \"He will not--he will not, I am sure,\" cried the Countess, seeing him look irresolute.  \"I did not expect to be seconded by you, my lady,\" observed Sarah, in increasing surprise.  \"Would that I, too, might see her and obtain her forgiveness!\" exclaimed the Countess, without heeding the remark.  \"An idle wish, and not to be indulged,\" said Lord Roos.  A sudden idea appeared to strike Sarah, and she cried, \"Your ladyship's desire may possibly be gratified. My poor lady desires to part in peace with all the world, even with those who have injured her. I will communicate your wishes to her, and it may be she will consent to see you.\"  \"You shall have a reward well worthy of the service if you accomplish it,\" said the Countess. \"Hasten to her with all speed, my Lord, and I will follow in my litter, ready to attend Sarah's summons.\"  \"I like not the plan,\" rejoined Lord Roos. \"You are wrong to go. Why need you see her?\"  \"Why?\" she answered, regarding him fixedly. \"Because it may be some little consolation to me afterwards.\"  \"Then go alone,\" said Lord Roos savagely. \"I will not accompany you.\"  \"I do not ask you to accompany me, but to precede me,\" she replied. \"Now, mark me, my Lord,\" she added in a low, firm tone, \"and be assured I do not advance more than I will perform. If you refuse your wife's dying request, I will go back with Sarah and confess all to her.\"  Lord Roos looked as if he could have annihilated her, and muttered a terrible imprecation on her head.  \"Threaten me--ay, and execute your threats hereafter if you will,\" continued the Countess in the same low decided tone, \"but go you _shall_ now.\"  Her manner was so irresistible that Lord Roos was compelled to obey, and he quitted the room without a word more, followed by Diego and Sarah Swarton, the latter of whom signed to the Countess that she might depend upon the fulfilment of her wishes.  They had not been gone many minutes before Lady Exeter entered her litter, and wholly unattended by page or serving-man, except those in charge of the conveyance, caused herself to be conveyed to Sir Thomas Lake's lodgings in Whitehall.     CHAPTER IV. How the forged Confession was produced.   Summoning up all his firmness for the interview with his lady, Lord Roos entered her chamber, attended by Sarah Swarton, and beheld her propped up by pillows, bearing evident marks in her countenance of the severe sufferings she had endured. She was emaciated in frame, and almost livid in complexion; hollow-cheeked and hollow-eyed; but still with a look of unaltered affection for him.  Having fulfilled her mission, Sarah left them alone together.  He took the thin fingers extended towards him, and pressed them to his lips, but scarcely dared to raise his eyes towards his wife, so much was he shocked by her appearance. It was with difficulty she gave utterance to the words she addressed to him.  \"I thank you for coming to me, my Lord,\" she said; \"but you will not regret your kindness. We are quite alone, are we not? My eyes are so dim that I cannot distinguish any object at the other end of the room--but I can see you plainly enough, my dear Lord.\"  \"We are alone, Elizabeth,\" replied Lord Roos, in a voice of some emotion, after glancing around.  \"Then I may speak freely,\" she continued. \"What I predicted has occurred. You did not do well, my dear Lord, to take that phial from me and place it in other hands. Nay, start not! I know I am poisoned: I have known it from the first. But I have made no effort to save myself, for I was aware it was your will I should die.\"  \"O, Elizabeth!\" murmured her husband.  \"I was aware of it,\" she repeated; \"and as I have never voluntarily disobeyed you, I would not now thwart your purpose, even though I myself must be the sacrifice. It was to tell you this that I have sent for you. It was to forgive--to bless you.\"  And as she spoke she threw her arms round his neck, and he felt his cheek wet with her tears.  \"This is more than I can bear,\" cried Lord Roos, in a voice suffocated by emotion. \"I thought I had firmness for anything; but it deserts me entirely now. You are an angel of goodness, Elizabeth; as I am a demon of darkness. I do not deserve your forgiveness.\"  \"You will deserve it, if you will comply with the request I am about to make to you,\" she rejoined, looking at him beseechingly.  \"Whatever it be it shall be granted, if in my power,\" he rejoined earnestly. \"I would redeem your life, if I could, at the price of my own. You have exorcised the evil spirit from me, Elizabeth.\"  \"Then I shall die happy,\" she replied, with a smile of ineffable delight.  \"But the request! What is it you would have me perform?\" he asked.  \"I would have you spare my mother,\" she replied. \"I know she has been dealt with in the same way as myself; but I also know there is yet time to save her.\"  \"It shall be done,\" said Lord Roos, emphatically. \"Where is she?\"  \"In the adjoining chamber.\"  \"Is Luke Hatton in attendance upon her?\"  \"In constant attendance,\" she rejoined. \"That man has obeyed you well, my Lord. But take heed of him: he is a dangerous weapon, and may injure the hand that employs him. Strike gently upon that bell. He will attend the summons.\"  Lord Roos complied; when, to his astonishment and dismay, the curtains shrouding the entrance to the adjoining room were drawn aside, and Lady Lake stalked from behind them. Never before had she surveyed her son-in-law with such a glance of triumph as she threw upon him now.  \"You were mistaken you see, Elizabeth,\" said Lord Roos to his lady. \"Your mother needs no aid. She is perfectly well.\"  \"Ay, well enough to confound you and all your wicked purposes, my Lord,\" cried Lady Lake. \"You have not accomplished my destruction, as you perceive; nor shall you accomplish your wife's destruction, though you have"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12400"],["title","Bismarck and the Foundation of the German Empire (#1)"],["body","urg, the chief officer at the Court; he had his quarrels with the Church, or rather with the spiritual lords, the bishops of Havelburg and Magdeburg, and was once excommunicated, as his father had been before him, and as two of his sons were after him.  Claus died about the year 1385. For two hundred years the Bismarcks continued to live at Burgstall, to which they added many other estates. When Conrad of Hohenzollern was appointed Margrave and Elector, he found sturdy supporters in the lords of Burgstall; he and his successors often came there to hunt the deer and wild boars, perhaps also the wolves and bears, with which the forests around the castle abounded; for the Hohenzollerns were keen sportsmen then as now, as their vassals found to their cost. In 1555, Hans George, son of the reigning Elector, Albert Achilles, bought the neighbouring estate of Letzlingen from the Alvenslebens; there he built a house which is still the chief hunting-lodge of the Kings of Prussia. Soon he cast envious eyes on the great woods and preserves which belong to Burgstall, and intimated that he wished to possess them. The Bismarcks resisted long. First they were compelled to surrender their hunting rights; this was not sufficient; the appetite of the Prince grew; in his own words he wished \"to be rid of the Bismarcks from the moor and the Tanger altogether.\" He offered in exchange some of the monasteries which had lately been suppressed; the Bismarcks (the family was represented by two pairs of brothers, who all lived together in the great castle) long refused; they represented that their ancestors had been faithful vassals; they had served the Electors with blood and treasure; they wished \"to remain in the pleasant place to which they had been assigned by God Almighty.\" It was all of no use; the Prince insisted, and his wrath was dangerous. The Bismarcks gave in; they surrendered Burgstall and received in exchange Schoenhausen and Crevisse, a confiscated nunnery, on condition that as long as the ejected nuns lived the new lords should support them; for which purpose the Bismarcks had annually to supply a certain quantity of food and eighteen barrels of beer.  Of the four co-proprietors, all died without issue, except Friedrich, called the Permutator, in whose hands the whole of the family property was again collected; he went to live at Schoenhausen, which since then has been the home of the family. No remains of the old castle exist, but the church, built in the thirteenth century, is one of the oldest and most beautiful in the land between the Havel and the Elbe. House and church stand side by side on a small rising overlooking the Elbe. Here they took up their abode; the family to some extent had come down in the world. The change had been a disadvantageous one; they had lost in wealth and importance. For two hundred years they played no very prominent part; they married with the neighbouring country gentry and fought in all the wars. Rudolph, Friedrich's son, fought in France in behalf of the Huguenots, and then under the Emperor against the Turks. His grandson, August, enlisted under Bernhard of Saxe-Weimar; afterwards he fought in the religious wars in France and Germany, always on the Protestant side; lastly, he took service under the Elector of Brandenburg.  It was in his lifetime that a great change began to take place which was to alter the whole life of his descendants. In 1640, Frederick William, known as the great Elector, succeeded his father. He it was who laid the foundations for that system of government by which a small German principality has grown to be the most powerful military monarchy in modern Europe. He held his own against the Emperor; he fought with the Poles and compelled their King to grant him East Prussia; he drove the Swedes out of the land. More than this, he enforced order in his own dominions; he laid the foundation for the prosperity of Berlin; he organised the administration and got together a small but efficient military force. The growing power of the Elector was gained to a great extent at the expense of the nobles; he took from them many of the privileges they had before enjoyed. The work he began was continued by his son, who took the title of King; and by his grandson, who invented the Prussian system of administration, and created the army with which Frederick the Great fought his battles.  The result of the growth of the strong, organised monarchy was indeed completely to alter the position of the nobles. The German barons in the south had succeeded in throwing off the control of their territorial lords; they owned no authority but the vague control of the distant Emperor, and ruled their little estates with an almost royal independence; they had their own laws, their own coinage, their own army. In the north, the nobles of Mecklenburg Holstein, and Hanover formed a dominant class, and the whole government of the State was in their hands; but those barons whose homes fell within the dominion of the Kings of Prussia found themselves face to face with a will and a power stronger than their own; they lost in independence, but they gained far more than they lost. They were the basis on which the State was built up; they no longer wasted their military prowess in purposeless feuds or in mercenary service; in the Prussian army and administration they found full scope for their ambition, and when the victories of Frederick the Great had raised Prussia to the rank of a European Power, the nobles of Brandenburg were the most loyal of his subjects. They formed an exclusive caste; they seldom left their homes; they were little known in the south of Germany or in foreign countries; they seldom married outside their own ranks. Their chief amusement was the chase, and their chief occupation was war. And no king has ever had under his orders so fine a race of soldiers; they commanded the armies of Frederick and won his battles. Dearly did they pay for the greatness of Prussia; of one family alone, the Kleists, sixty-four fell on the field of battle during the Seven Years' War.  They might well consider that the State which they had helped to make, and which they had saved by their blood, belonged to them. But if they had become Prussians, they did not cease to be Brandenburgers; their loyalty to their king never swerved, for they knew that he belonged to them as he did to no other of his subjects. He might go to distant Königsberg to assume the crown, but his home was amongst them; other provinces might be gained or lost with the chances of war, but while a single Hohenzollern lived he could not desert his subjects of the Mark. They had the intense local patriotism so characteristic of the German nation, which is the surest foundation for political greatness; but while in other parts the Particularists, as the Germans called them, aimed only at independence, the Brandenburger who had become a Prussian desired domination.  Among them the Bismarcks lived. The family again divided into two branches: one, which became extinct about 1780, dwelling at Crevisse, gave several high officials to the Prussian Civil Service; the other branch, which continued at Schoenhausen, generally chose a military career. August's son, who had the same name as his father, rebuilt the house, which had been entirely destroyed by the Swedes during the Thirty Years' War; he held the position of Landrath, that is, he was the head of the administration of the district in which he lived. He married a Fräulein von Katte, of a well-known family whose estates adjoined those of the Bismarcks. Frau von Bismarck was the aunt of the unfortunate young man who was put to death for helping Frederick the Great in his attempt to escape. His tomb is still to be seen at Wust, which lies across the river a few miles from Schoenhausen; and at the new house, which arose at Schoenhausen and still stands, the arms of the Kattes are joined to the Bismarck trefoil. The successor to the estates, August Friedrich, was a thorough soldier; he married a Fräulein von Diebwitz and acquired fresh estates in Pomerania, where he generally lived.  He rose to the rank of colonel, and fell fighting against the Austrians at Chotusitz in 1742. \"Ein ganzer Kerl\" (a fine fellow), said the King, as he stood by the dying officer. His son, Carl Alexander, succeeded to Schoenhausen; the next generation kept up the military traditions of the family; of four brothers, all but one became professional officers and fought against France in the wars of liberation. One fell at Möckern in 1813; another rose to the rank of lieutenant-general; the third also fought in the war; his son, the later Count Bismarck-Bohlen, was wounded at Grossbehren, and the father at once came to take his place during his convalescence, in order that the Prussian army might not have fewer Bismarcks. When the young Otto was born two years later, he would often hear of the adventures of his three uncles and his cousin in the great war. The latter, Bismarck-Bohlen, rose to very high honours and was to die when over eighty years of age, after he had witnessed the next great war with France. It is a curious instance of the divisions of Germany in those days that there were Bismarcks fighting on the French side throughout the war. One branch of the family had settled in South Germany; the head of it, Friedrich Wilhelm, had taken service in the Wurtemburg army; he had become a celebrated leader of cavalry and was passionately devoted to Napoleon. He served with distinction in the Russian campaign and was eventually taken prisoner by the Germans in the battle of Leipzig.  The youngest of the four brothers, Karl Wilhelm Friedrich v. Bismarck, had retired from the army at an early age: he was a quiet, kindly man of domestic tastes; on the division of the estates, Schoenhausen fell to his lot, and he settled down there to a quiet country life. He took a step which must have caused much discussion among all"]]]
