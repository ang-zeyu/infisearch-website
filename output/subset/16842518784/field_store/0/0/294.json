She had a vivid recollection of going tobogganing down the long front walk one winter day, her jolly mother on the sled with her, steering it adroitly around the corner and up the sidewalk for a distance after leaving the slope. Such fun they were having that they did not look to see if the road was clear, and went bumping into a female figure that was coming majestically along the street, knocking her off her feet and into a snowdrift. It was Aunt Phoebe, coming to make a formal afternoon call. She sat bolt upright in the snow and adjusted her lorgnette to see if by any chance her grandniece could be one of those rowdy children. When she discovered that it was not only Hinpoha, but her mother as well, frolicking so indecorously, she was speechless. Mrs. Bradford started to make an abject apology, but the sight of Aunt Phoebe sitting in the snowdrift with her lorgnette was too much for her and she went off into a peal of laughter, in which Hinpoha joined gleefully. It was weeks before Aunt Phoebe could be coaxed to make another visit. And this was the woman who was coming to take the place of Hinpoha's beloved mother!  Aunt Grace left the day she came. There was not enough room in one house for her and Aunt Phoebe. With Aunt Phoebe came \"Silky,\" a wiggling, snapping Skye terrier. He gave one glance at genial Mr. Bob, who was rolling on his back before the fireplace, and with a growl fastened his teeth into his neck. Hinpoha rescued her pet and bore him away to her room, where she shed tears of despair while he licked her hand sympathetically. Aunt Phoebe's first act was to put Hinpoha into deep mourning. Hinpoha objected strenuously, but there was no help, and she went to school swathed from head to foot in black. Nyoda was wrathful at the sight, for if there was one point she felt strongly about it was putting children into mourning. Among the gaily dressed girls Hinpoha stood out like some dark spirit from the underworld, casting a gloom wherever she went.  \"Where is that beautiful vase I brought your mother from the World's Fair?\" asked Aunt Phoebe one day, suddenly missing it.  \"It was accidently broken at our last Camp Fire meeting,\" answered Hinpoha, with a tightening around her heart when she thought of that last happy gathering.  \"Camp Fire!\" said Aunt Phoebe with a snort. \"You don't mean to tell me that you are mixed up in any such foolishness as that?\"  \"I certainly am,\" said Hinpoha energetically, \"and it isn't foolishness, either. I've learned more since I have been a Camp Fire Girl than I did in all the years before.\"  \"Well, you may consider yourself graduated, then,\" said Aunt Phoebe, drily, \"for I'll have no such nonsense about me. I can teach you all you need to know outside of what you learn in school.\"  \"Camp Fire always had mother's fullest approval,\" said Hinpoha darkly.  \"I dare say,\" returned her aunt. \"But I want you to understand once for all that I won't have any girls holding 'meetings' here, to upset the house and break valuable ornaments.\"  \"But you don't care if I go to them at other girls' houses, do you?\" asked Hinpoha, the fear gripping her that she was to be denied the consolation of these weekly gatherings with the Winnebagos.  \"I don't want you to have anything to do with that Camp Fire business,\" said Aunt Phoebe in a tone of finality, and Hinpoha left the room, her heart swelling with bitterness. She was too wise to argue the point with Aunt Phoebe, and resolved to depend on Nyoda to show her the way. She dried her tears and went down to the living room and began to play softly on the piano. It had been her mother's piano, the wedding gift of her father, and it seemed that her mother's spirit hovered over it. It was the first time she had touched the keys since that awful Wednesday when the world had been turned into chaos; she had had no heart to play, but to-day the sound of the music comforted her and her bitter resentment against her aunt lost some of its sting. She played on, lost in memories, when suddenly the sharp voice of her aunt brought her back to earth. \"What does this mean?\" cried Aunt Phoebe, \"playing on the piano when your father and mother have just died! I never heard of such a thing! Come away immediately and don't open that piano again until our period of mourning is over.\" She closed the piano and locked it, putting the key into her bag.  Under Aunt Phoebe's management the house soon lost its look of inviting friendliness. The blinds were always kept drawn, so that even on the brightest days the rooms had a gloomy appearance. No more cheerful wood fires crackled and glowed in the grate. They made ashes on the rugs and were extravagant, as the house was heated by steam. The bookcases were locked and Hinpoha was forbidden to read fiction, as this was not proper when one was in mourning. \"You will become acquainted with much pleasant literature reading to me while I crochet,\" she said when Hinpoha rose in revolt at this edict. The \"pleasant literature\" which Aunt Phoebe was just then perusing was a History of the Presbyterian Church in eleven volumes, which bored Hinpoha so it nearly gagged her.  Besides, Aunt Phoebe constantly found fault with Hinpoha's manner of reading. It was either too loud or not loud enough; either too fast or too slow, but it was never right. That reading aloud was the last straw to Hinpoha. After sitting still a whole afternoon getting her school lessons, she longed to move about after supper, but then Aunt Phoebe expected her to sit still the entire evening and entertain her with the activities of the Early Presbytery. After nearly a week of this deadly dullness Hinpoha was ready to fly. And yet Aunt Phoebe was not conscious that there was anything wrong in the way she was treating Hinpoha. She cared for her in her frozen way. She was merely trying to bring her up in the way she herself had been brought up by a maiden aunt, not taking into account that this was another day and age. In her time it was considered the proper thing to shut down on all lightheartedness after a death in the family, and she was adhering steadfastly to the old principles. She was yet to learn that she could not force obsolete customs upon a girl who had lived for sixteen years in the sunlight of modern ideas.  All Hinpoha's troubles were confided to Nyoda, who sympathized with her entirely, but bade her be of good cheer and hope for the time when Aunt Phoebe would see for herself that the new way was best; and above all to win the respect and liking of her aunt the first thing, as more could be accomplished in this way than by being antagonistic. \"I don't suppose you could go for a long walk with me Sunday afternoon?\" said Nyoda.  Hinpoha shook her head sadly. \"We don't do anything like that on Sunday,\" she answered, with resentment flaming in her eye. \"We go to church morning and evening and in the afternoon I am supposed to read the Bible or a book by a man named Thomas à Kempis.\" Nyoda turned her eyes inward with such a comical expression that Hinpoha forgot her troubles for a moment and laughed.  \"The Bible and Thomas à Kempis,\" said Nyoda musingly; \"where did I hear those two mentioned before? Oh, I have it! Did you ever read this anywhere, 'Commit to memory one hundred verses of the Bible or an equal amount of sacred literature, such as Thomas à Kempis'?\"  Hinpoha hung her head, still smiling. \"Why, Nyoda,\" she said, \"there's a chance to earn an honor bead that I probably wouldn't have thought of otherwise!\"  \"Right-o,\" said Nyoda. \"'It's an ill wind,' you know. And while you are doing so much Bible reading you will undoubtedly come across something about 'in the wilderness a cedar,' and will learn that most waste places can be turned into blooming gardens if we only know how.\"  \"Thank you,\" said Hinpoha, \"I always feel less forlorn after a talk with you.\" Her face brightened, but immediately fell again. \"But what good will it do me to work for honors?\" she said sadly. \"Aunt Phoebe won't let me come to the meetings.\"  \"Won't she really?\" asked Nyoda in surprise. Hinpoha nodded, near to tears. \"I must see about that,\" said Nyoda resolutely. \"I think if I explain the mission and activities of Camp Fire she will not object to your belonging. She probably has a wrong idea of what it means.\"  Accordingly Nyoda came a-calling on Aunt Phoebe that very night. In addition to being very pretty Nyoda had a great deal of dignity, and when she put on her formal manner she looked very impressive indeed. She did not act as if she had come to see Hinpoha at all, but asked for \"Miss Bradford,\" and said she had come to pay her respects to her new neighbor. She listened politely to Aunt Phoebe's account of her last siege of rheumatism, admired her crochet work, and hoped she liked this street as well as her former neighborhood. She said she had often seen Miss Bradford's name in the papers in connection with various charitable organizations and was very glad to have the honor of meeting the sister of the prominent Judge. Aunt Phoebe was pleased and flattered at the deference paid her. But when Nyoda announced herself as the leader of the club to which Hinpoha belonged and asked permission for her to attend the meetings, she refused. She was perfectly polite about it, and did not mention her antipathy to Camp Fire, and taking refuge behind her favorite excuse, that of being in mourning, stated that she did not wish Hinpoha to go out in society.  \"But this isn't 'society',\" broke in Hinpoha desperately.  \"A meeting of a club partakes of a social nature,\" returned her aunt, \"and is not to be thought of.\" And there the matter rested.  So Nyoda had to depart without accomplishing her mission. Hinpoha, utterly crushed, followed her to the door, and Nyoda gave her hand a reassuring squeeze. \"Don't despair, dear,\" she whispered "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11719"],["title","Kincaid's Battery (#1)"],["body","tied their horses behind the hotel crossed the white court toward the garden. They also were in civil dress, yet wore an air that goes only with military training. The taller was Hilary Kincaid, the other his old-time, Northern-born-and-bred school chum, Fred Greenleaf. Kincaid, coming home, had found him in New Orleans, on duty at Jackson Barracks, and for some weeks they had enjoyed cronying. Now they had been a day or two apart and had chanced to meet again at this spot. Kincaid, it seems, had been looking at a point hard by with a view to its fortification. Their manner was frankly masterful though they spoke in guarded tones.  \"No,\" said Kincaid, \"you come with me to this drill. Nobody'll take offence.\"  \"Nor will you ever teach your cousin to handle a battery,\" replied Greenleaf, with a sedate smile.  \"Well, he knows things we'll never learn. Come with me, Fred, else I can't see you till theatre's out--if I go there with her--and you say--\"  \"Yes, I want you to go with her,\" murmured Greenleaf, so solemnly that Kincaid laughed outright.  \"But, after the show, of course,\" said the laugher, \"you and I'll ride, eh?\" and then warily, \"You've taken your initials off all your stuff?... Yes, and Jerry's got your ticket. He'll go down with your things, check them all and start off on the ticket himself. Then, as soon as you--\"  \"But will they allow a slave to do so?\"  \"With my pass, yes; 'Let my black man, Jerry--'\"  The garden took the pair into its depths a moment too soon for the old soldier to see them as he came out upon the side veranda with a cloud on his brow that showed he had heard his nephew's laugh.     II   CARRIAGE COMPANY  Bareheaded the uncle crossed the fountained court, sat down at a table and read again. In the veranda a negro, his own slave, hired to this hotel, held up an elegant military cap, struck an inquiring attitude, and called softly, \"Gen'al?\"  \"Bring it with the coffee.\"  But the negro instantly brought it without the coffee and placed it on the table with a delicate flourish, shuffled a step back and bowed low:  \"Coffee black, Gen'al, o' co'se?\"  \"Black as your grandmother.\"  The servant tittered: \"Yas, suh, so whah it flop up-siden de cup it leave a lemon-yalleh sta-ain.\"  He capered away, leaving the General to the little steamboats and to a blessed ignorance of times to be when at \"Vicksburg and the Bends\" this same waiter would bring his coffee made of corn-meal bran and muddy water, with which to wash down scant snacks of mule meat. The listless eye still roamed the arid page as the slave returned with the fragrant pot and cup, but now the sitter laid it by, lighted a cigar and mused:--  In this impending war the South would win, of course--oh, God is just! But this muser could only expect to fall at the front. Then his large estate, all lands and slaves, five hundred souls--who would inherit that and hold it together? Held together it must be! Any partition of it would break no end of sacredly humble household and family ties and work spiritual havoc incalculable. There must be but one heir. Who? Hilary's mother had been in heaven these many years, the mother of Adolphe eighteen months; months quite enough to show the lone brother how vast a loss is the absence of the right mistress from such very human interests as those of a great plantation. Not only must there be but one heir, but he _must have the right wife_.  The schemer sipped. So it was Anna for Hilary if he could bring it about. So, too, it must be Hilary for his adjutant-general, to keep him near enough to teach him the management of the fortune coming to him if he, Hilary, would only treat his kind uncle's wishes--reasonably. With the cup half lifted he harkened. From a hidden walk and bower close on the garden side of this vine-mantled fence sounded footsteps and voices:  \"But, Fred! where on earth did she get--let's sit in here--get that rich, belated, gradual smile?\"  A memory thrilled the listening General. \"From her mother,\" thought he, and listened on.  \"It's like,\" continued his nephew--\"I'll tell you what it's like. It's like--Now, let me alone! You see, one has to _learn_ her beauty--by degrees. You know, there _is_ a sort of beauty that flashes on you at first sight, like--like the blaze of a ball-room. I was just now thinking of a striking instance--\"  \"From Mobile? You always are.\"  \"No such thing! Say, Fred, I'll tell you what Miss Anna's smile is like. It's as if you were trying--say in a telescope--for a focus, and at last all at once it comes and--there's your star!\"  The Northerner softly assented.  \"Fred! Fancy Flora Valcour with that smile!\"  \"No! Hilary Kincaid, I think you were born to believe in every feminine creature God ever made. No wonder they nickname you as they do. Now, some girls are quite too feminine for me.\"  In his own smoke the General's eyes opened aggressively. But hark! His nephew spoke again:  \"Fred, if you knew all that girl has done for that boy and that grandmother--It may sound like an overstatement, but you must have observed--\"  \"That she's a sort of overstatement herself?\"  \"Go to grass! _Your_ young lady's not even an understatement; she's only a profound pause. See here! what time is it? I prom--\"  On the uncle's side of the fence a quick step brought a newcomer, a Creole of maybe twenty-nine years, member of his new staff, in bright uniform:  \"Ah, Général, yo' moze ob-edient! Never less al-lone then when al-lone? 'T is the way with myseff--\"  He seemed not unrefined, though of almost too mettlesome an eye; in length of leg showing just the lack, in girth of waist just the excess, to imply a better dignity on horseback and to allow a proud tailor to prove how much art can overcome. Out on the road a liveried black coachman had halted an open carriage, in which this soldier had arrived with two ladies. Now these bowed delightedly from it to the General, while Kincaid and his friend stood close hid and listened agape, equally amused and dismayed.  \"How are you, Mandeville?\" said the General. \"I am not nearly as much alone as I seem, sir!\"  A voice just beyond the green-veiled fence cast a light on this reply and brought a flush to the Creole's very brows. \"Alas! Greenleaf,\" it cried, \"we search in vain! He is not here! We are even more alone than we seem! Ah! where is that peerless chevalier, my beloved, accomplished, blameless, sagacious, just, valiant and amiable uncle? Come let us press on. Let not the fair sex find him first and snatch him from us forever!\"  The General's scorn showed only in his eyes as they met the blaze of Mandeville's. \"You were about to remark--?\" he began, but rose and started toward the carriage.  There not many minutes later you might have seen the four men amicably gathered and vying in clever speeches to pretty Mrs. Callender and her yet fairer though less scintillant step-daughter Anna.     III   THE GENERAL'S CHOICE  Anna Callender. In the midst of the gay skirmish and while she yielded Greenleaf her chief attention, Hilary observed her anew.  What he thought he saw was a golden-brown profusion of hair with a peculiar richness in its platted coils, an unconsciously faultless poise of head, and, equally unconscious, a dreamy softness of sweeping lashes. As she laughed with the General her student noted further what seemed to him a rare silkiness in the tresses, a vapory lightness in the short strands that played over the outlines of temple and forehead, and the unstudied daintiness with which they gathered into the merest mist of a short curl before her exquisite ear.  [Illustration: Anna]  But when now she spoke with him these charms became forgettable as he discovered, or fancied he did, in her self-oblivious eyes, a depth of thought and feeling not in the orbs alone but also in the brows and lids, and between upper and under lashes as he glimpsed them in profile while she turned to Mandeville. And now, unless his own insight misled him, he observed how unlike those eyes, and yet how subtly mated with them, was her mouth; the delicate rising curve of the upper lip, and the floral tenderness with which it so faintly overhung the nether, wherefrom it seemed ever about to part yet parted only when she spoke or smiled.  \"A child's mouth and a woman's eyes,\" he mused.  When her smiles came the mouth remained as young as before, yet suddenly, as truly as the eyes, showed--showed him at least--steadfastness of purpose, while the eyes, where fully half the smile was, still unwittingly revealed their depths of truth.  \"Poor Fred!\" he pondered as the General and Mandeville entered the carriage and it turned away.  A mile or two from Carrollton down the river and toward the city lay the old unfenced fields where Hilary had agreed with Irby to help him manoeuvre his very new command. Along the inland edge of this plain the railway and the common road still ran side by side, but the river veered a mile off. So Mandeville pointed out to the two ladies as they, he, and the General drove up to the spot with Kincaid and Greenleaf as outriders. The chosen ground was a level stretch of wild turf maybe a thousand yards in breadth, sparsely dotted with shoulder-high acacias. No military body was yet here, and the carriage halted at the first good view point.  Mrs. Callender, the only member of her family who was of Northern birth and rearing, was a small slim woman whose smile came whenever she spoke and whose dainty nose went all to merry wrinkles whenever she smiled. It did so now, in the shelter of her diminutive sunshade opened flat against its jointed handle to fend off the strong afternoon beams, while she explained to Greenleaf--dismounted beside the wheels with Mandeville--that Constance, Anna's elder sister, would arrive by and by with Flora Valcour. \"Connie\", she said, had been left behind in the clutches of the dressmaker!  \"Flora,\" she continued, crinkling her nose ever so kind-heartedly at Greenleaf, \"is Lieutenant Mandeville's cousin,"]]]
