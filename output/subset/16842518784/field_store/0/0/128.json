To the SYSTEM OF VEGETABLES is prefixed a copious explanation of all the Terms used in Botany, translated from a thesis of Dr. ELMSGREEN, with the plates and references from the Philosophia Botannica of LINNEUS.  To the FAMILIES OF PLANTS is prefixed a Catalogue of the names of plants, and other Botanic Terms, carefully accented, to shew their proper pronunciation; a work of great labour, and which was much wanted, not only by beginners, but by proficients in BOTANY.          *       *       *       *       *   PROEM.   GENTLE READER!  Lo, here a CAMERA OBSCURA is presented to thy view, in which are lights and shades dancing on a whited canvas, and magnified into apparent life!--if thou art perfectly at leasure for such trivial amusement, walk in, and view the wonders of my INCHANTED GARDEN.  Whereas P. OVIDIUS NASO, a great Necromancer in the famous Court of AUGUSTUS CAESAR, did by art poetic transmute Men, Women, and even Gods and Goddesses, into Trees and Flowers; I have undertaken by similar art to restore some of them to their original animality, after having remained prisoners so long in their respective vegetable mansions; and have here exhibited them before thee. Which thou may'st contemplate as diverse little pictures suspended over the chimney of a Lady's dressing-room, _connected only by a slight festoon of ribbons_. And which, though thou may'st not be acquainted with the originals, may amuse thee by the beauty of their persons, their graceful attitudes, or the brilliancy of their dress.  FAREWELL.  [Illustration]            THE          LOVES          OF THE          PLANTS.            CANTO I.          Descend, ye hovering Sylphs! aerial Quires,         And sweep with little hands your silver lyres;         With fairy footsteps print your grassy rings,         Ye Gnomes! accordant to the tinkling strings; 5      While in soft notes I tune to oaten reed         Gay hopes, and amorous sorrows of the mead.--         From giant Oaks, that wave their branches dark,         To the dwarf Moss, that clings upon their bark,         What Beaux and Beauties crowd the gaudy groves, 10    And woo and win their vegetable Loves.         How Snowdrops cold, and blue-eyed Harebels blend         Their tender tears, as o'er the stream they bend;         The lovesick Violet, and the Primrose pale         Bow their sweet heads, and whisper to the gale; 15    With secret sighs the Virgin Lily droops,         And jealous Cowslips hang their tawny cups.         How the young Rose in beauty's damask pride         Drinks the warm blushes of his bashful bride;         With honey'd lips enamour'd Woodbines meet, 20    Clasp with fond arms, and mix their kisses sweet.--          Stay thy soft-murmuring waters, gentle Rill;         Hush, whispering Winds, ye ruflling Leaves, be still;         Rest, silver Butterflies, your quivering wings;         Alight, ye Beetles, from your airy rings;   [_Vegetable Loves_. l. 10. Linneus, the celebrated Swedish naturalist, has demonstrated, that ail flowers contain families of males or females, or both; and on their marriages has constructed his invaluable system of Botany.]   25    Ye painted Moths, your gold-eyed plumage furl,         Bow your wide horns, your spiral trunks uncurl;         Glitter, ye Glow-worms, on your mossy beds;         Descend, ye Spiders, on your lengthen'd threads;         Slide here, ye horned Snails, with varnish'd shells; 30    Ye Bee-nymphs, listen in your waxen cells!--          BOTANIC MUSE! who in this latter age         Led by your airy hand the Swedish sage,         Bad his keen eye your secret haunts explore         On dewy dell, high wood, and winding shore; 35    Say on each leaf how tiny Graces dwell;         How laugh the Pleasures in a blossom's bell;         How insect Loves arise on cobweb wings,         Aim their light shafts, and point their little stings.          First the tall CANNA lifts his curled brow 40    Erect to heaven, and plights his nuptial vow;   [_Canna_. l. 39. Cane, or Indian Reed. One male and one female inhabit each flower. It is brought from between the tropics to our hot-houses, and bears a beautiful crimson flower; the seeds are used as shot by the Indians, and are strung for prayer-beads in some catholic countries.]           The virtuous pair, in milder regions born,         Dread the rude blast of Autumn's icy morn;         Round the chill fair he folds his crimson vest,         And clasps the timorous beauty to his breast.  45    Thy love, CALLITRICHE, _two_ Virgins share,         Smit with thy starry eye and radiant hair;--         On the green margin sits the youth, and laves         His floating train of tresses in the waves;         Sees his fair features paint the streams that pass, 50    And bends for ever o'er the watery glass.          _Two_ brother swains, of COLLIN'S gentle name,         The same their features, and their forms the same,   [_Callitriche_, l. 45. Fine-Hair, Stargrass. One male and two females inhabit each flower. The upper leaves grow in form of a star, whence it is called Stellaria Aquatica by Ray and others; its stems and leaves float far on the water, and are often so matted together, as to bear a person walking on them. The male sometimes lives in a separate flower.]  [_Collinsonia_. l. 51. Two males one female. I have lately observed a very singular circumstance in this flower; the two males stand widely diverging from each other, and the female bends herself into contact first with one of them, and after some time leaves this, and applies herself to the other. It is probable one of the anthers may be mature before  the other? See note on Gloriosa, and Genista. The females in Nigella, devil in the bush, are very tall compared to the males; and bending over in a circle to them, give the flower some resemblance to a regal crown. The female of the epilobium angustisolium, rose bay willow herb, bends down amongst the males for several days, and becomes upright again when impregnated.]  [_Genista_. l. 57. Dyer's broom. Ten males and one female inhabit this flower. The males are generally united at the bottom in two sets, whence Linneus has named the class \"two brotherhoods.\" In the Genista, however, they are united in but one set. The flowers of this class are called papilionaceous, from their resemblance to a butterfly, as the pea-blossom. In the Spartium Scoparium, or common broom, I have lately observed a curious circumstance, the males or stamens are in two sets, one set rising a quarter of an inch above the other; the upper set does not arrive at their maturity so soon as the lower, and the stigma, or head of the female, is produced amongst the upper or immature set; but as soon as the pistil grows tall enough to burst open the keel-leaf, or hood of the flower, it bends itself round in an instant, like a French horn, and inserts its head, or stigma, amongst the lower or mature set of males. The pistil, or female, continues to grow in length; and in a few days the stigma arrives again amongst the upper set, by the time they become mature. This wonderful contrivance is readily seen by opening the keel-leaf of the flowers of broom before they burst spontaneously. See note on Collinsonia, Gloriosa, Draba.]           With rival love for fair COLLINIA sigh,         Knit the dark brow, and roll the unsteady eye. 55    With sweet concern the pitying beauty mourns,         And sooths with smiles the jealous pair by turns.          Sweet blooms GENISTA in the myrtle shade,         And _ten_ fond brothers woo the haughty maid.         _Two_ knights before thy fragrant altar bend, 60    Adored MELISSA! and _two_ squires attend.         MEADIA'S soft chains _five_ suppliant beaux confess,         And hand in hand the laughing belle address;         Alike to all, she bows with wanton air,         Rolls her dark eye, and waves her golden hair.   [_Melissa_. l. 60. Balm. In each flower there are four males and one female; two of the males stand higher than the other two; whence the name of the class \"two powers.\" I have observed in the Ballota, and others of this class, that the two lower stamens, or males become mature before the two higher. After they have shed their dust, they turn themselves away outwards; and the pistil, or female, continuing to grow a little taller, is applied to the upper stamens. See Gloriosa, and Genista.  All the plants of this class, which have naked seeds, are aromatic. The Marum, and Nepeta are particularly delightful to cats; no other brute animals seem pleased with any odours but those of their food or prey.]  [_Meadia_. l. 61. Dodecatheon, American Cowslip. Five males and one female. The males, or anthers, touch each other. The uncommon beauty of this flower occasioned Linneus to give it a name signifying the twelve heathen gods; and Dr. Mead to affix his own name to it. The pistil is much longer than the stamens, hence the flower-stalks have their elegant bend, that the stigma may hang downwards to receive the fecundating dust of the anthers. And the petals are so beautifully turned back to prevent the rain or dew drops from sliding down and washing off this dust prematurely; and at the same time exposing it to the light and air. As soon as the seeds are formed, it erects all the flower-stalks to prevent them from falling out; and thus loses the beauty of its figure. Is this a mechanical effect, or does it indicate a vegetable storg√© to preserve its offspring? See note on Ilex, and Gloriosa.  In the Meadia, the Borago, Cyclamen, Solanum, and many others, the filaments are very short compared with the slyle. Hence it became necessary, 1st. to furnish the stamens with long anthers. 2d. To lengthen and bend the peduncle or flower-slalk, that the  flower might hang downwards. 3d. To reflect the petals. 4th. To erect these peduncles when the germ was fecundated. We may reason upon this"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10671"],["title","The Botanic Garden. Part II. (#2)"],["body","observing, that all this apparatus might have been spared, if the filaments alone had grown longer; and that thence in these flowers that the filaments are the most unchangeable parts; and that thence their comparative length, in respect to the style, would afford a most permanent mark of their generic character.]  [Illustration: Meadia]   65    Woo'd with long care, CURCUMA cold and shy         Meets her fond husband with averted eye:         _Four_ beardless youths the obdurate beauty move         With soft attentions of Platonic love.          With vain desires the pensive ALCEA burns, 70    And, like sad ELOISA, loves and mourns.         The freckled IRIS owns a fiercer flame,         And _three_ unjealous husbands wed the dame.         CUPRESSUS dark disdains his dusky bride,         _One_ dome contains them, but _two_ beds divide. 75    The proud OSYRIS flies his angry fair,         _Two_ houses hold the fashionable pair.   [_Curcuma_. l. 65. Turmeric. One male and one female inhabit this flower; but there are besides four imperfect males, or filaments without anthers upon them, called by Linneus eunuchs. The flax of our country has ten filaments, and but five of them are terminated with anthers; the Portugal flax has ten perfect males, or stamens; the Verbena of our country has four males; that of Sweden has but two; the genus Albuca, the Bignonia Catalpa, Gratiola, and hemlock-leaved Geranium have only half their filaments crowned with anthers. In like manner the florets, which form the rays of the flowers of the order frustraneous polygamy of the class syngenesia, or confederate males, as the sun-flower, are furnished with a style only, and no stigma: and are thence barren. There is also a style without a stigma in the whole order dioecia gynandria; the male flowers of which are thence barren. The Opulus is another plant, which contains some unprolific flowers. In like manner some tribes of insects have males, females, and neuters among them: as bees, wasps, ants.  There is a curious circumstance belonging to the class of insects which have two wings, or diptera, analogous to the rudiments of stamens above described; viz. two little knobs are found placed each on a stalk or peduncle, generally under a little arched scale; which appear to be rudiments of hinder wings; and are called by Linneus, halteres, or poisers, a term of his introduction. A.T. Bladh. Amaen. Acad. V. 7. Other animals have marks of having in a long process of time undergone changes in some parts of their bodies, which may have been effected to accommodate them to new ways of procuring their food. The existence of teats on the breasts of male animals, and which are generally replete with a thin kind of milk at their nativity, is a wonderful instance of this kind. Perhaps all the productions of nature are in their progress to greater perfection? an idea countenanced by the modern discoveries and deductions concerning the progressive formation of the solid parts of the terraqueous globe, and consonant to the dignity of the Creator of all things.]  [_Alcea_, l. 69. Flore pleno. Double hollyhock. The double flowers, so much admired by the florists, are termed by the botanist vegetable monsters; in some of these the petals are multiplied three or four times, but without excluding the stamens, hence they produce some seeds, as Campanula and Stramoneum; but in others the petals become so numerous as totally to exclude the stamens, or males; as Caltha, Peonia, and Alcea; these produce no seeds, and are termed eunuchs. Philos. Botan. No. 150.  These vegetable monsters are formed in many ways. 1st. By the multiplication of the petals and the exclusion of the nectaries, as in larkspur. 2d. By the multiplication of the nectaries and exclusion of the petals; as in columbine. 3d. In some flowers growing in cymes, the wheel-shape flowers in the margin are multiplied to the exclusion of the bell-shape flowers in the centre; as in gelder-rose. 4th. By the elongation of the florets in the centre. Instances of both these are found in daisy and feverfew; for other kinds of vegetable monsters, see Plantago.  The perianth is not changed in double flowers, hence the genus or family may be often discovered by the calyx, as in Hepatica, Ranunculus, Alcea. In those flowers, which have many petals, the lowest series of the petals remains unchanged in respect to number; hence the natural number of the petals is easily discovered. As in poppies, roses, and Nigella, or devil in a bulb. Phil. Bot. p. 128.]  [_Iris_. l. 71. Flower de Luce. Three males, one female. Some of the species have a beautifully freckled flower; the large stigma or head of the female covers the three males, counterfeiting a petal with its divisions.]  [_Cupressus_. l. 73. Cypress. One House. The males live in separate flowers, but on the same plant. The males of some of these plants, which are in separate flowers from the females, have an elastic membrane; which disperses their dust to a considerable distance, when the anthers burst open. This dust, on a fine day, may often be seen like a cloud hanging round the common nettle. The males and females of all the cone-bearing plants are in separate flowers, either on the same or on different plants; they produce resins, and many of them are supposed to supply the most durable timber: what is called Venice-turpentine is obtained from the larch by wounding the bark about two feet from the ground, and catching it as it exsudes; Sandarach is procured from common juniper; and Incense from a juniper with yellow fruit. The unperishable chests, which contain the Egyptian mummies, were of Cypress; and the Cedar, with which black-lead pencils are covered, is not liable to be eaten by worms. See Miln's Bot. Dict. art. conifer√¶. The gates of St. Peter's church at Rome, which had lasted from the time of Constantine to that of Pope Eugene the fourth, that is to say eleven hundred years, were of Cypress, and had in that time suffered no decay. According to Thucydides, the Athenians buried the bodies of their heroes in coffins of Cypress, as being not subject to decay. A similar durability has also been ascribed to Cedar. Thus Horace,                           _----speramus carmina fingi         Posse linenda cedre, & lavi servanda cupresso._  [_Osyris_. l. 75. Two houses. The males and females are on different plants. There are many instances on record, where female plants have been impregnated at very great distance from their male; the dust discharged from the anthers is very light, small, and copious, so that it may spread very wide in the atmosphere, and be carried to the distant pistils, without the supposition of any particular attraction; these plants resemble some insects, as the ants, and cochineal insect, of which the males have wings, but not the female.]           With strange deformity PLANTAGO treads,         A Monster-birth! and lifts his hundred heads;         Yet with soft love a gentle belle he charms, 80    And clasps the beauty in his hundred arms.         So hapless DESDEMONA, fair and young,         Won by OTHELLO'S captivating tongue,         Sigh'd o'er each strange and piteous tale, distress'd,         And sunk enamour'd on his sooty breast.  85    _Two_ gentle shepherds and their sister-wives         With thee, ANTHOXA! lead ambrosial lives;   [_Plantago_. l. 77. Rosea. Rose Plantain. In this vegetable monster the bractes, or divisions of the spike, become wonderfully enlarged; and are converted into leaves. The chaffy scales of the calyx in Xeranthemum, and in a species of Dianthus, and the glume in some alpine grasses, and the scales of the ament in the salix rosea, rose willow, grow into leaves; and produce other kinds of monsters. The double flowers become monsters by the multiplication of their petals or nectaries. See note on Alcea.  [_Anthoxanthum_. l. 83. Vernal grass. Two males, two females. The other grasses have three males and two females. The flowers of this grass give the fragrant scent to hay. I am informed it is frequently viviparous, that is, that it bears sometimes roots or bulbs instead of seeds, which after a time drop off and strike root into the ground. This circumstance is said to obtain in many of the alpine grasses, whose seeds are perpetually devoured by small birds. The Festuca Dometorum, fescue grass of the bushes, produces bulbs from the sheaths of its straw. The Allium Magicum, or magical onion, produces onions on its head, instead of seeds. The Polygonum Viviparum, viviparous bistort, rises about a foot high, with a beautiful spike of flowers, which are succeeded by buds or bulbs, which fall off and take root. There is a bulb, frequently seen on birch-trees, like a bird's nest, which seems to be a similar attempt of nature, to produce another tree; which falling off might take root in spongy ground.  There is an instance of this double mode of production in the animal kingdom, which is equally extraordinary: the same species of Aphis is viviparous in summer, and oviparous in autumn. A. T. Bladh. Amoen. Acad. V. 7.]           Where the wide heath in purple pride extends,         And scatter'd furze its golden lustre blends,         Closed in a green recess, unenvy'd lot! 90    The blue smoak rises from their turf-built cot;         Bosom'd in fragrance blush their infant train,         Eye the warm sun, or drink the silver rain.
