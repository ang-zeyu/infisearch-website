I suppose you’re a great big boy by now; your   mother was always tall for her age. There are boys here who would   like to be scout boys and your uncle says you can teach them. We   will do all we can so that you have a pleasant summer if you come   and tell your mother we will be real glad to see you and will take   good care of you.    I can’t write more now because I am putting up preserves, one   hundred jars already. The apples will be rotting on the trees,   it’s a shame. You will think we are very old-fashioned, I’m   afraid.  Pee-wee paused and smacked his lips and nearly fell backward off the limb. One hundred jars of preserves and more coming! Apples rotting on the trees! All that remained to complete his happiness was a bush laden with ice cream cones growing wild. He read the concluding sentences:    Your uncle would be glad to go and bring you in the buckboard but   it would take very long and he is busy haying so if you don’t mind   the bad road it would be better for your father to send you in the   automobile. Be sure to turn off the highway to the right just   above Baxters. The road goes through the woods.                                          Your loving                                               Aunt Jamsiah.  Steadying himself with one hand, Pee-wee took the letter between his teeth as if he were about to eat it. Then he cautiously let himself down so that he hung by his knees, then clutched the limb with his hands, hung for a moment with his legs dangling, and let go. In one sense he was upon earth but in another sense he was walking on air....                                    CHAPTER IV                             HE GOES TO CONQUER   Thus it befell that on the second day after the receipt of this letter Pee-wee Harris was sitting beside Charlie, the chauffeur, in the fine sedan car belonging to Doctor Harris, advancing against poor, helpless Everdoze.  He traveled in all the martial splendor of his full scout regalia, his duffel bag stuffed to capacity with his aluminum cooking set and two extra scout suits. His diminutive but compact and sturdy little form was decorated with his scout jack-knife hanging from his belt, his compass dangling from his neck, and his belt ax dragging down his belt in back.  A suggestive little dash of the culinary phase of scouting was to be seen in a small saucepan stuck in his belt like a deadly dagger. Thus if danger came he might confront his enemy with a sample of scout cookery and kill him on the spot.  His sleeves were bedecked with merit badges; from the end of his scout staff waved the flaunting emblem of the Raven Patrol; his stalking camera was swung over his shoulder like a knapsack; his nickel-plated scout whistle jangled against the saucepan; and in his trousers pockets were a magnifying glass, three jawbreakers, a chocolate bar, a few inches of electric wiring, and a rubber balloon in a state of collapse.  The highway from Bridgeboro was a broad, smooth road, a temptation and a delight to speeders, where motorcycle cops lurked in the bushes hardly waiting for cars with New York licenses.  It was late in the afternoon when they reached Baxter City and here they turned into such a road as Charlie vowed he had never seen before. Scarcely had they gone a mile over rocks and ruts when the dim woods closed in on either side, imparting a strange coolness. It was almost like going through a leafy tunnel. Projecting branches brushed the top of the car and mischievously grazed and tickled their faces. The voices of the birds, clear in the stillness, seemed to complain at this intrusion into their domain.  “I’d like to know how I’m going to get back through this jungle after dark,” Charlie said. “I wonder what anybody wanted to start a village down here for?”  “Maybe—maybe they did it kind of absent-mindedly,” Pee-wee said. “I never started a village so I don’t know.”  “Well, you’ll _startle_ one anyway,” Charlie said. “I guess the village isn’t much bigger than you are.”  The road took them southward through the valley. They were not far west of the highway but the low country and the thick woods obscured it from view. They could hear the tooting of auto horns over that way and sometimes human voices sounding strange across the intervening solitude.  “I don’t see why they didn’t set the village down over at the highway; it’s not more than a mile or so,” Charlie said. “Maybe they were afraid the autos would run over it; safety first, hey? Nobody’ll run over it here, that’s one sure thing.”  Pee-wee took the last bite of a hot frankfurter he had bought at a roadside shack on the highway and was now more free to talk.  “Listen,” he said, “what’s that?”  It was a distant rattling sound which began suddenly and ended suddenly. They both listened.  “There must be a bridge up there along the highway,” Charlie said; “that’s the sound of cars going over it. Loose planking, hey?”  Pee-wee listened to the rattling of the loose planks as another car sped over the unseen structure, little dreaming of the part that bridge was destined to play in his young life. The commonplace noise of the neglected flooring seemed emphasized by the quiet of the woodland. That reminder of human traffic, so near and yet so far and out of tune with all the gentler sounds of the valley, presented a strange contrast and jarred even Pee-wee’s stout nerves.  “There goes another,” Charlie said; “we must be nearer to the highway than I thought.”  They had, indeed, inscribed a kind of loop and having passed its farthest point from the main road were traveling toward it again and would have emerged upon it just beyond the bridge but for the wood embowered and sequestered village which was their destination. The first sign of this village was a cow standing in the middle of the grass-grown road as if to challenge their approach. Perhaps she was stationed there as a sort of traffic cop....                                    CHAPTER V                                ENTER PEPSY   It will be seen by a glance at the accompanying sketch that the village of Everdoze was about opposite the bridge on the highway. From this main road the village could be reached by a trail through the woods. On hearing of this, Charlie expressed regret that he had not allowed his passenger to make the final stage of the journey on foot.  “Well, I _never_ in all my _life_!” said Aunt Jamsiah as Pee-wee stepped out of the car. “In goodness’ name, where’s the rest of you? I thought you were a great, tall, strapping boy. I hope your appetite’s bigger than your body. And what on earth is that saucepan for? Are you going to cook us all alive? Did you ever _see_ such a thing!” she added, speaking to Uncle Ebenezer who had stepped forward to welcome his nephew.  “He’s all decked out like a carnival! He’s just too killing!” She then proceeded to embrace him while his martial paraphernalia clanked and rattled.  “We won’t need any more brass band,” said a young girl in a gingham apron and with brick red hair in long tightly woven braids, who stood close by; “he’s a _melodeon_. I don’t see what they sent such a big car for with such a little boy. ’Taint no fit, it ain’t.”  Pee-wee gave this girl a withering look which she boldly returned, continuing to stare at him. Her face was covered with freckles and she was so unqualifiedly plain and homely in face and attire that she might be said to have been attractive on the ground of novelty.  “Pepsy,” said Mrs. Quig, addressing her, “you shake hands with Walter and tell him you and he are going to be good friends. You come right here and do as I say now and no more of those looks.”  “I ain’t going to kiss him,” the girl said by way of compromising.  “You give him a welcome just like Wiggle is doing,” said Aunt Jamsiah, “and be ashamed that you have to learn your manners from such as he. You do as I say now.”  “You’re welcome—and I can beat you running,” the girl said.  “Girls are afraid of snakes,” Pee-wee retorted. Meanwhile the individual who had been cited as a model of social correctness by Aunt Jamsiah stood upon the doorstep looking eagerly up into Pee-wee’s face and wagging his tail with vigorous and lightning rapidity. Wiggle’s tail was easily the fastest thing in Everdoze. His head vibrated in unison with it and his look of intentness carried with it all sorts of friendly expectations. He fairly shook with excitement and cordiality. He followed the sedan car a few yards upon its homeward journey and then, by a sudden impulse, deserted it and returned to a position directly in front of Pee-wee with wagging tail and questioning gaze. Pie seemed to say, “I’m ready for anything, the sky is the limit.”  “You haven’t had a bite to eat since breakfast and you’re _starving_. I can _tell_ it,” said Aunt Jamsiah. “You come right in the kitchen.”  “I had a lot of frankfurters and things at the places along the highway,” Pee-wee said. “I had waffles at one place. I bet they make a lot of money along that road selling things. There are shacks all the way. All the autoists stop and buy things to eat. You can get tires and everything.”  “Oh, I wouldn’t want to eat tires,” said Pepsy.  “You think you’re smart, don’t you?” Pee-wee said.  “What are your soldier clothes for?” the girl wanted to know.  “They’re not soldier clothes,” Pee-wee said; “I’m a scout.”  “I bet you don’t know as much as Miss Bellison does.”  “I bet I don’t either,” Pee-wee said, “so I win.”  “She’s the school teacher here and she knows everything.”  “Did she know I was coming?”  “No, she didn’t and—”  “Then she doesn’t know everything,” Pee-wee said.  “Smarty, smarty!” the girl retorted, “I came out of an orphan home and that’s more than you can say.”  “You only get one helping of dessert there,” said Pee-wee. “I’d rather be a scout than an orphan. I know a feller who was an orphan and he was sorry for it afterwards.”  “Are you going to stay all summer?”"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9834"],["title","The Talleyrand Maxim (#1)"],["body","this flashed through Linford Pratt's mind in a few seconds--he knew all the story: he had often thought of the extraordinary good fortune of those young people. To be living on charity one week--and the next to be legal possessors of thousands a year!--oh, if only such luck would come his way!  \"Of course!\" he repeated, looking thoughtfully at the old bookseller. \"Not the sort of thing one does forget in a hurry, Mr. Bartle. What of it?\"  Antony Bartle leaned back in his easy chair and chuckled--something, some idea, seemed to be affording him amusement.  \"I'm eighty years old,\" he remarked. \"No, I'm more, to be exact. I shall be eighty-two come February. When you've lived as long as that, young Mr. Pratt, you'll know that this life is a game of topsy-turvy--to some folks, at any rate. Just so!\"  \"You didn't come here to tell me that, Mr. Bartle,\" said Pratt. He was an essentially practical young man who dined at half-past six every evening, having lunched on no more than bread-and-cheese and a glass of ale, and he also had his evenings well mapped out. \"I know that already, sir.\"  \"Aye, aye, but you'll know more of it later on,\" replied Bartle. \"Well--you know, too, no doubt, that the late John Mallathorpe was a bit--only a bit--of a book-collector; collected books and pamphlets relating to this district?\"  \"I've heard of it,\" answered the clerk.  \"He had that collection in his private room at the mill,\" continued the old bookseller, \"and when the new folks took hold, I persuaded them to sell it to me. There wasn't such a lot--maybe a hundred volumes altogether--but I wanted what there was. And as they were of no interest to them, they sold 'em. That's some months ago. I put all the books in a corner--and I never really examined them until this very afternoon. Then--by this afternoon's post--I got a letter from a Barford man who's now out in America. He wanted to know if I could supply him with a nice copy of Hopkinson's _History of Barford_. I knew there was one in that Mallathorpe collection, so I got it out, and examined it. And in the pocket inside, in which there's a map, I found--what d'ye think?\"  \"Couldn't say,\" replied Pratt. He was still thinking of his dinner, and of an important engagement to follow it, and he had not the least idea that old Antony Bartle was going to tell him anything very important. \"Letters? Bank-notes? Something of that sort?\"  The old bookseller leaned nearer, across the corner of the desk, until his queer, wrinkled face was almost close to Pratt's sharp, youthful one. Again he lifted the claw-like finger: again he tapped the clerk's arm.  \"I found John Mallathorpe's will!\" he whispered. \"His--will!\"  Linford Pratt jumped out of his chair. For a second he stared in speechless amazement at the old man; then he plunged his hands deep into his trousers' pockets, opened his mouth, and let out a sudden exclamation.  \"No!\" he said. \"No! John Mallathorpe's--will? His--will!\"  \"Made the very day on which he died,\" answered Bartle, nodding emphatically.  \"Queer, wasn't it? He might have had some--premonition, eh?\"  Pratt sat down again.  \"Where is it?\" he asked.  \"Here in my pocket,\" replied the old bookseller, tapping his rusty coat. \"Oh, it's all right, I assure you. All duly made out, signed, and witnessed. Everything in order, I know!--because a long, a very long time ago, I was like you, an attorney's clerk. I've drafted many a will, and witnessed many a will, in my time. I've read this, every word of it--it's all right. Nothing can upset it.\"  \"Let's see it,\" said Pratt, eagerly.  \"Well--I've no objection--I know you, of course,\" answered Bartle, \"but I'd rather show it first to Mr. Eldrick. Couldn't you telephone up to his house and ask him to run back here?\"  \"Certainly,\" replied Pratt. \"He mayn't be there, though. But I can try. You haven't shown it to anybody else?\"  \"Neither shown it to anybody, nor mentioned it to a soul,\" said Bartle. \"I tell you it's not much more than half an hour since I found it. It's not a long document. Do you know how it is that it's never come out?\" he went on, turning eagerly to Pratt, who had risen again. \"It's easily explained. The will's witnessed by those two men who were killed at the same time as John Mallathorpe! So, of course, there was nobody to say that it was in evidence. My notion is that he and those two men--Gaukrodger and Marshall, his manager and cashier--had signed it not long before the accident, and that Mallathorpe had popped it into the pocket of that book before going out into the yard. Eh? But see if you can get Mr. Eldrick down here, and we'll read it together. And I say--this office seems uncommonly stuffy--can you open the window a bit or something?--I feel oppressed, like.\"  Pratt opened a window which looked out on the street. He glanced at the old man for a moment and saw that his face, always pallid, was even paler than usual.  \"You've been talking too much,\" he said. \"Rest yourself, Mr. Bartle, while I ring up Mr. Eldrick's house. If he isn't there, I'll try his club--he often turns in there for an hour before going home.\"  He went out by a private door to the telephone box, which stood in a lobby used by various occupants of the building. And when he had rung up Eldrick's private house and was waiting for the answer, he asked himself what this discovery would mean to the present holders of the Mallathorpe property, and his curiosity--a strongly developed quality in him--became more and more excited. If Eldrick was not at home, if he could not get in touch with him, he would persuade old Bartle to let him see his find--he would cheerfully go late to his dinner if he could only get a peep at this strangely discovered document. Romance! Why, this indeed was romance; and it might be--what else? Old Bartle had already chuckled about topsy-turvydom: did that mean that--  The telephone bell rang: Eldrick had not yet reached his house. Pratt got on to the club: Eldrick had not been there. He rang off, and went back to the private room.  \"Can't get hold of him, Mr. Bartle,\" he began, as he closed the door. \"He's not at home, and he's not at the club. I say!--you might as well let me have a look at----\"  Pratt suddenly stopped. There was a strange silence in the room: the old man's wheezy breathing was no longer heard. And the clerk moved forward quickly and looked round the high back of the easy chair....  He knew at once what had happened--knew that old Bartle was dead before he laid a finger on the wasted hand which had dropped helplessly at his side. He had evidently died without a sound or a movement--died as quietly as he would have gone to sleep. Indeed, he looked as if he had just laid his old head against the padding of the chair and dropped asleep, and Pratt, who had seen death before, knew that he would never wake again. He waited a moment, listening in the silence. Once he touched the old man's hand; once, he bent nearer, still listening. And then, without hesitation, and with fingers that remained as steady as if nothing had happened, he unbuttoned Antony Bartle's coat, and drew a folded paper from the inner pocket.     CHAPTER II   IN TRUST   As quietly and composedly as if he were discharging the most ordinary of his daily duties, Pratt unfolded the document, and went close to the solitary gas jet above Eldrick's desk. What he held in his hand was a half-sheet of ruled foolscap paper, closely covered with writing, which he at once recognized as that of the late John Mallathorpe. He was familiar with that writing--he had often seen it. It was an old-fashioned writing--clear, distinct, with every letter well and fully formed.  \"Made it himself!\" muttered Pratt. \"Um!--looks as if he wanted to keep the terms secret. Well----\"  He read the will through--rapidly, but with care, murmuring the phraseology half aloud.  \"This is the last will of me, John Mallathorpe, of Normandale Grange, in the parish of Normandale, in the West Riding of the County of York. I appoint Martin William Charlesworth, manufacturer, of Holly Lodge, Barford, and Arthur James Wyatt, chartered accountant, of 65, Beck Street, Barford, executors and trustees of this my will. I give and devise all my estate and effects real and personal of which I may die possessed or entitled to unto the said Martin William Charlesworth and Arthur James Wyatt upon trust for the following purposes to be carried out by them under the following instructions, namely:--As soon after my death as is conveniently possible they will sell all my real estate, either by private treaty or by public auction; they shall sell all my personal property of any nature whatsoever; they shall sell my business at Mallathorpe's mill in Barford as a going concern to any private purchaser or to any company already in existence or formed for the purpose of acquiring it; and they shall collect all debts and moneys due to me. And having sold and disposed of all my property, real and personal, and brought all the proceeds of such sales and of such collection of debts and moneys into one common fund they shall first pay all debts owing by me and all legal duties and expenses arising out of my death and this disposition of my property and shall then distribute my estate as follows, namely: to each of themselves, Martin William Charlesworth and Arthur James Wyatt, they shall pay the sum of five thousand pounds; to my sister-in-law, Ann Mallathorpe, they shall pay the sum of ten thousand pounds; to my nephew, Harper John Mallathorpe, they shall pay the sum of ten thousand pounds; to my niece, Nesta Mallathorpe, they shall pay the sum of ten thousand pounds. And as to the whole of the remaining residue they shall pay it in one sum to the Mayor and Corporation of the borough of Barford in the County of York to be applied by the said Mayor and Corporation at their own absolute discretion and in any manner which seems good to them to the establishment, furtherance and development of technical and"]]]
