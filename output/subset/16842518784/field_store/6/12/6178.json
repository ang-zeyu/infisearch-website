I am not gratifying idle gossip then.  I was told, Mr. Sampson, that Mr. Meltham had relinquished all his avocations and all his prospects, because he was, in fact, broken-hearted.  A disappointed attachment I heard,—though it hardly seems probable, in the case of a man so distinguished and so attractive.’  ‘Attractions and distinctions are no armour against death,’ said I.  ‘O, she died?  Pray pardon me.  I did not hear that.  That, indeed, makes it very, very sad.  Poor Mr. Meltham!  She died?  Ah, dear me! Lamentable, lamentable!’  I still thought his pity was not quite genuine, and I still suspected an unaccountable sneer under all this, until he said, as we were parted, like the other knots of talkers, by the announcement of dinner:  ‘Mr. Sampson, you are surprised to see me so moved on behalf of a man whom I have never known.  I am not so disinterested as you may suppose. I have suffered, and recently too, from death myself.  I have lost one of two charming nieces, who were my constant companions.  She died young—barely three-and-twenty; and even her remaining sister is far from strong.  The world is a grave!’  He said this with deep feeling, and I felt reproached for the coldness of my manner.  Coldness and distrust had been engendered in me, I knew, by my bad experiences; they were not natural to me; and I often thought how much I had lost in life, losing trustfulness, and how little I had gained, gaining hard caution.  This state of mind being habitual to me, I troubled myself more about this conversation than I might have troubled myself about a greater matter.  I listened to his talk at dinner, and observed how readily other men responded to it, and with what a graceful instinct he adapted his subjects to the knowledge and habits of those he talked with.  As, in talking with me, he had easily started the subject I might be supposed to understand best, and to be the most interested in, so, in talking with others, he guided himself by the same rule.  The company was of a varied character; but he was not at fault, that I could discover, with any member of it.  He knew just as much of each man’s pursuit as made him agreeable to that man in reference to it, and just as little as made it natural in him to seek modestly for information when the theme was broached.  As he talked and talked—but really not too much, for the rest of us seemed to force it upon him—I became quite angry with myself.  I took his face to pieces in my mind, like a watch, and examined it in detail.  I could not say much against any of his features separately; I could say even less against them when they were put together.  ‘Then is it not monstrous,’ I asked myself, ‘that because a man happens to part his hair straight up the middle of his head, I should permit myself to suspect, and even to detest him?’  (I may stop to remark that this was no proof of my sense.  An observer of men who finds himself steadily repelled by some apparently trifling thing in a stranger is right to give it great weight.  It may be the clue to the whole mystery.  A hair or two will show where a lion is hidden.  A very little key will open a very heavy door.)  I took my part in the conversation with him after a time, and we got on remarkably well.  In the drawing-room I asked the host how long he had known Mr. Slinkton.  He answered, not many months; he had met him at the house of a celebrated painter then present, who had known him well when he was travelling with his nieces in Italy for their health.  His plans in life being broken by the death of one of them, he was reading with the intention of going back to college as a matter of form, taking his degree, and going into orders.  I could not but argue with myself that here was the true explanation of his interest in poor Meltham, and that I had been almost brutal in my distrust on that simple head.     III.   ON the very next day but one I was sitting behind my glass partition, as before, when he came into the outer office, as before.  The moment I saw him again without hearing him, I hated him worse than ever.  It was only for a moment that I had this opportunity; for he waved his tight-fitting black glove the instant I looked at him, and came straight in.  ‘Mr. Sampson, good-day!  I presume, you see, upon your kind permission to intrude upon you.  I don’t keep my word in being justified by business, for my business here—if I may so abuse the word—is of the slightest nature.’  I asked, was it anything I could assist him in?  ‘I thank you, no.  I merely called to inquire outside whether my dilatory friend had been so false to himself as to be practical and sensible. But, of course, he has done nothing.  I gave him your papers with my own hand, and he was hot upon the intention, but of course he has done nothing.  Apart from the general human disinclination to do anything that ought to be done, I dare say there is a specialty about assuring one’s life.  You find it like will-making.  People are so superstitious, and take it for granted they will die soon afterwards.’  ‘Up here, if you please; straight up here, Mr. Sampson.  Neither to the right nor to the left.’  I almost fancied I could hear him breathe the words as he sat smiling at me, with that intolerable parting exactly opposite the bridge of my nose.  ‘There is such a feeling sometimes, no doubt,’ I replied; ‘but I don’t think it obtains to any great extent.’  ‘Well,’ said he, with a shrug and a smile, ‘I wish some good angel would influence my friend in the right direction.  I rashly promised his mother and sister in Norfolk to see it done, and he promised them that he would do it.  But I suppose he never will.’  He spoke for a minute or two on indifferent topics, and went away.  I had scarcely unlocked the drawers of my writing-table next morning, when he reappeared.  I noticed that he came straight to the door in the glass partition, and did not pause a single moment outside.  ‘Can you spare me two minutes, my dear Mr. Sampson?’  ‘By all means.’  ‘Much obliged,’ laying his hat and umbrella on the table; ‘I came early, not to interrupt you.  The fact is, I am taken by surprise in reference to this proposal my friend has made.’  ‘Has he made one?’ said I.  ‘Ye-es,’ he answered, deliberately looking at me; and then a bright idea seemed to strike him—‘or he only tells me he has.  Perhaps that may be a new way of evading the matter.  By Jupiter, I never thought of that!’  Mr. Adams was opening the morning’s letters in the outer office.  ‘What is the name, Mr. Slinkton?’ I asked.  ‘Beckwith.’  I looked out at the door and requested Mr. Adams, if there were a proposal in that name, to bring it in.  He had already laid it out of his hand on the counter.  It was easily selected from the rest, and he gave it me.  Alfred Beckwith.  Proposal to effect a policy with us for two thousand pounds.  Dated yesterday.  ‘From the Middle Temple, I see, Mr. Slinkton.’  ‘Yes.  He lives on the same staircase with me; his door is opposite.  I never thought he would make me his reference though.’  ‘It seems natural enough that he should.’  ‘Quite so, Mr. Sampson; but I never thought of it.  Let me see.’  He took the printed paper from his pocket.  ‘How am I to answer all these questions?’  ‘According to the truth, of course,’ said I.  ‘O, of course!’ he answered, looking up from the paper with a smile; ‘I meant they were so many.  But you do right to be particular.  It stands to reason that you must be particular.  Will you allow me to use your pen and ink?’  ‘Certainly.’  ‘And your desk?’  ‘Certainly.’  He had been hovering about between his hat and his umbrella for a place to write on.  He now sat down in my chair, at my blotting-paper and inkstand, with the long walk up his head in accurate perspective before me, as I stood with my back to the fire.  Before answering each question he ran over it aloud, and discussed it. How long had he known Mr. Alfred Beckwith?  That he had to calculate by years upon his fingers.  What were his habits?  No difficulty about them; temperate in the last degree, and took a little too much exercise, if anything.  All the answers were satisfactory.  When he had written them all, he looked them over, and finally signed them in a very pretty hand. He supposed he had now done with the business.  I told him he was not likely to be troubled any farther.  Should he leave the papers there? If he pleased.  Much obliged.  Good-morning.  I had had one other visitor before him; not at the office, but at my own house.  That visitor had come to my bedside when it was not yet daylight, and had been seen by no one else but by my faithful confidential servant.  A second reference paper (for we required always two) was sent down into Norfolk, and was duly received back by post.  This, likewise, was satisfactorily answered in every respect.  Our forms were all complied with; we accepted the proposal, and the premium for one year was paid.     IV.   FOR six or seven months I saw no more of Mr. Slinkton.  He called once at my house, but I was not at home; and he once asked me to dine with him in the Temple, but I was engaged.  His friend’s assurance was effected in March.  Late in September or early in October I was down at Scarborough for a breath of sea-air, where I met him on the beach.  It was a hot evening; he came toward me with his hat in his hand; and there was the walk I had felt so strongly disinclined to take in perfect order again, exactly in front of the bridge of my nose.  He was not alone, but had a young lady on his arm.  She was dressed in mourning, and I looked at her with great interest. She had the appearance of being extremely delicate, and her face was remarkably pale and melancholy; but she was very pretty.  He introduced her as his niece, Miss Niner.  ‘Are you strolling, Mr. Sampson?  Is it possible you can be idle?’  It _was_ possible, and"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/807"],["title","Hunted Down: The Detective Stories of Charles Dickens (#2)"],["body"," _was_ strolling.  ‘Shall we stroll together?’  ‘With pleasure.’  The young lady walked between us, and we walked on the cool sea sand, in the direction of Filey.  ‘There have been wheels here,’ said Mr. Slinkton.  ‘And now I look again, the wheels of a hand-carriage!  Margaret, my love, your shadow without doubt!’  ‘Miss Niner’s shadow?’ I repeated, looking down at it on the sand.  ‘Not that one,’ Mr. Slinkton returned, laughing.  ‘Margaret, my dear, tell Mr. Sampson.’  ‘Indeed,’ said the young lady, turning to me, ‘there is nothing to tell—except that I constantly see the same invalid old gentleman at all times, wherever I go.  I have mentioned it to my uncle, and he calls the gentleman my shadow.’  ‘Does he live in Scarborough?’ I asked.  ‘He is staying here.’  ‘Do you live in Scarborough?’  ‘No, I am staying here.  My uncle has placed me with a family here, for my health.’  ‘And your shadow?’ said I, smiling.  ‘My shadow,’ she answered, smiling too, ‘is—like myself—not very robust, I fear; for I lose my shadow sometimes, as my shadow loses me at other times.  We both seem liable to confinement to the house.  I have not seen my shadow for days and days; but it does oddly happen, occasionally, that wherever I go, for many days together, this gentleman goes.  We have come together in the most unfrequented nooks on this shore.’  ‘Is this he?’ said I, pointing before us.  The wheels had swept down to the water’s edge, and described a great loop on the sand in turning.  Bringing the loop back towards us, and spinning it out as it came, was a hand-carriage, drawn by a man.  ‘Yes,’ said Miss Niner, ‘this really is my shadow, uncle.’  As the carriage approached us and we approached the carriage, I saw within it an old man, whose head was sunk on his breast, and who was enveloped in a variety of wrappers.  He was drawn by a very quiet but very keen-looking man, with iron-gray hair, who was slightly lame.  They had passed us, when the carriage stopped, and the old gentleman within, putting out his arm, called to me by my name.  I went back, and was absent from Mr. Slinkton and his niece for about five minutes.  When I rejoined them, Mr. Slinkton was the first to speak.  Indeed, he said to me in a raised voice before I came up with him:  ‘It is well you have not been longer, or my niece might have died of curiosity to know who her shadow is, Mr. Sampson.’  ‘An old East India Director,’ said I.  ‘An intimate friend of our friend’s, at whose house I first had the pleasure of meeting you.  A certain Major Banks.  You have heard of him?’  ‘Never.’  ‘Very rich, Miss Niner; but very old, and very crippled.  An amiable man, sensible—much interested in you.  He has just been expatiating on the affection that he has observed to exist between you and your uncle.’  Mr. Slinkton was holding his hat again, and he passed his hand up the straight walk, as if he himself went up it serenely, after me.  ‘Mr. Sampson,’ he said, tenderly pressing his niece’s arm in his, ‘our affection was always a strong one, for we have had but few near ties.  We have still fewer now.  We have associations to bring us together, that are not of this world, Margaret.’  ‘Dear uncle!’ murmured the young lady, and turned her face aside to hide her tears.  ‘My niece and I have such remembrances and regrets in common, Mr. Sampson,’ he feelingly pursued, ‘that it would be strange indeed if the relations between us were cold or indifferent.  If I remember a conversation we once had together, you will understand the reference I make.  Cheer up, dear Margaret.  Don’t droop, don’t droop.  My Margaret! I cannot bear to see you droop!’  The poor young lady was very much affected, but controlled herself.  His feelings, too, were very acute.  In a word, he found himself under such great need of a restorative, that he presently went away, to take a bath of sea-water, leaving the young lady and me sitting by a point of rock, and probably presuming—but that you will say was a pardonable indulgence in a luxury—that she would praise him with all her heart.  She did, poor thing!  With all her confiding heart, she praised him to me, for his care of her dead sister, and for his untiring devotion in her last illness.  The sister had wasted away very slowly, and wild and terrible fantasies had come over her toward the end, but he had never been impatient with her, or at a loss; had always been gentle, watchful, and self-possessed.  The sister had known him, as she had known him, to be the best of men, the kindest of men, and yet a man of such admirable strength of character, as to be a very tower for the support of their weak natures while their poor lives endured.  ‘I shall leave him, Mr. Sampson, very soon,’ said the young lady; ‘I know my life is drawing to an end; and when I am gone, I hope he will marry and be happy.  I am sure he has lived single so long, only for my sake, and for my poor, poor sister’s.’  The little hand-carriage had made another great loop on the damp sand, and was coming back again, gradually spinning out a slim figure of eight, half a mile long.  ‘Young lady,’ said I, looking around, laying my hand upon her arm, and speaking in a low voice, ‘time presses.  You hear the gentle murmur of that sea?’   [Picture: “Young Lady,” said I, laying my Hand upon her Arm . . . “Time                                 presses”]  She looked at me with the utmost wonder and alarm, saying, ‘Yes!’  ‘And you know what a voice is in it when the storm comes?’  ‘Yes!’  ‘You see how quiet and peaceful it lies before us, and you know what an awful sight of power without pity it might be, this very night!’  ‘Yes!’  ‘But if you had never heard or seen it, or heard of it in its cruelty, could you believe that it beats every inanimate thing in its way to pieces, without mercy, and destroys life without remorse?’  ‘You terrify me, sir, by these questions!’  ‘To save you, young lady, to save you!  For God’s sake, collect your strength and collect your firmness!  If you were here alone, and hemmed in by the rising tide on the flow to fifty feet above your head, you could not be in greater danger than the danger you are now to be saved from.’  The figure on the sand was spun out, and straggled off into a crooked little jerk that ended at the cliff very near us.  ‘As I am, before Heaven and the Judge of all mankind, your friend, and your dead sister’s friend, I solemnly entreat you, Miss Niner, without one moment’s loss of time, to come to this gentleman with me!’  If the little carriage had been less near to us, I doubt if I could have got her away; but it was so near that we were there before she had recovered the hurry of being urged from the rock.  I did not remain there with her two minutes.  Certainly within five, I had the inexpressible satisfaction of seeing her—from the point we had sat on, and to which I had returned—half supported and half carried up some rude steps notched in the cliff, by the figure of an active man.  With that figure beside her, I knew she was safe anywhere.  I sat alone on the rock, awaiting Mr. Slinkton’s return.  The twilight was deepening and the shadows were heavy, when he came round the point, with his hat hanging at his button-hole, smoothing his wet hair with one of his hands, and picking out the old path with the other and a pocket-comb.  ‘My niece not here, Mr. Sampson?’ he said, looking about.  ‘Miss Niner seemed to feel a chill in the air after the sun was down, and has gone home.’  He looked surprised, as though she were not accustomed to do anything without him; even to originate so slight a proceeding.  ‘I persuaded Miss Niner,’ I explained.  ‘Ah!’ said he.  ‘She is easily persuaded—for her good.  Thank you, Mr. Sampson; she is better within doors.  The bathing-place was farther than I thought, to say the truth.’  ‘Miss Niner is very delicate,’ I observed.  He shook his head and drew a deep sigh.  ‘Very, very, very.  You may recollect my saying so.  The time that has since intervened has not strengthened her.  The gloomy shadow that fell upon her sister so early in life seems, in my anxious eyes, to gather over her, ever darker, ever darker.  Dear Margaret, dear Margaret!  But we must hope.’  The hand-carriage was spinning away before us at a most indecorous pace for an invalid vehicle, and was making most irregular curves upon the sand.  Mr. Slinkton, noticing it after he had put his handkerchief to his eyes, said:  ‘If I may judge from appearances, your friend will be upset, Mr. Sampson.’  ‘It looks probable, certainly,’ said I.  ‘The servant must be drunk.’  ‘The servants of old gentlemen will get drunk sometimes,’ said I.  ‘The major draws very light, Mr. Sampson.’  ‘The major does draw light,’ said I.  By this time the carriage, much to my relief, was lost in the darkness. We walked on for a little, side by side over the sand, in silence.  After a short while he said, in a voice still affected by the emotion that his niece’s state of health had awakened in him,  ‘Do you stay here long, Mr. Sampson?’  ‘Why, no.  I am going away to-night.’  ‘So soon?  But business always holds you in request.  Men like Mr. Sampson are too important to others, to be spared to their own need of relaxation and enjoyment.’  ‘I don’t know about that,’ said I.  ‘However, I am going back.’  ‘To London?’  ‘To London.’  ‘I shall be there too, soon after you.’  I knew that as well as he did.  But I did not tell him so.  Any more than I told him what defensive weapon my right hand rested on in my pocket, as I walked by his side.  Any more than I told him why I did not walk on the sea side of him with the night closing in.  We left the beach, and our ways diverged.  We exchanged good-night, and had parted indeed, when he said, returning,  ‘Mr. Sampson, _may_ I ask?  Poor Meltham, whom we spoke of,—dead yet?’  ‘Not when I last heard of him; but too broken a man to live long, and hopelessly lost to his old calling.’  ‘Dear, dear, dear!’ said he, with great feeling.  ‘Sa"]]]
