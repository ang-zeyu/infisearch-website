In its breadth, emptiness, and extent it had the majesty of inorganic nature, of matter that never dies.  The only reminder of mortality was a doctor’s brougham arrested in august solitude close to the curbstone.  The polished knockers of the doors gleamed as far as the eye could reach, the clean windows shone with a dark opaque lustre.  And all was still.  But a milk cart rattled noisily across the distant perspective; a butcher boy, driving with the noble recklessness of a charioteer at Olympic Games, dashed round the corner sitting high above a pair of red wheels.  A guilty-looking cat issuing from under the stones ran for a while in front of Mr Verloc, then dived into another basement; and a thick police constable, looking a stranger to every emotion, as if he too were part of inorganic nature, surging apparently out of a lamp-post, took not the slightest notice of Mr Verloc.  With a turn to the left Mr Verloc pursued his way along a narrow street by the side of a yellow wall which, for some inscrutable reason, had No. 1 Chesham Square written on it in black letters.  Chesham Square was at least sixty yards away, and Mr Verloc, cosmopolitan enough not to be deceived by London’s topographical mysteries, held on steadily, without a sign of surprise or indignation.  At last, with business-like persistency, he reached the Square, and made diagonally for the number 10.  This belonged to an imposing carriage gate in a high, clean wall between two houses, of which one rationally enough bore the number 9 and the other was numbered 37; but the fact that this last belonged to Porthill Street, a street well known in the neighbourhood, was proclaimed by an inscription placed above the ground-floor windows by whatever highly efficient authority is charged with the duty of keeping track of London’s strayed houses.  Why powers are not asked of Parliament (a short act would do) for compelling those edifices to return where they belong is one of the mysteries of municipal administration.  Mr Verloc did not trouble his head about it, his mission in life being the protection of the social mechanism, not its perfectionment or even its criticism.  It was so early that the porter of the Embassy issued hurriedly out of his lodge still struggling with the left sleeve of his livery coat.  His waistcoat was red, and he wore knee-breeches, but his aspect was flustered.  Mr Verloc, aware of the rush on his flank, drove it off by simply holding out an envelope stamped with the arms of the Embassy, and passed on.  He produced the same talisman also to the footman who opened the door, and stood back to let him enter the hall.  A clear fire burned in a tall fireplace, and an elderly man standing with his back to it, in evening dress and with a chain round his neck, glanced up from the newspaper he was holding spread out in both hands before his calm and severe face.  He didn’t move; but another lackey, in brown trousers and claw-hammer coat edged with thin yellow cord, approaching Mr Verloc listened to the murmur of his name, and turning round on his heel in silence, began to walk, without looking back once.  Mr Verloc, thus led along a ground-floor passage to the left of the great carpeted staircase, was suddenly motioned to enter a quite small room furnished with a heavy writing-table and a few chairs.  The servant shut the door, and Mr Verloc remained alone.  He did not take a seat.  With his hat and stick held in one hand he glanced about, passing his other podgy hand over his uncovered sleek head.  Another door opened noiselessly, and Mr Verloc immobilising his glance in that direction saw at first only black clothes, the bald top of a head, and a drooping dark grey whisker on each side of a pair of wrinkled hands.  The person who had entered was holding a batch of papers before his eyes and walked up to the table with a rather mincing step, turning the papers over the while.  Privy Councillor Wurmt, Chancelier d’Ambassade, was rather short-sighted.  This meritorious official laying the papers on the table, disclosed a face of pasty complexion and of melancholy ugliness surrounded by a lot of fine, long dark grey hairs, barred heavily by thick and bushy eyebrows.  He put on a black-framed pince-nez upon a blunt and shapeless nose, and seemed struck by Mr Verloc’s appearance.  Under the enormous eyebrows his weak eyes blinked pathetically through the glasses.  He made no sign of greeting; neither did Mr Verloc, who certainly knew his place; but a subtle change about the general outlines of his shoulders and back suggested a slight bending of Mr Verloc’s spine under the vast surface of his overcoat.  The effect was of unobtrusive deference.  “I have here some of your reports,” said the bureaucrat in an unexpectedly soft and weary voice, and pressing the tip of his forefinger on the papers with force.  He paused; and Mr Verloc, who had recognised his own handwriting very well, waited in an almost breathless silence. “We are not very satisfied with the attitude of the police here,” the other continued, with every appearance of mental fatigue.  The shoulders of Mr Verloc, without actually moving, suggested a shrug. And for the first time since he left his home that morning his lips opened.  “Every country has its police,” he said philosophically.  But as the official of the Embassy went on blinking at him steadily he felt constrained to add: “Allow me to observe that I have no means of action upon the police here.”  “What is desired,” said the man of papers, “is the occurrence of something definite which should stimulate their vigilance.  That is within your province—is it not so?”  Mr Verloc made no answer except by a sigh, which escaped him involuntarily, for instantly he tried to give his face a cheerful expression.  The official blinked doubtfully, as if affected by the dim light of the room.  He repeated vaguely.  “The vigilance of the police—and the severity of the magistrates.  The general leniency of the judicial procedure here, and the utter absence of all repressive measures, are a scandal to Europe.  What is wished for just now is the accentuation of the unrest—of the fermentation which undoubtedly exists—”  “Undoubtedly, undoubtedly,” broke in Mr Verloc in a deep deferential bass of an oratorical quality, so utterly different from the tone in which he had spoken before that his interlocutor remained profoundly surprised. “It exists to a dangerous degree.  My reports for the last twelve months make it sufficiently clear.”  “Your reports for the last twelve months,” State Councillor Wurmt began in his gentle and dispassionate tone, “have been read by me.  I failed to discover why you wrote them at all.”  A sad silence reigned for a time.  Mr Verloc seemed to have swallowed his tongue, and the other gazed at the papers on the table fixedly.  At last he gave them a slight push.  “The state of affairs you expose there is assumed to exist as the first condition of your employment.  What is required at present is not writing, but the bringing to light of a distinct, significant fact—I would almost say of an alarming fact.”  “I need not say that all my endeavours shall be directed to that end,” Mr Verloc said, with convinced modulations in his conversational husky tone. But the sense of being blinked at watchfully behind the blind glitter of these eye-glasses on the other side of the table disconcerted him.  He stopped short with a gesture of absolute devotion.  The useful, hard-working, if obscure member of the Embassy had an air of being impressed by some newly-born thought.  “You are very corpulent,” he said.  This observation, really of a psychological nature, and advanced with the modest hesitation of an officeman more familiar with ink and paper than with the requirements of active life, stung Mr Verloc in the manner of a rude personal remark.  He stepped back a pace.  “Eh?  What were you pleased to say?” he exclaimed, with husky resentment.  The Chancelier d’Ambassade entrusted with the conduct of this interview seemed to find it too much for him.  “I think,” he said, “that you had better see Mr Vladimir.  Yes, decidedly I think you ought to see Mr Vladimir.  Be good enough to wait here,” he added, and went out with mincing steps.  At once Mr Verloc passed his hand over his hair.  A slight perspiration had broken out on his forehead.  He let the air escape from his pursed-up lips like a man blowing at a spoonful of hot soup.  But when the servant in brown appeared at the door silently, Mr Verloc had not moved an inch from the place he had occupied throughout the interview.  He had remained motionless, as if feeling himself surrounded by pitfalls.  He walked along a passage lighted by a lonely gas-jet, then up a flight of winding stairs, and through a glazed and cheerful corridor on the first floor.  The footman threw open a door, and stood aside.  The feet of Mr Verloc felt a thick carpet.  The room was large, with three windows; and a young man with a shaven, big face, sitting in a roomy arm-chair before a vast mahogany writing-table, said in French to the Chancelier d’Ambassade, who was going out with the papers in his hand:  “You are quite right, mon cher.  He’s fat—the animal.”  Mr Vladimir, First Secretary, had a drawing-room reputation as an agreeable and entertaining man.  He was something of a favourite in society.  His wit consisted in discovering droll connections between incongruous ideas; and when talking in that strain he sat well forward of his seat, with his left hand raised, as if exhibiting his funny demonstrations between the thumb and forefinger, while his round and clean-shaven face wore an expression of merry perplexity.  But there was no trace of merriment or perplexity in the way he looked at Mr Verloc.  Lying far back in the deep arm-chair, with squarely spread elbows, and throwing one leg over a thick knee, he had with his smooth and rosy countenance "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9745"],["title","The Rock of Chickamauga: A Story of the Western Crisis (#1)"],["body","! and my neck is bleeding in three places!”  “By thunder, Bill, I hit that fellow, fair and square! He'll never trouble an honest Yankee soldier again!”  The fierce buzzing increased all around them and Colonel Winchester shouted to his trumpeter:  “Blow the charge at once!”  The man, full willing, put the trumpet to his lips and blew loud and long. The whole regiment went across the creek at a gallop--the water flying in yellow showers--and did not stop until, emerging from the marsh, they reached the crest of a low hill a mile beyond. Here, stung, bleeding and completely defeated by the enemy they stopped for repairs. An occasional angry buzz showed that they were not yet safe from the skirmishers, but their attack seemed a light matter after the full assault of the determined foe.  “I suppose we're all wounded,” said Dick as he wiped a bleeding cheek. “At least as far as I can see they're hurt. The last fellow who got his bayonet in my face turned his weapon around and around and sang merrily at every revolution.”  “We were afraid of being ambushed by Forrest,” said Warner, speaking from a swollen countenance. “Instead we struck something worse; we rode straight into an ambush of ten billion high-powered mosquitoes, every one tipped with fire. Have we got enemies like these to fight all the way down here?”  “They sting the rebels, too,” said Pennington.  “Yes, but they like newcomers best, the unacclimated. When we rode down into that swamp I could hear them shouting, to one another: 'That fat fellow is mine, I saw him first! I've marked the rosy-cheeked boy for mine. Keep away the rest of you fellows!' I feel as if I'd been through a battle. No more marshes for me.”  Some of the provident produced bottles of oil of pennyroyal. Sergeant Daniel Whitley, who rode a giant bay horse, was one of the most foreseeing in this respect, and, after the boys had used his soothing liniment freely, the fiery torment left by the mosquito's sting passed away.  The sergeant seemed to have grown bigger and broader than ever. His shoulders were about to swell through his faded blue coat, and the hand resting easily on the rein had the grip and power of a bear's paw. His rugged face had been tanned by the sun of the far south to the color of an Indian's. He was formidable to a foe, and yet no gentler heart beat than that under his old blue uniform. Secretly he regarded the young lieutenants, his superiors in military rank and education, as brave children, and often he cared for them where his knowledge and skill were greater than theirs or even than that of colonels and generals.  “God bless you, Sergeant,” said Dick, “you don't look like an angel, but you are one--that is, of the double-fisted, fighting type.”  The sergeant merely smiled and replaced the bottle carefully in his pocket, knowing that they would have good use for it again.  The regiment after salving its wounds resumed its watchful march.  “Do you know where we're going?” Pennington asked Dick.  “I think we're likely if we live long enough to land in the end before Vicksburg, the great Southern fortress, but as I gather it we mean to curve and curl and twist about a lot before then. Grant, they say, intends to close in on Vicksburg, while Rosecrans farther north is watching Bragg at Chattanooga. We're a flying column, gathering up information, and ready for anything.”  “It's funny,” said Warner thoughtfully, “that we've already got so far south in the western field. We can't be more than two or three hundred miles from the Gulf. Besides, we've already taken New Orleans, the biggest city of the South, and our fleet is coming up the river to meet us. Yet in the East we don't seem to make any progress at all. We lose great battles there and Fredericksburg they say was just a slaughter of our men. How do you make it out, Dick?”  “I've thought of several reasons for it. Our generals in the West are better than our generals in the East, or their generals in the East are better than their generals in the West. And then there are the rivers. In the East they mostly run eastward between the two armies, and they are no help to us, but a hindrance rather. Here in the West the rivers, and they are many and great, mostly run southward, the way we want to go, and they bring our gunboats on their bosoms. Excuse my poetry, but it's what I mean.”  “You must be right. I think that all the reasons you give apply together. But our command of the water has surely been a tremendous help. And then we've got to remember, Dick, that there was never a navy like ours. It goes everywhere and it does everything. Why, if Admiral Farragut should tell one of those gunboats to steam across the Mississippi bottoms it would turn its saucy nose, steer right out of the water into the mud, and blow up with all hands aboard before it quit trying.”  “You two fellows talk too much,” said Pennington. “You won't let President Lincoln and Grant and Halleck manage the war, but you want to run it yourselves.”  “I don't want to run anything just now, Frank,” rejoined Dick. “What I'm thinking about most is rest and something to eat. I'd like to get rid, too, of about ten pounds of Mississippi mud that I'm carrying.”  “Well, I can catch a glint of white pillars through those trees. It means the 'big house' of a plantation, and you'll probably find somewhere back of it the long rows of cabins, inhabited by the dark people, whom we've come to raise to the level of their masters, if not above them. I can see right now the joyous welcome we'll receive from the owners of the big house. They'll be standing on the great piazza, waving Union flags and shouting to us that they have ready cooling drinks and luxurious food for us all.”  “It's hardly a joke to me. Whatever the cause of the war, it's the bitterness of death for these people to be overrun. Besides, I remember the words of that old fellow in the blacksmith shop before we fought the battle of Stone River. He said that even if they were beaten they'd still be there holding the land and running things.”  “That's true,” said Warner. “I've been wondering how this war would end, and now I'm wondering what will happen after it does end. But here we are at the gate. What big grounds! These great planters certainly had space!”  “And what silence!” said Dick. “It's uncanny, George. A place like this must have had a thousand slaves, and I don't see any of them rushing forward to welcome their liberators.”  “Probably contraband, gone long ago to Ben Butler at New Orleans. I don't believe there's a soul here.”  “Remember that lone house in Tennessee where a slip of a girl brought Forrest down on us and had us cut pretty nearly to pieces.”  “I couldn't forget it.”  Nor could Colonel Winchester. The house, large and low, stood in grounds covering an area of several acres, enclosed by a paling fence, now sagging in many places. Great stone posts stood on either side of the gateway, but the gate was opened, and it, too, sagged.  The grounds had evidently been magnificent, both with flowers and forest trees. Already many of the flowers were blooming in great luxuriance and brilliancy, but the walks and borders were untrimmed. The house was of wood, painted white with green shutters, and as they drew nearer they appreciated its great size, although it was only two stories in height. A hundred persons could have slept there, and twice as many could have found shade in the wide piazzas which stretched the full length of the four sides.  But all the doors and shutters were closed and no smoke rose from any chimney. They caught a glimpse of the cabins for the slaves, on lower ground some distance behind the great house. The whole regiment reined up as they approached the carriage entrance, and, although they were eight hundred strong, there was plenty of room without putting a single hoof upon a flower.  It was a great place. That leaped to the eye, but it was not marked upon Colonel Winchester's map, nor had he heard of it.  “It's a grand house,” he said to his aides, “and it's a pity that it should go to ruin after the slaves are freed, as they certainly will be.”  “But it was built upon slave labor,” said Warner.  “So it was, and so were many of the most famous buildings in the world. But here, I'm not going to get into an argument about such questions with young men under my command. Besides, I'm fighting to destroy slavery, not to study its history. Sergeant Whitley, you're an experienced trailer: do you see any signs that troops have passed here?”  “None at all, sir. Down near the gate where the drive is out of repair I noticed wheel tracks, but they were several days old. The freshest of them were light, as if made by buggies. I judge, sir, that it was the family, the last to leave.”  “And the wagons containing their valuables had gone on ahead?”  “It would seem so, sir.”  Colonel Winchester sighed.  “An invader is always feared and hated,” he said.  “But we do come as enemies,” said Dick, “and this feeling toward us can't be helped.”  “That's true. No matter what we do we'll never make any friends here in one of the Gulf states, the very core of Southern feeling. Dick, take a squad of men and enter the house. Pennington, you and Warner go with him.”  Dick sprang down instantly, chose Sergeant Whitley first and with the others entered the great portico. The front door was locked but it was easy enough to force it with a gun butt, and they went in, but not before Dick had noticed over the door in large letters the name, “Bellevue.” So this was Bellevue, one of the great cotton plantations of Mississippi. He now vaguely remembered that he had once heard his uncle, Colonel Kenton, speak of having stopped a week here. But he could not recall the name of the owner. Strong for the Union as he was Dick was glad that the family had gone before the Northern cavalry came.  The house was on a splendid scale inside also, but all the rugs and curtains were gone. As they entered the"]]]
