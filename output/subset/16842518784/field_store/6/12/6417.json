Then, without as much as a glance at the dead man, he left the room, and again visited the telephone box. He was engaged in it for a few minutes. When he came out he heard steps coming up the staircase, and looking over the banisters he saw the senior partner, Eldrick, a middle-aged man. Eldrick looked up, and saw Pratt.  \"I hear you've been ringing me up at the club, Pratt,\" he said. \"What is it?\"  Pratt waited until Eldrick had come up to the landing. Then he pointed to the door of the private room, and shook his head.  \"It's old Mr. Bartle, sir,\" he whispered. \"He's in your room there--dead!\"  \"Dead?\" exclaimed Eldrick. \"Dead!\"  Pratt shook his head again.  \"He came up not so long after you'd gone, sir,\" he said. \"Everybody had gone but me--I was just going. Wanted to see you about something I don't know what. He was very tottery when he came in--complained of the stairs and the fog. I took him into your room, to sit down in the easy chair. And--he died straight off. Just,\" concluded Pratt, \"just as if he was going quietly to sleep!\"  \"You're sure he is dead?--not fainting?\" asked Eldrick.  \"He's dead, sir--quite dead,\" replied Pratt. \"I've rung up Dr. Melrose--he'll be here in a minute or two--and the Town Hall--the police--as well. Will you look at him, sir?\"  Eldrick silently motioned his clerk to open the door; together they walked into the room. And Eldrick looked at his quiet figure and wan face, and knew that Pratt was right.  \"Poor old chap!\" he murmured, touching one of the thin hands. \"He was a fine man in his time, Pratt; clever man! And he was very, very old--one of the oldest men in Barford. Well, we must wire to his grandson, Mr. Bartle Collingwood. You'll find his address in the book. He's the only relation the old fellow had.\"  \"Come in for everything, doesn't he, sir?\" asked Pratt, as he took an address book from the desk, and picked up a sheaf of telegram forms.  \"Every penny!\" murmured Eldrick. \"Nice little fortune, too--a fine thing for a young fellow who's just been called to the Bar. As a matter of fact, he'll be fairly well independent, even if he never sees a brief in his life.\"  \"He has been called, has he, sir?\" asked Pratt, laying a telegram form on Eldrick's writing pad and handing him a pen. \"I wasn't aware of that.\"  \"Called this term--quite recently--at Gray's Inn,\" replied Eldrick, as he sat down. \"Very promising, clever young man. Look here!--we'd better send two wires, one to his private address, and one to his chambers. They're both in that book. It's six o'clock, isn't it?--he might be at his chambers yet, but he may have gone home. I'll write both messages--you put the addresses on, and get the wire off--we must have him down here as soon as possible.\"  \"One address is 53x, Pump Court; the other's 96, Cloburn Square,\" remarked Pratt consulting the book. \"There's an express from King's Cross at 8.15 which gets here midnight.\"  \"Oh, it would do if he came down first thing in the morning--leave it to him,\" said Eldrick. \"I say, Pratt, do you think an inquest will be necessary?\"  Pratt had not thought of that--he began to think. And while he was thinking, the doctor whom he had summoned came in. He looked at the dead man, asked the clerk a few questions, and was apparently satisfied. \"I don't think there's any need for an inquest,\" he said in reply to Eldrick. \"I knew the old man very well--he was much feebler than he would admit. The exertion of coming up these stairs of yours, and the coughing brought on by the fog outside--that was quite enough. Of course, the death will have to be reported in the usual way, but I have no hesitation in giving a certificate. You've let the Town Hall people know? Well, the body had better be removed to his rooms--we must send over and tell his housekeeper. He'd no relations in the town, had he?\"  \"Only one in the world that he ever mentioned--his grandson--a young barrister in London,\" answered Eldrick. \"We've just been wiring to him. Here, Pratt, you take these messages now, and get them off. Then we'll see about making all arrangements. By-the-by,\" he added, as Pratt moved towards the door, \"you don't know what--what he came to see me about?\"  \"Haven't the remotest idea, sir,\" answered Pratt, readily and glibly. \"He died--just as I've told you--before he could tell me anything.\"  He went downstairs, and out into the street, and away to the General Post Office, only conscious of one thing, only concerned about one thing--that he was now the sole possessor of a great secret. The opportunity which he had so often longed for had come. And as he hurried along through the gathering fog he repeated and repeated a fragment of the recent conversation between the man who was now dead, and himself--who remained very much alive.  \"You haven't shown it to anybody else?\" Pratt had asked.  \"Neither shown it to anybody, nor mentioned it to a soul,\" Antony Bartle had answered. So, in all that great town of Barford, he, Linford Pratt, he, alone out of a quarter of a million people, knew--what? The magnitude of what he knew not only amazed but exhilarated him. There were such possibilities for himself in that knowledge. He wanted to be alone, to think out those possibilities; to reckon up what they came to. Of one thing he was already certain--they should be, must be, turned to his own advantage.  It was past eight o'clock before Pratt was able to go home to his lodgings. His landlady, meeting him in the hall, hoped that his dinner would not be spoiled: Pratt, who relied greatly on his dinner as his one great meal of the day, replied that he fervently hoped it wasn't, but that if it was it couldn't be helped, this time. For once he was thinking of something else than his dinner--as for his engagement for that evening, he had already thrown it over: he wanted to give all his energies and thoughts and time to his secret. Nevertheless, it was characteristic of him that he washed, changed his clothes, ate his dinner, and even glanced over the evening newspaper before he turned to the real business which was already deep in his brain. But at last, when the maid had cleared away the dinner things, and he was alone in his sitting-room, and had lighted his pipe, and mixed himself a drop of whisky-and-water--the only indulgence in such things that he allowed himself within the twenty-four hours--he drew John Mallathorpe's will from his pocket, and read it carefully three times. And then he began to think, closely and steadily.  First of all, the will was a good will. Nothing could upset it. It was absolutely valid. It was not couched in the terms which a solicitor would have employed, but it clearly and plainly expressed John Mallathorpe's intentions and meanings in respect to the disposal of his property. Nothing could be clearer. The properly appointed trustees were to realize his estate. They were to distribute it according to his specified instructions. It was all as plain as a pikestaff. Pratt, who was a good lawyer, knew what the Probate Court would say to that will if it were ever brought up before it, as he did, a quite satisfactory will. And it was validly executed. Hundreds of people, competent to do so, could swear to John Mallathorpe's signature; hundreds to Gaukrodger's; thousands to Marshall's--who as cashier was always sending his signature broadcast. No, there was nothing to do but to put that into the hands of the trustees named in it, and then....  Pratt thought next of the two trustees. They were well-known men in the town. They were comparatively young men--about forty. They were men of great energy. Their chief interests were in educational matters--that, no doubt, was why John Mallathorpe had appointed them trustees. Wyatt had been plaguing the town for two years to start commercial schools: Charlesworth was a devoted champion of technical schools. Pratt knew how the hearts of both would leap, if he suddenly told them that enormous funds were at their disposal for the furtherance of their schemes. And he also knew something else--that neither Charlesworth nor Wyatt had the faintest, remotest notion or suspicion that John Mallathorpe had ever made such a will, or they would have moved heaven and earth, pulled down Normandale Grange and Mallathorpe's Mill, in their efforts to find it.  But the effect--the effect of producing the will--now? Pratt, like everybody else, had been deeply interested in the Mallathorpe affair. There was so little doubt that John Mallathorpe had died intestate, such absolute certainty that his only living relations were his deceased brother's two children and their mother, that the necessary proceedings for putting Harper Mallathorpe and his sister Nesta in possession of the property, real and personal, had been comparatively simple and speedy. But--what was it worth? What would the two trustees have been able to hand over to the Mayor and Corporation of Barford, if the will had been found as soon as John Mallathorpe died? Pratt, from what he remembered of the bulk and calculations at the time, made a rapid estimate. As near as he could reckon, the Mayor and Corporation would have got about Â£300,000.  That, then--and this was what he wanted to get at--was what these young people would lose if he produced the will. Nay!--on second thoughts, it would be much more, very much more in some time; for the manufacturing business"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9839"],["title","The Cavalier (#1)"],["body","of me for this detail. He was an East Louisianian, of Tangipahoa; aged maybe twenty-six, but in effect older, having from birth eaten only ill-cooked food, and looking it; profoundly unconscious of any shortcoming in his education, which he had got from a small church-pecked college of the pelican sort that feed it raw from their own bosoms. One of his smallest deficiencies was that he had never seen as much art as there is in one handsome dinner-plate. Now, here he was, riding forth to learn for himself, privately, he said, why I did not appear. Yet he halted without turning, and seemed to wish he had not found me.  \"Did you\"--he began, and stopped; \"did you notice a\"--he stopped again.  \"What, a leather-curtained spring-wagon?\"  \"No-o!\" he said, as if nobody but a gaping idiot would expect anybody not a gaping idiot to notice a leather-curtained spring-wagon. \"No-o! did you notice the brown horse that man was riding who just now passed you as you turned off the road?\"  No, I barely remembered the rider had generously moved aside to let me go by. In pure sourness at the poverty of my dress and the perfection of his, I had avoided looking at him higher than his hundred-dollar boots. My feet were in uncolored cowhide, except the toes.  \"He noticed you,\" said Gholson; \"he looked back at you and your bay. Wouldn't you like to turn back and see his horse?\"  \"Why, hardly, if I'm behindhand now. Is it so fine as that?\"  \"Well, no. It's the horse he captured the time he got the Yankee who had him prisoner.\"  \"Who?\" I cried. \"What! You don't mean to say--was that Lieutenant Ferry?\"  \"Yes, so called. He wa'n't a lieutenant then, he was a clerk, like you or me.\"  \"Oh, I wish I had noticed him!\"  \"We can see him yet if you--\"  \"Do you want to see him?\" I gathered my horse.  \"Me!--No, sir. But you spoke as if--\"  I shook my head and we moved toward the tents. This was worse than the dream; the rat had not seen the cockerel, but the cockerel had observed the rat--dropping into the barrel: the cockerel, yes, and not the cockerel alone, for I saw that Gholson was associating him with her of the curtained wagon. By now they were side and side. I asked if Ferry came often to headquarters. \"Yes, quite as often as he's any business to.\" \"Ah, ha!\" thought I, and presently said I had heard he was a great favorite.  \"Well,--yes,--he--he is,--with some.\"  \"Don't you like him?\"  \"Who, me? Oh!--I--I admire Ned Ferry--for a number of things. He's more foolhardy than brave; he's confessed as much to me. Women call him handsome. He sings; beautifully, I suppose; I can't sing a note; and wouldn't if I could. Still, if he only wouldn't sing drinking-songs --but, Smith, I think that to sing drinking-songs--and all the more to sing them as well as some folks think he does--is to advocate drinking, and to advocate drinking is next door to excusing drunkenness!\"  \"Then Ned Ferry doesn't drink?\"  \"Indeed he does! I don't like to say it, and I don't say he drinks 'too much', as they call it; but, Smith, he drinks with men who do! Oh, _I_ admire him; only I do wish--\"  \"Wish what?\"  \"Oh, I--I wish he wouldn't play cards. Smith, I've seen him play cards with the shells bursting over us!\"  For my part I privately wished this saint wouldn't rub my uninteresting surname into me every time he spoke. As we dismounted near the tents I leaned against my saddle and asked further concerning the object of his loving anxiety. Was Ned Ferry generous, pleasant, frank?  \"Why, in outward manner, yes; but, Smith, he was raised to be a Catholic priest. I could a heap-sight easier trust him if he'd sometimes show distrust, himself. If he ever does I've never seen it. And yet--Oh, we're the best of friends, and I'm speaking now only as a friend and _toe_ a friend. Oh, if it wa'n't for just one thing, I could admit what Major Harper said of him not ten minutes ago to me; that you never finish talking to Ned Ferry without feeling a little brighter, happier and cleaner than when you began; whereas talking with some men it's just the reverse.\"  I looked carefully at my companion and asked him if the Major had said _all_ of that. He had, and Gholson's hide had turned it without taking a scratch. \"That's fine!--as to Ferry,\" I said.  \"Oh, yes,--it would be--if it was only _iso_. Trouble is, you keep remembering he's such a stumbling-block to any real spiritual inquirer. Yes, and to himself; for, you know, spiritually there's so much less hope for the moralist than what there is for the up-and-down reprobate! You know that,--_Smith_.\"  My silence implied that I knew it, though I did not feel any brighter, happier or cleaner.  \"Smith, Ned Ferry is not only a Romanist, he's a romanticist. We--you and me--are religionists. _Our_ brightness and happiness air the brightness and happiness of faith; our cleanness is the cleanness of religious scruples. Worst of it with Ned is he's satisfied with the difference, I'm afraid! That's what makes him so pleasant to fellows who don't care a sou marquee about religion.\"  I said one might respect religion even if he did not--  \"Oh, he's always _polite_ to it; but he's--he's read Voltaire! Oh, yes, Voltaire, George Sand, all those men. He questions the Bible, Smith. Not to me, though; hah, he knows better! Smith, I can discuss religion and not get mad, with any one who don't question the Bible; but if he does that, I just tell you, I wouldn't risk my soul in such a discussion! Would you?\"  I could hardly say, and we moved pensively toward Major Harper's tent. Evidently the main poison was still in Gholson's stomach, and when I glanced at him he asked, \"What d'you reckon brought Ned Ferry here just at this time?\"  I made no reply. He looked momentous, leaned to me sidewise with a hand horizontally across his mouth, and whispered a name. It was new to me. \"Charlie Toliver?\" I murmured, for we were at the tent door.  \"The war-correspondent,\" whispered Gholson; \"don't you know?\" But the flap of the tent lifted and I could not reply.    III   SHE  Major Harper was the most capable officer on the brigade staff. I had never met a man of such force and dignity who was so modestly affable. His new clerk dined with him that first day, at noon in his tent, alone. Hot biscuits! with butter! and rock salt. Fried bacon also--somewhat vivacious, but still bacon. When the tent began to fill with the smoke of his meerschaum pipe, and while his black boy cleared the table for us to resume writing, we talked of books. Here was joy! I vaunted my love for history, biography, the poets, but spoke lightly of fiction.  The smoker twinkled. \"You're different from Ned Ferry,\" he said.  \"Has he a taste for fiction?\" I asked, with a depreciative smirk.  \"Yes, a beautiful story is a thing Ned Ferry loves with a positive passion.\"  \"I suppose we might call him a romanticist,\" said I, \"might we not?\"  The patient gentleman smiled again as he said, \"Oh--Gholson can attend to that.\"  I took up my pen, and until twilight we spoke thereafter only of abstracts and requisitions. But then he led me on to tell him all about myself. I explained why my first name was Richard and my second name Thorndyke, and dwelt especially on the enormous differences between the Smiths from whom we were and those from whom we were not descended.  And then he told me about himself. He was a graduate of West Point, the only one on the brigade staff; was a widower, with a widowed brother, a maiden sister, two daughters, and a niece, all of one New Orleans household. The brothers and sister were Charlestonians, but the two men had married in New Orleans, twin sisters in a noted Creole family. The brother's daughter, I was told, spoke French better than English; the Major's elder daughter spoke English as perfectly as her father; and the younger, left in her aunt's care from infancy, knew no French at all. I wondered if they were as handsome as their white-haired father, and when I asked their names I learned that the niece, CÃ©cile, was a year the junior of Estelle and as much the senior of Camille; but of the days of the years of the pilgrimage of any of the three \"children\" he gave me no slightest hint; they might be seven years older, or seven years younger, than his new clerk.  To show him how little I cared for any girl's age whose father preferred not to mention it, I reverted to his sister and brother. She was in New Orleans, he said, with her nieces, but might at any moment be sent into the Confederacy, being one of General Butler's \"registered enemies.\" The brother was--  \"Out here somewhere. No, not in the army exactly; no, nor in the navy, but--I expect him in camp to-night. If he comes you'll have to work when you ought to be asleep. No, he is not in the secret service, only in _a_ secret service; running hospital supplies through the enemy's lines into ours.\"  I was thrilled. _I_ was taken into the staff's confidence! Me, _Smith!_ That _Major Harper_ would tell me part of a matter to conceal the rest of it did not enter my dreams, good as I was at dreaming. The flattery went to my brain, and presently, without the faintest preamble, I asked if there was any war-correspondent at headquarters just now. There came a hostile flash in his eyes, but instantly it passed, and with all his happy mildness he replied, \"No, nor any room for one.\"  Just then entered an ordnance-sergeant, so smart in his rags that the Major's affability seemed hardly a condescension. He asked me to supper with his mess--\"of staff _attatchays_,\" he said, winking one eye and hitching his mouth; at which the Major laughed with kind disapprobation, and the jocose sergeant explained as we went that that was only one of Scott Gholson's mispronunciations the boys were trying to tease him out of.  I found the clerks' mess a bunch of bright good fellows. After supper, stretched on the harsh turf under the June stars, with everyone's head (save mine) in some one's lap, we smoked, talked and sang. Only Gholson was"]]]
