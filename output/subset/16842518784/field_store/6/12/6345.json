When Moni saw this, he at once sat down on the ground in front of Paula and told her his day's experience with Mäggerli.  The young lady showed very keen interest in the affair and stroked the little rescued creature, which now lay quietly in Moni's lap and looked very pretty, with its white feet, and the beautiful black pelt on its back. It was very willing to be stroked by her.  \"Now sing your song again for me, while you are sitting here,\" said Paula. Moni was in such a gay frame of mind that he willingly and heartily began and sang his whole song to the end.  This pleased Paula exceptionally well and she said he must sing it to her often again. Then the whole company went together down to the Bath House. Here the kid was laid in its bed, Moni said farewell, and Paula went back to her room to talk with her aunt longer about the goat-boy, whose merry morning song she had enjoyed again.     CHAPTER III  A VISIT   Thus many days passed by, one as sunny and clear as the other, for it was an unusually beautiful summer, and the sky remained blue and cloudless from morning till evening.  Every morning, early, without exception the goat-boy, singing lustily, went by the Bath House. Every evening he came back again singing lustily. All the guests were so accustomed to the merry sound that not one would have willingly missed it.  More than all the others, Paula delighted in Moni's joyfulness and went out almost every evening to meet him, and talk with him.  One sunny morning Moni had once more reached the Pulpit-rock, and was about to throw himself down, when he changed his mind. \"No, go on! The last time you had to leave all the nice little plants because we had to go after Mäggerli; now we will go up there again, so that you can finish nibbling them!\"  The goats all leaped with delight after him, for they knew they were going up to the lovely bushes on the Dragon-stones. To-day Moni held his little Mäggerli the whole time fast in his arms, pulled the sweet plants himself from the rocks and let her eat out of his hand. This pleased the little goat best of all. She rubbed her head quite contentedly from time to time against Moni's shoulder and bleated happily. So the whole morning passed, before Moni noticed, from his own hunger, that it had grown late before he was aware of it. But he had left his luncheon below near the Pulpit-rock, in the little hole, for he had intended to return again at noon.  \"Well, you have had your fill of good things, and I have had nothing,\" he said to his goats. \"Now I must have something too, and you will find enough more down below. Come along!\" Whereupon he gave a loud whistle, and the whole flock started away, the liveliest always ahead, and first of all light-footed Swallow, who was to meet something unexpected to-day. She sprang down from stone to stone and across many a cleft in the rocks, but all at once she could go no farther--directly in front of her suddenly stood a chamois and gazed with curiosity into her face. This had never happened to Swallow before! She stood still, looked questioningly at the stranger and waited for the chamois to get out of her way and let her leap to the boulder, as she intended. But the chamois did not stir and gazed boldly into Swallow's eyes. So they stood facing each other, more and more obstinate, and might have stood there until now, if the big Sultan had not come along in the meantime. As soon as he saw the state of things, he stepped quite considerately past Swallow and suddenly pushed the chamois aside so far and with such violence, that she had to make a daring leap, not to fall down over the rocks. Swallow went triumphantly on her way, and the Sultan marched proudly and contentedly behind her, for he felt himself to be the sure protector of the goats in his flock.  Meanwhile Moni coming down from above, and another goat-boy coming up from below, met at the same spot and looked at each other in astonishment. But they were well acquainted, and after the first surprise greeted each other cordially. It was Jörgli from Küblis. Half the morning he had been looking in vain for Moni and now he met him up here, where he had not expected to find him.  \"I didn't suppose you came up so high with the goats,\" said Jörgli.  \"To be sure I do,\" replied Moni, \"but not always; usually I stay by the Pulpit-rock and around there. Why have you come up here?\"  \"To make you a visit,\" was the reply. \"I have something to tell you. Besides, I have two goats here, that I am bringing to the landlord at the Baths. He is going to buy one, and so I thought I would come up to see you.\"  \"Are they your own goats?\" asked Moni.  \"Surely, they are ours. I don't tend strange ones any longer. I am not a goat-boy now.\"  Moni was very much surprised at this, for Jörgli had become the goat-boy of Küblis at the same time he had been made goat-boy of Fideris, and Moni did not understand how Jörgli could give it up without a single murmur.  Meanwhile the goat-boys and their flocks had reached the Pulpit-rock. Moni brought out bread and a small piece of dried meat and invited Jörgli to share his midday meal. They both sat down on the Pulpit-rock and ate heartily, for it had grown very late and they had excellent appetites. When everything was eaten and they had drunk a little goat's milk, Jörgli comfortably stretched himself at full length on the ground, and rested his head on both arms, but Moni remained sitting, for he always liked to look down into the deep valley below.  \"But what are you now, Jörgli, if you are no longer goat-boy?\" began Moni. \"You must be something.\"  \"Surely I am something, and something very good,\" replied Jörgli, \"I am egg-boy. Every day I carry eggs to all the hotels, as far as I can go; I come up here to the Bath House, too. Yesterday I was there.\"  Moni shook his head. \"That's nothing. I wouldn't be an egg-boy; I would a thousand times rather be goat-boy, it is much finer.\"  \"But why?\"  \"Eggs are not alive, you can't speak a word to them, and they don't run after you like the goats which are glad to see you when you come, and are fond of you, and understand every word you say to them; you can't have any pleasure with eggs as you can with the goats up here.\"  \"Yes, and you,\" interrupted Jörgli, \"what great pleasure do you have up here? Just now you have had to get up six times while we were eating, just on account of that silly kid, to prevent it from falling down below--is that a pleasure?\"  \"Yes, I like to do that! Isn't it so, Mäggerli? Come! Come here!\" Moni jumped up and ran after the kid, for it was making dangerous leaps for sheer joy. When he sat down again, Jörgli said:  \"There is another way to keep the young goats from falling over the rocks, without having to be always jumping after them, as you do.\"  \"What is it?\" asked Moni.  \"Drive a stick firmly into the ground and fasten the goat by the leg to it; she will kick furiously, but she can't get away.\"  \"You needn't think I would do any such thing to the little kid!\" said Moni quite angrily and drew Mäggerli to him and held her fast, as if to protect her from any such treatment.  \"You really won't have to take care of that one much longer,\" began Jörgli again. \"It won't come up here many times more.\"  \"What? What? What did you say, Jörgli?\" demanded Moni.  \"Bah, don't you know about it? The landlord will not raise her, she is too weak; there never was a more feeble goat. He wanted to sell her to my father, but he wouldn't have her either; now the landlord is going to have her killed next week, and then he will buy our spotted one.\"  Moni had become quite pale from terror. At first he couldn't speak a word; but now he broke out and complained aloud over the little kid:  \"No, no, that shall not be done, Mäggerli, it shall not be done. They shall not slay you, I can't bear that. Oh, I would rather die with you; no, that cannot be!\"  \"Don't do so,\" said Jörgli, angrily, and pulled Moni up, for in his grief he had thrown himself face down on the ground. \"Stand up, you know the kid really belongs to the landlord and he can do what he likes with her. Think no more about it! Come, I know something. See! See!\" Whereupon Jörgli held out one hand to Moni, and with the other almost covered the object, which Moni was to admire; it sparkled wonderfully in his hand, for the sun shone straight into it.  \"What is it?\" asked Moni, when it sparkled again, lighted up by a sunbeam.  \"Guess!\"  \"A ring?\"  \"No, but something like that.\"  \"Who gave it to you?\"  \"Gave it to me? Nobody. I found it myself.\"  \"Then it does not belong to you, Jörgli.\"  \"Why not? I didn't take it from anybody. I almost stepped on it with my foot, then it would have been broken; so I can just as well keep it.\"  \"Where did you find it?\"  \"Down by the Bath House, yesterday evening.\"  \"Then some one from the house below lost it. You must tell the landlord, and if you don't, I will do it this evening.\"  \"No, no, Moni, don't do that,\" said Jörgli, beseechingly. \"See, I will show you what it is, and I will sell it to a maid in one of the hotels, but she will surely have to give me four francs; then I will give you one or two, and nobody will know anything about it.\"  \"I will not take it! I will not take it!\" interrupted Moni, hotly, \"and the dear Lord has heard everything you have said.\"  [Illustration: \"_Jörgli had opened his band. In it lay a cross set with a large number of stones_.\"]  Jörgli looked up to the sky: \"Oh, so far away,\" he said skeptically; but he immediately began to speak more softly.  \"He hears you still,\" said Moni, confidently.  It was no longer Jörgli's secret. If he didn't know how to bring Moni to his side, all would be lost. He thought and thought.  \"Moni,\" he said suddenly, \"I will promise you something that will delight you, if you will not say anything to a human being about what I have found; you really don't need to take anything for it, then you will have nothing to do with"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9384"],["title","The Comrade in White (#1)"],["body","be unto you.\"    --THE GOSPEL ACCORDING TO LUKE, chap. xxiv: 36.  \"The War has powerfully changed the 'psychological atmosphere,' and the thoughts of a great multitude are turned towards the spiritual aspect of existence. In this vast but connected universe we are not the only self-conscious beings. Life is working here as elsewhere, for some sublime purpose. The day is at hand when we shall turn from the child-like amusements and excitements of physical science to the unimaginable adventures of super-physical discovery; and in that day we shall not only flash our messages to the stars, but hold communion with our dead.\"  --HAROLD BEGBIE.    THE MESSENGER  The Parish Church stood high perched in the Glen, and through its clear windows we could see the white, winding road that was our one link with the great world beyond the mountains. Perhaps our eyes strayed from the preacher's face more than was seemly, and in spring time we had this excuse, that the fresh green of the larches against the dark rocks made a picture fairer to the eye than our plain old Church and its high pulpit.  But that Sunday in the spring of the Great War the minister had us all, even the young and thoughtless, in the hollow of his hand. It was the 18th chapter of Second Samuel that he had read earlier in the Service, and now he was opening its meaning to us with deep-felt realisation of those great dramatic episodes.  We saw the young man Absalom die. We saw Cushi start to bear his tidings to the king. We watched Ahimaaz swift on his track. We marked the king's anxious waiting, and the fixed gaze of the watchman on the city walls. We strained in the long strain of the runners. We fainted with the fears of a father's heart. We saw Ahimaaz outrun his rival yet falter in his message. And we heard the blow upon David's heart of Cushi's stroke. \"And the king said unto Cushi, Is the young man Absalom safe? And Cushi answered, The enemies of my lord the king, and all that rise against thee to do thee hurt, be as that young man is.\"  There were tears in the women's eyes as the preacher called us to see the stricken and weeping king climbing with weary step to the chamber over the gate. And in a solemn hush we heard the cry of his anguish \"--O my son Absalom! my son, my son Absalom! would God I had died for thee. O Absalom, my son, my son!\"  We had anxious fathers and mothers and wives and sisters in the Church that day, and it was as though our own sorrows were all gathered up into the old, unhappy, far-off things of which the preacher spoke. I had a dear one to be concerned for, but I was thinking now of some one else. For Widow McDonald was there, and the days had grown into weeks since last she had tidings of John--and he was her only boy.  Suddenly she rose and slipped out. I followed her, for there was an odd, silent friendship between us, and I thought that I might help. To my surprise she did not turn homewards, but down the Glen, and there I saw that some one was waiting for her by the pine wood. \"I saw your sign, sir,\" she said, \"and I guessed you brought news of John. Oh, sir, tell me quick, is he safe?\"  \"He is safe,\" the stranger answered. I could not see His face, but He seemed weary and far-travelled. It was His voice that made me wonder. For as He said \"safe,\" it was as a new word to me, so full of healing and of peace that it laid to rest every fear of my unquiet heart.  \"And will he be home soon?\" It was the mother who was speaking now.  \"I have taken the dear lad home,\" answered the stranger. \"His room has been long prepared for him in my Father's house. He has fought a good fight. He was wounded, but his wounds are healed. He was weary, but he has found rest.\" And so speaking He looked at us, and as the mother clasped my hand I knew that the truth was breaking on her too.  \"He is dead,\" she sobbed.  \"No,\" said the stranger, \"he is alive, for he has laid down his life that he might take it again.\"  There was silence then, and the stranger turned to leave us. Even in her grief the mourner was mindful of what was due to Him who had taken upon Himself the burden of sorrowful tidings.  \"Come back with us, and break bread, and rest a while,\" she said, \"for, sir, you seem spent, and it is out of a kind heart that you have spoken.\"  \"I may not tarry,\" He made answer, \"for there are many who need me, and I must go to them, but for thy comfort thou shalt first know who hath brought thee tidings of thy son's passage through death to life.\"  I dare not try to tell what happened then under the shadow of the pines, but somehow we _knew_ our eyes looked into the face of the soldiers' _The Comrade in White_; and we knew Him. And then His hand was lifted in blessing, and we heard this word, that is now as the music of our daily lives: \"Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you: not as the world giveth, give I unto you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid.\"         *       *       *       *       *  We walked in a strange, calm silence to the widow's cottage, and then as we parted she turned to me a face filled with heavenly peace--\"My dear boy lives,\" she said.     III. MAIMED OR PERFECTED?    \"Now no chastening for the present seemeth   to be joyous but grievous: nevertheless, afterward,   it yieldeth the peaceable fruit of righteousness   unto them which are exercised thereby.\"    --HEBREWS xii:11.  \"Six months passed within the danger zone, produces a subtle but marked change. Bright lads become men, who bear all the marks of having passed through a solemn purification by fire. And the subtle influence, as thus depicted, is communicated to us.... To say that the horrors of war have subdued and overawed them is but part of the explanation. It seems nearer to the truth to add, that these harrowing experiences, whatever they may have been, have only helped to make our young men susceptible to spiritual influences of the highest quality. In fine, they have been following in the footsteps of Him who is The Great Sacrifice, and even amid the bursting shells have caught a glimpse of wounds that transform and consecrate their own.\"  --_The Great Sacrifices_, JOHN ADAMS.    MAIMED OR PERFECTED?  My heart grew bitter in me when the news came of Harry's operation. I had been half relieved when I heard that he was wounded, and that the wound was not dangerous. For the grim alternative was seldom out of my thoughts, and at least his dear life was safe. Now I was crushed by the brave, pathetic letter in which he told me that his right leg had been amputated, and that he was lucky to get off so easily. That made me rebellious and very, very bitter. And it was against God that I felt worst--God who had allowed this unthinkable thing to be.  Harry a cripple! Harry of all people! I could not imagine it, nor accept it, nor even face the truth of it. And away at the bottom of my heart lurked the thought that it had been better for himself that he had died in the strength and beauty of his manhood. Why should his spirit be doomed to live on in a ruined home?  Harry is my only brother, and he has been my hero always. Manliness, strength, courage, unselfishness--I know what these things mean; they mean Harry. And of course I was proud when he got his double blue at Cambridge. Cricket and football were more than pastimes to him. He put his heart and soul into them, and when he made 106 not out against Oxford he was as happy as if he had found a new continent. And now the great athlete, the pride of his College, the big clean-limbed giant was a cripple. I could not weep for it, because I could not believe it. I took the thought and flung it from me. And then I picked it up again, and gazed at it with hard, unseeing eyes. It was at that time I stopped praying. What was prayer but a mockery, if Harry was maimed?  Harry was at Cairo, and I could not go to him. And though that made me feel helpless, and almost mad with inaction, yet in my heart I dreaded meeting him, seeing him, taking in the bitterness of it through the eyes. I was a coward, you see, and my love for him a poor thing at the best. But there are some who will understand how I felt, and will forgive me.  His letters were all right, not a word of complaint, for Harry never grumbled, and many a good story of the hospital and its patients and its staff. But there was something else, a kind of gentle seriousness as if life were different now. And I read my own misery into that, and pictured him a man devoured by a secret despair, while he smiled his brave undefeated smile in the face of all the world.  The weeks passed, and I braced myself for the coming ordeal. Then everything came with a rush at the last, and there I was at the docks giving my brave soldier his welcome home. It was not any easier than I expected. I tried my hardest, as you may guess, to be all joy and brightness, but when we were alone in the motor together my eyes were full of tears, and I broke down utterly. Poor Harry, poor Harry, why are physical calamities so awful and so irrevocable?  He let me cry, and then he said suddenly, \"Come, Mary, look at the real 'me,' don't bother about that old leg, but look into my face, and tell me what you see. There is something good for you to see if you will look for it.\"  He said it so strangely that I was myself in a moment, and doing what he told me just as in the good old days before the war. And then I saw that Harry was a new Harry altogether, and that he was radiantly happy. His face was pale and thin, but his eyes were ablaze with something mysterious and wonderful. \"Don't ask me anything now,\" he said; \"wait till we are in my old den, and then I will tell you everything.\" And by this time I was so comforted that I was content to lie back and watch that dear, happy face of his.  I shall never forget the talk we had afterwards. \"Mary,\" he said, in his straight, direct way, \"I've come back a better man. I have been all my life a healthy, happy pagan. We were "]]]
