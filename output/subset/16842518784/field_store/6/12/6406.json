The flower-pot burst to pieces with the concussion, or was prepared so as to explode of itself, and the contract of the Commissioners, bearing testimony to their private roguery, was thrown into the midst of the visiters assembled. If I have recollected this incident accurately, for it is more than forty years since I perused the tract, it is probable, that in omitting it from the novel, I may also have passed over, from want of memory, other matters which might have made an essential addition to the story. Nothing, indeed, is more certain, than that incidents which are real, preserve an infinite advantage in works of this nature over such as are fictitious. The tree, however, must remain where it has fallen.  Having occasion to be in London in October 1831, I made some researches in the British Museum, and in that rich collection, with the kind assistance of the Keepers, who manage it with so much credit to themselves and advantage to the public, I recovered two original pamphlets, which contain a full account of the phenomena at Woodstock in 1649.[3] The first is a satirical poem, published in that year, which plainly shews that the legend was current among the people in the very shape in which it was afterwards made public. I have not found the explanation of Joe Collins, which, as mentioned by Mr. Hone, resolves the whole into confederacy. It might, however, be recovered by a stricter search than I had leisure for. In the meantime, it may be observed, that neither the name of Joe Collins, nor Sharp, occurs among the _dramatis personæ_ given in these tracts, published when he might have been endangered by any thing which directed suspicion towards him, at least in 1649, and perhaps might have exposed him to danger even in 1660, from the malice of a powerful though defeated faction.

THE WOODSTOCK SCUFFLE;  or, Most dreadfull apparitions that were lately seene in the Mannor-house of Woodstock, neere Oxford, to the great terror and the wonderful amazement of all there that did behold them.   It were a wonder if one unites, And not of wonders and strange sights; For ev’ry where such things affrights           Poore people,   That men are ev’n at their wits’ end; God judgments ev’ry where doth send, And yet we don’t our lives amend,           But tipple,   And sweare, and lie, and cheat, and—, Because the world shall drown no more, As if no judgments were in store           But water;   But by the stories which I tell, You’ll heare of terrors come from hell, And fires, and shapes most terrible           For matter.   It is not long since that a child Spake from the ground in a large field, And made the people almost wild           That heard it,   Of which there is a printed book, Wherein each man the truth may look, If children speak, the matter’s took           For verdict.   But this is stranger than that voice, The wonder’s greater, and the noyse; And things appeare to men, not boyes,           At _Woodstock_;   Where _Rosamond_ had once a bower, To keep her from Queen _Elinour_, And had escap’d her poys’nous power           By good-luck,   But fate had otherwise decreed, And _Woodstock_ Manner saw a deed, Which is in _Hollinshed_ or _Speed_           Chro-nicled;   But neither _Hollinshed_ nor _Stow_, Nor no historians such things show, Though in them wonders we well know           Are pickled;   For nothing else is history But pickle of antiquity, Where things are kept in memory           From stinking;   Which otherwise would have lain dead, As in oblivion buried, Which now you may call into head           With thinking.   The dreadfull story, which is true, And now committed unto view, By better pen, had it its due,           Should see light.   But I, contented, do indite, Not things of wit, but things of right; You can’t expect that things that fright           Should delight.   O hearken, therefore, hark and shake! My very pen and hand doth quake! While I the true relation make           O’ th’ wonder,   Which hath long time, and still appeares Unto the State’s Commissioners, And puts them in their beds to feares           From under.   They come, good men, imploi’d by th’ State To sell the lands of Charles the late. And there they lay, and long did waite           For chapmen.   You may have easy pen’worths, woods, Lands, ven’son, householdstuf, and goods, They little thought of dogs that wou’d           There snap-men.   But when they’d sup’d, and fully fed, They set up remnants and to bed. Where scarce they had laid down a head           To slumber,   But that their beds were heav’d on high; They thought some dog under did lie, And meant i’ th’ chamber (fie, fie, fie)           To scumber.   Some thought the cunning cur did mean To eat their mutton (which was lean) Reserv’d for breakfast, for the men           Were thrifty.   And up one rises in his shirt, Intending the slie cur to hurt, And forty thrusts made at him for’t,           Or fifty.   But empty came his sword again. He found he thrust but all in vain; An the mutton safe, hee went amain           To’s fellow.   And now (assured all was well) The bed again began to swell, The men were frighted, and did smell           O’ th’ yellow.   From heaving, now the cloaths it pluckt The men, for feare, together stuck, And in their sweat each other duck’t.           They wished   A thousand times that it were day; ’Tis sure the divell! Let us pray. They pray’d amain; and, as they say, —— ——   Approach of day did cleere the doubt, For all devotions were run out, They now waxt strong and something stout,           One peaked   Under the bed, but nought was there; He view’d the chamber ev’ry where, Nothing apear’d but what, for feare. vThey leaked.   Their stomachs then return’d apace, They found the mutton in the place, And fell unto it with a grace.           They laughed   Each at the other’s pannick feare, And each his bed-fellow did jeere, And having sent for ale and beere,           They quaffed.   And then abroad the summons went, Who’ll buy king’s-land o’ th’ Parliament? A paper-book contein’d the rent,           Which lay there;   That did contein the severall farmes, Quit-rents, knight services, and armes; But that they came not in by swarmes           To pay there.   Night doth invite to bed again, The grand Commissioners were lain, But then the thing did heave amain,           It busled,   And with great clamor fil’d their eares, The noyse was doubled, and their feares; Nothing was standing but their haires,           They nuzled.   Oft were the blankets pul’d, the sheete Was closely twin’d betwixt their feete, It seems the spirit was discreete           And civill.   Which makes the poore Commissioners Feare they shall get but small arreares, And that there’s yet for cavaliers           One divell.   They cast about what best to doe; Next day they would to wisemen goe, To neighb’ring towns some cours to know;           For schollars   Come not to Woodstock, as before, And Allen’s dead as a nayle-doore, And so’s old John (eclep’d the poore)           His follower;   Rake Oxford o’re, there’s not a man That rayse or lay a spirit can, Or use the circle, or the wand,           Or conjure;   Or can say (Boh!) unto a divell, Or to a goose that is uncivill, Nor where Keimbolton purg’d out evill,           ’Tis sin sure.   There were two villages hard by, With teachers of presbytery, Who knew the house was hidiously           Be-pestred;   But ’lasse! their new divinity Is not so deep, or not so high; Their witts doe (as their meanes did) lie           Sequestred;   But Master Joffman was the wight Which was to exorcise the spright; Hee’ll preach and pray you day and night           At pleasure.   And by that painfull gainfull trade, He hath himselfe full wealthy made; Great store of guilt he hath, ’tis said,           And treasure.   But no intreaty of his friends Could get him to the house of fiends, He came not over for such ends           From Dutch-land,   But worse divinity hee brought, And hath us reformation taught, And, with our money, he hath bought           Him much land.   Had the old parsons preached still, The div’l should nev’r have had his wil; But those that had or art or skill           Are outed;   And those to whom the pow’r was giv’n Of driving spirits, are out-driv’n; Their colledges dispos’d, and livings,           To grout-heads.   There was a justice who did boast, Hee had as great a gift almost, Who did desire him to accost           This evill.   But hee would not employ his gifts. But found out many sleights and shifts; Hee had no prayers, nor no snifts,           For th’ divell.   Some other way they cast about, These brought him in, they throw not out; A woman, great with child, will do’t;           They got one.   And she i’ th’ room that night must lie; But when the thing about did flie, And broke the windows furiously           And hot one   Of the contractors o’re the head, Who lay securely in his bed, The woman, shee-affrighted, fled —— ——   And now they lay the cause on her. That e’re that night the thing did stir, Because her selfe and grandfather           Were Papists;   They must be barnes-regenerate, (A _Hans en Kelder_ of the state, Which was in reformation gatt,)           They said, which   Doth make the divell stand in awe, Pull in his hornes, his hoof, his claw; But having none, they did in draw —— —— ——   But in the night there was such worke, The spirit swaggered like a Turke; The bitch had spi’d where it did lurke,           And howled   In such a wofull manner that Their very"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9791"],["title","Harrigan (#1)"],["body"," side. Out of the corner of his eye he saw the black-haired man come into the battle, straight and stiff as before, with long arms shooting out like pistons.  It was a glorious sight. Something made Harrigan's heart big; rose and swelled his throat; rose again and came as a wild yell upon his tongue. The unfortunates who have faced Irish legions in battle know that yell. The soldiers did not know it, and they held back for a moment. Something else lowered their spirits still more. It was the clanging of the police patrol as it swung to a halt and a body of reserves poured out.  \"Here comes our finish!\" panted Harrigan to his comrade in arms. \"But oh, man, I'm thinkin' it was swate while it lasted!\"  In his great moments the Irish brogue thronged thick upon his tongue.  \"Finish, hell!\" grunted the other. \"After me, lad!\"  And lowering his head like a bull, he drove forward against the crowd. Harrigan caught the idea in a flash. He put his shoulder to the hip of his friend. They became a flying wedge with the jabbing fists of the black-haired man for a point--and they sank into the mass of soldiers like a hot knife into butter, shearing them apart.  There were few who wished more action, for the police reserves were capturing man after man. One or two resisted, but a revolver fired straight in the air put a sudden period to such thoughts. The crowd scattered in all directions and Harrigan was taking to his heels among the rest when an iron hand caught his shoulder and jerked him to a halt. It was the black-haired man.  \"Easy,\" he cautioned. He pulled a cap out and settled it upon his head. Harrigan followed suit with his soft hat.  \"Are you after givin' yourself away to the law?\" he queried, bewildered.  \"Steady, you fool,\" said the other; \"they're only after the ones who run away.\"  An excited Kanaka confronted them with brandished club.  \"What's the cause of the disturbance, officer?\" asked the big man.  The policeman for answer waved them away and darted after a running soldier.  \"I'll be damned!\" murmured Harrigan, and his eyes dwelt on his companion's face almost tenderly.  They were at the edge of the crowd when a shrill voice called: \"Those two big men! Halt 'em! Stand!\"  Officer Akana ran through the crowd with his regulation Colt brandished above his head.  \"The time's come!\" said Harrigan's new friend, and broke into a run.     CHAPTER 2   They were past the thick of the mob now and they dodged rapidly among the cottages until the clamor of police fell away to a murmur behind them, and they swung out onto the narrow, dark street which led back toward the heart of Honolulu. For ten minutes they strode along without a word. Under the light of a street lamp they stopped of one accord.  \"I'm McTee.\"  \"I'm Harrigan.\"  The gripping of the hands was more than fellowship; it was like a test of strength which left each uncertain of the other's resources. They were exactly opposite types. McTee was long of face, with an arched, cruel nose, gleaming eyes, heavy, straight brows which pointed up and gave a touch of the Mephistophelian to his expression, a narrow, jutting chin, and lips habitually compressed to a thin line. It was a handsome face, in a way, but it showed such a brutal dominance that it inspired fear first and admiration afterward.  Such a man must command. He might be only the boss of a gang of laborers, or he might be a financier, but never in any case an underling. Altogether he combined physical and intellectual strength to such a degree that both men and women would have stopped to look at him, and once seen he would be remembered.  On the other hand, in Harrigan one felt only force, not directed and controlled as in McTee, but impulsive, irregular, irresponsible, uncompassed. He carried a contradiction in his face. The heavy, hard-cut jaw, the massive cheekbones, the stiff, straight upper lip indicated merely brutal endurance and energy, but these qualities were tempered by possibilities of tenderness about the lips and by the singular lights forever changing in the blue eyes. He would be hard for the shrewdest judge to understand, for the simple reason that he did not know himself.  In looking at McTee, one asked: \"What is he?\" In looking at Harrigan, the question was: \"What will he become?\"  \"Stayin' in town long?\" asked Harrigan, and his voice was a little wistful.  \"I'm bound out tonight.\"  \"So long, then.\"  \"So long.\"  They turned on their heels into opposite streets without further words, with no thanks given for service rendered, with no exchange of congratulations for the danger they had just escaped. That parting proved them hardened knights of the road which leads across the world and never turns back home.  Harrigan strode on full of thought. His uncertain course brought him at last to the waterfront, and he idled along the black, odorous docks until he came to a pier where a ship was under steam, making ready to put out to sea. The spur touched the heart of Harrigan. The urge never failed to prick him when he heard the scream of a steamer's horn as it put to sea. It brought the thoughts of far lands and distant cities.  He strolled out to the pier and watched the last ropes cast loose. The ship was not large, and even in the dark it seemed dingy and dilapidated. He guessed that, big or small, this boat would carry her crew to some distant quarter of the world, and therefore to a place to be desired.  A strong voice gave an order from the deck--a hard voice with a ring in it like the striking of iron against iron. Harrigan glanced up with a start of recognition, and by the light of a swinging lantern he saw McTee. If he were in command, this ship was certainly going to a far port. Black water showed between the dock and the ship. In a moment more it would be beyond reach, and that thought decided Harrigan. He made a few paces back, noted the aperture in the rail of the ship where the gangplank was being drawn in, then ran at full speed and leaped high in the air.  The three sailors at the rail shouted their astonishment as Harrigan struck the edge of the gangplank, reeled, and then pitched forward to his knees. He rose and shook himself like a cat that has dropped from a high fence to the ground.  \"What're you?\"  \"I'm the extra hand.\"  And Harrigan ran up the steps to the bridge. There he found McTee with the first and second mates.  \"McTee,\" he said, \"I came on your ship by chance an' saw you. If you _can_ use an extra hand, let me stay. I'm footfree an' I need to be movin' on.\"  Even through the gloom he caught the glint of the Scotchman's eye.  \"Get off the bridge!\" thundered McTee.  \"But I'm Harrigan, and--\"  McTee turned to his first and second mates.  \"Throw that man off the bridge!\" he ordered.  Harrigan didn't wait. He retreated down the steps to the deck and went to the rail. A wide gap of swarthy water now extended between the ship and the dock, but he placed his knee on the rail ready to dive. Then he turned and stood with folded arms looking up to the bridge, for his mind was dark with many doubts. He tapped a passing sailor on the shoulder.  \"What sort of an old boy is the captain?\"  He made up his mind that according to the answer he would stay with the ship or swim to the shore, but the sailor merely stared stupidly at him for a moment and then grinned slowly. There might be malice, there might be mere ridicule in that smile. He passed on before another question could be asked.  \"Huh!\" grunted Harrigan. \"I stay!\"  He kept his eyes fixed on the bridge, remaining motionless at the rail for an hour while the glow of Honolulu grew dimmer and dimmer past the stern. There were lights in the after-cabin and he guessed that the ship, in a small way, carried both freight and passengers. At last McTee came down the steps to the deck and as he passed Harrigan snapped: \"Follow me.\"  He led the way aft and up another flight of steps to the after-cabin, unlocked a door, and showed Harrigan into the captain's room. Here he took one chair and Harrigan dropped easily into another.  \"Now, what 'n hell was your line of thinkin', McTee,\" he began, \"when you told me to--\"  \"Stand up!\" said McTee.  \"What?\"  \"Stand up!\"  Harrigan rose very slowly. His jaw was setting harder and harder, and his face became grim.  \"Harrigan, you took a chance and came with me.\"  \"Yes.\"  \"I didn't ask you to come.\"  \"Sure you didn't, but if you think you can treat me like a swine and get away with it--\"  It was wonderful to see the eyes of McTee grow small. They seemed to retreat until they became points of light shining from the deep shadow of his brow. They were met by the cold, incurious light of Harrigan's stare.  \"You're a hard man, Harrigan.\"  He made no answer, but listened to the deep thrum of the engines. It seemed to him that the force which drove the ship was like a part of McTee's will, a thing of steel.  \"And I'm a hard man, Harrigan. On this ship I'm king. There's no will but my will; there's no right but my right; there's no law but my law. Remember, on land we stood as equals. On this ship you stand and I sit.\"  The thin lips did not curve, and yet they seemed to be smiling cruelly, and the eyes were probing deep, deep, deep into Harrigan's soul, weighing, measuring, searching.  \"When we reach land,\" said Harrigan, \"I got an idea I'll have to break you.\"  He raised his hands, which trembled with the restrained power of his arms, and moved them as though slowly breaking a stick of wood.  \"I've broken men--like that,\" he finished.  \"When I'm through with you, Harrigan, you'll take water from a Chinaman. You're the first man I've ever seen who could make me stop and look twice. I need a fellow like you, but first I've got to make you my man. The best colt in the world is no good until he learns to take the whip without bucking. I'm going to get you used to the whip. This is frank talk, eh? Well, I'm a frank man. You're in the harness now, Harrigan; make up your mind: Will you pull or will you"]]]
