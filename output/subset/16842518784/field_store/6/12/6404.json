As he cleared the Spanish battalions, the unfortunate monarch checked his horse for a moment and gazed along the plain: he beheld his army flying in all directions, save in that single spot where yet glittered the turban of Muza Ben Abil Gazan.  As he gazed, he heard the panting nostrils of the chargers behind, and saw the levelled spears of a company despatched to take him, alive or dead, by the command of Ferdinand.  He laid the reins upon his horse's neck and galloped into the city--three lances quivered against the portals as he disappeared through the shadows of the arch.  But while Muza remained, all was not yet lost: he perceived the flight of the infantry and the king, and with his followers galloped across the plain: he came in time to encounter and slay, to a man, the pursuers of Boabdil; he then threw himself before the flying Moors:  \"Do ye fly in the sight of your wives and daughters?  Would ye not rather they beheld ye die?\"  A thousand voices answered him.  \"The banner is in the hands of the infidel--all is lost!\"  They swept by him, and stopped not till they gained the gates.  But still a small and devoted remnant of the Moorish cavaliers remained to shed a last glory over defeat itself.  With Muza, their soul and centre, they fought every atom of ground: it was, as the chronicler expresses it, as if they grasped the soil with their arms.  Twice they charged into the midst of the foe: the slaughter they made doubled their own number; but, gathering on and closing in, squadron upon squadron, came the whole Christian army--they were encompassed, wearied out, beaten back, as by an ocean.  Like wild beasts, driven, at length, to their lair, they retreated with their faces to the foe; and when Muza came, the last--his cimiter shivered to the hilt,--he had scarcely breath to command the gates to be closed and the portcullis lowered, ere he fell from his charger in a sudden and deadly swoon, caused less by his exhaustion than his agony and shame.  So ended the last battle fought for the Monarchy of Granada!     CHAPTER II.  THE NOVICE.  It was in one of the cells of a convent renowned for the piety of its inmates and the wholesome austerity of its laws that a young novice sat alone.  The narrow casement was placed so high in the cold grey wall as to forbid to the tenant of the cell the solace of sad or the distraction of pious thoughts, which a view of the world without might afford. Lovely, indeed, was the landscape that spread below; but it was barred from those youthful and melancholy eyes: for Nature might tempt to a thousand thoughts, not of a tenor calculated to reconcile the heart to an eternal sacrifice of the sweet human ties.  But a faint and partial gleam of sunshine broke through the aperture and made yet more cheerless the dreary aspect and gloomy appurtenances of the cell.  And the young novice seemed to carry on within herself that struggle of emotions without which there is no victory in the resolves of virtue: sometimes she wept bitterly, but with a low, subdued sorrow, which spoke rather of despondency than passion; sometimes she raised her head from her breast, and smiled as she looked upward, or as her eyes rested on the crucifix and the death's head that were placed on the rude table by the pallet on which she sat.  They were emblems of death here, and life hereafter, which, perhaps, afforded to her the sources of a twofold consolation.  She was yet musing, when a slight tap at the door was heard, and the abbess of the convent appeared.  \"Daughter,\" said she, \"I have brought thee the comfort of a sacred visitor.  The Queen of Spain, whose pious tenderness is maternally anxious for thy full contentment with thy lot, has sent hither a holy friar, whom she deems more soothing in his counsels than our brother Tomas, whose ardent zeal often terrifies those whom his honest spirit only desires to purify and guide.  I will leave him with thee.  May the saints bless his ministry!\"  So saying the abbess retired from the threshold, making way for a form in the garb of a monk, with the hood drawn over the face.  The monk bowed his head meekly, advanced into the cell, closed the door, and seated himself, on a stool--which, save the table and the pallet, seemed the sole furniture of the dismal chamber.  \"Daughter,\" said he, after a pause, \"it is a rugged and a mournful lot this renunciation of earth and all its fair destinies and soft affections, to one not wholly prepared and armed for the sacrifice. Confide in me, my child; I am no dire inquisitor, seeking to distort thy words to thine own peril.  I am no bitter and morose ascetic.  Beneath these robes still beats a human heart that can sympathise with human sorrows.  Confide in me without fear.  Dost thou not dread the fate they would force upon thee?  Dost thou not shrink back?  Wouldst thou not be free?\"  \"No,\" said the poor novice; but the denial came faint and irresolute from her lips.  \"Pause,\" said the friar, growing more earnest in his tone: \"pause--there is yet time.\"  \"Nay,\" said the novice, looking up with some surprise in her countenance; \"nay, even were I so weak, escape now is impossible.  What hand could unbar the gates of the convent?\"  \"Mine!\" cried the monk, with impetuosity.  \"Yes, I have that power.  In all Spain, but one man can save thee, and I am he.\"  \"You!\" faltered the novice, gazing at her strange visitor with mingled astonishment and alarm.  \"And who are you that could resist the fiat of that Tomas de Torquemada, before whom, they tell me, even the crowned heads of Castile and Arragon veil low?\"  The monk half rose, with an impatient and almost haughty start, at this interrogatory; but, reseating himself, replied, in a deep and half- whispered voice \"Daughter, listen to me!  It is true, that Isabel of Spain (whom the Mother of Mercy bless! for merciful to all is her secret heart, if not her outward policy)--it is true that Isabel of Spain, fearful that the path to Heaven might be made rougher to thy feet than it well need be (there was a slight accent of irony in the monk's voice as he thus spoke), selected a friar of suasive eloquence and gentle manners to visit thee.  He was charged with letters to yon abbess from the queen. Soft though the friar, he was yet a hypocrite.  Nay, hear me out! he loved to worship the rising sun; and he did not wish always to remain a simple friar, while the Church had higher dignities of this earth to bestow.  In the Christian camp, daughter, there was one who burned for tidings of thee,--whom thine image haunted--who, stern as thou wert to him, loved thee with a love he knew not of, till thou wert lost to him. Why dost thou tremble, daughter? listen, yet!  To that lover, for he was one of high birth, came the monk; to that lover the monk sold his mission.  The monk will have a ready tale, that he was waylaid amidst the mountains by armed men, and robbed of his letters to the abbess.  The lover took his garb, and he took the letters; and he hastened hither. Leila! beloved Leila! behold him at thy feet!\"  The monk raised his cowl; and, dropping on his knee beside her, presented to her gaze the features of the Prince of Spain.  \"You!\" said Leila, averting her countenance, and vainly endeavouring to extricate the hand which he had seized.  \"This is indeed cruel.  You, the author of so many sufferings--such calumny--such reproach!\"  \"I will repair all,\" said Don Juan, fervently.  \"I alone, I repeat it, have the power to set you free.  You are no longer a Jewess; you are one of our faith; there is now no bar upon our loves.  Imperious though my father,--all dark and dread as is this new POWER which he is rashly erecting in his dominions, the heir of two monarchies is not so poor in influence and in friends as to be unable to offer the woman of his love an inviolable shelter alike from priest and despot.  Fly with me!--quit this dreary sepulchre ere the last stone close over thee for ever!  I have horses, I have guards at hand.  This night it can be arranged.  This night--oh, bliss!--thou mayest be rendered up to earth and love!\"  \"Prince,\" said Leila, who had drawn herself from Juan's grasp during this address, and who now stood at a little distance erect and proud, \"you tempt me in vain; or, rather you offer me no temptation.  I have made my choice; I abide by it.\"  \"Oh!  bethink thee,\" said the prince, in a voice of real and imploring anguish; \"bethink thee well of the consequences of thy refusal.  Thou canst not see them yet; thine ardour blinds thee.  But, when hour after hour, day after day, year after year, steals on in the appalling monotony of this sanctified prison; when thou shalt see thy youth--withering without love--thine age without honour; when thy heart shall grow as stone within thee, beneath the looks of you icy spectres; when nothing shall vary the aching dulness of wasted life save a longer fast or a severer penance: then, then will thy grief be rendered tenfold by the despairing and remorseful thought, that thine own lips sealed thine own sentence.  Thou mayest think,\" continued Juan, with rapid eagerness, \"that my love to thee was at first light and dishonouring.  Be it so.  I own that my youth has passed in idle wooings, and the mockeries of affection.  But for the first time in my life I feel that--I love.  Thy dark eyes--thy noble beauty--even thy womanly scorn, have fascinated me. I--never yet disdained where I have been a suitor--acknowledge, at last, that there is a triumph in the conquest of a woman's heart.  Oh, Leila! do not--do not reject me.  You know not how rare and how deep a love you cast away.\"  The novice was touched: the present language of Don Juan was so different from what it had been before; the earnest love that breathed in his voice--that looked from his eyes, struck a chord in her breast; it reminded her of her own unconquered, unconquerable love for the "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9761"],["title","Leila or, the Siege of Granada, Complete (#1)"],["body"," him, Boabdil again turned impatiently round “My soul wants the bath of music,” said he; “these journeys into a pathless realm have wearied it, and the streams of sound supple and relax the travailed pilgrim.”  He clapped his hands, and from one of the arcades a boy, hitherto invisible, started into sight; at a slight and scarce perceptible sign from the king the boy again vanished, and in a few moments afterwards, glancing through the fairy pillars, and by the glittering waterfalls, came the small and twinkling feet of the maids of Araby. As, with their transparent tunics and white arms, they gleamed, without an echo, through that cool and voluptuous chamber, they might well have seemed the Peris of the eastern magic, summoned to beguile the sated leisure of a youthful Solomon. With them came a maiden of more exquisite beauty, though smaller stature, than the rest, bearing the light Moorish lute; and a faint and languid smile broke over the beautiful face of Boabdil, as his eyes rested upon her graceful form and the dark yet glowing lustre of her oriental countenance. She alone approached the king, timidly kissed his hand, and then, joining her comrades, commenced the following song, to the air and very words of which the feet of the dancing-girls kept time, while with the chorus rang the silver bells of the musical instrument which each of the dancers carried.              AMINE’S SONG.          I.         Softly, oh, softly glide,         Gentle Music, thou silver tide,         Bearing, the lulled air along,         This leaf from the Rose of Song!         To its port in his soul let it float,         The frail, but the fragrant boat,         Bear it, soft Air, along!          II.         With the burthen of sound we are laden,         Like the bells on the trees of Aden,*         When they thrill with a tinkling tone         At the Wind from the Holy Throne,         Hark, as we move around,         We shake off the buds of sound;         Thy presence, Beloved, is Aden.          III.         Sweet chime that I hear and wake         I would, for my lov’d one’s sake,         That I were a sound like thee,         To the depths of his heart to flee.         If my breath had his senses blest;         If my voice in his heart could rest;         What pleasure to die like thee!     *[The Mohammedans believe that musical bells hang on the trees of    Paradise, and are put in motion by a wind from the throne of God.]   The music ceased; the dancers remained motionless in their graceful postures, as if arrested into statues of alabaster; and the young songstress cast herself on a cushion at the feet of the monarch, and looked up fondly, but silently, into his yet melancholy eyes,--when a man, whose entrance had not been noticed, was seen to stand within the chamber.  He was about the middle stature,--lean, muscular, and strongly though sparely built. A plain black robe, something in the fashion of the Armenian gown, hung long and loosely over a tunic of bright scarlet, girdled by a broad belt, from the centre of which was suspended a small golden key, while at the left side appeared the jewelled hilt of a crooked dagger. His features were cast in a larger and grander mould than was common among the Moors of Spain; the forehead was broad, massive, and singularly high, and the dark eyes of unusual size and brilliancy; his beard, short, black, and glossy, curled upward, and concealed all the lower part of the face, save a firm, compressed, and resolute expression in the lips, which were large and full; the nose was high, aquiline, and well-shaped; and the whole character of the head (which was, for symmetry, on too large and gigantic a scale as proportioned to the form) was indicative of extraordinary energy and power. At the first glance, the stranger might have seemed scarce on the borders of middle age; but, on a more careful examination, the deep lines and wrinkles, marked on the forehead and round the eyes, betrayed a more advanced period of life. With arms folded on his breast, he stood by the side of the king, waiting in silence the moment when his presence should be perceived.  He did not wait long; the eyes and gesture of the girl nestled at the feet of Boabdil drew the king’s attention to the spot where the stranger stood: his eye brightened when it fell upon him.  “Almamen,” cried Boabdil, eagerly, “you are welcome.” As he spoke, he motioned to the dancing-girls to withdraw. “May I not rest? O core of my heart, thy bird is in its home,” murmured the songstress at the king’s feet.  “Sweet Amine,” answered Boabdil, tenderly smoothing down her ringlets as he bent to kiss her brow, “you should witness only my hours of delight. Toil and business have nought with thee; I will join thee ere yet the nightingale hymns his last music to the moon.” Amine sighed, rose, and vanished with her companions.  “My friend,” said the king, when alone with Almamen, “your counsels often soothe me into quiet, yet in such hours quiet is a crime. But what do?--how struggle?--how act? Alas! at the hour of his birth, rightly did they affix to the name of Boabdil, the epithet of _El Zogoybi_. [The Unlucky]. Misfortune set upon my brow her dark and fated stamp ere yet my lips could shape a prayer against her power. My fierce father, whose frown was as the frown of Azrael, hated me in my cradle; in my youth my name was invoked by rebels against my will; imprisoned by my father, with the poison-bowl or the dagger hourly before my eyes, I was saved only by the artifice of my mother. When age and infirmity broke the iron sceptre of the king, my claims to the throne were set aside, and my uncle, El Zagal, usurped my birthright. Amidst open war and secret treason I wrestled for my crown; and now, the sole sovereign of Granada, when, as I fondly imagined, my uncle had lost all claim on the affections of my people by succumbing to the Christian king, and accepting a fief under his dominion, I find that the very crime of El Zagal is fixed upon me by my unhappy subjects--that they deem he would not have yielded but for my supineness. At the moment of my delivery from my rival, I am received with execration by my subjects, and, driven into this my fortress of the Alhambra, dare not venture to head my armies, or to face my people; yet am I called weak and irresolute, when strength and courage are forbid me. And as the water glides from yonder rock, that hath no power to retain it, I see the tide of empire welling from my hands.”  The young king spoke warmly and bitterly; and, in the irritation of his thoughts, strode, while he spoke, with rapid and irregular strides along the chamber. Almamen marked his emotion with an eye and lip of rigid composure.  “Light of the faithful,” said he, when Boabdil had concluded, “the powers above never doom man to perpetual sorrow, nor perpetual joy: the cloud and the sunshine are alike essential to the heaven of our destinies; and if thou hast suffered in thy youth, thou hast exhausted the calamities of fate, and thy manhood will be glorious, and thine age serene.”  “Thou speakest as if the armies of Ferdinand were not already around my walls,” said Boabdil, impatiently.  “The armies of Sennacherib were as mighty,” answered Almamen.  “Wise seer,” returned the king, in a tone half sarcastic and half solemn, “we, the Mussulmans of Spain, are not the blind fanatics of the Eastern world. On us have fallen the lights of philosophy and science; and if the more clear-sighted among us yet outwardly reverence the forms and fables worshipped by the multitude, it is from the wisdom of policy, not the folly of belief. Talk not to me, then, of thine examples of the ancient and elder creeds: the agents of God for this world are now, at least, in men, not angels; and if I wait till Ferdinand share the destiny of Sennacherib, I wait only till the Standard of the Cross wave above the Vermilion Towers.”  “Yet,” said Almamen, “while my lord the king rejects the fanaticism of belief, doth he reject the fanaticism of persecution? You disbelieve the stories of the Hebrews; yet you suffer the Hebrews themselves, that ancient and kindred Arabian race, to be ground to the dust, condemned and tortured by your judges, your informers, your soldiers, and your subjects.”  “The base misers! they deserve their fate,” answered Boabdil, loftily. “Gold is their god, and the market-place their country; amidst the tears and groans of nations, they sympathise only with the rise and fall of trade; and, the thieves of the universe! while their hand is against every man’s coffer, why wonder that they provoke the hand of every man against their throats? Worse than the tribe of Hanifa, who eat their god only in time of famine;--[The tribe of Hanifa worshipped a lump of dough]--the race of Moisa--[Moses]--would sell the Seven Heavens for the dent on the back of the date-stone.”--[A proverb used in the Koran, signifying the smallest possible trifle].  “Your laws leave them no ambition but that of avarice,” replied Almamen; “and as the plant will crook and distort its trunk, to raise its head through every obstacle to the sun, so the mind of man twists and perverts itself, if legitimate openings are denied it, to find its natural element in the gale of power, or the sunshine of esteem. These Hebrews were not traffickers and misers in their own sacred land when they routed your ancestors, the Arab armies of old; and gnawed the flesh from their bones in famine, rather than yield a weaker city than Granada to a mightier force than the holiday lords of Spain. Let this pass. My lord rejects the belief in the agencies of the angels; doth he still retain belief in the wisdom of mortal men?”  “Yes!” returned Boabdil, quickly; “for of the one I know nought; of the other, mine own senses can be the judge. Almamen, my fiery kinsman, Muza, hath this evening been with me. He hath urged me to reject the fears of my people, which chain my panting spirit within these walls; "]]]
