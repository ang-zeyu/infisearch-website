MEMORIES OF GREEK COURAGE. The most heroic deeds of the Greeks took   place in a great war between the Greek cities and the kingdom of   Persia about five hundred years before Christ. In those days there was   no kingdom called Greece, such as the geographies now describe.   Instead there were cities, a few of which were ruled by kings, others   by the citizens themselves. These cities banded together when any   danger threatened them. Sometimes one city turned traitor and helped   the enemy against the others. The most dangerous enemy the Greeks had,   until the Romans attacked them, was the kingdom of Persia, which   stretched from the Aegean Sea far into Asia. In the war with the   Persians the Greeks fought three famous battles, at Marathon,   Thermopylae, and Salamis, the stories of which men have always liked   to hear and remember.  PREPARING FOR MARATHON, 490 B.C. To the Athenians belong the   glories of Marathon. They lived where the modern city of Athens now   stands. The ruins of their temples and theaters still attract students   and travelers to Greece. The plain of Marathon lay more than twenty   miles to the northeast, and the roads to it led through mountain   passes. When the Athenians heard that the hosts of the Great King of   Persia were approaching, they sent a runner, Pheidippides by name, to   ask aid of Sparta, a city one hundred and forty miles away, in the   peninsula now called the Morea, where dwelt the sturdiest fighters of   Greece. This runner reached Sparta on the second day, but the Spartans   said it would be against their religious custom to march before the   moon was full. The Athenians saw that they must meet the enemy   alone--one small city against a mighty empire. They called their ten   thousand men together and set out. On the way they were joined by a   thousand more, the whole army of the brave little town of Plataea.    [Illustration: GREEK SOLDIERS IN ARMS From a Greek vase of   about the time of the battle of Marathon]  HOW THE ATHENIANS WERE ARMED. Although the Persians had six times   as many soldiers as the Athenians, they were not so well armed for   hand to hand fighting. Their principal weapon was the bow and arrow,   while the Greeks used the lance and a short sword. The Greek soldier   was protected by his bronze helmet, solid across the forehead and over   the nose; by his breastplate, a leathern or linen tunic covered with   small metal scales, with flaps hanging below his hips; and by greaves   or pieces of metal in front of his knees and shins. He was also   protected by a shield, often long enough to reach from his face to his   knees. According to a strange custom the Athenians were led by ten   generals, each commanding one day in turn.  THE BATTLE-GROUND. Marathon was a plain about two miles wide, lying   between the mountains and the sea. From it two roads ran toward   Athens, one along the shore where the hills almost reached the sea,   the other up a narrow valley and over the mountains. The Athenians   were encamped in this valley, where they could attack the Persians if   they tried to follow the shore road.    The Persians landed from their ships and filled the plain near the   shore. They wanted to fight in the open plain because they had so many   more soldiers than the Athenians and because they meant to use their   horsemen. For some time the Athenians watched the Persians, not   knowing what it was best to do. Half the generals did not wish to risk   a battle, but Miltiades was eager to fight, for he feared that delay   would lead timid citizens or traitors to yield to the Persians. He   finally gained his wish, and on his day of command the battle was   ordered.  THE BATTLE. The Persians by this time had decided to sail around to   the harbor of Athens and had taken their horsemen on board their   ships. When they saw the Greeks coming they drew up their   foot-soldiers in deep masses. The Athenians and their comrades--the   Plataeans--soon began to move forward on the run. The Persians thought   this madness, because the Greeks had no archers or horsemen. But the   Greeks saw that if they moved forward slowly the Persians would have   time to shoot arrows at them again and again.    When the Greeks rushed upon the Persians the soldiers at the two ends   of the Persian line gave way and fled towards the shore. In the   center, where the best Persian soldiers stood, the Greeks were not at   first successful, and were forced to retreat. But those who had been   victorious came to their rescue, attacked the Persians in the rear,   and finally drove them off. The Persians ran into the sea to reach the   ships, and the Athenians followed them. Some of the Greeks were so   eager in the fight that they seized the sides of the ships and tried   to keep them from being rowed away, but the Persians cut at their   hands and made them let go.    [Illustration: THE STRAITS OF SALAMIS Where a great sea-fight   between Greeks and Persians took place]  THE NEWS OF THE VICTORY. The Athenians had won a victory of which   they were so proud that they meant it never should be forgotten. Their   city had suddenly become great through the courage and self-sacrifice   of her citizens. One hundred and ninety-two Greeks had fallen, and on   the battle-field their comrades raised over their bodies a mound of   earth which still marks their tomb. The victors sent the runner   Pheidippides to bear the news to Athens. Over the hills he ran until   he reached the market place, and there, with the message of triumph on   his lips, he fell dead.  OTHER VICTORIES OF THE GREEKS. Marathon was only the beginning of   Greek victories over the Persians, only the first struggle in the long   wars between Europe and Asia. Ten years after Marathon the Spartans   won everlasting glory by their heroic stand at the Pass of Thermopylae --three hundred Greeks against the mighty army of the Persian king   Xerxes. The barbarian hordes passed over their bodies, took the road   to Athens, burned the city, but were soon beaten in the sea-fight   which took place on the waters lying between the mainland of Athenian   territory and the island of Salamis. This victory was also due to   Athenian courage and leadership, for the Athenians and their leader,   Themistocles, were resolved to stay and fight, although the other   Greeks wanted to sail away.  WHY MARATHON IS REMEMBERED. The victories of Marathon and Salamis   were great not only because small armies of Greeks put to flight the   hosts of Persia, they were great because they saved the independence   of Greece. If the Greeks had become the subjects and slaves of Persia,   they would not have built the wonderful buildings, or carved the   beautiful statues, or written the books which we study and admire.   When we think of the Greeks as our first teachers we feel as proud of   their victories as if they were our own victories.  THE WARS OF THE GREEK CITIES. The Athenians had done the most in   winning the victory over the Persians, and therefore Athens was for   many years the most powerful city in Greece. The Spartans were always   jealous of the Athenians, and in less than a century after the victory   of Marathon they conquered and humbled Athens. The worst faults of the   Greeks were such jealousies and the desire to lord it over one   another. Greek history is full of wars of city against city, Sparta   against Athens, Corinth against Athens, and Thebes against Sparta. In   these wars many heroic deeds were done, of which we like to read, but   it is more important for us to understand how the Greeks lived.       QUESTIONS      1. What ancient cities still exist?

The Greeks lived in cities so much of the time that   we do not often think of them as ever living in the country. The   reason for this was that their government and everything else   important was carried on in the city. The cities were usually   surrounded by high, thick stone walls, which made them safe from   sudden attack. Within or beside the city there was often a lofty hill,   which we should call a fort or citadel, but which they called the   upper city or acropolis. There the people lived at first when they   were few in number, and thither they fled if the walls of their city   were broken down by enemies.    In Athens such a hill rose two hundred feet above the plain. Its top   was a thousand feet long, and all the sides except one were steep   cliffs.

Here we left the train and took the steam-boat for Philadelphia. In making the change here I again apprehended arrest, but no one disturbed me, and I was soon on the broad and beautiful Delaware, speeding away to the Quaker City. On reaching Philadelphia in the afternoon, I inquired of a colored man how I could get on to New York. He directed me to the William-street depot, and thither I went, taking the train that night. I reached New York Tuesday morning, having completed the journey in less than twenty-four hours.  My free life began on the third of September, 1838. On the morning of the fourth of that month, after an anxious and most perilous but safe journey, I found myself in the big city of New York, a _free man_—one more added to the mighty throng which, like the confused waves of the troubled sea, surged to and fro between the lofty walls of Broadway. Though dazzled with the wonders which met me on every hand, my thoughts could not be much withdrawn from my strange situation. For the moment, the dreams of my youth and the hopes of my manhood were completely fulfilled. The bonds that had held me to “old master” were broken. No man now had a right to call me his slave or assert mastery over me. I was in the rough and tumble of an outdoor world, to take my chance with the rest of its busy number. I have often been asked how I felt when first I found myself on free soil. There is scarcely anything in my experience about which I could not give a more satisfactory answer. A new world had opened upon me. If life is more than breath and the “quick round of blood,” I lived more in that one day than in a year of my slave life. It was a time of joyous excitement which words can but tamely describe. In a letter written to a friend soon after reaching New York, I said: “I felt as one might feel upon escape from a den of hungry lions.” Anguish and grief, like darkness and rain, may be depicted; but gladness and joy, like the rainbow, defy the skill of pen or pencil. During ten or fifteen years I had been, as it were, dragging a heavy chain which no strength of mine could break; I was not only a slave, but a slave for life. I might become a husband, a father, an aged man, but through all, from birth to death, from the cradle to the grave, I had felt myself doomed. All efforts I had previously made to secure my freedom had not only failed, but had seemed only to rivet my fetters the more firmly, and to render my escape more difficult. Baffled, entangled, and discouraged, I had at times asked myself the question, May not my condition after all be God’s work, and ordered for a wise purpose, and if so, Is not submission my duty? A contest had in fact been going on in my mind for a long time, between the clear consciousness of right and the plausible make-shifts of theology and superstition. The one held me an abject slave—a prisoner for life, punished for some transgression in which I had no lot nor part; and the other counseled me to manly endeavor to secure my freedom. This contest was now ended; my chains were broken, and the victory brought me unspeakable joy.  But my gladness was short-lived, for I was not yet out of the reach and power of the slave-holders. I soon found that New York was not quite so free or so safe a refuge as I had supposed, and a sense of loneliness and insecurity again oppressed me most sadly. I chanced to meet on the street, a few hours after my landing, a fugitive slave whom I had once known well in slavery. The information received from him alarmed me. The fugitive in question was known in Baltimore as “Allender’s Jake,” but in New York he wore the more respectable name of “William Dixon.” Jake, in law, was the property of Doctor Allender, and Tolly Allender, the son of the doctor, had once made an effort to recapture _Mr. Dixon_, but had failed for want of evidence to support his claim. Jake told me the circumstances of this attempt, and how narrowly he escaped being sent back to slavery and torture. He told me that New York was then full of Southerners returning from the Northern watering-places; that the colored people of New York were not to be trusted; that there were hired men of my own color who would betray me for a few dollars; that there were hired men ever on the lookout for fugitives; that I must trust no man with my secret; that I must not think of going either upon the wharves or into any colored boarding-house, for all such places were closely watched; that he was himself unable to help me; and, in fact, he seemed while speaking to me to fear lest I myself might be a spy and a betrayer. Under this apprehension, as I suppose, he showed signs of wishing to be rid of me, and with whitewash brush in hand, in search of work, he soon disappeared.  This picture, given by poor “Jake,” of New York, was a damper to my enthusiasm. My little store of money would soon be exhausted, and since it would be unsafe for me to go on the wharves for work, and I had no introductions elsewhere, the prospect for me was far from cheerful. I saw the wisdom of keeping away from the ship-yards, for, if pursued, as I felt certain I should be, Mr. Auld, my “master,” would naturally seek me there among the calkers. Every door seemed closed against me. I was in the midst of an ocean of my fellow-men, and yet a perfect stranger to every one. I was without home, without acquaintance, without money, without credit, without work, and without any definite knowledge as to what course to take, or where to look for succor. In such an extremity, a man had something besides his new-born freedom to think of. While wandering about the streets of New York, and lodging at least one night among the barrels on one of the wharves, I was indeed free—from slavery, but free from food and shelter as well. I kept my secret to myself as long as I could, but I was compelled at last to seek some one who would befriend me without taking advantage of my destitution to betray me. Such a person I found in a sailor named Stuart, a warm-hearted and generous fellow, who, from his humble home on Centre street, saw me standing on the opposite sidewalk, near the Tombs prison. As he approached me, I ventured a remark to him which at once enlisted his interest in me. He took me to his home to spend the night, and in the morning went with me to Mr. David Ruggles, the secretary of the New York Vigilance Committee, a co-worker with Isaac T. Hopper, Lewis and Arthur Tappan, Theodore S. Wright, Samuel Cornish, Thomas Downing, Philip A. Bell, and other true men of their time. All these (save Mr. Bell, who still lives, and is editor and publisher of a paper called the “Elevator,” in San Francisco) have finished their work on earth. Once in the hands of these brave and wise men, I felt comparatively safe. With Mr. Ruggles, on the corner of Lispenard and Church streets, I was hidden several days, during which time my intended wife came on from Baltimore at my call, to share the burdens of life with me. She was a free woman, and came at once on getting the good news of my safety. We were married by Rev. J. W. C. Pennington, then a well-known and respected Presbyterian minister. I had no money with which to pay the marriage fee, but he seemed well pleased with our thanks.  Mr. Ruggles was the first officer on the “Underground Railroad” whom I met after coming North, and was, indeed, the only one with whom I had anything to do till I became such an officer myself. Learning that my trade was that of a calker, he promptly decided that the best place for me was in New Bedford, Mass. He told me that many ships for whaling voyages were fitted out there, and that I might there find work at my trade and make a good living. So, on the day of the marriage ceremony, we took our little luggage to the steamer _John W. Richmond_, which, at that time, was one of the line running between New York and Newport, R. I. Forty-three years ago colored travelers were not permitted in the cabin, nor allowed abaft the paddle-wheels of a steam vessel. They were compelled, whatever the weather might be,—whether cold or hot, wet or dry,—to spend the night on deck. Unjust as this regulation was, it did not trouble us much; we had fared much harder before. We arrived at Newport the next morning, and soon after an old fashioned stage-coach, with “New Bedford” in large yellow letters on its sides, came down to the wharf. I had not money enough to pay our fare, and stood hesitating what to do. Fortunately for us, there were two Quaker gentlemen who were about to take passage on the stage,—Friends William C. Taber and Joseph Ricketson,—who at once discerned our true situation, and, in a peculiarly quiet way, addressing me, Mr. Taber said: “Thee get in.” I never obeyed an order with more alacrity, and we were soon on our way to our new home. When we reached “Stone Bridge” the passengers alighted for breakfast, and paid their fares to the driver. We took no breakfast, and, when asked for our fares, I told the driver I would make it right with him when we reached New Bedford. I expected some objection to this on his part, but he made none. When, however, we reached New Bedford, he took our baggage, including three music-books,—two of them collections by Dyer, and one by Shaw,—and held them until I was able to redeem them by paying to him the amount due for our rides. This was soon done, for Mr. Nathan Johnson not only received me kindly and hospitably, but, on being informed about our baggage, at once loaned me the two dollars with which to square accounts with the stage-driver. Mr. and Mrs. Nathan Johnson reached a good old age, and now rest from their labors. I am under many grateful obligations to them. They not only “took me in when a stranger” and “fed me when hungry,” but taught me how to make an honest living. Thus, in a fortnight after my flight from Maryland, I was safe in New Bedford, a citizen of the grand old commonwealth"]]]
