I've often wondered, myself, why you didn't go back and find that poor Munchkin girl.\"  Then the Tin Woodman stared hard at his friend the Scarecrow. But finally he said in a serious tone of voice:  \"I must admit that never before have I thought of such a thing as finding Nimmie Amee and making her Empress of the Winkies. But it is surely not too late, even now, to do this, for the girl must still be living in the Munchkin Country. And, since this strange Wanderer has reminded me of Nimmie Amee, I believe it is my duty to set out and find her. Surely it is not the girl's fault that I no longer love her, and so, if I can make her happy, it is proper that I should do so, and in this way reward her for her faithfulness.\"  \"Quite right, my friend!\" agreed the Scarecrow.  \"Will you accompany me on this errand?\" asked the Tin Emperor.  \"Of course,\" said the Scarecrow.  \"And will you take me along?\" pleaded Woot the Wanderer in an eager voice.  \"To be sure,\" said the Tin Woodman, \"if you care to join our party. It was you who first told me it was my duty to find and marry Nimmie Amee, and I'd like you to know that Nick Chopper, the Tin Emperor of the Winkies, is a man who never shirks his duty, once it is pointed out to him.\"  \"It ought to be a pleasure, as well as a duty, if the girl is so beautiful,\" said Woot, well pleased with the idea of the adventure.  \"Beautiful things may be admired, if not loved,\" asserted the Tin Man. \"Flowers are beautiful, for instance, but we are not inclined to marry them. Duty, on the contrary, is a bugle call to action, whether you are inclined to act, or not. In this case, I obey the bugle call of duty.\"  \"When shall we start?\" inquired the Scarecrow, who was always glad to embark upon a new adventure. \"I don't hear any bugle, but when do we go?\"  \"As soon as we can get ready,\" answered the Emperor. \"I'll call my servants at once and order them to make preparations for our journey.\"     Chapter Three  Roundabout   Woot the Wanderer slept that night in the tin castle of the Emperor of the Winkies and found his tin bed quite comfortable. Early the next morning he rose and took a walk through the gardens, where there were tin fountains and beds of curious tin flowers, and where tin birds perched upon the branches of tin trees and sang songs that sounded like the notes of tin whistles. All these wonders had been made by the clever Winkie tinsmiths, who wound the birds up every morning so that they would move about and sing.  After breakfast the boy went into the throne room, where the Emperor was having his tin joints carefully oiled by a servant, while other servants were stuffing sweet, fresh straw into the body of the Scarecrow.  Woot watched this operation with much interest, for the Scarecrow's body was only a suit of clothes filled with straw. The coat was buttoned tight to keep the packed straw from falling out and a rope was tied around the waist to hold it in shape and prevent the straw from sagging down. The Scarecrow's head was a gunnysack filled with bran, on which the eyes, nose and mouth had been painted. His hands were white cotton gloves stuffed with fine straw. Woot noticed that even when carefully stuffed and patted into shape, the straw man was awkward in his movements and decidedly wobbly on his feet, so the boy wondered if the Scarecrow would be able to travel with them all the way to the forests of the Munchkin Country of Oz.  The preparations made for this important journey were very simple. A knapsack was filled with food and given Woot the Wanderer to carry upon his back, for the food was for his use alone. The Tin Woodman shouldered an axe which was sharp and brightly polished, and the Scarecrow put the Emperor's oil-can in his pocket, that he might oil his friend's joints should they need it.  \"Who will govern the Winkie Country during your absence?\" asked the boy.  \"Why, the Country will run itself,\" answered the Emperor. \"As a matter of fact, my people do not need an Emperor, for Ozma of Oz watches over the welfare of all her subjects, including the Winkies. Like a good many kings and emperors, I have a grand title, but very little real power, which allows me time to amuse myself in my own way. The people of Oz have but one law to obey, which is: 'Behave Yourself,' so it is easy for them to abide by this Law, and you'll notice they behave very well. But it is time for us to be off, and I am eager to start because I suppose that that poor Munchkin girl is anxiously awaiting my coming.\"  \"She's waited a long time already, seems to me,\" remarked the Scarecrow, as they left the grounds of the castle and followed a path that led eastward.  \"True,\" replied the Tin Woodman; \"but I've noticed that the last end of a wait, however long it has been, is the hardest to endure; so I must try to make Nimmie Amee happy as soon as possible.\"  \"Ah; that proves you have a Kind heart,\" remarked the Scarecrow, approvingly.  \"It's too bad he hasn't a Loving Heart,\" said Woot. \"This Tin Man is going to marry a nice girl through kindness, and not because he loves her, and somehow that doesn't seem quite right.\"  \"Even so, I am not sure it isn't best for the girl,\" said the Scarecrow, who seemed very intelligent for a straw man, \"for a loving husband is not always kind, while a kind husband is sure to make any girl content.\"  \"Nimmie Amee will become an Empress!\" announced the Tin Woodman, proudly. \"I shall have a tin gown made for her, with tin ruffles and tucks on it, and she shall have tin slippers, and tin earrings and bracelets, and wear a tin crown on her head. I am sure that will delight Nimmie Amee, for all girls are fond of finery.\"  \"Are we going to the Munchkin Country by way of the Emerald City?\" inquired the Scarecrow, who looked upon the Tin Woodman as the leader of the party.  \"I think not,\" was the reply. \"We are engaged upon a rather delicate adventure, for we are seeking a girl who fears her former lover has forgotten her. It will be rather hard for me, you must admit, when I confess to Nimmie Amee that I have come to marry her because it is my duty to do so, and therefore the fewer witnesses there are to our meeting the better for both of us. After I have found Nimmie Amee and she has managed to control her joy at our reunion, I shall take her to the Emerald City and introduce her to Ozma and Dorothy, and to Betsy Bobbin and Tiny Trot, and all our other friends; but, if I remember rightly, poor Nimmie Amee has a sharp tongue when angry, and she may be a trifle angry with me, at first, because I have been so long in coming to her.\"  \"I can understand that,\" said Woot gravely. \"But how can we get to that part of the Munchkin Country where you once lived without passing through the Emerald City?\"  \"Why, that is easy,\" the Tin Man assured him.  \"I have a map of Oz in my pocket,\" persisted the boy, \"and it shows that the Winkie Country, where we now are, is at the west of Oz, and the Munchkin Country at the east, while directly between them lies the Emerald City.\"  \"True enough; but we shall go toward the north, first of all, into the Gillikin Country, and so pass around the Emerald City,\" explained the Tin Woodman.  \"That may prove a dangerous journey,\" replied the boy. \"I used to live in one of the top corners of the Gillikin Country, near to Oogaboo, and I have been told that in this northland country are many people whom it is not pleasant to meet. I was very careful to avoid them during my journey south.\"  \"A Wanderer should have no fear,\" observed the Scarecrow, who was wobbling along in a funny, haphazard manner, but keeping pace with his friends.  \"Fear does not make one a coward,\" returned Woot, growing a little red in the face, \"but I believe it is more easy to avoid danger than to overcome it. The safest way is the best way, even for one who is brave and determined.\"  \"Do not worry, for we shall not go far to the north,\" said the Emperor. \"My one idea is to avoid the Emerald City without going out of our way more than is necessary. Once around the Emerald City we will turn south into the Munchkin Country, where the Scarecrow and I are well acquainted and have many friends.\"  \"I have traveled some in the Gillikin Country,\" remarked the Scarecrow, \"and while I must say I have met some strange people there at times, I have never yet been harmed by them.\"  \"Well, it's all the same to me,\" said Woot, with assumed carelessness. \"Dangers, when they cannot be avoided, are often quite interesting, and I am willing to go wherever you two venture to go.\"  So they left the path they had been following and began to travel toward the northeast, and all that day they were in the pleasant Winkie Country, and all the people they met saluted the Emperor with great respect and wished him good luck on his journey. At night they stopped at a house where they were well entertained and where Woot was given a comfortable bed to sleep in.  \"Were the Scarecrow and I alone,\" said the Tin Woodman, \"we would travel by night as well as by day; but with a meat person in our party, we must halt at night to permit him to rest.\"  \"Meat tires, after a day's travel,\" added the Scarecrow, \"while straw and tin never tire at all. Which proves,\" said he, \"that we are somewhat superior to people made in the common way.\"  Woot could not deny that he was tired, and he slept soundly until morning, when he was given a good breakfast, smoking hot.  \"You two miss a great deal by not eating,\" he said to his companions.  \"It is true,\" responded the Scarecrow. \"We miss suffering from hunger, when food cannot be had, and we miss a stomachache, now and then.\"  As he said this, the Scarecrow glanced at the Tin Woodman, who nodded his assent.  All that second day they traveled steadily, entertaining one another the while with stories of adventures they had formerly met and listening to the Scarecrow recite poetry.

And my mother was always crying now, over (though I did not know it) the luckiest chance which had ever befallen her; and that made me cry too, without understanding exactly why.  So the child, that then was I, procured a pencil and a bit of wrapping-paper, and began to write laboriously:  \"DEAR LORD  \"You know that Papa died and please comfort Mama and give Father a crown of Glory Ammen  \"Your lamb and very sincerely yours  \"ROBERT ETHERIDGE TOWNSEND.\"  This appeared to the point as I re-read it, and of course God would understand that children were not expected to write quite as straight across the paper as grown people. The one problem was how to deliver this, my first letter, most expeditiously, because when your mother cried you always cried too, and couldn't stop, not even when you wanted to, not even when she promised you five cents, and it all made you horribly uncomfortable.  I knew that the big Bible on the parlor table was God's book. Probably God read it very often, since anybody would be proud of having written a book as big as that and would want to look at it every day. So I tiptoed into the darkened parlor. I use the word advisedly, for there was not at this period any drawing-room in Lichfield, and besides, a drawing-room is an entirely different matter.  Everywhere the room was cool, and, since the shades were down, the outlines of the room's contents were uncomfortably dubious; for just where the table stood had been, five days ago, a big and oddly-shaped black box with beautiful silver handles; and Uncle George had lifted me so that I could see through the pane of glass, which was a part of this funny box, while an infinity of decorous people rustled and whispered....  I remember knowing they were \"company\" and thinking they coughed and sniffed because they were sorry that my father was dead. In the light of knowledge latterly acquired, I attribute these actions to the then prevalent weather, for even now I recall how stiflingly the room smelt of flowers--particularly of magnolia blossoms--and of rubber and of wet umbrellas. For my own part, I was not at all sorry, though of course I pretended to be, since I had always known that as a rule my father whipped me because he had just quarreled with my mother, and that he then enjoyed whipping me.  I desired, in fine, that he should stay dead and possess his crown of glory in Heaven, which was reassuringly remote, and that my mother should stop crying. So I slipped my note into the Apocrypha....  I felt that somewhere in the room was God and that God was watching me, but I was not afraid. Yet I entertained, in common with most children, a nebulous distrust of this mysterious Person, a distrust of which I was particularly conscious on winter nights when the gas had been turned down to a blue fleck, and the shadow of the mantelpiece flickered and plunged on the ceiling, and the clock ticked louder and louder, in prediction (I suspected) of some terrible event very close at hand.  Then you remembered such unpleasant matters as Elisha and his bears, and those poor Egyptian children who had never even spoken to Moses, and that uncomfortably abstemious lady, in the fat blue-covered _Arabian Nights_, who ate nothing but rice, grain by grain--in the daytime.... And you called Mammy, and said you were very thirsty and wanted a glass of water, please.  To-day, though, while acutely conscious of that awful inspection, and painstakingly careful not to look behind me, I was not, after all, precisely afraid. If God were a bit like other people I knew He would say, \"What an odd child!\" and I liked to have people say that. Still, there was sunlight in the hall, and lots of sunlight, not just long and dusty shreds of sunlight, and I felt more comfortable when I was back in the hall.   2--_Reading_  I lay flat upon my stomach, having found that posture most conformable to the practice of reading, and I considered the cover of this slim, green book; the name of John Charteris, stamped thereon in fat-bellied letters of gold, meant less to me than it was destined to signify thereafter.  A deal of puzzling matter I found in this book, but in my memory, always, one fantastic passage clung as a burr to sheep's wool. That fable, too, meant less to me than it was destined to signify thereafter, when the author of it was used to declare that he had, unwittingly, written it about me. Then I read again this  _Fable of the Foolish Prince_  \"As to all earlier happenings I choose in this place to be silent. Anterior adventures he had known of the right princely sort. But concerning his traffic with Schamir, the chief talisman, and how through its aid he won to the Sun's Sister for a little while; and concerning his dealings with the handsome Troll-wife (in which affair the cat he bribed with butter and the elm-tree he had decked with ribbons helped him); and with that beautiful and dire Thuringian woman whose soul was a red mouse: we have in this place naught to do. Besides, the Foolish Prince had put aside such commerce when the Fairy came to guide him; so he, at least, could not in equity have grudged the same privilege to his historian.  \"Thus, the Fairy leading, the Foolish Prince went skipping along his father's highway. But the road was bordered by so many wonders--as here a bright pebble and there an anemone, say, and, just beyond, a brook which babbled an entreaty to be tasted,--that many folk had presently overtaken and had passed the loitering Foolish Prince. First came a grandee, supine in his gilded coach, with half-shut eyes, uneagerly meditant upon yesterday's statecraft or to-morrow's gallantry; and now three yokels, with ruddy cheeks and much dust upon their shoulders; now a haggard man in black, who constantly glanced backward; and now a corporal with an empty sleeve, who whistled as he went.  \"A butterfly guided every man of them along the highway. 'For the Lord of the Fields is a whimsical person,' said the Fairy,' and such is his very old enactment concerning the passage even of his cowpath; but princes each in his day and in his way may trample this domain as prompt their will and skill.'  \"'That now is excellent hearing,' said the Foolish Prince; and he strutted.  \"'Look you,' said the Fairy, 'a man does not often stumble and break his shins in the highway, but rather in the byway.'....  \"Thus, the Fairy leading, the Foolish Prince went skipping on his allotted journey, though he paused once in a while to shake his bauble at the staring sun.  \"'The stars,' he considered, 'are more sympathetic....  \"And thus, the Fairy leading, they came at last to a tall hedge wherein were a hundred wickets, all being closed; and those who had passed the Foolish Prince disputed before the hedge and measured the hundred wickets with thirty-nine articles and with a variety of instruments, and each man entered at his chosen wicket, and a butterfly went before him; but no man returned into the open country.  \"'Now beyond each wicket,' said the Fairy, 'lies a great crucible, and by ninety and nine of these crucibles is a man consumed, or else transmuted into this animal or that animal. For such is the law in these parts and in human hearts.'  \"The Prince demanded how if one found by chance the hundredth wicket? But she shook her head and said that none of the Tylwydd Teg was permitted to enter the Disenchanted Garden. Rumor had it that within the Garden, beyond the crucibles, was a Tree, but whether the fruit of this Tree were sweet or bitter no person in the Fields could tell, nor did the Fairy pretend to know what happened in the Garden.  \"'Then why, in heaven's name, need a man test any of these wickets?' cried the Foolish Prince; 'with so much to lose and, it may be, nothing to gain? For one, I shall enter none of them.'  \"But once more she shook"]]]
