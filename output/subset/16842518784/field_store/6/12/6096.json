Githa sate alone, bowing her face over her hands--desolate; mourning for the fate of her traitor son; and the wounds, that the recent and holier death of Thyra had inflicted, bled afresh.  And the holy lady of Edward attempted in vain, by pious adjurations, to comfort Aldyth, who, scarcely heeding her, started ever and anon with impatient terror, muttering to herself, \"Shall I lose this crown too?\"  In the council-hall debate waxed warm,--which was the wiser, to meet William at once in the battle-field, or to delay till all the forces Harold might expect (and which he had ordered to be levied, in his rapid march from York) could swell his host?  \"If we retire before the enemy,\" said Gurth, \"leaving him in a strange land, winter approaching, his forage will fail.  He will scarce dare to march upon London: if he does, we shall be better prepared to encounter him.  My voice is against resting all on a single battle.\"  \"Is that thy choice?\" said Vebba, indignantly.  \"Not so, I am sure, would have chosen thy father; not so think the Saxons of Kent.  The Norman is laying waste all the lands of thy subjects, Lord Harold; living on plunder, as a robber, in the realm of King Alfred.  Dost thou think that men will get better heart to fight for their country by hearing that their King shrinks from the danger?\"  \"Thou speakest well and wisely,\" said Haco; and all eyes turned to the young son of Sweyn, as to one who best knew the character of the hostile army and the skill of its chief.  \"We have now with us a force flushed with conquest over a foe hitherto deemed invincible.  Men who have conquered the Norwegian will not shrink from the Norman.  Victory depends upon ardour more than numbers.  Every hour of delay damps the ardour.  Are we sure that it will swell the numbers?  What I dread most is not the sword of the Norman Duke, it is his craft.  Rely upon it, that if we meet him not soon, he will march straight to London. He will proclaim by the way that he comes not to seize the throne, but to punish Harold, and abide by the Witan, or, perchance, by the word of the Roman pontiff.  The terror of his armament, unresisted, will spread like a panic through the land.  Many will be decoyed by his false pretexts, many awed by a force that the King dare not meet.  If he come in sight of the city, think you that merchants and cheapmen will not be daunted by the thought of pillage and sack?  They will be the first to capitulate at the first house which is fired.  The city is weak to guard against siege; its walls long neglected; and in sieges the Normans are famous.  Are we so united (the King's rule thus fresh) but what no cabals, no dissensions will break out amongst ourselves?  If the Duke come, as come he will, in the name of the Church, may not the Churchmen set up some new pretender to the crown-- perchance the child Edgar?  And, divided against ourselves, how ingloriously should we fall!  Besides, this land, though never before have the links between province and province been drawn so close, hath yet demarcations that make the people selfish.  The Northumbrians, I fear, will not stir to aid London, and Mercia will hold aloof from our peril.  Grant that William once seize London, all England is broken up and dispirited; each shire, nay, each town, looking only to itself. Talk of delay as wearing out the strength of the foe!  No, it would wear out our own.  Little eno', I fear, is yet left in our treasury. If William seize London, that treasury is his, with all the wealth of our burgesses.  How should we maintain an army, except by preying on the people, and thus discontenting them?  Where guard that army? Where are our forts? where our mountains?  The war of delay suits only a land of rock and defile, or of castle and breast-work.  Thegns and warriors, ye have no castles but your breasts of mail.  Abandon these, and you are lost.\"  A general murmur of applause closed this speech of Haco, which, while wise in arguments our historians have overlooked, came home to that noblest reason of brave men, which urges prompt resistance to foul invasion.  Up, then, rose King Harold.  \"I thank you, fellow-Englishmen, for that applause with which ye have greeted mine own thoughts on the lips of Haco.  Shall it be said that your King rushed to chase his own brother from the soil of outraged England, yet shrunk from the sword of the Norman stranger?  Well indeed might my brave subjects desert my banner if it floated idly over these palace walls while the armed invader pitched his camp in the heart of England.  By delay, William's force, whatever it might be, cannot grow less; his cause grows more strong in our craven fears. What his armament may be we rightly know not; the report varies with every messenger, swelling and lessening with the rumours of every hour.  Have we not around us now our most stalwart veterans--the flower of our armies--the most eager spirits--the vanquishers of Hardrada?  Thou sayest, Gurth, that all should not be perilled on a single battle.  True.  Harold should be perilled, but wherefore England?  Grant that we win the day; the quicker our despatch, the greater our fame, the more lasting that peace at home and abroad which rests ever its best foundation on the sense of the power which wrong cannot provoke unchastised.  Grant that we lose; a loss can be made gain by a king's brave death.  Why should not our example rouse and unite all who survive us?  Which the nobler example--the one best fitted to protect our country--the recreant backs of living chiefs, or the glorious dead with their fronts to the foe?  Come what may, life or death, at least we will thin the Norman numbers, and heap the barriers of our corpses on the Norman march.  At least, we can show to the rest of England how men should defend their native land!  And if, as I believe and pray, in every English breast beats a heart like Harold's, what matters though a king should fall?--Freedom is immortal.\"  He spoke; and forth from his baldric he drew his sword.  Every blade, at that signal, leapt from the sheath: and, in that council-hall at least, in every breast beat the heart of Harold.     CHAPTER III.   The chiefs dispersed to array their troops for the morrow's march; but Harold and his kinsmen entered the chamber where the women waited the decision of the council, for that, in truth, was to them the parting interview.  The King had resolved, after completing all his martial preparations, to pass the night in the Abbey of Waltham; and his brothers lodged, with the troops they commanded, in the city or its suburbs.  Haco alone remained with that portion of the army quartered in and around the palace.  They entered the chamber, and in a moment each heart had sought its mate; in the mixed assembly each only conscious of the other.  There, Gurth bowed his noble head over the weeping face of the young bride that for the last time nestled to his bosom.  There, with a smiling lip, but tremulous voice, the gay Leofwine soothed and chided in a breath the maiden he had wooed as the partner for a life that his mirthful spirit made one holiday; snatching kisses from a cheek no longer coy.  But cold was the kiss which Harold pressed on the brow of Aldyth; and with something of disdain, and of bitter remembrance of a nobler love, he comforted a terror which sprang from the thought of self.  \"Oh, Harold!\" sobbed Aldyth, \"be not rashly brave: guard thy life for my sake.  Without thee, what am I?  Is it even safe for me to rest here?  Were it not better to fly to York, or seek refuge with Malcolm the Scot?\"  \"Within three days at the farthest,\" answered Harold, \"thy brothers will be in London.  Abide by their counsel; act as they advise at the news of my victory or my fall.\"  He paused abruptly, for he heard close beside him the broken voice of Gurth's bride, in answer to her lord.  \"Think not of me, beloved; thy whole heart now be England's.  And if--if\"--her voice failed a moment, but resumed proudly, \"why even then thy wife is safe, for she survives not her lord and her land!\"  The King left his wife's side, and kissed his brother's bride.  \"Noble heart!\" he said; \"with women like thee for our wives and mothers, England could survive the slaughter of thousand kings.\"  He turned, and knelt to Githa.  She threw her arms over his broad breast, and wept bitterly.  \"Say--say, Harold, that I have not reproached thee for Tostig's death. I have obeyed the last commands of Godwin my lord.  I have deemed thee ever right and just; now let me not lose thee, too.  They go with thee, all my surviving sons, save the exile Wolnoth,--him whom now I shall never behold again.  Oh, Harold!--let not mine old age be childless!\"  \"Mother,--dear, dear mother, with these arms round my neck I take new life and new heart.  No! never hast thou reproached me for my brother's death--never for aught which man's first duty enjoined. Murmur not that that duty commands us still.  We are the sons, through thee, of royal heroes; through my father, of Saxon freemen.  Rejoice that thou hast three sons left, whose arms thou mayest pray God and his saints to prosper, and over whose graves, if they fall, thou shalt shed no tears of shame!\"  Then the widow of King Edward, who (the crucifix clasped in her hands) had listened to Harold with lips apart and marble cheeks, could keep down no longer her human woman's heart; she rushed to Harold as he still knelt to Githa--knelt by his side, and clasped him in her arms with despairing fondness:  \"O brother, brother, whom I have so dearly loved when all other love seemed forbidden me;--when he who gave me a throne refused me his heart; when, looking at thy fair promise, listening to thy tender comfort,--when, remembering the days of old, in which thou wert my docile pupil, and we dreamed bright dreams together of happiness and fame to come,--when, loving thee methought too well, too much as weak mothers may love a"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7683"],["title","Harold : the Last of the Saxon Kings — Volume 12 (#2)"],["body","son, I prayed God to detach my heart from earth!--Oh, Harold! now forgive me all my coldness.  I shudder at thy resolve.  I dread that thou should meet this man, whom an oath hath bound thee to obey.  Nay, frown not--I bow to thy will, my brother and my King.  I know that thou hast chosen as thy conscience sanctions, as thy duty ordains.  But come back--Oh, come back--thou who, like me,\" (her voice whispered,) \"hast sacrificed the household hearth to thy country's altars,--and I will never pray to Heaven to love thee less-- my brother, O my brother!\"  In all the room were then heard but the low sounds of sobs and broken exclamations.  All clustered to one spot-Leofwine and his betrothed-- Gurth and his bride--even the selfish Aldyth, ennobled by the contagion of the sublime emotion,--all clustered round Githa the mother of the three guardians of the fated land, and all knelt before her, by the side of Harold.  Suddenly, the widowed Queen, the virgin wife of the last heir of Cerdic, rose, and holding on high the sacred rood over those bended heads, said, with devout passion:  \"O Lord of Hosts--We Children of Doubt and Time, trembling in the dark, dare not take to ourselves to question thine unerring will. Sorrow and death, as joy and life, are at the breath of a mercy divine, and a wisdom all-seeing: and out of the hours of evil thou drawest, in mystic circle, the eternity of Good.  'Thy will be done on earth, as it is in heaven.'  If, O Disposer of events, our human prayers are not adverse to thy pre-judged decrees, protect these lives, the bulwarks of our homes and altars, sons whom the land offers as a sacrifice.  May thine angel turn aside the blade--as of old from the heart of Isaac!  But if, O Ruler of Nations, in whose sight the ages are as moments, and generations but as sands in the sea, these lives are doomed, may the death expiate their sins, and, shrived on the battle-field, absolve and receive the souls!\"     CHAPTER IV.   By the altar of the Abbey Church of Waltham, that night, knelt Edith in prayer for Harold.  She had taken up her abode in a small convent of nuns that adjoined the more famous monastery of Waltham; but she had promised Hilda not to enter on the novitiate, until the birthday of Harold had passed. She herself had no longer faith in the omens and prophecies that had deceived her youth and darkened her life; and, in the more congenial air of our Holy Church, the spirit, ever so chastened, grew calm and resigned.  But the tidings of the Norman's coming, and the King's victorious return to his capital, had reached even that still retreat; and love, which had blent itself with religion, led her steps to that lonely altar.  And suddenly, as she there knelt, only lighted by the moon through the high casements, she was startled by the sound of approaching feet and murmuring voices.  She rose in alarm--the door of the church was thrown open--torches advanced--and amongst the monks, between Osgood and Ailred, came the King.  He had come, that last night before his march, to invoke the prayers of that pious brotherhood; and by the altar he had founded, to pray, himself, that his one sin of faith forfeited and oath abjured, might not palsy his arm and weigh on his soul in the hour of his country's need.  Edith stifled the cry that rose to her lips, as the torches fell on the pale and hushed and melancholy face of Harold; and she crept away under the arch of the vast Saxon columns, and into the shade of abutting walls.  The monks and the King, intent on their holy office, beheld not that solitary and shrinking form.  They approached the altar; and there the King knelt down lowlily, and none heard the prayer.  But as Osgood held the sacred rood over the bended head of the royal suppliant, the Image on the crucifix (which had been a gift from Alred the prelate, and was supposed to have belonged of old to Augustine, the first founder of the Saxon Church--so that, by the superstition of the age, it was invested with miraculous virtues) bowed itself visibly.  Visibly, the pale and ghastly image of the suffering God bowed over the head of the kneeling man; whether the fastenings of the rood were loosened, or from what cause soever,--in the eyes of all the brotherhood, the Image bowed. [254]  A thrill of terror froze every heart, save Edith's, too remote to perceive the portent, and save the King's, whom the omen seemed to doom, for his face was buried in his clasped hands.  Heavy was his heart, nor needed it other warnings than its own gloom.  Long and silently prayed the King; and when at last he rose, and the monks, though with altered and tremulous voices, began their closing hymn, Edith passed noislessly along the wall, and, stealing through one of the smaller doors which communicated to the nunnery annexed, gained the solitude of her own chamber.  There she stood, benumbed with the strength of her emotions at the sight of Harold thus abruptly presented.  How had the fond human heart leapt to meet him!  Twice, thus, in the august ceremonials of Religion, secret, shrinking, unwitnessed, had she, his betrothed, she, the partner of his soul, stood aloof to behold him.  She had seen him in the hour of his pomp, the crown upon his brow,--seen him in the hour of his peril and agony, that anointed head bowed to the earth.  And in the pomp that she could not share, she had exulted; but, oh, now--now,--oh now that she could have knelt beside that humbled form, and prayed with that voiceless prayer!  The torches flashed in the court below; the church was again deserted; the monks passed in mute procession back to their cloister; but a single man paused, turned aside, and stopped at the gate of the humbler convent: a knocking was heard at the great oaken door, and the watch-dog barked.  Edith started, pressed her hand on her heart and trembled.  Steps approached her door--and the abbess, entering, summoned her below, to hear the farewell greeting of her cousin the King.  Harold stood in the simple hall of the cloister: a single taper, tall and wan, burned on the oak board.  The abbess led Edith by the hand, and at a sign from the King, withdrew.  So, once more upon earth, the betrothed and divided were alone.  \"Edith,\" said the King, in a voice in which no ear but hers could have detected the struggle, \"do not think I have come to disturb thy holy calm, or sinfully revive the memories of the irrevocable past: where once on my breast, in the old fashion of our fathers, I wrote thy name, is written now the name of the mistress that supplants thee. Into Eternity melts the Past; but I could not depart to a field from which there is no retreat--in which, against odds that men say are fearful, I have resolved to set my crown and my life--without once more beholding thee, pure guardian of my happier days!  Thy forgiveness for all the sorrow that, in the darkness which surrounds man's hopes and dreams, I have brought on thee (dread return for love so enduring, so generous and divine!)--thy forgiveness I will not ask. Thou alone perhaps on earth knowest the soul of Harold; and if he hath wronged thee, thou seest alike in the wronger and the wronged, but the children of iron Duty, the servants of imperial Heaven.  Not thy forgivenness I ask--but--but--Edith, holy maid! angel soul!--thy--thy blessing!\"  His voice faltered, and he inclined his lofty head as to a saint.  \"Oh that I had the power to bless!\" exclaimed Edith, mastering her rush of tears with a heroic effort; \"and methinks I have the power-- not from virtues of my own, but from all that I owe to thee!  The grateful have the power to bless.  For what do I not owe to thee--owe to that very love of which even the grief is sacred?  Poor child in the house of the heathen, thy love descended upon me, and in it, the smile of God!  In that love my spirit awoke, and was baptised: every thought that has risen from earth, and lost itself in heaven, was breathed into my heart by thee!  Thy creature and thy slave, hadst thou tempted me to sin, sin had seemed hallowed by thy voice; but thou saidst 'True love is virtue,' and so I worshipped virtue in loving thee.  Strengthened, purified, by thy bright companionship, from thee came the strength to resign thee--from thee the refuge under the wings of God--from thee the firm assurance that our union yet shall be--not as our poor Hilda dreams, on the perishable earth,--but there! oh, there! yonder by the celestial altars, in the land in which all spirits are filled with love.  Yes, soul of Harold! there are might and holiness in the blessing the soul thou hast redeemed and reared sheds on thee!\"  And so beautiful, so unlike the Beautiful of the common earth, looked the maid as she thus spoke, and laid hands, trembling with no human passion, on that royal head-that could a soul from paradise be made visible, such might be the shape it would wear to a mortal's eye! Thus, for some moments both were silent; and in the silence the gloom vanished from the heart of Harold, and, through a deep and sublime serenity, it rose undaunted to front the future.  No embrace--no farewell kiss--profaned the parting of those pure and noble spirits--parting on the threshold of the grave.  It was only the spirit that clasped the spirit, looking forth from the clay into measureless eternity.  Not till the air of night came once more on his brow, and the moonlight rested on the roofs and fanes of the land entrusted to his charge, was the man once more the human hero; not till she was alone in her desolate chamber, and the terrors of the coming battle-field chased the angel from her thoughts was the maid inspired, once more the weeping woman.  A little after sunrise the abbess, who was distantly akin to the house of Godwin, sought Edith, so agitated by her own fear, that she did not remark the trouble of her visitor.  The supposed miracle of the sacred Image bowing over the kneeling King, had spread dismay through the cloisters of both nunnery"]]]
