Within five miles of Fort Henry I can show you where the laurel bushes grow three feet high over the ashes of two settlements, and many a clearing where some unfortunate pioneer had staked his claim and thrown up a log cabin, only to die fighting for his wife and children. Between here and Fort Pitt there is only one settlement, Yellow Creek, and most of its inhabitants are survivors of abandoned villages farther up the river. Last summer we had the Moravian Massacre, the blackest, most inhuman deed ever committed. Since then Simon Girty and his bloody redskins have lain low.\"  \"You must always have had a big force,\" said Sheppard.  \"We've managed always to be strong enough, though there never were a large number of men here. During the last siege I had only forty in the fort, counting men, women and boys. But I had pioneers and women who could handle a rifle, and the best bordermen on the frontier.\"  \"Do you make a distinction between pioneers and bordermen?\" asked Sheppard.  \"Indeed, yes. I am a pioneer; a borderman is an Indian hunter, or scout. For years my cabins housed Andrew Zane, Sam and John McCollock, Bill Metzar, and John and Martin Wetzel, all of whom are dead. Not one saved his scalp. Fort Henry is growing; it has pioneers, rivermen, soldiers, but only two bordermen. Wetzel and Jonathan are the only ones we have left of those great men.\"  \"They must be old,\" mused Helen, with a dreamy glow still in her eyes.  \"Well, Miss Helen, not in years, as you mean. Life here is old in experience; few pioneers, and no bordermen, live to a great age. Wetzel is about forty, and my brother Jonathan still a young man; but both are old in border lore.\"  Earnestly, as a man who loves his subject, Colonel Zane told his listeners of these two most prominent characters of the border. Sixteen years previously, when but boys in years, they had cast in their lot with his, and journeyed over the Virginian Mountains, Wetzel to devote his life to the vengeful calling he had chosen, and Jonathan to give rein to an adventurous spirit and love of the wilds. By some wonderful chance, by cunning, woodcraft, or daring, both men had lived through the years of border warfare which had brought to a close the careers of all their contemporaries.  For many years Wetzel preferred solitude to companionship; he roamed the wilderness in pursuit of Indians, his life-long foes, and seldom appeared at the settlement except to bring news of an intended raid of the savages. Jonathan also spent much time alone in the woods, or scouting along the river. But of late years a friendship had ripened between the two bordermen. Mutual interest had brought them together on the trail of a noted renegade, and when, after many long days of patient watching and persistent tracking, the outlaw paid an awful penalty for his bloody deeds, these lone and silent men were friends.  Powerful in build, fleet as deer, fearless and tireless, Wetzel's peculiar bloodhound sagacity, ferocity, and implacability, balanced by Jonathan's keen intelligence and judgment caused these bordermen to become the bane of redmen and renegades. Their fame increased with each succeeding summer, until now the people of the settlement looked upon wonderful deeds of strength and of woodcraft as a matter of course, rejoicing in the power and skill with which these men were endowed.  By common consent the pioneers attributed any mysterious deed, from the finding of a fat turkey on a cabin doorstep, to the discovery of a savage scalped and pulled from his ambush near a settler's spring, to Wetzel and Jonathan. All the more did they feel sure of this conclusion because the bordermen never spoke of their deeds. Sometimes a pioneer living on the outskirts of the settlement would be awakened in the morning by a single rifle shot, and on peering out would see a dead Indian lying almost across his doorstep, while beyond, in the dim, gray mist, a tall figure stealing away. Often in the twilight on a summer evening, while fondling his children and enjoying his smoke after a hard day's labor in the fields, this same settler would see the tall, dark figure of Jonathan Zane step noiselessly out of a thicket, and learn that he must take his family and flee at once to the fort for safety. When a settler was murdered, his children carried into captivity by Indians, and the wife given over to the power of some brutal renegade, tragedies wofully frequent on the border, Wetzel and Jonathan took the trail alone. Many a white woman was returned alive and, sometimes, unharmed to her relatives; more than one maiden lived to be captured, rescued, and returned to her lover, while almost numberless were the bones of brutal redmen lying in the deep and gloomy woods, or bleaching on the plains, silent, ghastly reminders of the stern justice meted out by these two heroes.  \"Such are my two bordermen, Miss Sheppard. The fort there, and all these cabins, would be only black ashes, save for them, and as for us, our wives and children--God only knows.\"  \"Haven't they wives and children, too?\" asked Helen.  \"No,\" answered Colonel Zane, with his genial smile. \"Such joys are not for bordermen.\"  \"Why not? Fine men like them deserve happiness,\" declared Helen.  \"It is necessary we have such,\" said the colonel simply, \"and they cannot be bordermen unless free as the air blows. Wetzel and Jonathan have never had sweethearts. I believe Wetzel loved a lass once; but he was an Indian-killer whose hands were red with blood. He silenced his heart, and kept to his chosen, lonely life. Jonathan does not seem to realize that women exist to charm, to please, to be loved and married. Once we twitted him about his brothers doing their duty by the border, whereupon he flashed out: 'My life is the border's: my sweetheart is the North Star!'\"  Helen dreamily watched the dancing, dimpling waves that broke on the stones of the river shore. All unconscious of the powerful impression the colonel's recital had made upon her, she was feeling the greatness of the lives of these bordermen, and the glory it would now be for her to share with others the pride in their protection.  \"Say, Sheppard, look here,\" said Colonel Zane, on the return to his cabin, \"that girl of yours has a pair of eyes. I can't forget the way they flashed! They'll cause more trouble here among my garrison than would a swarm of redskins.\"  \"No! You don't mean it! Out here in this wilderness?\" queried Sheppard doubtfully.  \"Well, I do.\"  \"O Lord! What a time I've had with that girl! There was one man especially, back home, who made our lives miserable. He was rich and well born; but Helen would have none of him. He got around me, old fool that I am! Practically stole what was left of my estate, and gambled it away when Helen said she'd die before giving herself to him. It was partly on his account that I brought her away. Then there were a lot of moon-eyed beggars after her all the time, and she's young and full of fire. I hoped I'd marry her to some farmer out here, and end my days in peace.\"  \"Peace? With eyes like those? Never on this green earth,\" and Colonel Zane laughed as he slapped his friend on the shoulder. \"Don't worry, old fellow. You can't help her having those changing dark-blue eyes any more than you can help being proud of them. They have won me, already, susceptible old backwoodsman! I'll help you with this spirited young lady. I've had experience, Sheppard, and don't you forget it. First, my sister, a Zane all through, which is saying enough. Then as sweet and fiery a little Indian princess as ever stepped in a beaded moccasin, and since, more than one beautiful, impulsive creature. Being in authority, I suppose it's natural that all the work, from keeping the garrison ready against an attack, to straightening out love affairs, should fall upon me. I'll take the care off your shoulders; I'll keep these young dare-devils from killing each other over Miss Helen's favors. I certainly--Hello! There are strangers at the gate. Something's up.\"  Half a dozen rough-looking men had appeared from round the corner of the cabin, and halted at the gate.  \"Bill Elsing, and some of his men from Yellow Creek,\" said Colonel Zane, as he went toward the group.  \"Hullo, Kurnel,\" was the greeting of the foremost, evidently the leader. \"We've lost six head of hosses over our way, an' are out lookin' 'em up.\"  \"The deuce you have! Say, this horse-stealing business is getting interesting. What did you come in for?\"  \"Wal, we meets Jonathan on the ridge about sunup, an' he sent us back lickety-cut. Said he had two of the hosses corralled, an' mebbe Wetzel could git the others.\"  \"That's strange,\" replied Colonel Zane thoughtfully.  \"'Pears to me Jack and Wetzel hev some redskins treed, an' didn't want us to spile the fun. Mebbe there wasn't scalps enough to go round. Anyway, we come in, an' we'll hang up here to-day.\"  \"Bill, who's doing this horse-stealing?\"  \"Damn if I know. It's a mighty pert piece of work. I've a mind it's some slick white fellar, with Injuns backin' him.\"  Helen noted, when she was once more indoors, that Colonel Zane's wife appeared worried. Her usual placid expression was gone. She put off the playful overtures of her two bright boys with unusual indifference, and turned to her husband with anxious questioning as to whether the strangers brought news of Indians. Upon being assured that such was not the case, she looked relieved, and explained to Helen that she had seen armed men come so often to consult the colonel regarding dangerous missions and expeditions, that the sight of a stranger caused her unspeakable dread.  \"I am accustomed to danger, yet I can never control my fears for my husband and children,\" said Mrs. Zane. \"The older I"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/994"],["title","Riders to the Sea (#1)"],["body","it be washed up, and we after looking each day for nine days, and a strong wind blowing a while back from the west and south?  MAURYA. If it wasn’t found itself, that wind is raising the sea, and there was a star up against the moon, and it rising in the night. If it was a hundred horses, or a thousand horses you had itself, what is the price of a thousand horses against a son where there is one son only?  BARTLEY. _Working at the halter, to Cathleen._—Let you go down each day, and see the sheep aren’t jumping in on the rye, and if the jobber comes you can sell the pig with the black feet if there is a good price going.  MAURYA. How would the like of her get a good price for a pig?  BARTLEY. _To Cathleen._—If the west wind holds with the last bit of the moon let you and Nora get up weed enough for another cock for the kelp. It’s hard set we’ll be from this day with no one in it but one man to work.  MAURYA. It’s hard set we’ll be surely the day you’re drownd’d with the rest. What way will I live and the girls with me, and I an old woman looking for the grave?  [_Bartley lays down the halter, takes off his old coat, and puts on a newer one of the same flannel._]  BARTLEY. _To Nora._—Is she coming to the pier?  NORA. _Looking out._—She’s passing the green head and letting fall her sails.  BARTLEY. _Getting his purse and tobacco._—I’ll have half an hour to go down, and you’ll see me coming again in two days, or in three days, or maybe in four days if the wind is bad.  MAURYA. _Turning round to the fire, and putting her shawl over her head._—Isn’t it a hard and cruel man won’t hear a word from an old woman, and she holding him from the sea?  CATHLEEN. It’s the life of a young man to be going on the sea, and who would listen to an old woman with one thing and she saying it over?  BARTLEY. _Taking the halter._—I must go now quickly. I’ll ride down on the red mare, and the gray pony’ll run behind me. . . The blessing of God on you.  [_He goes out._]  MAURYA. _Crying out as he is in the door._—He’s gone now, God spare us, and we’ll not see him again. He’s gone now, and when the black night is falling I’ll have no son left me in the world.  CATHLEEN. Why wouldn’t you give him your blessing and he looking round in the door? Isn’t it sorrow enough is on every one in this house without your sending him out with an unlucky word behind him, and a hard word in his ear?  [_Maurya takes up the tongs and begins raking the fire aimlessly without looking round._]  NORA. _Turning towards her._—You’re taking away the turf from the cake.  CATHLEEN. _Crying out._—The Son of God forgive us, Nora, we’re after forgetting his bit of bread.  [_She comes over to the fire._]  NORA. And it’s destroyed he’ll be going till dark night, and he after eating nothing since the sun went up.  CATHLEEN. _Turning the cake out of the oven._—It’s destroyed he’ll be, surely. There’s no sense left on any person in a house where an old woman will be talking for ever.  [_Maurya sways herself on her stool._]  CATHLEEN. _Cutting off some of the bread and rolling it in a cloth; to Maurya._—Let you go down now to the spring well and give him this and he passing. You’ll see him then and the dark word will be broken, and you can say “God speed you,” the way he’ll be easy in his mind.  MAURYA. _Taking the bread._—Will I be in it as soon as himself?  CATHLEEN. If you go now quickly.  MAURYA. _Standing up unsteadily._—It’s hard set I am to walk.  CATHLEEN. _Looking at her anxiously._—Give her the stick, Nora, or maybe she’ll slip on the big stones.  NORA. What stick?  CATHLEEN. The stick Michael brought from Connemara.  MAURYA. _Taking a stick Nora gives her._—In the big world the old people do be leaving things after them for their sons and children, but in this place it is the young men do be leaving things behind for them that do be old.  [_She goes out slowly. Nora goes over to the ladder._]  CATHLEEN. Wait, Nora, maybe she’d turn back quickly. She’s that sorry, God help her, you wouldn’t know the thing she’d do.  NORA. Is she gone round by the bush?  CATHLEEN. _Looking out._—She’s gone now. Throw it down quickly, for the Lord knows when she’ll be out of it again.  NORA. _Getting the bundle from the loft._—The young priest said he’d be passing to-morrow, and we might go down and speak to him below if it’s Michael’s they are surely.  CATHLEEN. _Taking the bundle._—Did he say what way they were found?  NORA. _Coming down._—“There were two men,” says he, “and they rowing round with poteen before the cocks crowed, and the oar of one of them caught the body, and they passing the black cliffs of the north.”  CATHLEEN. _Trying to open the bundle._—Give me a knife, Nora, the string’s perished with the salt water, and there’s a black knot on it you wouldn’t loosen in a week.  NORA. _Giving her a knife._—I’ve heard tell it was a long way to Donegal.  CATHLEEN. _Cutting the string._—It is surely. There was a man in here a while ago—the man sold us that knife—and he said if you set off walking from the rocks beyond, it would be seven days you’d be in Donegal.  NORA. And what time would a man take, and he floating?  [_Cathleen opens the bundle and takes out a bit of a stocking. They look at them eagerly._]  CATHLEEN. _In a low voice._—The Lord spare us, Nora! isn’t it a queer hard thing to say if it’s his they are surely?  NORA. I’ll get his shirt off the hook the way we can put the one flannel on the other [_she looks through some clothes hanging in the corner._] It’s not with them, Cathleen, and where will it be?  CATHLEEN. I’m thinking Bartley put it on him in the morning, for his own shirt was heavy with the salt in it [_pointing to the corner_]. There’s a bit of a sleeve was of the same stuff. Give me that and it will do.  [_Nora brings it to her and they compare the flannel._]  CATHLEEN. It’s the same stuff, Nora; but if it is itself aren’t there great rolls of it in the shops of Galway, and isn’t it many another man may have a shirt of it as well as Michael himself?  NORA. _Who has taken up the stocking and counted the stitches, crying out._—It’s Michael, Cathleen, it’s Michael; God spare his soul, and what will herself say when she hears this story, and Bartley on the sea?  CATHLEEN. _Taking the stocking._—It’s a plain stocking.  NORA. It’s the second one of the third pair I knitted, and I put up three score stitches, and I dropped four of them.  CATHLEEN. _Counts the stitches._—It’s that number is in it [_crying out._] Ah, Nora, isn’t it a bitter thing to think of him floating that way to the far north, and no one to keen him but the black hags that do be flying on the sea?  NORA. _Swinging herself round, and throwing out her arms on the clothes._—And isn’t it a pitiful thing when there is nothing left of a man who was a great rower and fisher, but a bit of an old shirt and a plain stocking?  CATHLEEN. _After an instant._—Tell me is herself coming, Nora? I hear a little sound on the path.  NORA. _Looking out._—She is, Cathleen. She’s coming up to the door.  CATHLEEN. Put these things away before she’ll come in. Maybe it’s easier she’ll be after giving her blessing to Bartley, and we won’t let on we’ve heard anything the time he’s on the sea.  NORA. _Helping Cathleen to close the bundle._—We’ll put them here in the corner.  [_They put them into a hole in the chimney corner. Cathleen goes back to the spinning-wheel._]  NORA. Will she see it was crying I was?  CATHLEEN. Keep your back to the door the way the light’ll not be on you.  [_Nora sits down at the chimney corner, with her back to the door. Maurya comes in very slowly, without looking at the girls, and goes over to her stool at the other side of the fire. The cloth with the bread is still in her hand. The girls look at each other, and Nora points to the bundle of bread._]  CATHLEEN. _After spinning for a moment._—You didn’t give him his bit of bread?  [_Maurya begins to keen softly, without turning round._]  CATHLEEN. Did you see him riding down?  [_Maurya goes on keening._]  CATHLEEN. _A little impatiently._—God forgive you; isn’t it a better thing to raise your voice and tell what you seen, than to be making lamentation for a thing that’s done? Did you see Bartley, I’m saying to you?  MAURYA. _With a weak voice._—My heart’s broken from this day.  CATHLEEN. _As before._—Did you see Bartley?  MAURYA. I seen the fearfulest thing.  CATHLEEN. _Leaves her wheel and looks out._—God forgive you; he’s riding the mare now over the green head, and the gray pony behind him.  MAURYA. _Starts, so that her shawl falls back from her head and shows her white tossed hair. With a frightened voice._—The gray pony behind him.  CATHLEEN. _Coming to the fire._—What is it ails you, at all?  MAURYA. _Speaking very slowly._—I’ve seen the fearfulest thing any person has seen, since the day Bride Dara seen the dead man with the child in his arms.  CATHLEEN AND NORA. Uah.  [_They crouch down in front of the old woman at the fire._]  NORA. Tell us what it is you seen.  MAURYA. I went down to the spring well, and I stood there saying a prayer to myself. Then Bartley came along, and he riding on the red mare with the gray pony behind him [_she puts up her hands, as if to hide something from her eyes._] The Son of God spare us, Nora!  CATHLEEN. What is it you seen.  MAURYA. I seen Michael himself.  CATHLEEN. _Speaking softly._—You did not, mother; it wasn’t Michael you seen, for his body is after being found in the far north, and he’s got a clean burial by the grace of God.  MAURYA. _A little defiantly._—I’m after seeing him this day, and he riding and galloping. Bartley came first on the red mare; and I tried to say “God speed you,” but something choked the words in my throat. He went by quickly; and “the blessing of God on you,” says he, and I could say nothing. I looked up then, and I crying, at the gray pony, and there was Michael upon it—with fine clothes on him, and new shoes on his feet.  CATHLEEN. _Begins to keen._—It’s"]]]
