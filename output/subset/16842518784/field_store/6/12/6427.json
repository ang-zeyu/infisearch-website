For they had no publick Place for it.  And therefore these Gentlemen considering that they were but a private Society, which several Accidents might either interrupt, or even dissolve, and did besides want some Accommodations, in order to fix and perpetuate an Institution so beneficial to the Publick, they resolved to apply to the Queen for a Royal Charter, and for some publick Building, where they would perform their Exercises; and intended to erect a Library suitable to it.  And they had the more reason to believe they could obtain such a Grant, that the Queen, not contented with a superficial Smattering of Learning, back'd with Conceit and Talkativeness, (which is the highest pitch Persons of the first Rank do commonly arrive to) was truly and solidly learned, and a real Encourager of Letters : wherein she had the ready Concurrence of her Ministers, who were no less conspicuous for their Learning, than for their Integrity and consummate Wisdom.  But as fair as the Hopes of this famous College appeared in its Bloom, they were soon blighted by the Death of that ever-memorable Princess, like those Fruits, which for want of the Sun's genial Rays, cannot arrive at due Maturity.  For all the Applications they made for the same purpose to her Successor, proved vain and unsuccessful.  But what else could be expected from a Man who never had a relish for polite Literature, or any kind of useful Learning, and only delighted in pedantick scholastical Divinity; and fancy'd himself the Wisest and most glorious Prince in the World, (a second Solomon forsooth) if he could but scrible a Pamphlet against Witches, or against tobacco: a Man, in short, whose Genius and Taste were as low and mean, as his Soul and Inclinations!  As for our learned Antiquaries, they were obliged to dissolve themselves, and break their Society, lest (such was the Wisdom of those Times) they should be prosecuted as a Cabal against the Government : Ne quicquam mali contra Rempublicam illos moliri Rex, Conciliariive suspicarentur (K).  Mr. Carew published his Survey of Cornwall, in the Year 1602 (L) and did dedicate it to his Friend Sir Walter Raleigh, Lord Warden of the Stannaries, Lieutenant-General of Cornwall, &c.      \"This mine ill-husbanded Survey\", says he to that great     Man, \" long since begun, a great while discontinued,     lately reviewed, and  now hastily finished, appealeth     to your Lordship's Direction, whether it should pass;     to your Corection if it do pass; and  to your Protection     when it is passed.  Neither unduly : for the same     intreateth of the Province and Persons, over whose Bodies     and Estates, you carry a large, both Martial and Civil     Command, by your Authority ; but in whose Hearts and     Loves you possess a far greater Interest, by your Kindness.     Your Ears and Mouth have ever been open to hear and     deliver our Grievances, and your Feet and Hands ready to go,     and work their Redress; and that, not only always as a     Magistrate of yourself, but also  very often, as a Suiter     and Solicitor to others, of the highest Place.  Wherefore,     I, as one of the common beholden, present this Token of     my private Gratitude.  It is Duty and not Presumption,     that hath drawn me to the Offering; and it must be     Favour, and not Desert, that shall move your Lordship to     the acceptance.  And so I take humble leave, resting no     less willing to serve you, than under you.\"  The Reader will, I hope, excuse my transcribing here the whole Epistle.  These Addresses are a true Test of an Author's Wit and Genius.  And who can be displeased with so just a Character of one of the greatest Men of our Nation?  Mr. Carew subscribes himself, His Lordships poor Kinsman, Richard Carew of Antonie; but how he was related to him, I could not yet find. Sir Walter Raleigh had a Son, whose Christen-name was Carew; and probably our Author was his Godfather.  In his Preface, Mr. Carew observes, that when he first composed this Treatise, not minding that it should be published in Print, he caused only certain written Copies to be given to some of his Friends ...... But since that time, Master Camden's often mentioning this Work, and his Friends Persuasions, had caused his Determination to alter, and to embrace a pleasing Hope, that Charity and good Construction would rest now generally in all Readers.      \"Besides\", says he, \" the State of our Country hath     undergone so many Alterations, since I first began these     Scriblings, that, in the reviewing, I was driven either     likewise to vary my Report, or else to speak against my     Knowledge....      Reckon therefore (I pray you) that this Treatise plotteth     down Cornwall, as it now standeth, for the particulars,     and will continue, for the general.\"  Mr. Carew's Survey of Cornwall was receiv'd, when it came out, (as it hath been ever since) with a general Applause; as it appears by the Encomiums pass'd upon it, which it would  be  too long to enumerate.  Mr. Camden, in the sixth Edition of his Britannia, printed in 1607, acknowledges, at the end  of his Account of Cornwall, that our Author had been his chief Guide through it (M).  But as 'tis usual to Authors of an inferior rank to be the best pleased with their Works, so the best Authors are the least satisfy'd with their Performances, and the most severe Censors to themselves.  The Approbation of the Publick only excites them to mend their Writings, and give them all the Perfection they are capable. Mr. Carew was uneasy at the Errors of the Printers, and  some Oversights of his, that had crept into his Book; and desired to improve it by the Observations  of others, who had writ on the same Subject.  Being told in the Year 1606, that Mr. Dodderidge, who was then Sollicitor-General, had published some Account of the Dutchy of Cornwall, (which was not true, for that Tract did not come out till 1630) he desired Mr. Camden to send him a Copy of it.       \"I make bold\", says he (N), \" to use my thanks for your      kind remembring me by Sir Anthony Rouse, as a Shoeing-      horn to draw on a Request; and this it is : I learn that      Master Sollicitor hath compiled a Treatise of our Cornish      Dutchy, and dedicated it to the Prince : this I much long      to see, and heartily pray by your means to obtain a Copy      thereof.  The first publishing of my Survey was voluntary;      the second, which I now purpose, is of necessity, not so      much for the enlarging it, as the correcting mine and the      Printers Oversights: and amongst these, the Arms not the      least, touching which mine Order, suitable to your Direction,      was not observed, and so myself made an Instrument, but      not the Author of Wrong and Error.  I imagine that I may      cull out of Master Sollicitor's Garden many Flowers to      adorn this other Edition; and if I wist where to find      Mr. Norden, I would also fain have his Map of our Shire;      for perfecting of which, he took a Journey into these Parts.\"  Mr. Carew never published a second Edition of his Book, tho' he lived fourteen Years after the writing of that Letter.  And whether he left behind him a Copy of it revised and corrected for a new Impression, does not appear.  It hath indeed been reported, that there was a Copy extant with large Additions (O); but they don't tell us whose Additions they are.  They can hardly be the Author's own Additions, since they are said to be large ones; and we have seen that Mr. Carew's Design in the intended second Edition of his Survey, was not so much for the enlarging it, as the correcting his and the Printers Oversights.  However it be, we may reasonably wonder that a Work so valuable, and the only compleat one we have on that Subject, should not have been reprinted since the Year 1602; whereby it is become so scarce, and bears such an excessive Price.  Perhaps this is owing to the false Rumours which have been spread from time to time, that it was going to be reprinted with large Additions.  For these idle common Reports have often prevented new Editions of useful and necessary Books.  But it is to be hoped, that some publick-spirited Persons will reprint it, as it was first published.  If any body hath any Additions or Supplements to it, they may print them separately.  Mr. Carew (P)       \"was intimate with the most noted Scholars of his Time,      particularly with Sir Henry Spelman, who in an Epistle (*)      to him concerning Tythes, doth not a little extol him for      his Ingenuity, Vertue, and Learning.  'Palmam igitur cedo'      (saith he) '& quod Graeci olim in Caria fua gente, admirati      sunt, nos in Caria nostra gente agnoscimus, ingenium      splendidum, bellarumque intentionum saecundissimum, &c.'\"  And a famous Scotch Poet (+)       \"stiles him another Livy, another Maro, another Papinian,      and highly extols him for his great Skill in History, and      Knowledge in the Laws (Q).\"  Mr. Carew       \"died on the sixth day of November, in fifteen hundred and      twenty, and was buried in the Church of East-Antonie among      his Ancestors. Shortly after, he had a splendid Monument      set over his Grave, with an Inscription thereon, written      in the Latin Tongue (R)\"  As I have not"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9886"],["title","The Book of Delight and Other Papers (#1)"],["body"," you running from?\" asked they. \"From a wicked woman,\" he answered. The devils turned and ran away with him.  One rather longer story may be summarized thus: Satan, disguised in human shape, met a fugitive husband, who had left his wicked wife. Satan told him that he was in similar case, and proposed a compact. Satan would enter into the bodies of men, and the other, pretending to be a skilful physician, would exorcise Satan. They would share the profits. Satan begins on the king, and the queen engages the confederate to cure the king within three days, for a large fee, but in case of failure the doctor is to die. Satan refuses to come out: his real plan is to get the doctor killed in this way. The doctor obtains a respite, and collects a large body of musicians, who make a tremendous din. Satan trembles. \"What is that noise?\" he asks. \"Your wife is coming,\" says the doctor. Out sprang Satan and fled to the end of the earth.  These tales and quips, it is true, are directed against \"wicked\" women, but if Zabara really wrote them, it would be difficult to acquit him of woman-hatred, unless the stories have been misplaced, and should appear, as part of the \"Book of Delight,\" within the Leopard section, which rounds off a series of unfriendly tales with a moral friendly to woman. In general, Oriental satire directed against women must not be taken too seriously. As Güdemann has shown, the very Jews that wrote most bitterly of women were loud in praise of their own wives--the women whom alone they knew intimately. Woman was the standing butt for men to hurl their darts at, and one cannot help feeling that a good deal of the fun got its point from the knowledge that the charges were exaggerated or untrue. You find the Jewish satirists exhausting all their stores of drollery on the subject of rollicking drunkenness. They roar till their sides creak over the humor of the wine-bibber. They laugh at him and with him. They turn again and again to the subject, which shares the empire with women in the Jewish poets. Yet we know well enough that the writers of these Hebrew Anacreontic lyrics were sober men, who rarely indulged in overmuch strong drink. In short, the medieval Jewish satirists were gifted with much of what a little time ago was foolishly styled \"the new humor.\" Joseph Zabara was a \"new\" humorist. He has the quaint subtlety of the author of the \"Ingoldsby Legends,\" and revelled in the exaggeration of trifles that is the stock-in-trade of the modern funny man. Woman plays the part with the former that the mother-in-law played a generation ago with the latter. In Zabara, again, there is a good deal of mere rudeness, which the author seems to mistake for cutting repartee. This, I take it, is another characteristic of the so-called new humor.  The probable explanation of the marked divergence between Zabara's stories and the moral he draws from them lies, however, a little deeper. The stories themselves are probably Indian in origin; hence they are marked by the tone hostile to woman so characteristic of Indian folk-lore. On the other hand, if Zabara himself was a friendly critic of woman, his own moralizings in her favor are explained. This theory is not entirely upset by the presence even of the additional stories, for these, too, are translations, and Zabara cannot be held responsible for their contents. The selection of good anecdotes was restricted in his day within very narrow limits.  Yet Zabara's reading must have been extensive. He knew something of astronomy, philosophy, the science of physiognomy, music, mathematics, and physics, and a good deal of medicine. He was familiar with Arabian collections of proverbs and tales, for he informs his readers several times that he is drawing on Arabic sources. He knew the \"Choice of Pearls,\" the Midrashic \"Stories of King Solomon,\" the \"Maxims of the Philosophers,\" the \"Proverbs of the Wise\"; but not \"Sendabar\" in its Hebrew form. His acquaintance with the language of the Bible was thorough; but he makes one or two blunders in quoting the substance of Scriptural passages. Though he disclaimed the title of a Talmudic scholar, he was not ignorant of the Rabbinic literature. Everyone quotes it: the fox, the woman, Enan, and the author. He was sufficiently at home in this literature to pun therein. He also knew the story of Tobit, but, as he introduces it as \"a most marvellous tale,\" it is clear that this book of the Apocrypha was not widely current in his day. The story, as Zabara tells it, differs considerably from the Apocryphal version of it. The incidents are misplaced, the story of the betrothal is disconnected from that of the recovery of the money by Tobit, and the detail of the gallows occurs in no other known text of the story. In one point, Zabara's version strikingly agrees with the Hebrew and Chaldee texts of Tobit as against the Greek; Tobit's son is not accompanied by a dog on his journey to recover his father's long-lost treasure.  One of the tales told by Zabara seems to imply a phenomenon of the existence of which there is no other evidence. There seems to have been in Spain a small class of Jews that were secret converts to Christianity. They passed openly for Jews, but were in truth Christians. The motive for the concealment is unexplained, and the whole passage may be merely satirical.  It remains for me to describe the texts now extant of the \"Book of Delight.\" In 1865 the \"Book of Delight\" appeared, from a fifteenth century manuscript in Paris, in the second volume of a Hebrew periodical called the _Lebanon_. In the following year the late Senior Sachs wrote an introduction to it and to two other publications, which were afterwards issued together under the title _Yen Lebanon_ (Paris, 1866). The editor was aware of the existence of another text, but, strange to tell, he did not perceive the need of examining it. Had he done this, his edition would have been greatly improved. For the Bodleian Library possesses a copy of another edition of the \"Book of Delight,\" undated, and without place of issue, but printed in Constantinople, in 1577. One or two other copies of this edition are extant elsewhere. The editor was Isaac Akrish, as we gather from a marginal note to the version of Tobit given by Joseph Zabara. This Isaac Akrish was a travelling bookseller, who printed interesting little books, and hawked them about. Dr. Steinschneider points out that the date of Isaac Akrish's edition can be approximately fixed by the type. The type is that of the Jaabez Press, established in Constantinople and Salonica in 1560. This Constantinople edition is not only longer than the Paris edition, it is, on the whole, more accurate. The verbal variations between the two editions are extremely numerous, but the greater accuracy of the Constantinople edition shows itself in many ways. The rhymes are much better preserved, though the Paris edition is occasionally superior in this respect. But many passages that are quite unintelligible in the Paris edition are clear enough in the Constantinople edition.  The gigantic visitor of Joseph, the narrator, the latter undoubtedly the author himself, is a strange being. Like the guide of Gil Bias on his adventures, he is called a demon, and he glares and emits smoke and fire. But he proves amenable to argument, and quotes the story of the washerwoman, to show how it was that he became a reformed character. This devil quotes the Rabbis, and is easily convinced that it is unwise for him to wed an ignorant bride. It would seem as though Zabara were, on the one hand, hurling a covert attack against some one who had advised him to leave Barcelona to his own hurt, while, on the other hand, he is satirizing the current beliefs of Jews and Christians in evil spirits. More than one passage is decidedly anti-Christian, and it would not be surprising to find that the framework of the romance had been adopted with polemic intention.  The character of the framework becomes more interesting when it is realized that Zabara derived it from some version of the legends of which King Solomon is the hero. The king had various adventures with a being more or less demoniac in character, who bears several names: Asmodeus, Saturn, Marcolf, or Morolf. That the model for Zabara's visitor was Solomon's interlocutor, is not open to doubt. The Solomon legend occurs in many forms, but in all Marcolf (or whatever other name he bears) is a keen contester with the king in a battle of wits. No doubt, at first Marcolf filled a serious, respectable rôle; in course of time, his character degenerated into that of a clown or buffoon. It is difficult to summarize the legend, it varies so considerably in the versions. Marcolf in the best-known forms, which are certainly older than Zabara, is \"right rude and great of body, of visage greatly misshapen and foul.\" Sometimes he is a dwarf, sometimes a giant; he is never normal. He appears with his counterpart, a sluttish wife, before Solomon, who, recognizing him as famous for his wit and wisdom, challenges him to a trial of wisdom, promising great rewards as the prize of victory. The two exchange a series of questions and answers, which may be compared in spirit, though not in actual content, with the questions and answers to be found in Zabara. Marcolf succeeds in thoroughly tiring out the king, and though the courtiers are for driving Marcolf off with scant courtesy, the king interposes, fulfils his promise, and dismisses his adversary with gifts. Marcolf leaves the court, according to one version, with the noble remark, _Ubi non est lex, ibi non est rex_.  This does not exhaust the story, however. In another part of the legend, to which, again, Zabara offers parallels, Solomon, being out hunting, comes suddenly on Marcolf's hut, and, calling upon him, receives a number of riddling answers, which completely foil him, and tor the solution of which he is compelled to have recourse to the proposer. He departs, however, in "]]]
