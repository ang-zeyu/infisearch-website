They could hear the provision room door shut. Then Polly turned. \"Oh, Davie,\" she cried. Then she stopped, at the sight of his face.  \"Now you and I must go in the house and think of something to do for Mamsie before she gets home,\" she cried in a cheery burst. So they both hurried in over the old flat stone.  \"Now what will it be, Davie?\" asked Polly, with another glance at his pale little face. \"Let's think,\" she wrinkled her brows in perplexity.  \"We can't wash the dishes,\" said Davie, slowly, standing quite still in the middle of the old kitchen, \"'cause they're all done, Polly.\"  \"No, and we can't wash the floor, 'cause that's all done,\" said Polly, wrinkling her forehead worse than ever. \"Dear me, we must think of something, Davie. O dear me, what can it be?\"  \"We might,\" said little David, slowly, \"try to write some letters, Polly. That would make Mamsie glad, I guess.\"  \"O dear me,\" exclaimed Polly, in dismay, \"I suppose it would, Davie.\" She sighed, and stood quite still.  \"I s'pose Mamsie would say, 'How nice,'\" said little David, reflectively.  \"And you and I ought to get right at it this very minute,\" declared Polly, all her energy returning to her after that one dreadful pause, \"so come on.\" And presently the two had the old table against the wall pulled out into the middle of the kitchen floor, and Polly ran and got the big piece of foolscap paper laid away carefully in the upper bureau drawer in the bedroom. Across the top ran the letters set there by the minister in obedience to Mrs. Pepper's request.  \"I'll get the brown paper--let me, Polly,\" cried David, quite in his usual spirits now. And he clambered up, and got out a carefully folded piece laid away after it had come home wrapped around one of the parcels of coats and sacks Mrs. Pepper had taken to sew.  \"Won't it be most beautiful when we can write on the white paper, Polly?\" he cried, as he ran back into the kitchen, waving the brown paper at her.  Polly set the precious copy along the top of the white foolscap, straight on the table.  \"Oh, that will be a long time, Davie,\" she said, gazing in an awe-struck way at the array of wonderful letters Parson Henderson had made for them. \"Mamsie won't ever let us try until we can make 'em good and straight. O dear me, I don't s'pose I'll ever get a chance.\" She sighed; for writing bothered Polly dreadfully. \"The old pen twists all up whenever I get it in my hand, and everything goes crooked.\"  \"Oh, Polly, you're going to write real nice, by and by,\" said little Davie, setting down the brown paper, and smoothing out the creases. \"Now where's the ink-bottle? Let me get it, Polly, do,\" he begged, running over to the corner cupboard.  \"No, you mustn't, Dave,\" said Polly in alarm, \"you'll spill it. I'll get it,\" hurrying after him.  \"I won't spill it, Polly\"--but Polly was already on her tiptoes, and lifting down the old black ink-horn that had been Father Pepper's. \"Isn't it nice that Mrs. Henderson filled it up for us so good?\" she said, carrying it over carefully to set on the table. \"You can get the pen, Davie.\"  So David ran over to the shelf where, in a corner behind the little china mug given to Phronsie when she was a baby, lay the pen in its long black holder. Getting up on a chair, he seized it.  \"If Phronsie hadn't gone with Mamsie, she'd want to write,\" he said, \"wouldn't she, Polly?\" as he hopped down again.  \"Yes, indeed,\" said Polly, drawing up the inkstand into the best place, and sighing. \"Well, dear me, I'd ever so much rather hold her hand while she writes, than to do it myself.\" And she gave a long stretch.  \"Then you wouldn't ever learn yourself,\" said little Davie, wisely, and putting the pen down carefully.  \"No,\" said Polly, with a little laugh, \"I s'pose I shouldn't, Davie.\" O dear me, she thought, I ought not to laugh when Joel's in there all alone in the provision room. \"Well, now we're all ready. I'm just going to peek and see if he's all right. You stay here, Davie.\"  With that she hopped off down the little steps to look through the big crack in the old door of the provision room.  \"Why--where--\" she started back and rubbed her eyes, and stared again. \"Oh! Davie,\" she screamed. Then she clapped her hands over her mouth. \"It never'd do to scare him,\" she said. And she opened the provision room door and rushed in. The old stool stood in the middle of the floor, but there was no Joel to be seen.  Polly ran here and there. \"Joel--_Joel_!\" she cried, peering into every corner, and looking into the potato bag and behind some boxes that the storekeeper had given the boys to make things out of, and that were kept as great treasures. \"O dear me, what shall I do? I must tell Davie now, so he can help me find him--\" when she heard a funny noise, and rushing outside, she heard Joel say, \"Don't come, Polly, he's 'most dead.\"  Polly gave a gasp, and bounded to his side, as Joel flopped around on the ground, his back toward her, his black eyes fastened on something doubled up in his fists.  \"O dear me, Joel, what is it?\" cried Polly, bending over him.  \"Ow--go way!\" roared Joel, twisting worse than ever, and squeezing his brown hands together tightly; \"he'll get away, maybe, and bite you.\"  \"Oh, he'll bite you, Joe,\" cried Polly, in great alarm. \"O dear me, let me see what it is! I can help, Joel, I can help.\"  She flung herself down on the ground close to his side. Just then out rushed Davie from the provision room.  \"Keep him away, keep him away,\" screamed Joel, trying to turn his back on both of them. But Polly caught sight of a dangling thing hanging from his clenched hands.  \"Oh, Joel!\" She gave one scream, \"It's a snake!\"  \"I know it,\" said Joel, trying to twitch back again; \"it's an ugly mean old adder, Polly, but he's most dead. I've squeezed his neck.\"  \"Let me see him,\" cried Polly. \"Turn around, Joel. I'll help you. O dear me!\" as Joel whirled back, the long body of the snake flopping from one side to the other. \"If he'd keep still, I could cut off his tail high up. I'll go and get the hatchet--\" and she ran off.  \"Hoh! you needn't,\" cried Joel after her, in great dudgeon, and giving a final wrench. \"There, I've deaded him; see, Polly--see, Dave!\" and he held the snake up triumphantly.  \"A snake!\" screamed Davie, tumbling over backward on the grass. \"O dear me, it's a snake, Polly!\" and he huddled up his feet and tucked them under him.  \"Ain't he big?\" cried Joel, swinging the long dangling body at Davie as Polly ran back.  \"Don't scare him, Joel,\" she cried. \"O goodness me! What a big one, and a gray adder, too. Oh, Joel, are you sure he didn't bite you anywhere? Do throw him down and let me see,\" she begged anxiously. But Joel swung the snake back and forth. \"Hoh, I guess not!\" he said scornfully, \"not a single snip, Polly. Ain't he big! I killed him all alone by myself.\"  \"Yes--yes, but do put him down, Joel,\" she begged, \"and let me see if you're all right.\"  So Joel at last set his snake on the ground, and straightened out his tail; then he commenced to run all around him. \"Ain't he a buster, Polly!\" he cried, his eyes shining.  Polly looked at him reprovingly out of her brown eyes. \"Mamsie wouldn't like you to say that word,\" she began. \"But you won't again, I know,\" seeing his face.  \"No,\" said Joel, brightening up, \"I won't, Polly. But ain't he big! You couldn't a-killed him, Dave,\" he cried at little Davie tucking up his toes under him on the grass.  \"No,\" said Davie. \"O dear me, he may be alive and bite us all now.\"  \"Hoh!\" exclaimed Joel, \"he's just as dead as anything. See!\" and he twitched up the long gray snake by the tip of the tail and swung it over his head.  \"Oh, don't, Joe!\" begged Polly, running over to put her arms around David, who burrowed into them as far as he could. \"Do put him down, and come and tell us how you killed him. There, let's all sit down on the doorstep. Come, boys.\"  \"I'm going to hold my snake,\" announced Joel, stopping the swing in mid-air to pat the adder's head lovingly. \"Ain't he sweet, Polly?\"  Davie shivered and turned his eyes away.  \"No, you must not hold him,\" said Polly, decisively. \"If you do, you can't sit on the step beside us.\"  \"Then I won't hold him,\" said Joel, running up to them, \"but I'll have him close to me,\" and he laid the snake by the side of the doorstep. \"I'm going to sit here by you, Polly.\"  Little Davie thrust up his head and looked fearfully around Polly.  \"You can't have that snake here, Joel,\" announced Polly, in her most determined tone. \"Put him off on the grass in the orchard,\" as the one scraggy apple tree was called. \"Now hurry, like a good boy, and then come and tell us how you killed him.\"  \"I can't see him good, 'way off there,\" grumbled Joel, and picking up his snake he dragged him through the grass. \"Just a little bit nearer,\" he pleaded.  \"Not a single bit of an inch nearer, Joel Pepper,\" said Polly, firmly. So Joel laid the snake down and ran back and sat down on the end of the step by Polly.  \"Now begin,\" said Polly.  \"Well, I was sittin' on the old stool,\" said Joel, his chubby face getting very red, \"when I heard a scrunchin' an' a swishin', an' I thought 'twas you, Polly, so I didn't look round.\"  \"No,\" said Polly, with a little shiver, \"it wasn't me. Go on, Joey.\"  \"Well, it scrunched an' it swished, and it didn't stop, so then I looked around.\"  \"O dear me!\" exclaimed Polly, throwing one arm around Joel, and drawing him to her. Little Davie sat up quite straight and folded his hands.  \"And he was sticking up his head behind the potato bag, looking at me just like this.\" Joel flew off the doorstep and stood up as tall as possible and ran out his tongue.  Little Davie gave a loud scream. \"Oh,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7434"],["title","The Adventures of Joel Pepper (#2)"],["body"," brave Joel!\" exclaimed Polly, tumbling off from the doorstep to throw her arms around him, and kiss his stubby black hair.  \"Phoo! that's nothing!\" cried Joel, who always hated to be praised.  \"And I'm just as proud of you as I can be,\" Polly ran on with kindling eyes. \"Oh, Joel!\"  Joel wriggled all over with delight at that \"Oh, Joel!\"  \"And now come back and tell us the rest,\" said Polly, hanging to his brown hand. \"Go on, Joel,\" as they sat down again on the doorstep.  \"Well, he looked at me, and I looked at him,\" said Joel, \"and then I said 'Squish!' and he bobbed down his head, just a minute, and I jumped and I grabbed him by the neck, and that's all, Polly.\" And Joel gave a long stretch.  But Polly had her arms around his neck. \"Oh, you brave, brave Joel,\" she cried. \"Mamsie'll be so proud of you! Think what she'll say when she comes home!\"     II  WHAT DAVE HEARD   \"Dave,\" said Joel, in a whisper. It was the middle of the night, and the loft was very still, save for Ben's breathing over in his bed in the corner.  \"Don't say a word!\" Joel laid his mouth close to the ear on the straw pillow; \"if you do, I'll nip you and snip you.\"  \"Ow!\" said little Davie, huddling down under the scanty blanket and dragging it over his head.  \"Sh--, be still!\" cried Joel, with a wrathful pinch. \"Ben'll hear you,--there now, just see!\"  \"What's the matter, boys?\" asked Ben, sleepily.  Down flew Joel in a heap under his end of the blanket, where he bestowed a kick from one set of toes on David in a little heap against the wall.  The loft was as still as a mouse, so Ben turned over again. \"I guess Joel wanted a drink of water, and he's gone to sleep and forgot all about it. Now, that's good,\" and off he went again.  Joel's black stubby head popped up, and he peered into the darkness. \"Now, I've got to wait ever'n ever so long,\" he grumbled softly to himself. \"No, there he goes!\" he added joyfully, as Ben breathed hard. \"Now, Dave,\" he rolled over and ducked under the blanket-end, \"if you scream again, I'll snip, and snip, and snip you, most dreadful.\"  \"I won't,\" declared little David, fearfully. \"Oh, I won't, Joe,\" huddling off from the little brown fingers.  \"Promise, now, you'll never tell,--black and blue,--hope to die if I do.\"  \"We must tell Mamsie,\" said David.  Joel gave an impatient wriggle. \"Mamsie won't care, and she's too busy. Now say it, 'black and--\"'  \"And we must tell Polly,\" cried little Davie, in a smothered voice. \"Oh, Joel, we _must_ tell Polly.\"  \"_Sh!_\" cried Joel, with a warning pinch on the small arm that sent David into a worse heap than before. \"Now, you've gone and waked Ben up again,\" and he pricked up one ear from under the bedclothes.  \"Oh!\" exclaimed little David, thinking of Mamsie and Polly whom he was not to tell.  Joel drew a long breath, as Ben did not stir.  \"Well, say 'black and blue--hope to die if I do,'\" commanded Joel, sliding back again under the blanket. \"Hurry up, Dave.\"  \"'Black and--blue--hope--to die if I do,'\" mumbled poor little David, stuffing the end of the blanket into his mouth, trying not to cry as he thought of Mamsie and Polly.  \"Now, you know I've found a cave, and I'm goin' up there to live some day,\" announced Joel in a smothered whisper, his mouth close to David's ear.  \"Where?\" cried David, fearfully.  \"_Sh!_ don't speak so loud. Over in 'Bandy Leg Mountain.'\"  \"Ooh,--dear me!\" cried David, stopping himself in the middle of a scream. \"Won't old 'Bandy Leg' catch you, Joel?\"  \"Hoh--no, I ain't afraid!\" declared Joel. \"He's been dead a hundred years, I guess. An' beside, I could knock him flat, yes, sir-ree!\" He doubled up his little brown fist, and bounced up in the middle of the old shake-down.  \"What's the matter, Joe?\" called Ben, sleepily; \"turn over and go to sleep, and you'll forget again about the drink of water.\"  Joel flung himself flat, and burrowed along the whole length of the bed, knocking Davie's shins all the way.  \"You're pullin' all the blanket off me,\" said Davie, clutching his end from Joel's frantic grasp.  \"Go to sleep, boys,\" said Ben, sharply. \"And Joe, stop grumbling for a drink of water. Now you've waked up David.\"  Joel gripped Davie fast and clapped one hand over his mouth.  \"Dear me, I think Ben might stay asleep a minute,\" he muttered in an injured voice. \"Now, don't you speak a single word and I'll tell you all about it,\" after a long pause, in which they heard nothing but a rat nibbling away in the corner.  \"I'm goin' up there to-morrow, an' I'm goin' to take my gun, an' some things to eat, an'--\"  \"Oh, Joel!\" interrupted little David, \"you can't ever in all this world. Polly won't let you.\"  \"Polly'll let us go an' play some to-morrow,\" said Joel, sturdily, \"'cause there ain't any work to do. So there now! An' maybe I'll see a bear. An'----\"  \"O dear me!\" exclaimed little Davie, quite overcome, and trembling in every limb. \"He'll eat you. Joel, I'm going to tell Polly.\"  \"You can't,\" said Joel, coolly; \"you said 'Black-an-blue-hope- to-die-if-I-do,' and I'm goin' to take you.\"  \"Oh, I can't go,\" declared Davie, bouncing up in terror. \"I ain't goin'. I ain't, Joey. I ain't----\"  \"_Sh-sh_!\" warned Joel, with another nip.  \"I ain't--I ain't--\" cried David, softly, through his tears.  \"Pshaw! I guess there ain't any bear up there,\" said Joel, scornfully. \"Be still, Dave!\"  \"An' old--old Bandy Legs'll catch--catch me,\" mumbled David, digging his small knuckles into his eyes.  \"Old Bandy Legs has been dead ever'n ever so long. I guess a thousand years,\" said Joel; \"an' there's flowers there--oh, most beautiful ones!\"  \"Are there?\" asked David, taking down his hands. \"What kinds, Joel?\"  \"Oh, all sorts. The most be-yewtiful flowers, red and yellow and green, you can't think, Dave Pepper.\"  \"I never saw a green flower,\" said little David, thoughtfully.  \"Well, they're up there. Oh, sights an' sights,\" said Joel, recklessly. \"An' pink and blue an'----\"  \"Are you sure there are green flowers up there, Joel?\" asked David, huddling up to him close.  \"Sh--stop talking--oh, the most _beyewtiful_ things, I tell you, grow up by that cave.\"  \"I might go up and get some not very near the cave, Joel,\" said Davie, after a long breath. \"Not very near.\"  \"So you could,\" said Joel, quickly. \"Then I guess you'll be glad, Dave Pepper, that you came up with me.\"  \"I shall bring down most of the green ones, Joey,\" cried little David, joyfully, \"'cause I can get the others down below the mountain.\"  \"Yes--yes,\" whispered Joel, impatiently.  \"An' if I plant 'em, they'll grow, and then Mamsie'll be glad, an' Polly too,\" he whispered, dreadfully excited. \"Won't Polly be glad though, Joe? She's never seen a green flower.\"  \"Yes; now go to sleep,\" cried Joel, with a nudge, \"and remember not to say a word to me to-morrow about it.\"  \"Can't I say anything to you behind the wood pile?\" asked David, in surprise.  \"No, not a teenty word. An' don't you look at me. If you do, Old Bandy Legs'll come after you.\"  \"You said he was dead,\" cried David in a fearful whisper, and crouching tight to Joel and gripping him with both arms. \"O dear me!\"  \"So he is; but he'll catch you if you say a single word. Now go to sleep, an' when I tell you to come with me to-morrow, you must start just as quick as scat.\"  \"I shall take a basket for the green flowers,\" said Davie, trying not to think of \"Old Bandy Legs.\"  \"No, you mustn't; you can bring 'em down in your arms.\"  \"I can't bring many,\" said little David, swallowing hard. \"I can't bring many, Joe, an' Polly'll want some in her garden.\"  \"Well, old Bandy Legs won't let you get any, if you don't stop,\" said Joel, crossly, \"so there now!\" and he rolled off to the edge of the old straw bed, and in two minutes was fast asleep, leaving little Davie peering up at the rafters to watch for the first streak of light, determined to get as many green flowers as he possibly could for Polly's garden.  \"I'll twist up a birch-bark basket, to bring 'em down in,\" he decided. And the first thing either of them knew, there was Polly shaking their arms and laughing. \"You lazy little things, you--get up! I've been calling and calling and calling you to breakfast.\"  Joel and David flew up into the middle of the bed.  \"Joe was teasing all night for a drink of water,\" said Ben, as Polly ran down into the kitchen. \"An' I was just going to get up and fetch him some, when he tumbled to sleep again.\"  \"Dear me,\" said Polly, rushing at her work; \"well, I'll keep their porridge warm. Now, Phronsie, you can't help me about these dishes.\"  \"I'm just as big since yesterday,\" said Phronsie, standing up on her tiptoes to turn an injured face to Polly. \"See, Polly.\"  \"So you are,\" said Polly, bursting into a laugh. \"Well, I tell you, Pet, what you might do that would help me more.\"  \"More than to wash the dishes, Polly?\" cried Phronsie, tumbling down from her tiptoes. \"Oh, do tell me, Polly!\" And she ran up to her, and seized Polly's check apron with both fat little hands.  \"Why, you see I can't do the dishes, all of 'em, till the boys get through their breakfast,\" said Polly, with a sober face, looking at the old clock, as she thought of the seams on the sacks she was going to fly at as soon as the work was done in the kitchen. How nice it was that Mamsie had promised she might try this very morning while Mrs. Pepper was down at the parsonage, mending the minister's study carpet. \"Now I guess the money'll begin to come in, and Mamsie won't have to work so hard,\" thought Polly over and over, and her heart beat merrily, and the color flew over her cheek.  \"Tell me, Polly,\" begged little Phronsie, holding the apron tight.  \"Well, now, Pet, there's a snarl of thread in the work-basket. Don't you remember, the spool rolled under the table, and nobody saw it go, and the boys kicked it up and made it into a mess, an' Mamsie put it into the little bag, an' I was to pick it out when I got time? If you only could do that, Phronsie, just think how it would help.\"  Phronsie"]]]
