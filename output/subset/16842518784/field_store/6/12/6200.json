There were few relatives to make investigations, and friends soon forgot the sad young widow; so the years rolled on, and Lillian the heiress grew from infancy to childhood in the shadow of this mystery.     Chapter II  PAUL   \"Come, child, the dew is falling, and it is time we went in.\"  \"No, no, Mamma is not rested yet, so I may run down to the spring if I like.\" And Lillian, as willful as winsome, vanished among the tall ferns where deer couched and rabbits hid.  Hester leisurely followed, looking as unchanged as if a day instead of twelve years had passed since her arms received the little mistress, who now ruled her like a tyrant. She had taken but a few steps when the child came flying back, exclaiming in an excited tone, \"Oh, come quick! There's a man there, a dead man. I saw him and I'm frightened!\"  \"Nonsense, child, it's one of the keepers asleep, or some stroller who has no business here. Take my hand and we'll see who it is.\"  Somewhat reassured, Lillian led her nurse to one of the old oaks beside the path, and pointed to a figure lying half hidden in the fern. A slender, swarthy boy of sixteen, with curly black hair, dark brows, and thick lashes, a singularly stern mouth, and a general expression of strength and pride, which added character to his boyish face and dignified his poverty. His dress betrayed that, being dusty and threadbare, his shoes much worn, and his possessions contained in the little bundle on which he pillowed his head. He was sleeping like one quite spent with weariness, and never stirred, though Hester bent away the ferns and examined him closely.  \"He's not dead, my deary; he's asleep, poor lad, worn out with his day's tramp, I dare say.\" \"I'm glad he's alive, and I wish he'd wake up. He's a pretty boy, isn't he? See what nice hands he's got, and his hair is more curly than mine. Make him open his eyes, Hester,\" commanded the little lady, whose fear had given place to interest.  \"Hush, he's stirring. I wonder how he got in, and what he wants,\" whispered Hester.  \"I'll ask him,\" and before her nurse could arrest her, Lillian drew a tall fern softly over the sleeper's face, laughing aloud as she did so.  The boy woke at the sound, and without stirring lay looking up at the lovely little face bent over him, as if still in a dream.  \"_Bella cara_,\" he said, in a musical voice. Then, as the child drew back abashed at the glance of his large, bright eyes, he seemed to wake entirely and, springing to his feet, looked at Hester with a quick, searching glance. Something in his face and air caused the woman to soften her tone a little, as she said gravely, \"Did you wish to see any one at the Hall?\"  \"Yes. Is Lady Trevlyn here?\" was the boy's answer, as he stood cap in hand, with the smile fading already from his face.  \"She is, but unless your business is very urgent you had better see Parks, the keeper; we don't trouble my lady with trifles.\"  \"I've a note for her from Colonel Daventry; and as it is _not_ a trifle, I'll deliver it myself, if you please.\"  Hester hesitated an instant, but Lillian cried out, \"Mamma is close by, come and see her,\" and led the way, beckoning as she ran.  The lad followed with a composed air, and Hester brought up the rear, taking notes as she went with a woman's keen eye.  Lady Trevlyn, a beautiful, pale woman, delicate in health and melancholy in spirit, sat on a rustic seat with a book in her hand; not reading, but musing with an absent mind. As the child approached, she held out her hand to welcome her, but neither smiled nor spoke.  \"Mamma, here is a--a person to see you,\" cried Lillian, rather at a loss how to designate the stranger, whose height and gravity now awed her.  \"A note from Colonel Daventry, my lady,\" and with a bow the boy delivered the missive.  Scarcely glancing at him, she opened it and read:  _My Dear Friend_,  _The bearer of this, Paul Jex, has been with me some months and has served me well. I brought him from Paris, but he is English born, and, though friendless, prefers to remain here, even after we leave, as we do in a week. When I last saw you you mentioned wanting a lad to help in the garden; Paul is accustomed to that employment, though my wife used him as a sort of page in the house. Hoping you may be able to give him shelter, I venture to send him. He is honest, capable, and trustworthy in all respects. Pray try him, and oblige_,  _Yours sincerely_,  _J. R. Daventry_  \"The place is still vacant, and I shall be very glad to give it to you, if you incline to take it,\" said Lady Trevlyn, lifting her eyes from the note and scanning the boy's face.  \"I do, madam,\" he answered respectfully.  \"The colonel says you are English,\" added the lady, in a tone of surprise.  The boy smiled, showing a faultless set of teeth, as he replied, \"I am, my lady, though just now I may not look it, being much tanned and very dusty. My father was an Englishman, but I've lived abroad a good deal since he died, and got foreign ways, perhaps.\"  As he spoke without any accent, and looked full in her face with a pair of honest blue eyes under the dark lashes, Lady Trevlyn's momentary doubt vanished.  \"Your age, Paul?\"  \"Sixteen, my lady.\"  \"You understand gardening?\"  \"Yes, my lady.\"  \"And what else?\"  \"I can break horses, serve at table, do errands, read aloud, ride after a young lady as groom, illuminate on parchment, train flowers, and make myself useful in any way.\"  The tone, half modest, half eager, in which the boy spoke, as well as the odd list of his accomplishments, brought a smile to Lady Trevlyn's lips, and the general air of the lad prepossessed her.  \"I want Lillian to ride soon, and Roger is rather old for an escort to such a little horsewoman. Don't you think we might try Paul?\" she said, turning to Hester.  The woman gravely eyed the lad from head to foot, and shook her head, but an imploring little gesture and a glance of the handsome eyes softened her heart in spite of herself.  \"Yes, my lady, if he does well about the place, and Parks thinks he's steady enough, we might try it by-and-by.\"  Lillian clapped her hands and, drawing nearer, exclaimed confidingly, as she looked up at her new groom, \"I know he'll do, Mamma. I like him very much, and I hope you'll let him train my pony for me. Will you, Paul?\"  \"Yes.\"  As he spoke very low and hastily, the boy looked away from the eager little face before him, and a sudden flush of color crossed his dark cheek.  Hester saw it and said within herself, \"That boy has good blood in his veins. He's no clodhopper's son, I can tell by his hands and feet, his air and walk. Poor lad, it's hard for him, I'll warrant, but he's not too proud for honest work, and I like that.\"  \"You may stay, Paul, and we will try you for a month. Hester, take him to Parks and see that he is made comfortable. Tomorrow we will see what he can do. Come, darling, I am rested now.\"  As she spoke, Lady Trevlyn dismissed the boy with a gracious gesture and led her little daughter away. Paul stood watching her, as if forgetful of his companion, till she said, rather tartly, \"Young man, you'd better have thanked my lady while she was here than stare after her now it's too late. If you want to see Parks, you'd best come, for I'm going.\"  \"Is that the family tomb yonder, where you found me asleep?\" was the unexpected reply to her speech, as the boy quietly followed her, not at all daunted by her manner.  \"Yes, and that reminds me to ask how you got in, and why you were napping there, instead of doing your errand properly?\"  \"I leaped the fence and stopped to rest before presenting myself, Miss Hester\" was the cool answer, accompanied by a short laugh as he confessed his trespass.  \"You look as if you'd had a long walk; where are you from?\"  \"London.\"  \"Bless the boy! It's fifty miles away.\"  \"So my shoes show; but it's a pleasant trip in summer time.\"  \"But why did you walk, child! Had you no money?\"  \"Plenty, but not for wasting on coaches, when my own stout legs could carry me. I took a two days' holiday and saved my money for better things.\"  \"I like that,\" said Hester, with an approving nod. \"You'll get on, my lad, if that's your way, and I'll lend a hand, for laziness is my abomination, and one sees plenty nowadays.\"  \"Thank you. That's friendly, and I'll prove that I am grateful. Please tell me, is my lady ill?\"  \"Always delicate since Sir Richard died.\"  \"How long ago was that?\"  \"Ten years or more.\"  \"Are there no young gentlemen in the family?\"  \"No, Miss Lillian is an only child, and a sweet one, bless her!\"  \"A proud little lady, I should say.\"  \"And well she may be, for there's no better blood in England than the Trevlyns, and she's heiress to a noble fortune.\"  \"Is that the Trevlyn coat of arms?\" asked the boy abruptly, pointing to a stone falcon with the motto ME AND MINE carved over the gate through which they were passing.  \"Yes. Why do you ask?\"  \"Mere curiosity; I know something of heraldry and often paint these things for my own pleasure. One learns odd amusements abroad,\" he added, seeing an expression of surprise on the woman's face.  \"You'll have little time for such matters here. Come in and report yourself to the keeper, and if you'll take my advice ask no questions of him, for you'll get no answers.\"  \"I seldom ask questions of men, as they are not fond of gossip.\" And the boy nodded with a smile of mischievous significance as he entered the keeper's lodge.  A sharp lad and a saucy, if he likes. I'll keep my eye on him, for my lady takes no more thought of such things than a child, and Lillian cares for nothing but her own will. He has a taking way with him, though, and knows how to flatter. It's well he does, poor lad, for life's a hard matter to a friendless soul like him.  As she thought these thoughts Hester went on to the house, leaving Paul to win the good graces of the keeper, which he speedily did by assuming an utterly different manner from that he had worn with the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8188"],["title","The Mysterious Key and What It Opened (#2)"],["body",".  That night, when the boy was alone in his own room, he wrote a long letter in Italian describing the events of the day, enclosed a sketch of the falcon and motto, directed it to \"Father Cosmo Carmela, Genoa,\" and lay down to sleep, muttering, with a grim look and a heavy sigh, \"So far so well; I'll not let my heart be softened by pity, or my purpose change till my promise is kept. Pretty child, I wish I had never seen her!\"     Chapter III  SECRET SERVICE   In a week Paul was a favorite with the household; even prudent Hester felt the charm of his presence, and owned that Lillian was happier for a young companion in her walks. Hitherto the child had led a solitary life, with no playmates of her own age, such being the will of my lady; therefore she welcomed Paul as a new and delightful amusement, considering him her private property and soon transferring his duties from the garden to the house. Satisfied of his merits, my lady yielded to Lillian's demands, and Paul was installed as page to the young lady. Always respectful and obedient, he never forgot his place, yet seemed unconsciously to influence all who approached him, and win the goodwill of everyone.  My lady showed unusual interest in the lad, and Lillian openly displayed her admiration for his accomplishments and her affection for her devoted young servitor. Hester was much flattered by the confidence he reposed in her, for to her alone did he tell his story, and of her alone asked advice and comfort in his various small straits. It was as she suspected: Paul was a gentleman's son, but misfortune had robbed him of home, friends, and parents, and thrown him upon the world to shift for himself. This sad story touched the woman's heart, and the boy's manly spirit won respect. She had lost a son years ago, and her empty heart yearned over the motherless lad. Ashamed to confess the tender feeling, she wore her usual severe manner to him in public, but in private softened wonderfully and enjoyed the boy's regard heartily.  \"Paul, come in. I want to speak with you a moment,\" said my lady, from the long window of the library to the boy who was training vines outside.  Dropping his tools and pulling off his hat, Paul obeyed, looking a little anxious, for the month of trial expired that day. Lady Trevlyn saw and answered the look with a gracious smile.  \"Have no fears. You are to stay if you will, for Lillian is happy and I am satisfied with you.\"  \"Thank you, my lady.\" And an odd glance of mingled pride and pain shone in the boy's downcast eyes.  \"That is settled, then. Now let me say what I called you in for. You spoke of being able to illuminate on parchment. Can you restore this old book for me?\"  She put into his hand the ancient volume Sir Richard had been reading the day he died. It had lain neglected in a damp nook for years till my lady discovered it, and, sad as were the associations connected with it, she desired to preserve it for the sake of the weird prophecy if nothing else. Paul examined it, and as he turned it to and fro in his hands it opened at the page oftenest read by its late master. His eye kindled as he looked, and with a quick gesture he turned as if toward the light, in truth to hide the flash of triumph that passed across his face. Carefully controlling his voice, he answered in a moment, as he looked up, quite composed, \"Yes, my lady, I can retouch the faded colors on these margins and darken the pale ink of the Old English text. I like the work, and will gladly do it if you like.\"  \"Do it, then, but be very careful of the book while in your hands. Provide what is needful, and name your own price for the work,\" said his mistress.  \"Nay, my lady, I am already paid--\"  \"How so?\" she asked, surprised.  Paul had spoken hastily, and for an instant looked embarrassed, but answered with a sudden flush on his dark cheeks, \"You have been kind to me, and I am glad to show my, gratitude in any way, my lady.\"  \"Let that pass, my boy. Do this little service for me and we will see about the recompense afterward.\" And with a smile Lady Trevlyn left him to begin his work.  The moment the door closed behind her a total change passed over Paul. He shook his clenched hand after her with a gesture of menace, then tossed up the old book and caught it with an exclamation of delight, as he reopened it at the worn page and reread the inexplicable verse.  \"Another proof, another proof! The work goes bravely on, Father Cosmo; and boy as I am, I'll keep my word in spite of everything,\" he muttered.  \"What is that you'll keep, lad?\" said a voice behind him.  \"I'll keep my word to my lady, and do my best to restore this book, Mrs. Hester,\" he answered, quickly recovering himself.  \"Ah, that's the last book poor Master read. I hid it away, but my lady found it in spite of me,\" said Hester, with a doleful sigh.  \"Did he die suddenly, then?\" asked the boy.  \"Dear heart, yes; I found him dying in this room with the ink scarce dry on the letter he left for my lady. A mysterious business and a sad one.\"  \"Tell me about it. I like sad stories, and I already feel as if I belonged to the family, a loyal retainer as in the old times. While you dust the books and I rub the mold off this old cover, tell me the tale, please, Mrs. Hester.\"  She shook her head, but yielded to the persuasive look and tone of the boy, telling the story more fully than she intended, for she loved talking and had come to regard Paul as her own, almost.  \"And the letter? What was in it?\" asked the boy, as she paused at the catastrophe.  \"No one ever knew but my lady.\"  \"She destroyed it, then?\"  \"I thought so, till a long time afterward, one of the lawyers came pestering me with questions, and made me ask her. She was ill at the time, but answered with a look I shall never forget, 'No, it's not burnt, but no one shall ever see it.' I dared ask no more, but I fancy she has it safe somewhere and if it's ever needed she'll bring it out. It was only some private matters, I fancy.\"  \"And the stranger?\"  \"Oh, he vanished as oddly as he came, and has never been found. A strange story, lad. Keep silent, and let it rest.\"  \"No fear of my tattling,\" and the boy smiled curiously to himself as he bent over the book, polishing the brassbound cover.  \"What are you doing with that pretty white wax?\" asked Lillian the next day, as she came upon Paul in a quiet corner of the garden and found him absorbed in some mysterious occupation.  With a quick gesture he destroyed his work, and, banishing a momentary expression of annoyance, he answered in his accustomed tone as he began to work anew, \"I am molding a little deer for you, Miss Lillian. See, here is a rabbit already done, and I'll soon have a stag also.\"  \"It's very pretty! How many nice things you can do, and how kind you are to think of my liking something new. Was this wax what you went to get this morning when you rode away so early?\" asked the child.  \"Yes, Miss Lillian. I was ordered to exercise your pony and I made him useful as well. Would you like to try this? It's very easy.\"  Lillian was charmed, and for several days wax modeling was her favorite play. Then she tired of it, and Paul invented a new amusement, smiling his inexplicable smile as he threw away the broken toys of wax.  \"You are getting pale and thin, keeping such late hours, Paul. Go to bed, boy, go to bed, and get your sleep early,\" said Hester a week afterward, with a motherly air, as Paul passed her one morning.  \"And how do you know I don't go to bed?\" he asked, wheeling about.  \"My lady has been restless lately, and I sit up with her till she sleeps. As I go to my room, I see your lamp burning, and last night I got as far as your door, meaning to speak to you, but didn't, thinking you'd take it amiss. But really you are the worse for late hours, child.\"  \"I shall soon finish restoring the book, and then I'll sleep. I hope I don't disturb you. I have to grind my colors, and often make more noise than I mean to.\"  Paul fixed his eyes sharply on the woman as he spoke, but she seemed unconscious of it, and turned to go on, saying indifferently, \"Oh, that's the odd sound, is it? No, it doesn't trouble me, so grind away, and make an end of it as soon as may be.\"  An anxious fold in the boy's forehead smoothed itself away as he left her, saying to himself with a sigh of relief, \"A narrow escape; it's well I keep the door locked.\"  The boy's light burned no more after that, and Hester was content till a new worry came to trouble her. On her way to her room late one night, she saw a tall shadow flit down one of the side corridors that branched from the main one. For a moment she was startled, but, being a woman of courage, she followed noiselessly, till the shadow seemed to vanish in the gloom of the great hall.  \"If the house ever owned a ghost I'd say that's it, but it never did, so I suspect some deviltry. I'll step to Paul. He's not asleep, I dare say. He's a brave and a sensible lad, and with him I'll quietly search the house.\"  Away she went, more nervous than she would own, and tapped at the boy's door. No one answered, and, seeing that it was ajar, Hester whisked in so hurriedly that her candle went out. With an impatient exclamation at her carelessness she glided to the bed, drew the curtain, and put forth her hand to touch the sleeper. The bed was empty. A disagreeable thrill shot through her, as she assured herself of the fact by groping along the narrow bed. Standing in the shadow of the curtain, she stared about the dusky room, in which objects were visible by the light of a new moon.  \"Lord bless me, what is the boy about! I do believe it was him I saw in the--\" She got no further in her mental exclamation for the sound of light approaching footsteps neared her. Slipping around the bed she waited in the shadow, and a moment after Paul appeared, looking pale and ghostly, with dark, disheveled hair, wide-open eyes, and a cloak thrown over his shoulders. Without a pause he flung "]]]
