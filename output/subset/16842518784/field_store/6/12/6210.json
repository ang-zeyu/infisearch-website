It was already opened, and Hunter was seated at the       small table inside. She had begun to tell him of what had       happened, when the stranger came up again.        “‘Good-evening,’ said he, looking through the window. ‘I wanted       to have a word with you.’ The girl has sworn that as he spoke she       noticed the corner of the little paper packet protruding from his       closed hand.        “‘What business have you here?’ asked the lad.        “‘It’s business that may put something into your pocket,’ said       the other. ‘You’ve two horses in for the Wessex Cup—Silver Blaze       and Bayard. Let me have the straight tip and you won’t be a       loser. Is it a fact that at the weights Bayard could give the       other a hundred yards in five furlongs, and that the stable have       put their money on him?’        “‘So, you’re one of those damned touts!’ cried the lad. ‘I’ll       show you how we serve them in King’s Pyland.’ He sprang up and       rushed across the stable to unloose the dog. The girl fled away       to the house, but as she ran she looked back and saw that the       stranger was leaning through the window. A minute later, however,       when Hunter rushed out with the hound he was gone, and though he       ran all round the buildings he failed to find any trace of him.”        “One moment,” I asked. “Did the stable-boy, when he ran out with       the dog, leave the door unlocked behind him?”        “Excellent, Watson, excellent!” murmured my companion. “The       importance of the point struck me so forcibly that I sent a       special wire to Dartmoor yesterday to clear the matter up. The       boy locked the door before he left it. The window, I may add, was       not large enough for a man to get through.        “Hunter waited until his fellow-grooms had returned, when he sent       a message to the trainer and told him what had occurred. Straker       was excited at hearing the account, although he does not seem to       have quite realized its true significance. It left him, however,       vaguely uneasy, and Mrs. Straker, waking at one in the morning,       found that he was dressing. In reply to her inquiries, he said       that he could not sleep on account of his anxiety about the       horses, and that he intended to walk down to the stables to see       that all was well. She begged him to remain at home, as she could       hear the rain pattering against the window, but in spite of her       entreaties he pulled on his large mackintosh and left the house.        “Mrs. Straker awoke at seven in the morning, to find that her       husband had not yet returned. She dressed herself hastily, called       the maid, and set off for the stables. The door was open; inside,       huddled together upon a chair, Hunter was sunk in a state of       absolute stupor, the favourite’s stall was empty, and there were       no signs of his trainer.        “The two lads who slept in the chaff-cutting loft above the       harness-room were quickly aroused. They had heard nothing during       the night, for they are both sound sleepers. Hunter was obviously       under the influence of some powerful drug, and as no sense could       be got out of him, he was left to sleep it off while the two lads       and the two women ran out in search of the absentees. They still       had hopes that the trainer had for some reason taken out the       horse for early exercise, but on ascending the knoll near the       house, from which all the neighbouring moors were visible, they       not only could see no signs of the missing favourite, but they       perceived something which warned them that they were in the       presence of a tragedy.        “About a quarter of a mile from the stables John Straker’s       overcoat was flapping from a furze-bush. Immediately beyond there       was a bowl-shaped depression in the moor, and at the bottom of       this was found the dead body of the unfortunate trainer. His head       had been shattered by a savage blow from some heavy weapon, and       he was wounded on the thigh, where there was a long, clean cut,       inflicted evidently by some very sharp instrument. It was clear,       however, that Straker had defended himself vigorously against his       assailants, for in his right hand he held a small knife, which       was clotted with blood up to the handle, while in his left he       clasped a red and black silk cravat, which was recognised by the       maid as having been worn on the preceding evening by the stranger       who had visited the stables.        “Hunter, on recovering from his stupor, was also quite positive       as to the ownership of the cravat. He was equally certain that       the same stranger had, while standing at the window, drugged his       curried mutton, and so deprived the stables of their watchman.        “As to the missing horse, there were abundant proofs in the mud       which lay at the bottom of the fatal hollow that he had been       there at the time of the struggle. But from that morning he has       disappeared, and although a large reward has been offered, and       all the gypsies of Dartmoor are on the alert, no news has come of       him. Finally, an analysis has shown that the remains of his       supper left by the stable-lad contain an appreciable quantity of       powdered opium, while the people at the house partook of the same       dish on the same night without any ill effect.        “Those are the main facts of the case, stripped of all surmise,       and stated as baldly as possible. I shall now recapitulate what       the police have done in the matter.        “Inspector Gregory, to whom the case has been committed, is an       extremely competent officer. Were he but gifted with imagination       he might rise to great heights in his profession. On his arrival       he promptly found and arrested the man upon whom suspicion       naturally rested. There was little difficulty in finding him, for       he inhabited one of those villas which I have mentioned. His       name, it appears, was Fitzroy Simpson. He was a man of excellent       birth and education, who had squandered a fortune upon the turf,       and who lived now by doing a little quiet and genteel book-making       in the sporting clubs of London. An examination of his       betting-book shows that bets to the amount of five thousand       pounds had been registered by him against the favourite.        “On being arrested he volunteered the statement that he had come       down to Dartmoor in the hope of getting some information about       the King’s Pyland horses, and also about Desborough, the second       favourite, which was in charge of Silas Brown at the Mapleton       stables. He did not attempt to deny that he had acted as       described upon the evening before, but declared that he had no       sinister designs, and had simply wished to obtain first-hand       information. When confronted with his cravat, he turned very       pale, and was utterly unable to account for its presence in the       hand of the murdered man. His wet clothing showed that he had       been out in the storm of the night before, and his stick, which       was a Penang-lawyer weighted with lead, was just such a weapon as       might, by repeated blows, have inflicted the terrible injuries to       which the trainer had succumbed.        “On the other hand, there was no wound upon his person, while the       state of Straker’s knife would show that one at least of his       assailants must bear his mark upon him. There you have it all in       a nutshell, Watson, and if you can give me any light I shall be       infinitely obliged to you.”        I had listened with the greatest interest to the statement which       Holmes, with characteristic clearness, had laid before me. Though       most of the facts were familiar to me, I had not sufficiently       appreciated their relative importance, nor their connection to       each other.        “Is it not possible,” I suggested, “that the incised wound upon       Straker may have been caused by his own knife in the convulsive       struggles which follow any brain injury?”        “It is more than possible; it is probable,” said Holmes. “In that       case one of the main points in favour of the accused disappears.”        “And yet,” said I, “even now I fail to understand what the theory       of the police can be.”        “I am afraid that whatever theory we state has very grave       objections to it,” returned my companion. “The police imagine, I       take it, that this Fitzroy Simpson, having drugged the lad, and       having in some way obtained a duplicate key, opened the stable       door and took out the horse, with the intention, apparently, of       kidnapping him altogether. His bridle is missing, so that Simpson       must have put this on. Then, having left the door open behind       him, he was leading the horse away over the moor, when he was       either met or overtaken by the trainer. A row naturally ensued.       Simpson beat out the trainer’s brains with his heavy stick       without receiving any injury from the small knife which Straker       used in self-defence, and then the thief either led the horse on       to some secret hiding-place, or else it may have bolted during       the struggle, and be now wandering out on the moors. That is the       case as it appears to the police, and improbable as it is, all       other explanations are more improbable still. However, I shall       very quickly test the matter when I am once upon the spot, and       until then I cannot really see how we can get much further than       our present position.”        It was evening before we reached the little town of Tavistock,       which lies, like the boss of a shield, in the middle of the huge       circle"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/834"],["title","The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes (#2)"],["body","Dartmoor. Two gentlemen were awaiting us in the       station—the one a tall, fair man with lion-like hair and beard       and curiously penetrating light blue eyes; the other a small,       alert person, very neat and dapper, in a frock-coat and gaiters,       with trim little side-whiskers and an eye-glass. The latter was       Colonel Ross, the well-known sportsman; the other, Inspector       Gregory, a man who was rapidly making his name in the English       detective service.        “I am delighted that you have come down, Mr. Holmes,” said the       Colonel. “The Inspector here has done all that could possibly be       suggested, but I wish to leave no stone unturned in trying to       avenge poor Straker and in recovering my horse.”        “Have there been any fresh developments?” asked Holmes.        “I am sorry to say that we have made very little progress,” said       the Inspector. “We have an open carriage outside, and as you       would no doubt like to see the place before the light fails, we       might talk it over as we drive.”        A minute later we were all seated in a comfortable landau, and       were rattling through the quaint old Devonshire city. Inspector       Gregory was full of his case, and poured out a stream of remarks,       while Holmes threw in an occasional question or interjection.       Colonel Ross leaned back with his arms folded and his hat tilted       over his eyes, while I listened with interest to the dialogue of       the two detectives. Gregory was formulating his theory, which was       almost exactly what Holmes had foretold in the train.        “The net is drawn pretty close round Fitzroy Simpson,” he       remarked, “and I believe myself that he is our man. At the same       time I recognise that the evidence is purely circumstantial, and       that some new development may upset it.”        “How about Straker’s knife?”        “We have quite come to the conclusion that he wounded himself in       his fall.”        “My friend Dr. Watson made that suggestion to me as we came down.       If so, it would tell against this man Simpson.”        “Undoubtedly. He has neither a knife nor any sign of a wound. The       evidence against him is certainly very strong. He had a great       interest in the disappearance of the favourite. He lies under       suspicion of having poisoned the stable-boy, he was undoubtedly       out in the storm, he was armed with a heavy stick, and his cravat       was found in the dead man’s hand. I really think we have enough       to go before a jury.”        Holmes shook his head. “A clever counsel would tear it all to       rags,” said he. “Why should he take the horse out of the stable?       If he wished to injure it why could he not do it there? Has a       duplicate key been found in his possession? What chemist sold him       the powdered opium? Above all, where could he, a stranger to the       district, hide a horse, and such a horse as this? What is his own       explanation as to the paper which he wished the maid to give to       the stable-boy?”        “He says that it was a ten-pound note. One was found in his       purse. But your other difficulties are not so formidable as they       seem. He is not a stranger to the district. He has twice lodged       at Tavistock in the summer. The opium was probably brought from       London. The key, having served its purpose, would be hurled away.       The horse may be at the bottom of one of the pits or old mines       upon the moor.”        “What does he say about the cravat?”        “He acknowledges that it is his, and declares that he had lost       it. But a new element has been introduced into the case which may       account for his leading the horse from the stable.”        Holmes pricked up his ears.        “We have found traces which show that a party of gypsies encamped       on Monday night within a mile of the spot where the murder took       place. On Tuesday they were gone. Now, presuming that there was       some understanding between Simpson and these gypsies, might he       not have been leading the horse to them when he was overtaken,       and may they not have him now?”        “It is certainly possible.”        “The moor is being scoured for these gypsies. I have also       examined every stable and out-house in Tavistock, and for a       radius of ten miles.”        “There is another training-stable quite close, I understand?”        “Yes, and that is a factor which we must certainly not neglect.       As Desborough, their horse, was second in the betting, they had       an interest in the disappearance of the favourite. Silas Brown,       the trainer, is known to have had large bets upon the event, and       he was no friend to poor Straker. We have, however, examined the       stables, and there is nothing to connect him with the affair.”        “And nothing to connect this man Simpson with the interests of       the Mapleton stables?”        “Nothing at all.”        Holmes leaned back in the carriage, and the conversation ceased.       A few minutes later our driver pulled up at a neat little       red-brick villa with overhanging eaves which stood by the road.       Some distance off, across a paddock, lay a long grey-tiled       out-building. In every other direction the low curves of the       moor, bronze-coloured from the fading ferns, stretched away to       the sky-line, broken only by the steeples of Tavistock, and by a       cluster of houses away to the westward which marked the Mapleton       stables. We all sprang out with the exception of Holmes, who       continued to lean back with his eyes fixed upon the sky in front       of him, entirely absorbed in his own thoughts. It was only when I       touched his arm that he roused himself with a violent start and       stepped out of the carriage.        “Excuse me,” said he, turning to Colonel Ross, who had looked at       him in some surprise. “I was day-dreaming.” There was a gleam in       his eyes and a suppressed excitement in his manner which       convinced me, used as I was to his ways, that his hand was upon a       clue, though I could not imagine where he had found it.        “Perhaps you would prefer at once to go on to the scene of the       crime, Mr. Holmes?” said Gregory.        “I think that I should prefer to stay here a little and go into       one or two questions of detail. Straker was brought back here, I       presume?”        “Yes; he lies upstairs. The inquest is to-morrow.”        “He has been in your service some years, Colonel Ross?”        “I have always found him an excellent servant.”        “I presume that you made an inventory of what he had in his       pockets at the time of his death, Inspector?”        “I have the things themselves in the sitting-room, if you would       care to see them.”        “I should be very glad.” We all filed into the front room and sat       round the central table while the Inspector unlocked a square tin       box and laid a small heap of things before us. There was a box of       vestas, two inches of tallow candle, an A.D.P. briar-root pipe, a       pouch of seal-skin with half an ounce of long-cut Cavendish, a       silver watch with a gold chain, five sovereigns in gold, an       aluminium pencil-case, a few papers, and an ivory-handled knife       with a very delicate, inflexible blade marked Weiss & Co.,       London.        “This is a very singular knife,” said Holmes, lifting it up and       examining it minutely. “I presume, as I see blood-stains upon it,       that it is the one which was found in the dead man’s grasp.       Watson, this knife is surely in your line?”        “It is what we call a cataract knife,” said I.        “I thought so. A very delicate blade devised for very delicate       work. A strange thing for a man to carry with him upon a rough       expedition, especially as it would not shut in his pocket.”        “The tip was guarded by a disk of cork which we found beside his       body,” said the Inspector. “His wife tells us that the knife had       lain upon the dressing-table, and that he had picked it up as he       left the room. It was a poor weapon, but perhaps the best that he       could lay his hands on at the moment.”        “Very possible. How about these papers?”        “Three of them are receipted hay-dealers’ accounts. One of them       is a letter of instructions from Colonel Ross. This other is a       milliner’s account for thirty-seven pounds fifteen made out by       Madame Lesurier, of Bond Street, to William Derbyshire. Mrs.       Straker tells us that Derbyshire was a friend of her husband’s       and that occasionally his letters were addressed here.”        “Madam Derbyshire had somewhat expensive tastes,” remarked       Holmes, glancing down the account. “Twenty-two guineas is rather       heavy for a single costume. However there appears to be nothing       more to learn, and we may now go down to the scene of the crime.”        As we emerged from the sitting-room a woman, who had been waiting       in the passage, took a step forward and laid her hand upon the       Inspector’s sleeve. Her face was haggard and thin and eager,       stamped with the print of a recent horror.        “Have you got them? Have you found them?” she panted.        “No, Mrs. Straker. But Mr. Holmes here has come from London to       help us, and we shall do all that is possible.”        “Surely I met you in Plymouth at a garden-party some little time       ago, Mrs. Straker?” said Holmes.        “No, sir; you are mistaken.”        “Dear me! Why, I could have sworn to it. You wore a costume of       dove-coloured silk with ostrich-feather trimming.”        “I never had such a dress, sir,” answered the lady.        “Ah, that quite settles it,” said Holmes. And with an apology he       followed the Inspector outside. A short walk across the moor took       us to the hollow in which the body had been found."]]]
