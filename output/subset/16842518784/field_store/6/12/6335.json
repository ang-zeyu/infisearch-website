Meanwhile, the bright sunshine came through the open window; as did likewise the merry voices of the children, playing at a distance, and perhaps the voice of Epimetheus among then.  Pandora stopped to listen.  What a beautiful day it was!  Would it not be wiser, if she were to let the troublesome knot alone, and think no more about the box, but run and join her little playfellows, and be happy?  All this time, however, her fingers were half unconsciously busy with the knot; and happening to glance at the flower-wreathed face on the lid of the enchanted box, she seemed to perceive it slyly grinning at her.  “That face looks very mischievous,” thought Pandora.  “I wonder whether it smiles because I am doing wrong!  I have the greatest mind in the world to run away!”  But just then, by the merest accident, she gave the knot a kind of a twist, which produced a wonderful result.  The gold cord untwined itself, as if by magic, and left the box without a fastening.  “This is the strangest thing I ever knew!” said Pandora.  “What will Epimetheus say?  And how can I possibly tie it up again?”  She made one or two attempts to restore the knot, but soon found it quite beyond her skill.  It had disentangled itself so suddenly that she could not in the least remember how the strings had been doubled into one another; and when she tried to recollect the shape and appearance of the knot, it seemed to have gone entirely out of her mind.  Nothing was to be done, therefore, but to let the box remain as it was, until Epimetheus should come in.  “But,” said Pandora, “when he finds the knot untied, he will know that I have done it.  How shall I make him believe that I have not looked into the box?”  And then the thought came into her naughty little heart, that, since she would be suspected of having looked into the box, she might just as well do so, at once.  O, very naughty and very foolish Pandora!  You should have thought only of doing what was right, and of leaving undone what was wrong, and not of what your playfellow Epimetheus would have said or believed.  And so perhaps she might, if the enchanted face on the lid of the box had not looked so bewitchingly persuasive at her, and if she had not seemed to hear, more distinctly than before, the murmur of small voices within.  She could not tell whether it was fancy or no; but there was quite a little tumult of whispers in her ear,--or else it was her curiosity that whispered,  “Let us out, dear Pandora,--pray let us out!  We will be such nice pretty playfellows for you!  Only let us out!”  “What can it be?” thought Pandora.  “Is there something alive in the box?  Well!--yes!--I am resolved to take just one peep!  Only one peep; and then the lid shall be shut down as safely as ever!  There cannot possibly be any harm in just one little peep!”  But it is now time for us to see what Epimetheus was doing.  This was the first time, since his little playmate had come to dwell with him, that he had attempted to enjoy any pleasure in which she did not partake.  But nothing went right; nor was he nearly so happy as on other days.  He could not find a sweet grape or a ripe fig (if Epimetheus had a fault, it was a little too much fondness for figs); or, if ripe at all, they were over-ripe, and so sweet as to be cloying. There was no mirth in his heart, such as usually made his voice gush out, of its own accord, and swell the merriment of his companions.  In short, he grew so uneasy and discontented, that the other children could not imagine what was the matter with Epimetheus.  Neither did he himself know what ailed him, any better than they did.  For you must recollect, that at the time we are speaking of, it was everybody’s nature, and constant habit, to be happy.  The world had not yet learned to be otherwise.  Not a single soul or body, since these children were first sent to enjoy themselves on the beautiful earth, had ever been sick, or out of sorts.  At length, discovering that, somehow or other, he put a stop to all the play, Epimetheus judged it best to go back to Pandora, who was in a humor better suited to his own.  But, with a hope of giving her pleasure, he gathered some flowers, and made them into a wreath, which he meant to put upon her head.  The flowers were very lovely,--roses, and lilies, and orange-blossoms, and a great many more, which left a trail of fragrance behind, as Epimetheus carried them along; and the wreath was put together with as much skill as could reasonably be expected of a boy.  The fingers of little girls, it has always appeared to me, are the fittest to twine flower-wreaths; but boys could do it, in those days, rather better than they can now.  And here I must mention that a great black cloud had been gathering in the sky, for some time past, although it had not yet overspread the sun. But, just as Epimetheus reached the cottage door, this cloud began to intercept the sunshine, and thus to make a sudden and sad obscurity.  He entered softly; for he meant, if possible, to steal behind Pandora, and fling the wreath of flowers over her head, before she should be aware of his approach.  But, as it happened, there was no need of his treading so very lightly.  He might have trod as heavily as he pleased,--as heavily as a grown man,--as heavily, I was going to say, as an elephant,--without much probability of Pandora’s hearing his footsteps. She was too intent upon her purpose.  At the moment of his entering the cottage, the naughty child had put her hand to the lid, and was on the point of opening the mysterious box.  Epimetheus beheld her.  If he had cried out, Pandora would probably have withdrawn her hand, and the fatal mystery of the box might never have been known.  But Epimetheus himself, although he said very little about it, had his own share of curiosity to know what was inside.  Perceiving that Pandora was resolved to find out the secret, he determined that his playfellow should not be the only wise person in the cottage.  And if there were anything pretty or valuable in the box, he meant to take half of it to himself.  Thus, after all his sage speeches to Pandora about restraining her curiosity, Epimetheus turned out to be quite as foolish, and nearly as much in fault, as she.  So, whenever we blame Pandora for what happened, we must not forget to shake our heads at Epimetheus likewise.  As Pandora raised the lid, the cottage grew very dark and dismal; for the black cloud had now swept quite over the sun, and seemed to have buried it alive.  There had, for a little while past, been a low growling and muttering, which all at once broke into a heavy peal of thunder.  But Pandora, heeding nothing of all this, lifted the lid nearly upright, and looked inside.  It seemed as if a sudden swarm of winged creatures brushed past her, taking flight out of the box, while, at the same instant, she heard the voice of Epimetheus, with a lamentable tone, as if he were in pain.  “O, I am stung!” cried he.  “I am stung!  Naughty Pandora!  why have you opened this wicked box?”  Pandora let fall the lid, and, starting up, looked about her, to see what had befallen Epimetheus.  The thundercloud had so darkened the room that she could not very clearly discern what was in it.  But she heard a disagreeable buzzing, as if a great many huge flies, or gigantic mosquitoes, or those insects which we call dorbugs and pinching-dogs, were darting about.  And, as her eyes grew more accustomed to the imperfect light, she saw a crowd of ugly little shapes, with bats’ wings, looking abominably spiteful, and armed with terribly long stings in their tails.  It was one of these that had stung Epimetheus.  Nor was it a great while before Pandora herself began to scream, in no less pain and affright than her playfellow, and making a vast deal more hubbub about it.  An odious little monster had settled on her forehead, and would have stung her I know not how deeply, if Epimetheus had not run and brushed it away.  Now, if you wish to know what these ugly things might be, which had made their escape out of the box, I must tell you that they were the whole family of earthly Troubles.  There were evil Passions; there were a great many species of Cares; there were more than a hundred and fifty Sorrows; there were Diseases, in a vast number of miserable and painful shapes; there were more kinds of Naughtiness than it would be of any use to talk about.  In short, everything that has since afflicted the souls and bodies of mankind had been shut up in the mysterious box, and given to Epimetheus and Pandora to be kept safely, in order that the happy children of the world might never be molested by them.  Had they been faithful to their trust, all would have gone well.  No grown person would ever have been sad, nor any child have had cause to shed a single tear, from that hour until this moment.  But--and you may see by this how a wrong act of any one mortal is a calamity to the whole world--by Pandora’s lifting the lid of that miserable box, and by the fault of Epimetheus, too, in not preventing her, these Troubles have obtained a foothold among us, and do not seem very likely to be driven away in a hurry.  For it was impossible, as you will easily guess, that the two children should keep the ugly swarm in their own little cottage.  On the contrary, the first thing that they did was to fling open the doors and windows, in hopes of getting rid of them; and, sure enough, away flew the winged Troubles all abroad, and so pestered and tormented the small people, everywhere about, that none of them so much as smiled for many days afterwards.  And, what was very singular, all the flowers and dewy blossoms on earth, not one of which had hitherto faded, now began to droop and shed their leaves, after a day or two.  The children, moreover, who before seemed immortal in their childhood, now grew older, day by day, and came soon to be youths and maidens, and men and"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9257"],["title","The Three Golden Apples (#1)"],["body","enough.  Adventurous young men, who desired to do a braver thing than any of their fellows, set out in quest of this fruit.  Many of them returned no more; none of them brought back the apples.  No wonder that they found it impossible to gather them!  It is said that there was a dragon beneath the tree, with a hundred terrible heads, fifty of which were always on the watch, while the other fifty slept.  In my opinion it was hardly worth running so much risk for the sake of a solid golden apple.  Had the apples been sweet, mellow, and juicy, indeed that would be another matter.  There might then have been some sense in trying to get at them, in spite of the hundred-headed dragon.  But, as I have already told you, it was quite a common thing with young persons, when tired of too much peace and rest, to go in search of the garden of the Hesperides.  And once the adventure was undertaken by a hero who had enjoyed very little peace or rest since he came into the world.  At the time of which I am going to speak, he was wandering through the pleasant land of Italy, with a mighty club in his hand, and a bow and quiver slung across his shoulders.  He was wrapt in the skin of the biggest and fiercest lion that ever had been seen, and which he himself had killed; and though, on the whole, he was kind, and generous, and noble, there was a good deal of the lion’s fierceness in his heart. As he went on his way, he continually inquired whether that were the right road to the famous garden.  But none of the country people knew anything about the matter, and many looked as if they would have laughed at the question, if the stranger had not carried so very big a club.  So he journeyed on and on, still making the same inquiry, until, at last, he came to the brink of a river where some beautiful young women sat twining wreaths of flowers.  “Can you tell me, pretty maidens,” asked the stranger, “whether this is the right way to the garden of the Hesperides?”  The young women had been having a fine time together, weaving the flowers into wreaths, and crowning one another’s heads.  And there seemed to be a kind of magic in the touch of their fingers, that made the flowers more fresh and dewy, and of brighter lines, and sweeter fragrance, while they played with them, than even when they had been growing on their native stems.  But, on hearing the stranger’s question, they dropped all their flowers on the grass, and gazed at him with astonishment.  “The garden of the Hesperides!” cried one.  “We thought mortals had been weary of seeking it, after so many disappointments.  And pray, adventurous traveller, what do you want there?”  “A certain king, who is my cousin,” replied he, “has ordered me to get him three of the golden apples.”  “Most of the young men who go in quest of these apples,” observed another of the damsels, “desire to obtain them for themselves, or to present them to some fair maiden whom they love.  Do you, then, love this king, your cousin, so very much?”  “Perhaps not,” replied the stranger, sighing.  “He has often been severe and cruel to me.  But it is my destiny to obey him.”  “And do you know,” asked the damsel who had first spoken, “that a terrible dragon, with a hundred heads, keeps watch under the golden apple-tree?”  “I know it well,” answered the stranger, calmly.  “But, from my cradle upwards, it has been my business, and almost my pastime, to deal with serpents and dragons.”  The young women looked at his massive club, and at the shaggy lion’s skin which he wore, and likewise at his heroic limbs and figure; and they whispered to each other that the stranger appeared to be one who might reasonably expect to perform deeds far beyond the might of other men.  But, then, the dragon with a hundred heads!  What mortal, even if he possessed a hundred lives, could hope to escape the fangs of such a monster?  So kind-hearted were the maidens, that they could not bear to see this brave and, handsome traveller attempt what was so very dangerous, and devote himself, most probably, to become a meal for the dragon’s hundred ravenous mouths.  “Go back,” cried they all,--“go back to your own home!  Your mother, beholding you safe and sound, will shed tears of joy; and what can she do more, should you win ever so great a victory?  No matter for the golden apples!  No matter for the king, your cruel cousin!  We do not wish the dragon with the hundred heads to eat you up!”  The stranger seemed to grow impatient at these remonstrances.  He carelessly lifted his mighty club, and let it fall upon a rock that lay half buried in the earth, near by.  With the force of that idle blow, the great rock was shattered all to pieces.  It cost the stranger no more effort to achieve this feat of a giant’s strength than for one of the young maidens to touch her sister’s rosy cheek with a flower.  “Do you not believe,” said he, looking at the damsels with a smile, “that such a blow would have crushed one of the dragon’s hundred heads?”  Then he sat down on the grass, and told them the story of his life, or as much of it as he could remember, from the day when he was first cradled in a warrior’s brazen shield.  While he lay there, two immense serpents came gliding over the floor, and opened their hideous jaws to devour him; and he, a baby of a few months old, had griped one of the fierce snakes in each of his little fists, and strangled them to death. When he was but a stripling, he had killed a huge lion, almost as big as the one whose vast and shaggy hide he now wore upon his shoulders.  The next thing that he had done was to fight a battle with an ugly sort of monster, called a hydra, which had no less than nine heads, and exceedingly sharp teeth in every one of them.  “But the dragon of the Hesperides, you know,” observed one of the damsels, “has a hundred heads!”  “Nevertheless,” replied the stranger, “I would rather fight two such dragons than a single hydra.  For, as fast as I cut off a head, two others grew in its place; and, besides, there was one of the heads that could not possibly be killed, but kept biting as fiercely as ever, long after it was cut off.  So I was forced to bury it under a stone, where it is doubtless alive, to this vary day.  But the hydra’s body, and its eight other heads, will never do any further mischief.”  The damsels, judging that the story was likely to last a good while, had been preparing a repast of bread and grapes, that the stranger might refresh himself in the intervals of his talk.  They took pleasure in helping him to this simple food; and, now and then, one of them would put a sweet grape between her rosy lips, lest it should make him bashful to eat alone.  The traveller proceeded to tell how he had chased a very swift stag, for a twelve-month together, without ever stopping to take breath, and had at last caught it by the antlers, and carried it home alive.  And he had fought with a very odd race of people, half horses and half men, and had put them all to death, from a sense of duty, in order that their ugly figures might never be seen any more.  Besides all this, he took to himself great credit for having cleaned out a stable.  “Do you call that a wonderful exploit?” asked one of the young maidens, with a smile.  “Any clown in the country has done as much!”  “Had it been an ordinary stable,” replied the stranger, “I should not have mentioned it.  But this was so gigantic a task that it would have taken me all my life to perform it, if I had not luckily thought of turning the channel of a river through the stable-door.  That did the business in a very short time!”  Seeing how earnestly his fair auditors listened, he next told them how he had shot some monstrous birds, and had caught a wild bull alive, and let him go again, and had tamed a number of very wild horses, and had conquered Hippolyta, the warlike queen of the Amazons.  He mentioned, likewise, that he had taken off Hippolyta’s enchanted girdle, and had given it to the daughter of his cousin, the king.  “Was it the girdle of Venus,” inquired the prettiest of the damsels, “which makes women beautiful?”  “No,” answered the stranger.  “It had formerly been the sword-belt of Mars; and it can only make the wearer valiant and courageous.”  “An old sword-belt!” cried the damsel, tossing her head.  “Then I should not care about having it!”  “You are right,” said the stranger.  Going on with his wonderful narrative, he informed the maidens that as strange an adventure as ever happened was when he fought with Geryon, the six-legged man.  This was a very odd and frightful sort of figure, as you may well believe.  Any person, looking at his tracks in the sand or snow, would suppose that three sociable companions had been walking along together.  On hearing his footsteps at, a little distance, it was no more than reasonable to judge that several people must be coming. But it was only the strange man Geryon clattering onward, with his six legs!  Six legs, and one gigantic body!  Certainly, he must have been a very queer monster to look at; and, my stars, what a waste of shoe-leather!  When the stranger had finished the story of his adventures, he looked around at the attentive faces of the maidens.  “Perhaps you may have heard of me before,” said he, modestly.  “My name is Hercules!”  “We had already guessed it,” replied the maidens; “for your wonderful deeds are known all over the world.  We do not think it strange, any longer, that you should set out in quest of the golden apples of the Hesperides.  Come, sisters, let us crown the hero with flowers!”  Then they flung beautiful wreaths over his stately head and mighty shoulders, so that the lion’s skin was almost entirely covered with roses.  They took possession of his ponderous club, and so entwined it about with the brightest, softest, and most fragrant blossoms, that not a finger’s breadth of its oaken substance could be seen.  It looked all like a huge bunch of flowers.  Lastly, they joined"]]]
