As the derivative wave, consisting of the large mass of water set in motion by the comparatively small rise and fall of the primary wave, is propagated through the branch oceans, it is affected by many circumstances, such as the continual variation in width between the opposite shores, the alterations in the depth of the channels, and the irregularity of the coast line. When obstruction occurs, as, for example, in the Bristol Channel, where there is a gradually rising bed with a converging channel, the velocity, and/or the amount of rise and fall of the derivative wave is increased to an enormous extent; in other places where the oceans widen out, the rise and/or velocity is diminished, and similarly where a narrow channel occurs between two pieces of land an increase in the velocity of the wave will take place, forming a race in that locality.  Although the laws governing the production of tides are well understood, the irregularities in the depths of the oceans and the outlines of the coast, the geographical distribution of the water over the face of the globe and the position and declivity of the shores greatly modify the movements of the tides and give rise to so many complications that no general formulae can be used to give the time or height of the tides at any place by calculation alone. The average rate of travel and the course of the flood tide of the derivative waves around the shores of Great Britain are as follows:--150 miles per hour from Land's End to Lundy Island; 90 miles per hour from Lundy to St. David's Head; 22 miles per hour from St. David's Head to Holy head; 45-1/2 miles per hour from Holyhead to Solway Firth; 194 miles per hour from the North of Ireland to the North of Scotland; 52 miles per hour from the North of Scotland to the Wash; 20 miles per hour from the Wash to Yarmouth; 10 miles per hour from Yarmouth to Harwich. Along the south coast from Land's End to Beachy Head the average velocity is 40 miles per hour, the rate reducing as the wave approaches Dover, in the vicinity of which the tidal waves from the two different directions meet, one arriving approximately twelve hours later than the other, thus forming tides which are a result of the amalgamation of the two waves. On the ebb tide the direction of the waves is reversed.  The mobility of the water around the earth causes it to be very sensitive to the varying attraction of the sun and moon, due to the alterations from time to time in the relative positions of the three bodies. Fig. [Footnote: Plate I] shows diagrammatically the condition of the water in the Southern Ocean when the sun and moon are in the positions occupied at the time of new moon. The tide at A is due to the sum of the attractions of the sun and moon less the effect due to the excess of the centripetal force over centrifugal force. The tide at C is due to the excess of the centrifugal force over the centripetal force. These tides are known as \"spring\" tides. Fig. 2 [Footnote: Plate I] shows the positions occupied at the time of full moon. The tide at A is due to the attraction of the sun plus the effect due to the excess of the centrifugal force over the centripetal force. The tide at C is due to the attraction of the moon less the effect due to the excess of the centripetal force over centrifugal force. These tides are also known as \"spring\" tides. Fig. 3 [Footnote: Plate I] shows the positions occupied when the moon is in the first quarter; the position at the third quarter being similar, except that the moon would then be on the side of the earth nearest to B, The tide at A is compounded of high water of the solar tide superimposed upon low water of the lunar tide, so that the sea is at a higher level than in the case of the low water of spring tides. The tide at D is due to the attraction of the moon less the excess of centripetal force over centrifugal force, and the tide at B is due to the excess of centrifugal force over centripetal force. These are known as \"neap\" tides, and, as the sun is acting in opposition to the moon, the height of high water is considerably less than at the time of spring tides. The tides are continually varying between these extremes according to the alterations in the attracting forces, but the joint high tide lies nearer to the crest of the lunar than of the solar tide. It is obvious that, if the attracting force of the sun and moon were equal, the height of spring tides would be double that due to each body separately, and that there would be no variation in the height of the sea at the time of neap tides.  It will now be of interest to consider the minor movements of the sun and moon, as they also affect the tides by reason of the alterations they cause in the attractive force. During the revolution of the earth round the sun the successive positions of the point on the earth which is nearest to the sun will form a diagonal line across the equator. At the vernal equinox (March 20) the equator is vertically under the sun, which then declines to the south until the summer solstice (June 21), when it reaches its maximum south declination. It then moves northwards, passing vertically over the equator again at the autumnal equinox (September 21), and reaches its maximum northern declination on the winter solstice (December 21). The declination varies from about 24 degrees above to 24 degrees below the equator. The sun is nearest to the Southern Ocean, where the tides are generated, when it is in its southern declination, and furthest away when in the north, but the sun is actually nearest to the earth on December 31 (perihelion) and furthest away on July I (aphelion), the difference between the maximum and minimum distance being one-thirtieth of the whole.  The moon travels in a similar diagonal direction around the earth, varying between 18-1/2 degrees and 28-1/2 degreed above and below the equator. The change from north to south declination takes place every fourteen days, but these changes do not necessarily take place at the change in the phases of the moon. When the moon is south of the equator, she is nearer to the Southern Ocean, where the tides are generated. The new moon is nearest to the sun, and crosses the meridian at midday, while the full moon crosses it at midnight.  The height of the afternoon tide varies from that of the morning tide; sometimes one is the higher and sometimes the other, according to the declination of the sun and moon. This is called the \"diurnal inequality.\" The average difference between the night and morning tides is about 5 in on the east coast and about 8in on the west coast. When there is a considerable difference in the height of high water of two consecutive tides, the ebb which follows the higher tide is lower than that following the lower high water, and as a general rule the higher the tide rises the lower it will fall. The height of spring tides varies throughout the year, being at a maximum when the sun is over the equator at the equinoxes and at a minimum in June at the summer solstice when the sun is furthest away from the equator. In the Southern Ocean high water of spring tides occurs at mid-day on the meridian of Greenwich and at midnight on the 180° meridian, and is later on the coasts of other seas in proportion to the time taken for the derivative waves to reach them, the tide being about three- fourths of a day later at Land's End and one day and a half later at the mouth of the Thames. The spring tides around the coast of England are four inches higher on the average at the time of new moon than at full moon, the average rise being about 15 ft, while the average rise at neaps is 11 ft 6 in.  The height from high to low water of spring tides is approximately double that of neap tides, while the maximum height to which spring tides rise is about 33 per cent. more than neaps, taking mean low water of spring tides as the datum. Extraordinarily high tides may be expected when the moon is new or full, and in her position nearest to the earth at the same time as her declination is near the equator, and they will be still further augmented if a strong gale has been blowing for some time in the same direction as the flood tide in the open sea, and then changes when the tide starts to rise, so as to blow straight on to the shore. The pressure of the air also affects the height of tides in so far as an increase will tend to depress the water in one place, and a reduction of pressure will facilitate its rising elsewhere, so that if there is a steep gradient in the barometrical pressure falling in the same direction as the flood tide the tides will be higher. As exemplifying the effect of violent gales in the Atlantic on the tides of the Bristol Channel, the following extract from \"The Surveyor, Engineer, and Architect\" of 1840, dealing with observations taken on Mr. Bunt's self-registering tide gauge at Hotwell House, Clifton, may be of interest.

Although the times of the tides varied so considerably, their heights were exactly as predicted in the tide-table.  The records during a storm on October 29, 1838, gave an entirely different result, as the time was retarded only ten or twelve minutes, but the height was increased by 8 ft On another occasion the tide at Liverpool was increased 7 ft by a"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7980"],["title","The Sewerage of Sea Coast Towns (#2)"],["body",". The Bristol Channel holds the record for the greatest tide experienced around the shores of Great Britain, which occurred at Chepstow in 1883, and had a rise of 48 ft 6 in The configuration of the Bristol Channel is, of course, conducive to large tides, but abnormally high tides do not generally occur on our shores more frequently than perhaps once in ten years, the last one occurring in the early part of 1904, although there may foe many extra high ones during this period of ten years from on-shore gales. Where tides approach a place from different directions there may be an interval between the times of arrival, which results in there being two periods of high and low water, as at Southampton, where the tides approach from each side of the Isle of Wight.  The hour at which high water occurs at any place on the coast at the time of new or full moon is known as the establishment of that place, and when this, together with the height to which the tide rises above low water is ascertained by actual observation, it is possible with the aid of the nautical almanack to make calculations which will foretell the time and height of the daily tides at that place for all future time. By means of a tide-predicting machine, invented by Lord Kelvin, the tides for a whole year can be calculated in from three to four hours. This machine is fully described in the Minutes of Proceedings, Inst.C.E., Vol. LXV. The age of the tide at any place is the period of time between new or full moon and the occurrence of spring tides at that place. The range of a tide is the height between high and low water of that tide, and the rise of a tide is the height between high water of that tide and the mean low water level of spring tides. It follows, therefore, that for spring tides the range and rise are synonymous terms, but at neap tides the range is the total height between high and low water, while the rise is the difference between high water of the neap tide and the mean low water level of spring tides. Neither the total time occupied by the flood and ebb tides nor the rate of the rise and fall are equal, except in the open sea, where there are fewer disturbing conditions. In restricted areas of water the ebb lasts longer than the flood.  Although the published tide-tables give much detailed information, it only applies to certain representative ports, and even then it is only correct in calm weather and with a very steady wind, so that in the majority of cases the engineer must take his own observations to obtain the necessary local information to guide him in the design of the works. It is impracticable for these observations to be continued over the lengthy period necessary to obtain the fullest and most accurate results, but, premising a general knowledge of the natural phenomena which affect the tides, as briefly described herein, he will be able to gauge the effect of the various disturbing causes, and interpret the records he obtains so as to arrive at a tolerably accurate estimate of what may be expected under any particular circumstances. Generally about 25 per cent. of the tides in a year are directly affected by the wind, etc., the majority varying from 6 in to 12 in in height and from five to fifteen minutes in time. The effect of a moderately stiff gale is approximately to raise a tide as many inches as it might be expected to rise in feet under normal conditions. The Liverpool tide-tables are based on observations spread over ten years, and even longer periods have been adopted in other places.  Much valuable information on this subject is contained in the following books, among others--and the writer is indebted to the various authors for some of the data contained in this and subsequent chapters--\"The Tides,\" by G. H. Darwin, 1886; Baird's Manual of Tidal Observations, 1886; and \"Tides and Waves,\" by W. H. Wheeler, 1906, together with the articles in the \"Encyclopaedia Britannica\" and \"Chambers's Encyclopaedia.\"     Chapter II  Observations of the rise and fall of tides.   The first step in the practical design of the sewage works is to ascertain the level of high and low water of ordinary spring and neap tides and of equinoctial tides, as well as the rate of rise and fall of the various tides. This is done by means of a tide recording instrument similar to Fig. 4, which represents one made by Mr. J. H. Steward, of 457, West Strand, London, W.C. It consists of a drum about 5 in diameter and 10 in high, which revolves by clockwork once in twenty-four hours, the same mechanism also driving a small clock. A diagram paper divided with vertical lines into twenty-four primary spaces for the hours is fastened round the drum and a pen or pencil attached to a slide actuated by a rack or toothed wheel is free to work vertically up and down against the drum. A pinion working in this rack or wheel is connected with a pulley over which a flexible copper wire passes through the bottom of the case containing the gauge to a spherical copper float, 8 inches diameter, which rises and falls with the tide, so that every movement of the tide is reproduced moment by moment upon the chart as it revokes. The instrument is enclosed in an ebonized cabinet, having glazed doors in front and at both sides, giving convenient access to all parts. Inasmuch as the height and the time of the tide vary every day, it is practicable to read three days' tides on one chart, instead changing it every day. When the diagrams are taken of, the lines representing the water levels should be traced on to a continuous strip of tracing linen, so that the variations can be seen at a glance extra lines should be drawn, on the tracing showing the time at which the changes of the moon occur.  Fig. 5 is a reproduction to a small scale of actual records taken over a period of eighteen days, which shows true appearance of the diagrams when traced on the continuous strip.   These observations show very little difference between the spring and neap tides, and are interesting as indicating the unreliability of basing general deductions upon data obtained during a limited period only. At the time of the spring tides at the beginning of June the conditions were not favourable to big tides, as although the moon was approaching her perigee, her declination had nearly reached its northern limit and the declination of the sun was 22° IN The first quarter of the moon coincided very closely with the moon's passage over the equator, so that the neaps would be bigger than usual. At the period of the spring: tides, about the middle of June, although the time of full moon corresponded with her southernmost declination, she was approaching her apogee, and the declination of the sun was 23° 16' N., so that the tides would be lower than usual.  In order to ensure accurate observations, the position chosen for the tide gauge should be in deep water in the immediate vicinity of the locus in quo, but so that it is not affected by the waves from passing vessels. Wave motion is most felt where the float is in shallow water. A pier or quay wall will probably be most convenient, but in order to obtain records of the whole range of the tides it is of course necessary that the float should not be left dry at low water. In some instances the float is fixed in a well sunk above high water mark to such a depth that the bottom of it is below the lowest low water level, and a small pipe is then laid under the beach from the well to, and below, low water, so that the water stands continuously in the well at the same level as the sea.  The gauge should be fixed on bearers, about 3 ft 6 in from the floor, in a wooden shed, similar to a watchman's box, but provided with a door, erected on the pier or other site fixed upon for the observations. A hole must be formed in the floor and a galvanized iron or timber tube about 10 in square reaching to below low water level fixed underneath, so that when the float is suspended from the recording instrument it shall hang vertically down the centre of the tube. The shed and tube must of course be fixed securely to withstand wind and waves. The inside of the tube must be free from all projections or floating matter which would interfere with the movements of the float, the bottom should be closed, and about four lin diameter holes should be cleanly formed in the sides near to the bottom for the ingress and egress of the water. With a larger number of holes the wave action will cause the diagram to be very indistinct, and probably lead to incorrectness in determining the actual levels of the tides; and if the tube is considerably larger than the float, the latter will swing laterally and give incorrect readings.   A bench mark at some known height above ordnance datum should be set up in the hut, preferably on the top of the tube. At each visit the observer should pull the float wire down a short distance, and allow it to return slowly, thus making a vertical mark on the diagram, and should then measure the actual level of the surface of the water below the bench mark in the hut, so that the water line on the chart can be referred to ordnance datum. He should also note the correct time from his watch, so as to subsequently rectify any inaccuracy in the rate of revolution of the drum.  The most suitable period for taking these observations is from about the middle of March to near the end of June, as this will include records of the high spring equinoctial tides and the low \"bird\" tides of June. A chart similar to Fig. 6 should be prepared from the diagrams, showing the rise and fall of the highest spring tides, the average spring tides, the average neap tides, and the lowest neap tides, which will be found extremely useful in considering the levels of, and the discharge from, the sea outfall pipe.  The levels adopted for tide work vary in different ports. Trinity high-water mark is the datum adopted for the Port of London by the Thames Conservancy; it is the level of"]]]
