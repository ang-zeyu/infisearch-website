There they found him, a tall, dark, stately man, of foreign aspect, courteous in demeanor and mild of speech, yet with an abstracted eye, which seemed often to snatch a glance at the invisible.  Meantime the Widow Cranfield went bustling about the house full of joy that she again had somebody to love, and be careful of, and for whom she might vex and tease herself with the petty troubles of daily life. It was nearly noon, when she looked forth from the door, and descried three personages of note coming along the street, through the hot sunshine and the masses of elm-tree shade.  At length they reached her gate, and undid the latch.  “See, Ralph!” exclaimed she, with maternal pride, “here is Squire Hawkwood and the two other selectmen coming on purpose to see you! Now do tell them a good long story about what you have seen in foreign parts.”  The foremost of the three visitors, Squire Hawkwood, was a very pompous, but excellent old gentleman, the head and prime mover in all the affairs of the village, and universally acknowledged to be one of the sagest men on earth.  He wore, according to a fashion, even then becoming antiquated, a three-cornered hat, and carried a silver-headed cane, the use of which seemed to be rather for flourishing in the air than for assisting the progress of his legs.  His two companions were elderly and respectable yeomen, who, retaining an ante-revolutionary reverence for rank and hereditary wealth, kept a little in the Squire’s rear.  As they approached along the pathway, Ralph Cranfield sat in an oaken elbow-chair, half unconsciously gazing at the three visitors, and enveloping their homely figures in the misty romance that pervaded his mental world.  “Here,” thought he, smiling at the conceit,--“here come three elderly personages, and the first of the three is a venerable sage with a staff.  What if this embassy should bring me the message of my fate!”  While Squire Hawkwood and his colleagues entered, Ralph rose from his seat, and advanced a few steps to receive them; and his stately figure and dark countenance, as he bent courteously towards his guests, had a natural dignity, contrasting well with the bustling importance of the Squire.  The old gentleman, according to invariable custom, gave an elaborate preliminary flourish with his cane in the air, then removed his three-cornered hat in order to wipe his brow, and finally proceeded to make known his errand.  “My colleagues and myself,” began the Squire, “are burdened with momentous duties, being jointly selectmen of this village.  Our minds, for the space of three days past, have been laboriously bent on the selection of a suitable person to fill a most important office, and take upon himself a charge and rule, which, wisely considered, may be ranked no lower than those of kings and potentates.  And whereas you, our native townsman, are of good natural intellect, and well cultivated by foreign travel, and that certain vagaries and fantasies of your youth are doubtless long ago corrected; taking all these matters, I say, into due consideration, we are of opinion that Providence Lath sent you hither, at this juncture, for our very purpose.”  During this harangue, Cranfield gazed fixedly at the speaker, as if he beheld something mysterious and unearthly in his pompous little figure, and as if the Squire had worn the flowing robes of an ancient sage, instead of a square-skirted coat, flapped waistcoat, velvet breeches, and silk stockings.  Nor was his wonder without sufficient cause; for the flourish of the Squire’s staff, marvellous to relate, had described precisely the signal in the air which was to ratify the message of the prophetic Sage, whom Cranfield had sought around the world.  “And what,” inquired Ralph Cranfield, with a tremor in his voice,--“what may this office be, which is to equal me with kings and potentates?”  “No less than instructor of our village school,” answered Squire Hawkwood; “the office being now vacant by the loath of the venerable Master Whitaker, after a fifty years’ incumbency.”  “I will consider of your proposal,” replied Ralph Cranfield, hurriedly, “and will make known my decision within three days.”  After a few more words, the village dignitary and his companions took their leave.  But to Cranfield’s fancy their images were still present, and became more and more invested with the dim awfulness of figures which had first appeared to him in a dream, and afterwards had shown themselves in his waking moments, assuming homely aspects among familiar things.  His mind dwelt upon the features of the Squire, till they grew confused with those of the visionary Sage, and one appeared but the shadow of the other.  The same visage, he now thought, had looked forth upon him from the Pyramid of Cheops; the same form had beckoned to him among the colonnades of the Alhambra; the same figure had mistily revealed itself through the ascending steam of the Great Geyser.  At every effort of his memory he recognized some trait of the dreamy Messenger of Destiny, in this pompous, bustling, self-important, little great man of the village.  Amid such musings Ralph Cranfield sat all day in the cottage, scarcely hearing and vaguely answering his mother’s thousand questions about his travels and adventures.  At sunset he roused himself to take a stroll, and, passing the aged elm-tree, his eye was again caught by the semblance of a hand, pointing downward at the half-obliterated inscription. As Cranfield walked down the street of the village, the level sunbeams threw his shadow far before him; and he fancied that, as his shadow walked among distant objects, so had there been a presentiment stalking in advance of him throughout his life.  And when he drew near each object, over which his tall shadow had preceded him, still it proved to be--one of the familiar recollections of his infancy and youth. Every crook in the pathway was remembered.  Even the more transitory characteristics of the scene were the same as in bygone days.  A company of cows were grazing on the grassy roadside, and refreshed him with their fragrant breath.   “It is sweeter,” thought he, “than the perfume which was wafted to our shipp from the Spice Islands.”  The round little figure of a child rolled from a doorway, and lay laughing almost beneath Cranfield’s feet.  The dark and stately man stooped down, and, lifting the infant, restored him to his mother’s arms.  “The children,” said he to himself, and sighed, and smiled,--“the children are to be my charge!”  And while a flow of natural feeling gushed like a wellspring in his heart, he came to a dwelling which he could nowise forbear to enter.  A sweet voice, which seemed to come from a deep and tender soul, was warbling a plaintive little air, within.  He bent his head, and passed through the lowly door.  As his foot sounded upon the threshold, a young woman advanced from the dusky interior of the house, at first hastily, and then with a more uncertain step, till they met face to face.  There was a singular contrast in their two figures; he dark and picturesque,--one who had battled with the world,--whom all suns had shone upon, and whom all winds had blown on a varied course; she neat, comely, and quiet,--quiet even in her agitation,--as if all her emotions had been subdued to the peaceful tenor of her life.  Yet their faces, all unlike as they were, had an expression that seemed not so alien,--a glow of kindred feeling, flashing upward anew from half-extinguished embers.  “You are welcome home!” said Faith Egerton.  But Cranfield did not immediately answer; for his eye had been caught by an ornament in the shape of a Heart, which Faith wore as a brooch upon her bosom.  The material was the ordinary white quartz; and he recollected having himself shaped it out of one of those Indian arrowheads, which are so often found in the ancient haunts of the red men.  It was precisely on the pattern of that worn by the visionary Maid.  When Cranfield departed on his shadowy search he had bestowed this brooch, in a gold setting, as a parting gift to Faith Egerton.  “So, Faith, you have kept the Heart!” said he, at length.  “Yes,” said she, blushing deeply; then more gayly, “and what else have you brought me from beyond the sea?”  “Faith!” replied Ralph Cranfield, uttering the fated words by an uncontrollable impulse,  “I have brought you nothing but a heavy heart!  May I rest its weight on you?”  “This token, which I have worn so long,” said Faith, laying her tremulous finger on the Heart, “is the assurance that you may!”  “Faith! Faith!” cried Cranfield, clasping her in his arms, “you have interpreted my wild and weary dream!”  Yes, the wild dreamer was awake at last.  To find the mysterious treasure, he was to till the earth around his mother’s dwelling, and reap its products!  Instead of warlike command, or regal or religious sway, he was to rule over the village children!  And now the visionary Maid had faded from his fancy, and in her place he saw the playmate of his childhood!  Would all, who cherish such wild wishes, but look around them, they would oftenest find their sphere of duty, of prosperity, and happiness within those precincts, and in that station where Providence itself has cast their lot.

At the slightest interruption, whether from great, naughty Primrose, little Dandelion, or any other, I shall bite the story short off between my teeth, and swallow the untold part.  But, in the first place, do any of you know what a Gorgon is?”  “I do,” said Primrose.  “Then hold your tongue!” rejoined Eustace, who had rather she would have known nothing about the matter.  “Hold all your tongues, and I shall tell you a sweet pretty story of a Gorgon’s head.”  And so he did, as you may begin to read on the next page.  Working up his sophomorical erudition with a good deal of tact, and incurring great obligations to Professor Anthon, he, nevertheless, disregarded all classical authorities, whenever the vagrant audacity of his imagination impelled him to do so.    THE GORGON’S HEAD.  Perseus was the son of Danae, who was the daughter of a king.  And when Perseus was a very little boy, some wicked people put his mother and himself into a chest, and set them afloat upon the sea.  The wind blew freshly, and drove the chest away from the shore, and the uneasy billows tossed it up and down; while Danae clasped her child closely to her bosom, and dreaded that some big wave would dash its foamy crest over them both.  The chest sailed on, however, and neither sank nor was upset; until, when night was coming, it floated so near an island that it got entangled in a fisherman’s nets, and was drawn out high and dry upon the sand.  The island was called Seriphus, and it was reigned over by King Polydectes, who happened to be the fisherman’s brother.  This fisherman, I am glad to tell you, was an exceedingly humane and upright man.  He showed great kindness to Danae and her little boy; and continued to befriend them, until Perseus had grown to be a handsome youth, very strong and active, and skilful in the use of arms.  Long before this time, King Polydectes had seen the two strangers--the mother and her child--who had come to his dominions in a floating chest.  As he was not good and kind, like his brother the fisherman, but extremely wicked, he resolved to send Perseus on a dangerous enterprise, in which he would probably be killed, and then to do some great mischief to Danae herself.  So this bad-hearted king spent a long while in considering what was the most dangerous thing that a young man could possibly undertake to perform.  At last, having hit upon an enterprise that promised to turn out as fatally as he desired, he sent for the youthful Perseus.  The young man came to the palace, and found the king sitting upon his throne.  “Perseus,” said King Polydectes, smiling craftily upon him, “you are grown up a fine young man.  You and your good mother have received a great deal of kindness from myself, as well as from my worthy brother the fisherman, and I suppose you would not be sorry to repay some of it.”  “Please your Majesty,” answered Perseus, “I would willingly risk my life to do so.”  “Well, then,” continued the king, still with a curving smile on his lips, “I have a little adventure to propose to you; and, as you are a brave and enterprising youth, you will doubtless look upon it as a great piece of good luck to have so rare an opportunity of distinguishing yourself.  You must know, my good Perseus, I think of getting married to the beautiful Princess Hippodamia; and it is customary, on these occasions, to make the bride a present of some far-fetched and elegant curiosity.  I have been a little perplexed, I must honestly confess, where to obtain anything likely to please a princess of her exquisite taste.  But, this morning, I flatter myself, I have thought of precisely the article.”  “And can I assist your Majesty in obtaining it?” cried Perseus, eagerly.  “You can, if you are as brave a youth as I believe you to be,” replied King Polydectes, with the utmost graciousness of manner.  “The bridal gift which I have set my heart on presenting to the beautiful Hippodamia is the head of the Gorgon Medusa, with the snaky locks; and I depend on you, my dear Perseus, to bring it to me.  So, as I am anxious to settle affairs with the princess, the sooner you go in quest of the Gorgon, the better I shall be pleased.”  “I will set out to-morrow morning,” answered Perseus.  “Pray do so, my gallant youth,” rejoined the king.  “And, Perseus, in cutting off the Gorgon’s head, be careful to make a clean stroke, so as not to injure its appearance.  You must bring it home in the very best condition, in order to suit the exquisite taste of the beautiful Princess Hippodamia.”  Perseus left the palace, but was scarcely out of hearing before Polydectes burst into a laugh; being greatly amused, wicked king that he was, to find how readily the young man fell into the snare.  The news quickly spread abroad, that Perseus had undertaken to cut off the head of Medusa with the snaky locks.  Everybody was rejoiced; for most of the inhabitants of the island were as wicked as the king himself, and would have liked nothing better than to see some enormous mischief happen to Danae and her son.  The only good man in this unfortunate island of Seriphus appears to have been the fisherman.  As Perseus walked along, therefore, the people pointed after him, and made mouths, and winked to one another, and ridiculed him as loudly as they dared.  “Ho, ho!” cried they; “Medusa’s snakes will sting him soundly!”  Now, there were three Gorgons alive, at that period; and they were the most strange and terrible monsters that had ever been since the world was made, or that have been seen in after days, or that are likely to be seen in all time to come.  I hardly know what sort of creature or hobgoblin to call them.  They were three sisters, and seem to have borne some distant resemblance to women, but were really a very frightful and mischievous species of dragon.  It is, indeed, difficult to imagine what hideous beings these three sisters were.  Why, instead of locks of hair, if you can believe me, they had each of them a hundred enormous snakes growing on their heads, all alive, twisting, wriggling, curling, and thrusting out their venomous’ tongues, with forked stings at the end! The teeth of the Gorgons were terribly long tusks; their hands were made of brass; and their bodies were all over scales, which, if not iron, were something as hard and impenetrable.  They had wings, too, and exceedingly splendid ones, I can assure you; for every feather in them was pure, bright, glittering, burnished gold, and they looked very dazzlingly, no doubt, when the Gorgons were flying about in the sunshine.  But when people happened to catch a glimpse of their glittering brightness, aloft in the air, they seldom stopped to gaze, but ran and hid themselves as speedily as they could.  You will think, perhaps, that they were afraid of being stung by the serpents that served the Gorgons instead of hair,--or of having their heads bitten off by their ugly tusks,--or of being torn all to pieces by their brazen claws.  Well, to be sure, these were some of the dangers, but by no means the greatest, nor the most difficult to avoid.  For the worst thing about these abominable Gorgons was, that, if once a poor mortal fixed his eyes full upon one of their faces, he was certain, that very instant, to be changed from warm flesh and blood into cold and lifeless stone!  Thus, as you will easily perceive, it was a very dangerous adventure that the wicked King Polydectes had contrived for this innocent young man.  Perseus himself, when he had thought over the matter, could not help seeing that he had very little chance of coming safely through it, and that he was far more likely to become a stone image than to bring back the head of Medusa with the snaky locks.  For, not to speak of other difficulties, there was one which it would have puzzled an older man than Perseus to get over.  Not only must he fight with and slay this golden-winged, iron-scaled, long-tusked, brazen-clawed, snaky-haired monster, but he must do it with his eyes shut, or, at least, without so much as a glance at the enemy with whom he was contending.  Else, while his arm was lifted to strike, he would stiffen into stone, and stand with that uplifted arm for centuries, until time, and the wind and weather, should crumble him quite away.  This would be a very sad thing to befall a young mail who wanted to perform a great many brave deeds, and to enjoy a great deal of happiness, in this bright and beautiful world.  So disconsolate did these thoughts make him, that Perseus could not bear to tell his another what he had undertaken to do.  He therefore took his shield, girded on his sword, and crossed over from the island to the mainland, where he sat down in a solitary place, and hardly refrained from shedding tears.  But, while he was in this sorrowful mood, he heard a voice close beside him.  “Perseus,” said the voice, “why are you sad?”  He lifted his head from his hands, in which he had hidden it, and, behold! all alone as Perseus had supposed himself to be, there was a stranger in the solitary place.  It was a brisk, intelligent, and remarkably shrewd-looking young man, with a cloak over his shoulders, an odd sort of cap on his head, a strangely twisted staff in his hand, and a short and very crooked sword hanging by his side.  He was exceedingly light and active in his figure, like a person much accustomed to gymnastic exercises, and well able to leap or run.  Above all, the stranger had such a cheerful, knowing, and helpful aspect (though it was certainly a little mischievous, into the bargain), that Perseus could not help feeling his spirits grow livelier, as he gazed at him.  Besides, being really a courageous youth, he felt greatly ashamed that anybody should have found him with tears in his eyes, like a timid little school-boy, when, after all, there might be no occasion for despair.  So Perseus wiped his eyes, and answered the"]]]
