That was the first time he had ever seen the Northern coast, and the strange glamour and romance of this stretch of it appealed strongly to his artistic senses. He found himself standing high above the landward extremity of a narrow bay or creek, much resembling a Norwegian fiord in its general outlines; it ran in from the sea between high shelving cliffs, the slopes of which were thickly wooded with the hardier varieties of tree and shrub, through which at intervals great, gaunt masses of grey rock cropped out. On the edge of the water at either side of the bay were lines of ancient houses and cottages of grey walls and red roofs, built and grouped with the irregularity of individual liking; on the north side rose the square tower and low nave of a venerable church; amidst a mass of wood on the opposite side stood a great Norman keep, half ruinous, which looked down on a picturesque house at its foot. Quays, primitive and quaint, ran along between the old cottages and the water's edge; in the bay itself or nestling against the worn timbers of the quays, were small craft whose red sails hung idly against their tall masts and spars. And at the end of the quays and the wooded promontories which terminated the land view, lay the North Sea, cold, grey, and mysterious in the waning October light, and out of its bosom rose, close to the shore, great masses of high grey rocks, strong and fantastic of shape, and further away, almost indistinct in the distance, an island, on the highest point of which the ruins of some old religious house were silhouetted against the horizon.  \"Just the place!\" repeated Stafford. \"He'd have cheerfully travelled a thousand miles to see this. And now--we know he came here--what we next want to know is, what he did when he got here?\"  Copplestone, who had been taking in every detail of the scene before him, pointed to a house of many gables and queer chimneys which stood a little way beneath them at the point where the waters of a narrow stream ran into the bay.  \"That looks like an inn,\" he said. \"I think I can make out a sign on the gable-end. Let's go down there and inquire. He would get here just about time for lunch, wouldn't he, and he'd probably turn in there. Also--they may have a telephone there, and you can call up the theatre at Norcaster and find out if anything's been heard yet.\"  Stafford smiled approvingly and started out in the direction of the buildings towards which Copplestone had pointed.  \"Excellent notion!\" he said. \"You're quite a business man--an unusual thing in authors, isn't it? Come on, then--and that is an inn, too--I can make out the sign now--The 'Admiral's Arms'--Mary Wooler. Let's hope Mary Wooler, who's presumably the landlady, can give us some useful news!\"  The \"Admiral's Arms\" proved to be an old-fashioned, capacious hostelry, eminently promising and comfortable in appearance, which stood on the edge of a broad shelf of headland, and commanded a fine view of the little village and the bay. Stafford and Copplestone, turning in at the front door, found themselves in a deep, stone-paved hall, on one side of which, behind a bar window, a pleasant-faced, buxom woman, silk-aproned and smartly-capped, was busily engaged in adding up columns of figures in a big account-book. At sight of strangers she threw open a door and smilingly invited them to walk into a snugly furnished bar-parlour where a bright fire burned in an open hearth. Stafford gave his companion a look--this again was just the sort of old-world place which would appeal to Basset Oliver, supposing he had come across it.  \"I wonder if you can give me some information?\" he asked presently, when the good-looking landlady had attended to their requests for refreshment. \"I suppose you are the landlady--Mrs. Wooler? Well, now, Mrs. Wooler, did you have a tall, handsome, slightly grey-haired gentleman in here to lunch yesterday--say about one o'clock?\"  The landlady turned on her questioner with an intelligent smile.  \"You mean Mr. Oliver, the actor?\" she said.  \"Good!\" exclaimed Stafford, with a hearty sigh of relief. \"I do! You know him, then?\"  \"I've often seen him, both at Northborough and at Norcaster,\" replied Mrs. Wooler. \"But I never saw him here before yesterday. Oh, yes! of course I knew him as soon as he walked in, and I had a bit of chat with him before he went out, and he remarked that though he'd been coming into these parts for some years, he'd never been to Scarhaven before--usually, he said, he'd gone inland of a Sunday, amongst the hills. Oh, yes, he was here--he had lunch here.\"  \"We're seeking him,\" said Stafford, going directly to the question. \"He ought to have turned up at the 'Angel Hotel' at Norcaster last night, and at the theatre today at noon--he did neither. I'm his business manager, Mrs. Wooler. Now can you tell us anything--more than you've already told, I mean?\"  The landlady, whose face expressed more and more concern as Stafford spoke, shook her head.  \"I can't!\" she answered. \"I don't know any more. He was here perhaps an hour or so. Then he went away, saying he was going to have a look round the place. I expected he'd come in again on his way to the station, but he never did. Dear, dear! I hope nothing's happened to him--such a fine, pleasant man. And--\"  \"And--what?\" asked Stafford.  \"These cliffs and rocks are so dangerous,\" murmured Mrs. Wooler. \"I often say that no stranger ought to go alone here. They aren't safe, these cliffs.\"  Stafford set down his glass and rose.  \"I think you've got a telephone in your hall,\" he said. \"I'll just call up Norcaster and find out if they've heard anything. If they haven't--\"  He shook his head and went out, and Copplestone glanced at the landlady.  \"You say the cliffs are dangerous,\" he said. \"Are they particularly so?\"  \"To people who don't know them, yes,\" she replied. \"They ought to be protected, but then, of course, we don't get many tourists here, and the Scarhaven people know the danger spots well enough. Then again at the end of the south promontory there, beyond the Keep--\"  \"Is the Keep that high square tower amongst the woods?\" asked Copplestone.  \"That's it--it's all that's left of the old castle,\" answered Mrs. Wooler. \"Well, off the point beneath that, there's a group of rocks--you'd perhaps noticed them as you came down from the station? They've various names--there's the King, the Queen, the Sugar-Loaf, and so on. At low tide you can walk across to them. And of course, some people like to climb them. Now, they're particularly dangerous! On the Queen rock there's a great hole called the Devil's Spout, up which the sea rushes. Everybody wants to look over it, you know, and if a man was there alone, and his foot slipped, and he fell, why--\"  Stafford came back, looking more cast down than ever.  \"They've heard nothing there,\" he announced. \"Come on--we'll go down and see if we can hear anything from any of the people. We'll call in and see you later, Mrs. Wooler, and if you can make any inquiries in the meantime, do. Look here,\" he went on, when he and Copplestone had got outside, \"you take this south side of the bay, and I'll take the north. Ask anybody you see--any likely person--fishermen and so on. Then come back here. And if we've heard nothing--\"  He shook his head significantly, as he turned away, and Copplestone, taking the other direction, felt that the manager's despondency was influencing himself. A sudden disappearance of this sort was surely not to be explained easily--nothing but exceptional happenings could have kept Bassett Oliver from the scene of his week's labours. There must have been an accident--it needed little imagination to conjure up its easy occurrence. A too careless step, a too near approach, a loose stone, a sudden giving way of crumbling soil, the shifting of an already detached rock--any of these things might happen, and then--but the thought of what might follow cast a greyer tint over the already cold and grey sea.  He went on amongst the old cottages and fishing huts which lay at the foot of the wooded heights on the tops of whose pines and firs the gaunt ruins of the old Keep seemed to stand sentinel. He made inquiry at open doors and of little groups of men gathered on the quay and by the drawn-up boats--nobody knew anything. According to what they told him, most of these people had been out and about all the previous afternoon; it had been a particularly fine day, that Sunday, and they had all been out of doors, on the quay and the shore, in the sunshine. But nobody had any recollection of the man described, and Copplestone came to the conclusion that Oliver had not chosen that side of the bay. There was, however, one objection to that theory--so far as he could judge, that side was certainly the more attractive. And he himself went on to the end of it--on until he had left quay and village far behind, and had come to a spit of sand which ran out into the sea exactly opposite the group of rocks of which Mrs. Wooler had spoken. There they lay, rising out of the surf like great monsters, a half-mile from where he stood. The tide was out at that time, and between him and them stretched a shining expanse of glittering wet sand. And, coming straight towards him across it, Copplestone saw the slim and graceful figure of a girl.     CHAPTER III  THE MAN WHO KNEW SOMETHING   It was not from any idle curiosity that Copplestone made up his mind to await the girl's nearer approach. There was no other human being in view, and he was anxious to get some information about the rocks whose grim outlines were rapidly becoming faint and indistinct in the gathering darkness. And so as the girl came towards him, picking her way across the pools which lay"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/982"],["title","The Book of Nonsense (#1)"],["body","was calm,                And observed all the ruins of Philae.     40.

There was an Old Man with a poker,                Who painted his face with red oker;                When they said, \"You're a Guy!\"                He made no reply,                But knocked them all down with his poker.     45.                 There was an Old Person of Prague,                Who was suddenly seized with the plague;                But they gave him some butter,                Which caused him to mutter,                And cured that Old Person of Prague.     46.                 There was an Old Man of the North,                Who fell into a basin of broth;                But a laudable cook,                Fished him out with a hook,                Which saved that Old Man of the North.     47.                 There was a Young Lady of Poole,                Whose soup was excessively cool;                So she put it to boil,                By the aid of some oil,                That ingenious Young Lady of Poole.     48.                 There was an Old Person of Mold,                Who shrank from sensations of cold;                So he purchased some muffs,                Some furs and some fluffs,                And wrapped himself from the cold.     49.                 There was an Old Man or Nepaul,                From his horse had a terrible fall;                But, though split quite in two,                By some very strong glue,                They mended that Man of Nepaul.     50.                 There was an old Man of th' Abruzzi,                So blind that he couldn't his foot see;                When they said, \"That's your toe,\"                He replied, \"Is it so?\"                That doubtful old Man of th' Abruzzi.     51.                 There was an Old Person of Rhodes,                Who strongly objected to toads;                He paid several cousins,                To catch them by dozens,                That futile Old Person of Rhodes.     52.

There was an Old Man of Melrose,                Who walked on the tips of his toes;                But they said, \"It ain't pleasant,                To see you at present,                You stupid Old Man of Melrose.\"     54.                 There was a Young Lady of Lucca,                Whose lovers completely forsook her;                She ran up a tree,                And said, \"Fiddle-de-dee!\"                Which embarrassed the people of Lucca.     55.

There was an Old Man of Coblenz,                The length of whose legs was immense;                He went with one prance,                From Turkey to France,                That surprising Old Man of Coblenz.     70.                 There was an Old Man of Calcutta,                Who perpetually ate bread and butter;                Till a great bit of muffin,                On which he was stuffing,                Choked that horrid old man of Calcutta.     71.                 There was an Old Man in a pew,                Whose waistcoat was spotted with blue;                But he tore it in pieces,                To give to his nieces,--                That cheerful Old Man in a pew.     72.                 There was an Old Man who said, \"How,--                Shall I flee from this horrible Cow?                I will sit on this stile,                And continue to smile,                Which may soften the heart of that Cow.\"     73.                 There was a Young Lady of Hull,                Who was chased by a virulent Bull;                But she seized on a spade,                And called out--\"Who's afraid!\"                Which distracted that virulent Bull.     74.                 There was an Old Man of Whitehaven,                Who danced a quadrille with a Raven;                But they said--\"It's absurd,                To encourage this bird!\"                So they smashed that Old Man of Whitehaven.     75.

I have married a black!\"                Which distressed that Old Man of Jamaica.     78.                 There was an old person of Dutton,                Whose head was so small as a button;                So to make it look big,                He purchased a wig,                And rapidly rushed about Dutton.     79.                 There was a Young Lady of Tyre,                Who swept the loud chords of a lyre;                At the sound of each sweep,                She enraptured the deep,                And enchanted the city of Tyre.     80.                 There was an Old Man who said, \"Hush!                I perceive a young bird in this bush!\"                When they said--\"Is it small?\"                He replied--\"Not at all!                It is four times as big as the bush!\"     81.                 There "]]]
