VALDES. Then haste thee to some solitary grove,      And bear wise Bacon's and Albertus'[42] works,      The Hebrew Psalter, and New Testament;      And whatsoever else is requisite      We will inform thee ere our conference cease.       CORNELIUS. Valdes, first let him know the words of art;      And then, all other ceremonies learn'd,      Faustus may try his cunning[43] by himself.       VALDES. First I'll instruct thee in the rudiments,      And then wilt thou be perfecter than I.       FAUSTUS. Then come and dine with me, and, after meat,      We'll canvass every quiddity thereof;      For, ere I sleep, I'll try what I can do:      This night I'll conjure, though I die therefore.           [Exeunt.]            Enter two SCHOLARS.[44]       FIRST SCHOLAR. I wonder what's become of Faustus, that was wont      to make our schools ring with sic probo.       SECOND SCHOLAR. That shall we know, for see, here comes his boy.            Enter WAGNER.       FIRST SCHOLAR. How now, sirrah! where's thy master?       WAGNER. God in heaven knows.       SECOND SCHOLAR. Why, dost not thou know?       WAGNER. Yes, I know; but that follows not.       FIRST SCHOLAR. Go to, sirrah! leave your jesting, and tell us      where he is.       WAGNER. That follows not necessary by force of argument, that you,      being licentiates, should stand upon:[45]  therefore acknowledge      your error, and be attentive.       SECOND SCHOLAR. Why, didst thou not say thou knewest?       WAGNER. Have you any witness on't?       FIRST SCHOLAR. Yes, sirrah, I heard you.       WAGNER. Ask my fellow if I be a thief.       SECOND SCHOLAR. Well, you will not tell us?       WAGNER. Yes, sir, I will tell you:  yet, if you were not dunces,      you would never ask me such a question; for is not he corpus      naturale? and is not that mobile? then wherefore should you      ask me such a question?  But that I am by nature phlegmatic,      slow to wrath, and prone to lechery (to love, I would say),      it were not for you to come within forty foot of the place      of execution, although I do not doubt to see you both hanged      the next sessions.  Thus having triumphed over you, I will set      my countenance like a precisian, and begin to speak thus:--      Truly, my dear brethren, my master is within at dinner,      with Valdes and Cornelius, as this wine, if it could speak,      would[46] inform your worships:  and so, the Lord bless you,      preserve you, and keep you, my dear brethren, my dear brethren![47]           [Exit.]       FIRST SCHOLAR. Nay, then, I fear he is fallen into that damned art      for which they two are infamous through the world.       SECOND SCHOLAR. Were he a stranger, and not allied to me, yet should      I grieve for him. But, come, let us go and inform the Rector,      and see if he by his grave counsel can reclaim him.       FIRST SCHOLAR. O, but I fear me nothing can reclaim him!       SECOND SCHOLAR. Yet let us try what we can do.           [Exeunt.]            Enter FAUSTUS to conjure.[48]       FAUSTUS. Now that the gloomy shadow of the earth,      Longing to view Orion's drizzling look,      Leaps from th' antartic world unto the sky,      And dims the welkin with her pitchy breath,      Faustus, begin thine incantations,      And try if devils will obey thy hest,      Seeing thou hast pray'd and sacrific'd to them.      Within this circle is Jehovah's name,      Forward and backward anagrammatiz'd,[49]      Th' abbreviated[50] names of holy saints,      Figures of every adjunct to the heavens,      And characters of signs and erring[51] stars,      By which the spirits are enforc'd to rise:      Then fear not, Faustus, but be resolute,      And try the uttermost magic can perform.--      Sint mihi dei Acherontis propitii!  Valeat numen triplex Jehovoe!      Ignei, aerii, aquatani spiritus, salvete!  Orientis princeps      Belzebub, inferni ardentis monarcha, et Demogorgon, propitiamus      vos, ut appareat et surgat Mephistophilis, quod tumeraris:[52]      per Jehovam, Gehennam, et consecratam aquam quam nunc spargo,      signumque crucis quod nunc facio, et per vota nostra, ipse nunc      surgat nobis dicatus[53] Mephistophilis!            Enter MEPHISTOPHILIS.       I charge thee to return, and change thy shape;      Thou art too ugly to attend on me:      Go, and return an old Franciscan friar;      That holy shape becomes a devil best.           [Exit MEPHISTOPHILIS.]       I see there's virtue in my heavenly words:      Who would not be proficient in this art?      How pliant is this Mephistophilis,      Full of obedience and humility!      Such is the force of magic and my spells:      No, Faustus, thou art conjuror laureat,      That canst command great Mephistophilis:      Quin regis Mephistophilis fratris imagine.            Re-enter MEPHISTOPHILIS like a Franciscan friar.[54]       MEPHIST. Now, Faustus, what wouldst thou have me do?       FAUSTUS. I charge thee wait upon me whilst I live,      To do whatever Faustus shall command,      Be it to make the moon drop from her sphere,      Or the ocean to overwhelm the world.       MEPHIST. I am a servant to great Lucifer,      And may not follow thee without his leave:      No more than he commands must we perform.       FAUSTUS. Did not he charge thee to appear to me?       MEPHIST. No, I came hither[55] of mine own accord.       FAUSTUS. Did not my conjuring speeches raise thee? speak.       MEPHIST. That was the cause, but yet per accidens;[56]      For, when we hear one rack the name of God,      Abjure the Scriptures and his Saviour Christ,      We fly, in hope to get his glorious soul;      Nor will we come, unless he use such means      Whereby he is in danger to be damn'd.      Therefore the shortest cut for conjuring      Is stoutly to abjure the Trinity,      And pray devoutly to the prince of hell.       FAUSTUS. So Faustus hath      Already done; and holds this principle,      There is no chief but only Belzebub;      To whom Faustus doth dedicate himself.      This word \"damnation\" terrifies not him,      For he confounds hell in Elysium:      His ghost be with the old philosophers!      But, leaving these vain trifles of men's souls,      Tell me what is that Lucifer thy lord?       MEPHIST. Arch-regent and commander of all spirits.       FAUSTUS. Was not that Lucifer an angel once?       MEPHIST. Yes, Faustus, and most dearly lov'd of God.       FAUSTUS. How comes it, then, that he is prince of devils?       MEPHIST. O, by aspiring pride and insolence;      For which God threw him from the face of heaven.       FAUSTUS. And what are you that live with Lucifer?       MEPHIST. Unhappy spirits that fell with Lucifer,      Conspir'd against our God with Lucifer,      And are for ever damn'd with Lucifer.       FAUSTUS. Where are you damn'd?       MEPHIST. In hell.       FAUSTUS. How comes it, then, that thou art out of hell?       MEPHIST. Why, this is hell, nor am I out of it:[57]      Think'st thou that I, who saw the face of God,      And tasted the eternal joys of heaven,      Am not tormented with ten thousand hells,      In being depriv'd of everlasting bliss?      O, Faustus, leave these frivolous demands,      Which strike a terror to my fainting soul!       FAUSTUS. What, is great Mephistophilis so passionate      For being deprived of the joys of heaven?      Learn thou of Faustus manly fortitude,      And scorn those joys thou never shalt possess.      Go bear these[58] tidings to great Lucifer:      Seeing Faustus hath incurr'd eternal death      By desperate thoughts against Jove's[59] deity,      Say, he surrenders up to him his soul,      So he will spare him four and twenty[60] years,      Letting him live in all voluptuousness;      Having thee ever to attend on me,      To give me whatsoever I shall ask,      To tell me whatsoever I demand,      To slay mine enemies, and aid my friends,      And always be obedient to my will.      Go and return to mighty Lucifer,      And meet me in my study at midnight,      And then resolve[61] me of thy master's mind.       MEPHIST. I will, Faustus.           [Exit.]       FAUSTUS. Had I as many souls as there be stars,      I'd give them all for Mephistophilis.      By him I'll be great emperor of the world,      And make a bridge thorough[62] the moving air,      To pass the ocean with a band of men;      I'll join the hills that bind the Afric shore,      And make that country[63] continent to Spain,      And both contributory to my crown:      The Emperor shall not live but by my leave,      Nor any potentate of Germany.      Now that I have obtain'd what I desir'd,[64]      I'll live in speculation of this art,      Till Mephistophilis return again.           [Exit.]            Enter WAGNER[65] and CLOWN.       WAGNER. Sirrah boy, come hither.       CLOWN. How, boy! swowns, boy!  I hope you have seen many boys      with such pickadevaunts[66] as I have:  boy, quotha!       WAGNER. Tell me, sirrah, hast thou any comings in?       CLOWN. Ay, and goings out too; you may see else.       WAGNER. Alas, poor slave! see how poverty jesteth in his nakedness!      the villain is bare and out of service, and so hungry, that I know      he would give his soul to the devil for a shoulder of mutton,      though it were blood-raw.       CLOWN. How! my soul to the devil for a shoulder of mutton, though      'twere blood-raw! not so, good friend:  by'r lady,[67] I had need      have it well roasted, and good sauce to it, if I pay so dear.       WAGNER. Well, wilt thou serve me, and I'll make thee go like      Qui mihi discipulus?[68]       CLOWN. How, in verse?       WAGNER. No, sirrah; in beaten silk and staves-acre.[69]       CLOWN. How, how, knaves-acre! ay, I thought that was all the land      his father left him.  Do you hear?  I would be sorry to rob you of    "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/779"],["title","The Tragical History of Doctor Faustus (#2)"],["body","  your living.       WAGNER. Sirrah, I say in staves-acre.       CLOWN. Oho, oho, staves-acre! why, then, belike, if I were your      man, I should be full of vermin.[70]       WAGNER. So thou shalt, whether thou beest with me or no.  But,      sirrah, leave your jesting, and bind yourself presently unto me      for seven years, or I'll turn all the lice about thee into      familiars,[71] and they shall tear thee in pieces.       CLOWN. Do you hear, sir? you may save that labour; they are too      familiar with me already:  swowns, they are as bold with my flesh      as if they had paid for their[72] meat and drink.       WAGNER. Well, do you hear, sirrah? hold, take these guilders.           [Gives money.]       CLOWN. Gridirons! what be they?       WAGNER. Why, French crowns.       CLOWN. Mass, but for the name of French crowns, a man were as good      have as many English counters.  And what should I do with these?       WAGNER. Why, now, sirrah, thou art at an hour's warning, whensoever      or wheresoever the devil shall fetch thee.       CLOWN. No, no; here, take your gridirons again.       WAGNER. Truly, I'll none of them.       CLOWN. Truly, but you shall.       WAGNER. Bear witness I gave them him.       CLOWN. Bear witness I give them you again.       WAGNER. Well, I will cause two devils presently to fetch thee      away.--Baliol and Belcher!       CLOWN. Let your Baliol and your Belcher come here, and I'll      knock them, they were never so knocked since they were devils:      say I should kill one of them, what would folks say?  \"Do ye see      yonder tall fellow in the round slop?[73] he has killed the devil.\"      So I should be called Kill-devil all the parish over.            Enter two DEVILS; and the CLOWN runs up and down crying.       WAGNER. Baliol and Belcher,--spirits, away!           [Exeunt DEVILS.]       CLOWN. What, are they gone? a vengeance on them! they have vile[74]      long nails.  There was a he-devil and a she-devil:  I'll tell you      how you shall know them; all he-devils has horns, and all      she-devils has clifts and cloven feet.       WAGNER. Well, sirrah, follow me.       CLOWN. But, do you hear? if I should serve you, would you teach      me to raise up Banios and Belcheos?       WAGNER. I will teach thee to turn thyself to any thing, to a dog,      or a cat, or a mouse, or a rat, or any thing.       CLOWN. How! a Christian fellow to a dog, or a cat, a mouse,      or a rat! no, no, sir; if you turn me into any thing, let it be      in the likeness of a little pretty frisking flea, that I may be      here and there and every where:  O, I'll tickle the pretty wenches'      plackets!  I'll be amongst them, i'faith.       WAGNER. Well, sirrah, come.       CLOWN. But, do you hear, Wagner?       WAGNER. How!--Baliol and Belcher!       CLOWN. O Lord!  I pray, sir, let Banio and Belcher go sleep.       WAGNER. Villain, call me Master Wagner, and let thy left eye be      diametarily fixed upon my right heel, with quasi vestigiis      nostris[75] insistere.           [Exit.]       CLOWN. God forgive me, he speaks Dutch fustian.  Well, I'll follow      him; I'll serve him, that's flat.           [Exit.]            FAUSTUS discovered in his study.       FAUSTUS. Now, Faustus, must      Thou needs be damn'd, and canst thou not be sav'd:      What boots it, then, to think of God or heaven?      Away with such vain fancies, and despair;      Despair in God, and trust in Belzebub:      Now go not backward; no, Faustus, be resolute:      Why waver'st thou?  O, something soundeth in mine ears,      \"Abjure this magic, turn to God again!\"      Ay, and Faustus will turn to God again.      To God? he loves thee not;      The god thou serv'st is thine own appetite,      Wherein is fix'd the love of Belzebub:      To him I'll build an altar and a church,      And offer lukewarm blood of new-born babes.            Enter GOOD ANGEL and EVIL ANGEL.       GOOD ANGEL. Sweet Faustus, leave that execrable art.       FAUSTUS. Contrition, prayer, repentance--what of them?       GOOD ANGEL. O, they are means to bring thee unto heaven!       EVIL ANGEL. Rather illusions, fruits of lunacy,      That make men foolish that do trust them most.       GOOD ANGEL. Sweet Faustus, think of heaven and heavenly things.       EVIL ANGEL. No, Faustus; think of honour and of[76] wealth.           [Exeunt ANGELS.]       FAUSTUS. Of wealth!      Why, the signiory of Embden shall be mine.      When Mephistophilis shall stand by me,      What god can hurt thee, Faustus? thou art safe      Cast no more doubts.--Come, Mephistophilis,      And bring glad tidings from great Lucifer;--      Is't not midnight?--come, Mephistophilis,      Veni, veni, Mephistophile!            Enter MEPHISTOPHILIS.       Now tell me[77] what says Lucifer, thy lord?       MEPHIST. That I shall wait on Faustus whilst he lives,[78]      So he will buy my service with his soul.       FAUSTUS. Already Faustus hath hazarded that for thee.       MEPHIST. But, Faustus, thou must bequeath it solemnly,      And write a deed of gift with thine own blood;      For that security craves great Lucifer.      If thou deny it, I will back to hell.       FAUSTUS. Stay, Mephistophilis, and tell me, what good will my soul      do thy lord?       MEPHIST. Enlarge his kingdom.       FAUSTUS. Is that the reason why[79] he tempts us thus?       MEPHIST. Solamen miseris socios habuisse doloris.[80]       FAUSTUS. Why,[81] have you any pain that torture[82] others!       MEPHIST. As great as have the human souls of men.      But, tell me, Faustus, shall I have thy soul?      And I will be thy slave, and wait on thee,      And give thee more than thou hast wit to ask.       FAUSTUS. Ay, Mephistophilis, I give it thee.       MEPHIST. Then, Faustus,[83] stab thine arm courageously,      And bind thy soul, that at some certain day      Great Lucifer may claim it as his own;      And then be thou as great as Lucifer.       FAUSTUS. [Stabbing his arm] Lo, Mephistophilis, for love of thee,      I cut mine arm, and with my proper blood      Assure my soul to be great Lucifer's,      Chief lord and regent of perpetual night!      View here the blood that trickles from mine arm,      And let it be propitious for my wish.       MEPHIST. But, Faustus, thou must      Write it in manner of a deed of gift.       FAUSTUS. Ay, so I will [Writes].  But, Mephistophilis,      My blood congeals, and I can write no more.       MEPHIST. I'll fetch thee fire to dissolve it straight.           [Exit.]       FAUSTUS. What might the staying of my blood portend?      Is it unwilling I should write this bill?[84]      Why streams it not, that I may write afresh?      FAUSTUS GIVES TO THEE HIS SOUL:  ah, there it stay'd!      Why shouldst thou not? is not thy soul shine own?      Then write again, FAUSTUS GIVES TO THEE HIS SOUL.            Re-enter MEPHISTOPHILIS with a chafer of coals.       MEPHIST. Here's fire; come, Faustus, set it on.[85]       FAUSTUS. So, now the blood begins to clear again;      Now will I make an end immediately.           [Writes.]       MEPHIST. O, what will not I do to obtain his soul?           [Aside.]       FAUSTUS. Consummatum est; this bill is ended,      And Faustus hath bequeath'd his soul to Lucifer.      But what is this inscription[86] on mine arm?      Homo, fuge:  whither should I fly?      If unto God, he'll throw me[87] down to hell.      My senses are deceiv'd; here's nothing writ:--      I see it plain; here in this place is writ,      Homo, fuge:  yet shall not Faustus fly.       MEPHIST. I'll fetch him somewhat to delight his mind.           [Aside, and then exit.]            Re-enter MEPHISTOPHILIS with DEVILS, who give crowns           and rich apparel to FAUSTUS, dance, and then depart.       FAUSTUS. Speak, Mephistophilis, what means this show?       MEPHIST. Nothing, Faustus, but to delight thy mind withal,      And to shew thee what magic can perform.       FAUSTUS. But may I raise up spirits when I please?       MEPHIST. Ay, Faustus, and do greater things than these.       FAUSTUS. Then there's enough for a thousand souls.      Here, Mephistophilis, receive this scroll,      A deed of gift of body and of soul:      But yet conditionally that thou perform      All articles prescrib'd between us both.       MEPHIST. Faustus, I swear by hell and Lucifer      To effect all promises between us made!       FAUSTUS. Then hear me read them.  [Reads] ON THESE CONDITIONS      FOLLOWING.  FIRST, THAT FAUSTUS MAY BE A SPIRIT IN FORM AND      SUBSTANCE.  SECONDLY, THAT MEPHISTOPHILIS SHALL BE HIS SERVANT,      AND AT HIS COMMAND.  THIRDLY, THAT MEPHISTOPHILIS SHALL DO FOR HIM,      AND BRING HIM WHATSOEVER HE DESIRES.[88]  FOURTHLY, THAT HE SHALL      BE IN HIS CHAMBER OR HOUSE INVISIBLE.  LASTLY, THAT HE SHALL APPEAR      TO THE SAID JOHN FAUSTUS, AT ALL TIMES, IN WHAT FORM OR SHAPE      SOEVER HE PLEASE.  I, JOHN FAUSTUS, OF WERTENBERG, DOCTOR, BY      THESE PRESENTS, DO GIVE BOTH BODY AND SOUL TO LUCIFER PRINCE OF      THE EAST, AND HIS MINISTER MEPHISTOPHILIS; AND FURTHERMORE GRANT      UNTO THEM, THAT,[89] TWENTY-FOUR YEARS BEING EXPIRED, THE ARTICLES      ABOVE-WRITTEN INVIOLATE, FULL POWER TO FETCH OR CARRY THE SAID      JOHN FAUSTUS, BODY AND SOUL, FLESH, BLOOD, OR GOODS, INTO THEIR      HABITATION WHERESOEVER.  BY ME, JOHN FAUSTUS.       MEPHIST. Speak, Faustus, do you deliver this as your deed?       FAUSTUS. Ay, take it, and the devil give thee good on't!       MEPHIST. Now, Faustus, ask what thou wilt.       FAUSTUS. First will I question with thee about hell.      Tell me, where is the place that men call hell?       MEPHIST. Under the heavens.       FAUSTUS. Ay, but whereabout?       MEPHIST. Within the bowels of these[90] elements,      Where we are tortur'd and remain for ever:      Hell hath no limits, nor is circumscrib'd      In one self place; for where we are is hell,      And where hell is, there[91] must we ever be:      And, to"]]]
