There have been famous babes; for example, little Moses, from whose adventure in the bulrushes the Egyptian hierophants of seven centuries before doubtless derived their idle tale of the child Osiris being preserved on a floating lotus leaf.            Ere babes were invented           The girls were contended.           Now man is tormented   Until to buy babes he has squandered   His money.  And so I have pondered           This thing, and thought may be           'T were better that Baby   The First had been eagled or condored.  Ro Amil   BACCHUS, n.  A convenient deity invented by the ancients as an excuse for getting drunk.    Is public worship, then, a sin,       That for devotions paid to Bacchus   The lictors dare to run us in,       And resolutely thump and whack us?  Jorace   BACK, n.  That part of your friend which it is your privilege to contemplate in your adversity.  BACKBITE, v.t.  To speak of a man as you find him when he can't find you.  BAIT, n.  A preparation that renders the hook more palatable.  The best kind is beauty.  BAPTISM, n.  A sacred rite of such efficacy that he who finds himself in heaven without having undergone it will be unhappy forever.  It is performed with water in two ways--by immersion, or plunging, and by aspersion, or sprinkling.    But whether the plan of immersion   Is better than simple aspersion       Let those immersed       And those aspersed   Decide by the Authorized Version,   And by matching their agues tertian.  G.J.   BAROMETER, n.  An ingenious instrument which indicates what kind of weather we are having.  BARRACK, n.  A house in which soldiers enjoy a portion of that of which it is their business to deprive others.  BASILISK, n.  The cockatrice.  A sort of serpent hatched from the egg of a cock.  The basilisk had a bad eye, and its glance was fatal. Many infidels deny this creature's existence, but Semprello Aurator saw and handled one that had been blinded by lightning as a punishment for having fatally gazed on a lady of rank whom Jupiter loved.  Juno afterward restored the reptile's sight and hid it in a cave.  Nothing is so well attested by the ancients as the existence of the basilisk, but the cocks have stopped laying.  BASTINADO, n.  The act of walking on wood without exertion.  BATH, n.  A kind of mystic ceremony substituted for religious worship, with what spiritual efficacy has not been determined.    The man who taketh a steam bath   He loseth all the skin he hath,   And, for he's boiled a brilliant red,   Thinketh to cleanliness he's wed,   Forgetting that his lungs he's soiling   With dirty vapors of the boiling.  Richard Gwow   BATTLE, n.  A method of untying with the teeth of a political knot that would not yield to the tongue.  BEARD, n.  The hair that is commonly cut off by those who justly execrate the absurd Chinese custom of shaving the head.  BEAUTY, n.  The power by which a woman charms a lover and terrifies a husband.  BEFRIEND, v.t.  To make an ingrate.  BEG, v.  To ask for something with an earnestness proportioned to the belief that it will not be given.    Who is that, father?                         A mendicant, child,   Haggard, morose, and unaffable--wild!   See how he glares through the bars of his cell!   With Citizen Mendicant all is not well.    Why did they put him there, father?                                         Because   Obeying his belly he struck at the laws.    His belly?                Oh, well, he was starving, my boy--   A state in which, doubtless, there's little of joy.   No bite had he eaten for days, and his cry   Was \"Bread!\" ever \"Bread!\"                                What's the matter with pie?    With little to wear, he had nothing to sell;   To beg was unlawful--improper as well.    Why didn't he work?                         He would even have done that,   But men said:  \"Get out!\" and the State remarked:  \"Scat!\"   I mention these incidents merely to show   That the vengeance he took was uncommonly low.   Revenge, at the best, is the act of a Siou,   But for trifles--                        Pray what did bad Mendicant do?    Stole two loaves of bread to replenish his lack   And tuck out the belly that clung to his back.    Is that _all_ father dear?                                There's little to tell:   They sent him to jail, and they'll send him to--well,   The company's better than here we can boast,   And there's--                    Bread for the needy, dear father?                                                       Um--toast.  Atka Mip   BEGGAR, n.  One who has relied on the assistance of his friends.  BEHAVIOR, n.  Conduct, as determined, not by principle, but by breeding.  The word seems to be somewhat loosely used in Dr. Jamrach Holobom's translation of the following lines from the _Dies Irae_:        Recordare, Jesu pie,       Quod sum causa tuae viae.       Ne me perdas illa die.    Pray remember, sacred Savior,   Whose the thoughtless hand that gave your   Death-blow.  Pardon such behavior.  BELLADONNA, n.  In Italian a beautiful lady; in English a deadly poison.  A striking example of the essential identity of the two tongues.  BENEDICTINES, n.  An order of monks otherwise known as black friars.    She thought it a crow, but it turn out to be       A monk of St. Benedict croaking a text.   \"Here's one of an order of cooks,\" said she--       \"Black friars in this world, fried black in the next.\"  \"The Devil on Earth\" (London, 1712)   BENEFACTOR, n.  One who makes heavy purchases of ingratitude, without, however, materially affecting the price, which is still within the means of all.  BERENICE'S HAIR, n.  A constellation (_Coma Berenices_) named in honor of one who sacrificed her hair to save her husband.    Her locks an ancient lady gave   Her loving husband's life to save;   And men--they honored so the dame--   Upon some stars bestowed her name.    But to our modern married fair,   Who'd give their lords to save their hair,   No stellar recognition's given.   There are not stars enough in heaven.  G.J.   BIGAMY, n.  A mistake in taste for which the wisdom of the future will adjudge a punishment called trigamy.  BIGOT, n.  One who is obstinately and zealously attached to an opinion that you do not entertain.  BILLINGSGATE, n.  The invective of an opponent.  BIRTH, n.  The first and direst of all disasters.  As to the nature of it there appears to be no uniformity.  Castor and Pollux were born from the egg.  Pallas came out of a skull.  Galatea was once a block of stone.  Peresilis, who wrote in the tenth century, avers that he grew up out of the ground where a priest had spilled holy water.  It is known that Arimaxus was derived from a hole in the earth, made by a stroke of lightning.  Leucomedon was the son of a cavern in Mount Aetna, and I have myself seen a man come out of a wine cellar.  BLACKGUARD, n.  A man whose qualities, prepared for display like a box of berries in a market--the fine ones on top--have been opened on the wrong side.  An inverted gentleman.  BLANK-VERSE, n.  Unrhymed iambic pentameters--the most difficult kind of English verse to write acceptably; a kind, therefore, much affected by those who cannot acceptably write any kind.  BODY-SNATCHER, n.  A robber of grave-worms.  One who supplies the young physicians with that with which the old physicians have supplied the undertaker.  The hyena.    \"One night,\" a doctor said, \"last fall,   I and my comrades, four in all,       When visiting a graveyard stood   Within the shadow of a wall.    \"While waiting for the moon to sink   We saw a wild hyena slink       About a new-made grave, and then   Begin to excavate its brink!    \"Shocked by the horrid act, we made   A sally from our ambuscade,       And, falling on the unholy beast,   Dispatched him with a pick and spade.\"  Bettel K. Jhones   BONDSMAN, n.  A fool who, having property of his own, undertakes to become responsible for that entrusted to another to a third.  Philippe of Orleans wishing to appoint one of his favorites, a dissolute nobleman, to a high office, asked him what security he would be able to give.  \"I need no bondsmen,\" he replied, \"for I can give you my word of honor.\"  \"And pray what may be the value of that?\" inquired the amused Regent.  \"Monsieur, it is worth its weight in gold.\"  BORE, n.  A person who talks when you wish him to listen.  BOTANY, n.  The science of vegetables--those that are not good to eat, as well as those that are.  It deals largely with their flowers, which are commonly badly designed, inartistic in color, and ill-smelling.  BOTTLE-NOSED, adj.  Having a nose created in the image of its maker.  BOUNDARY, n.  In political geography, an imaginary line between two nations, separating the imaginary rights of one from the imaginary rights of the other.  BOUNTY, n.  The liberality of one who has much, in permitting one who has nothing to get all that he can.        A single swallow, it is said, devours ten millions of insects   every year.  The supplying of these insects I take to be a signal   instance of the Creator's bounty in providing for the lives of His   creatures.  Henry Ward Beecher   BRAHMA, n.  He who created the Hindoos, who are preserved by Vishnu and destroyed by Siva--a rather neater division of labor than is found among the deities of some other nations.  The Abracadabranese, for example, are created by Sin, maintained by Theft and destroyed by Folly.  The priests of Brahma, like those of Abracadabranese, are holy and learned men who are never naughty.    O Brahma, thou rare old Divinity,   First Person of the Hindoo Trinity,   You sit there so calm and securely,   With feet folded up so demurely--   You're the First Person Singular, surely.  Polydore Smith   BRAIN, n. An apparatus with which we think what we think.

But in view of Winnie’s fondness for her delicate brother, and of Mr Verloc’s kind and generous disposition, she felt that the poor boy was pretty safe in this rough world.  And in her heart of hearts she was not perhaps displeased that the Verlocs had no children.  As that circumstance seemed perfectly indifferent to Mr Verloc, and as Winnie found an object of quasi-maternal affection in her brother, perhaps this was just as well for poor Stevie.  For he was difficult to dispose of, that boy.  He was delicate and, in a frail way, good-looking too, except for the vacant droop of his lower lip.  Under our excellent system of compulsory education he had learned to read and write, notwithstanding the unfavourable aspect of the lower lip.  But as errand-boy he did not turn out a great success.  He forgot his messages; he was easily diverted from the straight path of duty by the attractions of stray cats and dogs, which he followed down narrow alleys into unsavoury courts; by the comedies of the streets, which he contemplated open-mouthed, to the detriment of his employer’s interests; or by the dramas of fallen horses, whose pathos and violence induced him sometimes to shriek pierceingly in a crowd, which disliked to be disturbed by sounds of distress in its quiet enjoyment of the national spectacle.  When led away by a grave and protecting policeman, it would often become apparent that poor Stevie had forgotten his address—at least for a time.  A brusque question caused him to stutter to the point of suffocation.  When startled by anything perplexing he used to squint horribly.  However, he never had any fits (which was encouraging); and before the natural outbursts of impatience on the part of his father he could always, in his childhood’s days, run for protection behind the short skirts of his sister Winnie.  On the other hand, he might have been suspected of hiding a fund of reckless naughtiness.  When he had reached the age of fourteen a friend of his late father, an agent for a foreign preserved milk firm, having given him an opening as office-boy, he was discovered one foggy afternoon, in his chief’s absence, busy letting off fireworks on the staircase.  He touched off in quick succession a set of fierce rockets, angry catherine wheels, loudly exploding squibs—and the matter might have turned out very serious.  An awful panic spread through the whole building.  Wild-eyed, choking clerks stampeded through the passages full of smoke, silk hats and elderly business men could be seen rolling independently down the stairs.  Stevie did not seem to derive any personal gratification from what he had done.  His motives for this stroke of originality were difficult to discover.  It was only later on that Winnie obtained from him a misty and confused confession.  It seems that two other office-boys in the building had worked upon his feelings by tales of injustice and oppression till they had wrought his compassion to the pitch of that frenzy.  But his father’s friend, of course, dismissed him summarily as likely to ruin his business.  After that altruistic exploit Stevie was put to help wash the dishes in the basement kitchen, and to black the boots of the gentlemen patronising the Belgravian mansion.  There was obviously no future in such work.  The gentlemen tipped him a shilling now and then.  Mr Verloc showed himself the most generous of lodgers.  But altogether all that did not amount to much either in the way of gain or prospects; so that when Winnie announced her engagement to Mr Verloc her mother could not help wondering, with a sigh and a glance towards the scullery, what would become of poor Stephen now.  It appeared that Mr Verloc was ready to take him over together with his wife’s mother and with the furniture, which was the whole visible fortune of the family.  Mr Verloc gathered everything as it came to his broad, good-natured breast.  The furniture was disposed to the best advantage all over the house, but Mrs Verloc’s mother was confined to two back rooms on the first floor.  The luckless Stevie slept in one of them.  By this time a growth of thin fluffy hair had come to blur, like a golden mist, the sharp line of his small lower jaw.  He helped his sister with blind love and docility in her household duties.  Mr Verloc thought that some occupation would be good for him.  His spare time he occupied by drawing circles with compass and pencil on a piece of paper.  He applied himself to that pastime with great industry, with his elbows spread out and bowed low over the kitchen table.  Through the open door of the parlour at the back of the shop Winnie, his sister, glanced at him from time to time with maternal vigilance.     CHAPTER II   Such was the house, the household, and the business Mr Verloc left behind him on his way westward at the hour of half-past ten in the morning.  It was unusually early for him; his whole person exhaled the charm of almost dewy freshness; he wore his blue cloth overcoat unbuttoned; his boots were shiny; his cheeks, freshly shaven, had a sort of gloss; and even his heavy-lidded eyes, refreshed by a night of peaceful slumber, sent out glances of comparative alertness.  Through the park railings these glances beheld men and women riding in the Row, couples cantering past harmoniously, others advancing sedately at a walk, loitering groups of three or four, solitary horsemen looking unsociable, and solitary women followed at a long distance by a groom with a cockade to his hat and a leather belt over his tight-fitting coat.  Carriages went bowling by, mostly two-horse broughams, with here and there a victoria with the skin of some wild beast inside and a woman’s face and hat emerging above the folded hood.  And a peculiarly London sun—against which nothing could be said except that it looked bloodshot—glorified all this by its stare.  It hung at a moderate elevation above Hyde Park Corner with an air of punctual and benign vigilance.  The very pavement under Mr Verloc’s feet had an old-gold tinge in that diffused light, in which neither wall, nor tree, nor beast, nor man cast a shadow.  Mr Verloc was going westward through a town without shadows in an atmosphere of powdered old gold. There were red, coppery gleams on the roofs of houses, on the corners of walls, on the panels of carriages, on the very coats of the horses, and on the broad back of Mr Verloc’s overcoat, where they produced a dull effect of rustiness.  But Mr Verloc was not in the least conscious of having got rusty.  He surveyed through the park railings the evidences of the town’s opulence and luxury with an approving eye.  All these people had to be protected.  Protection is the first necessity of opulence and luxury.  They had to be protected; and their horses, carriages, houses, servants had to be protected; and the source of their wealth had to be protected in the heart of the city and the heart of the country; the whole social order favourable to their hygienic idleness had to be protected against the shallow enviousness of unhygienic labour.  It had to—and Mr Verloc would have rubbed his hands with satisfaction had he not been constitutionally averse from every superfluous exertion.  His idleness was not hygienic, but it suited him very well.  He was in a manner devoted to it with a sort of inert fanaticism, or perhaps rather with a fanatical inertness.  Born of industrious parents for a life of toil, he had embraced indolence from an impulse as profound as inexplicable and as imperious as the impulse which directs a man’s preference for one particular woman in a given thousand.  He was too lazy even for a mere demagogue, for a workman orator, for a leader of labour. It was too much trouble.  He required a more perfect form of ease; or it might have been that he was the victim of a philosophical unbelief in the effectiveness of every human effort.  Such a form of indolence requires, implies, a certain amount of intelligence.  Mr Verloc was not devoid of intelligence—and at the notion of a menaced social order he would perhaps have winked to himself if there had not been an effort to make in that sign of scepticism.  His big, prominent eyes were not well adapted to winking.  They were rather of the sort that closes solemnly in slumber with majestic effect.  Undemonstrative and burly in a fat-pig style, Mr Verloc, without either rubbing his hands with satisfaction or winking sceptically at his thoughts, proceeded on his way.  He trod the pavement heavily with his shiny boots, and his general get-up was that of a well-to-do mechanic in business for himself.  He might have been anything from a picture-frame maker to a lock-smith; an employer of labour in a small way.  But there was also about him an indescribable air which no mechanic could have acquired in the practice of his handicraft however dishonestly exercised: the air common to men who live on the vices, the follies, or the baser fears of mankind; the air of moral nihilism common to keepers of gambling hells and disorderly houses; to private detectives and inquiry agents; to drink sellers and, I should say, to the sellers of invigorating electric belts and to the inventors of patent medicines.  But of that last I am not sure, not having carried my investigations so far into the depths. For all I know, the expression of these last may be perfectly diabolic. I shouldn’t be surprised.  What I want to affirm is that Mr Verloc’s expression was by no means diabolic.  Before reaching Knightsbridge, Mr Verloc took a turn to the left out of the busy main thoroughfare, uproarious with the traffic of swaying omnibuses and trotting vans, in the almost silent, swift flow of hansoms. Under his hat, worn with a slight backward tilt, his hair had been carefully brushed into respectful sleekness; for his business was with an Embassy.  And Mr Verloc, steady like a rock—a soft kind of rock—marched now along a street which"]]]
