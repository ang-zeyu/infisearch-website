Mom Beck had stepped into the pantry for more eggs for the cake she was making.  \"Fritz,\" said the Little Colonel, \"yo' great-aunt Sally Tylah's comin' this mawnin', an' if you don't want to say 'howdy' to her you'll have to come with me.\"  A few minutes later a resolute little figure squeezed between the palings of the garden fence down by the gooseberry bushes.  \"Now walk on your tiptoes, Fritz!\" commanded the Little Colonel, \"else somebody will call us back.\"  Mom Beck, busy with her extra baking, supposed she was with her mother on the shady, vine-covered porch.  She would not have been singing quite so gaily if she could have seen half a mile up the road.  The Little Colonel was sitting in the weeds by the railroad track, deliberately taking off her shoes and stockings.  \"Just like a little niggah,\" she said, delightedly, as she stretched out her bare feet. \"Mom Beck says I ought to know bettah. But it does feel so good!\"  No telling how long she might have sat there enjoying the forbidden pleasure of dragging her rosy toes through the warm dust, if she had not heard a horse's hoof-beats coming rapidly along.  \"Fritz, it's gran'fathah,\" she whispered, in alarm, recognizing the erect figure of the rider in its spotless suit of white duck.  \"Sh! lie down in the weeds, quick! Lie down, I say!\" They both made themselves as flat as possible, and lay there panting with the exertion of keeping still.  Presently the Little Colonel raised her head cautiously.  \"Oh, he's gone down that lane!\" she exclaimed. \"Now you can get up.\" After a moment's deliberation she asked, \"Fritz, would you rathah have some 'trawberries an' be tied up fo' runnin' away, or not be tied up and not have any of those nice tas'en 'trawberries?\"     CHAPTER III.   Two hours later, Colonel Lloyd, riding down the avenue under the locusts, was surprised by a novel sight on his stately front steps.  Three little darkies and a big flop-eared hound were crouched on the bottom step, looking up at the Little Colonel, who sat just above them.  She was industriously stirring something in an old rusty pan with a big, battered spoon.  \"Now, May Lilly,\" she ordered, speaking to the largest and blackest of the group, \"you run an' find some nice 'mooth pebbles to put in for raisins. Henry Clay, you go get me some moah sand. This is 'most too wet.\"  \"Here, you little pickaninnies!\" roared the Colonel, as he recognized the cook's children. \"What did I tell you about playing around here, tracking dirt all over my premises? You just chase back to the cabin where you belong!\"  The sudden call startled Lloyd so that she dropped the pan, and the great mud pie turned upside down on the white steps.  \"Well, you're a pretty sight!\" said the Colonel, as he glanced with disgust from her soiled dress and muddy hands to her bare feet.  He had been in a bad humour all morning. The sight of the steps covered with sand and muddy tracks gave him an excuse to give vent to his cross feelings.  It was one of his theories that a little girl should always be kept as fresh and dainty as a flower. He had never seen his own little daughter in such a plight as this, and she had never been allowed to step outside of her own room without her shoes and stockings.  \"What does your mother mean,\" he cried, savagely, \"by letting you run barefooted around the country just like poor white trash? An' what are you playing with low-flung niggers for? Haven't you ever been taught any better? I suppose it's some of your father's miserable Yankee notions.\"  May Lilly, peeping around the corner of the house, rolled her frightened eyes from one angry face to the other. The same temper that glared from the face of the man, sitting erect in his saddle, seemed to be burning in the eyes of the child, who stood so defiantly before him. The same kind of scowl drew their eyebrows together darkly.  \"Don't you talk that way to me,\" cried the Little Colonel, trembling with a wrath she did not know how to express.  Suddenly she stooped, and snatching both hands full of mud from the overturned pie, flung it wildly over the spotless white coat.  Colonel Lloyd gasped with astonishment. It was the first time in his life he had ever been openly defied. The next moment his anger gave way to amusement.  \"By George!\" he chuckled, admiringly. \"The little thing has got spirit, sure enough. She's a Lloyd through and through. So that's why they call her the 'Little Colonel,' is it?\"  There was a tinge of pride in the look he gave her haughty little head and flashing eyes. \"There, there, child!\" he said, soothingly. \"I didn't mean to make you mad, when you were good enough to come and see me. It isn't often I have a little lady like you pay me a visit.\"  \"I didn't come to see you, suh,\" she answered, indignantly, as she started toward the gate. \"I came to see May Lilly. But I nevah would have come inside yo' gate if I'd known you was goin' to hollah at me an' be so cross.\"  She was walking off with the air of an offended queen, when the Colonel remembered that if he allowed her to go away in that mood she would probably never set foot on his grounds again. Her display of temper had interested him immensely.  Now that he had laughed off his ill humour, he was anxious to see what other traits of character she possessed. He wheeled his horse across the walk to bar her way, and quickly dismounted.  \"Oh, now, wait a minute,\" he said, in a coaxing tone. \"Don't you want a nice big saucer of strawberries and cream before you go? Walker's picking some now. And you haven't seen my hothouse. It's just full of the loveliest flowers you ever saw. You like roses, don't you, and pinks and lilies and pansies?\"  He saw he had struck the right chord as soon as he mentioned the flowers. The sullen look vanished as if by magic. Her face changed as suddenly as an April day.  \"Oh, yes!\" she cried, with a beaming smile. \"I loves 'm bettah than anything!\"  He tied his horse, and led the way to the conservatory. He opened the door for her to pass through, and then watched her closely to see what impression it would make on her. He had expected a delighted exclamation of surprise, for he had good reason to be proud of his rare plants. They were arranged with a true artist's eye for colour and effect.  She did not say a word for a moment, but drew a long breath, while the delicate pink in her cheeks deepened and her eyes lighted up. Then she began going slowly from flower to flower, laying her face against the cool, velvety purple of the pansies, touching the roses with her lips, and tilting the white lily-cups to look into their golden depths.  As she passed from one to another as lightly as a butterfly might have done, she began chanting in a happy undertone.  Ever since she had learned to talk she had a quaint little way of singing to herself. All the names that pleased her fancy she strung together in a crooning melody of her own.  There was no special tune. It sounded happy, although nearly always in a minor key.  \"Oh, the jonquils an' the lilies!\" she sang. \"All white an' gold an' yellow. Oh, they're all a-smilin' at me, an' a-sayin' howdy! howdy!\"  She was so absorbed in her intense enjoyment that she forgot all about the old Colonel. She was wholly unconscious that he was watching or listening.  \"She really does love them,\" he thought, complacently. \"To see her face one would think she had found a fortune.\"  It was another bond between them.  After awhile he took a small basket from the wall, and began to fill it with his choicest blooms. \"You shall have these to take home,\" he said. \"Now come into the house and get your strawberries.\"  She followed him reluctantly, turning back several times for one more long sniff of the delicious fragrance.  She was not at all like the Colonel's ideal of what a little girl should be, as she sat in one of the high, stiff chairs, enjoying her strawberries. Her dusty little toes wriggled around in the curls on Fritz's back, as she used him for a footstool. Her dress was draggled and dirty, and she kept leaning over to give the dog berries and cream from the spoon she was eating with herself.  He forgot all this, however, when she began to talk to him.  \"My great-aunt Sally Tylah is to our house this mawnin',\" she announced, confidentially. \"That's why we came off. Do you know my Aunt Sally Tylah?\"  \"Well, slightly!\" chuckled the Colonel. \"She was my wife's half-sister. So you don't like her, eh? Well, I don't like her either.\"  He threw back his head and laughed heartily. The more the child talked the more entertaining he found her. He did not remember when he had ever been so amused before as he was by this tiny counterpart of himself.  When the last berry had vanished, she slipped down from the tall chair.  \"Do you 'pose it's very late?\" she asked, in an anxious voice. \"Mom Beck will be comin' for me soon.\"  \"Yes, it is nearly noon,\" he answered. \"It didn't do much good to run away from your Aunt Tyler; she'll see you after all.\"  \"Well, she can't 'queeze me an' kiss me, 'cause I've been naughty, an' I'll be put to bed like I was the othah day, just as soon as I get home. I 'most wish I was there now,\" she sighed. \"It's so fa' an' the sun's so hot. I lost my sunbonnet when I was comin' heah, too.\"  Something in the tired, dirty face prompted the old Colonel to say, \"Well, my horse hasn't been put away yet. I'll take you home on Maggie Boy.\"  The next moment he repented making such an offer, thinking what the neighbours might say if they should meet him on the road with Elizabeth's child in his arm.  But it was too late. He could not unclasp the trusting little hand that was slipped in his. He could not cloud the happiness of the eager little face by retracting his promise.  He swung himself into the saddle, with her in front. Then he put his one arm around her with a firm clasp, as he reached forward to take the bridle.

From it you can conclude that the yacht is capable of running with considerable speed, amounting to thirteen miles an hour, if desired.  Let us descend to the cabin next; can anything be more tasteful and convenient? Is it not luxurious? And, although small, does not its very limited space astonish you when you view so many comforts? This is the dining-room. What can be more complete! Just look at this side-board, with its sumptuous outfit in silver and crystal. _A multum in parvo._  The kitchen is admirably arranged; the spacious refrigerator making it possible that a considerable amount of all sorts of provisions and delicacies can be kept on board for some time.  Let us peep into the cozy staterooms. Are they not nicely furnished? Glance at the large and comfortable berths, which can be extended so as to form double berths, as in a Pullman car. All the rooms receive light, either through side-windows or from the upper deck. Every facility for enjoying open air exercise is offered by the main deck running the whole length of the ship. The portion pertaining to the stern is especially commodious, and constituted our dining-room on pleasant days. Even when the weather was unfavorable, the awnings which inclosed this delightful place formed an excellent shelter, giving the impression we were living in a large tent.  Thus, you observe, that nothing is omitted to secure comfort. Do you see this electric bell? Well, all the staterooms are provided with such bells, which are connected with the steward's pantry.  Now, let us go forward. These two doors form the entrance to the pilot-house; please, step in. Here is the steering wheel, and by means of these brass tubes the steersman communicates with the engineer. Look up to the ceiling. It is decorated with multitudinous charts and maps. Before we leave this room do not forget to glance at the mariner's compass in its elegant brass case.  Close by is the entrance to the fore-castle, which contains the men's berths. The crew occupying them consists of the captain, the engineer, the cook, the steward, and the seamen.  There not being accommodation for more female servants, Mrs. James was attended by only one maid. She, however, could easily spare larger retinue, because this excellent girl has assisted her mistress in performing the manifold domestic duties for more than fourteen years, and during this long period Mrs. James has learned to value her for her dexterity in all female occupations. She is also a faithful guardian of the children for whom she tenderly cares.  Flattering myself that I have given my kind readers a satisfactory, introductory description, I shall now advance with the narrative, and proceed on our journey, traversing the longest artificial waterway ever constructed by human hands; and sailing on the unsteady billows of the great lakes, which contain the largest amount of sweet water on the globe, in order to visit the World's Fair, the grandest and most complete exposition that human eyes ever beheld.    CHAPTER I.  VOYAGE ON THE ERIE CANAL FROM JULY 22ND, 10.40 A.M., TILL JULY 29TH, 1.30 P.M.   Finally, the 22nd of July, the day appointed for our departure, had arrived. Great was my satisfaction to find the auspices predicting fine weather; and, indeed, it was as beautiful as if Heaven smiled on our enterprise. When taking leave of my neighbors, it was not at all with a sad sentiment, for I had been well aware that I was going to undertake a trip which but few mortals are so fortunate as to participate.  Accompanied by my dear parents I went to Dock street, where the \"Marguerite\" lay all ready for leaving the flourishing city of Schenectady.  My mother, whose domestic duties recalled her to the hearth at home, was compelled to leave me, while my father remained on board the yacht, anxious to enjoy my company as long as circumstances would permit. Therefore, he gladly accepted Mr. James's kind invitation to accompany us on our journey for a short distance.  Three intimate friends of Mr. James and his family were also invited guests on the boat. These temporary traveling companions were Dr. A. Veeder, Lawyer Charles Hastings and Congressman S.J. Schermerhorn, three well known and highly estimated gentlemen from Schenectady.  At 11.40 A.M., Mr. James gave orders to haul in the lines attaching the boat to the shore; and a gun-shot at departing announced to the numerous spectators that the \"Marguerite\" was on the point to set out for her unusual, but most interesting trip.  We had been sailing only a very short distance, and were just facing the buildings of the General Electric Company, when our attention was attracted by a photographer who seemed to be very desirous of taking a photo of the yacht and her passengers; for he aspired to gain the most favorable posture, apparently quite a task under the circumstances. How well he succeeded in his endeavors, the readers can judge for themselves by glancing at the frontispiece of this book.  Resuming our journey, we soon had opportunity to admire the beautiful and fertile Mohawk Valley, once the home of one of the tribes composing the Five Nations. Arendt Van Curler, the noble founder of the \"Place Beyond the Pines,\" pronounced this picturesque region the most beautiful the eye of man had ever beheld, at a time when the country was yet in its infancy. Though great changes have taken place since that remote date (1642), the grandeur of the scenes spread before us evidently showed that the country has lost little of its beauty, even at the present day, nothwithstanding the white man has established in many places his smoking factories and noisy looms.  At the second lock Mr. Schermerhorn, who owns a beautiful residence near this place, in the Township of Rotterdam, joined our party, whereupon we continued sailing on the smooth surface of the canal with accelerated speed.  At 2.40 P.M., after having passed five locks, we approached _Amsterdam_, an enterprising and prosperous city of over 20,000 inhabitants, located in the midst of romantic scenery. We halted at Port Jackson for a few minutes, since this was the terminus of the voyage of Mr. Hastings and my father.  When parting with me, my father said:  \"This short tour has sufficed me to perceive how delightful your voyage promises to be in company with this amiable family. Thus I leave you, feeling very happy that so many pleasures and enjoyments are awaiting you.\"  I answered his kind words with a hearty parting kiss, as a token of my filial love.  The two gentlemen, after having abandoned the yacht, ascended the bridge that spans the canal at that point; and bidding us farewell once more, they pursued us with their eyes until the graceful lines of the \"Marguerite\" had become invisible in the distance.  Continuing our voyage, I was in perfect rapture with the ever varying magnificence of the luxuriant Mohawk Valley. In the afternoon the sky became overcast and the quietude that had been prevailing was interrupted by a thunder-clap, which gave us the signal to prepare for a shower. After the expiration of a few minutes the full-charged clouds poured their deluge upon mother earth. This natural phenomenon, however, was only of short duration; but sufficient to render the atmosphere most delightfully pure and refreshing. It was now a redoubled pleasure to view the many hills and dales, adorned in every shade of verdure, varying with romantic forest scenes; all mingling into one inexpressibly rich garniture in which Nature had royally clad herself in order to give us greeting on our way.  As we reached Fultonville, a suburban village of Fonda, about twenty-six miles from Schenectady, Dr. Veeder and Congressman Schermerhorn parted with us, wishing us a pleasurable voyage.  The \"Marguerite,\" gliding along, neared the vicinity of Sprakers when suddenly the \"heaven grew black again with the storm-cloud's frown,\" and a flash of lightning illuminated the sky with crimson radiance. It is for a moment as if the horizon was in flames, a spectacle glorious to behold. Another minute and a peal of thunder reaches our ears. Then the dark, heavy clouds discharge their contents in copious abundance.     \"In grateful silence earth receives       The general blessing: fresh and fair     Each flower expands its little leaves       As glad the common joy to share.\"  While it is still raining,     \"The sun breaks forth, from off the scene       Its floating veil of mist is flung.     And all the wilderness of green       With trembling drops of light is hung.\"  A magnificent rainbow, spanning the boundless arch on high, embellishes this superb panorama.  As the sunset was bathing all summits in soft, crimson light, and the pale lustre of the orbed moon appeared in the east, we arrived at _Canajoharie_.  This small town, noted for its fine stone quarries, was chosen for our abode over Sunday, and busy hands carried out the order to safely moor our craft near the bridge pertaining to the main street.  When taking a long walk about the town, I found that, although inferior in size, it is a very desirable place for summer residences; being beautifully situated on romantic slopes crowned with elegant and tasty villas.  Canajoharie is regularly and appropriately laid out with wide, well kept and adequately lighted thoroughfares, and many citizens reside in spacious and architecturally ornamented houses. It is a recognized center of trade, from which agricultural products of all kinds are shipped.  In the first historic record, dated 1757, the place was styled \"Fort Cannatchocary,\" and mentioned as a prospering settlement. Incorporated as a town in 1788, its population has been rapidly increasing since then, and now is estimated to amount to more than 3,000.  It was a glorious morning, the 24th of July, as we left Canajoharie. The sun rose up into a cloudless heaven and poured a flood of gorgeous splendor over the landscape, as if proud of"]]]
