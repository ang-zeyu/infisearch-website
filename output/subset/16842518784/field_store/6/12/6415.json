Then, more impulsively, the girl slips down from the bench, and sits by him on the around._) Do you think I shall make as good a match as my sisters, Guido? Do you think some great rich nobleman will marry me very soon? And shall I like the court! What shall I see there?  GUIDO Marvels. I think--yes, I am afraid that you will like them.  GRACIOSA And Duke Alessandro--shall I like him?  GUIDO Few courtiers have expressed dislike of him in my presence.  GRACIOSA Do you like him? Does he too buy lavishly?  GUIDO Eh, madonna! some day, when you have seen his jewels--  GRACIOSA Oh! I shall see them when I go to court?  GUIDO Yes, he will show them to you, I think, without fail, for the Duke loves beauty in all its forms. So he will take pleasure in confronting the brightness of your eyes with the brightness of the four kinds of sapphires, of the twelve kinds of rubies, and of many extraordinary pearls--  GRACIOSA (_With eyes shining, and lips parted._) Oh!  GUIDO And you will see his famous emerald necklace, and all his diamonds, and his huge turquoises, which will make you ashamed of your poor talisman--  GRACIOSA He will show all these jewels to me!  GUIDO (_Looking at her, and still smiling thoughtfully._) He will show you the very finest of his gems, assuredly. And then, worse still, he will be making verses in your honor.  GRACIOSA It would be droll to have a great duke making songs about me!  GUIDO It is a preposterous feature of Duke Alessandro's character that he is always making songs about some beautiful thing or another.  GRACIOSA Such strange songs, Guido! I was singing over one of them just before you came,--      Let me have dames and damsels richly clad       To feed and tend my mirth,     Singing by day and night to make me glad--  But I could not quite understand it. Are his songs thought good?  GUIDO The songs of a reigning duke are always good.  GRACIOSA And is he as handsome as people report?  GUIDO Tastes differ, of course--  GRACIOSA And is he--?  GUIDO I have a portrait of the Duke. It does not, I think, unduly flatter him. Will you look at it?  GRACIOSA Yes, yes!  GUIDO (_Drawing out a miniature on a chain._) Here is the likeness.  GRACIOSA But how should you--?  GUIDO (_Seeing her surprise._) Oh, it was a gift to me from his highness for a special service I did him, and as such must be treasured.  GRACIOSA Perhaps, then, I shall see yon at court, Messer Guido, who are the friend of princes?  GUIDO If you do, I ask only that in noisy Florence you remember this quiet garden.  GRACIOSA (_Looks at him silently, then glances at the portrait. She speaks with evident disappointment._) Is this the Duke?  GUIDO You may see his arms on it, and on the back his inscription.  GRACIOSA Yes, but--(_looking at the portrait again_)--but ... he is ... so ...  GUIDO You are astonished at his highness' coloring? That he inherits from his mother. She was, you know, a blackamoor.  GRACIOSA And my sisters wrote me he was like a god!  GUIDO Such observations are court etiquette.  GRACIOSA (_With an outburst of disgust._) Take it back! Though how can you bear to look at it, far less to have it touching you! And only yesterday I was angry because I had not seen the Duke riding past!  GUIDO Seen him! here! riding past!  GRACIOSA Old Ursula told me that the Duke had gone by with twenty men, riding down toward the convent at the border. And I flung my sewing-bag straight at her head because she had not called me.  GUIDO That was idle gossip, I fancy. The Duke rarely rides abroad without my--(_he stops_)--without my lavish patron Eglamore, the friend of all honest merchants.  GRACIOSA But that abominable Eglamore may have been with him. I heard nothing to the contrary.  GUIDO True, madonna, true. I had forgotten you did not see them.  GRACIOSA No. What is he like, this Eglamore? Is he as appalling to look at as the Duke?  GUIDO Madonna! but wise persons do not apply such adjectives to dukes. And wise persons do not criticize Count Eglamore's appearance, either, now that Eglamore is indispensable to the all-powerful Duke of Florence.  GRACIOSA Indispensable?  GUIDO It is thanks to the Eglamore whom you hate that the Duke has ample leisure to indulge in recreations which are reputed to be--curious.  GRACIOSA I do not understand you, Guido.  GUIDO That is perhaps quite as well. (_Attempting to explain as much as is decently expressible._) To be brief, madonna, business annoys the Duke.  GRACIOSA Why?  GUIDO It interferes with the pursuit of all the beautiful things he asks for in that song.  GRACIOSA But how does that make Eglamore indispensable?  GUIDO Eglamore is an industrious person who affixes seals, and signs treaties, and musters armies, and collects revenues, upon the whole, quite as efficiently as Alessandro would be capable of doing these things.  GRACIOSA So Duke Alessandro merely makes verses?  GUIDO And otherwise amuses himself as his inclinations prompt, while Eglamore rules Tuscany--and the Tuscans are none the worse off on account of it. (_He rises, and his hand goes to the dagger at his belt._) But is not that a horseman?  GRACIOSA (_She too has risen, and is now standing on the bench, looking over the wall._) A solitary rider, far down by the convent, so far away that he seems hardly larger than a scarlet dragon-fly.  GUIDO I confess I wish to run no risk of being found here, by your respected father or by your ingenious cousins and uncles.  GRACIOSA (_She turns, but remains standing upon the bench._) I think your Duke is much more dangerous looking than any of them. Heigho! I can quite foresee that I shall never fall in love with this Duke.  GUIDO A prince has means to overcome all obstacles.  GRACIOSA No. It is unbefitting and a little cowardly for Duke Alessandro to shirk the duties of his station for verse-making and eternal pleasure-seeking. Now if I were Duke--  GUIDO What would you do?  GRACIOSA (_Posturing a little as she stands upon the bench._) If I were duke? Oh ... I would grant my father a pension ... and I would have Eglamore hanged ... and I would purchase a new gown of silvery green--  GUIDO In which you would be very ravishingly beautiful.  _His tone has become rather ardent, and he is now standing nearer to her than the size of the garden necessitates. So GRACIOSA demurely steps down from the bench, and sits at the far end._  GRACIOSA And that is all I can think of. What would you do if you were duke, Messer Guido?  GUIDO (_Who is now sitting beside her at closer quarters than the length of the bench quite strictly demands._) I? What would I do if I were a great lord instead of a tradesman! (_Softly._) I think you know the answer, madonna.  GRACIOSA Oh, you would make me your duchess, of course. That is quite understood. But I was speaking seriously, Guido.  GUIDO And is it not a serious matter that a pedler of crystals should have dared to love a nobleman's daughter?  GRACIOSA (_Delighted._) This is the first I have heard of it.  GUIDO But you are perfectly right. It is not a serious matter. That I worship you is an affair which does not seriously concern any person save me in any way whatsoever. Yet I think that knowledge of the fact would put your father to the trouble of sharpening his dagger.  GRACIOSA Ye-es. But not even Father would deny that you were showing excellent taste.  GUIDO Indeed, I am not certain that I do worship you; for in order to adore whole-heartedly the idolater must believe his idol to be perfect. (_Taking her hand._) Now your nails are of an ugly shape, like that of little fans. Your nose is nothing to boast of. And your mouth is too large. I do not admire these faults, for faults they are undoubtedly--  GRACIOSA Do they make me very ugly? I know that I have not a really good mouth, Guido, but do you think it is positively repulsive?  GUIDO No.... Then, too, I know that you are vain and self-seeking, and look forward contentedly to the time when your father will transfer his ownership of your physical attractions to that nobleman who offers the highest price for them.  GRACIOSA But we daughters of the poor Valori are compelled to marry--suitably. We have only the choice between that and the convent yonder.  GUIDO That is true, and nobody disputes it. Still, you participate in a monstrous bargain, and I would prefer to have you exhibit distaste for it.  _Bending forward, GUIDO draws from his jewel pack the string of pearls, and this he moodily contemplates, in order to evince his complete disinterestedness. The pose has its effect. GRACIOSA looks at him for a moment, rises, draws a deep breath, and speaks with a sort of humility._  GRACIOSA And to what end, Guido? What good would weeping do?  GUIDO (_Smiling whimsically._) I am afraid that men do not always love according to the strict laws of logic. (_He drops the pearls, and, rising, follows her._) I desire your happiness above all things, yet to see you so abysmally untroubled by anything which troubles me is--another matter.  GRACIOSA But I am not untroubled, Guido.  GUIDO No?  GRACIOSA No. (_Rather tremulously._) Sometimes I sit here dreading my life at court. I want never to leave my father's bleak house. I fear that I may not like the man who offers the highest price for me. And it seems as if the court were a horrible painted animal, dressed in bright silks, and shining with jewels, and waiting to devour me.  _Beyond the wall appears a hat of scarlet satin with a divided brim, which, rising, is revealed to surmount the head of an extraordinarily swarthy person, to whose dark skin much powder has only loaned the hue of death: his cheeks, however, are vividly carmined. This is all that the audience can now see of the young DUKE of FLORENCE, whose proximity the two in the garden are just now too much engrossed to notice._  _The DUKE looks from one to the other.

The postman, resolved not to miss the fun of the situation, was not going to let Pee-wee take another bite; time was precious, and two more bites of the sort that Pee-wee took might leave his hand free.  “Take the letter,” he said with an air of cold determination, “or I’ll leave it at the house. Here, take it quick; I’ve no time to waste.”  “Do you want me to waste a banana,” Pee-wee yelled imploringly; “a scout is supposed—”  “Here, take it,” the postman said.  There followed the most terrible moment in the life of Pee-wee Harris, Scout. He knew that one more bite would be fatal, that the postman would not wait. In two bites, or in three at most, he could finish the banana and his hand would be free.  How could a postman, who brings joy to the lonely, words of love from far away, cheer to those who wait, comfort from across the seas, _Boys’ Life Magazine_—how could such a being be so relentless and cruel? If that letter were left at the house, Pee-wee would have to go to the house and get it, and there his mother was lying in ambush waiting to pounce upon him and make him mow the lawn. Why would not the postman wait for just two bites? Maybe he could do it in one. He had consumed a peach in one bite and a ham sandwich in four—his star record.  He made a movement with his hand, and simultaneously the postman retreated a step or two toward the house. Pee-wee tried releasing his hold upon the trunk with the other hand and almost lost his balance on the shaky limb.  “Here,” said the postman, unyielding, “chuck the banana and take the letter or you’ll find it waiting for you in the front hall. It’s an important letter, it feels as if it had a couple of cookies in it.” The postman knew Pee-wee. “Here you go,” the torturer said grimly, “take it or not, suit yourself.”  “Can’t you see both hands are busy?” the victim pled. “Two bites—a scout is supposed not to waste anything—he’s supposed—he’s supposed—_wait_ a minute—he’s supposed if he starts a thing to finish it—_wait!_ I’m not going to take a bite, I’m only giving you an argument—can’t you wait—”  “Here you go, last chance, take it,” the postman said, a faint smile hovering at the corner of his mouth, “one, two, —”  Out of Pee-wee’s wrath and anguish came an inspiration. “Stick the letter in the banana,” he said, holding the banana down.  “I don’t know about that,” the postman said, ruefully.  “I know about it,” Pee-wee thundered down at him. “You said I had to take it or not; that letter belongs to me and you have to deliver it. This banana, it’s—it’s the same as a mail box—you stick the letter in the banana. You think you’re so smart, you thought you’d make me throw away the banana, _naaah_, didn’t you? I wouldn’t do that, not even for—for—secretary—for the postmaster-general, I wouldn’t! A scout has resource.”  “All right, you win,” said the postman, good-humoredly, “only look out you don’t fall; here you go, hold on tight.”  Clutching to the knotty projection of trunk, Pee-wee reached the other hand as low as he could and the postman, smiling, stuck the corner of the coveted letter into the mealy substance of the banana.  “You win,” the postman repeated laughingly; “it shows what Scout Harris can do with food.”  “Food will win the war,” Pee-wee shouted. “You thought you could make me throw away my banana but you couldn’t. I knew a man that died from not eating a banana, I did.”  “Explain all that,” the postman said.  “He threw a banana away on his porch instead of eating it and later he stepped on it and slid down the steps and broke his leg and they took him to the hospital and compilations set in and he got pneumonia and died from not eating that banana. So there!”  “That’s a very fine argument,” the postman said as he went away.  “I know better ones than that!” Pee-wee shouted after him.                                    CHAPTER II                            A TRAGIC PREDICAMENT   So there he sat upon his precarious perch trying to reassume the posture which insured a good balance, clinging to the trunk with one hand and to the banana with the other.  And now that the encounter which had almost resulted in a tragic sacrifice was over, and while our scout hero pauses triumphant, it may be fitting to apologize to the reader for introducing our hero in the act of eating. But indeed it was a question of introducing him in the act of eating or of not introducing him at all.  For a story of Pee-wee Harris is necessarily more or less a story of food. And this is a story abounding in cake and pie and waffles and crullers and cookies and hot frankfurters. There will be found in it also ice cream cones and jawbreakers and cocoanut bars and potatoes roasted on sticks. Heroes of stories may have starved on desert islands but there is to be none of that here.  In this tale, if you follow the adventures of our scout hero (who now at last appears before you as a star), you shall find lemonade side by side with first aid, and all the characters shall receive their just desserts, some of them (not to mention any names) two helpings.  So there he sat upon the branch, the mascot of the Raven Patrol, with an interior like the Mammoth Cave and a voice like the whisperings of the battle zone in France. Take a good look at him while he is quiet for ten seconds hand running. Everything about him is tremendous—except his size. He is built to withstand banter, ridicule and jollying; his sturdy nature is guaranteed proof against the battering assaults of unholy mirth from other scouts; his round face and curly hair are the delight of the girls of Bridgeboro; his loyalty is as the mighty rock of Gibraltar. A bully little scout he is—a sort of human Ford.  The question of removing the letter from the banana and getting rid of the banana (in the proper way) now presented itself to him. He took a bite of the banana and the letter almost fell. He then tried releasing his hold upon the trunk but that would not do. He then extracted the letter with his teeth which effectually prevented him from eating the banana.  What to do?  Steadying himself with one hand (he could not let go the trunk for so much as a moment), he brought the banana to his lips, held it between his teeth and took the letter in his unoccupied hand. As he bit into the banana the part remaining trembled and hung as on a thread; another moment and it would drop. The predicament was tragic. Slowly, but surely and steadily, the remainder of the banana broke away and _fell_—into the hand that held the letter.  Holding both letter and banana in the one perspiring palm, Pee-wee devoured first the one and then the other. Both were delicious, the letter particularly. It had one advantage over the banana, for he could only devour the banana once, whereas he devoured the contents of the letter several times. He wished that bananas and doughnuts were like letters....                                   CHAPTER III                               AN INVITATION   The envelope was postmarked Everdoze which, with its one thousand two hundred and fifty-seven inhabitants, was the cosmopolitan center of Long Valley which ran (if anything in that neighborhood could be said to run) from Baxter City down below the vicinity of the bridge on the highway.  That is, Long Valley bordered the highway on its western side for a distance of about ten miles. The valley was, roughly speaking, a couple of miles wide, very deep in places, and thickly wooded. It was altogether a very sequestered and romantic region. Through it, paralleling the highway, was a road, consisting mostly of two wagon ruts with a strip of grass and weeds between them. To traverse Long Valley one turned into this road where it left the highway at Baxters, and in the course of time the wayfarer would emerge out of this dim tract into the light of day where the unfrequented road came into the highway again below the bridge.  About midway of this lonely road was Everdoze, and in a pleasant old-fashioned white house in Everdoze lived Ebenezer Quig who once upon a time had married Pee-wee’s Aunt Jamsiah. Pee-wee remembered his Aunt Jamsiah when she had come to make a visit in Bridgeboro and, though he had never seen her since, he had always borne her tenderly in mind because as a little (a _very_ little) boy her name had always reminded him of jam. The letter, as has been said, bore the postmark of Everdoze and had been stamped by the very hand of Simeon Drowser, the local postmaster.  This is what the letter said:    Dear Walter:    Your uncle has been pestering me to write to you but Pepsy has   been using the pen for her school exercise and I couldn’t get hold   of it till to-day when she went away with Wiggle, perch fishing.   Licorice Stick says they’re running in the brook most wonderful   but you can’t believe half what he says. Seems as if the perch   know when school closes, leastways that’s what your uncle says.    Pee-wee reread these enchanting words. Pepsy! Wiggle! Perch   fishing! Licorice Stick! And school closing! And perch that knew   about it. That was the sort of perch for Pee-wee. He read on:    I told your uncle I reckoned you wouldn’t care to come here being   you live in such a lively place but he said this summer you would   like to come for there will be plenty for you to do because there   is going to be a spelling match in the town hall and an Uncle   Tom’s Cabin show in August.    You can have plenty of milk and fresh eggs and Miss Arabella   Bellison who has the school is staying this summer and she will   let you in the school-house where there is a library of more than   forty books but some of the pages are gone Pepsy says. She says to   tell you she will show you where she cut her initials but I tell   her not to put such ideas in your head and she knows how to climb   in even if the door is locked, such goings on as she and Wiggle   have, they will be the death of me.    Well, Walter, you"]]]
