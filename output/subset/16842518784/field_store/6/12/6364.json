So you can understand that Sandy Chipmunk had the best of reasons for being careful.  After he had made a soft, warm bed for himself, Sandy set to work to gather nuts and grain, to store in his house and eat during the winter. He was particular to choose only well cured (or dried) food, for he knew that that was the only sort that would keep through the long winter, down in his underground storeroom.  He gathered other food, too, besides nuts and grain. Near Farmer Green's house he found some plump sunflower seeds, which he added to his store. Then there were wild-cherry pits, too, which the birds had dropped upon the ground. All these, and many other kinds of food, found their way into Sandy Chipmunk's home.  Much as he liked such things to eat--and especially sunflower seeds--he never ate a single nut or grain or seed while he gathered them for his winter's food. And when you stop to remember that he had to carry everything home in his _mouth_, you can see that Sandy Chipmunk had what is called self-control.  His mother had always told him that he couldn't get through a winter without that. And so, when Sandy brought her to see his new home, after it was all finished, and his bed was neatly made, and his storeroom full of food, Mrs. Chipmunk was delighted.  \"I'm glad to see--\" she said--\"I'm glad to see that all my talking has done some good.\"     VI  SAMPLES OF WHEAT   There was so much said about Sandy Chipmunk's store of nuts and grain that a few of the forest-people began to wish they had some of Sandy's winter food for themselves. Uncle Sammy Coon, an old scamp who lived over near the swamp, was one of those who began to plan to get Sandy's hoard away from him.  It was the grain that Uncle Sammy wanted. If he had spent in honest work one-half the time he used in planning some trickery he would have been much better off. But he hated work more than anything else in the world.  Uncle Sammy Coon scarcely slept at all for several days, he was so busy thinking about Sandy's grain. And since he always passed his nights in wandering through the woods, he became almost ill.  The trouble was, Uncle Sammy was far too big to crawl inside Sandy's house. And he knew that the only way he could get at the grain was to persuade somebody to bring it outside for him.  At last he thought of a fine scheme. And as soon as it came into his head he hobbled over to Sandy Chipmunk's home. I say _hobbled_, because Uncle Sammy had a lame knee. He always claimed that he was injured in battle. But almost every one knew that he hurt his knee one time when Farmer Green caught him stealing a hen.  When he reached the pasture Uncle Sammy found Sandy Chipmunk just starting away to hunt for nuts.  [Illustration: He Dropped the Grain in Front of Uncle Sammy]  \"Good morning!\" the old fellow said. He spoke very pleasantly, though he was so sleepy that he felt disagreeable enough. \"I've come over to buy something from your store.\"  \"My store!\" Sandy Chipmunk exclaimed.  \"Yes!\" said Uncle Sammy Coon. \"I've heard you have a store here with a heap of nuts and grain to sell.\"  Now, it had never occurred to Sandy Chipmunk to _sell_ any of the food he had gathered for the winter. But when Uncle Sammy put the idea in his head Sandy rather liked it.  \"I have a fine stock, to be sure,\" he said. \"The nuts are specially good. How many would you like to buy?\"  But Uncle Sammy Coon told him he didn't want any nuts.  \"I never eat them,\" he said. \"It's grain that I want. And I'll buy as much as you care to sell.... Bring a sample of it up here,\" he urged. \"I'd like to see if it's as good as people say.\"  So Sandy Chipmunk darted into his house. And soon he appeared again with his cheek-pouches crammed full of wheat kernels.  \"There!\" he cried, when he had dropped the grain in front of Uncle Sammy. \"Just try a little of it! You'll agree with me that it's very fine.\"  Uncle Sammy not only tried a little. He gobbled up every single kernel.  \"It seems to me to have a queer taste,\" he said. \"Bring up some more!\"  And Sandy scurried down into his house again, to bob up in a few moments with another sample of his grain.  Once more Uncle Sammy ate it all.  \"It's a bit damp,\" he remarked, as he smacked his lips. \"I hope it's not moldy.... You'd better let me see another sample.\"  Uncle Sammy declared the next heap of kernels to be altogether too dry. And he kept ordering Sandy to fetch more for him to \"taste,\" as he called it. Some of the wheat he considered too ripe, and some too green. Some of the kernels--so he said--were too little, and others too big. And finally he even told Sandy Chipmunk that he was afraid Sandy was trying to sell him _last year's_ wheat.  Now, Sandy knew that his wheat was fresh--all of it. So he went down and brought up still another load.  Uncle Sammy ate that more slowly, for by this time he had had a good meal.  \"How do you like it?\" Sandy asked him.  \"It's fair,\" Uncle Sammy replied. \"But I believe it's _next year's_ wheat. And of course I wouldn't think of buying that kind.... I guess I can't trade with you, after all.\" And he started to hobble away.  When Sandy heard that, and saw the old fellow leaving, he began to scold.  \"Aren't you going to pay me for what you've eaten?\" he asked.  \"What! Pay you for the samples?\" Uncle Sammy asked. \"I guess, young man, you don't know much about keeping a store. Nobody ever pays for samples.\" And he went away muttering to himself.  Sandy Chipmunk felt very sad. Uncle Sammy had eaten half his winter's supply of wheat.  Sandy was angry, too. And for several days he was busier than ever, trying to think of some way in which he could make Uncle Sammy Coon pay him.     VII  UNCLE SAMMY'S STORE   Not long after Uncle Sammy Coon ate half of Sandy Chipmunk's wheat without paying for it he seemed to grow lamer than ever. And he walked less than ever, too. A good many of the forest-folk said that he really wasn't any lamer--but he was lazier.  However that may have been, he began to stay at home a good deal of the time. And finally Sandy Chipmunk heard that Uncle Sammy had opened a store, in which he kept all sorts of good things to eat.  When Sandy learned that he lost no time in going over to Uncle Sammy's house near the swamp.  Sure enough! There he found Uncle Sammy sitting behind a long table. And behind him were shelves loaded with apples, pears, corn, nuts and many other kinds of food.  \"I'd like to buy some nuts,\" Sandy Chipmunk told the old gentleman.  \"Nuts?\" said Uncle Sammy. \"I have some fine nuts.\"  \"Let me see a sample,\" Sandy said.  But Uncle Sammy never stirred.  \"There they are, right on the shelf!\" he said. \"Look at them all you want to.\"  \"I'll eat one and see how I like it,\" said Sandy Chipmunk.  But Uncle Sammy shook his head.  \"No!\" he replied. \"That's the old-fashioned way of keeping a store. I don't give away any samples.\"  When Sandy heard that he was angrier than ever. And he wished he had never given Uncle Sammy any samples of his wheat. But he knew there was no use of _appearing angry_. So he smiled and asked:  \"What is the price of your beechnuts?\"  \"For one handful, you will have to pay me an ear of corn,\" Uncle Sammy said.  \"I'll take a handful,\" said Sandy.  Still the old fellow never stirred.  \"Where's your ear of corn?\" he inquired.  \"Oh! I'll give you that the next time I pass this way,\" said Sandy. And he made up his mind that he would take good care to keep away from Uncle Sammy's house.  But Uncle Sammy Coon was too sharp.  \"That won't do at all,\" he said. \"I must have the corn before I give you the nuts.\"  So Sandy Chipmunk stepped to the door.  \"I'll come back soon,\" he said. And he ran all the way to Farmer Green's cornfield, to get an ear of green corn. And then he ran all the way back to Uncle Sammy's house.  \"There!\" Sandy said. \"There's your ear of corn!\" He laid it upon the table. \"Now give me a handful of beechnuts.\"  \"Step right in and help yourself,\" Uncle Sammy answered.  \"No!\" said Sandy. \"You give me the nuts.\" He knew that Uncle Sammy's hands were much bigger than his own and would hold more nuts.  \"I should think you might get them,\" the old scamp grumbled. \"I've a lame knee, you know.\"  \"But I said a 'handful'--not a 'kneeful,'\" Sandy answered. \"Of course, if you don't want this juicy ear of corn, there are others that would like it.\" He started to pick the ear of corn off the table when Uncle Sammy rose quickly.  \"All right!\" he cried. \"But it's the old-fashioned way; and I don't like it.\" Then he gave Sandy a small handful of beechnuts.  Sandy Chipmunk ate them right on the spot. And he began to feel very happy. He had noticed that Uncle Sammy tossed the ear of corn into a basket which stood beneath the table. And the basket was full of corn. Sandy could reach it just as easily from the front of the table as Uncle Sammy could from behind it.  And Sandy Chipmunk had thought all at once of a way to get a good many nuts away from Uncle Sammy, to pay for all the wheat Uncle Sammy had eaten.     VIII  THE BASKET OF CORN   \"What are those nuts on the top shelf?\" Sandy Chipmunk asked Uncle Sammy Coon.  Now, Uncle Sammy had been keeping store so short a time that he didn't exactly know what was on every one of his shelves. So he wheeled around and looked up. And as soon as his back was turned, Sandy Chipmunk reached down under the table and pulled an ear of corn out of the big basket.  \"They're butternuts,\" Uncle Sammy said. \"And they're the same price as the beechnuts.\"  \"Give me one handful,\" Sandy said.  \"_Give_ you a handful--\" Uncle Sammy snapped.  But Sandy Chipmunk smiled at him.  \"I mean, _sell_ me a handful,\" he explained. \"And here's your ear of corn.\" It really was Uncle Sammy's ear of corn, you know--just as Sandy said.  But Uncle Sammy didn't know that. He didn't know it had come out of his own basket. So he threw it into the basket and set a handful of butternuts before Sandy Chipmunk.  Sandy was longer eating those, for the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/948"],["title","Ethics — Part 3 (#1)"],["body","specious phraseology that they are ignorant of the cause of the said action, and do not wonder at it.  But, they will say, whether we know or do not know the means whereby the mind acts on the body, we have, at any rate, experience of the fact that unless the human mind is in a fit state to think, the body remains inert.  Moreover, we have experience, that the mind alone can determine whether we speak or are silent, and a variety of similar states which, accordingly, we say depend on the mind's decree.  But, as to the first point, I ask such objectors, whether experience does not also teach, that if the body be inactive the mind is simultaneously unfitted for thinking?  For when the body is at rest in sleep, the mind simultaneously is in a state of torpor also, and has no power of thinking, such as it possesses when the body is awake.  Again, I think everyone's experience will confirm the statement, that the mind is not at all times equally fit for thinking on a given subject, but according as the body is more or less fitted for being stimulated by the image of this or that object, so also is the mind more or less fitted for contemplating the said object.  But, it will be urged, it is impossible that solely from the laws of nature considered as extended substance, we should be able to deduce the causes of buildings, pictures, and things of that kind, which are produced only by human art; nor would the human body, unless it were determined and led by the mind, be capable of building a single temple.  However, I have just pointed out that the objectors cannot fix the limits of the body's power, or say what can be concluded from a consideration of its sole nature, whereas they have experience of many things being accomplished solely by the laws of nature, which they would never have believed possible except under the direction of mind:  such are the actions performed by somnambulists while asleep, and wondered at by their performers when awake.  I would further call attention to the mechanism of the human body, which far surpasses in complexity all that has been put together by human art, not to repeat what I have already shown, namely, that from nature, under whatever attribute she be considered, infinite results follow.  As for the second objection, I submit that the world would be much happier, if men were as fully able to keep silence as they are to speak. Experience abundantly shows that men can govern anything more easily than their tongues, and restrain anything more easily than their appetites; when it comes about that many  believe, that we are only free in respect to objects which we moderately desire, because our desire for such can easily be controlled by the thought of something else frequently remembered, but that we are by no means free in respect to what we seek with violent emotion, for our desire cannot then be allayed with the remembrance of anything else.  However, unless such persons had proved by experience that we do many things which we afterwards repent of, and again that we often, when assailed by contrary emotions, see the better and follow the worse, there would be nothing to prevent their believing that we are free in all things.  Thus an infant believes that of its own free will it desires milk, an angry child believes that it freely desires to run away; further, a drunken man believes that he utters from the free decision of his mind words which, when he is sober, he would willingly have withheld:  thus, too, a delirious man, a garrulous woman, a child, and others of like complexion, believe that they speak from the free decision of their mind, when they are in reality unable to restrain their impulse to talk.  Experience teaches us no less clearly than reason, that men believe themselves to be free, simply because they are conscious of their actions, and unconscious of the causes whereby those actions are determined; and, further, it is plain that the dictates of the mind are but another name for the appetites, and therefore vary according to the varying state of the body.  Everyone shapes his actions according to his emotion, those who are assailed by conflicting emotions know not what they wish; those who are not attacked by any emotion are readily swayed this way or that.  All these considerations clearly show that a mental decision and a bodily appetite, or determined state, are simultaneous, or rather are one and the same thing, which we call decision, when it is regarded under and explained through the attribute of thought, and a conditioned state, when it is regarded under the attribute of extension, and deduced from the laws of motion and rest.  This will appear yet more plainly in the sequel.  For the present I wish to call attention to another point, namely, that we cannot act by the decision of the mind, unless we have a remembrance of having done so.  For instance, we cannot say a word without remembering that we have done so.  Again, it is not within the free power of the mind to remember or forget a thing at will.  Therefore the freedom of the mind must in any case be limited to the power of uttering or not uttering something which it remembers. But when we dream that we speak, we believe that we speak from a free decision of the mind, yet we do not speak, or, if we do, it is by a spontaneous motion of the body.  Again, we dream that we are concealing something, and we seem to act from the same decision of the mind as that, whereby we keep silence when awake concerning something we know.  Lastly, we dream that from the free decision of our mind we do something, which we should not dare to do when awake.  Now I should like to know whether there be in the mind two sorts of decisions, one sort illusive, and the other sort free? If our folly does not carry us so far as this, we must necessarily admit, that the decision of the mind, which is believed to be free, is not distinguishable from the imagination or memory, and is nothing more than the affirmation, which an idea, by virtue of being an idea, necessarily involves (II. xlix.). Wherefore these decisions of the mind arise in the mind by the same necessity, as the ideas of things actually existing. Therefore those who believe, that they speak or keep silence or act in any way from the free decision of their mind, do but dream with their eyes open.  III. The activities of the mind arise solely from adequate ideas; the passive states of the mind depend solely on inadequate ideas.  >>>>>Proof--The first element, which constitutes the essence of the mind, is nothing else but the idea of the actually existent body (II. xi. and xiii.), which (II. xv.) is compounded of many other ideas, whereof some are adequate and some inadequate (II. xxix. Cor., II. xxxviii. Cor.).  Whatsoever therefore follows from the nature of mind, and has mind for its proximate cause, through which it must be understood, must necessarily follow either from an adequate or from an inadequate idea.  But in so far as the mind (III. i.) has inadequate ideas, it is necessarily passive:  wherefore the activities of the mind follow solely from adequate ideas, and accordingly the mind is only passive in so far as it has inadequate ideas.  Q.E.D.  *****Note--Thus we see, that passive states are not attributed to the mind, except in so far as it contains something involving negation, or in so far as it is regarded as a part of nature, which cannot be clearly and distinctly perceived through itself without other parts:  I could thus show, that passive states are attributed to individual things in the same way that they are attributed to the mind, and that they cannot otherwise be perceived, but my purpose is solely to treat of the human mind.  IV. Nothing can be destroyed, except by a cause external to itself.  >>>>>Proof--This proposition is self-evident, for the definition of anything affirms the essence of that thing, but does not negative it; in other words, it postulates the essence of the thing, but does not take it away.  So long therefore as we regard only the thing itself, without taking into account external causes, we shall not be able to find in it anything which could destroy it.  Q.E.D.  V. Things are naturally contrary, that is, cannot exist in the same object, in so far as one is capable of destroying the other.  >>>>>Proof--If they could agree together or co-exist in the same object, there would then be in the said object something which could destroy it; but this, by the foregoing proposition, is absurd, therefore things, &c.  Q.E.D.  VI. Everything, in so far as it is in itself, endeavours to persist in its own being.  >>>>>Proof--Individual things are modes whereby the attributes of God are expressed in a given determinate manner (I. xxv.Cor.); that is, (I. xxxiv.), they are things which express in a given determinate manner the power of God, whereby God is and acts; now no thing contains in itself anything whereby it can be destroyed, or which can take away its existence (III. iv.); but contrariwise it is opposed to all that could take away its existence (III. v.).  Therefore, in so far as it can, and in so far as it is in itself, it endeavours to persist in its own being.  Q.E.D.  VII. The endeavour, wherewith everything endeavours to persist in its own being, is nothing else but the actual essence of the thing in question.  >>>>>Proof--From the given essence of any thing certain consequences necessarily follow (I. xxxvi.), nor have things any power save such as necessarily follows from their nature as determined (I. xxix.); wherefore the power of any given thing, or the endeavour whereby, either alone or with other things, it acts, or endeavours to act, that is (III. vi.), the power or endeavour, wherewith it endeavours to persist in its own being, is nothing else but the given or actual essence of the thing in question.  Q.E.D.  VIII. The endeavour, whereby a thing endeavours to persist in its own being, involves no finite time, but an "]]]
