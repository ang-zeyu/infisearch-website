Now look here--let me illustrate.  We pay four cents for a woman's stuff gown, you pay 8.4.0, which is four mills more than _double_.  What do you allow a laboring woman who works on a farm?\"  \"Two mills a day.\"  \"Very good; we allow but half as much; we pay her only a tenth of a cent a day; and--\"  \"Again ye're conf--\"  \"Wait!  Now, you see, the thing is very simple; this time you'll understand it.  For instance, it takes your woman 42 days to earn her gown, at 2 mills a day--7 weeks' work; but ours earns hers in forty days--two days _short_ of 7 weeks.  Your woman has a gown, and her whole seven weeks wages are gone; ours has a gown, and two days' wages left, to buy something else with.  There--_now_ you understand it!\"  He looked--well, he merely looked dubious, it's the most I can say; so did the others.  I waited--to let the thing work.  Dowley spoke at last--and betrayed the fact that he actually hadn't gotten away from his rooted and grounded superstitions yet.  He said, with a trifle of hesitancy:  \"But--but--ye cannot fail to grant that two mills a day is better than one.\"  Shucks!  Well, of course, I hated to give it up.  So I chanced another flyer:  \"Let us suppose a case.  Suppose one of your journeymen goes out and buys the following articles:    \"1 pound of salt;    1 dozen eggs;    1 dozen pints of beer;    1 bushel of wheat;    1 tow-linen suit;    5 pounds of beef;    5 pounds of mutton.  \"The lot will cost him 32 cents.  It takes him 32 working days to earn the money--5 weeks and 2 days.  Let him come to us and work 32 days at _half_ the wages; he can buy all those things for a shade under 14 1/2 cents; they will cost him a shade under 29 days' work, and he will have about half a week's wages over.  Carry it through the year; he would save nearly a week's wages every two months, _your_ man nothing; thus saving five or six weeks' wages in a year, your man not a cent.  _Now_ I reckon you understand that 'high wages' and 'low wages' are phrases that don't mean anything in the world until you find out which of them will _buy_ the most!\"  It was a crusher.  But, alas! it didn't crush.  No, I had to give it up.  What those people valued was _high wages_; it didn't seem to be a matter of any consequence to them whether the high wages would buy anything or not.  They stood for \"protection,\" and swore by it, which was reasonable enough, because interested parties had gulled them into the notion that it was protection which had created their high wages.  I proved to them that in a quarter of a century their wages had advanced but 30 per cent., while the cost of living had gone up 100; and that with us, in a shorter time, wages had advanced 40 per cent. while the cost of living had gone steadily down.  But it didn't do any good.  Nothing could unseat their strange beliefs.  Well, I was smarting under a sense of defeat.  Undeserved defeat, but what of that?  That didn't soften the smart any.  And to think of the circumstances! the first statesman of the age, the capablest man, the best-informed man in the entire world, the loftiest uncrowned head that had moved through the clouds of any political firmament for centuries, sitting here apparently defeated in argument by an ignorant country blacksmith!  And I could see that those others were sorry for me--which made me blush till I could smell my whiskers scorching.  Put yourself in my place; feel as mean as I did, as ashamed as I felt--wouldn't _you_ have struck below the belt to get even?  Yes, you would; it is simply human nature. Well, that is what I did.  I am not trying to justify it; I'm only saying that I was mad, and _anybody_ would have done it.  Well, when I make up my mind to hit a man, I don't plan out a love-tap; no, that isn't my way; as long as I'm going to hit him at all, I'm going to hit him a lifter.  And I don't jump at him all of a sudden, and risk making a blundering half-way business of it; no, I get away off yonder to one side, and work up on him gradually, so that he never suspects that I'm going to hit him at all; and by and by, all in a flash, he's flat on his back, and he can't tell for the life of him how it all happened.  That is the way I went for brother Dowley.  I started to talking lazy and comfortable, as if I was just talking to pass the time; and the oldest man in the world couldn't have taken the bearings of my starting place and guessed where I was going to fetch up:  \"Boys, there's a good many curious things about law, and custom, and usage, and all that sort of thing, when you come to look at it; yes, and about the drift and progress of human opinion and movement, too.  There are written laws--they perish; but there are also unwritten laws--_they_ are eternal.  Take the unwritten law of wages: it says they've got to advance, little by little, straight through the centuries.  And notice how it works.  We know what wages are now, here and there and yonder; we strike an average, and say that's the wages of to-day.  We know what the wages were a hundred years ago, and what they were two hundred years ago; that's as far back as we can get, but it suffices to give us the law of progress, the measure and rate of the periodical augmentation; and so, without a document to help us, we can come pretty close to determining what the wages were three and four and five hundred years ago. Good, so far.  Do we stop there?  No.  We stop looking backward; we face around and apply the law to the future.  My friends, I can tell you what people's wages are going to be at any date in the future you want to know, for hundreds and hundreds of years.\"  \"What, goodman, what!\"  \"Yes.  In seven hundred years wages will have risen to six times what they are now, here in your region, and farm hands will be allowed 3 cents a day, and mechanics 6.\"  \"I would't I might die now and live then!\" interrupted Smug, the wheelwright, with a fine avaricious glow in his eye.  \"And that isn't all; they'll get their board besides--such as it is: it won't bloat them.  Two hundred and fifty years later--pay attention now--a mechanic's wages will be--mind you, this is law, not guesswork; a mechanic's wages will then be _twenty_ cents a day!\"  There was a general gasp of awed astonishment, Dickon the mason murmured, with raised eyes and hands:  \"More than three weeks' pay for one day's work!\"  \"Riches!--of a truth, yes, riches!\" muttered Marco, his breath coming quick and short, with excitement.  \"Wages will keep on rising, little by little, little by little, as steadily as a tree grows, and at the end of three hundred and forty years more there'll be at least _one_ country where the mechanic's average wage will be _two hundred_ cents a day!\"  It knocked them absolutely dumb!  Not a man of them could get his breath for upwards of two minutes.  Then the coal-burner said prayerfully:  \"Might I but live to see it!\"  \"It is the income of an earl!\" said Smug.  \"An earl, say ye?\" said Dowley; \"ye could say more than that and speak no lie; there's no earl in the realm of Bagdemagus that hath an income like to that.  Income of an earl--mf! it's the income of an angel!\"  \"Now, then, that is what is going to happen as regards wages. In that remote day, that man will earn, with _one_ week's work, that bill of goods which it takes you upwards of _fifty_ weeks to earn now.  Some other pretty surprising things are going to happen, too.  Brother Dowley, who is it that determines, every spring, what the particular wage of each kind of mechanic, laborer, and servant shall be for that year?\"  \"Sometimes the courts, sometimes the town council; but most of all, the magistrate.  Ye may say, in general terms, it is the magistrate that fixes the wages.\"  \"Doesn't ask any of those poor devils to _help_ him fix their wages for them, does he?\"  \"Hm!  That _were_ an idea!  The master that's to pay him the money is the one that's rightly concerned in that matter, ye will notice.\"  \"Yes--but I thought the other man might have some little trifle at stake in it, too; and even his wife and children, poor creatures. The masters are these: nobles, rich men, the prosperous generally. These few, who do no work, determine what pay the vast hive shall have who _do_ work.  You see?  They're a 'combine'--a trade union, to coin a new phrase--who band themselves together to force their lowly brother to take what they choose to give.  Thirteen hundred years hence--so says the unwritten law--the 'combine' will be the other way, and then how these fine people's posterity will fume and fret and grit their teeth over the insolent tyranny of trade unions!  Yes, indeed! the magistrate will tranquilly arrange the wages from now clear away down into the nineteenth century; and then all of a sudden the wage-earner will consider that a couple of thousand years or so is enough of this one-sided sort of thing; and he will rise up and take a hand in fixing his wages himself. Ah, he will have a long and bitter account of wrong and humiliation to settle.\"  \"Do ye believe--\"  \"That he actually will help to fix his own wages?  Yes, indeed. And he will be strong and able, then.\"  \"Brave times, brave times, of a truth!\" sneered the prosperous smith.  \"Oh,--and there's another detail.  In that day, a master may hire a man for only just one day, or one week, or one month at a time, if he wants to.\"  \"What?\"  \"It's true.  Moreover, a magistrate won't be able to force a man to work for a master a whole year on a stretch whether the man wants to or not.\"  \"Will there be _no_ law or sense in that day?\"  \"Both of them, Dowley.  In that day a man will be his own property, not the property of magistrate and master.  And he can leave town whenever he wants to, if the wages don't suit him!--and they can't put him in the pillory for it.\"  \"Perdition catch such an age!\" shouted Dowley, in strong indignation. \"An age of dogs, an age barren of reverence for superiors and respect for authority!"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7249"],["title","A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court, Part 8. (#1)"],["body","y--everybody gone! That is, everybody except one body--the slave-master's.  It lay there all battered to pulp; and all about were the evidences of a terrific fight.  There was a rude board coffin on a cart at the door, and workmen, assisted by the police, were thinning a road through the gaping crowd in order that they might bring it in.  I picked out a man humble enough in life to condescend to talk with one so shabby as I, and got his account of the matter.  \"There were sixteen slaves here.  They rose against their master in the night, and thou seest how it ended.\"  \"Yes.  How did it begin?\"  \"There was no witness but the slaves.  They said the slave that was most valuable got free of his bonds and escaped in some strange way--by magic arts 'twas thought, by reason that he had no key, and the locks were neither broke nor in any wise injured.  When the master discovered his loss, he was mad with despair, and threw himself upon his people with his heavy stick, who resisted and brake his back and in other and divers ways did give him hurts that brought him swiftly to his end.\"  \"This is dreadful.  It will go hard with the slaves, no doubt, upon the trial.\"  \"Marry, the trial is over.\"  \"Over!\"  \"Would they be a week, think you--and the matter so simple?  They were not the half of a quarter of an hour at it.\"  \"Why, I don't see how they could determine which were the guilty ones in so short a time.\"  \"_Which_ ones?  Indeed, they considered not particulars like to that. They condemned them in a body.  Wit ye not the law?--which men say the Romans left behind them here when they went--that if one slave killeth his master all the slaves of that man must die for it.\"  \"True.  I had forgotten.  And when will these die?\"  \"Belike within a four and twenty hours; albeit some say they will wait a pair of days more, if peradventure they may find the missing one meantime.\"  The missing one!  It made me feel uncomfortable.  \"Is it likely they will find him?\"  \"Before the day is spent--yes.  They seek him everywhere.  They stand at the gates of the town, with certain of the slaves who will discover him to them if he cometh, and none can pass out but he will be first examined.\"  \"Might one see the place where the rest are confined?\"  \"The outside of it--yes.  The inside of it--but ye will not want to see that.\"  I took the address of that prison for future reference and then sauntered off.  At the first second-hand clothing shop I came to, up a back street, I got a rough rig suitable for a common seaman who might be going on a cold voyage, and bound up my face with a liberal bandage, saying I had a toothache.  This concealed my worst bruises.  It was a transformation.  I no longer resembled my former self.  Then I struck out for that wire, found it and followed it to its den.  It was a little room over a butcher's shop--which meant that business wasn't very brisk in the telegraphic line.  The young chap in charge was drowsing at his table.  I locked the door and put the vast key in my bosom.  This alarmed the young fellow, and he was going to make a noise; but I said:  \"Save your wind; if you open your mouth you are dead, sure.  Tackle your instrument.  Lively, now!  Call Camelot.\"  \"This doth amaze me!  How should such as you know aught of such matters as--\"  \"Call Camelot!  I am a desperate man.  Call Camelot, or get away from the instrument and I will do it myself.\"  \"What--you?\"  \"Yes--certainly.  Stop gabbling.  Call the palace.\"  He made the call.  \"Now, then, call Clarence.\"  \"Clarence _who_?\"  \"Never mind Clarence who.  Say you want Clarence; you'll get an answer.\"  He did so.  We waited five nerve-straining minutes--ten minutes --how long it did seem!--and then came a click that was as familiar to me as a human voice; for Clarence had been my own pupil.  \"Now, my lad, vacate!  They would have known _my_ touch, maybe, and so your call was surest; but I'm all right now.\"  He vacated the place and cocked his ear to listen--but it didn't win.  I used a cipher.  I didn't waste any time in sociabilities with Clarence, but squared away for business, straight-off--thus:  \"The king is here and in danger.  We were captured and brought here as slaves.  We should not be able to prove our identity --and the fact is, I am not in a position to try.  Send a telegram for the palace here which will carry conviction with it.\"  His answer came straight back:  \"They don't know anything about the telegraph; they haven't had any experience yet, the line to London is so new.  Better not venture that.  They might hang you.  Think up something else.\"  Might hang us!  Little he knew how closely he was crowding the facts.  I couldn't think up anything for the moment.  Then an idea struck me, and I started it along:  \"Send five hundred picked knights with Launcelot in the lead; and send them on the jump.  Let them enter by the southwest gate, and look out for the man with a white cloth around his right arm.\"  The answer was prompt:  \"They shall start in half an hour.\"  \"All right, Clarence; now tell this lad here that I'm a friend of yours and a dead-head; and that he must be discreet and say nothing about this visit of mine.\"  The instrument began to talk to the youth and I hurried away. I fell to ciphering.  In half an hour it would be nine o'clock. Knights and horses in heavy armor couldn't travel very fast. These would make the best time they could, and now that the ground was in good condition, and no snow or mud, they would probably make a seven-mile gait; they would have to change horses a couple of times; they would arrive about six, or a little after; it would still be plenty light enough; they would see the white cloth which I should tie around my right arm, and I would take command.  We would surround that prison and have the king out in no time. It would be showy and picturesque enough, all things considered, though I would have preferred noonday, on account of the more theatrical aspect the thing would have.  Now, then, in order to increase the strings to my bow, I thought I would look up some of those people whom I had formerly recognized, and make myself known.  That would help us out of our scrape, without the knights.  But I must proceed cautiously, for it was a risky business.  I must get into sumptuous raiment, and it wouldn't do to run and jump into it.  No, I must work up to it by degrees, buying suit after suit of clothes, in shops wide apart, and getting a little finer article with each change, until I should finally reach silk and velvet, and be ready for my project.  So I started.  But the scheme fell through like scat!  The first corner I turned, I came plump upon one of our slaves, snooping around with a watchman. I coughed at the moment, and he gave me a sudden look that bit right into my marrow.  I judge he thought he had heard that cough before. I turned immediately into a shop and worked along down the counter, pricing things and watching out of the corner of my eye.  Those people had stopped, and were talking together and looking in at the door.  I made up my mind to get out the back way, if there was a back way, and I asked the shopwoman if I could step out there and look for the escaped slave, who was believed to be in hiding back there somewhere, and said I was an officer in disguise, and my pard was yonder at the door with one of the murderers in charge, and would she be good enough to step there and tell him he needn't wait, but had better go at once to the further end of the back alley and be ready to head him off when I rousted him out.  She was blazing with eagerness to see one of those already celebrated murderers, and she started on the errand at once.  I slipped out the back way, locked the door behind me, put the key in my pocket and started off, chuckling to myself and comfortable.  Well, I had gone and spoiled it again, made another mistake. A double one, in fact.  There were plenty of ways to get rid of that officer by some simple and plausible device, but no, I must pick out a picturesque one; it is the crying defect of my character. And then, I had ordered my procedure upon what the officer, being human, would _naturally_ do; whereas when you are least expecting it, a man will now and then go and do the very thing which it's _not_ natural for him to do.  The natural thing for the officer to do, in this case, was to follow straight on my heels; he would find a stout oaken door, securely locked, between him and me; before he could break it down, I should be far away and engaged in slipping into a succession of baffling disguises which would soon get me into a sort of raiment which was a surer protection from meddling law-dogs in Britain than any amount of mere innocence and purity of character.  But instead of doing the natural thing, the officer took me at my word, and followed my instructions.  And so, as I came trotting out of that cul de sac, full of satisfaction with my own cleverness, he turned the corner and I walked right into his handcuffs.  If I had known it was a cul de sac--however, there isn't any excusing a blunder like that, let it go.  Charge it up to profit and loss.  Of course, I was indignant, and swore I had just come ashore from a long voyage, and all that sort of thing--just to see, you know, if it would deceive that slave.  But it didn't.  He knew me.  Then I reproached him for betraying me.  He was more surprised than hurt.  He stretched his eyes wide, and said:  \"What, wouldst have me let thee, of all men, escape and not hang with us, when thou'rt the very _cause_ of our hanging?  Go to!\"  \"Go to\" was their way of saying \"I should smile!\" or \"I like that!\" Queer talkers, those people.  Well, there was a sort of bastard justice in his view of the case, and so I dropped the matter.  When you can't cure a disaster by argument, what is the use to argue?  It isn't my way.  So I only said:  \"You're not going to be hanged.  None of us are.\"  Both men laughed, and the slave said:  "]]]
