Princess Ozma took the Sawhorse and the Red Wagon, although she was not sure there was a wagon road all the way to the Lake of the Skeezers. The Land of Oz is a pretty big place, surrounded on all sides by a Deadly Desert which it is impossible to cross, and the Skeezer Country, according to the map, was in the farthest northwestern part of Oz, bordering on the north desert. As the Emerald City was exactly in the center of Oz, it was no small journey from there to the Skeezers.  Around the Emerald City the country is thickly settled in every direction, but the farther away you get from the city the fewer people there are, until those parts that border on the desert have small populations. Also those faraway sections are little known to the Oz people, except in the south, where Glinda lives and where Dorothy has often wandered on trips of exploration.  The least known of all is the Gillikin Country, which harbors many strange bands of people among its mountains and valleys and forests and streams, and Ozma was now bound for the most distant part of the Gillikin Country.  \"I am really sorry,\" said Ozma to Dorothy, as they rode away in the Red Wagon, \"not to know more about the wonderful Land I rule. It is my duty to be acquainted with every tribe of people and every strange and hidden country in all Oz, but I am kept so busy at my palace making laws and planning for the comforts of those who live near the Emerald City, that I do not often find time to make long journeys.\"  \"Well,\" replied Dorothy, \"we'll prob'bly find out a lot on this trip, and we'll learn all about the Skeezers and Flatheads, anyhow. Time doesn't make much diff'rence in the Land of Oz, 'cause we don't grow up, or get old, or become sick and die, as they do other places; so, if we explore one place at a time, we'll by-an'-by know all about every nook and corner in Oz.\"  Dorothy wore around her waist the Nome King's Magic Belt, which protected her from harm, and the Magic Ring which Glinda had given her was on her finger. Ozma had merely slipped a small silver wand into the bosom of her gown, for fairies do not use chemicals and herbs and the tools of wizards and sorcerers to perform their magic. The Silver Wand was Ozma's one weapon of offense and defense and by its use she could accomplish many things.  They had left the Emerald City just at sunrise and the Sawhorse traveled very swiftly over the roads towards the north, but in a few hours the wooden animal had to slacken his pace because the farm houses had become few and far between and often there were no paths at all in the direction they wished to follow. At such times they crossed the fields, avoiding groups of trees and fording the streams and rivulets whenever they came to them. But finally they reached a broad hillside closely covered with scrubby brush, through which the wagon could not pass.  \"It will be difficult even for you and me to get through without tearing our dresses,\" said Ozma, \"so we must leave the Sawhorse and the Wagon here until our return.\"  \"That's all right,\" Dorothy replied, \"I'm tired riding, anyhow. Do you s'pose, Ozma, we're anywhere near the Skeezer Country?\"  \"I cannot tell, Dorothy dear, but I know we've been going in the right direction, so we are sure to find it in time.\"  The scrubby brush was almost like a grove of small trees, for it reached as high as the heads of the two girls, neither of whom was very tall. They were obliged to thread their way in and out, until Dorothy was afraid they would get lost, and finally they were halted by a curious thing that barred their further progress. It was a huge web--as if woven by gigantic spiders--and the delicate, lacy film was fastened stoutly to the branches of the bushes and continued to the right and left in the form of a half circle. The threads of this web were of a brilliant purple color and woven into numerous artistic patterns, but it reached from the ground to branches above the heads of the girls and formed a sort of fence that hedged them in.  \"It doesn't look very strong, though,\" said Dorothy. \"I wonder if we couldn't break through.\" She tried but found the web stronger than it seemed. All her efforts could not break a single thread.  \"We must go back, I think, and try to get around this peculiar web,\" Ozma decided.  So they turned to the right and, following the web found that it seemed to spread in a regular circle. On and on they went until finally Ozma said they had returned to the exact spot from which they had started. \"Here is a handkerchief you dropped when we were here before,\" she said to Dorothy.  \"In that case, they must have built the web behind us, after we walked into the trap,\" exclaimed the little girl.  \"True,\" agreed Ozma, \"an enemy has tried to imprison us.\"  \"And they did it, too,\" said Dorothy. \"I wonder who it was.\"  \"It's a spider-web, I'm quite sure,\" returned Ozma, \"but it must be the work of enormous spiders.\"  \"Quite right!\" cried a voice behind them. Turning quickly around they beheld a huge purple spider sitting not two yards away and regarding them with its small bright eyes.  Then there crawled from the bushes a dozen more great purple spiders, which saluted the first one and said:  \"The web is finished, O King, and the strangers are our prisoners.\"  Dorothy did not like the looks of these spiders at all. They had big heads, sharp claws, small eyes and fuzzy hair all over their purple bodies.  \"They look wicked,\" she whispered to Ozma. \"What shall we do?\"  Ozma gazed upon the spiders with a serious face.  \"What is your object in making us prisoners?\" she inquired.  \"We need someone to keep house for us,\" answered the Spider King. \"There is sweeping and dusting to be done, and polishing and washing of dishes, and that is work my people dislike to do. So we decided that if any strangers came our way we would capture them and make them our servants.\"  \"I am Princess Ozma, Ruler of all Oz,\" said the girl with dignity.  \"Well, I am King of all Spiders,\" was the reply, \"and that makes me your master. Come with me to my palace and I will instruct you in your work.\"  \"I won't,\" said Dorothy indignantly. \"We won't have anything to do with you.\"  \"We'll see about that,\" returned the Spider in a severe tone, and the next instant he made a dive straight at Dorothy, opening the claws in his legs as if to grab and pinch her with the sharp points. But the girl was wearing her Magic Belt and was not harmed. The Spider King could not even touch her. He turned swiftly and made a dash at Ozma, but she held her Magic Wand over his head and the monster recoiled as if it had been struck.  \"You'd better let us go,\" Dorothy advised him, \"for you see you can't hurt us.\"  \"So I see,\" returned the Spider King angrily. \"Your magic is greater than mine. But I'll not help you to escape. If you can break the magic web my people have woven you may go; if not you must stay here and starve.\" With that the Spider King uttered a peculiar whistle and all the spiders disappeared.  \"There is more magic in my fairyland than I dreamed of,\" remarked the beautiful Ozma, with a sigh of regret. \"It seems that my laws have not been obeyed, for even these monstrous spiders defy me by means of Magic.\"  \"Never mind that now,\" said Dorothy; \"let's see what we can do to get out of this trap.\"  They now examined the web with great care and were amazed at its strength. Although finer than the finest silken hairs, it resisted all their efforts to work through, even though both girls threw all their weight against it.  \"We must find some instrument which will cut the threads of the web,\" said Ozma, finally. \"Let us look about for such a tool.\"  So they wandered among the bushes and finally came to a shallow pool of water, formed by a small bubbling spring. Dorothy stooped to get a drink and discovered in the water a green crab, about as big as her hand. The crab had two big, sharp claws, and as soon as Dorothy saw them she had an idea that those claws could save them.  \"Come out of the water,\" she called to the crab; \"I want to talk to you.\"  Rather lazily the crab rose to the surface and caught hold of a bit of rock. With his head above the water he said in a cross voice:  \"What do you want?\"  \"We want you to cut the web of the purple spiders with your claws, so we can get through it,\" answered Dorothy. \"You can do that, can't you?\"  \"I suppose so,\" replied the crab. \"But if I do what will you give me?\"  \"What do you wish?\" Ozma inquired.  \"I wish to be white, instead of green,\" said the crab. \"Green crabs are very common, and white ones are rare; besides the purple spiders, which infest this hillside, are afraid of white crabs. Could you make me white if I should agree to cut the web for you?\"  \"Yes,\" said Ozma, \"I can do that easily. And, so you may know I am speaking the truth, I will change your color now.\"  She waved her silver wand over the pool and the crab instantly became snow-white--all except his eyes, which remained black. The creature saw his reflection in the water and was so delighted that he at once climbed out of the pool and began moving slowly toward the web, by backing away from the pool. He moved so very slowly that Dorothy cried out impatiently: \"Dear me, this will never do!\" Caching the crab in her hands she ran with him to the web.  She had to hold him up even then, so he could reach with his claws strand after strand of the filmy purple web, which he was able to sever with one nip.  When enough of the web had been cut to allow them to pass, Dorothy ran back to the pool and placed the white crab in the water, after which she rejoined Ozma. They were just in time to escape through the web, for several of the purple spiders now appeared, having discovered that their web had been cut, and had the girls not rushed through the opening the spiders would have quickly repaired the cuts and again imprisoned them.  Ozma and Dorothy ran as fast as they could and although the angry spiders threw"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9612"],["title","The Botanic Garden (#1)"],["body"," Down the steep slopes He led with modest skill      The willing pathway, and the truant rill,  55  Stretch'd o'er the marshy vale yon willowy mound,      Where shines the lake amid the tufted ground,      Raised the young woodland, smooth'd the wavy green,      And gave to Beauty all the quiet scene.--         She comes!--the GODDESS!--through the whispering air,  60  Bright as the morn, descends her blushing car;      Each circling wheel a wreath of flowers intwines,      And gem'd with flowers the silken harness shines;      The golden bits with flowery studs are deck'd,      And knots of flowers the crimson reins connect.--  65  And now on earth the silver axle rings,      And the shell sinks upon its slender springs;      Light from her airy seat the Goddess bounds,      And steps celestial press the pansied grounds.

The Rosicrucian doctrine of Gnomes, Sylphs, Nymphs, and Salamanders affords proper machinery for a philosophic poem; as it is probable that they were originally the names of hieroglyphic figures of the Elements, or of Genii presiding over their operations. The Fairies of more modern days seem to have been derived from them, and to have inherited their powers. The Gnomes and Sylphs, as being more nearly allied to modern Fairies are represented as either male or female, which distinguishes the latter from the Aurae of the Latin Poets, which were only female; except the winds, as Zephyrus and Auster, may be supposed to have been their husbands.]          First the fine Forms her dulcet voice requires,      Which bathe or bask in elemental fires;      From each bright gem of Day's refulgent car,      From the pale sphere of every twinkling star,  85  From each nice pore of ocean, earth, and air,      With eye of flame the sparkling hosts repair,      Mix their gay hues, in changeful circles play,      Like motes, that tenant the meridian ray.--      So the clear Lens collects with magic power  90  The countless glories of the midnight hour;      Stars after stars with quivering lustre fall,      And twinkling glide along the whiten'd wall.--      Pleased, as they pass, she counts the glittering bands,      And stills their murmur with her waving hands;  95  Each listening tribe with fond expectance burns,      And now to these, and now to those, she turns.

[_Nymphs of primeval fire_. l. 97. The fluid matter of heat is perhaps the most extensive element in nature; all other bodies are immersed in it, and are preserved in their present state of solidity or fluidity by the attraction of their particles to the matter of heat. Since all known bodies are contractible into less space by depriving them of some portion of their heat, and as there is no part of nature totally deprived of heat, there is reason to believe that the particles of bodies do not touch, but are held towards each other by their self- attraction, and recede from each other by their attraction to the mass of heat which surrounds them; and thus exist in an equilibrium between these two powers. If more of the matter of heat be applied to them, they recede further from each other, and become fluid; if still more be applied, they take an aerial form, and are termed Gasses by the modern chemists. Thus when water is heated to a certain degree, it would instantly assume the form of steam, but for the pressure of the atmosphere, which prevents this change from taking place so easily; the same is true of quicksilver, diamonds, and of perhaps all other bodies in Nature; they would first become fluid, and then aeriform by appropriated degrees of heat. On the contrary, this elastic matter of heat, termed Calorique in the new nomenclature of the French Academicians, is liable to become consolidated itself in its combinations with some bodies, as perhaps in nitre, and probably in combustible bodies as sulphur and charcoal. See note on l. 232, of this Canto. Modern philosophers have not yet been able to decide whether light and heat be different fluids, or modifications of the same fluid, as they have many properties in common. See note on l. 462 of this Canto.]  [_When Love Divine_. l. 101. From having observed the gradual evolution of the young animal or plant from its egg or seed; and afterwards its successive advances to its more perfect state, or maturity; philosophers of all ages seem to have imagined, that the great world itself had likewise its infancy and its gradual progress to maturity; this seems to have given origin to the very antient and sublime allegory of Eros, or Divine Love, producing the world from the egg of Night, as it floated in Chaos. See l. 419. of this Canto.  The external crust of the earth, as far as it has been exposed to our view in mines or mountains, countenances this opinion; since these have evidently for the most part had their origin from the shells of fishes, the decomposition of vegetables, and the recrements of other animal materials, and must therefore have been formed progressively from small beginnings. There are likewise some apparently useless or incomplete appendages to plants and animals, which seem to shew they have gradually undergone changes from their original state; such as the stamens without anthers, and styles without stigmas of several plants, as mentioned in the note on Curcuma, Vol. II. of this work. Such is the halteres, or rudiments of wings of some two-winged insects; and the paps of male animals; thus swine have four toes, but two of them are imperfectly formed, and not long enough for use. The allantoide in some animals seems to have become extinct; in others is above tenfold the size, which would seem necessary for its purpose. Buffon du Cochon. T. 6. p. 257. Perhaps all the supposed monstrous births of Nature are remains of their habits of production in their former less perfect state, or attempts towards greater perfection.]  [_Through all his realms_. l. 105. Mr. Herschel has given a very sublime and curious account of the construction of the heavens with his discovery of some thousand nebulae, or clouds of stars; many of which are much larger collections of stars, than all those put together, which are visible to our naked eyes, added to those which form the galaxy, or milky zone, which surrounds us. He observes that in the vicinity of these clusters of stars there are proportionally fewer stars than in other parts of the heavens; and hence he concludes, that they have attracted each other, on the supposition that infinite space was at first equally sprinkled with them; as if it had at the beginning been filled with a fluid mass, which had coagulated. Mr. Herschel has further shewn, that the whole sidereal system is gradually moving round some centre, which may be an opake mass of matter, Philos. Trans. V. LXXIV. If all these Suns are moving round some great central body; they must have had a projectile force, as well as a centripetal one; and may thence be supposed to have emerged or been projected from the material, where they were produced. We can have no idea of a natural power, which could project a Sun out of Chaos, except by comparing it to the explosions or earthquakes owing to the sudden evolution of aqueous or of other more elastic vapours; of the power of which under immeasurable degrees of heat, and compression, we are yet ignorant.  It may be objected, that if the stars had been projected from a Chaos by explosions, that they must have returned again into it from the known laws of gravitation; this however would not happen, if the whole of Chaos, like grains of gunpowder, was exploded at the same time, and dispersed through infinite space at once, or in quick succession, in every possible direction. The same objection may be stated against the possibility of the planets having been thrown from the sun by explosions; and the secondary planets from the primary ones; which will be spoken of more at large in the second Canto, but if the planets are supposed to have been projected from their suns, and the secondary from the primary ones, at the beginning of their course; they might be so influenced or diverted by the attractions of the suns, or sun, in their vicinity, as to prevent their tendency to return into the body, from which they were projected.  If these innumerable and immense suns thus rising out of Chaos are supposed to have thrown out their attendant planets by new explosions, as they ascended; and those their "]]]
