Birds are a good sentry; in forest places they be the first line of battle.  Look you, now, if we lay here in camp, there might be archers skulking down to get the wind of us; and here would you be, none the wiser!\"  \"Why, old shrew,\" said Hatch, \"there be no men nearer us than Sir Daniel's, at Kettley; y' are as safe as in London Tower; and ye raise scares upon a man for a few chaffinches and sparrows!\"  \"Hear him!\" grinned Appleyard.  \"How many a rogue would give his two crop ears to have a shoot at either of us?  Saint Michael, man! they hate us like two polecats!\"  \"Well, sooth it is, they hate Sir Daniel,\" answered Hatch, a little sobered.  \"Ay, they hate Sir Daniel, and they hate every man that serves with him,\" said Appleyard; \"and in the first order of hating, they hate Bennet Hatch and old Nicholas the bowman.  See ye here: if there was a stout fellow yonder in the wood-edge, and you and I stood fair for him--as, by Saint George, we stand!--which, think ye, would he choose?\"  \"You, for a good wager,\" answered Hatch.  \"My surcoat to a leather belt, it would be you!\" cried the old archer. \"Ye burned Grimstone, Bennet--they'll ne'er forgive you that, my master. And as for me, I'll soon be in a good place, God grant, and out of bow-shoot--ay, and cannon-shoot--of all their malices.  I am an old man, and draw fast to homeward, where the bed is ready.  But for you, Bennet, y' are to remain behind here at your own peril, and if ye come to my years unhanged, the old true-blue English spirit will be dead.\"  \"Y' are the shrewishest old dolt in Tunstall Forest,\" returned Hatch, visibly ruffled by these threats.  \"Get ye to your arms before Sir Oliver come, and leave prating for one good while.  An ye had talked so much with Harry the Fift, his ears would ha' been richer than his pocket.\"  An arrow sang in the air, like a huge hornet; it struck old Appleyard between the shoulder-blades, and pierced him clean through, and he fell forward on his face among the cabbages.  Hatch, with a broken cry, leapt into the air; then, stooping double, he ran for the cover of the house. And in the meanwhile Dick Shelton had dropped behind a lilac, and had his crossbow bent and shouldered, covering the point of the forest.  Not a leaf stirred.  The sheep were patiently browsing; the birds had settled.  But there lay the old man, with a cloth-yard arrow standing in his back; and there were Hatch holding to the gable, and Dick crouching and ready behind the lilac bush.  \"D'ye see aught?\" cried Hatch.  \"Not a twig stirs,\" said Dick.  \"I think shame to leave him lying,\" said Bennet, coming forward once more with hesitating steps and a very pale countenance.  \"Keep a good eye on the wood, Master Shelton--keep a clear eye on the wood.  The saints assoil us! here was a good shoot!\"  Bennet raised the old archer on his knee.  He was not yet dead; his face worked, and his eyes shut and opened like machinery, and he had a most horrible, ugly look of one in pain.  \"Can ye hear, old Nick?\" asked Hatch.  \"Have ye a last wish before ye wend, old brother?\"  \"Pluck out the shaft, and let me pass, a' Mary's name!\" gasped Appleyard. \"I be done with Old England.  Pluck it out!\"  \"Master Dick,\" said Bennet, \"come hither, and pull me a good pull upon the arrow.  He would fain pass, the poor sinner.\"  Dick laid down his cross-bow, and pulling hard upon the arrow, drew it forth.  A gush of blood followed; the old archer scrambled half upon his feet, called once upon the name of God, and then fell dead.  Hatch, upon his knees among the cabbages, prayed fervently for the welfare of the passing spirit.  But even as he prayed, it was plain that his mind was still divided, and he kept ever an eye upon the corner of the wood from which the shot had come.  When he had done, he got to his feet again, drew off one of his mailed gauntlets, and wiped his pale face, which was all wet with terror.  \"Ay,\" he said, \"it'll be my turn next.\"  \"Who hath done this, Bennet?\" Richard asked, still holding the arrow in his hand.  \"Nay, the saints know,\" said Hatch.  \"Here are a good two score Christian souls that we have hunted out of house and holding, he and I.  He has paid his shot, poor shrew, nor will it be long, mayhap, ere I pay mine. Sir Daniel driveth over-hard.\"  \"This is a strange shaft,\" said the lad, looking at the arrow in his hand.  \"Ay, by my faith!\" cried Bennet.  \"Black, and black-feathered.  Here is an ill-favoured shaft, by my sooth! for black, they say, bodes burial. And here be words written.  Wipe the blood away.  What read ye?\"  \"'_Appulyaird fro Jon Amend-All_,'\" read Shelton.  \"What should this betoken?\"  \"Nay, I like it not,\" returned the retainer, shaking his head.  \"John Amend-All!  Here is a rogue's name for those that be up in the world! But why stand we here to make a mark?  Take him by the knees, good Master Shelton, while I lift him by the shoulders, and let us lay him in his house.  This will be a rare shog to poor Sir Oliver; he will turn paper colour; he will pray like a windmill.\"  They took up the old archer, and carried him between them into his house, where he had dwelt alone.  And there they laid him on the floor, out of regard for the mattress, and sought, as best they might, to straighten and compose his limbs.  Appleyard's house was clean and bare.  There was a bed, with a blue cover, a cupboard, a great chest, a pair of joint-stools, a hinged table in the chimney corner, and hung upon the wall the old soldier's armoury of bows and defensive armour.  Hatch began to look about him curiously.  \"Nick had money,\" he said.  \"He may have had three score pounds put by. I would I could light upon't!  When ye lose an old friend, Master Richard, the best consolation is to heir him.  See, now, this chest.  I would go a mighty wager there is a bushel of gold therein.  He had a strong hand to get, and a hard hand to keep withal, had Appleyard the archer.  Now may God rest his spirit!  Near eighty year he was afoot and about, and ever getting; but now he's on the broad of his back, poor shrew, and no more lacketh; and if his chattels came to a good friend, he would be merrier, methinks, in heaven.\"  \"Come, Hatch,\" said Dick, \"respect his stone-blind eyes.  Would ye rob the man before his body?  Nay, he would walk!\"  Hatch made several signs of the cross; but by this time his natural complexion had returned, and he was not easily to be dashed from any purpose.  It would have gone hard with the chest had not the gate sounded, and presently after the door of the house opened and admitted a tall, portly, ruddy, black-eyed man of near fifty, in a surplice and black robe.  \"Appleyard\"--the newcomer was saying, as he entered; but he stopped dead. \"Ave Maria!\" he cried.  \"Saints be our shield!  What cheer is this?\"  \"Cold cheer with Appleyard, sir parson,\" answered Hatch, with perfect cheerfulness.  \"Shot at his own door, and alighteth even now at purgatory gates.  Ay! there, if tales be true, he shall lack neither coal nor candle.\"  Sir Oliver groped his way to a joint-stool, and sat down upon it, sick and white.  \"This is a judgment!  O, a great stroke!\" he sobbed, and rattled off a leash of prayers.  Hatch meanwhile reverently doffed his salet and knelt down.  \"Ay, Bennet,\" said the priest, somewhat recovering, \"and what may this be?  What enemy hath done this?\"  \"Here, Sir Oliver, is the arrow.  See, it is written upon with words,\" said Dick.  \"Nay,\" cried the priest, \"this is a foul hearing!  John Amend-All!  A right Lollardy word.  And black of hue, as for an omen!  Sirs, this knave arrow likes me not.  But it importeth rather to take counsel.  Who should this be?  Bethink you, Bennet.  Of so many black ill-willers, which should he be that doth so hardily outface us?  Simnel?  I do much question it.  The Walsinghams?  Nay, they are not yet so broken; they still think to have the law over us, when times change.  There was Simon Malmesbury, too.  How think ye, Bennet?\"  \"What think ye, sir,\" returned Hatch, \"of Ellis Duckworth?\"  \"Nay, Bennet, never.  Nay, not he,\" said the priest.  \"There cometh never any rising, Bennet, from below--so all judicious chroniclers concord in their opinion; but rebellion travelleth ever downward from above; and when Dick, Tom, and Harry take them to their bills, look ever narrowly to see what lord is profited thereby.  Now, Sir Daniel, having once more joined him to the Queen's party, is in ill odour with the Yorkist lords. Thence, Bennet, comes the blow--by what procuring, I yet seek; but therein lies the nerve of this discomfiture.\"  \"An't please you, Sir Oliver,\" said Bennet, \"the axles are so hot in this country that I have long been smelling fire.  So did this poor sinner, Appleyard.  And, by your leave, men's spirits are so foully inclined to all of us, that it needs neither York nor Lancaster to spur them on. Hear my plain thoughts: You, that are a clerk, and Sir Daniel, that sails on any wind, ye have taken many men's goods, and beaten and hanged not a few.  Y' are called to count for this; in the end, I wot not how, ye have ever the uppermost at law, and ye think all patched.  But give me leave, Sir Oliver: the man that ye have dispossessed and beaten is but the angrier, and some day, when the black devil is by, he will up with his bow and clout me a yard of arrow through your inwards.\"  \"Nay, Bennet, y' are in the wrong.  Bennet, ye should be glad to be corrected,\" said Sir Oliver.  \"Y' are a prater, Bennet, a talker, a babbler; your mouth is wider than your two ears.  Mend it, Bennet, mend it.\"  \"Nay, I say no more.  Have it as ye list,\" said "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/848"],["title","The Black Arrow: A Tale of Two Roses (#2)"],["body","retainer.  The priest now rose from the stool, and from the writing-case that hung about his neck took forth wax and a taper, and a flint and steel.  With these he sealed up the chest and the cupboard with Sir Daniel's arms, Hatch looking on disconsolate; and then the whole party proceeded, somewhat timorously, to sally from the house and get to horse.  \"'Tis time we were on the road, Sir Oliver,\" said Hatch, as he held the priest's stirrup while he mounted.  \"Ay; but, Bennet, things are changed,\" returned the parson.  \"There is now no Appleyard--rest his soul!--to keep the garrison.  I shall keep you, Bennet.  I must have a good man to rest me on in this day of black arrows.  'The arrow that flieth by day,' saith the evangel; I have no mind of the context; nay, I am a sluggard priest, I am too deep in men's affairs.  Well, let us ride forth, Master Hatch.  The jackmen should be at the church by now.\"  So they rode forward down the road, with the wind after them, blowing the tails of the parson's cloak; and behind them, as they went, clouds began to arise and blot out the sinking sun.  They had passed three of the scattered houses that make up Tunstall hamlet, when, coming to a turn, they saw the church before them.  Ten or a dozen houses clustered immediately round it; but to the back the churchyard was next the meadows.  At the lych-gate, near a score of men were gathered, some in the saddle, some standing by their horses' heads.  They were variously armed and mounted; some with spears, some with bills, some with bows, and some bestriding plough-horses, still splashed with the mire of the furrow; for these were the very dregs of the country, and all the better men and the fair equipments were already with Sir Daniel in the field.  \"We have not done amiss, praised be the cross of Holywood!  Sir Daniel will be right well content,\" observed the priest, inwardly numbering the troop.  \"Who goes?  Stand! if ye be true!\" shouted Bennet.  A man was seen slipping through the churchyard among the yews; and at the sound of this summons he discarded all concealment, and fairly took to his heels for the forest.  The men at the gate, who had been hitherto unaware of the stranger's presence, woke and scattered.  Those who had dismounted began scrambling into the saddle; the rest rode in pursuit; but they had to make the circuit of the consecrated ground, and it was plain their quarry would escape them.  Hatch, roaring an oath, put his horse at the hedge, to head him off; but the beast refused, and sent his rider sprawling in the dust.  And though he was up again in a moment, and had caught the bridle, the time had gone by, and the fugitive had gained too great a lead for any hope of capture.  The wisest of all had been Dick Shelton.  Instead of starting in a vain pursuit, he had whipped his crossbow from his back, bent it, and set a quarrel to the string; and now, when the others had desisted, he turned to Bennet and asked if he should shoot.  \"Shoot! shoot!\" cried the priest, with sanguinary violence.  \"Cover him, Master Dick,\" said Bennet.  \"Bring me him down like a ripe apple.\"  The fugitive was now within but a few leaps of safety; but this last part of the meadow ran very steeply uphill; and the man ran slower in proportion.  What with the greyness of the falling night, and the uneven movements of the runner, it was no easy aim; and as Dick levelled his bow, he felt a kind of pity, and a half desire that he might miss.  The quarrel sped.  The man stumbled and fell, and a great cheer arose from Hatch and the pursuers.  But they were counting their corn before the harvest.  The man fell lightly; he was lightly afoot again, turned and waved his cap in a bravado, and was out of sight next moment in the margin of the wood.  \"And the plague go with him!\" cried Bennet.  \"He has thieves' heels; he can run, by St Banbury!  But you touched him, Master Shelton; he has stolen your quarrel, may he never have good I grudge him less!\"  \"Nay, but what made he by the church?\" asked Sir Oliver.  \"I am shrewdly afeared there has been mischief here.  Clipsby, good fellow, get ye down from your horse, and search thoroughly among the yews.\"  Clipsby was gone but a little while ere he returned carrying a paper.  \"This writing was pinned to the church door,\" he said, handing it to the parson.  \"I found naught else, sir parson.\"  \"Now, by the power of Mother Church,\" cried Sir Oliver, \"but this runs hard on sacrilege!  For the king's good pleasure, or the lord of the manor--well!  But that every run-the-hedge in a green jerkin should fasten papers to the chancel door--nay, it runs hard on sacrilege, hard; and men have burned for matters of less weight.  But what have we here? The light falls apace.  Good Master Richard, y' have young eyes.  Read me, I pray, this libel.\"  Dick Shelton took the paper in his hand and read it aloud.  It contained some lines of very rugged doggerel, hardly even rhyming, written in a gross character, and most uncouthly spelt.  With the spelling somewhat bettered, this is how they ran:      \"I had four blak arrows under my belt,     Four for the greefs that I have felt,     Four for the nomber of ill menne     That have opressid me now and then.      One is gone; one is wele sped;     Old Apulyaird is ded.      One is for Maister Bennet Hatch,     That burned Grimstone, walls and thatch.      One for Sir Oliver Oates,     That cut Sir Harry Shelton's throat.      Sir Daniel, ye shull have the fourt;     We shall think it fair sport.      Ye shull each have your own part,     A blak arrow in each blak heart.     Get ye to your knees for to pray:     Ye are ded theeves, by yea and nay!                                                              \"JON AMEND-ALL                                                         of the Green Wood,                                                 And his jolly fellaweship.      \"Item, we have mo arrowes and goode hempen cord for otheres of your     following.\"  \"Now, well-a-day for charity and the Christian graces!\" cried Sir Oliver, lamentably.  \"Sirs, this is an ill world, and groweth daily worse.  I will swear upon the cross of Holywood I am as innocent of that good knight's hurt, whether in act or purpose, as the babe unchristened. Neither was his throat cut; for therein they are again in error, as there still live credible witnesses to show.\"  \"It boots not, sir parson,\" said Bennet.  \"Here is unseasonable talk.\"  \"Nay, Master Bennet, not so.  Keep ye in your due place, good Bennet,\" answered the priest.  \"I shall make mine innocence appear.  I will, upon no consideration, lose my poor life in error.  I take all men to witness that I am clear of this matter.  I was not even in the Moat House.  I was sent of an errand before nine upon the clock\"--  \"Sir Oliver,\" said Hatch, interrupting, \"since it please you not to stop this sermon, I will take other means.  Goffe, sound to horse.\"  And while the tucket was sounding, Bennet moved close to the bewildered parson, and whispered violently in his ear.  Dick Shelton saw the priest's eye turned upon him for an instant in a startled glance.  He had some cause for thought; for this Sir Harry Shelton was his own natural father.  But he said never a word, and kept his countenance unmoved.  Hatch and Sir Oliver discussed together for a while their altered situation; ten men, it was decided between them, should be reserved, not only to garrison the Moat House, but to escort the priest across the wood.  In the meantime, as Bennet was to remain behind, the command of the reinforcement was given to Master Shelton.  Indeed, there was no choice; the men were loutish fellows, dull and unskilled in war, while Dick was not only popular, but resolute and grave beyond his age. Although his youth had been spent in these rough, country places, the lad had been well taught in letters by Sir Oliver, and Hatch himself had shown him the management of arms and the first principles of command. Bennet had always been kind and helpful; he was one of those who are cruel as the grave to those they call their enemies, but ruggedly faithful and well willing to their friends; and now, while Sir Oliver entered the next house to write, in his swift, exquisite penmanship, a memorandum of the last occurrences to his master, Sir Daniel Brackley, Bennet came up to his pupil to wish him God-speed upon his enterprise.  \"Ye must go the long way about, Master Shelton,\" he said; \"round by the bridge, for your life!  Keep a sure man fifty paces afore you, to draw shots; and go softly till y' are past the wood.  If the rogues fall upon you, ride for 't; ye will do naught by standing.  And keep ever forward, Master Shelton; turn me not back again, an ye love your life; there is no help in Tunstall, mind ye that.  And now, since ye go to the great wars about the king, and I continue to dwell here in extreme jeopardy of my life, and the saints alone can certify if we shall meet again below, I give you my last counsels now at your riding.  Keep an eye on Sir Daniel; he is unsure.  Put not your trust in the jack-priest; he intendeth not amiss, but doth the will of others; it is a hand-gun for Sir Daniel!  Get your good lordship where ye go; make you strong friends; look to it.  And think ever a pater-noster-while on Bennet Hatch.  There are worse rogues afoot than Bennet.  So, God-speed!\"  \"And Heaven be with you, Bennet!\" returned Dick.  \"Ye were a good friend to me-ward, and so I shall say ever.\"  \"And, look ye, master,\" added Hatch, with a certain embarrassment, \"if this Amend-All should get a shaft into me, ye might, mayhap, lay out a gold mark or mayhap a pound for my poor soul; for it is like to go stiff with me in purgatory.\"  \"Ye shall have your will of it, Bennet,\" answered Dick.  \"But, what cheer, man! we shall meet again, where ye shall have more need of ale than masses.\"  \"The saints so grant it, Master Dick!\" returned the other.  \"But here comes Sir Oliver.
