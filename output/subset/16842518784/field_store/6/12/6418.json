To me the wits were disastrously kind. Never had I been made a tenth so much of; I was even urged to sing \"All quiet along the Potomac to-night,\" and was courteously praised when I had done so. But there is where affliction overtook me; they debated its authorship. One said a certain newspaper correspondent, naming him, had proved it to be the work--I forget of whom. But I shall never forget what followed. Two or three challenged the literary preeminence of that correspondent, and from as many directions I was asked for my opinion. Ah me! Lying back against a pile of saddles with my head in my hands, sodden with self-assurance, I replied, magnanimously, \"Oh, I don't set up for a critic, but--well--would you call him a better man than Charlie Toliver?\"  \"Who--o?\" It was not one who asked; the whos came like shrapnel; and when, not knowing what else to do, I smiled as one dying, there went up a wail of mirth that froze my blood and then heated it to a fever. The company howled. They rolled over one another, crying, \"Charlie Toliver!--Charlie Toliver!--Oh, Lord, where's Scott Gholson!--Charlie Toliver!\"--and leaped up and huddled down and moaned and rolled and rose and looked for me.  But, after all, fortune was merciful, and I was gone; the Major had summoned me--his brother had come. I went circuitously and alone. As I started, some fellow writhing on the grass cried, \"Charlie Tol--oh, this is better than a tcharade!\" and a flash of divination enlightened me. While I went I burned with shame, rage and nervous exhaustion; the name Scott Gholson had gasped in my ear was the name of her in the curtained wagon, and I cursed the day in which I had heard of Charlotte Oliver.    IV   THREE DAYS' RATIONS  In the vocabulary of a prig, but in the wrath of a fishwoman, I execrated Scott Gholson; his jealousies, his disclosures, his religion, his mispronunciations; and Ned Ferry--that cockerel! Here was I in the barrel, and able only to squeal in irate terror at whoever looked down upon me. I could have crawled under a log and died. At the door of the Major's tent I paused to learn and joy of one to whom comes reprieve when the rope is on his neck, I overheard Harry Helm, the General's nephew and aide de-camp, who had been with us, telling what a howling good joke Smith had just got off on Gholson!  \"We shall have to get Ned Ferry back here,\" the Major was saying as I entered, \"to make you boys let Scott Gholson alone.\"  The young man laughed and turned to go. \"Why doesn't Ned Ferry make _her_ let Gholson alone? He can do it; he's got her round his finger as tight as she's got Gholson round hers.\"  \"Harry,\" replied the Major, from his table full of documents, \"don't you know that any man who's got a woman wrapped round his finger has also got her wrapped round his throat?\"  The aide-de-camp laughed like a rustic and vanished. \"Smith,\" said the Major, \"your eyes are--\"  \"I've been awake for forty-eight hours, Major. But--oh, I'm not sleepy.\"  \"Well, go get some sleep.--No, go at once; you'll be called when needed.\"  But I was not needed; while I slept, who should come back and do my work in my stead but Ned Ferry. When I awoke it was with a bound of alarm to see clear day. The command was breaking camp. I rushed out of the tent with canteen, soap and comb, and ran into the arms of the mess-cook. We were alone. \"Oh, yass, seh,\" he laughed as he poured the water into my hands, \"th'ee days' rairtion. Seh? Lawd! dey done drawed and cook' befo' de fus' streak o' light. But you all right; here yo' habbersack, full up. Oh, I done fed yo' hoss. Here yo' jacket an' cap; and here yo' saddle an' bridle--Oh, you welcome; I dess tryin' to git shet of 'em so's I kin strak de tent.\"  As I mounted, our wagonmaster rode by me, busy as a skipper in a storm. \"Oh, here!\" he cried, wheeled, and reaching something to me added, \"that's your pass. Major Harper wants you as quick as you can show up. He says never mind the column, ride straight after him. Keep this road to Hazlehurst and then go down the main Brookhaven road till you overtake him. He's by himself--nearly.\"  As the rider wheeled away I blurted out with anxious loudness in the general hubbub, \"Isn't his brother with him?\"  He flashed back a glare of rebuke and then bellowed to heaven and earth, \"Oh, the devil and Tom Walker! I don't keep run of sutlers and citizens!\" He took a circuit, standing in his stirrups and calling orders to his teamsters, and as he neared me again he said very gently, \"Good Lord! my boy, don't you know better than to shoot your mouth off like that? You'll find nobody with the Major but Ned Ferry, and I don't say you'll find him.\"  I galloped to the road. Away down through the woods it was full of horsemen falling into line. With the nearest colonel was Lieutenant Helm, the aide-de-camp. I turned away from them toward Hazlehurst, but looked back distrustfully. Yes, sure enough, the whole command was facing into column the other way! My horse and I whirled and stood staring and swelling with indignation--we ordered south, and the brigade heading westward! He fretted, tramped, neighed, and began hurriedly to paw through the globe to head them off on the other side. He even threatened to rear; but when I showed him I was ashamed of that, he bore me proudly, and I sat him as proudly as he bore me, for he made me more than half my friends. And now as the aide-de-camp wheeled about from the receding column and came our way saluting cordially, we turned and trotted beside him jauntily. Our first talk was of saddles, but very soon I asked where the General was.  \"Out on the Natchez Trace waiting for the command. I'm carrying orders to Fisher's battery, down here by the cross-roads. Haven't you seen the General this morning? What! haven't seen him in his new uniform? Whoop! he's a blaze of glory! Look here, Smith, I believe you know who brought it to him!\"  \"How on earth should I know?\"  \"Oh, how innocent you always are! Look here! just tell me this; was it the Major's brother brought it, or was it Ned Ferry?\"  \"Suppose it wasn't either.\"  \"I knew it! I knew it was her! Ah, you rogue, you know it was her!\"  \"Well, that _might_ depend on who 'her' is.\" We had reached the cross-roads and he was turning south.  \"Look!\" he said, and gave the glance and smile of the lady in the curtained wagon so perfectly that I cackled like a small boy. \"Oh, you know that, do you? I dare you to say she didn't bring it!\"  \"I give you my word I don't know!\" called I as the distance grew between us. \"And I give you my word I don't care!\" he crowed back as we galloped apart. His speech was two or three words longer, but they are inappropriate at the end of a chapter, and I expurgate.    V   EIGHTEEN, NINETEEN, TWENTY  On entering Hazlehurst I observed all about the railway-station a surprising amount of quartermaster's stores. A large part were cases of boots and shoes. Laden with such goods, a train of shabby box-cars stood facing south, its beggarly wood-burner engine sniffing and weeping, while the cork-legged conductor helped all hands wood up. Though homely, the picture was a stirring one. Up through the blue summer morning came the sun, bringing to mind the words of the dying Mirabeau, \"If that is not God, at least it's his first cousin.\"  Even in the character of the goods there was eloquence, and not a drollery in the scene, not even an ugliness, but was touched, was rife, with the woe of a war whose burning walls were falling in on us. And outward, too, upon others; a few up-ended cottonbales leaned against each other ragged and idle, while women and babes starved for want of them in far-away Lancaster.  One of the cars furthest from the engine had no freight proper, only a number of trunks; and these were nearly hidden by the widely crinolined flounces of an elegant elderly lady who sat on the middle one. And now she, too, was hidden, and the wide doorway in the side of the car more than filled, by the fashionable gowns of three girls. On the ground below there stood a lieutenant in a homemade gray uniform, and at his back half a dozen big, slouching, barefoot boys squirted tobacco juice and gazed at the ladies. The officer scanned me, spoke to the ladies, scanned me again, and threw up an arm. \"Ho--o! Come here! Hullo! Come here--if you please.\"  If he had not said please he should have ho'd and hullo'd in vain, but at that word I turned. Before I had covered half the distance I read New Orleans! my dear, dear old New Orleans! in every line of those ladies' draperies, and at twenty-five yards I saw one noble family likeness in all four of their sweet faces. Oh, but those three maidens were fair! and I could name each by her name at a glance: Camille, CÃ©cile, Estelle; eighteen, nineteen, twenty!  There was a hush of attention among them as the lieutenant and I saluted. His left hand was gone at the wrist and the sleeve pinned back on itself. He asked my name; I told him. In the car there was a stir of deepening interest. I inquired if he was the post-quartermaster here. He was.  \"Ain't you Major Harper's quartermaster-sergeant?\" he asked.  \"I am his clerk.\" In the car a flash of joy and then great decorum.  As he handed me a writing he glowed kindly. It proved to be from Major Harper; a requisition upon this officer for shoes and clothing; not for a brigade, regiment or company, but for me alone, from hat to shoes. I tendered it back silently, and saw that he knew its purport already from the Major, and that the ladies knew it from him. The good fellow looked quite happy a moment, but then reddened as they joyfully crowded the car's doorway to see me fitted!  \"We can select out sev'l pair--\" he began, but heard a puerile titter and lost his nerve. \"Now, you boys that ain't got any business here, jest clair out!--Go! I tell you, aw I'll--\" The boys loitered off toward the engine. \"We can select out sev'"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9841"],["title","Selections from the Table Talk of Martin Luther (#1)"],["body","his grandfather dwelt at that time when the said Edict was published in Germany for the burning of the aforesaid books; and digging deep into the ground, under the said old foundation, one of the said original books was there happily found, lying in a deep obscure hole, being wrapped in a strong linen cloth, which was waxed all over with beeswax, within and without; whereby the book was preserved fair, without any blemish.  âAnd at the same time Ferdinandus II. being Emperor in Germany, who was a severe enemy and persecutor of the Protestant religion, the aforesaid gentleman and grandchild to him that had hidden the said books in that obscure hole, fearing that if the said Emperor should get knowledge that one of the said books was yet forthcoming, and in his custody, whereby not only himself might be brought into trouble, but also the book in danger to be destroyed, as all the rest were so long before; and also calling me to mind, and knowing that I had the High Dutch Tongue very perfect, did send the said original book over hither into England unto me; and therewith did write unto me a letter, wherein he related the passages of the preserving and finding out the said book.  âAnd also he earnestly moved me in his letter, that for the advancement of Godâs glory, and of Christâs Church, I would take the pains to translate the said book, to the end that that most excellent divine work of Luther might be brought again to light.  âWhereupon I took the said book before me, and many times began to translate the same, but always I was hindered therein, being called upon about other business, insomuch that by no possible means I could remain by that work.  Then, about six weeks after I had received the said book, it fell out that I being in bed with my wife one night, between twelve and one of the clock, she being asleep, but myself yet awake, there appeared unto me an ancient man, standing at my bedside, arrayed all in white, having a long and broad white beard hanging down to his girdle-stead, who, taking me by my right ear, spake these words following unto me:ââSirrah! will not you take time to translate that book which is sent unto you out of Germany?  I will shortly provide for you both place and time to do it;â and then he vanished away out of my sight.  âWhereupon, being much thereby affrighted, I fell into an extreme sweat, insomuch that my wife awaking, and finding me all over wet, she asked me what I ailed.  I told her what I had seen and heard; but I never did heed nor regard visions nor dreams; and so the same fell soon out of my mind.  âThen about a fortnight after I had seen that vision, on a Sunday, I went to Whitehall to hear the sermon, after which ended I returned to my lodging, which was then in King Street, at Westminster, and sitting down to dinner with my wife, two Messengers were sent from the whole Council-board, with a warrant to carry me to the keeper of the Gatehouse, Westminster, there to be safely kept until further order from the Lords of the Council, which was done without showing me any cause {17} at all wherefore I was committed.  Upon which said warrant I was kept there ten whole years close prisoner, where I spent five years thereof about the translating of the said book; insomuch as I found the words very true which the old man, in the aforesaid vision, did say unto me: âI will shortly provide for you both place and time to translate it.â  âThen, after I had finished the said translation in the prison, the late Archbishop of Canterbury, Dr. Laud, understanding that I had translated such a book, called _Martin Lutherâs Divine Discourses_, sent unto me his chaplain, Dr. Bray, into the prison, with this Message following:â      ââCaptain BELL,         ââMy Lord Grace of Canterbury hath sent me unto you, to tell you     that his Grace hath understood that you have translated a book of     Lutherâs, touching which book his Grace, many years before, did hear     of the burning of so many thousands in Germany by the then Emperor.     His Grace therefore doth desire you, that you would send unto him the     said original book in Dutch, and also your translation; which, after     his Grace hath perused, shall be returned safely unto you.â  âWhereupon I told Dr. Bray that I had taken a great deal of pains in translating the said book, and was very loth to part with it out of my hands, and therefore I desired him to excuse me to his Grace, that I could not part from it; with which answer he at that time returned again to his master.  âBut the next day after he sent him unto me again, and bade him tell me that, upon his honour, the book should be as safe in his custody, if not safer than in mine own; for he would lock it up in his own cabinet, to the end no man might come unto it, but only himself.  Thereupon I, knowing it would be a thing bootless for me to refuse the sending of them, by reason he was then of such great power that he would have them, _nolens volens_, I sent them both unto him.  Then, after he had kept them in his custody two months, and had daily read therein, he sent the said Doctor unto me, to tell me that I had performed a work worthy of eternal memory, and that he had never read a more excellent divine work; yet saying that some things therein were fitting to be left out; and desired me not to think long that he did not return them unto me so soon again. The reason was because that the more he did read therein, the more desire he had to go on therewith; and so, presenting me with ten livres in gold, he returned back again.  âAfter which, when he had them in his custody one whole year, and that I understood he had perused it all over, then I sent unto his Grace, and humbly desired that his Grace would be pleased to return me my books again.  Whereupon he sent me word by the said Dr. Bray, that he had not as yet perused them so thoroughly over as he desired to do; then I stayed yet a year longer before I sent to him again.  âIn which time I heard for certain that it was concluded by the King and Council that a Parliament should forthwith be called; at which news I did much rejoice.  And then I sent unto his Grace an humble petition, and therein desired the returning of my book again; otherwise I told him I should be enforced to make it known, and to complain of him to the Parliament, which was then coming on.  Whereupon he sent unto me again safely both the said original book and my translation, and caused his Chaplain, the said Doctor, to tell me that he would make it known unto his Majesty what an excellent piece of work I had translated, and that he would procure an order from his Majesty to have the said translation printed, and to be dispersed throughout the whole kingdom, as it was in Germany, and as he had heard thereof; and thereupon he presented me again with forty livres in gold.  âAnd presently after I was set at liberty by warrant from the whole House of Lords, according to his Majestyâs direction in that behalf; but shortly afterwards the Archbishop fell into his troubles, and was by the Parliament sent unto the Tower, and afterwards beheaded; insomuch that I could never since hear anything touching the printing of my book.  âThe House of Commons having then notice that I had translated the aforesaid book, they sent for me, and did appoint a Committee to see it and the translation, and diligently to make inquiry whether the translation did agree with the original or no; whereupon they desired me to bring the same before them, sitting then in the Treasury Chamber.  And Sir Edward Dering, being Chairman, said unto me that he was acquainted with a learned minister beneficed in Essex, who had lived long in England, but was born in High Germany, in the Palatinate, named Mr. Paul Amiraut, whom the Committee sending for, desired him to take both the original and my translation into his custody, and diligently to compare them together, and to make report unto the said Committee whether he found that I had rightly and truly translated it according to the original: which report he made accordingly, and they, being satisfied therein, referred it to two of the Assembly, Mr. Charles Herle and Mr. Edward Corbet, desiring them diligently to peruse the same, and to make report unto them if they thought it fitting to be printed and published.  âWhereupon they made report, dated the 10th of November, 1646, that they found it to be an excellent Divine Work, worthy the light and publishing, especially in regard that Luther, in the said Discourses, did revoke his opinion, which he formerly held, touching Consubstantiation in the Sacrament.  Whereupon the House of Commons, the 24th of February, 1646, did give order for the printing thereof.  âThus, having been lately desired to set down in writing the relation of the passages above-said concerning the said book, as well for the satisfaction of judicious and godly Christians, as for the conservation of the perpetual memory of Godâs extraordinary providence in the miraculous preservation of the aforesaid Divine Discourses, and now bringing them again to light: I have done the same according to the plain truth thereof, not doubting but they will prove a notable advantage of Godâs glory, and the good and edification of the whole Church, and an unspeakable consolation of every particular member of the same.               âGiven under my hand the 3rd day of July, 1650.                                                               âHENRY BELL.â     A COPY OF THE ORDER FROM THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.                                                   _24th_ _February_, _1646_.
