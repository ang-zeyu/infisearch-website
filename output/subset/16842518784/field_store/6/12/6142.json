And I heard him telling infamously to himself the tale of his horrible spoils. \"A hundred and fifteen galleons of old Spain, a certain argosy that went from Tyre, eight fisher-fleets and ninety ships of the line, twelve warships under sail, with their carronades, three hundred and eighty-seven river-craft, forty-two merchantmen that carried spice, four quinquiremes, ten triremes, thirty yachts, twenty-one battleships of the modern time, nine thousand admirals....\" he mumbled and chuckled on, till I suddenly arose and fled from his fearful contamination.     THE RAFT-BUILDERS   All we who write put me in mind of sailors hastily making rafts upon doomed ships.  When we break up under the heavy years and go down into eternity with all that is ours our thoughts like small lost rafts float on awhile upon Oblivion's sea. They will not carry much over those tides, our names and a phrase or two and little else.  They that write as a trade to please the whim of the day, they are like sailors that work at the rafts only to warm their hands and to distract their thoughts from their certain doom; their rafts go all to pieces before the ship breaks up.  See now Oblivion shimmering all around us, its very tranquility deadlier than tempest. How little all our keels have troubled it. Time in its deeps swims like a monstrous whale; and, like a whale, feeds on the littlest things--small tunes and little unskilled songs of the olden, golden evenings--and anon turneth whale-like to overthrow whole ships.  See now the wreckage of Babylon floating idly, and something there that once was Nineveh; already their kings and queens are in the deeps among the weedy masses of old centuries that hide the sodden bulk of sunken Tyre and make a darkness round Persepolis.  For the rest I dimly see the forms of foundered ships on the sea-floor strewn with crowns.  Our ships were all unseaworthy from the first.  There goes the raft that Homer made for Helen.     THE WORKMAN   I saw a workman fall with his scaffolding right from the summit of some vast hotel. And as he came down I saw him holding a knife and trying to cut his name on the scaffolding. He had time to try and do this for he must have had nearly three hundred feet to fall. And I could think of nothing but his folly in doing this futile thing, for not only would the man be unrecognizably dead in three seconds, but the very pole on which he tried to scratch whatever of his name he had time for was certain to be burnt in a few weeks for firewood.  Then I went home for I had work to do. And all that evening I thought of the man's folly, till the thought hindered me from serious work.  And late that night while I was still at work, the ghost of the workman floated through my wall and stood before me laughing.  I heard no sound until after I spoke to it; but I could see the grey diaphanous form standing before me shuddering with laughter.  I spoke at last and asked what it was laughing at, and then the ghost spoke. It said: \"I'm a laughin' at you sittin' and workin' there.\"  \"And why,\" I asked, \"do you laugh at serious work?\"  \"Why, yer bloomin' life 'ull go by like a wind,\" he said, \"and yer 'ole silly civilization 'ull be tidied up in a few centuries.\"  Then he fell to laughing again and this time audibly; and, laughing still, faded back through the wall again and into the eternity from which he had come.     THE GUEST   A young man came into an ornate restaurant at eight o'clock in London.  He was alone, but two places had been laid at the table which was reserved for him. He had chosen the dinner very carefully, by letter a week before.  A waiter asked him about the other guest.  \"You probably won't see him till the coffee comes,\" the young man told him; so he was served alone.  Those at adjacent tables might have noticed the young man continually addressing the empty chair and carrying on a monologue with it throughout his elaborate dinner.  \"I think you knew my father,\" he said to it over the soup.  \"I sent for you this evening,\" he continued, \"because I want you to do me a good turn; in fact I must insist on it.\"  There was nothing eccentric about the man except for this habit of addressing an empty chair, certainly he was eating as good a dinner as any sane man could wish for.  After the Burgundy had been served he became more voluble in his monologue, not that he spoiled his wine by drinking excessively.  \"We have several acquaintances in common,\" he said. \"I met King Seti a year ago in Thebes. I think he has altered very little since you knew him. I thought his forehead a little low for a king's. Cheops has left the house that he built for your reception, he must have prepared for you for years and years. I suppose you have seldom been entertained like that. I ordered this dinner over a week ago. I thought then that a lady might have come with me, but as she wouldn't I've asked you. She may not after all be as lovely as Helen of Troy. Was Helen very lovely? Not when you knew her, perhaps. You were lucky in Cleopatra, you must have known her when she was in her prime.  \"You never knew the mermaids nor the fairies nor the lovely goddesses of long ago, that's where we have the best of you.\"  He was silent when the waiters came to his table, but rambled merrily on as soon as they left, still turned to the empty chair.  \"You know I saw you here in London only the other day. You were on a motor bus going down Ludgate Hill. It was going much too fast. London is a good place. But I shall be glad enough to leave it. It was in London that I met the lady I that was speaking about. If it hadn't been for London I probably shouldn't have met her, and if it hadn't been for London she probably wouldn't have had so much besides me to amuse her. It cuts both ways.\"  He paused once to order coffee, gazing earnestly at the waiter and putting a sovereign in his hand. \"Don't let it be chicory,\" said he.  The waiter brought the coffee, and the young man dropped a tabloid of some sort into his cup.  \"I don't suppose you come here very often,\" he went on. \"Well, you probably want to be going. I haven't taken you much out of your way, there is plenty for you to do in London.\"  Then having drunk his coffee he fell on to the floor by a foot of the empty chair, and a doctor who was dining in the room bent over him and announced to the anxious manager the visible presence of the young man's guest.     DEATH AND ODYSSEUS   In the Olympian courts Love laughed at Death, because he was unsightly, and because She couldn't help it, and because he never did anything worth doing, and because She would.  And Death hated being laughed at, and used to brood apart thinking only of his wrongs and of what he could do to end this intolerable treatment.  But one day Death appeared in the courts with an air and They all noticed it. \"What are you up to now?\" said Love. And Death with some solemnity said to Her: \"I am going to frighten Odysseus\"; and drawing about him his grey traveller's cloak went out through the windy door with his jowl turned earthwards.  And he came soon to Ithaca and the hall that Athene knew, and opened the door and saw there famous Odysseus, with his white locks bending close over the fire, trying to warm his hands.  And the wind through the open door blew bitterly on Odysseus.  And Death came up behind him, and suddenly shouted.  And Odysseus went on warming his pale hands.  Then Death came close and began to mouth at him. And after a while Odysseus turned and spoke. And \"Well, old servant,\" he said, \"have your masters been kind to you since I made you work for me round Ilion?\"  And Death for some while stood mute, for he thought of the laughter of Love.  Then \"Come now,\" said Odysseus, \"lend me your shoulder,\" and he leaning heavily on that bony joint, they went together through the open door.     DEATH AND THE ORANGE   Two dark young men in a foreign southern land sat at a restaurant table with one woman.  And on the woman's plate was a small orange which had an evil laughter in its heart.  And both of the men would be looking at the woman all the time, and they ate little and they drank much.  And the woman was smiling equally at each.  Then the small orange that had the laughter in its heart rolled slowly off the plate on to the floor. And the dark young men both sought for it at once, and they met suddenly beneath the table, and soon they were speaking swift words to one another, and a horror and an impotence came over the Reason of each as she sat helpless at the back of the mind, and the heart of the orange laughed and the woman went on smiling; and Death, who was sitting at another table, tête-à-tête with an old man, rose and came over to listen to the quarrel.     THE PRAYER OF THE FLOWERS   It was the voice of the flowers on the West wind, the lovable, the old, the lazy West wind, blowing ceaselessly, blowing sleepily, going Greecewards.  \"The woods have gone away, they have fallen and left us; men love us no longer, we are lonely by moonlight. Great engines rush over the beautiful fields, their ways lie hard and terrible up and down the land.  \"The cancrous cities spread over the grass, they clatter in their lairs continually, they glitter about us blemishing the night.  \"The woods are gone, O Pan, the woods, the woods. And thou art far, O Pan, and far away.\"  I was standing by night between two railway embankments on the edge of a Midland city. On one of them I saw the trains go by, once in every two minutes, and on the other, the trains went by twice in every five.  Quite close were the glaring factories, and the sky above them wore the fearful look that it wears in dreams of fever.  The flowers were right in the stride of that advancing city, and thence I heard them sending up their cry. And then I heard, beating musically up wind, the voice of "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7838"],["title","Fifty-One Tales (#2)"],["body","reproving them from Arcady--  \"Be patient a little, these things are not for long.\"     TIME AND THE TRADESMAN   Once Time as he prowled the world, his hair grey not with weakness but with dust of the ruin of cities, came to a furniture shop and entered the Antique department. And there he saw a man darkening the wood of a chair with dye and beating it with chains and making imitation wormholes in it.  And when Time saw another doing his work he stood by him awhile and looked on critically.  And at last he said: \"That is not how I work,\" and he turned the man's hair white and bent his back and put some furrows in his little cunning face; then turned and strode away, for a mighty city that was weary and sick and too long had troubled the fields was sore in need of him.     THE LITTLE CITY   I was in the pre-destined 11.8 from Goraghwood to Drogheda, when I suddenly saw the city. It was a little city in a valley, and only seemed to have a little smoke, and the sun caught the smoke and turned it golden, so that it looked like an old Italian picture where angels walk in the foreground and the rest is a blaze of gold. And beyond, as one could tell by the lie of land although one could not see through the golden smoke, I knew that there lay the paths of the roving ships.  All round there lay a patchwork of small fields all over the slopes of the hills, and the snow had come upon them tentatively, but already the birds of the waste had moved to the sheltered places for every omen boded more to fall. Far away some little hills blazed like an aureate bulwark broken off by age and fallen from the earthward rampart of Paradise. And aloof and dark the mountains stared unconcernedly seawards.  And when I saw those grey and watchful mountains sitting where they sat while the cities of the civilization of Araby and Asia arose like crocuses, and like crocuses fell, I wondered for how long there would be smoke in the valley and little fields on the hills.     THE UNPASTURABLE FIELDS   Thus spake the mountains: \"Behold us, even us; the old ones, the grey ones, that wear the feet of Time. Time on our rocks shall break his staff and stumble: and still we shall sit majestic, even as now, hearing the sound of the sea, our old coeval sister, who nurses the bones of her children and weeps for the things she has done.  \"Far, far, we stand above all things; befriending the little cities until they grow old and leave us to go among the myths.  \"We are the most imperishable mountains.\"  And softly the clouds foregathered from far places, and crag on crag and mountain upon mountain in the likeness of Caucasus upon Himalaya came riding past the sunlight upon the backs of storms and looked down idly from their golden heights upon the crests of the mountains.  \"Ye pass away,\" said the mountains.  And the clouds answered, as I dreamed or fancied,  \"We pass away, indeed we pass away, but upon our unpasturable fields Pegasus prances. Here Pegasus gallops and browses upon song which the larks bring to him every morning from far terrestrial fields. His hoof-beats ring upon our slopes at sunrise as though our fields were of silver. And breathing the dawn-wind in dilated nostrils, with head tossed upwards and with quivering wings, he stands and stares from our tremendous heights, and snorts and sees far-future wonderful wars rage in the creases and the folds of the togas that cover the knees of the gods.\"     THE WORM AND THE ANGEL   As he crawled from the tombs of the fallen a worm met with an angel.  And together they looked upon the kings and kingdoms, and youths and maidens and the cities of men. They saw the old men heavy in their chairs and heard the children singing in the fields. They saw far wars and warriors and walled towns, wisdom and wickedness, and the pomp of kings, and the people of all the lands that the sunlight knew.  And the worm spake to the angel saying: \"Behold my food.\"  \"Be dakeon para Thina poluphloisboio Thalassaes,\" murmured the angel, for they walked by the sea, \"and can you destroy that too?\"  And the worm paled in his anger to a greyness ill to behold, for for three thousand years he had tried to destroy that line and still its melody was ringing in his head.     THE SONGLESS COUNTRY   The poet came unto a great country in which there were no songs. And he lamented gently for the nation that had not any little foolish songs to sing to itself at evening.  And at last he said: \"I will make for them myself some little foolish songs so that they may be merry in the lanes and happy by the fireside.\" And for some days he made for them aimless songs such as maidens sing on the hills in the older happier countries.  Then he went to some of that nation as they sat weary with the work of the day and said to them: \"I have made you some aimless songs out of the small unreasonable legends, that are somewhat akin to the wind in the vales of my childhood; and you may care to sing them in your disconsolate evenings.\"  And they said to him:  \"If you think we have time for that sort of nonsense nowadays you cannot know much of the progress of modern commerce.\"  And then the poet wept for he said: \"Alas! They are damned.\"     THE LATEST THING   I saw an unclean-feeder by the banks of the river of Time. He crouched by orchards numerous with apples in a happy land of flowers; colossal barns stood near which the ancients had stored with grain, and the sun was golden on serene far hills behind the level lands. But his back was to all these things. He crouched and watched the river. And whatever the river chanced to send him down the unclean-feeder clutched at greedily with his arms, wading out into the water.  Now there were in those days, and indeed still are, certain uncleanly cities upon the river of Time; and from them fearfully nameless things came floating shapelessly by. And whenever the odor of these came down the river before them the unclean-feeder plunged into the dirty water and stood far out, expectant. And if he opened his mouth one saw these things on his lips.  Indeed from the upper reaches there came down sometimes the fallen rhododendron's petal, sometimes a rose; but they were useless to the unclean-feeder, and when he saw them he growled.  A poet walked beside the river's bank; his head was lifted and his look was afar; I think he saw the sea, and the hills of Fate from which the river ran. I saw the unclean-feeder standing voracious, up to his waist in that evil-smelling river.  \"Look,\" I said to the poet.  \"The current will sweep him away,\" the poet said.  \"But those cities that poison the river,\" I said to him.  He answered: \"Whenever the centuries melt on the hills of Fate the river terribly floods.\"     THE DEMAGOGUE AND THE DEMI-MONDE   A demagogue and a demi-mondaine chanced to arrive together at the gate of Paradise. And the Saint looked sorrowfully at them both.  \"Why were you a demagogue?\" he said to the first.  \"Because,\" said the demagogue, \"I stood for those principles that have made us what we are and have endeared our Party to the great heart of the people. In a word I stood unflinchingly on the plank of popular representation.\"  \"And you?\" said the Saint to her of the demi-monde.  \"I wanted money,\" said the demi-mondaine.  And after some moments' thought the Saint said: \"Well, come in; though you don't deserve to.\"  But to the demagogue he said: \"We genuinely regret that the limited space at our disposal and our unfortunate lack of interest in those Questions that you have gone so far to inculate and have so ably upheld in the past, prevent us from giving you the support for which you seek.\"  And he shut the golden door.     THE GIANT POPPY   I dreamt that I went back to the hills I knew, whence on a clear day you can see the walls of Ilion and the plains of Roncesvalles. There used to be woods along the tops of those hills with clearings in them where the moonlight fell, and there when no one watched the fairies danced.  But there were no woods when I went back, no fairies nor distant glimpse of Ilion or plains of Roncesvalles, only one giant poppy waved in the wind, and as it waved it hummed \"Remember not.\" And by its oak-like stem a poet sat, dressed like a shepherd and playing an ancient tune softly upon a pipe. I asked him if the fairies had passed that way or anything olden.  He said: \"The poppy has grown apace and is killing gods and fairies. Its fumes are suffocating the world, and its roots drain it of its beautiful strength.\" And I asked him why he sat on the hills I knew, playing an olden tune.  And he answered: \"Because the tune is bad for the poppy, which would otherwise grow more swiftly; and because if the brotherhood of which I am one were to cease to pipe on the hills men would stray over the world and be lost or come to terrible ends. We think we have saved Agamemnon.\"  Then he fell to piping again that olden tune, while the wind among the poppy's sleepy petals murmured \"Remember not. Remember not.\"     ROSES   I know a roadside where the wild rose blooms with a strange abundance. There is a beauty in the blossoms too of an almost exotic kind, a taint of deeper pink that shocks the Puritan flowers. Two hundred generations ago (generations, I mean, of roses) this was a village street; there was a floral decadence when they left their simple life and the roses came from the wilderness to clamber round houses of men.  Of all the memories of that little village, of all the cottages that stood there, of all the men and women whose homes they were, nothing remains but a more beautiful blush on the faces of the roses.  I hope that when London is clean passed away and the defeated fields come back again, like an exiled people returning after a war, they may find some beautiful thing to remind them of it all; because we have loved a little that swart old city.     THE MAN WITH THE GOLDEN EAR-RINGS   It may be that I dreamed this. So much at least is certain--that I turned one day from the"]]]
