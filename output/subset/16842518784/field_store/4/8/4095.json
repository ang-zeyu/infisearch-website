The fight was sure to come and there were seven to one against them in the room. If he could only gain time. Every minute was precious. It would take the boy fifteen minutes to run the two miles to camp. It would be half an hour before the rest of the Glengarry men could arrive, and much fighting may be done in that time. He must avert attention from Macdonald Dubh, who was waiting to cram LeNoir's insult down his throat. Yankee Jim had not only all the cool courage but also the shrewd, calculating spirit of his race. He was ready to fight, and if need be against odds, but he preferred to fight on as even terms as possible.  Soon LeNoir came back, wild with fury, and yelling curses at the top of his voice. He hurled himself into the room, the crowd falling back from him on either hand.  “Hola!” he yelled, “Sacre bleu!” He took two quick steps, and springing up into the air he kicked the stovepipe that ran along some seven feet above the floor.  “Purty good kicking,” called out Yankee, sliding down from his seat. “Used to kick some myself. Excuse ME.” He stood for a moment looking up at the stovepipe, then without apparent effort he sprang into the air, shot up his long legs, and knocked the stovepipe with a bang against the ceiling. There was a shout of admiration.  “My damages,” he said to Pat Murphy, who stood behind the counter. “Good thing there ain't no fire. Thought it was higher. Wouldn't care to kick for the drinks, would ye?” he added to LeNoir.  LeNoir was too furious to enter into any contest so peaceful, but as he specially prided himself on his high kick, he paused a moment and was about to agree when Black Hugh broke in, harshly, spoiling all Yankee's plans.  “There is no time for such foolishness,” he said, turning to Dan Murphy. “I want to know when we can get our timber out.”  “Depinds intoirly on yirsilf,” said Murphy.  “When will your logs be out of the way?”  “Indade an' that's a ha-r-r-d one,” laughed Murphy.  “And will you tell me what right hev you to close up the river?” Black Hugh's wrath was rising.  “You wud think now it wuz yirsilf that owned the river. An' bedad it's the thought of yir mind, it is. An' it's not the river only, but the whole creation ye an yir brother think is yours.” Dan Murphy was close up to Macdonald Dubh by this time. “Yis, blank, blank, yir faces, an' ye'd like to turn better than yirsilves from aff the river, so ye wud, ye black-hearted thaves that ye are.”  This, of course, was beyond all endurance. For answer Black Hugh smote him sudden and fierce on the mouth, and Murphy went down.  “Purty one,” sang out Yankee, cheerily. “Now, boys, back to the wall.”  Before Murphy could rise, LeNoir sprang over him and lit upon Macdonald like a cat, but Macdonald shook himself free and sprang back to the Glengarry line at the wall.  “Mac an' Diabboil,” he roared, “Glengarry forever!”  “Glengarry!” yelled the four Highlanders beside him, wild with the delight of battle. It was a plain necessity, and they went into it with free consciences and happy hearts.  “Let me at him,” cried Murphy, struggling past LeNoir towards Macdonald.  “Non! He is to me!” yelled LeNoir, dancing in front of Macdonald.  “Here, Murphy,” called out Yankee, obligingly, “help yourself this way.”  Murphy dashed at him, but Yankee's long arm shot out to meet him, and Murphy again found the floor.  “Come on, boys,” cried Pat Murphy, Dan's brother, and followed by half a dozen others, he flung himself at Yankee and the line of men standing up against the wall. But Yankee's arms flashed out once, twice, thrice, and Pat Murphy fell back over his brother; two others staggered across and checked the oncoming rush, while Dannie Ross and big Mack Cameron had each beaten back their man, and the Glengarry line stood unbroken. Man for man they were far more than a match for their opponents, and standing shoulder to shoulder, with their backs to the wall, they taunted Murphy and his gang with all the wealth of gibes and oaths at their command.  “Where's the rest of your outfit, Murphy?” drawled Yankee. “Don't seem's if you'd counted right.”  “It is a cold day for the parley voos,” laughed Big Mack Cameron. “Come up, lads, and take a taste of something hot.”  Then the Murphy men, clearing away the fallen, rushed again. They strove to bring the Highlanders to a clinch, but Yankee's voice was high and clear in command.  “Keep the line, boys! Don't let 'em draw you!” And the Glengarry men waited till they could strike, and when they struck men went down and were pulled back by their friends.  “Intil them, bhoys!” yelled Dan Murphy, keeping out of range himself. “Intil the divils!” And again and again his men crowded down upon the line against the wall, but again and again they were beaten down or hurled back bruised and bleeding.  Meantime LeNoir was devoting himself to Black Hugh at one end of the line, dancing in upon him and away again, but without much result. Black Hugh refused to be drawn out, and fought warily on defense, knowing the odds were great and waiting his chance to deliver one good blow, which was all he asked.  The Glengarry men were enjoying themselves hugely, and when not shouting their battle-cry, “Glengarry forever!” or taunting their foes, they were joking each other on the fortunes of war. Big Mack Cameron, who held the center, drew most of the sallies. He was easy-tempered and good-natured, and took his knocks with the utmost good humor.  “That was a good one, Mack,” said Dannie Ross, his special chum, as a sounding whack came in on Big Mack's face. “As true as death I will be telling it to Bella Peter. Bella, the daughter of Peter McGregor, was supposed to be dear to Big Mack's heart.  “What a peety she could not see him the now,” said Finlay Campbell. “Man alive, she would say the word queeck!”  “'Tis more than she will do to you whatever, if you cannot keep off that crapeau yonder a little better,” said Big Mack, reaching for a Frenchman who kept dodging in upon him with annoying persistence. Then Mack began to swear Gaelic oaths.  “'Tain't fair, Mack!” called out Yankee from his end of the line, “bad language in English is bad enough, but in Gaelic it must be uncommon rough.” So they gibed each other. But the tactics of the enemy were exceedingly irritating, and were beginning to tell upon the tempers of the Highlanders.  “Come to me, ye cowardly little devil,” roared Mack to his persisting assailant. “No one will hurt you! Come away, man! A-a-ah-ouch!” His cry of satisfaction at having grabbed his man ended in a howl of pain, for the Frenchman had got Mack's thumb between his teeth, and was chewing it vigorously.  “Ye would, would you, ye dog?” roared Big Mack. He closed his fingers into the Frenchman's gullet, and drew him up to strike, but on every side hands reached for him and stayed his blow. Then he lost himself. With a yell of rage he jambed his man back into the crowd, sinking his fingers deeper and deeper into his enemy's throat till his face grew black and his head fell over on one side. But it was a fatal move for Mack, and overcome by numbers that crowded upon him, he went down fighting wildly and bearing the Frenchman beneath him. The Glengarry line was broken. Black Hugh saw Mack's peril, and knew that it meant destruction to all. With a wilder cry than usual, “Glengarry! Glengarry!” he dashed straight into LeNoir, who gave back swiftly, caught two men who were beating Big Mack's life out, and hurled them aside, and grasping his friend's collar, hauled him to his feet, and threw him back against the wall and into the line again with his grip still upon his Frenchman's throat.  “Let dead men go, Mack,” he cried, but even as he spoke LeNoir, seeing his opportunity, sprang at him and with a backward kick caught Macdonald fair in the face and lashed him hard against the wall. It was the terrible French 'lash' and was one of LeNoir's special tricks. Black Hugh, stunned and dazed, leaned back against the wall, spreading out his hands weakly before his face. LeNoir, seeing victory within his grasp, rushed in to finish off his special foe. But Yankee Jim, who, while engaged in cheerfully knocking back the two Murphys and others who took their turn at him, had been keeping an eye on the line of battle, saw Macdonald's danger, and knowing that the crisis had come, dashed across the line, crying “Follow me, boys.” His long arms swung round his head like the sails of a wind-mill, and men fell back from him as if they had been made of wood. As LeNoir sprang, Yankee shot fiercely at him, but the Frenchman, too quick for him, ducked and leaped upon Black Hugh, who was still swaying against the wall, bore him down and jumped with his heavy “corked” boots on his breast and face. Again the Glengarry line was broken. At once the crowd surged about the Glengarry men, who now stood back to back, beating off the men leaping at them from every side, as a stag beats off dogs, and still chanting high their dauntless cry, “Glengarry forever,” to which Big Mack added at intervals, “To hell with the Papishes!” Yankee, failing to check LeNoir's attack upon Black Hugh, fought off the men crowding upon him, and made his way to the corner where the Frenchman was still engaged in kicking the prostrate Highlander to death.  “Take that, you blamed cuss,” he said, catching LeNoir in the jaw and knocking his head with a thud against the wall. Before he could strike again he was thrown against his enemy, who clutched him and held like a vice.    CHAPTER II  VENGEANCE IS MINE   The Glengarry men had fought their fight, and it only remained for their foes to wreak their vengeance upon them and wipe out old scores. One minute more would have done for them, but in that minute the door came crashing in. There was a mighty roar, “Glengarry! Glengarry!” and the great Macdonald himself, with the boy Ranald and some half-dozen of his men behind him, stood among them.

You're just seeing things. Take my advice and go home. You've had too much giggle water.\"  Reggie set his drink down hastily. For a long deliberate moment he studied the back of the dark little man at the bar. Then he shook his head dazedly. Maybe this was all some wild product of his imagination. Maybe he _was_ having hallucinations....  He shook his head again and then he shook hands with the young man in the tweed suit.  \"I'm going home, Ricky,\" he said firmly. \"Say hello to all the gang for me.\"  \"Name isn't Ricky,\" the young man said, sipping from his drink, \"but I'll tell the boys you were asking.\"  \"Good,\" Reggie said.  He left the crowded bar by a back entrance. The warm sunshine was pleasant and reassuring. People hurried past him, traffic surged in the streets, and everything was quite normal. He breathed a deep sigh and hailed a cab. He gave the driver the address of his apartment and then settled back against the soft leather cushions.  Sleep was all he needed. That was all.         *       *       *       *       *  When he reached his apartment on the near North Side he had succeeded in convincing himself that his peculiar experiences of the afternoon were only products of his fevered imagination.  As he let himself into his apartment he had firmly resolved to strictly ration his reading of comic strips and spy magazines. They were pretty strong meat if they weren't handled with discretion.  The pleasantly furnished living room of his apartment was shrouded in late-afternoon semi-darkness and, when he closed and locked the door behind him, he switched on the lights.  The first thing he saw when he walked into the room was the little dark man whom he'd seen at the Club and at the bar a few minutes previously.  The dark little man was sitting in a straight chair, his hands resting on his knees. There was a faint smile on his face as he studied Reggie with calm, inscrutable eyes.  Reggie staggered back a few steps, clapping one hand hysterically to his forehead. He couldn't believe his eyes. He had left this man at a bar in the Loop, but here he was now, sitting calmly and unconcernedly in the living room of his apartment.  \"How did you get in here?\" he gasped.  The dark little man stood up and smiled.  \"Is that important?\" he asked softly. \"I am here and that is all that matters.\"  Reggie swallowed loudly. There was something disturbing about the calm ambiguity of the man's statement. He rubbed his damp palms together nervously.  \"Can I get you a drink?\" he blurted.  The dark little man shook his head slowly.  Reggie looked at him uneasily, noticing him in detail for the first time. He was small, hardly more than five feet two and he was slenderly built. His hair was jet black and it combed straight back from a high, delicate forehead. He wore severely tailored black clothes that fitted his small frame without a wrinkle. But his eyes dominated his entire personality, for they were a cold chilling black, lusterless and unwinking, as unrevealing as twin diamonds.  Reggie shivered slightly and looked wistfully toward the door of the apartment. He coughed nervously.  \"Sorry to seem rude,\" he said, laughing weakly, \"but I've got to be toddling off now. It's been nice--er--running into you. There are magazines on the table, liquor in the ice box, so just make yourself at home.\"  He backed cautiously toward the door, smiling nervously.  \"Don't wait up for me,\" he said. \"I've--\"  \"Wait,\" the dark little man said quietly, \"I must talk with you.\"  \"Some other time,\" Reggie said, feeling behind him for the door knob. \"Awfully rushed just now. Sorry but--\"  \"Wait!\" the little man said again, but this time his voice cracked like a whip. \"Didn't you hear me? I must talk with you?\"         *       *       *       *       *  Reggie jumped at the cracking tone of the man's voice. His hand jerked away from the door knob as if it were red hot.  \"Oh, you want to talk to me?\" he said foolishly. \"I didn't understand you.\"  \"My name,\" the little man said, \"is,\" he paused and smiled cryptically, \"Demise.\"  \"Glad to know you,\" Reggie said. \"My name is--\"  \"I know your name,\" Mr. Demise said. \"I know everything about you, Reginald Van Fiddler. I know things about you that you don't know yourself.\"  \"Do you now?\" Reggie said, becoming interested in spite of himself. \"For instance?\"  \"I know that you are about to take a long trip,\" Mr. Demise said.  \"That's not news,\" Reggie said. \"My draft board just classified me 1-A. I'll be taking a long trip very shortly.\"  \"That is not the trip I am referring to,\" Mr. Demise said. \"You are going on a trip with me.\"  Reggie blinked. He couldn't think of anyone with whom he would rather not take a trip than this dark, sinister little man who called himself Mr. Demise. What did Demise mean, anyway?  \"It's nice of you, and all that,\" he said, \"but I don't think I'll be able to make it. My draft board might not like it.\"  \"They will understand,\" Mr. Demise said.  \"I don't know about that,\" Reggie said. He was beginning really to worry. There was something damnably inevitable about Mr. Demise's calm statements. \"They're pretty ticklish about such things. I think we'd just better forget the whole idea.\"  \"That is impossible,\" Mr. Demise said.  Reggie rubbed his moist palms on his trouser legs.  \"Who are you?\" he asked hesitantly. \"Have you been following me around all day just to sell me on the idea of a trip? Are you from Cook's tours?\"  Mr. Demise smiled and shook his head.  \"I am not interested in selling you the idea of a trip. I am simply telling you that you are going on a trip. I have already made all the arrangements. There is nothing that can possibly change them.\"  \"Where am I going?\" Reggie asked. His voice was a whisper.  \"With me,\" Mr. Demise said.  \"That's no answer,\" Reggie said, clutching at straws. \"Who are you? Where are you going?\"  Mr. Demise smiled again, very faintly. He walked slowly to the mantelpiece and plucked a rose from a vase. His hand closed gently over the flower as he turned to face Reggie.  \"Perhaps this will answer your questions,\" he said softly.  He opened his hand and dropped the flower to the floor at Reggie's feet. Reggie's eyes widened in sheer amazement.  [Illustration: Reggie looked at the seared rose, and then he knew...!]  For the soft glowing beauty of the flower was faded forever. It lay on the floor, a blackened, dead reminder of its former glory.  \"It's dead,\" he said incredulously. \"It withered at the touch of your hand.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Mr. Demise nodded slowly and there was a wistful sadness in his face.  \"All living things die at my touch,\" he said. \"For I am Death!\"  \"Death!\" Reggie echoed. For an instant he stared blankly at Mr. Demise. \"Death!\" he repeated. \"Why that's the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard.\" He actually felt a sensation of relief in the realization that he'd been entertaining some loony instead of an Axis agent as he'd feared. \"You're off your trolley,\" he said to Mr. Demise. \"You'd better get moving before your keeper finds you. Death! What a gag!\"  \"I assure you it is not a gag,\" Mr. Demise said slowly. \"Your time is near at hand and I have been sent to take you to the land of Darkness.\"  \"Think again, chum,\" Reggie said emphatically. \"I'm not going to Harlem with you or anyone else and that's final.\"  \"It is useless to protest,\" Mr. Demise said. \"Your destiny is sealed. You must come with me.\"  \"You are plain balmy,\" Reggie said. \"I've never heard a sillier yarn in my life. So you're Death, are you?\"  Mr. Demise nodded. \"I am one of his agents.\"  \"Changing your story a little, aren't you?\" Reggie said triumphantly. \"Well, since when has Death been announced by personal messengers? A man steps in front of a car. He's killed. That's all there is to it. There aren't little black men standing on the curb pushing him into the street, are there? And they don't come around a couple of hours in advance tipping him off, do they? No!\"  \"When a mortal passes over,\" Mr. Demise said, \"there is always an agent of Death present superintending the details. But he is not always visible to his charge.\"  Reggie poured himself a drink and lit a cigarette.  \"Well, thanks just the same,\" he said, \"but I don't want any special effects when I pass over. If there's a messenger of Death around I don't _want_ to see him. Just let him stay invisible. That's the way I want it.\"  Mr. Demise looked slightly pained. There was an embarrassed look on his normally expressionless features.  \"Usually the agent of Death is invisible,\" he said. \"In fact his orders are to remain invisible under all circumstances.\"  \"Okay then,\" Reggie said. \"You're breaking orders. Be a nice obedient chum now and fade away.\"  Mr. Demise shrugged and stepped backward--_and suddenly he was gone_! He had disappeared into thin air, soundlessly, instantaneously.  \"Why what?\" Reggie said blandly. He started to sip his drink when suddenly the full realization of what had happened burst on him. The drink fell from his nerveless fingers with a crash.  He stared frantically about the room.  _Mr. Demise was gone!_ It was incredible! It was unbelievable! But it was a fact!  He poured himself another drink and drained it in one breathless gulp. He felt his reason tottering as his gaze swung desperately about the room.  \"Mr. Demise!\" he cried. \"Come back! Where are you!\"  \"I am here before you,\" Mr. Demise's voice sounded in the air. \"Are you convinced now?\"  Reggie mopped his forehead weakly.  \"Yes,\" he gasped. \"I'm convinced.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Mr. Demise reappeared as suddenly as he had vanished. He smiled faintly at Reggie. He was apparently completely unruffled by his transformation.  Reggie poured himself another drink with"]]]
