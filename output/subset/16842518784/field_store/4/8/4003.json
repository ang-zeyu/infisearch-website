I've no actual sensations of touch or hearing, yet the scene is visually sharp in every detail.  \"There's a small village of corrugated sheet-metal houses just ahead, the sort that engineers on location might raise, and the streets between are packed with snow. Machines loaded with metal boxes crawl up and down those streets, but I've never seen their drivers. Until this morning, I never saw any people at all on the plain.\"  Dr. Hagen rattled his paper and nodded agreeably. \"Go on. What are these people like?\"  \"I can't tell you that,\" Alcorn said, \"because their images were not complete. There seems to be a sort of relationship between them and myself--a threatening one--but I can't guess what it may be. I can't even tell you what racial type they belong to, because they have no faces.\"  He crushed out his cigarette and took a deep breath, getting to the worst of it. \"I have a distinct conviction during each of these seizures that the people I see are not ordinary human beings, that they're as different from me as I am from everyone else, though not in the same way. It's the difference that makes me uneasy. I can feel the urgency and the resolution in them, as if they were determined to do--or had resigned themselves to doing--something desperately important. And then I know somehow that each of them has made some kind of decision recently, a decision that is responsible for his being what he is and where he is, and that I'll have to make a similar one when the time comes. And the worst of it is that I know no matter which way my choice falls, I'm going to be hideously unhappy.\"  The psychiatrist asked tranquilly, \"You can't guess what choice it is that you must make, or its alternative?\"  \"I can't. And that's the hell of it--not knowing.\"  The icy chill of the polar plain touched him and with it came a deeper cold that had not been a part of the dream. At that instant, he might have identified its source, but was afraid to.  \"My fear has some relation to whatever it is these people are about to do,\" he said. \"I just realized that. But that doesn't help, because I've no idea what it is.\"  He glanced at his strap watch, and the time made him stand up before the little psychiatrist could speak again. The hour was 15:57, and he saw in dismay that his 16:00 appointment with Sean O'Donnell and the Irradiated Foods tycoon would be late.  \"I don't expect an immediate opinion,\" he said. \"You couldn't reach one as long as I'm here. Add up what I've told you, and if it makes any sort of sense you can radophone me tonight at 19:00. If my apartment doesn't answer, relay the call to my cabin in the Catskills--I've kept the location a secret, for privacy's sake, but the number is on alternate listing.\"  He paused briefly at the door, touched with an uncharacteristic flash of sour humor. \"And telestat your bill to me. If I asked for it now, you'd probably charge nothing.\"         *       *       *       *       *  The mood vanished as soon as he was outside and saw the gray-suited Jaffers operative waiting with stolid patience on the ramp of a department store across the street.  The shock of reminder brought on a giddy recurrence of his hallucination.  The polar plain yawned before him. The silent machines crept over their snow-packed ways, the faceless people stood in frozen groups.  He emerged from the seizure, shaken and sweating, to find that the Jaffers man had crossed the street and was waiting a safe distance behind. Alcorn fought down a panic desire to run away blindly only because Kitty would be waiting for him at Consolidated--Kitty, his bulwark of reassurance.  The gray-suited man was a deliberate hundred feet behind him when he boarded a tube-car.  Kitty was not in his office and there was no time to ring for her.  Instead, he went through the long accounting room beyond, answering automatically the smiles of a suddenly genial staff and headed for O'Donnell's office.  He saw at once that he was too late.  The CA manager's door was open and O'Donnell and Mulhall of Irradiated Foods were emerging. Both wore street jackets and both men had the unmistakable air of euphoric calm that came within seconds of Alcorn's approach.  O'Donnell gave Alcorn his familiar long-lipped grin, looking, with his thin gentle face and neat brush of ermine-white hair, like an aristocratic Irish saint.  \"You missed a pleasant meeting,\" O'Donnell said. \"I've just signed a refund release to Charlie here, and a pleasure it was.\"  The awareness that they had been calmed before he'd arrived left Alcorn speechless.  \"Really shouldn't have accepted,\" Mulhall said sheepishly. Mulhall was a big, solid man, bald and paunchy and, when his normal instincts were controlled, an argumentative tyrant. \"Niggling technicality, I say. Shouldn't have taken a refund, but Sean here insisted.\"  They laughed together, like children sharing a joke.  \"The claim was justified,\" O'Donnell said firmly. \"Once Charlie's secretary explained the case, there was no doubt.\"  Mulhall grinned at Alcorn. \"Remarkable girl, Janice Wynn. She's waiting in Sean's office. Wants to meet you, Philip.\"  They went toward the lift with their arms about each other, sharing an all-too-brief moment of companionship.         *       *       *       *       *  Alcorn hesitated in front of the closed door of O'Donnell's office.  When he entered, Janice Wynn was standing at the window, watching the soundless rush of traffic in the street below. She was dark, not pretty in any conventional sense, but charged with a controlled vitality that made physical beauty unimportant.  Her face was anything but serene, the complex of emotions in her tilted green eyes far removed from the ready placidity he had learned to expect. There was an unmistakable impression of driving urgency--the same urgency, Alcorn thought, that he had felt in the people of his waking dream.  \"You're one,\" he said. His face felt stiff. \"After all these years, I've found another one like--\"  \"Like yourself,\" she said. \"But it's I who have found _you_. Did you really think you were unique, Philip Alcorn?\"  He tried to answer and couldn't. The meeting he had dreamed of all his life had come about with precisely the electric suddenness he had imagined, but he felt none of the elation he had anticipated. He felt, instead, a sudden panic.  For behind Mulhall's secretary, he had a shutter-swift glimpse of the frozen plain, starkly clear with its huddle of metal buildings and its faceless people clustered on the snow-packed street.  Janice Wynn gave him no time to flounder for control. \"You're the last,\" she said. \"And the most stubborn of the lot. You're lucky that we could find you in the little time we have left.\"  Alcorn said hoarsely, \"I don't know what you mean.\"  She looked more disappointed than surprised. \"You've no inkling _yet_? I've known most of the truth for days, though I still haven't made the change. Your conditioning must have been too thorough or--\"  She caught the shift of Alcorn's glance toward the window and turned quickly. The man in gray was watching them intently from the office across the street.  \"You're under surveillance!\" she said sharply. \"By whom and for how long?\"  He told her of Jaffers' call, and winced at the sudden dismay in her face.  \"At best you've killed an inoffensive psychiatrist with your problem,\" she said. \"At worst--\" She came around O'Donnell's desk toward him, her manner abruptly decisive. \"We've less time than I hoped. Come out of here, quickly.\"  In the corridor, she opened her handbag and took out a thick white envelope. \"There's no time now for explanations. The clippings will give you an idea of what you're up against. Lose your spy if you can and don't go near your apartment. I'll be at your cabin tonight at 21:00. You'll learn the rest then.\"  She pressed a stud at the elevator bank and chose an ascending lift. Alcorn realized that there would be a turbo-copter waiting for her on the roof.  She faced Philip before entering the cage. \"You have no chance at all except with us. Remember that, or you'll regret it for the rest of your _very_ short life.\"  Alcorn made no attempt to follow.  \"... except with us,\" Janice Wynn had said.  _Us?_  She was like himself, gifted with his own talent. She was connected somehow with the faceless people of his hallucinations.  Who were they, and where were they, and what did they want of him?         *       *       *       *       *  He was still groping for the answers when Kitty came toward him. She gave a little cry of dismay when she saw his face.  \"You look simply awful, Philip! Is it another of your--\"  With Kitty's arrival, Alcorn's premonition of disaster returned. Something was going to happen to him, _was_ happening to him, and unless he moved carefully, it could involve Kitty as well. He had to keep Kitty out of this, which meant that he must stay clear of her until he was safe.  \"It's nothing,\" he said hastily. \"I'll call you later, Kitty. I've another appointment now that can't wait.\"  She put out a hesitant hand. \"Philip....\"  He wanted desperately to tell her the whole improbable story, to reveal his fears and get the reassurance she was able to give him.  But he couldn't risk involving Kitty in any danger.  \"It's nothing,\" he repeated. He went down the lift quickly because he knew that if he delayed to comfort her, he would never have the courage to go at all.  His only clear thought, as he shouldered his way into the late-afternoon throng outside CA, had been to escape from Kitty and from the too-vivid memory of Janice Wynn. Now that he must choose a course, he was brought up short by the fact that, so long as he was tailed by Jaffers' men, there was literally no place for him to go.  He could not go to his apartment because of Jaffers' surveillance. He had no intention of meeting Janice Wynn at his Catskill cabin at 21:00. Her obvious knowledge--and, therefore, _theirs_--of"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32209"],["title","Assignment's End (#2)"],["body","location ruled that out as a refuge.  He looked about for the inevitable man in gray and found him following at his careful hundred feet. The crowd caught and bore them both along like chips in a millrace, keeping the interval constant.  Alcorn let himself be carried along, feeling the slow release of tension that spread outward from him through the throng. The physical pressure was also eased. People slowed their dogged pace and smiled at utter strangers.  He had wondered often how the people affected by his circle of calm accounted for their sudden change of mood. He had dreamed that one day he might walk in such a crowd and enter another island of serenity like his own and thus find another human being gifted like himself. Someone with his own needs and longings, who would not melt into ready complaisance when he drew near, but who would speak honestly and clearly, who would understand how he felt and why.  Ironically, when that moment had come in O'Donnell's office, it hadn't brought him the fulfillment he had expected. It had left, instead, a panic beyond belief.  Why? What was he afraid of?  There was nothing evil or dangerous in his own gift--why should he fear another possessing the same wild talent? Damn it, he thought, what sort of fate could be so terrible that its foreshadowing alone could throw him into such an anxious state?  How could he be sure that the faceless people were hostile? If they were like Janice Wynn, and if Janice were like himself, it might follow naturally that--  The rustle of the envelope in his pocket was like an answer, proving that his problem, if nothing else, was real.  \"... for the rest of your _very_ short life,\" she had said.         *       *       *       *       *  The sudden sharpening of awareness that preceded a new seizure rasped him again. He felt the tranquillity about him, and then the arctic montage swallowed it all, and once again he stood bodiless on the snow-packed streets of the metal village.  The faceless people moved purposefully now, and beyond them loomed the towering bulk of scaffolding erected about the pit where the great bronze cylinder of a ship lay....  Pit?  Scaffolding?  Ship?  He stopped so abruptly that a man behind him stumbled and regained balance only by clutching Alcorn's shoulder.  \"Sorry,\" the man murmured, and moved on.  The mirage vanished; the crowd behind pushed on, parting politely about Alcorn. The mass farther back surged restlessly, hurrying, grumbling like an impatient corporate organism. The Jaffers agent, caught in the press, was borne helplessly nearer.  Alcorn realized his opportunity and stood fast, waiting while the tide of bodies flowed past. The man in gray saw his intention and struggled frantically to break free of the pinioning crowd.  He failed.  A sort of grim satisfaction fell upon Alcorn when the man's face lost its urgency and settled into smiling unconcern. The gift _was_ a weapon of sorts. The way to escape--at least from Jaffers' surveillance--was open.  He fell in beside the spy, paying less attention now to the man himself than to the matter of disposing of him. The garish facade of a nearby joy-bar solved his problem.  \"Come with me,\" Alcorn ordered.         *       *       *       *       *  The joy-bar was less than half full at this early hour, but noisy enough for midnight. A concealed battery of robotics ground out a brassy blare of music, integrating random pitches--selected by electronic servo-computers--into the jarring minor cacophony that had become the latest rage.  The early patrons were intently watching the long telescreen above the bar when Alcorn came in. A quarterstaff bout--a frantic, bloody sport revived from God only knew how many centuries before--was in progress there, matching a heavily muscled Nordic with a sandy bristle of hair against a swarthy, hairless Eurasian. The Nordic, from his twisted stance, had a couple of broken ribs already; the Eurasian's right ear dangled redly.  Alcorn seated himself opposite Jaffers' operative in an isolated booth and fed the coin-slot for drinks.  \"Drink,\" he said grimly. \"You're going to be drunker, my friend, than you've ever been in your inquisitive life.\"  The uproar died out before the drinks arrived. Only the blaring music machines and the blood-roar of the telescreen remained, and a suddenly placid bartender turned both down to a murmur.  The rest was routine to Philip Alcorn's experience. Men at the bar turned to each other like old friends, forgetting submerged frustrations as readily as they forgot the vicious slash-and-parry on the screen. The place drowsed in a slow and comfortable silence.  The Jaffers man tossed off his drink and dialed another. Alcorn, raising his own, remembered Janice Wynn's letter in his pocket and set the glass down, untasted.  The clippings, she had said, would give him an idea of what he was up against.  His hands shook so violently when he ripped open the envelope that he almost dropped it.         *       *       *       *       *  Eight clippings were inside, small teleprinted scissorings from digest newssheets that were available at any street-corner dispenser. He read them quickly, and was more puzzled than before until he realized that they fell into two general groups of interlocking similarities.  Four were accounts of unexplained disappearances. A moderately successful research chemist named Ellis had vanished from the offices of his New York chemical firm; a neighborhood pharmacist in Minneapolis, a spinster tea-shop proprietress in Atlanta and a female social worker in Los Angeles had disappeared with equal thoroughness, completely baffling the efforts of police to find them.  None of these people had been of more than minor importance, even in his own immediate circle. Alcorn felt that these events had been reported only because the efficiency of missing-persons bureaus made permanent disappearance next to impossible. Even so, only one clipping--that on Ellis, the New York chemist--bothered to run a photograph.  The other four accounts dealt with violent deaths, all rising from sudden outbreaks of mob hysteria. Two of the victims had been small-town clergymen, a profession which made their lynchings as startling as they were inexplicable; both had been respected members of their little communities until the day--the date was less than a week old--their congregations rose up en masse and tore them limb from limb.  The remaining two of the second group had died in different fashions. A doctor in a Nevada mining hamlet, making a late call, had been set upon by the patient's family, knocked unconscious and shot. A Girl Scout leader in Mississippi had been thrown over a cliff by her young charges.         *       *       *       *       *  A morbid and pointless collection of horrors, Alcorn thought, until he saw the parallel that related them.  The circumstances were strikingly similar in every case except that the four who disappeared were urbanites, while the murdered ones were all members of small and comparatively isolated communities. Not one of the eight had been over thirty-five; each had been well-liked; none was wealthy, yet all were in comfortable circumstances from vocations that depended upon good will.  A further similarity built up in Alcorn's subconscious, but died unconsidered because at that moment the quarterstaff bout on the screen ended and a brazen-voiced announcer gave the time.  It was 18:30. Dr. Hagen was to call him at his apartment at 19:00.  Alcorn, mulling over the cryptic half-knowledge gained from the clippings, wondered what the little psychiatrist might make of it. Hagen was capable in his field; even with so little to work on, he might possibly come up with the right answer.  Alcorn decided that he could not run from a danger until he knew what the hazard was. He might as well face the issue squarely now and be done with it.  The Jaffers operative, on his ninth drink, had relaxed into a smiling stupor. Alcorn left him snoring in the booth and headed for the public radophone unit beyond the end of the bar. He could not be in his apartment to take Dr. Hagen's call, but he could anticipate it.  The telescreen announcer's voice stopped him short. \"_Have you seen this man? Sought by police for the murder earlier this evening of Dr. Bernard Hagen, prominent psychiatrist, he is thought to be at large somewhere in downtown...._\"  The screen showed an enlarged full-face photograph of Alcorn.         *       *       *       *       *  He was responsible for Hagen's death. But who had wanted the knowledge of Alcorn's gift--or the suppression of that knowledge--badly enough to kill the psychiatrist for it?  Jaffers, or the faceless people behind Janice Wynn?  It had to be Jaffers, he decided, eliminating a possible source of opposition and at the same stroke placing himself still further on the defensive.  Slowly, he became aware that the joy-bar had fallen quiet, that everyone in the place was watching him with a sort of intent sympathy. The bartender left his place and came toward him, his heavy face a study in concern.  \"We know you couldn't have done it,\" the man said. The sway of Alcorn's presence held him hypnotized. \"Can we help?\"  Alcorn's only thought was of flight. \"Have you a turbo-copter?\"  \"On the roof,\" the bartender said. \"It's yours.\"  Alcorn took him along to unlock the controls. On the roof landing, a cool evening wind was blowing. There was a dim thin sickle of moon and a pale haze of stars, a wraithlike scattering of small white clouds that drifted in the reflected spectrum of the city's multicolored glow.  He sat in the turbo-copter with a feeling of incredulous unreality. The vast and shining breadth of the city was spread about him like a monstrous alien puzzle, a light-shot maze without meaning. Where, in that suddenly foreign tangle, could he go?  He set the 'copter off at random, knowing that its owner would have the police on his heels the moment"]]]
