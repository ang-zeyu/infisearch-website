An overwhelming force had been met which defeated the object of the raid, and threatened the destruction of the entire force.  The day was saved by Major Stafford.  But none knew, when he dashed into the town at the head of his regiment, under a hail of bullets, that his mind was full of toyshops and clothing-stores, and that when he was so stoutly holding his position he was guarding a little boy's suit, a small sword with a gilded scabbard, and a large doll with flowing ringlets and blue eyes that could \"go to sleep.\"  Some of his friends during that year charged the Major with growing miserly, and rallied him upon hoarding up his pay and carrying large rolls of Confederate money about his person; and when, just before the raid, he invested his entire year's pay in four or five ten-dollar gold-pieces, they vowed he was mad.  \"I shall report him as a hopeless case,\" said Dr. Graham, the Surgeon. \"A man might have reason to do this in time of peace; but when a man hoards money on his person and then exposes himself as the Major does every time we have a battle, it's proof of insanity.\"  The Major, however, always met these charges with a smile.  \"Doctors are like other men,\" he said.  \"They think whatever they cannot understand, madness.\"  And as soon as his position was assured in the captured town he proved his sanity.  The fight had been a sharp one, and the town had only been seized after a desperate charge.  The shopkeepers had put up their shutters and were barricaded within their houses, while bullets were hailing and light field-pieces were cracking.  At length it grew quiet.  The owner of a handsome store on the principal street, over which was a large sign, \"Men's and Boys' Clothes,\" peeping out, saw a Confederate major ride up to the door, which had been hastily fastened when the fight began, and rap on it with the handle of his sword.  There was something in the rap that was imperative, and the owner hastily opened the door.  The officer entered.  \"Good evening.\"  He looked all about him.  \"Ah!\"  He picked up a little uniform suit of blue cloth with brass buttons.  \"You have no gray ones?\" he asked with a smile.  \"No, sir.  No use for 'em.\"  \"What is the price of this?\"  \"Ten dollars,\" stammered the shopkeeper.  \"But you can have it for nothing if you will keep your men from troubling me.\"  To his astonishment, the Confederate officer put his hand in his pocket and laid a ten-dollar gold piece on the counter.  \"Now show me where there is a toy-shop.\"  There was one only a few doors off, and the shopkeeper was most eager to show it.  But the officer said he could find it.  He went out.  The Major found and selected a boy's sword handsomely ornamented, and the most beautiful doll, over whose eyes stole the whitest of roseleaf eyelids, and which could talk as dolls talk, and do other wonderful things.  He astonished this shopkeeper also by laying down another gold-piece.  This left him but two or three more of the proceeds of his year's pay, and these he soon handed over a counter to a jeweller, who gave him a small package in exchange.  He smiled and chatted so pleasantly with the men that when he left the shopkeepers all had new ideas of at least one \"Rebel\" officer.  All during the remainder of the campaign Colonel Stafford carried a package carefully sealed and strapped on behind his saddle.  His care of it and his secrecy about it were the subjects of many jests among his friends in the brigade, and when in an engagement his horse was shot, and the Colonel, under a hot fire, stopped and calmly unbuckled his bundle, and during the rest of the fight carried it in his hand, there was a clamor afterward that he should disclose the contents. Even an offer to sing them a song would not appease his friends, though the Colonel had the best voice in the brigade.  They must know his secret.  The brigade officers were gathered around a camp-fire that night on the edge of the bloody field.  A Federal officer, Colonel Denby, who had been slightly wounded and captured in the fight, and who now sat somewhat grim and moody before the fire, was their guest.  \"Now, Stafford, open the bundle and let us into the secret,\" they all said.  \"Some of us may get shot before we know it.\"  The Colonel, without a word, but with softened eyes, rose and, going to his saddle, which lay on the ground near by, brought the parcel to the fire.  Kneeling down, he took out his knife and carefully opened the outer cover of oil-skin.  Many a jest was levelled at him across the blazing logs as he did so.  But a smile was on his face, and the Federal colonel thought to himself what a fine, high-bred face it was.  One said the Colonel had turned pedler, and was trying to eke out a living by running the blockade on Lilliputian principles; another wagered that he had it full of Confederate bills; a third, that it was a talisman against bullets, and so on.  Within the outer covering were several others; but at length the last was reached.  As the Colonel ripped carefully, the group gathered around and bent breathlessly over him, the light from the blazing camp-fire shining ruddily on their eager, weather-tanned faces.  When the Colonel put in his hand and drew out a toy sword, there was a general exclamation.  But when he took the doll from her soft wrapping, and then unrolled and held up a tiny jacket and a pair of little trousers not much larger than a man's hand, and just the size for a five-year-old boy, there was a dead silence and the men turned away their faces from the fire, and more than one who had boys of his own at home put his hand up to his eyes.  [Illustration: The Major's Christmas presents.]  One of them, the bronzed and weather-beaten officer who had charged the Colonel with being a miser and who wore crepe on his sleeve, stretched himself out on the ground, flat on his face, and sobbed.  As Colonel Stafford gently told his story of Charlie and Evelyn, even the grave face of Colonel Denby looked somewhat changed in the light of the fire, and he reached over for the doll.  \"May I see it?\"  \"Certainly.\"  A half dozen hands were stretched out to pass it to him. He handled it tenderly.  \"I, too, have a little one at home,\" he said in a low voice, as he handed the doll back to Colonel Stafford.  \"The child of my only son. He was killed at Genies's Mill.\"  That night Colonel Stafford and Colonel Denby slept under the same blanket.     IV  THE BOYS LEARN SOMETHING OF WAR  During the whole year the children had been looking forward to the coming of Christmas.  Charlie's outbursts of petulance and not rare fits of anger were invariably checked if any mention was made of his father's injunction to take care of his mother and little sister; and at length he became accustomed to curbing himself by the recollection of the charge he had received.  If he fell and hurt himself, even badly, in his constant attempts to climb up impossible places, he would simply snap his eyes and rub himself, and presently, say, proudly, \"I don't cry now; I am a knight, and next Christmas I am going to be a man, 'cause my papa's goin' to tell Santa Claus to bring me a pair of breeches and a sword.\"  Evelyn could not help crying when she was hurt, for she was only a very little girl; but she added to her prayer of \"God bless and keep my papa, and bring him safe home,\" the petition, \"Please, God, bless and keep Santa Tlaus, and let him come here Trismas.\"  Old Bob and Ran, too, as well as the younger ones, looked forward eagerly to Christmas.  But this year brought the war much closer to Holly Hill.  Heretofore it had been to the children, even to Bob, something dim and distant, like a cloud on the horizon, with grumblings of thunder and sheet-lightning that threatened but did not strike.  But now it swept up to Holly Hill like a storm, then like a flood rolled over it.  The main armies passed along the great road some way off, the Northern troops pushing on and on, nearer and nearer, until the big guns could be heard to the northward, making the ground tremble and the windows shake.  At such times, Mrs. Stafford would stop and listen with white face and moving lips, and the older boys would stand beside her and count the reports in low tones, for they knew a great battle was being fought, and their father might be there.  What would happen in case their side was beaten and had to fall back, they trembled to think.  All the horses would be taken and the corn.  That would mean starvation.  And, perhaps, the house might be burnt.  They had heard of such things elsewhere.  And they might have to \"refugee.\"  This had its pleasant side for the boys, for they would have to travel south and, maybe, camp like gypsies or the \"young marooners.\"  Bob was full of excitement as to this, and used to thrill Ran, telling how they would live, and how they would mount guard at night, and evade their pursuers--or sometimes make a stand against them, on a hill, or at a stream, throwing up their breastworks and holding them back with his gun while their mother and \"the children\" escaped.  Then they would go out to the stable and, seated on a manger, talk it all over with Uncle Saunders, the carriage-driver, who was guide, philosopher, and friend to them.  Uncle Saunders would sometimes be consoling and sometimes almost disappointing.  \"They wer'n't goin' refugeein' like a parcel of gypsies.\"  (Uncle Saunders' ideas of camping-out were not orthodox.)  \"But 'tain't no danger: no Yankees could git to them.  If they could, they'd 'a' been long ago,\" reasoned Uncle Saunders.  And if a few of \"them pesky raiders slipt through and got there, he'd like to see 'em git his horses--he jist would.  He knew a place he could hide 'em where they'd never find 'em.  Gab'rull could hardly find 'em when he comes to blow his horn.\"  This, at least, was exciting, and Bob was all ears.  He seized the old driver by the arm.  \"Where is it, Uncle Saunders?  You'll tell _me_?  Please.  I won't tell a"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33666"],["title","A Captured Santa Claus (#2)"],["body","oul--not even Ran.  You know I won't if I promise.\"  But no; Uncle Saunders shut up like a clam--as tight as the high-barn door.  \"Well, if I guess, will you tell me?  Give me three guesses: all right? Is it the thick pines the other side of the creek where the old mine used to be?\"  Uncle Saunders shook his head.  \"Well, is it the big marsh with the high willows, and the old wagon-track?\"  \"You know, boy, I ain't goin' to teck my horses--my Black George and Blifil into dat mash!\"  \"Well--?  (strung out very long).  Is it--?  Let me see--I've got only one more guess--haven't I?\"  \"I ain't give you nothin',\" said Uncle Saunders, disappointingly.  \"You jist guessin' around heah.\"  But Bob insisted that by letting him guess twice he had agreed to the plan; and, in fact, it did look so.  \"Well, go on, den,\" said Uncle Saunders at last.  Bob, after long thought, began again, guilefully watching Uncle Saunders' oracular face to read his success or failure by his expression.  \"Well--is it?  No, it isn't that.  Is it--the deep--?  No; I don't want to ask that, I know it is not that--Is it the great woods?\"  (This with a jump.)  Old Saunders started to shake his head, and then looked around so guilefully to see that nobody was in ear-shot, that Bob dropped his voice to its most mysterious tone as he whispered, \"Is that it?\"  It may be doubted whether Uncle Saunders, for all his apparent confiding of his secret to Bob, was not playing a game with him, and merely letting him suppose he had guessed his secret refuge.  But, however this was, and however clever he was at acting, Uncle Saunders was not clever enough to foretell the future.  One morning, as Uncle Saunders was on his way to the stable, a party of men came galloping up the hill from toward the river, and in ten minutes all Uncle Saunders' plans were overthrown, and his horses, his cherished friends, were being led away amid his reproaches and the lamentations of the boys.  \"Sam, you'll have to get up earlier in the morning than this to get ahead of us,\" laughed one of the men.  \"Dat ain't my name,\" said Uncle Saunders, curtly.  \"You think so much of your horses, you'd better come along and attend to them.  We'll pay you wages and set you free.\"  Uncle Saunders shook his head.  \"Nor, I'm goin' to stay right heah and teck keer o' my mistis and de chillern.--My master told me to teck keer ov 'em while he was away, and I'm goin' to stay heah till he comes back.\"  \"You'll stay here till the war's over, then,\" said the blue-coat. \"Your master, as you call him, will not be back here till then.  We are going on to Richmond.\"  \"You won't get there,\" said Bob with spirit.  \"You've been trying to get there for over three years and haven't done it.\"  \"No, little Johnny, we haven't yet, but we're still on the way,\" said the soldier.  By breakfast-time the plantation had been completely overrun; and all that day the blue-clad troops were passing by.   It began to look after a little as if Bob's prediction were going to come true.  The Union Armies did not reach Richmond.  Their advance was stayed a few miles beyond Holly Hill.  But Holly Hill and its family were well within the Federal lines, and there was no chance of being reached by any message or thing from the other side of the line.  The roads, knee-deep in mud, were filled with troops in blue uniforms marching up and down, or with wagons passing backward and forward, piled high with boxes or forage.  The children grew so used to them that they would go down to the roadside and watch them as they passed. The only Confederates the children ever saw now were the dejected prisoners who were being passed back on their way to prison.  The only news they ever received was the rumors which reached them from Federal sources.  Mrs. Stafford's heart was heavy within her, and when a day or two before Christmas she heard Charlie and Evelyn, as they sat before the fire, gravely talking of the long-expected presents which their father had promised that Santa Claus should bring them, she could stand it no longer.  She took Bob and Ran into her room, and there told them that, now as it was impossible for their father to come, they must help her entertain \"the children\" and console them for their disappointment. The two boys responded heartily, as true boys always will when thrown on their manliness.  \"I knew he could not get here,\" said Ran.  \"I knew no one else could; but papa,\" said Bob, \"but I hoped he might. He can do so many things no one else can do.\"  Mrs. Stafford shook her head.  For the next two days Mrs. Stafford and both the boys were busy.  Mrs. Stafford, when Charlie was not present, gave her time to cutting out and making a little gray uniform-suit from an old coat her husband had worn when he first entered the army; while the boys employed themselves, Bob in making a pretty little sword and scabbard out of an old piece of gutter, and Ran, who had a wonderful turn for carving, in carving a doll from a piece of hard-seasoned wood.  The day before Christmas the boys lost a little time in following and pitying a small lot of prisoners who passed along the road by the gate. They were always pitying the prisoners and planning means to rescue them, for they had an idea that they suffered a terrible fate.  Only one certain case had come to their knowledge.  A young man had one day been carried by the Holly Hill gate on his way to the head-quarters of the officer in command of that portion of the lines, General Denby.  He was in citizen's clothes, which were muddy and torn, and he was charged with being a spy.  The guards with him looked grim.  His face was white, and yet he was a fierce-looking young fellow, speaking scornfully to his guards.  Bob and Ran returned to the house, full of excitement, and spent some time that night planning how they might rescue him.  Their plan included no less than the capture of General Denby himself.  Bob mapped it all out--how he would cross the creek, dodging the picket at the bridge, slip past the sentries, and walking into the farm-house where the General had his headquarters, would seize him and force him to write a release of the prisoner.  The next morning, Ran, who had risen early to visit his hare-traps, rushed into his mother's room, white-faced and wide-eyed.  \"Oh! mamma!\" he gasped, \"they have hung him, just because he had on those clothes.  Uncle Saunders heard all about it.\"  Mrs. Stafford, though she was much moved herself, endeavored to explain to the boy that this was one of the laws of war, but Ran's mind was not able to comprehend the principles which imposed so cruel a sentence for what he deemed so harmless a fault.  \"It's that old General Denby!\" he exclaimed, hotly.  \"Even his own soldiers say he works them to death.  I wish somebody would capture him.\"  This act and some other measures of severity gave General Denby a reputation for much harshness among the few old residents who yet remained at their homes within the lines, and the boys used to gaze at him furtively as he would ride by, grim and stern, followed by his staff.  Yet there were those who said that General Denby's rigor was simply the result of a high standard of duty, and that at bottom he had a soft heart.  The children, however, could never bear to think of him, and when he would pass along with his staff, as he sometimes did, while they were watching beside the road, and would look at them with something very like a smile in his eyes, they would turn their heads away for fear he would speak to them.     V  THE SPY  The approach of Christmas was marked even in the Federal camps, and many a song and ringing laugh were heard around the camp-fires glowing along the hills and in the tents and little cabins used as winter-quarters, over the boxes which were pouring in from home.  The troops in the camps near General Denby's head-quarters on Christmas Eve had been larking and frolicking all day like so many boys, preparing for the festivities of the evening, when they proposed to have a great entertainment; and the General, as he sat in the smoky front room in the old farm-house used as his head-quarters, writing official papers, had more than once during the afternoon half-frowned at the noise and shouting outside.  It disturbed him.  A holiday occasion was not the easiest time for a general in command, especially when the enemy lay in force scarcely five miles away.  The men were apt to think that at such a time discipline should be relaxed, and they be allowed to take it easy.  And such an occasion was just the moment when his opponent, a general as watchful as he was able, was likely to make an attack.  News had reached him through his scouts that such an attack was probable.  Moreover, the General had been working all day answering despatches from men in Washington, telling him to do things that were either impossible or had been done long ago.  And, to crown it all, the chimney smoked badly.  At length, however, late in the afternoon, he finished his work, and having dismissed his Adjutant, he locked the door, and pushing aside all his business papers, took from his pocket a little letter and began to read.  As he read, the stern lines of the grim soldier's face relaxed, and more than once a smile stole into his eyes and stirred the corners of his grizzled mustache.  The letter was scrawled in a large, childish hand, and many of the words were interlined.  It ran:   \"MY DEAREST GRANDPAPA: I want to see you very much.  I send you a Christmas gift.  I made it all myself.  I hope to get a whole lot of dolls and other presents.  I love you.  I send you all these kisses ************.  You must kiss them every one.  Don't I write well?  \"Your loving little granddaughter,   \"LILY.\"   When he had finished reading, the old veteran gravely lifted the letter to his lips and pressed a kiss on each of the little spaces, so carefully drawn by the childish hand.  This done, he took out his handkerchief and blew his"]]]
