The body appeared to be perfectly healthy.  Then there was police evidence, which showed that all the doors and windows were found shut and completely fastened, except the front door, which, although shut, was not bolted. There were shutters behind the French windows in the smoking-room, and these were found fastened. No money was found in the bureau, nor in any of the opened drawers, so that if any had been there, it had been stolen. The pockets were entirely empty, except for a small pair of nail scissors, and there was no watch upon the body, nor a ring. Certain footprints were found on the garden beds, which had led the police to take certain steps. No footprints were to be seen on the garden path, which was hard gravel.  _Mr. Alexander Campbell_, stockbroker, stated that he had known deceased for some few years, and had done business for him. He and Mr. Kingscote frequently called on one another, and on Tuesday evening they dined together at Ivy Cottage. They sat smoking and chatting till nearly twelve o'clock, when Mr. Kingscote himself let him out, the servants having gone to bed. Here the witness proceeded rather excitedly: \"That is all I know of this horrible business, and I can say nothing else. What the police mean by following and watching me----\"  _The Coroner_: \"Pray be calm, Mr. Campbell. The police must do what seems best to them in a case of this sort. I am sure you would not have them neglect any means of getting at the truth.\"  _Witness_: \"Certainly not. But if they suspect me, why don't they say so? It is intolerable that I should be----\"  _The Coroner_: \"Order, order, Mr. Campbell. You are here to give evidence.\"  The witness then, in answer to questions, stated that the French windows of the smoking-room had been left open during the evening, the weather being very warm. He could not recollect whether or not deceased closed them before he left, but he certainly did not close the shutters. Witness saw nobody near the house when he left.  _Mr. Douglas Kingscote_, architect, said deceased was his brother. He had not seen him for some months, living as he did in another part of the country. He believed his brother was fairly well off, and he knew that he had made a good amount by speculation in the last year or two. Knew of no person who would be likely to owe his brother a grudge, and could suggest no motive for the crime except ordinary robbery. His brother was to have been married in a few weeks. Questioned further on this point, witness said that the marriage was to have taken place a year ago, and it was with that view that Ivy Cottage, deceased's residence, was taken. The lady, however, sustained a domestic bereavement, and afterwards went abroad with her family: she was, witness believed, shortly expected back to England.  _William Bates_, jobbing gardener, who was brought up in custody, was cautioned, but elected to give evidence. Witness, who appeared to be much agitated, admitted having been in the garden of Ivy Cottage at four in the morning, but said that he had only gone to attend to certain plants, and knew absolutely nothing of the murder. He however admitted that he had no order for work beyond what he had done the day before. Being further pressed, witness made various contradictory statements, and finally said that he had gone to take certain plants away.  The inquest was then adjourned.  This was the case as it stood--apparently not a case presenting any very striking feature, although there seemed to me to be doubtful peculiarities in many parts of it. I asked Hewitt what he thought.  \"Quite impossible to think anything, my boy, just yet; wait till we see the place. There are any number of possibilities. Kingscote's friend, Campbell, may have come in again, you know, by way of the window--or he may not. Campbell may have owed him money or something--or he may not. The anticipated wedding may have something to do with it--or, again, _that_ may not. There is no limit to the possibilities, as far as we can see from this report--a mere dry husk of the affair. When we get closer we shall examine the possibilities by the light of more detailed information. One _probability_ is that the wretched gardener is innocent. It seems to me that his was only a comparatively blameless manoeuvre not unheard of at other times in his trade. He came at four in the morning to steal away the flowers he had planted the day before, and felt rather bashful when questioned on the point. Why should he trample on the beds, else? I wonder if the police thought to examine the beds for traces of rooting up, or questioned the housekeeper as to any plants being missing? But we shall see.\"  We chatted at random as the train drew near Finchley, and I mentioned _inter alia_ the wanton piece of destruction perpetrated at Kingscote's late lodgings. Hewitt was interested.  \"That was curious,\" he said, \"very curious. Was anything else damaged? Furniture and so forth?\"  \"I don't know. Mrs. Clayton said nothing of it, and I didn't ask her. But it was quite bad enough as it was. The decoration was really good, and I can't conceive a meaner piece of tomfoolery than such an attack on a decent woman's property.\"  Then Hewitt talked of other cases of similar stupid damage by creatures inspired by a defective sense of humour, or mere love of mischief. He had several curious and sometimes funny anecdotes of such affairs at museums and picture exhibitions, where the damage had been so great as to induce the authorities to call him in to discover the offender. The work was not always easy, chiefly from the mere absence of intelligible motive; nor, indeed, always successful. One of the anecdotes related to a case of malicious damage to a picture--the outcome of blind artistic jealousy--a case which had been hushed up by a large expenditure in compensation. It would considerably startle most people, could it be printed here, with the actual names of the parties concerned.  Ivy Cottage, Finchley, was a compact little house, standing in a compact little square of garden, little more than a third of an acre, or perhaps no more at all. The front door was but a dozen yards or so back from the road, but the intervening space was well treed and shrubbed. Mr. Douglas Kingscote had not yet returned from town, but the housekeeper, an intelligent, matronly woman, who knew of his intention to call in Martin Hewitt, was ready to show us the house.  \"_First_,\" Hewitt said, when we stood in the smoking-room, \"I observe that somebody has shut the drawers and the bureau. That is unfortunate. Also, the floor has been washed and the carpet taken up, which is much worse. That, I suppose, was because the police had finished their examination, but it doesn't help me to make one at all. Has _anything_--anything _at all_--been left as it was on Tuesday morning?\"  \"Well, sir, you see everything was in such a muddle,\" the housekeeper began, \"and when the police had done----\"  \"Just so. I know. You 'set it to rights,' eh? Oh, that setting to rights! It has lost me a fortune at one time and another. As to the other rooms, now, have they been set to rights?\"  \"Such as was disturbed have been put right, sir, of course.\"  \"Which were disturbed? Let me see them. But wait a moment.\"  He opened the French windows, and closely examined the catch and bolts. He knelt and inspected the holes whereinto the bolts fell, and then glanced casually at the folding shutters. He opened a drawer or two, and tried the working of the locks with the keys the housekeeper carried. They were, the housekeeper explained, Mr. Kingscote's own keys. All through the lower floors Hewitt examined some things attentively and closely, and others with scarcely a glance, on a system unaccountable to me. Presently, he asked to be shown Mr. Kingscote's bedroom, which had not been disturbed, \"set to rights,\" or slept in since the crime. Here, the housekeeper said, all drawers were kept unlocked but two--one in the wardrobe and one in the dressing-table, which Mr. Kingscote had always been careful to keep locked. Hewitt immediately pulled both drawers open without difficulty. Within, in addition to a few odds and ends, were papers. All the contents of these drawers had been turned over confusedly, while those of the unlocked drawers were in perfect order.  \"The police,\" Hewitt remarked, \"may not have observed these matters. Any more than such an ordinary thing as _this_,\" he added, picking up a bent nail lying at the edge of a rug.  The housekeeper doubtless took the remark as a reference to the entire unimportance of a bent nail, but I noticed that Hewitt dropped the article quietly into his pocket.  We came away. At the front gate we met Mr. Douglas Kingscote, who had just returned from town. He introduced himself, and expressed surprise at our promptitude both of coming and going.  \"You can't have got anything like a clue in this short time, Mr. Hewitt?\" he asked.  \"Well, no,\" Hewitt replied, with a certain dryness, \"perhaps not. But I doubt whether a month's visit would have helped me to get anything very striking out of a washed floor and a houseful of carefully cleaned-up and 'set-to-rights' rooms. Candidly, I don't think you can reasonably expect much of me. The police have a much better chance--they had the scene of the crime to examine. I have seen just such a few rooms as any one might see in the first well-furnished house he might enter. The trail of the housemaid has overlaid all the others.\"  \"I'm very sorry for that; the fact was, I expected rather more of the police; and, indeed, I wasn't here in time entirely to prevent the clearing up. But still, I thought your well-known powers----\"  \"My dear sir, my 'well-known powers' are nothing but common sense assiduously applied and"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/37820"],["title","Chronicles of Martin Hewitt (#2)"],["body","quick by habit. That won't enable me to see the invisible.\"  \"But can't we have the rooms put back into something of the state they were in? The cook will remember----\"  \"No, no. That would be worse and worse; that would only be the housemaid's trail in turn overlaid by the cook's. You must leave things with me for a little, I think.\"  \"Then you don't give the case up?\" Mr. Kingscote asked anxiously.  \"Oh, no! I don't give it up just yet. Do you know anything of your brother's private papers--as they were before his death?\"  \"I never knew anything till after that. I have gone over them, but they are all very ordinary letters. Do you suspect a theft of papers?\"  Martin Hewitt, with his hands on his stick behind him, looked sharply at the other, and shook his head. \"No,\" he said, \"I can't quite say that.\"  We bade Mr. Douglas Kingscote good-day, and walked towards the station. \"Great nuisance, that setting to rights,\" Hewitt observed, on the way. \"If the place had been left alone, the job might have been settled one way or another by this time. As it is, we shall have to run over to your old lodgings.\"  \"My old lodgings?\" I repeated, amazed. \"Why my old lodgings?\"  Hewitt turned to me with a chuckle and a wide smile. \"Because we can't see the broken panel-work anywhere else,\" he said. \"Let's see--Chelsea, isn't it?\"  \"Yes, Chelsea. But why--you don't suppose the people who defaced the panels also murdered the man who painted them?\"  \"Well,\" Hewitt replied, with another smile, \"that would be carrying a practical joke rather far, wouldn't it? Even for the ordinary picture damager.\"  \"You mean you _don't_ think they did it, then? But what _do_ you mean?\"  \"My dear fellow, I don't mean anything but what I say. Come now, this is rather an interesting case despite appearances, and it _has_ interested me: so much, in fact, that I really think I forgot to offer Mr. Douglas Kingscote my condolence on his bereavement. You see a problem is a problem, whether of theft, assassination, intrigue, or anything else, and I only think of it as one. The work very often makes me forget merely human sympathies. Now, you have often been good enough to express a very flattering interest in my work, and you shall have an opportunity of exercising your own common sense in the way I am always having to exercise mine. You shall see all my evidence (if I'm lucky enough to get any) as I collect it, and you shall make your own inferences. That will be a little exercise for you; the sort of exercise I should give a pupil if I had one. But I will give you what information I have, and you shall start fairly from this moment. You know the inquest evidence, such as it was, and you saw everything I did in Ivy Cottage?\"  \"Yes; I think so. But I'm not much the wiser.\"  \"Very well. Now I will tell you. What does the whole case look like? How would you class the crime?\"  \"I suppose as the police do. An ordinary case of murder with the object of robbery.\"  \"It is _not_ an ordinary case. If it were, I shouldn't know as much as I do, little as that is; the ordinary cases are always difficult. The assailant did not come to commit a burglary, although he was a skilled burglar, or one of them was, if more than one were concerned. The affair has, I think, nothing to do with the expected wedding, nor had Mr. Campbell anything to do in it--at any rate, personally--nor the gardener. The criminal (or one of them) was known personally to the dead man, and was well-dressed: he (or again one of them, and I think there were two) even had a chat with Mr. Kingscote before the murder took place. He came to ask for something which Mr. Kingscote was unwilling to part with,--perhaps hadn't got. It was not a bulky thing. Now you have all my materials before you.\"  \"But all this doesn't look like the result of the blind spite that would ruin a man's work first and attack him bodily afterwards.\"  \"Spite isn't always blind, and there are other blind things besides spite; people with good eyes in their heads are blind sometimes, even detectives.\"  \"But where did you get all this information? What makes you suppose that this was a burglar who didn't want to burgle, and a well-dressed man, and so on?\"  Hewitt chuckled and smiled again.  \"I saw it--saw it, my boy, that's all,\" he said. \"But here comes the train.\"  On the way back to town, after I had rather minutely described Kingscote's work on the boarding-house panels, Hewitt asked me for the names and professions of such fellow lodgers in that house as I might remember. \"When did you leave yourself?\" he ended.  \"Three years ago, or rather more. I can remember Kingscote himself; Turner, a medical student--James Turner, I think; Harvey Challitt, diamond merchant's articled pupil--he was a bad egg entirely, he's doing five years for forgery now; by the bye he had the room we are going to see till he was marched off, and Kingscote took it--a year before I left; there was Norton--don't know what he was; 'something in the City,' I think; and Carter Paget, in the Admiralty Office. I don't remember any more at this moment; there were pretty frequent changes. But you can get it all from Mrs. Lamb, of course.\"  \"Of course; and Mrs. Lamb's exact address is--what?\"  I gave him the address, and the conversation became disjointed. At Farringdon station, where we alighted, Hewitt called two hansoms. Preparing to enter one, he motioned me to the other, saying, \"You get straight away to Mrs. Lamb's at once. She may be going to burn that splintered wood, or to set things to rights, after the manner of her kind, and you can stop her. I must make one or two small inquiries, but I shall be there half an hour after you.\"  \"Shall I tell her our object?\"  \"Only that I may be able to catch her mischievous lodgers--nothing else yet.\" He jumped into the hansom and was gone.  I found Mrs. Lamb still in a state of indignant perturbation over the trick served her four days before. Fortunately, she had left everything in the panelled room exactly as she had found it, with an idea of the being better able to demand or enforce reparation should her lodgers return. \"The room's theirs, you see, sir,\" she said, \"till the end of the week, since they paid in advance, and they may come back and offer to make amends, although I doubt it. As pleasant-spoken a young chap as you might wish, he seemed, him as come to take the rooms. 'My cousin,' says he, 'is rather an invalid, havin' only just got over congestion of the lungs, and he won't be in London till this evening late. He's comin' up from Birmingham,' he ses, 'and I hope he won't catch a fresh cold on the way, although of course we've got him muffled up plenty.' He took the rooms, sir, like a gentleman, and mentioned several gentlemen's names I knew well, as had lodged here before; and then he put down on that there very table, sir.\"--Mrs. Lamb indicated the exact spot with her hand, as though that made the whole thing much more wonderful--\"he put down on that very table a week's rent in advance, and ses, 'That's always the best sort of reference, Mrs. Lamb, I think,' as kind-mannered as anything--and never 'aggled about the amount nor nothing. He only had a little black bag, but he said his cousin had all the luggage coming in the train, and as there was so much p'r'aps they wouldn't get it here till next day. Then he went out and came in with his cousin at eleven that night--Sarah let 'em in her own self--and in the morning they was gone--and this!\" Poor Mrs. Lamb, plaintively indignant, stretched her arm towards the wrecked panels.  \"If the gentleman as you say is comin' on, sir,\" she pursued, \"can do anything to find 'em, I'll prosecute 'em, that I will, if it costs me ten pound. I spoke to the constable on the beat, but he only looked like a fool, and said if I knew where they were I might charge 'em with wilful damage, or county court 'em. Of course I know I can do that if I knew where they were, but how can I find 'em? Mr. Jones he said his name was; but how many Joneses is there in London, sir?\"  I couldn't imagine any answer to a question like this, but I condoled with Mrs. Lamb as well as I could. She afterwards went on to express herself much as her sister had done with regard to Kingscote's death, only as the destruction of her panels loomed larger in her mind, she dwelt primarily on that. \"It might almost seem,\" she said, \"that somebody had a deadly spite on the pore young gentleman, and went breakin' up his paintin' one night, and murderin' him the next!\"  I examined the broken panels with some care, having half a notion to attempt to deduce something from them myself, if possible. But I could deduce nothing. The beading had been taken out, and the panels, which were thick in the centre but bevelled at the edges, had been removed and split up literally into thin firewood, which lay in a tumbled heap on the hearth and about the floor. Every panel in the room had been treated in the same way, and the result was a pretty large heap of sticks, with nothing whatever about them to distinguish them from other sticks, except the paint on one face, which I observed in many cases had been scratched and scraped away. The rug was drawn half across the hearth, and had evidently been used to deaden the sound of chopping. But mischief--wanton and stupid mischief--was all I could deduce from it all.  Mr. Jones's cousin, it seemed, only Sarah had seen, as she admitted him in the evening, and then he was so heavily muffled that she could not distinguish his features, and would never be able to identify him. But as for the other one, Mrs. Lamb was ready to swear to him anywhere.  Hewitt was long in coming, and internal symptoms of the approach of dinner-time (we had had no lunch) had made themselves felt before a sharp ring at the door-bell foretold his arrival. \"I have had to wait for answers to a telegram,\" he said in explanation, \"but at any rate I have the information I wanted. And these are the mysterious"]]]
