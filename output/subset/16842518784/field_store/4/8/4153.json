Much time was spent along creeks where pools, which contained many small fish, were drying. Pellets were common under a small roost. Grasshoppers and beetles were the two staple foods in the diet at this time, as shown by their high frequencies and high percentages in pellets. The high percentage and frequency of wheat corroborates the observation that most of the feeding was being done in wheat fields. The relatively large percentages of fish bones, crayfish, and snail shells can be correlated with the observation that much time was spent by the crows at the pools in creek beds. Many ants were in the pellets. The total percentage of animal materials in the pellets was much higher in this period than in other periods. Plant material had been the highest, percentagewise, during most of the summer, except in the latter part of July. Most studies of food of the crow have shown a higher content of animal material during the summer than does my study. It would seem that much of the food material which did not show up in pellets during the summer was animal material.  Grasshoppers predominated in the diet in early October; some pellets consisted of little other than grasshopper mandibles and leg joints. Wheat is sown in this area from September 10 to October 15, most of it being sown after October 5, the recommended Hessian fly-free date. Most of the grain sorghum is harvested by mid-October. However, the utilization of both of these items was low in October. By October 10 only one pool was left in the creek bed under observation. The amount of fish bones, crayfish, and snail shells in the pellets decreased during this period.  Killing frosts occurred in mid-October. The percentage of grasshoppers in the diet then declined rapidly and later in the autumn declined more slowly. Nevertheless, grasshoppers and beetles remained the predominant animal-food residues into December and frequencies of occurrence remained relatively high.  As autumn progressed and insects became scarcer, plant material made up an ever-larger percentage of the diet. Wheat and sorghum constituted more than one-half of the food residues in this period. However, in December utilization of sorghum by resident crows in eastern Harvey County decreased. Sorghum is not an important crop in this area.  ROOSTS OF WINTERING CROWS.--The collections of pellets from roosts of wintering crows in western Harvey County and northeastern Reno County differed in having a higher percentage of plant material. Sorghum, corn, and wheat predominated in early autumn, while sorghum, sunflower seed, and corn predominated in the winter. Ants were utilized to a much greater extent in early autumn. For grasshoppers and beetles, frequency of occurrence was high but percentages were low. Most of the standing water in the sand dune country had dried approximately one year before, and the aquatic component of the diet was almost entirely lacking.  The two principal food items taken by crows in the winter of 1953 were grain sorghum and sunflower seed. Censuses in late November and late December, 1953, showed that feeding was mostly in harvested sorghum fields and corn fields, but alfalfa fields, wheat fields, plowed fields, and native pasture were also utilized.  Sorghum and sunflower seeds were also the staple foods during December, 1952. Oats and wheat showed higher percentages than in 1953, perhaps because different foods were available in these two winters or because of differences in locality. The pellets collected in 1952 were from western Harvey County, whereas most of those collected in 1953 were from northeastern Reno County.  The collection taken in February, 1954, showed a large percentage of oats in the diet. Newly sown oat fields were probably a major source of food at that time.   Economic and Ecologic Significance  The chief factors that determine the economic bearing of crows locally are: the yearly diet, the time of year in which each food item is taken, and fluctuation in the population density at different times of year. In the study here reported upon, the yearly diet was computed by averaging the percentages of each item determined for each biweekly period. Of the twenty-one collecting periods shown in the tables, six are overlapping pairs; that is to say, each includes one collection from eastern Harvey County and one from the western part of the study area. The average of these pairs was used in computing the yearly average. The yearly average is therefore based upon eighteen separate samples.  The percentages are weighted toward the food items taken in summer and autumn, since many biweekly periods in late winter and early spring are not represented. Of the collecting periods represented, two were in spring, six were in summer, seven were in autumn, and three were in winter. Pellets collected at a number of different localities are averaged together as a percentage; consequently the figures obtainable do not necessarily represent the diet of any one group of crows. Nevertheless the percentages obtained by this method are perhaps valid as a general indication of the diet of the crows in this area.  In my samples, plant material amounted to 69 per cent of the indigestible residues. Similar percentages have been found in other studies, ranging from 57 per cent (Barrows and Schwarz, 1895:72) to 71.86 per cent (Kalmbach, 1918:43). The percentage of plant material was highest in the winter. In one collection from a wintering crow roost it amounted to 99.5 per cent. In December in eastern Harvey County it averaged only 85.3 per cent. The lowest percentage (20) was found in the first half of October in eastern Harvey County when grasshoppers amounted to more than half the diet. At this same time pellets collected from the wintering roosts contained 72.4 per cent plant material.       Percentages of the chief items in the total food residues,      and (in parentheses) number of sampling periods in which      each item was represented, are shown in the following list:      wheat 23.2 per cent (20), sorghum 15.2 (16), oat 7.8 (8),      sunflower 7.2 (8), corn 5.4 (12), brome 4.2 (5), other grass      2.4 (7), cherry 1.2 (2), beetle 13.3 (21), grasshopper 9.3      (19), ant .7 (3), miscellaneous insect .2 (2), mammal 2.6      (19), bird .8 (1), eggshell .5 (3), snake .1 (2), fish .9      (9), crayfish 2.4 (12), snail .2 (9).  Wheat is the \"staff-of-life\" of the crows in south-central Kansas and the percentage recorded in the diet in my study is much higher than the percentages found by other investigators. Wheat, being the principal crop in this area, was a readily available food. The fluctuations in the use of wheat were due to fluctuations in the availability of other foods that were preferred. In eastern Harvey County wheat consumption was 35.7 per cent of the diet in the latter part of July, and 49.1 per cent in December.  Consumption of wheat was high (34.4 per cent) during the harvest in June. However, this does not indicate serious damage since the crow population at this time was low, and much of the wheat eaten probably was shattered waste grain. When plowing began, wheat consumption was much reduced. At the time wheat was sown, September 10 to October 15, consumption was average to low.  In western Harvey County wheat was less important in the diet of wintering crows. After reaching a peak (22.7 per cent) in October, just after sowing, it steadily decreased, varying from 6.9 per cent to none in December.  The wheat consumption of crows has little significance economically. No instances of damage were reported to me either at the time of harvest or at the time of sowing. Although crows undoubtedly do eat wheat from newly sown fields, this utilization seldom damages the stand. No evidence of pulling young wheat was found. Most wheat eaten was waste grain.  Grain sorghum was the staple food of the wintering crows. In eastern Harvey County, where sorghum is not an important crop, its consumption began in August, reached a peak in the last part of November, and fell off sharply in December. The grain sorghum crop is vulnerable to damage by crows and it is ripening in the autumn as the crow population is building up. In certain areas and certain years the loss may be important. An exceptional instance was reported to me of crows taking 40 per cent of the crop from a small field of early ripening sorghum near a roost. Most farmers and county agents interviewed thought that the over-all damage was not great. The crop is usually combined and little remains in the fields after October, when the majority of wintering crows arrive. Nevertheless, even waste grain picked up after harvest should be counted as a loss on some farms where stock are turned in to clean up such grain.  Oats were taken sparingly as waste grain in summer, autumn, and winter, and most were eaten in late winter and early spring from newly sown fields (37.2 per cent of the February diet and 72.6 per cent of the April diet). These percentages were probably high, since there is a high proportion of indigestible residues in oats. This is more than compensated for in the yearly average by the paucity of collections made in the period when consumption of oats was highest.  Fields newly sown to oats provided a major supply of food in the early spring when other food supplies had been depleted. However, no instance of damage to a stand of oats was reported to me. Aldous (1944:294) mentioned that crows fed on spring-sown oat fields in Oklahoma but suggested that they picked up only grain which was not covered.  Sunflower seeds, although not important as a food of the crows in eastern Harvey County, were a staple food of these wintering in the western part of the study area. Consumption of sunflower seeds began in September. In the latter part of December the percentage increased and many pellets were composed"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33545"],["title","Food of the Crow, Corvus brachyrhynchos Brehm, in South-central Kansas (#2)"],["body"," of sunflower seed hulls. Sunflower seeds have a high percentage of indigestible residue.  In both popular accounts and scientific studies, the economic significance of the consumption of weed seeds such as those of sunflowers by birds often has been interpreted in an oversimplified manner. It has been assumed that if crows eat several million sunflower seeds in the winter, the sunflowers growing in the farmers' fields the next year will have been reduced by the same number. However, like most annual plants, sunflowers produce a great surplus of seeds each year. Most of the seeds consumed by crows would never have a chance to grow to maturity, even if they were not eaten. Therefore this component of the crow's diet is only slightly beneficial or neutral for the farmer. The effect of crows (or of the entire bird population for that matter) upon the sunflower crop in the farmers' fields is probably slight.  Corn is one of the preferred foods of crows, but little corn was grown in the study area. Other investigators have found higher percentages elsewhere. In eastern Harvey County corn reached its highest point in December but was insignificant in the diet. In the western part of the study area it made up a larger percentage of the diet of wintering crows. The corn eaten early in the season was undoubtedly from the standing crop. However, most of that picked up in late autumn and in winter was waste grain. Since little corn was shocked and left in the fields, there was less opportunity for damage. The amount of corn pulling at planting time was not determined, since no pellets were collected then. However, the population of crows at that time was low. I received no complaints of such damage to corn nor of significant damage to the corn crop at other seasons.  There were pastures of brome grass in the area under study in eastern Harvey County, and the seeds seemed to be a preferred food, constituting a major food supply for the crows in the latter part of July and the first part of August. Having a high content of indigestible residues they probably showed up in the pellets in percentages out of proportion to their importance in the diet. They were unimportant in the diet of wintering crows in the western part of the study area. This component of brome grass in the diet was economically of little significance in the study area, although it could be of significance where brome grass seed was being harvested.  Cherries were recorded only in June and only from one family of crows in eastern Harvey County; cherry orchards are few in this area. The damage done by the crows in the cherry orchard was slight, since only a few crows fed there.  Weed seeds such as those of spurges (_Euphorbia_), ragweed, and pigweed were found in trace amounts in the diet of the crows. However, they were not preferred foods, since they were available in large quantities.  Wild fruits such as grape and pokeberry also showed up in trace amounts. Elsewhere, investigators have found wild fruit forming a major source of food in winter. However, it was not readily available in this area.  Plant fibers and seeds unidentifiable with the resources at hand formed 2.2 per cent of the residues.  It was reported to me that crows caused damage to watermelons which are extensively grown in the sandhills region but no residues of this crop were found in any pellets collected.  Insects were most important in the animal portion of the food. The economic and ecologic significance of insects in the diet of birds is often oversimplified. The effects of predation upon animal populations are complex, and predation is often a by-product of population rather than a controlling factor.  A female insect eaten before oviposition has a greater ecologic significance than one eaten after she has laid her eggs and is ready to die.  Beetles made up more than half of the insect component of the diet. Scarabaeids were readily recognizable. Other beetles were classified as predaceous or non-predaceous according to the type of mandibles found. When mandibles were lacking the occurrences were listed merely as unclassified beetles, and those made up 5.6 per cent of the yearly food residues. Predaceous beetles made up 3.3 per cent, whereas non-predaceous beetles made up only 1.3 per cent. Both were found in one-half of the collecting periods. Predaceous and non-predaceous beetles formed 1.2 per cent of the yearly food residues. This preponderance of predaceous beetle material is what might be expected from the manner in which crows feed. Many predaceous ground beetles of the family Carabidae would be found under rocks and clods and on the ground.  Beetles were a constant component of the diet in summer. They reached a peak of 48.7 per cent in the last part of July. In November the percentage declined and by December they formed only 2.5 per cent of the diet.  Scarabaeid beetles were utilized in large quantities when they were most abundant; they made up 28.7 per cent of the diet in the latter part of June. The larvae of scarabaeid beetles are destructive to wheat and alfalfa and live in the ground from one to three years before metamorphosing into adult beetles. Adults emerge from the ground from April to mid-August, the maximum flight occurring in May and June. Most of the eggs are laid from the last of May to the middle of July (Hayes, 1920:306). Afterward the adults soon die. Many of the beetles are nocturnal, but some of the more important destructive forms are diurnal (Hayes, 1918:142). Crows pick up the diurnal forms when they are active and perhaps find the nocturnal forms under clods or in burrows and eat them in ecologically significant numbers.  Crows are beneficial to the farmer insofar as they control the populations of scarabaeids and other non-predaceous beetles. However, destruction of predaceous beetles is harmful to the farmers' best interests.  Grasshoppers, second only to beetles in the insect component of the diet, are among the most destructive insects in Kansas. Eggs laid in autumn overwinter and hatch the next summer, from April to August, depending upon the species. The maximum numbers of grasshoppers are present in late summer and early autumn and they continue feeding on crops until the first killing frost. The greatest damage is caused by the destruction of the foliage of corn, wheat, and alfalfa (Smith, _et al._, 1943:126). The consumption of grasshoppers closely followed the curve of their availability, since they are a preferred food of the crow. They were picked up in small quantities even in winter. In summer they made up 6 to 10 per cent of the diet of the crows in eastern Harvey County. Through the late summer and autumn this percentage rose, until during the first half of October they made up 59.6 per cent of the diet. However, in the western part of the study area, they constituted a smaller part of the diet.  Predation upon grasshoppers, especially in summer and early autumn, benefits the farmer by helping to stabilize populations of grasshoppers. However, when grasshopper consumption was highest, in early October, many of those eaten probably already had completed their breeding cycle, and their consumption was hence of little significance economically or ecologically.  Ants were consumed only in September and October when they constituted as much as 14.9 per cent of the diet. Crows may make an entire meal from a large colony; at any rate, whenever ants were found in a pellet, they constituted a large percentage of it.  Miscellaneous insect remains constituted two-tenths of one per cent of the yearly diet. Hemipteran remains were present only in trace quantities (.5 per cent of the July 13-26 sample from eastern Harvey County).  Only a few questionable fragments from insect larvae were found in the pellets collected in the course of this study. However, as mentioned earlier, there is evidence that larvae constituted a major food supply during much of the summer.  Many investigators have found that crows feed on grubs and caterpillars (Aldous, 1944; Alexander, 1930; Lemaire, 1950; Kalmbach, 1918; Barrows and Schwarz, 1895). A number of county agents with whom I had correspondence mentioned that crows aided the farmer in this way. More investigation is required to determine the significance of crow predation upon insect larvae in this area. Most of the bone material recorded was fragmentary. Phalangeal or podial elements of rodents and various bones of rabbits were identified. The only teeth identified were those of the genus _Rattus_. Barrows and Schwarz (1895:24-25) found that small bones of mammals may be completely ground up and digested by the crow. Hence the amount of food furnished by mammals, either alive or as carrion, may be higher than my figures indicate.  Bones of birds were found in only one pellet, obtained in early July. However, few pellets were collected in the nesting season.  The eggshell occurring in the pellets probably was indicative of extensive feeding on dumping grounds, and I received no reports of eggs lost to crows on poultry farms. Such damage has been reduced to a minimum since most poultry flocks are well-housed.  The percentage of aquatic animals (fish, crayfish and snail) in the diet increased during the early autumn, as the creeks dried up in eastern Harvey County, but after mid-October declined rapidly, as all the pools were then gone.   Conclusions  The large wintering flocks of crows are important consumers of grain sorghums in south-central Kansas. In the early autumn when the crow population is building up, it damages the sorghum crop before harvest. The damage varies from year to year, being much more keenly felt in dry years when the crop is poor or in years when the crop is late. However, most of the sorghums, which are the principal item of diet of these wintering crows, are waste grain taken from the fields after harvest. Some of this waste grain taken should be counted as a loss because the farmer "]]]
