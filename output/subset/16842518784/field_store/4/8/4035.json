Such important portions of the work as the proper cutting of the throat, scalding, scraping, opening and cleaning the hog should be undertaken by someone not altogether a novice. And there is no reason why every farmer should not advantageously slaughter one or more hogs each year, supplying the family with the winter's requirements and have something left over to sell.   THE POSSIBILITIES OF PROFIT  in the intelligent curing and selling of homemade pork are suggested by the far too general custom of farmers buying their pork supplies at the stores. This custom is increasing, to say nothing of the very large number of townspeople who would be willing to buy home cured pork were it properly offered them. Probably it is not practicable that every farmer should butcher his own swine, but in nearly every neighborhood one or two farmers could do this and make good profits. The first to do so, the first to be known as having home cured pork to sell, and the first to make a reputation on it, will be the one to secure the most profit.  In the farm census of live stock, hogs are given a very important place. According to the United States census of 1890 there were on farms in this country 57,409,583 hogs. Returns covering later years place the farm census of hogs, according to compilations of _American Agriculturist_ and _Orange Judd Farmer_, recognized authorities, at 47,061,000 in 1895, 46,302,000 in 1896, and 48,934,000 in 1899. According to these authorities the average farm value of all hogs in 1899 was $4.19 per head. The government report placed the average farm price in 1894 at $5.98, in '93, $6.41, and in 1892, $4.60.   A TRAVELING PIGPEN.  It is often desirable to change the location of a pigpen, especially where a single pig is kept. It may be placed in the garden at the time when there are waste vegetables to be disposed of, or it may be penned in a grass lot. A portable pen, with an open yard attached, is seen in the accompanying illustrations. Figure 1 presents the pen, the engraving showing it so clearly that no description is needed. The yard, seen in Fig. 2, is placed with the open space next to the door of the pen, so that the pig can go in and out freely. The yard is attached to the pen by hooks and staples, and both of them are provided with handles, by which they can be lifted and carried from place to place. Both the yard and pen should be floored, to prevent the pig from tearing up the ground. The floors should be raised a few inches from the ground, that they may be kept dry and made durable.  [Illustration: FIG. 1. PORTABLE PEN.]  [Illustration: FIG. 2. YARD ATTACHMENT.]     CHAPTER II.  FINISHING OFF HOGS FOR BACON.   The general subject of feeding and fattening hogs it is not necessary here to discuss. It will suffice to point out the advisability of using such rations as will finish off the swine in a manner best fitted to produce a good bacon hog. An important point is to feed a proper proportion of flesh-forming ration rather than one which will serve to develop fat at the expense of lean. The proper proportion of these will best subserve the interest of the farmer, whether he is finishing off swine for family use or for supplying the market with home cured bacon. A diet composed largely of protein (albuminoids) results in an increased proportion of lean meat in the carcass. On the other hand, a ration made up chiefly of feeds which are high in starchy elements, known as carbohydrates, yields very largely in fat (lard). A most comprehensive chart showing the relative values of various fodders and feeding stuffs has been prepared by Herbert Myrick, editor of _American Agriculturist_, and will afford a good many valuable hints to the farmer who wishes to feed his swine intelligently. This points out the fact that such feeds as oats, barley, cowpea hay, shorts, red clover hay and whole cottonseed are especially rich in flesh-forming properties.  Corn, which is rich in starch, is a great fat producer and should not be fed too freely in finishing off hogs for the best class of bacon. In addition to the important muscle-producing feeds noted above, there are others rich in protein, such as bran, skim milk, buttermilk, etc. While corn is naturally the standby of all swine growers, the rations for bacon purposes should include these muscle-producing feeds in order to bring the best results. If lean, juicy meat is desired, these muscle forming foods should be continued to the close. In order to get   JUST THE QUALITY OF BACON THAT IS WANTED,  feeders must so arrange the ration that it will contain a maximum of muscle and a minimum of fat. This gives the sweet flavor and streaked meat which is the secret of the popularity of the Irish and Danish bacon. Our American meats are as a rule heavy, rich in fat and in marked contrast with the light, mild, sweet flavored pork well streaked with lean, found so generally in the English market and cured primarily in Ireland and Denmark. What is wanted is a long, lean, smooth, bacon hog something after the Irish hog. Here is a hint for our American farmers.  England can justly boast of her hams and bacon, but for sweet, tender, lean pork the Normandy hogs probably have no superior in the world. They are fed largely on meat-producing food, as milk, peas, barley, rye and wheat bran. They are not fed on corn meal alone. They are slaughtered at about six months. The bristles are burned off by laying the carcass on straw and setting it on fire. Though the carcasses come out black, they are scraped white and clean, and dressed perfectly while warm. It is believed that hogs thus dressed keep better and that the meat is sweeter.   SELF-CLOSING DOOR FOR PIGPEN.  Neither winter snows nor the spring and summer rains should be allowed to beat into a pigpen. But the difficulty is to have a door that will shut itself and can be opened by the animals whenever they desire. The engraving, Fig. 3, shows a door of this kind that can be applied to any pen, at least any to which a door can be affixed at all. It is hung on hooks and staples to the lintel of the doorway, and swinging either way allows the inmates of the pen to go out or in, as they please,--closing automatically. If the door is intended to fit closely, leather strips two inches wide should be nailed around the frame of the doorway, then as the door closes it presses tightly against these strips.  [Illustration: FIG. 3. AUTOMATIC DOOR.]   A HOG-FEEDING CONVENIENCE.  The usual hog's trough and the usual method of getting food into it are conducive to a perturbed state of mind on the part of the feeder, because the hog is accustomed to get bodily into the trough, where he is likely to receive a goodly portion of his breakfast or dinner upon the top of his head. The ordinary trough too, is difficult to clean out for a similar reason--the pig usually standing in it. The diagram shown herewith, Fig. 4 gives a suggestion for a trough that overcomes some of the difficulties mentioned, as it is easily accessible from the outside, both for pouring in food and for removing any dirt or litter that may be in it. The accompanying sketch so plainly shows the construction that detailed description does not appear to be necessary.  [Illustration: FIG. 4. PROTECTED TROUGH.]     CHAPTER III.  SLAUGHTERING.   Whatever may be said as to the most humane modes of putting to death domestic animals intended for food, butchering with the knife, all things considered, is the best method to pursue with the hog. The hog should be bled thoroughly when it is killed. Butchering by which the heart is pierced or the main artery leading from it severed, does this in the most effectual way, ridding the matter of the largest percentage of blood, and leaving it in the best condition for curing and keeping well. The very best bacon cannot be made of meat that has not been thoroughly freed from blood, and this is a fact that should be well remembered. Expert butchers, who know how to seize and hold the hog and insert the knife at the proper place, are quickly through with the job, and often before the knife can be withdrawn from the incision, the blood will spurt out in a stream and insensibility and death will speedily ensue. It is easy, however, for a novice to make a botch of it; hence the importance that none but an expert be given a knife for this delicate operation.  There are some readily made devices by which one man at killing time may do as much as three or four, and with one helper a dozen hogs may be made into finished pork between breakfast and dinner, and without any excitement or worry or hard work. It is supposed that the hogs are in a pen or pens, where they may be easily roped by a noose around one hind leg. This being done, the animal is led to the door and guided into a box, having a slide door to shut it in. The bottom of the box is a hinged lid. As soon as the hog is safely in the box and shut in by sliding down the back door, and fastening it by a hook, the box is turned over, bringing the hog on his back. The bottom of the box is opened immediately and one man seizes a hind foot, to hold the animal, while the other sticks the hog in the usual manner. The box is turned and lifted from the hog, which, still held by the rope is moved to the dressing bench. All this may be done while the previous hog is being scalded and dressed, or the work may be so managed that as soon as one hog is hung and cleaned the next one is ready for the scalding.  [Illustration: FIG. 5. HEATING WATER IN KETTLES.]   NECESSARY AIDS.  Before the day for slaughter arrives, have everything ready for performing the work in the best manner. There may be a large boiler for scalding set in masonry with a fireplace underneath and a flue to carry off the smoke. If this is not available, a large hogshead may be utilized at the proper time. A long"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32414"],["title","Home Pork Making (#2)"],["body","ble, strong and immovable, should be fixed close to the boiler, on which the hogs are to be drawn after having been scalded, for scraping. On each side of this table scantlings should be laid in the form of an open flooring, and upon this the farmer and helpers may stand while at work, thus keeping their feet off the ground, out of the water and mud that would otherwise be disagreeable. An appreciated addition on a rainy day would be a substantial roof over this boiler and bench. This should be strong and large enough so that the hog after it is cleaned may be properly hung up. Hooks and gambrels are provided, knives are sharpened, a pile of dry wood is placed there, and everything that will be needed on the day of butchering is at hand.   HEATING WATER FOR SCALDING.  For heating scalding water and rendering lard, when one has no kettles or cauldrons ready to set in brick or stone, a simple method is to put down two forked stakes firmly, as shown in Fig. 5, lay in them a pole to support the kettles, and build a wood fire around them on the ground. A more elaborate arrangement is shown in Fig. 6, which serves not only to heat the water, but as a scalding tub as well. It is made of two-inch pine boards, six feet long and two feet wide, rounded at the ends. A heavy plate of sheet iron is nailed with wrought nails on the bottom and ends Let the iron project fully one inch on each side. The ends, being rounded, will prevent the fire from burning the woodwork. They also make it handier for dipping sheep, scalding hogs, or for taking out the boiled food. The box is set on two walls 18 inches high, and the rear end of the brickwork is built into a short chimney, affording ample draft.  [Illustration: FIG. 6. PRACTICAL HEATING AND SCALDING VAT.]     CHAPTER IV.  SCALDING AND SCRAPING.   Next comes the scalding and dressing of the carcass. Lay the hog upon the table near the boiler and let the scalders who stand ready to handle it place it in the water heated nearly to a boiling point. The scalders keep the hog in motion by turning it about in the water, and occasionally they try the bristles to see if they will come away readily. As soon as satisfied on this point, the carcass is drawn from the boiler and placed upon the bench, where it is rapidly and thoroughly scraped. The bristles or hair that grow along the back of the animal are sometimes sold to brush makers, the remainder of the hair falling beside the table and gathered up for the manure heap. The carcass must not remain too long in the hot water, as this will set the hair. In this case it will not part from the skin, and must be scraped off with sharp knives. For this reason an experienced hand should attend to the scalding. The hair all off, the carcass is hung upon the hooks, head down, nicely scraped and washed with clean water preparatory to disemboweling.  [Illustration: FIG. 7. TACKLE FOR HEAVY HOGS.]   SCALDING TUBS AND VATS.  Various devices are employed for scalding hogs, without lifting them by main force. For heavy hogs, one may use three strong poles, fastened at the top with a log chain, which supports a simple tackle, Fig. 7. A very good arrangement is shown in Fig. 8. A sled is made firm with driven stakes and covered with planks or boards. At the rear end the scalding cask is set in the ground, its upper edge on a level with the platform and inclined as much as it can be and hold sufficient water. A large, long hog is scalded one end at a time. The more the cask is inclined, the easier will be the lifting.  [Illustration: FIG. 8. SCALDING CASK ON SLED.]  A modification of the above device is shown in Fig. 9. A lever is rigged like a well sweep, using a crotched stick for the post, and a strong pole for the sweep. The iron rod on which the sweep moves must be strong and stiff. A trace chain is attached to the upper end, and if the end of the chain has a ring instead of a hook, it will be quite convenient. In use, a table is improvised, unless a strong one for the purpose is at hand, and this is set near the barrel. A noose is made with the chain about the leg of the hog, and he is soused in, going entirely under water, lifted out when the bristles start easily, and laid upon the table, while another is made ready.  [Illustration: FIG. 9. SCALDING IN A HOGSHEAD.]  Figure 10 shows a more permanent arrangement. It is a trough of plank with a sheet iron bottom, which can be set over a temporary fireplace made in the ground. The vat may be six feet long, three feet wide and two and one-half feet deep, so as to be large enough for a good-sized hog. Three ropes are fastened on one side, for the purpose of rolling the hog over into the vat and rolling it out on the other side when it is scalded. A number of slanting crosspieces are fitted in, crossing each other, so as to form a hollow bed in which the carcass lies, with the ropes under it, by which it can be moved and drawn out. These crosspieces protect the sheet iron bottom and keep the carcass from resting upon it. A large, narrow fireplace is built up in the ground, with stoned sides, and the trough is set over it. A stovepipe is fitted at one end, and room is made at the front by which wood may be supplied to the fire to heat the water. A sloping table is fitted at one side for the purpose of rolling up the carcass, when too large to handle otherwise, by means of the rope previously mentioned. On the other side is a frame made of hollowed boards set on edge, upon which the hog is scraped and cleaned. The right temperature for scalding a hog is 180 degrees, and with a thermometer there need be no fear of overscalding or a failure from the lack of sufficient heat, while the water can be kept at the right temperature by regulating the fuel under the vat. If a spot of hair is obstinate, cover it with some of the removed hair and dip on hot water. Always pull out hair and bristles; shaving any off leaves unpleasant stubs in the skin.   SINGEING PIGS.  A few years ago, \"singers\" were general favorites with a certain class of trade wanting a light bacon pig, weighing about 170 lbs., the product being exported to England for bacon purposes. Packers frequently paid a small premium for light hogs suitable for this end, but more recently the demand is in other directions. The meat of singed hogs is considered by some to possess finer flavor than that of animals the hair of which has been removed by the ordinary process. Instead of being scalded and scraped in the ordinary manner, the singeing process consists in lowering the carcass into an iron or steel box by means of a heavy chain, the receptacle having been previously heated to an exceedingly high temperature. After remaining there a very few seconds the hog is removed and upon being placed in hot water the hair comes off instantly.  An old encyclopedia, published thirty years ago, in advocating the singeing process, has this to say: \"The hog should be swealed (singed), and not scalded, as this method leaves the flesh firm and more solid. This is done by covering the hog lightly with straw, then set fire to it, renewing the fuel as it is burned away, taking care not to burn the skin. After sufficient singeing, the skin is scraped, but not washed. After cutting up, the flesh side of the cuts is rubbed with salt, which should be changed every four or five days. The flitches should also be transposed, the bottom ones at the top and the top ones at the bottom. Some use four ounces saltpetre and one pound coarse sugar or molasses for each hog. Six weeks is allowed for thus curing a hog weighing 240 lbs. The flitches before smoking are rubbed with bran or very fine sawdust and after smoking are often kept in clear, dry wood ashes or very dry sand.\"  [Illustration: FIG. 10. PERMANENT VAT FOR SCALDING.]     CHAPTER V.  DRESSING AND CUTTING.   When the carcasses have lost the animal heat they are put away till the morrow, by which time, if the weather is fairly cold, the meat is stiff and firm and in a condition to cut out better than it does when taken in its soft and pliant state. If the weather is very cold, however, and there is danger that the meat will freeze hard before morning, haste is made to cut it up the same day, or else it is put into a basement or other warm room, or a large fire made near it to prevent it from freezing. Meat that is frozen will not take salt, or keep from spoiling if salted. Salting is one of the most important of the several processes in the art of curing good bacon, and the pork should be in just the right condition for taking or absorbing the salt. Moderately cold and damp weather is the best for this.   AS THE CARCASS IS DRESSED  it is lifted by a hook at the end of a swivel lever mounted on a post and swung around to a hanging bar, placed conveniently. This bar has sliding hooks made to receive the gambrel sticks, which have a hook permanently attached to each so that the carcass is quickly removed from the swivel lever to the slide hook on the bar. The upper edge of the bar is rounded and smoothed and greased to help the hooks to slide on it. This serves to hang all the hogs on the bar until they are cooled. If four persons are employed this work may be done very quickly, as they may divide the work between them; one hog is being scalded and cleaned while another is being dressed.  [Illustration: FIG. 11. EASY METHOD OF HANGING A CARCASS.]  Divested of its coat, the carcass is washed off nicely with clean water before being disemboweled. For opening the hog, the operator needs a sharp butcher's knife, and should know how to use it with dexterity, so as not to cut the entrails. The entrails and paunch, or stomach, are first removed, care being taken not to cut any; then the liver, the \"dead ears\" removed from the heart, and the heart cut open to remove any clots of blood that it may contain. The windpipe is then slit open, and the whole together is hung upon the gambrel beside the hog or placed temporarily into a tub of"]]]
