Would it improve production of Cutter Products, Inc., or would it not?  \"Sid swears they're convinced it will. The factors, on paper, check out. But there's been no experimentation, because it involves the human personality. This thing, when used, is supposed to perform a definite personality change on the individual subjected.\"  \"How?\"  \"You know the theory of psychiatric therapy--the theory of shock treatment. The effect is some what similar, but a thousand times more effective.\"  \"What _is_ the effect?\"  \"A gradual dissolving of inferiority influences, or inhibitions, from the personality. A clear mind resulting. A healthy ego.\"  \"And?\"  \"Confidence.\"  Cutter stared at Quay's eyes, assimilating the information. \"That's all very damned nice. Now where does it fit in with Cutter Products?\"  Quay drew a notebook from his coat pocket swiftly. \"You remember that efficiency check we had made two months ago--the rating of individual departments on comparable work produced?\"  Cutter nodded.  Quay looked at his notebook. \"All administrative personnel departments showed an average of--\"  \"Thirty-six point eight less efficiency than the skilled and unskilled labor departments,\" Cutter finished.  Quay smiled slightly. He snapped the notebook shut. \"Right. So that's our personnel efficiency bug.\"  \"Christ, I've known that for twenty years,\" Cutter snapped.  \"Okay,\" Quay said quickly, alerting himself back to the serious effort. \"Now then, you'll remember we submitted this efficiency report to Babcock and Steele for analysis, and their report offered no answer, because their experience showed that you _always_ get that kind of ratio, because of personality differences. The administrative personnel show more inferiority influences per man, thus less confidence, thus less efficiency.\"  \"I remember all that,\" Cutter said.  \"Their report also pointed out that this inevitable loss of efficiency is leveled out, by proportionately smaller wage compensation. The administrative personnel gets approximately twenty-five percent less compensation than the skilled labor personnel, and the remaining eleven point eight percent loss of efficiency is made up by the more highly efficient unskilled labor receiving approximately the same compensation as the administrative personnel.\"  \"I remember all that nonsense, too,\" Cutter reddened faintly with a sudden anger. He did not believe the statistics were nonsense, only that you should expect to write off a thirty-six point eight efficiency loss on the basis of adjusted compensation. A thirty-six point eight efficiency loss was a comparable loss in profits. You never compensated a loss in profits, except by erasing that loss. \"And so this is supposed to fix it?\"  Quay's head bobbed. \"It's worth a try, it seems to me. I've talked to Sid about it extensively, and he tells me that Bolen, who's developed this thing, would be willing to install enough units to cover the entire administrative force, from the department-head level down.\"  \"How?\"  Quay motioned a hand. \"It's no larger than a slightly thick saucer. It could be put inside the chairs.\" Quay smiled faintly. \"They sit on it, you see, and--\"  Cutter was not amused. \"How much?\"  \"Nothing,\" Quay said quickly. \"Absolutely nothing. Bolen wants actual tests badly, and the Institute wouldn't do it. Snap your fingers, and give him a hundred and fifty people to work on, and it's yours to use for nothing. He'll do the installing, and he _wants_ to keep it secret. It's essential, he says, to get an accurate reaction from the subjects affected. For him it's perfect, because we're running a continuous efficiency check, and if this thing does the job like it's supposed to do it, we'll have gained the entire benefits for nothing. How can we lose?\"  Cutter stared at Quay for a moment, his mind working swiftly. \"Call Horner in on this, but nobody else. Absolutely nobody else. Tell Horner to write up a contract for this fellow to sign. Get a clause in there to the effect that this fellow, Bolen, assumes all responsibility for any effects not designated in the defining part of the contract. Fix it up so that he's entirely liable, then get it signed, and let's see what happens.\"  Quay smiled fully and stood up. \"Right, sir.\" He had done a good job, he knew. This was the sort of thing that would keep him solidly entrenched in Cutter's favor. \"Right, George,\" he said, remembering that he didn't need to call Cutter sir anymore, but he knew he wouldn't hear any more from Cutter, because Cutter was already looking over a blueprint, eyes thin and careful, mind completely adjusted to a new problem.         *       *       *       *       *  Edward Bolen called the saucer-sized disk, the Confidet. He was a thin, short, smiling man with fine brown hair which looked as though it had just been ruffled by a high wind, and he moved, Cutter noticed, with quick, but certain motions. The installing was done two nights after Cutter's lawyer, Horner, had written up the contract and gotten it signed by Bolen. Only Quay, Bolen, and Cutter were present.  Bolen fitted the disks into the base of the plastic chair cushions, and he explained, as he inserted one, then another:  \"The energy is inside each one, you see. The life of it is indefinite, and the amount of energy used is proportionate to the demand created.\"  \"What the hell do you mean by energy?\" Cutter demanded, watching the small man work.  Bolen laughed contentedly, and Quay flushed with embarrassment over anyone laughing at a question out of Cutter's lips. But Cutter did not react, only looked at Bolen, as though he could see somehow, beneath that smallness and quietness, a certain strength. Quay had seen that look on Cutter's face before, and it meant simply that Cutter would wait, analyzing expertly in the meantime, until he found his advantage. Quay wondered, if this gadget worked, how long Bolen would own the rights to it.   Cutter drove the Cadillac into Hallery Boulevard, as though the automobile were an English Austin, and just beyond the boundaries of the city, cut off into the hills, sliding into the night and the relative darkness of the exclusive, sparsely populated Green Oaks section.  Ten minutes later, his house, a massive stone structure which looked as though it had been shifted intact from the center of some medieval moat, loomed up, gray and stony, and Capra, his handyman, took over the car and drove it into the garage, while Cutter strode up the wide steps to the door.  Niels took his hat, and Mary was waiting for him in the library.  She was a rather large woman, although not fat, and when she wore high heels--which she was not prone to do, because although Cutter would not have cared, she kept trying to project into other people's minds and trying, as she said, \"Not to do anything to them, that I wouldn't want them to do to me.\"--she rose a good inch above Cutter. She was pleasant humored, and cooperative, and the one great irritant about her that annoyed Cutter, was the fact that she was not capable of meeting life wholeheartedly and with strength.  She steadily worried about other people's feelings and thoughts, so that Cutter wondered if she were capable of the slightest personal conviction. Yet that weakness was an advantage at the same time, to him, because she worked constantly toward making him happy. The house was run to his minutest liking, and the servants liked her, so that while she did not use a strong enough hand, they somehow got things done for her, and Cutter had no real complaint. Someday, he knew, he would be able to develop her into the full potential he knew she was capable of achieving, and then there wouldn't be even that one annoyance about her.  He sat down in the large, worn, leather chair, and she handed him a Scotch and water, and kissed his cheek, and then sat down opposite him in a smaller striped-satin chair.  \"Did you have a nice day, dear?\" she asked.  She was always pleasant and she always smiled at him, and she was indeed a handsome woman. They had been married but five years, and she was almost fifteen years younger than he, but they had a solid understanding. She respected his work, and she was careful with the money he allowed her, and she never forgot the Scotch and water. \"The day was all right,\" he said.  \"My goodness,\" she said, \"you worked late. Do you want dinner right away?\"  \"I had some sandwiches at the office,\" he said, drinking slowly.  \"That isn't enough,\" she said reproachfully, and he enjoyed her concern over him. \"You'd better have some nice roast beef that Andre did just perfectly. And there's some wonderful dressing that I made myself, for just a small salad.\"  He smiled finally. \"All right,\" he said. \"All right.\"  She got up and kissed him again, and he relaxed in the large chair, sipping contentedly at his drink, listening to her footsteps hurrying away, the sound another indication that she was doing something for him. He felt tired and easy. He let his mind relax with his body. The gadget, the Confidet; that was going to work, he knew. It would erase the last important bug in his operational efficiency, and then he might even expand, the way he had wanted to all along. He closed his eyes for a moment, tasting of his contentment, and then he heard the sound of his dinner being placed on the dining room table, and he stood up briskly and walked out of the library. He really was hungry, he realized. Not only hungry but, he thought, he might make love to Mary that evening.         *       *       *       *       *  The first indication that the Confidet might be working, came three weeks later, when Quay handed Cutter the report showing an efficiency increase of 3.7 percent. \"I think that should tell the story,\" Quay said elatedly.  \"Doesn't mean anything,\" Cutter said. \"Could be a thousand other factors besides that damned gimmick.\"  \"But we've never been able to "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32243"],["title","Confidence Game (#2)"],["body","more than one point five variance on the administrative checks.\"  \"The trouble with you, Quay,\" Cutter said brusquely, \"is you keep looking for miracles. You think the way to get things in this world is to hope real hard. Nothing comes easy, and I've got half a notion to get those damned silly things jerked out.\" He bent over his work, obviously finished with Quay, and Quay, deflated, paced out of the office.  Cutter smiled inside the empty office. He liked to see Quay's enthusiasm broken now and then. It took that, to mold a really good man, because that way he assumed real strength after a while. If he got knocked down and got up enough, he didn't fall apart when he hit a really tough obstacle. Cutter was not unhappy about the efficiency figures at all, and he knew as well as Quay that they were decisive.  Give it another two weeks, he thought, and if the increase was comparable, then they might have a real improvement on their hands. Those limp, jumpy creatures on the desks out there might actually start earning their keep. He was thinking about that, what it would mean to the total profit, when Lucile opened his door and he caught a glimpse of the office outside, including the clerk with the sad, frightened eyes. Even you, Linden, Cutter thought, we might even improve you.   The increase _was_ comparable after another two weeks. In fact, the efficiency figure jumped to 8.9. Quay was too excited to be knocked down this time, and Cutter was unable to suppress his own pleasure.  \"This is really it this time, George,\" Quay said. \"It really is. And here.\" He handed Cutter a set of figures. \"Here's what accounting estimates the profit to be on this eight-nine figure.\"  Cutter nodded, his eyes thinning the slightest bit. \"We won't see that for a while.\"  \"No,\" Quay said, \"but we'll see it! We'll sure as hell see it! And if it goes much higher, we'll absolutely balance out!\"  \"What does Bolen figure the top to be?\"  \"Ten percent.\"  \"Why not thirty-six point eight?\" Cutter said, his eyes bright and narrow.  Quay whistled. \"Even at ten, at the wage we're paying--\"  \"Never settle for quarters or thirds,\" Cutter said. \"Get the whole thing. Send for Bolen. I want to talk to him. And in the meantime, Bob, this is such a goddamned sweet morning, what do you say we go to lunch early?\"  Quay blinked only once, which proved his adaptability. Cutter had just asked him to lunch, as though it were their habit to lunch together regularly, when in reality, Quay had never once gone to lunch with Cutter before. Quay was quite nonchalant, however, and he said, \"Why, fine, George. I think that's a good idea.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Bolen appeared in Cutter's office the next morning, smiling, his eyes darting quickly about Cutter's desk and walls, so that Cutter felt, for a moment, that showing Bolen anything as personal as his office, was a little like letting the man look into his brain.  \"Quay tells me you've set ten percent as the top efficiency increase we can count on, Bolen.\" Cutter said it directly, to the point.  Bolen smiled, examining Cutter's hands and suit and eyes. \"That's right, Mr. Cutter.\"  \"Why?\"  Bolen placed his small hands on his lap, looked at the tapered fingers, then up again at Cutter. He kept smiling. \"It's a matter of saturation.\"  \"How in hell could ten percent more efficiency turn into saturation?\"  \"Not ten percent more efficiency,\" Bolen said quietly. \"Ten percent _effect_ on the individual who _creates_ the efficiency. Ten percent effect of that which _causes_ him to be ten percent more efficient.\"  Cutter snorted. \"Whatever the hell that damned gimmick does, it creates confidence, drive, strength, doesn't it? Isn't that what you said?\"  \"Yes,\" Bolen said politely. \"Approximately.\"  \"Can you explain to me then, how ten percent more confidence in a man is saturation?\"  Bolen studied what he was going to say carefully, smiling all the while. \"Some men,\" he said very slowly, \"are different than others, Mr. Cutter. Some men will react to personality changes as abrupt as this in different ways than others. You aren't too concerned, are you, with what those changes might already have done to any of the individuals affected?\"  \"Hell, no,\" Cutter said loudly. \"Why should I be? All I'm interested in is efficiency. Tell me about efficiency, and I'll know what you're talking about.\"  \"All right,\" Bolen said. \"We have no way of knowing right now which men have been affected more than others. All we have is an average. The average right now is eight and nine-tenths percent. But perhaps you have some workers who do not react, because they really do not suffer the lacks or compulsions or inhibitions that the Confidet is concerned with. Perhaps they are working at top efficiency right now, and no amount of further subjection to the Confidet will change them.\"  \"All right then,\" Cutter said quickly, \"we'll ferret that kind of deadwood out, and replace them!\"  \"How will you know which are deadwood?\" Bolen asked pleasantly.  \"Individual checks, of course!\"  Bolen shook his head, looking back at his tapering fingers. \"It won't necessarily work. You see, the work that these men are concerned with is not particularly demanding work, is it? And that means you want to strike a balance between capability and demand. It's the unbalance of these things that creates trouble, and in your case, the demand outweighed the capability. Now, if you get a total ten-percent increase, then you're balanced. If you go over that, you'll break the balance all over again, except that you'll have, in certain cases, capability outweighing the demand of the work.\"  \"Good,\" Cutter said. \"Any man whose capability outweighs the work he's doing will simply keep increasing his efficiency.\"  Bolen shook his head. \"No. He'll react quite the other way. He'll lose interest, because the work will no longer be a challenge, and then the efficiency will drop.\"  Cutter's jaw hardened. \"All right then. I'll move that man up, and fill his place with someone else.\"  Bolen looked at Cutter's eyes, examined them curiously. \"Some men have a great deal of latent talent, Mr. Cutter. This talent released--\"  Cutter frowned, studying Bolen carefully. Then he laughed suddenly. \"You think I might not be able to handle it?\"  \"Well, let's say that you've got a stable of gentle, quiet mares, and you turn them suddenly into thoroughbreds. You have to make allowances for that, Mr. Cutter. The same stalls, the same railings, the same stable boys might not be able to do the job anymore.\"  \"Yes,\" Cutter said, smiling without humor, \"but the _owner_ has nothing to do with stalls and railings and stable boys, only in the sense that they are subsidiary. The owner is the owner, and if he has to make a few subsidiary changes, all right. But nothing really affects the owner, no matter whether you've got gentle mares or thoroughbreds.\"  Bolen nodded, as though he had expected that exact answer. \"You are a very certain man, aren't you, Mr. Cutter?\"  \"Would I be here, in this office, heading this company, if I weren't, Bolen?\"  Bolen smiled.  Cutter straightened in his chair. \"All right, do we go on? Do we shoot for the limit?\"  Bolen chose his words carefully. \"I am interested in testing my Confidet, Mr. Cutter. This is the most important thing in the world to me. I don't recommend what you want to do. But, as long as you'll give me accurate reports on the effects of the Confidet, I'll go along with you. Providing you grant me one concession.\"  Cutter frowned.  \"I want our written contract dissolved.\"  Cutter reddened faintly. Nobody ever demanded anything of him and got it easily, but his mind turned over rapidly, judging the increase in efficiency, the increase in profits. He would not necessarily have to stop with administrative personnel. There were other departments, too, that could stand a little sharpening. Finally he nodded, reluctantly. \"All right, Bolen.\"  Bolen smiled and left quickly, and Cutter stared at his desk for a moment, tense. Then, he relaxed and the hard sternness of his face softened a bit. He put his finger on his desk calendar, and looked at a date Lucile had circled for him. He grinned, and picked up the telephone, and dialed.  \"This is George H. Cutter,\" he said to the man who answered. \"My wife's birthday is next Saturday. Do you remember that antique desk I bought her last year? Good. Well, the truth is, she uses it all the time, so this year I'd like a good chair to match it. She's just using an occasional chair right now, and...\"         *       *       *       *       *  Like everything he gave her, Mary liked his gift extremely well, and night after night, after the birthday, he came home to find her at the desk, using the chair, captaining her house and her servant staff. And the improvement was noticeable in her, almost from the first day. Within a month, he could detect a remarkable change, and for the first time, since they had been married, Mary gave a dinner for thirty people without crying just before it started.  There were other changes.  Quay brought in efficiency report after efficiency report, and by the end of three months, they had hit eighteen and seven-tenths percent increase. The administrative office was no longer the dull, listless place it had been; now it thrived and hummed like the shop below. Cutter could see the difference with his own eyes, and he could particularly see the differences in certain individuals.  Brown and Kennedy showed remarkable improvement, but it was really Harry Linden who astonished Cutter. An individual check showed a sixty-percent increase by Linden, and there was a definite change in the man's looks. He walked differently, with a quick, virile step, and the look of his face and eyes had become strong and alive. He began appearing early in the morning, ahead of the starting hour, and working late, and the only time he missed any work hours, was one afternoon, during which, Lucile"]]]
