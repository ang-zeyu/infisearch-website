I followed him out to the room. In the corner a man was sitting on the floor, smoking. He was the guard over the equipments. He belonged to an English regiment, and so did the equipments. Sam Hiscock engaged him in conversation for a few minutes. The topic he introduced was a timely one: beer. While Hiscock and the guard went to the canteen to do some research work in beverages, I took his place guarding the equipments. By the time the two returned I had managed to acquire a passable looking kit. I spent the rest of the afternoon going around among my friends and telling them what I proposed to do. At eight o'clock I joined the crowd that cheered A and B Companies as they moved away, in charge of the adjutant and the colonel. When the major called C and D Companies to attention, I fell in with my old section C Company. The lieutenant in charge of the platoon I was with saw me, but in the dusk he could not recognize my face. I was thankful for the convenient darkness; and because it was fear of his invention that caused it, I blessed the name of Count Zeppelin.  \"Where's your rifle?\" asked the lieutenant.  \"Haven't got one, sir,\" I said.  The lieutenant called the platoon sergeant. \"Sergeant,\" he snapped, \"get that man a rifle.\" The sergeant doubled back to the barracks and returned with a rifle. The lieutenant moved away, and I had just begun to congratulate myself, when disaster overtook me. The platoon was numbered off. There was one man too many, and of course I was the man. The lieutenant did not waste any time in vain controversy. He ordered me out of his platoon.  \"Where shall I go?\" I asked.  \"As far as I am concerned,\" he answered, \"you can go straight to hell.\"  I left his platoon; but when I did, I carried with me the precious rifle. The sergeant, a thorough man, had been thoughtful enough to bring with it a bayonet.  The time had now come to risk everything on one throw. I did. In the army, all orders from the commanding officer of a regiment are transmitted through the adjutant. I knew that both the colonel and the adjutant had gone an hour ago, and could not now be reached. So I walked up to Captain March, the captain of D Company, saluted, and told him that I had been ordered to join his company.  \"Ordered by whom?\" he asked.  \"By the Adjutant,\" said I, brazenly.  \"I haven't had any orders about that,\" said Captain March.  Just then, Captain O'Brien, who had been my company commander in camp, came up. I think he must have known what I was trying to do.  \"If the Adjutant said so, it's all right,\" he said, thus leaving the burden of proof on me.  \"Go ahead then,\" said Captain March; \"fall in.\"  I fell in. We formed up, and swung out of the square and along the road that led to the station. At intervals, where a street lamp threw a subdued glare, crowds cheered us; for even Aldershot, clearing house of fighting forces, had not yet ceased to thrill at the sight of men leaving for the front. Half an hour after we left the barracks, we were all safely stowed away in the train, ten men in each of the compartment coaches. Just as we were pulling out, a soldier went from coach to coach, shaking hands with all the men. He came to our coach, put his head in through the window, and shook hands with each man. I was on the inside. \"Good-by, old chap,\" he said, then gasped in astonishment. The train was just beginning to move. It was well under way when he recovered himself. \"Gallishaw,\" he shouted, \"you're under arrest.\" It was the sergeant-major of the Record Office I had quitted in London.  During war time in England, troop trains have the right of way over all others. All night our train rattled along, with only one stop. That was at Exeter where we were given a lunch supplied by the Mayoress and ladies of the town. I spent the night under the seat; for I thought the sergeant-major might telegraph to have the train searched for me. Early next morning, we shunted onto a wharf in Devonport, alongside the converted cruiser _Megantic_. Her sides were already lined with soldiers; another battalion of eleven hundred men, the Warwickshire Regiment, was aboard. As soon as our battalion had detrained, I hid behind some boxes on the pier; and when the last of the men were walking up the gangplank. I joined them. A steward handed each man a ticket, bearing the number of his berth. I received one with the rest. Since I was in uniform, the steward had no way of telling whether or not I belonged to the Newfoundlanders.  All that day the _Megantic_ stayed in port, waiting for darkness to begin the voyage. In the afternoon, we pulled out into the stream; and at sunset began threading our way between buoys, down the tortuous channel to the open sea. A couple of wicked-looking destroyers escorted us out of Devonport; but as soon as we had cleared the harbor, they steamed up and shot ahead of us. The next morning they had disappeared. The first night out I ate nothing, but the next day I managed to secure a ticket to the dining-room. With two battalions on board, there was no room on the _Megantic_ for drills; the only work we had was boat drill once a day. Each man was assigned his place in the lifeboats. At the stern of the ship a big 4.7 gun was mounted; and at various other points were placed five or six machine guns, in preparation for a possible submarine attack. In addition, we depended for escape on our speed of twenty-three to twenty-five knots.  During the boat drills, I stayed below with the Warwickshire Regiment, or, as we called them, the Warwicks. This regiment was formed of men of the regular army, who had been all through the first gruelling part of the campaign, beginning with the retreat from Mons, to the battle of the Marne. They were the remnants of \"French's contemptible little army.\" Every one of them had been wounded so seriously as to be unable to return to the front. Ordinarily they would have been discharged, but they were men whose whole lives had been spent in the army. Few of them were under forty, so they were now being sent to Khartum in the Sudan, for garrison duty. At night, I came on deck. In the submarine area ships showed no lights, so I could go around without fear of discovery. The only people I had to avoid were the officers, and the caste system of the army kept them to their own part of the ship. The men I knew would sooner cut their tongues out than inform on me.  Just before sunset of the third night out, because we passed several ships, we knew we were approaching land. At nine o'clock, we were directly opposite the Rock of Gibraltar. After we had left Gibraltar behind, all precautions were doubled; we were now in the zone of submarine operations. Ordinarily we steamed along at eighteen or nineteen knots; but the night before we fetched Malta, we zigzagged through the darkness, with engines throbbing at top speed, until the entire ship quivered and shook, and every bolt groaned in protest. With nearly three thousand lives in his care, our captain ran no risks. But the night passed without incident. The next day, at noon, we were safe in one of the fortified harbors of Malta.  After we left Malta, since I knew I could not then be sent back to England, I reported myself to the adjutant. He and the colonel were in the orderly room, as the office of a regiment is called. The sergeant-major in charge of the orderly room had been taken ill two or three days before, and the other men had been swamped by the extra rush of clerical work, incident on the departure of a regiment for the front. Perhaps this had a good deal to do with the lenient treatment I received. The adjutant came to the point at once. That is a characteristic of adjutants.  \"Gallishaw,\" he said, \"do you want to come to work here?\"  \"Yes, sir,\" I answered.  \"All right,\" he said; \"you're posted to B Company.\"  That night, it appeared in orders that \"Lance-Corporal Gallishaw has embarked with the battalion, and is posted to B Company for pay.\" The only comment the colonel made on the affair was to say to the adjutant, \"I've often heard of men leaving a ship when she is going on active service, but I've never heard of men stowing away to get there.\" Thus I went to work in the orderly room; and in the orderly room I stayed until we arrived at Alexandria, Egypt, and entrained for Cairo. At Heliopolis, on the desert near Cairo, we went into camp. There I joined my company and drilled with it, and bade good-by to the orderly room and all its works.     [Illustration: Scene at Lancashire Landing, Cape Helles]  We stayed in Egypt only ten days or so to get accustomed to the heat, and to change our heavy uniforms and hats for the light-weight duck uniforms and sun helmets, suitable for the climate on the Peninsula of Gallipoli. The heat at Heliopolis was too intense to permit of our drilling very much. In the very early morning, before the sun was really strong, we marched out a mile across the desert, skirmished about for an hour or so, and returned to camp for breakfast. The rest of the day we were free. Ordinarily we spent the morning sweltering in our marquees, saying unprintable and uncomplimentary things about the Egyptian weather. In the late afternoon and evening, we went to Cairo. About a mile from where we were camped, a street car line ran into the city. To get to it we generally rode across the desert on donkeys. Every afternoon, as soon as we had finished dinner, little native boys pestered us to hire donkeys. They were the same boys who poked their heads into our marquees each morning and implored us to buy papers. We needed no reveille in Egypt. The thing that woke us was a native yelling \"Eengaleesh paper, veera good; veera good, veera nice; fifty thousand Eengaleesh killed in the Dardanelle; veera good, veera nice.\"  About a quarter of "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/35128"],["title","Wagner : The Story of the Boy Who Wrote Little Plays (#1)"],["body","with him as the curtain goes down.                          [Illustration: No. 11]                                HANS SACHS  Nor was Wagner satisfied with making characters who were merely people just like ourselves. (For Walter and Eva are people of our kind). But there are in the operas by Richard Wagner, gods and goddesses, giants and Rhine maidens, and Nibelungs.  Many of them have strange names. These names are easy to remember because they are strange: Wotan and Donner are gods. Freia and Erda are goddesses. Fafner is a giant. Flosshilde is a Rhine daughter. Mime and Alberich are Nibelungs.                           [Illustration: No. 12]                                LOHENGRIN  Oh, they are wonderful company these gods and goddesses, and others of the company who tell their story and adventure in the operas of the Nibelungen Ring.

[Illustration: No. 13]                                SIEGFRIED  Now, as we have said, when we learn of so great a man we always wonder what sort of a boy he was. Well, when this boy was nine years old he went to a classical school. One of his teachers at least must have been very fond of him, and he must have been fond of his teacher, for when Richard Wagner was only thirteen years old he translated from Greek into German twelve books of the Odyssey for this teacher.                           [Illustration: No. 14]                             WAGNER AS A BOY  \"I intend to become a poet,\" he used to say. He read _Romeo and Juliet_ in English. Then he wrote a play in which were _Hamlet_ and _King Lear_. And there were forty-two other characters. All of these died or were killed in the fourth act and were brought back as ghosts in the fifth! He played the piano, too, and seems to have been quite as busy a boy as he was a man.  Of one composer's music he was very fond. This composer lived nearby and passed the Wagner house almost every day. Richard always ran to the window to watch him coming. This musician was the composer of _Der Freischütz_ and of _Oberon_. Can you guess his name?  This composer's father was also a musician as well as a military man.                           [Illustration: No. 15]                                  WEBER  Children will be glad to know that Wagner was very fond of animals. Here he is with a picture of one of his dogs. His favorite dogs are buried in the garden of his home at Bayreuth, where Wagner is also buried.  Wagner called his home at Bayreuth \"Wahnfried,\" which really means \"Fancy Free.\"  It is beautifully located in the heart of the old town.                           [Illustration: No. 16]                            WAGNER AND HIS DOG  Later on the boy read about the contest of _Die Meistersinger_. He was then sixteen. And he read, too, a poem called _Tannhäuser_. He kept these stories in mind until he became a man and then he wrote an opera about each.  Thus we see that we carry childhood thoughts into manhood.                           [Illustration: No. 17]  Here is a list of the operas by Richard Wagner, with their names pronounced:--      _The Fairies_ (1833).     _Das Liebesverbot_ (1836) leebes-fehr-bote.     _Rienzi_ (1842) ree-ent'-see.     _The Flying Dutchman_ (1842).     _Tannhäuser_ (1845) tan'-hoy-ser.     _Lohengrin_ (1847) lo'-en-green.     _Das Rheingold_ (1869) rhine-gold.     _Die Walküre_ (1870) dee val-kee-reh.     _Siegfried_ (1869) seeg'-freed.     _Tristan and Isolde_ (1865) e-sol'-deh.     _Die Meistersinger_ (1867).     _Die Götterdämmerung_ (1876) dee getter-day-meh-roongk.     _Parsifal_ (1882) par'-se-fal.  Wagner also wrote symphonies and a few works for chorus and orchestra, but he is so much greater as a composer of music dramas that he is known mostly for his works for the stage.
