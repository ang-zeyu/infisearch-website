ANALYSIS OF DATA   Data that are used to arrive at a systematic arrangement of the species of _Ptychohyla_ are analyzed and discussed below for the values inherent in the analysis. These data are of some value also in the recognition of species and subspecies but if employed for that purpose the data must be used in combination with the keys and the diagnoses of the individual species and subspecies.   External Morphology  Each of the external morphological characters used in the systematic treatment of _Ptychohyla_, as well as the nature of the tongue, is discussed below.  SIZE AND PROPORTIONS.--Comparisons of size and certain proportions are given in Table 1. Frogs of this genus are small; the largest specimen examined is a female of _P. euthysanota euthysanota_ having a snout-vent length of 53.3 mm. The species comprising the _Ptychohyla schmidtorum_ group are smaller; the largest specimen examined is a female of _P. schmidtorum schmidtorum_ having a snout-vent length of 38.0 mm. An analysis of the various measurements and proportions shows few constant differences. _Ptychohyla ignicolor_ differs from all of the other species in having the head slightly wider than long and the tympanum noticeably less than half the size of eye. _Ptychohyla spinipollex_ has a relatively narrow interorbital distance, approximately equal to the width of the eyelid, whereas in all of the other species that distance is much more than the width of the eyelid.  SNOUT.--All species have a blunt snout. In _P. leonhardschultzei_ and _P. ignicolor_ the snout is nearly square in lateral profile; in _P. schmidtorum_ the snout is slightly rounded above and below, and in the other species it is rounded above. _Ptychohyla leonhardschultzei_ and _P. spinipollex_ have a vertical fleshy rostral keel on the snout; in these species, because of this keel, the snout in dorsal profile is pointed. The nostrils are slightly protuberant in all species, and in _P. schmidtorum_ the internarial region is slightly depressed.  HAND.--The species in the _Ptychohyla euthysanota_ group have a vestige of web between the first and second fingers; the other fingers are about one-third webbed. Breeding males have a cluster of horny nuptial spines on the thumb. The spines are largest in _P. spinipollex_ (Fig. 1) and vary in number from 35 to 66 (average 47.4) on each thumb. In the other species of the _Ptychohyla euthysanota_ group the spines are smaller and usually more numerous; the numbers of spines on each thumb (means in parentheses) in members of this group are: _P. euthysanota euthysanota_, 44-143 (83.8); _P. euthysanota macrotympanum_, 40-110 (63.0); _P. leonhardschultzei_, 24-80 (54.7). The species in the _Ptychohyla schmidtorum_ group have no web between the first and second fingers and only a vestige of web between the other fingers. Furthermore, these species lack nuptial spines in breeding males. Like the usual horny excrescences on the thumbs of many species of frogs, the horny spines on the thumbs of members of the _Ptychohyla euthysanota_ group are seasonal in development.

Palmar views of right hands of         (A) _Ptychohyla spinipollex_ (KU 58054) and         (B) _Ptychohyla schmidtorum schmidtorum_ (KU 58043).]   Many workers have used the presence of a bifid subarticular tubercle beneath the fourth finger as a diagnostic character of certain species of hylids. Examination of the subarticular tubercles in _Ptychohyla_ reveals considerable intraspecific variation. Bifid tubercles beneath the fourth finger are found in all species except _P. ignicolor_, which is known from only two specimens. In _P. euthysanota euthysanota_ nearly 60 per cent and in _P. schmidtorum schmidtorum_ about 90 per cent of the specimens have a bifid tubercle beneath the fourth finger on one or both hands. All specimens of _P. leonhardschultzei_ have either a bifid or double tubercle beneath the fourth finger, and some have a bifid distal tubercle beneath the third finger.  FEET.--Members of the _Ptychohyla euthysanota_ group have a weak tarsal fold, whereas in the species comprising the _Ptychohyla schmidtorum_ group the tarsal fold is absent. Webbing on the foot extends to the discs of the third and fifth toes and to the base of the penultimate phalanx of the fourth toe, except in _P. ignicolor_, which has less webbing.  VENTROLATERAL GLANDS.--Breeding males develop thickened, pigmented glandular areas on the sides of the body. In living specimens of _P. schmidtorum_ and _P. ignicolor_ the glands are not readily visible, but in preservative they show as distinctive orange-colored areas. These glands are most distinct in _P. euthysanota_; in many specimens of this species the glands are elevated above the surrounding skin. The extent of the glands is variable (Fig. 2); probably this variability is due to different degrees of development in individual frogs rather than to interspecific differences. All _Ptychohyla ignicolor_ and some _P. schmidtorum chamulae_ have a small, round glandular area on the chin; to my knowledge this does not occur in the other species. Superficial examination of microscopic preparations of the glands reveals no histological differences between species. The glands occupy most of the thickened area and have narrow ducts leading to the exterior. Detailed studies of the histology will be reported elsewhere. Since the glands are developed only in breeding males, it is surmised that the glands are associated with some phase of the breeding activity.     [Illustration: FIG. 2. Normal extent of ventrolateral glands in         (A) _Ptychohyla euthysanota euthysanota_ (KU 58008),         (B) _Ptychohyla schmidtorum schmidtorum_ (KU 58037), and         (C) _Ptychohyla ignicolor_ (UMMZ 119603).]   TONGUE.--The shape of the tongue varies intraspecifically. Usually the tongue is ovoid; in some specimens it is barely notched posteriorly, whereas in others it is deeply notched, making the tongue cordiform. Deeply notched cordiform tongues are found in _P. leonhardschultzei_ and _P. schmidtorum_; with the exception of these two species, some individuals of all species have emarginate tongues. Some individuals of all species have tongues that are shallowly notched posteriorly.    Color and Pattern  The dorsum in living frogs of the genus _Ptychohyla_ is primarily yellowish or reddish brown, except in _P. schmidtorum chamulae_ and _P. ignicolor_ in which it is green. Usually there are some darker blotches or reticulations on the dorsum. The venter usually is white; in _P. ignicolor_ it is yellow. The venter is spotted in all members of the _Ptychohyla euthysanota_ group; the species, arranged from least to most spotting ventrally, are: _P."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/35413"],["title","A Review of the Middle American Tree Frogs of the Genus Ptychohyla (#2)"],["body","euthysanota_, _P. euthysanota macrotympanum_, _P. leonhardschultzei_, and _P. spinipollex_. The last two species also have bold dark spots on the flanks. _Ptychohyla schmidtorum_ lacks spots on the venter, whereas _P. ignicolor_ has small dark flecks ventrally.  _Ptychohyla euthysanota_ and _P. schmidtorum_ have white stripes on the upper lips and on the flanks. All species have some form of a pale stripe above the anus and usually rather distinct white or pale stripes along the ventrolateral edges of the tarsi and forearms. There are no bright or boldly marked flash-colors (colors that are revealed only when the hind limbs are extended), except in _P. ignicolor_, which has bright red flash-colors in the groin and on the thighs. In life the iris varies from several different shades of bronze color to deep red in _P. schmidtorum schmidtorum_.  The degree of metachrosis is moderate. Usually any change of color in life consists only of change in the intensity of color. At times when the over-all coloration is darkened some markings are obscured.    Osteology  The following description of the skull, hyoid, sternum, and prepollex is based on a male specimen of _P. spinipollex_ (KU 68632) that has been cleared and stained. The broad, flat skull (Fig. 3) has a large frontoparietal fontanelle. The ethmoid is large and has a flange laterally. The nasals are of moderate size and in broad contact with the ethmoid, but are separated from one another medially. The anterior half of the maxillary bears a thin, high flange. The anterior process of the squamosal is short and widely separated from the maxillary. The quadratojugal is a small spine-shaped element projecting anteriorly from the ventral base of the quadrate; the quadratojugal does not articulate with the maxillary.     [Illustration: FIG. 3. Dorsal aspect of skull of _Ptychohyla         spinipollex_ (KU 68632). Arrow indicates reduced         quadratojugal.]   The posteromedian part of the hyoid plate is calcified; from this plate the long bony, posterior cornua (thyrohyales) extend posterolaterally.  The omosternum is calcified, widest anteriorly, and has a convex anterior edge. The calcified xiphisternum is roughly bell-shaped having short lateral processes anteriorly and a deep notch posteriorly.  The swollen thumb is supported by a dorsoventrally flattened spine that does not extrude through the skin.  VARIATION.--In general, the skull varies little. Usually the quadratojugal is present only as a short element attached to the quadrate, but in one specimen of _P. spinipollex_ the quadratojugal articulates with the maxillary and forms a complete quadratojugal-maxillary arch on each side of the skull. One specimen of _P. leonhardschultzei_ has a complete arch on one side and an incomplete arch on the other.  Only _P. spinipollex_ has lateral processes anteriorly on the xiphisternum; in the other species the xiphisternum is deeply bell-shaped.  _Ptychohyla schmidtorum_ and _P. ignicolor_ have slightly longer premaxillaries than the other species. The longer premaxillary is reflected in the larger number of teeth on the bone--9 to 11 (average 10) in four specimens of _P. schmidtorum_ and 10 teeth in one _P. ignicolor_, as compared with 6 to 10 (average 7.9) in seven specimens of the other species. The number of maxillary teeth in the various species are: _P. euthysanota euthysanota_, 43; _P. euthysanota macrotympanum_, 38; _P. leonhardschultzei_, 38 and 40; _P. spinipollex_, 34 and 40; _P. schmidtorum schmidtorum_, 37 and 43; _P. schmidtorum chamulae_, 40 and 41; _P. ignicolor_, 43. The teeth on the premaxillary and anterior part of the maxillary are long, pointed, and terminally curved backwards. Posteriorly on the maxillary the teeth become progressively shorter and blunter.  Variation in number of vomerine teeth is shown in Table 1.     [Illustration: FIG. 4. Tadpoles of the _Ptychohyla euthysanota_ group:         (A) _P. euthysanota euthysanota_ (KU 60042),         (B) _P. euthysanota macrotympanum_ (KU 60049),         (C) _P. leonhardschultzei_ (KU 68556), and         (D) _P. spinipollex_ (KU 60053).]   Tadpoles  Tadpoles of the genus _Ptychohyla_ are adapted to live in mountain streams. The bodies are streamlined, and the tails are long and have low fins (Figs. 4 and 5). The mouths are large and directed ventrally. Tadpoles of the two groups of species have strikingly different mouthparts.     [Illustration: FIG. 5. Tadpoles of         (A) _Ptychohyla schmidtorum schmidtorum_ (KU 60051),         (B) _P. schmidtorum chamulae_ (KU 58199), and         (C) _P. ignicolor_ (KU 71716).]   Lips of tadpoles of the _Ptychohyla euthysanota_ group (Fig. 6 A-D) are folded laterally; there are 4/6 or sometimes 4/7 tooth-rows. A lateral \"wing\" projects on either side of the upper beak. The beaks have blunt, peglike serrations. Lips of tadpoles of the _Ptychohyla schmidtorum_ group (Fig. 6 E-G) are greatly expanded and form a funnel-shaped disc; there are 3/3 short tooth-rows. There is no lateral projection or \"wing\" on either side of the upper beak. The beaks have long, pointed serrations.    [Illustration: FIG. 6. Mouthparts of tadpoles of _Ptychohyla_:         (A) _P. euthysanota euthysanota_ (KU 60042),         (B) _P. euthysanota macrotympanum_ (KU 60049),         (C) _P. leonhardschultzei_ (KU 68556),         (D) _P. spinipollex_ (KU 60053),         (E) _P. schmidtorum schmidtorum_ (KU60051),         (F) _P. schmidtorum chamulae_ (KU 58199), and         (G) _P. ignicolor_ (KU 71716). × 10.]  Variation in certain structural details and in coloration is discussed for each species and subspecies in the systematic accounts that follow. Sizes, proportions, and numbers of tooth-rows are tabulated in Table 2.   TABLE 2.--COMPARISON OF CERTAIN LARVAL CHARACTERS IN THE SPECIES OF PTYCHOHYLA.

A small tadpole of _P. euthysanota euthysanota_ has six lower rows and three fully developed upper rows and only the beginning of the first (outer) upper row. A small tadpole of _P. euthysanota macrotympanum_ has four upper rows and five lower rows. In a small tadpole of _P. leonhardschultzei_ the three upper and four lower tooth-rows are well developed; the first upper and fifth lower rows are beginning to develop, and the sixth lower row is absent. In small tadpoles of _P. spinipollex_, the sixth lower row is poorly developed, and the seventh row is absent; large individuals normally have seven lower rows. A small tadpole of _P. schmidtorum chamulae_ has 3/2 tooth-rows.    Breeding Call  Breeding calls of all species and subspecies of _Ptychohyla_ were recorded in the field. Obtaining series of calls of _Ptychohyla_ is difficult because these frogs call mostly from vegetation along roaring mountain streams and only by locating a calling frog some distance from the water or along a quiet stretch of the stream can good recordings be obtained. For example, four individuals of _P. spinipollex_ were recorded, but only one recording was sufficiently free of background noise to be analyzed.  Analysis of breeding calls supports the division of the genus _Ptychohyla_ into two groups of species. The call of each member of the _Ptychohyla euthysanota_ group consists of a single long note, whereas the call of species in the _Ptychohyla schmidtorum_ group consists of a series of short notes. Since no differences were found between the calls of subspecies of any given species, the following discussion of breeding calls pertains to species. These calls are described briefly below and at greater length in the systematic accounts farther on. Audiospectrographs of the breeding calls are shown in Plate 11, and comparisons of the characteristics of the calls are given in Table 3.
