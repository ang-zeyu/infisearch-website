So a poor ghost, beside his misty streams,  Is haunted by strange doubts, evasive dreams,    Hints of a pre-Lethean life, of men,  Stars, rocks, and flesh, things unintelligible,    And light on waving grass, he knows not when,  And feet that ran, but where, he cannot tell.   THE PACIFIC, 1914     SONNET (_Suggested by some of the Proceedings of the Society for Psychical Research_)    Not with vain tears, when we're beyond the sun,    We'll beat on the substantial doors, nor tread    Those dusty high-roads of the aimless dead  Plaintive for Earth; but rather turn and run  Down some close-covered by-way of the air,    Some low sweet alley between wind and wind,    Stoop under faint gleams, thread the shadows, find  Some whispering ghost-forgotten nook, and there   Spend in pure converse our eternal day;    Think each in each, immediately wise;  Learn all we lacked before; hear, know, and say    What this tumultuous body now denies;  And feel, who have laid our groping hands away;    And see, no longer blinded by our eyes.     CLOUDS    Down the blue night the unending columns press    In noiseless tumult, break and wave and flow,    Now tread the far South, or lift rounds of snow  Up to the white moon's hidden loveliness.  Some pause in their grave wandering comradeless,    And turn with profound gesture vague and slow,    As who would pray good for the world, but know  Their benediction empty as they bless.   They say that the Dead die not, but remain    Near to the rich heirs of their grief and mirth.      I think they ride the calm mid-heaven, as these,  In wise majestic melancholy train,      And watch the moon, and the still-raging seas,    And men, coming and going on the earth.   THE PACIFIC, _October_ 1913     MUTABILITY    They say there's a high windless world and strange,    Out of the wash of days and temporal tide,    Where Faith and Good, Wisdom and Truth abide,  _Ã†terna corpora_, subject to no change.  There the sure suns of these pale shadows move;    There stand the immortal ensigns of our war;    Our melting flesh fixed Beauty there, a star,  And perishing hearts, imperishable Love....   Dear, we know only that we sigh, kiss, smile;    Each kiss lasts but the kissing; and grief goes over;    Love has no habitation but the heart.  Poor straws! on the dark flood we catch awhile,    Cling, and are borne into the night apart.    The laugh dies with the lips, 'Love' with the lover.   SOUTH KENSINGTON--MAKAWELI, 1913     OTHER POEMS     THE BUSY HEART    Now that we've done our best and worst, and parted,    I would fill my mind with thoughts that will not rend.  (O heart, I do not dare go empty-hearted)    I'll think of Love in books, Love without end;  Women with child, content; and old men sleeping;    And wet strong ploughlands, scarred for certain grain;  And babes that weep, and so forget their weeping;    And the young heavens, forgetful after rain;  And evening hush, broken by homing wings;    And Song's nobility, and Wisdom holy,  That live, we dead. I would think of a thousand things,    Lovely and durable, and taste them slowly,  One after one, like tasting a sweet food.  I have need to busy my heart with quietude.     LOVE    Love is a breach in the walls, a broken gate,    Where that comes in that shall not go again;  Love sells the proud heart's citadel to Fate.    They have known shame, who love unloved. Even then,  When two mouths, thirsty each for each, find slaking,    And agony's forgot, and hushed the crying  Of credulous hearts, in heaven--such are but taking    Their own poor dreams within their arms, and lying  Each in his lonely night, each with a ghost.    Some share that night. But they know, love grows colder,  Grows false and dull, that was sweet lies at most.    Astonishment is no more in hand or shoulder,  But darkens, and dies out from kiss to kiss.  All this is love; and all love is but this.     UNFORTUNATE    Heart, you are restless as a paper scrap    That's tossed down dusty pavements by the wind;    Saying, \"She is most wise, patient and kind.  Between the small hands folded in her lap  Surely a shamed head may bow down at length,    And find forgiveness where the shadows stir  About her lips, and wisdom in her strength,    Peace in her peace. Come to her, come to her!\"...   She will not care. She'll smile to see me come,    So that I think all Heaven in flower to fold me.    She'll give me all I ask, kiss me and hold me,      And open wide upon that holy air  The gates of peace, and take my tiredness home,      Kinder than God. But, heart, she will not care.     THE CHILTERNS    Your hands, my dear, adorable,    Your lips of tenderness  --Oh, I've loved you faithfully and well,    Three years, or a bit less.    It wasn't a success.   Thank God, that's done! and I'll take the road,    Quit of my youth and you,  The Roman road to Wendover    By Tring and Lilley Hoo,    As a free man may do.   For youth goes over, the joys that fly,    The tears that follow fast;  And the dirtiest things we do must lie    Forgotten at the last;    Even Love goes past.   What's left behind I shall not find,    The splendour and the pain;  The splash of sun, the shouting wind,    And the brave sting of rain,    I may not meet again.   But the years, that take the best away,    Give something in the end;  And a better friend than love have they,    For none to mar or mend,    That have themselves to friend.   I shall desire and I shall find    The best of my desires;  The autumn road, the mellow wind    That soothes the darkening shires.    And laughter, and inn-fires.   White mist about the black hedgerows,    The slumbering Midland plain,  The silence where the clover grows,    And the dead leaves in the lane,    Certainly, these remain.   And I shall find some girl perhaps,    And a better one than you,  With eyes as wise, but kindlier,    And lips as soft, but true.    And I daresay she will do.     HOME    I came back late and tired last night    Into my little room,  To the long chair and the firelight    And comfortable gloom.   But as I entered softly in    I saw a woman there,  The line of neck and cheek and chin,    The darkness of her hair,  The form of one I did not know    Sitting in my chair.   I stood a moment fierce and still,    Watching her neck and hair.  I made a step to her; and saw    That there was no one there.   It was some trick of the firelight    That made me see her there.  It was a chance of shade and light    And the cushion in the chair.   Oh, all you happy over the earth,    That night, how could I sleep?  I lay and watched the lonely gloom;    And watched the moonlight creep  From wall to basin, round the room.    All night I could not sleep.     THE NIGHT JOURNEY    Hands and lit faces eddy to a line;    The dazed last minutes click; the clamour dies.  Beyond the great-swung arc o' the roof, divine,    Night, smoky-scarv'd, with thousand coloured eyes   Glares the imperious mystery of the way.    Thirsty for dark, you feel the long-limbed train  Throb, stretch, thrill motion, slide, pull out and sway,    Strain for the far, pause, draw to strength again....   As a man, caught by some great hour, will rise,    Slow-limbed, to meet the light or find his love;  And, breathing long, with staring sightless eyes,    Hands out, head back, agape and silent, move   Sure as a flood, smooth as a vast wind blowing;    And, gathering power and purpose as he goes,  Unstumbling, unreluctant, strong, unknowing,    Borne by a will not his, that lifts, that grows,   Sweep out to darkness, triumphing in his goal,    Out of the fire, out of the little room....  --There is an end appointed, O my soul!    Crimson and green the signals burn; the gloom   Is hung with steam's far-blowing livid streamers.    Lost into God, as lights in light, we fly,  Grown one with will, end-drunken huddled dreamers.    The white lights roar. The sounds of the world die.   And lips and laughter are forgotten things.    Speed sharpens; grows. Into the night, and on,  The strength and splendour of our purpose swings.    The lamps fade; and the stars. We are alone.     SONG    All suddenly the wind comes soft,    And Spring is here again;  And the hawthorn quickens with buds of green,    And my heart with buds of pain.   My heart all Winter lay so numb,    The earth so dead and frore,  That I never thought the Spring would come,    Or my heart wake any more.   But Winter's broken and earth has woken,    And the small birds cry again;  And the hawthorn hedge puts forth its buds,    And my heart puts forth its pain.     BEAUTY AND BEAUTY    When Beauty and Beauty meet    All naked, fair to fair,  The earth is crying-sweet,    And scattering-bright the air,  Eddying, dizzying, closing round,    With soft and drunken laughter;  Veiling all that may befall    After--after--   Where Beauty and Beauty met,    Earth's still a-tremble there,  And winds are scented yet,    And memory-soft the air,  Bosoming, folding glints of light,    And shreds of shadowy laughter;  Not the tears that fill the years    After--after--     THE WAY THAT LOVERS USE    The way that lovers use is this;    They bow, catch hands, with never a word,  And their lips meet, and they do kiss,    --So I have heard.   They queerly find some healing so,    And strange attainment in the touch;  There is a secret lovers know,    --I have read as much.   And theirs no longer joy nor smart,    Changing or ending, night or day;  But mouth to mouth, and heart on heart,    --So lovers say.     MARY AND GABRIEL    Young Mary, loitering once her garden way,  Felt a warm splendour grow in the April day,  As wine that blushes water through.

Sorex obscurus obscurus Merriam  Dusky Shrew      _Sorex obscurus_ Merriam, N. Amer. Fauna, 10:72, December 31, 1895.   (Type from near Timber Creek, altitude 8200 ft., Salmon River   Mountains, now Lemhi Mountains, 10 miles west of Junction, Lemhi   County, Idaho.)  _Specimens examined._--Total 12, as follows: _Yukon Territory_: McIntyre Creek, 2250 ft., 3 mi. NW Whitehorse, 1; SW end Dezadeash Lake, 2; 1Â½ mi. S and 3 mi. E Dalton Post, 2500 ft., 1. _British Columbia_: Stonehouse Creek, 5Â½ mi. W jct. Stonehouse Creek and Kelsall River, 4; W side Mt. Glave, 4000 ft., 14 mi. S and 2 mi. E Kelsall Lake, 1; Hot Springs, 3 mi. WNW jct. Trout River and Liard River, 1. _Alberta_: Assineau River, 1920 ft., 10 mi. E and 1 mi. N Kinuso, 2.  _Remarks._--Some of the shrews taken in extreme southwestern Yukon Territory (1Â½ miles south and 3 miles east of Dalton Post) and in extreme northwestern British Columbia (Stonehouse Creek and Mt. Glave) show evidence of intergradation with the coastal subspecies, _S. o. alascensis_, in length of hind foot. These individuals have a long hind foot (14 and 15); the hind feet of specimens from the other localities listed measure 13 and 14.  Alcorn, like Rand (1944:35), found the dusky shrew to be less common than the cinereous shrew; both were taken in the same trap lines. The dusky shrew was taken at a higher altitude (4000 feet, on Mt. Glave) than the cinereous shrew.   Sorex obscurus shumaginensis Merriam  Dusky Shrew      _Sorex alascensis shumaginensis_ Merriam, Proc. Washington Acad.   Sci., 2:18, March 14, 1900. (Type from Popof Island, Shumagin   Islands, Alaska.)      _Sorex obscurus shumaginensis_ J. A. Allen, Bull. Amer. Mus. Nat.   Hist, 16:228, July 12, 1902.  _Specimens examined._--Total 3, as follows: _Alaska_: 1 mi. NE Anchorage, 100 ft., 1; Glenn Highway, 6 mi. WSW Snowshoe Lake, 2.  _Remarks._--These three shrews, in comparison with those referred to _S. o. obscurus_, are paler, and the one complete skull has a slightly higher braincase. All of the specimens were obtained in grassy areas adjacent to the roadway.   Sorex obscurus alascensis Merriam  Dusky Shrew      _Sorex obscurus alascensis_ Merriam, N. Amer. Fauna, 10:76,   December 31, 1895. (Type from Yakutat, Alaska.)  _Specimens examined._--Total 22, as follows: _Alaska_: E side Chilkat River, 100 ft., 9 mi. W and 4 mi. N Haines, 12; 1 mi.

Fauna,   10:92, December 31, 1895.  _Specimens examined._--Total 20, as follows: _Alaska_: E side Chilkat River, 100 ft., 9 mi. W and 4 mi. N Haines, 2. _Yukon Territory_: McIntyre Creek, 2250 ft., 3 mi. NW Whitehorse, 11; SW end Dezadeash Lake, 2; 1Â½ mi. S and 3 mi. E Dalton Post, 2500 ft., 3. _British Columbia_: Stonehouse Creek, 5Â½ mi. W jct. Stonehouse Creek and Kelsall River, 2.  _Remarks._--Those males with worn teeth seem to have a slightly longer and deeper rostrum with a larger, more inflated cranium than specimens of _S. p. navigator_ from Washington, but in other ways resemble typical _S. p. navigator_. An adult male, with slightly worn teeth, from Dezadeash Lake has sagittal and lambdoidal crests. All of the water shrews were taken in July and early August and at the edge of water in traps baited with rolled oats. None of the females had embryos.   Myotis lucifugus lucifugus (LeConte)  Little Brown Bat      _Vespertilio lucifugus_ LeConte, McMurtrie's Cuvier, Animal   Kingdom, vol. 1, appendix, p. 431, 1831. (Type from Georgia;   probably the LeConte plantation, near Riceboro, Liberty County.)      _Myotis lucifugus_ Miller, N. Amer. Fauna, 13:59,   October 16, 1897.  _Specimens examined._--Thirty-eight from _British Columbia_: NE end Muncho Lake.  _Remarks._--The 38 bats were from a colony of approximately 75 individuals, found on the south side of a house. The paper was loose and had buckled in numerous places allowing room for the bats to ensconce themselves between the paper and outside wall.   Myotis lucifugus alascensis Miller  Little Brown Bat      _Myotis lucifugus alascensis_ Miller, N. Amer. Fauna, 13:63,   October 16, 1897. (Type from Sitka, Alaska.)  _Specimens examined._--One from _British Columbia_: Screw Creek, 10 mi. S and 50 mi. E Teslin.  _Remarks._--The specimen is considerably darker both above and below than either of two specimens of _M. l. alascensis_ from Red Bluff Bay, Alaska. Alcorn searched ten frame buildings in an abandoned camp on the east side of Screw Creek, for bats and found only the one bat. It was above some droppings. No droppings were found in other buildings.   Ochotona collaris (Nelson)  Collared Pika      _Lagomys collaris_ Nelson, Proc. Biol. Soc. Washington, 8:117,   December 21, 1893. (Type from near head of Tanana River, about   200 miles south of Fort Yukon, Alaska.)      [_Ochotona_] _collaris_ Trouessart, Catal. Mamm. viv. foss.,   p. 648, 1897.  _Specimens examined._--Total 14, as follows: _British Columbia_: Stonehouse Creek, 5Â½ mi. W jct. Stonehouse Creek and Kelsall River, 1; W side Mt. Glave, 4000 ft., 14 mi. S and 2 mi. E Kelsall Lake, 13.  _Remarks._--In comparing specimens obtained by Alcorn with published descriptions of _O. collaris_ in Howell (1924:35), it appeared that measurable geographic variation might be present in this monotypic species. Accordingly, comparisons were made with materials in the Biological Surveys collection of the U. S. National Museum, the Provincial Museum, Victoria, B. C., and the National Museum of Canada. A comparison of specimens of similar ages showed that no subspecific separation is justified although animals from the Yukon Territory, British Columbia, and Northwest Territories, as compared with available material from Alaska, tend to be grayer in color and longer in total length with a slightly larger skull and greater alveolar length of molariform tooth-row in both upper and lower jaws.  Specimens used for comparison were from the following localities: _Alaska_: Mts. near Eagle (USBS), 15; 200 mi. S Fort Yukon (USBS), 2; Upper Little Delta River, Glacier Creek, Mt. Hayes region (USBS), 1; Glacier Creek, Mt. Hayes region (USBS), 3; Little Delta River, Slate Creek, Red Mt. Camp, Mt. Hayes region (USBS), 1; Muldron Glacier, Mt. McKinley (USBS), 2; Mt. McKinley (USBS), 3; Summit of Chugach Mts., on Richardson Highway, N of Valdez (USBS), 1; Chitina River Glacier (Nat. Mus. Canada), 3. _Yukon Territory_: McMillan Pass, Canol Road, mile 282 (Nat. Mus. Canada), 2; Rose River, Canol Road, mile 95 (Nat. Mus. Canada), 8; Tepee Lake (Nat. Mus. Canada), 1; Conrad (Nat. Mus. Canada), 1; near Teslin Lake (Nat. Mus. Canada), 1. _Northwest Territories_: headwaters of Caracajou River, Canol Road, mile 111E (Nat. Mus. Canada), 1. _British Columbia_: White Mt., Moose Arm, Tagish Lake, Atlin (Prov. Mus., Victoria, B.C.), 2.   Lepus americanus macfarlani Merriam  Varying Hare      _Lepus americanus macfarlani_ Merriam, Proc. Washington Acad. Sci.,   2:30, March 14, 1900. (Type from Fort Anderson, near mouth of   Anderson River, Mackenzie, Canada.)  _Specimens examined._--Total 3, as follows: _Yukon Territory_: W side Lewes River, 2150 ft., 2 mi. S Whitehorse, 1; 5 mi. W Teslin River, 2400 ft., 16 mi. S and 53 mi. E Whitehorse, 1. _British Columbia_: 14 mi. N Fort Halkett, W side Smith River, 1.  _Remarks._--Alcorn reports seeing few hares on his two trips to Alaska. Near the Miniker River, a geologist told him that the numbers of these animals had steadily declined since 1943. One of three seen in a spruce forest on July 8, 1947, near Whitehorse was taken by Alcorn. A young one was captured in a rat trap in a building near the Teslin River on July 5 of the same year.   Tamiasciurus hudsonicus columbiensis A. H. Howell  Red Squirrel      _Tamiasciurus hudsonicus columbiensis_ A. H. Howell, Proc. Biol.   Soc. Washington, 49:135, August 22, 1936. (Type from Raspberry   Creek, about 30 mi. SE of Telegraph Creek, northern British Columbia.)  _Specimens examined._--Total 18, as follows: _Yukon Territory_: McIntyre Creek, 2250 ft., 3 mi. NW Whitehorse, 1; W side Lewes River, 2150 ft., 2 mi. SW Whitehorse, 1; 2 mi. W Teslin River, 2400 ft., 16 mi. E Whitehorse, 1. _British Columbia_: 1 mi. NW jct. Irons Creek and Liard River, 1; Â¼ mi. S jct. Trout River and Liard River, 3; S side Toad River, 10 mi. S and 21 mi. E Muncho Lake, 3; Summit Pass, 4200 ft., 10 mi. S and 70 mi. W Fort Nelson, 8.  _Remarks._--Rand (1944:42) experienced difficulty in assigning subspecific names to red squirrels taken along the Alaska Highway in northern British Columbia. Some variability as found by Rand is noted in adults taken by Alcorn in this area. All of the specimens assigned to _T. h. columbiensis_ have a darker tail and more tawny feet than _T. h. preblei_. The average of skulls of adults is smaller than the skull of an adult of _T. h. preblei_ from Yerrick Creek, Alaska.  Alcorn obtained most of the squirrels in rat traps and steel traps, using \"chewed\" rolled oats as well as bits of fish and mouse bodies as bait.   Tamiasciurus hudsonicus petulans (Osgood)  Red Squirrel      _Sciurus hudsonicus petulans_ Osgood, N. Amer. Fauna, 19:27,   October 6, 1900. (Type from Glacier, White Pass, Alaska.)      _T[amiasciurus]. hudsonicus petulans_ A. H. Howell, Proc. Biol.   Soc. Washington, 49:136, August 22, 1936.  _Specimens examined._--Total 7, as follows: _Alaska_: 1 mi. S Haines, 5 ft., 2. _Yukon Territory_: SW end Dezadeash Lake, 1; 1Â½ mi. E Tatshenshini River, 1Â½mi. S and 3 mi. E Dalton Post, 4.  _Remarks._--Specimens from extreme southwestern Yukon Territory"]]]
