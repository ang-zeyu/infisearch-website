For example, in some specimens from Cumbres de Acultzingo, Veracruz, the mottling on the flanks is bold; in others the flanks are reticulated. The specimen from San Vicente, Oaxaca, has black dashes on the flanks (Smith and Williams, 1963:23), whereas a specimen from Cerro San Felipe, Oaxaca, has no pattern on the flanks. In general, specimens from western México have reticulate mottling on the flanks as compared with the marbling on the flanks in specimens from eastern México. On the basis of available data, the recognition of subspecies in _Hyla bistincta_ is unwarranted.  The tadpoles of this species described by Duellman (1961:47) are like those of _Hyla robertsorum_ in having 2/3 tooth-rows, peglike serrations on the beaks, and long, rounded tails. At Uruapan tadpoles were found in a rocky stream on April 24, 1956, and metamorphosing young were found there on August 2, 1956. A completely metamorphosed juvenile has a snout-vent length of 24.8 mm.  _Hyla bistincta_ is found only along streams, where individuals can be seen clinging to vines and other vegetation closely over-hanging fast-moving parts of the stream.  _Distribution._--_Hyla bistincta_ occurs at elevations from 1400 to 2600 meters in the mountains of the Sierra Madre Occidental in western Jalisco southward through the Cordillera Volcánica in Michoacán, México, and Morelos, the Sierra de Coalcomán in Michoacán, and the Sierra Madre del Sur in Guerrero and Oaxaca, and thence northward in the Sierra Madre Oriental to central Veracruz (Fig. 2).

Heels overlap by about one-third length of tibia when hind limbs adpressed; tibiotarsal articulation extends to middle of eye; tarsal fold weak, extending from moderately large, flat, elliptical inner metatarsal tubercle to middle of tarsus; outer metatarsal tubercle minute, round, indistinct; subarticular tubercles round; single row of small, round supernumerary tubercles on proximal segments of each digit; toes moderately short and slender; length of toes from shortest to longest, 1-2-3-5-4, third and fifth about equal in length; toes about three-fourths webbed; web extending to base of terminal phalanx of fourth toe; discs small, about two-thirds size of those on fingers. Anal opening directed posteroventrally at middle of thighs; two transverse dermal folds above anus; short, thin anal sheath present; many small tubercles lateral and ventral to anal opening. Skin of dorsum, chin, and ventral surfaces of limbs smooth; belly moderately granular; posterior surfaces of thighs heavily granular; no thoracic fold. Tongue nearly round, shallowly notched behind, free posteriorly for about one-fourth its length; vomerine teeth, 3-4, long, situated on posteroventral edges of narrow transverse vomerine ridges between moderately large, round inner nares; no vocal slits.

Color (in life) dark green on dorsal surfaces of head, body, and limbs; darker green reticulations on back; flanks dusty white with dark olive-gray mottling; dark olive-gray stripe from nostril through eye and then to insertion of forelimb; upper lips pale green; inguinal region, anterior and posterior surfaces of thighs dark yellowish orange; ventral surfaces of tarsi and shanks, and webbing of feet dusty yellow; belly white; iris silvery gold.      [Illustration: FIG. 3. Holotype of _Hyla charadricola_     (KU 58414). × 1.5.]  _Variation._--Adult males have snout-vent lengths from 35.3 to 44.4 mm., and adult females from 43.4 to 50.9 mm. No notable variation in structure is displayed in the type series. In some individuals the dark reticulation on the dorsum is faint. Juveniles in life had dorsal colorations varying from rich brown with darker reticulations to pale green or gray with dark green reticulations. Some adults when collected were pale green with faint or no dorsal reticulations; later these individuals darkened. In all specimens the anal stripe is absent, and the flanks are heavily spotted.  _Comparisons.--Hyla charadricola_ differs from all other members of the _Hyla bistincta_ group in the following combination of characters: truncate snout, green dorsum, and absence of a thoracic fold. From other hylids that occur in the same area, _Hyla charadricola_ differs from _Hyla miotympanum_ and _H. arborescandens_, both of which are green dorsally, by having a truncate snout and longer fingers with less webbing. _Hyla eximia_, though green, has brown dorsal spots, shorter fingers, and a round snout. _Hyla robertsorum_ differs in having a round snout and brown dorsum, and _Hyla taeniopus_ is much larger, has transverse bands on the limbs, and has extensive webbing between fingers.  _Remarks._--At the type locality, a shallow rocky stream in pine forest, _Hyla charadricola_ was found beneath rocks at the edge of fast moving sections of the stream and beneath rocks in shallow riffles in the stream. Most of the frogs were in water. At night they were found sitting on rocks in the stream. _Hyla miotympanum_, which is abundant at the type locality, lives in bushes and beneath rocks along the stream but usually is not found in the riffles inhabited by _Hyla charadricola_. At Lago de Tejocotal _Hyla charadricola_ was found beneath rocks near the shore of the lake and by a stream in the pine forest. Individuals were found on low vegetation over-hanging a small stream in pine-oak forest four kilometers southwest of Tianguistengo.  Five recently metamorphosed young (KU 58424-9) found at the type locality on June 8, 1960, have snout-vent lengths of 22.4 to 24.0 (average 23.2) mm. The young are colored like the adults, except that in life the dorsum is a brighter green and the flanks are more yellow than tan and have less dark spotting than in adults.  _Distribution.--Hyla charadricola_ inhabits streams in pine and pine-oak forests at elevations of 2000 to 2300 meters in northern Puebla and eastern Hidalgo (Fig. 2).

I didn't dare use the telephone to chat with Tom in the ship, for fear I might miss an important word or phrase from our scout. So I sat and sat and strained my ears. After a while, I heard \"_Mishgashu!_\" which told me that Monroe was in the neighborhood of the other dome and was creeping toward it under cover of whatever boulders were around.  [Illustration]  And then, abruptly, I heard Monroe yell my name and there was a terrific clattering in my headphones. Radio interference! He'd been caught, and whoever had caught him had simultaneously jammed his suit transmitter with a larger transmitter from the alien dome.  Then there was silence.  After a while, I told Tom what had happened. He just said, \"Poor Monroe.\" I had a good idea of what his expression was like.  \"Look, Tom,\" I said, \"if you take off now, you still won't have anything important to tell. After capturing Monroe, whatever's in that other dome will come looking for us, I think. I'll let them get close enough for us to learn something of their appearance--at least if they're human or non-human. Any bit of information about them is important. I'll shout it up to you and you'll still be able to take off in plenty of time. All right?\"  \"You're the boss, Colonel,\" he said in a mournful voice. \"Lots of luck.\"  And then there was nothing to do but wait. There was no oxygen system in the dome yet, so I had to squeeze up a sandwich from the food compartment in my suit. I sat there, thinking about the expedition. Nine years, and all that careful secrecy, all that expenditure of money and mind-cracking research--and it had come to this. Waiting to be wiped out, in a blast from some unimaginable weapon. I understood Monroe's last request. We often felt we were so secret that our immediate superiors didn't even want us to know what we we were working on. Scientists are people--they wish for recognition, too. I was hoping the whole expedition would be written up in the history books, but it looked unpromising.         *       *       *       *       *  Two hours later, the scout ship landed near the dome. The lock opened and, from where I stood in the open door of our dome, I saw Monroe come out and walk toward me.  I alerted Tom and told him to listen carefully. \"It may be a trick--he might be drugged....\"  He didn't act drugged, though--not exactly. He pushed his way past me and sat down on a box to one side of the dome. He put his booted feet up on another, smaller box.  \"How are you, Ben?\" he asked. \"How's every little thing?\"  I grunted. \"_Well?_\" I know my voice skittered a bit.  He pretended puzzlement. \"Well _what_? Oh, I see what you mean. The other dome--you want to know who's in it. You have a right to be curious, Ben. Certainly. The leader of a top-secret expedition like this--Project Hush they call us, huh, Ben--finds another dome on the Moon. He thinks he's been the first to land on it, so naturally he wants to--\"  \"Major Monroe Gridley!\" I rapped out. \"You will come to attention and deliver your report. Now!\" Honestly, I felt my neck swelling up inside my helmet.  Monroe just leaned back against the side of the dome. \"That's the _Army_ way of doing things,\" he commented admiringly. \"Like the recruits say, there's a right way, a wrong way and an Army way. Only there are other ways, too.\" He chuckled. \"Lots of other ways.\"  \"He's off,\" I heard Tom whisper over the telephone. \"Ben, Monroe has gone and blown his stack.\"  \"They aren't extraterrestrials in the other dome, Ben,\" Monroe volunteered in a sudden burst of sanity. \"No, they're human, all right, and from Earth. Guess _where_.\"  \"I'll kill you,\" I warned him. \"I swear I'll kill you, Monroe. Where are they from--Russia, China, Argentina?\"  He grimaced. \"What's so secret about those places? Go on!--guess again.\"  I stared at him long and hard. \"The only place else--\"  \"Sure,\" he said. \"You got it, Colonel. The other dome is owned and operated by the Navy. The goddam United States Navy!\""]]]
