Henry beamed. His goatee was at its jauntiest, most confident angle. The light of triumph played in his eyes.  \"Really, Joseph, it's quite simple,\" he proclaimed. \"There are lots of rays that go through anything, you know, except maybe lead. So I just developed a special glass that translated those rays into images, instead of just using the light rays. It was easy. The only thing you have to be careful of is to focus real close, because otherwise you'll look right through the thing you want to see--\"  \"Simple!\" choked the scientist. \"Easy! Henry, I hope you kept complete notes this once.\" He raised the glasses again. Studied a signboard on the nearby road.  \"Oh, yes, I've got good notes, Joseph--\"  \"And you still need a concave eyepiece, so that the images won't reverse,\" Professor Paulsen interrupted. \"The way it works now, pictures are all right, but 'CAMELS' are spelled 'SLEMAC'.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Henry sniffed contemptuously.  \"That's nothing,\" he retorted. \"I've got it figured out already. Only it'll take a special lens, not just a concave one. Because now it doesn't just reverse letters like a mirror; it transposes them--\"  \"All right, all right!\" The professor threw up his hands in despair. \"This is one time you've invented something worth while, and you seem to have some kind of notion of how it works, for a change.\"  \"How you talk!\" Henry was suddenly cocky. He sneered. \"I always know how my inventions work--\"  His gaunt friend glowered.  \"I was afraid of this,\" he grunted. \"Give you half a compliment and there's no living with you.\" Then: \"However, I won't waste time and energy bringing you down to earth right now. The main thing is, get your notes together. I want you to show them to Major Coggleston tonight; I think maybe the army can use this invention of yours.\"  And, as Henry again raised the glasses in the direction of the nudist camp:  \"But get rid of those glasses for now. I don't want to catch you ogling blonde beauties, or any other kind. Those people in that camp put up that fence because they wanted privacy. So put those binoculars away right now. Do you understand?\"  \"Oh, all right,\" fretted Henry. \"I'll get rid of them.\"  Dinner was a thing of the past, and Major Coggleston, Professor Paulsen and Henry were settled comfortably on the front porch, enjoying the quiet of the summer evening.  \"If these glasses of yours work as well as you say they do, the Army certainly can use them,\" commented the major thoughtfully. \"Such an invention would completely revolutionize espionage and its counter-measures. Nothing would be safe! Why, a spy could stand half-a-mile from the laboratory I'm supposed to be protecting, look through the walls to the records room, and steal the formulae for our latest explosives right from under our noses, with none of us the wiser.\"  \"Yes.\" The professor nodded. \"I can see how much it would mean. That's why I had you over tonight--wanted you to have a chance to investigate.\" A pause. \"By the way, how's the work coming at the laboratory?\"  \"Better than we'd hoped for, Joe. We've got a young fellow in charge who's a genius on explosives.\" The major hesitated for a moment, then continued: \"Confidentially, I understand he's just developed a new powder that makes TNT look like something to use for loading firecrackers. It's the greatest thing in years. The Nazis and Japs would give their eye-teeth for it. It's simpler to make than gunpowder, even--\"  _Brrrnng!_  \"I'll answer,\" said Henry. He skittered inside to the telephone.  A minute later he was back.  \"It's for you, Major Coggleston.\"         *       *       *       *       *  The officer hurried to answer. When he returned, his face was tense with worry.  \"Something's wrong!\" he rapped. \"It looks like the Nazis have made a play for that formula already! I've got to get right back to the laboratory!\"  Henry and the professor still were excitedly discussing this news when, half an hour later, the 'phone rang again. This time the tall scientist answered. He returned to the porch frowning.  \"That was Coggleston,\" he reported. \"Apparently the spy didn't get the formula, but he made a clean getaway, and he killed a sentry to do it.\"  \"Oh, that's terrible!\" Henry was afire with indignation. \"Of all things! Killing a sentry--\"  \"Yes.\" The professor nodded. \"The trouble is, Coggleston says they don't have much to go on. No description, except that he was big and had red hair--\"  \"Red hair!\"  \"Yes. Red hair.\" The savant eyed Henry suspiciously. \"Why does that surprise you so?\"  \"Why ... er ... oh, it doesn't. I mean--\"  \"What do you mean?\"  \"Really, Joseph, it's nothing.\" The little man squirmed nervously, his goatee hanging guiltily to one side. \"I'm not surprised at all. Really I'm not!\"  \"Oh, you're not, aren't you?\" Professor Paulsen started across the room with grim determination, his eyes sharp. \"Well, then--\"  \"Joseph--\"  The scientist reached for his colleague's shoulder. But the shoulder slipped away. Henry dived frantically for the doorway.  \"Oh, no, you don't!\"         *       *       *       *       *  Spinning about with surprising agility, the professor's hand speared out. It stabbed home to its goal on Henry's chin with deadly aim. Caught the little man's goatee in a grip that stopped his headlong rush dead still.  \"Joseph!\" screamed Henry, his eyes filling with tears. \"Stop it! You're hurting!\"  \"And I intend to keep right on hurting until I get the truth out of you, you amoeba-brained atom!\" thundered the other. \"I can smell your lies a block away--and this is one time you're not going to get away with it! Now: tell me who the red-headed man was.\"  \"I don't know, Joseph! Really--\"  Professor Paulsen gave his colleague's chin-whiskers a savage jerk.  \"I want the truth!\" he rapped. \"Hurry up! Tell me!\" He jerked again.  \"Oh! Ow! Joseph, please! Oh, let me go! I'll tell--\"  \"You bet you'll tell!\" grated his friend. \"It's one thing to let you get away with making a fool of me. But when it comes to tampering with the United States Army--\" And then, breaking off: \"All right. Why did you jump so when I mentioned the spy was believed to have red hair?\"  \"Well....\" Henry squirmed some more. He tried hard to look dignified despite the professor's grip on his goatee, but failed miserably.  \"Out with it!\"  \"It's really nothing, Joseph--\"  \"Out with it, I say!\"  \"Ow! Joseph, stop!\" And then: \"It's just ... the man who bought my X-ray glasses had red hair--\"  \"The man who bought your X-ray glasses!\"  \"Joseph! You're hurting!\"  \"What do you mean, 'the man who bought your X-ray glasses'?\" The professor thrust his gaunt face to within an inch of Henry's, his eyes like steel gimlets. \"If you tell me you've sold those glasses, you misbegotten moron--\"  \"But Joseph!\" Henry struggled to free himself. \"You told me to get rid of them. You warned me not to use them.\"  \"I never told you to sell them! You knew I wanted to talk to Coggleston about their use to the army--\"  \"Yes, but you didn't tell me _not_ to sell them. And I had all my notes, and knew just how to make another pair, and so when the red-headed man offered me fifty dollars for them--\"  But Professor Paulsen had ceased to listen. Already he was on the telephone and calling Major Coggleston. Tersely he explained the situation.  Then:  \"Could he have gotten the formula, Ray? Was it anywhere he could see it through those devil's glasses?\" And, a moment later: \"Oh. Coggleston, I can't tell you how sorry I am--\"  \"What did he say?\" Henry demanded excitedly as the other hung up. \"Is it all right, Joseph--\"  \"No.\" The scientist shook his head, eyes dark with worry. \"Coggleston says we can be practically certain the spy got that formula. He says the man in charge was having a staff meeting of his aides, and they had it written out on a blackboard for discussion.\"  \"Joseph--\"  \"Ray's on his way over now. He wants to ask you some questions about the man's description--\"         *       *       *       *       *  Even as the words left the savant's mouth, they heard a car roar up the driveway. Major Ray Coggleston hurried in the door, a sergeant at his heels. He wasted no time on preliminaries.  \"What did he look like?\" he demanded.  \"Well, he had red hair....\"  \"Yes, yes. We know that.\"  \"He was pretty big. Almost as tall as Joseph.\"  \"Yes. Go on.\"  \"I guess he talked sort of loud.\"  \"Got it.\"  Henry hesitated. Tugged at his goatee, his face screwed with concentration.  \"Really, Major Coggleston, that's about all I can remember about him,\" he said at last.  The officer swore. He paced the floor in a frenzy of anxiety.  \"We've nothing to go on!\" he fumed. \"The description's meaningless. It could fit any one of a thousand men in this area. We don't even know where to start to hunt.\"  \"Excuse me, major--\" gulped Henry.  The military man whirled on him.  \"What is it? Have you thought of something else?\"  \"Why, about where to start to hunt--\"  \"Yes?\"  \"Why don't you try the nudist camp?\"  \"The nudist camp?\" Professor Paulsen exploded. \"Are you completely crazy, Henry? Why would a spy be in a nudist camp?\"  Henry glared back at him.  \"No, I'm not completely crazy,\" he snapped peevishly. \"And I don't know what a spy is doing in a nudist camp, but that's where he was when I sold him my glasses.\" He sniffed. \"Really, Joseph, I get awfully tired of your acting like you were the only one around here who was half smart.\"  But Major Coggleston interrupted.  \"Let's get this straight,\" he pleaded. \"Where did you meet this red-headed man? How'd you come to sell him the glasses?\"  \"Oh, that?\" Henry sniffed so hard his glasses slid down his nose. \"Why, he was one of the men who was out peeking at the nudists.\" He turned to Professor Paulsen. \"You remember, Joseph. He's the one who said I was telling the truth about my X-ray eyeglasses "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32591"],["title","Henry Horn's X-Ray Eye Glasses (#2)"],["body","able to look through the fence.\"  \"Yes, heaven preserve me, I remember!\" groaned the professor. \"But why didn't I think--\"  \"So he asked me to sell him my glasses,\" Henry continued. \"And when Joseph told me to get rid of them, I took them over to the nudist camp and sold them to him for fifty dollars.\"  \"But how'd you know he was in the nudist camp?\"  \"How?\" Henry's goatee jerked with contempt. \"How would I know anyone was there? I saw him. He was right behind the blonde with the cute--\"  \"Henry!\"  \"Oh, all right. Anyhow, he was right behind a blonde girl. I saw him when I looked through my glasses while I was showing Joseph how to use them.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Again Major Coggleston paced the floor. His face was lined with worry. He bit nervously at his lip.  \"I'll be damned if I know what to do!\" he exploded. \"I've got to find that spy. But I can hardly seize a whole nudist camp just because a red-headed man bought a pair of binoculars.\"  \"Couldn't you ask that all red-headed men be brought to the gate?\" suggested Professor Paulsen.  \"No.\" The officer shook his head. \"If the man we want is there, that would tip him off.\"  \"Excuse me, sir,\" broke in the sergeant who accompanied Major Coggleston, \"but why not just search the whole place with the men you've got detailed for guard duty? It wouldn't be much of a job.\"  The major nodded.  \"If I have to, that's just what I plan,\" he replied. \"However, there are women in that camp. Nude women. And, frankly, I don't hanker after any of the kind of publicity which undoubtedly would result from such a search. So I want to avoid it if I can.\"  \"Then what--\"  \"I'll go in alone! That's it!\" Major Coggleston straightened, suddenly decisive. \"Sergeant, go back to the laboratory and round up all but a skeleton guard. Bring them back to the nudist camp and surround it. Don't let anyone escape! Do you understand me?\"  \"Yes, sir. I am to surround the nudist camp with our men as soon as possible, leaving only a skeleton guard on the laboratory.\"  \"Right. On your way.\"  The sergeant strode out, and a moment later the car in the driveway roared to life. And back in the house, the major drew a deep breath.  \"Well, I'm off!\" he snapped. \"Wish me luck!\"  \"Wait!\" bleated Henry, his goatee waggling excitedly.  \"What's the matter?\"  \"I'm going with you!\"  \"You?\" Major Coggleston stared. \"What for?\"  Henry started in indignation at the other's tone. He drew himself to his full height and thrust his chin out aggressively.  \"'What for?'\" he mimicked. \"Hmmph! Let me ask you a question, Mister Officer: how are you going to identify the man who bought my glasses if I'm not along?\"  The major considered this. Then, at last:  \"All right. I guess you'll have to come.\"  \"Then so do I.\"  It was Professor Paulsen.  \"Joe, there's no need to talk like that,\" Major Ray Coggleston began.  \"If Henry goes, I go,\" the savant reiterated stubbornly. \"He gets in enough jams with me around to look after him. Lord knows what he'd do if he got away from me.\"         *       *       *       *       *  And so it was, ten minutes later, that the three appeared at the main gate of the Sunset Glow Nudist Colony: Let Old Sol Bring You Health. From within the fenced enclosure came the glow of firelight and the sound of festivities. A burly short-clad gateman was on duty.  \"Well?\" he demanded.  Major Coggleston displayed his credentials.  \"You've got a man in there whom we suspect of being a spy,\" he explained. \"We've got to come in and investigate.\"  The gateman hesitated and chewed his lower lip.  \"O.K.,\" he said finally. \"Ditch your clothes in the brush, over there.\"  \"Ditch our clothes!\"  \"Sure.\" The gateman nodded determinedly. \"You didn't think you could come in the way you are, did you?\"  \"But we represent the United States Government--\"  \"I don't give a damn who you represent.\" The gateman was adamant. \"If you want to enter Sunset Glow, you'll do it in bare skin or not at all.\"  The three stared from one to another. At last the major broke the silence.  \"All right,\" he snapped. \"Have it your own way. I suppose we _would_ stand out like sore thumbs if we wore clothes.\"  It took the trio but a minute to disrobe. They slipped through the gate, a strange sight: Henry, small and spindly, chin-whiskers waving animatedly; Professor Paulsen, gaunt, lean-shanked, stooped; and Major Coggleston, still strong and well-built, but with a noticeable spare tire beginning to develop around his midriff.  Inside, a great open fire was burning, with a throng of male and female nudists disporting themselves about it. Some were toasting wieners and marshmallows; other only their own epidermis. There was much laughter and good-natured raillery.  \"Joseph!\" exclaimed Henry tensely, his goatee quivering to a point like a setter's tail. \"There! See her? That blonde girl--\"  His colleague turned on him.  \"Henry Horn, I'm warning you for the last time!\" he clipped. \"We're having a hard enough time as it is, without your calling that young lady's anatomical details to our attention. So keep quiet!\"  \"Oh, all right,\" the little man sulked. \"Just because you think you're smarter than I am--\"  \"Joe! Henry!\" Major Coggleston interrupted excitedly. \"Look! That man walking off into the shadows! Hasn't he red hair?\"  The two friends shot quick glances in the direction the officer pointed.  \"That's him!\" squealed Henry, dancing about like a monkey on a stick. \"That's the man who bought my glasses!\"  \"Come on!\" The major darted forward, looking for all the world like an oversize kewpie doll. Henry and the professor followed close on his heels.         *       *       *       *       *  Ahead of them, the red-headed nudist hurried farther and farther out of the firelight and into the brush. Bushes began to slap against the three friends' faces.  \"Damn that devil!\" fumed Major Coggleston. \"I can't see him. Has he lost us?\"  \"Ouch!\" yipped Henry, close beside him. \"Oh! The mosquitoes!\"  Professor Paulsen slapped vigorously at his own anatomy.  \"They're awful!\" he agreed. Then, to his friend, the major: \"Do you see him? Where is he?\"  And from the darkness behind them a voice answered:  \"Right here I am, gentlemen! At your service, now and always!\"  As one man, the trio whirled. A burly figure loomed in the gloom.  It was the red-headed man!  \"Did you buy a pair of binoculars--\" the major began.  The other waved him down.  \"Sure, I bought 'em. And tonight I used 'em to snag onto the most important military secret I've seen in a month of Sundays. Believe me, mister, I'll make my fortune from this job!\"  \"Then you admit you're a spy?\" the officer rasped, starting to move forward. \"You admit you're the dirty dog who murdered our sentry--\"  \"Sure, sure, I admit it.\" The burly one seemed unperturbed.  \"Why, you--\"  \"Hold it!\" There was a sharp note of command in the red-headed man's voice this time. \"Don't come no closer, buddy. Not if you want to keep your health!\" He held out one ham-like hand. It gripped a heavy, bottle-shaped package.  \"I got a little private lab in my suitcase,\" the spy explained. \"When I saw how simple that formula was, I just brewed me up a batch of your new powder. Now I got it right here\"--he waved the package--\"complete with detonator. If you guys try to jump me, all I do is let go and the whole works goes off.\" He chuckled unpleasantly. \"I guess you know what happens when two pounds of that stuff lets go.\"  The three friends shrank back. Henry's teeth already were chattering like the gourds in a rumba band.  \"I guess you've got us,\" Major Coggleston said tautly. \"However, you can't go far. My men are surrounding this camp right now.\"  The red-headed man sneered.  \"Why don't you tell me something new?\" he commented caustically. \"Why'd you think I grabbed you?\"  \"What?\"  \"You didn't think you guys surprised me, did you?\" The burly one laughed. \"Hell, I saw you the second you came in.  \"The way I'd planned it, I was going to hide out in the camp, here, until the stink blew over. Then I figured on pulling a fast sneak out of the country.  \"But someone caught wise. I guess it was you\"--he nodded at the quaking Henry--\"so I had to revise things a little. I knew you'd have support coming up--Army Intelligence officers don't walk into trouble without backing except in the movies.\"         *       *       *       *       *  \"So what do you plan to do with us?\" demanded the major. \"You can see you haven't a chance to get away--\"  \"Haven't I?\"  \"The camp is surrounded.\"  \"Sure.\" Their captor was amused. \"That's why I grabbed you. The four of us are going to march out of here together. And you\"--he jerked his head toward Major Coggleston--\"are going to make your boys lay off. You'll go with me 'til I'm satisfied I'm in the clear. Then I'll turn you loose.\"  \"And if we refuse?\" grated the major.  The other shrugged.  \"O.K. by me,\" he said. \"We all blow up together.\"  There was a long moment of silence, pregnant with panic.  \"You must have a great deal of confidence in your ability as a chemist, to prepare this explosive on such short notice and with limited equipment,\" Professor Paulsen commented at last.  The red-headed man laughed.  \"Why shouldn't I have?\" he demanded. \"I may have been raised in Brooklyn, but I learned my business in Berlin, and they know how to teach there.\"  Another long silence.  \"Well, make up your mind!\" their captor grunted finally. \"We ain't got all night, you know. Do you come quiet, or do I have to blow us all to smithereens?\" He waved the package in his hand menacingly.  Major Coggleston threw up his hands in a gesture of defeat.  \"You win!\" he snapped. \"If I were alone, I'd say blow and be damned. But my friends deserve a better fate.\"  \"You're smart,\" the other reported approvingly. \"Come on!\"  Slowly, the trio moved forward.  \"Hurry up!\" grated the red-head. And then, to the professor: \"You skinny, get a move on!\"  For the gaunt savant was distinctly lagging. He had dropped back"]]]
