He lent me a book; but I don't mind saying that it was a bit above my head, though I had a good Aberdeen upbringing. He'd have made a grand meenister with his thin face and gray hair and solemn-like way of talking. When he put his hand on my shoulder as we were parting, it was like a father's blessing before you go out into the cold, cruel world.”  Holmes chuckled and rubbed his hands. “Great!” he said. “Great! Tell me, Friend MacDonald, this pleasing and touching interview was, I suppose, in the professor's study?”  “That's so.”  “A fine room, is it not?”  “Very fine--very handsome indeed, Mr. Holmes.”  “You sat in front of his writing desk?”  “Just so.”  “Sun in your eyes and his face in the shadow?”  “Well, it was evening; but I mind that the lamp was turned on my face.”  “It would be. Did you happen to observe a picture over the professor's head?”  “I don't miss much, Mr. Holmes. Maybe I learned that from you. Yes, I saw the picture--a young woman with her head on her hands, peeping at you sideways.”  “That painting was by Jean Baptiste Greuze.”  The inspector endeavoured to look interested.  “Jean Baptiste Greuze,” Holmes continued, joining his finger tips and leaning well back in his chair, “was a French artist who flourished between the years 1750 and 1800. I allude, of course to his working career. Modern criticism has more than indorsed the high opinion formed of him by his contemporaries.”  The inspector's eyes grew abstracted. “Hadn't we better--” he said.  “We are doing so,” Holmes interrupted. “All that I am saying has a very direct and vital bearing upon what you have called the Birlstone Mystery. In fact, it may in a sense be called the very centre of it.”  MacDonald smiled feebly, and looked appealingly to me. “Your thoughts move a bit too quick for me, Mr. Holmes. You leave out a link or two, and I can't get over the gap. What in the whole wide world can be the connection between this dead painting man and the affair at Birlstone?”  “All knowledge comes useful to the detective,” remarked Holmes. “Even the trivial fact that in the year 1865 a picture by Greuze entitled La Jeune Fille a l'Agneau fetched one million two hundred thousand francs--more than forty thousand pounds--at the Portalis sale may start a train of reflection in your mind.”  It was clear that it did. The inspector looked honestly interested.  “I may remind you,” Holmes continued, “that the professor's salary can be ascertained in several trustworthy books of reference. It is seven hundred a year.”  “Then how could he buy--”  “Quite so! How could he?”  “Ay, that's remarkable,” said the inspector thoughtfully. “Talk away, Mr. Holmes. I'm just loving it. It's fine!”  Holmes smiled. He was always warmed by genuine admiration--the characteristic of the real artist. “What about Birlstone?” he asked.  “We've time yet,” said the inspector, glancing at his watch. “I've a cab at the door, and it won't take us twenty minutes to Victoria. But about this picture: I thought you told me once, Mr. Holmes, that you had never met Professor Moriarty.”  “No, I never have.”  “Then how do you know about his rooms?”  “Ah, that's another matter. I have been three times in his rooms, twice waiting for him under different pretexts and leaving before he came. Once--well, I can hardly tell about the once to an official detective. It was on the last occasion that I took the liberty of running over his papers--with the most unexpected results.”  “You found something compromising?”  “Absolutely nothing. That was what amazed me. However, you have now seen the point of the picture. It shows him to be a very wealthy man. How did he acquire wealth? He is unmarried. His younger brother is a station master in the west of England. His chair is worth seven hundred a year. And he owns a Greuze.”  “Well?”  “Surely the inference is plain.”  “You mean that he has a great income and that he must earn it in an illegal fashion?”  “Exactly. Of course I have other reasons for thinking so--dozens of exiguous threads which lead vaguely up towards the centre of the web where the poisonous, motionless creature is lurking. I only mention the Greuze because it brings the matter within the range of your own observation.”  “Well, Mr. Holmes, I admit that what you say is interesting: it's more than interesting--it's just wonderful. But let us have it a little clearer if you can. Is it forgery, coining, burglary--where does the money come from?”  “Have you ever read of Jonathan Wild?”  “Well, the name has a familiar sound. Someone in a novel, was he not? I don't take much stock of detectives in novels--chaps that do things and never let you see how they do them. That's just inspiration: not business.”  “Jonathan Wild wasn't a detective, and he wasn't in a novel. He was a master criminal, and he lived last century--1750 or thereabouts.”  “Then he's no use to me. I'm a practical man.”  “Mr. Mac, the most practical thing that you ever did in your life would be to shut yourself up for three months and read twelve hours a day at the annals of crime. Everything comes in circles--even Professor Moriarty. Jonathan Wild was the hidden force of the London criminals, to whom he sold his brains and his organization on a fifteen per cent. commission. The old wheel turns, and the same spoke comes up. It's all been done before, and will be again. I'll tell you one or two things about Moriarty which may interest you.”  “You'll interest me, right enough.”  “I happen to know who is the first link in his chain--a chain with this Napoleon-gone-wrong at one end, and a hundred broken fighting men, pickpockets, blackmailers, and card sharpers at the other, with every sort of crime in between. His chief of staff is Colonel Sebastian Moran, as aloof and guarded and inaccessible to the law as himself. What do you think he pays him?”  “I'd like to hear.”  “Six thousand a year. That's paying for brains, you see--the American business principle. I learned that detail quite by chance. It's more than the Prime Minister gets. That gives you an idea of Moriarty's gains and of the scale on which he works. Another point: I made it my business to hunt down some of Moriarty's checks lately--just common innocent checks that he pays his household bills with. They were drawn on six different banks. Does that make any impression on your mind?”  “Queer, certainly! But what do you gather from it?”  “That he wanted no gossip about his wealth. No single man should know what he had. I have no doubt that he has twenty banking accounts; the bulk of his fortune abroad in the Deutsche Bank or the Credit Lyonnais as likely as not. Sometime when you have a year or two to spare I commend to you the study of Professor Moriarty.”  Inspector MacDonald had grown steadily more impressed as the conversation proceeded. He had lost himself in his interest. Now his practical Scotch intelligence brought him back with a snap to the matter in hand.  “He can keep, anyhow,” said he. “You've got us side-tracked with your interesting anecdotes, Mr. Holmes. What really counts is your remark that there is some connection between the professor and the crime. That you get from the warning received through the man Porlock. Can we for our present practical needs get any further than that?”  “We may form some conception as to the motives of the crime. It is, as I gather from your original remarks, an inexplicable, or at least an unexplained, murder. Now, presuming that the source of the crime is as we suspect it to be, there might be two different motives. In the first place, I may tell you that Moriarty rules with a rod of iron over his people. His discipline is tremendous. There is only one punishment in his code. It is death. Now we might suppose that this murdered man--this Douglas whose approaching fate was known by one of the arch-criminal's subordinates--had in some way betrayed the chief. His punishment followed, and would be known to all--if only to put the fear of death into them.”  “Well, that is one suggestion, Mr. Holmes.”  “The other is that it has been engineered by Moriarty in the ordinary course of business. Was there any robbery?”  “I have not heard.”  “If so, it would, of course, be against the first hypothesis and in favour of the second. Moriarty may have been engaged to engineer it on a promise of part spoils, or he may have been paid so much down to manage it. Either is possible. But whichever it may be, or if it is some third combination, it is down at Birlstone that we must seek the solution. I know our man too well to suppose that he has left anything up here which may lead us to him.”  “Then to Birlstone we must go!” cried MacDonald, jumping from his chair. “My word! it's later than I thought. I can give you, gentlemen, five minutes for preparation, and that is all.”  “And ample for us both,” said Holmes, as he sprang up and hastened to change from his dressing gown to his coat. “While we are on our way, Mr. Mac, I will ask you to be good enough to tell me all about it.”  “All about it” proved to be disappointingly little, and yet there was enough to assure us that the case before us might well be worthy of the expert's closest attention. He brightened and rubbed his thin hands together as he listened to the meagre but remarkable details. A long series of sterile weeks lay behind us, and here at last there was a fitting object for those remarkable powers which, like all special gifts, become irksome to their owner when they are not in use. That razor brain blunted and rusted with inaction.  Sherlock Holmes's eyes glistened, his pale cheeks took a warmer hue, and his whole eager face shone with an inward light when the call for work reached him. Leaning forward in the cab, he listened intently to MacDonald's short sketch of the problem which awaited us in Sussex.

We have them, and it can't be due to any fault but those construction men of yours.\"  \"How could it be their fault?\" I was getting a little sore.  \"Because it isn't my fault, nor my wife's. And the building, as you observed a minute ago, is practically new.\"  \"Now listen,\" I began.  \"I wish you'd come out here and see for yourself,\" Stoddard demanded.  \"Have you caught any?\"  \"No,\" he answered.  \"Have you seen any?\" I demanded.  \"No,\" Stoddard admitted, \"but--\"  This time I did the cutting in.  \"Then how do you know you have rats?\" I demanded triumphantly.  \"Because,\" Stoddard almost shouted, \"as I was going to tell you, I can hear them, and my wife can hear them.\"  I hadn't thought of that. \"Oh,\" I said. Then: \"Are you sure?\"  \"Yes, I am very sure. Now, will you please come out here and see what this is all about?\" he demanded.  \"Okay,\" I said. \"Okay.\" And then I hung up and looked around for my hat. My visit wasn't going to be any fun, I knew. But what the hell. I had to admit that if Stoddard and his wife were hearing noises that sounded like rats, they had a legitimate squawk. For I built the house, and no amount of crazy ideas in its design by Stoddard could explain the presence of vermin.         *       *       *       *       *  Both the Stoddards met me at the door when I arrived out in the Mayfair subdivision where I'd built their monstrosity. As they led me into the living room, I caught a pretty good idea of their new home furnishings. They hadn't changed ideas, even to the mixing of a wild mess of various nations and periods in the junk they'd placed all around the house.  They led me past an early American library table to a deep Moroccan style couch, and both pulled up chairs of French and Dutch design before me.  Feeling thus surrounded by a small little circle of indignation, I began turning my hat around in my hands, staring uncomfortably at my surroundings.  \"Nice place you've got here,\" I said.  \"We know that,\" Stoddard declared, dismissing banalities. \"But we'd best get immediately to the point.\"  \"About the rats?\" I asked.  \"About the rats,\" said Stoddard. His wife nodded emphatically.  There was a silence. Maybe a minute passed. I cleared my throat.  \"I thought you--\" I began.  \"Shhhh!\" Stoddard hissed. \"I want you to sit here and hear the noises, just as we have. Then you can draw your own conclusions. Silence, please.\"  So I didn't say a word, and neither did mine hosts. We sat there like delegates to a convention of mutes who were too tired to use their hands. This time the silence seemed even more ominous.  Several minutes must have passed before I began to hear the sounds. That was because I'd been listening for rat scrapings, and not prepared for the noises I actually began to hear.  Mr. and Mrs. Stoddard had their heads cocked to one side, and were staring hard at me, waiting for a sign that I was catching the sounds.  At first the noises seemed faint, blurred perhaps, like an almost inaudible spattering of radio static. Then, as I adjusted my ear to them, I began to get faint squeaks, and small, sharp noises that were like far distant poppings of small firecrackers.  I looked up at the Stoddards.  \"Okay,\" I admitted. \"I hear the noises. They seem to be coming from behind the walls, if anywhere.\"  Stoddard looked smugly triumphant.  \"I told you so,\" he smirked.  \"But they aren't rat scrapings,\" I said. \"I know the sounds rats make, and those aren't rat sounds.\"  Stoddard sat bolt upright. \"What?\" he demanded indignantly. \"Do you mean to sit there and tell me--\"  \"I do,\" I cut in. \"Ever heard rat noises?\"  Stoddard looked at his wife. Both of them frowned. He looked back at me.  \"No-o,\" he admitted slowly. \"That is, not until we got these rats. Never had rats before.\"  \"So you jumped to conclusions and thought they were rat noises,\" I said, \"even though you wouldn't recognize a rat noise if you heard one.\"  Stoddard suddenly stood up. \"But dagnabit, man!\" he exploded. \"If those aren't rat noises, what are they?\"  I shrugged. \"I don't know,\" I admitted. \"They sound as if they might be coming through the pipes. Perhaps we ought to take a look around the house, beginning with the basement, eh?\"  Stoddard considered this a minute. Then he nodded.  \"That seems reasonable enough,\" he admitted.         *       *       *       *       *  I followed the amateur designer-owner of this madhouse down into the basement. There we began our prowl for the source of the noise. He snapped on the light switch, and I had a look around. The boiler and everything else in the basement was exactly as I remembered it--in the wrong place.  There was an array of sealed tin cans, each holding about five gallons, banked around the boiler. I tapped on the sides of these and asked Stoddard what they were.  \"Naphtha,\" he explained, \"for my wife's cleaning.\"  \"Hell of a place to put them,\" I commented.  A familiar light came into Stoddard's stubborn eyes.  \"That's where I want to put them,\" he said.  I shrugged. \"Okay,\" I told him. \"But don't let the insurance people find out about it.\"  We poked around the basement some more, and finally, on finding nothing that seemed to indicate a source of the sound, we went back up to the first floor.  Our investigation of pipes and other possible sound carriers on the first floor was also fruitless, although the sounds grew slightly stronger than they'd been in the basement.  I looked at Stoddard, shrugging. \"We'd better try the second floor,\" I said.  I followed him upstairs to the second floor. Aside from the crazy belfry just above the attic, it was the top floor of the wildly constructed domicile.  The sounds were distinctly more audible up there, especially in the center bedroom. We covered the second floor twice and ended back up in that center bedroom again before I realized that we were directly beneath the attic.  I mentioned this to Stoddard.  \"We might as well look through the attic, then,\" Stoddard said.  I led the way this time as we clambered up into the attic.  \"Ever looked for your so-called rats up here?\" I called over my shoulder.  Stoddard joined me, snapping on a flashlight, spraying the beam around the attic rafters. \"No,\" he said. \"Of course not.\"  I was opening my mouth to answer, when I suddenly became aware that the noises were now definitely louder. Noises faint, but not blurred any longer. Noises which weren't really noises, but were actually voices!  I grabbed Stoddard by the arm.  \"Listen!\" I ordered.  We stood there silently for perhaps half a minute. Yes, there wasn't any question about it now. I knew that the faint sounds were those of human voices.  \"Good heavens!\" Stoddard exclaimed.  \"Rats, eh?\" I said sarcastically.  \"But, but--\" Stoddard began. He was obviously bewildered.  \"There's a sort of central pipe and wiring maze up here,\" I told him, \"due to the plans we were forced to follow in building this house of yours. Those faint voices are carried through the pipes and wires for some reason of sound vibration, and hurled up here. Just tell me where you keep your radio, and we'll solve your problem.\"  Stoddard looked at me a minute.  \"But we don't own a radio,\" he said quietly.         *       *       *       *       *  I was suddenly very much deflated.  \"Are you sure?\" I demanded.  \"Don't be silly,\" Stoddard told me.  I stood there scratching my head and feeling foolish. Then I got another idea.  \"Have you been up in that, ah, ornamental belfry since you moved in?\" I asked.  \"Of course not,\" Stoddard said. \"It's to look at. Not to peek out of.\"  \"I have a hunch the sounds might be even more audible up there,\" I said.  \"Why?\"  I scratched my head. \"Just a hunch.\"  \"Well it's a dammed fool one,\" Stoddard said. He turned around and started out of the attic. I followed behind him.  \"You have to admit you haven't rats,\" I said.  Stoddard muttered something I couldn't catch. When we got down to the first floor again, Mrs. Stoddard was waiting expectantly for our arrival.  \"Did you discover where the rats are?\" she demanded.  Stoddard shot me a glance. \"They aren't rats,\" he said with some reluctance. \"The noises, we'd swear, are faint voices and sounds of human beings moving around. Were you talking to yourself while we were upstairs, Laura?\"  Mrs. Stoddard gave her husband a surprised look. \"Who was there to talk with, George?\" she asked.  I had had about enough of this. I was damned tired of trotting around the weirdly laid out floors of the Stoddard home trying to track down rats which weren't rats but voices.  \"If there are inexplicable echoes in this building,\" I said, \"it is due to the construction. And don't forget, you wanted it this way. Now that I have proved to your satisfaction that you don't have rats, I might as well go. Good day.\"  I got my hat, and neither Stoddard nor his wife had much to say as they saw me to the door. Their accusing attitudes had vanished, however, and they both seemed even a trifle sheepish.  It was two o'clock when I left them. I'd killed better than an hour and a half prowling around the place, and another half hour driving out. I was damned disgusted by the time I got back to my office.  You can imagine my state of mind, consequently, some twenty-five minutes after I'd been back in my office, when I answered the telephone to hear Stoddard's voice coming over it.  \"Mr. Kermit,\" he babbled excitedly, \"this is George B. Stoddard again, Mr. Kermit!\"  \"What've you got now?\" I demanded. \"And don't"]]]
