He had, it was true, been formulating his ideas and arguments for several decades—since his round-the-world _Beagle_ voyage of 1831-1836. These ideas and arguments had been slow to take definitive shape; Darwin had nurtured and reworked them, amassing evidence for what he projected to be a weighty magnum opus. Although he had shared his developing evolutionary speculations with his closest professional colleagues, Darwin was reluctant to publish them on several grounds. He was aware that his theory of evolution by natural selection (or descent with modification) was complex, that it rested on vast but not incontrovertible evidence, and that the chain of his reasoning was not uniformly strong. Further, his conclusions challenged not only the scientific assumptions of many fellow specialists but also the theological convictions of a much wider circle of fellow citizens.  In 1859, Darwin did not feel quite ready to expose his cherished theory to the harsh light of public scrutiny. In the introduction to the _Origin_ he confessed that although his work on evolution by natural selection was “nearly finished,” he would need “two or three more years to complete it.” The _ Origin_ was, he suggested, merely a stopgap, a schematic “abstract” of a much longer and more fully supported treatise yet to come. He had been moved to preview his labors in this way, he explained, because his health was “far from strong” and, perhaps more importantly, because Alfred Russel Wallace, a younger naturalist working in isolation in southeast Asia, had sent a paper to the Linnean Society of London in which he “arrived at almost exactly the same general conclusions that I have on the origin of species.” If Darwin had not gone public with his theory at this point, he would have risked losing credit for the work of many years.  As its reception showed immediately and has continued to show, the _Origin_ benefited from the succinctness imposed by circumstances. Darwin himself may have appreciated this point; at any rate, he never produced the massive treatise, although he repeatedly issued revised editions of the _ Origin._ But he did not abandon his intention to buttress his initial schematic presentation with additional evidence. In the course of the next two decades he published several full-length elaborations of topics summarily discussed in the _Origin: The Variation of Animals and Plants under Domestication; The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex;_ and _The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals._ In addition to fleshing out the _Origin,_ these subsequent studies bolstered its arguments and responded to questions raised by critical readers, especially pragmatic questions about the way that descent with modification actually operated.  In _The Variation of Animals and Plants under Domestication,_ which appeared first in 1868 and in a revised edition in 1875, Darwin developed a theme to which he had accorded great rhetorical and evidentiary significance. He had begun the _ Origin_ with a description of artificial selection as practiced by farmers, stock breeders, and pet fanciers, thus using a reassuringly homely example—one recognizable by the general public as well as by members of the scientific community—to introduce the most innovative component of his evolutionary theory. In addition, domesticated animals and plants, because they were numerous and available for constant observation, provided a readily available body of evidence.  Reassuring as it was, the analogy between natural and artificial selection was far from perfect. The point of Darwin’s analogy was to make the idea of natural selection seem plausible by characterizing it as a grander version of a well-known process while emphasizing its efficiency and shaping power. He noted, for example, that some of the prize birds bred by London pigeon fanciers diverged so strikingly in size, plumage, beak shape, flying technique, vocalizations. bone structure, and many other attributes, that if they had been presented to an ornithologist as wild specimens, they would unquestionably have been considered to represent distinct species, perhaps even distinct genera. Darwin argued that if the relatively brief and constrained selective efforts of human breeders had produced such impressive results, it was likely that the more protracted and thorough-going efforts of nature would work still more efficaciously.  But as Darwin acknowledged, there were some fairly obvious reasons why the two processes might diverge. The superior power of natural selection—“Man can act only on external and visible characters: nature . . . can act on . . . the whole machinery of life. Man selects only for his own good; Nature only for that of the being which she tends” (_Origin,_ chap. 5)—might constitute a difference of kind rather than of degree, as might the much greater stretches of time available for natural selection. Further, although the mechanism of the two processes appeared superficially similar, their outcomes tended to be rather different. Natural selection produced a constantly increasing and diversifying variety of forms; it never reversed or exactly repeated itself. Anyone familiar with artificial selection would have realized that, although new breeds were constantly being developed and although neither improved wheat nor improved cattle showed any tendency to revert to the condition of their aboriginal wild ancestors, the strains produced by human selection were neither as prolific nor as durable as those produced by nature. Indeed, the animals and plants celebrated as the noblest achievements of the breeder’s art were especially liable to delicacy and infertility. Highly bred strains, long isolated from others of their species to preserve their genealogical purity, far from serving as a springboard for further variation, often had to be revivified with infusions of less-rarefied blood. Yet any relaxation of reproductive boundaries threatened subsidence into the common run of conspecifics.  Darwin firmly connected _Variation_ to the _Origin_ by devoting its introduction to an overview of his theory of evolution by natural selection. In particular, the two volumes of _Variation,_ cumbersomely organized and packed with zoological and botanical detail, addressed some of the difficulties inherent in the attractive but paradoxical analogy between natural selection and artificial selection. For selection of any sort to operate, diversity already had to exist. With wild populations living under natural conditions, however, diversity was difficult to discern. It was widely believed that a heightened propensity to vary (at least in ways obvious to human observers) was one of the few general characteristics that differentiated domestic animals as a group from their wild relatives. This point was conventionally illustrated with reference to coat color and design. American bison, for example, were, on the whole, brown, and all Burchell’s zebras shared similar black and white stripes. A single herd of either _Bos tauras_ or _Equus caballus_ (domestic cattle or horses), on the other hand, could display colors ranging from white through yellow, red, and brown to black, as well as a variety of spotted and blotched patterns.  In order to demonstrate that such populations spontaneously produced sufficient variation to support artificial selection, Darwin devoted most of the first volume of _ Variation_ to a species-by-species survey of domesticated plants and animals. He began with the dog, the breeds of which differed so greatly in size, shape, disposition, talents, and every other characteristic that Darwin attributed its exemplary plasticity to its derivation from several different species of wild canines. Domestic cats, on the other hand, differed relatively little from one another, at least, their variation tended to be individual, rather than consolidated into breeds. Darwin attributed this to the minimal influence exerted by cat owners over the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33335"],["title","Worrying Won't Win (#1)"],["body","id. \"Take Bulgaria, for instance, and up to a few years ago that was one of the Czar's best selling territories. In fact, Abe, whenever the Czar stops off at Sophia, him and the King of Bulgaria takes coffee together, such good friends they was.\"  \"Who is Sophia?\" Abe asked. \"_Also_ a relative of the Kaiser?\"  \"Sophia is the name of one big town in Bulgaria,\" Morris replied.  \"That's a name for a big town--Sophia,\" Abe remarked. \"Why don't they call it Lillian Russell and be done with it?\"  \"They could call it Williamsburg for all the business the Czar done there after the Kaiser got in his fine work,\" Morris said.  \"And after all, what good did it done him?\" Abe added. \"Because you know as well as I do, Mawruss, the Kaiser ain't two jumps ahead of the sheriff himself. In fact, Mawruss, the king business is to-day like the human-hair business and the green-goods business. It's practically a thing of the past.\"  \"Did I say it wasn't?\" Morris asked.  \"Being a king ain't a business no more, Mawruss. It's just a job,\" Abe continued, \"and it's a metter of a few months now when the only kings left will be, so to speak, journeymen kings like the King of England and the King of Belgium and not boss kings like the King of Austria and the Kaiser. Why, right now, that Germany is his store, and that the poor Germans _nebich_ is just salespeople; and he figures that if he wants to close out his stock and fixtures at a sacrifice and at the same time work his salespeople to death, what is that _their_ business, y'understand.\"  \"Well, that's the way the Czar figured,\" Morris commented. \"For, Abe, the Kaiser has got an idee years already he was running Russland on the open-shop principle, and before he woke up to the fact that the people he had been treating right straight along as non-union labor was really the majority stockholders, y'understand, they had changed the combination of the safe on him and notified the bank that on and after said date all checks would be signed by Jacob M. Kerensky as receiver.\"  \"You would think a feller like the Czar would learn something by what happened to this here Mellen of the New Haven Railroad,\" Abe said.  \"_Yow_ learn!\" Morris replied. \"Is the Kaiser learning something from what they done to the Czar?\"  \"That's a different matter entirely,\" Abe retorted. \"With a relation by marriage, you naturally figure if he makes a big success that he fell in soft and that a lucky stiff like him if he gets shot with a gun, y'understand, the bullet is from gold and it hits him in the pocket yet; whereas, if he goes broke and 'ain't got a cent left in the world, y'understand, it's a case of what could you expect from a _Schlemiel_ like that. So instead of learning anything from what happens to the Czar, I bet yer the Kaiser feels awful sore at him yet. Why, I don't suppose a day passes without the Kaiser's wife comes to him and says, 'Listen, Popper, Esther (or whatever the Czar's wife's name is) called me up again this morning; she says Nicholas 'ain't got no work nor nothing and she was crying something terrible.'  \"'Well, if she's going to keep on crying till I find that loafer a job,' the Kaiser says, 'she's got a long wet spell ahead of her.'  \"'She don't want you to find him no job,' the Kaiser's wife tells him. 'All she asks is you should send 'em transportation.'  \"'Transportation _nothing_!' the Kaiser says. 'I already sent transportation to the King of Greece, Ambassador Bernstorff, Doctor Dernburg, this here boy Ed _und Gott weisst wer nach_. What am I? The Pennsylvania Railroad or something?'  \"'Well, what is he going to do 'way out there in Tobolsk?' she says.  \"'If he would only of acted reasonable and killed off a couple million of them suckers, the way any other king would do, he never would of had to go to Tobolsk at all,' the Kaiser says.  \"'_Aber_ what shall I say to her if she rings up again?' she asks.  \"'Say what you please,' the Kaiser answers her, 'but tell Central I wouldn't pay no reverse charges under no circumstances whatsoever from nowheres.'\"  \"And who told _you_ all this, Abe?\" Morris asked.  \"Nobody,\" Abe replied. \"I figured it out for myself.\"  \"Well, you figured wrong, then,\" Morris said. \"The Kaiser don't act that way. He ain't human enough, and, furthermore, Abe, the Kaiser don't talk over the telephone, neither, because if he did, y'understand, it's a cinch that sooner or later the court physician would be giving out the cause of death as shock from being connected up with the electric-light plant by party or parties unknown and Long Live Kaiser Schmooel the Second--or whatever the Crown Prince's rotten name is.\"  \"Any one who done such a thing in the hopes of making a change for the better, Mawruss,\" Abe commented, \"would certainly be jumping from the frying-pan into the soup, because if the Germans got rid of the Kaiser in favor of the Crown Prince it would be a case of discarding a king and drawing a deuce.\"  \"Sure I know,\" Morris said, \"but what the Germans need is a new deal all around. As the game stands now in Germany, Abe, only a limited few sits in, while the rest of the country hustles the refreshments and pays for the lights and the cigars, and they're such a poor-spirited bunch, y'understand, that they 'ain't got nerve enough to suggest a kitty, even.\"  \"Well, it's too late for them to start a kitty now, Mawruss,\" Abe said. \"Which you could take it from me, Mawruss, the house is going to be pulled 'most any day. Several million husky cops is going up the front stoop right this minute, Mawruss, and while they may have a little trouble with them--now--ice-box style of doors, it's only a question of time when they would back up the patrol-wagon, y'understand, because if the Germans wouldn't close up the game of their own accord, Mawruss, the Allies must got to do it _for_ them.\"  \"But the Germans don't want us to help 'em,\" Morris said. \"They're perfectly satisfied as they are.\"  \"I know it,\" Abe said. \"They're a nation of shipping-clerks, Mawruss. They're in a rut, y'understand. They've all got rotten jobs and they're scared to death that they're going to lose them. Also the boss works them like dawgs and makes their lives miserable, y'understand, and yet they're trembling in their pants for fear he is going to bust up on them.\"  \"Then I guess it's up to us Allies to show them poor _Chamorrim_ how they could be bosses for themselves,\" Morris suggested.  \"Sure it is,\" Abe concluded, \"and next year in Tobolsk when the Kaiser joins his relations by marriage, Mawruss, he's going to pick up the _Tobolsker Freie Presse_ some morning and see where there has been incorporated at last the _Deutsche Allgemeine Wohlfahrtfabrik_, with a capital of a hundred billion marks, to take over the business of the K.K. Manufacturing Company, and he's going to say the same as everybody else: 'Well, what do you know about them Heinies? I never thought they had it in them.'\"     II  POTASH AND PERLMUTTER ON SOAP-BOXERS AND PEACE FELLERS     There is some of them peace fellers which ain't so much scared as    they are contrary.   \"People 'ain't begun to realize yet what this war really and truly means, Mawruss,\" Abe Potash said as he finished reading an interview with ex-Ambassador Gerard, in which the ex-ambassador said that people had not yet begun to realize what the war really meant.  \"Maybe they don't,\" Morris Perlmutter agreed, \"but for every feller which 'ain't begun to realize what this war really and truly means, Abe, there is a hundred other fellers which 'ain't begun to realize what a number of people there is which goes round saying that people 'ain't begun to realize what this war really and truly means, y'understand. Also, Abe, the same people is going round begging people which is just as patriotic as they are that they should brace up and be patriotic, y'understand, and they are pulling pledges to hold up the hands of the President on other people who has got similar pledges in their breast pockets and pretty near beats 'em to it, understand me, and that's the way it goes.\"  \"Well, if one time out of a hundred they strike somebody who really and truly don't realize what the war means, like you, Mawruss,\" Abe began, \"why, then, their time ain't entirely wasted, neither.\"  \"I realize just so much as you do what this war means, Abe,\" Morris retorted.  \"Maybe you do,\" Abe admitted, \"but you don't talk like you did, Mawruss, otherwise you would know that if out of a hundred Americans only ninety-nine of 'em pledges themselves to hold up the hands of the President, y'understand, and the balance of one claims that we are in this war just to save our investments in Franco-American bonds and that Mr. Wilson is every bit as bad as the Kaiser except that he's clean-shaved, y'understand, then them ninety-nine fellers with the pledges in their breast pockets should ought to convert the balance of one. Because, Mawruss, a nation which is ninety-nine per cent. patriotic is like a fish which is ninety-nine per cent. fresh--all you can notice is the one per cent. which smells bad.\"  \"I am just so much in favor of the country being one hundred per cent. American as you are, Abe,\" Morris said, \"but what I claim is that we should go about it _right_.\"  \"If you mean we shouldn't argue with them one-per-centers, but send them right back to that part of the old country which they come from originally, Mawruss,\" Abe continued, \"why, I am agreeable that they should be shipped right away, F.O.B., N.Y., all deliveries subject to delay and liability being limited to fifty dollars personal baggage in case they should, please Gawd, fail to arrive in Europe.\"  \"Sure I know,\" Morris agreed. \"But pretty near all them one-per-centers was born and raised in the United States or in Saint Louis, Wisconsin, and Cincinnati. You take this here _Burgermeister_ of Chicago, for instance, and the chances is that all he knows about the old country is what he learned on a couple of visits to Milwaukee, y'under"]]]
