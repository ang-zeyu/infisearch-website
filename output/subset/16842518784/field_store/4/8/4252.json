Color ranging from Snuff Brown to Sayal Brown.   +Pipistrellus subflavus obscurus+ Miller    _Pipistrellus subflavus obscurus_ Miller, N. Amer. Fauna, 13:93,   October 16, 1897.  _Type locality._--Lake George, Warren County, New York.  _Range._--From southern Quebec and southern Ontario south to southern Ohio and West Virginia; from the Atlantic Coast west into Wisconsin. Marginal occurrences are: _Minnesota_: St. Peter (Swanson and Evans, Jour. Mamm., 17:39, 1936); Marine (Swanson, Tech. Bull. No. 2, Minnesota Dept. Conservation, p. 60, 1945). _Wisconsin_: Hurley (Greeley and Beer, Jour. Mamm., 30:198, 1949). _Quebec_: Joliet (Anderson, Nat. Mus. Canada, Biol. ser. No. 31, Bull. 102:30, 1946). _Vermont_: Brandon (Osgood, Jour. Mamm., 19:436, 1938). _Maine_: No locality more precise than the state (Allen, Occ. Papers Boston Soc. Nat. Hist., 7(3):35, June, 1904). _New York_: Hastings on Hudson (Rowley, Abstr. of Proc. Linnean Soc. N. Y., for yr. ending March 11, 1902, p. 57). _Pennsylvania_: Beaver (Rhoads, Mamms. Pa. and N. J., 1903, p. 211). _West Virginia_: Cornwall's Cave (Frum, Jour. Mamm., 25:195, 1944). _Ohio_: Cat Run (Bole and Moulthrop, Sci. Publs. Cleveland Mus. Nat. Hist., 5(6):116, 1942); Symmes Creek (Bole and Moulthrop, _loc. cit._); Dry Cave (Bole and Moulthrop, _loc. cit._); \"Union County\" (Rausch, Jour. Mamm., 27:275, 1946). _Wisconsin_: Devils Lake (Jackson, Jour. Mamm., 1:38, 1919).  _Diagnosis._--\"... color duller and less yellow, and dark tips of shorter hairs on back more conspicuous\" than in _P. subflavus subflavus_ according to the original description.  _Remarks._--No one, as far as we know, has carefully studied the variation in _Pipistrellus subflavus_ of the United States and Canada since Miller named _P. s. obscurus_. With the more abundant material now available, such an appraisal would be worth-while. The occurrences cited above for Minnesota and Wisconsin were recorded in the literature under the specific name without indication of subspecific affinity. The reference of specimens from these states to the subspecies _P. s. obscurus_ is an arbitrary assignment on our part; we have not seen them. However, two specimens in the University of Kansas Museum of Natural History from Potosi (Snake Cave) Grant County, Wisconsin, are referable to _P. s. obscurus_. These provide the southwesternmost record station of occurrence in Wisconsin but are not shown on the distribution map because the specimens were received after figure 1 was prepared.  It is noteworthy that the species _Pipistrellus subflavus_ has not yet, as far as we can ascertain, been recorded from Michigan, northern Indiana, northern Illinois, or Iowa. Probably the species occurs in these areas.   +Pipistrellus subflavus veracrucis+ (Ward)    _Vesperugo veracrucis_ Ward, Amer. Nat., 25:745, August, 1891.    _Pipistrellus veracrucis_ Miller, N. Amer. Fauna, 13:93, October   16, 1897.  _Type locality._--Las Vigas, 8,500 ft., Veracruz.  _Range._--Eastern Mexico, certainly from the type locality southward into Honduras. Records of occurrence are: _Veracruz_: Las Vigas (13 specimens from 4 km. E Las Vigas, 8,500 ft., K. U.); 30 km. SSE Jesús Carranza, 1 (K. U.). _Honduras_: Jilamo Farm, Tela District, 3 (Univ. Michigan).  _Diagnosis._--Size small for the species; measurements of 13 near topotypes are: total length, 78(73-85); tibia, 12.9(11.8-14.7); forearm, 31.8(29.5-33.1); greatest length of skull (exclusive of incisors), 12.2(11.8-12.6); breadth of braincase immediately above roots of zygomatic arches, 6.3(6.0-6.7). Color darker than Mummy Brown above and below.  _Remarks._--The specimen from thirty kilometers south-southeast of Jesús Carranza, Veracruz, and the three specimens from Honduras agree in all respects with topotypes. The color of _P. s. veracrucis_ is much darker than that of _P. s. obscurus_ and is between black and the darkest brown in Ridgway's (_op. cit._) color key. Rinker (Jour. Mamm., 29:179-180,1948) described the three specimens from Honduras without assigning a specific name to them because he lacked topotypes of _P. s. veracrucis_. We find nothing in his description to correct, but can add that the upper tooth-rows in many, but not in all, specimens of _P. s. veracrucis_ are straighter than in _P. s. subflavus_. Probably it was this feature to which Rinker referred when he said that in _veracrucis_ \"The tooth rows tend to be more convergent posteriorly.\" Rinker did not refer the three specimens from Honduras to _P. veracrucis_ because Ward's original description states that _veracrucis_ has evenly spaced lower incisors and a basal cusp on the lower canine on only its forward edge. Rinker's specimens from Honduras have the first incisors in contact with each other, the second incisors in contact with the first incisors and the third incisor on each side of the lower jaw separated by a space from the second incisor and from the canine. The specimens from Honduras have a basal cusp on the hinder edge of the lower canine. In these two features they agree with the specimens from Veracruz and with specimens of _Pipistrellus subflavus_ from the United States and Canada. It is clear that Ward (Amer. Nat., 25:747,1891) was mistaken in stating that the lower incisors of _veracrucis_ were evenly spaced and that the canine had a basal cusp on only the forward edge. Ward (_loc. cit._) was correct in regarding his _Vesperugo veracrucis_ as \"most closely related to _V. georgianus_ [= _Pipistrellus subflavus_],\" but for want of actual specimens of _P. subflavus_ to use in comparison was incorrect in supposing that _P. subflavus_ had only two bands of color on the fur, more hair on the legs, and a larger area of hair on the interfemoral membrane. In these respects we perceive no difference between specimens from Veracruz and the United States.  _Vesperugo veracrucis_ Ward, therefore, proves to be only a subspecies of _Pipistrellus subflavus_, but is well characterized by dark color and small size.  _University of Kansas Museum of Natural History, Lawrence, Kansas._  _Transmitted October 31, 1949._                                       []                                23-1546          *       *        *        *        *    Transcriber's Notes    The text presented in this file is that contained in the original   printed version.

The naughty boy had managed to change his voice, so that she did not know it for his, and he had concealed himself so well that, though she peered about all round her, she could see no one. As soon as she had turned the corner the Shifty Lad came out, and by running very fast through the wood he contrived to reach home before his mother, who found him stretched out comfortably before the fire.  ‘Well, have you got any news to tell me?’ asked he.  ‘No, nothing; for I left the church at once, and did not stop to speak to anyone.’  ‘Oh, then no one has mentioned a trade to you?’ he said in tones of disappointment.  ‘Ye--es,’ she replied slowly. ‘At least, as I walked down the path a voice cried out “Robbery! Robbery! Robbery!” but that was all.’  ‘And quite enough too,’ answered the boy. ‘What did I tell you? That is going to be my trade.’  ‘Then your end will be hanging at the bridge of Dublin,’ said she. But there was no sleep for her that night, for she lay in the dark thinking about her son.  ‘If he is to be a thief at all, he had better be a good one. And who is there that can teach him?’ the mother asked herself. But an idea came to her, and she arose early, before the sun was up, and set off for the home of the Black Rogue, or Gallows Bird, who was such a wonderful thief that, though all had been robbed by him, no one could catch him.  ‘Good-morning to you,’ said the woman as she reached the place where the Black Gallows Bird lived when he was not away on his business. ‘My son has a fancy to learn your trade. Will you be kind enough to teach him?’  ‘If he is clever, I don’t mind trying,’ answered the Black Gallows Bird; ‘and, of course, if ANY one can turn him into a first-rate thief, it is I. But if he is stupid, it is of no use at all; I can’t bear stupid people.’  ‘No, he isn’t stupid,’ said the woman with a sigh. ‘So to-night, after dark, I will send him to you.’  The Shifty Lad jumped for joy when his mother told him where she had been.  ‘I will become the best thief in all Erin!’ he cried, and paid no heed when his mother shook her head and murmured something about ‘the bridge of Dublin.’  Every evening after dark the Shifty Lad went to the home of the Black Gallows Bird, and many were the new tricks he learned. By-and-by he was allowed to go out with the Bird and watch him at work, and at last there came a day when his master though that he had grown clever enough to help in a big robbery.  ‘There is a rich farmer up there on the hill, who has just sold all his fat cattle for much money and has bought some lean ones which will cost him little. Now it happens that, while he has received the money for the fat cattle, he has not yet paid the price of the thin ones, which he has in the cowhouse. To-morrow he will go to the market with the money in his hand, so to-night we must get at the chest. When all is quiet we will hide in the loft.’  There was no moon, and it was the night of Hallowe’en, and everyone was burning nuts and catching apples in a tub of water with their hands tied, and playing all sorts of other games, till the Shifty Lad grew quite tired of waiting for them to get to bed. The Black Gallows Bird, who was more accustomed to the business, tucked himself up on the hay and went to sleep, telling the boy to wake him when the merry-makers had departed. But the Shifty Lad, who could keep still no longer, crept down to the cowshed and loosened the heads of the cattle which were tied, and they began to kick each other and bellow, and made such a noise that the company in the farmhouse ran out to tie them up again. Then the Shifty Lad entered the room and picked up a big handful of nuts, and returned to the loft, where the Black Rogue was still sleeping. At first the Shifty Lad shut his eyes too, but very soon he sat up, and taking a big needle and thread from his pocket, he sewed the hem of the Black Gallows Bird’s coat to a heavy piece of bullock’s hide that was hanging at his back.  By this time the cattle were all tied up again, but as the people could not find their nuts they sat round the fire and began to tell stories.  ‘I will crack a nut,’ said the Shifty Lad.  ‘You shall not,’ cried the Black Gallows Bird; ‘they will hear you.’  ‘I don’t care,’ answered the Shifty Lad. ‘I never spend Hallowe’en yet without cracking a nut’; and he cracked one.  ‘Some one is cracking nuts up there,’ said one of the merry-makers in the farmhouse. ‘Come quickly, and we will see who it is.’  He spoke loudly, and the Black Gallows Bird heard, and ran out of the loft, dragging the big leather hide after him which the Shifty Lad had sewed to his coat.  ‘He is stealing my hide!’ shouted the farmer, and they all darted after him; but he was too swift for them, and at last he managed to tear the hide from his coat, and then he flew like a hare till he reached his old hiding-place. But all this took a long time, and meanwhile the Shifty Lad got down from the loft, and searched the house till he found the chest with the gold and silver in it, concealed behind a load of straw and covered with loaves of bread and a great cheese. The Shifty Lad slung the money bags round his shoulders and took the bread and the cheese under his arm, then set out quietly for the Black Rogue’s house.  ‘Here you are at last, you villain!’ cried his master in great wrath. ‘But I will be revenged on you.’  ‘It is all right,’ replied the Shifty Lad calmly. ‘I have brought what you wanted’; and he laid the things he was carrying down on the ground.  ‘Ah! you are the better thief,’ said the Black Rogue’s wife; and the Black Rogue added:  ‘Yes, it is you who are the clever boy’; and they divided the spoil and the Black Gallows Bird had one half and the Shifty Lad the other half.  A few weeks after that the Black Gallows Bird had news of a wedding that was to be held near the town; and the bridegroom had many friends and everybody sent him a present. Now a rich farmer who lived up near the moor thought that nothing was so useful to a young couple when they first began to keep house as a fine fat sheep, so he bade his shepherd go off to the mountain where the flock were feeding, and bring him back the best he could find. And the shepherd chose out the largest and fattest of the sheep and the one with the whitest fleece; then he tied its feet together and put it across his shoulder, for he had a long way to go.  That day, the Shifty Lad happened to be wandering over the moor, when he saw the man with the sheep on his shoulder walking along the road which led past the Black Rogue’s house. The sheep was heavy and the man was in no hurry, so he came slowly and the boy knew that he himself could easily get back to his master before the shepherd was even in sight.  ‘I will wager,’ he cried, as he pushed quickly through the bushes which hid the cabin--‘I will wager that I will steal the sheep from the man that is coming before he passes here.’  ‘Will you indeed?’ said the Gallows Bird. ‘I will wager you a hundred silver pieces that you can do nothing of the sort.’  ‘Well, I will try it, anyway,’ replied the boy, and disappeared in the bushes. He ran fast till he entered a wood through which the shepherd must go, and then he stopped, and taking off one of his shoes smeared it with mud and set it in the path. When this was done he slipped behind a rock and waited.  Very soon the man came up, and seeing the shoe lying there, he stooped and looked at it.  ‘It is a good shoe,’ he said to himself, ‘but very dirty. Still, if I had the fellow, I would be at the trouble of cleaning it’; so he threw the shoe down again and went on.  The Shifty Lad smiled as he heard him, and, picking up the shoe, he crept round by a short way and laid the other shoe on the path. A few minutes after the shepherd arrived, and beheld the second shoe lying on the path.  ‘Why, that is the fellow of the dirty shoe!’ he exclaimed when he saw it. ‘I will go back and pick up the other one, and then I shall have a pair of good shoes,’ and he put the sheep on the grass and returned to fetch the shoe. Then the Shifty Lad put on his shoes, and, picking up the sheep, carried it home. And the Black Rogue paid him the hundred marks of his wager.  When the shepherd reached the farmhouse that night he told his tale to his master, who scolded him for being stupid and careless, and bade him go the next day to the mountain and fetch him a kid, and he would send that as a wedding gift. But the Shifty Lad was on the look-out, and hid himself in the wood, and the moment the man drew near with the kid on his shoulders began to bleat like a sheep, and no one, not even the sheep’s own mother, could have told the difference.  ‘Why, it must have got its feet loose, and have strayed after all,’ thought the man; and he put the kid on the grass and hurried off in the direction of the bleating. Then the boy ran back and picked up the kid, and took it to the Black Gallows Bird.  The shepherd could hardly believe his eyes when he returned from seeking the sheep and found that the kid had vanished. He was afraid to go home and tell the same tale that he had told yesterday; so he searched the wood through and through till night was nearly come. Then he felt that there was no help for it, and he must go home and confess to his master.  Of course, the farmer was very angry at this second misfortune; but this time he told him to drive one of the big bulls from the mountain, and warned him that if he lost THAT he would lose his place also. Again the Shifty Lad, who was on the watch, perceived him pass by, and when he saw the man returning with the great bull he cried to the Black Rogue:  ‘Be quick and come into the wood, and we will try to get the bull also.’  ‘But how can we do that?’ asked the Black Rogue.  ‘Oh, quite easily! You hide yourself out there and baa like a sheep, and I will go in the other direction and bleat like a kid. It will be all right, I assure you.’  The shepherd was walking"]]]
