We're all out,” she said, as she began buttoning a stiff collar around his reluctant neck.  “Remember? Land, yes! I wish't I ever could forgit anything! The butcher says he's 'bout tired o' travelin' over the country lookin' for critters to kill, but if he finds anything he'll be up along in the course of a week. He ain't a real smart butcher, Cyse Higgins ain't.--Land, Rose, don't button that dickey clean through my epperdummis! I have to sport starched collars in this life on account o' you and your gran'mother bein' so chock full o' style; but I hope to the Lord I shan't have to wear 'em in another world!”  “You won't,” his wife responded with the snap of a dish towel, “or if you do, they'll wilt with the heat.”  Rose smiled, but the soft hand with which she tied the neckcloth about the old man's withered neck pacified his spirit, and he smiled knowingly back at her as she took her seat at the breakfast table spread near the open kitchen door. She was a dazzling Rose, and, it is to be feared, a wasted one, for there was no one present to observe her clean pink calico and the still more subtle note struck in the green ribbon which was tied round her throat,--the ribbon that formed a sort of calyx, out of which sprang the flower of her face, as fresh and radiant as if it had bloomed that morning.  “Give me my coffee turrible quick,” said Mr. Wiley; “I must be down to the bridge 'fore they start dog-warpin' the side jam.”  “I notice you're always due at the bridge on churnin' days,” remarked his spouse, testily.  “'T ain't me as app'ints drivin' dates at Edgewood,” replied the old man. “The boys'll hev a turrible job this year. The logs air ricked up jest like Rose's jack-straws; I never see 'em so turrible ricked up in all my exper'ence; an' Lije Dennett don' know no more 'bout pickin' a jam than Cooper's cow. Turrible sot in his ways, too; can't take a mite of advice. I was tellin' him how to go to work on that bung that's formed between the gre't gray rock an' the shore,--the awfullest place to bung that there is between this an' Biddeford,--and says he: 'Look here, I've be'n boss on this river for twelve year, an' I'll be doggoned if I'm goin' to be taught my business by any man!' 'This ain't no river,' says I, 'as you'd know,' says I, 'if you'd ever lived on the Kennebec.' 'Pity you hed n't stayed on it,' says he. 'I wish to the land I hed,' says I. An' then I come away, for my tongue's so turrible spry an' sarcustic that I knew if I stopped any longer I should stir up strife. There's some folks that'll set on addled aigs year in an' year out, as if there wa'n't good fresh ones bein' laid every day; an' Lije Dennett's one of 'em, when it comes to river-drivin'.”  “There's lots o' folks as have made a good livin' by mindin' their own business,” observed the still sententious Mrs. Wiley, as she speared a soda biscuit with her fork.  “Mindin' your own business is a turrible selfish trade,” responded her husband loftily. “If your neighbor is more ignorant than what you are,--partic'larly if he's as ignorant as Cooper's cow,--you'd ought, as a Kennebec man an' a Christian, to set him on the right track, though it's always a turrible risky thing to do.” Rose's grandfather was called, by the irreverent younger generation, sometimes “Turrible Wiley”  and sometimes “Old Kennebec,” because of the frequency with which these words appeared in his conversation. There were not wanting those of late who dubbed him Uncle Ananias, for reasons too obvious to mention. After a long, indolent, tolerably truthful, and useless life, he had, at seventy-five, lost sight of the dividing line between fact and fancy, and drew on his imagination to such an extent that he almost staggered himself when he began to indulge in reminiscence. He was a feature of the Edgewood “drive,” being always present during the five or six days that it was in progress, sometimes sitting on the river-bank, sometimes leaning over the bridge, sometimes reclining against the butt-end of a huge log, but always chewing tobacco and expectorating to incredible distances as he criticized and damned impartially all the expedients in use at the particular moment.  “I want to stay down by the river this afternoon,” said Rose. “Ever so many of the girls will be there, and all my sewing is done up. If grandpa will leave the horse for me, I'll take the drivers' lunch to them at noon, and bring the dishes back in time to wash them before supper.”  “I suppose you can go, if the rest do,” said her grandmother, “though it's an awful lazy way of spendin' an afternoon. When I was a girl there was no such dawdlin' goin' on, I can tell you. Nobody thought o' lookin' at the river in them days; there was n't time.”  “But it's such fun to watch the logs!” Rose exclaimed. “Next to dancing, the greatest fun in the world.”  “'Specially as all the young men in town will be there, watchin', too,”  was the grandmother's reply. “Eben Brooks an' Richard Bean got home yesterday with their doctors' diplomas in their pockets. Mrs. Brooks says Eben stood forty-nine in a class o' fifty-five, an' seemed consid'able proud of him; an' I guess it is the first time he ever stood anywheres but at the foot. I tell you when these fifty-five new doctors git scattered over the country there'll be consid'able many folks keepin' house under ground. Dick Bean's goin' to stop a spell with Rufe an' Steve Waterman. That'll make one more to play in the river.”  “Rufus ain't hardly got his workin' legs on yit,” allowed Mr. Wiley, “but Steve's all right. He's a turrible smart driver, an' turrible reckless, too. He'll take all the chances there is, though to a man that's lived on the Kennebec there ain't what can rightly be called any turrible chances on the Saco.”  “He'd better be 'tendin' to his farm,” objected Mrs. Wiley.  “His hay is all in,” Rose spoke up quickly, “and he only helps on the river when the farm work is n't pressing. Besides, though it's all play to him, he earns his two dollars and a half a day.”  “He don't keer about the two and a half,” said her grandfather. “He jest can't keep away from the logs. There's some that can't. When I first moved here from Gard'ner, where the climate never suited me--”   “The climate of any place where you hev regular work never did an' never will suit you,” remarked the old man's wife; but the interruption received no comment: such mistaken views of his character were too frequent to make any impression.  “As I was sayin', Rose,” he continued, “when we first moved here from Gard'ner, we lived neighbor to the Watermans. Steve an' Rufus was little boys then, always playin' with a couple o' wild cousins o' theirn, consid'able older. Steve would scare his mother pretty nigh to death stealin' away to the mill to ride on the 'carriage,' 'side o' the log that was bein' sawed, hitchin' clean out over the river an' then jerkin' back 'most into the jaws o' the machinery.”  “He never hed any common sense to spare, even when he was a young one,”  remarked Mrs. Wiley; “and I don't see as all the 'cademy education his father throwed away on him has changed him much.” And with this observation she rose from the table and went to the sink.  “Steve ain't nobody's fool,” dissented the old man; “but he's kind o' daft about the river. When he was little he was allers buildin' dams in the brook, an' sailin' chips, an' runnin' on the logs; allers choppin' up stickins an' raftin' 'em together in the pond. I cai'late Mis' Waterman died consid'able afore her time, jest from fright, lookin' out the winders and seein' her boys slippin' between the logs an' gittin' their daily dousin'. She could n't understand it, an' there's a heap o' things women-folks never do an' never can understand,--jest because they _air_ women-folks.”  “One o' the things is men, I s'pose,” interrupted Mrs. Wiley.  “Men in general, but more partic'larly husbands,” assented Old Kennebec; “howsomever, there's another thing they don't an' can't never take in, an' that's sport. Steve does river-drivin' as he would horse-racin' or tiger-shootin' or tight-rope dancin'; an' he always did from a boy. When he was about twelve to fifteen, he used to help the river-drivers spring and fall, reg'lar. He could n't do nothin' but shin up an' down the rocks after hammers an' hatchets an' ropes, but he was turrible pleased with his job. 'Stepanfetchit,' they used to call him them days,--Stepanfetchit Waterman.”  “Good name for him yet,” came in acid tones from the sink. “He's still steppin' an' fetchin', only it's Rose that's doin' the drivin' now.”  “I'm not driving anybody, that I know of,” answered Rose, with heightened color, but with no loss of her habitual self-command.  “Then, when he graduated from errants,” went on the crafty old man, who knew that when breakfast ceased, churning must begin, “Steve used to get seventy-five cents a day helpin' clear up the river--if you can call this here silv'ry streamlet a river. He'd pick off a log here an' there an' send it afloat, an' dig out them that hed got ketched in the rocks, and tidy up the banks jest like spring house-cleanin'. If he'd hed any kind of a boss, an' hed be'n trained on the Kennebec, he'd 'a' made a turrible smart driver, Steve would.”  “He'll be drownded, that's what'll become o' him,” prophesied Mrs. Wiley; “specially if Rose encourages him in such silly foolishness as ridin' logs from his house down to ourn, dark nights.”  “Seein' as how Steve built ye a nice pigpen last month, 'pears to me you might have a good word for him now an' then, mother,” remarked Old Kennebec, reaching for his second piece of pie.  “I wa'n't a mite deceived by that pigpen, no more'n I was by Jed Towle's hencoop, nor Ivory Dunn's well-curb, nor Pitt Packard's shed-steps. If you hed ever kep' up your buildin's yourself, Rose's beaux would n't hev to do their courtin'"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34949"],["title","Some Reptiles and Amphibians from Korea (#1)"],["body","that were saved subsequently hatched on June 15-17.  The call is a quiet low trill or series of staccato whistles rising slightly at the beginning; a short peeplike note also was heard. The specimens from Cheju Do, which are generally smaller than those collected on the mainland in spring, were taken on September 6 in a small stream that had large volcanic rocks in many places and that was flanked by thick brush and small trees. The earliest and latest dates on which _B. orientalis_ was collected were April 21 and September 6, respectively.  In the breeding season, males are distinguished from females by the large blackish (probably brownish earlier in season) areas on the anteroventral surface of the antebrachium, the metacarpal tubercle, and the inner surface of the first finger (sometimes also the second and third). Also, males have conspicuous black-tipped tubercles on the back (usually absent in females) that extend onto the limbs (usually smooth in females, at least laterally). Field observations by one of us (Byers) suggested that the dorsal pattern of males had greater contrast than that of females and that the venter was brighter reddish. Eight females from Tangjonggok averaged 47.9 (43-51) in snout-vent length, whereas 24 males from there averaged 50.0 (46-55), indicating little, if any, size difference between the sexes.  Okada (1931:29) recorded variation in color of live Korean individuals (green or brown dorsally and pale yellow or red ventrally) and variation in extent of black markings on the belly (_op. cit._:fig. 12). The specimens from Cheju Do (28, 32, 32, 32, 37 and 46 in snout-vent length) have less black ventrally than specimens from the mainland.   =Bufo bufo gargarizans= Cantor      _Bufo gargarizans_ Cantor, Ann.

Mus., 58:59,       July 22, 1907.      _Specimens examined_ (10).--Central National Forest, near     Pup´yong-ni, 1 (KU); 5 mi. NW Choksong, near Imjin River, 1 (KU); 5     mi. E Seoul, 1 (KU); 6 mi. E Seoul, 4 (KU), 2 (UMMZ); 1 mi. S     Yami-ri, 1 (KU).      _Description (nine females)._--Dorsal surface brownish, having     indistinct pale areas, some of which tend to form longitudinal     stripes that extend posteriorly from parotoid glands; blackish     mark, usually on lateral part of parotoid, having short spurs     directed posteriorly and ventrally; edge of upper jaw and warts on     dorsal surface becoming blackish with increasing size; small,     conspicuous group of warts near angle of jaw below parotoid;     middorsal warts tending, at level of posterior edge of parotoids, to     form a V that has its apex between the parotoids; ventral surface     pale yellowish, sometimes having well-defined blackish marks;     granular underparts of large specimens having small blackish     tubercles.      _Male (KU 40118 from 5 mi. E Seoul)._--Snout-vent length, 65; no     vocal sacs or slits; dorsal and inner surfaces of first and second     fingers, and inner surface of third finger black; canthus rostralis     indistinct (a well-defined ridge on right side); nostrils closer to     tip of snout than to eye, their distance from each other slightly     less than interorbital width; interorbital width (6.2) greater than     width of eyelid (4.7); tympanum distinct, circular, its diameter     (3.0) less than length of eye (6.5), and approximately twice     distance (1.6) of tympanum from eye; no cranial crests; parotoid     gland elongate, approximately twice as long as broad (12.5 × 5.0),     narrowly separated from posterior edge of eyelid; head elongate     (width at posterior edge of tympanum, 23.6); length from posterior     edge of tympanum to tip of upper jaw, 18.9; first finger slightly     longer than second, fourth finger about two-thirds as long as third;     most subarticular tubercles divided; outer palmar tubercle larger     than inner; heels not touching when folded legs placed at right     angles to longitudinal axis of body; tibiotarsal articulation just     reaching eye when leg laid forward; tarsometatarsal articulation not     reaching beyond snout; foot large (tibiotarsal articulation to tip     of fourth toe approximately 46.0); fourth toe approximately half     webbed, other toes more than half webbed; edges of webs somewhat     crenulate; some subarticular tubercles divided; length of inner     metatarsal tubercle (4.5) more than half length of first toe (7.0);     inner metatarsal tubercle larger than outer, both darkened; tarsal     fold extending from inner metatarsal tubercle for approximately     two-thirds length of tarsus; tips of toes (not fingers) darkened;     dorsal surface of back and proximal part of hind legs coarsely     granular, of rounded, pavement-type tubercles lacking sharp tips;     small group of warts near angle of jaw below parotoids; dorsal     pattern contrasting and irregular (especially on limbs), of dark     brown and pale gray; conspicuous black mark (interrupted) on lateral     surface of parotoid having two, well-defined spurs that project     posteroventrally; undersurface granular, lacking markings except for     two indistinctly-margined dark spots on chest, and black spot on     left leg.  _Remarks._--This nocturnal, introduced species (Okada, 1931:47) is presumably widespread in Korea and seemingly prefers lowland habitats. Individuals were taken in sparse vegetation on a sand flat near the Han River, at the edge of a rice field in a light rain, along a road at night, and in millet fields adjacent to the Han River, which was flooding at that time (July 9).  As is obvious from the foregoing descriptions, the male (KU 40118), which was obtained on March 19, differs considerably from the nine females; neither does it agree with Stejneger's (1907:66) or Okada's (_op. cit._:45-46, fig. 18) description of males of _Bufo bufo asiaticus [=gargarizans]_ from Wonsan and Seoul. Upon cursory examination, KU 40118 is notable for having a contrasting dorsal pattern and elongate, ranidlike proportions. Some of the characteristics resemble those of _Bufo raddei_ Strauch as given by Stejneger (_op. cit._:70-72, figs. 53-57), Okada (1935:9, figs. 2 and 32-34, pls. II-III), and Liu (1950:203-205, fig. 43).  Stejneger (_op. cit._:59-68) recognized _B. b. gargarizans_ as occurring in southern China, and _Bufo bufo asiaticus_ as the subspecies occurring in northern China. Subsequently, _asiaticus_ was relegated to synonymy under the earlier-named _gargarizans_--see discussions by Pope and Boring (1940:33) and Liu (_op. cit._:220).   =Kaloula borealis= (Barbour)      _Cacopoides borealis_ Barbour, Bull. Mus. Comp. Zool., 51(12):231,       April, 1908 (type locality, Antung, Manchuria).      _Kaloula borealis_, Noble, Amer. Mus. Novit., 165:6, April 16, 1925.      _Specimens examined_ (8).--5 mi. ESE Seoul, 1 (KU); 6 mi. E Seoul, 3     (UMMZ); 7 mi. ESE Seoul, 4 (KU).  _Remarks._--On April 5, one male and three females were uncovered by a bulldozer from between one and two feet below the surface of the ground in an old Korean burial mound; one individual was completely surrounded by compact soil. All quickly became active when placed in water. Two of the females (43 and 44 in snout-vent length) contained masses of immature eggs. A male obtained on June 4 was found during a rain; the three UMMZ specimens were obtained on July 8 on banks above the Han River. Breeding of this species seems to coincide with the rainy season in late spring and early summer when males were noted calling around flooded ditches and swales in deep grass. The local Korean name of the species, which sounds something like \"maeng-kongi,\" is said to come from the call, which is best described as a monotonous, snoring sound that rarely is heard in two parts as suggested by the name.   =Hyla arborea japonica= Günther      [_Hyla arborea_] Var. _japonica_ Günther, Catalogue of the Batrachia       Salientia in the ...

NNE Sogwi-ri, Cheju Do, 1 (UMMZ).  _Remarks._--Hylids from 5 mi. ESE Seoul were collected from a cement-walled pit at the Seoul City Water Works; a specimen of _Elaphe rufodorsata_ taken in the pit had eaten one hylid. Two individuals were taken in the morning of May 29 on leaf litter in a wooded valley in the Central National Forest where a number were calling in a light rain, but the species was rarely found in woods. Two frogs were found along a rocky stream at Sangbonch´on-ni. Most individuals were taken while calling, on grasses and reeds or on the ground, along the edges of rice fields. Sixteen hylids collected 1 mi. NW Oho-ri were calling in shallow water of a rice field on a hillside, but none was heard in a large lake nearby or in adjacent fields. On May 15, 4 mi. ESE Ch´orwon, approximately one hundred tadpoles, thought to be of this species, congregated near a drain (into a lower field) of an unused rice field; the tadpoles were well-developed, some having hind legs. The earliest and latest dates of collection represented in our material are May 8 and October 29. The call is best described as a raspy \"waak,\" \"week,\" or \"wiick\" in the middle register.
