Mike danced about the melee with bared teeth, charging in once as if to leap upon the quarry with both feet. Frustrated by the peril of the whirling two-by-fours, he swept up handfuls of gravel to hurl.  Blackie turned to run for one of the axes. Just then, Sid struck home to the head of the robot.  Sparks spat out amid a tinkle of glass. The machine ceased all motion.  \"All right!\" panted Blackie. \"All _right_! That's enough!\"  They stepped back, snarls fading. A handful of gravel trickled through Mike's fingers and pattered loudly on the concrete. Gradually, the men began to straighten up, seeing the robot as an inert heap of metal rather than as a weird beast in its death throes.  \"We better load up an' get,\" said Blackie. \"We wanna be over on the trail if they send somethin' up the road to look for _this_.\"  Vito dragged the robot off the highway by the head, and they began the task of lashing it to the two-by-fours.  It was about two hours later when they plodded around a street corner among the ruins and stopped before a fairly intact building. By that time, they had picked up an escort of dirty, half-clad children who ran ahead to spread the news.  Two other men and a handful of women gathered around with eager exclamations. The hunters dropped their catch.  \"Better get to work on him,\" said Blackie, glancing at the sky. \"Be dark soon.\"  The men who had remained as guards ran inside the entrance of polished granite and brought out tools: hammers, crowbars, hatchets. Behind them hurried women with basins and large cans. The original four, weary from the weight of the robot despite frequent pauses on the trail, stepped back.  \"Where first, Blackie?\" asked one of the men, waiting for the women to untangle the rope and timbers.  \"Try all the joints. After that, we'll crack him open down the middle for the main supply tank.\"  He watched the metal give way under the blows. As the robot was dismembered, the fluid that had lubricated the complex mechanism flowed from its wounds and was poured by the women into a five-gallon can.  \"Bring a cupful, Judy,\" Blackie told his woman, a wiry blond girl. \"I wanna see if it's as good as the last.\"  He lit a stick at the fire as they crossed the littered, once-ornate lobby, and she followed him down a dim hall. He pulled aside the skins that covered their doorway, then stumbled his way to the table. The window was still uncovered against the night chill, but it looked out on a courtyard shadowed by towering walls. To eyes adjusted to the sunny street, the room was dark.  Judy poured the oil into the makeshift lamp, waited for the rag wick to soak, and held it out to Blackie. He lit the wick from his stick.  \"It burns real good, Blackie,\" the girl said, wrinkling her nose against the first oily smoke. \"Gee, you're smart to catch one the first day out.\"  \"Tell them other dames to watch how they use it!\" he warned. \"This oughta last a month or more when we get him all emptied.\"  He blew out the dying flame on the stick and dropped the charred wood thoughtfully to the floor.  \"Naw, I ain't so smart,\" he admitted, \"or I'd figure a way to make one of them work the garden for us. Maybe someday--but _this_ kind won't do nothin' but fix that goddam road, an' what good's that to anybody?\"  His woman moved the burning lamp carefully to the center of the table.  \"Anyway, it's gonna be better'n last winter,\" she said. \"We'll have lights now.\""]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32595"],["title","A Woman's Wartime Journal (#1)"],["body","   *                                                      JULY 27, 1864.  Major Ansley and family have remained. We are feeling more settled and have begun to bring to light some of the things which we had put away.         *       *       *       *       *                                                      JULY 28, 1864.  I rose early and had the boys plow the turnip-patch. We were just rising from breakfast when Ben Glass rode up with the cry: \"The Yankees are coming. Mrs. Burge, hide your mules!\" How we were startled and how we hurried the Major to his room! [The Yankees did not come that day, but it was thought best to send Major Ansley away. He left at 2 A.M.]         *       *       *       *       *                                                      JULY 29, 1864.  Sleepless nights. The report is that the Yankees have left Covington for Macon, headed by Stoneman, to release prisoners held there. They robbed every house on the road of its provisions, sometimes taking every piece of meat, blankets and wearing apparel, silver and arms of every description. They would take silk dresses and put them under their saddles, and many other things for which they had no use. Is this the way to make us love them and their Union? Let the poor people answer whom they have deprived of every mouthful of meat and of their livestock to make any! Our mills, too, they have burned, destroying an immense amount of property.         *       *       *       *       *                                                     AUGUST 2, 1864.  Just as I got out of bed this morning Aunt Julia [a slave] called me to look down the road and see the soldiers. I peeped through the blinds, and there they were, sure enough, the Yankees--the blue coats!  I was not dressed. The servant women came running in. \"Mistress, they are coming! They are coming! They are riding into the lot! There are two coming up the steps!\"  I bade Rachel [a slave] fasten my room door and go to the front door and ask them what they wanted. They did not wait for that, but came in and asked why my door was fastened. She told them that the white folks were not up. They said they wanted breakfast, and that quick, too.  \"Thug\" [short for \"Sugar,\" the nickname of a little girl, Minnie Minerva Glass, now Mrs. Joe Carey Murphy of Charlotte, North Carolina, who had come to pass the night with Sadai] and Sadai, as well as myself, were greatly alarmed. As soon as I could get on my clothing I hastened to the kitchen to hurry up breakfast. Six of them were there talking with my women. They asked about our soldiers and, passing themselves off as Wheeler's men, said:  \"Have you seen any of our men go by?\"  \"Several of Wheeler's men passed last evening. Who are you?\" said I.  \"We are a portion of Wheeler's men,\" said one.  \"You look like Yankees,\" said I.  \"Yes,\" said one, stepping up to me; \"we are Yankees. Did you ever see one before?\"  \"Not for a long time,\" I replied, \"and none such as you.\" [These men, Mrs. Burge says further, were raiders, Illinois and Kentucky men of German origin. They left after breakfast, taking three of her best mules, but doing no further injury.]  To-night Captain Smith of an Alabama regiment, and a squad of twenty men, are camped opposite in the field. They have all supped with me, and I shall breakfast with them. We have spent a pleasant evening with music and talk. They have a prisoner along. I can't help feeling sorry for him.         *       *       *       *       *                                                     AUGUST 5, 1864.  Mr. Ward has been robbed by the Yankees of his watch, pencil, and shirt.         *       *       *       *       *                                                   NOVEMBER 8, 1864.  To-day will probably decide the fate of the Confederacy. If Lincoln is re-elected I think our fate is a hard one, but we are in the hands of a merciful God, and if He sees that we are in the wrong, I trust that He will show it unto us. I have never felt that slavery was altogether right, for it is abused by men, and I have often heard Mr. Burge say that if he could see that it was sinful for him to own slaves, if he felt that it was wrong, he would take them where he could free them. He would not sin for his right hand. The purest and holiest men have owned them, and I can see nothing in the scriptures which forbids it. I have never bought or sold slaves and I have tried to make life easy and pleasant to those that have been bequeathed me by the dead. I have never ceased to work. Many a Northern housekeeper has a much easier time than a Southern matron with her hundred negroes.         *       *       *       *       *                                                  NOVEMBER 12, 1864.  Warped and put in dresses for the loom. Oh, this blockade gives us work to do for all hands!         *       *       *       *       *                                                  NOVEMBER 15, 1864.  Went up to Covington to-day to pay the Confederate tax. Did not find the commissioners. Mid [a slave] drove me with Beck and the buggy. Got home about three o'clock. How very different is Covington from what it used to be! And how little did they who tore down the old flag and raised the new realize the results that have ensued!         *       *       *       *       *                                                  NOVEMBER 16, 1864.  As I could not obtain in Covington what I went for in the way of dye stuffs, etc., I concluded this morning, in accordance with Mrs. Ward's wish, to go to the Circle. We took Old Dutch and had a pleasant ride as it was a delightful day, but how dreary looks the town! Where formerly all was bustle and business, now naked chimneys and bare walls, for the depot and surroundings were all burned by last summer's raiders. Engaged to sell some bacon and potatoes. Obtained my dye stuffs. Paid seven dollars [Confederate money] a pound for coffee, six dollars an ounce for indigo, twenty dollars for a quire of paper, five dollars for ten cents' worth of flax thread, six dollars for pins, and forty dollars for a bunch of factory thread.  On our way home we met Brother Evans accompanied by John Hinton, who inquired if we had heard that the Yankees were coming. He said that a large force was at Stockbridge, that the Home Guard was called out, and that it was reported that the Yankees were on their way to Savannah. We rode home chatting about it and finally settled it in our minds that it could not be so. Probably a foraging party.  Just before night I walked up to Joe Perry's to know if they had heard anything of the report. He was just starting off to join the company [the Home Guard], being one of them.         *       *       *       *       *                                                  NOVEMBER 17, 1864.  Have been uneasy all day. At night some of the neighbors who had been to town called. They said it was a large force moving very slowly. What shall I do? Where go?         *       *       *       *       *                                                  NOVEMBER 18, 1864.  Slept very little last night. Went out doors several times and could see large fires like burning buildings. Am I not in the hands of a merciful God who has promised to take care of the widow and orphan?  Sent off two of my mules in the night. Mr. Ward and Frank [a slave] took them away and hid them. In the morning took a barrel of salt, which had cost me two hundred dollars, into one of the black women's gardens, put a paper over it, and then on the top of that leached ashes. Fixed it on a board as a leach tub, daubing it with ashes [the old-fashioned way of making lye for soap]. Had some few pieces of meat taken from my smoke-house carried to the Old Place [a distant part of the plantation] and hidden under some fodder. Bid them hide the wagon and gear and then go on plowing. Went to packing up mine and Sadai's clothes. I fear that we shall be homeless.  The boys came back and wished to hide their mules. They say that the Yankees camped at Mr. Gibson's last night and are taking all the stock in the county. Seeing them so eager, I told them to do as they pleased. They took them off, and Elbert [the black coachman] took his forty fattening hogs to the Old Place Swamp and turned them in.  We have done nothing all day--that is, my people have not. I made a pair of pants for Jack [a slave]. Sent Nute [a slave] up to Mrs. Perry's on an errand. On his way back, he said, two Yankees met him and begged him to go with them. They asked if we had livestock, and came up the road as far as Mrs. Laura Perry's. I sat for an hour expecting them, but they must have gone back. Oh, how I trust I am safe! Mr. Ward is very much alarmed.         *       *       *       *       *                                                  NOVEMBER 19, 1864.  Slept in my clothes last night, as I heard that the Yankees went to neighbor Montgomery's on Thursday night at one o'clock, searched his house, drank his wine, and took his money and valuables. As we were not disturbed, I walked after breakfast, with Sadai, up to Mr. Joe Perry's, my nearest neighbor, where the Yankees were yesterday. Saw Mrs. Laura [Perry] in the road surrounded by her children, seeming to be looking for some one. She said she was looking for her husband, that old Mrs. Perry had just sent her word that the Yankees went to James Perry's the night before, plundered his house, and drove off all his stock, and that she must drive hers into the old fields. Before we were done talking, up came Joe and Jim Perry from their hiding-place. Jim was very much excited. Happening to turn and look behind, as we stood there, I saw some blue-coats coming down the hill. Jim immediately raised his gun, swearing he would kill them anyhow.  \"No, don't!\" said I, and ran home as fast as I could, with Sadai.  I could hear them cry, \"Halt! Halt!\" and their guns went off in quick succession. Oh God, the time of trial has come!  A man passed "]]]
