I am sure that I could do it just as well as a boy.\"  \"But this would necessitate a journey into the enemy's country. A bright boy could go through all right if he would exercise his wits, but a tender, delicate girl like you! Why, I couldn't think of it!\"  \"I could do just as well as a boy,\" declared Jeanne with conviction. \"I am sure that I could. Please let me try, father.\"  \"I am sorry that I spoke of it, child. I will tell you just what the service is, and you will see the impossibility of any girl undertaking it. In the cities both North and South there are men whose duty it is to look after certain private matters for the government. In our communications with each other we must be very guarded. We do not dare to risk even the mails, because in almost every department of the service there are traitors. In some mysterious manner the enemy becomes aware of all our plans. Therefore we have tried and trusted men who are our go betweens. On some occasions we have employed boys because they could pass through the lines of the armies without being suspected of carrying important information. But as it is a hazardous business we use the boys only when there is no one else to send. Just at present our men are all out, and even the few boys who are ordinarily available are not on hand. That is why I spoke as I did.\"  \"Where would the boy have to go?\" queried Jeanne, who had listened attentively.  \"To New Orleans, dear. It is a long distance, and would be a perilous journey. You see, Jeanne, how I am trusting you. You will be careful not to repeat anything I say.\"  \"I understand perfectly, father. You need not fear when you tell me anything. You could not be useful if others knew of your affairs.\"  \"That is it precisely, my daughter.\"  \"Is the errand important, father?\"  \"Very.\" Mr. Vance thought she saw the impossibility of going and therefore spoke more freely than he otherwise would have done. \"I ought to send a messenger not later than day after to-morrow with the documents, but I fear that I shall have to let the matter rest until some of the men come in, and then it may be too late.\"  \"Father, doesn't Uncle Ben live in New Orleans?\"  \"Yes, Jeanne; why?\"  \"Why couldn't I go down to see him, and carry these papers hidden about me? The trains are still running, aren't they?\"  \"Yes,\" said her father thoughtfully; \"but those in the Southern States are under Confederate control, you know.\"  \"Well, suppose I were to take the train from here to St. Louis,\" mapping the route on her lap, \"then from there I could go down the Mississippi on a steamboat. St. Louis is for the Union, and New Orleans belongs to us now too. I don't see much danger in that, father.\"  \"It sounds all right, little girl. The only flaw lies in the fact that Vicksburg is not ours. If it were then the matter could be easily arranged.\"  \"Don't you think that it will be ours soon, father?\"  \"Yes, indeed,\" replied Mr. Vance with conviction. \"With Farragut and Porter on the river and this new man Grant who is making such a record in charge of the land forces it will not be long before Vicksburg will share the fate of Forts Henry and Donelson and Island No. 10. Indeed,\" added he, for Mr. Vance in common with many others held the view that the war could not be of long duration, \"I feel sure that McClellan will soon enter Richmond and that will virtually close the war. It is only a question of days now before we shall see the end of this rebellion. The administration is of the same opinion, because it has ceased to enlist men for the army.\"  \"Then, father, it seems to me that there would be no risk in performing this service for you. I feel sure that I could carry your papers safely to New Orleans. It is not as if the country all belonged to the rebels. There would be only one place to pass that is theirs: Vicksburg. I know that our men can easily go by one place,\" she added confidently.  \"Your manner of taking hold of the matter almost persuades me to let you try it, Jeanne,\" and Mr. Vance regarded his daughter with a new light in his eyes.  \"Do,\" said Jeanne as calmly as she could, realizing that if she would carry her point she must be very matter-of-fact. \"You see, father, no one would suspect a girl of carrying papers.\"  \"I don't know but that you are right, Jeanne. Still, I would not consider the thing for an instant if my need were not so great. Should the papers fall into the rebels' hands, not only would they secure important information but they would also get the names of men whose death would pay the penalty of discovery.\"  \"I understand,\" said the girl gravely. \"But the rebels shall never get them, father. I will destroy them first. They must be concealed about my clothing in such a manner that even if I were searched they could not be discovered. Not that I think that I shall be,\" she added hastily as a look of alarm flitted over her father's face, \"but it is just as well to be prepared for emergencies.\"  \"What are you two plotting?\" asked Mrs. Vance entering the room. \"You have been talking so earnestly that I thought that you were settling the affairs of the nation.\"  \"We have been,\" answered Jeanne gaily. \"I am going to New Orleans on business for father.\"  \"Oh, Richard,\" came from Mrs. Vance in a wailing cry. \"Not my girl too! I have given my boy! Leave me my daughter.\"  \"Mother!\" Jeanne sprang to her outstretched arms where she was folded close to the mother's heart. \"You don't understand. There is no danger. Who would harm a girl like me?\"  \"She shall not go, Dora, if you do not consent,\" spoke Mr. Vance comfortingly. \"My need for a messenger was so urgent that I spoke of it before Jeanne, and the little witch has beguiled me into thinking that she is the very one for the business.\"  \"Why of course I am,\" cried Jeanne in decided tones. \"Let's sit down and talk it over.\"  \"I don't like it,\" said Mrs. Vance after the matter had been explained. \"I am afraid that something will happen to you.\"  \"But, mother, what could happen? Even if I were to fall into the hands of the Confederates what could they do to me? Men don't make war on girls.\"  \"I know that the Southern people are counted chivalrous,\" answered Mrs. Vance, \"but soldiers are usually rough fellows, and I would not like you to be brought into contact with them even though they were our own boys.\"  \"Dick is a soldier, and he isn't a bit rough. They are all somebody's sons, mother. I thought that you liked soldiers.\"  \"I do,\" assented Mrs. Vance wearily, \"but I don't like the thought of sending you where there is a chance of fighting. No one knows what might happen.\"  \"Dick has to take a great many chances, and why should not I risk a little for my country? Wouldn't you be willing to give your life for it, mother?\"  \"Yes; but----\" began the mother.  \"And I am your child,\" cried Jeanne, kissing her. \"I can't help it, mother. It's in the blood, and blood will tell, you know. Haven't I heard you and father many a time relate what great things our ancestors did in the Revolution? Well, you really can't expect anything else from their descendants.\"  \"I suppose not,\" and Mrs. Vance stifled a sigh. \"If it really would help you, Richard.\"  \"It really would, Dora. If Jeanne can carry these papers to New Orleans she is not only worth her weight in gold but she will do the government a great service. She is energetic, resourceful and self-reliant. I believe that she can get through without injury to herself or I should not consider the thing a moment. As she says, why should harm come to a girl? She would not be suspected where older people would be subjected to the most searching scrutiny. The more that I think of it, the more favorably does the idea strike me.\"  \"Then I must consent,\" Mrs. Vance smiled faintly though her face was very white. \"My country demands much of me, Richard.\"  \"It does, Dora. But please God when this rebellion is put down we shall have such peace as the country has never enjoyed. Let us hope for the best, dear.\"  \"When do I start, father?\" broke in Jeanne.  \"I think to-morrow night. The sooner the better. I will see about your transportation in the morning, and try to arrange to send you straight through. Now, little girl, you must say good-night because we must be up bright and early. There is a great deal to be done to-morrow.\"  \"Good-night,\" said Jeanne obediently, and kissing each tenderly she retired to her room.     CHAPTER III  STARTING FOR DIXIE   The next day passed all too quickly for the parents, but not for Jeanne. She went about her preparations with an uplifted mien and a solemnity of manner that at another time would have been amusing, but which under the circumstances went to her mother's heart.  \"In this petticoat, dear, I have quilted the documents,\" said Mrs. Vance as she dressed her for her departure. \"It may be a little heavy, but you need not wear so many skirts as you otherwise would, and perhaps it will not be too warm. See how nicely it holds out your dress. It almost answers the purpose of a pair of hoops.\"  \"Am I not to wear my hoops, mother?\"  \"No, child. They are sometimes in the way, and as you have not yet learned to manage them well, it would be best not. Your frock hangs out in quite the approved style as it is.\"  Jeanne glanced down at her attire complacently.  \"It does look stylish,\" she admitted. \"I wonder if the rebel girls wear hoops.\"  \"I dare say they do,\" answered the mother rather absently. Then overcome by a rush of emotion she caught the girl to her. \"Oh, Jeanne, I wonder if I am doing right to let you go! What if some harm should come to you?\"  \"Don't worry, mother,\" and Jeanne soothed her gently. \"I feel sure that I will get through safely.\"  \"I shall not be easy until I hold you in my arms again,\" said Mrs. Vance mournfully. \"But I must not make it hard for you to go, dear. You will be careful, Jeanne.\"  \"Yes, mother.\"  \"And, child, you are loyal,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33"],["title","The Scarlet Letter (#1)"],["body"," has very infrequent access. In the way of furniture, there is a stove with a voluminous funnel; an old pine desk with a three-legged stool beside it; two or three wooden-bottom chairs, exceedingly decrepit and infirm; and—not to forget the library—on some shelves, a score or two of volumes of the Acts of Congress, and a bulky Digest of the Revenue laws. A tin pipe ascends through the ceiling, and forms a medium of vocal communication with other parts of the edifice. And here, some six months ago—pacing from corner to corner, or lounging on the long-legged stool, with his elbow on the desk, and his eyes wandering up and down the columns of the morning newspaper—you might have recognised, honoured reader, the same individual who welcomed you into his cheery little study, where the sunshine glimmered so pleasantly through the willow branches on the western side of the Old Manse. But now, should you go thither to seek him, you would inquire in vain for the Locofoco Surveyor. The besom of reform hath swept him out of office, and a worthier successor wears his dignity and pockets his emoluments.  This old town of Salem—my native place, though I have dwelt much away from it both in boyhood and maturer years—possesses, or did possess, a hold on my affection, the force of which I have never realized during my seasons of actual residence here. Indeed, so far as its physical aspect is concerned, with its flat, unvaried surface, covered chiefly with wooden houses, few or none of which pretend to architectural beauty—its irregularity, which is neither picturesque nor quaint, but only tame—its long and lazy street, lounging wearisomely through the whole extent of the peninsula, with Gallows Hill and New Guinea at one end, and a view of the alms-house at the other—such being the features of my native town, it would be quite as reasonable to form a sentimental attachment to a disarranged checker-board. And yet, though invariably happiest elsewhere, there is within me a feeling for Old Salem, which, in lack of a better phrase, I must be content to call affection. The sentiment is probably assignable to the deep and aged roots which my family has stuck into the soil. It is now nearly two centuries and a quarter since the original Briton, the earliest emigrant of my name, made his appearance in the wild and forest-bordered settlement which has since become a city. And here his descendants have been born and died, and have mingled their earthly substance with the soil, until no small portion of it must necessarily be akin to the mortal frame wherewith, for a little while, I walk the streets. In part, therefore, the attachment which I speak of is the mere sensuous sympathy of dust for dust. Few of my countrymen can know what it is; nor, as frequent transplantation is perhaps better for the stock, need they consider it desirable to know.  But the sentiment has likewise its moral quality. The figure of that first ancestor, invested by family tradition with a dim and dusky grandeur, was present to my boyish imagination as far back as I can remember. It still haunts me, and induces a sort of home-feeling with the past, which I scarcely claim in reference to the present phase of the town. I seem to have a stronger claim to a residence here on account of this grave, bearded, sable-cloaked, and steeple-crowned progenitor—who came so early, with his Bible and his sword, and trode the unworn street with such a stately port, and made so large a figure, as a man of war and peace—a stronger claim than for myself, whose name is seldom heard and my face hardly known. He was a soldier, legislator, judge; he was a ruler in the Church; he had all the Puritanic traits, both good and evil. He was likewise a bitter persecutor; as witness the Quakers, who have remembered him in their histories, and relate an incident of his hard severity towards a woman of their sect, which will last longer, it is to be feared, than any record of his better deeds, although these were many. His son, too, inherited the persecuting spirit, and made himself so conspicuous in the martyrdom of the witches, that their blood may fairly be said to have left a stain upon him. So deep a stain, indeed, that his dry old bones, in the Charter-street burial-ground, must still retain it, if they have not crumbled utterly to dust! I know not whether these ancestors of mine bethought themselves to repent, and ask pardon of Heaven for their cruelties; or whether they are now groaning under the heavy consequences of them in another state of being. At all events, I, the present writer, as their representative, hereby take shame upon myself for their sakes, and pray that any curse incurred by them—as I have heard, and as the dreary and unprosperous condition of the race, for many a long year back, would argue to exist—may be now and henceforth removed.  Doubtless, however, either of these stern and black-browed Puritans would have thought it quite a sufficient retribution for his sins that, after so long a lapse of years, the old trunk of the family tree, with so much venerable moss upon it, should have borne, as its topmost bough, an idler like myself. No aim that I have ever cherished would they recognise as laudable; no success of mine—if my life, beyond its domestic scope, had ever been brightened by success—would they deem otherwise than worthless, if not positively disgraceful. “What is he?” murmurs one grey shadow of my forefathers to the other. “A writer of story books! What kind of business in life—what mode of glorifying God, or being serviceable to mankind in his day and generation—may that be? Why, the degenerate fellow might as well have been a fiddler!” Such are the compliments bandied between my great grandsires and myself, across the gulf of time! And yet, let them scorn me as they will, strong traits of their nature have intertwined themselves with mine.  Planted deep, in the town’s earliest infancy and childhood, by these two earnest and energetic men, the race has ever since subsisted here; always, too, in respectability; never, so far as I have known, disgraced by a single unworthy member; but seldom or never, on the other hand, after the first two generations, performing any memorable deed, or so much as putting forward a claim to public notice. Gradually, they have sunk almost out of sight; as old houses, here and there about the streets, get covered half-way to the eaves by the accumulation of new soil. From father to son, for above a hundred years, they followed the sea; a grey-headed shipmaster, in each generation, retiring from the quarter-deck to the homestead, while a boy of fourteen took the hereditary place before the mast, confronting the salt spray and the gale which had blustered against his sire and grandsire. The boy, also in due time, passed from the forecastle to the cabin, spent a tempestuous manhood, and returned from his world-wanderings, to grow old, and die, and mingle his dust with the natal earth. This long connexion of a family with one spot, as its place of birth and burial, creates a kindred between the human being and the locality, quite independent of any charm in the scenery or moral circumstances that surround him. It is not love but instinct. The new inhabitant—who came himself from a foreign land, or whose father or grandfather came—has little claim to be called a Salemite; he has no conception of the oyster-like tenacity with which an old settler, over whom his third century is creeping, clings to the spot where his successive generations have been embedded. It is no matter that the place is joyless for him; that he is weary of the old wooden houses, the mud and dust, the dead level of site and sentiment, the chill east wind, and the chillest of social atmospheres;—all these, and whatever faults besides he may see or imagine, are nothing to the purpose. The spell survives, and just as powerfully as if the natal spot were an earthly paradise. So has it been in my case. I felt it almost as a destiny to make Salem my home; so that the mould of features and cast of character which had all along been familiar here—ever, as one representative of the race lay down in the grave, another assuming, as it were, his sentry-march along the main street—might still in my little day be seen and recognised in the old town. Nevertheless, this very sentiment is an evidence that the connexion, which has become an unhealthy one, should at last be severed. Human nature will not flourish, any more than a potato, if it be planted and re-planted, for too long a series of generations, in the same worn-out soil. My children have had other birth-places, and, so far as their fortunes may be within my control, shall strike their roots into unaccustomed earth.  On emerging from the Old Manse, it was chiefly this strange, indolent, unjoyous attachment for my native town that brought me to fill a place in Uncle Sam’s brick edifice, when I might as well, or better, have gone somewhere else. My doom was on me. It was not the first time, nor the second, that I had gone away—as it seemed, permanently—but yet returned, like the bad halfpenny, or as if Salem were for me the inevitable centre of the universe. So, one fine morning I ascended the flight of granite steps, with the President’s commission in my pocket, and was introduced to the corps of gentlemen who were to aid me in my weighty responsibility as chief executive officer of the Custom-House.  I doubt greatly—or, rather, I do not doubt at all—whether any public functionary of the United States, either in the civil or military line, has ever had such a patriarchal body of veterans under his orders as myself. The whereabouts of the Oldest Inhabitant was at once settled when I looked at them. For upwards of twenty years before this epoch, the independent position of the Collector had kept the Salem Custom-House out of the whirlpool of political vicissitude, which makes the tenure of office generally so fragile.
