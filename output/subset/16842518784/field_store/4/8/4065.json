Since the builder had artfully omitted all low branches, there was little chance of his knocking his head off.  Towards noon, he paused to rest at the little pool on the edge of the woods. He waved to a group of guards he saw peering at him across an open field of what looked very much like grass. One of the men ran over.  \"The Jursan envoy is back, Your Illustrious Sublimity.\"  Vyrtl sighed.  \"Tell General Wilkins to bring her here immediately.\"  He turned away and sat upon a flat stone beside the pool.  After a while, he noticed that the ground was liberally supplied with pebbles for casting into the water. He was watching the spreading ripples about fifteen minutes later when he heard approaching voices behind him.  A glance over his shoulder showed him Wilkins and two guards escorting the old woman. He turned away, tossing another pebble into the pool with a half-hearted motion of his arm.  When Wilkins coughed discreetly behind him, he told the aide and the guards to withdraw. He listened to the footsteps until he knew they were beyond range of ordinary conversation.  \"You are the same Daphne Foster?\" he asked, still facing the pool.  \"The same, Your Illustrious Sublimity.\"  \"Let us dispense with formality. Tell me how you did it.\"  \"It is simple ... in a way. But it requires the use of a not-so-simple instrument.\"  \"Such as I?\" he asked, apparently intent upon the water.  \"I did not mean Your Illustrious--I did not mean it that way. It is a little triumph of our Jursan technicians, which will shortly be at your disposal. I used it to force an illusion upon you.\"  \"And very cleverly, I admit. Do you have it with you?\"  \"Yes. It is compact. It merely operates upon the idea that other forces can be used to produce hypnosis besides lights, drugs, and soothing sounds.\"  \"Turn it on!\" ordered Vyrtl.         *       *       *       *       *  He waited a moment, then twisted around on the stone to face her. There was no sign of the woman he had seen crossing the field. Before him seemed to stand the black-haired, lithe girl.  The only change was in her eyes, which no longer smiled into his so provocatively.  _Funny_, thought Vyrtl. _When we actually were strangers, she seemed so intimate. Only now does she look at me so coldly._  \"You see?\" she said, and started to reach for some switch or button concealed by the jewel at her breast.  Vyrtl stopped her with a gesture.  \"You must also be skilled in the sciences of the mind,\" he remarked. \"What I mean is ... I suppose you never really looked like that?\"  She shook her head a trifle ruefully.  \"Not quite. Most of it is in your own imagination. We know a good deal about you, Your--\"  \"You deduced somehow what I would look for,\" interrupted Vyrtl, nodding. \"I can see how a study of the things I chose to have about me--paintings, statues, furnishings, even people--might yield keys to my preferences. You did remarkably well.\"  He tossed another pebble and stared at the ripples.  \"I suppose every man has his ideal of a woman,\" he said. \"I doubt that any man has _seen_ his absolute ideal--except me. I wonder if you know what it does to one?\"  He chose a flat pebble and sent it skipping across the surface with a vicious snap of his wrist. It bounced three ... four ... five times, and sank.  \"I presume,\" said Daphne Foster, breaking a tight little silence, \"that you will grant me time to set my affairs in order?\"  Vyrtl weighed a pebble in his hand.  \"You expect to be executed,\" he stated flatly.  \"Naturally, we knew all along that someone would have to pay for tricking you. The Emperor of Pollux must, after all, maintain his dignity.\"  Vyrtl wondered if he had detected a note of irony in the musical voice. He marveled anew at the pleasure of listening to her. But of course, he reminded himself, he heard his own imagined ideal of what a lovely woman's voice should be.  \"No,\" he said abruptly, swinging about. \"I am merely going to insist that you fulfill the terms of the agreement by remaining at my court. I want you near me from now on.\"  She blinked at that.  \"But, surely ... you must realize ... it is only an illusion!\" she protested.  \"As am I,\" said Vyrtl. \"A figurehead imprisoned in a maze of formalities and so-called pleasures.\"         *       *       *       *       *  He saw that she could not understand what could be wrong with his position.  \"Once, when I was very young,\" he said, \"I thought I would rule. But fourteen planets require a whole _council_ of co-ordinators! I gave up that idea and tried to enjoy myself.\"  She stared at him uncertainly. He waved a hand at the artificial forest.  \"It has been like that ever since. They fall all over themselves to devise new ways of getting my attention and to present pleasures and entertainment I am incapable of enjoying. I have more wealth than I can estimate, I sometimes forget which palace I am in, even my wives look alike by now.\"  \"I must sympathize with Your Illustrious Sublimity.\"  He flung her a hard stare.  \"Perhaps you ought! Even my generals and their soldiers have their dreams--of conquest or loot. The engineer who built this dome pictures himself famous and admired. Wilkins is proud of his influence, and other courtiers have visions of doing away with Wilkins and replacing him.\"  He stood up restlessly.  \"You will laugh at me, I know--but there is little enjoyment in life when every whim is catered to at a snap of one's fingers. What have I to _desire_?\"  \"I see.\" She nodded slowly. \"The old saying about the pleasure of anticipation outweighing that of attainment.\"  \"You should know. You Jursans and your scientific renaissance, your goal of contacting Terra again.\"  He beckoned to Wilkins and the two guards. They ran eagerly across the grass.  \"You see?\" he snorted. \"Sometimes I almost wish they would ignore me!\"  He looked at her and saw the blue eyes achieve their knowing, amused smile once more.  \"That's right,\" he said, smiling back. \"Now I shall have something to keep my thoughts from becoming dull and bored. A man needs some impossible dream for moments when he wants to relax.\"  Wilkins panted up, trying to look alert and willing.  \"The unattainable Lady Daphne will accompany us to our capital,\" said Vyrtl. \"Make the necessary arrangements.\"  He enjoyed the way his aide covered up a momentary bewilderment.  _No one else will ever, ever understand this_, he thought with an unaccustomed thrill of pleasure and amusement.         *       *       *       *       *"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32650"],["title","Some Personal Reminiscences of Service in the Cavalry of the Army of the Potomac (#1)"],["body","uard. Knowing the modesty of that gallant officer, I take the liberty of mentioning his name. Eighty-eight horses were left dead on the field. The celebrated charge of the Eighth Pennsylvania Cavalry at Chancellorsville is familiar to all; but this charge of the First Pennsylvania Cavalry even excelled that in boldness, for when the Eighth Pennsylvania Cavalry made its charge it was in column of fours and in the woods, and it came upon the enemy unexpectedly. But the First Pennsylvania cavalrymen at Cedar Mountain saw what was in their front: a clear, open field and death staring them in the face,--cannon in front of them and cannon to the left of them,--and theirs was a feat at arms not unlike the charge of the Earl of Cardigan and his six hundred, made immortal by Tennyson.[2]        [2] The charge of the Eighth Pennsylvania Cavalry was made       historical by General Pleasonton's official report after the       battle of Chancellorsville. Reports like that sometimes cover up       a multitude of blunders and give credit only to those who are       killed. They also sometimes make great newspaper generals of       their authors, and the millions who read the newspapers at home       thus get their impressions as to who are the great fighters at       the front.  We remained in the vicinity of the battle-ground of Cedar Mountain, taking up our old positions, until the 18th of August, when the great game of chess between Lee and Pope commenced, Lee trying to capture Washington before McClellan could transport his troops from the Peninsula to the defense of our capital, while we were trying to close the gaps in the mountains. Our cavalry did some sharp fighting during this backward movement of Pope's. But there was no opportunity for us to attack the enemy's cavalry in mass until we arrived, on the 20th, on the open plains to the south of Rappahannock Station. Here Bayard formed his squadrons for a general attack. The enemy advanced a brigade of cavalry upon us, and they were met by the First New Jersey, First Pennsylvania, First Rhode Island, and Second New York Cavalry Regiments, with sabres drawn. We drove them back to Culpeper, and this check of their cavalry caused their infantry columns to halt and go into position, while we moved leisurely back, giving our infantry and trains time to cross the several fords of the Rappahannock River.  A few nights afterwards there was a terrific storm of thunder, lightning, and rain. It was impossible to recognize a person an arm's length away, and yet we received orders to move rapidly up the river road to Sulphur Springs, and thence by way of Warrenton to Thoroughfare Gap. The storm, however, delayed us until the next morning, when we resumed our march, and reached Thoroughfare Gap on the evening of August 26, but too late by one hour, for Jackson had slipped through ahead of us. We captured about six hundred of his stragglers and a very important dispatch from Longstreet to him, informing him that he would be through early next morning. This information was sent to head-quarters, and General Rickett's division was sent to our support. Bayard's cavalry kept Longstreet's corps back for six hours, and they were no doubt long ones to Jackson, who was then at Manassas.  On the morning of August 28 my regiment took position between Bull Run bridge and Groveton. Being in the advance with my squadron, I was ordered to deploy as skirmishers and develop the enemy, who were soon found, for they opened a battery upon me, and this was, I think, the beginning of the great battle of Second Bull Run. My squadron remained in this position all that day, with instructions to keep a sharp lookout on Jackson's right and report results to General Reynolds. My squadron at this time numbered ninety-five men, all armed with carbines, revolvers, and sabres.  General Bayard received orders that evening to mass his cavalry on the open ground to the left of the Gainesville pike and prepare for a grand charge and night attack on Jackson's right flank. Bayard, knowing that my men were familiar with that flank, sent me orders to retire quietly and report to him at the Burnt Chimneys, near the Bull Run bridge. This having been done, we were taken along the flank of the brigade to the head of the column and were told what we were expected to do,--to lead the charge and strike directly for the enemy's artillery, destroy its usefulness, if possible, and come out at the point where we had been picketing during the day, while Bayard was to lead the brigade in person down the right and left centres of the main lines. The signal for this charge was to be three artillery shots over our heads at intervals of one minute each, and when the third shot was fired I was to move at a walk to within a short distance of the rebel skirmish line, then hurl my squadron in column of platoons upon the enemy, sweeping along their extreme right. Imagine the thoughts that passed through my mind,--home, mother, sisters, brothers, and sweetheart all jumbled in my head at once. The suspense was awful! The men were admonished to follow their leader, and if he should fall to continue on and carry out his orders. The first shot was fired; then came a long delay. Wondering what could be the cause of this, I rose in my saddle, looked to the rear, and found that all the supports had retired and that we had been left alone. Suddenly Bayard rode up to me and, with choked voice, said, \"Thank God, you are saved! The orders have been countermanded, and you can take up your old position over on the left.\" I must acknowledge that tears trickled down my cheeks while I was on the way to my old position. What would have been the result had this charge been made? Directly in our front, as we discovered next day, was a deep gully or washout, though Bayard had been assured that it was a clear, open field. Here would have been another \"sunken road\" as at Waterloo, and perhaps another Victor Hugo writing of the charge, while we poor souls would have been hurled to death, trampled beneath the hoofs of the horses of those who followed us.  On the afternoon of the last day of the battle of Second Bull Run I observed that the enemy were massing a large body of troops in front of our extreme left, and I sent several verbal messages to that effect by trustworthy non-commissioned officers to General Bayard, who was near General Pope. I began sending these messages between three and four o'clock, and my last one was to inform him that the enemy had placed four batteries of artillery in position, that I had counted twenty-eight sets of colors, that more troops were moving into position, and that if the enemy made an attack, they would strike the Pennsylvania Reserves on the left and rear. When the sergeant who carried this message returned, he told me that General Pope remarked to General Bayard, \"Oh, that officer don't know his business. He don't know what he is talking about. Tell the fool that those people he sees are General Porter's men forming on the right of the enemy.\" I felt very much annoyed at this, and I don't deny that I used some very strong language about my superior officer, though most of it was done mentally. However, I rode rapidly over to General Reynolds, informed him of the fact, and persuaded him to come and see for himself. One glance was sufficient for him. He dashed back to his division and changed front to the left to meet the attack. Those who were in the Pennsylvania Reserves at that time can testify that the movement to the left was hardly finished when the heavy column I had again and again reported burst upon them, crushing their left back upon and through our artillery, leaving the guns in the hands of the enemy. I have often wondered _who_ was the fool,--the general or the captain.  My squadron rode along the flank of this charging column of the enemy, and expended nearly all of its carbine ammunition upon it. They paid no more attention to us, however, than if we were so many gnats flying in the air. In my opinion the final repulse of the enemy was chiefly due to a small brigade of regular infantry. It seemed to me that every line that came in their front was wiped out. Their firing was done with coolness and precision; their commanding officer had them well in hand. It was a scene well worthy of the pencil of an artist; but we did not have that kind of people with us when such opportunities occurred. I crossed the Bull Run bridge with these regulars between sundown and dark. At that time the enemy seemed to be retiring very rapidly, as though they were retreating from the field. I thought at the time that we should have been pursuing them instead of retiring. But orders had to be obeyed.  I joined my regiment next morning near Centreville, my squadron having been held for picket duty that night near the bridge.  General Bayard and I had several conversations afterwards about what I have stated. He always cautioned me to be careful in my language about what I knew, as doubtless there would be an investigation concerning the battle, and he wanted me to corroborate him in case he should be called upon to testify before a court of inquiry. But the brave soldier was called to a higher court before his testimony could be taken, and until now I have remained silent upon the subject.  After the battle our cavalry brigade retired to the defenses of Washington, and remained there for six weeks, when we again took up the line of march, joining McClellan's army (which had recrossed the Potomac after Antietam) between the Bull Run Mountains and the Blue Ridge. We continued on in the advance, skirmishing and charging daily, and never halted until we arrived at Rappahannock Station, on a cold, stormy night in November, my squadron capturing a large picket post of the enemy and saving the railroad bridge. Here we received the news that McClellan had been relieved and Burnside placed in command of the Army of the Potomac. Soon we again"]]]
