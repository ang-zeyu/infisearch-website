Boulenger (1882:86, 381) went so far as to credit Schlegel as the author of the name _japonica_. The reason for this action is not known because Schlegel (in von Siebold, 1838:112) referred to this hylid only under the name \"Hyla arborea.\"   =Rana rugosa= Schlegel      _Rana rugosa_ Schlegel, Reptilia [Saurii et Batrachii], _in_ von       Siebold, Fauna Japonica, p. 110, pl. 3, figs. 3-4, 1838 (type       locality designated as Japan, probably near Nagasaki, by       Stejneger, Bull. U. S. Nat. Mus., 58:123, July 22, 1907).      _Specimens examined_ (26).--Central National Forest, near     Pup´yong-ni, 13 (KU), 1 (UMMZ); 2 mi. S Ch´orwon, 4 (KU); 2 mi. E     Hoengsong, 3 (KU); 1 mi. NW Oho-ri, 1 (KU); 5 mi. ESE Seoul, 1 (KU);     6 mi. E Seoul, 3 (UMMZ).  _Remarks._--_Rana rugosa_ was associated with _Rana nigromaculata_ and _Rana amurensis coreana_ at all localities where the species was taken save at 2 mi. E Hoengsong, where _R. a. coreana_ was not observed. Three specimens of _R. rugosa_ were collected among grasses and reeds in water along the edge of Ch´orwon Reservoir, 2 mi. S Ch´orwon, where they were difficult to find in the thick vegetation even though their low, soft calls were heard; the specimen from 1 mi. NW Oho-ri was found in a rice field. Otherwise, habitats recorded indicate a preference for small, fast-flowing streams, especially in wooded valleys. On one occasion, individuals were found trapped in cement-walled pits about old ruins on a wooded hillside in the Central National Forest. The earliest and latest dates of capture among our specimens are May 15 and November 6. In addition to the localities listed above, the species was observed 4 mi. W Ch´ungju.  _R. rugosa_ may have an extensive breeding season as suggested by the variation in size of frogs collected or observed in 1954. Of nine frogs obtained on May 29, five ranged in snout-vent length from 26 to 28, and four from 42 to 54. Three specimens collected on October 9 measured 39, 41, and 55, and two obtained on November 6 measured 25 and 37.   =Rana nigromaculata= Hallowell      _Rana nigromaculata_ Hallowell, Proc. Acad. Nat. Sci. Philadelphia,       [12]:500 (for 1860), 1861 (type locality, Simoda, Japan).      _Specimens examined_ (47).--Central National Forest, near     Pup´yong-ni, 6 (KU); 2 mi. S Ch´orwon, 5 (KU); 4 mi. W Ch´ungju, 2     (KU); 7 mi. W Ch´ungju, 1 (KU); 2 mi. E Hoengsong, 1 (KU); 8 mi. SW     Kunsan, 1 (KU); 1 mi. NW Oho-ri, 5 (KU); 5 mi. ENE Pusan, 2 (KU); 5     mi. ESE Seoul, 9 (KU); 6 mi. E Seoul, 3 (KU), 10 (UMMZ); 6 mi. NNE     Sogwi-ri, Cheju Do, 2 (KU).      _Description._--Back brownish or grayish (greenish in life), having     few, indistinct or well-defined, dark blotches, or extensive     blackish areas (representing fusion of markings); pale, middorsal     stripe (pale green, buff or yellowish in life) from snout to anus,     sometimes as wide as interorbital width, but indistinct or lacking     when pattern on back absent; blackish bar often present behind     tympanum; posterior surface of thigh mottled; underparts pale yellow     to whitish, sometimes having a few dusky marks on throat;     longitudinal ridges between dorsolateral folds indistinct in some     small frogs; largest female and male having respective snout-vent     lengths of 100 and 70.  _Remarks._--_Rana nigromaculata_ is the most abundant ranid in central Korea and, in a general way, the ecological equivalent of _Rana pipiens_ in temperate North America. The species is associated with most aquatic habitats, from rocky streams to rice fields and large impoundments. In the vicinity of Seoul the din of large breeding congresses was heard more or less continuously from mid-April to mid-May. Large numbers of juveniles (approximately one inch long) were noticed first on July 8 and were present thereafter for about three weeks, being commonest in standing water after heavy rains or during prolonged showers. These data and the different sizes of individuals collected at the same time suggest either variable growth or, more probably, an extensive breeding season. Our earliest and latest dates of collection are April 16 and October 7. The Korean name for \"frog,\" most often applied to _R. nigromaculata_, sounds something like \"keg-oh-ree.\" The call is a prolonged, raspy, staccato croak, sometimes with a rising inflection at the end.  In addition to the localities listed above, the species was observed 5 mi. W Kwangju and 3 mi. S Osan.  Despite a high degree of individual variation, _Rana nigromaculata_ seemingly varies geographically as well; some subspecies probably should be recognized, but the species as a whole has never been thoroughly studied systematically. The division of _R. nigromaculata_ into three subspecies by Schmidt (1927:563-567) was considered untenable by Fang and Chang (1931:95-98), and it has been regarded by most recent authors as a variable, monotypic species.  The named subspecies _R. n. chosenica_ (Okada, 1931:89, with type locality at Seoul, and geographically restricted to Korea) was considered a subspecies of _Rana plancyi_ by Shannon (1956:36). The most trenchant characters of _plancyi_ seem to be the wide dorsolateral folds, the uniform greenish dorsum, the presence of dermal pustules on the back between the dorsolateral folds, and the lack of a mottled pattern on the posterior surface of the thigh. Among our specimens of _R. nigromaculata_, the width of the dorsolateral folds is variable, a uniform greenish dorsum is found only in large males, dermal pustules are mixed with ridges in only one male (KU 38733), and all have a spotted or mottled pattern on the posterior surface of the thigh. All of our specimens having an indistinct pattern on the back, or lacking a pattern, are males and resemble the photographs of males published by Moriya (1954: pl. I, fig. 5) and Liu (1936: pl. IV, figs. 1-2); juveniles of both sexes and large females have contrasting patterns.  None of our frogs seems, therefore, clearly referable to the species _plancyi_, although some characters are suggestive of _plancyi_. Moriya (_op. cit.:19_), who studied variation of _R. nigromaculata_ in Japan, noted that one of the most distinct populations there (_R. n. brevipoda_) resembled _Rana plancyi_. Ting (1939) discovered that _nigromaculata_ and _plancyi_ were cross-fertile and raised hybrid larvae through metamorphosis. Pope and Boring (1940) suggested hybridization between the two species in eastern China, and the above mentioned facts suggest to us the possibility of hybridization in other regions.   =Rana amurensis coreana= Okada      _Rana temporaria coreana_ Okada, Annot. Zool. Japon., 11:140       (footnote), July 25, 1927, _nomen nudum_.      _Rana temporaria coreana_ Okada, Jour. Chosen Nat. Hist. Soc, 6:19,       pl. 1, fig. 7, 1928 (type locality, Keijo [= Seoul], Korea).      _Rana amurensis coreana_, Shannon, Herpetologica, 12:38, March 6,       1956.      _Specimens examined_ (9).--Central National Forest, near     Pup´yong-ni, 1 (KU); 2 mi. S Ch´orwon, 1 (KU); 4 mi. W Ch´ungju, 1     (KU); 1 mi. N Oho-ri, 1 (KU); 5 mi. ESE Seoul, 3 (KU); Yongp´yong, 2     (KU).  _Remarks._--One individual of _R. a. coreana_ (KU 38698) and one of _Rana temporaria dybowskii_ (KU 38715) were collected on May 29 along a stream in the Central National Forest in association with _R. rugosa_ and _R. nigromaculata_. Specimens of _coreana_ from the vicinity of Seoul were found in rice fields. The earliest date of collection was April 13 at Yongp´yong. Our largest specimen of _coreana_ measured 47 in snout-vent length.  Because _R. a. coreana_ and _Rana temporaria dybowskii_ are sympatric in central Korea and closely resemble one another, the two species were not distinguished in the field and the following observations may pertain to either (or both) species. Wood frogs were observed 2 mi. E Songdong-ni on July 12 in paddies (rice fields) along with individuals of _Hyla arborea_, _Rana rugosa_, and _Rana nigromaculata_. At Chip´o-ri on April 6, individuals (probably _R. t. dybowskii_) were seen in a seepage pool from an abandoned rice field; _R. nigromaculata_ also was seen there. Six or seven egg masses (some having small tadpoles) were observed in the shallow water, but it was not certain to which species the eggs belonged. Completely metamorphosed young (probably _R. a. coreana_) were first seen 1 mi. N Oho-ri on June 9. At Taehoesan-ni on November 12, several sluggish frogs were seen in a small pool that was covered by a thin layer of ice.  On September 26 in the Central National Forest, many wood frogs of various sizes were observed. _R. amurensis_ and _R. temporaria_ probably have extended breeding seasons that correspond to those of _R. rugosa_ and _R. nigromaculata_. Judging from our observations, _amurensis_ prefers the proximity of water, whereas _temporaria_ may occur some distance from permanent water.  In our specimens, _R. amurensis coreana_ differs from _R. temporaria dybowskii_ in having (1) smaller maximal size, (2) more slender body, (3) shorter legs, (4) incompletely webbed toes, (5) no mottling or barring on lips, (6) no contrasting barred pattern on hind legs, (7) dark brown stripes (usually) between dorsolateral folds, (8) a dark brown, linear mark below canthus, and (9) an immaculate ventral surface. Two additional distinguishing characters, which we found difficult to evaluate, are the nearly straight, dorsolateral folds, and lack of vocal sacs or ostia in males of _R. a. coreana_ (Shannon, 1956:38). Some of the differences between the two species were illustrated by Okada, 1931:107, fig. 48, _R. temporaria temporaria_ [=_R. t. dybowskii_] and 123, fig. 54, _R. temporaria coreana_ [=_R. amurensis coreana_].   =Rana temporaria"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34954"],["title","Systematic Status of the Colubrid Snake, Leptodeira discolor Günther (#1)"],["body","generic characters as scale pits and nature of the hemipenis is not clear, these characters must, of necessity, be utilized in attempting to ascertain the relationships of _Tantalophis_ to other colubrid snakes. Assuming that the primary divisions of the American colubrids into subfamilies based on the nature of the sulcus spermaticus and the presence or absence of hypapophyses on the posterior vertebrae have some reality, _Tantalophis_ must be placed in the subfamily Xenodontinae comprising genera chiefly South American in their distribution, but with several genera in Middle America and a few in North America and the West Indies. In order to limit the number of genera to be compared with _Tantalophis_, only those xenodontines having apical pits and bifurcate hemipenis are considered. These include _Cyclagras_, _Drepanoides_, _Hypsirhynchus_, _Ialtris_, _Leimadophis_, _Pseudablabes_, _Siphlophis_, _Tachymenis_, _Tomodon_, and _Trypanurgos_. Aside from differences in scutellation, _Leimadophis_, _Siphlophis_, and _Trypanurgos_ have the heads of the hemipenes terminating in a disc, and _Ialtris_ has a plicate hemipenis. _Tomodon_ has basal spines on the hemipenis. The hemipenes of the other genera have proximal folds, distal spines, and distal calyces, not greatly unlike the condition found in _Tantalophis_. Of these, _Cyclagras_, _Hypsirhynchus_, and _Pseudablabes_ have round pupils and certain differences in scutellation. _Drepanoides_ and _Tachymenis_ have elliptical pupils like those of _Tantalophis_, but _Tachymenis_ has only one apical pit, and _Drepanoides_ has one apical pit or none. In the above characters no especially close relationship between _Tantalophis_ and any one of these genera is apparent.  If the characteristics usually employed in distinguishing and relating genera are ignored and other more subjective criteria are used, the relationships of _Tantalophis_ still remain obscure. Of the xenodontine genera _Tantalophis_ approaches _Leimadophis_ in general physiognomy; perhaps it represents an early divergent stock of _Leimadophis_ that has undergone radical changes in the hemipenis and other characters. On the other hand, if the nature of the hemipenis is of no importance in defining supergeneric groups of colubrid snakes, _Tantalophis_ may have its relationships with _Leptodeira_ and _Hypsiglena_. Although herpetologists have been working intensively on American colubrids for many decades, the relationships of the majority of the groups are not well understood. Until the hemipenes and skulls of all of the forms have been studied and compared, and the evolutionary significance has been determined for the characters of the hemipenes, dentition, and apical pits, our knowledge of the relationships of these snakes will be incomplete.  _Remarks._--The individual on which this paper is based is the only specimen of the species with definite locality data. It is from a locality six miles southeast of Tamazulápam in northwestern Oaxaca. This town lies at an elevation of about 6500 feet in the upper reaches of the Balsas Basin, an arid interior valley that expands in its upper end to form a broad basin of rolling and dissected terrain ranging from about 4000 to 6800 feet in elevation. The countryside around Tamazulápam is arid and supports plants of the genera _Prosopis_, _Acacia_, _Ipomoea_, and _Cassia_, and also columnar cacti. Oaks and pines grow on the limestone hills rising above the rolling valley. _Tantalophis_ may be endemic to the Balsas Basin, as are many other species of reptiles. However, if the snake has its relatives to the south in lower Central America and South America, such a distribution seems unlikely, even for an apparent relict.  _Acknowledgments._--For permission to study and report on this specimen I am indebted to Dr. E. Raymond Hall and Mr. John M. Legler. I am grateful to Dr. Laurence C. Stuart for many helpful suggestions and to Dr. Norman E.
