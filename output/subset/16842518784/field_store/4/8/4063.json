The silky webs flashed into nothing as the flames hit them, but they wouldn't support the fire, and other webs streamed down behind the two. They had to burn another mattress to get back with a few cases of food.  Then we dug a well under the floor of our tent. Hit water within a few feet. But when we cut through the screen floor it cost us sentry duty. We had to have one person awake all night long to stamp on the spiders that slipped in around the edge of the well.  Through all of this Cleveland has been out on his feet. He has just stood and stared out through the screen all day. We had to force him to eat. He didn't snap out of it until this morning.  Sparks couldn't stand our radio silence any longer, so he talked Sellers into helping him make a dash for the gas drums on the beach. They set fire to two mattresses and disappeared into the tunnel of burned webs that tangled and caved in behind them.  When they were gone, Cleveland suddenly came out of his trance and put a hand on my shoulder. I thought for a moment he was going to jump me, but his eyes were calm. He said, \"Well, Fred, are you convinced now that we've been attacked?\"  I said, \"It makes no sense to me at all. Why these little flies?\"  Cleve said, \"They couldn't have done better so easily. They studied our ecology well. They saw that our greatest potential enemy was the insect population, and the most vicious part of it was the spider. _Tabanidae viridis_ was not sent just to plague us with horsefly bites. Tabby was sent to multiply and feed the arachnids. There are durable species in all climates. And if our botanist were still alive he could explain in detail how long our plant life can last under this spider infestation.  \"Look for yourself,\" he said pointing outside. \"Not only are the regular pollenizing insects doomed, but the density of those webs will choke out even wind pollinated grains.\"  He stared down our shallow well hole and stamped on a small, black, flat spider that had slithered under the screening. \"I suppose you realize the spiders got the others. Down here in the tropics the big varieties could do it by working together. Sellers and Sparks won't return. Sounds like they got through all right, but they'll be bitten so badly they won't try to get back.\"  And even as he spoke we heard one of the aircraft engines start up. The sound was muffled as under a bed quilt.  Cleve said, \"I don't blame them. I'd rather die in the sun, too. The beach should be fairly clear of webs. We've got one mattress left. What do you say?\"  He's standing there now holding the mattress with the ticking sticking out. I don't think one torch will get us through. But it will be worth a try for one more look at the sun."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32623"],["title","Geographic Variation in the Pocket Gopher, Cratogeomys castanops, in Coahuila, (#1)"],["body","this area the species occurs only locally if at all.  A specimen taken near the Río Grande in Coahuila, opposite Samuels, Texas, and assigned to _Cratogeomys castanops clarkii_ by Nelson and Goldman (op. cit.:140), has been examined by us and is referable to _convexus_. This specimen is typical of _convexus_ except for the lesser inflation of the mastoid bullae and tympanic bullae. Conspicuous differences between _convexus_ and _angusticeps_ indicate that the Río Grande is an effective barrier to passage by these rodents.  _Specimens examined._--Total, 14, all from Coahuila: Río Grande, 17 mi. S Dryden, Terrell Co., Texas, 6; Río Grande, opposite Samuels, Val Verde Co., Texas, 1 (BSC); Villa Acuña, 5; Cañon del Cochino, 21 mi. E and 16 mi. N Piedra Blanca, 1; 11 mi. W Hda. San Miguel, 1.    +Cratogeomys castanops bullatus+ new subspecies   _Type._--Female, adult, skin and skull, No. 48498, Univ. Kansas Mus. Nat. Hist., 2 mi. S and 6-1/2 mi. E Nava, 810 ft., Coahuila; 16 June 1952; obtained by Robert J. Russell, original number 276.  _Distribution._--Desert lowlands of northeastern Coahuila, from the Río Grande to as far southwestward as the Río Sabinas (see fig. 1).  _Diagnosis._--Body medium for the species (see tables 1 and 2); tail long; hind foot small; upper parts Light Ochraceous-Buff (in summer pelage) and Orange-Buff (in winter pelage), bases of hairs Plumbeous; underparts white to pale buffy; skull small, broad and slightly convex in dorsal outline; zygomata widely flaring; palate short; rostrum short; nasals short; mastoid and tympanic bullae inflated; basioccipital with lateral edges parallel; maxillary teeth small.  _Comparisons._--From _Cratogeomys castanops convexus_, found to the north, _bullatus_ differs in: Hind foot shorter; skull much broader in relation to length; rostrum narrower but, relative to length of skull, wider; tympanic bullae slightly more inflated; incisors and maxillary teeth smaller. From topotypes of _Cratogeomys castanops angusticeps_, found across the Río Grande and upstream from localities where _bullatus_ is known to occur, _bullatus_ differs in: Body slightly smaller; color paler, especially on sides; skull shorter and broader; rostrum shorter and broader; nasals shorter; mastoid and tympanic bullae more inflated; maxillary teeth smaller. For comparisons of _bullatus_ with the subspecies of _C. castanops_ found to the west and south, see accounts of the subspecies to follow.  _Remarks._--_Cratogeomys castanops bullatus_ in small size resembles _C. c. tamaulipensis_ Nelson and Goldman of the lower Río Grande Valley in Tamaulipas, but the two differ markedly in cranial features. _Cratogeomys c. bullatus_ is smaller than _convexus_ but these two subspecies resemble each other in color and cranial characters. Both have an arched skull, inflated mastoid and tympanic bullae, short nasals, and a short rostrum. Comparison of _bullatus_ with _angusticeps_, which occurs across the Río Grande but not directly opposite the range of _bullatus_, indicates that these two subspecies are less closely related than _bullatus_ is to _tamaulipensis_ and _convexus_.  _Cratogeomys castanops bullatus_ is especially common in sandy soils in the vicinity of Nava where the mounds were in fallow irrigated fields and other open places between extensive live oak thickets. South and west of the Río Grande the animals were less abundant and lived in heavier soils usually as individuals or in small groups. Specimens were taken at elevations from as low as 800 feet to as high as 2,000 feet.  _Specimens examined._--Total, 24, from: 2 mi. S and 6-1/2 mi. E Nava, 810 ft., 2; 2 mi. S and 12 mi.

Kansas Mus. Nat. Hist., Don Martin, 800 ft., Coahuila; 19 August 1949; obtained by W. Kim Clark, original number 1034.  _Distribution._--Extreme northeastern Coahuila from the vicinity of Presa Don Martin southward into northwestern Neuvo León in the valley of the Río Salado and its tributaries at least as far south as the vicinity of Vallecillo (see fig. 1).  _Diagnosis._--Body large for species (see tables 1 and 2); hind foot short; upper parts Apricot Buff (in fresh summer pelage) and Salmon-Buff strongly mixed with black (in fresh winter pelage); underparts Light Ochraceous-Buff; skull large, especially in females, and broad; zygomatic arches widely flaring; palate long; rostrum broad; nasals long; mastoid and tympanic bullae not conspicuously inflated; incisors narrow; maxillary teeth large.  _Comparisons._--From _Cratogeomys castanops bullatus_ found to the north, _ustulatus_ differs in: Body larger; tail shorter; upper parts darker, more rufous and less buffy; skull larger, especially in palate, nasals, and rostrum; zygomata more widely flaring; tympanic bullae less inflated; incisors slightly larger; maxillary teeth larger. From topotypes of _Cratogeomys castanops tamaulipensis_ found to the southeast, _ustulatus_ differs in: Body larger; upper parts, in winter pelage, darker, more rufous and less buffy; underparts paler; skull larger, especially in palate, rostrum and nasals; zygomata more widely flaring; tympanic bullae more inflated; pterygoids larger; basioccipital narrower, its sides parallel instead of convex; maxillary teeth smaller. From _Cratogeomys castanops subsimus_, found to the southwest, _ustulatus_ differs in: Tail shorter; hind foot smaller; upper parts darker, more rufous and less pinkish-buff; skull shorter; zygomata less widely flaring; palate shorter; rostrum averaging slightly narrower; nasals shorter; incisors narrower; maxillary teeth slightly smaller. For comparison of _ustulatus_ with the subspecies of _C. castanops_ to the southwest, see account of that subspecies to follow.  _Remarks._--_Cratogeomys castanops ustulatus_ is a large-sized pocket gopher with a relatively larger, skull. In size o£ skull, _ustulatus_ is exceeded only by _C. c. subsimus_ found beyond the mountains in the southern part of Coahuila. In size, _ustulatus_ differs so markedly from _bullatus_ that the two can be distinguished easily by this feature alone. The skull of _C. c. convexus_ approaches that of _ustulatus_ in size, but is smaller in all respects, save breadth of rostrum.  This pocket gopher is found commonly along the Río Salado and its watershed. Fallow cotton fields in the vicinity of Anahuac [= Rodríques], Nuevo León, are preferred living places. This subspecies was found at elevations as high as 1000 feet and as low as 600 feet.  _Specimens examined._--Total, 10, from: Don Martin, 800 ft., 5; _base of Don Martin Dam_, 2; _2 mi. SE Don Martin Dam, along Río Salado_, 2; 5 mi. SE Don Martin, 1.  _Records from Nuevo León._--Total, 14, from: 9 mi. N and 2 mi. W Anahuac [= Rodríques], 1; 4 mi. N and 1 mi. W Anahuac [= Rodríques], 5; 3 mi. N Lampazos, 4; 1 mi. N Vallecillo, 1000 ft., 1; Vallecillo, 20 mi. S Río Salado, 1000 ft., 3.    +Cratogeomys castanops jucundus+ new subspecies   _Type._--Female, adult, skin and skull; No. 56603, Univ. Kansas Mus. Nat. Hist.; Hermanas, 1205 ft., Coahuila; 5 December 1953; obtained by Robert W. Dickerman, original number 2051.  _Distribution._--Arid plains and broad intermontane valleys of east-central Coahuila (see fig. 1).  _Diagnosis._--Body largest for the species (see table 1); tail long; hind foot large; upper parts in winter pelage Ochraceous-Buff, in summer pelage Antimony Yellow; underparts Pale Ochraceous-Buff; skull medium in size, broad; zygomata moderately flaring; palate medium in length; rostrum broad; nasals moderately long; maxillary teeth small.  _Comparisons._--From _Cratogeomy castanops ustulatus_, found to the east, jucundus differs in: Body larger; tail longer; hind foot larger; upper parts paler, more ochraceous and less rufous; skull averaging smaller; zygomata slightly less expanded laterally; palate and nasals shorter; squamosal breadth less; mastoid bullae less inflated, especially in females; rostrum slightly narrower; maxillary tooth-row shorter. From topotypes of _Cratogeomys castanops tamaulipensis_, found to the southeast, _jucundus_ differs in: Body larger; tail longer; hind foot smaller; upper parts, in winter pelage, paler, more ochraceous and less rufous; skull larger; zygomata more widely flaring; palate longer; rostrum broader; tympanic bullae more inflated; basioccipital with sides parallel instead of convex; maxillary teeth smaller. From _Cratogeomy castanops excelsus_, found to the southwest, _jucundus_ differs in: Body larger; hind foot averaging larger; upper parts darker, more ochraceous, and less buffy; underparts darker, more buffy and less whitish; skull slightly smaller; zygomata less widely flaring, especially in females; palate shorter; nasals shorter; squamosal breadth less; mastoid bullae more inflated; incisors narrower. From _Cratogeomys castanops subsimus_, found to the south, _jucundus_ differs in: Body larger; tail shorter; hind foot shorter; upper parts paler, more ochraceous and less yellowish; skull smaller; zygomata less widely expanded laterally; palate and nasals shorter; rostrum narrower; squamosal breadth less; maxillary tooth-row shorter. From _Cratogeomys castanops bullatus_, found to the north, _jucundus_ differs in: Body larger; tail averaging longer; hind foot larger; color of upper parts more ochraceous and less rufous; underparts darker, more buffy and less whitish; skull larger, especially in length, in width across zygomata, in lengths of palate, rostrum and nasals; mastoid and tympanic bullae less inflated; squamosal breadth greater.  _Remarks._--_Cratogeomys castanops jucundus_ is large, exceeding subsimus in"]]]
