Baby Roseli did not agree with the cuckoo. She wanted to stay up and play with Bello, and hear the robin sing, but Leneli sat down beside the crib, and while Mother Adolf milked the goats she sang over and over again an old song.   \"Sleep, baby, sleep!   Thy father watches the sheep,   Thy mother is shaking the dreamland tree   And down falls a little dream on thee.   Sleep, baby, sleep!\"    \"Sleep, baby, sleep!   The large stars are the sheep,   The little stars are the lambs, I guess,   And the silver moon is the shepherdess.   Sleep, baby, sleep!\"  Over and over she sang it, until at last the heavy lids closed over the blue eyes. Then she crept quietly down the creaking stairs in the dark, and ate her bread and cheese and drank her soup by candle-light with her father and mother, Seppi and Fritz, all seated about the kitchen table.  By nine o'clock the room was once more silent and deserted, the little mouse was creeping quietly from his hole in the wall, and Bello lay by the door asleep with his nose on his paws. High over Mt. Pilatus the moon sailed through the star-lit sky, bathing the old gray farm-house in silver light and playing hide and seek with shadows on the snow-capped peaks.  \"Cuckoo,\" called the tiny wooden cuckoo nine times, and at once the bells in the village steeple answered him. \"That's as it should be,\" ticked the cuckoo. \"That church-bell is really very intelligent. Let me see; to-morrow morning I must wake the roosters at three, and the sun at four, and the family must be up by five. I'll just turn in and get a wink of sleep myself while I can,\" and he popped into the clock ones more and shut the door.     II. THE TWINS LEARN A NEW TRADE  THE TWINS LEARN A NEW TRADE   At five o'clock the next morning Father and Mother Adolf were already up, and the cuckoo woke Fritz, but though he shouted five times with all his might and main, neither Seppi nor Leneli stirred in their sleep.  \"Fritz, go wake the Twins,\" said Mother Adolf, when he came to the door of the shed where she was milking the goats. \"Only don't wake the baby. I want her to sleep as long as she will.\"  \"Yes, Mother,\" said Fritz dutifully, and he was off at once, leaping up the creaky stairs three steps at a time.  He went first to Leneli's bed and tickled her toes. She drew up her knees and slept on. Then he went to Seppi's bed, and when shaking and rolling over failed to rouse him, he took him by one leg and pulled him out of bed. Seppi woke up with a roar and cast himself upon Fritz, and in a moment the two boys were rolling about on the floor, yelling like Indians. The uproar woke Leneli, and the baby too, and Mother Adolf, hearing the noise, came running from the goat-shed just in time to find Seppi sitting on top of Fritz beating time on his stomach to a tune which he was singing at the top of his lungs. The baby was crowing with delight as she watched the scuffle from Leneli's arms.  Mother Adolf gazed upon this lively scene with dismay. Then she picked Seppi off Fritz's stomach and gazed sternly at her oldest son. \"Fritz,\" said she, \"I told you to be quiet and not wake the baby.\"  \"I was quiet,\" said Fritz, sitting up. \"I was just as quiet as I could be, but they wouldn't wake up that way, so I had to pull Seppi out of bed; there was no other way to get him up.\" He looked up at his mother with such honest eyes that in spite of herself her lips twitched and then she smiled outright.  \"I should have known better than to send such a great overgrown pup of a boy as you on such an errand,\" she said. \"Bello would have done it better. Next time I shall send him.  \"And now, since you are all awake, I will tell you the great news that Father told me last night. He has been chosen by the commune to take the herds of the village up to the high alps to be gone all summer. He will take Fritz with him to guard the cattle while he makes the cheese. There is no better cheese-maker in all the mountains than your father, and that is why the commune chose him,\" she finished proudly.  More than anything else in the world, every boy in that part of Switzerland longs to go with the herds to the high mountain pastures for the summer, and Fritz was so delighted that he turned a somersault at once to express his feelings. When he was right side up again, a puzzled look came over his face, and he said, \"Who will take care of our own goats?\"  \"Ah,\" answered his mother, and she sighed a little. \"There is no one but Seppi and Leneli. Together they must fill your place, and you, Fritz, must take them with you to-day up the mountain to learn the way and begin their work.\"  \"To-day! This very day?\" screamed the Twins. They had never been up to the goat-pastures in their lives, and it was a most exciting event.  Then Leneli thought of her mother. She flung her arms about her neck. \"But who will stay with you, dear Mother?\" she cried. \"All day you will be alone, with everything to do and no one to speak to but the baby.\"  \"Yes,\" sighed the mother, \"that is true. It will be a long, lonely summer for me, but there is no other way, so we must each do our part bravely and not complain. It is good fortune that Father and Fritz will both be earning money in the alps, and, with wise old Bello to help you, you will soon be as good goatherds as your brother. Come, now, hurry and eat your breakfasts, for the goats are already milked and impatient to be gone.\"  She took Roseli in her arms and disappeared down the stairs, and when, a few moments later, the Twins and Fritz came into the kitchen, she had their breakfast of bread and milk ready for them, and their luncheon of bread and cheese wrapped in a clean white cloth for Fritz to put in his pocket.  Father Adolf came back from the garden, where he had been hoeing potatoes, to see the little procession start away for the hills. First came the goats, frisking about in the fresh morning air and jingling all their bells. Then came Bello, looking very important, then Fritz with a cock's feather in his cap and his little horn and his cup slung over his shoulder, and last of all the Twins.  \"It's a long way, my children,\" said Mother Adolf, as she kissed them good-bye. \"Your legs will get tired, but you must climb on just the same. If every one stopped when he was tired, the world's work would never be done. Learn the way carefully and remember always to pray if any danger comes. You are very near the good God on the mountain, and He will take care of you if you ask Him, never fear.\"  \"Obey Fritz,\" said Father Adolf, \"and do not stray off by yourselves. Stay always with Fritz and the goats.\"  \"We will,\" cried the Twins, and away they ran to join their brother, who was already some little distance ahead of them. They turned as the path rounded the great cliff where the echoes lived, and the Twins waved their hands, while Fritz played his merry little tune on the horn. Then the rocks hid them from view, and the long climb began in earnest.  It was many rough uphill miles to the alps where the goats were pastured, and the stout little legs ached with weariness long before they reached the patches of green grass which were reserved for them. On the way up they passed fields where cows were grazing, and Bello had hard work to keep the goats in the path, but these pastures were only for cows, and goats were not allowed in them. For two hours they climbed steadily up and up, following a mountain path that led sometimes beside a rushing brook, sometimes along the edges of dizzy precipices, and always among rocks with wonderful views of distant snow-capped peaks above them and green, green valleys below.  At last, when it seemed to the weary children that they could not go another step, they came out upon a high pasture, where Fritz called a halt. The goats leaped joyfully forward, snatching greedy mouthfuls of the rich green grass which grew among the rocks. Bello flopped heavily down on a flat stone with his tongue hanging out, and Fritz and the Twins rolled over on their backs on a soft carpet of grass to rest.  Almost at once Seppi said, \"I'm hungry.\"  \"So 'm I,\" said Leneli.  \"You'll be hungry all the time up here,\" said Fritz encouragingly. \"It's the air.\"  \"Let's eat,\" urged Seppi.  Fritz took the package of luncheon from his pocket and opened it.  \"It looks very small. It looks a great deal smaller than it did at home,\" said Leneli. \"I wonder why?\"  \"You are hungrier now than you were then,\" said Fritz.  \"I could eat it all myself,\" said Seppi.  \"But you won't,\" laughed Fritz; \"I'll see to that.\" He divided the bread and cheese into three equal portions and handed one to each of the Twins. The third he put in his own pocket. \"Now I don't care what you do with yours,\" he said; \"only, if you eat it all now, you'll be hungry enough to browse with the goats before it's time to go home. Better take just a bite and a drink of water and eat more by and by.\"  Seppi looked hungrily at his portion and took a bite. Then he just couldn't stop, and before he knew it his whole luncheon was gone and it was only nine o'clock in the morning!  Leneli took two bites of hers, and then, wrapping it carefully in the piece of cloth, placed it high up on an overhanging rock out of the way of temptation. Then, while Fritz was teaching Seppi all the tricks of a goat-boy's trade, she found a soft patch of grass all spangled with blue gentians and fell asleep with her head on her arm. She slept"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3497"],["title","The Swiss Twins (#2)"],["body"," some time, and Fritz and Seppi, seeing how tired she was, did not disturb her.  She was roused at last by the tinkling of a goat-bell almost over her head, and woke up just in time to see her luncheon, cloth and all, disappearing into the mouth of Nanni, the brown goat! Poor Leneli screamed with dismay, and Fritz and Seppi, thinking perhaps she had hurt herself, came dashing to her side. Leneli was boiling with rage. She could only point at Nanni, who stood calmly out of reach above them with the last scrap of cloth dangling from her lips.  \"You wretched, black-hearted pig of a goat!\" she screamed, stamping her foot. \"You've eaten every bit of my lunch, and I'd only taken two little teeny bites! Oh, I wish I'd eaten it all like that greedy Seppi!\"  Fritz and Seppi were sorry, but when they saw the goat looking down at Leneli so calmly while she stormed and scolded below, they rolled over on the ground helpless with laughter.  \"It's all very well for you to laugh, sniffed Leneli; you've both got your lunches,\" and she went away quite sulkily and sat down on a stone by herself. Bello came and sat beside her and licked her hand.  Fritz had to dash away just then after a straying goat, but he was soon back again with his luncheon in his hand. \"Here,\" he said, \"you can have some of my bread and cheese.\"  \"Oh, Fritzi,\" said Leneli gratefully, \"you are as good and kind as that goat is bad, but I'm going to take only a teeny mouthful, just to keep me from starving!\"  \"All right,\" said Fritz, holding the slice of bread for her to bite. \"To-morrow we'll ask Mother to put up more bread and cheese, and if you get hungry again, you can milk old Nanni herself and get even with her that way.\"  \"But I don't know how to milk,\" said Leneli with her mouth full.  \"It's time you learned then,\" said Fritz briskly. \"You've seen Mother do it over and over again. Come, I'll teach you.\"  Nanni, the goat, had leaped down from her high perch, and was now taking a drink from a little sparkling mountain rill which flowed through the pasture.  \"Come along,\" said Fritz. \"There's no time like the present,\" and, taking his cup in his hand, he started toward her.  Leneli hung back a little. \"Nanni is the naughtiest goat in the whole flock,\" she said resentfully. \"If it weren't for getting my lunch back, I wouldn't try to milk her.\"  It may be that Nanni heard it and was offended, or it may be that she knew that she had no milk to give them so early in the morning. Anyway, she made up her mind she would not be bothered at that time of day, so as fast as they came near her, she walked on a few steps, and by the time they had reached that spot she had moved farther still.  \"We mustn't frighten her,\" said Fritz, \"It's bad for the milk.\"  For some time they patiently followed her about, and at last just as they were ready to lay hands upon her, she suddenly leaped upon a rock and from that to a higher one, until she stood far out of reach on a dizzy overhanging cliff.  \"That Nanni!\" cried Fritz wrathfully as he prepared to follow her. \"She'll break her pesky neck and mine too some day.\"  He climbed a tree for a short cut to the cliff and dropped from an overhanging branch to the narrow shelf of rock in front of the goat. Bello, meanwhile, ran back and forth below, barking like everything, but quite unable either to follow Nanni up the steep trail, or to climb the tree as Fritz had done.  \"Come, Nanni,\" said Fritz, holding out his hand as he stepped carefully toward her.  Nanni sniffed and backed. Leneli and Seppi watched from below, breathless with anxiety. If she should back too much she might fall over the cliff and be killed. If she should dash forward she might knock Fritz over it instead. But Fritz was a wise goat-boy! He put his hand in his pocket and drew out a handful of salt, which he kept for just such times as this. He held it out toward Nanni and carefully and slowly backed away from the edge of the cliff, coaxing her to follow him. As she stepped forward, he stepped back, and in this way led her by a roundabout path down the farther side of the rocks to the place where the other goats wore still feeding.  \"Oh, Fritzi, I never could do that,\" said Leneli, hugging him when he was on safe ground once more. \"I should be so frightened.\"  \"I could,\" said Seppi promptly; \"I'm not afraid.\"  \"Don't you try it, young man,\" said Fritz, \"unless it's the only thing you can do. The best goat-boy is the one who keeps his goats from getting into such places. It's much cleverer to keep out of trouble than to get out.\"  They gave up the milking lesson for the time being, but when the long day was over and they were on their way down the mountain-pass in the late afternoon, they came to a wide level space. Here they paused, and, while Seppi stood with his arm about Nanni's neck and fed her handfuls of green grass, Leneli really did milk enough for a refreshing drink to sustain her on the long homeward journey.  Singing, playing tunes on the horn, and rousing the ever-ready echoes with their yodels, they ran down the steep mountain path in a much shorter time than it had taken to climb it in the morning, and came in sight of the old farm-house just as the Angelus rang again in the little white village spire. They paused on the mountain path and bent their heads, but Nanni was not a religious goat! She remembered the glimpse she had had the night before of green things growing in the garden and suddenly bolted down the steep path at a break-neck speed. All the rest of the flock followed pell-mell after her, and the children were obliged to cut short their prayers in order to save the carrot-tops from being eaten up.  The last mile was covered in record-breaking time, and before the cuckoo clock struck seven the children and goats and dog all came galloping into the yard together.     III. A MOUNTAIN STORM  A MOUNTAIN STORM   The next day, and the day after that, the same lesson was repeated. The Twins went away with Fritz in the early morning and stayed all day long with the goats and came home with him in the sunset glow. But on the fourth day it was quite, quite different. It was different not only because they were to go alone with the goats for the first time, but also because it was the day when the greatest event of the whole year was to happen.  On that very morning the cattle were to start away to the high alps to be gone all summer! Every one in the little gray farm-house was up with the dawn, and while Mother Adolf milked the goats, the Twins took their breakfast to a high rock beside the mountain path, where they could get a good view of the village below. Father Adolf and Fritz had kissed Mother Adolf and the baby good-bye before daylight, and had gone to the village to get the cattle in line for their long march. They did not say good-bye to the Twins, for they were to join the procession when it passed the house; since for the first two miles the paths to the high alps where the cattle grazed and to the goat-pastures were the same.  Leneli and Seppi had finished their bread and milk and were hopping about in great excitement on the hill-top, when suddenly from the village below there was a burst of gay music and they knew that the procession had begun to move. Seppi ran back to the milking-shed as fast as his legs could carry him. \"They're coming, they're coming!\" he shouted.  \"Our goats are ready,\" said Mother Adolf. \"You and Bello may take them out to the path and wait there until the cattle have passed by. Then you must fall in behind them with Father and Fritz and go with them as far as the Giant Pine Tree that stands at the parting of the paths. Father and Fritz will leave you there, and you and Leneli must go on alone. You are sure you know the way?\" She looked anxiously into Seppi's blue eyes.  \"Oh, yes, Mother,\" said Seppi, confidently. \"Don't you worry. I know it well, and so does Leneli. We can take care of the goats just as well as Fritz. You'll see!\"  Seppi, with Bello's help, drove the goats to a place where they could crop the grass beside the mountain path, and there a few moments later Mother Adolf joined them, dragging the baby in the wooden cart. The procession was already in plain sight, winding up the steep mountain path from the village. First came three fine brindled cows, each with a bell as big as a bucket hanging from her neck and a wreath of flowers about her horns. After them came thirty more, each with a smaller bell, marching proudly along in single file behind the leaders. All the bells were jingling, and all the people who followed them from the village were singing and yodeling until the air was full of jolly sounds. The last cow in line carried the milking-stool on her horns, and behind her walked Father and Fritz.  Bello, who understood very well what was going on, kept the goats herded together beside the path, and when Seppi and Leneli, singing and shouting with the rest, drove them forward, Bello marched proudly right behind the goats, barking and waving his tail like a flag.  Mother Adolf's heart swelled with pride as she watched her husband and children march away so gayly, but when they had disappeared from view and the music sounded fainter and fainter as it grew more distant, she wiped her eyes on her apron, picked up the Twins' breakfast-bowls, and went slowly with little Roseli back to the lonely farm-house. The people from the village walked but a little way up the mountain-side, and when they too returned to their homes, there were no mare songs and yodels; and a great silence settled over the mountain.  Up and up the rocky trail wound the long train of cattle and goats, until they came to the Giant Pine Tree, and here Father Adolf and Fritz stopped.  \"Remember, my children,\" said Father Adolf solemnly to the Twins, \"the goats are our only wealth. If they stray away and are lost or fall over a cliff and are killed, the fault will be yours. You must be faithful, watchful, and brave, and let"]]]
