Kelson (1951:69) has pointed out that in New Mexico the separation of the ranges of _T. b. pervagus_ and _T. b. cultellus_ is probably complete, but probably incomplete between _T. b. pervagus_ and _T. b. aureus_. Nevertheless, the similarities between _T. b. pervagus_ and _T. b. cultellus_ and _T. b. internatus_ suggest that _T. b. pervagus_ was originally derived from the more eastern stock.  _T. b. aureus_ is a variable subspecies which, according to Durrant (1952:211), intergrades with _T. b. howelli_ in Utah. Specimens of _T. b. aureus_ showing the greatest amount of geographic variation cranially are from the ecotone between the Pi匾n-juniper and Douglas Fir zones at the edge of the range of the subspecies.  _T. b. howelli_ is a markedly distinct subspecies that shows certain similarities to _T. b. aureus_, but the degree of cranial difference from _T. b. aureus_ suggests an isolation of long duration, or a rapid evolution from the parent stock.  _T. b. internatus_ and _T. b. cultellus_ probably intergrade east of the Sangre De Cristo Range in the vicinity of the Colorado-New Mexico boundary. The amount of intergradation is obscured by the great amount of geographic variation occurring in _T. bottae_ at the edge of the plains and by the lack of specimens from this area.  _T. b. internatus_ is a widespread subspecies showing its greatest variation at the edge of the plains. This area is an ecotone between the coniferous forest and the grassland and is by nature an area of change owing to the alternation of wet and dry periods such as the pluvial, interpluvial, and postpluvial periods. This seems to support Durrant's observation (1952:496) that \"the greatest range of morphological variation is in animals from the least stable environments.\"  Specimens from a small area north of the Arkansas River in the vicinity of Ca匾n City (see fig. 1) differ sufficiently from _T. b. internatus_ to be given nominal recognition. High mountains and the Arkansas River isolate the new subspecies found at Ca匾n City from populations of _T. b. internatus_ to the west and south; however there are no apparent geographic barriers between the newly named subspecies and populations of _T. b. internatus_ twelve miles to the north or from the vicinity of Pueblo to the east. This new subspecies is the most extreme of the variants occurring in the unstable environment at the edge of the plains.   =Thomomys bottae aureus= Allen      _Thomomys aureus_ Allen, Bull. Amer.

Rowley.    _Distribution._--Colorado Plateau Province of southwestern Colorado   (see fig. 1), northwestern New Mexico, southeastern Utah, and   northeastern Arizona.    _Distinctive characters._--Size large (see measurements); usually   pale in western part of range, dark in eastern part; posterior   extensions of premaxillae long, wide, and deeply serrated; posterior   margins of nasals truncate or slightly rounded (see fig. 2);   interpterygoid space U-shaped, with median spicule; basioccipital   wide; bullae well inflated, rounded ventrally.    _Comparisons._--For comparisons with _T. b. howelli_ and _T. b.   pervagus_, see accounts of those subspecies.  _Remarks._--_T. b. aureus_ is a variable subspecies, which differs considerably from _T. b. internatus_, _T. b. cultellus_, and _T. b. rubidus_ and includes several microgeographic races distinguishable to a taxonomist specializing in the group. These slightly varying populations are here not considered sufficiently distinct for nominal recognition.  Characters such as color of the pelage and conformation of the bullae and zygomatic arches vary with the locality, and to some extent vary among specimens from a single locality.  The name _Thomomys bottae optabilis_, given to specimens from Coventry by Goldman (1936:116), is here placed in synonymy under _T. b. aureus_ Allen. The characters originally used to describe _T. b. optabilis_ are of the type that vary between populations only a few miles apart, or often vary within a population. The skulls of specimens from Coventry are not lighter in structure than those of _T. b. aureus_. The premaxillae are not narrower, nor is the frontal region narrower or more constricted than in _T. b. aureus_.  The name _Thomomys bottae apache_, given to specimens from Lake La Jara, New Mexico, by Bailey (1910:79), and later applied to specimens from Colorado by Bailey (1915:75), is here also placed in synonymy under _T. b. aureus_. Specimens from Lake La Jara, New Mexico, and nearby localities in Colorado may be separated from topotypes of _T. b. aureus_ on the basis of color only. The topotypes of _T. b. aureus_ are mostly pale; some, however, are dark. The number of pale specimens in any given series decreases gradually in a clinal pattern from west to east. Since there is no noticeable step in the cline and since all specimens show close cranial similarity, it is felt that nominal recognition of the darker specimens does not present a realistic picture of the relationships of the relatively unisolated populations in the Colorado Plateau Province.  Since _Thomomys bottae_ in the Colorado Plateau Province is especially plastic, varying from locality to locality, emphasis is here placed on similarities that unite specimens from different localities. The individual and microgeographic variations are outlined below.  Specimens from Bedrock have zygomatic arches that are heavy anteriorly. Specimens from Coventry are dorsally almost uniformly Strong Brown (7.5YR 5/6) and lack a strong dorsal stripe. The venters are Reddish Yellow (7.5YR 8/6). Specimens from 15 miles west of Cortez are the palest specimens of _T. b. aureus_ from Colorado, and closely resemble topotypes. The basic color varies from Reddish Yellow (7.5YR 7/6 and 6/6) to Strong Brown (7.5YR 5/6). Specimens are marked with a narrow dark dorsal stripe. The venters are white. Specimens from Ute Peak and Cortez have Reddish Yellow (7.5YR 6/6) flanks and are slightly darker dorsally. Many specimens from Mesa Verde are indistinguishable from specimens from Coventry and from Cortez. Others have dark diffuse dorsal stripes. The venters are Pink (7.5YR 7/4) or Pinkish White (7.5YR 8/2). Some specimens from the Mancos River have wide dorsal stripes. Specimens from three miles west of Durango have especially wide-spreading zygomatic arches posteriorly and have wide black dorsal stripes. The venters are Pink (7.5YR 7/4). One specimen from Florida is dark and grizzled and has a dark dorsal stripe. Another specimen is pale and has only a small dorsal stripe. Specimens from 12 miles west of Pagosa Springs have thin rostra and diffuse dorsal stripes. Specimens from Bondad have a V-shaped interpterygoid space and in it a small median spicule. One specimen is uniformly grizzled and lacks a dorsal stripe, giving an overall effect of Dark Yellowish Brown (10YR 3/3). Another specimen has Strong Brown (7.5YR 5/6) flanks and is only slightly darker dorsally.    _Specimens examined._--Total 114. _Colorado_: Montrose Co.: West   Paradox Valley, 5 (CMNH); Bedrock, 5150 ft., 5 (ERW); Coventry,   6800 ft., 14 (12 ERW, 2 USNM).

For comparisons with _T. b. cultellus_ and _T. b. rubidus_, see   accounts of those subspecies.  _Remarks._--The dividing line between _T. b. internatus_ and _T. b. cultellus_ is drawn arbitrarily since only one specimen has been collected between La Veta Pass and the border of New Mexico.  When Goldman (1936:115) named _T. b. internatus_ he included specimens from Union and Colfax counties, New Mexico, and specimens from Gardner, Colorado (not Garfield as stated by Kelson, 1951:66). The specimens from New Mexico and a specimen from Fishers Peak, Colorado, were subsequently assigned to _T. b. cultellus_ by Kelson (_loc. cit._).  The specimen from Fishers Peak shows some characters that might be interpreted as intermediate between _internatus_ and _cultellus_, but shows also some unique characters that can be understood only by further collecting in the regions north and northeast of the type locality of _T. b. cultellus_.  Variation is slight in the large series of topotypes of _T. b. internatus_. Specimens from other localities in the western part of the range differ little from the topotypes. Specimens from one mile west of Coaldale have slightly more inflated bullae that are more flattened ventrally. Specimens from five miles south of Cotopaxi also have the bullae more flattened ventrally.  Specimens from localities bordering the plains differ from the topotypes and near topotypes, and in general show greater variation from locality to locality. Specimens from 12 miles north of Ca匾n City are dark, resembling _T. b. rubidus_, but cranially agree with specimens from near Colorado Springs in being indistinguishable from specimens from Salida. Specimens from St. Charles Mesa and Bear Creek near Walsenburg differ from the topotypes in having wider rostra. The specimens from St. Charles Mesa have more inflated bullae.    _Specimens examined._--Total 93. Chaffee Co.: 2 mi. NNW Salida,   7100 ft., 3; _Salida_, 28 (20 ERW, 8 USNM). Fremont Co.: 12 mi.

Barber.    _Distribution._--Raton Section of the Great Plains in northern New   Mexico and extreme southern Colorado (see fig. 1).    _Distinctive characters._--Dark (topotypes); size medium (see   measurements); posterior tongues of premaxillae short; posterior   margins of nasals forming a V (see fig. 5).    _Comparisons._--From _T. b. pervagus_, topotypes of _T. b.   cultellus_ differ as follows: darker, not so reddish; smaller; skull   smaller; zygomatic arches relatively longer; bullae proportionately   smaller and less inflated; basioccipital proportionately wider;   posterior tongues of premaxillae shorter.    Topotypes of _T. b. cultellus_ most closely resemble those of _T. b.   internatus_ but differ as follows: darker; zygomatic arches more   widely spreading, not so nearly parallel; nasals not so wide; bullae   slightly more inflated.    For a comparison with _T. b. rubidus_ see the account of that   subspecies.  _Remarks._--Kelson (1951:64) named _T. b. cultellus_ on the basis of six dark specimens (Dark Reddish Brown 5YR 3/4 and 2/2). Nowhere else within the range of this subspecies, as defined by Kelson, do any specimens resemble the topotypes in color.  After comparing topotypes of _T. b. cultellus_ with topotypes of _T. b. internatus_ of approximately equal age, I disagree with Kelson (_loc. cit._) on some of the characters which he used to separate _cultellus_ from _internatus_. My findings indicate that _T. b. cultellus_ is not smaller, that its skull is not smaller and not less angular, and that the tympanic bullae are not less pointed ventrally. Further collecting is needed better to limit and diagnose this subspecies.    _Specimens"]]]
