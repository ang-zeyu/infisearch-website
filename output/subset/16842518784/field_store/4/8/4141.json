In fact there was nothing unusual, or uncanny in the whole experience. It happened to be a bright and somewhat too sunny July day, which is not an unusual happening along the banks of the Hudson. You could see the heat, and if anything had soughed it could only have been the mercury in my thermometer. This I must say clicked nervously against the top of the glass tube and manifested an extraordinary desire to climb higher than the length of the tube permitted. Incidentally I may add, even if it be not believed, that the heat was so intense that the mercury actually did raise the whole thermometer a foot and a half above the mantel-shelf, and for two mortal hours, from midday until two by the Monastery Clock, held it suspended there in mid-air with no visible means of support. Not a breath of air was stirring, and the only sounds heard were the expanding creaks of the beams of my house, which upon that particular day increased eight feet in width and assumed a height which made it appear to be a three instead of a two story dwelling. There was little work doing in the house. The children played about in their bathing suits, and the only other active factor in my life of the moment was our hired man who was kept busy in the cellar pouring water on the furnace coal to keep it from spontaneously combusting.  We had just had luncheon, burning our throats with the iced tea and with considerable discomfort swallowing the simmering cold roast filet, which we had to eat hastily before the heat of the day transformed it into smoked beef. My youngest boy Willie perspired so copiously that we seriously thought of sending for a plumber to solder up his pores, and as for myself who have spent three summers of my life in the desert of Sahara in order to rid myself of nervous chills to which I was once unhappily subject, for the first time in my life I was impelled to admit that it was intolerably warm. And then the telephone bell rang.  \"Great Scott!\" I cried, \"Who in thunder do you suppose wants to play golf on a day like this?\"--for nowadays our telephone is used for no other purpose than the making or the breaking of golf engagements.  \"Me,\" cried my eldest son, whose grammar is not as yet on a par with his activity. \"I'll go.\"  The boy shot out of the dining room and ran to the telephone, returning in a few moments with the statement that a gentleman with a husky voice whose name was none of his business wished to speak with me on a matter of some importance to myself.  I was loath to go. My friends the book agents had recently acquired the habit of approaching me over the telephone, and I feared that here was another nefarious attempt to foist a thirty-eight volume tabloid edition of _The World's Worst Literature_ upon me. Nevertheless I wisely determined to respond.  \"Hello,\" I said, placing my lips against the rubber cup. \"Hello there, who wants 91162 Nepperhan?\"  \"Is that you?\" came the answering question, and, as my boy had indicated, in a voice whose chief quality was huskiness.  \"I guess so,\" I replied facetiously;--\"It was this morning, but the heat has affected me somewhat, and I don't feel as much like myself as I might. What can I do for you?\"  \"Nothing, but you can do a lot for yourself,\" was the astonishing answer. \"Pretty hot for literary work, isn't it?\" the voice added sympathetically.  \"Very,\" said I. \"Fact is I can't seem to do anything these days but perspire.\"  \"That's what I thought; and when you can't work ruin stares you in the face, eh? Now I have a manuscript--\"  \"Oh Lord!\" I cried. \"Don't. There are millions in the same fix. Even my cook writes.\"  \"Don't know about that,\" he returned instantly. \"But I do know that there's millions in my manuscript. And you can have it for the asking. How's that for an offer?\"  \"Very kind, thank you,\" said I. \"What's the nature of your story?\"  \"It's extremely good-natured,\" he answered promptly.  I laughed. The twist amused me.  \"That isn't what I meant exactly,\" said I, \"though it has some bearing on the situation. Is it a Henry James dandy, or does it bear the mark of Caine? Is it realism or fiction?\"  \"Realism,\" said he. \"Fiction isn't in my line.\"  \"Well, I'll tell you,\" I replied; \"you send it to me by post and I'll look it over. If I can use it I will.\"  \"Can't do it,\" said he. \"There isn't any post-office where I am.\"  \"What?\" I cried. \"No post-office? Where in Hades are you?\"  \"Gehenna,\" he answered briefly. \"The transportation between your country and mine is all one way,\" he added. \"If it wasn't the population here would diminish.\"  \"Then how the deuce am I to get hold of your stuff?\" I demanded.  \"That's easy. Send your stenographer to the 'phone and I'll dictate it,\" he answered.  The novelty of the situation appealed to me. Even if my new found acquaintance were some funny person nearer at hand than Gehenna trying to play a practical joke upon me, still it might be worth while to get hold of the story he had to tell. Hence I agreed to his proposal.  \"All right, sir,\" said I. \"I'll do it. I'll have him here to-morrow morning at nine o'clock sharp. What's your number? I'll ring you up.\"  \"Never mind that,\" he replied. \"I'm merely a tapster on your wires. I'll ring _you_ up as soon as I've had breakfast and then we can get to work.\"  \"Very good,\" said I. \"And may I ask your name?\"  \"Certainly,\" he answered. \"I'm Munchausen.\"  \"What? The Baron?\" I roared, delighted.  \"Well--I used to be Baron,\" he returned with a tinge of sadness in his voice, \"but here in Gehenna we are all on an equal footing. I'm plain Mr. Munchausen of Hades now. But that's a detail. Don't forget. Nine o'clock. Good-bye.\"  \"Wait a moment, Baron,\" I cried. \"How about the royalties on this book?\"  \"Keep 'em for yourself,\" he replied. \"We have money to burn over here. You are welcome to all the earthly rights of the book. I'm satisfied with the returns on the Asbestos Edition, already in its 468th thousand. Good-bye.\"  There was a rattle as of the hanging up of the receiver, a short sharp click and a ring, and I realised that he had gone.  The next morning in response to a telegraphic summons my stenographer arrived and when I explained the situation to him he was incredulous, but orders were orders and he remained. I could see, however, that as nine o'clock approached he grew visibly nervous, which indicated that he half believed me anyhow, and when at nine to the second the sharp ring of the 'phone fell upon our ears he jumped as if he had been shot.  \"Hello,\" said I again. \"That you, Baron?\"  \"The same,\" the voice replied. \"Stenographer ready?\"  \"Yes,\" said I.  The stenographer walked to the desk, placed the receiver at his ear, and with trembling voice announced his presence. There was a response of some kind, and then more calmly he remarked, \"Fire ahead, Mr. Munchausen,\" and began to write rapidly in short-hand.  Two days later he handed me a type-written copy of the following stories. The reader will observe that they are in the form of interviews, and it should be stated here that they appeared originally in the columns of the Sunday edition of the _Gehenna Gazette_, a publication of Hades which circulates wholly among the best people of that country, and which, if report saith truly, would not print a line which could not be placed in the hands of children, and to whose columns such writers as Chaucer, Shakespeare, Ben Jonson, Jonah and Ananias are frequent contributors.  Indeed, on the statement of Mr. Munchausen, all the interviews herein set forth were between himself as the principal and the Hon. Henry B. Ananias as reporter, or were scrupulously edited by the latter before being published.     II  THE SPORTING TOUR OF MR. MUNCHAUSEN   \"Good morning, Mr. Munchausen,\" said the interviewer of the _Gehenna Gazette_ entering the apartment of the famous traveller at the Hotel Deville, where the late Baron had just arrived from his sporting tour in the Blue Hills of Cimmeria and elsewhere.  \"The interests of truth, my dear Ananias,\" replied the Baron, grasping me cordially by the hand, \"require that I should state it as my opinion that it is not a good morning. In fact, my good friend, it is a very bad morning. Can you not see that it is raining cats and dogs without?\"  \"Sir,\" said I with a bow, \"I accept the spirit of your correction but not the letter. It is raining indeed, sir, as you suggest, but having passed through it myself on my way hither I can personally testify that it is raining rain, and not a single cat or canine has, to my knowledge, as yet fallen from the clouds to the parched earth, although I am informed that down upon the coast an elephant and three cows have fallen upon one of the summer hotels and irreparably damaged the roof.\"  Mr. Munchausen laughed.  \"It is curious, Ananias,\" said he, \"what sticklers for the truth you and I have become.\"  \"It is indeed, Munchausen,\" I returned. \"The effects of this climate are working wonders upon us. And it is just as well. You and I are outclassed by these twentieth century prevaricators concerning whom late arrivals from the upper world tell such strange things. They tell me that lying has become a business and is no longer ranked among the Arts or Professions.\"  \"Ah me!\" sighed the Baron with a retrospective look in his eye, \"lying isn't what it used to be, Ananias, in your days and mine. I fear it has become one of the lost arts.\"  \"I have noticed it myself, my friend, and only last night I observed the same thing to my well beloved Sapphira, who was lamenting the transparency of the modern lie, and said that lying to-day is no better than the truth. In our day a prevarication had all of the opaque beauty of an opalescent bit of glass, whereas to-day in the majority of cases it is like a great vulgar plate-glass window, through which we can plainly see the ugly truths that lie behind. But, sir, I am here to secure from you not a treatise upon the lost art of lying, but some "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33432"],["title","Mr. Munchausen (#2)"],["body","of the results of your sporting tour. You fished, and hunted, and golfed, and doubtless did other things. You, of course, had luck and made the greatest catch of the season; shot all the game in sight, and won every silver, gold and pewter golf mug in all creation?\"  \"You speak truly, Ananias,\" returned Mr. Munchausen. \"My luck _was_ wonderful--even for one who has been so singularly fortunate as I. I took three tons of speckled beauties with one cast of an ordinary horse whip in the Blue Hills, and with nothing but a silken line and a minnow hook landed upon the deck of my steam yacht a whale of most tremendous proportions; I shot game of every kind in great abundance and in my golf there was none to whom I could not give with ease seven holes in every nine and beat him out.\"  \"Seven?\" said I, failing to see how the ex-Baron could be right.  \"Seven,\" said he complacently. \"Seven on the first, and seven on the second nine; fourteen in all of the eighteen holes.\"  \"But,\" I cried, \"I do not see how that could be. With fourteen holes out of the eighteen given to your opponent even if you won all the rest you still would be ten down.\"  \"True, by ordinary methods of calculation,\" returned the Baron, \"but I got them back on a technicality, which I claim is a new and valuable discovery in the game. You see it is impossible to play more than one hole at a time, and I invariably proved to the Greens Committee that in taking fourteen holes at once my opponent violated the physical possibilities of the situation. In every case the point was accepted as well taken, for if we allow golfers to rise above physical possibilities the game is gone. The integrity of the Card is the soul of Golf,\" he added sententiously.  \"Tell me of the whale,\" said I, simply. \"You landed a whale of large proportions on the deck of your yacht with a simple silken line and a minnow hook.\"  \"Well it's a tough story,\" the Baron replied, handing me a cigar. \"But it is true, Ananias, true to the last word. I was fishing for eels. Sitting on the deck of _The Lyre_ one very warm afternoon in the early stages of my trip, I baited a minnow hook and dropped it overboard. It was the roughest day at sea I had ever encountered. The waves were mountain high, and it is the sad fact that one of our crew seated in the main-top was drowned with the spray of the dashing billows. Fortunately for myself, directly behind my deck chair, to which I was securely lashed, was a powerful electric fan which blew the spray away from me, else I too might have suffered the same horrid fate. Suddenly there came a tug on my line. I was half asleep at the time and let the line pay out involuntarily, but I was wide-awake enough to know that something larger than an eel had taken hold of the hook. I had hooked either a Leviathan or a derelict. Caution and patience, the chief attributes of a good angler were required. I hauled the line in until it was taut. There were a thousand yards of it out, and when it reached the point of tensity, I gave orders to the engineers to steam closer to the object at the other end. We steamed in five hundred yards, I meanwhile hauling in my line. Then came another tug and I let out ten yards. 'Steam closer,' said I. 'Three hundred yards sou-sou-west by nor'-east.' The yacht obeyed on the instant. I called the Captain and let him feel the line. 'What do you think it is?' said I. He pulled a half dozen times. 'Feels like a snag,' he said, 'but seein' as there ain't no snags out here, I think it must be a fish.' 'What kind?' I asked. I could not but agree that he was better acquainted with the sea and its denizens than I. 'Well,' he replied, 'it is either a sea serpent or a whale.' At the mere mention of the word whale I was alert. I have always wanted to kill a whale. 'Captain,' said I, 'can't you tie an anchor onto a hawser, and bait the flukes with a boa constrictor and make sure of him?' He looked at me contemptuously. 'Whales eats fish,' said he, 'and they don't bite at no anchors. Whales has brains, whales has.' 'What shall we do?' I asked. 'Steam closer,' said the Captain, and we did so.\"  Munchausen took a long breath and for the moment was silent.  \"Well?\" said I.  \"Well, Ananias,\" said he. \"We resolved to wait. As the Captain said to me, 'Fishin' is waitin'.' So we waited. 'Coax him along,' said the Captain. 'How can we do it?' I asked. 'By kindness,' said he. 'Treat him gently, persuasive-like and he'll come.' We waited four days and nobody moved and I grew weary of coaxing. 'We've got to do something,' said I to the Captain. 'Yes,' said he, 'Let's _make_ him move. He doesn't seem to respond to kindness.' 'But how?' I cried. 'Give him an electric shock,' said the Captain. 'Telegraph him his mother's sick and may be it'll move him.' 'Can't you get closer to him?' I demanded, resenting his facetious manner. 'I can, but it will scare him off,' replied the Captain. So we turned all our batteries on the sea. The dynamo shot forth its bolts and along about four o'clock in the afternoon there was the whale drawn by magnetic influence to the side of _The Lyre_. He was a beauty, Ananias,\" Munchausen added with enthusiasm. \"You never saw such a whale. His back was as broad as the deck of an ocean steamer and in his length he exceeded the dimensions of _The Lyre_ by sixty feet.\"  \"And still you got him on deck?\" I asked,--I, Ananias, who can stand something in the way of an exaggeration.  \"Yes,\" said Munchausen, lighting his cigar, which had gone out. \"Another storm came up and we rolled and rolled and rolled, until I thought _The Lyre_ was going to capsize.\"  \"But weren't you sea-sick?\" I asked.  \"Didn't have a chance to be,\" said Munchausen. \"I was thinking of the whale all the time. Finally there came a roll in which we went completely under, and with a slight pulling on the line the whale was landed by the force of the wave and laid squarely upon the deck.\"  \"Great Sapphira!\" said I. \"But you just said he was wider and longer than the yacht!\"  [Illustration: \"There was the whale drawn by magnetic influence to the side of _The Lyre_.\" _Chapter II._]  \"He was,\" sighed Munchausen. \"He landed on the deck and by sheer force of his weight the yacht went down under him. I swam ashore and the whole crew with me. The next day Mr. Whale floated in strangled. He'd swallowed the thousand yards of line and it got so tangled in his tonsils that it choked him to death. Come around next week and I'll give you a couple of pounds of whalebone for Mrs. Ananias, and all the oil you can carry.\"  I thanked the old gentleman for his kind offer and promised to avail myself of it, although as a newspaper man it is against my principles to accept gifts from public men.  \"It was great luck, Baron,\" said I. \"Or at least it would have been if you hadn't lost your yacht.\"  \"That was great luck too,\" he observed nonchalantly. \"It cost me ten thousand dollars a month keeping that yacht in commission. Now she's gone I save all that. Why it's like finding money in the street, Ananias. She wasn't worth more than fifty thousand dollars, and in six months I'll be ten thousand ahead.\"  I could not but admire the cheerful philosophy of the man, but then I was not surprised. Munchausen was never the sort of man to let little things worry him.  \"But that whale business wasn't a circumstance to my catch of three tons of trout with a single cast of a horse-whip in the Blue Hills,\" said the Baron after a few moments of meditation, during which I could see that he was carefully marshalling his facts.  \"I never heard of its equal,\" said I. \"You must have used a derrick.\"  \"No,\" he replied suavely. \"Nothing of the sort. It was the simplest thing in the world. It was along about five o'clock in the afternoon when with my three guides and my valet I drove up the winding roadway of Great Sulphur Mountain on my way to the Blue Mountain House where I purposed to put up for a few days. I had one of those big mountain wagons with a covered top to it such as the pioneers used on the American plains, with six fine horses to the fore. I held the reins myself, since we were in the midst of a terrific thunderstorm and I felt safer when I did my own driving. All the flaps of the leathern cover were let down at the sides and at the back, and were securely fastened. The roads were unusually heavy, and when we came to the last great hill before the lake all but I were walking, as a measure of relief to the horses. Suddenly one of the horses balked right in the middle of the ascent, and in a moment of impatience I gave him a stinging flick with my whip, when like a whirlwind the whole six swerved to one side and started on a dead run upward. The jolt and the unexpected swerving of the wagon threw me from my seat and I landed clear of the wheels in the soft mud of the roadway, fortunately without injury. When I arose the team was out of sight and we had to walk the remainder of the distance to the hotel. Imagine our surprise upon arriving there to find the six panting steeds and the wagon standing before the main entrance to the hotel dripping as though they had been through the Falls of Niagara, and, would you believe it, Ananias, inside that leather cover of the wagon, packed as tightly as sardines, were no less than three thousand trout, not one of them weighing less than a pound and some of them getting as high as four. The whole catch weighed a trifle over six thousand pounds.\"  \"Great Heavens, Baron,\" I cried. \"Where the dickens did they come from?\"  \"That's what I asked myself,\" said the Baron easily. \"It seemed astounding at first glance, but investigation showed it after all to be a very simple proposition. The runaways after reaching the top of the hill turned to the left, and clattered on down toward the bridge over the inlet to the lake. The bridge broke beneath their weight and the horses soon found themselves struggling in the water. The harness was strong and the wagon never left them. They"]]]
