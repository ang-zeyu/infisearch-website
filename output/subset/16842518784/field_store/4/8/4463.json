Professor Binstead had picked up a small china figure of delicate workmanship. It represented a warrior of pre-khaki days advancing with a spear upon some adversary who, judging from the contented expression on the warrior’s face, was smaller than himself.  “Where did you get this?”  “That? Mawson, my agent, found it in a little shop on the east side.”  “Where’s the other? There ought to be another. These things go in pairs. They’re valueless alone.”  Mr. Brewster’s brow clouded.  “I know that,” he said shortly. “Mawson’s looking for the other one everywhere. If you happen across it, I give you _carte blanche_ to buy it for me.”  “It must be somewhere.”  “Yes. If you find it, don’t worry about the expense. I’ll settle up, no matter what it is.”  “I’ll bear it in mind,” said Professor Binstead. “It may cost you a lot of money. I suppose you know that.”  “I told you I don’t care what it costs.”  “It’s nice to be a millionaire,” sighed Professor Binstead.  “Luncheon is served, sir,” said Parker.  He had stationed himself in a statutesque pose behind Mr. Brewster’s chair, when there was a knock at the door. He went to the door, and returned with a telegram.  “Telegram for you, sir.”  Mr. Brewster nodded carelessly. The contents of the chafing-dish had justified the advance advertising of their odour, and he was too busy to be interrupted.  “Put it down. And you needn’t wait, Parker.”  “Very good, sir.”  The valet withdrew, and Mr. Brewster resumed his lunch.  “Aren’t you going to open it?” asked Professor Binstead, to whom a telegram was a telegram.  “It can wait. I get them all day long. I expect it’s from Lucille, saying what train she’s making.”  “She returns to-day?”  “Yes, Been at Miami.” Mr. Brewster, having dwelt at adequate length on the contents of the chafing-dish, adjusted his glasses and took up the envelope. “I shall be glad—Great Godfrey!”  He sat staring at the telegram, his mouth open. His friend eyed him solicitously.  “No bad news, I hope?”  Mr. Brewster gurgled in a strangled way.  “Bad news? Bad—? Here, read it for yourself.”  Professor Binstead, one of the three most inquisitive men in New York, took the slip of paper with gratitude.  “‘Returning New York to-day with darling Archie,’” he read. “‘Lots of love from us both. Lucille.’” He gaped at his host. “Who is Archie?” he enquired.  “Who is Archie?” echoed Mr. Brewster helplessly. “Who is—? That’s just what I would like to know.”  “‘Darling Archie,’” murmured the professor, musing over the telegram. “‘Returning to-day with darling Archie.’ Strange!”  Mr. Brewster continued to stare before him. When you send your only daughter on a visit to Miami minus any entanglements and she mentions in a telegram that she has acquired a darling Archie, you are naturally startled. He rose from the table with a bound. It had occurred to him that by neglecting a careful study of his mail during the past week, as was his bad habit when busy, he had lost an opportunity of keeping abreast with current happenings. He recollected now that a letter had arrived from Lucille some time ago, and that he had put it away unopened till he should have leisure to read it. Lucille was a dear girl, he had felt, but her letters when on a vacation seldom contained anything that couldn’t wait a few days for a reading. He sprang for his desk, rummaged among his papers, and found what he was seeking.  It was a long letter, and there was silence in the room for some moments while he mastered its contents. Then he turned to the professor, breathing heavily.  “Good heavens!”  “Yes?” said Professor Binstead eagerly. “Yes?”  “Good Lord!”  “Well?”  “Good gracious!”  “What is it?” demanded the professor in an agony.  Mr. Brewster sat down again with a thud.  “She’s married!”  “Married!”  “Married! To an Englishman!”  “Bless my soul!”  “She says,” proceeded Mr. Brewster, referring to the letter again, “that they were both so much in love that they simply had to slip off and get married, and she hopes I won’t be cross. Cross!” gasped Mr. Brewster, gazing wildly at his friend.  “Very disturbing!”  “Disturbing! You bet it’s disturbing! I don’t know anything about the fellow. Never heard of him in my life. She says he wanted a quiet wedding because he thought a fellow looked such a chump getting married! And I must love him, because he’s all set to love me very much!”  “Extraordinary!”  Mr. Brewster put the letter down.  “An Englishman!”  “I have met some very agreeable Englishmen,” said Professor Binstead.  “I don’t like Englishmen,” growled Mr. Brewster. “Parker’s an Englishman.”  “Your valet?”  “Yes. I believe he wears my shirts on the sly,’” said Mr. Brewster broodingly, “If I catch him—! What would you do about this, Binstead?”  “Do?” The professor considered the point judicially. “Well, really, Brewster, I do not see that there is anything you can do. You must simply wait and meet the man. Perhaps he will turn out an admirable son-in-law.”  “H’m!” Mr. Brewster declined to take an optimistic view. “But an Englishman, Binstead!” he said with pathos. “Why,” he went on, memory suddenly stirring, “there was an Englishman at this hotel only a week or two ago who went about knocking it in a way that would have amazed you! Said it was a rotten place! _My_ hotel!”  Professor Binstead clicked his tongue sympathetically. He understood his friend’s warmth.     CHAPTER III. MR. BREWSTER DELIVERS SENTENCE   At about the same moment that Professor Binstead was clicking his tongue in Mr. Brewster’s sitting-room, Archie Moffam sat contemplating his bride in a drawing-room on the express from Miami. He was thinking that this was too good to be true. His brain had been in something of a whirl these last few days, but this was one thought that never failed to emerge clearly from the welter.  Mrs. Archie Moffam, nee Lucille Brewster, was small and slender. She had a little animated face, set in a cloud of dark hair. She was so altogether perfect that Archie had frequently found himself compelled to take the marriage-certificate out of his inside pocket and study it furtively, to make himself realise that this miracle of good fortune had actually happened to him.  “Honestly, old bean—I mean, dear old thing,—I mean, darling,” said Archie, “I can’t believe it!”  “What?”  “What I mean is, I can’t understand why you should have married a blighter like me.”  Lucille’s eyes opened. She squeezed his hand.  “Why, you’re the most wonderful thing in the world, precious!—Surely you know that?”  “Absolutely escaped my notice. Are you sure?”  “Of course I’m sure! You wonder-child! Nobody could see you without loving you!”  Archie heaved an ecstatic sigh. Then a thought crossed his mind. It was a thought which frequently came to mar his bliss.  “I say, I wonder if your father will think that!”  “Of course he will!”  “We rather sprung this, as it were, on the old lad,” said Archie dubiously. “What sort of a man _is_ your father?”  “Father’s a darling, too.”  “Rummy thing he should own that hotel,” said Archie. “I had a frightful row with a blighter of a manager there just before I left for Miami. Your father ought to sack that chap. He was a blot on the landscape!”  It had been settled by Lucille during the journey that Archie should be broken gently to his father-in-law. That is to say, instead of bounding blithely into Mr. Brewster’s presence hand in hand, the happy pair should separate for half an hour or so, Archie hanging around in the offing while Lucille saw her father and told him the whole story, or those chapters of it which she had omitted from her letter for want of space. Then, having impressed Mr. Brewster sufficiently with his luck in having acquired Archie for a son-in-law, she would lead him to where his bit of good fortune awaited him.  The programme worked out admirably in its earlier stages. When the two emerged from Mr. Brewster’s room to meet Archie, Mr. Brewster’s general idea was that fortune had smiled upon him in an almost unbelievable fashion and had presented him with a son-in-law who combined in almost equal parts the more admirable characteristics of Apollo, Sir Galahad, and Marcus Aurelius. True, he had gathered in the course of the conversation that dear Archie had no occupation and no private means; but Mr. Brewster felt that a great-souled man like Archie didn’t need them. You can’t have everything, and Archie, according to Lucille’s account, was practically a hundred per cent man in soul, looks, manners, amiability, and breeding. These are the things that count. Mr. Brewster proceeded to the lobby in a glow of optimism and geniality.  Consequently, when he perceived Archie, he got a bit of a shock.  “Hullo—ullo—ullo!” said Archie, advancing happily.  “Archie, darling, this is father,” said Lucille.  “Good Lord!” said Archie.  There was one of those silences. Mr. Brewster looked at Archie. Archie gazed at Mr. Brewster. Lucille, perceiving without understanding why that the big introduction scene had stubbed its toe on some unlooked-for obstacle, waited anxiously for enlightenment. Meanwhile, Archie continued to inspect Mr. Brewster, and Mr. Brewster continued to drink in Archie.  After an awkward pause of about three and a quarter minutes, Mr. Brewster swallowed once or twice, and finally spoke.  “Lu!”  “Yes, father?”  “Is this true?”  Lucille’s grey eyes clouded over with perplexity and apprehension.  “True?”  “Have you really inflicted this—_this_ on me for a son-in-law?” Mr. Brewster swallowed a few more times, Archie the while watching with a frozen fascination the rapid shimmying of his new relative’s Adam’s-apple. “Go away! I want to have a few words alone with this—This—_wassyourdamname?_” he demanded, in an overwrought manner, addressing Archie for the first time.  “I told you, father. It’s Moom.”  “Moom?”  “It’s spelt M-o-f-f-a-m, but pronounced Moom.”  “To rhyme,” said Archie, helpfully, “with Bluffinghame.”  “Lu,” said Mr. Brewster, “run"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3756"],["title","Indiscretions of Archie (#2)"],["body","ay! I want to speak to-to-to—”  “You called me _this_ before,” said Archie.  “You aren’t angry, father, dear?” said Lucilla.  “Oh no! Oh no! I’m tickled to death!”  When his daughter had withdrawn, Mr. Brewster drew a long breath.  “Now then!” he said.  “Bit embarrassing, all this, what!” said Archie, chattily. “I mean to say, having met before in less happy circs. and what not. Rum coincidence and so forth! How would it be to bury the jolly old hatchet—start a new life—forgive and forget—learn to love each other—and all that sort of rot? I’m game if you are. How do we go? Is it a bet?”  Mr. Brewster remained entirely unsoftened by this manly appeal to his better feelings.  “What the devil do you mean by marrying my daughter?”  Archie reflected.  “Well, it sort of happened, don’t you know! You know how these things _are!_ Young yourself once, and all that. I was most frightfully in love, and Lu seemed to think it wouldn’t be a bad scheme, and one thing led to another, and—well, there you are, don’t you know!”  “And I suppose you think you’ve done pretty well for yourself?”  “Oh, absolutely! As far as I’m concerned, everything’s topping! I’ve never felt so braced in my life!”  “Yes!” said Mr. Brewster, with bitterness, “I suppose, from your view-point, everything _is_ ‘topping.’ You haven’t a cent to your name, and you’ve managed to fool a rich man’s daughter into marrying you. I suppose you looked me up in Bradstreet before committing yourself?”  This aspect of the matter had not struck Archie until this moment.  “I say!” he observed, with dismay. “I never looked at it like that before! I can see that, from your point of view, this must look like a bit of a wash-out!”  “How do you propose to support Lucille, anyway?”  Archie ran a finger round the inside of his collar. He felt embarrassed, His father-in-law was opening up all kinds of new lines of thought.  “Well, there, old bean,” he admitted, frankly, “you rather have me!” He turned the matter over for a moment. “I had a sort of idea of, as it were, working, if you know what I mean.”  “Working at what?”  “Now, there again you stump me somewhat! The general scheme was that I should kind of look round, you know, and nose about and buzz to and fro till something turned up. That was, broadly speaking, the notion!”  “And how did you suppose my daughter was to live while you were doing all this?”  “Well, I think,” said Archie, “I _think_ we rather expected _you_ to rally round a bit for the nonce!”  “I see! You expected to live on me?”  “Well, you put it a bit crudely, but—as far as I had mapped anything out—that WAS what you might call the general scheme of procedure. You don’t think much of it, what? Yes? No?”  Mr. Brewster exploded.  “No! I do not think much of it! Good God! You go out of my hotel—_my_ hotel—calling it all the names you could think of—roasting it to beat the band—”  “Trifle hasty!” murmured Archie, apologetically. “Spoke without thinking. Dashed tap had gone _drip-drip-drip_ all night—kept me awake—hadn’t had breakfast—bygones be bygones—!”  “Don’t interrupt! I say, you go out of my hotel, knocking it as no one has ever knocked it since it was built, and you sneak straight off and marry my daughter without my knowledge.”  “Did think of wiring for blessing. Slipped the old bean, somehow. You know how one forgets things!”  “And now you come back and calmly expect me to fling my arms round you and kiss you, and support you for the rest of your life!”  “Only while I’m nosing about and buzzing to and fro.”  “Well, I suppose I’ve got to support you. There seems no way out of it. I’ll tell you exactly what I propose to do. You think my hotel is a pretty poor hotel, eh? Well, you’ll have plenty of opportunity of judging, because you’re coming to live here. I’ll let you have a suite and I’ll let you have your meals, but outside of that—nothing doing! Nothing doing! Do you understand what I mean?”  “Absolutely! You mean, ‘Napoo!’”  “You can sign bills for a reasonable amount in my restaurant, and the hotel will look after your laundry. But not a cent do you get out of me. And, if you want your shoes shined, you can pay for it yourself in the basement. If you leave them outside your door, I’ll instruct the floor-waiter to throw them down the air-shaft. Do you understand? Good! Now, is there anything more you want to ask?”  Archie smiled a propitiatory smile.  “Well, as a matter of fact, I was going to ask if you would stagger along and have a bite with us in the grill-room?”  “I will not!”  “I’ll sign the bill,” said Archie, ingratiatingly. “You don’t think much of it? Oh, right-o!”     CHAPTER IV. WORK WANTED   It seemed to Archie, as he surveyed his position at the end of the first month of his married life, that all was for the best in the best of all possible worlds. In their attitude towards America, visiting Englishmen almost invariably incline to extremes, either detesting all that therein is or else becoming enthusiasts on the subject of the country, its climate, and its institutions. Archie belonged to the second class. He liked America and got on splendidly with Americans from the start. He was a friendly soul, a mixer; and in New York, that city of mixers, he found himself at home. The atmosphere of good-fellowship and the open-hearted hospitality of everybody he met appealed to him. There were moments when it seemed to him as though New York had simply been waiting for him to arrive before giving the word to let the revels commence.  Nothing, of course, in this world is perfect; and, rosy as were the glasses through which Archie looked on his new surroundings, he had to admit that there was one flaw, one fly in the ointment, one individual caterpillar in the salad. Mr. Daniel Brewster, his father-in-law, remained consistently unfriendly. Indeed, his manner towards his new relative became daily more and more a manner which would have caused gossip on the plantation if Simon Legree had exhibited it in his relations with Uncle Tom. And this in spite of the fact that Archie, as early as the third morning of his stay, had gone to him and in the most frank and manly way, had withdrawn his criticism of the Hotel Cosmopolis, giving it as his considered opinion that the Hotel Cosmopolis on closer inspection appeared to be a good egg, one of the best and brightest, and a bit of all right.  “A credit to you, old thing,” said Archie cordially.  “Don’t call me old thing!” growled Mr. Brewster.  “Right-o, old companion!” said Archie amiably.  Archie, a true philosopher, bore this hostility with fortitude, but it worried Lucille.  “I do wish father understood you better,” was her wistful comment when Archie had related the conversation.  “Well, you know,” said Archie, “I’m open for being understood any time he cares to take a stab at it.”  “You must try and make him fond of you.”  “But how? I smile winsomely at him and what not, but he doesn’t respond.”  “Well, we shall have to think of something. I want him to realise what an angel you are. You _are_ an angel, you know.”  “No, really?”  “Of course you are.”  “It’s a rummy thing,” said Archie, pursuing a train of thought which was constantly with him, “the more I see of you, the more I wonder how you can have a father like—I mean to say, what I mean to say is, I wish I had known your mother; she must have been frightfully attractive.”  “What would really please him, I know,” said Lucille, “would be if you got some work to do. He loves people who work.”  “Yes?” said Archie doubtfully. “Well, you know, I heard him interviewing that chappie behind the desk this morning, who works like the dickens from early morn to dewy eve, on the subject of a mistake in his figures; and, if he loved him, he dissembled it all right. Of course, I admit that so far I haven’t been one of the toilers, but the dashed difficult thing is to know how to start. I’m nosing round, but the openings for a bright young man seem so scarce.”  “Well, keep on trying. I feel sure that, if you could only find something to do, it doesn’t matter what, father would be quite different.”  It was possibly the dazzling prospect of making Mr. Brewster quite different that stimulated Archie. He was strongly of the opinion that any change in his father-in-law must inevitably be for the better. A chance meeting with James B. Wheeler, the artist, at the Pen-and-Ink Club seemed to open the way.  To a visitor to New York who has the ability to make himself liked it almost appears as though the leading industry in that city was the issuing of two-weeks’ invitation-cards to clubs. Archie since his arrival had been showered with these pleasant evidences of his popularity; and he was now an honorary member of so many clubs of various kinds that he had not time to go to them all. There were the fashionable clubs along Fifth Avenue to which his friend Reggie van Tuyl, son of his Florida hostess, had introduced him. There were the businessmen’s clubs of which he was made free by more solid citizens. And, best of all, there were the Lambs’, the Players’, the Friars’, the Coffee-House, the Pen-and-Ink,—and the other resorts of the artist, the author, the actor, and the Bohemian. It was in these that Archie spent most of his time, and it was here that he made the acquaintance of J. B. Wheeler, the popular illustrator.  To Mr. Wheeler, over a friendly lunch, Archie had been confiding some of his ambitions to qualify as the hero of one of the Get-on-or-get-out-young-man-step-lively-books.  “You want a job?” said Mr. Wheeler.  “I want a job,” said Archie.  Mr. Wheeler consumed eight fried potatoes in quick succession. He was an able trencherman.  “I always looked on you as one of our leading lilies of the field,” he said. “Why this anxiety to toil and spin?”  “Well, my wife, you know, seems to think it might put me one-up with the jolly old dad if I did something.”  “And you’re not particular what you do, so long as it has the outer aspect of work?”  “Anything in the"]]]
