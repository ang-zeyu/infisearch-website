Sin-         ners flourish \"like a green bay tree;\" but, looking farther,         the Psalmist could see their end, - the destruction of sin 5:21    through suffering.                          Cancellation of human sin          Prayer is not to be used as a confessional to cancel sin.         Such an error would impede true religion. Sin is forgiven 5:24    only as it is destroyed by Christ, - Truth and         Life. If prayer nourishes the belief that sin is         cancelled, and that man is made better merely by praying, 5:27    prayer is an evil. He grows worse who continues in sin         because he fancies himself forgiven.                             Diabolism destroyed          An apostle says that the Son of God [Christ] came to 5:30    \"destroy the /works/ of the devil.\" We should         follow our divine Exemplar, and seek the de-         struction of all evil works, error and disease included. 6:1     We cannot escape the penalty due for sin. The Scrip-         tures say, that if we deny Christ, \" he also will deny us.\"                            Pardon and amendment  6:3     Divine Love corrects and governs man. Men may         pardon, but this divine Principle alone reforms the         sinner. God is not separate from the wis- 6:6     dom He bestows. The talents He gives we         must improve. Calling on Him to forgive our work         badly done or left undone, implies the vain supposition 6:9     that we have nothing to do but to ask pardon, and         that afterwards we shall be free to repeat the offence.          To cause suffering as the result of sin, is the means 6:12    of destroying sin. Every supposed pleasure in sin         will furnish more than its equivalent of pain, until be-         lief in material life and sin is destroyed. To reach 6:15    heaven, the harmony of being, we must understand         the divine Principle of being.                          Mercy without partiality          \"God is Love.\" More than this we cannot ask, 6:18    higher we cannot look, farther we cannot go. To         suppose that God forgives or punishes sin         according as His mercy is sought or un- 6:21    sought, is to misunderstand Love and to make prayer         the safety-valve for wrong-doing.                               Divine severity          Jesus uncovered and rebuked sin before he cast it 6:24    out. Of a sick woman he said that Satan had bound         her, and to Peter he said, \"Thou art an of-         fence unto me.\" He came teaching and 6:27    showing men how to destroy sin, sickness, and death.         He said of the fruitless tree, \"[It] is hewn down.\"          It is believed by many that a certain magistrate, 6:30    who lived in the time of Jesus, left this record: \"His         rebuke is fearful.\" The strong language of our Mas-         ter confirms this description.  7:1     The only civil sentence which he had for error was,         \"Get thee behind me, Satan.\" Still stronger evidence 7:3     that Jesus' reproof was pointed and pungent is found         in his own words,- showing the necessity for such         forcible utterance, when he cast out devils and healed 7:6     the sick and sinning. The relinquishment of error de-         prives material sense of its false claims.                               Audible praying          Audible prayer is impressive; it gives momentary 7:9     solemnity and elevation to thought. But does it pro-         duce any lasting benefit? Looking deeply         into these things, we find that \"a zeal . . . 7:12    not according to knowledge\" gives occasion for reac-         tion unfavorable to spiritual growth, sober resolve, and         wholesome perception of God's requirements. The mo- 7:15    tives for verbal prayer may embrace too much love of         applause to induce or encourage Christian sentiment.                            Emotional utterances          Physical sensation, not Soul, produces material ec- 7:18    stasy and emotion. If spiritual sense always guided         men, there would grow out of ecstatic mo-         ments a higher experience and a better life 7:21    with more devout self-abnegation and purity. A self-         satisfied ventilation of fervent sentiments never makes         a Christian. God is not influenced by man. The \"di- 7:24    vine ear\" is not an auditory nerve. It is the all-hearing         and all-knowing Mind, to whom each need of man is         always known and by whom it will be supplied.                         Danger from audible prayer  7:27    The danger from prayer is that it may lead us into temp-         tation. By it we may become involuntary hypocrites, ut-         tering desires which are not real and consoling 7:30    ourselves in the midst of sin with the recollection         that we have prayed over it or mean to ask for-         giveness at some later day. Hypocrisy is fatal to religion.  8:1     A wordy prayer may afford a quiet sense of self-         justification, though it makes the sinner a hypocrite. 8:3     We never need to despair of an honest heart; but         there is little hope for those who come only spasmodi-         cally face to face with their wickedness and then seek to 8:6     hide it. Their prayers are indexes which do not correspond         with their character. They hold secret fellowship with         sin, and such externals are spoken of by Jesus as \"like 8:9     unto whited sepulchres . . . full . . . of all uncleanness.\"                             Aspiration and love          If a man, though apparently fervent and prayerful,         is impure and therefore insincere, what must be the 8:12    comment upon him? If he reached the         loftiness of his prayer, there would be no         occasion for comment. If we feel the aspiration, hu- 8:15    mility, gratitude, and love which our words express,-         this God accepts; and it is wise not to try to deceive         ourselves or others, for \"there is nothing covered that 8:18    shall not be revealed.\" Professions and audible pray-         ers are like charity in one respect,- they \"cover the         multitude of sins.\" Praying for humility with what- 8:21    ever fervency of expression does not always mean a         desire for it. If we turn away from the poor, we are         not ready to receive the reward of Him who blesses 8:24    the poor. We confess to having a very wicked heart         and ask that it may be laid bare before us, but do         we not already know more of this heart than we are 8:27    willing to have our neighbor see?                             Searching the heart          We should examine ourselves and learn what is the         affection and purpose of the heart, for in this way 8:30    only can we learn what we honestly are. If a         friend informs us of a fault, do we listen pa-         tiently to the rebuke and credit what is said? Do we not 9:1     rather give thanks that we are \"not as other men\"?         During many years the author has been most grateful 9:3     for merited rebuke. The wrong lies in unmerited cen-         sure,- in the falsehood which does no one any good.                            Summit of aspiration          The test of all prayer lies in the answer to these 9:6     questions: Do we love our neighbor better because of         this asking? Do we pursue the old selfish-         ness, satisfied with having prayed for some- 9:9     thing better, though we give no evidence of the sin-         cerity of our requests by living consistently with our         prayer? If selfishness has given place to kindness, 9:12    we shall regard our neighbor unselfishly, and bless         them that curse us; but we shall never meet this great         duty simply by asking that it may be done. There is 9:15    a cross to be taken up before we can enjoy the fruition         of our hope and faith.                             Practical religion          Dost thou \"love the Lord thy God with all thy 9:18    heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind\"?         This command includes much, even the sur-         render of all merely material sensation, affec- 9:21    tion, and worship. This is the El Dorado of Christianity.         It involves the Science of Life, and recognizes only the         divine control of Spirit, in which Soul is our master, 9:24    and material sense and human will have no place.                           The chalice sacrificial          Are you willing to leave all for Christ, for Truth, and         so be counted among sinners? No! Do you really desire 9:27    to attain this point? No! Then why make long         prayers about it and ask to be Christians,         since you do not care to tread in the footsteps of our 9:30    dear Master? If unwilling to follow his example, why         pray with the lips that you may be partakers of his         nature? Consistent prayer is the desire to do right. 10:1    Prayer means that we desire to walk and will walk in         the light so far as we receive it, even though with bleed- 10:3    ing footsteps, and that waiting patiently on the Lord,         we will leave our real desires to be rewarded by Him.          The world must grow to the spiritual understanding 10:6    of prayer. If good enough to profit by Jesus' cup of         earthly sorrows, God will sustain us under these sor-         rows. Until we are thus divinely qualified and are 10:9    willing to drink his cup, millions of vain repetitions         will never pour into prayer the unction of Spirit in         demonstration of power and \"with signs following.\" 10:12   Christian Science reveals a necessity for overcoming the         world, the flesh, and evil, and thus destroying all error.          Seeking is not sufficient. It is striving that enables 10:15   us to enter. Spiritual attainments open the door to a         higher understanding of the divine Life.
