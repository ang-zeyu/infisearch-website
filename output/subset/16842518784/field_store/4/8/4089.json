Midges among midges, the new pilots walked.  One said: \"But I see no cargo.\"  Another: \"These outworlders and their mystery....\"  All were sweating, all uncomfortable, but all grateful for the twenty credits a flight they would earn, whatever the cargo turned out to be.  \"What do you think?\" Pandit asked Sria.  \"I think I've never been so hot in my life. I feel like I'm being broiled alive.\"  \"Here comes the Denebian now.\"  They had been driven into the Empty Places in a sand sled. The trip had taken two days but because the sled was air-conditioned no one had objected. When they saw the half dozen jets they knew why a sled had taken them into the wilderness. The jets were small cargo-carriers with room for pilot, co-pilot and perhaps a ton of cargo in each. Whatever it was the Denebians wanted exported, it didn't take up much room.  Orkap of Deneb walked toward them past the first of the jets. He began without preamble: \"Your cargo is packed and ready to be moved in an underground vault five hundred yards from here. You will break up into pairs, a pilot and co-pilot for each jet.\" Sria Krishna and Pandit had already paired themselves together. \"You work on your own time, getting the cargo with trundle-sleds, loading it, taking off, delivering it to the Denebian freighter at the spaceport. When you are finished, you collect your pay.\"  \"Where do we sleep?\" someone asked.         *       *       *       *       *  Orkap smiled. \"You didn't come out here to sleep. There is only a limited amount of cargo. The jets are swift. You will be paid according to the amount of work you do. Any other questions?\"  \"What about food?\" a plump young Ophiuchan asked.  \"You will be given energy tablets, as many as you wish. Any other questions? No? Good. I have two additional things to say. First, you are not to examine your cargo under any circumstances, either here, or in transit, or on the spacefield. There are televid pick-up units in each jet, so you will be watched at all times. Second--\" Orkap paused and let the silence grow and spread across the dazzling white expanse--\"there is a spy among you, wearing the body of an Ophiuchan but in reality--well, I don't have to tell you who he is in reality.\" Orkap smiled grimly. \"There is only one body-changer in the galaxy, but one is quite enough.\"  One of the pilots said, a little breathlessly: \"Johnny Mayhem!\"  Orkap smiled again. \"I am aware of Mayhem's identity,\" he said, \"but I'm not going to do anything about it.\"  The pilots waited. The sun glared down balefully. \"You see,\" Orkap told them, \"we cannot be altogether sure that the rest of you are here simply to earn your twenty credits a flight. Mayhem has unwittingly become our insurance. Find Mayhem! Find the spy among you! A hundred credits bonus to the man who does!\"         *       *       *       *       *  Pandit looked at Sria, who whistled. The girl said: \"If they think we can finish the job without sleep, picking up cargo and flying it to the spaceport and returning for more, then a hundred credits is probably more than any of us will earn. They'll all be looking like hawks for this Mayhem.\"  \"And,\" Pandit agreed, \"if there's a native spy among them, he'd be afraid to show himself for fear they'll think he's Mayhem. Very clever of the Denebians.\"  \"... to work at once,\" Orkap was saying. He wore a blaster on his hip, the only weapon among them. They all trudged behind him through the burning, faceless sands. Soon they reached a depression from which the sand had been cleared, baring the white bedrock of the Empty Places. In the rock a square opening had been cut, shielded on each side from the shifting sands by an up-curving lip. A ramp led down into darkness.  \"You will find your cargo down there. Also enough trundle-sleds to go around,\" Orkap explained. \"The cargo is crated. The crates must remain intact. Is that understood?\"  It was understood.  Their sudden mutual suspicion a pall worse than the heat, the Ophiuchans descended the ramp. They needed the money or they wouldn't be here. The money meant more to them than anything: this was no time to be far-sighted. Yet one of them was a spy for the Galactic League--Johnny Mayhem.  One of them, but which?  Pandit made a quick estimate of the number of crates. They were stacked neatly against one wall, each about four feet by four by four. And from the size of them, a single crate would fill the cargo bay of each of the jets. Pandit made a rough estimate. Two dozen crates, perhaps. In the dim light it was hard to tell. Two dozen crates, six jets, twelve Ophiuchans. Four trips for each jet. A half hour to load, ten minutes to unload, an hour and a half by jet to the spacefield. Three hours and forty minutes, round trip. Say, four hours. Four times four, sixteen. Sixteen hours of steady work for eighty credits. No time for mystery or suspicion. Barely time for mistrust....  \"You, there!\" a voice called. \"What are you doing?\"  It was one of the other Ophiuchans, quite the biggest of the lot. Pandit had seen him outside and remembered his name. He was Raj Shiva, a tall, muscular, swarthy Ophiuchan, with small, alert, suspicious eyes and a livid scar alongside his jaw.  \"Nothing,\" Pandit said. \"Nothing.\"  \"No? The others are loading already. I'll be watching you.\"  For a hundred credits, Pandit thought furiously, but said nothing. Sria touched his shoulder. \"I have one of the trundle-sleds,\" she said. \"Let's get about it.\"  \"Right,\" said Pandit.  Raj Shiva watched them a few moments longer, then drifted away with his own partner. It took Pandit and Sria, sweating copiously in the tremendous heat, a few minutes less than half an hour to load one of the crates aboard their jet. Three of the other ships were already airborne, whining away toward the spacefield.  Pandit looked at the crate. There were no markings on it anywhere. The wood looked new, but that meant absolutely nothing. In the dry heat of the Empty Places, wood would last a century, a millennium. They could not tell how old it was.         *       *       *       *       *  \"Ready?\" Sria Krishna called from the controls.  Pandit had secured the crate in the cargo bay. \"Ready,\" he responded.  Moments later acceleration thrust them back in the twin pilot seats.  Sria leveled the jet at twenty thousand and they sped at eight hundred miles an hour toward the city and the spacefield just beyond it.  \"Do you wonder about it?\" Sria asked after a while.  \"About what?\"  \"The cargo.\"  \"We aren't supposed to.\"  \"I know.\" Sria laughed. \"I'm a woman, you see.\"  Pandit grinned at her. \"Curiosity,\" he said. \"A woman's trait on any world.\"  Sria got up from the pilot chair but Pandit placed his hand on her shoulder and gently shoved her down again. \"They have a televid unit aboard,\" he said, \"remember?\"  Sria nodded. The jet sped on.  They landed at the spacefield. They were the fourth jet down and one of the other three had taken off on the return leg of the flight. A Denebian Pandit had never seen before was supervising the loin-cloth garbed laborers loading the crates aboard a Denebian spaceship. With Sria he delivered their crate on the trundle-sled, returned with the sled to their jet, and took off.         *       *       *       *       *  Just short of four hours from the time they started they returned to the Empty Places. They had gained a little time and were the second team down. From the jet ahead of them, Raj Shiva led a puny, middle-aged co-pilot.  Orkap stood in the underground storage room. Looking at his wrist chrono he said to the four Ophiuchans who came down the ramp: \"You made fine time.\" Raj Shiva's puny companion said something, but Raj Shiva grabbed his arm and they began to load a second crate. Pandit and Sria loaded theirs in silence.  They made their second round trip in four hours exactly. It was completely dark when they returned to the Empty Places. Sria was worried they would overshoot the cargo point, but Pandit brought the little jet down within a few hundred yards of its takeoff point.  They could see nothing when they shut off the jet's running lights, except for the glow which came from the underground room. They reached it and went down the ramp. Pandit judged that half the crates were gone now. He took a quick tour of the dimly-lit room while Sria got the trundle-sled into position against one of the crates.  \"Nobody here,\" Pandit said in a whisper. \"The Denebian must be sleeping in the sand-sled.\"  \"Yes,\" Sria said a little breathlessly.  \"I was thinking--\"  \"What?\" Sria said. \"Don't stop.\"  \"If we wanted to examine one of the boxes, it would be suicide to open the one we take. But we could open one of them down here, see what it is, take another for ourselves--\"  \"You would do this?\" Sria asked him. \"Why?\"  Pandit shrugged. \"I have eyes,\" he said. \"Our gurus did not broadcast the death-wish to outworlders until the Denebians came. Then they started. Have the Denebians sold them on the idea?\"  \"I don't know,\" Sria said.  \"Well, let's assume they have. Why? Why would they do such a thing, Sria?\"         *       *       *       *       *  \"Let me get this straight, Pandit. First, you think the gurus actually are making the outworlders kill themselves?\"  \"Of course,\" Pandit said. \"It's mental suggestion, on a scale only our gurus are capable of. But don't you see, Sria, they wouldn't do it on their own. The gurus are dirty, careless about their bodies--but terribly arrogant. Left alone, they wouldn't think the outworlders important enough to be concerned over one way or another. They certainly wouldn't kill them.\"  \"Go on,\" Sria urged.  \"All right. The gurus have great knowledge of the mystical, but externally they're naive. Let's suppose someone came along--the Denebians in this case--and found something they wanted very badly on Ophiuchus. These crates here, Sria. What would they do? They'd go to the gurus and"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32828"],["title","Backlash (#1)"],["body","us a gross margin of $800 to work with. He assured me that upkeep and repairs on the robot units were negligible, and we could extend a very generous warranty which the Ollies would make good in the event of failure. He gave me a quick rundown on the care and feeding of a Sirian Soth, and then jolted me with:  \"There is just a single other favor I beg of you. Would you do my little colony the exquisite honor of accepting this Soth as your personal servant, Mr. Collins?\"  \"Servant?\"         *       *       *       *       *  He bobbed his head. \"Yes, sir. We have trained him in the rudiments of the household duties and conventions of your culture. He learns rapidly and never forgets an instruction. Your wife would find Soth most useful, I am quite certain.\"  \"A magnificent specimen like this doing _housework_?\" I marveled at the little creature's empty-headedness.  \"Again I must beg your pardon, sir. I overlooked mentioning a suggestion by the Secretary of Labor that the Soths be sold only for use in domestic service. It was also the consensus of the President's whole cabinet that the economy of any nation could not cope with the problem of unemployment were our Soths to be made available for all the types of work for which they are fitted.\"  My dream of empire collapsed. The little green fellow was undoubtedly telling the truth. The unions would strike any plant or facility in the world where a Soth put foot on the job. It would ruin our retail consumer business, too--Soths wouldn't consume automobiles, copters, theater tickets and filets mignon.  \"Yes, Mr. Johnson,\" I sighed. \"I'll be happy to try out your Soth. We have a place out in the country where he'll come in handy.\"  The Ollie duly expressed his ecstasy at my decision, and backed out of my office waving his copy of the contract. I had assured him that our board of directors would meet within a week and confirm my signature.  I looked up at the hairless giant. As general director of the Home Appliance Division of Worldwide Machines, Incorporated, I had made a deal, all right. The first interplanetary business deal in history.  But for some reason, I couldn't escape the feeling that I'd been had.         *       *       *       *       *  On the limoucopter, they charged me double fare for Soth's transportation to the private field where I kept my boat. As we left Detroit, I watched him stare down at the flattened skyline, but he did it with the unseeing expression of an old commuter.  Jack, my personal pilot, had eyed my passenger at the airport with some concern and sullen muttering. Now he made much of trimming ship after takeoff. The boat did seem logy with the unaccustomed ballast--it was a four-passenger Arrow, built for speed, and Soth had to crouch and spread all over the two rear seats. But he did so without complaint or comment for the half-hour hop up to our estate on my favorite Canadian lake.  As the four hundred miles unreeled below us, I wondered how Vicki would react to Soth. I should have phoned her, but how do you describe a Soth to a semi-invalid whose principal excitement is restricted to bird-watching and repotting puny geraniums, and a rare sunfishing expedition to the end of our floating pier?  Well, it was Friday, and I would have the whole weekend to work the robot into our routine. I had called my friend, Dr. Frederick Hilliard, a retired industrial psychologist, and invited him to drop over tonight if he wanted an interesting surprise. He was our nearest neighbor and my most frequent chess partner, who lived a secluded bachelor's life in a comfortable cabin on the far shore of our lake.  As we came in for a water landing, I saw Fred's boat at our pier. Then I could make out Fred, Vicki and Clumsy, our Irish setter, all waiting for me. I hoped Fred's presence would help simmer Vicki down a little.  We drifted in to the dock, and I turned to Soth and told him to help my pilot unload the supplies. This pleased Jack, whose Pilot and Chauffeur's Local frequently reminded me in polite little bulletins that its members were not obligated to perform other than technical services for their employers.  Then I got out and said hello to Vicki and Fred as casually as possible. Vicki kissed me warmly on the mouth, which she does when she's excited, and then clung to me and let the day's tension soak out of her.  How you get tense in a Twenty-first Century home in the midst of the Canadian wilderness is something I've never been able to figure out, but Vicki's super-imagination managed daily to defeat her doctor's orders for peace and quiet.  \"I'm glad you're home, dear,\" she said. \"When Fred came over ahead of time I knew something was up, and I'm all unraveled with curiosity.\"  Just then Soth emerged from the boat with our whole week's supply of foodstuffs and assorted necessities bundled under his long arms.  \"Oh, dear God, a dinner guest!\" Vicki exclaimed. Tears started into her reproachful eyes and her slender little figure stiffened in my arms.         *       *       *       *       *  I swung her around, hooked arms with her and Fred, and started up the path.  \"Not a guest,\" I told her. \"He's a servant who will make the beds, clean up and all sorts of things, and if you don't like him we'll turn him in on a new model laundry unit, and don't start worrying about being alone with him--he's a robot.\"  \"A robot!\" Fred said, and both their heads swiveled to stare back.  \"Yes,\" I said. \"That's why I wanted you here tonight, Fred. I'd like to have you sort of go over him and--well, you know--\"  I didn't want to say, _make sure he's safe_. Not in Vicki's presence. But Fred caught my eye and nodded.  I started to tell them of my visitor, and the contract with the castaways from space. Halfway through, Clumsy interrupted me with his excited barking. I looked back. Clumsy was galloping a frantic circle around Soth, cutting in and out, threatening to make an early dinner of the intruder's leg.  Before I could speak, Soth opened his lips and let out a soft hiss through his white teeth. Clumsy flattened to the ground and froze, and Soth continued after us without a further glance at the dog.  Fred looked at Vicki's tense face and laughed. \"I'll have to learn that trick ... Clumsy's chewed the cuffs off three pairs of my best slacks.\"  Vicki smiled uncertainly, and went into the house. I showed Soth where to stow the supplies, and told him to remain in the kitchen. He just froze where he stood.  Fred was making drinks when I returned to the living room.  \"Looks docile enough, Cliff,\" he told me.  \"Strong as a horse and gentle as a lamb,\" I said. \"I want you two to help me find out what his talents are. I'll have to prepare a paper on him for the board of directors Monday.\"  There were nervous whitecaps on Vicki's drink.  I patted her shoulder. \"I'll break him into the housekeeping routine, honey. You won't have him staring over your shoulder.\"  She tried to relax. \"But he's so quiet--and big!\"  \"Who wants a noisy little servant around?\" Fred said helpfully. \"And how about that rock retaining-wall Cliff is always about to build for your garden? And you really don't love housework, do you, Vicki?\"  \"I don't mind the chores,\" she said. \"But it might be fun to have a big fellow like that to shove around.\" She was trying valiantly to hold up her end, but the vein in her temple was throbbing.         *       *       *       *       *  Well, the next forty-eight hours were more than interesting. Soth turned out to be what the doctor ordered, literally and figuratively. After I'd taken him on a tour of the place, I showed him how to work the automatic devices--food preparation, laundry and cleaning. And after one lesson, he served us faultless meals with a quiet efficiency that was actually restful, even miraculously to Vicki.  She began relaxing in his presence and planning a few outside projects \"to get our money's worth\" out of the behemoth. This was our earliest joke about Soth, because he certainly was no expense or problem to maintain. As the Ollie had promised, he thrived on our table scraps and a pink concoction which he mixed by pouring a few drops of purple liquid from a pocket vial into a gallon pitcher of water. The stuff would be supplied by the Ollies at a cost of about a dollar eighty a week.  Saturday afternoon, Vicki bravely took over teaching him the amenities of butlering and the intricacies of bed-making. After a short session in the bedroom, she came out looking thoughtful.  \"He's awfully real looking,\" she said. \"And you can't read a darned thing in his eyes. How far can you trust him, Cliff? You know--around women?\"  Fred looked at me with a raised eyebrow and said, \"Well, let's find out.\"  We sat down and called Soth into the living room. He came and stood before us, erect, poised and motionless.  Fred said, \"Disrobe. Remove all your clothing. Strip!\"  Vicki sucked in her breath.  The Soth replied instantly, \"Your order conflicts with my conditioning. I must not remove my covering in the presence of an Earthwoman.\"  Fred scratched his gray temple thoughtfully. \"Then, Vicki, would you mind disrobing, please?\"  She gulped again. Fred was an old friend, but not exactly the family doctor.  He sensed her mild outrage. \"You'll never stop wondering if you don't,\" he said.  She looked at Fred, me, and then Soth. Then she stood up gingerly, as if edging into a cold shower, gritted her teeth, grasped the catch to her full-length zipper of her blue lounging suit and stripped it from armpit to ankle. As she stepped out of it, I saw why she had peeled it off like you would a piece of adhesive tape: It was a warm day, and she wore no undergarments.         *       *       *       *       *  [Illustration]  Soth moved so softly I didn't hear him go, but Fred was watching him--Fred's eyes were where they belonged. Soth stopped in the archway to the dining room with his back turned. Fred was at his side.  \"Why did you leave?\" Fred demanded.  \"I "]]]
