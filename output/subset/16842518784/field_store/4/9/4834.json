What the people deem worthy of reward and punishment is that which Heaven wishes to punish and reward.  There is an intimate communication between Heaven and the people: let those who govern the people, therefore, be watchful and cautious.\"  Confucius expressed the same idea in another manner:  \"Gain the affection of the people, and you gain empire.  Lose the affection of the people, and you lose empire.\" There, then, general reason was regarded as queen of the world, a distinction which elsewhere has been bestowed upon revelations. The Tao-te-king is still more explicit.  In this work, which is but an outline criticism of pure reason, the philosopher Lao-tse continually identifies, under the name of TAO, universal reason and the infinite being; and all the obscurity of the book of Lao tse consists, in my opinion, of this constant identification of principles which our religious and metaphysical habits have so widely separated.    Notice further that, in attributing to the vague and (so to speak) objectified consciousness of a universal reason the first revelation of Divinity, we assume absolutely nothing concerning even the reality or non-reality of God.  In fact, admitting that God is nothing more than collective instinct or universal reason, we have still to learn what this universal reason is in itself. For, as we shall show directly, universal reason is not given in individual reason, in other words, the knowledge of social laws, or the theory of collective ideas, though deduced from the fundamental concepts of pure reason, is nevertheless wholly empirical, and never would have been discovered a priori by means of deduction, induction, or synthesis.  Whence it follows that universal reason, which we regard as the origin of these laws; universal reason, which exists, reasons, labors, in a separate sphere and as a reality distinct from pure reason, just as the planetary system, though created according to the laws of mathematics, is a reality distinct from mathematics, whose existence could not have been deduced from mathematics alone: it follows, I say, that universal reason is, in modern languages, exactly what the ancients called God.  The name is changed: what do we know of the thing?  Let us now trace the evolution of the Divine idea.  The Supreme Being once posited by a primary mystical judgment, man immediately generalizes the subject by another mysticism,--analogy.  God, so to speak, is as yet but a point: directly he shall fill the world.  As, in sensing his social me, man saluted his AUTHOR, so, in finding evidence of design and intention in animals, plants, springs, meteors, and the whole universe, he attributes to each special object, and then to the whole, a soul, spirit, or genius presiding over it; pursuing this inductive process of apotheosis from the highest summit of Nature, which is society, down to the humblest forms of life, to inanimate and inorganic matter.  From his collective me, taken as the superior pole of creation, to the last atom of matter, man EXTENDS, then, the idea of God,--that is, the idea of personality and intelligence,--just as God himself EXTENDED HEAVEN, as the book of Genesis tells us; that is, created space and time, the conditions of all things.  Thus, without a God or master-builder, the universe and man would not exist: such is the social profession of faith.  But also without man God would not be thought, or--to clear the interval--God would be nothing.  If humanity needs an author, God and the gods equally need a revealer; theogony, the history of heaven, hell, and their inhabitants,--those dreams of the human mind,--is the counterpart of the universe, which certain philosophers have called in return the dream of God.  And how magnificent this theological creation, the work of society!  The creation of the demiourgos was obliterated; what we call the Omnipotent was conquered; and for centuries the enchanted imagination of mortals was turned away from the spectacle of Nature by the contemplation of Olympian marvels.  Let us descend from this fanciful region: pitiless reason knocks at the door; her terrible questions demand a reply.  \"What is God?\" she asks; \"where is he? what is his extent? what are his wishes? what his powers? what his promises?\"--and here, in the light of analysis, all the divinities of heaven, earth, and hell are reduced to an incorporeal, insensible, immovable, incomprehensible, undefinable I-know-not-what; in short, to a negation of all the attributes of existence.  In fact, whether man attributes to each object a special spirit or genius, or conceives the universe as governed by a single power, he in either case but SUPPOSES an unconditioned, that is, an impossible, entity, that he may deduce therefrom an explanation of such phenomena as he deems inconceivable on any other hypothesis.  The mystery of God and reason!  In order to render the object of his idolatry more and more RATIONAL, the believer despoils him successively of all the qualities which would make him REAL; and, after marvellous displays of logic and genius, the attributes of the Being par excellence are found to be the same as those of nihility.  This evolution is inevitable and fatal: atheism is at the bottom of all theodicy.  Let us try to understand this progress.  God, creator of all things, is himself no sooner created by the conscience,--in other words, no sooner have we lifted God from the idea of the social me to the idea of the cosmic me,--than immediately our reflection begins to demolish him under the pretext of perfecting him.  To perfect the idea of God, to purify the theological dogma, was the second hallucination of the human race.  The spirit of analysis, that untiring Satan who continually questions and denies, must sooner or later look for proof of religious dogmas.  Now, whether the philosopher determine the idea of God, or declare it indeterminable; whether he approach it with his reason, or retreat from it,--I say that this idea receives a blow; and, as it is impossible for speculation to halt, the idea of God must at last disappear.  Then the atheistic movement is the second act of the theologic drama; and this second act follows from the first, as effect from cause.  \"The heavens declare the glory of God,\" says the Psalmist.  Let us add, And their testimony dethrones him.  Indeed, in proportion as man observes phenomena, he thinks that he perceives, between Nature and God, intermediaries; such as relations of number, form, and succession; organic laws, evolutions, analogies,-- forming an unmistakable series of manifestations which invariably produce or give rise to each other.  He even observes that, in the development of this society of which he is a part, private wills and associative deliberations have some influence; and he says to himself that the Great Spirit does not act upon the world directly and by himself, or arbitrarily and at the dictation of a capricious will, but mediately, by perceptible means or organs, and by virtue of laws.  And, retracing in his mind the chain of effects and causes, he places clear at the extremity, as a balance, God.  A poet has said,--  Par dela tous les cieux, le Dieu des cieux reside.  Thus, at the first step in the theory, the Supreme Being is reduced to the function of a motive power, a mainspring, a corner-stone, or, if a still more trivial comparison may be allowed me, a constitutional sovereign, reigning but not governing, swearing to obey the law and appointing ministers to execute it.  But, under the influence of the mirage which fascinates him, the theist sees, in this ridiculous system, only a new proof of the sublimity of his idol; who, in his opinion, uses his creatures as instruments of his power, and causes the wisdom of human beings to redound to his glory.  Soon, not content with limiting the power of the Eternal, man, increasingly deicidal in his tendencies, insists on sharing it.  If I am a spirit, a sentient me giving voice to ideas, continues the theist, I consequently am a part of absolute existence; I am free, creative, immortal, equal with God.  Cogito, ergo sum,--I think, therefore I am immortal, that is the corollary, the translation of Ego sum qui sum: philosophy is in accord with the Bible.  The existence of God and the immortality of the soul are posited by the conscience in the same judgment: there, man speaks in the name of the universe, to whose bosom he transports his me; here, he speaks in his own name, without perceiving that, in this going and coming, he only repeats himself.  The immortality of the soul, a true division of divinity, which, at the time of its first promulgation, arriving after a long interval, seemed a heresy to those faithful to the old dogma, has been none the less considered the complement of divine majesty, necessarily postulated by eternal goodness and justice. Unless the soul is immortal, God is incomprehensible, say the theists; resembling in this the political theorists who regard sovereign representation and perpetual tenure of office as essential conditions of monarchy.  But the inconsistency of the ideas is as glaring as the parity of the doctrines is exact: consequently the dogma of immortality soon became the stumbling-block of philosophical theologians, who, ever since the days of Pythagoras and Orpheus, have been making futile attempts to harmonize divine attributes with human liberty, and reason with faith.  A subject of triumph for the impious! . . . .  But the illusion could not yield so soon: the dogma of immortality, for the very reason that it was a limitation of the uncreated Being, was a step in advance.  Now, though the human mind deceives itself by a partial acquisition of the truth, it never retreats, and this perseverance in progress is proof of its infallibility.  Of this we shall soon see fresh evidence.  In making himself like God, man made"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/444"],["title","System of Economical Contradictions; Or, The Philosophy of Misery (#2)"],["body"," like himself: this correlation, which for many centuries had been execrated, was the secret spring which determined the new myth.  In the days of the patriarchs God made an alliance with man; now, to strengthen the compact, God is to become a man.  He will take on our flesh, our form, our passions, our joys, and our sorrows; will be born of woman, and die as we do.  Then, after this humiliation of the infinite, man will still pretend that he has elevated the ideal of his God in making, by a logical conversion, him whom he had always called creator, a saviour, a redeemer.  Humanity does not yet say, I am God: such a usurpation would shock its piety; it says, God is in me, IMMANUEL, nobiscum Deus.  And, at the moment when philosophy with pride, and universal conscience with fright, shouted with unanimous voice, The gods are departing! excedere deos! a period of eighteen centuries of fervent adoration and superhuman faith was inaugurated.  But the fatal end approaches.  The royalty which suffers itself to be limited will end by the rule of demagogues; the divinity which is defined dissolves in a pandemonium.  Christolatry is the last term of this long evolution of human thought.  The angels, saints, and virgins reign in heaven with God, says the catechism; and demons and reprobates live in the hells of eternal punishment.  Ultramundane society has its left and its right: it is time for the equation to be completed; for this mystical hierarchy to descend upon earth and appear in its real character.  When Milton represents the first woman admiring herself in a fountain, and lovingly extending her arms toward her own image as if to embrace it, he paints, feature for feature, the human race.--This God whom you worship, O man! this God whom you have made good, just, omnipotent, omniscient, immortal, and holy, is yourself: this ideal of perfection is your image, purified in the shining mirror of your conscience.  God, Nature, and man are three aspects of one and the same being; man is God himself arriving at self-consciousness through a thousand evolutions.  In Jesus Christ man recognized himself as God; and Christianity is in reality the religion of God-man.  There is no other God than he who in the beginning said, ME; there is no other God than THEE.  Such are the last conclusions of philosophy, which dies in unveiling religion's mystery and its own.   II.   It seems, then, that all is ended; it seems that, with the cessation of the worship and mystification of humanity by itself, the theological problem is for ever put aside.  The gods have gone: there is nothing left for man but to grow weary and die in his egoism.  What frightful solitude extends around me, and forces its way to the bottom of my soul!  My exaltation resembles annihilation; and, since I made myself a God, I seem but a shadow.  It is possible that I am still a ME, but it is very difficult to regard myself as the absolute; and, if I am not the absolute, I am only half of an idea.  Some ironical thinker, I know not who, has said:  \"A little philosophy leads away from religion, and much philosophy leads back to it.\"  This proposition is humiliatingly true.  Every science develops in three successive periods, which may be called--comparing them with the grand periods of civilization--the religious period, the sophistical period, the scientific period.[3]  Thus, alchemy represents the religious period of the science afterwards called chemistry, whose definitive plan is not yet discovered; likewise astrology was the religious period of another science, since established,--astronomy.   [3] See, among others, Auguste Comte, \"Course of Positive Philosophy,\" and P. J. Proudhon, \"Creation of Order in Humanity.\"    Now, after being laughed at for sixty years about the philosopher's stone, chemists, governed by experience, no longer dare to deny the transmutability of bodies; while astronomers are led by the structure of the world to suspect also an organism of the world; that is, something precisely like astrology.  Are we not justified in saying, in imitation of the philosopher just quoted, that, if a little chemistry leads away from the philosopher's stone, much chemistry leads back to it; and similarly, that, if a little astronomy makes us laugh at astrologers, much astronomy will make us believe in them?[4]   [4] I do not mean to affirm here in a positive manner the transmutability of bodies, or to point it out as a subject for investigation; still less do I pretend to say what ought to be the opinion of savants upon this point.  I wish only to call attention to the species of scepticism generated in every uninformed mind by the most general conclusions of chemical philosophy, or, better, by the irreconcilable hypotheses which serve as the basis of its theories.  Chemistry is truly the despair of reason: on all sides it mingles with the fanciful; and the more knowledge of it we gain by experience, the more it envelops itself in impenetrable mysteries.  This thought was recently suggested to me by reading M. Liebig's \"Letters on Chemistry\" (Paris, Masgana, 1845, translation of Bertet-Dupiney and Dubreuil Helion).  Thus M. Liebig, after having banished from science hypothetical causes and all the entities admitted by the ancients,--such as the creative power of matter, the horror of a vacuum, the esprit recteur, etc. (p. 22),--admits immediately, as necessary to the comprehension of chemical phenomena, a series of entities no less obscure,--vital force, chemical force, electric force, the force of attraction, etc. (pp. 146, 149).  One might call it a realization of the properties of bodies, in imitation of the psychologists' realization of the faculties of the soul under the names liberty, imagination, memory, etc.  Why not keep to the elements?  Why, if the atoms have weight of their own, as M. Liebig appears to believe, may they not also have electricity and life of their own?  Curious thing! the phenomena of matter, like those of mind, become intelligible only by supposing them to be produced by unintelligible forces and governed by contradictory laws: such is the inference to be drawn from every page of M. Liebig's book.  Matter, according to M. Liebig, is essentially inert and entirely destitute of spontaneous activity (p. 148): why, then, do the atoms have weight?  Is not the weight inherent in atoms the real, eternal, and spontaneous motion of matter?  And that which we chance to regard as rest,--may it not be equilibrium rather? Why, then, suppose now an inertia which definitions contradict, now an external potentiality which nothing proves?  Atoms having WEIGHT, M. Liebig infers that they are INDIVISIBLE (p. 58).  What logic!  Weight is only force, that is, a thing hidden from the senses, whose phenomena alone are perceptible,--a thing, consequently, to which the idea of division and indivision is inapplicable; and from the presence of this force, from the hypothesis of an indeterminate and immaterial entity, is inferred an indivisible material existence!  For the rest, M. Liebig confesses that it is IMPOSSIBLE FOR THE MIND to conceive of particles absolutely indivisible; he recognizes, further, that the FACT of this indivisibility is not proved; but he adds that science cannot dispense with this hypothesis: so that, by the confession of its teachers, chemistry has for its point of departure a fiction as repugnant to the mind as it is foreign to experience.  What irony!  Atoms are unequal in weight, says M. Liebig, because unequal in volume: nevertheless, it is impossible to demonstrate that chemical equivalents express the relative weight of atoms, or, in other words, that what the calculation of atomic equivalents leads us to regard as an atom is not composed of several atoms. This is tantamount to saying that MORE MATTER weighs more than LESS MATTER; and, since weight is the essence of materiality, we may logically conclude that, weight being universally identical with itself, there is also an identity in matter; that the differences of simple bodies are due solely, either to different methods of atomic association, or to different degrees of molecular condensation, and that, in reality, atoms are transmutable: which M. Liebig does not admit.  \"We have,\" he says, \"no reason for believing that one element is convertible into another element\" (p. 135).  What do you know about it?  The reasons for believing in such a conversion can very well exist and at the same time escape your attention; and it is not certain that your intelligence in this respect has risen to the level of your experience.  But, admitting the negative argument of M. Liebig, what follows?  That, with about fifty-six exceptions, irreducible as yet, all matter is in a condition of perpetual metamorphosis.  Now, it is a law of our reason to suppose in Nature unity of substance as well as unity of force and system; moreover, the series of chemical compounds and simple substances themselves leads us irresistibly to this conclusion.  Why, then, refuse to follow to the end the road opened by science, and to admit an hypothesis which is the inevitable result of experience itself?  M. Liebig not only denies the transmutability of elements, but rejects the spontaneous formation of germs.  Now, if we reject the spontaneous formation of germs, we are forced to admit their eternity; and as, on the other hand, geology proves that the globe has not been inhabited always, we must admit also that, at a given moment, the eternal germs of animals and plants were born, without father or mother, over the whole face of the earth.  Thus, the denial of spontaneous generation leads back to the hypothesis of spontaneity: what is there in much-derided metaphysics more contradictory?  Let it not be thought, however, that I deny the value and certainty of chemical theories, or that the atomic theory seems to me absurd, or that I share the Epicurean opinion as to spontaneous generation.  Once more, all that"]]]
