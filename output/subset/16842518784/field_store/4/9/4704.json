Two of Air Marshal Goering's winged vultures were hoping to--  \"There they are, chaps!\" Flight Lieutenant Barton-Woods' voice came through the earphones. \"Turn right a quarter, and a thousand feet above us. Tally-ho, lads! The blighters! They spotted us and are turning back! After them, Green Flight!\"  Dave and Freddy had already spotted the two would-be raiders off to their right front and a thousand feet or so higher. The huge twin-engine craft were halfway around in a bank back toward the east, and the rays of the sun on their metal wings and sides made them look like prehistoric birds of glistening silver cutting through the air.  Keeping his eyes glued to them, Dave hunched forward slightly in his seat and slid one thumb up to rest on the trigger button on his control stick. One jab at that button and the eight Vickers high speed machine guns cowled into the Spitfire's wings, four on each side, would spew out a shower of destruction at the rate of over nine thousand bullets a minute. All eight guns were sighted to converge at a point some two hundred yards in front of the ship. And anything that crossed that spot when those eight guns were hammering out their song was doomed to a lot of trouble--and nine times out of ten just plain, naturally doomed.  For a split second Dave took his eyes off the Junkers trying to scoot back home and shot a quick glance at Freddy Farmer. His lips twisted back in a happy smile, and a warm comforting glow drifted through him. Good old Freddy. Always there just off his wingtip. A pilot in a million, as far as Dave was concerned. They flew like a team that had been working together for years instead of only a few months. Each seemed to sense instantly, whether on a routine practice patrol or in the middle of a bullet-barking dog fight, just what the other was going to do. And as a result of the perfect coordination between them, more times than not they got exactly what they went after. As Squadron Leader Trenton, 207's commanding officer, had once remarked:  \"They're the babies of the Squadron, but I jolly well wish I had a whole squadron of babies!\"  At that moment a short, savage burst from Flight Lieutenant Barton-Woods' guns snapped Dave's eyes back to the Junkers. They were still quite a ways off but the Green Flight leader had let go with a challenging burst hoping that the Germans would give up thoughts of escape and turn back to give battle. However, it was instantly obvious that the Junkers pilots and their crews didn't want any truck with three Spitfire pilots. The nose of each ship was pushed down a bit to add speed to the get away attempt. And a moment later Dave saw the flash of sunlight on bombs dropping harmlessly down into the rolling grey-green swells where the Channel blends in with the North Sea.  \"Not this day, my little Jerries!\" Flight Lieutenant Barton-Woods' voice boomed over the radio. \"Let's make the beggars pay for dropping bombs in our Channel, Green Flight! Give it to them!\"  The last was more or less the signal that each pilot was on his own. Dave waited until he saw his flight leader swerve off to slam in at the Junkers to the right. Then he touched rudder, and with Freddy sticking right with him, swerved off after the other German raider. They were real close now, well within gun range, and as the pair slid out to take up attack positions the Junkers' gunners started throwing nickel jacketed lead. The wavy smoke of tracers whipped and zipped by a few feet over Dave's head. He laughed into his mike and dropped his nose and cut sharply off to the right. Freddy did the same, only off to the left.  No sooner had they started the cutting away maneuver than they cut right back in again. The German gunners saw them coming and fired their guns savagely, but those two R.A.F. lads tore in like a couple of man-made birds gone completely crazy. It was as though they both intended to fly right straight into the Junkers. Then when there were no less than a couple of split seconds left before just that would happen, Freddy Farmer's voice sang out in Dave's earphones.  \"Right-o, Dave!\" he shouted. \"This one for us!\"  They both jabbed their trigger button and sixteen Vickers machine guns poured a withering blast of destruction into that Junkers 88. For a few seconds the German raider continued to roar eastward. Then suddenly its port engine belched out a cloud of red flame and oily black smoke. Then as though the craft had hooked its left wing on some invisible wall in the sky, the Junkers staggered to the left and down. Its tail gunner kept up his fire as Dave and Freddy skipped past and zoomed up to dive attack again. But that German might just as well have tried to shoot at a couple of lightning bolts flashing by.  Cutting short their zoom Dave and Freddy rolled their Spitfires over and let them drop by the nose. Down they came again, holding their fire until the last few seconds. The Junkers now was more like a moving cloud of smoke than an airplane flying through the air. And when Dave and Freddy jabbed their trigger buttons again it was the death blow for that German raider. The right wing broke off clean at the stub, and carried the starboard engine along with it. From nose to tail the Junkers became no more than a moving ball of fire. Then suddenly the gas tanks let go. The whole sky was filled with barbs of darting flame and billowing clouds of black smoke. The sky trembled and shook ... and then the Junkers 88 just wasn't there any more. It was a shower of smoking and flaming debris slithering down into the North Sea.  \"Good lad, Dave!\" Freddy sang out. \"Your bursts did it!\"  \"My bursts, nothing!\" Dave called back to him. \"I didn't even come close to the guy. That was your plane, Freddy. Congratulations!\"  \"Rot!\" Freddy snorted into his disc mike, also known as the \"flap\" mike. \"We'll split the beggar and each take half, eh? Oh, oh, Dave! The flight lieutenant's in trouble!\"  It was true. Perhaps there was a better pilot in the other Junkers, or perhaps gunners with a better aim, or it was even possible Flight Lieutenant Barton-Woods had become careless for a moment or so. Anyway, he had not nailed his man, and the Junkers gunners were giving him quite an uncomfortable time as he zoomed up into the clear. Dave and Freddy didn't speak a single word between them. They simply wheeled across the sky in perfect attack formation, and then roared down on the Junkers.  Its rear gunner was no novice, and he had courage. He stuck to his guns and returned their own savage fire. Dave felt his plane quiver slightly, and knew that German bullets were hitting his ship. But he didn't swerve an inch. His wing howled down at the German and he held his fire until the right moment. This time he shouted the signal.  \"Smack it, Freddy!\"  Their guns hammered and yammered out their song, and Dave could clearly see their tracers zinging down into the German plane. No man-made airplane on earth could have withstood that blasting fire from the sixteen guns between the two youths. And that Junkers 88 was no exception to prove the rule. It burst into flame and went careening crazily off on one wing. Then it dropped by the nose, and started howling seaward in a vertical power dive. After it had dropped three or four hundred feet, five black dots popped out from it like peas out of a pod. They instantly became men in Dave's vision, and they slowly turned over and over as they fell down through the air. At the end of almost thirty seconds a puff of white shot up from each man's back. They spread out into parachute envelopes, and five German airmen drifted slowly down toward the surface of the North Sea where British motorboats waited to pull them in as captured prisoners.  Dave and Freddy didn't bother watching the five German airmen float downward. Instead they pulled up out of the dives, closed in on Flight Lieutenant Barton-Woods and took up formation positions. Their leader grinned at them, and they heard his voice coming over the radio.  \"Stout work, you two,\" he said. \"Made an awful mess of it, myself. But you two were along, so I knew everything would be fine. Well, let's toot on back home and report to the O.C.\"     CHAPTER TWO  _Mysterious Orders_   Less than half an hour later, the three pilots of 207 were reporting all details of the patrol to Squadron Leader Trenton, and the R.A.F. Intelligence officer who sat at his side. No matter how trivial a patrol may be, R.A.F. pilots always make a complete report upon their return to the home field. That way the ranking powers are always able to have a complete picture of the war in the air before them. In other words, every single scrap of information about a patrol is important, because you never can tell what it might mean in the whole scheme of things. For that reason the pilots not only made out their reports in writing, but made them by word of mouth, too.  \"Good work, you two,\" the Squadron Leader said, and smiled at Freddy and Dave. \"It's not such an easy job getting a Junkers 88. Those planes have a pretty fair amount of fire power. So getting _two_ of them is a mighty good piece of work. And, oh yes, stay a bit, will you? I want to have a talk with you.\"  A few minutes later Flight Lieutenant Barton-Woods and the Intelligence officer headed off for the mess. As the door closed on them, Squadron Leader Trenton swung around in his chair and gave the two boys a long piercing stare. Then he suddenly clasped his hands on the desk and leaned forward.  \"I say, you two,\" he spoke up, \"have you gotten yourselves into a bit of trouble that might have been reported to the Air Ministry in London?\"  Dave and Freddy looked blankly at each other for a brief moment, then returned their gaze to the squadron leader.  \"Trouble, sir?\" Dave echoed faintly.  \"When, sir?\" Freddy added. \"And where?\"  The squadron commander shrugged and looked completely at sea.  \"I"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/41715"],["title","Dave Dawson with the R.A.F. (#2)"],["body","en't the faintest idea,\" he said. \"I was only asking you. Nothing happened when you two popped up to London for a day's leave last week?\"  \"Why, no, sir,\" Freddy answered promptly for them both. \"We just nosed around and saw a couple of shows, that's all. We were both back here at the squadron by midnight.\"  \"Why?\" Dave put the question. \"Has anything happened, sir?\"  \"I can't say,\" Squadron Leader Trenton murmured, and stared at them with a troubled look in his eyes. \"Just after you took off on this last show, I received a phone call from Air Ministry. You two are ordered to report to Air Vice-Marshal Saunders bright and early tomorrow morning. You'd better go up to London tonight so's you'll be sure and be at Adastral House (R.A.F. name for the Air Ministry) bright and early.\"  \"Air Vice-Marshal Saunders?\" Freddy Farmer repeated in an awed tone. \"But why would he want to see us, sir?\"  Squadron Leader Trenton smiled thinly as he gestured with his two hands on the desk.  \"In this case, I still haven't any idea,\" he said. \"Usually, though, it's for one of two reasons: to give you a very hot going over for breaking some rule and getting into trouble; or else to give you his personal congratulations as he tells you you've been recommended for a medal.\"  \"Well, it surely can't be for either of those reasons,\" Dave said with a frown. \"We certainly haven't bumped into any trouble, and we certainly haven't done anything to rate a medal. And--My gosh! Holy smokes! Do you suppose--?\"  Dave gulped and didn't finish the rest. Squadron Leader Trenton gave him a keen glance.  \"Do I suppose what, Dawson?\" he prompted.  Dave had to swallow again before he could speak. A crazy thought had suddenly flashed through his brain, but just the same it had given him a cold chill.  \"Do you suppose there's some new law?\" he began. \"I mean, could there be some new ruling that might force us to resign our commissions because we're both only seventeen, a year under the regulation age?\"  A look of relief flooded the senior officer's face. He laughed and shook his head.  \"Not even likely!\" he said in firm conviction. \"After the way you two chaps have stood up, it doesn't matter in the slightest how old you are--seventeen or seventy. No, Dawson, I think I can assure you positively that the R.A.F. will never make any new ruling or law that would rid it of you two. No, you can let that worry bail out of your mind, and forget it forever. No, that wasn't the reason for my phone call.\"  \"And you really haven't _any_ idea, sir?\" Freddy asked. \"I mean, could this possibly mean that Dawson and I are being transferred someplace else?\"  \"By gad, I hope not!\" the squadron leader exclaimed sharply, and sat up in his chair. \"No, it couldn't be that, either. I would be informed. The transfer papers would be sent along to me. Besides, I'd raise the roof at any suggestion like that.\"  \"Boy, I wish we were reporting today,\" Dave grunted. \"I know doggone well I won't sleep a wink tonight!\"  \"Which may be the exact truth!\" Squadron Leader Trenton said with a dry smile. \"The Jerries are starting to bomb London at night, now, you know. And by the way, if they do while you two are there, just see to it that you keep out from under, won't you? It cost the R.A.F. a fair penny to make Spitfire pilots out of you. We want a return on the investment, you know.\"  The two boys laughed, but inside they glowed and felt very happy indeed. That was simply Squadron Leader Trenton's way of saying that he valued their aid to 207, and didn't want anything to happen that would rob 207 Squadron of their flying and combat ability.  \"Don't worry, we'll sure watch our step, sir,\" Dave said. Then, with a quick side glance at Freddy: \"I'll see that he doesn't stumble over any bombs. I'll keep hold of his hand all the time.\"  The squadron leader laughed, and Freddy Farmer blushed to the ears.  \"When anybody has to hold my hand, I'll jolly well let you know!\" the young Englishman said scornfully. \"Like as not, it'll be the other way 'round. Don't you think his face is getting a bit pale already, sir?\"  Freddy addressed the last to Squadron Leader Trenton, who laughed again.  \"Can't say for sure, Farmer,\" the O.C. said gravely. \"The light's bad in here, you know. Well, anyway, pop along, you two, and pack a bag. The adjutant will give you railroad vouchers, and your passes. Get back here soon. And no matter what--good luck to both of you.\"  The two youths thanked him, saluted and retreated outside. As they started toward their living quarters, Dave slyly stuck out his foot, and when Freddy tripped over it and started to fall headlong, Dave grabbed him quickly.  \"See?\" Dave chided, as he helped Freddy to keep his balance. \"Just as I thought! You need somebody to hold your hand. Oh, well, I'll be glad to do it, because I like you, little boy. _Hey!_\"  Freddy caused the exclamation, because as he straightened up he stepped hard on Dave's foot, then broke into a sprint for their living quarters. The English youth won by a good three yards. He was inside and hauling out his suitcase as Dave came bursting in. He glanced up with a look of mock concern on his face.  \"Something wrong, Dave?\" he murmured. \"Is a Jerry chasing you?\"  \"Just a pal!\" Dave growled, and limped toward his own bunk. \"I stop the guy from falling down and breaking his neck, and what does he do? He practically cripples me for life. A fine screw-ball I've got for a pal. Say, Freddy?\"  \"Yes?\"  Dave sank down on his bunk with a frown and made no effort to haul out his suitcase.  \"This business at Adastral House tomorrow,\" he grunted. \"Jeepers! I sure hope it isn't bad news. I don't know why, but I've got a funny feeling.\"  Freddy stopped packing and looked up.  \"What kind of a funny feeling?\" he wanted to know.  Dave scratched the back of his neck and sighed.  \"Just a funny feeling, that's all,\" he said. \"I can't put it into words. I've just got a hunch that plenty is going to happen.\"  \"Good, or bad?\" Freddy asked.  Dave shook his head and got off the bunk.  \"Boy, do I wish I knew!\" he breathed. \"Well, we can only wait and hope, I guess. Where do you want to stay in London? Your family's house on Baker Street is closed up, isn't it?\"  \"Yes,\" Freddy said. \"But, if you like, we can open it for the night. There'd be no objections.\"  \"No, let's bunk at a hotel,\" Dave said. \"How about the Savoy? That's close to the Air Ministry.\"  \"So the lad's a blinking millionaire!\" Freddy commented with a chuckle. \"He must stay at the very best of places. Too bad they don't rent room and bath at Buckingham Palace.\"  \"Okay, okay!\" Dave growled. \"Then where do we park?\"  \"Why, at the Savoy, of course,\" Freddy said with a sly grin. \"I fancy our pilot officer's pay can stand it for one night. And that makes me wonder a bit, you know?\"  \"What does?\" Dave asked absently, as he started studying a London timetable. \"What are you wondering about now, my little man?\"  \"I was wondering where we'll be _tomorrow_ night,\" Freddy replied.  \"Somehow I don't even dare guess,\" Dave said. \"And--Hey, get a move on, fellow! There's a train leaving Chelmsford in forty minutes. Let's grab that. It gets us in London just about in time to put on the feed bag. Gee! I wonder if they've got strawberry shortcake at the Savoy. Boy, can I go for that dish!\"  \"Good grief!\" Freddy groaned. Then, in mock gravity: \"Why, certainly, my dear fellow. Anything for a weary R.A.F. pilot, you know. After all, who else is fighting the blinking war?\"  Dave heaved a book at him, but Freddy dodged it neatly, and then the pair set to packing in earnest. As they expected to be away only a day and a night at the most, they didn't put many \"spares\" into their bags. As a matter of fact, though, had the two of them been able to look into the future at that moment, they wouldn't have bothered about packing anything! Clean shirts, spare socks and handkerchiefs, and all that sort of stuff, were items they wouldn't be even thinking about in the hectic days that lay just ahead.  \"Okay, I'm set, are you?\" Dave presently announced, and clicked his bag shut.  \"Right you are,\" Freddy called out, and shut his own bag. \"Off we go!\"  Dave caught up his bag and started for the door. When he reached it, he suddenly paused and turned around.  \"Doggone that hunch!\" he grunted. \"Wonder what it means, anyway?\"     CHAPTER THREE  _Night Raid_   The shrill whistle of the locomotive echoed across the twilight-steeped English countryside. The train lurched and trembled for a moment or so, and then started gliding smoothly along the tracks. Dave and Freddy took a last glance out the compartment window at the Chelmsford station and then settled back comfortably on the cushioned seats. They had the compartment to themselves, and for that they were truly grateful. They were headed for London for half leave and half military reasons, but that didn't mean they weren't tired. The last few weeks had been crowded with more aerial warfare than had taken place in a whole year in World War Number One. The Royal Air Force had almost single-handed held back the Nazis from crossing the Channel. Still outnumbered, but not so much as at Dunkirk, the R.A.F. boys from the squadron leaders right down to the lowest grade mechanics had gained mastery of the air over the Channel and over England. And, what was more important, they had held that mastery regardless of the German fleets of planes Goering had hurled against them.  Stretching out, Dave leaned his head back, and cocked his feet up on the opposite seat.  \"If I could only get Air Vice-Marshal Saunders off my mind,\" he sighed, \"I might catch me a bit of shut-eye. Boy, we've been hitting that old ball lately, you know?\"  \"Hitting what?\" Freddy murmured, and closed his eyes. \"What in the world does that mean?\"  \"Sure, hitting the old ball,\" Dave said lazily. \"Smacking that apple. Hitting on all six. Right on the beam every minute. Catch on?\"  \"Oh, of course!\" Freddy groaned, and gave "]]]
