And when I makes water I makes water.  —By Jove, it is tea, Haines said.  Buck Mulligan went on hewing and wheedling:  —_So I do, Mrs Cahill,_ says she. _Begob, ma’am,_ says Mrs Cahill, _God send you don’t make them in the one pot._  He lunged towards his messmates in turn a thick slice of bread, impaled on his knife.  —That’s folk, he said very earnestly, for your book, Haines. Five lines of text and ten pages of notes about the folk and the fishgods of Dundrum. Printed by the weird sisters in the year of the big wind.  He turned to Stephen and asked in a fine puzzled voice, lifting his brows:  —Can you recall, brother, is mother Grogan’s tea and water pot spoken of in the Mabinogion or is it in the Upanishads?  —I doubt it, said Stephen gravely.  —Do you now? Buck Mulligan said in the same tone. Your reasons, pray?  —I fancy, Stephen said as he ate, it did not exist in or out of the Mabinogion. Mother Grogan was, one imagines, a kinswoman of Mary Ann.  Buck Mulligan’s face smiled with delight.  —Charming! he said in a finical sweet voice, showing his white teeth and blinking his eyes pleasantly. Do you think she was? Quite charming!  Then, suddenly overclouding all his features, he growled in a hoarsened rasping voice as he hewed again vigorously at the loaf:  _—For old Mary Ann  She doesn’t care a damn.  But, hising up her petticoats..._  He crammed his mouth with fry and munched and droned.  The doorway was darkened by an entering form.  —The milk, sir!  —Come in, ma’am, Mulligan said. Kinch, get the jug.  An old woman came forward and stood by Stephen’s elbow.  —That’s a lovely morning, sir, she said. Glory be to God.  —To whom? Mulligan said, glancing at her. Ah, to be sure!  Stephen reached back and took the milkjug from the locker.  —The islanders, Mulligan said to Haines casually, speak frequently of the collector of prepuces.  —How much, sir? asked the old woman.  —A quart, Stephen said.  He watched her pour into the measure and thence into the jug rich white milk, not hers. Old shrunken paps. She poured again a measureful and a tilly. Old and secret she had entered from a morning world, maybe a messenger. She praised the goodness of the milk, pouring it out. Crouching by a patient cow at daybreak in the lush field, a witch on her toadstool, her wrinkled fingers quick at the squirting dugs. They lowed about her whom they knew, dewsilky cattle. Silk of the kine and poor old woman, names given her in old times. A wandering crone, lowly form of an immortal serving her conqueror and her gay betrayer, their common cuckquean, a messenger from the secret morning. To serve or to upbraid, whether he could not tell: but scorned to beg her favour.  —It is indeed, ma’am, Buck Mulligan said, pouring milk into their cups.  —Taste it, sir, she said.  He drank at her bidding.  —If we could live on good food like that, he said to her somewhat loudly, we wouldn’t have the country full of rotten teeth and rotten guts. Living in a bogswamp, eating cheap food and the streets paved with dust, horsedung and consumptives’ spits.  —Are you a medical student, sir? the old woman asked.  —I am, ma’am, Buck Mulligan answered.  —Look at that now, she said.  Stephen listened in scornful silence. She bows her old head to a voice that speaks to her loudly, her bonesetter, her medicineman: me she slights. To the voice that will shrive and oil for the grave all there is of her but her woman’s unclean loins, of man’s flesh made not in God’s likeness, the serpent’s prey. And to the loud voice that now bids her be silent with wondering unsteady eyes.  —Do you understand what he says? Stephen asked her.  —Is it French you are talking, sir? the old woman said to Haines.  Haines spoke to her again a longer speech, confidently.  —Irish, Buck Mulligan said. Is there Gaelic on you?  —I thought it was Irish, she said, by the sound of it. Are you from the west, sir?  —I am an Englishman, Haines answered.  —He’s English, Buck Mulligan said, and he thinks we ought to speak Irish in Ireland.  —Sure we ought to, the old woman said, and I’m ashamed I don’t speak the language myself. I’m told it’s a grand language by them that knows.  —Grand is no name for it, said Buck Mulligan. Wonderful entirely. Fill us out some more tea, Kinch. Would you like a cup, ma’am?  —No, thank you, sir, the old woman said, slipping the ring of the milkcan on her forearm and about to go.  Haines said to her:  —Have you your bill? We had better pay her, Mulligan, hadn’t we?  Stephen filled again the three cups.  —Bill, sir? she said, halting. Well, it’s seven mornings a pint at twopence is seven twos is a shilling and twopence over and these three mornings a quart at fourpence is three quarts is a shilling. That’s a shilling and one and two is two and two, sir.  Buck Mulligan sighed and, having filled his mouth with a crust thickly buttered on both sides, stretched forth his legs and began to search his trouser pockets.  —Pay up and look pleasant, Haines said to him, smiling.  Stephen filled a third cup, a spoonful of tea colouring faintly the thick rich milk. Buck Mulligan brought up a florin, twisted it round in his fingers and cried:  —A miracle!  He passed it along the table towards the old woman, saying:  —Ask nothing more of me, sweet. All I can give you I give.  Stephen laid the coin in her uneager hand.  —We’ll owe twopence, he said.  —Time enough, sir, she said, taking the coin. Time enough. Good morning, sir.  She curtseyed and went out, followed by Buck Mulligan’s tender chant:  _—Heart of my heart, were it more,  More would be laid at your feet._  He turned to Stephen and said:  —Seriously, Dedalus. I’m stony. Hurry out to your school kip and bring us back some money. Today the bards must drink and junket. Ireland expects that every man this day will do his duty.  —That reminds me, Haines said, rising, that I have to visit your national library today.  —Our swim first, Buck Mulligan said.  He turned to Stephen and asked blandly:  —Is this the day for your monthly wash, Kinch?  Then he said to Haines:  —The unclean bard makes a point of washing once a month.  —All Ireland is washed by the gulfstream, Stephen said as he let honey trickle over a slice of the loaf.  Haines from the corner where he was knotting easily a scarf about the loose collar of his tennis shirt spoke:  —I intend to make a collection of your sayings if you will let me.  Speaking to me. They wash and tub and scrub. Agenbite of inwit. Conscience. Yet here’s a spot.  —That one about the cracked lookingglass of a servant being the symbol of Irish art is deuced good.  Buck Mulligan kicked Stephen’s foot under the table and said with warmth of tone:  —Wait till you hear him on Hamlet, Haines.  —Well, I mean it, Haines said, still speaking to Stephen. I was just thinking of it when that poor old creature came in.  —Would I make any money by it? Stephen asked.  Haines laughed and, as he took his soft grey hat from the holdfast of the hammock, said:  —I don’t know, I’m sure.  He strolled out to the doorway. Buck Mulligan bent across to Stephen and said with coarse vigour:  —You put your hoof in it now. What did you say that for?  —Well? Stephen said. The problem is to get money. From whom? From the milkwoman or from him. It’s a toss up, I think.  —I blow him out about you, Buck Mulligan said, and then you come along with your lousy leer and your gloomy jesuit jibes.  —I see little hope, Stephen said, from her or from him.  Buck Mulligan sighed tragically and laid his hand on Stephen’s arm.  —From me, Kinch, he said.  In a suddenly changed tone he added:  —To tell you the God’s truth I think you’re right. Damn all else they are good for. Why don’t you play them as I do? To hell with them all. Let us get out of the kip.  He stood up, gravely ungirdled and disrobed himself of his gown, saying resignedly:  —Mulligan is stripped of his garments.  He emptied his pockets on to the table.  —There’s your snotrag, he said.  And putting on his stiff collar and rebellious tie he spoke to them, chiding them, and to his dangling watchchain. His hands plunged and rummaged in his trunk while he called for a clean handkerchief. God, we’ll simply have to dress the character. I want puce gloves and green boots. Contradiction. Do I contradict myself? Very well then, I contradict myself. Mercurial Malachi. A limp black missile flew out of his talking hands.  —And there’s your Latin quarter hat, he said.  Stephen picked it up and put it on. Haines called to them from the doorway:  —Are you coming, you fellows?  —I’m ready, Buck Mulligan answered, going towards the door. Come out, Kinch. You have eaten all we left, I suppose. Resigned he passed out with grave words and gait, saying, wellnigh with sorrow:  —And going forth he met Butterly.  Stephen, taking his ashplant from its leaningplace, followed them out and, as they went down the ladder, pulled to the slow iron door and locked it. He put the huge key in his inner pocket.  At the foot of the ladder Buck Mulligan asked:  —Did you bring the key?  —I have it, Stephen said, preceding them.  He walked on. Behind him he heard Buck Mulligan club with his heavy bathtowel the leader shoots of ferns or grasses.  —Down, sir! How dare you, sir!  Haines asked:  —Do you pay rent for this tower?  —Twelve quid, Buck Mulligan said.  —To the secretary of state for war, Stephen added over his shoulder.  They halted while Haines surveyed the tower and said at last:  —Rather bleak in wintertime, I should say. Martello you call it?  —Billy Pitt had them built, Buck Mulligan said, when the French were on the sea. But ours is the _omphalos_.  —What is your idea of Hamlet? Haines asked Stephen.  —No, no, Buck Mulligan shouted in pain. I’m not equal to Thomas Aquinas and the fiftyfive reasons he has made out to prop it up. Wait till I have a few pints in me first.  He turned to Stephen, saying, as he pulled down neatly the peaks of his "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/43008"],["title","Around the Yule Log (#1)"],["body","library shelves. When he looked back at the picture in the book, he started and rubbed his eyes. He thought--but it could not have been possible--that the central figure on the page moved slightly; and he was positive that one of the Ghost’s arms, in the engraving, had been raised, while now both were at his side.  Mr. Broadstreet turned back the leaf with some misgiving, and looked carefully behind it. Nothing but blank white paper.  “H’m,” muttered Mr. Broadstreet to himself, “how a man’s fancy does play strange tricks with--Halloo!”  He was once more glancing at the picture, when the jolly Ghost gave him an unmistakable wink.  To say that the lawyer started, was astonished, struck dumb--would be mild. He sat staring at the page, not wholly believing his own eyes, and yet not liking to look upon such a--to say the least--peculiar picture.  While he was in this bewildered state of mind a rich, jovial voice was heard, apparently at a great distance, and at the same time proceeding directly from the book he held in his hand; and--yes, no doubt about it--the Ghost’s bearded lips were moving.  “Well?” said the Ghost of Christmas Present, still seeming very, very far off.  “Well, sir?” stammered Mr. Broadstreet, in return.  “You see I’m not dead yet, although some of your good people on this side of the water pay precious little attention to me.”  “Why, really,” said Mr. Broadstreet, instinctively arguing the opposite side of the question, “as to that, I’m not so sure. Take Christmas cards, now. A few years ago they were unknown; now they’re as common as valentines.”  “Oh, yes,” replied the Ghost, “I know. You see I have my room pretty well decorated with them.”  The lawyer scrutinized the background of the picture more carefully, and, sure enough, the walls were covered with what at first seemed a rich sort of illuminated paper, but proved to be composed entirely of Christmas cards, many of which he had never seen. Even in the momentary glance he gave, he observed that those which had taken prizes and had been most largely advertised during the past few winters, were tucked away in obscure corners, while several which were exceedingly simple in design and text occupied the most prominent positions.  “Yes,” the Ghost went on, “the cards are well enough in their way, and so are the other displays and festivities of the day. But it is the spirit of Christmas that you need. Charity, charity in its good old sense: open hearts and kind deeds, with less thought of self-pleasing. While these dainty little gifts are being manufactured, purchased, sent, and thrown away, hundreds of people are at starvation’s door in your own city; thousands of people know little or nothing of the real meaning of the day, or of its Founder.”  As the Ghost spoke, its voice seemed to come nearer, and at the same time the book grew so large and heavy that Mr. Broadstreet was fain to set it down upon the carpet. He no longer feared the Ghost, nor did it seem strange that it should converse with him in this manner.  “Wherein are we deficient?” he asked eagerly. “Or what more can we do? The charitable institutions of Boston are among the best in the world, the sky is full of her church-steeples, her police and missionary forces are vigilant and effective in their work.”  The Ghost of Christmas Present gave a toss to his long hair and beard.  “How much have you done to carry the spirit of Christmastide beyond your own threshold? Who in this great city will cherish the day and love it more dearly for your warm human friendship and kindly act, until it symbolizes to them whatever is purest and merriest and holiest in life?”  The Ghost’s voice, now grown very near, was rather sad than stern, and its eyes were fixed intently upon Mr. Broadstreet’s face.  Mr. Broadstreet hesitated. With cross-examination he was familiar enough, but he did not relish the part of witness. So confused was he that he hardly noticed that book and picture were now so large that they quite filled the end of the room in which he was sitting, and seemed like another apartment opening out of his own.  “I--I--hardly know,” he stammered. “Really, I’ve spent a good deal of money; my Christmas bills are always tremendous, but I suppose it’s mostly in the family.”  “Mind,” interrupted the Ghost, almost sharply, “I don’t say anything against the good cheer and merriment at home. But there are many homes within a stone’s throw of your chair, where there will be no fine dinner, no presents, no meeting of friends, no tree,--nothing but anxiety and doubt and despair. Your dressing-gown would provide for several of them.”  Mr. Broadstreet looked meekly at the embroidery upon his sleeves.  “What would you have me do?” he asked.  “Do you desire to perform your part toward making the morrow bright for some one who otherwise would find it all clouds? Do you wish to plant seeds of love and mercy and tenderness in some heart that has heretofore borne only thistles? To bring a smile to some weary face, warmth to shivering limbs, light and hope to dreary lives?”  “I do! I do!” exclaimed the rich man, eagerly starting up from his chair.  “And are you ready to sacrifice your ease and comfort, this stormy night, for such as they?”  Mr. Broadstreet seized his fur cap and ulster from the rack in the hall. “Try me!” he cried. “I’m ready for anything!”  The Ghost smiled pleasantly upon him, at the same time seeming to lift its hand involuntarily, as in blessing. Then it spoke for the last time.  “Hitherto you have known only the bright side of Christmas,” it said gently. “It has been full of joy to you and yours. But there are those among your fellow creatures, nay, among your very neighbors, who dwell in such continued misery that when Christmas comes it but reminds them of their unhappy state, and by its excess of light upon others deepens the gloom about themselves. This is the Shadow of Christmas Present, and it falls heavily upon many a heart and many a household, where the day, with its good cheer and blessed associations, should bring naught but delight.” The kind Spirit’s voice wavered slightly. “I, myself, can do but little to dispel this shadow. It grieves me sorely, year by year, but it remains, and I fear I sometimes but make it worse, with my bluff ways and keen winter breezes. It is for those who love me most to carry such light and comfort to those upon whom it rests, that it shall be banished never to return. The shadow grows less year by year, but it is still broad, broad.”  The Ghost was silent a moment. It beckoned to the other, and motioned to him to step behind it. “In my Shadow you shall move to-night,” it concluded, in a firmer voice. “It shall accompany you wherever you go, and your work shall be to turn it away, with whatever kind deeds your hand shall find to do, or cheering words you may have the power to speak.”  It said no more. Mr. Broadstreet, who, when a child, had often longed to peep behind a picture, found himself actually fulfilling his wish. As he drew nearer the printed page, he heard a dull roar, like surf beating upon a rocky coast. He advanced further, picking his way around the pile of poultry and vegetables and glistening holly upon which the Ghost sat enthroned. A moment more and the room vanished in utter blackness of night, the roar grew grander and deeper, until it throbbed in his ears like the diapason of a mighty organ, a fierce blast of snow-laden wind struck his bewildered face, the street-lamp upon the corner flickered feebly in a mist of flakes--he was standing before his own door, knee-deep in a snow-drift, and buffeted above, below, and on every side by the storm that was abroad that Christmas Eve.   II  As soon as Mr. Broadstreet recovered himself and cleared his eyes from the blinding snow, he saw a heavy, black Shadow on the sidewalk enveloping his own person and resting upon the figure of a man who had evidently just sheltered himself behind the high stone steps, for his footprints leading from the street were still quite fresh. As the man thrashed his arms and stamped vigorously, to start the blood through his benumbed feet, a bright button or two gleamed upon his breast through the cape of his greatcoat. Mr. Broadstreet now recognized him as the policeman whose beat it was, and whom he had occasionally favored with a condescending nod, as he came home late at night from the theater or the club. He had never addressed him by so much as a word, but now the Shadow was full upon him, and Mr. Broadstreet felt that here was his first opportunity.  “Good-evening, officer!” he shouted cheerily, through the storm. “Wish you a Merry Christmas to-morrow.”  “Thank you, sir; same to you,” replied the other, with a touch of the cap and a pleased glance at the great man. “Hard times for the boys to-night, though.”  “It _is_ hard,” said Mr. Broadstreet compassionately. “And you’re rather cold, I suppose?” he added awkwardly, after a pause.  “Rather!”  “Why, bless me,” a bright thought striking him, “wouldn’t you like a cup of hot coffee, now?”  The officer looked up again, surprised. “I would that, sir, first-rate,” he answered heartily.  Mr. Broadstreet stepped to the side door and pressed the electric knob.  “Bring out a good cup of coffee for this man,” he said to the girl who answered the bell. “And, officer, buy the folks at home a trifle for me; Christmas, you know.” As he spoke, he put a big silver dollar into the astonished policeman’s hand, and at the same time the Shadow vanished, leaving the light from the bright, warm hall falling fairly upon the snow-covered cap and buttons.  A muffled roll and jingling of bells made themselves heard above the wind, and a street-car came laboring down the street through the heavy drifts. Mr. Broadstreet, without a thought as to the destination of the car, but impelled by some unseen force, clambered upon the rear platform. The conductor was standing like a snowman, covered with white from head to foot, collar "]]]
