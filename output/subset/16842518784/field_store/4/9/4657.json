I didn't get a good look at it, for Father Barnum shrieked when he saw it, then snatched it as if it were afire. He carried it down to the river with the tongs.\"  \"H'm! Now that I think of it,\" said the old man, \"Shakespeare grinned when he gave it to me. You see, Poleon ain't much better on the read than I am, so we never noticed what kind of a book it was.\"  \"When will Poleon get back, do you suppose?\"  \"Most any day now, unless the Dawson dance-halls are too much for him. It won't take him long to sell our skins if what I hear is true.\"  \"What is that?\"  \"About these Cheechakos. They say there are thousands of tenderfeet up there, and more coming in every day.\"  \"Oh! If I had only been here in time to go with him!\" breathed the girl. \"I never saw a city. It must be just like Seattle, or New York.\"  Gale shook his head. \"No. There's considerable difference. Some time I'll take you out to the States, and let you see the world--maybe.\" He uttered the last word in an undertone, as if in self-debate, but the girl was too excited to notice.  \"You will take mother, too, and the kiddies, won't you?\"  \"Of course!\"  \"Oh! I--I--\" The attempt to express what this prospect meant to her was beyond her girlish rapture, but her parted lips and shining eyes told the story to Gale. \"And Poleon must go, too. We can't go anywhere without him.\" The old man smiled down upon her in reassurance. \"I wonder what he'll say when he finds the soldiers have come. I wonder if he'll like it.\"  Gale turned his eyes down-stream to the barracks, and noted that the long flag-staff had at last been erected. Even as he looked he saw a bundle mounting towards its tip, and then beheld the Stars and Stripes flutter out in the air, while the men below cheered noisily. It was some time before he answered.  \"Poleon Doret is like the rest of us men up here in the North. We have taken care of ourselves so far, and I guess we're able to keep it up without the help of a smooth-faced Yankee kid for guardian.\"  \"Lieutenant Burrell isn't a Yankee,\" said Necia. \"He is a blue-grass man. He comes from Kentucky.\"  Her father grunted contemptuously. \"I might have known it. Those rebels are a cultus, lazy lot. A regular male man with any ginger in him would shed his coat and go to work, instead of wearing his clothes buttoned up all day. It don't take much 'savvy' to run a handful of thirteen-dollar-a-month soldiers.\" Necia stirred a bit restlessly, and the trader continued: \"It ain't man's work, it's--loafing. If he tries to boss us he'll get QUITE a surprise.\"  \"He won't try to boss you. He has been sent here to build a military post, and to protect the miners in their own self-government. He won't take any part in their affairs as long as they are conducted peaceably.\"  Being at a loss for an answer to this unexpected defence, the old man grunted again, with added contempt, while his daughter continued:  \"This rush to the upper country has brought in all sorts of people, good, bad--and worse; and the soldiers have been sent to prevent trouble, and to hold things steady till the law can be established. The Canadian Mounted Police are sending all their worst characters down-river, and our soldiers have been scattered among the American camps for our protection. I think it's fine.\"  \"Where did you learn all this?\"  \"Lieutenant Burrell told me,\" she replied; at which her father regarded her keenly. She could not see the curious look in his eyes, nor did she turn when, a moment later, he resumed, in an altered tone:  \"I reckon Poleon will bring you something pretty from Dawson, eh?\"  \"He has never failed to bring me presents, no matter where he came from. Dear old Poleon!\" She smiled tenderly. \"Do you remember that first day when he drifted, singing, into sight around the bend up yonder? He had paddled his birch-bark from the Chandelar without a thing to eat; hunger and hardship only made him the happier, and the closer he drew his belt the louder he sang.\"  \"He was bound for his 'New Country'!\"  \"Yes. He didn't know where it lay, but the fret for travel was on him, and so he drifted and sang, as he had drifted and sung from the foot of Lake Le Barge.\"  \"That was four years ago,\" mused Gale, \"and he never found his 'New Country,' did he?\"  \"No. We tied him down and choked it out of him,\" Necia laughed. \"Dear, funny old Poleon--he loves me like a brother.\"  The man opened his lips, then closed them, as if on second thought, and rose to his feet, for, coming towards them up the trail from the barracks, he beheld a trim, blue-coated figure. He peered at the approaching officer a moment, set his jaw more firmly, and disappeared into the store.  \"Well, we have raised our flag-staff,\" said the Lieutenant as he took a seat below Necia. \"It's like getting settled to keep house.\"  \"Are you lazy?\" inquired the girl.  \"I dare say I am,\" he admitted. \"I've never had time to find out. Why?\"  \"Are you going to boss our people around?\" she continued, bent on her own investigation.  \"No. Not as long as they behave. In fact, I hardly know what I am to do. Maybe you can tell me.\" His smile was peculiarly frank and winning. \"You see, it's my first command, and my instructions, although comprehensive, are rather vague. I am supposed to see that mining rights are observed, to take any criminals who kindly offer themselves up to be arrested, and to sort of handle things that are too tough for the miners themselves.\"  \"Why, you are a policeman!\" said Necia, at which he made a wry face.  \"The Department, in its wisdom, would have me, a tenderfoot, adjust those things that are too knotty for these men who have spent their lives along the frontier.\"  \"I don't believe you will be very popular with our people,\" Necia announced, meditatively.  \"No. I can see that already. I wasn't met with any brass-bands, and I haven't received any engraved silver from the admiring citizens of Flambeau. That leaves nothing but the women to like me, and, as you are the only one in camp, you will have to like me very much to make up for its shortcomings.\"  She approved of his unusual drawl; it gave him a kind of deliberation which every move of his long, lithe body belied and every glance of his eyes contradicted. Moreover, she liked his youth, so clean and fresh and strange in this land where old men are many and the young ones old with hardship and grave with the silence of the hills. Her life had been spent entirely among men who were her seniors, and, although she had ruled them like a spoiled queen, she knew as little of their sex as they did of hers. Unconsciously the strong young life within her had clamored for companionship, and it was this that had drawn her to Poleon Doret--who would ever remain a boy--and it was this that drew her to the young Kentuckian; this, and something else in him, that the others lacked.  \"Now that I think it over,\" he continued, \"I'd rather have you like me than have the men do so.\"  \"Of course,\" she nodded. \"They do anything I want them to--all but father, and--\"  \"It isn't that,\" he interrupted, quickly. \"It is because you ARE the only woman of the place, because you are such a surprise. To think that in the heart of this desolation I should find a girl like--like you, like the girls I know at home.\"  \"Am I like other girls?\" she inquired, eagerly. \"I have often wondered.\"  \"You are, and you are not. You are surprisingly conventional for these surroundings, and yet unconventionally surprising--for any place. Who are you? Where did you come from? How did you get here?\"  \"I am just what you see. I came from the States, and I was carried. That is all I can remember.\"  \"Then you haven't lived here always?\"  \"Oh, dear, no! We came here while I was very little, but of late I have been away at school.\"  \"Some seminary, eh?\"  At this she laughed aloud. \"Hardly that, either. I've been at the Mission. Father Barnum has been teaching me for five years. I came up-river a day ahead of you.\"  She asked no questions of him in return, for she had already learned all there was to know the day before from a grizzled corporal in whom was the hunger to talk. She had learned of a family of Burrells whose name was known throughout the South, and that Meade Burrell came from the Frankfort branch, the branch that had raised the soldiers. His father had fought with Lee, and an uncle was now in the service at Washington. On the mother's side the strain was equally militant, but the Meades had sought the sea. The old soldier had told her much more, of which she understood little; told her of the young man's sister, who had come all the way from Kentucky to see her brother off when he sailed from San Francisco; told her of the Lieutenant's many friends in Washington, and of his family name and honor. Meade Burrell was undoubtedly a fine young fellow in his corporal's eyes, and destined to reach great heights, as the other Burrells had before him. The old soldier, furthermore, had looked at her keenly and added that the Burrells were known as \"divils among the weemen.\"  Resting thus on the steps of Old Man Gale's store, the two talked on till they were disturbed by the sound of shrill voices approaching, at which the man looked up. Coming down the trail from the town was a squaw and two children. At sight of Necia the little ones shouted gleefully and scampered forward, climbing over her like half-grown puppies. They were boy and girl, both brown as Siwashes, with eyes like jet beads and hair that was straight and coarse and black. At a glance Burrell knew them for \"breeds,\" and evidently the darker half was closer to the surface now, for they choked, gurgled, stuttered, and coughed in their Indian tongue, while Necia answered them likewise. At a word from her they turned and saw him, then, abashed at the strange splendor of his "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4082"],["title","The Barrier (#2)"],["body","uniform, fell silent, pressing close to her. The squaw, also, seemed to resent his presence, for, after a lowering glance, she drew the shawl closer about her head, and, leaving the trail, slunk out of sight around the corner of the store.  Burrell looked up at his companion's clear-cut, delicate face, at the wind-tanned cheeks, against which her long braids lay like the blue-black locks of an Egyptian maid, then at her warm, dark eyes, in which was a hint of the golden light of the afternoon sun. He noted covertly the slender lines of her body and the dainty, firm, brown hands flung protectingly about the shoulders of her little friends, who were peering at him owlishly from their shelter.  The bitter revolt that had burned in him at the prospect of a long exile in this undiscovered spot died out suddenly. What a picture she made! How fresh and flower-like she looked, and yet the wisdom of her! He spoke impulsively:  \"I am glad you are here, Miss Necia. I was glad the moment I saw you, and I have been growing gladder ever since, for I never imagined there would be anybody in this place but men and squaws--men who hate the law and squaws who slink about--like that.\" He nodded in the direction of the Indian woman's disappearance. \"Either that, or, at best, a few 'breeds' like these little fellows.\"  She looked at him quickly.  \"Well! What difference would that make?\"  \"Ugh! Squaws and half-breeds!\" His tone conveyed in full his utter contempt.  The tiny hands of the boy and girl slid into her own as she arose. A curiously startled look lay in her eyes, and an inquiring, plaintive wrinkle came between her brows.  \"I don't believe you understand,\" she said. \"Lieutenant Burrell, this is my sister, Molly Gale, and this is my little brother John.\" Both round-eyed elfs made a ducking courtesy and blinked at the soldier, who gained his feet awkwardly, a flush rising into his cheeks.  From the regions at the rear of the store came the voice of an Indian woman calling:  \"Necia! Necia!\"  \"Coming in a moment!\" the girl called back; then, turning to the young officer, she added, quietly: \"Mother needs me now. Good-bye!\"     CHAPTER II  POLEON DORET'S HAND IS QUICKER THAN HIS TONGUE   The trader's house sat back of the post, farther up on the hill. It was a large, sleepy house, sprawling against the sunny side of the slope, as if it had sought the southern exposure for warmth, and had dozed off one sultry afternoon and never waked up from its slumber. It was of great, square-hewn timbers, built in the Russian style, the under side of each log hollowed to fit snugly over its fellow underneath, upon which dried moss had previously been spread, till in effect the foot-thick walls were tongued and grooved and, through years of seasoning, become so tinder dry that no frosts or heats could penetrate them. Many architects had worked on it as it grew, room by room, through the years, and every man had left behind the mark of his individuality, from Pretty Charlie the pilot, who swung an axe better than any Indian on the river, to Larsen the ship's carpenter, who worked with an adze and who starved the summer following on the Koyukuk. It had stretched a bit year by year, for the trader's family had been big in the early days when hunters and miners of both breeds came in to trade, to loaf, and to swap stories with him. Through the winter days, when the caribou were in the North and the moose were scarce, whole families of natives came and camped there, for Alluna, his squaw, drew to her own blood, and they felt it their due to eat of the bounty of him who ruled them like an overlord; but when the first goose honked they slipped away until, by the time the salmon showed, the house was empty again and silent, save for Alluna and the youngsters. In return these people brought him many skins and much fresh meat, for which he paid no price, and, with the fall, his cache was filled with fish of which the bulk were dried king salmon as long as a grown man's leg and worth a dollar apiece to any traveller.  There are men whose wits are quick as light, and whose muscles have been so tempered and hardened by years of exercise that they are like those of a wild animal. Of such was John Gale; but with all his intelligence he was very slow at reading, hence he chose to spend his evenings with his pipe and his thoughts, rather than with a book, as lonesome men are supposed to do. He did with little sleep, and many nights he sat alone till Alluna and Necia would be awakened by his heavy step as he went to his bed. That he was a man who could really think, and that his thoughts were engrossing, no one doubted who saw him sitting enthralled at such a time, for he neither rocked, nor talked, nor moved a muscle hour after hour, and only his eyes were alive. To-night the spell was on him again, and he sat bulked up in his chair, rocklike and immovable.  From the open door of the next room he could hear Necia and the little ones. She had made them ready for bed, and was telling them the tale of the snow-bird's spot.  \"So when all the other birds had failed,\" he heard her say, \"the little snowbird asked for a chance to try. He flew and flew, and just before he came to the edge of the world where the two Old Women lived he pulled out all of his feathers. When he came to them he said:\"  \"'I am very cold. May I warm myself at your fire?'\"  \"They saw how little and naked he was, and how he shivered, so they did not throw sticks at him, but allowed him to creep close. He watched his chance, and when they were not looking he picked up a red-hot coal in his beak and flew back home with it as fast as ever he could--and that is how fire came to the Indian people.\"  \"Of course the coal was hot, and it burned his throat till a drop of blood came through, so ever since that day the snowbird has had a red spot on his throat.\"  The two children spoke out in their mother's tongue, clamoring for the story of the Good Beaver who saved the hunter's life, and she began, this time in the language of the Yukon people, while Gale listened to the low music of her voice, muffled and broken by the log partition.  His squaw came in, her arrival unannounced except by the scuff of her moccasins, and seated herself against the wall. She did not use a chair, of which there were several, but crouched upon a bear-skin, her knees beneath her chin, her toes a trifle drawn together. She sat thus for a long time, while Necia continued her stories and put the little ones to bed. Soon the girl came to say good-night.  John Gale had never kissed his daughter, and, as it was not a custom of her mother's race, she never missed the caresses. On rare occasions the old man romped with the little ones and took them in his arms and acted as other fathers act, but he had never done these things with her. When she had gone he spoke without moving.  \"She'll never marry Poleon Doret.\"  \"Why?\" inquired Alluna.  \"He ain't her kind.\"  \"Poleon is a good man.\"  \"None better. But she'll marry some--some white man.\"  \"Poleon is white,\" the squaw declared.  \"He is and he ain't. I mean she'll marry an 'outside' man. He ain't good enough, and--well, he ain't her kind.\" Alluna's grunt of indignation was a sufficient answer to this, but he resumed, jerking his head in the direction of the barracks. \"She's been talking a lot with this--this soldier.\"  \"Him good man, too, I guess,\" said the wife.  \"The hell he is!\" cried the trader, fiercely. \"He don't mean any good to her.\"  \"Him got a woman, eh?\" said the other.  \"No, no! I reckon he's single all right, but you don't understand. He's different from us people. He's--he's--\" Gale paused, at a loss for words to convey his meaning. \"Well, he ain't the kind that would marry a half-breed.\"  Alluna pondered this cryptic remark unsuccessfully, and was still seeking its solution when her lord continued:  \"If she really got to loving him it would be bad for all of us.\"  Evidently Alluna read some hidden meaning back of these words, for she spoke quickly, but in her own tongue now, as she was accustomed to do when excited or alarmed.  \"Then this thing must cease at once. The risk is too great. Better that you kill him before it is too late.\"'  \"Hardly that,\" said the trader.  \"Think of the little ones and of me,\" the squaw insisted, and, encouraged by his silence, continued: \"Why not? Soon the nights will grow dark. The river runs swiftly, and it never gives up its dead. I can do it if you dare not. No one would suspect me.\"  Gale rose and laid his big hand firmly on her shoulder.  \"Don't talk like that. There has been too much blood let already. We'll allow things to run along a bit as they are. There's time enough to worry.\"  He rose, but instead of going to his room he strode out of the house and walked northward up the trail, passing through the town and out of sight. Alluna sat huddled up in the doorway, her shawl drawn close about her head, and waited for him until the late sun--which at this time of year revolves in a great circle overhead--dipped down below the distant mountains for the midnight hour, then rolled slanting out again a few points farther north, to begin its long journey anew; but he did not return. At last she crept stiffly in-doors, like an old and weary woman, the look of fright still staring in her eyes.  About nine o'clock the next morning a faint and long-drawn cry came from the farthest limits of the little camp. An instant later it was echoed closer, and then a dog began to howl. Before its voice had died away another took it up sadly, and within three breaths, from tip and down the half-mile of scanty water-front, came the cry of \"Steam-bo-o-a-t!\" Cabin doors opened and men came out, glanced up the stream and echoed the call, while from sleepy nooks and sun-warmed roofs wolf-dogs arose, yawning and stretching. Those who had slept late dressed as they hurried towards the landing-place, joining in the plaint, till men and malamutes united in the"]]]
