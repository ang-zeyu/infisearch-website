Baker, A. Byron Leonard, R. C. Moore, Robert W. Wilson, and H. B. Tordoff, and many of my fellow students. Mr. Victor Hogg gave helpful suggestions on the preparation of the illustrations. My wife, Muriel Findley, devoted many hours to secretarial work and typing of manuscript. Finally I am grateful to Professor E. Raymond Hall for guidance in the study and for assistance in preparing the manuscript. During the course of the study I received support from the University of Kansas Endowment Association, from the Office of Naval Research, and from the National Science Foundation.     NON-GEOGRAPHIC VARIATION   Non-geographic variation, that is to say, variation within a single population of shrews, consists of variation owing to age and normal individual variation. In _Sorex_ I have detected no significant secondary sexual differences between males and females; accordingly the two sexes are here considered together.  Variation with age must be considered in order to assemble comparable samples of these shrews. Increased age results in wear on all teeth and in particularly striking changes in the size and shape of the first incisors. Skulls of older shrews develop sagittal and lambdoidal ridges, and further differ from skulls of young animals in being slightly broader and shorter, and in developing thicker bone, particularly on the rostrum which thus seems to be, but is not always in fact, more robust. Pruitt has recently (1954) noted these same cranial differences in specimens of _Sorex cinereus_ of different ages.  Several students of American shrews, notably Pearson (1945) on _Blarina_, Hamilton (1940) on _Sorex fumeus_, and Conaway (1952) on _Sorex palustris_, have shown that young are born in spring and summer, usually reach sexual maturity the following spring, and rarely survive through, or even to, a second winter. The result is that collections made, as most of them are, in spring and summer, contain two age classes, first year and second year animals. These two age classes are readily separable on the basis of differences in the skull as well as on the decreased pubescence of the tail and the increased weight of second year animals. My own examination of hundreds of museum specimens confirms this for the _Sorex vagrans_ group. Separation of the two age classes in an August-taken series of _Sorex vagrans_ from coastal Washington is shown in figure 3, in which two tooth-measurements that are dependent upon wear are plotted against one another.  First year animals are more abundant in collections than are second year animals. Within the first year, that is to say from spring to late fall, animals vary but little. Dental characters are best studied in first year shews. For this reason I have used them as the basis for the study of geographic variation, and descriptions are based on first year animals unless otherwise noted.     CHARACTERS OF TAXONOMIC WORTH   Within the _Sorex vagrans_ complex, the only characters of taxonomic significance that I have detected are in size and color. It is true that cranial proportions, such as relative size of rostrum, may change from population to population, but these proportions seem to me to be dependent upon actual size of the individual shrew as I shall elsewhere point out. Of the cranial measurements here employed, palatal length and least interorbital breadth are the most significant and useful. Color in the _S. vagrans_ group seems to be in Orange and Cadmium Yellow, colors 15 and 17 of Ridgway (1912). No specimens actually possess these pure colors, but most colors in these shrews are seen to be derived from the two mentioned by admixture of black and/or neutral gray. In color designations an increase in neutral gray is indicated by an increased number of prime signs (´), whereas increase in black is indicated by progressive characters of the Roman alphabet (_i_, _k_, _m_). Thus, 17´´_k_ is grayer than 17´_k_ and 17´´_m_ is blacker than 17´´_k_. In subspecific diagnoses in this report, color and size, and sometimes relative size, are the characters usually mentioned.     [Illustration: FIG. 3.

First year       and second year individuals of _Sorex vagrans vagrans_, all       taken in August at Willapa Bay, Washington, are completely       separated. Open circles represent teeth of second year shrews;       solid circles represent teeth of first year shrews.]     PELAGE CHANGE   In general, winter pelage is darker than summer pelage in these shrews. Winter pelage comes in first on the rump and spreads caudad and ventrad. The growth line of incoming hair is easily detected on the fur side of the skin. Throughout the winter the color of the pelage changes, often becoming somewhat browner, although no actual molt takes place. This was noted by Dalquest (1944) who assumed that the color change resulted from molt although he was unable to detect actual replacement of hairs. Summer pelage usually comes in first on the back or head and moves posteriorly and laterally. Time of molt depends on latitude and altitude. Summer pelage may appear fairly late in the season and may account for the anomalous midsummer molt noted by Dalquest. Fresh pelages of summer and winter are best seen in first year animals and are less variable than are worn pelages and hence are used as the basis of color descriptions.     GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION AND VARIATION   Pacific Coastal Section  The largest shrews of the _vagrans_ group (large in all dimensions) occur in the coastal forests of northern California and of Oregon. Those shrews are reddish, large-skulled, large-toothed, and have rostra that are large in proportion to the size of the skull as a whole. The very largest of these shrews live along the coast of northwestern California. To the southward they are somewhat smaller, and at successively more northern localities, to as far as southwestern British Columbia, they are likewise progressively smaller and also somewhat less reddish. The relative size of the rostrum decreases with the decrease in size of the skull; consequently smaller shrews have relatively smaller rostra (see fig. 4). In addition the zygomatic ridge of the squamosal decreases in relative size with decrease in actual size of the skull. Thus, these features change in a clinal fashion as one proceeds from, say, Humboldt County, California, northward to Astoria, Oregon.  Turning our attention now farther inland to the Cascade Mountains of northern Oregon, the shrews there also are smaller and less reddish (more brownish) than in northwestern California, and the trend to smaller and darker shrews culminates in the northern Cascades of Washington. Shrews from there, and from the southwestern coast of British Columbia, compared with those from northwestern California, are much smaller and have so great a suffusion of black that they appear brown rather than red. At places along the coast successively farther north of southwestern British Columbia the shrews become larger again, the largest individuals being those from near Wrangell, Alaska. From that place northwesterly along the coast of Alaska, size decreases again.     [Illustration: FIG. 4. Condylobasal length (in millimeters)       plotted against palatal index (palatal length/condylobasal       length × 100) in several subspecies of _Sorex vagrans_ to show       relative increase in size of rostrum with actual increase in       size of skull.]  The shrews so far discussed inhabit forests in a region of high rainfall and a minimum of seasonal fluctuation in temperature. Such a habitat seems to be the optimum for shrews of the _vagrans_ group since the largest individuals are found there. In addition, shrews seem to be as common, or commoner, in this coastal belt, than they are in other places.  The large shrews of the _vagrans_ group on the Pacific coast were divided into three species by H. H. T. Jackson in his revision of the North American _Sorex_ in 1928. The large reddish shrews of the coast of California and southern Oregon were called _S. pacificus_. The somewhat smaller ones from the coast of central Oregon were called _S. yaquinae_. Still smaller shrews from northwestern Oregon and from the rest of the Pacific coast north into Alaska were called _S. obscurus_. I find these kinds to intergrade continuously one with the next in the manner described and conclude that all are of a single species.   Inland Montane Section  Inland from the coasts of British Columbia and Alaska the size of the _vagrans_ shrew decreases rapidly. Specimens from western Alaska, central Alaska, and the interior of British Columbia are uniformly smaller than coastal specimens. In addition the red of the hair is masked more by neutral gray than by black with the result that the pelage is grayish rather than brownish or reddish. Shrews of this general appearance are found southward through the Rocky Mountain chain to Colorado and New Mexico. On the more or less isolated mountain ranges of Montana east of the continental divide the _vagrans_ shrew is somewhat smaller still. On the Sacramento Mountains of southeastern New Mexico the shrew is somewhat larger and slightly darker. Southwestward from the Colorado Rockies this shrew becomes smaller and slightly more reddish (less grayish).  All of these montane populations of the _vagrans_ shrew are commonest in hydrosere communities, that is to say, streamsides and marshy areas where the predominant vegetation is grass, sedges, willows, and alders. Since these animals are less common within the montane forests, hydrosere communities, rather than the actual forest, seem to be the positive feature important for the shrews.  The shrews of the montane region just described were regarded by Jackson as belonging to two species: _Sorex obscurus_, occupying all the Rocky Mountains"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/38356"],["title","Speciation of the Wandering Shrew (#2)"],["body"," to, and including, the Sacramento Mountains; _S. vagrans_, made up of small individuals from various places in Wyoming, Montana, and Colorado, and all the shrews of western New Mexico and all of Arizona. My study of these animals has led me to conclude that the smaller shrews of Arizona and New Mexico intergrade in a clinal fashion with the shrews of Colorado and in fact represent but one species. Since some individuals from Colorado are as small as larger individuals from this southwestern population of small animals, I conclude that such specimens are the basis for reports of _S. vagrans_ from Colorado. The shrews of the Sacramento Mountains resemble those of the Colorado Rockies more than they do the smaller shrews of western New Mexico and Arizona, possibly because the climate is similar in the Sacramento Mountains and the higher Colorado Rockies. There is less precipitation in the more western mountain ranges in New Mexico and in Arizona in April, May, and June than in the Colorado Rockies. These months are critical for the reproduction and growth of shrews.  As mentioned above, the shrews from east of the continental divide in Montana are smaller than those of the other mountains of the state, and it is upon such small animals that the name _Sorex vagrans_ has been based in this area. It is clear, however, that these smaller animals intergrade with the larger shrews of the more western mountains. The small size might be an adaptation to the lesser precipitation and harsher continental climate east of the continental divide in Montana.   Great Basin and Columbia Plateau Section  The vagrant shrews of the Great Basin and adjoining Columbia Plateau and Snake River Plains are smaller than their relatives in the Rocky Mountains and, by virtue of less gray in their pelage, are reddish in summer and blackish rather than grayish in winter. There is little significant geographic variation in shrews throughout this region, although owing to their restriction to the vicinity of water, the populations of shrews are more or less isolated from one another and each is somewhat different from the next. Those from nearest the Rockies are sometimes slightly larger and those from some places in Nevada are slightly paler than the average. This small reddish shrew is found all the way to the Pacific coast of California, Oregon, and Washington. In these coastal areas it is somewhat darker and sometimes a trifle larger than elsewhere. It intergrades with a somewhat larger, grayer shrew in the Sierra Nevada of California. Along the Wasatch front in Utah, this Great Basin shrew intergrades with the larger, grayer shrew of the Rockies. Owing to the abrupt change in elevation, the zone of intergradation is rather narrow horizontally. In the latitude of Salt Lake City, populations of intergrades occur at between 8,700 and 9,000 feet elevation. The lowland shrew occurs in the eastern part of the Snake River Plains, and along the valleys of the Bear and Salt rivers into Wyoming. Along the northern edge of the Snake River Plains and on the western edge of the mountains of central Idaho the transition from lowland to montane habitats is abrupt and in consequence the zone of contact between small and large shrews is narrow. In northern Idaho and northwestern Montana the transition from lowland to highland is more gradual. Tributaries of the Columbia River system, especially the Clark Fork, provide a path for movement of lowland forms into intermontane basins of western Montana. In addition, the vegetational zones are found at lower elevations, and there are boreal forests in the lowlands rather than only in the mountains as is the case in Utah and Colorado. In this area, therefore, the zone of intergradation between the smaller lowland shrew and the larger montane shrew is more gradual and gradually intergrading populations are found over a relatively large area. This has been well demonstrated for northwestern Montana by Clothier (1950). In southern British Columbia and northern Washington this shrew in the mountains is large and in the intermontane valleys is small. There is extensive interdigitation of valleys and mountain ranges, and, consequently, of life-zones in this region. In a few places, recognizably distinct populations of the vagrant shrew occur within a few miles of one another, but in other places there are populations of intergrades. West of the Cascades no evidence of intergradation has been found and the two kinds occur almost side by side and maintain their distinctness.  These Great Basin shrews dwell in hydrosere communities as do their Rocky Mountain counterparts. In this arid region such a habitat obviously is the only one habitable for a shrew of the _vagrans_ group. These shrews often maintain their predilection for such habitats when they reach the Pacific coast, and are commonly found in such places as coastal marshes, marshy meadows, and streamsides, while the woodlands are inhabited by other species.  These small shrews of the Great Basin and the small vagrant shrews of the Pacific Coast were called _Sorex vagrans_ by Jackson.   Summary of Geographic Variation  Large reddish shrews of the coast of California and southwestern Oregon become smaller and darker to the north. From southwestern British Columbia they again become larger as one proceeds northward along the coast to Wrangell, Alaska, and north of that they again become smaller. Moving inland from the coast the shrews become markedly smaller in Alaska and British Columbia. The smaller inland and montane form occurs south through the Rocky Mountains, becoming slightly smaller in central Montana, slightly larger in southeastern New Mexico, and slightly smaller in western New Mexico and in Arizona. This montane form intergrades with a smaller more reddish Great Basin shrew, the zone of intergradation roughly following the western slope of the Rocky Mountains. The Great Basin shrew occurs westward to the Pacific Coast; there the Great Basin shrew occurs with, although in part it is ecologically separated from, the large reddish coastal shrews.  There seems to be an intergrading chain of subspecies of one species, the end members of which (the small Great Basin form and the large coastal form) are so different in size and ecological niche that they are able to coexist without interbreeding. In southern British Columbia the morphological differences are not so marked as farther south along the Pacific Coast. There, in British Columbia, reproductive isolation is not complete and occasional populations of intergrades occur. In Montana extensive intergradation occurs in a broad zone of transitional habitat. Along the western edge of the Rockies from Idaho south to Utah the zone of transition from montane to basin habitat is sharp and the zone of intergradation, although present, is fairly narrow, perhaps because there is little intermediate habitat which logically might be expected to be most suitable for intergrading populations.  The oldest name applied to a shrew of the group under consideration is _Sorex vagrans_ Baird, 1858, the type locality of which is Willapa Bay, Pacific County, Washington. The name applies to the small vagrant shrew of this area, rather than to the larger forest dweller which has been known as _Sorex obscurus_. The name _S. vagrans_, in the specific sense, must therefore apply to all the shrews discussed which have heretofore been known by the names _S. pacificus_, _S. yaquinae_, _S. obscurus_, and _S. vagrans_.  A situation such as the one here described where well differentiated end members of a chain of subspecies overlap over an extensive geographic range throughout the year without interbreeding--thus reacting toward one another as do full species--so far as I know has not previously been found to exist in mammals. The overlapping end-members of the chain of subspecies of _Sorex vagrans_ really do coexist; specimens of the overlapping subspecies have been taken together at the same localities from California to British Columbia. I have taken a specimen of _S. v. vagrans_ and several of _S. v. setosus_ in the same woodlot at Fort Lewis, Pierce County, Washington. Two subspecies of deer, _Odocoileus hemionus_, in the Sierra Nevada of California, occur together over a sizeable area but for only a part of each year that does not include the breeding season (Cowan, 1936:156-157). In the deer mouse, _Peromyscus maniculatus_, the geographic ranges of several pairs of subspecies meet at certain places without intergradation of the two kinds. In these instances well marked ecological differences exist between the subspecies involved. In western Washington, for example, the geographic range of the lowland subspecies, _P. m. austerus_, interdigitates to the east and west with the range of the montane and coniferous forest-inhabiting subspecies, _P. m. oreas_, and the two kinds have not been shown to intergrade. _Peromyscus maniculatus artemesiae_ and _P. m. osgoodi_ come together without interbreeding in Glacier National Park, Montana. _P. m. artemesiae_ is almost entirely a forest-dwelling subspecies, whereas _osgoodi_ is an inhabitant of open country. The two kinds do not actually occur together ecologically although they occur together in buildings at the edge of the woods (A. Murie, 1933:4-5).     [Illustration: FIG. 5. Probable present geographic distribution       of _Sorex vagrans_. The range of _S. v. vagrans_ and its       derivatives _S. v. vancouverensis_, _S. v. halicoetes_, and       _S. v. paludivagus_, is shown by lines slanting in a different       direction than those which mark the range of all the other       subspecies of _S. vagrans_. The region in which _S. v. vagrans_       occurs together with other subspecies of _S. vagrans_ is shown       by the superposition of one pattern upon the other.]  Cases of sympatric existence of two subspecies of one species are known in birds and in reptiles.
