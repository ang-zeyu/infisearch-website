While they continue so, Ypres and this little remaining fragment of Belgian soil and the path to Calais are safe._                              *IN THE YPRES SALIENT*                                    *I.*                   *WITH THE BRITISH ARMY IN THE FIELD,*   _June 3rd._  From the summit of the Scherpenburg the eye sweeps over a low-lying, gently undulating tract of country chequered by field and copse and traversed by roads.  On the extreme left the crumbling towers of the city of Ypres upstand white in the morning sunlight.  Far on the right the spires and chimneys of Menin loom on the distant horizon, Between these two points in the range of vision a broad swathe of naked red earth, torn and fretted and pitted with \"craters,\" marks the eastern and southern boundary line of the bloodiest battlefield of the War--the Ypres Salient. The northern portion of this famous area, which is almost exactly bisected by the Menin road, is hidden behind the city.  Here are Langemarcke, St. Julien, St. Jean, and Zonnebeke, the scene of Canadian valour thirteen months ago in the Second Battle of Ypres; the segment we now overlook touches just east of Hooge and curves along past Zillebeke, St. Eloi and Hill 60, which is the south-western extremity of the Salient.  When the sun rose on Friday, June 2nd, the whole of this part of the Front, from the battered little hamlet of Hooge on the north to Hill 60 on the south, and passing through Sanctuary Wood, a distance, roughly, of a couple of miles, was held by 20,000 soldiers from the Overseas West.  They were drawn from all classes--ranchers, farmers, miners, merchants and clerks from Winnipeg, Calgary, and Vancouver.  There was a sprinkling of professional soldiers.  Some hailed from Toronto, and others from as far East as Montreal.  On their extreme left, where it linked up with a British Division, was a famous regiment whose deeds have already thrilled the Empire, which, repeatedly shattered, has returned again and again to take up a post of danger on the firing-line. The two divisions to which all these troops belong have been serving in the Salient for months, watching eagerly and ardently every move of the enemy’s game.  What that game was every man knew well.  It was to push past them and gain that tragedy-haunted grey heap of crumbling masonry whose name is already writ large on the page of Canadian history. This they were--each man of them--pledged to frustrate to the last drop of his life’s blood. Were the Germans to break through here, all the efforts of our race for nineteen months would be as naught, all the valour and sacrifice would be in vain.  [Illustration: THE RUINS OF YPRES. View taken from an aeroplane. By courtesy of _Illus. Lon. News._]  For weeks there had been a lull in the artillery fire, which is generally heavy in this sector.  Battalions weary with work and tension came in and out, as they were relieved or went to relieve.  Yet uppermost in every man’s mind was this: When will the next offensive come, and where?  Twice the Germans have come on in smashing force to blot out the Ypres Salient from the war map--two deadly battles have been fought.  Am I fated to take part in a third?  For several days it had not gone unobserved that the enemy was unusually active in pushing forward saps and trenches towards the centre of this line.  It has since been asked: Did the General in command of the Third Canadian Division suspect that something unusual was impending?  If his suspicions were aroused, the Germans had worked in impenetrable secrecy, and even the reports of his advanced scouts and of the Army aerial reconnaisance could not have told him that on this brilliant June morning behind those hostile parapets, from one to three hundred yards away, the Hun had been for weeks massing his artillery--guns of every age, shape, and calibre, but chiefly the terrible 5.9 naval guns (the \"Silent Lizzies\" which our men have learnt to dread), and howitzers, mountains of shells, pyramids of bombs.  Long rows of German gunners along those two miles of front to-day awaited the signal, and the hour for the signal had come.  It is stated that this divisional commander, the gallant General Mercer, ever alert, often astir soon after daybreak, never before had gone forward to the front trenches at so early an hour as six o’clock.  Small wonder, therefore, that his appearance there caused comment.  He was accompanied by his aide-de-camp, Lieutenant Gooderham, and was met by Brigadier-General Victor Williams, commanding the brigade then holding the front trenches. These, in company with Colonels Shaw and Ussher, made the inspection.  The soil hereabouts is loose, damp, and sandy, and only by rigid care and incessant exertions can the trenches be maintained in effectiveness. After breakfast the men were observed to be everywhere in high spirits, and went about their tasks of digging, repairing, rifle cleaning, and general tidying up with unusual good humour.  General Mercer entered a number of the observation stations and officers’ dug-outs and examined machine-gun emplacements with care.  The day’s work had begun well--all were at their appointed posts.  Occasionally a sniper’s rifle rang out, or a shrapnel shell burst harmlessly overhead. A soldier told me he was watching a flight of birds immediately above him in the clear blue sky, when lo! \"the Thing\" happened.  This man did not see the sky again for hours, and when he did he was on his back, being borne on a stretcher to the rear.  It was the lull before the storm.  For at ten minutes to nine o’clock, without any warning, hell broke loose.  The detonation, from being stunning, grew absolutely overwhelming.  It did not come from one part, but from the whole length of the opposing line opposite the Canadian Third Division.  It not only deafened the ear and paralysed the nerves, but darkened the firmament.  For the next hour or two dazed men groped about in the storm, unable to hear any word of command from their officers, clutching their rifles, trying to save the surrounding earth from engulfing them, waiting for what was to happen.  The two Generals, attempting to reach the communication trench, found their retreat cut off.  At the outset it appears that no shells, or very few, fell into the front trenches, and the machine gunners and trench-mortar men held to their posts.  But behind our front line a high wall of descending shells, screaming, crashing, exploding, emitting clouds of noxious smoke, shut off chance of escape by the communication trenches and all hope of support and succour, from the reserve trenches in the rear. Moments passed that seemed hours, and then the iron and steel missiles began to rain down and explode in the front line, scattering death and destruction.  Nothing could live for long in such a tempest.  The sides of the trenches began to crumble and fall in.  Yet by a miracle our men held on, darting from one devastated section to another in order to gain refuge.  Beginning with Hooge, which was held--600 yards of front--by the men of the Royal Canadian Regiment, there came a fifty yards’ gap in the line, low-lying sodden ground which was undefended--it being thought it might prove a trap for the Germans; then came the section of front held by the Princess Patricia’s, which included the embowed hollow known as the \"Appendix\" (only forty yards from the German trenches) and the Loop.  On their right was a brigade of the Canadian Mounted Rifles, who defended a portion of Sanctuary and Armagh Woods.  In the fatal Loop was stationed a whole company of Princess Patricia’s Light Infantry. As the men hung on there, grim and expectant, there was a terrific explosion.  When the flying fragments had subsided, a watcher from a balloon would have seen only a jagged and enormous crater--awful in its stillness.  The Loop had been mined by the enemy, and the entire company of brave men had perished. Another monstrous German mine exploded, but with less deadly effect.  By this time all the communication trenches were battered flat.  Orders had somehow been conveyed to the troops to flee for their lives, and some few hundreds attempted to beat a retreat through the deadly barrage.  Only a handful of them got through.  The majority of the survivors stayed on the ground or hid in such refuge as they could find. One--two--three hours passed; not for a moment--not for a single second did the hideous thunder slacken.  It was now that there took place in the intervening ground between the enemy’s barrage and our own a thousand struggles between brave men palpitating with health and life and hundreds of merciless hidden machines belching forth fragments of insensate metal.  For this is the essence and image of modern warfare.  It was flesh and blood grappling with lead and iron.  On our own side the sound of our artillery was indistinguishable; but a great volume of British shells did pierce that infernal barrage and crash eastward into the German line. Once, it is related, two shells from opposing sides collided in mid-air with a shriek like a woman in agony.  Our gunners worked madly, and it is certain they wrought havoc amongst the enemy.  But they were severely handicapped.  It was an unequal contest.  The Germans seemed to know the position of every Canadian battery, and all of these got their share of the enemy’s attention.  In the intervening territory many gallant men were ministering to the wounded who, torn, splintered, and bleeding, lay strewn upon the ground. Stretcher-bearers were moving backwards and forwards as though their nerves were of steel.  Officers were huddling their men together in places of uncertain sanctuary. Colonel Shaw, of the Canadian Mounted Rifles, directed eighty of his men to Cumberland dug-outs--a little shallow square.  When it became too hot there, he forced them all out through a gap and bade them run for their lives.  He himself refused to leave his"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/46256"],["title","In the Ypres Salient (#2)"],["body","men, and remained there valiantly at his post until a shell struck him and he was killed.  Seventy yards from this spot was the dressing-station of the battalion. Here the medical officer in charge toiled unceasingly all through that terrible morning, the wounded coming to him, some crawling on hands and knees, by scores.  Before the war Captain Haight was a jovial ship’s surgeon on a steamer plying between Vancouver and Honolulu.  He was a man of infinite courage--\"nothing ever rattled him or upset his temper,\" said one survivor to me.  When the dressing-station was shelled, he moved with his assistant, Lieutenant Atkinson, calmly and coolly to another on more exposed ground, and continued his humane work to the last, when he was dispatched by a bayonet in the most revolting manner.  Another officer, Captain Harper, who hailed from Kamsack, in distant Saskatchewan, was ministering to an officer and three desperately wounded men.  He refused to leave them when the lull came and the Germans were seen advancing, although they urged him to do so.  \"I said I’d stand by you boys,\" he said, \"and I will.\"  A few minutes later and he, too, was gone.  Meanwhile, on the other side of the barrage, two battalions of desperate men were watching for a chance to cleave their way through to their comrades in peril.  But there was little hope that any in the front line of trenches survived.  It was now ten minutes to one o’clock. After four hours’ steady bombardment the storm of shell ceased as suddenly as it had begun. Forthright from the opposite trenches sprang a swarm of grey-coated Huns.  They must have been firmly convinced that amidst those rugged, battered, seared, and bloody mounds and ditches, which four hours before had been the British trenches, not one single soul had escaped.  Fully accoutred and with overcoats and full haversacks, they advanced in high spirits.  Apart from a few bombers, not a man of those advancing hordes appears to have been in proper fighting trim.  They came forward gaily, light-heartedly, as victors after a victory.  It was then the most wonderful thing of the day happened.  Out of the earth there leapt a handful of wild-eyed soldiers, two officers amongst them, pale, muddied and reeking with sweat, who, running forward with upraised rifles and pistols, bade defiance to the oncoming foe.  On they ran, and having discharged their weapons, flung them in the very faces of the Huns.  Death was inevitable for these--the only surviving occupants of the British front line--and it was better to die thus, breathing defiance to a cowardly enemy, than be shot in a ditch and spitted through with a Hun bayonet.  Thus they perished.  Few but the wounded fell into the hands of the enemy.  A Toronto officer, himself in the very thick of the fight, and performing wonders of valour, told me that he had last seen General Mercer sitting dazed and wounded on the ground, just as the shell fire ceased and the Germans were advancing.  Amongst the prisoners were General Williams and Colonel Ussher, both of whom were lying in a communication trench at \"Vigo Street.\"  General Williams was wounded in the face.  The cessation of fire was the signal for the Canadian supports to hasten forward to meet the enemy, who was now advancing in force and bringing up his machine-gunners and bombers.  The battalion holding Maple Copse became planted firmly and refused to budge, and having dug itself in, held that position all day.  Colonel Baker, M.P., of the Mounted Rifles, was unhappily hit by shell in the lungs, and died later in the day.  The Princess Patricia’s fought with their accustomed gallantry, led by the brave Colonel Buller, lately Military Secretary to H.R.H. the Duke of Connaught, and helped, although at terrible cost, to check the further German advance.  Buller, his blood up, seeing his men giving way a little, ordered them to charge along a trench known as Gordon Road.  They obeyed with a rush, and, not to impede their onset, Buller leapt up on to the edge of the trench and ran forward, crying: \"On, boys, on! Break them to pieces!\"  He was thus encouraging them when a bullet pierced his heart.  \"I never saw a finer death,\" one man told me.  \"He looked very brave and handsome up there, outlined against the sky, the only figure on the bank above, his helmet off, and his face very pale and blazing with anger, and his right arm pointing forward.  He fell down headlong, but we never turned back until we gave the Germans hell.  Two hours later, I was told, the Colonel was still lying there on his face on the edge of the trench.  Then they turned him over and brought him in.\"  The second-in-command of the Patricia’s, Major Hamilton Gault, was severely wounded, and many gallant officers fell.  The machine-guns of the Royal Canadian Regiment inflicted fearful mortality.  Between them and the Princess Patricia’s was a gap, fifty yards wide, into which the Germans poured on finding it undefended, and were smashed on both flanks, and mowed down by scores.  On their arrival at the \"Appendix,\" only forty yards from the enemy’s front trenches, they were met by a withering fire which almost obliterated them.  A little further south they were more successful, and from the \"Loop,\" where the company of the Princess Patricia’s had perished, they penetrated to Gordon Road and beyond, and then commenced a fierce attack to the north.  But here a swift and stern retribution was to be exacted from them.  A company commander, Captain Hugh Niven, who, although already twice wounded, was still full of valour and resolution, gathered the remainder of his men together, some seventy rifles in all and two machine-guns, and, hidden behind sandbags, awaited the foe in silence.  The order was given: \"Not a man must shoot until I give the signal!\"  Apparently the Boche was taken unawares. The volley which blazed forth was reminiscent of the immortal front rank fire of Lascelles’ Regiment on the Heights at Quebec.  One stalwart French-Canadian, Arseneau by name, who had often faced wild animals in the backwoods, burning with ardour, could not be restrained from leaping up on the improvised parapet and repeatedly emptying his rifle, before the enemy could recover from his astonishment.  His captain tells me that no fewer than eight Germans fell to this man’s marksmanship alone in that swift encounter. When it was over, at least one hundred of the enemy slain lay on the ground.  Afterwards the officer mentioned shepherded his men into a section of trench, he himself spending the whole of the ensuing night perambulating the trenches, directing defences, ministering to and encouraging and directing his men.  It was truly an astonishing feat of physical endurance.  \"We had lost so many,\" he said, \"I felt I ought to be on deck as long as I could crawl.\"  He was still giving orders when the stretcher-bearers lifted him out and bore him away to the field hospital.  A gallant youth in his twenty-fourth year was Captain Cotton, son of a Major-General, sometime Inspector-General of the Canadian Forces. Cotton was ordered to take two machine-guns and dig them in in such a manner in the front line that they would enfilade the enemy’s trenches on the left.  If the Germans rushed his own position, he was to disable his guns and retire with his men. After fighting valiantly for a time, the enemy charged, whereupon Cotton, instead of retiring, coolly hauled both guns out of their emplacements and turned them on the advancing Germans.  He and his men continued firing until all were slain, and lay a heap of mangled flesh about their guns.  On the edge of the craters the bodies were seen of a stalwart Sergeant-Major of the Mounted Rifles and two privates of the Princess Patricia’s.  Lying around them and beneath them were the bodies of no fewer than twelve Germans whom they had slain with the bayonet.   By half-past five o’clock the enemy had penetrated and possessed themselves of about a mile of our front line trenches in the middle of the arc they had attacked with such demoniac force.  The trenches south of Hooge for 1,000 yards we still held, and also the front east of Hill 60.  After nightfall the Germans, renewing their bombardment, pushed on 700 yards further towards Zillebeke, and proceeded to entrench themselves firmly.  For the moment their artillery had won them an advantage, but the price they had paid was at least as terrible as our own--how terrible we shall not know until the close of the War, and the German official records or the German survivors of this battle speak and tell us.  [Illustration: (Photograph--street in Ypres)]  I write in haste, surrounded by the terrible evidences of a bloody struggle.  It would be impossible within the limits of time and space to recount even a tithe of the outstanding deeds of heroism of yesterday’s battle, which waged without cessation until nine at night. Albeit one more incident I must relate.  It is the story of the Rev. Gilles Wilken, a parson from Medicine Hat, on the Bow River.  At the outbreak of war Wilken flung aside his surplice and enlisted as a private.  He came to England with his battalion, where his talent for ministration and good works could not be concealed, and he was promptly, when a vacancy occurred, appointed chaplain.  Having on this day, in Sanctuary Wood, done all he could for the dead and dying, Wilken felt it his duty to strike a blow of sterner sort for his country.  He seized a rifle, wielding it with accuracy and effect as long as his ammunition lasted, and then went after the Germans with a bayonet.  After one particularly fierce thrust the weapon broke. Whereupon this astounding parson, baring his arms, flew at one brawny Boche with his fists, and the last seen of him he was lying prone and overpowered.   The outstanding feature of the day was, however, not the numerous traits of individual valour.  It is the marvellous tact and moral impetus of the officers and non-commissioned "]]]
