Blacker and blacker rolled the smoke, heavier and heavier piled the screen to leeward, and still more frantically shrilled the appeals for help. At the end of my patience at actions which it now began to dawn upon me looked more than a little suspicious, I headed the _Cornwall_ straight after the runaway and soon reduced the interval separating us sufficiently to reach her with 'Visual.' She brought up sharp at my 'Stop instantly!' and a quarter of an hour later my boarding party was clambering over her side.  \"'Where's the _Karlsruhe_?' I shouted impatiently to the Boarding Officer as his boat came back alongside again. I knew something of the accuracy of German long range naval gunnery, and was far from being easy in mind regarding the kind of surprise packet that might at any moment be wafted out of that slowly thinning smoke-blur to leeward.  \"'There,' he replied with a comprehensive sweep of the arm in quite the opposite direction from the one I had been expecting the enemy. 'Right there, Sir.' That old lunatic of a skipper thought the _Cornwall_ was the _Karlsruhe_!\"  \"Did you get your frozen beef?\" I asked.  The Captain smiled the pleased smile of one who recalls something that has given him great satisfaction.  \"I think that afternoon marked the beginning of the 'Food Economy' campaign in the Navy,\" he replied. \"If the Admiralty had been able to continue buying frozen beef at the rate that crestfallen but highly relieved skipper--quite of his own free will--charged for the lot we loaded up after he had found it was not to be his fate to be sunk by the _Karlsruhe_,--well, the Government could have probably built a new battleship or two and never missed the money out of the saving.\"  The recollection of the treat that fresh meat was after a long period on \"bully beef\" ration turned the Captain's thoughts to another time of plenty he had experienced after the _Cornwall_ had helped the wounded _Carmania_ limp back to Base following her successful engagement with the _Cap Trafalgar_.  \"In these times of food economy and restricted rations,\" he said, \"it fairly makes my mouth water to think of the feasts Captain G---- spread for us during the days we were devising a way to get the battered _Carmania_ back to England. You see, when the war started she was just about to sail on one of her transatlantic voyages with the usual midsummer cargo of American millionaires, and her cuisine was of a character calculated to satisfy their Epicurean tastes. When they converted her to an auxiliary cruiser, it was the usual sledge-hammer, crow-bar, and over-the-side procedure with the mirrors, the upholsteries, and the mahoganies, but they left the stores, God bless them, they left the stores. Can you fancy how things such as truffled quail, and asparagus tips with mayonnaise--_iced_--and _caf√© parfait_, and Muscat dates, and California oranges--with the big gold labels on--tasted to men who had been for weeks pretty nearly down to the classic old wind-jammer ration of 'lobscouse' and 'dog's-body'? And those plump, black, five-inch-long Havanas in the silver foil (I can smell the soothing fumes of them yet), and that rarely blended Mocha, and those bottles of 1835 Cognac--the pungent bouquet of them scents the memories of the long evenings I sat with G---- in the wreck of his fire-swept cabin while he yarned to me of the ripping fight he had just come out of. And how we all envied G---- his luck--getting as sporting a show as a man could ask for in that half-converted liner while we cruisers were vainly chasing smoke and rumours over most of the South Atlantic. Nothing less than the banquets he gave us would have salved our heart-burnings.\"  And so it was that the Captain was led on to speak of what he had heard--from those who took part in it, and only a few hours from the time it happened--of the first great duel ever fought between modern armed merchantmen, a conflict, indeed, which is still practically unique in naval history.  \"There was not much to choose between the ships,\" he said. \"The _Cap Trafalgar_--one of the latest of the Hamburg Sud Amerika liners--had a good deal the best of it on the score of age, and the _Carmania_ probably something on the score of size. The latter had been hastily converted at Liverpool immediately after the outbreak of the war, while the former turned herself from sheep into wolf about the same time by arming herself with the guns of a small German gun-boat. This craft, by the way, steamed to the nearest Brazilian port and, with true Hunnish logic, claimed the right to intern as a peaceful German Merchantman on the strength of the fact that it was no longer armed! The largest guns that either ship had were four-inch, the _Carmania_ having slight advantage on the score of number. The _Carmania_ would have been no match for the _Karlsruhe_, just as the _Cap Trafalgar_ would have fallen easy prey to the _Cornwall_ or another of the British cruisers in those waters. Under the circumstances, it was a happy fatality that let these two ex-floating palaces fight with each other and in their own class.  \"The first word we had of the engagement was a wireless Captain G---- sent out saying, in effect, that he had sunk the _Trafalgar_, but, as his bridge was burned up, his steering gear shot away, and all his navigating instruments destroyed, that he would be glad to have some one come and tell him where he was and lead him to a place where he could, so to speak, lie down and lick his wounds for a while. It took a jolly good bit of searching to find a ship that couldn't tell any more about itself than that, but we finally sighted her ragged silhouette and gave her a lead to such a haven as the practically open seas of our rendezvous afforded.  \"Poor G---- had lost a good deal more than his steering gear it soon transpired, for the fire which had consumed his bridge had also gutted his cabin, and reduced everything in it to cinders except an old Norfolk jacket. How _that_ escaped we never could figure out, for of garments hanging on pegs to the left and right of it no trace was left. As G---- was of about three times the girth of any other British officer in those waters at the time, the wardrobe we tried to get together for him was a grotesque combination; indeed, so far as I recall now, the old Norfolk had to serve him as everything from pyjamas and bath-robe to dinner-jacket and great-coat during that trying period. It was a weird figure he cut presiding at those Gargantuan feasts he spread for us on the bruised and battered old _Carmania_, but there wasn't a one of us who wouldn't have changed places with him--Norfolk and all--for the assurance of half his luck. Such is the monotony of this patrol work in the outer seas, that, after your first enthusiasm wears off, you get into a state of mind in which you can never conceive that anything is ever going to happen. That we had the one most decisive naval battle of the war just ahead of us, no one dreamed at this time.  \"The fight between the _Carmania_ and _Cap Trafalgar_,\" he continued, \"has well been called 'The Battle of the Haystacks,' for never before (or since, for that matter) have two ships with such towering upper works stood off and tried to batter each other to pieces with gunfire. Indeed, I well recall G----'s saying that, up to the very end, he could not conceive that either ship could sink the other, and of how--even after the _Carmania_ had been struck three or four-score times and a raging fire forward had driven him from the bridge--he kept wondering in the back of his brain what sort of a fight the duel would resolve itself into when both had exhausted their shells. Luckily, he did not have to face that problem.  \"Both ships, according to G----'s account, began blazing at each other as soon as they came in range, and, as each was eager to fight it out to a finish, the distance separating them was, for a while, reduced as rapidly as possible. At something like three thousand yards, however, some sort of a rapid-fire gun burst into action on the _Trafalgar_. 'It didn't appear to be doing me much harm,' said G---- in telling of it, 'but the incessant \"pom-pom\" of the accursed thing got so much on my nerves that I drew off far enough to dull the edge of its infernal yapping.'  \"A thing which came near to putting the _Carmania_ out of the running before she had completed the polishing off of her opponent was the shell which I have spoken of as violating the sanctity of the Captain's cabin--the one that burned everything but the Norfolk jacket. This projectile--a four-inch--though (probably owing to the small resistance offered by the light upper works) it did not explode, generated enough heat in its passage to start a fire. Beginning on G----'s personal effects, this conflagration spread to the bridge, destroying the navigating instruments and ultimately making it impossible to remain there--the latter a serious blow in itself. What made this fire especially troublesome was the difficulty, because of the cutting of the main, of bringing water to bear upon it. As it was, it was necessary to head the _Carmania_ 'down the wind' to reduce the draught fanning the flames. Nothing else would have saved her. Except for one thing, this expedient would have"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/42604"],["title","Stories of the Ships (#2)"],["body","the now thoroughly worsted (though G---- didn't know it) _Trafalgar_ to withdraw from the action, and this was that the latter was herself on fire and had to take the same course willy-nilly. From that moment on the battle was as irretrievably joined as one of those old Spanish knife-duels in which the opponents were locked together in a room to fight to a finish. Often as not, so they say, the victor in one of these fights only survived the loser by minutes or hours, and so would it have been in this instance had they not finally been able to extinguish the fire on the _Carmania_.  \"G----'s account of the way he had to carry on after being driven from the bridge--it was really a splendid bit of seamanship--was funny in the extreme, but the reality must have been funnier still, that is, if that term can be applied to anything happening while shells are bursting and blowing men to bits every few seconds. G---- is one of the biggest men in the Navy--around the waist, I mean--so it wasn't to be expected of him to be very shifty on his feet. And yet, by the irony of Fate, it was he of all men who was suddenly confronted with a task that required only less 'foot-work' than it did 'head-work.' With the battle going on all the time, they rigged up some sort of a 'jury' steering gear, or it may be that they steered her by her screws. At any rate, G---- had to con her from the most commanding position he could find on one of the after decks, or rather, as he had no longer voice-pipe communication with the engine-room, he had to keep dashing back and forth (it must have been for all the world like a batsman running in cricket) between two or three commanding positions. 'If I wanted to open the range a bit,' he said, 'I had to nip for'ard, wait till there was an interval in both gun-fire and shell-burst, and yell down a hatchway' (or was it a ventilator?) 'to the engine-room to \"Slow port!\" or if I suddenly found it imperative to open the distance, I had to make the same journey and pass the word down to \"Stop starboard!\" The very thought of that mad shuttling back and forth under the equatorial sun used to make poor G---- mop his forehead and pour himself a fresh drink every time he told the story.  \"Battered and burning fiercely as both ships were, G---- confessed that even at this juncture he could not rid himself of the feeling that neither of them had enough shells to sink the other. 'I was racking my brain for some plan of action to follow when that moment arrived,' he said, 'when suddenly the _Trafalgar_ began to heel sharply and started to sink. It was our second or third salvo, which had holed her badly at the water-line, that did the business. She had kept steaming and fighting for close to an hour and a quarter afterwards, though.'  \"G---- told us one very good story about his Gunnery officer. 'It was just before the shell which started the fire struck us,' he said, 'that Y----'s sun helmet was knocked off--I don't remember whether it was by the wind or the concussion of the firing. Seeing it fall to the deck below, he ran to the rail of the bridge and began shouting for some one to bring it back to him. Before long, luckily, a seaman who had heard the shouting in a lull of the firing, poked his head out to see what it was about, and presently came puffing up the ladder with the fugitive head-piece. I say _luckily_, because the gun-control for the whole ship was suspended while Y---- waited for that infernal helmet. And the funniest thing about it all was that, when I ventured to suggest a few days later that it might be well if he made use of the chin-strap of his helmet the next time he was in action, he claimed to have no recollection whatever of the incident--thought he had been \"sticking to his guns\" all the time. Just shows how a man's brain works in air-tight compartments when he is really busy.'  \"The Surgeon of the _Carmania_ (continued the Captain)--a splendid chap who had given up a lucrative West-end practice and sworn he was under forty (although he was really fifty-two) in order to get a chance to do something for his country--told me many stories to prove the splendid spirit of the men that passed under his hands during and after the fight. Though most of the crew were only Royal Naval Reservists, with no experience of and but little training for fighting, it appears that they stood what is perhaps the hardest of all trials--that of seeing their mates wounded and killed beside them--like seasoned veterans.  \"'There was one stout-hearted young Cockney,' said the Surgeon, 'whom, after I had finished removing a number of shell fragments from various parts of his anatomy, I asked what he thought of the fight. \"Rippin', Sir,\" he replied, grinning ecstatically through the bandage that held up the flap of a torn cheek; \"rippin', never been in one like it before.\" Then, as his eye caught the smile which I could not quite repress at the lifetime of naval battling suggested by that \"nev'r afore,\" he concluded with \"Not ev'n in Whitechapel.\"'  \"The Surgeon came across one man who insisted that the blood flowing from a ragged tear in his arm was really spattered there when one of his mates--whose mangled body he bestrode--had been decapitated by a shell a few minutes before; and there was one lot of youngsters who went on cheerily 'Yo-heave-ho-ing' in hoisting some badly needed shells which were so slippery with blood that they had to be sanded before they could be handled. Grimly pathetic was the story he told me of a gunner whose torn hand he had just finished amputating and bandaging when some one shouted into the door of the dressing station that the _Trafalgar_ was going down.  \"'He crowded to a port I had had opened,' said the Surgeon, 'just in time to see one of the last salvoes from the _Carmania_ go crashing into the side of the heeling enemy. \"Huroor, boys,\" he shouted; \"give 'em beans,\" and as he cheered he started (what had evidently been a favourite gesture of approval and excitement with him) to smite mightily with his right fist into the palm of his left hand. But the blow fell upon air; there was no answering thwack. The gnarled, weather-beaten fist shot past a bandaged stump. He drew back with surprise for a moment, and then, grinning a bit sheepishly, like a boy surprised in some foolish action, edged back beside me at the port. \"Quite forgot there was su'thin' missin',\" he said half apologetically, trying to wriggle the elbow of the maimed arm back into the sling from which it had slipped. \"S'pose I'll be havin' to get used to it, won't I?\" As the _Trafalgar_ took a new list and began rapidly to settle he burst into renewed \"Huroors.\" \"By Gawd, Sir,\" he cried, when she had finally gone, \"if I 'ad as many 'ands as an oktypuss, I'd 'a giv'n 'em all fer the joy o' puttin' that blinkin' pyrit down to Davy Jones.\"'\"  The Captain gazed long at the coals of the grate, on his face the pleased smile of one who recalls treasured memories. \"I can't tell you how sorry we were to see the _Carmania_ go,\" he said finally. \"My word, how we _did_ enjoy those feasts good old G---- spread for us!\" With a laugh he roused himself from the pleasant reverie and took up again the narrative of the _Cornwall_.  \"The first intimation we had\" (he resumed) \"of the sinking of Admiral Craddock's fleet came in the form of a wireless from the _Defence_ asking if I had heard of the disaster at Coronel. Details which came in the course of the next day or two brought home to us the astonishing change in the whole situation which the appearance of Von Spee in South American waters had wrought. The blow fell like a bolt from the blue.  \"As rapidly as possible the various British warships in the South Atlantic rendezvoused off Montevideo to discuss a plan of action. What the next move of the victorious Von Spee would be we could only surmise. German prisoners picked up after the Falklands battle said his ultimate plan--after seizing Port Stanley for a base, and undergoing such a refit there as was practicable with the means at his disposal--was to scatter his ships as commerce raiders all over the Atlantic, cutting, if possible, the main sea arteries of England to North America. The Germans figured, according to these prisoners, that the suspension of the North Atlantic traffic for even a month (no impossible thing for five speedy cruisers in the light of the delays to sailings caused by the _Emden_ and _Karlsruhe_ working alone) would practically paralyse England's war efforts and reduce her military effort in France to almost negligible proportions. I am much more inclined to believe that this--rather than escorting a fleet of German merchantmen, bearing German reservists from Argentina, Uruguay, and Southern Brazil, to South-West Africa from Buenos Aires and Montevideo--was the real plan of Von Spee.  However, it was the immediate rather than the ultimate plans of the Germans that was our chief--in fact, our only--concern. Whether Von Spee intended heading for the North Atlantic later or South Africa, or up the Thames--the only way he could clear the road to any of these objectives was by first destroying such British warships as still remained in South American waters. It was these ships which had hurried to get together off Montevideo, in order to make the path of the enemy as thorny and full of pitfalls as possible.  \"They had no illusions respecting what the immediate future held for them, that little group of cruiser captains that gathered in the Admiral's cabin of the _Defence_ to formulate a plan of action. We knew nothing at that time of what had been decided upon at the Admiralty; indeed, we were quite in agreement that it would be deemed inexpedient to send any battle cruisers away from the North Sea, where they might be imperatively needed any day, on a voyage to the South Atlantic that might easily resolve itself into a months'-long wild-goose chase. Our plans, therefore, were laid entirely on the assumption "]]]
