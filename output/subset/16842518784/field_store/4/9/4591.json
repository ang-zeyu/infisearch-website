His manner was particularly domineering.  With his sleek, black hair, carefully parted in the middle, and his neatly trimmed moustache, he had the appearance of a very superior person.  Moreover, he did not attempt to disguise the fact that he looked upon his schoolboy cousin barely with toleration, if not with actual contempt.  \"I like it tremendously!\" said Harry, brightening up at once.  \"I suppose you know I got into the Cricket Eleven, and took four wickets against Harrow?\"  He said this with frank, boyish enthusiasm.  There was nothing boastful about it.  Von Hardenberg, raising his eyebrows, flicked some cigarette-ash from his trousers.  \"_Himmel!_\" he observed.  \"You don’t suppose I take the least interest in what you do against Harrow.  The whole of your nation appears to think of nothing but play.  As for us Germans, we have something better to think of!\"  Harry looked at his cousin.  For a moment a spirit of mischief rose within him, and he had half a mind to ask whether von Hardenberg had forgotten his gambling debts.  However, he thought better of it, and went upstairs to dress for dinner.  The Judge came late from the bungalow, bursting into the dining-room as his two nephews were seating themselves at the table, saying that he had no time to change.  \"Boys,\" he cried, rubbing his hands together, \"I’ve made the greatest discovery of my life!  I’ve hit upon a thing that will set the whole world talking for a month!  I’ve discovered the Sunstone!  I’ve solved its mystery!  As you, Carl, would say, the whole thing’s _colossal_!\"  \"The Sunstone!\" cried Harry.  \"What is that?\"  \"The Sunstone,\" said the Judge, \"has been known to exist for centuries. It is the key to the storehouse of one of the greatest treasures the world contains.  It has been in my possession for nine years, and not till this evening did I dream that I possessed it.\"  \"Come!\" cried Harry.  \"You must tell us all about it!\"     CHAPTER II—The Sunstone   \"Well,\" said the Judge, pushing aside the plate of soup which he had hardly tasted, \"I don’t know whether or not the story will interest you. It ought to, because it’s romantic, and also melodramatic—that is to say, it is concerned with death.  It came into my possession nine years ago, when I was presiding judge at Sierra Leone.  I remember being informed by the police that a native from the region of Lake Chad had come into the country with several Arabs on his track.  He had fled for his life from the hills; he had gone as far south as the Congo, and had then cut back on his tracks; and all this time, over thousands of miles of almost impenetrable country, the Arabs—slave-traders by repute—had clung to his heels like bloodhounds.  In Sierra Leone he turned upon his tormentors and killed two of them.  He was brought before me on a charge of murder, and I had no option but to sentence him to death.  The day before he was hanged he wished to see me, and I visited him in prison. He gave into my hands a large, circular piece of jade, and I have kept it ever since, always looking upon it merely as a curiosity and a memento of a very unpleasant duty.  Never for a moment did I dream it was the Sunstone itself.  \"Now, before you can understand the whole story, you must know something of Zoroaster.  Zoroaster was the preacher, or prophet, who was responsible for the most ancient religion in the world.  He was the first of the Magi, or the Wise Men of the East, and it was he who framed the famous laws of the Medes and Persians.  He is supposed to have lived more than six thousand years before Christ.  \"The doctrine of Zoroaster is concerned with the worship of the sun; hence the name of the Sunstone.  This religion was adopted by the Persians, who conquered Egypt, and thus spread their influence across the Red Sea into Africa.  To-day, among the hills that surround Lake Chad, there exists a tribe of which little is known, except that they are called the Maziris, and are believed still to follow the religion of Zoroaster.  \"In the days when Zoroaster preached, it was the custom of his followers and admirers to present the sage with jewels and precious stones.  These were first given as alms, to enable him to live; but, as his fame extended, the treasure became so great that it far exceeded his needs.  \"One rumour has it that Zoroaster died in the Himalayas; another that his body was embalmed in Egypt and conveyed by a party of Ethiopians into the very heart of the Dark Continent, where it was buried in a cave with all his treasure.  \"The Sunstone is referred to by many ancient Persian writers.  I have known of it for years as the key to the treasure of Zoroaster.  As I have said, it is a circular piece of jade, bright yellow in colour, and of about the size of a saucer.  On both sides of the stone various signs and symbols have been cut.  On one side, from the centre, nine radii divide the circumference into nine equal arcs.  In each arc is a distinct cuneiform character, similar to those which have been found upon the stone monuments of Persia and Arabia.  \"The Arabs are in many ways the most wonderful people in the world. Their vitality as a race is amazing.  For centuries—possibly for thousands of years—they have terrorized northern and central Africa. They were feared by the ancient Egyptians, who built walls around their cities to protect them from the Bedouins—the ancestors of the men who to-day lead their caravans to Erzerum, Zanzibar, and Timbuctoo.  \"So far as I can discover, the Maziris are an Arab tribe who have given up their old nomad life.  Somewhere in the Maziri country is a group of caves which no European has ever entered.  They are known as the ’Caves of Zoroaster’, for it is here that the sage is supposed to have been buried.  The bones of Zoroaster, as well as the jewels, are said to lie in a vault cut in the living rock; and the Sunstone is the key which opens the entrance to that vault.  The man, whom in my capacity as a judge I was obliged to sentence to death, had no doubt stolen it, and had been pursued across the continent by the Maziri chieftains, who desired to recover the Sunstone.  \"There is the whole story.  A week ago I came across a description of the Sunstone in the writings of a Persian historian, and that description led me to suspect that the very thing was in my own possession.  I followed up clue after clue, and this evening I put the matter beyond all doubt.\"  Mr. Langton’s two nephews had listened in breathless interest.  Harry was leaning forward with his elbows on the table and his chin upon a hand.  Von Hardenberg lay back in a chair, his arms folded, his dark eyes fixed upon his uncle.  \"Then,\" said he, \"you have but to get into these so-called ’Caves of Zoroaster’ to possess yourself of the jewels?\"  The Judge smiled, and shook his head.  \"And to get into the caves,\" he answered, \"is just the very thing that, for the present, it is almost impossible for any European to do.  The Maziri are a wild and lawless tribe.  They are indeed so bloodthirsty, their country so mountainous, and their valleys so infertile, that hitherto no one has ever interfered with their affairs.  Like all the Arabs, they are a nation of robbers and cut-throats, who lived in the past by means of the slave-trade, and to-day exist by cattle-stealing and robbery.  The man who tries to enter the ’Caves of Zoroaster’ will have his work cut out.\"  \"Will you let us see the Sunstone?\" asked Harry.  \"Certainly, my boy,\" said Mr. Langton.  \"I’ll take you both down to the bungalow to-morrow morning, or—if you cannot wait till then—we can go to-night.\"  \"Isn’t it rather risky,\" asked von Hardenberg, \"to keep such a valuable thing out of the house?\"  \"The bungalow is always locked,\" said Mr. Langton, \"and I keep the Sunstone in a cabinet.  Moreover, you must remember that nobody knows of its value.  No thief would ever dream of stealing it.  It is, to all appearances, only an inferior piece of jade.\"  \"But you have money there as well?\" said von Hardenberg.  \"Not much,\" answered the Judge.  \"Since I do my accounts there it is convenient to have my cashbox at hand.  But it seldom contains more than twenty pounds—the amount of money I require to pay the men employed on the estate.\"  \"What an extraordinary thing,\" said Harry, still thinking of the treasure of Zoroaster, \"that it should have existed for all these years and never have been plundered.\"  \"Not so extraordinary,\" said Mr. Langton, \"when you know the Arabs. The Maziris, as I have told you, are of Arab descent, though they are not followers of the Prophet.  The sun-worshippers are extremely devout.  No priest of Zoroaster would think of stealing the treasure; that would be to plunge his soul into eternal punishment.\"  \"And no one else,\" asked von Hardenberg, \"no Mohammedan or heathen, has ever been able to enter the vault?\"  \"Never,\" said Mr. Langton, \"because the Sunstone is the secret.  That is why, when the Sunstone was stolen, they were so anxious to run the thief to earth.\"  Von Hardenberg knit his brows.  He was silent for a moment, and appeared to be thinking.  \"And you believe you have solved the mystery?\" he asked.  \"I know I have,\" said the Judge.  \"If at this moment I suddenly found myself in the Caves of Zoroaster, with the Sunstone in my hand, I could gain access to the vault.\"  Von Hardenberg bit his lip quickly, and then looked sharply at his uncle.  When he spoke, it was in the voice of a man who took little or no interest in the subject under discussion.  \"I should rather like to see it,\" he remarked.  Accordingly, as soon as dinner was finished, they put on their overcoats, and conducted by the Judge, who carried a lantern, they followed a path through the woods until they came to the bungalow.  Mr. Langton unlocked the door and put the key into his"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/39185"],["title","Across the Cameroons: A Story of War and Adventure (#2)"],["body",".  Then he lit an oil lamp, which presently burned up and illumined the room. They found themselves in what to all intents and purposes was a library.  The four walls were stacked with books, but the overflow of these was so great that many were piled upon chairs and in odd corners of the room. In the centre of the floor-space was a large writing-desk, and near this a cabinet with several drawers.  Lying open on the writing-desk was a fair-sized cash-box, in which several golden sovereigns glittered in the light.  \"How careless, to be sure!\" exclaimed the Judge.  \"I had no business to leave my cash-box open.  The truth is, I was so excited about this discovery that I forgot to put it away.\"  \"And where’s the Sunstone?\" asked von Hardenberg.  \"I keep it here,\" said Mr. Langton.  Going to the cabinet, and unlocking the third drawer from the top, he took out a large stone and laid it on the table in the light of the lamp.  His two nephews, one on either side of him, leaned forward to examine this extraordinary relic.  On one side of the Sunstone were the cuneiform characters already mentioned by the Judge.  On the other was a great deal of writing in the same primitive language, scratched upon the face of the jade, but so faint as to be barely legible.  \"It was only with the greatest difficulty,\" observed the Judge, \"that I managed to decipher and translate this writing.  It is in no known language.  Indeed, I would never have been able to make head or tail of it had I not been a scholar of Sanskrit.  This writing is nothing more nor less than the definite instructions for using the Sunstone for the purpose of entering the vaults of Zoroaster.\"  \"What does it say?\" asked von Hardenberg.  \"You are told to begin with a certain character and take the others in a circle ’in the way of the sun’—that is to say, from left to right, as with the hands of a clock.  Before the main vault is a large lock, which works on the same principle as the modern Bramah lock—a very ancient device.  It consists of nine enormous wheels.  The outside, or tyre, of each of these wheels is adorned with hundreds of cuneiform characters, all of them quite different.  Each wheel must be turned until the characters visible along a given line correspond with those upon the Sunstone.  Not otherwise can the vault be opened.\"  There followed a silence of several moments.  The Judge’s discovery seemed so romantic and so astonishing that it was almost impossible to believe it was true.  After a while, it was von Hardenberg who spoke.  \"And now that you have made this discovery,\" he asked, \"what do you propose to do?\"  \"I don’t know,\" said the Judge.  \"I have no desire to pillage a sacred shrine.  For the present I propose to keep the affair a secret whilst I continue my researches.  There are several points upon which the historical world desires to be enlightened.  Very little is known concerning the life of Zoroaster.\"  \"But surely,\" exclaimed von Hardenberg, \"you don’t intend to keep this to yourself!\"  \"When I have the whole facts of the case at my finger-tips,\" said the Judge, \"I will make the result of my investigations known to the authorities of the British Museum.\"  Soon after that they left the bungalow.  Before they went to bed that night von Hardenberg took his cousin aside and looked at him intently.  \"What do you make of it?\" he asked.  \"Of the Sunstone?\" asked Harry.  \"Yes,\" said the other.  \"It seems to me, if the old gentleman wanted to, he could make himself a millionaire.\"  Harry laughed.  \"I don’t think Uncle Jack cares much about money,\" said he.  \"He looks at the whole matter from a scientific point of view.\"  \"No doubt,\" exclaimed the Prussian.  \"No doubt.  I dare say he does.\"  And at that he turned and went slowly up the stairs.     CHAPTER III—Caught Red-handed   Some hours after sunset, on the evening of the following day, Jim Braid was stationed in the woods, on the look-out for poachers.  His father, John Braid, the head-gamekeeper, was also out that night, keeping watch in a different part of the estate.  A well-known gang of poachers had been reported in the district, and, the week before, several shots had been heard as late as twelve o’clock, for which the gamekeepers could not account.  The night was cold and foggy, and Jim wore the collar of his coat turned up, and carried his gun under his arm, with his hands thrust deep into his breeches pockets.  He was moving along the edge of the coverts, which lay between Mr. Langton’s bungalow and the house, when suddenly he became conscious of footsteps approaching stealthily through the woods.  Without a moment’s thought he dropped flat upon his face, and lay close as a hare, concealed in a clump of bracken.  From this position he was able to see the path by which the intruder approached; he could also command a view of the windows of Friar’s Court, several of which were illumined.  The dark figure of a man came from among the trees.  Jim, taking his whistle from his pocket, put it to his lips, and was about to sound the alarm which would bring his father and the other keepers to the spot, when he was arrested by the man’s singular appearance.  This was no common poacher.  He wore a heavy fur overcoat, and carried in his hand—not a gun—but no more formidable a weapon than an umbrella.  On his head, tilted at an angle, was a white bowler hat.  Jim Braid was in two minds what to do, and was even about to show himself to the stranger and ask his business, when the front door of the house opened, and he made out the figure of Captain von Hardenberg silhouetted against the light in the hall.  Jim had no particular desire to eavesdrop.  Still, as we know, he disliked and mistrusted the Prussian; and, besides, the secretive manner in which the stranger was careful to keep in the shadow of the trees had already aroused his suspicions.  When the man with the white hat saw von Hardenberg, he whistled softly, and went forward a little towards him.  They met a few yards from where Jim Braid was hiding.  The stranger at once held out a hand.  Von Hardenberg refused to take it.  \"I knew you’d come here,\" said he.  \"Can’t you leave me alone?\"  \"You’re four months overdue, Captain von Hardenberg,\" answered the other.  \"My interest is increasing day by day.  You owe me nearly four thousand pounds!\"  \"Well, I can’t pay,\" said von Hardenberg.  \"And there’s an end of it.\"  \"Captain von Hardenberg,\" said the man, who spoke English with a strong German accent.  \"I am sick of you.  In a word, I have found you out. You desire the services of a spy—one who has access to valuable information—and you come to me, Peter Klein, even myself, who as the butler of a cabinet minister have many opportunities of reading letters and overhearing the consultations of those who are suppose to govern these sleepy, fog-begotten islands.  You are paid from Berlin, and you are paid to pay me.  And what do you do with the money?  Gamble.  In a word, you play cards and lose money which by right is mine, which I—not you—have earned.  Then you beseech me to hold my tongue, promising me that you will repay me with interest as soon as ever you have inherited your uncle’s estates.  This, I find, is a lie.  Your uncle has another nephew, just as likely to inherit his capital as you. You play with me. But I hold you in the hollow of my hand.  Remember, I have only to report you to Berlin, and you are ruined, once and for all.\"  Von Hardenberg was silent for some moments.  Then he spoke in a quick, jerky voice.  \"Look here,\" said he; \"it’s no good.  This very evening, knowing that you were coming, I made a clean breast of it to my uncle.  I told him that I was four thousand pounds in debt to a money-lender, and that, if I couldn’t pay, you would come down upon me.  I suppose you don’t mind that.  I couldn’t tell him you were a Government spy disguised as a butler in a private house.  And what do you think he said?\"  \"I have not the least idea,\" said the other.  \"He told me,\" said von Hardenberg, \"that he would cut me off with a shilling!\"  Mr. Peter Klein was heard to gasp.  Thrusting his hat well back upon his head, he threw out his hands and gesticulated wildly.  \"Then, you’re a thief!\" he cried.  \"What it comes to is this: you have embezzled Government money.  I have given the Wilhelmstrasse valuable information, and I have never received a penny.\"  \"Do what you like,\" answered von Hardenberg.  \"I cannot pay.\"  \"I’ll have you court-martialled!\" the other cried.  \"The Wilhelmstrasse will be on my side.  You have made a fool of me.\"  Von Hardenberg grasped the man by the wrist.  \"Listen here,\" said he.  \"Can you wait a week?\"  \"Yes.  I can.  But why?\"  \"Because I know how I can get hold of the money, though it will take some getting.  You had better go back to London.  I promise to call at your office within a few days, and then I shall have something to tell you.\"  Peter Klein turned the matter over in his mind.  As long as there remained a chance of getting his money he thought it worth while to take it.  For all his threats, he knew enough of the Secret Service department in the Wilhelmstrasse in Berlin to know that in a fight against a Prussian military attaché he would stand but a poor chance. However, he was cunning enough to point out to von Hardenberg that the Wilhelmstrasse might think that the services of Peter Klein might possibly be valuable in the future.  Then, he went his way, walking quickly through the woods in the direction of the railway station.  As for von Hardenberg, he returned to the house; and no sooner was he gone than Jim Braid got to his feet.  The young gamekeeper had been able to understand only a third of what had been said, for they had lapsed from German into English, and back to German again.  But, that night—or, rather, early the following morning—when he went to bed, he thought over the matter for some time, and had half a mind to tell his father.  However, in the end he came to the"]]]
