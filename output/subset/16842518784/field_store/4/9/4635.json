THE OBSERVERS       Ere the last light that leaps the night has hung and shone and             died,       While yet the breast-high fog of dawn is swathed about the               plain,     By hedge and track our slaves go back, the waning stars for             guide,       Eyes of our mouths; the mists have cleared, the guns would               speak again!      Faint on the ears that strain to hear, their orders trickle down       \"Degrees--twelve--left of zero line--corrector one three               eight--     Three thousand.\" ... Shift our trails and lift the muzzles that         shall drown       The rifle’s idle chatter when our sendings detonate.      Sending or still, these serve our will; the hidden eyes that             mark       From gutted farm, from laddered tree that scans the furrowed               slope,     From coigns of slag whose pit-ropes sag on burrowed ways and             dark,       In open trench where sandbags hold the steady periscope.      Waking, they know the instant foe, the bullets phutting by,       The blurring lens, the sodden map, the wires that leak or               break!     Sleeping, they dream of shells that scream adown a sunless sky--       And the splinters patter round them in their dug-outs as they               wake.      Not theirs, the wet glad bayonet, the red and racing hour,       The rush that clears the bombing-post with knife and               hand-grenade;     Not theirs the zest when, steel to breast, the last survivors             cower,--       Yet can ye hold the ground ye won, save these be there to aid?      These, that observe the shell’s far swerve, these of the quiet             voice,       That bids \"go on,\" repeats the range, corrects for fuse or               line...     Though dour the task their masters ask, what room for thought or             choice?       This is ours by right of service, heedless gift of youthful               eyne!      Careless they give while yet they live; the dead we tasked too             sore       Bear witness we were naught begrudged of riches or of youth;     Careless they gave; across their grave our calling salvoes roar,       And those we maimed come back to us in proof our dead speak               truth!                                AMMUNITION COLUMN       _I am only a cog in a giant machine, a link of an endless             chain:--_     _And the rounds are drawn, and the rounds are fired,_       _and the empties return again;_     _’Railroad, lorry, and limber; battery, column, and park;_     _’To the shelf where the set fuse waits the breech, from_       _the quay where the shells embark._     We have watered and fed, and eaten our beef; the       long dull day drags by,     As I sit here watching our \"Archibalds\" _strafing_ an empty sky;     Puff and flash on the far-off blue round the speck       one guesses the plane--     Smoke and spark of the gun-machine that is fed by the endless             chain.      I am only a cog in a giant machine, a little link in the chain,     Waiting a word from the wagon-lines that the guns are hungry             again:--     _Column-wagon to battery-wagon, and battery-wagon to gun;_     _To the loader kneeling ’twixt trail and wheel from the_       _shops where the steam-lathes run._     There’s a lone mule braying against the line where       the mud cakes fetlock-deep!     There’s a lone soul humming a hint of a song in       the barn where the drivers sleep;     And I hear the pash of the orderly’s horse as he       canters him down the lane--     Another cog in the gun-machine, a link in the selfsame chain.      I am only a cog in a giant machine, but a vital link in the             chain;     And the Captain has sent from the wagon-line to       fill his wagons again;--     _From wagon-limber to gunpit dump; from loader’s forearm at             breech_     _To the working party that melts away when the shrapnel_       _bullets screech.--_     So the restless section pulls out once more in column       of route from the right,     At the tail of a blood-red afternoon; so the flux of another             night     Bears back the wagons we fill at dawn to the sleeping column             again...     Cog on cog in the gun-machine, link on link in the chain!                              THE VOICE OF THE GUNS       We are the guns, and your masters!  Saw ye our flashes?     Heard ye the scream of our shells in the night, and the       shuddering crashes?     Saw ye our work by the roadside, the gray wounded lying,     Moaning to God that he made them--the maimed and the dying?         Husbands or sons,     Fathers or lovers, we break them!  We are the guns!      We are the guns and ye serve us!  Dare ye grow weary,     Steadfast at nighttime, at noontime; or waking, when dawn       winds blow dreary     Over the fields and the flats and the reeds of the barrier             water,     To wait on the hour of our choosing, the minute decided for             slaughter?         Swift the clock runs;     Yes, to the ultimate second.  Stand to your guns!      We are the guns and we need you!  Here in the timbered     Pits that are screened by the crest and the copse       where at dusk ye unlimbered,     Pits that one found us--and, finding, gave life (did       he flinch from the giving?);     Laboured by moonlight when wraith of the dead       brooded yet o’er the living,         Ere with the sun’s     Rising the sorrowful spirit abandoned its guns.      Who but the guns shall avenge him?  Strip us for action!     Load us and lay to the centremost hair of the dial-sight’s             refraction.     Set your quick hands to our levers to compass the sped soul’s             assoiling;     Brace your taut limbs to the shock when the thrust       of the barrel recoiling         Deafens and stuns!     Vengeance is ours for our servants.  Trust ye the guns!      Least of our bond-slaves or greatest, grudge ye the burden?     Hard is this service of ours which has only our service for             guerdon:     Grow the limbs lax, and unsteady the hands, which       aforetime we trusted;     Flawed, the clear crystal of sight; and the clean       steel of hardihood rusted?         _Dominant ones,_     _Are we not tried serfs and proven--true to our guns?_      _Ye are the guns!  Are we worthy?  Shall not these speak for             us,_     _Out of the woods where the torn trees are slashed with_       _the vain bolts that seek for us,_     _Thunder of batteries firing in unison, swish of shell             flighting,_     _Hissing that rushes to silence and breaks to the thud of             alighting?_         _Death that outruns_     _Horseman and foot?  Are we justified?  Answer, O guns!_      Yea! by your works are ye justified,--toil unrelieved;     Manifold labours, coördinate each to the sending achieved;     Discipline, not of the feet but the soul, unremitting,             unfeigned;     Tortures unholy by flame and by maiming, known, faced, and             disdained;       Courage that shuns     Only foolhardiness;--even by these are ye worthy your guns!      Wherefore--and unto ye only--power has been given;     Yea! beyond man, over men, over desolate cities and riven;     Yea! beyond space, over earth and the seas and the       sky’s high dominions;     Yea! beyond time, over Hell and the fiends and       the Death-Angel’s pinions!         Vigilant ones,     Loose them, and shatter, and spare not.  We are the guns!                                     THE END                       CAMBRIDGE . MASSACHUSETTS U . S .
