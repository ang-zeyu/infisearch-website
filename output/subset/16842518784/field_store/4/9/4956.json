The Importance of Athens in Greek History.—To three ancient nations the men of the twentieth century owe an incalculable debt. To the Jews we owe most of our notions of religion; to the Romans we owe traditions and examples in law, administration, and the general management of human affairs which still keep their influence and value; and finally, to the Greeks we owe nearly all our ideas as to the fundamentals of art, literature, and philosophy, in fact, of almost the whole of our intellectual life.  These Greeks, however, our histories promptly teach us, did not form a single unified nation.  They lived in many “city-states” of more or less importance, and some of the largest of these contributed very little directly to our civilization.  Sparta, for example, has left us some noble lessons in simple living and devoted patriotism, but hardly a single great poet, and certainly never a philosopher or sculptor.  When we examine closely, we see that the civilized life of Greece, during the centuries when she was accomplishing the most, was peculiarly centered at Athens.  Without Athens, Greek history would lose three quarters of its significance, and modern life and thought would become infinitely the poorer.   2. Why the Social Life of Athens is so Significant.—Because, then, the contributions of Athens to our own life are so important, because they touch (as a Greek would say) upon almost every side of “the true, the beautiful, and the good,” it is obvious that the outward conditions under which this Athenian genius developed deserve our respectful attention.  For assuredly such personages as Sophocles, Plato, and Phidias were not isolated creatures, who developed their genius apart from, or in spite of, the life about them, but rather were the ripe products of a society, which in its excellences and weaknesses presents some of the most interesting pictures and examples in the world.  To understand the Athenian civilization and genius it is not enough to know the outward history of the times, the wars, the laws, and the lawmakers.  We must see Athens as the average man saw it and lived in it from day to day, and _then_ perhaps we can partially understand how it was that during the brief but wonderful era of Athenian freedom and prosperity[*], Athens was able to produce so many men of commanding genius as to win for her a place in the history of civilization which she can never lose.  [*] That era may be assumed to begin with the battle of Marathon (490 B.C.), and it certainly ended in 322 B.C., when Athens passed decisively under the power of Macedonia; although since the battle of Chæroneia (338 B.C.) she had done little more than keep her liberty on sufferance.   3. The Small Size and Sterility of Attica.—Attica was a very small country according to modern notions, and Athens the only large city therein.  The land barely covered some 700 square miles, with 40 square miles more, if one includes the dependent island of Salamis. It was thus far smaller than the smallest of our American “states” (Rhode Island = 1250 square miles), and was not so large as many American counties.  It was really a triangle of rocky, hill-scarred land thrust out into the Ægean Sea, as if it were a sort of continuation of the more level district of Bœotia. Yet small as it was, the hills inclosing it to the west, the seas pressing it form the northeast and south, gave it a unity and isolation all its own. Attica was not an island; but it could be invaded only by sea, or by forcing the resistance which could be offered at the steep mountain passes towards Bœotia or Megara.  Attica was thus distinctly separated from the rest of Greece.  Legends told how, when the half-savage Dorians had forced themselves southward over the mainland, they had never penetrated into Attica; and the Athenians later prided themselves upon being no colonists from afar, but upon being “earth-sprung,”—natives of the soil which they and their twenty-times grandfathers had held before them.   [Illustration:  Sketch map of Attica]   This triangle of Attica had its peculiar shortcomings and virtues. It was for the most part stony and unfertile.  Only a shallow layer of good soil covered a part of its hard foundation rock, which often in turn lay bare on the surface.  The Athenian farmer had a sturdy struggle to win a scanty crop, and about the only products he could ever raise in abundance for export were olives (which seemed to thrive on scanty soil and scanty rainfall) and honey, the work of the mountain bees.   4. The Physical Beauty of Attica.—Yet Attica had advantages which more than counterbalanced this grudging of fertility.  All Greece, to be sure, was favored by the natural beauty of its atmosphere, seas, and mountains, but Attica was perhaps the most favored portion of all, Around her coasts, rocky often and broken by pebbly beaches and little craggy peninsulas, surged the deep blue Ægean, the most glorious expanse of ocean in the world.  Far away spread the azure water[*],—often foam-crested and sometimes alive with the dolphins leaping at their play,—reaching towards a shimmering sky line where rose “the isles of Greece,” masses of green foliage, or else of tawny rock, scattered afar, to adapt the words of Homer, “like shields laid on the face of the glancing deep.”  [*] The peculiar blueness of the water near Attica is probably caused by the clear rocky bottom of the sea, as well as by the intensity of the sunlight.   Above the sea spread the noble arch of the heavens,—the atmosphere often dazzlingly bright, and carrying its glamour and sparkle almost into the hearts of men.  The Athenians were proud of the air about their land.  Their poets gladly sung its praises, as, for example, Euripides[*], when he tells how his fellow countrymen enjoy being—  Ever through air clear shining brightly As on wings uplifted, pacing lightly.   [*] Medea:829.   5. The Mountains of Attica.—The third great element, besides the sea and the atmosphere of Athens, was the mountains.  One after another the bold hills reared themselves, cutting short all the plainlands and making the farmsteads often a matter of slopes and terraces.  Against the radiant heavens these mountains stood out boldly, clearly; revealing all the little gashes and seams left from that long-forgotten day when they were flung forth from the bowels of the earth.  None of these mountains was very high:  Hymettus, the greatest, was only about 3500 feet; but rising as they often did from a close proximity to the sea, and not from a dwarfing table-land, even the lower hills uplifted themselves with proud majesty.  These hills were of innumerable tints according to their rocks, the hue of the neighboring sea, and the hour of the day.  In spring they would be clothed in verdant green, which would vanish before the summer heats, leaving them rosy brown or gray.  But whatever the fundamental tone, it was always brilliant; for the Athenians lived in a land where blue sky, blue sea, and the massive rock blent together into such a galaxy of shifting color, that, in comparison, the lighting of almost any northern or western landscape would seem feeble and tame.  The Athenians absorbed natural beauty with their native air.   6. The Sunlight in Athens.—The Athenian loved sunshine, and Helios the Sun God was gracious to his prayers.  In the Athens of to-day it is reckoned that the year averages 179 days in which the sun is not concealed by clouds one instant; and 157 days more when the sun is not hidden more than half an hour[*].  Ancient Athens was surely not more cloudy.  Nevertheless, despite this constant sunshine and a southern latitude, Athens was stricken relatively seldom with semitropical heat.  The sea was a good friend, bringing tempering breezes.  In the short winter there might be a little frost, a little snow, and a fair supply of rain.  For the rest of the year, one golden day was wont to succeed another, with the sun and the sea breeze in ever friendly rivalry.  [*] The reason for these many clear days is probably "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4716"],["title","A Day in Old Athens; a Picture of Athenian Life (#2)"],["body","when the moist west and southwest winds come in contact with the dry, heated air of the Attic plain, they are at once volatilized and dispersed, not condensed (as in northern lands); therefore the day resolves itself into brilliant sunshine.   The climate saved the Athenians from being obliged to wage a stern warfare with nature as did the northern peoples.  Their life and civilization could be one developed essentially “in the open air”; while, on the other hand, the bracing sea breeze saved them from that enervating lethargy which has ruined so many southern folk. The scanty soil forced them to struggle hard to win a living; unless they yielded to the constant beckoning of the ocean, and sought food, adventure, wealth, and a great empire across the seas.   7. The Topography of the City of Athens.—So much for the land of Attica in general; but what of the setting of the city of Athens itself?  The city lay in a plain, somewhat in the south central part of Attica, and about four miles back from the sea.  A number of mountains came together to form an irregular rectangle with the Saronic Gulf upon the south.  To the east of Athens stretched the long gnarled ridge of Hymettus, the wildest and grayest mountain in Attica, the home of bees and goatherds, and (if there be faith in pious legend) of innumerable nymphs and satyrs.  To the west ran the lower, browner mountains, Ægaleos, across which a road (the “Sacred Way”) wound through an easy pass towards Eleusis, the only sizable town in Attica, outside of Athens and its harbors.  To the rear of the plain rose a noble pyramid, less jagged than Hymettus, more lordly than Ægaleos; its summits were fretted with a white which turned to clear rose color under the sunset.  This was Pentelicus, from the veins whereof came the lustrous marble for the master sculptor.  Closer at hand, nearer the center of the plain, rose a small and very isolated hill,—Lycabettus, whose peaked summit looked down upon the roofs of Athens.  And last, but never least, about one mile southwest of Lycabettus, upreared a natural monument of much greater frame,—not a hill, but a colossal rock.  Its shape was that of an irregular oval; it was about 1000 feet long, 500 feet wide, and its level summit stood 350 feet above the plain. This steep, tawny rock, flung by the Titans, one might dream, into the midst of the Attic plain, formed one of the most famous sites in the world, for it was the Acropolis of Athens.  Its full significance, however, must be explained later.  From the Acropolis and a few lesser hills close by, the land sloped gently down towards the harbors and the Saronic Bay.   [Illustration: Sketch map of Athens]   These were the great features of the outward setting of Athens.  One might add to them the long belt of dark green olive groves winding down the westward side of the plain, where the Cephisus (which along among Attic rivulets did not run dry in summer) ran down to the sea.  There was also a shorter olive belt west of the city, where the weaker Ilissus crept, before it lost itself amid the thirsty fields.  Sea, rock, and sky, then, joined together around Athens as around almost no other city in the world.  The landscape itself was adjusted to the eye with marvelous harmony.  The colors and contours formed one glorious model for the sculptor and the painter, one perpetual inspiration for the poet.  Even if Athens had never been the seat of a famous race, she would have won fame as being situated in one of the most beautiful localities in the world.  Rightly, therefore, did its dwellers boast of their city as the “Violet-crowned” (_Iostephanos_).   8. 360 B.C.—The Year of the Visit to Athens.—This city let us visit in the days of its greatest outward glory.  We may select the year 360 B.C.  At that time Athens had recovered from the ravages of the Peloponnesian War, while the Macedonian peril had not as yet become menacing.  The great public buildings were nearly all completed.  No signs of material decadence were visible, and if Athens no longer possessed the wide naval empire of the days of Pericles, her fleets and her armies were still formidable.  The harbors were full of commerce; the philosophers were teaching their pupils in the groves and porticoes; the democratic constitution was entirely intact.  With intelligent vision we will enter the city and look about us.     Chapter II. The First Sights in Athens.   9. The Morning Crowds bound for Athens.—It is very early in the morning.  The sun has just pushed above the long ridge of Hymettus, sending a slanting red bar of light across the Attic plain, and touching the opposite slopes of Ægaleos with livid fire.  Already, however, life is stirring outside the city.  Long since, little market boats have rowed across the narrow strait from Salamis, bringing the island farmer’s produce, and other farmers from the plain and the mountain slopes have started for market.  In the ruddy light the marble temples on the lofty Acropolis rising ahead of these hurrying rustics are standing out clearly; the spear and helmet of the great brazen statue of the Athena Promachos are flashing from the noble citadel, as a kind of day beacon, beckoning onward toward the city.  From the Peiræus, the harbor town, a confused hum of mariners lading and unlading vessels is even now rising, but we cannot turn ourselves thither.  Our route is to follow the farmers bound for market.  The most direct road from the Peiræus to Athens is hidden indeed, for it leads between the towering ramparts of the “Long Walls,” two mighty barriers which run parallel almost four miles from the inland city to the harbor, giving a guarded passage in wartime and making Athens safe against starvation from any land blockade; but there is an outside road leading also to Athens from the western farmsteads, and this we can conveniently follow.  Upon this route the crowd which one meets is certainly not aristocratic, but it is none the less Athenian.  Here goes a drover, clad in skins, his legs wound with woolen bands in lieu of stockings; before him and his wolf-like dog shambles a flock of black sheep or less manageable goats, bleating and baaing as they are propelled toward market. After him there may come an unkempt, long-bearded farmer flogging on a pack ass or a mule attached to a clumsy cart with solid wheels, and laden with all kinds of market produce.  The roadway, be it said, is not good, and all carters have their troubles; therefore, there is a deal of gesticulating and profane invocation of Hermes and all other gods of traffic; for, early as it is, the market place is already filling, and every delay promises a loss.  There are still other companions bound toward the city:  countrymen bearing cages of poultry; others engaged in the uncertain calling of driving pigs; swarthy Oriental sailors, with rings in their ears, bearing bales of Phœnician goods from the Peiræus; respectable country gentlemen, walking gravely in their best white mantles and striving to avoid the mud and contamination; and perhaps also a small company of soldiers, just back from foreign service, passes, clattering shields and spear staves.   [Illustration: Peasant going to Market]   10. The Gate and the Street Scenes.—The crowds grow denser as everybody approaches the frequented “Peiræus Gate,” for nearly all of Attica which lies within easy reach of Athens has business in the Market Place every morning.  On passing the gate a fairly straight way leads through the city to the market, but progress for the multitude becomes slow.  If it is one of the main thoroughfares, it is now very likely to be almost blocked with people.  There are few late risers at Athens; the Council of Five Hundred[*], the huge Jury Courts, and the Public Assembly (if it has met to-day[+]) are appointed to gather at sunrise.  The plays in the theater, which, however, are given only on certain festivals, begin likewise at sunrise.  The philosophers say that “the man who would accomplish great things must be up while yet it is dark.”  Athenians, therefore, are always awake and stirring at an hour when men of later ages and more cold and foggy climes will be painfully yawning ere getting out of bed.  [*] The “Boule,” the great standing committee of the Athenian people to aid the magistrates in the government.   [+] In which case, of course, the regular courts and the Council would hardly meet.   [Illustration: At the Street Fountain]   The Market Place attracts the great masses, but by no means all; hither and thither bevies of sturdy slave girls, carrying graceful pitchers on their heads, are hurrying towards the fountains which gush cool water at most of the street corners.  Theirs is a highly necessary task, for few or no houses have their own water supply; and around each fountain one can see half a dozen by no means slatternly maidens, splashing and flirting the water one at another, while they wait their turn with the pitchers, and laugh and exchange banter with the passing farmers’ lads.  Many in the street crowds are rosy-cheeked schoolboys, walking decorously, if they are lads of good breeding, and blushing modestly when they are greeted by their fathers’ acquaintances.  They do not loiter on the way. Close behind, carrying their writing tablets, follow the faithful ‘pedagogues,’ the body-servants appointed to conduct them to school, give them informal instruction, and, if need be, correct their faults in no painless manner.  Besides the water maids and the schoolboys, from the innumerable house doors now opening the respective masters are stepping forth—followed by one, two, or several serving varlets, as many as their wealth affords.  All these join in the crowd entering from the country.  “Athenian democracy” always implies a goodly amount of hustling and pushing. No wonder the ways are a busy sight!   11.
