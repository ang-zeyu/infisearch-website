He found th' range nachrally, an' he cud wing anny wan iv us with th' 'Lives iv th' Saints' as far as he cud see.  He was a poor man, an' on'y had such books in his libr'y as a gintleman shud take, but if ye'd give him libr'y enough, he'd capture Giberaltor. If lithrachoor niver pinethrated me intelleck, 'twas not his fault.  But nowadays, whin I go down th' sthreet, I see th' childher settin' on th' front steps studyin' a book through double-compound-convex spectacles, lookin' like th' offspring of a profissyonal diver. What'll they iver grow up to be? Be hivins! that la-ad Carnaygie knows his business.  He is studied th' situation, an' he undhersthands that if he builds libr'ies enough an' gets enough people readin' books, they won't be anny wan left afther a while capable iv takin' away what he's got.  Ye bet he didn't larn how to make steel billets out iv 'Whin Knighthood was in Flower.' He larned it be confabulatin' afther wurrukin' hours with some wan that knew how.  I think he must be readin' now, f'r he's writin' wan or two.  'Tis th' way with a man who takes to readin' late in life.  He can't keep it down.  \"Readin', me frind, is talked about be all readin' people as though it was th' on'y thing that makes a man betther thin his neighbors. But th' thruth is that readin' is th' nex' thing this side iv goin' to bed f'r restin' th' mind.  With mos' people it takes th' place iv wurruk.  A man doesn't think whin he's readin', or if he has to, th' book is no fun.  Did ye iver have something to do that ye ought to do, but didn't want to, an' while ye was wishin' ye was dead, did ye happen to pick up a newspaper? Ye know what occurred.  Ye didn't jus' skim through th' spoortin' intillygince an' th' crime news.  Whin ye got through with thim, ye read th' other quarther iv th' pa-aper.  Ye read about people ye niver heerd iv, an' happenin's ye didn't undhersthand--th' fashion notes, th' theatrical gossip, th' s'ciety news fr'm Peoria, th' quotations on oats, th' curb market, th' rale-estate transfers, th' marredge licenses, th' death notices, th' want ads., th' dhrygoods bargains, an' even th' iditoryals.  Thin ye r-read thim over again, with a faint idee ye'd read thim befure.  Thin ye yawned, studied th' design iv th' carpet, an' settled down to wurruk.  Was ye exercisin' ye-er joynt intelleck while ye was readin'? No more thin if ye'd been whistlin' or writin' ye-er name on a pa-aper.  If anny wan else but me come along they might say: 'What a mind Hinnissy has! He's always readin'.' But I wud kick th' book or pa-aper out iv ye-er hand, an' grab ye be th' collar, an' cry 'Up, Hinnissy, an' to wurruk!' f'r I'd know ye were loafin'.  Believe me, Hinnissy, readin' is not thinkin'.  It seems like it, an' whin it comes out in talk sometimes, it sounds like it.  It's a kind iv nearthought that looks ginooine to th' thoughtless, but ye can't get annything on it.  Manny a man I've knowed has so doped himsilf with books that he'd stumble over a carpet-tack.  \"Am I again' all books, says ye? I'm not.  If I had money, I'd have all th' good lithrachoor iv th' wurruld on me table at this minyit.  I mightn't read it, but there it'd be so that anny iv me frinds cud dhrop in an' help thimsilves if they didn't care f'r other stimylants.  I have no taste f'r readin', but I won't deny it's a good thing f'r thim that's addicted to it.  In modheration, mind ye.  In modheration, an' afther th' chores is done.  F'r as a frind iv Hogan's says, 'Much readin' makes a full man,' an' he knew what he was talkin' about.  An' do I object to th' pursuit iv lithrachoor? Oh, faith, no.  As a pursuit 'tis fine, but it may be bad f'r anny wan that catches it.\"     The Law's Delays   \"If I had me job to pick out,\" said Mr. Dooley, \"I'd be a judge. I've looked over all th' others an' that's th' on'y wan that suits. I have th' judicyal timperamint.  I hate wurruk.  \"Ivrybody else is pushed an' hurrid in this tumulchuse age.  Th' business man has to get to th' bank befure it closes an' th' banker has to get there befure th' business man escapes, an' th' high-priced actor has to kill off more gradyates iv th' school iv actin' thin iver he did, an' th' night editions iv th' pa-apers comes out arlier ivry mornin'.  All is rush an' worry.  Kings an' imprors duck about their jooties like bell-hops, th' pampered son iv luxury at Newport is thryin' f'r a mile a minyit in his autymobill an' th' on'y leisure class left in th' wurruld is th' judicyary.  Mind ye, Hinnissy, I'm not sayin' annything again' thim.  I won't dhrag th' joodicyal ermine in th' mud though I haven't noticed that manny iv thim lift it immodestly whin they takes th' pollytical crossing. I have th' high rayspict f'r th' job that's th' alternative iv sixty days in jail.  Besides, me boy, I invy thim.  \"Somewhere a la-ad hits somewan on th' head with an axe or sinds him a bunch iv proosic acid done up to look like candy.  Maybe he does an' maybe he don't; but annyhow that's what he's lagged f'r. Th' polis are in a hurry to get to th' pool-room befure th' flag falls in th' first race an' they carry th' case to th' gran' jury; th' gran' jury indicts him without a thought or a suspicion iv ax har-rd feelin', th' judge takes his breakfast on th' bench to be there in time an' charges th' jury to be fair but not to f'rget th' man done it, an' th' jury rayturns a verdict iv guilty with three cheers an' a tiger.  Th' pris'ner has hardly time to grab up his hat befure he 's hauled off to his funeral obsequies, an' th' onprejudiced public feels happy about it.  I don't believe in capital punishmint, Hinnissy, but 'twill niver be abolished while th' people injye it so much.  They 're jus' squarin' thimsilves f'r th' rayvoltin' details whin wurrud comes that Judge Tamarack iv Opolis has granted a stay iv proceedin's.  Stays iv pro-ceedin's is devices, Hinnissy, be which th' high coorts keep in form.  'Tis a lagal joke.  I med it up.  Says Judge Tamarack: 'I know very little about this ease excipt what I've been tol' be th' larned counsel f'r th' dayfinse, an' I don't believe that, but I agree with Lord Coke in th' maxim that th' more haste th' less sleep. Therefore to all sheriffs, greetin': Fen jarrin' th' pris'ner till ye hear fr'm us.'  \"So th' pris'ner waits an' dhreams he 's a lightnin' rod an' th' public waits an' ivrybody waits.  Th' high coort is busy in its way.  Ivry two or three years it is discovered takin' a nap at a county seat in th' corn belt, an' it hands down a decision f'r th' defindant in a case f'r damages growin' out iv th' Shay rebillion. Then it dhrops off again.  Th' judge that thried th' case retires to a well-arned job with a railrood comp'ny, th' jury has ceased to look f'r their pitchers in th' pa-apers an' th' insurance comp'nies insure young Cyanide's life f'r the lowest known premyum. Occasionally a judge iv th' coort iv appeals walkin' in his sleep meets another judge, an' they discuss matthers.  'How ar-re ye gettin' on with th' Cyanide case, judge?' 'I'm makin' fair headway, judge.  I r-read part iv th' vardict iv th' coroner's jury las' year an' nex' month whin th' fishin' is over, I expict to look into th' indictment.  'Tis a puzzlin' case.  Th' man is not guilty.' 'Well, good bye, judge; I'll see ye in a year or two.  Lave me know how ye're gettin' on.  Pleasant dhreams!' An' so they part. Th' higher up a coort is, th' less they see iv each other.  Their office hours are fr'm a quarther to wan leap years.  Ye take a lively lawyer that's wurruked twinty hours a day suin' sthrect railrood comp'nies an' boost him onto a high coort an' he can't think out iv a hammock.  Th' more exalted what Hogan calls th' joodicyal station, th' more it's like a dormitory.  Th' years rowl by an' th' tillygraft op'rator that's been expictin' to sind a rush tillygram through young Cyanide sees his ohms an' his volts mouldin' an' no wurrud comes fr'm th' coort iv appeals but th' murmur iv th' chief justice discussin' th' nullification theery. But wan day, th' decision is wafted down.  'Th' coort finds,' it says, 'that th' vardict was conthry to th' law an' th' ividince. We seen this fr'm th' first.  It's as plain as th' nose on ye'er face.  Th' judge was prejudiced an' th' jury was ignorant.  Th' ividince wasn't sufficient to hang a cat.  We revarse th' decision an' ordher a new thrile that full justice may be done.  We cannot help remarkin' at this time on th' croolty iv subjectin' this unforchnit man to all these years iv torture an' imprisonment with a case again' him which we see at a glance durin' th' Mexican war cud not shtand th' test iv th' law.'  \"But whin th' decision is carried to th' pris'ner, th' warden says 'Who?' 'P. Cyanide,' says th' clark iv th' coort.  'He's not here,' says th' warden.  'On consultin' me books, I find a man iv that name left in th' year sivinty-wan.' 'Did he escape?' 'In a sinse. He's dead.'  \"So, Hinnissy, I'd like to be a judge iv a high coort, dhreamin' th' happy hours away.  No hurry, no sthrivin' afther immejet raysults, no sprintin', no wan hollenin' 'Dooley J. hurry up with that ne exeat,' or 'Dooley, hand down that opinyion befure th' batthry gives out.' 'Tis th' thrue life iv aise an' gintlemanly comfort.  'Tis wait till th' clouds rowl by; 'tis time was meant for slaves; 'tis a long life an' a happy wan.  Like th' Shamrock II, th' coort acts well in stays but can't run befure th' wind. A jury is f'r hangin' ivry man, but th' high coort says: 'Ye must die, but take ye'er time about it an' go out th' way ye like.' If I wanted to keep me money so that me gran'childher might get it f'r their ol' age, I'd appeal it to th' supreme coort.  Oh, th' fine judge I'd make, f'r I can sleep annywhere, an' I'm niver impatient f'r annywan to get his jooes.\"  \"I don't see,\" said Mr. Hennessy, \"why they have anny juries.  Why don't they thry ivry man before th' supreme coort an' have done with it?\"  \"I"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4729"],["title","Observations By Mr. Dooley (#2)"],["body","a betther way than that,\" said Mr. Dooley.  \"Ye see they'e wurrukin' on time now.  I wondher if they wudden't sthep livelier if they were paid be th' piece.\"     Sherlock Holmes   \"Dorsey an' Dugan are havin' throuble,\" said Mr. Hennessy.  \"What about?\" asked Mr. Dooley.  \"Dorsey,\" said Mr. Hennessy, \"says Dugan stole his dog.  They had a party at Dorsey's an' Dorsey heerd a noise in th' back yard an' wint out an' see Dugan makin' off with his bull tarryer.\"  \"Ye say he see him do it?\"  \"Yis, he see him do it.\"  \"Well,\" said Mr. Dooley, \"'twud baffle th' injinooty iv a Sherlock Holmes.\"  \"Who's Sherlock Holmes?\"  \"He's th' gr-reatest detictive that iver was in a story book. I've been r-readin' about him an' if I was a criminal, which I wud be if I had to wurruk f'r a livin', an' Sherlock Holmes got afther me, I'd go sthraight to th' station an' give mesilf up.  I'd lay th' goods on th' desk an' say: 'Sargeant, put me down in th' hard cage.  Sherlock Holmes has jus' see a man go by in a cab with a Newfoundland dog an' he knows I took th' spoons.' Ye see, he ain't th' ordh'nry fly cop like Mulcahy that always runs in th' Schmidt boy f'r ivry crime rayported fr'm stealin' a ham to forgin' a check in th' full knowledge that some day he'll get him f'r th' right thing.  No, sir; he's an injanyous man that can put two an' two together an' make eight iv thim.  He applies his brain to crime, d'ye mind, an' divvle th' crime, no matther how cunnin' it is, will escape him.  We'll suppose, Hinnissy, that I'm Sherlock Holmes. I'm settin' here in me little parlor wearin' a dhressin' gown an' now an' thin pokin' mesilf full iv morpheen.  Here we are.  Ye come in.  'Good-mornin', Watson.'\"  \"I ain't Watson,\" said Mr. Hennessy.  \"I'm Hinnissy.\"  \"Ah,\" said Mr. Dooley; \"I thought I'd wring it fr'm ye.  Perhaps ye'd like to know how I guessed ye had come in.  'Tis very simple. On'y a matther iv observation.  I heerd ye'er step; I seen ye'er refliction in th' lookin' glass; ye spoke to me.  I put these things together with me thrained faculty f'r observation an' deduction, d'ye mind.  Says I to mesilf: 'This must be Hinnissy.' But mind ye, th' chain iv circumstances is not complete.  It might be some wan disguised as ye.  So says I to mesilf: 'I will throw this newcome, whoiver he is, off his guard, be callin' him be a sthrange name!' Ye wudden't feel complimented, Hinnissy, if ye knew who Watson is.  Watson knows even less than ye do.  He don't know annything, an' annything he knows is wrong.  He has to look up his name in th' parish raygisther befure he can speak to himsilf. He's a gr-reat frind iv Sherlock Holmes an' if Sherlock Holmes iver loses him, he'll find him in th' nearest asylum f'r th' feeble-minded.  But I surprised ye'er secret out iv ye.  Thrown off ye'er guard be me innocent question, ye popped out 'I'm Hinnissy,' an' in a flash I guessed who ye were.  Be th' same process iv raisonin' be deduction, I can tell ye that ye were home las' night in bed, that ye're on ye'er way to wurruk, an' that ye'er salary is two dollars a day.  I know ye were at home las' night because ye ar-re always at home between iliven an' sivin, bar Pathrick's night, an' ye'er wife hasn't been in lookin' f'r ye.  I know ye're on ye'er way to wurruk because I heerd ye'er dinner pail jingle as ye stepped softly in.  I know ye get two dollars a day because ye tol' me ye get three an' I deducted thirty-three an' wan third per cint f'r poetic license.  'Tis very simple.  Ar-re those shoes ye have on ye'er feet? Be hivins, I thought so.\"  \"Simple,\" said Mr. Hennessy, scornfully; \"'tis foolish.\"  \"Niver mind,\" said Mr. Dooley.  \"Pass th' dope, Watson.  Now bein' full iv th' cillybrated Chow Sooey brand, I addhress me keen mind to th' discussion iv th' case iv Dorsey's dog.  Watson, look out iv th' window an' see if that's a cab goin' by ringin' a gong.  A throlley car? So much th' betther.  Me observation tol' me it was not a balloon or a comet or a reindeer.  Ye ar-re a gr-reat help to me, Watson.  Pass th' dope.  Was there a dog on th' car? No? That simplifies th' thing.  I had an idee th' dog might have gone to wurruk.  He was a bull-tarryer, ye say.  D'ye know annything about his parents? Be Mulligan's Sloppy Weather out iv O'Hannigan's Diana iv th' Slough? Iv coorse.  Was ayether iv thim seen in th' neighborhood th' night iv th' plant? No? Thin it is not, as manny might suppose, a case iv abduction.  What were th' habits iv Dorsey's coyote? Was he a dog that dhrank? Did he go out iv nights? Was he payin' anny particular attintions to anny iv th' neighbors? Was he baffled in love? Ar-re his accounts sthraight? Had Dorsey said annything to him that wud 've made him despondent? Ye say no. He led a dog's life but seemed to be happy.  Thin 'tis plainly not a case iv suicide.  \"I'm gettin' up close to th' criminals.  Another shot iv th' mad mixture.  Wait till I can find a place in th' ar-rm.  There ye ar-re.  Well, Watson, what d'ye make iv it?\"  \"If ye mane me, Dugan stole th' dog.\"  \"Not so fast,\" said Mr. Dooley.  \"Like all men iv small minds ye make ye'ers up readily.  Th' smaller th' mind, th' aisier 'tis made up.  Ye'ers is like a blanket on th' flure befure th' fire. All ye have to do to make it up is to lave it.  Mine is like a large double bed, an' afther I've been tossin' in it, 'tis no aisy job to make it up.  I will puncture me tire with th' fav'rite flower iv Chinnytown an' go on.  We know now that th' dog did not elope, that he didn't commit suicide an' that he was not kidnaped be his rayturnin' parents.  So far so good.  Now I'll tell ye who stole th' dog.  Yisterdah afthernoon I see a suspicious lookin' man goin' down th' sthreet.  I say he was suspicious lookin' because he was not disguised an' looked ivry wan in th' face.  He had no dog with him.  A damning circumstance, Watson, because whin he'd stolen th' dog he niver wud 've taken it down near Dorsey's house. Ye wudden't notice these facts because ye'er mind while feeble is unthrained.  His coat collar was turned up an' he was whistlin' to himsilf, a habit iv dog fanciers.  As he wint be Hogan's house he did not look around or change his gait or otherwise do annything that wud indicate to an unthrained mind that there was annything wrong, facts in thimsilves that proved to me cultivated intilligence that he was guilty.  I followed him in me mind's eye to his home an' there chained to th' bed leg is Dorsey's dog.  Th' name iv th' criminal is P. X. O'Hannigan, an' he lives at twinty-wan hundhred an' ninety-nine South Halsted sthreet, top flat, rear, a plumber be pro-fission.  Officer, arrest that man!  \"That's all right,\" said Mr. Hennessy; \"but Dugan rayturned th' dog las' night.\"  \"Oh, thin,\" said Mr. Dooley, calmly, \"this is not a case f'r Sherlock Holmes but wan f'r th' polis.  That's th' throuble, Hinnissy, with th' detictive iv th' story.  Nawthin' happens in rale life that's complicated enough f'r him.  If th' Prisidint iv th' Epworth League was a safe-blower be night th' man that'd catch him'd be a la-ad with gr-reat powers iv observation an' thrained habits iv raisonin'.  But crime, Hinnissy, is a pursoot iv th' simple minded--that is, catchable crime is a pursoot iv th' simple-minded.  Th' other kind, th' uncatchable kind that is took up be men iv intellict is called high fi-nance.  I've known manny criminals in me time, an' some iv thim was fine men an' very happy in their home life, an' a more simple, pasth'ral people ye niver knew.  Wan iv th' ablest bank robbers in th' counthry used to live near me--he ownded a flat buildin'--an' befure he'd turn in to bed afther rayturnin' fr'm his night's wurruk, he'd go out in th' shed an' chop th' wood.  He always wint into th' house through a thransom f'r fear iv wakin' his wife who was a delicate woman an' a shop lifter.  As I tell ye he was a man without guile, an' he wint about his jooties as modestly as ye go about ye'ers.  I don't think in th' long run he made much more thin ye do.  Wanst in a while, he'd get hold iv a good bunch iv money, but manny other times afther dhrillin' all night through a steel dure, all he'd find 'd be a short crisp note fr'm th' prisidint iv th' bank.  He was often discouraged, an' he tol' me wanst if he had an income iv forty dollars th' month, he'd retire fr'm business an' settle down on a farm.  \"No, sir, criminals is th' simplest crathers in th' wide wide wurruld--innocent, sthraight-forward, dangerous people, that haven't sinse enough to be honest or prosperous.  Th' extint iv their schamin' is to break a lock on a dure or sweep a handful iv change fr'm a counter or dhrill a hole in a safe or administher th' strong short arm to a tired man takin' home his load.  There are no mysteryous crimes excipt thim that happens to be.  Th' ordh'nry crook, Hinnissy, goes around ringin' a bell an' disthributin' hand-bills announcin' his business.  He always breaks through a window instead iv goin' through an open dure, an' afther he's done annything that he thinks is commindable, he goes to a neighborin' liquor saloon, stands on th' pool table an' confides th' secret to ivrybody within sound iv his voice.  That's why Mulligan is a betther detictive thin Sherlock Holmes or me.  He can't put two an' two together an' he has no powers iv deduction, but he's a hard dhrinker an' a fine sleuth.  Sherlock Holmes niver wud've caught that frind iv mine.  Whin th' safe iv th' Ninth Rational Bank was blowed, he wud've put two an' two together an' arristed me.  But me frind wint away lavin' a hat an' a pair iv cuffs marked with his name in th' safe, an' th' polis combined these discoveries with th' well-known fact that Muggins was a notoryous safe blower an' they took him in.  They found him down th' sthreet thryin' to sell a bushel basket full iv Alley L stock.  I told ye he was a simple man.  He ralized his ambition f'r an agaracoolchral life. They give him th' care iv th' cows at Joliet.\"  \"Did he rayform?\""]]]
