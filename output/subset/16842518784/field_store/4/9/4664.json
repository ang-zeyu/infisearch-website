Or is it the fashion where you come from?\" She gave him no opportunity to answer, but added, after a moment of indecision, \"Well, you look respectable enough, though much like my rascally cousin Pieter Vanderkamp. Do you know him?\"_  _\"No.\"_  _\"Well, no matter. He's much older than you--near forty blessed years. You're no more than twenty, I don't doubt.\"_  _Involuntarily Vanderkamp put his hand to his cheek, and smiled as he felt its smooth roundness. \"You may be right, at that,\" he said cryptically._  _\"You might as well come in,\" she said grudgingly. \"What with the traffic on the road outside, the Indians, and people who come in such flighty vehicles as yours, I might as well live in the heart of the colony.\"_  _He looked around. \"And still,\" he said, \"it is a pleasant spot--peaceful, comfortable. I'm sure a man could live out his days here in contentment.\"_  _\"Oh, could he?\" she said belligerently. \"And where would I be while this went on?\"_  _He gazed at her beetling nose, her jutting chin. \"A good question,\" he muttered thoughtfully._  _He followed her into the house. It was a treasury of antiquities, filling him with delight. Miss Anna Van Tromp offered him a cup of milk, which he accepted, thanking her profusely. She talked volubly, eyeing him all the while with the utmost curiosity, and he gathered presently that her father had made several attempts to marry her off, disapproving of her solitary residence so far from the center of the city; but she had frowned upon one and all of the suitors he had encouraged to call on her. She was undeniably impressive, almost formidable, he conceded privately, with a touch of the shrew and harridan. Life with Miss Anna Van Tromp would not be easy, he reflected. But then, life with his sister Julie was not easy, either. Miss Anna, however, had not to face atomic warfare; all she had to look forward to in fourteen years was surrender to the besieging British, which she would have no trouble in surviving._  _He settled down to his ingratiating best and succeeded in making a most favorable impression on Miss Anna Van Tromp before at last he took his leave, carrying with him a fine, hand-wrought bowl with which the lady had presented him. He had a hunch he might come back. Of all the times he had visited since finishing the machine, he knew that old New Amsterdam in the 1650s was the one period most likely to keep him contented--provided Miss Van Tromp didn't turn out to be a nuisance. So he took careful note of the set of his controls, jotting them down so that he would not be likely to forget them._  _It was late when he found himself back in his own time._  _His sister was waiting up for him. \"Two o'clock in the morning!\" she screamed at him. \"What are you doing to me? Oh, God, why didn't I marry when I had the chance, instead of throwing away my life on a worthless brother!\"_  _\"Why don't you? It's not too late,\" he sighed wearily._  _\"How can you say that?\" she snapped bitterly. \"Here I am thirty nearly, and worn out from working for you. Who would marry me now? Oh, if only I could have another chance! If I could be young again, and do it all over, I'd know how to have a better life!\"_  _In spite of his boredom with her, Vanderkamp felt the effect of this cry from a lonely heart. He looked at her pityingly; it was true, after all, that she had worked faithfully for him, without pay, since their parents died. \"Take a look at this,\" he said gently, offering her the bowl._  _\"Hah! Can we eat bowls?\"_  _He raised his eyes heavenward and went wearily to bed._         *       *       *       *       *  \"I saw Vanderkamp again about a fortnight later,\" Harrigan went on. \"Ran into him in a tavern on the Bowery. He recognized me and came over.  \"'That was some story you did,' he said.  \"'Been bothered by cranks?' I asked.  \"'Hell, yes! Not too badly, though. They want to ride off somewhere just to get away. I get that feeling myself sometimes. But, tell me, have you seen the morning papers?'  \"Now, by coincidence, the papers that morning had carried a story from some local nuclear physicist about the increasing probability that the atom would be smashed. I told him I'd seen it.  \"'What did I tell you?' he said.  \"I just smiled and asked where he'd been lately. He didn't hesitate to talk, perhaps because his sister had been giving him a hard time with her nagging. So I listened. It appeared, to hear him tell it, that he had been off visiting the Dutch in New Amsterdam. You could almost believe what he said, listening to him, except for that wild look he had. Anyway, he'd been in New Amsterdam about 1650, and he'd brought back a few trifling souvenirs of the trips. Would I like to see them? I said I would.  \"I figured he'd got his hands on some nice antiques and wanted an appreciative audience. His sister wasn't home; so he took me around and showed me his pieces, one by one--a bowl, a pair of wooden candlesticks, wooden shoes, and more, all in all a fine collection. He even had a chair that looked pretty authentic, and I wondered where he'd dug up so many nice things of the New Amsterdam period--though, of course, I had to take his word as to where they belonged historically; I didn't know. But I imagine he got them somewhere in the city or perhaps up in the Catskill country.  \"Well, after a while I got another look at his contraption. It didn't appear to have been moved at all; it was still sitting where it had been before, without a sign to say that it had been used to go anywhere, least of all into past time.  \"'Tell me,' I said to him at last, 'when you go back in time do you get younger?'  \"'Yes and no,' he said. 'Obviously.'  \"It wasn't obvious to me, but I couldn't get any more than that out of him. The thing I couldn't figure out was the reason for his claim. He wasn't trying to sell anything to anybody, as far as I could see; he wasn't anxious to tell the world about his time-machine, either. He didn't mind talking in his oblique fashion about his trips. He did talk about New Amsterdam as if he had a pretty good acquaintance with the place. But then, he was known as a minor authority on the customs of the Dutch colony.  \"He was touched, obviously. Just the same, he challenged me, in a way. I wanted to know something more about him, how his machine worked, how he took off, and so on. I made up my mind the next time I was in the neighborhood to look him up, hoping he wouldn't be home.  \"When I made it, his sister was alone, and in fine fettle, as cantankerous as a flea-bitten mastiff.  \"'He's gone again,' she complained bitterly.  \"Clearly the two of them were at odds. I asked her whether she had seen him go. She hadn't; he had just marched out to his shop and that was an end to him as far as she was concerned.  \"I haggled around quite a lot and finally got her permission to go out and see what I could see for myself. Of course, the shop was locked. I had counted on that and had brought along a handy little skeleton key. I was inside in no time. The machine wasn't there. Not a sign of it, or of Vanderkamp either.  \"Now, I looked around all over, but I couldn't for the life of me figure out how he could have taken it out of that place; it was too big for doors or windows, and the walls and roof were solid and immovable. I figured that he couldn't have got such a large machine away without his sister's seeing him; so I locked the place up and went back to the house.  \"But she was immovable; she hadn't seen a thing. If he had taken anything larger than pocket-size out of that shop of his, she had missed it. I could hardly doubt her sincerity. There was nothing to be had from that source; so I had no alternative but to wait for him another time.\"         *       *       *       *       *  _Anna Van Tromp, considerably chastened, watched her strange suitor--she looked upon all men as suitors, without exception; for so her father had conditioned her to do--as he reached into his sack and brought out another wonder._  _\"Now this,\" said Vanderkamp, \"is an alarm clock. You wind it up like this, you see; set it, and off it goes. Listen to it ring! That will wake you up in the morning.\"_  _\"More magic,\" she cried doubtfully._  _\"No, no,\" he explained patiently. \"It is an everyday thing in my country. Perhaps some day you would like to join me in a little visit there, Anna?\"_  _\"Ja, maybe,\" she agreed, looking out the window to his weird and frightening carriage, which had no animal to draw it and which vanished so strangely, fading away into the air, whenever Vanderkamp went into it. \"This clothes-washing machine you talk about,\" she admitted. \"This I would like to see.\"_  _\"I must go now,\" said Vanderkamp, gazing at her with well-simulated coyness. \"I'll leave these things here with you, and I'll just take along that bench over there.\"_  _\"Ja, ja,\" said Anna, blushing._  _\"Six of one and half a dozen of the other,\" muttered Vanderkamp, comparing Anna with his sister._  _He got into his time-machine and set out for home in the twentieth century. There was some reluctance in his going. Here all was somnolent peace and quiet, despite the rigors of living; in his own time there were wars and turmoil and the ultimate threat of the greatest war of all. New Amsterdam had one drawback, however--the presence of Anna Von Tromp. She had grown fond of him, undeniably, perhaps because he was so much more interested in her circumstances than in herself. What was a man to do? Julie at one end, Anna at the other. But even getting rid of Julie would not allow him to escape the warfare to come._  _He thought deeply of his problem all the way home._"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/40953"],["title","A Traveler in Time (#2)"],["body","he got back, he found his sister waiting up, as usual, ready to deliver the customary diatribe._  _He forestalled her. \"I've been thinking things over, Julie. I believe you'd be much happier if you were living with brother Carl. I'll give you as much money as you need, and you can pack your things and I'll take you down to Louisiana.\"_  _\"Take me!\" she exclaimed. \"How? In that crazy contraption of yours?\"_  _\"Precisely.\"_  _\"Oh no!\" she said. \"You don't get me into that machine! How do I know what it will do to me? It's a time machine, isn't it? It might make an old hag of me--or a baby!\"_  _\"You said that you wanted to be young again, didn't you?\" he said softly. \"You said you'd like another chance....\"_  _A faraway look came into her eyes. \"Oh, if I only could! If I only could be a girl again, with a chance to get married....\"_  _\"Pack your things,\" Vanderkamp said quietly._         *       *       *       *       *  \"It must have been all of a month before I saw Vanderkamp again,\" Harrigan continued, waving for another scotch and soda. \"I was down in the vicinity on an assignment and I took a run over to his place.  \"He was home this time. He came to the door, which he had chained on the inside. He recognized me, and it was plain at the same time that he had no intention of letting me in.  \"I came right out with the first question I had in mind. 'The thing that bothers me,' I said to him, 'is how you get that time machine of yours in and out of that shed.'  \"'Mr. Harrigan,' he answered, 'newspaper reporters ought to have at least elementary scientific knowledge. You don't. How in hell could even a time machine be in two places at once, I ask you? If I take that machine back three centuries, that's where it is--not here. And three centuries ago that shop wasn't standing there. So you don't go in or out; you don't move at all, remember? It's time that moves.'  \"'I called the other day,' I went on. 'Your sister spoke to me. Give her my regards.'  \"'My sister's left me,' he said shortly, 'to stew, as you might say, in my own time machine.'  \"'Really?' I said. 'Just what do you have in mind to do next?'  \"'Let me ask _you_ something, Mr. Harrigan,' he answered. 'Would you sit around here waiting for an atomic war if you could get away?'  \"'Certainly not,' I answered.  \"'Well, then, I don't intend to, either.'  \"All this while he was standing at the door, refusing to open it any wider or to let me in. He was making it pretty plain that there wasn't much he had to say to me. And he seemed to be in a hurry.  \"'Remember me to the inquiring public thirty years hence, Mr. Harrigan,' he said at last, and closed the door.  \"That was the last I saw of him.\"  Harrigan finished his scotch and soda appreciatively and looked around for the bartender.  \"Did he take off then?\" I asked.  \"Like a rocket,\" said Harrigan. \"Queerest thing was that there wasn't a trace of him. The machine was gone, too--the same way as the last time, without a disturbance in the shop. He and his machine had simply vanished off the face of the earth and were never heard from again.  \"Matter of fact, though,\" Harrigan went on thoughtfully, \"Vanderkamp's disappearance wasn't the really queer angle on the pitch. The other thing broke in the papers the week after he left. The neighbors got pretty worked up about it. They called the police to tell them that Vanderkamp's sister Julie was back, only she was off her nut--and a good deal changed in appearance, too.  \"Gal going blarmy was no news, of course, but that last bit about her appearance--they said she looked about twenty years older, all of a sudden--sort of rang a bell. So I went over there. It was Julie, all right; at least, she looked a hell of a lot like Julie had when I last saw her--provided you could grant that a woman could age twenty years in the few weeks it had been. And she was off her rocker, sure enough--or hysterical. Or at least madder than a wet hen. She made out like she couldn't speak a word of English, and they finally had to get an interpreter to understand her. She wouldn't speak anything but Dutch--and an old-fashioned kind, too.  \"She made a lot of extravagant claims and kept insisting that she would bring the whole matter up in a complaint before Governor Stuyvesant. Said she wasn't Julie Vanderkamp, by God, but was named Anna Van Tromp--which is an old Dutch name thereabouts--and claimed that she had been abducted from her home on the Bowery. We pointed out the Third Avenue El and told her _that_ was the Bowery, but she just sniffed and looked at us as though _we_ were crazy.\"  I toyed with my drink. \"You mean you actually listened to the poor girl's story?\" I asked.  \"Sure,\" Harrigan said. \"Maybe she was as crazy as a bedbug, but I've listened to whackier stories from supposedly sane people. Sure, I listened to her.\" He paused thoughtfully for a moment, then went on.  \"She claimed that this fellow Vanderkamp had come to her house and filled her with a lot of guff about the wonderful country he lived in, and how she ought to let him take her to see it. Apparently he waxed especially eloquent about an automatic washing-machine and dryer, and that had fascinated her, for some reason. Then, she said, he'd brought a ten-year-old girl along--though where in the world old Vanderkamp could have picked up a tot like that is beyond me--and the kid had added her blandishments to the plot. Between them, they had managed to lure her into the old guy's machine. From what she said, it was obviously the time machine she was talking about, and if she was Julie there was no reason why she shouldn't know about it. But she talked as though it was a complete mystery to her, as though she'd no idea what the purpose of it was. Well, anyway, here she was--and very unhappy, too. Wanted to go back to old New Amsterdam, but bad.  \"It was a beautiful act, even if she was nuts. The strange thing was, though, that there were some things even a gal going whacky couldn't explain. For instance, the house was filled with what the experts said were priceless antiques from Dutch New Amsterdam, of the period just prior to the British siege. You'd think those things would make poor Julie feel more at home, seeing as she claimed to belong in that period, but apparently they just made her homesick. And, curiously enough, all the modern gadgets were gone. All those handy little items that make the twentieth century so livable had been taken away--including the washing-machine and dryer, by the way. Julie--or Anna, as she called herself--claimed that Vanderkamp had taken it back with him, wherever he'd gone to, after he'd brought her there.\"  \"Poor woman,\" I said sympathetically. \"They toted her off to the booby hatch, I suppose.\"  \"No....\" Harrigan said slowly. \"They didn't, as a matter of fact. Since she was harmless, they let her stay in the house a while. Which was a mistake, it seems. Of course, she _wasn't_ from the seventeenth century. That's impossible. All the same--.\" He broke off abruptly and stared moodily into his glass.  \"What happened to her?\" I asked.  \"She was found one morning about two weeks after she got there,\" he said. \"Dead. Electrocuted. It seems she'd stuck her finger into a light socket while standing in a bathtub full of water. An accident, obviously. As the Medical Examiner said, it was an accident any six-year-old child would have known enough about electricity to avoid.  \"That is,\" Harrigan added, \"a _twentieth-century_ child....\""]]]
