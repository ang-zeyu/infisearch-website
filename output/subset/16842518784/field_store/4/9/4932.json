She was a good deal overcome and agitated, and quite implored Hester never to use the knowledge against her father; but she must have been always a passive, docile being, and they made her tell all that was wanted, and sign her deposition, as she had signed her will, as Faith Trevor, commonly known as Faith Dayman.  She did not live many days after.  It was on the 3rd of February, 1836, that she died; and in the course of the summer Hester had a son, who throve as none of her babies had done.  Then she lay and brooded over him and the rights she fancied he was deprived of, till she worked herself up to a strong and fixed purpose, and insisted upon making all known to her father.  Now that her mother was gone she persuaded herself that he had been a cruel, faithless tyrant, who had wilfully deserted his young wife.  Joel Lea would not listen to her.  Why should she wish to make his son a good-for-nothing English lord?  That was his view.  Nothing but misery, distress, and temptation could come of not letting things alone.  He held to that, and there were no means forthcoming either of coming to England to present herself.  The family were well to do, but had no ready money to lay out on a passage across the Atlantic. Nor would Hester wait.  She had persuaded herself that a letter would be suppressed, even if she had known how to address it; but to claim her son's rights, and make an earl of him, had become her fixed idea, and she began laying aside every farthing in her power.  In this she was encouraged, not by the lawyer who had made the will--and who, considering that poor Faith's witnesses had been destroyed, and her certificate and her wedding ring taken from her by the Indians, thought that the marriage could not be substantiated--but by a clever young clerk, who had managed to find out the state of things; a man named Perrault, who used to come to the farm, always when Lea was out, and talk her into a further state of excitement about her child's expectations, and the injuries she was suffering. It was her one idea.  She says she really believes she should have gone mad if the saving had not occupied her; and a very dreary life poor Joel must have had whilst she was scraping together the passage-money.  He still steadily and sternly disapproved the whole, and when at two years' end she had put together enough to bring her and her boy home, and maintain them there for a few weeks, he still refused to go with her.  The last thing he said was, \"Remember, Hester, what was the price of all the kingdoms of the world!  Thou wilt have it, then!  Would that I could say, my blessing go with thee.\"  And he took his child, and held him long in his arms, and never spoke one word over him but, \"My poor boy!\"     CHAPTER II.  TREVORSHAM   I suppose I had better tell what we had been doing all this time. Adela and I had come out, and had a season or two in London, and my father had enjoyed our pleasure in it, and paid a good deal of court to our pretty Adela, because there was no driving Torwood into anything warmer than easy brotherly companionship.  In fact, Torwood had never cared for anyone but little Emily Deerhurst. Once he had come to her rescue, when she was only nine or ten years old, and her schoolboy cousins were teasing her, and at every Twelfth-day party since she and he had come together as by right. There was something irresistible in her great soft plaintive brown eyes, though she was scarcely pretty otherwise, and we used to call her the White Doe of Rylstone.  Torwood was six or seven years older, and no one supposed that he seriously cared for her, till she was sixteen. Then, when my father spoke point blank to him about Adela, he was driven into owning what he wished.  My father thought it utter absurdity.  The connection was not pleasant to him; Mrs. Deerhurst was always looked on as a designing widow, who managed to marry off her daughters cleverly, and he could believe no good of Emily.  Now Adela always had more power with papa than any of us.  She had a coaxing way, which his stately old-school courtesy never could resist. She used when we were children to beg for holidays, and get treats for us; and even now, many a request which we should never have dared to utter, she could, with her droll arch way, make him think the most sensible thing in the world.  What odd things people can do who have lived together like brothers and sisters!  I can hardly help laughing when I think of Torwood coming disconsolately up from the library, and replying, in answer to our vigorous demands, that his lordship had some besotted notion past all reason.  Then we pressed him harder--Adela with indignation, and I with sympathy--till we forced out of him that he had been forbidden ever to think or speak again of Emily, and all his faith in her laughed to scorn, as delusions induced by Mrs. Deerhurst.  \"I'm sure I hope you'll take Ormerod, Adela,\" I remember he ended; \"then at least you would be out of the way.\"  For Sir John Ormerod's courtship was an evident fact to all the family, as, indeed, Adela was heiress enough to be a good deal troubled with suitors, though she had hitherto managed to make them all keep their distance.  Adela laughed at him for his kind wishes, but I could see she meant to plead for him.  She had her chance, for Sir John Ormerod brought matters to a crisis at the next ball; and though she thought, as she said, \"she had settled him,\" he followed it up with her guardian, and Adela was invited to a conference in the library.  It happened that as she ran upstairs, all in a glow, she came on Torwood at the landing.  She couldn't help saying in her odd half-laughing, half-crying voice--  \"It will come right, Torwood; I've made terms, I'm out of your way.\"  \"Not Ormerod!\" he exclaimed.  \"Oh! no, no!\"  I can hear her dash of scorn now, for I was just behind my brother, but she went on out of breath--  \"You may go on seeing her, provided you don't say a word--till--till she's been out two years.\"  \"Adela! you queen of girls, how have you done it?\" he began, but she thrust him aside and flew up into my arms; and when I had her in her own room it came out, I hardly know how, that she had so shown that she cared for no one she had ever seen except my father, that they found they _did_ love each other; and--and--in short they were going to be married.  Really it seemed much less wonderful then than it does in thinking of it afterwards.  My father was much handsomer than any young man I ever saw, with a hawk nose, a clear rosy skin, pure pink and white like a boy's, curly little rings of white hair, blue eyes clear and bright as the sky, a tall upright soldierly figure, and a magnificent stately bearing, courteous and grand to all, but sweetly tender to a very few, and to her above all.  It always had been so ever since he had brought her home an orphan of six years old from her mother's death-bed at Nice.  And he was youthful, could ride or hunt all day without so much fatigue as either of his sons, and was as fresh and eager in all his ways as a lad.  And she, our pretty darling!  I don't think Torwood and I in the least felt the incongruity of her becoming our step-mother, only that papa was making her more entirely his own.  I am glad we did not mar the sunshine.  It did not last long.  She came home thoroughly unwell from their journey to Switzerland, and never got better.  By the time the spring had come round again, she was lying in the vault at Trevorsham, and we were trying to keep poor little Alured alive and help my poor father to bear it.  He was stricken to the very heart, and never was the same man again. His age seemed to come upon him all at once; and whereas at sixty-five he had been like a man ten years younger, he suddenly became like one ten years older; and though he never was actually ill, he failed from month to month.  He could not bear the sight or sound of the poor baby.  Poor Adela had scarcely lived to hear it was a boy, and all she had said about it was, \"Ursula, you'll be his mother.\"  And, oh! I have tried.  If love would do it, I think he could not be more even to dear Adela!  What a frail little life it was!  What nights and days we had with him; doctors saying that skill could not do it, but care might; and nurses knowing how to be more effective than I could be; yet while I durst not touch him I could not bear not to see him.  And I do think I was the first person he began to know.  Meantime, there was a great difference in Torwood.  He had been very much of a big boy hitherto.  No one but myself could have guessed that he cared for much besides a lazy kind of enjoyment of all the best and nicest things in this world.  He did what he was told, but in an uninterested sort of way, just as if politics and county business, and work at the estate, were just as much tasks thrust on him as Virgil and Homer had been; and put his spirit into sporting, &c.  But when he was allowed to think hopefully of Emily, it seemed to make a man of him, and he took up all that he had to do, as if it really concerned him, and was not only a burden laid on him by his father.  And, as my father became less able to exert himself, Torwood came forward more, and was something substantial to lean upon.  Dear fellow! I am sure he did well earn the consent he gained at last, though not with much satisfaction, from papa.  Emily had grown into great sweetness and grace, and Mrs. Deerhurst had gone on very well.  Of course, people were unkind enough to say, it was only because she had such prey in view as Lord Torwood; but, whatever withheld her, it is certain that Emily only had the most suitable and reasonable pleasures for a young lady, and was altogether as nice, and gentle, and sensible, as could be desired. There never was a bit of acting in her,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4659"],["title","Lady Hester; Or, Ursula's Narrative (#2)"],["body","was only allowed to grow in what seemed natural to her.  She was just one of the nice simple girls of that day, doing her quiet bit of solid reading, and her practice, and her neat little smooth pencil drawing from a print, as a kind of duty to her accomplishments every day; and filling books with neat up-and-down MS. copies of all the poetry that pleased her. Dainty in all her ways, timid, submissive, and as it seemed to me, colourless.  But Fulk taught her Wordsworth, who was his great passion then, and found her a perfect listener to all his Tory hopes, fears, and usages.  Papa could not help liking her when she came to stay with us, after they were engaged, at the end of two years.  He allowed that, away from her mother and all her belongings, she would do very well; and she was so pretty and sweet in her respectful fear of him--I might almost say awe--that his graceful, chivalrous courtesy woke up again; and he was beginning absolutely to enjoy her, as she became a little more confident and understood him better.  How well I remember that last evening!  I was happier than I had been for weeks about little Alured: the convulsions had quite gone off, the teeth that had caused them were through, and he had been laughing and playing on my lap quite brightly--cooing to his mother's miniature in my locket.  He was such an intelligent little fellow for eighteen months!  I came down so glad, and it was so pleasant to see Emily, in her white dress, leaning over my father while he had gone so happily into his old delight of showing his prints and engravings; and Torwood, standing by the fire, watching them with the look of a conqueror, and Jaquetta--like the absurd child she loved to be--teasing them with ridiculous questions about their housekeeping.  They were to have Spinney Lawn bought for them, just a mile away, and the business was in hand.  Jacquey was enquiring whether there was a parlour for The Cid, Torwood's hunter, whom she declared was as dear to him as Emily herself.  Indeed, Emily did go out every morning after breakfast to feed him with bread.  I can see her now on Torwood's arm, with big Rollo and little Malta rolling over one another after them.  Then came an afternoon when we had all walked to Spinney Lawn, laid out the gardens together, and wandered about the empty rooms, planning for them.  The birds were singing in the March sunshine, and the tomtits were calling \"peter\" in the trees, and Jaquetta went racing about after the dogs, like a thing of seven years old, instead of seventeen.  And Torwood was cutting out a root of primroses, leaves and all, for Emily, when we saw a fly go along the lane, and wondered, with a sort of idle wonder.  We supposed it must be visitors for the parsonage, and so we strolled home, looking for violets by the way, and Jaquetta getting shiny studs of celandine. Ah! I remember those glistening stars were all closed before we came back.  Well, it must come, so it is silly to linger!  There stood the fly at the hall-door, and the butler met us, saying--  \"There's a person with his lordship, my lord.  She would not wait till you came in, though I told her he saw no one on business without you--\"  Torwood hastened on before this, expecting to see some importunate person bothering my father with a petition.  What he did see was my father leaning back in his chair, with a white, confounded, bewildered look, and a woman, with a child on her lap, opposite.  Her back was to the door, and Torwood's first impression was that she was a well-dressed impostor threatening him; so he came quickly to my father's side, and said--  \"What is it father?  I'm here.\"  My poor father put out his hand feebly to him, and said--  \"It is all true, Torwood.  God forgive me; I did not know it!\"  \"Know what?\" he asked anxiously.  \"What is it that distresses you, father?  Let me speak to this person--\"  Then she broke out--not loud, not coarsely, but very determinately--\"No, sir; you would be very glad to suppress me, and my child, and my evidence, no doubt; but the Earl of Trevorsham has acknowledged the truth of my claim, and I will not leave this spot till he has acknowledged my mother as his only lawful wife, and my child, Trevor Lea, as his only lawful heir!\"  Torwood thought her insane and only said quietly, as he offered my father his arm, \"I will talk it over with you presently; Lord Trevorsham is not equal to discuss it now.\"  \"I see what you mean!\" she said quickly.  \"You would like to make me out crazy, but Lord Trevorsham knows better.  Do not you, my father?\" she said, with a strong emphasis, the more marked, because it was concentrated, not loud.  My poor father was shuddering all over with involuntary trembling; but he put Torwood's hand away from him, and looked up piteously, as if his heart was breaking (as it was); but he spoke steadily.  \"It is true. It is true, Torwood.  I was married to poor Faith, when I was a young man, in Canada.  They sent me proofs that all had perished when the Indians attacked the village; but--\" and then he put his hands over his face.  It must have been dreadful to see; but Hester Lea was too much bent on her rights to feel a moment's pity; and she spoke on in a hard tone, with her eyes fixed on my brother's face.  \"But you failed to discover that she was rescued from the Indians; gave birth to me, your daughter, Hester; and only died two years ago.\"  \"You hear!  My boy, my poor boy, forgive me; don't leave me to her,\" was what my poor father had said--he who had been so strong.  My brother saw what it all meant now.  \"Never fear that, sir,\" he said; \"I am your son still, any way, you know.\"  \"You will do justice to me,\" she began, in her fierce tone; but my brother met it calmly with, \"Certainly, we will do our best that justice should be done.  You have brought proof?\"  His quietness overawed her, and she pointed to the papers on the table. They were her mother's attested narrative, and the certificate of her burial.  My brother read aloud, \"The 3rd of February, 1836,\" then he turned to my father and said, \"You observe, father, the difference this may make, if true, is that of putting little Alured into the place I have held. My father's last marriage was on the 15th of April, 1836,\" he added to her.  He says she quite glared at him with mortification, as if he had invented poor little Alured on purpose to baffle her; but my father breathed more freely.  \"And is nothing--nothing to be done for my child, your own grandson?\" exclaimed she, \"after these years.\"  Torwood silenced her by one of his looks.  \"We only wish to do justice,\" he said. \"If it be as you say, you will have a right to a great deal, and it will not be disputed; but you must be aware that a claim made in this manner requires investigation, and you can see that my father is not in a state for an exciting discussion.\"  \"_Your_ father!\" she said, with a bitter tone of scorn; but he took it firmly, though the blood seemed to come boiling to his temples.  \"Yes,\" he said, \"my father! and if you are indeed his daughter, you should show some pity and filial duty, by not forcing the discussion on him while he can so little bear it.\"  That staggered her a little, but she said, \"I do not wish to do him any harm, but I have my child's interests to think of.  How do I know what advantage may be taken against him?\"  Torwood saw my father lying back in the chair, trembling, and he dreaded a fit every moment.  \"I give you my word,\" he said, \"that no injustice shall be done you;\" and as she looked keenly at him, as if she distrusted him, he said, \"Yes, you may trust me.  I was bred an English gentleman, whatever I was born, and I promise you never to come between you and your rights, when your identity as Lord Trevorsham's daughter is fully established. Meantime, do you not see that your presence is killing him?  Tell me where you may be heard of?\"  \"I shall stay at the Shinglebay Hotel till I am secure of the justice I claim,\" she said.  \"Come, my boy, since your own grandfather will not so much as look at you.\"  Torwood walked her across the hall.  He was a little touched by those last words, and felt that she might have looked for a daughter's reception, so he said in the hall--  \"You must remember this is a very sudden shock to us all.  When my father has grown accustomed to the idea, no doubt he will wish to see you again; but in his present state of health, he must be our first consideration.  And unprepared as my sisters are, it would be impossible to ask you to stay in the house.\"  She was always a little subdued by my brother's manner; I think its courtesy and polish almost frightened her, high-spirited, resolute woman as she was.  \"I understand,\" she said, with a stiff, cold tone.  Jaquetta heard the echo of it, and wondered.  \"But,\" he added, \"when they understand all, and when my father is equal to it, you shall be sent for.\"  When he went back to the library he found my poor father unconscious. It was really only fainting then, and he came round without anyone being called, and he shrank from seeing anyone but Torwood, explaining to him most earnestly how, though he was too ill himself to go to the place, his brother-officer, General Poyntz, had done so for him, and had been persuaded that the whole settlement and all the inhabitants had been swept off.  It was such a shock to him that it nearly killed him.  Poor father! it was grievous to hear him wish it had quite done so!  We only knew that the woman had upset my father very much, and that Torwood could not leave him.  Word was sent us to sit down to dinner without them, and Torwood sent for some gravy soup and some wine for him.  He went on talking--sometimes about us, but more often about poor Faith, who seemed to have come back on him in all the beauty and charm of his first love.  He seemed to be talking himself feverish, and after a time Torwood thought that silence would be better for him; so he got him to go to bed, and"]]]
