A momentary glance showed me Burton, standing transfixed, with mouth and eyes wide open; then rallying my scattered ideas I hastened to avail myself of this happy mistake, and answered that my brother was quite well, and would be delighted to hear I had met her. She bowed. But I had a brother, could she really know him? Her next words solved the problem: \"How did he like your leaving the regiment? It was so pleasant to be always together,\" murmuring something of submission to necessity. I begged her to join the quadrille then forming, to which, after some slight hesitation, she assented, saying to her friends, \"Shall I find you here?\" \"Yes,\" said \"he of the seals,\" as G. P. R. James would call him, \"I am glad you are going to dance;\" the little woman gave her a smile and a nod, and we joined the quadrille. Longing to draw her from her reminiscences which kept me in a frightful state of mind lest I should make a false step, not daring to start almost any topic lest it should betray me, I feel convinced I presented an illustration of the acme of boobyism. At length I ventured to remark that I was surprised not to have seen her at any of the oratorios; this was true at all events. \"We only came over for yesterday's performances,\" she said, \"and arriving very early we got up near the orchestra. How superb that double chorus was. I should like to have heard it in some huge dim cathedral; the theatric decorations of that concert room seemed to jar upon the eye.\"  \"Yes! I quite agree with you; I am certain had I heard it under those circumstances I should have been ready to shave my head, tie a cord round my waist, and join the Franciscans _sur l'instant_!\"  I felt more at ease--\"If I can avoid my brother and the old regiment I am tolerably safe.\" I thought--\"if I could get the smallest glimpse of who I am I should go ahead famously.\"  A few more sentences, broken by the movements of the dance, when my partner, returning to me, again threw me off my centre, by suddenly raising her eyes to mine with a sort of demure merriment sparkling in them, saying, \"You have not enquired for any of your old friends! But, military memories are proverbially short, and yours is no exception I fear.\" Passing over the dangerous commencement of this speech, I launched into a glowing defence of military memories in general, and my own in particular, and wound up by entreating her to give me the fullest intelligence of all my old friends. She shook her head, \"Ah! those generalities speak but badly of the kindliness of recollection I like.\" Good Heavens! I was getting deeper in the mire; the rich soft tones that could not be uttered by any one not possessed both of heart and intellect, seemed to sink into mine! So, hastily stammering that she did me great injustice, I reiterated my request for all the news she could impart. \"I suppose you know all about the--\"  \"I cannot remember the numbers of regiments,\" said she, looking to me for the word.  \"Oh! of course,\" said I hastily, \"a copious correspondence places me pretty well _au fond_.\"  \"Yes! but my cousin, I know you will be glad to hear though you have not the grace to ask, is still abroad, and, I hear, as beautiful as ever, and refusing all that princes and peers can offer to induce her again to try the lottery of marriage.\"  \"Ah! the loved are not always soon forgotten,\" said I, trying to chime in with the tone of subdued feeling which seemed to pervade all my fair companion said. She looked at me with an air of disapprobation and replied gravely, \"Notwithstanding their great disparity of years, my cousin did truly and deeply feel her husband's loss.\" I had better take care! could I but draw her off from her confounded cousin! At that moment she dropped her fan; I looked at it for a moment before restoring it to her; it was antique, with gold sticks, and of great value, the only part of her toilet that bespoke wealth. \"You remember that fan and Lady Desmond's grand ball?\" said she smiling. \"Indeed I do,\" I exclaimed, enraptured to have learned at one _coup_ that Dublin was the scene of our acquaintance and that Lady Desmond was a mutual friend. Here, however, the quadrille ended, and accepting my arm, my unknown belle turned her steps and mine, _malgr√© moi_, in the direction of the oft mentioned pillars, near which we had left her chaperons; but those deserving individuals had, with praiseworthy carelessness, disappeared, and my companion after looking round in vain, said, in a somewhat anxious tone, \"they are certainly not here, I shall never find them again.\" I suggested the probability of nature requiring support, and that the refreshment room would be the most likely place in which to recover her lost guardians.  Assenting to this, and to my proposal of an ice, we were soon moving _en masse_ with the other dancers towards the tea rooms, and now, freed _pro. tem._ from the incubus of cousins and brothers, whom my partner appeared to forget in her keen appreciation of the many ridiculous points in the mob around her, I felt my spirits rise to concert pitch, the embargo on my tongue removed, and, fancying myself most agreeable, the passage to the refreshment table seemed to me to be performed with miraculous rapidity.--Here, after a short inspection, we discovered the missing individuals, and hastening towards them with speed I thought rather ungracious, this puzzling, but fascinating girl, with an inclination of the head and a smile in which much suppressed mirth seemed struggling, dropped my arm and took her station beside her incongruous companions. But I was not to be so easily sent adrift; I had not served a twelve or thirteen years' apprenticeship to ball rooms to be thus dismissed if I choose to stay; so with a deferential bow, \"I shall bring your ice here,\" said I; and rapidly securing one, I had the satisfaction of hearing her say, as I approached with it, as if in continuation of something, \"knew him slightly in Dublin, a long time ago;\" which, in some measure, placed me _au dessous des cartes_; for if only a slight acquaintance, I could not be expected to have very many subjects or reminiscences in common with her; so resolutely determined to stand my ground, have another dance, learn who she really was, and, if possible, lay the foundation of a future acquaintance, I took up a position beside the beautiful incognita, and ventured to discuss Ireland in a guarded and general manner, observing, with perfect truth, that two of the pleasantest years of my life had been spent there. I could perceive a decided increase of cordiality in Miss ---- (what would I not have given to know the name) as I pronounced this eulogy on her native country--for I had soon guessed, by the indescribable spirit of frankness, arch, yet tempered with a certain dignity in its gay _abandon_, which pervaded her manner, that she was Irish--and just as she had turned laughingly to answer some playful charge against its characteristics, spoken apparently through a medium of mashed potatoes in his throat, by the man with the seals, Burton touched my arm, \"Egerton, don't keep all your luck to yourself, introduce me.\"  \"Hold your tongue--for Heaven's sake, my dear fellow,\" I exclaimed in a rapid aside--\"don't breathe my name: at this moment I have not the most remote idea who I am, and am constantly on the verge of an unpardonable scrape; be silent and begone, I will tell you all afterwards.\" Silenced and amazed, poor Burton retired, and my unknown friend, turning to me as I stood elate at having conquered difficulties, again showed me my uncertain footing by observing--\"But you used to cherish the most heretical opinions on these points, and offend me not a little by their open avowal.\" What an ill-bred savage she must identify me with! \"Raw boys are always odious and irrational; you should not have deigned to listen to me,\" said I in despair.  \"Oh! you were by no means a raw boy, you looked quite as old as you do now; besides, it is not half a century since we met,\" she replied, with another distracting look; and then--with a merry burst of apparently irrepressible laughter, in which, though I could not account for it, her friends and myself joined--it was so infectious, added--\"You must forgive me, but really your reminiscences seem to be in such inextricable confusion, I cannot help laughing.\" In an agony lest all should be discovered--with the respectable couple before-mentioned for umpires, I urged in defence \"that my memory was like the background of a picture from which one figure alone stood out clear and well defined.\" Then, observing that she was beating time to the sound of a most delicious waltz just begun, \"Am I too unreasonable to ask for a waltz as well as a quadrille,\" I said. She half shook her head, then, smiling to her companions, observed--\"It is so long since I had a waltz I cannot resist it; shall I keep you too late, _Caro Maestro_?\" \"No, no,\" said the lady with the cap, \"we will go and watch you.\" In a few moments I was whirling my fair incognita round to the inspiring strains of the Elfin Waltz, then new and unhacknied.  What a delicious waltz that was! My partner seemed endowed with the very spirit of the dance: her light pliant form seemed to respond to every tone of the music, and not an unpractised _valseur_ myself, I felt that I was, at all"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/47338"],["title","Kate Vernon: A Tale. Vol. 1 (of 3) (#2)"],["body","s, no encumbrance to her movements. I have never heard that waltz since--whether ground on the most deplorable of barrel organs, or blown in uncertain blasts from the watery instruments of a temperance band--without seeing, as in a magic mirror, the whole scene conjured up before my eyes: the intense enjoyment of my partner, which beamed so eloquently from her soft grey eyes, and spoke volumes of the nature it expressed: the childlike simplicity with which, when at length wearied, she stopped and said, turning to me--\"You dance very well! How I have enjoyed that waltz!\"  Many a stray sixpence those reminiscences have cost me! \"But,\" she continued, \"it must be late, and I cannot keep my friends any longer, let us find them as soon as possible.\" This was soon done, and, to my infinite chagrin, my partner declared herself quite ready to depart, pronouncing a glowing eulogium on my dancing. \"You must have taken lessons since I had the pleasure of meeting you, for formerly--\" There she stopped, for the philanthropic little cavalier she had called _caro maestro_ interrupted her, wrapped a shawl round her, begging she would hold it to her mouth and keep that feature closed during her passage to the carriage, and led the way with his, I supposed, wife, leaving me still in possession of the little hand which had rested on my shoulder during the waltz. Now, or never, I thought.  \"I fear I have induced you to prolong that waltz beyond your strength,\" for I felt her arm still trembling with the exertion, \"you must allow me to assure myself to-morrow that you have felt no ill effects?\"  \"We are not staying here,\" she said with some hesitation; \"we only came in for the festival and leave to-morrow.\"  Here we reached the passage, and _il caro maestro_ proceeding to discover their carriage, I felt myself, of course, bound to divide my attentions with the lady of the cap, and, not choosing to prosecute my enquiries within range of her ears, I remained some time in a state of internal frying till he returned, and I was again _t√™te-√†-t√™te_ for a moment with their charge.  \"But do you not reside in the neighbourhood?\" We were close at the door. Smiling with her eyes, she shook her head, pointed to the shawl which she held to her mouth in obedience to the injunction she had received, and remained silent; I was distracted. \"Forgive me,\" I exclaimed, \"and pray speak; I must see you again.\"  \"Come, my dear,\" cried my tormentor, \"you'll catch cold, make haste!\"  Her foot was on the step;--she was in, her guardian opposite her;--the glass drawn up. \"Move on,\" said the policeman. One glance, as she bowed full of arch drollery, and I was left on the door step repeating, over and over, \"No. 756--756,\" while my brain was in a whirl of excitement, my beautiful vision gone, and my only clue to discover her the number of a cab!     CHAPTER II.  THE SEARCH.   With a confused sensation of annoyance and ill temper, I opened my eyes at the _reveill√©_ next morning, and for some moments experienced that most painful puzzle of which few in this troublesome world of ours are quite ignorant, and which is one of the accompaniments of a great grief, videlicet, a perfect certainty that you are in the middle of something disagreeable, but what you are not sufficiently wide awake to discover. The process of shaving, at all times a reflective one, soon cleared up to me the mystery, and placed in full array the pros. and cons. of my chance of ever meeting my beautiful \"incognita\" again. Even my decidedly sanguine disposition was compelled to acknowledge that the \"pros.\" were few indeed. Still, as I am not without a certain degree of resolution, especially when the matter to be decided on touches my fancy or my affections, I determined pretty firmly not to relinquish the effort to discover and renew my acquaintance with the belle of last night.  I had hardly commenced an attack upon my eggs and broiled ham, when Burton walked in, brimful of curiosity, as I had anticipated, and to avoid the bore of being questioned, I at once opened my budget, and told him the whole history down to my present resolution; the more readily as he was a sufficiently high-minded gentleman-like fellow to talk to about a woman you respected; no blab, and a great chum of mine into the bargain.  I regret to say he laughed most unsympathisingly at my dilemma, and acknowledged that he had spent the greater part of the evening watching my proceedings, and speculating as to alternate expressions of triumph and defeat which swept across my countenance.  \"I never heard of a more curious _rencontre_, the fair unknown must have had a very slight acquaintance with your prototype; and then your unequalled luck sending you to the right quarter for discovering the scene of the original acquaintance, and being sufficiently _au fait_ at its habits and inhabitants, she could never have dreamt of having mistaken you. But how do you think of setting about her recovery?\"  \"Ah! there's the rub. An advertisement in the _Carrington Chronicle_--'If the young lady with the antique fan, &c., who danced the Elfin Waltz with an officer of H.M.'s -- Light Dragoons, at the ball last night, will send her address to the Cavalry Barracks, she will hear of something to her advantage,' would hardly do, eh? Besides, the admiration, however respectful, of a younger son, a landless Captain would not, I fear, come under the denomination of an advantage.\"  \"And suppose you discover her, perhaps enshrined in some lordly old manor house, surrounded with all the prestige of position, what will you say for yourself as an excuse, for your bold attempt to see her again?\"  \"If I met her in one of her native mud cabins the difficulty, if it existed at all, would exist all the same for me; I feel that she is in herself equal to a ring fence of nobility. But,\" I continued, walking up and down the room with folded arms, the approved method of showing that stern determination, \"_that_ I can easily manage; I suffered too much, and felt my natural powers whatever they are, under too great a cloud from my false position last night, ever to submit myself to the same again. No, I shall boldly say that I had called to relieve my conscience by apologising for the audacity with which I had encouraged her mistake last night, but that I really had not sufficient strength of mind to deny myself the pleasure of dancing and conversing with her, and that in reward of my present endeavour to do right, I hoped she would not deny me the honour of her acquaintance; surely, the very effort to see her will be in my favour.\"  \"Granted; _et puis_,\" said Burton coolly.  \"For God's sake, my dear fellow, don't ask me to begin thinking of consequences _now_, for the first time in my life!\"  \"It strikes me, Egerton, that you are decidedly done for!\"  \"Not exactly. Yet I confess I would attempt and brave a good deal to hear the low tones of my nameless belle's rather remarkable voice once more. There was so much feeling in them. I am sure she sings. I fear the wish to see her is scarcely reciprocated, for I had at times a dread sensation from the bright laugh in her eye that somehow or other she was selling me. Probably she confounded me with some fool she had known formerly; flattering association! Yet, I am not without what are generally considered elements of success in the eyes of the fair sex! _Imprimis_, one dark brown curly _pow_, as our friends in the north say, two eyes ditto in tint, six feet high, and an air _distingu√©_. Eh! Burton, what do you say?\"  \"That you're an insufferable coxcomb, but the inventory is tolerably correct.\"  \"Don't imagine that I consider the items of much value. None but inexperienced boys think that mere good looks are a passport to the heart of any woman that's worth having. We love beauty exclusively; but there is not a woman with an ounce of truth in herself that will not be instinctively attracted to a manly straightforward fellow, be he ever so plain; and, if he show her devotion, give him her whole heart as readily as if he was Apollo and Adonis all in one!\"  \"Hum,\" said Burton, \"perhaps so; but to business. How do you intend to proceed?\"  \"First, to discover cab 756, and, from its interesting charioteer, learn at what hotel the objects of my search put up; there they will know their names.\"  \"Suppose they were at a private house with friends.\"  \"Pshaw! Suppose they had lodgings in the moon! Did I not tell you the young lady expressly said they were perfect strangers?\"  \"That might be _fa√ßon_.\"  \"Burton! Another objection and you may look out for squalls! It is my only plan, so be silent.\"  \"When do you set out upon the search?\"  \"This morning, while the memory of Jehu may be fresh; the moment parade is over.\"  \"Shall we hunt in couples?\"  \"No, my dear fellow; in such a pursuit you would founder at the first fence.\"  \"I confess my heart and soul are not in the business, so I might be an obstacle; besides--but there's the trumpet; adieu! May success attend you, and the spirit of a thousand detectives inspire you.\"  Parade over, I hastened to doff my uniform, and with a delightful sensation of excitement, which I never imagined I could experience in the depressed atmosphere of Carrington, I sallied forth on my quest, with a spirit of perseverance, which, if there be any truth in ancient proverbs, augured well for the accomplishment of my object. As usual in that horrid locality, the weather was \"dimmed dimp and disagreeable,\" as Mantilini says, and not more than three or four cabs on the first stands I passed; none of these sported the magic figures; while the innumerable ones which were in motion, seemed by some perverse and unaccustomed freak to drive with such unprecedented rapidity, that though keen of sight, I could not distinguish their numbers. After perambulating the town in all its intricacies, visiting every cab stand extant, within its compass, standing numerous charges from the vehicles themselves, and a"]]]
