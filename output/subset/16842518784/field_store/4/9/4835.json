Jenna received a blinding slap across the eyes.  He staggered back; Wilfrid slashed his sword in defence of him.  He struck a man down. \"Blood!  blood!\"  cried the gathering mob, and gave space, but hedged the couple thickly.  Windows were thrown up; forth came a rain of household projectiles.  The cry of \"Blood! blood!\"  was repeated by numbers pouring on them from the issues to right and left.  It is a terrible cry in a city.  In a city of the South it rouses the wild beast in men to madness. Jenna smoked triumphantly and blew great clouds, with an eye aloft for the stools, basins, chairs, and water descending.  They were in the middle of one of the close streets of old Milan.  The man felled by Wilfrid was raised on strong arms, that his bleeding head might be seen of all, and a dreadful hum went round.  A fire of missiles, stones, balls of wax, lumps of dirt, sticks of broken chairs, began to play.  Wilfrid had a sudden gleam of the face of his Verona assailant.  He and Jenna called \"Follow me,\" in one breath, and drove forward with sword-points, which they dashed at the foremost; by dint of swift semicirclings of the edges they got through, but a mighty voice of command thundered; the rearward portion of the mob swung rapidly to the front, presenting a scattered second barrier; Jenna tripped on a fallen body, lost his cigar, and swore that he must find it.  A dagger struck his sword-arm.  He staggered and flourished his blade in the air, calling \"On!\" without stirring.  \"This infernal cigar!\" he said; and to the mob, \"What mongrel of you took my cigar?\"  Stones thumped on his breast; the barrier-line ahead grew denser.  \"I'll go at them first; you're bleeding,\" said Wilfrid.  They were refreshed by the sound of German cheering, as in approach.  Jenna uplifted a crow of the regimental hurrah of the charge; it was answered; on they went and got through the second fence, saw their comrades, and were running to meet them, when a weighted ball hit Wilfrid on the back of the head.  He fell, as he believed, on a cushion of down, and saw thousands of saints dancing with lamps along cathedral aisles.  The next time he opened his eyes he fancied he had dropped into the vaults of the cathedral.  His sensation of sinking was so vivid that he feared lest he should be going still further below.  There was a lamp in the chamber, and a young man sat reading by the light of the lamp. Vision danced fantastically on Wilfrid's brain.  He saw that he rocked as in a ship, yet there was no noise of the sea; nothing save the remote thunder haunting empty ears at strain for sound.  He looked again; the young man was gone, the lamp was flickering.  Then he became conscious of a strong ray on his eyelids; he beheld his enemy gazing down on him and swooned.  It was with joy, that when his wits returned, he found himself looking on the young man by the lamp.  \"That other face was a dream,\" he thought, and studied the aspect of the young man with the unwearied attentiveness of partial stupor, that can note accurately, but cannot deduce from its noting, and is inveterate in patience because it is unideaed.  Memory wakened first.  \"Guidascarpi!\" he said to himself.  The name was uttered half aloud.  The young man started and closed his book.  \"You know me?\" he asked.  \"You are Guidascarpi?\"  \"I am.\"  \"Guidascarpi, I think I helped to save your life in Meran.\"  The young man stooped over him.  \"You speak of my brother Angelo.  I am Rinaldo.  My debt to you is the same, if you have served him.\"  \"Is he safe?\"  \"He is in Lugano.\"  \"The signorina Vittoria?\"  \"In Turin.\"  \"Where am I?\"  The reply came from another mouth than Rinaldo's.  \"You are in the poor lodging of the shoemaker, whose shoes, if you had thought fit to wear them, would have conducted you anywhere but to this place.\"  \"Who are you?\"  Wilfrid moaned.  \"You ask who I am.  I am the Eye of Italy.  I am the Cat who sees in the dark.\"  Barto Rizzo raised the lamp and stood at his feet.  \"Look straight.  You know me, I think.\"  Wilfrid sighed, \"Yes, I know you; do your worst.\"  His head throbbed with the hearing of a heavy laugh, as if a hammer had knocked it.  What ensued he knew not; he was left to his rest.  He lay there many days and nights, that were marked by no change of light; the lamp burned unwearyingly.  Rinaldo and a woman tended him.  The sign of his reviving strength was shown by a complaint he launched at the earthy smell of the place.  \"It is like death,\" said Rinaldo, coming to his side.  \"I am used to it, and familiar with death too,\" he added in a musical undertone.  \"Are you also a prisoner here?\"  Wilfrid questioned him.  \"I am.\"  \"The brute does not kill, then?\"  \"No; he saves.  I owe my life to him.  He has rescued yours.\"  \"Mine?\"  said Wilfrid.  \"You would have been torn to pieces in the streets but for Barto Rizzo.\"  The streets were the world above to Wilfrid; he was eager to hear of the doings in them.  Rinaldo told him that the tobacco-war raged still; the soldiery had recently received orders to smoke abroad, and street battles were hourly occurring.  \"They call this government!\" he interjected.  He was a soft-voiced youth; slim and tall and dark, like Angelo, but with a more studious forehead.  The book he was constantly reading was a book of chemistry.  He entertained Wilfrid with very strange talk.  He spoke of the stars and of a destiny.  He cited certain minor events of his life to show the ground of his present belief in there being a written destiny for each individual man.  \"Angelo and I know it well.  It was revealed to us when we were boys.  It has been certified to us up to this moment. Mark what I tell you,\" he pursued in a devout sincerity of manner that baffled remonstrance, \"my days end with this new year.  His end with the year following.  Our house is dead.\"  Wilfrid pressed his hand.  \"Have you not been too long underground?\"  \"That is the conviction I am coming to.  But when I go out to breathe the air of heaven, I go to my fate.  Should I hesitate?  We Italians of this period are children of thunder and live the life of a flash.  The worms may creep on: the men must die.  Out of us springs a better world. Romara, Ammiani, Mercadesco, Montesini, Rufo, Cardi, whether they see it or not, will sweep forward to it.  To some of them, one additional day of breath is precious.  Not so for Angelo and me.  We are unbeloved.  We have neither mother nor sister, nor betrothed.  What is an existence that can fly to no human arms?  I have been too long underground, because, while I continue to hide, I am as a drawn sword between two lovers.\"  The previous mention of Ammiani's name, together with the knowledge he had of Ammiani's relationship to the Guidascarpi, pointed an instant identification of these lovers to Wilfrid.  He asked feverishly who they were, and looked his best simplicity, as one who was always interested by stories of lovers.  The voice of Barto Rizzo, singing \"Vittoria!\" stopped Rinaldo's reply: but Wilfrid read it in his smile at that word.  He was too weak to restrain his anguish, and flung on the couch and sobbed.  Rinaldo supposed that he was in fear of Barto, and encouraged him to meet the man confidently.  A lusty \"Viva l'Italia!  Vittoria!\" heralded Barto's entrance.  \"My boy! my noblest! we have beaten them the cravens!  Tell me now--have I served an apprenticeship to the devil for nothing?  We have struck the cigars out of their mouths and the monopoly-money out of their pockets.  They have surrendered.  The Imperial order prohibits soldiers from smoking in the streets of Milan, and so throughout Lombardy!  Soon we will have the prisons empty, by our own order.  Trouble yourself no more about Ammiani.  He shall come out to the sound of trumpets.  I hear them!  Hither, my Rosellina, my plump melon; up with your red lips, and buss me a Napoleon salute--ha! ha!\"  Barto's wife went into his huge arm, and submissively lifted her face. He kissed her like a barbaric king, laughing as from wine.  Wilfrid smothered his head from his incarnate thunder.  He was unnoticed by Barto.  Presently a silence told him that he was left to himself.  An idea possessed him that the triumph of the Italians meant the release of Ammiani, and his release the loss of Vittoria for ever.  Since her graceless return of his devotion to her in Meran, something like a passion--arising from the sole spring by which he could be excited to conceive a passion--had filled his heart.  He was one of those who delight to dally with gentleness and faith, as with things that are their heritage; but the mere suspicion of coquettry and indifference plunged him into a fury of jealous wrathfulness, and tossed so desireable an image of beauty before him that his mad thirst to embrace it seemed love. By our manner of loving we are known.  He thought it no meanness to escape and cause a warning to be conveyed to the Government that there was another attempt brewing for the rescue of Count Ammiani.  Acting forthwith on the hot impulse, he seized the lamp.  The door was unlocked. Luckier than Luigi had been, he found a ladder outside, and a square opening through which he crawled; continuing to ascend along close passages and up narrow flights of stairs, that appeared to him to be fashioned to avoid the rooms of the house.  At last he pushed a door, and found himself in an armoury, among stands of muskets, swords, bayonets, cartouche-boxes, and, most singular of all, though he observed them last, small brass pieces of cannon, shining with polish.  Shot was piled in pyramids beneath their mouths.  He examined the guns admiringly.  There were rows of daggers along shelves; some in sheath, others bare; one that had been hastily wiped showed a smear of ropy blood.  He stood debating whether he should seize a sword for his protection.  In the act of trying"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4440"],["title","Vittoria â€” Volume 6 (#2)"],["body","temper on the floor, the sword-hilt was knocked from his hand, and he felt a coil of arms around him.  He was in the imprisoning embrace of Barto Rizzo's wife.  His first, and perhaps natural, impression accused her of a violent display of an eccentric passion for his manly charms; and the tighter she locked him, the more reasonably was he held to suppose it; but as, while stamping on the floor, she offered nothing to his eyes save the yellow poll of her neck, and hung neither panting nor speaking, he became undeceived.  His struggles were preposterous; his lively sense of ridicule speedily stopped them.  He remained passive, from time to time desperately adjuring his living prison to let him loose, or to conduct him whither he had come; but the inexorable coil kept fast--how long there was no guessing--till he could have roared out tears of rage, and that is extremity for an Englishman.  Rinaldo arrived in his aid; but the woman still clung to him.  He was freed only by the voice of Barto Rizzo, who marched him back.  Rinaldo subsequently told him that his discovery of the armoury necessitated his confinement.  \"Necessitates it!\" cried Wilfrid.  \"Is this your Italian gratitude?\"  The other answered: \"My friend, you risked your fortune for my brother; but this is a case that concerns our country.\"  He deemed these words to be an unquestionable justification, for he said no more.  After this they ceased to converse.  Each lay down on his strip of couch-matting; rose and ate, and passed the dreadful untamed hours; nor would Wilfrid ask whether it was day or night.  We belong to time so utterly, that when we get no note of time, it wears the shrouded head of death for us already.  Rinaldo could quit the place as he pleased; he knew the hours; and Wilfrid supposed that it must be hatred that kept him from voluntarily divulging that blessed piece of knowledge.  He had to encourage a retorting spirit of hatred in order to mask his intense craving.  By an assiduous calculation of seconds and minutes, he was enabled to judge that the lamp burned a space of six hours before it required replenishing.  Barto Rizzo's wife trimmed it regularly, but the accursed woman came at all seasons.  She brought their meals irregularly, and she would never open her lips: she was like a guardian of the tombs.  Wilfrid abandoned his dream of the variation of night and day, and with that the sense of life deadened, as the lamp did toward the sixth hour.  Thenceforward his existence fed on the movements of his companion, the workings of whose mind he began to read with a marvellous insight.  He knew once, long in advance of the act or an indication of it, that Rinaldo was bent on prayer.  Rinaldo had slightly closed his eyelids during the perusal of his book; he had taken a pencil and traced lines on it from memory, and dotted points here and there; he had left the room, and returned to resume his study.  Then, after closing the book softly, he had taken up the mark he was accustomed to place in the last page of his reading, and tossed it away.  Wilfrid was prepared to clap hands when he should see the hated fellow drop on his knees; but when that sight verified his calculation, he huddled himself exultingly in his couch-cloth:--it was like a confirming clamour to him that he was yet wholly alive.  He watched the anguish of the prayer, and was rewarded for the strain of his faculties by sleep.  Barto Rizzo's rough voice awakened him.  Barto had evidently just communicated dismal tidings to Rinaldo, who left the vault with him, and was absent long enough to make Wilfrid forget his hatred in an irresistible desire to catch him by the arm and look in his face.  \"Ah! you have not forsaken me,\" the greeting leaped out.  \"Not now,\" said Rinaldo.  \"Do you think of going?\"  \"I will speak to you presently, my friend.\"  \"Hound!\" cried Wilfrid, and turned his face to the wall.  Until he slept, he heard the rapid travelling of a pen; on his awakening, the pen vexed him like a chirping cricket that tells us that cock-crow is long distant when we are moaning for the dawn.  Great drops of sweat were on Rinaldo's forehead.  He wrote as one who poured forth a history without pause.  Barto's wife came to the lamp and beckoned him out, bearing the lamp away.  There was now for the first time darkness in this vault.  Wilfrid called Rinaldo by name, and heard nothing but the fear of the place, which seemed to rise bristling at his voice and shrink from it.  He called till dread of his voice held him dumb.  \"I am, then, a coward,\" he thought.  Nor could he by-and-by repress a start of terror on hearing Rinaldo speak out of the darkness.  With screams for the lamp, and cries that he was suffering slow murder, he underwent a paroxysm in the effort to conceal his abject horror.  Rinaldo sat by his side patiently.  At last, he said: \"We are both of us prisoners on equal terms now.\"  That was quieting intelligence to Wilfrid, who asked eagerly: \"What hour is it?\"  It was eleven of the forenoon.  Wilfrid strove to dissociate his recollection of clear daylight from the pressure of the hideous featureless time surrounding him.  He asked: \"What week?\"  It was the first week in March.  Wilfrid could not keep from sobbing aloud.  In the early period of such a captivity, imagination, deprived of all other food, conjures phantasms for the employment of the brain; but there is still some consciousness within the torpid intellect wakeful to laugh at them as they fly, though they have held us at their mercy.  The face of time had been imaged like the withering mask of a corpse to him.  He had felt, nevertheless, that things had gone on as we trust them to do at the closing of our eyelids: he had preserved a mystical remote faith in the steady running of the world above, and hugged it as his most precious treasure.  A thunder was rolled in his ears when he heard of the flight of two months at one bound.  Two big months!  He would have guessed, at farthest, two weeks.  \"I have been two months in one shirt?  Impossible!\" he exclaimed.  His serious idea (he cherished it for the support of his reason) was, that the world above had played a mad prank since he had been shuffled off its stage.  \"It can't be March,\" he said.  \"Is there sunlight overhead?\"  \"It is a true Milanese March,\" Rinaldo replied.  \"Why am I kept a prisoner?\"  \"I cannot say.  There must be some idea of making use of you.\"  \"Have you arms?\"  \"I have none.\"  \"You know where they're to be had.\"  \"I know, but I would not take them if I could.  They, my friend, are for a better cause.\"  \"A thousand curses on your country!\"  cried Wilfrid.  \"Give me air; give me freedom, I am stifled; I am eaten up with dirt; I am half dead.  Are we never to have the lamp again?\"  \"Hear me speak,\" Rinaldo stopped his ravings.  \"I will tell you what my position is.  A second attempt has been made to help Count Ammiani's escape; it has failed.  He is detained a prisoner by the Government under the pretence that he is implicated in the slaying of an Austrian noble by the hands of two brothers, one of whom slew him justly--not as a dog is slain, but according to every honourable stipulation of the code.  I was the witness of the deed.  It is for me that my cousin, Count Ammiani, droops in prison when he should be with his bride.  Let me speak on, I pray you.  I have said that I stand between two lovers.  I can release him, I know well, by giving myself up to the Government.  Unless I do so instantly, he will be removed from Milan to one of their fortresses in the interior, and there he may cry to the walls and iron-bars for his trial.  They are aware that he is dear to Milan, and these two miserable attempts have furnished them with their excuse.  Barto Rizzo bids me wait.  I have waited: I can wait no longer.  The lamp is withheld from me to stop my writing to my brother, that I may warn him of my design, but the letter is written; the messenger is on his way to Lugano.  I do not state my intentions before I have taken measures to accomplish them.  I am as much Barto Rizzo's prisoner now as you are.\"  The plague of darkness and thirst for daylight prevented Wilfrid from having any other sentiment than gladness that a companion equally unfortunate with himself was here, and equally desirous to go forth. When Barto's wife brought their meal, and the lamp to light them eating it, Rinaldo handed her pen, ink, pencil, paper, all the material of correspondence; upon which, as one who had received a stipulated exchange, she let the lamp remain.  While the new and thrice-dear rays were illumining her dark-coloured solid beauty, I know not what touch of man-like envy or hurt vanity led Wilfrid to observe that the woman's eyes dwelt with a singular fulness and softness on Rinaldo.  It was fulness and softness void of fire, a true ox-eyed gaze, but human in the fall of the eyelids; almost such as an early poet of the brush gave to the Virgin carrying her Child, to become an everlasting reduplicated image of a mother's strong beneficence of love.  He called Rinaldo's attention to it when the woman had gone.  Rinaldo understood his meaning at once.  \"It will have to be so, I fear,\" he said; \"I have thought of it.  But if I lead her to disobey Barto, there is little hope for the poor soul.\"  He rose up straight, like one who would utter grace for meat.  \"Must we, O my God, give a sacrifice at every step?\"  With that he resumed his seat stiffly, and bent and murmured to himself. Wilfrid had at one time of his life imagined that he was marked by a peculiar distinction from the common herd; but contact with this young man taught him to feel his fellowship to the world at large, and to rejoice at it, though it partially humbled him.  They had no further visit from Barto Rizzo.  The woman tended them in the same unswerving silence, and at whiles that adorable maternity of aspect. Wilfrid was touched by commiseration for her.  He was too bitterly"]]]
