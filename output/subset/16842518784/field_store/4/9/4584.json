Another quarrel came over the question of money. The uncle wanted Andy to hand over all his earnings, but this the lad refused to do. Josiah Graham had already gotten possession of the fifteen hundred dollars left by Andy's father, but this was lost in a wildcat speculation in lumber for which the old man was morally, if not legally, responsible. The youth felt that he must be cautious or his uncle might make him penniless.  \"I'll pay the bills and give you a dollar a week,\" he told Josiah Graham. \"That will buy those tablets you take for your dyspepsia. You had better give up smoking.\"  \"Smoking is good for the dyspepsy,\" was the reply. \"You give me the money an' I'll pay the bills,\" and then, when Andy still refused, the uncle waited until pay-day and went to the lumber camp and collected his nephew's wages. This brought on more trouble, and, because of this, Andy lost his position.  It was midwinter, and to get another job was by no means easy. The youth tramped from place to place, but without success. The money in the hands of Josiah Graham was running low, and he was constantly \"nagging\" Andy to go and do something. He was perfectly able to look for work himself, but was too indolent to make the effort. He preferred to sit in front of the blazing fire and give advice. Once or twice a week he would shuffle off to the village, two miles away, to sit behind the pot stove in the general store and listen to the news.  \"The laziest man in the whole district,\" declared the storekeeper. \"It's a pity he showed up to bother Andy Graham. I think the boy could have done better without him.\" And this verdict was shared by many. But nobody dared to tell Josiah Graham, for fear of provoking a quarrel with the man.  As mentioned before, Andy's father had left fifteen hundred dollars. He had also bequeathed to his son, when he should become of age, an interest in a large timber tract in upper Michigan. On his deathbed the father had secretly given his son some papers referring to the land, telling him to beware or some \"lumber sharks\" would get the better of him and take his property away. Andy now had these papers hidden in a box under his bed. He had not told his uncle of them, feeling that his relative was not capable of looking after his rights. Andy's education was somewhat limited, yet he knew a great deal more than did Josiah Graham, who had been too lazy to attend school, even when he had the chance.  \"I'll keep the papers secret,\" the lad told himself, \"and some day, when I get the chance and have the money, I'll go down to Bangor or Portland and get a lawyer to look into the matter for me. If I let Uncle Si have them he'll allow the land sharks to cheat me out of everything.\"  Andy's father had been more or less of a hunter, and the boy took naturally to a rifle and a shotgun. He was a fair marksman, and the winter previous had laid low three deer and a great variety of small game. One of the deer had been brought down on a windy day and at long range, and of that shot he was justly proud. The venison and other meat had come in handy at the cabin, and the deer skins and the horns of a buck had brought him in some money that was badly needed.  \"If I can't get a job, I'm going hunting for a few days,\" said Andy half aloud, as he trudged through the snow. \"It's better than doing nothing, Uncle Si to the contrary. Maybe I can get Chet to go along. I don't think he has anything else to do. Somehow or other, it seems to be awfully dull around here this winter. Maybe I would have done better if I had tried my luck down in one of the towns.\"  Andy had to pass through the village of Pine Run, consisting of a general store, blacksmith shop, church, and a score of houses. As he approached the settlement he saw a horse and cutter coming toward him at a smart rate of speed. In the cutter sat a man of about thirty, dressed in a fine fur overcoat.  \"Whoa!\" called the man to his steed, as he approached the youth, and the horse soon came to a halt. \"Say, can you tell me, is this the road to Moose Ridge?\" he asked.  \"It's one of the roads,\" answered Andy.  \"Then there is another?\"  \"Yes, sir, just beyond that fringe of trees yonder.\"  \"Which is the best road?\"  \"What part of the Ridge do you want to go to?\"  \"Up to a place called the Blasted Pines.\"  \"Then you had better take the other road. You won't get through this way.\"  \"You are sure of that? I don't want to make any mistake.\"  \"Yes, I am sure. I've been up there hunting myself,\" added Andy. He saw that the cutter contained a game bag and two gun cases.  \"Is the hunting any good?\"  \"It was last year. I haven't been up there this year. I got a fine big deer up there. Maybe I'll get up there later--if I can't find work.\"  \"Out of employment, eh?\"  \"Yes, sir.\"  \"Well, if you come up there perhaps we'll meet again,\" said the man, and started to turn the cutter back to the other road. \"Much obliged for the information.\"  \"You're welcome,\" answered Andy. And then he watched the turnout swing around and dash away for the other road.  Little did he dream of the strange circumstances under which he was to meet this man again, or of what that encounter was to bring forth.     CHAPTER II  AT THE LUMBER CAMP   Leaving the village behind him, Andy struck out bravely for the Storburgh lumber camp, three miles up the river. The thermometer was low but there was no wind, and he did not mind the cold, for he had plenty of good red blood in his veins. All he was worried about was the question of getting work. He knew that he must have money, and that it could not very well be obtained without employment.  \"If I were a fellow in a fairy story book I might find a bag of gold,\" he mused. \"But as I'm only a Yankee lad, I guess I'll have to hustle around for all I get. Even if I went hunting and brought down a deer or two, or a moose, that wouldn't bring in enough. If I were a regular guide I might get a job with that gentleman in the cutter. He looked as if he had money to spend. He must be a stranger in these parts, or he wouldn't ask about the road to Moose Ridge.\"  It was nearly noon when Andy came in sight of the lumber camp. From a distance he heard the ringing sounds of the axes, and the shouts of the men to \"stand from under\" as a mighty monarch of the forest was about to fall. Skirting the \"yard,\" he approached the building which was known as the office.  \"Is Mr. Storburgh around?\" he asked, of the young man in charge.  \"He is not,\" was the reply, and the clerk scarcely looked up from the sheet upon which he was figuring.  \"When will he be here?\"  \"I don't know--he's gone to New York.\"  \"Do you know if he has an opening for a chopper, or on the teams?\"  \"No opening whatever. We laid off four men last week, and we're going to lay off four more this coming Saturday.\"  The clerk went on figuring, and in silence Andy withdrew. He had had a walk of nearly five miles for nothing. Was it any wonder that he was disheartened?  \"It's the same story everywhere,\" he told himself, as he moved away slowly. \"I might tramp to the Elroy place--that's six miles from here--but what's the use? I'll wear out boot-leather for nothing. I guess Uncle Si and I will have to pull up stakes or starve.\"  Not knowing what else to do, Andy walked along to where a number of men were at work. Just then the twelve o'clock whistle sounded, and the workers \"knocked off\" for their midday meal.  \"Hello, Andy!\" sung out a cheery voice, and, turning, the boy saw a brawny chopper named Bill Carrow approaching. Carrow had once worked with Mr. Graham, and knew the son fairly well.  \"Hello,\" returned the youth. \"Going to feed the inner man?\" and he smiled.  \"That's what, son. How are you?\" And the lumberman shook hands.  \"Fairly well, but I'd feel better if I had a job.\"  \"Out of work, eh? That's too bad. I don't suppose there is any opening here.\"  \"The clerk said there wasn't any--said they were discharging hands instead of taking 'em on.\"  \"That's true. Business is bad--account of the panic last year, you know.\" Bill Carrow paused a moment. \"Had your dinner?\"  \"No, but I can wait until----\"  \"You ain't going to wait. You come with me and I'll fill you up. Your father did the same for me many a time. Come on.\"  Andy was hungry, and could not resist this kindly invitation. Soon the pair were eating a plain but substantial dinner, which Carrow procured from the camp cook. It was disposed of in a corner of the mess cabin, apart from the other lumbermen. As they ate the lumberman asked the youth about himself and his uncle.  \"That uncle of yours ought to be ashamed of himself, that's my opinion of it,\" said Bill Carrow. \"If I was you, I'd not lift my finger to support him. He was the laziest young feller I ever knew, and it's nothing but laziness now. He ought to be supporting you instead of you supporting him.\"  \"I can support myself--if he'd only leave me alone and not try to get my money away from me.\"  \"He squandered that money your father left--I know all about it. I'd make him go to work.\"  \"I can't make him do anything.\"  \"The boys ought to go over and ride him on a rail, or tar and feather him. I guess that would wake him up.\"  \"Oh, I hope they don't do that! He's a bad man when he gets in a rage.\" Andy did not want any more trouble than had already fallen to his portion.  \"By the way, Andy, did a man named Hopton call on you lately?\" asked Carrow, after a pause.  \"Hopton? I never heard of him. Who is he?\"  \"Why, as near as I can learn, he is a real estate man--deals in timber and farm lands. He came here a week or so ago, thinking you had a job here. I told him where you lived, and I supposed he called on you.\"  \"I didn't see him. What did he want?\"  \"He wouldn't say--leastwise, I didn't ask him, seeing's it was none of my business. But he did ask me, confidential like--after he found out that I had known your father well--"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/38968"],["title","First at the North Pole; Or, Two Boys in the Arctic Circle (#2)"],["body","your folks had any timber lands over in Michigan.\"  \"Oh!\" Andy uttered the exclamation before he had time to think. \"Did he--that is, did he ask about any land in particular?\"  \"No. I told him I didn't think you owned any land anywhere. He looked satisfied at that and went away. But I thought he called on you.\"  \"Where was he from?\"  \"I don't know. But they might tell you at the office. Have you got any land?\"  It was an awkward question. Andy did not wish to tell a falsehood, nor did he wish to disclose the secret left by his parent. He bit off a mouthful of bread and pretended to choke upon it.  \"Hi, look out, or you'll choke to death!\" cried Bill Carrow, slapping him on the back. Then Andy ran to the door and continued to cough, until the awkward question was forgotten. Other workmen came up, and the talk became general. Perhaps Carrow suspected that the boy did not wish to answer him, for he did not refer to the matter again.  After thanking his friend for the dinner, Andy walked back to the office. He found the clerk smoking a pipe and reading a Bangor newspaper, having finished his midday meal a few minutes previously.  \"It's no use,\" he said, as Andy came in. \"We can't possibly take you on.\"  \"I came back to get a little information, if you'll be kind enough to give it. Do you know a man named Hopton?\"  \"Why, yes. I suppose you mean A. Q. Hopton, the real estate dealer.\"  \"Does he deal in timber lands?\"  \"I think he does.\"  \"Where is he from?\"  \"He has an office in Portland, and another in Grand Rapids, Michigan.\"  \"Do you know where he is now?\"  \"No. He was here on business some days ago. Perhaps he went back to Portland.\"  \"Thank you.\"  \"Want to buy a few thousand acres of land?\" and the clerk chuckled at his joke.  \"No, I thought I could sell him a linen duster to keep the icicles off when he's on the road,\" answered Andy, with a grin. And then, as there seemed nothing more to say, he walked away, and was soon leaving the Storburgh lumber camp behind him.  What he had heard set him to thinking deeply. What did this A. Q. Hopton know about the lumber tract in Michigan? Was it valuable, and did it really belong to his father's estate?  \"I wish I knew more about such things,\" mused Andy. \"The last time I tried to read the papers over I couldn't make head or tail of them. I guess it would take a smart lawyer to get to the bottom of it--and a lawyer would want a lot of money for the work. I wonder----\" And then Andy came to a sudden halt.  Was it possible that Mr. A. Q. Hopton had called at the cabin during his absence and interviewed Uncle Si? And if so, how much had Uncle Si been able to tell the real estate dealer? Had the two gone on a hunt for the papers, and, if so, had they found the documents?  \"If Uncle Si has gone into any kind of a deal on this without consulting me, I'll--I'll bring him to account for it!\" cried the youth, vehemently. \"After this he has got to leave my affairs alone. He lost that fifteen hundred dollars--he's not going to lose that timber land, too.\"  It occurred to Andy that the best thing he could do would be to get home at once and interview his uncle. For the time being he lost his interest in looking for work, and also lost his desire to go gunning.  \"I've tramped far enough for one day, anyway,\" he told himself. \"I'll just stop at the store for a few things, and then go straight home.\"  It was a long walk to the village, and once there he was glad enough to rest while the storekeeper put up the few things he desired. These he paid for in cash, for he did not wish to risk a refusal should he ask for trust.  \"Your uncle was here--got some tobacco,\" said the storekeeper. \"He said you would pay for it.\"  \"He'll have to pay for it himself, Mr. Sands,\" answered Andy, firmly.  \"Yes? All right, Andy, just as you say.\"  \"I pay for what I buy, and he can do the same.\"  \"Well, I don't blame you, my boy.\" And the look of the storekeeper spoke volumes. He handed over some change that was due. \"By the way, did you know there was a real estate dealer in town to see you?\" he inquired.  \"A Mr. Hopton?\"  \"That's the man.\"  \"When?\"  \"To-day,--only a few hours ago. I was telling him where you lived when your uncle came along for the tobacco. They talked a while together, and then went off.\"  \"Towards our place?\"  \"Yes, they took that road. The real estate man had a sleigh, and your uncle got in with him.\"  \"What did Mr. Hopton want?\"  \"I don't know exactly. I heard some words about papers, and your uncle said he had them. Mr. Hopton said something about three hundred dollars in cash--but I don't know what it was.\"  Andy's heart leaped into his throat. Was it possible that his uncle had found the timber claim papers, and was going to let Mr. A. Q. Hopton have them for three hundred dollars?  \"He sha'n't do it--I'll stop him--I must stop him!\" the boy told himself, and catching up his bundles he left the general store, and struck out for home as fast as his tired limbs would carry him.     CHAPTER III  SOME PAPERS OF VALUE   Ever since his father had left him the papers Andy had thought they might be of considerable value, but now he was more convinced than ever of their importance.  \"For all I know, that claim may be worth a fortune,\" he reasoned. \"Anyway, it's worth something, or that man wouldn't be so anxious to get the papers.\"  The youth tried his best to increase his speed, but the snow was deep in spots, and his long journey to the Storburgh camp had tired him, so it took some time to get even within sight of the cabin that was his home. To the rear, under the shed, he saw a horse and cutter.  \"He is there, that's sure,\" he told himself. \"I wonder what they are doing?\"  The path to the cabin wound in and out among some trees, so that those inside could not witness his approach unless they were on the watch. As the youth came closer a sudden thought struck him, and he darted behind some bushes, made a detour, and came up in the shed. Here there was a back door opening into a summer kitchen.  Placing his bundles on a shelf in the shed, Andy softly opened the door to the summer kitchen and entered the place. Here there was another door, opening into the general living room of the cabin. It was not well hung, and stood open several inches.  \"Well, I know something about timber lands,\" he heard his uncle saying. \"If they are wuth anything, they are generally wuth considerable.\"  \"I am offering you more than this claim is worth,\" was the reply from Mr. A. Q. Hopton. He was standing in front of the fire warming himself, while Josiah Graham was hunched up in his usual attitude in the easy chair. Both men were smoking cigars, the real estate man having stood treat.  \"Wot makes you so anxious to git the papers?\" went on Josiah Graham.  \"My client simply wants to clear away this flaw, as I told you,\" answered A. Q. Hopton, smoothly. \"Of course he could go ahead and claim everything just as it is, and I don't think you could do a thing, but he prefers to treat everybody right. Mr. Graham gave a hundred dollars for this claim, so when you get three hundred for it you are getting a big price.\"  \"Humph!\" Josiah Graham fell back on his favorite exclamation. \"If I--that is, if I let you have them papers, Andy may object.\"  \"How can he? You're his guardian, aren't you?\"  \"Sure I am, but----\"  \"Then you have a right to do as you please. You don't want me to buy the papers from him, do you?\"  \"No! no! You give the money to me!\" cried Josiah Graham, in alarm. \"He don't know the vally of a dollar, an' I do. If he had thet three hundred dollars he'd squander it in no time.\"  \"Very well, give me the papers and I'll write you out a check.\"  \"Can't you give me cash? It ain't no easy matter fer me to git a check cashed up here.\" Josiah Graham did not add that he was afraid the check might be worthless, although that was in his mind.  \"I don't carry three hundred dollars in my clothes. I can give you fifty in cash though,\" went on the real estate agent, as he saw the old man's face fall. \"And if you wish, I'll get one of the lumber bosses up here to vouch for the check.\"  \"Humph! I suppose thet will have to do then. But--er--one thing more, Mr. Hopton----\"  \"What is that?\"  Josiah Graham leaned forward anxiously.  \"Don't you let the boy know about this right away. You give me a chanct to tell him myself.\"  \"Just as you wish. You're his guardian, and I'll not interfere with you. Get the papers and I'll give you the check and the cash right now.\" And the real estate agent drew a pocketbook and a checkbook from his inside coat.  Andy had listened to the conversation with bated breath. So far as worldly experience went he was but a boy, yet he realized that, in some way, this Mr. A. Q. Hopton was trying to swindle him out of his inheritance, and that his Uncle Si was willing to aid the schemer just for the sake of getting possession of the three hundred dollars.  As his uncle arose to enter the room in which his nephew slept, the boy slipped into the cabin. Like a flash he darted to his bedroom, jumped inside, and shut and bolted the door after him.  \"Hi there! What's this?\" cried the real estate dealer, in astonishment.  \"It's--it's the boy, my nevvy!\" gasped Josiah Graham. \"He come in through the back door! He must have been a-listenin' to our talk.\"  \"Is that so? That's too bad.\" The real estate agent was dazed by the sudden turn of affairs. \"He had a gun with him.\"  \"Yes, he took it with him when he went for work.\" Josiah Graham walked over to the door and tried it. \"Andy, open that door.\"  \"I will not,\" was the answer.  \"Was you a-listenin' to our talk?\"  \"I was.\"  \"Humph! Nice thing fer a boy to do!\"  \"I guess I had a right to listen,\" was the cool answer. As he spoke, Andy was examining the box in which he had stored the papers. He found things much disarranged, showing that his uncle had gone through the contents during his absence. But the papers were there, and the sight of them caused him to breathe"]]]
