I may not know, my God; no hand revealeth              Thy counsels wise;   Along the path a deepening shadow stealeth,              No voice replies   To all my questioning thought, the time to tell,              And it is well.    Let me keep on, abiding and unfearing                Thy will always,   Through a long century's ripening fruition,                Or a short day's.   Thou canst not come too soon; and I can wait              If thou come late.     ON THE SHORE.      The punctual tide draws up the bay,     With ripple of wave and hiss of spray,   And the great red flower of the light-house tower     Blooms on the headland far away.      Petal by petal its fiery rose     Out of the darkness buds and grows;   A dazzling shape on the dim, far cape,     A beckoning shape as it comes and goes.      A moment of bloom, and then it dies     On the windy cliff 'twixt the sea and skies.   The fog laughs low to see it go,     And the white waves watch it with cruel eyes.      Then suddenly out of the mist-cloud dun,     As touched and wooed by unseen sun,   Again into sight bursts the rose of light     And opens its petals one by one.      Ah, the storm may be wild and the sea be strong,     And man is weak and the darkness long,   But while blossoms the flower on the light-house tower     There still is place for a smile and a song.     AMONG THE LILIES.      She stood among the lilies       In sunset's brightest ray,     Among the tall June lilies,       As stately fair as they;   And I, a boyish lover then,   Looked once, and, lingering, looked again,      And life began that day.      She sat among the lilies,       My sweet, all lily-pale;     The summer lilies listened,       I whispered low my tale.   O golden anthers, breathing balm,   O hush of peace, O twilight calm,       Did you or I prevail?      She lies among the lily-snows,       Beneath the wintry sky;     All round her and about her       The buried lilies lie.   They will awake at touch of Spring,   And she, my fair and flower-like thing,       In spring-time--by and by.     NOVEMBER.        Dry leaves upon the wall,   Which flap like rustling wings and seek escape,   A single frosted cluster on the grape       Still hangs--and that is all.        It hangs forgotten quite,--   Forgotten in the purple vintage-day,   Left for the sharp and cruel frosts to slay,       The daggers of the night.        It knew the thrill of spring;   It had its blossom-time, its perfumed noons;   Its pale-green spheres were rounded to soft runes       Of summer's whispering.        Through balmy morns of May;   Through fragrances of June and bright July,   And August, hot and still, it hung on high       And purpled day by day.        Of fair and mantling shapes,   No braver, fairer cluster on the tree;   And what then is this thing has come to thee       Among the other grapes,        Thou lonely tenant of the leafless vine,   Granted the right to grow thy mates beside,   To ripen thy sweet juices, but denied       Thy place among the wine?        Ah! we are dull and blind.   The riddle is too hard for us to guess   The why of joy or of unhappiness,       Chosen or left behind.        But everywhere a host   Of lonely lives shall read their type in thine:   Grapes which may never swell the tale of wine,       Left out to meet the frost.     EMBALMED.    This is the street and the dwelling,     Let me count the houses o'er;   Yes,--one, two, three from the corner,     And the house that I love makes four.    That is the very window     Where I used to see her head   Bent over book or needle,     With ivy garlanded.    And the very loop of the curtain,     And the very curve of the vine,   Were full of the grace and the meaning     Which was hers by some right divine.    I began to be glad at the corner,     And all the way to the door   My heart outran my footsteps,     And frolicked and danced before,    In haste for the words of welcome,     The voice, the repose and grace,   And the smile, like a benediction,     Of that beautiful, vanished face.    Now I pass the door, and I pause not,     And I look the other way;   But ever, a waft of fragrance,     Too subtle to name or stay,    Comes the thought of the gracious presence     Which made that past time sweet,   And still to those who remember,     Embalms the house and the street,    Like the breath from some vase, now empty     Of a flowery shape unseen,   Which follows the path of its lover,     To tell where a rose has been.     GINEVRA DEGLI AMIERI.  A STORY OF OLD FLORENCE.    So it is come! The doctor's glossy smile   Deceives me not. I saw him shake his head,   Whispering, and heard poor Giulia sob without,   As, slowly creaking, he went down the stair.   Were they afraid that I should be afraid?   I, who had died once and been laid in tomb?   They need not.                    Little one, look not so pale.   I am not raving. Ah! you never heard   The story. Climb up there upon the bed:   Sit close, and listen. After this one day   I shall not tell you stories any more.    How old are you, my rose? What! almost twelve?   Almost a woman? Scarcely more than that   Was your fair mother when she bore her bud;   And scarcely more was I when, long years since,   I left my father's house, a bride in May.   You know the house, beside St. Andrea's church,   Gloomy and rich, which stands, and seems to frown   On the Mercato, humming at its base;   And hold on high, out of the common reach,   The lilies and carved shields above its door;   And, higher yet, to catch and woo the sun,   A little loggia set against the sky?   That was my play-place ever as a child;   And with me used to play a kinsman's son,   Antonio Rondinelli. Ah, dear days!   Two happy things we were, with none to chide   Or hint that life was anything but play.    Sudden the play-time ended. All at once   \"You must be wed,\" they told me. \"What is wed?\"   I asked; but with the word I bent my brow,   Let them put on the garland, smiled to see   The glancing jewels tied about my neck;   And so, half-pleased, half-puzzled, was led forth   By my grave husband, older than my sire.    O the long years that followed! It would seem   That the sun never shone in all those years,   Or only with a sudden, troubled glint   Flashed on Antonio's curls, as he went by   Doffing his cap, with eyes of wistful love   Raised to my face,--my conscious, woful face.   Were we so much to blame? Our lives had twined   Together, none forbidding, for so long.   They let our childish fingers drop the seed,   Unhindered, which should ripen to tall grain;   They let the firm, small roots tangle and grow,   Then rent them, careless that it hurt the plant.   I loved Antonio, and he loved me.    Life was all shadow, but it was not sin!   I loved Antonio, but I kept me pure,   Not for my husband's sake, but for the sake   Of him, my first-born child, my little child,   Mine for a few short weeks, whose touch, whose look   Thrilled all my soul and thrills it to this day.   I loved; but, hear me swear, I kept me pure!   (Remember that, Madonna, when I come   Before thy throne to-morrow. Be not stern,   Or gaze upon me with reproachful look,   Making my little angel hide his face   And weep, while all the others turn glad eyes   Rejoicing on their mothers.)                                   It was hard   To sit in darkness while the rest had light,   To move to discords when the rest had song,   To be so young and never to have lived.   I bore, as women bear, until one day   Soul said to flesh, \"This I endure no more,\"   And with the word uprose, tore clay apart,   And what was blank before grew blanker still.    It was a fever, so the leeches said.   I had been dead so long, I did not know   The difference, or heed. Oil on my breast,   The garments of the grave about me wrapped,   They bore me forth, and laid me in the tomb.   The rich and beautiful and dreadful tomb,   Where all the buried Amteris lie,   Beneath the Duomo's black and towering shade.    Open the curtain, child. Yes, it is night.   It was night then, when I awoke to feel   That deadly chill, and see by ghostly gleams   Of moonlight, creeping through the grated door,   The coffins of my fathers all about.   Strange, hollow clamors rang and echoed back,   As, struggling out of mine, I dropped and fell.   With frantic strength I beat upon the grate.   It yielded to my touch. Some careless hand   Had left the bolt half-slipped. My father swore   Afterward, with a curse, he would make sure   Next time. NEXT TIME. That hurts me even now!    Dead or alive I issued, scarce sure which.   High overhead Giotto's tower soared;   Behind, the Duomo rose all white and black;   Then pealed a sudden jargoning of bells,   And down the darkling street I wildly fled,   Led by a little, cold, and wandering moon,   Which seemed as lonely and as lost as I.   I had no aim, save to reach warmth and light   And human touch; but still my witless steps   Led to my husband's door, and there I stopped,   By instinct, knocked, and called.                                        A window oped.   A voice--t'was his--demanded: \"Who is there?\"   \"Tis I, Ginevra.\" Then I heard the tone   Change into horror, and he prayed aloud   And called upon the saints, the while I urged,   \"O, let me in, Francesco; let me in!   I am so cold, so frightened, let me in!\"   Then, with a crash, the window was shut fast;   And, though I cried and beat upon the door   And wailed aloud, no other answer came.    Weeping, I turned away, and feebly strove   Down the hard distance towards my father's house.   \"They will have pity and will let me in,\"   I thought. \"They loved me and will let me in.\"   Cowards! At the high window overhead"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4560"],["title","Verses (#2)"],["body","stood and trembled, while I plead and prayed:   \"I am your child, Ginevra. Let me in!   I am not dead. In mercy, let me in!\"   \"The holy saints forbid!\" declared my sire.   My mother sobbed and vowed whole pounds of wax   To St. Eustachio, would he but remove   This fearful presence from her door. Then sharp   Came click of lock, and a long tube was thrust   From out the window, and my brother cried,   \"Spirit or devil, go! or else I fire!\"    Where should I go? Back to the ghastly tomb   And the cold coffined ones? Up the long street,   Wringing my hands and sobbing low, I went.   My feet were bare and bleeding from the stones;   My hands were bleeding too; my hair hung loose   Over my shroud. So wild and strange a shape   Saw never Florence since. The people call   That street through which I walked and wrung my hands   \"Street of the Dead One,\" even to this day.   The sleeping houses stood in midnight black,   And not a soul was in the streets but I.    At last I saw a flickering point of light   High overhead, in a dim window set.   I had lain down to die; but at the sight   I rose, crawled on, and with expiring strength   Knocked, sank again, and knew not even then   It was Antonio's door by which I lay.    A window opened, and a voice called out:   \"Qui e?\" \"I am Ginevra.\" And I thought,   \"Now he will fall to trembling, like the rest,   And bid me hence.\" But, lo! a moment more   The bolts were drawn, and arms whose very touch   Was life, lifted and clasped and bore me in.   \"O ghost or angel of my buried love,   I know not, care not which, be welcome here!   Welcome, thrice welcome, to this heart of mine!\"   I heard him say, and then I heard no more.    It was high noontide when I woke again,   To hear fierce voices wrangling by my bed,--   My father's and my husband's; for, with dawn,   Gathering up valor, they had sought the tomb,   Had found me gone, and tracked my bleeding feet   Over the pavement to Antonio's door.   Dead, they cared nothing: living, I was, theirs.   Hot raged the quarrel; then came Justice in,   And to the court we swept--I in my shroud--   To try the cause.               This was the verdict given:   \"A woman who has been to burial borne,   Made fast and left and locked in with the dead;   Who at her husband's door has stood and plead   For entrance, and has heard her prayer denied;   Who from her father's house is urged and chased,   Must be adjudged as dead in law and fact.    The Court pronounces the defendant--dead!   She can resume her former ties at will,   Or may renounce them, if such be her will.   She is no more a daughter, or a spouse,   Unless she choose, and is set free to form   New ties, if so she choose.\"                             O, blessed words!   That very day we knelt before the priest,   My love and I, were wed, and life began.    Child of my child, child of Antonio's child,   Bend down and let me kiss your wondering face.   'Tis a strange tale to tell a rose like you.   But time is brief, and, had I told you not,   Haply the story would have met your ears   From them, the Amieri, my own blood,   Now turned to gall, whose foul and bitter lips   Will wag with lies when once my lips are dumb.   (Pardon me, Virgin. I was gentle once,   And thou hast seen my wrongs. Thou wilt forgive.)   Now go, my dearest. When they wake thee up,   To tell thee I am dead, be not too sad.   I, who have died once, do not fear to die.    Sweet was that waking, sweeter will be this.   Close to Heaven's gate my own Antonio sits   Waiting, and, spite of all the Frati say,   I know I shall not stand long at that gate,   Or knock and be refused an entrance there,   For he will start up when lie hears my voice,   The saints will smile, and he will open quick.   Only a night to part me from that joy.   Jesu Maria! let the dawning come.       EASTER LILIES.    Darlings of June and brides of summer sun,     Chill pipes the stormy wind, the skies are drear;   Dull and despoiled the gardens every one:       What do you here?    We looked to see your gracious blooms arise     Mid soft and wooing airs in gardens green,   Where venturesome brown bees and butterflies       Should hail you queen.    Here is no bee nor glancing butterfly;     They fled on rapid wings before the snow:   Your sister lilies laid them down to die,       Long, long ago.    And here, amid the slowly dropping rain,     We keep our Easter feast, with hearts whose care   Mars the high cadence of each lofty strain,       Each thankful prayer.    But not a shadow dims your joyance sweet,     No baffled hope or memory darkly clad;   You lay your whiteness at the Lord's dear feet,       And are all glad.    O coward soul! arouse thee and draw near,     Led by these fragrant acolytes to-day!   Let their sweet confidence rebuke thy fear,       Thy cold delay.    Come with thy darkness to the healing light,     Come with thy bitter, which shall be made sweet,   And lay thy soil beside the lilies white,       At His dear feet!     EBB-TIDE.    Long reaches of wet grasses sway   Where ran the sea but yesterday,   And white-winged boats at sunset drew   To anchor in the crimsoning blue.   The boats lie on the grassy plain,   Nor tug nor fret at anchor chain;   Their errand done, their impulse spent,   Chained by an alien element,   With sails unset they idly lie,   Though morning beckons brave and nigh;   Like wounded birds, their flight denied,   They lie, and long and wait the tide.    About their keels, within the net   Of tough grass fibres green and wet,   A myriad thirsty creatures, pent   In sorrowful imprisonment,   Await the beat, distinct and sweet,   Of the white waves' returning feet.   My soul their vigil joins, and shares   A nobler discontent than theirs;   Athirst like them, I patiently   Sit listening beside the sea,   And still the waters outward glide:   When is the turning of the tide?    Come, pulse of God; come, heavenly thrill!   We wait thy coming,--and we will.   The world is vast, and very far   Its utmost verge and boundaries are;   But thou hast kept thy word to-day   In India and in dim Cathay,   And the same mighty care shall reach   Each humblest rock-pool of this beach.   The gasping fish, the stranded keel,   This dull dry soul of mine, shall feel   Thy freshening touch, and, satisfied,   Shall drink the fulness of the tide.     FLOOD-TIDE.    All night the thirsty beach has listening lain,      With patience dumb,   Counting the slow, sad moments of her pain;      Now morn has come,   And with the morn the punctual tide again.    I hear the white battalions down the bay      Charge with a cheer;   The sun's gold lances prick them on their way,--      They plunge, they rear,--   Foam-plumed and snowy-pennoned, they are here!    The roused shore, her bright hair backward blown,      Stands on the verge   And waves a smiling welcome, beckoning on      The flying surge,   While round her feet, like doves, the billows crowd and urge.    Her glad lips quaff the salt, familiar wine;      Her spent urns fill;   All hungering creatures know the sound, the sign,--      Quiver and thrill,   With glad expectance crowd and banquet at their will.    I, too, the rapt contentment join and share;      My tide is full;   There is new happiness in earth, in air:      All beautiful   And fresh the world but now so bare and dull.    But while we raise the cup of bliss so high,      Thus satisfied,   Another shore beneath a sad, far sky      Waiteth her tide,   And thirsts with sad complainings still denied.    On earth's remotest bound she sits and waits      In doubt and pain;   Our joy is signal for her sad estates;      Like dull refrain   Marring our song, her sighings rise in vain.    To each his turn--the ebb-tide and the flood,      The less, the more--   God metes his portions justly out, I know;      But still before   My mind forever floats that pale and grieving shore.     A YEAR.    She has been just a year in Heaven.   Unmarked by white moon or gold sun,   By stroke of clock or clang of bell,   Or shadow lengthening on the way,   In the full noon and perfect day,   In Safety's very citadel,   The happy hours have sped, have run;   And, rapt in peace, all pain forgot,   She whom we love, her white soul shriven,   Smiles at the thought and wonders not.    We have been just a year alone,--   A year whose calendar is sighs,   And dull, perpetual wishfulness,   And smiles, each covert for a tear,   And wandering thoughts, half there, half here,   And weariful attempts to guess   The secret of the hiding skies,   The soft, inexorable blue,   With gleaming hints of glory sown,   And Heaven behind, just shining through.    So sweet, so sad, so swift, so slow,   So full of eager growth and light,   So full of pain which blindly grows,   So full of thoughts which either way   Have passed and crossed and touched each day,   To us a thorn, to her a rose;   The year so black, the year so white,   Like rivers twain their course have run;   The earthly stream we trace and know,   But who shall paint the heavenly one?    A year! We gather up our powers,   Our lamps we consecrate and trim;   Open all windows to the day,   And welcome every heavenly air.   We will press forward and will bear,   Having this word to cheer the way:   She, storm-tossed once, is safe with Him,   Healed, comforted, content, forgiven;   And while we count these heavy hours   Has been a year,--a year in Heaven.     TOKENS.    Each day upon the yellow Nile, 'tis said.   Joseph, the youthful ruler, cast forth wheat,   That haply, floating to his father's feet,--   The sad old father, who believed him dead,--   It might be sign in Egypt there was bread;   And thus the patriarch, past the desert sands   And scant oasis fringed with thirsty green,   Be lured toward the love that yearned unseen.   So, flung and scattered--ah! by what dear hands?--   On the swift-rushing and invisible tide,   Small tokens drift adown from far, fair lands,   And say "]]]
