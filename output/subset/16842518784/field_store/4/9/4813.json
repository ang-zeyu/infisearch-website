What the Backwoods of Canada are to the industrious and ever-to-be-honoured sons of honest poverty, and what they are to the refined and accomplished gentleman, these simple sketches will endeavour to portray. They are drawn principally from my own experience, during a sojourn of nineteen years in the colony.  In order to diversify my subject, and make it as amusing as possible, I have between the sketches introduced a few small poems, all written during my residence in Canada, and descriptive of the country.  In this pleasing task, I have been assisted by my husband, J. W. Dunbar Moodie, author of “Ten Years in South Africa.”  BELLEVILLE, UPPER CANADA     CANADA    Canada, the blest--the free!   With prophetic glance, I see   Visions of thy future glory,   Giving to the world's great story   A page, with mighty meaning fraught,   That asks a wider range of thought.   Borne onward on the wings of Time,   I trace thy future course sublime;   And feel my anxious lot grow bright,   While musing on the glorious sight;--   My heart rejoicing bounds with glee   To hail thy noble destiny!    Even now thy sons inherit   All thy British mother's spirit.   Ah! no child of bondage thou;   With her blessing on thy brow,   And her deathless, old renown   Circling thee with freedom's crown,   And her love within thy heart,   Well may'st thou perform thy part,   And to coming years proclaim   Thou art worthy of her name.   Home of the homeless!--friend to all   Who suffer on this earthly ball!   On thy bosom sickly care   Quite forgets her squalid lair;   Gaunt famine, ghastly poverty   Before thy gracious aspect fly,   And hopes long crush'd, grow bright again,   And, smiling, point to hill and plain.    By thy winter's stainless snow,   Starry heavens of purer glow,   Glorious summers, fervid, bright,   Basking in one blaze of light;   By thy fair, salubrious clime;   By thy scenery sublime;   By thy mountains, streams, and woods;   By thy everlasting floods;   If greatness dwells beneath the skies,   Thou to greatness shalt arise!    Nations old, and empires vast,   From the earth had darkly pass'd   Ere rose the fair auspicious morn   When thou, the last, not least, wast born.   Through the desert solitude   Of trackless waters, forests rude,   Thy guardian angel sent a cry   All jubilant of victory!   “Joy,” she cried, “to th' untill'd earth,   Let her joy in a mighty birth,--   Night from the land has pass'd away,   The desert basks in noon of day.   Joy, to the sullen wilderness,   I come, her gloomy shades to bless,   To bid the bear and wild-cat yield   Their savage haunts to town and field.   Joy, to stout hearts and willing hands,   That win a right to these broad lands,   And reap the fruit of honest toil,   Lords of the rich, abundant soil.    “Joy, to the sons of want, who groan   In lands that cannot feed their own;   And seek, in stern, determined mood,   Homes in the land of lake and wood,   And leave their hearts' young hopes behind,   Friends in this distant world to find;   Led by that God, who from His throne   Regards the poor man's stifled moan.   Like one awaken'd from the dead,   The peasant lifts his drooping head,   Nerves his strong heart and sunburnt hand,   To win a potion of the land,   That glooms before him far and wide   In frowning woods and surging tide   No more oppress'd, no more a slave,   Here freedom dwells beyond the wave.    “Joy, to those hardy sires who bore   The day's first heat--their toils are o'er;   Rude fathers of this rising land,   Theirs was a mission truly grand.   Brave peasants whom the Father, God,   Sent to reclaim the stubborn sod;   Well they perform'd their task, and won   Altar and hearth for the woodman's son.   Joy, to Canada's unborn heirs,   A deathless heritage is theirs;   For, sway'd by wise and holy laws,   Its voice shall aid the world's great cause,   Shall plead the rights of man, and claim   For humble worth an honest name;   Shall show the peasant-born can be,   When call'd to action, great and free.   Like fire, within the flint conceal'd,   By stern necessity reveal'd,   Kindles to life the stupid sod,   Image of perfect man and God.    “Joy, to thy unborn sons, for they   Shall hail a brighter, purer day;   When peace and Christian brotherhood   Shall form a stronger tie than blood--   And commerce, freed from tax and chain,   Shall build a bridge o'er earth and main;   And man shall prize the wealth of mind,   The greatest blessing to mankind;   True Christians, both in word and deed,   Ready in virtue's cause to bleed,   Against a world combined to stand,   And guard the honour of the land.   Joy, to the earth, when this shall be,   Time verges on eternity.”     CHAPTER I  A VISIT TO GROSSE ISLE     Alas! that man's stern spirit e'er should mar   A scene so pure--so exquisite as this.   The dreadful cholera was depopulating Quebec and Montreal when our ship cast anchor off Grosse Isle, on the 30th of August 1832, and we were boarded a few minutes after by the health-officers.  One of these gentlemen--a little, shrivelled-up Frenchman--from his solemn aspect and attenuated figure, would have made no bad representative of him who sat upon the pale horse. He was the only grave Frenchman I had ever seen, and I naturally enough regarded him as a phenomenon. His companion--a fine-looking fair-haired Scotchman--though a little consequential in his manners, looked like one who in his own person could combat and vanquish all the evils which flesh is heir to. Such was the contrast between these doctors, that they would have formed very good emblems, one, of vigorous health, the other, of hopeless decay.  Our captain, a rude, blunt north-country sailor, possessing certainly not more politeness than might be expected in a bear, received his sprucely dressed visitors on the deck, and, with very little courtesy, abruptly bade them follow him down into the cabin.  The officials were no sooner seated, than glancing hastily round the place, they commenced the following dialogue:--  “From what port, captain?”  Now, the captain had a peculiar language of his own, from which he commonly expunged all the connecting links. Small words, such as “and” and “the,” he contrived to dispense with altogether.  “Scotland--sailed from port o' Leith, bound for Quebec, Montreal-- general cargo--seventy-two steerage, four cabin passengers--brig Anne, one hundred and ninety-two tons burden, crew eight hands.”  Here he produced his credentials, and handed them to the strangers. The Scotchman just glanced over the documents, and laid them on the table.  “Had you a good passage out?”  “Tedious, baffling winds, heavy fogs, detained three weeks on Banks--foul weather making Gulf--short of water, people out of provisions, steerage passengers starving.”  “Any case of sickness or death on board?”  “All sound as crickets.”  “Any births?” lisped the little Frenchman.  The captain screwed up his mouth, and after a moment's reflection he replied, “Births? Why, yes; now I think on't, gentlemen, we had one female on board, who produced three at a birth.”  “That's uncommon,” said the Scotch doctor, with an air of lively curiosity. “Are the children alive and well? I should like much to see them.” He started up, and knocked his head--for he was very tall--against the ceiling. “Confound your low cribs! I have nearly dashed out my brains.”  “A hard task, that,” looked the captain to me. He did not speak, but I knew by his sarcastic grin what was uppermost in his thoughts. “The young ones all males--fine thriving fellows. Step upon deck, Sam Frazer,” turning to his steward; “bring them down for doctors to see.” Sam vanished, with a knowing wink to his superior, and quickly returned, bearing in his arms three fat, chuckle-headed bull-terriers, the sagacious mother following close at his heels, and looked ready to give and take offence on the slightest provocation.  “Here, gentlemen, are the babies,” said Frazer, depositing his burden on the floor. “They do credit to the nursing of the brindled slut.”  The old tar laughed, chuckled, and rubbed his hands in an ecstacy of delight at the indignation and disappointment visible in the countenance of the Scotch Esculapius, who, angry as he was, wisely held his tongue. Not so the Frenchman; his rage scarcely knew bounds--he danced in a state of most ludicrous excitement, he shook his fist at our rough captain, and screamed at the top of his voice--  “Sacre, you bete! You tink us dog, ven you try to pass your puppies on us for babies?”  “Hout, man, don't be angry,” said the Scotchman, stifling a laugh; “you see 'tis only a joke!”  “Joke! me no understand such joke. Bete!” returned the angry Frenchman, bestowing a savage kick on one of the unoffending pups which was frisking about his feet. The pup yelped; the slut barked and leaped furiously at the offender, and was only kept from biting him by Sam, who could scarcely hold her back for laughing; the captain was uproarious; the offended Frenchman alone maintained a severe and dignified aspect. The dogs were at length dismissed, and peace restored.  After some further questioning from the officials, a Bible was required for the captain to take an oath. Mine was mislaid, and there was none at hand.  “Confound it!” muttered the old sailor, tossing over the papers in his desk; “that scoundrel, Sam, always stows my traps out of the way.” Then taking up from the table a book which I had been reading, which happened to be Voltaire's History of Charles XII., he presented it, with as grave an air as he could assume, to the Frenchman. Taking for granted that it was the volume required, the little doctor was too polite to open the book, the captain was duly sworn, and the party returned to the deck.  Here a new difficulty occurred, which nearly ended in a serious quarrel. The gentlemen requested the old sailor to give them a few feet of old planking, to repair some damage which their boat had sustained the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4389"],["title","Roughing It in the Bush (#2)"],["body","before. This the captain could not do. They seemed to think his refusal intentional, and took it as a personal affront. In no very gentle tones, they ordered him instantly to prepare his boats, and put his passengers on shore.  “Stiff breeze--short sea,” returned the bluff old seaman; “great risk in making land--boats heavily laden with women and children will be swamped. Not a soul goes on shore this night.”  “If you refuse to comply with our orders, we will report you to the authorities.”  “I know my duty--you stick to yours. When the wind falls off, I'll see to it. Not a life shall be risked to please you or your authorities.”  He turned upon his heel, and the medical men left the vessel in great disdain. We had every reason to be thankful for the firmness displayed by our rough commander. That same evening we saw eleven persons drowned, from another vessel close beside us while attempting to make the shore.  By daybreak all was hurry and confusion on board the Anne. I watched boat after boat depart for the island, full of people and goods, and envied them the glorious privilege of once more standing firmly on the earth, after two long months of rocking and rolling at sea. How ardently we anticipate pleasure, which often ends in positive pain! Such was my case when at last indulged in the gratification so eagerly desired. As cabin passengers, we were not included in the general order of purification, but were only obliged to send our servant, with the clothes and bedding we had used during the voyage, on shore, to be washed.  The ship was soon emptied of all her live cargo. My husband went off with the boats, to reconnoitre the island, and I was left alone with my baby in the otherwise empty vessel. Even Oscar, the Captain's Scotch terrier, who had formed a devoted attachment to me during the voyage, forgot his allegiance, became possessed of the land mania, and was away with the rest. With the most intense desire to go on shore, I was doomed to look and long and envy every boatful of emigrants that glided past. Nor was this all; the ship was out of provisions, and I was condemned to undergo a rigid fast until the return of the boat, when the captain had promised a supply of fresh butter and bread. The vessel had been nine weeks at sea; the poor steerage passengers for the two last weeks had been out of food, and the captain had been obliged to feed them from the ship's stores. The promised bread was to be obtained from a small steam-boat, which plied daily between Quebec and the island, transporting convalescent emigrants and their goods in her upward trip, and provisions for the sick on her return.  How I reckoned on once more tasting bread and butter! The very thought of the treat in store served to sharpen my appetite, and render the long fast more irksome. I could now fully realise all Mrs. Bowdich's longings for English bread and butter, after her three years' travel through the burning African deserts, with her talented husband.  “When we arrived at the hotel at Plymouth,” said she, “and were asked what refreshment we chose--'Tea, and home-made bread and butter,' was my instant reply. 'Brown bread, if you please, and plenty of it.' I never enjoyed any luxury like it. I was positively ashamed of asking the waiter to refill the plate. After the execrable messes, and the hard ship-biscuit, imagine the luxury of a good slice of English bread and butter!”  At home, I laughed heartily at the lively energy with which that charming woman of genius related this little incident in her eventful history--but off Grosse Isle, I realised it all.  As the sun rose above the horizon, all these matter-of-fact circumstances were gradually forgotten, and merged in the surpassing grandeur of the scene that rose majestically before me. The previous day had been dark and stormy, and a heavy fog had concealed the mountain chain, which forms the stupendous background to this sublime view, entirely from our sight. As the clouds rolled away from their grey, bald brows, and cast into denser shadow the vast forest belt that girdled them round, they loomed out like mighty giants--Titans of the earth, in all their rugged and awful beauty--a thrill of wonder and delight pervaded my mind. The spectacle floated dimly on my sight--my eyes were blinded with tears--blinded with the excess of beauty. I turned to the right and to the left, I looked up and down the glorious river; never had I beheld so many striking objects blended into one mighty whole! Nature had lavished all her noblest features in producing that enchanting scene.  The rocky isle in front, with its neat farm-houses at the eastern point, and its high bluff at the western extremity, crowned with the telegraph--the middle space occupied by tents and sheds for the cholera patients, and its wooded shores dotted over with motley groups--added greatly to the picturesque effect of the land scene. Then the broad, glittering river, covered with boats darting to and fro, conveying passengers from twenty-five vessels, of various size and tonnage, which rode at anchor, with their flags flying from the mast-head, gave an air of life and interest to the whole. Turning to the south side of the St. Lawrence, I was not less struck with its low fertile shores, white houses, and neat churches, whose slender spires and bright tin roofs shone like silver as they caught the first rays of the sun. As far as the eye could reach, a line of white buildings extended along the bank; their background formed by the purple hue of the dense, interminable forest. It was a scene unlike any I had ever beheld, and to which Britain contains no parallel. Mackenzie, an old Scotch dragoon, who was one of our passengers, when he rose in the morning, and saw the parish of St. Thomas for the first time, exclaimed: “Weel, it beats a'! Can thae white clouts be a' houses? They look like claes hung out to drie!”  There was some truth in this odd comparison, and for some minutes, I could scarcely convince myself that the white patches scattered so thickly over the opposite shore could be the dwellings of a busy, lively population.  “What sublime views of the north side of the river those habitans of St. Thomas must enjoy,” thought I. Perhaps familiarity with the scene has rendered them indifferent to its astonishing beauty.  Eastward, the view down the St. Lawrence towards the Gulf, is the finest of all, scarcely surpassed by anything in the world. Your eye follows the long range of lofty mountains until their blue summits are blended and lost in the blue of the sky. Some of these, partially cleared round the base, are sprinkled over with neat cottages; and the green slopes that spread around them are covered with flocks and herds. The surface of the splendid river is diversified with islands of every size and shape, some in wood, others partially cleared, and adorned with orchards and white farm-houses. As the early sun streamed upon the most prominent of these, leaving the others in deep shade, the effect was strangely novel and imposing. In more remote regions, where the forest has never yet echoed to the woodman's axe, or received the impress of civilisation, the first approach to the shore inspires a melancholy awe, which becomes painful in its intensity.     Land of vast hills and mighty streams,   The lofty sun that o'er thee beams   On fairer clime sheds not his ray,   When basking in the noon of day   Thy waters dance in silver light,   And o'er them frowning, dark as night,   Thy shadowy forests, soaring high,   Stretch forth beyond the aching eye,   And blend in distance with the sky.    And silence--awful silence broods   Profoundly o'er these solitudes;   Nought but the lapsing of the floods   Breaks the deep stillness of the woods;   A sense of desolation reigns   O'er these unpeopled forest plains.   Where sounds of life ne'er wake a tone   Of cheerful praise round Nature's throne,   Man finds himself with God--alone.   My daydreams were dispelled by the return of the boat, which brought my husband and the captain from the island.  “No bread,” said the latter, shaking his head; “you must be content to starve a little longer. Provision-ship not in till four o'clock.” My husband smiled at the look of blank disappointment with which I received these unwelcome tidings, “Never mind, I have news which will comfort you. The officer who commands the station sent a note to me by an orderly, inviting us to spend the afternoon with him. He promises to show us everything worthy of notice on the island. Captain ---- claims acquaintance with me; but I have not the least recollection of him. Would you like to go?”  “Oh, by all means. I long to see the lovely island. It looks a perfect paradise at this distance.”  The rough sailor-captain screwed his mouth on one side, and gave me one of his comical looks, but he said nothing until he assisted in placing me and the baby in the boat.  “Don't be too sanguine, Mrs. Moodie; many things look well at a distance which are bad enough when near.”  I scarcely regarded the old sailor's warning, so eager was I to go on shore--to put my foot upon the soil of the new world for the first time--I was in no humour to listen to any depreciation of what seemed so beautiful.  It was four o'clock when we landed on the rocks, which the rays of an intensely scorching sun had rendered so hot that I could scarcely place my foot upon them. How the people without shoes bore it, I cannot imagine. Never shall I forget the extraordinary spectacle that met our sight the moment we passed the low range of bushes which formed a screen in front of the river. A crowd of many hundred Irish emigrants had been landed during the present and former day; and all this motley crew--men, women, and children, who were not confined by sickness to the sheds (which greatly resembled cattle-pens) were employed in washing clothes, or spreading them out on the rocks and bushes to dry.  The men and boys were in the"]]]
