There were many suitors for the hand of Clelia Guidascarpi, though her dowry was not the portion of a fat estate.  Her old nurse counselled the brothers that they should consent to her taking a husband.  They fulfilled this duty as one that must be done, and she became sorrowfully the betrothed of a nobleman of Bologna; from which hour she had no cheerfulness.  The brothers quitted Bologna for Venice, where there was the bed of a conspiracy.  On their return they were shaken by rumours of their sister's misconduct.  An Austrian name was allied to hers in busy mouths.  A lady, their distant relative, whose fame was light, had withdrawn her from the silent house, and made display of her.  Since she had seen more than an Italian girl should see, the brothers proposed to the nobleman her betrothed to break the treaty; but he was of a mind to hurry on the marriage, and recollecting now that she was but a woman, the brothers fixed a day for her espousals, tenderly, without reproach.  She had the choice of taking the vows or surrendering her hand.  Her old nurse prayed for the day of her espousals to come with a quicker step.  One night she surprised Count Paul Lenkenstein at Clelia's window. Rinaldo was in the garden below.  He moved to the shadow of a cypress, and was seen moving by the old nurse.  The lover took the single kiss he had come for, was led through the chamber, and passed unchallenged into the street.  Clelia sat between locked doors and darkened windows, feeling colder to the brothers she had been reared with than to all other men upon the earth.  They sent for her after a lapse of hours.  Her old nurse was kneeling at their feet.  Rinaldo asked for the name of her lover.  She answered with it.  Angelo said, \"It will be better for you to die: but if you cannot do so easy a thing as that, prepare widow's garments.\"  They forced her to write three words to Count Paul, calling him to her window at midnight.  Rinaldo fetched a priest: Angelo laid out two swords.  An hour before the midnight, Clelia's old nurse raised the house with her cries.  Clelia was stretched dead in her chamber.  The brothers kissed her in turn, and sat, one at her head, one at her feet. At midnight her lover stood among them.  He was gravely saluted, and bidden to look upon the dead body.  Angelo said to him, \"Had she lived you should have wedded her hand.  She is gone of her own free choice, and one of us follows her.\"  With the sweat of anguish on his forehead, Count Paul drew sword.  The window was barred; six male domestics of the household held high lights in the chamber; the priest knelt beside one corpse, awaiting the other.  Vittoria's imagination could not go beyond that scene, but she looked out on the brother of the slain youth with great pity, and with a strange curiosity.  The example given by Clelia of the possible love of an Italian girl for the white uniform, set her thinking whether so monstrous a fact could ever be doubled in this world.  \"Could it happen to me?\" she asked herself, and smiled, as she half-fashioned the words on her lips, \"It is a pretty uniform.\"  Her reverie was broken by a hiss of \"Traitress!\" from the woman opposite.  She coloured guiltily, tried to speak, and sat trembling.  A divination of intense hatred had perhaps read the thought within her breast: or it was a mere outburst of hate.  The woman's face was like the wearing away of smoke from a spot whence shot has issued.  Vittoria walked for the remainder of the day.  That fearful companion oppressed her.  She felt that one who followed armies should be cast in such a frame, and now desired with all her heart to render full obedience to Carlo, and abide in Brescia, or even in Milan--a city she thought of shyly.  The march was hurried to the slopes of the Vicentino, for enemies were thick in this district.  Pericles refused to quit the soldiers, though Count Karl used persuasion.  The young nobleman said to Vittoria, \"Be on your guard when you meet my sister Anna.  I tell you, we can be as revengeful as any of you: but you will exonerate me.  I do my duty; I seek to do no more.\"  At an inn that they reached toward evening she saw the innkeeper shoot a little ball of paper at an Italian corporal, who put his foot on it and picked it up.  The soldier subsequently passed through the ranks of his comrades, gathering winks and grins.  They were to have rested at the inn, but Count Karl was warned by scouts, which was sufficient to make Pericles cling to him in avoidance of the volunteers, of whom mainly he was in terror.  He looked ague-stricken.  He would not listen to her, or to reason in any shape.  \"I am on the sea--shall I trust a boat?  I stick to a ship,\" he said.  The soldiers marched till midnight.  It was arranged that the carriage should strike off for Schio at dawn.  The soldiers bivouacked on the slope of one of the low undulations falling to the Vicentino plain.  Vittoria spread her cloak, and lay under bare sky, not suffering the woman to be ejected from the carriage.  Hitherto Luigi had avoided her.  Under pretence of doubling Count Karl's cloak as a pillow for her head, he whispered, \"If the signorina hears shots let her lie on the ground flat as a sheet.\"  The peacefulness surrounding her precluded alarm.  There was brilliant moonlight, and the host of stars, all dim; and first they beckoned her up to come away from trouble, and then, through long gazing, she had the fancy that they bent and swam about her, making her feel that she lay in the hollows of a warm hushed sea.  She wished for her lover.  Men and officers were lying at a stone's-throw distant.  The Tyrolese had lit a fire for cooking purposes, by which four of them stood, and, lifting hands, sang one of their mountain songs, that seemed to her to spring like clear water into air, and fall wavering as a feather falls, or the light about a stone in water.  It lulled her to a half-sleep, during which she fancied hearing a broad imitation of a cat's-call from the mountains, that was answered out of the camp, and a talk of officers arose in connection with the response, and subsided.  The carriage was in the shadows of the fire.  In a little while Luigi and the driver began putting the horses to, and she saw Count Karl and Weisspriess go up to Luigi, who declared loudly that it was time.  The woman inside was aroused.  Weisspriess helped to drag her out.  Luigi kept making much noise, and apologized for it by saying that he desired to awaken his master, who was stretched in a secure circle among the Tyrolese. Presently Vittoria beheld the woman's arms thrown out free; the next minute they were around the body of Weisspriess, and a shrewd cry issued from Count Karl.  Shots rang from the outposts; the Tyrolese sprang to arms; \"Sandra!\" was shouted by Pericles; and once more she heard the 'Venite fratelli!' of the bull's voice, and a stream of volunteers dashed at the Tyrolese with sword and dagger and bayonet.  The Austro-Italians stood in a crescent line--the ominous form of incipient military insubordination.  Their officers stormed at them, and called for Count Karl and for Weisspriess.  The latter replied like a man stifling, but Count Karl's voice was silent.  \"Weisspriess! here, to me!\"  the captain sang out in Italian.  \"Ammiani! here, to me!\"  was replied.  Vittoria struck her hands together in electrical gladness at her lover's voice and name.  It rang most cheerfully.  Her home was in the conflict where her lover fought, and she muttered with ecstasy, \"We have met! we have met!\"  The sound of the keen steel, so exciting to dream of, paralyzed her nerves in a way that powder, more terrible for a woman's imagination, would not have done, and she could only feebly advance.  It was a spacious moonlight, but the moonlight appeared to have got of a brassy hue to her eyes, though the sparkle of the steel was white; and she felt too, and wondered at it, that the cries and the noise went to her throat, as if threatening to choke her.  Very soon she found herself standing there, watching for the issue of the strife, almost as dead as a weight in scales, incapable of clear vision.  Matched against the Tyrolese alone, the volunteers had an equal fight in point of numbers, and the advantage of possessing a leader; for Count Karl was down, and Weisspriess was still entangled in the woman's arms. When at last Wilfrid got him free, the unsupported Tyrolese were giving ground before Carlo Ammiani and his followers.  These fought with stern fury, keeping close up to their enemy, rarely shouting.  They presented something like the line of a classic bow, with its arrow-head; while the Tyrolese were huddled in groups, and clubbed at them, and fell back for space, and ultimately crashed upon their betraying brothers in arms, swinging rifles and flying.  The Austro-Italians rang out a Viva for Italy, and let them fly: they were swept from the scene.  Vittoria heard her lover addressing his followers.  Then he and Angelo stood over Count Karl, whom she had forgotten.  Angelo ran up to her, but gave place the moment Carlo came; and Carlo drew her by the hand swiftly to an obscure bend of the rolling ground, and stuck his sword in the earth, and there put his arms round her and held her fast.  \"Obey me now,\" were his first words.  \"Yes,\" she answered.  He was harsh of eye and tongue, not like the gentle youth she had been torn from at the door of La Scala.  \"Return; make your way to Brescia.  My mother is in Brescia.  Milan is hateful.  I throw myself into Vicenza.  Can I trust you to obey?\"  \"Carlo, what evil have you heard of me?\"  \"I listen to no tales.\"  \"Let me follow you to Vicenza and be your handmaid, my beloved.\"  \"Say that you obey.\"  \"I have said it.\"  He seemed to shut her in his heart, so closely was she enfolded.  \"Since La Scala,\" she murmured; and he bent his lips to her ear, whispering, \"Not one thought of another woman! and never till I die.\"  \"And I only of you,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4441"],["title","Vittoria â€” Volume 7 (#2)"],["body","lo, and for you, my lover, my lover!\"  \"You love me absolutely?\"  \"I belong to you.\"  \"I could be a coward and pray for life to live to hear you say it.\"  \"I feel I breathe another life when you are away from me.\"  \"You belong to me; you are my own?\"  \"You take my voice, beloved.\"  \"And when I claim you, I am to have you?\"  \"Am I not in your hands?\"  \"The very instant I make my claim you will say yes?\"  \"I shall not have strength for more than to nod.\"  Carlo shuddered at the delicious image of her weakness.  \"My Sandra!  Vittoria, my soul!  my bride!\"  \"O my Carlo!  Do you go to Vicenza?  And did you know I was among these people?\"  \"You will hear everything from little Leone Rufo, who is wounded and accompanies you to Brescia.  Speak of nothing.  Speak my name, and look at me.  I deserve two minutes of blessedness.\"  \"Ah! my dearest, if I am sweet to you, you might have many!\"  \"No; they begin to hum a reproach at me already, for I must be marching. Vicenza will soon bubble on a fire, I suspect.  Comfort my mother; she wants a young heart at her elbow.  If she is alone, she feeds on every rumour; other women scatter in emotions what poisons her.  And when my bride is with her, I am between them.\"  \"Yes, Carlo, I will go,\" said Vittoria, seeing her duty at last through tenderness.  Carlo sprang from her side to meet Angelo, with whom he exchanged some quick words.  The bugle was sounding, and Barto Rizzo audible.  Luigi came to, her, ruefully announcing that the volunteers had sacked the carriage behaved worse than the Austrians; and that his padrone, the signor Antonio-Pericles, was off like a gossamer.  Angelo induced her to remain on the spot where she stood till the carriage was seen on the Schio road, when he led her to it, saying that Carlo had serious work to do.  Count Karl Lenkenstein was lying in the carriage, supported by Wilfrid and by young Leone Rufo, who sat laughing, with one eye under a cross-bandage and an arm slung in a handkerchief.  Vittoria desired to wait that she might see her lover once more; but Angelo entreated her that she should depart, too earnestly to leave her in doubt of there being good reason for it and for her lover's absence.  He pointed to Wilfrid: \"Barto Rizzo captured this man; Carlo has released him.  Take him with you to attend on his superior officer.\"  She drew Angelo's observation to the first morning colours over the peaks.  He looked up, and she knew that he remembered that morning of their flight from the inn.  Perhaps he then had the image of his brother in his mind, for the colours seemed to be plucking at his heart, and he said, \"I have lost him.\"  \"God help you, my friend!\"  said Vittoria, her throat choking.  Angelo pointed at the insensible nobleman: \"These live.  I do not grudge him his breath or his chances; but why should these men take so much killing?  Weisspriess has risen, as though I struck the blow of a babe. But we one shot does for us!  Nevertheless, signorina,\" Angelo smiled firmly, \"I complain of nothing while we march forward.\"  He kissed his hand to her, and turned back to his troop.  The carriage was soon under the shadows of the mountains.     CHAPTER XXXIV  EPISODES OF THE REVOLT AND THE WAR  THE DEEDS OF BARTO RIZZO--THE MEETING AT ROVEREDO  At Schio there was no medical attendance to be obtained for Count Karl, and he begged so piteously to be taken on to Roveredo, that, on his promising to give Leone Rufo a pass, Vittoria decided to work her way round to Brescia by the Alpine route.  She supposed Pericles to have gone off among the Tyrolese, and wished in her heart that Wilfrid had gone likewise, for he continued to wear that look of sad stupefaction which was the harshest reproach to her.  Leone was unconquerably gay in spite of his wounds.  He narrated the doings of the volunteers, with proud eulogies of Carlo Ammiani's gallant leadership; but the devices of Barto Rizzo appeared to have struck his imagination most.  \"He is positively a cat--a great cat,\" Leone said.  \"He can run a day; he can fast a week; he can climb a house; he can drop from a crag; and he never lets go his hold.  If he says a thing to his wife, she goes true as a bullet to the mark.  The two make a complete piece of artillery.  We are all for Barto, though our captain Carlo is often enraged with him.  But there's no getting on without him.  We have found that.\"  Rinaldo and Angelo Guidascarpi and Barto Rizzo had done many daring feats.  They had first, heading about a couple of dozen out of a force of sixty, endeavoured to surprise the fortress Rocca d'Anfo in Lake Idro --an insane enterprise that touched on success, and would have been an achievement had all the men who followed them been made of the same desperate stuff.  Beaten off, they escaped up the Val di Ledro, and secretly entered Trent, where they hoped to spread revolt, but the Austrian commandant knew what a quantity of dry wood was in the city, and stamped his heel on sparks.  A revolt was prepared notwithstanding the proclamation of imprisonment and death.  Barto undertook to lead a troop against the Buon Consiglio barracks, while Angelo and Rinaldo cleared the ramparts.  It chanced, whether from treachery or extra-vigilance was unknown, that the troops paid domiciliary visits an hour before the intended outbreak, and the three were left to accomplish their task alone.  They remained in the city several days, hunted from house to house, and finally they were brought to bay at night on the roof of a palace where the Lenkenstein ladies were residing.  Barto took his dagger between his teeth and dropped to the balcony of Lena's chamber.  The brothers soon after found the rooftrap opened to them, and Lena and Anna conducted them to the postern-door.  There Angelo asked whom they had to thank.  The terrified ladies gave their name; upon hearing which, Rinaldo turned and said that he would pay for a charitable deed to the extent of his power, and would not meanly allow them to befriend persons who were to continue strangers to them.  He gave the name of Guidascarpi, and relieved his brother, as well as himself, of a load of obligation, for the ladies raised wild screams on the instant.  In falling from the walls to the road, Rinaldo hurt his foot.  Barto lifted him on his back, and journeyed with him so till at the appointed place he met his wife, who dressed the foot, and led them out of the line of pursuit, herself bending under the beloved load.  Her adoration of Rinaldo was deep as a mother's, pure as a virgin's, fiery as a saint's.  Leone Rufo dwelt on it the more fervidly from seeing Vittoria's expression of astonishment.  The woman led them to a cave in the rocks, where she had stored provision and sat two days expecting the signal from Trent.  They saw numerous bands of soldiers set out along the valleys--merry men whom it was Barto's pleasure to beguile by shouts, as a relief for his parched weariness upon the baking rock.  Accident made it an indiscretion.  A glass was levelled at them by a mounted officer, and they had quickly to be moving.  Angelo knew the voice of Weisspriess in the word of command to the soldiers, and the call to him to surrender.  Weisspriess followed them across the mountain track, keeping at their heels, though they doubled and adopted all possible contrivances to shake him off.  He was joined by Count Karl Lenkenstein on the day when Carlo Ammiani encountered them, with the rear of Colonel Corte's band marching for Vicenza.  In the collision between the Austrians and the volunteers, Rinaldo was taken fighting upon his knee-cap.  Leone cursed the disabled foot which had carried the hero in action, to cast him at the mercy of his enemies; but recollection of that sight of Rinaldo fighting far ahead and alone, half-down-like a scuttled ship, stood like a flower in the lad's memory.  The volunteers devoted themselves to liberate or avenge him.  It was then that Barto Rizzo sent his wife upon her mission.  Leone assured Vittoria that Angelo was aware of its nature, and approved it--hoped that the same might be done for himself.  He shook his head when she asked if Count Ammiani approved it likewise.  \"Signorina, Count Ammiani has a grudge against Barto, though he can't help making use of him.  Our captain Carlo is too much of a mere soldier. He would have allowed Rinaldo to be strung up, and Barto does not owe him obedience in those things.\"  \"But why did this Barto Rizzo employ a woman's hand?\"  \"The woman was capable.  No man could have got permission to move freely among the rascal Austrians, even in the character of a deserter.  She did, and she saved him from the shame of execution.  And besides, it was her punishment.  You are astonished?  Barto Rizzo punishes royally.  He never forgives, and he never persecutes; he waits for his opportunity. That woman disobeyed him once--once only; but once was enough.  It occurred in Milan, I believe.  She released an Austrian, or did something --I don't know the story exactly--and Barto said to her, 'Now you can wash out your crime and send your boy to heaven unspotted, with one blow.'  I saw her set out to do it.  She was all teeth and eyes, like a frightened horse; she walked like a Muse in a garden.\"  Vittoria discovered that her presence among the Austrians had been known to Carlo.  Leone alluded slightly to Barto Rizzo's confirmed suspicion of her, saying that it was his weakness to be suspicious of women.  The volunteers, however, were all in her favour, and had jeered at Barto on his declaring that she might, in proof of her willingness to serve the cause, have used her voice for the purpose of subjugating the wavering Austro-Italians, who wanted as much coaxing as women.  Count Karl had been struck to earth by Barto Rizzo.  \"Not with his boasted neatness, I imagine,\" Leone said.  In fact, the dagger had grazed an ivory portrait of a fair Italian head wreathed with violets in Count Karl's breast.  Vittoria recognized the"]]]
