Work, pleasure, sun, moon, and stars had lost their meaning.  He stood and looked at the most radiant loveliness of land and sky and sea and felt nothing. Success brought greater wealth each day without stirring a pulse of pleasure, even in triumph.  There was nothing left but the awful days and awful nights to which he knew physicians could give their scientific name, but had no healing for.  He had gone far enough.  He would go no farther. To-morrow it would have been over long hours.  And there would have been no public declaiming over the humiliating pitifulness of his end.  And what did it matter?  How thick the fog was outside--thick enough for a man to lose himself in it.  The yellow mist which had crept in under the doors and through the crevices of the window-sashes gave a ghostly look to the room--a ghastly, abnormal look, he said to himself.  The fire was smouldering instead of blazing.  But what did it matter?  He was going out.  He had not bought the pistol last night--like a fool.  Somehow his brain had been so tired and crowded that he had forgotten.  \"Forgotten.\"  He mentally repeated the word as he got out of bed. By this time to-morrow he should have forgotten everything.  THIS TIME TO-MORROW.  His mind repeated that also, as he began to dress himself. Where should he be?  Should he be anywhere?  Suppose he awakened again-- to something as bad as this?  How did a man get out of his body?  After the crash and shock what happened?  Did one find oneself standing beside the Thing and looking down at it?  It would not be a good thing to stand and look down on--even for that which had deserted it.  But having torn oneself loose from it and its devilish aches and pains, one would not care--one would see how little it all mattered.  Anything else must be better than this--the thing for which there was a scientific name but no healing.  He had taken all the drugs, he had obeyed all the medical orders, and here he was after that last hell of a night--dressing himself in a back bedroom of a cheap lodging-house to go out and buy a pistol in this damned fog.  He laughed at the last phrase of his thought, the laugh which was a mirthless grin.  \"I am thinking of it as if I was afraid of taking cold,\" he said. \"And to-morrow--!\"  There would be no To-morrow. To-morrows were at an end.  No more nights--no more days--no more morrows.  He finished dressing, putting on his discriminatingly chosen shabby-genteel clothes with a care for the effect he intended them to produce. The collar and cuffs of his shirt were frayed and yellow, and he fastened his collar with a pin and tied his worn necktie carelessly. His overcoat was beginning to wear a greenish shade and look threadbare, so was his hat. When his toilet was complete he looked at himself in the cracked and hazy glass, bending forward to scrutinize his unshaven face under the shadow of the dingy hat.  \"It is all right,\" he muttered. \"It is not far to the pawnshop where I saw it.\"  The stillness of the room as he turned to go out was uncanny.  As it was a back room, there was no street below from which could arise sounds of passing vehicles, and the thickness of the fog muffled such sound as might have floated from the front.  He stopped half-way to the door, not knowing why, and listened. To what--for what?  The silence seemed to spread through all the house--out into the streets--through all London--through all the world, and he to stand in the midst of it, a man on the way to Death--with no To-morrow.  What did it mean?  It seemed to mean something.  The world withdrawn-- life withdrawn--sound withdrawn--breath withdrawn.  He stood and waited. Perhaps this was one of the symptoms of the morbid thing for which there was that name.  If so he had better get away quickly and have it over, lest he be found wandering about not knowing--not knowing.  But now he knew--the Silence.  He waited--waited and tried to hear, as if something was calling him--calling without sound.  It returned to him-- the thought of That which had waited through all the ages to see what he--one man--would do. He had never exactly pitied himself before--he did not know that he pitied himself now, but he was a man going to his death, and a light, cold sweat broke out on him and it seemed as if it was not he who did it, but some other--he flung out his arms and cried aloud words he had not known he was going to speak.  \"Lord!  Lord!  What shall I do to be saved?\"  But the Silence gave no answer. It was the Silence still.  And after standing a few moments panting, his arms fell and his head dropped, and turning the handle of the door, he went out to buy the pistol.  II  As he went down the narrow staircase, covered with its dingy and threadbare carpet, he found the house so full of dirty yellow haze that he realized that the fog must be of the extraordinary ones which are remembered in after-years as abnormal specimens of their kind.  He recalled that there had been one of the sort three years before, and that traffic and business had been almost entirely stopped by it, that accidents had happened in the streets, and that people having lost their way had wandered about turning corners until they found themselves far from their intended destinations and obliged to take refuge in hotels or the houses of hospitable strangers.  Curious incidents had occurred and odd stories were told by those who had felt themselves obliged by circumstances to go out into the baffling gloom. He guessed that something of a like nature had fallen upon the town again.  The gas-light on the landings and in the melancholy hall burned feebly--so feebly that one got but a vague view of the rickety hat-stand and the shabby overcoats and head-gear hanging upon it.  It was well for him that he had but a corner or so to turn before he reached the pawnshop in whose window he had seen the pistol he intended to buy.  When he opened the street-door he saw that the fog was, upon the whole, perhaps even heavier and more obscuring, if possible, than the one so well remembered.  He could not see anything three feet before him, he could not see with distinctness anything two feet ahead.  The sensation of stepping forward was uncertain and mysterious enough to be almost appalling.  A man not sufficiently cautious might have fallen into any open hole in his path.  Antony Dart kept as closely as possible to the sides of the houses.  It would have been easy to walk off the pavement into the middle of the street but for the edges of the curb and the step downward from its level.  Traffic had almost absolutely ceased, though in the more important streets link-boys were making efforts to guide men or four-wheelers slowly along. The blind feeling of the thing was rather awful.  Though but few pedestrians were out, Dart found himself once or twice brushing against or coming into forcible contact with men feeling their way about like himself.  \"One turn to the right,\" he repeated mentally, \"two to the left, and the place is at the corner of the other side of the street.\"  He managed to reach it at last, but it had been a slow, and therefore, long journey.  All the gas-jets the little shop owned were lighted, but even under their flare the articles in the window--the one or two once cheaply gaudy dresses and shawls and men's garments--hung in the haze like the dreary, dangling ghosts of things recently executed. Among watches and forlorn pieces of old-fashioned jewelry and odds and ends, the pistol lay against the folds of a dirty gauze shawl.  There it was. It would have been annoying if someone else had been beforehand and had bought it.  Inside the shop more dangling spectres hung and the place was almost dark.  It was a shabby pawnshop, and the man lounging behind the counter was a shabby man with an unshaven, unamiable face.  \"I want to look at that pistol in the right-hand corner of your window,\" Antony Dart said.  The pawnbroker uttered a sound something between a half-laugh and a grunt.  He took the weapon from the window.  Antony Dart examined it critically. He must make quite sure of it.  He made no further remark. He felt he had done with speech.  Being told the price asked for the purchase, he drew out his purse and took the money from it.  After making the payment he noted that he still possessed a five-pound note and some sovereigns.  There passed through his mind a wonder as to who would spend it.  The most decent thing, perhaps, would be to give it away.  If it was in his room--to-morrow-- the parish would not bury him, and it would be safer that the parish should.  He was thinking of this as he left the shop and began to cross the street.  Because his mind was wandering he was less watchful.  Suddenly a rubber-tired hansom, moving without sound, appeared immediately in his path--the horse's head loomed up above his own.  He made the inevitable involuntary whirl aside to move out of the way, the hansom passed, and turning again, he went on.  His movement had been too swift to allow of his realizing the direction in which his turn had been made.  He was wholly unaware that when he crossed the street he crossed backward instead of forward.  He turned a corner literally feeling his way, went on, turned another, and after walking the length of the street, suddenly understood that he was in a strange place and had lost his bearings.  This was exactly what had happened to people on the day of the memorable fog of three years before. He had heard them talking of such experiences, and of the curious and baffling sensations they gave rise to in the brain.  Now he understood them.  He could not be far from his lodgings, but he felt like a man who was blind, and who had been turned out of the path he knew. He had not the resource of the people whose stories he had heard.  He would not stop and address anyone. There could be no certainty as to whom he might find himself"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/460"],["title","The Dawn of a To-morrow (#2)"],["body","to.  He would speak to no one. He would wander about until he came upon some clew. Even if he came upon none, the fog would surely lift a little and become a trifle less dense in course of time.  He drew up the collar of his overcoat, pulled his hat down over his eyes and went on--his hand on the thing he had thrust into a pocket.  He did not find his clew as he had hoped, and instead of lifting the fog grew heavier.  He found himself at last no longer striving for any end, but rambling along mechanically, feeling like a man in a dream--a nightmare.  Once he recognized a weird suggestion in the mystery about him.  To-morrow might one be wandering about aimlessly in some such haze.  He hoped not.  His lodgings were not far from the Embankment, and he knew at last that he was wandering along it, and had reached one of the bridges. His mood led him to turn in upon it, and when he reached an embrasure to stop near it and lean upon the parapet looking down.  He could not see the water, the fog was too dense, but he could hear some faint splashing against stones.  He had taken no food and was rather faint. What a strange thing it was to feel faint for want of food--to stand alone, cut off from every other human being--everything done for. No wonder that sometimes, particularly on such days as these, there were plunges made from the parapet--no wonder.  He leaned farther over and strained his eyes to see some gleam of water through the yellowness.  But it was not to be done.  He was thinking the inevitable thing, of course; but such a plunge would not do for him.  The other thing would destroy all traces.  As he drew back he heard something fall with the solid tinkling sound of coin on the flag pavement. When he had been in the pawnbroker's shop he had taken the gold from his purse and thrust it carelessly into his waistcoat pocket, thinking that it would be easy to reach when he chose to give it to one beggar or another, if he should see some wretch who would be the better for it.  Some movement he had made in bending had caused a sovereign to slip out and it had fallen upon the stones.  He did not intend to pick it up, but in the moment in which he stood looking down at it he heard close to him a shuffling movement. What he had thought a bundle of rags or rubbish covered with sacking--some tramp's deserted or forgotten belongings--was stirring.  It was alive, and as he bent to look at it the sacking divided itself, and a small head, covered with a shock of brilliant red hair, thrust itself out, a shrewd, small face turning to look up at him slyly with deep-set black eyes.  It was a human girl creature about twelve years old.  \"Are yer goin' to do it?\" she said in a hoarse, street-strained voice. \"Yer would be a fool if yer did--with as much as that on yer.\"  She pointed with a reddened, chapped, and dirty hand at the sovereign.  \"Pick it up,\" he said.  \"You may have it.\"  Her wild shuffle forward was an actual leap.  The hand made a snatching clutch at the coin.  She was evidently afraid that he was either not in earnest or would repent.  The next second she was on her feet and ready for flight.  \"Stop,\" he said; \"I've got more to give away.\"  She hesitated--not believing him, yet feeling it madness to lose a chance.  \"MORE!\" she gasped.  Then she drew nearer to him, and a singular change came upon her face.  It was a change which made her look oddly human.  \"Gawd, mister!\" she said.  \"Yer can give away a quid like it was nothin'--an' yer've got more--an' yer goin' to do THAT--jes cos yer 'ad a bit too much lars night an' there's a fog this mornin'!  You take it straight from me--don't yer do it. I give yer that tip for the suvrink.\"  She was, for her years, so ugly and so ancient, and hardened in voice and skin and manner that she fascinated him.  Not that a man who has no To-morrow in view is likely to be particularly conscious of mental processes.  He was done for, but he stood and stared at her.  What part of the Power moving the scheme of the universe stood near and thrust him on in the path designed he did not know then--perhaps never did.  He was still holding on to the thing in his pocket, but he spoke to her again.  \"What do you mean?\" he asked glumly.  She sidled nearer, her sharp eyes on his face.  \"I bin watchin' yer,\" she said. \"I sat down and pulled the sack over me 'ead to breathe inside it an' get a bit warm.  An' I see yer come. I knowed wot yer was after, I did. I watched yer through a 'ole in me sack.  I wasn't goin' to call a copper. I shouldn't want ter be stopped meself if I made up me mind.  I seed a gal dragged out las' week an' it'd a broke yer 'art to see 'er tear 'er clothes an' scream.  Wot business 'ad they preventin' 'er goin' off quiet?  I wouldn't 'a' stopped yer--but w'en the quid fell, that made it different.\"  \"I--\" he said, feeling the foolishness of the statement, but making it, nevertheless, \"I am ill.\"  \"Course yer ill.  It's yer 'ead. Come along er me an' get a cup er cawfee at a stand, an' buck up.  If yer've give me that quid straight-- wish-yer-may-die--I'll go with yer an' get a cup myself.  I ain't 'ad a bite since yesterday--an' 't wa'n't nothin' but a slice o' polony sossidge I found on a dust-'eap.  Come on, mister.\"  She pulled his coat with her cracked hand.  He glanced down at it mechanically, and saw that some of the fissures had bled and the roughened surface was smeared with the blood.  They stood together in the small space in which the fog enclosed them--he and she--the man with no To-morrow and the girl thing who seemed as old as himself, with her sharp, small nose and chin, her sharp eyes and voice--and yet--perhaps the fogs enclosing did it--something drew them together in an uncanny way. Something made him forget the lost clew to the lodging-house-- something made him turn and go with her--a thing led in the dark.  \"How can you find your way?\" he said.  \"I lost mine.\"  \"There ain't no fog can lose me,\" she answered, shuffling along by his side; \"'sides, it's goin' to lift. Look at that man comin' to'ards us.\"  It was true that they could see through the orange-colored mist the approaching figure of a man who was at a yard's distance from them. Yes, it was lifting slightly--at least enough to allow of one's making a guess at the direction in which one moved.  \"Where are you going?\" he asked.  \"Apple Blossom Court,\" she answered.  \"The cawfee-stand's in a street near it--and there's a shop where I can buy things.\"  \"Apple Blossom Court!\" he ejaculated.  \"What a name!\"  \"There ain't no apple-blossoms there,\" chuckling; \"nor no smell of 'em. 'T ain't as nice as its nime is--Apple Blossom Court ain't.\"  \"What do you want to buy?  A pair of shoes?\"  The shoes her naked feet were thrust into were leprous-looking things through which nearly all her toes protruded.  But she chuckled when he spoke.  \"No, I 'm goin' to buy a di'mond tirarer to go to the opery in,\" she said, dragging her old sack closer round her neck.  \"I ain't ad a noo un since I went to the last Drorin'-room.\"  It was impudent street chaff, but there was cheerful spirit in it, and cheerful spirit has some occult effect upon morbidity.  Antony Dart did not smile, but he felt a faint stirring of curiosity, which was, after all, not a bad thing for a man who had not felt an interest for a year.  \"What is it you are going to buy?\"  \"I'm goin' to fill me stummick fust,\" with a grin of elation.  \"Three thick slices o' bread an' drippin' an' a mug o' cawfee.  An' then I'm goin' to get sumethin' 'earty to carry to Polly.  She ain't no good, pore thing!\"  \"Who is she?\"  Stopping a moment to drag up the heel of her dreadful shoe, she answered him with an unprejudiced directness which might have been appalling if he had been in the mood to be appalled.  \"Ain't eighteen, an' tryin' to earn 'er livin' on the street.  She ain't made for it.  Little country thing, allus frightened to death an' ready to bust out cryin'.  Gents ain't goin' to stand that.  A lot of 'em wants cheerin' up as much as she does. Gent as was in liquor last night knocked 'er down an' give 'er a black eye.  'T wan't ill feelin', but he lost his temper, an' give 'er a knock casual.  She can't go out to-night, an' she's been 'uddled up all day cryin' for 'er mother.\"  \"Where is her mother?\"  \"In the country--on a farm. Polly took a place in a lodgin'-'ouse an' got in trouble.  The biby was dead, an' when she come out o' Queen Charlotte's she was took in by a woman an' kep'.  She kicked 'er out in a week 'cos of her cryin'. The life didn't suit 'er.  I found 'er cryin' fit to split 'er chist one night--corner o' Apple Blossom Court--an' I took care of 'er.\"  \"Where?\"  \"Me chambers,\" grinning; \"top loft of a 'ouse in the court.  If anyone else 'd 'ave it I should be turned out.  It's an 'ole, I can tell yer-- but it's better than sleepin' under the bridges.\"  \"Take me to see it,\" said Antony Dart.  \"I want to see the girl.\"  The words spoke themselves.  Why should he care to see either cockloft or girl?  He did not.  He wanted to go back to his lodgings with that which he had come out to buy. Yet he said this thing.  His companion looked up at him with an expression actually relieved.  \"Would yer tike up with 'er?\" with eager sharpness, as if confronting a simple business proposition. \"She's pretty an' clean, an' she won't drink a drop o' nothin'.  If she was treated kind she'd be cheerfler. She's got a round fice an' light 'air an' eyes.  'Er 'air's curly. P'raps yer'd like 'er.\"  \"Take me to see her.\"  \"She'd look better to-morrow,\" cautiously, \"when the swellin's gone down round 'er eye.\"  Dart started--and it was because he had for the last five minutes forgotten something.  \"I shall not be here to-morrow,\" he said.  His grasp upon the thing in his pocket had loosened, and he tightened it.  \"I have some more money in my purse,\" he said deliberately.  \"I meant to give it away before going. I want to give it to people who need it very "]]]
