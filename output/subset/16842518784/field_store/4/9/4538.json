But when you have stopped at last, and gazed upwards, \"Is it possible,\" you say to yourself, \"that I can have descended from such a height in so short a space of time?\"  I do not know whether Bran or his master was at the foot of the mountain first, but I do happen to know that they both disappeared in a wreath of snow as soon as they got there, and that _both_ of them emerged therefrom laughing.  After that, Allan McGregor sloped his gun and walked on more sedately, as became the chief of Arrandoon.  And now he approached the old castle, which looked ever so much higher and more imposing as one stood beneath it.  He fired both barrels of his gun in the air, and the sound reverberated from hill and crag, rolling far away over the loch itself in a thousand echoes, as if the fairies were engaged at platoon-firing.  Bran barked, and his bark was re-echoed too, not only from the rocks around, but from the interior of the castle walls.  This last, I must tell you, was an Irish echo; it was no ghostly recoil of Bran's own voice, but the genuine outcome from canine lungs; and lo! yonder come the owners of them, pouring over the bridge, a perfect hairy hurricane, to welcome Bran and his master home.  Two Highland collies, a lordly Saint Bernard, a whole pack of what looked like stable brooms, but were in reality Skye terriers, and last, but not least, Bran's old mother.  When the hubbub and din were somewhat settled, and the greetings over, Allan proceeded to cross the bridge, and McBain, his foster-father, advanced with a kindly smile to meet him.  I must introduce McBain to the reader without more ado--that is, I must give you some idea of his appearance; as to his character, that will develop itself as the story proceeds.  He was about the middle height, then, and clad, like Allan, in the Highland dress of McGregor tartan--or _plaid_, as the English and Lowland Scotch erroneously call it.  Though far from old, McBain was grey in beard and furrowed in brow; yet there are but few young men, I ween, who, had they ventured on a tussle with that broad-shouldered, wiry Highlander, would have cared to repeat the experiment for a week to come at least.  This was Allan's foster-father.  He had been in the family since he was a child, and his ancestors, like himself, had been chief retainers to the lairds of Arrandoon.  He was a right faithful fellow, and a Scotchman in everything, thinking no people so good or brave or powerful as his own, nor any other country in the world worth living in; and from this you will readily infer that he had never mixed very much with the peoples of the earth.  This is true; and still he had travelled when a young man, but it was towards the desolate regions of the North Pole. It was pride had taken him there--a cross word that his father had said to him, and young McBain had gone to sea.  Only, a few years of the wild, rough life he had led on the icy ocean around Spitzbergen had taught him that there was no place like home, so he returned to it and received his father's pardon, and, later on, his blessing.  \"Aha, Allan, boy!\" cried McBain; \"so you've got back at last.  Indeed-- indeed we thought you were lost, and Bran and all.  What sport, boy-- what sport?\"  \"There is the bag,\" said Allan, \"and precious little you'll find in it.\"  \"Ah!  But, boy, half a loaf is better than no bread.  When I was in Spitzbergen--\"  \"There, there,\" said Allan, interrupting him, \"never mind about Spitzbergen now; but tell me, have Ralph and Rory come, there's a good old foster-father.\"  \"Ralph and Rory come!\" replied McBain, with an air of surprise.  \"Why, they are English, Allan; and do you think they'd leave the hospitality and good cheer of an Inverness hotel, to visit Glentroom in such weather as this?  It _isn't_ likely!\"  Allan was silent; he had turned away his head and was gazing skywards, with something very like a frown on his face.  McBain laid a kindly hand on his shoulder.  \"You are piqued, son,\" he said; \"you are angry.  There is the proud, defiant look of the McGregor chiefs on your countenance.  Let it pass, Allan; let it pass.  Do not forget for a moment what the McBains have ever been to your people. Have they not served them well, and fought and bled for them too?  Were they not ever the first at the castle walls, when the fiery cross was sent through the glen?  Do not forget that I have been a true foster-father to you, my son?  Haven't I taught you all you know? on the hills, on the lochs, and by the river? and would you get angry with the old man because he says your guests will hardly dare turn up to-night?\"  Allan passed his hand quickly across his brow, as if to brush away a cloud.  \"No, no!\" he replied; \"I'm not angry.  Only--only you don't know my English friends; you will alter your opinion of them when you do.  They are brave and manly fellows, McBain.  Ralph rowed stroke oar in his boat at Cambridge, and Rory is the best bowler in the three royal counties.\"  McBain laughed.  \"Allan!  Allan!\" he said; \"think you for a moment they could do what I have taught you to do?  Could either of them cross Loch Kreenan in a cobble when the waves are houses high, when their white crests cut the face like a Highland dirk?  Could they bring the eagle from the clouds with a single bullet, or the windhover from the sky?  Could they grapple with and gralloch a wounded red deer?  Nay; and even if they could, if they were as brave and strong and fierce as the wild cat of the mountain, it would take all their strength and all their courage to face the storm that is brewing to-night.  See, Allan, the clouds are already settling down on the hills, the peak of Melfourvounie is buried in mist, there is a mournful sough in the rising wind, and ere five hours are over the boddach will be shrieking among the crags of Drontheim.\"  [Boddach--A spirit, believed in by many, who takes the shape of an old man, sometimes seen by night in the woods, but always heard shrieking among the rocks that he haunts whenever storms are raging.]  \"All the more reason,\" cried Allan, talking rapidly, \"that I should go and meet them.  Tell mother and sister I have gone a little way down the glen to meet Ralph and Rory, and we'll all be back to dinner.  Bran and Oscar will go with me.  But stay, don't you hear the bagpipes?  It is Peter, and very likely my friends are with him.\"  The sound came nearer and nearer, and presently out from the shadows of the dark pine-wood strode Peter--all alone.  Both went quickly to meet him, and Peter's story was soon told.  \"The Sassenach gentlemans,\" he said, \"had both left Inverness with him in the morning, and fine young gentlemans they were, and might have been Highlanders for the matter of that.  But och and och! they _would_ take the high road for sake of the scenery, bless you, and he had to take the low; but for all that they ought to have been at the castle hours and hours ago.\"  Young Allan and his foster-father said never a word; they did but tighten their hands, and glance for a moment in each other's eyes, yet both understood that the simple action implied a promise on either side to stand together, shoulder to shoulder, whatever might happen.  Presence of mind in emergency is a gift that seems peculiar to the Scottish Highlander.  Born in a mountain land, and accustomed from his very infancy to face every danger in hill or glen, in flood or fell or field, his true character is never better seen than in times of danger. McBain waited for a few minutes in the castle courtyard until Allan, who had hurried away, should have time to communicate with his mother and sister; then he struck a gong, and while yet its thunders were reverberating among the hills, he was surrounded by every servant in the place, old Janet, the cook, not excepted; then the orders that fell calmly and yet quickly from his lips showed at once that he was master of the situation.  \"Janet, old woman,\" he said, \"run away to the house like a good creature and get ready the dinner; the best that ever you made, do ye hear? Peter, run, lad, and get a rope, the crooks, and lanterns.  Here, take the chief's gun.  Yes, certainly, bring the bagpipes, and don't forget the flask.  Donald Ogg, get the pony put in the trap, with rugs and plaids galore.  Take the high road to Inverness and follow us soon. Thank you, Peter.  Now for the dogs.  No, no; not a pack.  Back with them all to the kennel save Oscar, Bran, and Kooran the collie.  Here we are, Allan, boy, all ready for a start.\"  And in less time than it takes me to tell it, the little expedition was equipped and started.  A few minutes more and they had disappeared in the pine forest from which Peter had so lately emerged, and the old Castle of Arrandoon was left to silence and the gloom of quickly-descending night.  CHAPTER TWO.  SAVED--RORY AND RALPH--MCBAIN HAS AN IDEA.  There is probably no music in the world more spirit-stirring--when heard amongst the native hills--than that of the Highland bagpipe.  How often it has led our Scottish troops to victory, and cheered their drooping hearts in times of trouble, let history tell.  In the London streets the sound of the pipes may be something vastly different, and then the pipers get undue blame.  The little party who left the Castle of Arrandoon to go in search of Ralph and Rory did well to have Peter and his bagpipes included in their number, for, so long as they were within hearing distance of the castle, the music would give hope to those left behind; and when beyond that, it would not only serve to while away the time of the searchers, but even in the darkness it might perchance be heard by the sought.  The road they had taken led upwards through the pine forest for more than a mile, and even when it left the wood it still ascended, until it at last joined the old highway to Inverness.  This was quite high up among the mountains--so high, indeed, that even the most distant peaks were visible on the other"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/38276"],["title","The Cruise of the Snowbird: A Story of Arctic Adventure (#2)"],["body","of the lake.  \"Surely,\" said McBain, \"we shall meet your friends ere long.\"  \"I fear the very worst,\" said Allan, gloomily, \"for, had they not left the road for some purpose or another, they would have reached the glen long before this time.  Rory would have his sketch-book, and both of them are fond of wild scenery.\"  \"Wild scenery indeed!\" said McBain; \"they needn't leave the road to search for that.\"  His words were surely true, for a grander scene than that around them it would be difficult to imagine.  It was a toilsome road they had to trace though, for the untrodden snow lay a good foot deep on the path, and, albeit they cast many a longing look ahead, they had but little time and little heart to look around to admire the scenery.  And the snow was dry and treacherous.  It lay lightly on the brae-sides, and on the bending heather stems, apparently awaiting only the breath of the storm to raise it into clouds of whirling drift, and drive it into deep and impassable wreaths.  For more than an hour they trudged onwards without catching sight or hearing sound of life, whether of man, or bird, or beast.  The wind, too, was beginning to rise, a few flakes of snow had begun to fall, and night and darkness were already settling down in the hollows and glens, and only on the hilltops did daylight remain.  At last they came to a shepherd's hut, and McBain knocked loudly at the door.  \"Are you in, Donald?  Are you in?\" he cried.  \"To be surely I'm in,\" said a tall, plaided Highlander, opening the little door; \"to be surely I'm in, Mr McBain, and where else is it I'd be, I wonder, in such a night as it soon will be?\"  \"Have you been abroad to-day, Donald?\" asked Allan.  \"Abroad?  Yes, looking after the sheepies, to be surely.\"  \"Have you seen or met any one?\"  \"Yes, yes; two English bodies, to be surely.  One would be sitting on a stone, making a picture, and the other would be looking over his shoulder, as it were.  Och!  Yes, to be surely.\"  \"Would you go with us, Donald?\" asked Allan, \"and show us the spot where you saw them.\"  \"Would I go with you?  Is it that you are asking me?\" cried Donald; \"and what for do you ask me?  Why didn't you tell us to go?  Didn't my poor brother go with your father? ay, and die by his side.  Yes, Donald will go with you to the end of the world if you'll want him.  Wait till I get my crook; to be surely I'll go.\"  Donald disappeared as he spoke, but after about a minute he joined our friends, and they journeyed on together.  \"It will be an awful night, to be surely,\" said Donald, \"and troth, it is more than likely the two English bodies are dead, or drowned, or frozen by this time.  An' och! it's a blessing they are only English bodies.\"  Such a speech as this did not tend to reassure young Allan.  In very truth it almost quenched the hopes that were beginning to rise in his heart.  Donald was now their guide, and they were not surprised to observe that before very long he deserted the main road entirely, for a steep and craggy path that led downwards towards the distant lake.  Along this narrow footway Donald bounded along with almost the speed of a red deer. Nor were Allan and his trusty companions slow to follow, for all felt how precious were the few minutes of daylight that were left to them.  And now the shepherd stops, removes his cap, and, passing his fingers through his hair in a puzzled kind of manner, stares around him in some surprise.  \"Yes, yes,\" he says at last; \"this is the place, to be surely, but I don't see a sign of the English bodies whatsomever.\"  But if _he_ does not, Allan McGregor, quicker of eye, does.  He springs lightly forward, and picks something up that lies half-buried among the snow.  \"It is Rory's sketch-book,\" he says, \"Alas! poor Rory.\"  But what is that mournful wail that now rises up towards them, apparently from the very bosom of the dark lake itself?  \"It's the boddach of Drontheim,\" falters the shepherd, trembling like an aspen leaf.  \"It's the boddach, to be surely, och! and och!  What will become of us whatsomever?\"  \"Silence, Donald, silence?\" cries McBain, as the strange sound falls once more on their listening ears.  \"Where is Oscar?  Not here?  Why, it is he!  Come, men!  Come, Allan, for, dead or alive, your friends are down yonder.\"  They follow the footprints of the noble dog, although they are hardly visible, but Kooran, the collie, takes up the scent and does excellent service.  So down the steep and craggy hill they rush, often stumbling, sometimes falling, but still going bravely on, and cheering Oscar with their voices as they run.  At the foot at last, and on level ground, they hasten forward, welcomed by the Saint Bernard to a spot where lie two inanimate human forms, partly hidden by the lightly drifting snow.  Dead?  No, thank Heaven! they are not dead, and what joy for Allan McGregor, when stalwart Ralph sits up, rubs his eyes, and gazes vacantly and wildly around him.  \"Drink,\" says McBain, holding a flask to his lips.  The young Englishman swallows a mouthful almost mechanically, then staggers to his feet Allan and McBain steady him by the arms till he comes a little more to himself.  \"Ralph, old fellow,\" says Allan, \"don't you know me?\"  \"Yes, yes,\" he mutters, hardly yet sensible of his surroundings, \"I remember all now.  Rory--the cliff--I could not raise him--sleep stole my senses away.  But we are saved, are we not, and by you, good Allan, and by you strangers?  But see to Rory, see to Rory.\"  McBain was chafing Rory's hands, and rubbing his half-frozen limbs.  \"No,\" he said, \"not saved by us.  You have Providence to thank, and yonder brave dog.  Had he not found you, the sleep that had overcome you would have been your last.\"  It was a long time, and it seemed doubly long to Allan and Ralph, ere Rory showed the slightest signs of returning life.  At length, however, the blood began to trickle slowly from a wound he had received in the forehead in his fall over the cliff, and next moment he sighed deeply, then opened his eyes.  \"God be praised?\" said McBain, fervently; \"and now, my friends, let us carry him.\"  This was very easily done, for Rory was a light weight.  So with Donald in front, and the dogs capering and barking all around them, the party commenced the ascent, and half-an-hour afterwards they were safe at the shepherd's hut.  And none too soon, for night was now over all the land, and the snow fell thick and fast.  Rory was laid upon the shepherd's dais, and Allan and Donald proposed moving it close to the fire.  But McBain knew better.  \"No, no, no!\" he cried, \"leave him where he is.  Never take a frozen man near the fire.  I learned that at Spitzbergen.  He has young blood in his veins, and will soon come round.\"  But Rory, for a time, lay quiet enough.  He was very white too, and but for his regular and uninterrupted breathing, and the tinge of red in his lips, one might have thought him dead.  \"Poor little Rory!\" said Allan, smoothing his dark hair from off his brow.  \"How cold his forehead is!\"  Very simple words these were, yet there was something in the very tone in which they were uttered that would have convinced even a stranger, that Allan McGregor bore for the youth before him quite a brother's love.  And who was Rory, and who was Ralph?  These questions are very soon answered.  Roderick Elphinston and Ralph Leigh were, or had been, students at the University of Cambridge.  They had been \"inseparables\" all through the curriculum, and firm friends from the very first day they had met together.  And yet in appearance, and indeed in character, they were entirely different.  Ralph was a great broad-shouldered, pleasant-faced young Saxon Rory was small as to stature, but lithe and wiry in the extreme; his face was always somewhat pale, but his eyes had all the glitter and fire of a wild cat in them.  Well, then, if you do not like the \"wild cat,\" I shall say \"poet\"--the glitter and fire of a poet.  And a poet he was, though he seldom wrote verses.  Oh! it is not always the verses one writes that prove him to be a poet.  Very often it is just the reverse.  I know a young man who has written more verses than would stretch from Reading to Hyde Park, and there is just as much poetry in that young man's soul as there is in the flagstaff on my lawn yonder.  But Rory's soul was filled with life and imagination, a gladsome glowing life that could not be restrained, but that burst upwards like a fountain in the sunlight, giving joy to all around. Everything in nature was understood and loved by Rory, and everything in nature seemed to love him in return; the birds and beasts made a confidant of him, and the very trees and the tenderest flowerets in garden or field seemed to whisper to him and tell him all their secrets. And just because he was so full of life he was also full of fun.  When silent and thinking, this young Irishman's face was placid, and even somewhat melancholy in expression, but it lighted up when he spoke, and it was wonderfully quick in its changes from grave to gay, or gay to grave.  It was like a rippling summer sea with cloud-shadows chasing each other all over it.  Like most of his countrymen, Rory was brave even to a fault.  Well, then, there you have his description in a few words, and if you will not let me call him poet, I really do not know what else to call him.  Ralph Leigh I must dismiss with a word.  But, in a word, he was in my opinion everything that a young English gentleman should be; he was straightforward, bold and manly, and though very far from being as clever as Rory, he loved Rory for possessing the qualities he himself was deficient in.  Thoroughly guileless was honest Ralph, and indeed, if the truth must be told, he was not a little proud of his companion, and he was never better pleased than when, along with Rory in the company of others, the Irishman was what Ralph called \"in fine form.\"  At such times Ralph would not have interrupted the flow of Rory's wit "]]]
