The hands were crossed upon the breast, the big toes tied together with a bit of string, and a slip of paper containing the man's name, rank, company and regiment was pinned on the breast of his shirt.  The appearance of the dead was indescribably ghastly.  The unclosed eyes shone with a stony glitter--                 An orphan's curse would drag to hell                A spirit from on high:                But, O, more terrible than that,                Is the curse in a dead man's eye.  The lips and nostrils were distorted with pain and hunger, the sallow, dirt-grimed skin drawn tensely over the facial bones, and the whole framed with the long, lank, matted hair and beard.  Millions of lice swarmed over the wasted limbs and ridged ribs.  These verminous pests had become so numerous--owing to our lack of changes of clothing, and of facilities for boiling what we had--that the most a healthy man could do was to keep the number feeding upon his person down to a reasonable limit--say a few tablespoonfuls.  When a man became so sick as to be unable to help himself, the parasites speedily increased into millions, or, to speak more comprehensively, into pints and quarts.  It did not even seem exaggeration when some one declared that he had seen a dead man with more than a gallon of lice on him.  There is no doubt that the irritation from the biting of these myriads materially the days of those who died.  Where a sick man had friends or comrades, of course part of their duty, in taking care of him, was to \"louse\" his clothing.  One of the most effectual ways of doing this was to turn the garments wrong side out and hold the seams as close to the fire as possible, without burning the cloth.  In a short time the lice would swell up and burst open, like pop-corn.  This method was a favorite one for another reason than its efficacy: it gave one a keener sense of revenge upon his rascally little tormentors than he could get in any other way.  As the weather grew warmer and the number in the prison increased, the lice became more unendurable.  They even filled the hot sand under our feet, and voracious troops would climb up on one like streams of ants swarming up a tree.  We began to have a full comprehension of the third plague with which the Lord visited the Egyptians:       And the Lord said unto Moses, Say unto Aaron, Stretch out thy rod,      and smite the dust of the land, that it may become lice through all      the land of Egypt.       And they did so; for Aaron stretched out his hand with his rod, and      smote the dust of the earth, and it became lice in man and in beast;      all the dust of the land became lice throughout all the land of      Egypt.  The total number of deaths in April, according to the official report, was five hundred and seventy-six, or an average of over nineteen a day. There was an average of five thousand prisoner's in the pen during all but the last few days of the month, when the number was increased by the arrival of the captured garrison of Plymouth.  This would make the loss over eleven per cent., and so worse than decimation.  At that rate we should all have died in about eight months.  We could have gone through a sharp campaign lasting those thirty days and not lost so great a proportion of our forces.  The British had about as many men as were in the Stockade at the battle of New Orleans, yet their loss in killed fell much short of the deaths in the pen in April.  A makeshift of a hospital was established in the northeastern corner of the Stockade.  A portion of the ground was divided from the rest of the prison by a railing, a few tent flies were stretched, and in these the long leaves of the pine were made into apologies for beds of about the goodness of the straw on which a Northern farmer beds his stock.  The sick taken there were no better off than if they had staid with their comrades.  What they needed to bring about their recovery was clean clothing, nutritious food, shelter and freedom from the tortures of the lice. They obtained none of these.  Save a few decoctions of roots, there were no medicines; the sick were fed the same coarse corn meal that brought about the malignant dysentery from which they all suffered; they wore and slept in the same vermin-infested clothes, and there could be but one result: the official records show that seventy-six per cent. of those taken to the hospitals died there.  The establishment of the hospital was specially unfortunate for my little squad.  The ground required for it compelled a general reduction of the space we all occupied.  We had to tear down our huts and move.  By this time the materials had become so dry that we could not rebuild with them, as the pine tufts fell to pieces.  This reduced the tent and bedding material of our party--now numbering five--to a cavalry overcoat and a blanket.  We scooped a hole a foot deep in the sand and stuck our tent-poles around it.  By day we spread our blanket over the poles for a tent. At night we lay down upon the overcoat and covered ourselves with the blanket.  It required considerable stretching to make it go over five; the two out side fellows used to get very chilly, and squeeze the three inside ones until they felt no thicker than a wafer.  But it had to do, and we took turns sleeping on the outside.  In the course of a few weeks three of my chums died and left myself and B. B. Andrews (now Dr. Andrews, of Astoria, Ill.) sole heirs to and occupants of, the overcoat and blanket.     CHAPTER XXV.  THE \"PLYMOUTH PILGRIMS\"--SAD TRANSITION FROM COMFORTABLE BARRACKS TO ANDERSONVILLE--A CRAZED PENNSYLVANIAN--DEVELOPMENT OF THE BUTLER BUSINESS.  We awoke one morning, in the last part of April, to find about two thousand freshly arrived prisoners lying asleep in the main streets running from the gates.  They were attired in stylish new uniforms, with fancy hats and shoes; the Sergeants and Corporals wore patent leather or silk chevrons, and each man had a large, well-filled knapsack, of the kind new recruits usually carried on coming first to the front, and which the older soldiers spoke of humorously as \"bureaus.\"  They were the snuggest, nattiest lot of soldiers we had ever seen, outside of the \"paper collar\" fellows forming the headquarter guard of some General in a large City.  As one of my companions surveyed them, he said:  \"Hulloa!  I'm blanked if the Johnnies haven't caught a regiment of Brigadier Generals, somewhere.\"  By-and-by the \"fresh fish,\" as all new arrivals were termed, began to wake up, and then we learned that they belonged to a brigade consisting of the Eighty-Fifth New York, One Hundred and First and One Hundred and Third Pennsylvania, Sixteenth Connecticut, Twenty-Fourth New York Battery, two companies of Massachusetts heavy artillery, and a company of the Twelfth New York Cavalry.  They had been garrisoning Plymouth, N. C., an important seaport on the Roanoke River.  Three small gunboats assisted them in their duty.  The Rebels constructed a powerful iron clad called the \"Albemarle,\" at a point further up the Roanoke, and on the afternoon of the 17th, with her and three brigades of infantry, made an attack upon the post. The \"Albemarle\" ran past the forts unharmed, sank one of the gunboats, and drove the others away.  She then turned her attention to the garrison, which she took in the rear, while the infantry attacked in front.  Our men held out until the 20th, when they capitulated. They were allowed to retain their personal effects, of all kinds, and, as is the case with all men in garrison, these were considerable.  The One Hundred and First and One Hundred and Third Pennsylvania and Eighty-Fifth New York had just \"veteranized,\" and received their first instalment of veteran bounty.  Had they not been attacked they would have sailed for home in a day or two, on their veteran furlough, and this accounted for their fine raiment.  They were made up of boys from good New York and Pennsylvania families, and were, as a rule, intelligent and fairly educated.  Their horror at the appearance of their place of incarceration was beyond expression.  At one moment they could not comprehend that we dirty and haggard tatterdemalions had once been clean, self-respecting, well-fed soldiers like themselves; at the next they would affirm that they knew they could not stand it a month, in here we had then endured it from four to nine months.  They took it, in every way, the hardest of any prisoners that came in, except some of the 'Hundred-Days' men, who were brought in in August, from the Valley of Virginia.  They had served nearly all their time in various garrisons along the seacoast--from Fortress Monroe to Beaufort--where they had had comparatively little of the actual hardships of soldiering in the field.  They had nearly always had comfortable quarters, an abundance of food, few hard marches or other severe service. Consequently they were not so well hardened for Andersonville as the majority who came in.  In other respects they were better prepared, as they had an abundance of clothing, blankets and cooking utensils, and each man had some of his veteran bounty still in possession.  It was painful to see how rapidly many of them sank under the miseries of the situation.  They gave up the moment the gates were closed upon them, and began pining away.  We older prisoners buoyed ourselves up continually with hopes of escape or exchange.  We dug tunnels with the persistence of beavers, and we watched every possible opportunity to get outside the accursed walls of the pen.  But we could not enlist the interest of these discouraged ones in any of our schemes, or talk. They resigned themselves to Death, and waited despondingly till he came.  A middle-aged One Hundred and First Pennsylvanian, who had taken up his"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4258"],["title","Andersonville: A Story of Rebel Military Prisons — Volume 2 (#2)"],["body","near me, was an object of peculiar interest.  Reasonably intelligent and fairly read, I presume that he was a respectable mechanic before entering the Army.  He was evidently a very domestic man, whose whole happiness centered in his family.  When he first came in he was thoroughly dazed by the greatness of his misfortune.  He would sit for hours with his face in his hands and his elbows on his knees, gazing out upon the mass of men and huts, with vacant, lack-luster eyes.  We could not interest him in anything. We tried to show him how to fix his blanket up to give him some shelter, but he went at the work in a disheartened way, and finally smiled feebly and stopped.  He had some letters from his family and a melaineotype of a plain-faced woman--his wife--and her children, and spent much time in looking at them.  At first he ate his rations when he drew them, but finally began to reject, them.  In a few days he was delirious with hunger and homesick ness.  He would sit on the sand for hours imagining that he was at his family table, dispensing his frugal hospitalities to his wife and children.  Making a motion, as if presenting a dish, he would say:  \"Janie, have another biscuit, do!\"  Or,  \"Eddie, son, won't you have another piece of this nice steak?\"  Or,  \"Maggie, have some more potatos,\" and so on, through a whole family of six, or more.  It was a relief to us when he died in about a month after he came in.  As stated above, the Plymouth men brought in a large amount of money --variously estimated at from ten thousand to one hundred thousand dollars. The presence of this quantity of circulating medium immediately started a lively commerce.  All sorts of devices were resorted to by the other prisoners to get a little of this wealth.  Rude chuck-a-luck boards were constructed out of such material as was attainable, and put in operation. Dice and cards were brought out by those skilled in such matters. As those of us already in the Stockade occupied all the ground, there was no disposition on the part of many to surrender a portion of their space without exacting a pecuniary compensation.  Messes having ground in a good location would frequently demand and get ten dollars for permission for two or three to quarter with them.  Then there was a great demand for poles to stretch blankets over to make tents; the Rebels, with their usual stupid cruelty, would not supply these, nor allow the prisoners to go out and get them themselves.  Many of the older prisoners had poles to spare which they were saying up for fuel.  They sold these to the Plymouth folks at the rate of ten dollars for three--enough to put up a blanket.  The most considerable trading was done through the gates.  The Rebel guards were found quite as keen to barter as they had been in Richmond. Though the laws against their dealing in the money of the enemy were still as stringent as ever, their thirst for greenbacks was not abated one whit, and they were ready to sell anything they had for the coveted currency.  The rate of exchange was seven or eight dollars in Confederate money for one dollar in greenbacks.  Wood, tobacco, meat, flour, beans, molasses, onions and a villainous kind of whisky made from sorghum, were the staple articles of trade.  A whole race of little traffickers in these articles sprang up, and finally Selden, the Rebel Quartermaster, established a sutler shop in the center of the North Side, which he put in charge of Ira Beverly, of the One Hundredth Ohio, and Charlie Huckleby, of the Eighth Tennessee.  It was a fine illustration of the development of the commercial instinct in some men.  No more unlikely place for making money could be imagined, yet starting in without a cent, they contrived to turn and twist and trade, until they had transferred to their pockets a portion of the funds which were in some one else's. The Rebels, of course, got nine out of every ten dollars there was in the prison, but these middle men contrived to have a little of it stick to their fingers.  It was only the very few who were able to do this.  Nine hundred and ninety-nine out of every thousand were, like myself, either wholly destitute of money and unable to get it from anybody else, or they paid out what money they had to the middlemen, in exorbitant prices for articles of food.  The N'Yaarkers had still another method for getting food, money, blankets and clothing.  They formed little bands called \"Raiders,\" under the leadership of a chief villain.  One of these bands would select as their victim a man who had good blankets, clothes, a watch, or greenbacks. Frequently he would be one of the little traders, with a sack of beans, a piece of meat, or something of that kind.  Pouncing upon him at night they would snatch away his possessions, knock down his friends who came to his assistance, and scurry away into the darkness.     CHAPTER XXVI.  LONGINGS FOR GOD'S COUNTRY--CONSIDERATIONS OF THE METHODS OF GETTING THERE--EXCHANGE AND ESCAPE--DIGGING TUNNELS, AND THE DIFFICULTIES CONNECTED THEREWITH--PUNISHMENT OF A TRAITOR.  To our minds the world now contained but two grand divisions, as widely different from each other as happiness and misery.  The first--that portion over which our flag floated was usually spoken of as \"God's Country;\" the other--that under the baneful shadow of the banner of rebellion--was designated by the most opprobrious epithets at the speaker's command.  To get from the latter to the former was to attain, at one bound, the highest good.  Better to be a doorkeeper in the House of the Lord, under the Stars and Stripes, than to dwell in the tents of wickedness, under the hateful Southern Cross.  To take even the humblest and hardest of service in the field now would be a delightsome change.  We did not ask to go home--we would be content with anything, so long as it was in that blest place \"within our lines.\" Only let us get back once, and there would be no more grumbling at rations or guard duty--we would willingly endure all the hardships and privations that soldier flesh is heir to.  There were two ways of getting back--escape and exchange.  Exchange was like the ever receding mirage of the desert, that lures the thirsty traveler on over the parched sands, with illusions of refreshing springs, only to leave his bones at last to whiten by the side of those of his unremembered predecessors.  Every day there came something to build up the hopes that exchange was near at hand--every day brought something to extinguish the hopes of the preceding one.  We took these varying phases according to our several temperaments.  The sanguine built themselves up on the encouraging reports; the desponding sank down and died under the discouraging ones.  Escape was a perpetual allurement.  To the actively inclined among us it seemed always possible, and daring, busy brains were indefatigable in concocting schemes for it.  The only bit of Rebel brain work that I ever saw for which I did not feel contempt was the perfect precautions taken to prevent our escape.  This is shown by the fact that, although, from first to last, there were nearly fifty thousand prisoners in Andersonville, and three out of every five of these were ever on the alert to take French leave of their captors, only three hundred and twenty-eight succeeded in getting so far away from Andersonville as to leave it to be presumed that they had reached our lines.  The first, and almost superhuman difficulty was to get outside the Stockade.  It was simply impossible to scale it.  The guards were too close together to allow an instant's hope to the most sanguine, that he could even pass the Dead Line without being shot by some one of them. This same closeness prevented any hope of bribing them.  To be successful half those on post would have to be bribed, as every part of the Stockade was clearly visible from every other part, and there was no night so dark as not to allow a plain view to a number of guards of the dark figure outlined against the light colored logs of any Yankee who should essay to clamber towards the top of the palisades.  The gates were so carefully guarded every time they were opened as to preclude hope of slipping out through theme.  They were only unclosed twice or thrice a day--once to admit, the men to call the roll, once to let them out again, once to let the wagons come in with rations, and once, perhaps, to admit, new prisoners.  At all these times every precaution was taken to prevent any one getting out surreptitiously.  This narrowed down the possibilities of passing the limits of the pen alive, to tunneling.  This was also surrounded by almost insuperable difficulties.  First, it required not less than fifty feet of subterranean excavation to get out, which was an enormous work with our limited means.  Then the logs forming the Stockade were set in the ground to a depth of five feet, and the tunnel had to go down beneath them. They had an unpleasant habit of dropping down into the burrow under them. It added much to the discouragements of tunneling to think of one of these massive timbers dropping upon a fellow as he worked his mole-like way under it, and either crushing him to death outright, or pinning him there to die of suffocation or hunger.  In one instance, in a tunnel near me, but in which I was not interested, the log slipped down after the digger had got out beyond it. He immediately began digging for the surface, for life, and was fortunately able to break through before he suffocated.  He got his head above the ground, and then fainted.  The guard outside saw him, pulled him out of the hole, and when he recovered sensibility hurried him back into the Stockade.  In another tunnel, also near us, a broad-shouldered German, of the Second Minnesota, went in to take his turn at digging.  He was so much larger than any of his predecessors that he stuck fast in a narrow part, and despite all the efforts of himself and comrades, it was found"]]]
