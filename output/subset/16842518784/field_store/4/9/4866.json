Daddy darling, you must!   Daddy come out and help Molly pick daisies!\"   And, since one's here, and the Spring's in the garden   (How many lives hence will that thought earn pardon?)   Since one's a man and man's heart is insistent,   And, since Nirvana is doubtful and distant,   Though life's a hard road and thorny to travel--   Stones in the borders and grass on the gravel,   Still there's the wisdom that wise men call folly,   Still one can go and pick daisies with Molly!     THE BEATIFIC VISION.    OH God! if I do my duty   And walk in the thorny way,   Will you pay me with heavens of beauty,   Millions of lives away?   Will you give me the music of heaven,   And the joy that none understands,   In place of what life would have given   If I had held out my hands?    I have lived in a narrow prison,   I have writhed 'neath a bitter creed,   And I dare to say that no heaven can pay   The renounced dream and deed,   But when my life's portal closes,   If you have no heaven to spare   God! give me a garden of roses,   And some one to walk with there.       II.     MUMMY WHEAT.    LAID close to Death, these many thousand years,   In this small seed Life hid herself and smiled;   So well she hid, Death was at least beguiled,   Set free the grain--and lo! the sevenfold ears!    Warmed by the sun, wooed by the wind's soft word,   Under blue canopy they hold their state:   For this, ah, was it not worth while to wait   Through all the centuries of hope deferred?    What could they know who laid the seed with Death   Of this Divine fruition fixed and planned?   Love--since Life parts us--lend my hand your hand   And look with me into the eyes of faith.    For here between your hand and mine there lies   A little seed we trust to Death to keep   Through unimagined centuries of sleep   Until the day when Life shall bid it rise.    Our harvest waits us. Who knows where or how,   What worlds away, wrapped in what coil of pain?   But Life shall bid us pluck gold sevenfold grain   Grown from the love she bids us bury now.     THE BEECH TREE.    MY beautiful beech, your smooth grey coat is trimmed   With letters. Once, each stood for all things dear   To foolish lovers, dead this many a year,   Whose lamp of lighted love so soon was dimmed.   You have seen them come and go,   And heard their kisses and vows   Under your boughs,   The pitiful vows they swore,   Have seen their poor tears flow,   Have seen them part; to meet, and to return, no more!    And in old winters, through your branches bare,   The north wind drove the blue home-scented smoke   That on the glowing Christmas hearth awoke   Where the old logs, with eager flicker and flare,   Sang their low crackling song   Of peace and of good will.   The old song is still,   The old voices have died away,   The hearth has been cold so long,   And the bright faces dimmed and covered up with clay.    And summer after summer wakes to glow   The ordered pleasance with the clipped box-hedge,   The drooping lilac by the old moat's edge,   The roses, that throw you kisses from below,   The orchard pink and white,   The sedge's whispered words,   The nesting birds,   All these return to revel round your feet.   And in the untroubled night   The nightingale still sings, the jasmine still is sweet.    My beautiful beech, I carve upon you here   The master-letter which begins her name   Through whom, to me, the royal summer came,   And nightingale and rose, and all things dear.   And, in some far-off time,   I shall come here, weary and old,   When the hearth in my heart is cold   And the birds that nest there flown;   I will remember this summer in all its prime   And say, \"There was a day--   Thank God, the Giver, an unforgotten day,   When I walked here, not alone,   --O God of pity and sorrow, not alone!\"     IN ABSENCE.    WAKE, do you wake in the dark in the strange far place,   Window and door not set like the ones we knew,   Leaning your face through the dark for another face,   Stretching your arms to the arms that are far from you,   Even as I, through the depth of this darkness, do?    Sleep, do you sleep in the house in the lonely land?   In the lonely room do you hear no steps draw near?   Do you miss in the darkness the hand that implores your hand,   See through the darkness your last dream disappear,   And weep, as I weep, in the outer darkness here?    Dream, do you dream? Nay, never a dream will stay,   Never a phantom is fond, or a vision kind.   Your dreams elude you and fly through the dark my way,   My dreams fly forth to you whom they may not find;   And we in the darkness weep, we weep and are left behind.     SILENCE.    So silent is the world to-night   The lamp gives silence out like light,   The latticed windows open wide   Show silence, like the night, outside:   The nightingale's faint song draws near   Like musical silence to mine ear.    The empty house calls not to me,   \"Here, but for fate, were thou and she--\"   Its gibe for once is checked. To-night   Silence is queen in grief's despite,   And even the longing of my soul   Is silent 'neath this hour's control.     RAISON D'ETRE.    O WEARY night, O weary day,   When heart's delight is far away!    What is the day? A frame of blue   The vacant-glaring sun grins through.   What is the night? A sable veil   Through which the moon peers tired and pale.    O weary day! O weary night!   How far away is heart's delight!    Love hung the sun in his high place   To give me light to see her face,   And love spread out the veil of night   To hide us two from all men's sight.    O kindly night, O pleasant day,   Your use is gone--why should ye stay?   My heart's delight is far away,   O weary night, O weary day.     THE ONLOOKER.    If I could make a pillow for your head,   Soft, pleasant, filled with every pretty thought;   If I could lay a carpet where you tread   Of all my life's most radiant fancies wrought,   And spread my love as canopy above you,   Your sleep, your steps should know how much I love you.    But--as life goes, to the old sorry tune--   I stand apart, I see thorns wound your feet,   Your sleeping eyes resenting sun and moon,   Your head lie restless on a breast unmeet--   And say no word, and suffer without moan,   Lest you should guess how much you are alone.     THE TREE OF KNOWLEDGE.    I PLUCKED the blossoms of delight   In many a wood and many a field,   I made a garland fair and bright   As any gardens yield.    But when I sought the living tree   To make new earth and Heaven new,   I found--alas for you and me--   Its roots were set in you.    Oh, dear my garden, where the fruit   Of lovely knowledge sweetly springs,   How jealously you guard the root   Of all enlightening things!     AT PARTING.    AND you could leave me now--   After the first remembered whispered vow   Which sings for ever and ever in my ears--   The vow which God among His Angels hears--   After the long-drawn years,   The slow hard tears,   Could break new ground, and wake   A new strange garden to blossom for your sake,   And leave me here alone,   In the old garden that was once our own?    How should I learn to bear   Our garden's pleasant ways and pleasant air,   Her flowers, her fruits, her lily, her rose and thorn,   When only in a picture these appear--   These, once alive, and always over-dear?   Ah--think again: the rose you used to wear   Must still be more than other roses be   The flower of flowers. Ah, pity, pity me!    For in my acres is no plot of ground   Whereon could any garden site be found,   I have but little skill   To water weed and till   And make the desert blossom like the rose;   Yet our old garden knows   If I have loved its ways and walks and kept   The garden watered, and the pleasance swept.    Yet--if you must--go now:   Go, with my blessing filling both your hands,   And, mid the desert sands   Which life drifts deep round every garden wall,   Make your new festival   Of bud and blossom--red rose and green leaf.   No blight born of my grief   Shall touch your garden, love; but my heart's prayer   Shall draw down blessings on you from the air,   And all we learned of leaf and plant and tree   Shall serve you when you walk no more with me   In garden ways; and when with her you tread   The pleasant ways with blossoms overhead   And when she asks, \"How did you come to know   The secrets of the ways these green things grow?\"   Then you will answer--and I, please God, hear,   \"I had another garden once, my dear\".     SONG.    I HEAR the waves to-night   Piteously calling, calling   Though the light   Of the kind moon is falling,   Like kisses, on the sea   That calls for sunshine, dear, as my soul calls for thee.    I see the sea lie gray   Wrinkling her brows in sorrow,   Hear her say:--   \"Bright love of yesterday, return to-morrow,   Sun, I am thine, am thine!\"   Oh sea, thy love will come again, but what of mine?     RENUNCIATION.    ROSE of the desert of my heart,   Moon of the night that is my soul,   Thou can'st not know how sweet thou art,   Nor what wild tides thy beams control.    For all thy heart a garden is,   Thy soul is like a dawn of May.   And garden and dawn might both be his,   Who from them both must turn away.    Oh, garden of the Spring's delight!   Oh, dewy dawn of perfect noon!   I will not pluck thy roses white   Or warm thy May-time into June.    I can but bless thee, moon and rose,   And journey far and very far   To where the night no moonbeam shows,   To where no happy roses are!       III.     THE VEIL OF MAYA.     SWEET, I have loved before. I know   This longing that invades my days;   This shape that haunts life's busy ways   I know since long and long ago.    This starry mystery of delight   That floats across my eager eyes,   This pain that"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4513"],["title","The Rainbow and the Rose (#2)"],["body","earth Paradise,   These magic songs of day and night--    I know them for the things they are:   A passing pain, a longing fleet,   A shape that soon I shall not meet,   A fading dream of veil and star.    Yet, even as my lips proclaim   The wisdom that the years have lent,   Your absence is joy's banishment,   And life's one music is your name.    I love you to my heart's hid core:   Those other loves? how should one learn   From marshlights how the great fires burn?   Ah, no! I never loved before!     SONG.    THE sunshine of your presence lies   On the glad garden of my heart   And bids the leaves of silence part   To show the flowers to your dear eyes,   And flower on flower blooms there and dies   And still new buds awakened spring,   For sunshine makes the garden wise,   To know the time for blossoming.    Night is no time for blossoming,   Your garden then dreams otherwise,   Of vanished Summer, vanished Spring,   And how the dearest flower first dies.   Yet from your ministering eyes   Though night hath drawn me far apart   On the still garden of my heart   The moonlight of your memory lies.     TO VERA, WHO ASKED A SONG.    IF I only had time!   I could make you a rhyme.   But my time is kept flying   By smiling and sighing   And living and dying for you.   The song-seed, I sow it,   I water and hoe it,   But never can grow it.   Ah, traitress, you know it!   What is a poor poet to do?    Ah, let me take breath!   I am harried to death   By the loves and the graces   That crowd where your face is   That lurk in your laces and throng.   Call them off for a minute,   Once let me begin it   The devil is in it   If I can not spin it   As sweet as a linnet, your song!     THE POET TO HIS LOVE.    ALL the flight of thoughts here, shy, bold, scared, intrusive,   Fluttering in the sun, between the green and blue,   Wheeling, whirling, poising, lovely and elusive,   How to cage the flying thoughts, my winged delight, for you?    Set a springe of rhyme, and hope to catch them in it?   Strew my love as grain to lure them to the snare?   Watch the hours built up, slow minute piled on minute?   Still the wide sky guards their flight, and still the cage is bare.    Gleam of hovering feathers, brushing me to flout me!   Wings, be weary! Rest! Who loves you more than I?   Caught? Oh fluttering pinions whitening air about me!   Rustling wings, and distant flight, and empty cage and sky!     THE MAIDEN'S PRAYER.    SPRING, pretty Spring, what treasure do you bring to me?   Green grass and buttercups, cherry-bloom and may?   Sunshine to be glad with me, and little birds to sing to me?   Warm nests to call me along the woodland way?    Spring, happy Spring, what wonder will you do for me?   Light the tulip lanterns, and set the furze a-fire?   Fill your sky with sails of cloud on waves of living blue for me?   Show me green cornfields and budding of the briar?    Spring, darling Spring, my days will not return to me,   You who see them fleeting, you, all time above,   You who move the whole world's heart, ah move one heart to turn to me,   --Bring me a lover, and teach me how to love!     SONG.    \"LOVE me little, love me long,\"   Is the burden of my song,   And if nothing more may be   Little shall suffice for me.    But if you could crown with flowers   All my radiant, festal hours,   And console for hours of sorrow   Love me more with each to-morrow.    And if you would turn my days   To one splendid hymn of praise,   And set hopes like stars above me   Love me much, and always love me!     THE MAGIC FLOWER.    THROUGH many days and many days   The seed of love lay hidden close;   We walked the dusty tiresome ways   Where never a leaf or blossom grows.   And in the darkness, all the while,   The little seed its heart uncurled,   And we by many a weary mile   Travelled towards it, round the world.    To the hid centre of the maze   At last we came, and there we found--   O happy day, O day of days!   --Twin seed-leaves breaking holy ground.   We dropped life's joys, a garnered sheaf,   And spell-bound watched, still hour by hour,   Magic on magic, leaf by leaf,   The unfolding of our love's white flower.     LA DERNIERE ROBE DE SOI.    OH, silken gown, all pink and pretty,   Bought, quite a bargain, in the City,   Your ill-trained soul full false has played me--   No Paris gown would have betrayed me.    You knew, my pretty silken treasure,   I must not wed for love or pleasure,   But for a settlement and title;   Yet you encouraged his recital!    He said--oh, faithless gown, you listened   While on your sheen two tear drops glistened--   He said . . . let love to music set it,   I'll never speak it--nor forget it!    \"No, no!\" I cried, I tried to save you--   False gown, you showed the tears I gave you!   You looked discreet when first I found you.   How could you let his arm go round you?    You darling dress--I'll smooth your creases,   I'll wear you till you drop to pieces;   But poor men's wives wear cotton only--   Dear gown--I hope you won't feel lonely!     THE LEAST POSSIBLE.    DEAR goddess of the shining shrine   Where all my votive tapers burn,   Where every gold-embroidered thought   And all my flowers of life are brought   --With many, alas! that are not mine--   What will you give me in return?    The bow in Bond Street--in the Park   The smile all worship on your lips,   The courteous word at dinner--dance--   But never a blush--a conscious glance;   At most, at Henley, in the dark,   Your fleet mistaken finger-tips?    Ah, just for once, once only, be   An altar-server--stoop and set me   Upon the altar richly wrought   Of your most secret flower-sweet thought:   One nightlight's flicker burn for me   Before you sleep and quite forget me.     EN TOUT CAS.    WHEN I am glad I need your eyes   To be the stars of Paradise;   Your lips to be the seal of all   The joy life grants, and dreams recall;   Your hand, to lie my hands between   What time we walk the garden green.    But most in grief I need your face   To lean to mine in the desert place;   Your lips to mock the evil years,   To sweeten me my cup of tears,   Your eyes to shine, in cloud's despite,   Your hands to hold mine through the night.     APPEAL.    Daphnis dearest, wherefore weave me   Webs of lies lest truth should grieve me?   I could pardon much, believe me:   Dower me, Daphnis, or bereave me,   Kill me, kill me, love me, leave me--   Damn me, dear, but don't deceive me!     ST. VALENTINE'S DAY.    THE South is a dream of flowers   With a jewel for sky and sea,   Rose-crowns for the dancing hours,   Gold fruits upon every tree;   But cold from the North   The wind blows forth   That blows my love to me.    The stars in the South are gold   Like lamps between sky and sea;   The flowers that the forests hold   Like stars between tree and tree;   But little and white   Is the pale moon's light   That lights my love to me.    In the South the orange grove   Makes dusk by the dusky sea,   White palaces wrought for love   Gleam white between tree and tree,   But under bare boughs   Is the little house   Warm-lit for my love and me.     CHAGRIN D'AMOUR.    IF Love and I were all alone   I might forget to grieve,   And for his pleasure and my own   Might happier garlands weave;   But you sit there, and watch us wear   The mourning wreaths you wove:   And while such mocking eyes you bear   I am not friends with Love.    Withdraw those cruel eyes, and let   Me search the garden through   That I may weave, ere Love be set,   The wreath of Love for you;   Till you, whom Love so well adorns,   Its hidden thorns discover,   And know at last what crown of thorns   It was you gave your lover.     BRIDAL EVE.    GOOD-NIGHT, my Heart, my Heart, good-night--   Oh, good and dear and fair,   With lips of life and eyes of light   And roses in your hair.    To-morrow brings the other crown,   The orange blossoms, Sweet,   And then the rose will be cast down   With lilies at your feet.    But in your soul a garden stands   Where fair the white rose blows--   God, teach my foolish clumsy hands   The way to tend my rose.    That in the white-rose garden still   The lily may bloom fair   God help my heart and soul and will   To keep the lily there.     LOVE AND LIFE.    LOVE only sings when Love is young,   When Love is young and still at play,   How shall we count the sweet songs sung   When Love and Joy kept holiday?   But now Love has to earn his bread   By lifelong stress and toil of tears,   He finds his nest of song-birds dead   That sang so sweet in other years.    For Love's a man now, strong and brave,   To fight for you, for you to live,   And Love, that once such bright songs gave,   Has better things than songs to give;   He gives you now a lifelong faith,   A hand to help in joy or pain,   And he will sing no more, till Death   Shall come to make him young again!     FROM THE ITALIAN.    AS a little child whom his mother has chidden,   Wrecked in the dark in a storm of weeping,   Sleeps with his tear-stained eyes closed hidden   And, with fists clenched, sobs still in his sleeping,    So in my breast sleeps Love, O white lady,   What does he care though the rest are playing,   With rattles and drums in the woodlands shady,   Happy children, whom Joy takes maying!    Ah, do not wake him, lest you should hear him   Scolding the others, breaking their rattles,   Smashing their drums, when their play comes near him--   Love who, for me, is a god of battles!       IV.     \"OUT OF THE FULNESS OF THE HEART THE MOUTH SPEAKETH.\"    In answer to those who have said that English Poets   give no personal love to their country.    ENGLAND, my country, austere in the clamorous council of nations,   Set in the seat of the mighty, wielding the sword of the strong,   Have we but sung of your glory, firm in eternal foundations?   Are not your woods and your meadows the core of our heart and our song?   O dear fields of my country, grass growing green, glowing"]]]
