Then there was a picture of an Orkney midsummer midnight--just such a night, the officer of the watch told me, as the one on which he had seen the _Hampshire_, with Kitchener pacing the quarter-deck alone, pass out to her doom two years previously--with a fitful green light flooding the Flow, reflected from the sun circling just below the northern horizon, and every kite balloon in the air at the time being torn from its cable and sent flying towards Scandinavia before the ninety-mile gale which had sprung up from nowhere without warning.  Visions of golf on Flotta, picnics under the cliffs of Hoy, and climbs up the peat-boggy sides of the Ward Hill of the \"Mainland,\" gave place to those of squadron boxing competitions--savage but cleanly fought bouts in a squared circle under the elevated guns of \"Q\" turret, with the funnels, superstructures, and improvised grandstands alive with bluejackets--and regattas, pulled off in various and sundry craft between the long lines of anchored battleships. A long series (these more like panoramas) of hurried unmoorings and departures--by division, by squadron, and with all the Grand Fleet, through every square mile of the North Sea from the Bight to far up the coast of Norway--finished up at Rosyth, in that strange fortnight just before the end, when all but those on the \"inside\" thought the persistent \"short notice\" was due to a desire to keep the men aboard on account of the 'flu, and not to the fact of which the Admiralty appear to have been so well advised, that the German naval authorities--for the first and last time--were making desperate efforts to get their ships out for the long-deferred _Tag_.  Then the fog-bank ahead--or so it seemed--was splashed with the gay colour of \"Armistice Night,\" when all the spare signal lights (to say nothing of a lot that couldn't be spared) of the Grand Fleet streaked the sky with joyous spurts and fountains of fire, when stealthy pirate bands from the K-boats dropped through the ward-room skylights of the light cruisers and carried off prisoners who had to be ransomed with champagne, when Admirals danced with matelots on the forecastles of the battle-cruisers, and all the pent-up feelings of four years ascended in one great expansive \"whouf\" of gladness. I recalled with a chuckle how the \"General\" signal which the Commander-in-Chief had made ordering the historic occasion to be celebrated by \"splicing the main brace\" according to immemorial custom in the Navy, was preceded by \"Negative 6th B.S.,\" in consideration of the sad fact that the Yankee ships had nothing aboard to \"splice\" with. That didn't prevent them, though, from bending a white ensign on their flag halliards, hoisting it to the main topmast of the _New York_, and illuminating it with all the searchlights of the squadron. That happy tribute, I recalled, to the flag of the Navy with which the Americans had served with such distinction for a year, had started the sacking of the signal light lockers, and that picture ended as it began, with the dour Scotch heavens lanced with coloured flame spurts which the dark tide of the Firth gave back in crinkly reflections.  The next picture to sharpen into focus on the fog-curtain was that of a long, trim three-funnelled cruiser, with a white flag at her fore and the German naval ensign at her main, heading in toward the mouth of the Firth of Forth under the escort of a squadron of British light cruisers and destroyers. I had witnessed the meeting of the _Königsberg_, which was bringing over Admiral Meurer and other German naval officers to arrange the details of the surrender of the High Sea Fleet, from the foretop of the _Cassandra_. The rendezvous, at which the _Königsberg_ had been directed by wireless to meet the Sixth Light Cruiser Squadron ordered to escort her in, chanced to fall in an area under which a German submarine, a fortnight previously, had planted its full load of mines. These, in the regular course of patrol, had been discovered and swept up within a day or two, but since that fact had not been communicated to the Germans, the _Königsberg_, doubtless thinking the English sense of humour had prompted them to prepare for her a bit of a surprise in the way of a lift by a German petard, skulked off to the southward, where she was only rounded up after two hours of rending the ether with wireless calls. There were two things I remembered especially in connection with that historic meeting--one was the mob of civilians (probably would-be delegates from the Workmen's and Soldiers' Council) jostling the officers on the roomy bridge of the _Königsberg_, and the other was the fluent cursing of the gunnery lieutenant of the _Cassandra_, who was with me in the foretop, over the unkind fate which had robbed him of the chance of opening up with his six-inch guns on the first Hun warship he had set eyes on since the war began. I thought I had heard in the course of the past year all that the British sailor had to say of the German as a naval foe; but L---- said several new things that afternoon, and said them well.  Poor old _Cassandra_! Although we did not get word of it until a day or two after our arrival in Wilhelmshaven, within a very few hours of the time I was thinking of her there in the fog of the Bight, she had collided with a mine in the Baltic and gone to the bottom.  There was another picture of the _Königsberg_ ready to follow on as the first dissolved. This was the brilliantly lighted hull of her--the only undarkened ship of the hundreds in the Firth of Forth that night--as I saw it an hour before daybreak the following morning, when I set off from the _Cassandra_ in a motor launch to be present in the _Queen Elizabeth_ during the historic conference which was to take place there that day. Admiral Beatty had refused to receive the revolutionary delegates at the preliminary conference which had been held in the British flagship the previous night, and as a consequence it appears that Admiral Meurer and his staff were summoned to make a report to their \"superiors\" on their return. This strange meeting had been convened shortly after midnight (so the captain of the M.L., which had been patrolling round the _Königsberg_ all night, told me), but still, five hours later, as \"M.L. 262\" slid quietly by at quarter speed, the rumble of guttural Teutonic voices raised in heated argument welled out of the open scuttles of what had probably been the ward-room. It occurred to me even then that this rumble of angry dispute was prophetic of what Germany had ahead in the long night that was closing upon her.  Although \"M.L. 262\" ended up an hour later with her propellers tangled in the cable of Ox-Guard boom, I managed to get on the flagship in time to see Admiral Meurer and his party come climbing up out of the fog to her quarter-deck. The conference lasted, with short intervals, until long after dark, and the next picture I saw was that of five German naval officers, chagrined and crestfallen, being piped over the side to the barge which was to take them to the destroyer standing by in the fog to return with them to the _Königsberg_ at her anchorage, Inchkeith. It was \"Officers' Night\" for the kinema in the \"Q.E.,\" and they were showing a \"made-in-California\" film called the \"Rise and Fall of Julius Cæsar.\" I remember distinctly that Casca had just driven the first thrust, and the mob of conspirators were thronging upon Cæsar round the \"base of Pompey's statue,\" when the commander sent me word that the guests were about to depart.  The captain of the fleet, the captain, the commander, the officer of the watch and the boatswain were waiting at the head of the starboard gangway as I stepped on deck, and out of the fog, which had thickened till I could not see the muzzles of the guns of \"Y\" turret, the Germans were advancing from aft. The frown on Admiral Meurer's heavy brows was magnified by the cross light of the \"yard-arm group\" at the gangway, and his mouth, with its thin hard lips, showed as a straight black line. With a click of the heels and the characteristic automaton bow of the German, he saluted the British officers in turn, beginning with the captain of the fleet, stepped down the short gangway and disappeared into the waiting barge to the shrilling of the pipes. Bowing and clicking, the others followed suit, a weedy \"sub,\" with an enormous roll of papers under his arm, going over last.  The _Oak_, herself invisible in the fog, groped blindly with her searchlight to pick up the barge. \"We must hold the light steady,\" facetiously quoted the Press correspondent at my elbow from a speech of President Wilson's which had appeared in the morning papers, and then added thoughtfully, \"It may be a _light_ that kind need for guidance, but if I had the leading of them for the next generation it would be by a ring in the nose.\"  Now, panorama resumed. It was the day of the surrender, and the _Cardiff_, with her high-flown kite balloon in tow, was leading the line of German battle-cruisers out of the eastern mist. I was watching from the bridge of the _Erin_, and an officer beside me, recognizing the _Seydlitz_, flying the rear-admiral's flag, in the lead, with the _Moltke_ and _Derfflinger_ next in line, told how, from the light cruiser in which he had chased them at Dogger Bank, he had seen at least two of the three, leaving the _Blücher_ to her fate, dashing for the shelter of their minefields with flames swirling about their mastheads. Another spoke casually of how, in the _Tiger_ at Jutland, he had been for a wild minute or two, while his ship was rounding a \"windy corner\" as Beatty turned north to meet the British Battle Fleet, under the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/42374"],["title","To Kiel in the 'Hercules' (#2)"],["body","fire of all the battle-cruisers--with the exception of the _Hindenburg_, but with the _Lützow_ added--now steaming past us. We remarked the \"flattery of imitation\" in the resemblance of the _Hindenburg_ with her long run of forecastle and \"flare\" bows, to the _Repulse_ and _Renown_, and of the symmetrical, two-funnelled _Bayern_ as she appeared between the _Kaisers_ and the _Königs_ in the German battleship line to the British _Queen Elizabeth_ class laid down before the war. The _Queen Elizabeth_ herself, falling out of line to take the salute of the ships of the fleet she had led to victory as they passed, brought that reel of panorama to an end.  The next was of five ships of the _Kaiser_ class, as they had appeared from the _Emperor of India_, which, with the rest of the Second Division, was escorting a squadron of the enemy to Scapa for internment. We saw the German ships at closer range now, and the better we saw them the worse they looked. Their fine solidity was less impressive than from a distance, for now our glasses revealed the filth of the decks, the lack of paint, and the slovenly, sullen attitude of the motley garbed figures lounging along the rails. We passed within a biscuit toss of the _Kaiserin_ when their leading ship, the _Friedrich der Grosse_, lost her bearings in some way and failed to follow the _Canada_ through the anti-submarine boom off the end of Flotta, an action which only the smartest kind of seamanship on the part of the division of _Iron Dukes_ prevented from developing into a serious disaster. Most of the Huns--to judge by the expression on the faces leering across at us--would have welcomed a smash; but it was avoided by a hair, and they ultimately straightened themselves out, straggled through into the Flow, and on to their more or less final resting-place, off the inner entrance to Gutter Sound.  The final picture, as it chanced, which my fancy projected on the curtain of the fog was one that embraced what I saw from the steam pinnace which was taking me to the _Impérieuse_, on my way back to Rosyth. An angry Orkney sunset was flaring over the hills of Hoy--a sullenly red glow, gridironed by thin strata of black cloud like the bars of a grate--and a sinister squall was advancing from the direction of Stromness to the northward. For a few moments the hot light of the sunset had silhouetted the confused hulls of battleships and battle-cruisers against the silvered seas beyond, and revealed the disordered phalanx of the moored destroyers blocking the mouth of Gutter Sound; then it was quenched by the onrush of the storm clouds, and all that was left of the High Seas Fleet disappeared into shadow and driving rain.  It was a far cry, I reflected, from the Kaiser's \"Our future lies upon the seas!\" and Admiral Rodman's \"The German ships are of no use to anybody; the simplest solution of the problem of their disposition is to take the whole lot to sea and sink them.\" And yet--  Suddenly, stereoscopically clear, on the blank sheet of the fog left as the High Sea Fleet faded from sight, the head-on silhouette of an unmistakably German light cruiser appeared. For an instant the soaring mast and the broad bridge suggested that my fancy had materialized the _Königsberg_ again. Then the rat-a-tat of a signal searchlight recalled me to my senses, and it did not need the chief yeoman of signals' \"There she is, sir; sending away a boat to bring us a pilot,\" to tell me we had finally rendezvoused with the _Regensburg_. I descended to the quarter-deck to see the pilot come over the side.  Very smartly handled was that cutter from the _Regensburg_. I remember that especially because it was almost the only German boat that came alongside during all the visit which did not either ram the gangway, or else miss it more than the length of a boat-hook. They explained this by saying that most of the skilled men had left the navy, and that their boats, as a consequence, were in the hands of comparative novices. At any rate, at least one first-class crew of boat-pullers had remained in the _Regensburg_, and they brought their cutter alongside the gangway as neatly as though the _Hercules_ were lying in harbour.  Three men, each carrying a small suit-case, came over the side and saluted the officer of the day and the intelligence officer of the admiral's staff, who awaited them at the head of the gangway. The first was a three-stripe officer of the rank the Germans call Korvettenkapitän, the second a warrant officer, and the third (as we presently were informed) a qualified merchant pilot. The Korvettenkapitän was slender of figure, and had a well-bred, gentlemanly appearance not in the least suggestive of the \"Hunnishness\" one associated--and with good reason, too, as subsequent experience proved--with the German naval officer. His flushed expression showed plainly that he felt deeply the humiliation of the task assigned him of taking the first enemy warships into a German harbour. His head remained bowed a moment after his final salute; then he took a deep breath, squared his shoulders, and asked to be conducted to the bridge at once in order to take advantage of the improved visibility in pushing on in through the minefields.  If one felt a touch of involuntary sympathy for the senior naval officer, a glance at the sinister figure of the merchant pilot was an efficacious antidote. Thick-set and muscular of build, with slack-hanging ape-like arms and bandy legs, his corded bull neck was crowned with the prognathous-jawed head of a gorilla, and a countenance that might well have been a composite of the saturnine phizzes of Trotsky and Liebknecht. One knew in an instant that here was the super-Bolshevik, and looked for the red band on his sleeve, which could only have been temporarily removed while he appeared among the Engländers to spy upon the naval officer whom the revolutionists would not permit to act alone. The way things stood between the two became evident almost at once, for the officer informed the British interpreter at the first opportunity that he could not be responsible for the pilot, while the latter, when some query from the Korvettenkapitän respecting the position of a certain buoy was repeated to him, contented himself with drawing his fingers significantly across his throat, clucking in apparent imitation of a severed wind-pipe, and continuing the guzzling of the plate of \"kedgeree\" which had been engaging his undivided attention at the moment of interruption.  [Illustration: HELIGOLAND IN SIGHT!]  After putting a German pilot aboard each of the four destroyers, the _Regensburg's_ cutter was hoisted in, and we got under weigh again. The visibility had improved considerably, and presently a darker blur on the misty skyline resolved itself into the familiar profile of Heligoland. At first only the loom of the great cliff was discernible, but by the time this had been brought abeam a slender strip of low-lying ground with warehouses, cranes, and the masts of ships, was distinctly visible. All hands crowded to the starboard side to have a glimpse of Germany's famous island outpost, but the nearest thing to a demonstration I saw was by two marines, who were doing a bit of a shuffle on the precarious footing of a turret top and singing lustily:      \"Oh, won't it be grand out in Hel-i-go-land,     When we've wound up the Watch on the Rhine!\"  Whatever illusions they had formed of the \"grandness\" of Heligoland they were allowed to keep, for the only ones who were given to see at close range the dismal greyness of the island fortress were the members of one of the \"air\" parties, who made a hurried visit in a destroyer to see that the provisions of the Armistice had been carried out at the seaplane station.  The thickening fog-banks which shut off our view of Heligoland were not long in thinning the guiding _Regensburg_ to a dusky phantom nosing uncertainly into the misty smother in the direction of where our charts indicated the Bight should be narrowing to the shallow waters of Jade Bay, in an inner corner of which lay Wilhelmshaven. We had counted on getting there that evening, and a wireless had already been received saying that a German Naval Commission was standing by to come off for a preliminary conference. After heading in for a couple of hours through seas which I heard an officer coming off watch describe as \"composed of about equal parts of water, misplaced buoys and floating mines,\" all hopes of arriving that night were dashed by a signal from the _Regensburg_, saying that she had been compelled to anchor on account of the fog. Calling her destroyer \"chicks\" about her to mother them for the night, the _Hercules_ let go what was probably the first anchor a British surface ship had dropped into German mud since the outbreak of the war.  The unexpected delay made it necessary for both the _Hercules_ and the destroyer to put up their pilots for the night. This was managed in the former by giving the officer the flag captain's sea-cabin, and slinging hammocks for his two assistants outside. Doubtless the opportunity to enjoy a change of food was not unwelcome to any of them. They were served with the regular ward-room dinner. The officer declined the offer of drinks, and said he had his own cigarettes. The other two made a clean sweep of anything that they could get hold of. Even these had cigarettes, but the young signalman who had the temerity to smoke one which was proffered him in exchange for one of his own, advanced that as an excuse for a mess he made of taking down a searchlight signal from a destroyer two hours later.  \"That ---- Bolshevik,\" said the lad the next day, in telling me about the tragedy, \"declared the fag he giv' me was made of baccy smuggled into Germany by a friend of his. I tells him that was no kind of reason for him using me to smuggle the smoke out of Germany. And I tells him it tastes to me like rope end, that baccy, and, what's more, that I'd"]]]
