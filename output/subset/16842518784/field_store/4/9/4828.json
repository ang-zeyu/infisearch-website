Agostino seemed to awaken swiftly from his disguise of an absolute gravity.  A red light stood in his eyeballs, as if upon a fiery answer. The intemperate fit subsided.  Smoothing dawn his mottled grey beard with quieting hands, he took refuge in his habitual sententious irony.  \"My friend, I am not a hare in front of the king, nor am I a ram in the rear of him: I fly him not, neither do I propel him.  So, therefore, I cannot predict the movements of the king.  Will the wind blow from the north to-morrow, think you?\"  The mountaineer sent a quick gaze up the air, as to descry signs.  \"Who knows?\" Agostino continued, though not playing into the smiles of his companions; \"the wind will blow straight thither where there is a vacuum; and all that we can state of the king is, that there is a positive vacuum here.  It would be difficult to predict the king's movements save by such weighty indications.\"  He laid two fingers hard against the rib which shields the heart.  It had become apparently necessary for the speaker to relieve a mind surcharged with bile at the mention of the king; for, having done, he rebuked with an amazed frown the indiscretion of Carlo, who had shouted, \"The Carbonaro king!\"  \"Carlo, my son, I will lean on your arm.  On your mouth were better,\" Agostino added, under his voice, as they moved on.  \"Oh, but,\" Carlo remonstrated, \"let us trust somebody.  Milan has made me sick of late.  I like the look of that fellow.\"  \"You allow yourself, my Carlo, an immense indulgence in permitting yourself to like the look of anything.  Now, listen--Viva Carlo Alberto!\"  The old man rang out the loyal salutation spiritedly, and awoke a prompt response from the mountaineer, who sounded his voice wide in the keen upper air.  \"There's the heart of that fellow!\" said Agostino.  \"He has but one idea --his king!  If you confound it, he takes you for an enemy.  These free mountain breezes intoxicate you.  You would embrace the king himself if you met him here.\"  \"I swear I would never be guilty of the bad joke of crying a 'Viva' to him anywhere upon earth,\" Carlo replied.  \"I offend you,\" he said quickly.  The old man was smiling.  \"Agostino Balderini is too notoriously a bad joker to be offended by the comments of the perfectly sensible, boy of mine!  My limbs were stiff, and the first three steps from a place of rest reminded me acutely of the king's five years of hospitality.  He has saved me from all fatigue so long, that the necessity to exercise these old joints of mine touched me with a grateful sense of his royal bounty.  I had from him a chair, a bed, and a table: shelter from sun and from all silly chatter.  Now I want a chair or a bed.  I should like to sit at a table; the sun burns me; my ears are afflicted.  I cry \"Viva!\" to him that I may be in harmony with the coming chorus of Italy, which I prophetically hear.  That young fellow, in whom you confide so much, speaks for his country.  We poor units must not be discordant.  No! Individual opinion, my Carlo, is discord when there is a general delirium.  The tide arriving, let us make the best of the tide.  My voice is wisdom.  We shall have to follow this king!\"  \"Shall we!\" uttered one behind them gruffly.  \"When I see this king swallow one ounce of Austrian lead, I shall not be sorry to follow him!\"  \"Right, my dear Ugo,\" said Agostino, turning round to him; \"and I will then compose his hymn of praise.  He has swallowed enough of Austrian bread.  He took an Austrian wife to his bed.  Who knows?  he may some day declare a preference for Austrian lead.  But we shall have to follow him, or stay at home drivelling.\"  Agostino raised his eyes, that were glazed with the great heat of his frame.  \"Oh, that, like our Dante, I had lived in the days when souls were damned!  Then would I uplift another shout, believe me!  As things go now, we must allow the traitor to hope for his own future, and we simply shrug.  We cannot plant him neck-deep for everlasting in a burning marl, and hear him howling.  We have no weapons in these times--none!  Our curses come back to roost.  This is one of the serious facts of the century, and controls violent language.  What! are you all gathered about me?  Oracles must be moving, too.  There's no rest even for them, when they have got a mountain to scale.\"  A cry, \"He is there!\" and \"Do you see him?\" burst from the throats of men surrounding Agostino.  Looking up to the mountain's top, they had perceived the figure of one who stood with folded arms, sufficiently near for the person of an expected friend to be descried.  They waved their hats, and Carlo shot ahead.  The others trod after him more deliberately, but in glad excitement, speculating on the time which this sixth member of the party, who were engaged to assemble at a certain hour of the morning upon yonder height, had taken to reach the spot from Omegna, or Orta, or Pella, and rejoicing that his health should be so stout in despite of his wasting labours under city smoke.  \"Yes, health!\" said Agostino.  \"Is it health, do you think?  It's the heart of the man! and a heart with a mill-stone about it--a heart to breed a country from!  There stands the man who has faith in Italy, though she has been lying like a corpse for centuries.  God bless him! He has no other comfort.  Viva l'Italia!\"  The exclamation went up, and was acknowledged by him on the eminence overhanging them; but at a repetition of it his hand smote the air sideways.  They understood the motion, and were silent; while he, until Carlo breathed his name in his hearing, eyed the great scene stedfastly, with the absorbing simple passion of one who has endured long exile, and finds his clustered visions of it confronting the strange, beloved, visible life:--the lake in the arms of giant mountains: the far-spreading hazy plain; the hanging forests; the pointed crags; the gleam of the distant rose-shadowed snows that stretch for ever like an airy host, mystically clad, and baffling the eye as with the motions of a flight toward the underlying purple land.     CHAPTER II  He was a man of middle stature, thin, and even frail, as he stood defined against the sky; with the complexion of the student, and the student's aspect.  The attentive droop of his shoulders and head, the straining of the buttoned coat across his chest, the air as of one who waited and listened, which distinguished his figure, detracted from the promise of other than contemplative energy, until his eyes were fairly seen and felt.  That is, until the observer became aware that those soft and large dark meditative eyes had taken hold of him.  In them lay no abstracted student's languor, no reflex burning of a solitary lamp; but a quiet grappling force engaged the penetrating look.  Gazing upon them, you were drawn in suddenly among the thousand whirring wheels of a capacious and a vigorous mind, that was both reasoning and prompt, keen of intellect, acting throughout all its machinery, and having all under full command: an orbed mind, supplying its own philosophy, and arriving at the sword- stroke by logical steps,--a mind much less supple than a soldier's; anything but the mind of a Hamlet.  The eyes were dark as the forest's border is dark; not as night is dark.  Under favourable lights their colour was seen to be a deep rich brown, like the chestnut, or more like the hazeledged sunset brown which lies upon our western rivers in the winter floods, when night begins to shadow them.  The side-view of his face was an expression of classic beauty rarely now to be beheld, either in classic lands or elsewhere.  It was severe; the tender serenity of the full bow of the eyes relieved it.  In profile they showed little of their intellectual quality, but what some might have thought a playful luminousness, and some a quick pulse of feeling.  The chin was firm; on it, and on the upper lip, there was a clipped growth of black hair.  The whole visage widened upward from the chin, though not very markedly before it reached the broad-lying brows.  The temples were strongly indented by the swelling of the forehead above them: and on both sides of the head there ran a pregnant ridge, such as will sometimes lift men a deplorable half inch above the earth we tread.  If this man was a problem to others, he was none to himself; and when others called him an idealist, he accepted the title, reading himself, notwithstanding, as one who was less flighty than many philosophers and professedly practical teachers of his generation.  He saw far, and he grasped ends beyond obstacles: he was nourished by sovereign principles; he despised material present interests; and, as I have said, he was less supple than a soldier.  If the title of idealist belonged to him, we will not immediately decide that it was opprobrious.  The idealized conception of stern truths played about his head certainly for those who knew and who loved it.  Such a man, perceiving a devout end to be reached, might prove less scrupulous in his course, possibly, and less remorseful, than revolutionary Generals.  His smile was quite unclouded, and came softly as a curve in water.  It seemed to flow with, and to pass in and out of, his thoughts, to be a part of his emotion and his meaning when it shone transiently full.  For as he had an orbed mind, so had he an orbed nature.  The passions were absolutely in harmony with the intelligence. He had the English manner; a remarkable simplicity contrasting with the demonstrative outcries and gesticulations of his friends when they joined him on the height.  Calling them each by name, he received their caresses and took their hands; after which he touched the old man's shoulder.  \"Agostino, this has breathed you?\"  \"It has; it has, my dear and best one!\" Agostino replied.  \"But here is a good market-place for air.  Down below we have to scramble for it in the mire.  The spies are stifling down below.  I don't"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4435"],["title","Vittoria â€” Volume 1 (#2)"],["body","my own shadow.  I begin to think that I am important.  Footing up a mountain corrects the notion somewhat.  Yonder, I believe, I see the Grisons, where Freedom sits.  And there's the Monte della Disgrazia.  Carlo Alberto should be on the top of it, but he is invisible.  I do not see that Unfortunate.\"  \"No,\" said Carlo Ammiani, who chimed to his humour more readily than the rest, and affected to inspect the Grisons' peak through a diminutive opera-glass.  \"No, he is not there.\"  \"Perhaps, my son, he is like a squirrel, and is careful to run up t'other side of the stem.  For he is on that mountain; no doubt of it can exist even in the Boeotian mind of one of his subjects; myself, for example. It will be an effulgent fact when he gains the summit.\"  The others meantime had thrown themselves on the grass at the feet of their manifestly acknowledged leader, and looked up for Agostino to explode the last of his train of conceits.  He became aware that the moment for serious talk had arrived, and bent his body, groaning loudly, and uttering imprecations against him whom he accused of being the promoter of its excruciating stiffness, until the ground relieved him of its weight.  Carlo continued standing, while his eyes examined restlessly the slopes just surmounted by them, and occasionally the deep descent over the green-glowing Orta Lake.  It was still early morning.  The heat was tempered by a cool breeze that came with scents of thyme.  They had no sight of human creature anywhere, but companionship of Alps and birds of upper air; and though not one of them seasoned the converse with an exclamation of joy and of blessings upon a place of free speech and safety, the thought was in their hunted bosoms, delicious as a woodland rivulet that sings only to the leaves overshadowing it.  They were men who had sworn to set a nation free,--free from the foreigner, to begin with.  (He who tells this tale is not a partisan; he would deal equally toward all.  Of strong devotion, of stout nobility, of unswerving faith and self-sacrifice, he must approve; and when these qualities are displayed in a contest of forces, the wisdom of means employed, or of ultimate views entertained, may be questioned and condemned; but the men themselves may not be.)  These men had sworn their oath, knowing the meaning of it, and the nature of the Fury against whom men who stand voluntarily pledged to any great resolve must thenceforward match themselves.  Many of the original brotherhood had fallen, on the battle-field, on the glacis, or in the dungeon.  All present, save the youthfuller Carlo, had suffered. Imprisonment and exile marked the Chief.  Ugo Corte, of Bergamo, had seen his family swept away by the executioner and pecuniary penalties.  Thick scars of wounds covered the body and disfigured the face of Giulio Bandinelli.  Agostino had crawled but half-a-year previously out of his Piedmontese cell, and Marco Sana, the Brescian, had in such a place tasted of veritable torture.  But if the calamity of a great oath was upon them, they had now in their faithful prosecution of it the support which it gives.  They were unwearied; they had one object; the mortal anguish they had gone through had left them no sense for regrets.  Life had become the field of an endless engagement to them; and as in battle one sees beloved comrades struck down, and casts but a glance at their prostrate forms, they heard the mention of a name, perchance, and with a word or a sign told what was to be said of a passionate glorious heart at rest, thanks to Austrian or vassal-Sardinian mercy.  So they lay there and discussed their plans.  \"From what quarter do you apprehend the surprise?\" Ugo Corte glanced up from the maps and papers spread along the grass to question Carlo ironically, while the latter appeared to be keeping rigid watch over the safety of the position.  Carlo puffed the smoke of a cigarette rapidly, and Agostino replied for him:--  \"From the quarter where the best donkeys are to be had.\"  It was supposed that Agostino had resumed the habit usually laid aside by him for the discussion of serious matters, and had condescended to father a coarse joke; but his eyes showed no spark of their well-known twinkling solicitation for laughter, and Carlo spoke in answer gravely:--  \"From Baveno it will be.\"  \"From Baveno!  They might as well think to surprise hawks from Baveno. Keep watch, dear Ammiani; a good start in a race is a kick from the Gods.\"  With that, Corte turned to the point of his finger on the map.  He conceived it possible that Carlo Ammiani, a Milanese, had reason to anticipate the approach of people by whom he, or they, might not wish to be seen.  Had he studied Carlo's face he would have been reassured.  The brows of the youth were open, and his eyes eager with expectation, that showed the flying forward of the mind, and nothing of knotted distrust or wary watchfulness.  Now and then he would move to the other side of the mountain, and look over upon Orta; or with the opera-glass clasped in one hand beneath an arm, he stopped in his sentinel-march, frowning reflectively at a word put to him, as if debating within upon all the bearings of it; but the only answer that came was a sharp assent, given after the manner of one who dealt conscientiously in definite affirmatives; and again the glass was in requisition.  Marco Sana was a fighting soldier, who stated what he knew, listened, and took his orders. Giulio Bandinelli was also little better than the lieutenant in an enterprise.  Corte, on the other hand, had the conspirator's head,--a head like a walnut, bulging above the ears,--and the man was of a sallying temper.  He lay there putting bit by bit of his plot before the Chief for his approval, with a careful construction, that upon the expression of any doubt of its working smoothly in the streets of Milan, caused him to shout a defensive, \"But Carlo says yes!\"  This uniform character of Ammiani's replies, and the smile of Agostino on hearing them, had begun to strike the attention of the soldierly Marco Sana.  He ran his hand across his shorn head, and puffed his burnt red mole-spotted cheeks, with a sidelong stare at the abstracted youth, \"Said yes!\" he remarked.  \"He might say no, for a diversion.  He has yeses enough in his pay to earn a Cardinal's hat.  'Is Milan preparing to rise?'  'Yes.'--'Is she ready for the work?'  'Yes.'--'Is the garrison on its guard?'  'Yes.'--'Have you seen Barto Rizzo?'  'Yes.'--'Have the people got the last batch of arms?'  'Yes.'--And 'Yes,' the secret is well kept; 'Yes,' Barto Rizzo is steadily getting them together.  We may rely on him: Carlo is his intimate friend: Yes, Yes:--There's a regiment of them at your service, and you may shuffle them as you will.  This is the help we get from Milan: a specimen of what we may expect!\"  Sana had puffed himself hot, and now blew for coolness.  \"You are,\"--Agostino addressed him,--\"philosophically totally wrong, my Marco.  Those affirmatives are fat worms for the catching of fish.  They are the real pretty fruit of the Hesperides.  Personally, you or I may be irritated by them: but I'm not sure they don't please us.  Were Carlo a woman, of course he should learn to say no;--as he will now if I ask him, Is she in sight?  I won't do it, you know; but as a man and a diplomatist, it strikes me that he can't say yes too often.\"  \"Answer me, Count Ammiani, and do me the favour to attend to these trifles for the space of two minutes,\" said Corte.  \"Have you seen Barto Rizzo?  Is he acting for Medole?\"  \"As mole, as reindeer, and as bloody northern Raven!\" ejaculated Agostino: \"perhaps to be jackal, by-and-by.  But I do not care to abuse our Barto Rizzo, who is a prodigy of nature, and has, luckily for himself, embraced a good cause, for he is certain to be hanged if he is not shot.  He has the prophetic owl's face.  I have always a fancy of his hooting his own death-scrip.  I wrong our Barto:--Medole would be the jackal, if it lay between the two.\"  Carlo Ammiani had corrected Corte's manner to him by a complacent readiness to give him distinct replies.  He then turned and set off at full speed down the mountain.  \"She is sighted at last,\" Agostino murmured, and added rapidly some spirited words under his breath to the Chief, whose chin was resting on his doubled hand.  Corte, Marco, and Giulio were full of denunciations against Milan and the Milanese, who had sent a boy to their councils.  It was Brescia and Bergamo speaking in their jealousy, but Carlo's behaviour was odd, and called for reproof.  He had come as the deputy of Milan to meet the Chief, and he had not spoken a serious word on the great business of the hour, though the plot had been unfolded, the numbers sworn to, and Brescia, and Bergamo, and Cremona, and Venice had spoken upon all points through their emissaries, the two latter cities being represented by Sana and Corte.  \"We've had enough of this lad,\" said Corte.  \"His laundress is following him with a change of linen, I suppose, or it's a scent-bottle.  He's an admirable representative of the Lombard metropolis!\"  Corte drawled out the words in prodigious mimicry.  \"If Milan has nothing better to send than such a fellow, we'll finish without her, and shame the beast that she is.  She has been always a treacherous beast!\"  \"Poor Milan!\" sighed the Chief; \"she lies under the beak of the vulture, and has twice been devoured; but she has a soul: she proves it.  Ammiani, too, will prove his value.  I have no doubt of him.  As to boys, or even girls, you know my faith is in the young.  Through them Italy lives. What power can teach devotion to the old?\"  \"I thank you, signore,\" Agostino gesticulated.  \"But, tell me, when did you learn it, my friend?\"  In answer, Agostino lifted his hand a little boy's height from the earth.  The old man then said: \"I am afraid, my dear Corte, you must accept the fellowship of a girl as well as of a boy upon this occasion."]]]
