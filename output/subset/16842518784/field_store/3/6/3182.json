The young major was but nineteen years of age, and it could hardly be said that he was in love, yet a warm attachment had sprung up between these two people. \"Does your wound trouble you in riding, Artie?\" he went on, to change the subject, and thus prevent his cousin from teasing him in his most susceptible spot.  \"Not enough to count.\" Artie paused to urge his lagging horse ahead. \"I wonder if any of Morgan's desperadoes are in this neighborhood. I understood from what Captain Ripley said that they were trying to overrun the whole State. It's a pity we haven't more of such first-class sharpshooters around as he commands.\"  \"What's the matter with Life Knox's tall boys, Artie? I reckon they can shoot about as well as any of Ripley's men, even though they are not as well drilled. If I know anything about it, Life is a whole host in himself.\"  \"Oh, I agree with you there, Deck.\" There was another pause as the pair of horsemen swung around a heavily wooded bend. \"What a pity father couldn't get a furlough to come home with us. I don't believe he would have been missed, when the main body of the Department of the Cumberland is doing nothing but keeping an eye on Bragg. Mother and the girls would have been delighted to see--Hullo, if there isn't Levi Bedford coming this way--and with half a dozen of the boys! Something is up, sure!\"  As Captain Artie broke off, a tall, heavy-set man, mounted on a coal-black horse, burst into view, riding at a high rate of speed. Behind the man came six stout negroes; and all of the party carried guns, and the white man a pistol in addition.  \"Hi, Levi!\" yelled Major Deck, as soon as the party of seven came within hailing distance.  \"Deck!\" burst out the overseer of Riverlawn. \"And Artie, by all that's fortunate!\"  \"De young mars'rs!\" came from several of the colored men. \"Proud to see yo', Mars'r Dexter, an' Mars'r Artie!\"  At this Deck and Artie smiled on the slaves. Deck shook hands with Levi Bedford, and Artie followed suit. \"Is there any special reason for this meeting being fortunate, Levi?\" questioned the major, anxiously.  \"I think so,\" was the hasty answer. \"Less than two hours ago, and just after I had made the rounds at Riverlawn, to make sure that everything was all right, and no marauders in sight, I received this note.\" And the overseer passed over a small sheet of note-paper, upon which a few lines were written in pencil, in a small hand.       \"DEAR MR. BEDFORD: If you can, come to our assistance at once.      A detachment of three soldiers of Morgan's cavalry has arrived      at Lyndhall. One of the three is to return to his company at      once and bring them here to plunder the estate. I am at home      alone with my sister Kate and three servants. The negro who      delivers this is a stranger to me, but well known to my father.                                \"MARGIE BELTHORPE.\"  \"Kate in danger!\" The words left Deck's lips before he could think to repress them. \"Levi, we must not waste a moment in getting to Lyndhall!\"  \"Just my idea,\" responded the overseer. \"I didn't lose a minute in getting the boys together, after I received that. Some of the boys were out in the back pasture, rounding up two stallions that broke away; but I sent word for them to follow, and I reckon they'll soon be after us, four or five strong.\"  \"Four more will give you eleven men, counting yourself. Artie and I will make thirteen. An unlucky number--for those ruffians, if we get to Lyndhall in time. Forward!\" and Major Deck wheeled his horse, followed by Captain Artie; and away went the entire party at the best speed their animals could command.  The time was the middle of the month of January, 1863, and the Army of the Cumberland, under General Rosecrans, was resting in and around Murfreesboro. The long, stubborn fight at Stone River had exhausted the men, and no new campaign could be undertaken until the wrecked and burned lines of communication were restored, the army reclothed and otherwise put into proper shape, and the necessary steps taken to make Murfreesboro safe as a new base of supplies.  As the readers of the former volumes of this series know, the Riverlawn Cavalry was one of the first to be organized in the State of Kentucky, at the time when the Commonwealth was still undecided as to whether it should remain in the Union or throw its lot in with the Confederacy. The original body of men, forming two companies, had been raised very largely by Noah Lyon, the father of Dexter, who had used them in putting down the lawless uprisings of the Home Guards of the neighborhood--a mob of unprincipled fellows who, under the guise of wishing to defend Kentucky's neutrality during the great conflict, secretly plotted to aid the Confederacy, and later on, when the Commonwealth declared for the Union, promptly joined the ranks of the Secessionists.  From two companies the command had developed to a full regiment of twelve companies, of which Noah Lyon was colonel. Following his father into the war, Dexter had, by hard work and a bravery which sometimes bordered on recklessness, risen from the ranks until he became senior major, while his cousin Artie, of about Deck's age, had well earned the commission of a captain. Both had been wounded more than once, Artie rather seriously, and both were known to care little or nothing for the injuries received in such a righteous cause.  The first duty of the Riverlawns as a regular military body had been to put down the raids of several bands of guerillas operating in counties bordering upon, or near, the Tennessee State line. Successful in these, the command had become a part of the Union army, and as such had taken an active part in the battle of Mill Springs, or Logan's Crossroads, as it is sometimes called. After this had come a series of operations on and around Duck River, and in the entrenchments before Corinth, and then had come the advance of Rosecrans's forces upon Murfreesboro, ending in the bloody battle of Stone River, which, while hardly a victory, caused the shattered forces of the Confederate General Bragg to retreat, and go into winter quarters at Tullahoma.  Although each of the Lyons fought with the warmth and enthusiasm of a true Kentuckian, not one of the members of the several families living at Riverlawn and at Barcreek, a small, nearby town, had been born within the borders of the State. All hailed from New Hampshire, and were Yankee bred as well as born.  The original emigrant to Kentucky had been Duncan Lyon, one of four brothers, who had settled at Riverlawn and made a comfortable fortune in raising hemp, tobacco, and horses. Duncan Lyon had been as good-hearted as he was successful, and under his care Riverlawn had become a model plantation and stock-breeding farm, with Levi Bedford as superintendent or overseer, and with fifty-one slaves, old and young, who thought \"Mars'r Lyon de best gen'men in de hull world.\"  The next member of the family to come West had been Titus Lyon, another of the four brothers. Titus was a mason by trade, and inclined to be shiftless, and when Duncan Lyon wrote that the mason at Barcreek was dead, Titus had very promptly come on with his wife, two sons, and three daughters. It had taken a good deal of help from Duncan to place Titus on his feet, and even then the proprietor of Riverlawn was pained to note that the mason was more inclined to loaf around the village, drinking whiskey and talking politics, than he was to work at his trade.  During the times that Duncan Lyon and Titus were locating in Kentucky, Noah Lyon was attending strictly to his farm in New Hampshire, not a large place, but still one upon which, by economy, he managed to earn a living not only for himself, his wife, and his two children, Dexter and Hope, but also for the two children of his deceased brother Cyrus, Artemas and Dorcas. From the time that Artie and Dorcas came into the family they were looked upon as brother and sister by Deck and Hope, and both always referred to Mr. and Mrs. Noah Lyon as father and mother.  The somewhat unexpected death of Duncan Lyon had proved a shock to all his relatives, but when Lawyer Cosgrove, of Bowling Green, the county seat, came forward to read the plantation owner's will, the second shock, to Titus Lyon, was even greater than the first.  Duncan Lyon had valued his estate at one hundred thousand dollars. Riverlawn was put down as being worth twenty-five thousand dollars, and this magnificent property, including all things in the house and on the grounds and the fifty-one slaves, went to Noah Lyon, who likewise received ten thousand dollars, half cash and half stocks, for having taken care of Artie and Dorcas since they had become orphans. It may here be remarked that Duncan Lyon had been a bachelor, and had never felt capable of raising the children himself. To the children he left one-quarter of his estate, half cash and half stocks, Noah to remain their guardian until of age.  Of the balance of his property he gave to Titus only twenty-five thousand dollars, from which amount was to be deducted a note for five thousand, leaving the mason twenty thousand dollars, half cash and half in stocks. All the stocks to be divided were named in a schedule, so there might be no disputes.  As might be supposed, Titus Lyon was very angry over the provisions of his brother's will, thinking that Riverlawn should have been settled upon himself. When Noah Lyon gave up his home in the East to take charge of Riverlawn, Titus did not call upon him for several days, and for some time after that the unreasonable mason talked about being swindled out of five thousand dollars, he thinking he ought to have had half of the ten thousand given to Noah for supporting Cyrus's children, although he had never lifted a hand to assist the orphans.  With the breaking out of the war Titus had been in his element. Strange as it may seem, he had sided with the South in the struggle, and had"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25440"],["title","An Undivided Union (#2)"],["body","gone so far as to spend a large amount of money in equipping a company of Home Guards, of which he was to be captain. But the arms and ammunition, hidden away in a cavern, had been discovered by Artie and Deck who had turned them over to Noah Lyon, for use, later on, by the Unionists. This confiscation of property had made matters even worse between the two families, and for a long while Titus and his two sons were very bitter. They entered the Confederate service much against the wishes of Titus's wife, and while serving under the stars and bars one of the sons, Orly, was killed and Titus was taken prisoner.  His own capture and the killing of Orly, coupled with the fact that Sandy, the older son, was nearly starved while in the Southern service, produced a profound impression upon Titus Lyon. While a prisoner he gave up drinking and signed the pledge. Then when Sandy suddenly left the Confederate service to enlist on the Union side under his Uncle Noah, he began to study the situation, and he wrote to Noah that he had seen the error of his ways and was now for the Union, once and forever. Later on he was released, and he joined the Riverlawns, to become adjutant of the regiment in which Sandy was now a second lieutenant of the fifth company, second battalion, the battalion being commanded by Major Tom Belthorpe, of Lyndhall and the company by Captain Gadbury, a dashing young soldier, who was far more attentive to Margie Belthorpe than Deck Lyon had ever dared to be to her younger sister.  There had been but one thing concerning Duncan Lyon's will which had excited much curiosity when the document was read and when the lawyer having the matter in hand had had his say. This was concerning the fifty-one negroes installed at Riverlawn. Noah Lyon was requested not to part with any of them. Furthermore, the heir to the plantation was left a sealed letter which was not to be opened until five years later. The Lyons sometimes imagined the contents of the letter concerned the disposition of the slaves, but they had no positive information on the point.     CHAPTER II  AN UNEXPECTED SET-BACK   Deck Lyon was mounted on his famous horse Ceph, so nicknamed after the even more famous charger ridden in ancient days by Alexander the Great. The young major had trained Ceph from ponyhood, and rider and beast understood each other perfectly. On more than one occasion Ceph had performed in a truly wonderful fashion on the battlefield, and once, when being promoted, Deck had declared that the honor of the occasion rested with his equine comrade and not himself.  As the small body of whites and negroes moved onward in the direction of the Belthorpe plantation, Deck took the lead, with Artie and the faithful Levi close behind him. In the rear came the armed slaves riding in two ranks of three men each. The men could hardly be termed soldiers, yet during the time that Noah Lyon had been away from Riverlawn the overseer had drilled them thoroughly, both in horsemanship and in carbine practice, and they were, consequently, a long way removed from raw recruits. Moreover, upon the occasion of the attack upon Riverlawn, they had been under fire and had not flinched, so it was known that they could be depended upon even in a hazardous emergency.  Even without such a fine bit of horseflesh under him, Deck would have been anxious to go to the front. The note received by Levi filled him with alarm, and in his mind all sorts of troublesome thoughts ran riot. The Belthorpe sisters were at home alone, two of Morgan's guerillas were in possession of Lyndhall, and a whole company were soon expected. What indignities might not the sisters suffer, not to say anything of the confiscation and ruin of Mr. Belthorpe's property?  \"This is certainly rough on Kate,\" observed Artie, as he advanced to his cousin's side. \"We ought to have Captain Gadbury with us--for Margie's sake.\"  \"If only those ruffians don't attempt to carry Margie and Kate off,\" half groaned the major, biting the lip upon which a faint mustache was beginning to show. \"I suppose the major would be at Lyndhall, only father didn't think it wise to let so many officers off at one time. Levi, what did the negro who delivered the note have to say?\"  \"Nothing.\"  \"Not a word?\" queried Artie.  \"Absolutely not a word--and for the best reason in the world: he was deaf and dumb,\" and the overseer smiled broadly. \"I tried to question him, but he only shook his head and pointed to his tongue.\"  \"Humph! I didn't know there was a deaf and dumb negro around Lyndhall,\" mused Deck. \"Forward, boys, we mustn't lag!\" he shouted to the ranks in the rear.  \"We's comin', Mars'r, jest as fast as we kin come!\" answered the servant called General, who was the \"high private\" of the occasion. \"Come, don't yo' go fo' to drap behind, Clinker!\" he cried out to the heaviest man of the crowd, the blacksmith and horseshoer at Riverlawn.  \"Ain't drappin' behind,\" growled Clinker. \"I'll git to Lyndhall afore yo' do, yo' don't look out,\" and away he galloped after Deck and the others.  The day was frosty but clear, an ideal one for a ride, and mile after mile was passed, between the now almost barren fields, and through long groves of leafless trees. The horses from Riverlawn had always been boasted of as being the best in that section of the country, and now they were proving their worth.  The mansion home of the Belthorpes stood near the road, with the plantation extending to both sides and to the rear. At a distance up the highway upon which Major Deck and the others were travelling was a grove of walnut trees, and as soon as this grove was reached the young commander of the forces called a halt.  \"We don't want to run into an ambush,\" he explained to Levi and Artie. \"For all we know to the contrary, that whole company of guerillas may be in possession of Lyndhall, and if they have got wind of the fact that word has been sent out for assistance, it may go hard with us, if we are caught napping. I'll go on a scout, and if the coast is clear I'll come back and tell you. If I get into trouble a couple of pistol shots will notify you.\"  To carry out his object, the major dismounted and turned Ceph over to one of the servants. Then, examining his pistol to see that it was in proper condition for use, he struck out boldly, along a path which ran through the walnuts and came up over a lawn fringed by magnolias, to the south of the mansion.  Deck did not slacken his pace until the magnolias were reached. Here, from an opening, he looked toward the house. Not a soul was in sight, and pistol in hand, he crept along the line of trees until he was within fifty feet of a side veranda.  At this moment the door to the veranda opened and a girl stepped out, clad in a house dress, with a cape thrown around her shoulders and a worsted shawl caught over her head in bonnet fashion. Deck did not have to look twice to convince himself that the girl was Kate Belthorpe.  \"Kate!\" he cried, softly and half involuntarily. \"Kate!\"  The girl, hearing his voice, stopped short and stared around her in amazement. Then, as he waved his hand to her, she ran down the steps of the veranda, and reaching him, almost embraced him.  \"Oh, Deck! Why I--I didn't know you were coming here!\" she stammered, with a blush. \"Are you home on a furlough?\"  \"Yes--fortunately, Kate,\" he answered, remembering that they had kissed before, yet hardly daring to do so now--since, to him at least, his intentions were becoming serious. \"I--I trust they haven't harmed you and Margie any? Where are the ruffians? Have the whole company arrived yet?\"  The girl started and stared at him. \"Why, Deck, what are you talking about? I know nothing of any ruffians.\"  The major was nearly dumfounded by this announcement. \"You don't know?\" he queried slowly. \"Then what does this mean? Levi Bedford received it less than three hours ago.\"  It took but a moment for Kate Belthorpe to master the contents of the note. \"I don't know what it means,\" she said. \"I don't believe Margie ever wrote it. Come in, she is in the sitting room, writing a letter to brother Tom.\"  With his mind in a whirl the young major followed Kate into Lyndhall mansion. Margie was found as described, and was equally astonished to see him. The situation was explained, and she glanced at the note.  \"It is a forgery, and is not even in my hand-writing, Deck,\" she said quickly. \"There is some underhanded work here.\"  \"Yes, and I know what it is!\" cried Deck. \"That note was penned with the intention of getting Levi and the negroes away from Riverlawn. My father's place may even now be suffering an attack. I must get home without an instant's delay!\"  \"Oh, I trust you are mistaken, Deck!\" murmured Kate, her beautiful eyes filling with tears. \"What will your mother and your sisters do?\"  \"Heaven alone knows, Kate,\" he answered, his voice growing curiously husky. \"Artie and I were going home when we met Levi and six of the slaves on the road. Four or five other slaves were to follow, so it is safe to say that out of about fifteen men who can use firearms two-thirds are now away from Riverlawn and awaiting me in the walnut grove just below here. Good-by!\" and he held out his hand.  \"Good-by, and take care of yourself!\" burst in Margie, and gave him a warm brotherly kiss. Seeing this, Kate did not hold back, and Deck sped from the mansion with the warm contact of her sweet lips still haunting him.  But now was no time for sentiment, however delightful it might prove, and the young major burst into the grove all out of breath with running.  \"Quick, to Riverlawn!\" he shouted, as he leaped again into the saddle. \"We have not a moment to lose! The note was a decoy, to get Levi and the others to leave our house. Pray Heaven we may reach there before mother and the others are subjected to insult, or before any damage is done!\"  \"A decoy!\" gasped Levi Bedford. He could scarcely believe his ears. \"Then that negro was not dumb, I'll wager!"]]]
