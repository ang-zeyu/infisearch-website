My friend, do not make two foolish strokes instead of one. The lady   must retain possession of the room!!!!!    LAND.   And your honour could suppose that from distrust, from fear of not   being paid, I... As if I did not know that your honour could pay me   as soon as you pleased. The sealed purse... five hundred thalers in   louis d'ors marked on it--which your honour had in your writing-desk   ... is in good keeping.    MAJ. T.   I trust so; as the rest of my property. Just shall take them into his   keeping, when he has paid your bill!!!!!    LAND.   Really, I was quite alarmed when I found the purse. I always   considered your honour a methodical and prudent man, who never got   quite out of money... but still, had I supposed there was ready   money in the desk!!!!!    MAJ. T.   You would have treated me rather more civilly. I understand you. Go,   sir; leave me. I wish to speak with my servant.    LAND.   But, honoured sir!!!!!    MAJ. T.   Come, Just; he does not wish to permit me to give my orders to you in   his house.    LAND.   I am going, honoured sir! My whole house is at your service.   (Exit.)      SCENE IV.   Major Von Tellheim, Just    JUST. (stamping with his foot and spitting after the Landlord).   Ugh!    MAJ. T.   What is the matter?    JUST.   I am choking with rage.    MAJ. T.   That is as bad as from plethora.    JUST.   And for you sir, I hardly know you any longer. May I die before your   eyes, if you do not encourage this malicious, unfeeling wretch. In   spite of gallows, axe, and torture I could... yes, I could have   throttled him with these hands, and torn him to pieces with these   teeth!    MAJ. T.   You wild beast!    JUST.   Better a wild beast than such a man!    MAJ. T.   But what is it that you want?    JUST.   I want you to perceive how much he insults you.    MAJ. T.   And then!!!!!    JUST.   To take your revenge... No, the fellow is beneath your notice!    MAJ. T.   But to commission you to avenge me? That was my intention from the   first. He should not have seen me again, but have received the amount   of his bill from your hands. I know that you can throw down a handful   of money with a tolerably contemptuous mien.    JUST.   Oh! a pretty sort of revenge!    MAJ. T.   Which, however, we must defer. I have not one heller of ready money,   and I know not where to raise any.    JUST.   No money! What is that purse then with five hundred thalers' worth of   louis d'ors, which the Landlord found in your desk?    MAJ. T.   That is money given into my charge.    JUST.   Not the hundred pistoles which your old sergeant brought you four or   five weeks back?    MAJ. T.   The same. Paul Werner's; right.    JUST.   And you have not used them yet? Yet, sir, you may do what you please   with them. I will answer for it that!!!!!    MAJ. T.   Indeed!    JUST.   Werner heard from me, how they had treated your claims upon the War   Office. He heard!!!!!    MAJ. T.   That I should certainly be a beggar soon, if I was not one already. I   am much obliged to you, Just. And the news induced Werner to offer to   share his little all with me. I am very glad that I guessed this.   Listen, Just; let me have your account, directly, too; we must part.    JUST.   How! what!    MAJ. T.   Not a word. There is someone coming.      SCENE V.   Lady _in mourning_, Major von Tellheim, Just    LADY.   I ask your pardon, sir.    MAJ. T.   Whom do you seek, Madam?    LADY.   The worthy gentleman with whom I have the honour of speaking. You do   not know me again. I am the widow of your late captain.    MAJ. T.   Good heavens, Madam, how you are changed!    LADY.   I have just risen from a sick bed, to which grief on the loss of my   husband brought me. I am troubling you at a very early hour, Major von   Tellheim, but I am going into the country, where a kind, but also   unfortunate friend, has for the present offered me an asylum.    MAJ. T. (to Just).   Leave us.      SCENE VI.   Lady, Major von Tellheim    MAJ. T.   Speak freely, Madam! You must not be ashamed of your bad fortune   before me. Can I serve you in any way?    LADY.   Major!!!!!    MAJ. T.   I pity you, Madam! How can I serve you? You know your husband was my   friend; my friend, I say, and I have always been sparing of this   title.    LADY.   Who knows better than I do how worthy you were of his friendship how   worthy he was of yours? You would have been in his last thoughts, your   name would have been the last sound on his dying lips, had not natural   affection, stronger than friendship, demanded this sad prerogative for   his unfortunate son, and his unhappy wife.    MAJ. T.   Cease, Madam! I could willingly weep with you; but I have no tears   to-day. Spare me! You come to me at a time when I might easily be   misled to murmur against Providence. Oh! honest Marloff! Quick, Madam,   what have you to request? If it is in my power to assist you, if it is   in my power!!!!!    LADY.   I cannot depart without fulfilling his last wishes. He recollected,   shortly before his death, that he was dying a debtor to you, and he   conjured me to discharge his debt with the first ready money I should   have. I have sold his carriage, and come to redeem his note.    MAJ. T.   What, Madam! Is that your object in coming?    LADY.   It is. Permit me to count out the money to you.    MAJ. T.   No, Madam. Marloff a debtor to me! that can hardly be. Let us look,   however.   (Takes out a pocketbook, and searches.)   I find nothing of the kind.    LADY.   You have doubtless mislaid his note; besides, it is nothing to the   purpose. Permit me!!!!!    MAJ. T.   No, Madam; I am careful not to mislay such documents. If I have not   got it, it is a proof that I never had it, or that it has been   honoured and already returned by me.    LADY.   Major!    MAJ. T.   Without doubt, Madam; Marloff does not owe me anything--nor can I   remember that he ever did owe me anything. This is so, Madam. He has   much rather left me in his debt. I have never been able to do anything   to repay a man who shared with me good and ill luck, honour and   danger, for six years. I shall not forget that he has left a son. He   shall be my son, as soon as I can be a father to him. The   embarrassment in which I am at present!!!!!    LADY.   Generous man! But do not think so meanly of me. Take the money, Major,   and then at least I shall be at ease.    MAJ. T.   What more do you require to tranquillize you, than my assurance that   the money does not belong to me? Or do you wish that I should rob the   young orphan of my friend? Rob, Madam; for that it would be in the   true meaning of the word. The money belongs to him; invest it for him.    LADY.   I understand you; pardon me if I do not yet rightly know how to accept   a kindness. Where have you learnt that a mother will do more for her   child than for the preservation of her own life? I am going!!!!!    MAJ. T.   Go, Madam, and may you have a prosperous journey! I do not ask you to   let me hear from you. Your news might come to me when it might be of   little use to me. There is yet one thing, Madam; I had nearly   forgotten that which is of most consequence. Marloff also had claims   upon the chest of our old regiment. His claims are as good as mine. If   my demands are paid, his must be paid also. I will be answerable for   them.    LADY.   Oh! Sir... but what can I say? Thus to purpose future good deeds   is, in the eyes of heaven, to have performed them already. May you   receive its reward, as well as my tears.   (Exit.)      SCENE VII.   Major von Tellheim    MAJ. T.   Poor, good woman! I must not forget to destroy the bill.   (Takes some papers from his pocketbook and destroys them.)   Who would guarantee that my own wants might not some day tempt me to   make use of it?      SCENE VIII.   Just, Major von Tellheim    MAJ. T.   Is that you, Just?    JUST. (wiping his eyes).   Yes.    MAJ. T.   You have been crying?    JUST.   I have been writing out my account in the kitchen, and the place is   full of smoke. Here it is, sir.    MAJ. T.   Give it to me.    JUST.   Be merciful with me, sir. I know well that they have not been so with   you; still!!!!!    MAJ. T.   What do you want?    JUST.   I should sooner have expected my death, than my discharge.    MAJ. T.   I cannot keep you any longer: I must learn to manage without servants.   (Opens the paper, and reads.)   \"What my master, the Major, owes me:--Three months and a half wages,   six thalers per month, is 21 thalers. During the first part of this   month, laid out in sundries--1 thaler 7 groschen 9 pfennigs. Total, 22   thalers 7gr. 9pf.\" Right; and it is just that I also pay your wages,   for the whole of the current month.    JUST.   Turn over, sir.    MAJ. T.   Oh! more?   (Reads.)   \"What I owe my master, the Major:--Paid for me to the army-surgeon   twenty-five thalers. Attendance and nurse during my cure, paid for me,   thirty-nine thalers. Advanced, at my request, to my father--who was   burnt out of his house and robbed--without reckoning the two horses of   which he made him a present, fifty thalers. Total 114 thalers. Deduct   the above 22 thalers, 7gr. 9pf.; I remain in debt to my master, the   Major, 91 thalers, 16gr. 3pf.\" You are mad, my good fellow!    JUST.   I willingly grant that I owe you much more; but it would be wasting   ink to write it down. I cannot pay you that: and if you take my livery   from me too, which, by the way, I have not yet earned,--I would rather   you had let me die in the workhouse.    MAJ. T.   For what do you take me? You owe me nothing; and I will recommend you   to one of my friends, with whom you will fare better than with me.    JUST.   I do not owe you anything, and yet you turn me away!    MAJ. T.   Because I do not wish to owe you anything.    JUST.   On that account? Only on that account? As certain as I am in your   debt, as "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2663"],["title","Minna Von Barnhelm (#2)"],["body","as you can never be in mine, so certainly shall you   not turn me away now. Do what you will, Major, I remain in your   service; I must remain.    MAJ. T.   With your obstinacy, your insolence, your savage boisterous temper   towards all who you think have no business to speak to you, your   malicious pranks, your love of revenge,!!!!!    JUST.   Make me as bad as you will, I shall not think worse of myself than of   my dog. Last winter I was walking one evening at dusk along the river,   when I heard something whine. I stooped down, and reached in the   direction whence the sound came, and when I thought I was saving a   child, I pulled a dog out of the water. That is well, thought I. The   dog followed me; but I am not fond of dogs, so I drove him away--in   vain. I whipped him away--in vain. I shut him out of my room at night;   he lay down before the door. If he came too near me, I kicked him; he   yelped, looked up at me, and wagged his tail. I have never yet given   him a bit of bread with my own hand; and yet I am the only person whom   he will obey, or who dare touch him. He jumps about me, and shows off   his tricks to me, without my asking for them. He is an ugly dog, but   he is a good animal. If he carries it on much longer, I shall at last   give over hating him.    MAJ. T. (aside).   As I do him. No, there is no one perfectly inhuman. Just, we will not   part.    JUST.   Certainly not! And you wanted to manage without servants! You forget   your wounds, and that you only have the use of one arm. Why, you are   not able to dress alone. I am indispensable to you; and I am--without   boasting, Major,--I am a servant who, if the worst comes to the worst,   can beg and steal for his master.    MAJ. T.   Just, we will part.    JUST.   All right, Sir!      SCENE IX.   Servant, Major von Tellheim, Just    SER.   I say, comrade!    JUST.   What is the matter?    SER.   Can you direct me to the officer who lodged yesterday in that room?   (Pointing to the one out of which he is coming).    JUST.   That I could easily do. What have you got for him?    SER.   What we always have, when we have nothing--compliments. My mistress   hears that he has been turned out on her account. My mistress knows   good manners, and I am therefore to beg his pardon.    JUST.   Well then, beg his pardon; there he stands.    SER.   What is he? What is his name?    MAJ. T.   I have already heard your message, my friend. It is unnecessary   politeness on the part of your mistress, which I beg to acknowledge   duly. Present my compliments to her. What is the name of your   mistress?    SER.   Her name! We call her my Lady.    MAJ. T.   The name of her family?    SER.   I have not heard that yet, and it is not my business to ask. I manage   so that I generally get a new master every six weeks. Hang all their   names!    JUST.   Bravo, comrade!    SER.   I was engaged by my present mistress a few days ago, in Dresden. I   believe she has come here to look for her lover.    MAJ. T.   Enough, friend. I wished to know the name of your mistress, not her   secrets. Go!    SER.   Comrade, he would not do for my master.      SCENE X.   Major von Tellheim, Just    MAJ. T.   Just! see that we get out of this house directly! The politeness of   this strange lady affects me more than the churlishness of the host.   Here, take this ring--the only thing of value which I have left--of   which I never thought such a use. Pawn it! get eighty louis d'ors for   it: our host's bill can scarcely amount to thirty. Pay him, and remove   my things.... Ah, where? Where you will. The cheaper the inn, the   better. You will find me in the neighbouring coffee-house. I am going;   you will see to it all properly?    JUST.   Have no fear, Major!    MAJ. T. (comes back).   Above all things, do not let my pistols be forgotten, which hang   beside the bed.    JUST.   I will forget nothing.    MAJ. T. (comes back again).   Another thing: bring your dog with you too. Do you hear, Just?      SCENE XI.   Just    JUST.   The dog will not stay behind, he will take care of that. Hem! My   master still had this valuable ring and carried it in his pocket   instead of on his finger! My good landlord, we are not yet so poor as   we look. To him himself, I will pawn you, you beautiful little ring! I   know he will be annoyed that you will not all be consumed in his   house. Ah!      SCENE XII.   Paul Werner, Just    JUST.   Hullo, Werner! good-day to you, Werner. Welcome to the town.    WER.   The accursed village! I can't manage to get at home in it again.   Merry, my boys, merry; I have got some more money! Where is the Major?    JUST.   He must have met you; he just went down stairs.    WER.   I came up the back stairs. How is he? I should have been with you last   week, but!!!!!    JUST.   Well, what prevented you?    WER.   Just, did you ever hear of Prince Heraclius?    JUST.   Heraclius? Not that I know of.    WER.   Don't you know the great hero of the East?    JUST.   I know the wise men of the East well enough, who go about with the   stars on New Year's Eve.    WER.    Brother, I believe you read the newspapers as little as the Bible. You   do not know Prince Heraclius. Not know the brave man who seized   Persia, and will break into the Ottoman Porte in a few days? Thank   God, there is still war somewhere in the world! I have long enough   hoped it would break out here again. But there they sit and take care   of their skins. No, a soldier I was, and a soldier I must be again! In   short, (looking round carefully, to see if anyone is listening)   between ourselves, Just, I am going to Persia, to have a few campaigns   against the Turks, under his Royal Highness Prince Heraclius.    JUST.   You?    WER.   I myself. Our ancestors fought bravely against the Turks; and so ought   we too, if we would be honest men and good Christians. I allow that a   campaign against the Turks cannot be half so pleasant as one against   the French; but then it must be so much the more beneficial in this   world and the next. The swords of the Turks are all set with diamonds.    JUST.   I would not walk a mile to have my head split with one of their   sabres. You will not be so mad as to leave your comfortable little   farm!    WER.   Oh! I take that with me. Do you see? The property is sold.    JUST.   Sold?    WER.   Hist! Here are a hundred ducats, which I received yesterday towards   the payment: I am bringing them for the Major.    JUST.   What is he to do with them?    WER.   What is he to do with them? Spend them; play them, or drink them away,   or whatever he pleases. He must have money, and it is bad enough that   they have made his own so troublesome to him. But I know what I would   do, were I in his place. I would say--\"The deuce take you all here; I   will go with Paul Werner to Persia!\" Hang it! Prince Heraclius must   have heard of Major von Tellheim, if he has not heard of Paul Werner,   his late sergeant. Our affair at Katzenhauser!!!!!    JUST.   Shall I give you an account of that?    WER.   You give me! I know well that a fine battle array is beyond your   comprehension. I am not going to throw my pearls before swine. Here,   take the hundred ducats; give them to the Major: tell him, he may keep   these for me too. I am going to the market now. I have sent in a   couple of loads of rye; what I get for them he can also have.    JUST.   Werner, you mean it well; but we don't want your money. Keep your   ducats; and your hundred pistoles you can also have back safe, as soon   as you please.    WER.   What, has the Major money still?    JUST.   No.    WER.   Has he borrowed any?    JUST.   No.    WER.   On what does he live, then?    JUST.   We have everything put down in the bill; and when they won't put   anything more down, and turn us out of the house, we pledge anything   we may happen to have, and go somewhere else. I say, Paul, we must   play this landlord here a trick.    WER.   If he has annoyed the Major, I am ready.    JUST.   What if we watch for him in the evening, when he comes from his club,   and give him a good thrashing?    WER.   In the dark! Watch for him! Two to one! No, that won't do.    JUST.   Or if we burn his house over his head?    WER.   Fire and burn! Why, Just, one hears that you have been baggage-boy and   not soldier. Shame!    JUST.   Or if we ruin his daughter? But she is cursedly ugly.    WER.   She has probably been ruined long ago. At any rate you don't want any   help there. But what is the matter with you? What has happened?    JUST.   Just come with me, and you shall hear something to make you stare.    WER.   The devil must be loose here, then?    JUST.   Just so; come along.    WER.   So much the better! To Persia, then; to Persia.     ACT II.     SCENE I.   Minna's Room. Minna, Franziska    MIN. (in morning dress, looking at her watch).   Franziska, we have risen very early. The time will hang heavy on our   hands.    FRAN.   Who can sleep in these abominable large towns? The carriages, the   watchmen, the drums, the cats, the soldiers, never cease to rattle, to   call, to roll, to mew, and to swear; just as if the last thing the   night is intended for was for sleep. Have a cup of tea, my lady!    MIN.   I don't care for tea.    FRAN.   I will have some chocolate made.    MIN.   For yourself, if you like.    FRAN.   For myself! I would as soon talk to myself as drink by myself. Then   the time will indeed hang heavy. For very weariness we shall have to   make our toilets, and try on the dress in which we intend to make the   first attack!    MIN.   Why do you talk of attacks, when I have only come to require that the   capitulation be ratified?    FRAN.   But the officer whom we have dislodged, and to whom we have   apologized, cannot be the best bred man in the world, or he might at   least have begged the honour of being allowed to wait upon you.
