[Footnote 3: Reference is supposed to be made to this in the Book of Job, in these words: \"When the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy.\"]  First let us go forth into the summer woods. The eye takes in the charming prospect,--the trees dressed in beautiful green; the \"grassy carpet,\" parted ever and anon by a gliding, gurgling brooklet; the wild flower peeping up near the feet; a landscape of even surface, or at times pleasingly undulated. The atmosphere is freighted with a delightful fragrance; and from rustling bough, from warbling bird, from rippling brook, and from the joyous hum of insects almost innumerable,       \"The air is full of noises, sounds, and sweet airs,      That give delight, and hurt not.\"  All these, the beauties of animate and inanimate Nature, pleasantly affect the senses. But the chief influence there--the crowning glory of the groves--is the songs, the charming music of the birds, as they warble from tree to tree, untrammelled by the forms of art, their sweetest melodies. How often do their lightsome, inspiriting carollings ring out upon the morning air, persuasively calling us from our couches to listen in delight to Nature's minstrelsy! \"After man,\" says a writer, \"the birds occupy the highest rank in Nature's concerts. They make the woods, the gardens, and the fields resound with their merry warbles. Their warbled 'shake' has never been equalled by human gifts of voice, nor by art.\"  Indeed, it has been found that many of the songs of birds are sung in certain of the keys; while a learned musical writer has produced a book in which are printed many samples of the music often sung by birds. In very recent times it is stated, too, that birds have been taught to sing some of the popular tunes of the day; this being accomplished by placing a bird in a room for a while, allowing it to hear no other bird, and only the tune to be learned. Professor Brown of Aiken, S.C., has mocking-birds which he has taught to sing such songs as \"The Star-spangled Banner\" and \"Yankee Doodle.\" These birds were to be taken to the Centennial Exhibition, to there exhibit their marvellous skill.  A writer in \"The Monthly Reader\" thus speaks of that pretty singer the bullfinch:--       \"I heard a lady cry out to a little bird in a cage, 'Come,      Bully, Bully, sweet little Bully Bullfinch, please give us      just one more tune.'       \"And then, to my surprise, the little bird whistled the tune      of 'Yankee Doodle' as well as I could have done it myself.       \"The lady then told me about the bird. It was a bullfinch.      She had bought it in the little town of Fulda, in Germany,      where there are schools for teaching these birds to sing.       \"When a bullfinch has learned to sing two or three tunes, he      is worth from forty to sixty dollars; for he will bring that      price in London or Boston or New York.       \"To teach them, the birds are put in classes of about six      each, and kept for a time in a dark room. Here, when their      food is given them, they are made to hear music. And so,      when they have had their food, or when they want more food,      they will sing, and try to sing a tune like that they have      just heard; for perhaps they think it has something to do      with what they eat.\"  But as, in presenting these examples of the musical teachableness of the \"feathered songsters,\" I am entering the domain of music as an art, I will not further digress. Certain it is, too, that these delightful musicians of Nature do not require the aid of the skill of man; nor is it desirable, for the sake of musical effect at least, that their own wild, free, and glad-hearted warblings should be changed. They are better as they are, affording as they do a pleasing contrast, and adding freshness and variety to the many other forms of music. Some one, dwelling upon the charming beauty of bird-music, has expressed in words of very excusable rapture the following unique wish:--       \"Oh! had I but the power        To set the proper words      To all your glorious melodies,        My sweet-voiced birds,       When words and dainty music        Would each to each belong,      Together we might give the world        A _perfect_ song.\"  But I need not refer at greater length to these sweet harmonists of Nature, since scarce an ear is so dull, and few hearts are so cold, as not to be charmed and cheered by their unceasing, joyous melodies.  It might well be thought that flowers, those \"fairy ministers of grace,\" with their delicately tinted, variegated, perfect hues, that emit, in their sweet, delicious perfumes, what may be called the \"breath of heaven,\" possess in these delightful qualities full enough to instruct and charm mankind. But there is a flower, it seems, that, inviting the aid of the evening zephyr, adds sweet music to its other fascinating beauties. Let the poet Twombly sing of the music-giving--       BLUE HAREBELL.       Have ye ever heard in the twilight dim            A low, soft strain      That ye fancied a distant vesper-hymn,            Borne o'er the plain      By the zephyrs that rise on perfumed wing,      When the sun's last glances are glimmering?       Have ye heard that music, with cadence sweet            And merry peal,      Ring out like the echoes of fairy feet            O'er flowers that steal?       The source of that whispering strain I'll tell;            For I have listened oft      To the music faint of the blue harebell            In the gloaming soft:      'Tis the gay fairy-folk the peal who ring,      At even-time, for their banqueting.       And gayly the trembling bells peal out            With gentle tongue;      While elves and fairies career about            'Mid dance and song.  It would be tedious to enumerate and dwell upon all the very numerous music-making agencies of the natural world; and I shall therefore allude only to a few of those not already mentioned.  Many have heard the sounds of waterfalls, and know that from them issues a kind of majestic music, which, to be appreciated, must be heard. Musicians of finely-cultivated ears have studied the tones of waterfalls; and two of them, Messrs. A. and E. Heim, say that a mass of falling water gives       \"The chord of C sharp, and also the non-accordant F. When C      and D sound louder than the middle note, F is heard very      fully, as a deep, dull, humming, far-resounding tone, with      a strength proportionate to the mass of the falling water.      It easily penetrates to a distance at which the other notes      are inaudible. The notes C, E, G, F, belong to all rushing      water, and in great falls are sometimes in different      octaves. Small falls give the same notes one or two octaves      higher. In the stronger falls, F is heard the most easily;      in the weak ones, C. At the first attempt, C is most readily      detected. Persons with musical cultivation, on attempting to      sing near rapidly-moving water, naturally use the key of C      sharp, or of F sharp if near a great fall.\"  Somewhat similar to waterfalls in the character of the tunes they produce (being distinguished, however, generally, by a greater softness and more gentle flow) are the waves, that, handsome in form, roll majestically shoreward, greeting the ear with a strange, dirge-like, yet, as it seems to the writer, pleasing harmony.  Here is given a duet between the waves and zephyrs:--       \"We sit beneath the dreaming moon,        And gaze upon the sea:      Our hearts with Nature are in tune;        List to her minstrelsy.      The waves chant low and soft their song,        And kiss the rocks in glee;      While zephyrs their sweet lay prolong,--        Their love-song to the sea.\"  There is a pretty, delicate music made by the rippling, gurgling brooklet, as its transparent waters glide over its pebbly bottom. And there's the musical sea-shell. Place it to the ear, and you shall catch, as if in the far distance, the reverberating roll of the billowy ocean as it sings a mighty song. To this the poet Wordsworth very gracefully refers in the following lines:--                             \"I have seen      A curious child, who dwelt upon a tract      Of inland ground, applying to his ear      The convolutions of a smooth-lipped shell:      To which, in silence hushed, his very soul      Listened intensely, and his countenance soon      Brightened with joy; for from within were heard      Murmurings whereby the monitor expressed      Mysterious union with its native sea.\"  And an anonymous writer (it does not seem that he had good cause for hiding his name) thus discourses on the music of the sea:--       \"The gray, unresting sea,        Adown the bright and belting shore      Breaking in untold melody,        Makes music evermore.       Centuries of vanished time,        Since this glad earth's primeval morn,      Have heard the grand, unpausing chime,        Momently new born.       Like as in cloistered piles        Rich bursts of massive sounds upswell,      Ringing along dim-lighted aisles        With spirit-trancing spell;       So on the surf-white strand        Chants of deep peal the sea-waves raise,      Like voices from a viewless land        Hymning a hymn of praise.       By times, in thunder-notes,        The booming billows shoreward surge;      By times a silver laugh it floats;        By times a low, soft dirge.       Souls more ennobled grow        Listing the worldly anthem rise;      Discords are drowned in the great flow        Of Nature's harmonies.       Men change and 'cease to be,'        And empires rise and grow and fall;      But the weird music of the sea        Lives, and outlives them all.       The mystic song shall last        Till time itself no more shall be;      Till seas and shores have passed,        Lost in eternity.\"  But the wind is one of Nature's chief musicians.
