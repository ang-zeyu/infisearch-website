Rapidly, the judge silenced the jurors, declared Donnely to be free, and then publicly apologized for ever daring to doubt Mr. Donnely.  The State's Attorney was equally verbose in his apology; he was almost in tears because of his \"deep contrition at having cast aspersions on the spotless character of so great a man.\"  Donnely was released.  The next evening, \"Blackjack\" Donnely was shot down at the front door of his own home. There were fifteen bullets in his body; three from a .32, five from a .38, and seven from a .45.  The police investigation was far from thorough; any evidence that may have turned up somehow got lost. It was labelled as \"homicide committed by person or persons unknown,\" and it stayed that way.         *       *       *       *       *  Donnely was only the first. In the next two years, four more showed up. Everyone of them, in one way or another, had attempted to gain power or money by mental projection. Everyone of them was a twisted megalomaniac.  Houston looked again at Harris's picture on the front page of the _Times_. Here was one Controller who neither looked nor acted like a megalomaniac. That wouldn't make much difference to the PD Police; as far as the officials were concerned, the ability to project telepathically and the taint of delusions of grandeur went hand in hand. Controllers were power-mad and criminal by definition.  Fear still ruled the emotional reactions against Controllers, in spite of the protection of the Psychodeviant Police.  But David Houston knew damned good and well that all telepaths were not necessarily insane.  He should know. He was a Controller, himself.         *       *       *       *       *  _Brrrring!_  David Houston tossed the paper on the bed and walked over to the phone. He cut in the circuit, and waited for the phone's TV screen to show the face of his caller. But the screen remained blank.  \"Who is it?\" Houston asked.  \"Is this CHAring Cross 7-8161?\" It was a woman's voice, soft and well-modulated.  \"No, this is CHElsea 7-8161,\" Houston said. \"You must have dialed C-H-E instead of C-H-A.\"  \"Oh. I'm very sorry. Excuse me.\" There was a click, and she hung up.  Houston walked back over to the bed and picked up his paper. He looked at it, but he didn't read it. It no longer interested him.  So Dorrine was finally in London, eh? He'd recognized her voice instantly; even years of training couldn't smother the midwestern American of Chicago completely beneath the precise British of the well-educated English girl.  The signal had been agreed upon, just in case his phone was tapped. Even the Psychodeviant Police could be suspected of harboring a Controller--although Houston didn't think it too likely. Nevertheless, he wasn't one to take too many chances.  He glanced at his watch. He had an hour yet. He'd wait five minutes before he phoned headquarters.         *       *       *       *       *  He sat down in his chair again and forced himself to relax, smoke a cigarette, and read the paper--the sports section. Perusing the records of the season's cricket matches kept his mind off that picture on the front page. At least, he hoped they would. Let's see, now--Benton was being rated as the finest googly bowler on the Staffordshire Club ...  Everything went fine until he came across a reference to a John Harris, a top-flight batsman for Hambledon; that reminded him of Robert Harris. Houston threw down the paper in disgust and walked over to the phone.  The number was TROwbridge 5-4321, but no one ever bothered to remember it. Simply dial 8-7-6-5-4-3-2-1, and every time a voice at the other end would answer--  \"Hamilton speaking.\"  \"Houston here; will I be needed in the next hour or so?\"  \"Mmmm. Just a second; I'll check the roster. No; your evidence won't be needed personally. You've filed an affidavit. No, I don't think--wait a minute! Yes, there's a return here for you; reservation on the six A.M. jet to New York. Your job here is done, Houston, so you can take the rest of the evening off and relax. Going anywhere in particular?\"  \"I thought I'd get a bite to eat and take in a movie, maybe, but if I'm due out at six, I'll forego the cinematic diversion. When's the trial?\"  \"It's scheduled for eleven-thirty this evening. Going to come?\"  Houston shook his head. \"Not if I'm not needed to give evidence. Those Controllers always give me the creeps.\"  \"They do everybody,\" said Hamilton. \"Well, you caught him; there's no need for you to stick around for the windup. Have a good time.\"  \"Thanks,\" said Houston shortly, and hung up.  _The windup_, Houston thought. _Sure. That's all it will be. A Controller's trial is a farce. Knock him out with a stun gun and then pump him full of comatol. How can he defend himself if he's unconscious all through the trial?_  Houston knew what the average man's answer to that would be: \"If a Controller were allowed to remain conscious, he'd take over the judge's mind and get himself freed.\"  Houston said an obscene word under his breath, jammed his hat on his head, put on his coat, and left his apartment.         *       *       *       *       *  With the coming of darkness, the heavy fog had become still denser. The yellow beams of the sodium vapor lamps were simply golden spots hanging in an all-enveloping blackness. Walking the street was a process of moving from one little golden island of light to another, crossing seas of blankness between. The monochromatic yellow shone on the human faces that passed beneath the lamps, robbing them of all color, giving them a dead, grayish appearance beneath the yellow itself.  David Houston walked purposefully along the pavement, his hand jammed deep in his overcoat pockets. One hand held the control box for the little earpiece he wore. He kept moving the band selector, listening for any sign that the Psychodeviant Police were suspicious of a Controller in their midst.  If they were following him, of course, they would use a different scrambler circuit than the one which was plugged into his own unit, but he would be able to hear the gabble of voices, even if he couldn't understand what they were saying.  So far, there hadn't been a sound; if he was being followed, his tailers weren't using the personal intercom units.  He didn't try to elude anyone who might be following. That, in itself, would be a giveaway. Let them watch, if they _were_ watching. They wouldn't see anything but a man going to get himself a bit of dinner.  The _Charles II Inn_, on Regent Street, near Piccadilly Circus, was a haven of brightness in an otherwise Stygian London. It was one of those \"old-fashioned\" places--Restoration style of decoration, carried out in modern plastics. The oak panelling looked authentic enough, but it was just a little too glossy to be real.  Houston pushed open the door, stepped inside, removed his hat and coat and shook the dampness from them. As he handed them to the checker, he looked casually around. Dorrine was nowhere in sight, but he hadn't expected her to be. There would be no point in their meeting physically; it might even be downright dangerous.  The headwaiter, clad in the long waistcoat and full trunk-hose of the late Seventeenth Century, bowed punctiliously.  \"You're alone, sir?\"  \"Alone, yes,\" Houston said. \"I'll just be wanting a light supper and a drink or two.\"  \"This way, sir.\"  Houston followed the man to a small table in the rear of the huge dining room. It was set for two, but the other place was quickly cleared away. Houston ordered an Irish-and-soda from a waiter who was only slightly less elaborately dressed than the headwaiter, and then settled himself down to wait. If he knew Dorrine, she would be on time to the minute.  She came while the waiter was setting the drink on Houston's table. She stepped in through the door, her unmistakable hair glowing a rich red in the illumination of the pseudo-candlelight.  She didn't bother to look around; she knew he would be there.  After a single glance, Houston averted his eyes from her and looked back at his drink.  And in that same instant, their minds touched.  _Dave, darling! I knew you'd be early!_  _Dorrine!_  And then their minds meshed for an instant.  _I_--_(we)_--_you_--LOVE--_you_--(each other)--me!--us!         *       *       *       *       *  Houston looked complacently at his drink while the headwaiter led Dorrine to a table on the far side of the room. She sat down gracefully, smiled at the waiter, and ordered a cocktail. Then she took a magazine from her handbag and began--presumably--to read.  Her thought came: _Who is this Richard Harris? He's not one of our Group._  Houston sipped at his drink. _No. An unknown, like the others. I wonder if he's even a telepath._  _What?_ Her thought carried astonishment. _Why, Dave--he'd_ have _to be! How else could he have controlled this Sir Lewis--whatsisname--Huntley?_  _Well--I've got a funny idea_, Houston replied. _Look at it this way: So far as we know, there are two Groups of telepaths. There's our own Group. All we want is to be left alone. We don't read a Normal's mind unless we have to, and we don't try to control one unless our lives are threatened. We stay under cover, out of everyone's way._  _Then there are the megalomaniacs. They try, presumably, to gain wealth and power by controlling Normals. And they get caught with monotonous regularity. Right?_  The girl caught an odd note in that thought. _What do you mean, \"monotonous regularity\"?_ she asked.  _I mean_, Houston thought savagely, _why is it they're all so bloody stupid? Look at this Harris guy; he is supposed to have taken over Sir Lewis's mind in order to get a thousand pounds. So what did he have Sir Lewis do? Parade all around the city to pick up a PD Police net, and then give his address to a cabman in a loud voice and lead the whole net right to Harris! How stupid can a man get?_  _It does look pretty silly_,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25063"],["title","The Beggar's Opera; to Which is Prefixed the Musick to Each Song (#1)"],["body","prune and select the required amount of data. Here was Hogarth and his actual scene of Newgate with Macheath in chains; here was Laroon's _Cries of London_ falling, in its edition of 1733, pat into the period; here was the National Portrait Gallery and, added to these, here was the benefit of all Mr. Charles E. Pearce's research.[1] After a month or two of work in designing, the ease became so marked and apparent that it engendered in me the beginnings of mistrust. Still, I persevered in scene and costume with historically accurate reproduction and, until three weeks before the actual work was due to be carried out at the costumier's and in the painting shops, I felt comparatively cheerful. Then I reviewed my forces--the little scale models of the scenes, the characters in painted cardboard--all exact and accurate. Something was wrong and the result was, I confess, appalling. I had not made allowances either for my theatre or for my audience. I had forgotten that it required a spacious Georgian theatre, the intimacy of the side-boxes, the great personages sitting on the stage. The Duke of Bolton, Major Pauncefoot and Sir Robert Fagg were not in their places as in Hogarth's painting; the pit would not be filled with tye-wigs and hoops and there would be a sharper line of division between the actors and the spectators than ever existed in 1728. Something else had to be done. As reproduction was a failure one would try to give an impression of the same thing. Impressionism proved even worse than accuracy. It was neither one thing nor the other. It merged into \"making a picture of it\"--a crime that is without parallel in the staging of a play. To make a pretty picture at the expense of drama is merely to pander to the voracity of the costumier and scene-painter.      [Footnote 1: _Polly Peachum and The Beggar's Opera_, by     Charles E. Pearce. Messrs. Stanley Paul & Company, 1913.]  What was then to be done? Added to all these objections was the important fact that I had designed scenes that would have seriously hampered the resources at Hammersmith. The theatre would have required more space for storage than could possibly have been given and, in addition, an army of stage hands would be wanted for whom there was not in this little theatre the accommodation.  The solution was, of course, to forget one's past work, to scrap the models, and to start feverishly afresh. The only method left untried was the symbolic. That is to say, to hint at the eighteenth century and to suggest that through the doors on the stage existed the London of 1728. The scene demanded to be simple and one which, with slight modifications in doors and windows, remained before the audience for the whole action of the play. It was, therefore, to be a scene of which people did not easily tire and that remained interesting, unobtrusive and formally neat. To find such a scene it is necessary to refer back to days when the Comic and the Tragic scenes were architectural and permanent. This I did and, taking Palladio's magnificent scene at Vicenza, by a shameless process of _reductio ad absurdum_, evolved the scene that is now in use at Hammersmith. Palladio and Gay have much to forgive.  So far the scene, but it called for a corresponding treatment in the dresses. In _The Beggar's Opera_ no one is in the height of fashion. Macheath and certain Ladies of the Town alone \"keep Company with Lords and Gentlemen,\" and even then there must have been apparent a distinction. Macheath is unaltered. Here it was essential to keep to tradition. Macheath in a blue coat is unthinkable. The rest of the characters are frankly in the neighbourhood of Newgate. The clothes of Peachum and Lockit would be as equally unfashionable and just as possible thirty years before as thirty years after 1728, whilst the footpads are clad in whatever Georgian rags that happened to come their way. With the women I have taken greater licence. I have kept faithfully to the outlines of the age, the close-fitting bodice, the flat hoops, the square-toed shoes, but I have taken considerable liberties in the manner in which I have shorn them of ribbons and laces and--for the sake of dramatic simplicity, be it remembered--I have eliminated yards of trimming.  Just so much explanation is, I consider, due to the public, but whether I have been justified by results or whether, under the sacred mask of Drama, I have erred unpardonably, are points which, so long as this revival draws attention to a forgotten masterpiece, can be of no very great importance.

If Poverty be a Title to Poetry, I am sure no-body can dispute mine. I own myself of the Company of Beggars; and I make one at their Weekly Festivals at _St. Giles's_. I have a small Yearly Salary for my Catches, and am welcome to a Dinner there whenever I please, which is more than most Poets can say.  _Player._ As we live by the Muses, it is but Gratitude in us to encourage Poetical Merit wherever we find it. The Muses, contrary to all other Ladies, pay no Distinction to Dress, and never partially mistake the Pertness of Embroidery for Wit, nor the Modesty of Want for Dulness. Be the Author who he will, we push his Play as far as it will go. So (though you are in Want) I wish you success heartily.  _Beggar._ This piece I own was originally writ for the celebrating the Marriage of _James Chaunter_ and _Moll Lay_, two most excellent Ballad-Singers. I have introduced the Similes that are in all your celebrated _Operas_: The _Swallow_, the _Moth_, the _Bee_, the _Ship_, the _Flower_, &c. Besides, I have a Prison-Scene, which the Ladies always reckon charmingly pathetic. As to the Parts, I have observed such a nice Impartiality to our two Ladies, that it is impossible for either of them to take Offence. I hope I may be forgiven, that I have not made my Opera throughout unnatural, like those in vogue; for I have no Recitative; excepting this, as I have consented to have neither Prologue nor Epilogue, it must be allowed an Opera in all its Forms. The Piece indeed hath been heretofore frequently represented by ourselves in our Great Room at _St. Giles's_, so that I cannot too often acknowledge your Charity in bringing it now on the Stage.  _Player._ But I see it is time for us to withdraw; the Actors are preparing to begin. Play away the Overture.      [Exeunt.   OVERTURE  [Illustration]     [Illustration]   ACT I. SCENE I.  _SCENE, _Peachum's_ House._    _Peachum_ sitting at a Table with a large Book of Accounts before him.   AIR I. An old Woman clothed in Gray, &c.  [Music]    Through all the Employments of Life     Each Neighbour abuses his Brother;   Whore and Rogue they call Husband and Wife:     All Professions be-rogue one another:   The Priest calls the Lawyer a Cheat,     The Lawyer be-knaves the Divine:   And the Statesman, because he's so great,     Thinks his Trade as honest as mine.  A Lawyer is an honest Employment, so is mine. Like me too he acts in a double Capacity, both against Rogues and for 'em; for 'tis but fitting that we should protect and encourage Cheats, since we live by them.    Enter _Filch_.  _Filch._ Sir, _Black Moll_ hath sent word her Trial comes on in the Afternoon, and she hopes you will order Matters so as to bring her off.  _Peachum._ As the Wench is very active and industrious, you may satisfy her that I'll soften the Evidence.  _Filch._ _Tom Gagg_, Sir, is found guilty.  _Peachum._ A lazy Dog! When I took him the time before, I told him what he would come to if he did not mend his Hand. This is Death without Reprieve. I may venture to Book him [writes.] For _Tom Gagg_, forty Pounds. Let _Betty Sly_ know that I'll save her from Transportation, for I can get more by her staying in _England_.  _Filch._ _Betty_ hath brought more Goods into our Lock to-year than any five of the Gang; and in truth, 'tis a pity to lose so good a Customer.  _Peachum._ If none of the Gang take her off, she may, in the common course of Business, live a Twelve-month longer. I love to let Women scape. A good Sportsman always lets the Hen Partridges fly, because the Breed of the Game depends upon them. Besides, here the Law allows us no Reward; there is nothing to be got by the Death of Women-- except our Wives.  _Filch._ Without dispute, she is a fine Woman! 'Twas to her I was obliged for my Education, and (to say a bold Word) she hath trained up more young Fellows to the Business than the Gaming table.  _Peachum._ Truly, _Filch_, thy Observation is right. We and the Surgeons are more beholden to Women than all the Professions besides.   AIR II. The bonny gray-ey'd Morn, &c.  [Music]    _Filch._ 'Tis Woman that seduces all Mankind,     By her we first were taught the wheedling Arts:   Her very Eyes can cheat; when most she's kind,     She tricks us of our Money with our Hearts.   For her, like Wolves by Night we roam for Prey,     And practise ev'ry Fraud to bribe her Charms;   For Suits of Love, like Law, are won by Pay,     And Beauty must be fee'd into our Arms.  _Peachum._ But make haste to _Newgate_, Boy, and let my Friends know what I intend; for I love to make them easy one way or other.  _Filch._ When a Gentleman is long kept in suspence, Penitence may break his Spirit ever after. Besides, Certainty gives a Man a good Air upon his Trial,"]]]
