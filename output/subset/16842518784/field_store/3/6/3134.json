And another thing, what sort of general have I to report myself to at Volksrust?\"  The old warrior, without looking up or immediately answering me, drew various cryptic and hieroglyphic pothooks and figures on the paper before him. Then he suddenly lifted his eyes and pierced me with a look, at which I quailed and trembled.  He said very slowly: \"Look here; there is as yet no declaration of war, and hostilities have not yet commenced. You and my other officers should understand that very clearly, because possibly the differences between ourselves and Great Britain may still be settled. We are only going to occupy our frontiers because England's attitude is extremely provocative, and if England see that we are fully prepared and that we do not fear her threats, she will perhaps be wise in time and reconsider the situation. We also want to place ourselves in a position to prevent and quell a repetition of the Jameson Raid with more force than we exerted in 1896.\"  An hour afterwards I was on board a train travelling to Johannesburg in the company of General Piet Cronje and his faithful wife. General Cronje told me that he was proceeding to the western districts of the Republic to take up the command of the Potchefstroom and Lichtenburg burghers. His instructions, he said, were to protect the Western frontier.  I left General Cronje at Johannesburg on the 29th September, 1899, and never saw him again until I met him at St. Helena nearly two and a half years afterwards, on the 25th March, 1902. When I last saw him we greeted each other as free men, as free and independent legislators and officers of a free Republic. We fought for our rights to live as a nation.  Now I meet the veteran Cronje a broken old man, captive like myself, far away from our homes and our country.  Then and Now!  Then we went abroad free and freedom-loving men, burning with patriotism. Our wives and our women-folk watched us go; full of sorrow and anxiety, but satisfied that we were going abroad in our country's cause.  And Now!  Two promising and prosperous Republics wrecked, their fair homesteads destroyed, their people in mourning, and thousands of innocent women and children the victims of a cruel war.  There is scarcely an Afrikander family without an unhealable wound. Everywhere the traces of the bloody struggle; and, alas, most poignant and distressing fact of all, burghers who fought side by side with us in the earlier stages of the struggle are now to be found in the ranks of the enemy.  These wretched men, ignoring their solemn duty, left their companions in the lurch without sense of shame or respect for the braves who fell fighting for their land and people.  Oh, day of judgment! The Afrikander nation will yet avenge your treachery.     CHAPTER III.  THE INVASION OF NATAL.   After taking leave of my friend Cronje at Johannesburg Station, my first duty was to visit my various field cornets. About four o'clock that afternoon I found my commando was as nearly ready as could be expected. When I say ready, I mean ready on paper only, as later experience showed. My three field cornets were required to equip 900 mounted men with waggons and provisions, and of course they had _carte blanche_ to commandeer. Only fully enfranchised burghers of the South African Republic were liable to be commandeered, and in Johannesburg town there was an extraordinary conglomeration of cosmopolitans amenable to this gentle process of enlistment.  It would take up too much time to adequately describe the excitement of Johannesburg on this memorable day. Thousands of Uitlanders were flying from their homes, contenting themselves, in their hurry to get away, to stand in Kaffir or coal trucks and to expose themselves cheerfully to the fierce sun, and other elements. The streets were palpitating with burghers ready to proceed to the frontier that night, and with refugees speeding to the stations. Everybody was in a state of intense feeling. One was half-hearted, another cheerful, and a third thirsting for blood, while many of my men were under the influence of alcohol.  When it was known that I had arrived in the town my room in the North Western Hotel was besieged. I was approached by all sorts of people pleading exemption from commando duty. One Boer said he knew that his solemn duty was to fight for his country and his freedom, but he would rather decline. Another declared that he could not desert his family; while yet another came forward with a story that of his four horses, three had been commandeered, and that these horses were his only means of subsistence. A fourth complained that his waggons and mules had been clandestinely (although officially) removed. Many malingerers suddenly discovered acute symptoms of heart disease and brought easily-obtained doctor's certificates, assuring me that tragic consequences would attend their exposure in the field. Ladies came to me pleading exemption for their husbands, sisters for brothers, mothers for sons, all offering plausible reasons why their loved ones should be exempted from commando duty. It was very difficult to deal with all these clamorous visitors. I was much in the position of King Solomon, though lacking his wisdom. But I would venture to say that his ancient majesty himself would have been perplexed had he been in my place. It is necessary that the reader should know that the main part of the population was composed of all nationalities and lacked every element of Boer discipline.  On the evening of the 29th of September, I left with the Johannesburg commando in two trains. Two-thirds of my men had no personal acquaintance with me, and at the departure there was some difficulty because of this. One burgher came into my private compartment uninvited. He evidently forgot his proper place, and when I suggested to him that the compartment was private and reserved for officers, he told me to go to the devil, and I was compelled to remove him somewhat precipitately from the carriage. This same man was afterwards one of my most trustworthy scouts.  The following afternoon we reached Standerton, where I received telegraphic instructions from General Joubert to join my commando to that of Captain Schiel, who was in charge of the German Corps, and to place myself under the supreme command of Jan Kock, a member of the Executive Council, who had been appointed a general by the Government.  We soon discovered that quite one-third of the horses we had taken with us were untrained for the serious business of fighting, and also that many of the new burghers of foreign nationality had not the slightest idea how to ride. Our first parade, or \"Wapenschouwing\" gave food for much hilarity. Here one saw horses waltzing and jumping, while over there a rider was biting the sand, and towards evening the doctors had several patients. It may be stated that although not perfectly equipped in the matter of ambulances, we had three physicians with us, Doctors Visser, Marais, and Shaw. Our spiritual welfare was being looked after by the Reverends Nel and Martins, but not for long, as both these gentlemen quickly found that commando life was unpleasant and left us spiritually to ourselves, even as the European Powers left us politically. But I venture to state that no member of my commando really felt acutely the loss of the theological gentlemen who primarily accompanied us.  [Illustration: The Capture of the Train at Elandslaagte.]  On the following day General Kock and a large staff arrived at the laager, and, together with the German Corps, we trekked to Paardekop and Klip River, in the Orange Free State, where we were to occupy Botha's Pass. My convoy comprised about a hundred carts, mostly drawn by mules, and it was amusing to see the variety of provisions my worthy field-cornets had gathered together. There were three full waggons of lime-juice and other unnecessary articles which I caused to be unloaded at the first halting-place to make room for more serviceable provisions. It should be mentioned that of my three field-cornets only one, the late Piet Joubert of Jeppestown, actually accompanied my commando. The others sent substitutes, perhaps because they did not like to expose themselves to the change of air. We rested some days at the Klip River, in the Orange Free State, and from thence I was sent with a small escort of burghers by our General to Harrismith to meet a number of Free State officers. After travelling two days I came upon Chief Free State Commandant Prinsloo, who afterwards deserted, and other officers. The object of my mission was to organise communications with these officers. On the 11th of October, having returned to my commando, we received a report that our Government had despatched the Ultimatum to England, and that the time specified for the reply to that document had elapsed. Hostilities had begun.  We received orders to invade Natal, and crossed the frontier that very evening. I, with a patrol of 50 men, had not crossed the frontier very far when one of my scouts rode up with the report that a large British force was in sight on the other side of the River Ingogo. I said to myself at the time: \"If this be true the British have rushed up fairly quickly, and the fat will be in the fire very soon.\"  We then broke into scattered formation and carefully proceeded into Natal. After much reconnoitring and concealment, however, we soon discovered that the \"large English force\" was only a herd of cattle belonging to friendly Boers, and that the camp consisted of two tents occupied by some Englishmen and Kaffirs who were mending a defective bridge. We also came across a cart drawn by four bullocks belonging to a Natal farmer, "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25050"],["title","A Study of American Beers and Ales (#1)"],["body","|  100 | |        |      |  1911  |       |  cc. |  cc. |  cc. |     |  cc. | |22013-D | Wort |July 5  |1.0518 |  ... |13.75 |  ... | ... |0.198 | |22017-D | Beer |July 12 |1.0125 | 3.85 | 5.16 |12.86 |59.88| .216 | |        |      |        |       |      |      |      |     |      | |22014-D | Wort |July 6  |1.0517 |  ... |13.71 |  ... | ... | .198 | |22018-D | Beer |July 13 |1.0124 | 3.91 | 5.16 |12.98 |60.25| .225 | |        |      |        |       |      |      |      |     |      | |  ...   | Wort |July 7  |1.0517 |  ... |13.71 |  ... | ... | .207 | |22019-D | Beer |July 14 |1.0135 | 3.83 | 5.44 |13.10 |58.47| .234 | |        |      |        |       |      |      |      |     |      | |22015-D | Wort |July 8  |1.0517 |  ... |13.70 |  ... | ... | .198 | |22020-D | Beer |July 15 |1.0130 | 3.72 | 5.22 |12.66 |58.77| .236 | |        |      |        |       |      |      |      |     |      | |22016-D | Wort |July 10 |1.0515 |  ... |13.68 |  ... | ... | .225 | |22021-D | Beer |July 17 |1.0147 | 3.66 | 5.66 |12.98 |56.39| .221 | |        |      |        |       |      |      |      |     |      | |        |      |  1912  |       |      |      |      |     |      | |16289-C | Wort |Feb. 29 |1.0455 |  ... |12.05 |  ... | ... | .216 | |16289-C | Beer |Mar. 7  |1.0171 | 3.02 | 6.01 |12.11 |49.88| .230 | |20714-D |  Do  |Apr. 18 |1.0167 | 3.12 | 5.90 |12.14 |51.40| .243 | |        |      |        |       |      |      |      |     |      | |16299-C | Wort |Mar. 1  |1.0454 |  ... |12.02 |  ... | ... | .180 | |16299-C | Beer |Mar. 18 |1.0180 | 2.87 | 6.16 |11.94 |48.07| .234 | +--------+------+--------+-------+------+------+------+-----+------+  +--------+------+------+------+------+------+------+------+----------+ |        |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |          | |   A    |   J  |  K   |  L   |  M   |  N   |  O   |  P   |    Q     | +--------+------+------+------+------+------+------+------+----------+ |        | Grams| Grams| Grams| Grams| Grams| Grams| Grams| Degrees, | |        |  per |  per |  per |  per |  per |  per |  per | brewer's | |        |  100 |  100 |  100 |  100 |  100 |  100 |  100 | scale.   | |        |  cc. |  cc. |  cc. |  cc. |  cc. |  cc. |  cc. |          | |22013-D |0.001 | 9.79 |  ... |0.862 |0.231 |0.098 |  ... |  13.0    | |22017-D | .001 | 1.34 | 2.33 | .611 | .209 | .080 | 0.67 |  12.0    | |        |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |          | |22014-D | .001 | 9.79 |  ... | .876 | .228 | .095 |  ... |  13.0    | |22018-D | .002 | 1.36 | 2.06 | .614 | .201 | .078 |  .93 |  13.0    | |        |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |          | |  ...   | .001 |10.04 |  ... | .852 | .252 | .099 |  ... |  13.0    | |22019-D | .002 | 1.55 |  ... | .610 | .215 | .082 |  ... |   9.0    | |        |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |          | |22015-D | .001 | 9.86 |  ... | .841 | .240 | .097 |  ... |  13.0    | |22020-D | .002 | 1.59 | 2.23 | .639 | .206 | .081 |  .55 |  11.0    | |        |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |          | |22016-D | .001 | 9.84 |  ... | .845 | .245 | .097 |  ... |  13.0    | |22021-D | .001 | 1.85 | 2.18 | .635 | .208 | .082 |  .78 |  10.0    | |        |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |          | |        |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |          | |16289-C | .001 | 7.40 |  ... | .917 | .232 | .095 |  ... |   4.0    | |16289-C | .003 | 1.35 | 2.73 | .757 | .246 | .082 |  .83 |   3.0    | |20714-D | .012 | 1.47 | 2.68 | .732 | .229 | .090 |  .79 |   3.0    | |        |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |          | |16299-C | .001 | 7.41 |  ... | .874 | .238 | .101 |  ... |   2.0    | |16299-C | .012 | 1.40 | 2.82 | .737 | .240 | .090 |  .96 |   2.0    | +--------+------+------+------+------+------+------+------+----------+   TABLE II.--_Analyses of malt-and-rice and malt-and-corn worts and of the beers made from them._  Column Key: A: Sample No. B: Raw Materials.
