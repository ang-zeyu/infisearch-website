He saw the great gulf which separated him from the Earthers spreading before him, as he watched the dancers and the gay chatter and the empty badinage and the furtive hand-holding, and everything else from which he was cut off. The bizarre Individs were dancing together--he noticed one man putting an extra arm to full advantage--and the almost identical Conforms had formed their own group again. Rolf wondered how they told each other apart when they all looked alike.  \"Come on,\" Jonne said. \"I'll show you how to dance.\" He turned to look at her, with her glossy blonde hair and even features. She smiled prettily, revealing white teeth. _Probably newly purchased?_ Rolf wondered.  \"Actually I do know how to dance,\" Rolf said. \"But I do it so badly--\"  \"That doesn't matter,\" she said gaily. \"Come on.\"  She took his arm. Maybe she doesn't think I look like an ape, he thought. She doesn't treat me the way the others do. But why am I so ugly, and why is she so pretty?  He looked at her and she looked at him, and he felt her glance on his stubbly face with its ferocious teeth and burning yellowish eyes. He didn't want her to see him at all; he wished he had no face.  He folded her in his arms, feeling her warmth radiate through him. She was very tall, he realized, almost as tall as a Spacer woman--but with none of the harsh ruggedness of the women of Spacertown. They danced, she well, he clumsily. When the music stopped she guided him to the entrance of a veranda.  They walked outside into the cool night air. The lights of the city obscured most of the stars, but a few still showed, and the moon hung high above Yawk. He could dimly make out the lights of Spacertown across the river, and he thought again of Laney and Kanaday and wished Kanaday could see him now with this beautiful Earther next to him.  \"You must get lonely in space,\" she said after a while.  \"I do,\" he said, trying to keep his voice gentle. \"But it's where I belong. I'm bred for it.\"  She nodded. \"Yes. And any of those so-called men inside would give ten years of his life to be able to go to space. But yet you say it's lonely.\"         *       *       *       *       *  \"Those long rides through the night,\" he said. \"They get you down. You want to be back among people. So you come back. You come back. And what do you come back to?\"  \"I know,\" she said softly. \"I've seen Spacertown.\"  \"Why must it be that way?\" he demanded. \"Why are Spacers so lucky and so wretched all at once?\"  \"Let's not talk about it now,\" she said.  I'd like to kiss her, he thought. But my face is rough, and I'm rough and ugly, and she'd push me away. I remember the pretty little Earther girls who ran laughing away from me when I was thirteen and fourteen, before I went to space.  \"You don't have to be lonely,\" she said. One of her perfect eyebrows lifted just a little. \"Maybe someday you'll find someone who cares, Rolf. Someday, maybe.\"  \"Yeah,\" he said. \"Someday, maybe.\" But he knew it was all wrong. Could he bring this girl to Spacertown with him? No; she must be merely playing a game, looking for an evening's diversion. Something new: make love to a Spacer.  They fell silent and he watched her again, and she watched him. He heard her breath rising and falling evenly, not at all like his own thick gasps. After a while he stepped close to her, put his arm around her, tilted her head into the crook of his elbow, bent, and kissed her.  As he did it, he saw he was botching it just like everything else. He had come too close, and his heavy boot was pressing on the tip of her shoe; and he had not quite landed square on her lips. But still, he was close to her. He was reluctant to break it up, but he felt she was only half-responding, not giving anything of herself while he had given all. He drew back a step.  She did not have time to hide the expression of distaste that involuntarily crossed her face. He watched the expression on her face as she realized the kiss was over. He watched her silently.  \"Someday, maybe,\" he said. She stared at him, not hiding the fear that was starting to grow on her face.  He felt a cold chill deep in his stomach, and it grew until it passed through his throat and into his head.  \"Yeah,\" he said. \"Someday, maybe. But not you. Not anyone who's just playing games. That's all--you want something to tell your friends about, that's why you volunteered for tonight's assignment. It's all you can do to keep from laughing at me, but you're sticking to it. I don't want any of it, hear me? Get away.\"  She stepped back a pace. \"You ugly, clumsy clown. You ape!\" Tears began to spoil the flawless mask of her face. Blinded with anger, he grabbed roughly for her arm, but she broke away and dashed back inside.  She was trying to collect me, he thought. Her hobby: interesting dates. She wanted to add me to her collection. An Experience. Calmly he walked to the end of the veranda and stared off into the night, choking his rage. He watched the moon making its dead ride across the sky, and stared at the sprinkling of stars. The night was empty and cold, he thought, finally. But not more so than I.         *       *       *       *       *  He turned and looked back through the half-opened window. He saw a girl who looked almost like her, but was not tall enough and wore a different dress. Then he spotted her. She was dancing with one of the Conforms, a frail-looking man a few inches shorter than she, with regular, handsome features. She laughed at some sly joke, and he laughed with her.  Rolf watched the moon for a moment more, thinking of Laney's warning. _They just want to make fun of you. Look at the big ape, they'll say._  He knew he had to get out of there immediately. He was a Spacer, and they were Earthers, and he scorned them for being contemptuous little dolls, and they laughed at him for being a hulking ape. He was not a member of their species; he was not part of their world.  He went inside. Kal Quinton came rushing up to him.  \"I'm going,\" Rolf said.  \"What? You don't mean that,\" the little man said. \"Why, the party's scarcely gotten under way, and there are dozens of people who want to meet you. And you'll miss the big show if you don't stay.\"  \"I've already seen the big show,\" Rolf told him. \"I want out. Now.\"  \"You can't leave now,\" Quinton said. Rolf thought he saw tears in the corners of the little man's eyes. \"Please don't leave. I've told everyone you'd be here--you'll disgrace me.\"  \"What do I care? Let me out of here.\" Rolf started to move toward the door. Quinton attempted to push him back.  \"Just a minute, Rolf. Please!\"  \"I have to get out,\" he said. He knocked Quinton out of his way with a backhand swipe of his arm and dashed down the hall frantically, looking for the elevator.         *       *       *       *       *  Laney and Kanaday were sitting up waiting for him when he got back, early in the morning. He slung himself into a pneumochair and unsealed his boots, releasing his cramped, tired feet.  \"Well,\" Laney asked. \"How was the party?\"  \"You have fun among the Earthers, Rolf?\"  He said nothing.  \"It couldn't have been that bad,\" Laney said.  Rolf looked up at her. \"I'm leaving space. I'm going to go to a surgeon and have him turn me into an Earther. I hate this filthy life!\"  \"He's drunk,\" Kanaday said.  \"No, I'm not drunk,\" Rolf retorted. \"I don't want to be an ape any more.\"  \"Is that what you are? If you're an ape, what are they to you? Monkeys?\" Kanaday laughed harshly.  \"Are they really so wonderful?\" Laney asked. \"Does the life appeal to you so much that you'll give up space for it? Do you admire the Earthers so much?\"         *       *       *       *       *  _She's got me_, Rolf thought. I hate Spacertown, but will I like Yawk any better? Do I really want to become one of those little puppets? But there's nothing left in space for me. At least the Earthers are happy.  _I wish she wouldn't look at me that way._ \"Leave me alone,\" he snarled. \"I'll do whatever I want to do.\" Laney was staring at him, trying to poke behind his mask of anger. He looked at her wide shoulders, her muscular frame, her unbeautiful hair and rugged face, and compared it with Jonne's clinging grace, her flowing gold hair.  He picked up his boots and stumped up to bed.         *       *       *       *       *  The surgeon's name was Goldring, and he was a wiry, intense man who had prevailed on one of his colleagues to give him a tiny slit of a mouth. He sat behind a shining plastiline desk, waiting patiently until Rolf finished talking.  \"It can't be done,\" he said at last. \"Plastic surgeons can do almost anything, but I can't turn you into an Earther. It's not just a matter of chopping eight or ten inches out of your legs; I'd have to alter your entire bone structure or you'd be a hideous misproportioned monstrosity. And it can't be done. I can't build you a whole new body from scratch, and if I could do it you wouldn't be able to afford it.\"  Rolf stamped his foot impatiently. \"You're the third surgeon who's given me the same line. What is this--a conspiracy? I see what you can do. If you can graft a third arm onto somebody, you can turn me into an Earther.\"  \"Please, Mr. Dekker. I've told you I can't. But I don't understand why you want such a change. Hardly a week goes by without some Yawk boy coming to me and asking to be turned into a Spacer, and I have to refuse him for the same reasons I'm refusing you! That's the usual course of events--the romantic Earther boy wanting to go to space, and not being able to.\"  An idea hit Rolf. \"Was one of them Kal Quinton?\"  \"I'm sorry, Mr. Dekker. I just can't divulge any such information.\"  Rolf shot his arm across the desk and grasped the surgeon by the throat. \"Answer me!\"  \"Yes,\" the surgeon gasped. \"Quinton asked me for such an operation. Almost everyone wants one.\"  \"And you can't do it?\" Rolf asked.  \"Of course not. I've told "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25037"],["title","War and the Weird (#1)"],["body","quiet heroisms, his silent self-sacrifice, though they call for no louder name than duty, are just those chords which link him to the Great Heroism which saw its culmination in Calvary. After all, deeds only are the words of love.  The Soldier's Gospel is a wonderful revelation: the world grows gratefully small as it appreciates its work, worth and effect upon the man. All the lights by which he steers sum up good citizenship rather than sectarianship. We had long ceased to cultivate the former.  \"There goes a hospital ship,\" and a Commander of one of H.M. Patrols pointed out to me a transport full of wounded. We thought in pity of that array of maimed men, of silent suffering, of bandages, slings, crutches and artificial limbs, but suddenly there arose from the transport a mighty cheer of greeting and salutation to the white ensign. That was the reply of war's wreckage to those who pitied. It is a wonderful Gospel that produces this. But the invisible, while full of awe, does not daunt him, the soldier reaches out towards the rather unknown searching for light and finding it. Under fire means so much, it is filled up with so many experiences, you march through a lifetime in a few seconds, you get new views of the past years from another angle of vision. Shadow and darkness and doubt are lifted, the soldier is frank and honest, he is not hide-bound by petty superstitions, he is willing fairly to consider and weigh all sensations, visions and inner illuminations. He is not blinded with the dogma of either agnosticism or sectarianism, while his sense of humour saves him from many of the errors of the various \"Christian\" brotherhoods. Curious enough, the people who object to duty, who are unwilling to strike a blow for righteousness, invariably belong to some of the freak sects and are devotees of sectarianism in its narrowest meaning.  No doubt \"Vicarious Suffering\" the root doctrine of many sects in this country is responsible for the general shirking of duty on the part of so many men to-day. Men look to the ballot box for their meat in due season. They want all the privileges of citizenship without the responsibilities. The sects of to-day in teaching that the historic Christ took all our sins upon His shoulder have produced a type of sentimental immoralist who creeps under the shelter of the Cross, content that Christ should suffer in his place. So long as the Cross does not offend his eyesight, he is willing to find refuge in its shadow. Where selfishness reigns there is no vision. The gaze is upon gain, personal comfort, things entirely earthly. A man who is always looking at mud thinks in terms of mud. Just as a great naturalist confesses a loss of the finer sense of music, so there is the loss of the spiritual vision, for the spiritual sense is just as real as any other sense, but it can become useless and drop out of our life, if we do not value it and no longer use it. There are people with an artistic sense. There are more without it.  The doctrine of the atonement is used to promote the crude idea that to put our responsibilities upon others is more religious than facing them oneself. Christ's atonement is no isolated fact in history to make men cowards, but a sustained attitude of devotion in which every man and woman is to take a part. Instead of thanking Christ for hanging there upon the Cross in our place we should strive for the same courage, the same endurance, the supreme devotion to duty and the vision of Divine Aid will be ours perhaps in Angel form. To the brave in all ages has come the vision of higher things.     III  THE SOUL'S BOUNDARY LINE   \"I never was religious, but this business is changing me and many thousands more,\" so writes a soldier. From another soldier's letter we get, \"War is the most sobering influence I know ... it sobers their every day. They listen more attentively to the religious services. Sometimes I wish for the sake of the morals of our army that we were always at war.\"  When I was in Northern France I came in contact with many wounded French soldiers, men who had gone to the front as atheists and returned firm believers. \"Thank the good God I have really seen. I fell wounded in twenty-three places they tell me. I fell cursing a God I did not believe in: then a cold hand was laid upon my brow. I looked up and saw--ah! my God! how beautiful a Being. Now I do not want, I do not care to live for I want to see that beautiful Being again. I know I shall. Leave me. See to the others.\" This was a voluntary statement of a French soldier who called me to his side simply to light a cigarette for him. I left him perfectly happy and it was quite true about his number of wounds. He lived only a few hours and he knew that he was dying. Men do not usually tell lies on their death beds.  Wonderful is the warp and woof of life under fire. It is the parade of the living, the dead and those on the borderland. Men go through the whole gamut of emotions. War is an object lesson of laughter and tears playing hide and seek with each other. The tragedy and the comedy follow close on each other's heels. Deep calls not only to deep but to shallow as well, and in the end all notes harmonize. Where the swathe of the scythe is wide men's souls expand in heart qualities. Amidst the wreckage of a battlefield he picks up all kinds of things, every faculty picks up something and they become contributions to soul force. The greater the gloom the more the soldier searches for the gleam. Religion and resolution meet in the soldier and give him deeper vision. He hears his comrade say, \"I shall be taken to-day, give this to ----.\" Examples of this premonition abound. He enters a bombarded village, the only thing standing intact frequently is a figure of Christ crucified, or the Madonna looking down upon a mass of crumbling ruin. These facts are again and again verified by photographs. Often the talk of the camp as the men settle down by the fire is of the weird and the uncanny that has happened during the day; and there are pauses when the soldiers stare into the embers and forget to suck their pipes.  To explain the book of life, one would require the scrolls of eternity. War throws light on some of its stray pages as they flutter for a second on the wings of time and then disappear, but not before it has flung its cressets of light upon the black pall of doubt. Everyone now talks of psychic phenomena. In a paltry generation of superficial thinking the subject was one for jest, but there is far more in it than jesters are likely to discover. Mocking laughter never discovered anything except the vacuous fool. The appearances of spiritual beings give but scant opportunity for examination but serious investigation has now taken the place of cheap sneering. After all religion is founded upon a philosophy of apparitions. The vision of angels at Mons is no new thing. Catholicism is founded on such visions and no religion worthy of the name is without its story of angels. New aspects of matter have laid many materialistic theories in the dust, the mysterious potencies of matter which the latest science is revealing, the energy of electrons, and radium are giving us a new science of super-sensual physics and with it new vistas of thought.  It is no longer necessary to apologize for the work of psychic research, that is among intelligent people. Light is gaining on the darkness. \"I felt another hand assisting me to steer,\" said a sailor man to me who vainly tried to explain how he kept his boat from what appeared certain destruction. He would scorn to be called a religious man. \"There is nothing of the ranter in me--you know sir,\" and he used uncomplimentary remarks which I omit. \"But there sir, it was no skill of mine. All I saw was death and destruction for me and my mates, yet I knew we should pull through all right. There was another that shipped as passenger in the darkness.\"  The question of immortality and of the existence of spiritual entities which had been relegated to the limits of illusions and dreams in Victorian times by the fumbling amateur philosophers of that day, can now be discussed with quiet in the old philosophic vein which characterized the great age of thought when Greek sages argued in the Gardens of Athens. This fact alone justifies a book of the present character. The bumptious and dull ass who announces \"Miracles do not happen,\" is now seen in true perspective and he cuts a poor figure.  Apparitions, telepathy and clairvoyance are not explanations, but names for facts demanding separate explanations. In regard to such the \"ecclesiastical damn\" and the \"scientific damn\" have been freely used. If men have been hypnotized by ghost stories, they certainly have been deluded by stories of unnatural science. To deny activities of life natural and super-natural is rather silly considering no man has solved the life principle. The atoms forming the material of the brain may be proved ultimately to be identical with those that compose a jelly-fish or a jar of margarine, and brain appears to be the organ of mind, but it is mind that grasps things, places things, and thinks. Life is concerned with _thought_ as well as atoms. It receives thoughts from all sides, sometimes it claims to detect the thought giver--and that is to have a fuller vision. Men think quickly on the field of battle. They are not constrained by a narrow education and a narrower conventionalism to limit their thoughts to what others think in their own circle.     IV  THE SPIRITUAL ENTITY   Why is it that men in all ages, the best of men, the most gifted of men, with the evidence of the senses so strongly against them, have believed that a spiritual personal entity survives death's disaster? That men do so is seen in all literature and witnessed to in all lands. Vedic hymns, 3,500 years old sing of a spiritual body with as clear a vision as S. Paul. We are collecting the evidence that has floated down the ages and"]]]
