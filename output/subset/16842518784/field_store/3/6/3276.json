We have completed the dissection of the body. A minute analysis of each organ is now under way, and chemical tests of the body's substances are being made. We found that differences in the skeletal structure were almost as great as those in the fleshy tissues. We find no relationship between these structures and those of any other species--human or animal--that we have ever found.\"  \"And yet Alice was not always like that,\" said Mel.  Dr. Winters looked at him sharply. \"How do you know that?\"  Mel extended the medical records he had obtained in Central Valley. Dr. Winters picked them up and examined them for a long time while Mel watched silently.  Finally, Dr. Winters put the records down with a sigh. \"This seems to make the problem even more complex than it was.\"  \"There are X-rays, too,\" said Mel. \"Alice had pelvic X-rays only a little over two years ago. I tried to get them, but the doctor said you'd have to request them. They should be absolute proof that Alice was different then.\"  \"Tell me who has them and I'll send for them at once.\"  An hour later Dr. Winters shook his head in disbelief as he turned off the light box and removed the X-ray photograph. \"It's impossible to believe that these were taken of your wife, but they corroborate the evidence of the other medical records. They show a perfectly normal structure.\"  The two men remained silent across the desk, each reluctant to express his confused thoughts. Dr. Winters finally broke the silence. \"It must be, Mr. Hastings,\" he said, \"--it must be that this woman--this utterly alien person--is simply not your wife, Alice. Somehow, somewhere, there must be a mistake in identity, a substitution of similar individuals.\"  \"She was not out of my sight,\" said Mel. \"Everything was completely normal when I came home that night. Nothing was out of place. We went out to a show. Then, on the way home, the accident occurred. There could have been no substitution--except right here in the hospital. But I know it was Alice I saw. That's why I made you let me see her again--to make sure.\"  \"But the evidence you have brought me proves otherwise. These medical records, these X-rays prove that the girl, Alice, whom you married, was quite normal. It is utterly impossible that she could have metamorphosed into the person on whom we operated.\"  Mel stared at the reflection of the sky in the polished desk top. \"I don't know the answer,\" he said. \"It must not be Alice. But if that's the case, where is Alice?\"  \"That might even be a matter for the police,\" said Dr. Winters. \"There are many things yet to be learned about this mystery.\"  \"There's one thing more,\" said Mel. \"Fingerprints. When we first came here Alice got a job where she had to have her fingerprints taken.\"  \"Excellent!\" Dr. Winters exclaimed. \"That should give us our final proof!\"  It took the rest of the afternoon to get the fingerprint record and make a comparison. Dr. Winters called Mel at home to give him the report. There was no question. The fingerprints were identical. The corpse was that of Alice Hastings.         *       *       *       *       *  The nightmare came again that night. Worse than Mel could ever remember it. As always, it was a dream of space, black empty space, and he was floating alone in the immense depths of it. There was no direction. He was caught in a whirlpool of vertigo from which he reached out with agonized yearning for some solidarity to cling to.  There was only space.  After a time he was no longer alone. He could not see them, but he knew they were out there. The searchers. He did not know why he had to flee or why they sought him, but he knew they must never overtake him, or all would be lost.  [Illustration]  Somehow he found a way to propel himself through empty space. The searchers were growing points of light in the far distance. They gave him a sense of direction. His being, his existence, his universe of meaning and understanding depended on the success of his flight from the searchers. Faster, through the wild black depths of space--  He never knew whether he escaped or not. Always he awoke in a tangle of bedclothes, bathed in sweat, whimpering in fear. For a long time Alice had been there to touch his hand when he awoke. But Alice was gone now and he was so weary of the night pursuit. Sometimes he wished it would end with the searchers--whoever they were--catching up with him and doing what they intended to do. Then maybe there would be no more nightmare. Maybe there would be no more Mel Hastings, he thought. And that wouldn't be so bad, either.  He tossed sleeplessly the rest of the night and got up at dawn feeling as if he had not been to bed at all. He would take one day more, and then get back to the News Bureau. He'd take this day to do what couldn't be put off any longer--the collecting and disposition of Alice's personal belongings.         *       *       *       *       *  He shaved, bathed and dressed, then began emptying the drawers, one by one. There were many souvenirs, mementos. She was always collecting these. Her bottom drawer was full of stuff that he'd glimpsed only occasionally.  In the second layer of junk in the drawer he came across the brochure on Martian vacations. It must have been one of the dreams of her life, he thought. She'd wanted it so much that she'd almost come to believe that it was real. He turned the pages of the smooth, glossy brochure. Its cover bore the picture of the great Martian Princess and the blazoned emblem of Connemorra Space Lines. Inside were glistening photos of the plush interior of the great vacation liner, and pictures of the domed cities of Mars where Earthmen played more than they worked. Mars had become the great resort center of Earth.  Mel closed the book and glanced again at the Connemorra name. Only one man had ever amassed the resources necessary to operate a private space line. Jim Connemorra had done it; no one knew quite how. But he operated now out of both hemispheres with a space line that ignored freight and dealt only in passenger business. He made money, on a scale that no government-operated line had yet been able to approach.  Mel sank down to the floor, continuing to shift through the other things in the drawer.  His hand stopped. He remained motionless as recognition showered sudden frantic questions in his mind. There lay a ticket envelope marked Connemorra Lines.  The envelope was empty when he looked inside, and there was no name on it. But it was worn. As if it might have been carried to Mars and back.  In sudden frenzy he began examining each article and laying it in a careless pile on the floor. He recognized a pair of idiotic Martian dolls. He found a tourist map of the ruined cities of Mars. He found a menu from the Red Sands Hotel.  And below all these there was a picture album. Alice at the Red Sands. Alice at the Phobos Oasis. Alice at the Darnella Ruins. He turned the pages of the album with numb fingers. Alice in a dozen Martian settings. Some of them were dated. About two years ago. They had gone together, Alice had said, but there was no evidence of Mel's presence on any such trip.  But it was equally impossible that Alice had made the trip, yet here was proof. Proof that swept him up in a doubting of his own senses. How could such a thing have taken place? Had he actually made such a trip and been stripped of the memory by some amnesia? Maybe he had forced himself to go with her and the power of his lifelong phobia had wiped it from his memory.  And what did it all have to do--if anything--with the unbelievable thing Dr. Winters had found about Alice?  Overcome with grief and exhaustion he sat fingering the mementos aimlessly while he stared at the pictures and the ticket envelope and the souvenirs.         *       *       *       *       *  Dr. Winters spoke a little more sharply than he intended. \"I don't think anything is going to be solved by a wild-goose chase to Mars. It's going to cost you a great deal of money, and there isn't a single positive lead to any solution.\"  \"It's the only possible explanation.\" Mel persisted. \"Something happened on Mars to change her from what she once was to--what you saw on your operating table.\"  \"And you are hoping that in some desperate way you will find there was a switch of personalities--that there may be a ghost of a chance of finding Alice still alive.\"  Mel bit his lip. He was scarcely willing to admit such a hope but it was the foundation of his decision. \"I've got to do what I can,\" he said. \"I must take the chance. The uncertainty will torment me all my life if I don't.\"  Dr. Winters shook his head. \"I still wish I could persuade you against it. You will find only disappointment.\"  \"My mind is made up. Will you help me or not?\"  \"What can I do?\"  \"I can't go into space unless I can find some way of lifting, even temporarily, this phobia that nearly drives me crazy at the thought of going out there. Isn't there a drug, a hypnotic method, or something to help a thing like this?\"  \"This isn't my field,\" said Dr. Winters. \"But I suspect that the cause of your trouble cannot be suppressed. It will have to be lifted. Psycho-recovery is the only way to accomplish that. I can recommend a number of good men. This, too, is very expensive.\"  \"I should have done it for Alice--long ago,\" said Mel.         *       *       *       *       *  Dr. Martin, the psychiatrist, was deeply interested in Mel's problem. \"It sounds as if it is based on some early trauma, which has long since been wiped from your conscious memory. Recovery may be easy or difficult, depending on how much suppression of the original event has taken place.\"  \"I don't even care what the original event was,\" said Mel, \"if you rid me of this overwhelming fear of space. Dr. Winters said he thought recovery would be "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2610"],["title","Notre-Dame de Paris (#1)"],["body"," on the intermediate landing-place, flowed in broad waves along       its lateral slopes,—the grand staircase, I say, trickled       incessantly into the place, like a cascade into a lake. The       cries, the laughter, the trampling of those thousands of feet,       produced a great noise and a great clamor. From time to time,       this noise and clamor redoubled; the current which drove the       crowd towards the grand staircase flowed backwards, became       troubled, formed whirlpools. This was produced by the buffet of       an archer, or the horse of one of the provost’s sergeants, which       kicked to restore order; an admirable tradition which the       provostship has bequeathed to the constablery, the constablery to       the _maréchaussée_, the _maréchaussée_ to our _gendarmeri_ of       Paris.        Thousands of good, calm, _bourgeois_ faces thronged the windows,       the doors, the dormer windows, the roofs, gazing at the palace,       gazing at the populace, and asking nothing more; for many       Parisians content themselves with the spectacle of the       spectators, and a wall behind which something is going on becomes       at once, for us, a very curious thing indeed.        If it could be granted to us, the men of 1830, to mingle in       thought with those Parisians of the fifteenth century, and to       enter with them, jostled, elbowed, pulled about, into that       immense hall of the palace, which was so cramped on that sixth of       January, 1482, the spectacle would not be devoid of either       interest or charm, and we should have about us only things that       were so old that they would seem new.        With the reader’s consent, we will endeavor to retrace in       thought, the impression which he would have experienced in       company with us on crossing the threshold of that grand hall, in       the midst of that tumultuous crowd in surcoats, short, sleeveless       jackets, and doublets.        And, first of all, there is a buzzing in the ears, a dazzlement       in the eyes. Above our heads is a double ogive vault, panelled       with wood carving, painted azure, and sown with golden       fleurs-de-lis; beneath our feet a pavement of black and white       marble, alternating. A few paces distant, an enormous pillar,       then another, then another; seven pillars in all, down the length       of the hall, sustaining the spring of the arches of the double       vault, in the centre of its width. Around four of the pillars,       stalls of merchants, all sparkling with glass and tinsel; around       the last three, benches of oak, worn and polished by the trunk       hose of the litigants, and the robes of the attorneys. Around the       hall, along the lofty wall, between the doors, between the       windows, between the pillars, the interminable row of all the       kings of France, from Pharamond down: the lazy kings, with       pendent arms and downcast eyes; the valiant and combative kings,       with heads and arms raised boldly heavenward. Then in the long,       pointed windows, glass of a thousand hues; at the wide entrances       to the hall, rich doors, finely sculptured; and all, the vaults,       pillars, walls, jambs, panelling, doors, statues, covered from       top to bottom with a splendid blue and gold illumination, which,       a trifle tarnished at the epoch when we behold it, had almost       entirely disappeared beneath dust and spiders in the year of       grace, 1549, when du Breul still admired it from tradition.        Let the reader picture to himself now, this immense, oblong hall,       illuminated by the pallid light of a January day, invaded by a       motley and noisy throng which drifts along the walls, and eddies       round the seven pillars, and he will have a confused idea of the       whole effect of the picture, whose curious details we shall make       an effort to indicate with more precision.        It is certain, that if Ravaillac had not assassinated Henri IV.,       there would have been no documents in the trial of Ravaillac       deposited in the clerk’s office of the Palais de Justice, no       accomplices interested in causing the said documents to       disappear; hence, no incendiaries obliged, for lack of better       means, to burn the clerk’s office in order to burn the documents,       and to burn the Palais de Justice in order to burn the clerk’s       office; consequently, in short, no conflagration in 1618. The old       Palais would be standing still, with its ancient grand hall; I       should be able to say to the reader, “Go and look at it,” and we       should thus both escape the necessity,—I of making, and he of       reading, a description of it, such as it is. Which demonstrates a       new truth: that great events have incalculable results.        It is true that it may be quite possible, in the first place,       that Ravaillac had no accomplices; and in the second, that if he       had any, they were in no way connected with the fire of 1618. Two       other very plausible explanations exist: First, the great flaming       star, a foot broad, and a cubit high, which fell from heaven, as       every one knows, upon the law courts, after midnight on the       seventh of March; second, Théophile’s quatrain,—      “Sure, ’twas but a sorry game     When at Paris, Dame Justice,     Through having eaten too much spice,     Set the palace all aflame.”        Whatever may be thought of this triple explanation, political,       physical, and poetical, of the burning of the law courts in 1618,       the unfortunate fact of the fire is certain. Very little to-day       remains, thanks to this catastrophe,—thanks, above all, to the       successive restorations which have completed what it spared,—very       little remains of that first dwelling of the kings of France,—of       that elder palace of the Louvre, already so old in the time of       Philip the Handsome, that they sought there for the traces of the       magnificent buildings erected by King Robert and described by       Helgaldus. Nearly everything has disappeared. What has become of       the chamber of the chancellery, where Saint Louis consummated his       marriage? the garden where he administered justice, “clad in a       coat of camelot, a surcoat of linsey-woolsey, without sleeves,       and a sur-mantle of black sandal, as he lay upon the carpet with       Joinville?” Where is the chamber of the Emperor Sigismond? and       that of Charles IV.? that of Jean the Landless? Where is the       staircase, from which Charles VI. promulgated his edict of       pardon? the slab where Marcel cut the throats of Robert de       Clermont and the Marshal of Champagne, in the presence of the       dauphin? the wicket where the bulls of Pope Benedict were torn,       and whence those who had brought them departed decked out, in       derision, in copes and mitres, and making an apology through all       Paris? and the grand hall, with its gilding, its azure, its       statues, its pointed arches, its pillars, its immense vault, all       fretted with carvings? and the gilded chamber? and the stone       lion, which stood at the door, with lowered head and tail between       his legs, like the lions on the throne of Solomon, in the       humiliated attitude which befits force in the presence of       justice? and the beautiful doors? and the stained glass? and the       chased ironwork, which drove Biscornette to despair? and the       delicate woodwork of Hancy? What has time, what have men done       with these marvels? What have they given us in return for all       this Gallic history, for all this Gothic art? The heavy flattened       arches of M. de Brosse, that awkward architect of the       Saint-Gervais portal. So much for art; and, as for history, we       have the gossiping reminiscences of the great pillar, still       ringing with the tattle of the Patru.        It is not much. Let us return to the veritable grand hall of the       veritable old palace. The two extremities of this gigantic       parallelogram were occupied, the one by the famous marble table,       so long, so broad, and so thick that, as the ancient land       rolls—in a style that would have given Gargantua an appetite—say,       “such a slice of marble as was never beheld in the world”; the       other by the chapel where Louis XI. had himself sculptured on his       knees before the Virgin, and whither he caused to be brought,       without heeding the two gaps thus made in the row of royal       statues, the statues of Charlemagne and of Saint Louis, two       saints whom he supposed to be great in favor in heaven, as kings       of France. This chapel, quite new, having been built only six       years, was entirely in that charming taste of delicate       architecture, of marvellous sculpture, of fine and deep chasing,       which marks with us the end of the Gothic era, and which is       perpetuated to about the middle of the sixteenth century in the       fairylike fancies of the Renaissance. The little open-work rose       window, pierced above the portal, was, in particular, a       masterpiece of lightness and grace; one would have pronounced it       a star of lace.        In the middle of the hall, opposite the great door, a platform of       gold brocade, placed against the wall, a special entrance to       which had been effected through a window in the corridor of the       gold chamber, had been erected for the Flemish emissaries and the       other great personages invited to the presentation of the mystery       play.        It was upon the marble table that the mystery was to be enacted,       as usual. It had been arranged for the purpose, early in the       morning; its rich slabs of marble, all scratched by the heels of       law clerks, supported a cage of carpenter’s work of considerable       height, the upper surface of which, within view of the"]]]
