In the end he made up his mind that there was only one thing to do: he must make the opening bigger.  Day after day Grunty Pig crowded against the loose board. And at last came his reward. Two more rusty nails gave way all at once. Under Grunty's weight the board opened wide. And as he slipped through the space, to freedom, the board snapped back into place again.  There he was, with the wide world before him. And there was the pen, with no opening anywhere to be seen.  With a grunt of delight Grunty Pig trotted out of the low building and found himself on the edge of Farmer Green's orchard.  He noticed that there was a fragrant smell of apples in the air.     IV  THE WIDE, WIDE WORLD   It was the first time Grunty Pig had ever been outside his pen. And since he didn't know how long it would be before Farmer Green found him and took him back home, he decided that he had better make the most of his outing while it lasted.  Hurrying into the orchard, Grunty ate heartily of the fruit that lay upon the ground. After he had devoured a few dozen apples he began to lose his appetite for that sort of food. So he started to root beneath the trees. It was fun to dig. Besides, he found a good many tender roots that tickled his taste. They were different from anything he had ever eaten before.  After a while Grunty Pig learned something. He had always supposed that he could go on eating forever, if he were only lucky enough to have the chance. But to his surprise he found that there was a limit to the amount he could consume with comfort. He began to have a _tight_ feeling about his waistband. At first he dared hope it would go away. But the more he ate, the worse he felt. And at last he gave a grunt of disappointment.  \"I can't eat any more,\" he whined. \"Here's a whole world full of food just going to waste. And I can't even hold one half of it!\"  Still, there were other pleasures to be had besides eating. Grunty crawled through the fence into the lane. And near the barn, where the cows had trampled, he beheld such beautiful, sticky, deep mud as he had never dreamed could be found anywhere.  Grunty Pig gave a deep sigh of happiness as he wallowed in the mire. He lay on his stomach, he turned upon each side. He even squirmed through a puddle and rolled over in it, so that there wasn't a clean patch on him, anywhere. Little did he care that his silvery bristles were smeared with black. The mud felt delightfully cool upon his piggy, pinkish skin.  \"This is almost better than eating,\" Grunty squealed.  At last his gurgles and grunts attracted the notice of a proud creature known as Henrietta Hen. She had been scratching for worms in the farmyard. And now she came running around a corner of the barn and peered through the fence at Grunty.  \"You careless child!\" she squawked. \"Stop playing in that mud! Don't you know that it's very dangerous to get your feet wet?\"  Grunty Pig stood up and looked at her.  \"Goodness! You're a sight!\" Henrietta Hen exclaimed. \"Does your mother know you're here?\"  Now, Grunty Pig didn't answer a single one of Henrietta's questions. He merely stared at her and said nothing. So it was no wonder that she thought him stupid.  \"Poor Mrs. Pig!\" thought Henrietta Hen. \"It's bad enough to have a child so untidy as this youngster. But it's far worse to have a dull-witted one.\"  Then to Grunty she said sharply, \"You'd better get out of that mudhole and go dry yourself in the sun.\"  He actually obeyed her. And as soon as Henrietta Hen saw that he was sunning himself she walked out of sight around the barn, stopping now and then to pick up some tidbit or other.  \"Good!\" Grunty Pig grunted. \"She's gone. This was the easiest way to get rid of her.\"     V  SIXES AND SEVENS   Not until feeding time came did anyone discover that Grunty Pig was gone from the pen. It may seem strange that neither his mother nor any of his brothers and sisters missed him. But when there are seven children in a family it is no wonder that one of them could slip away without having his absence noticed. It is specially easy, in such a large family, to overlook the littlest.  If Mrs. Pig had known there was a loose board on the pen she would certainly have counted noses to find out whether her children were all safe at home. But nobody knew about that loose board except Grunty himself.  It was lucky that Farmer Green had made the lid for Mrs. Pig's children's feeding trough--the lid with the seven holes in it. When he poured the children's supper into the trough and slammed down the lid he stood and watched Mrs. Pig's youngsters as they scrambled to the trough and stuck--each of them--a nose into a hole.  All at once Farmer Green noticed something queer. \"Hullo!\" he cried to his son Johnnie. \"There's an empty hole here. We've lost a pig!\"  He looked closely at the row of six squirming bunches of squeals.  \"I declare!\" said Farmer Green. \"It's the runt that's gone.\"  Mrs. Pig, who was enjoying her own supper a little way off, did not hear what Farmer Green said. Her children were making a good deal of noise. And to tell the truth, Mrs. Pig herself wasn't exactly a silent eater. When Farmer Green jumped into the pen and began to poke at the sides of it she wondered what he was doing. Soon he found the loose board and pushed against it with his foot, exclaiming, \"Here's where he got away! Who'd have thought that the runt was the smartest of the family?  \"Run and get me a hammer and a few nails,\" said Farmer Green to his son Johnnie. \"We must fix this pen before any more of the pigs crawl out.\"  Well, when she heard the news Mrs. Pig nearly choked over a bit of something or other that she was eating. Grunty was gone! If she hadn't spent most of the afternoon dozing perhaps she would have missed him. And poor Mrs. Pig began to reproach herself for what wasn't really her fault at all.  \"I hope you'll find him,\" she told Farmer Green as he drove a nail into the loose board. \"I hope you won't leave my son out to-night. There's no knowing what might happen to a child of his tender years.\"  Maybe Farmer Green heard her request. Anyhow, as he handed the hammer to Johnnie he said, \"Come and help me, after you put the hammer back. We'll have to find that pig. If a bear happened to come down from the mountain to-night he'd treat himself to a feast. That runt would make a nice, tender meal.\"  Mrs. Pig must certainly have heard--and understood--Farmer Green's remark. For she gave a loud squeal of alarm.  \"Hurry!\" she begged him. \"Please, Mr. Green, do find Grunty before dark!\"     VI  MR. CROW HELPS   It was a wonder that Johnnie Green and his father ever found Grunty Pig.  Soon after Henrietta Hen left him, Grunty crept out of the lane and wandered into the cornfield. He had an idea that Henrietta might go and tell his mother that she had seen him wallowing in the mud behind the barn. And he did not want to be dragged back to the pigpen.  Grunty had no way of knowing that Henrietta Hen forgot all about him before she had crossed the farmyard. She fell into a loud dispute with a neighbor. And she never thought of Grunty again.  Grunty Pig enjoyed his ramble into the field of waving corn. The corn was sweet; and the dirt was loose--just the finest sort to root in that a body could possibly want. He had the place all to himself until at last a black gentleman came flying up in a great hurry and ordered him in a hoarse voice to \"get out of the corn--and be quick about it!\"  On him Grunty Pig tried the same trick that he had used on Henrietta Hen. He looked up with a stupid stare at the newcomer and said never a word.  Old Mr. Crow--for it was he that had commanded Grunty to leave--old Mr. Crow abused him roundly. Mr. Crow was not empty-headed, like Henrietta Hen. He was not to be deceived so easily.  \"Why don't you answer me?\" he bawled. \"You make noise enough when you're at home. I've heard you often, way across the cornfield.\" Mr. Crow cawed so angrily that a dozen of his cronies flew over from the woods to see what was going on. And the whole thirteen made such an uproar that Farmer Green couldn't help noticing them. He and Johnnie were in the orchard, hunting for Grunty Pig.  \"Those crows are up to some mischief,\" Farmer Green declared. \"You don't suppose--do you?--that they're teasing that pig?\"  Well, Johnnie Green was willing to go and find out. And sure enough! he found Grunty in the cornfield.  Johnnie Green picked him up, tucked him under his arm--plastered with dried mud as he was--and brought him in triumph to the barn.  Farmer Green laughed when he saw Grunty Pig.  \"He looks as if he had been enjoying himself,\" he remarked as he dropped Grunty into the pen with the rest of Mrs. Pig's children.  \"Are you going to feed him?\" Johnnie Green inquired.  Again his father laughed.  \"No!\" he replied. \"That pig has stuffed himself so full he can scarcely waddle.\"  As for Mrs. Pig, she didn't know whether to laugh or to weep. She was glad to have Grunty safe at home again; but he was a sad sight.  At first Mrs. Pig thought Farmer Green had made a mistake. She thought he had found somebody else's child. For Grunty was so daubed with black mud that she actually didn't know him until she heard him grunt. \"Where have you been?\" she asked him in her sternest voice.  \"I've been out in the world,\" he answered. \"And I've had a fine time.\"  \"It's easy to see,\" said Mrs. Pig, \"that you're a born wallower. It's a pity that you haven't your brother Blackie's complexion. The dirt does show so dreadfully on silver bristles!\"     VII  THE GRUMBLER   All the farmyard folk agreed that Farmer Green took the best of care of everybody. Mrs. Pig often told her children that they were lucky to have so good a home. And not having lived anywhere else, they never imagined that anything could be finer than their pen.  After the day when he escaped from the pen, however, Grunty Pig began to complain. He wasn't satisfied with the food that Farmer Green gave him, he"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24731"],["title","The Tale of Grunty Pig (#2)"],["body","because there was no good place to wallow in mud, and especially did he object because there wasn't a tree to rub against. \"The orchard,\" he often said, \"is a much pleasanter place than this pen is. There are trees enough in the orchard for every member of our family to rub against--all at the same time.\"  Somehow, when Grunty talked in that fashion every one of Mrs. Pig's children began to crowd against the sides of the pen. And even Mrs. Pig herself felt an annoying tickling along her back. She did wish that Grunty wouldn't mention such matters.  But nothing Mrs. Pig could say seemed to do any good. He was always prattling, anyhow. She could no more stop his flow of grunts and squeals than she could have kept the water in the brook from babbling down the mountainside to Swift River.  And even more annoying to Mrs. Pig was the way her son Grunty tried to rub his back against _her_. She said \"Don't!\" to him so often that she became heartily sick of the word.  What bothered Mrs. Pig most of all was Grunty's behavior whenever Farmer Green came to the pen. It was mortifying to her to have her son actually try to _scratch his back_ against her in the presence of a visitor.  \"I do hope,\" said Mrs. Pig to Farmer Green, \"I do hope you don't think that I haven't tried to teach this child better manners.\" And then, when all the rest of her family began to squirm and fidget against the sides of the pen she added with a sigh, \"Look at them! Anyone would suppose they had had no bringing up at all!\"  Farmer Green smiled as he leaned over the pen and watched the antics of Grunty Pig and his brothers and sisters.  \"There's something that I can do for your family to make them happier,\" he told Mrs. Pig. \"To-morrow--if I can spare the time--I'll make a change here. A lady who's raising such a fine family as yours deserves the best there is. She ought to have a home with every modern improvement.\"  \"There!\" Mrs. Pig exclaimed to her children as soon as Farmer Green left them. \"Did you hear what he said? Farmer Green is a kind man. I shouldn't have blamed him if he had put us into the poorest pen on the place, after seeing your unmannerly actions. You'll have to behave better--especially after we have our new improvements.\"  Well, the next day Farmer Green brought a stout post and set it firmly in the center of Mrs. Pig's pen.  \"That's for you and your family to rub against,\" he informed Mrs. Pig.  Really, he needn't have explained what the improvement was for. No sooner had he climbed out of the pen than Mrs. Pig and her children began to put the rubbing post to good use. Grunty was the first of all to try it. And to his mother's delight, he stopped grumbling at once. Nor did he ever again disgrace her by scratching his back against her. Instead, he always walked up to the rubbing post like a little gentleman. At least, that was what Mrs. Pig said.  [Illustration: The Muley Cow Advises Grunty Pig to Go Home.  (_Page 34_)]     VIII  FEARFUL NEWS   There came a day at last when Farmer Green gave Mrs. Pig and her family a great treat. He let them out of their pen and turned them loose in a little yard out of doors. Such gruntings and squealings hadn't been heard on the farm for a long time. It was just like a picnic. And everybody had the finest of times. Still, Grunty Pig wasn't content to stay in the yard with the rest of the family. It wasn't long before he found a hole in the fence big enough to wriggle through. And off he went. And he was actually glad, for once, that he was the littlest of the family. There wasn't another of Mrs. Pig's children that could squeeze through the opening.  Grunty Pig trotted the whole length of the lane. When he reached the pasture he found himself face to face with the Muley Cow, who acted much surprised to see him there.  \"You'd better go back home at once,\" she advised him. \"There are bears on Blue Mountain. Sometimes they come down this way. Only last week I had an adventure with one in the back pasture.\" She did not tell Grunty that she had run away from Cuffy Bear, down the hillside. \"A bear,\" said the Muley Cow, \"would be delighted to meet a tender little pig like you.\"  Grunty Pig did not even thank the Muley Cow for warning him.  \"I'd like to meet a bear,\" he declared stoutly. \"I hope I'll meet one to-day.\"  Leaving the Muley Cow, he zigzagged up the hill through the pasture, stopping now and then to dig up many a juicy root.  Although Mrs. Pig missed her runaway son after a time, she was not greatly disturbed.  \"He can't be far off,\" she thought. \"He'll come back before dark.\" And when Grunty did at last come crawling into the little yard Mrs. Pig was merely vexed with him for having gone off without her consent. She was just about to give him a well deserved scolding. But before she could speak to him, Grunty greeted her with a loud squeal.  \"I saw a bear in the pasture!\" he cried.  Mrs. Pig promptly forgot her displeasure. Although her son was certainly unharmed, she couldn't help being startled. It gave her what she called \"a turn\" to learn that Grunty had met a bear.  \"A bear!\" Mrs. Pig gasped. \"A bear is a terribly dangerous creature. It's a wonder that you ever got home.... What did you do when you saw him?\" Mrs. Pig demanded.  \"I walked away,\" said Grunty.  \"He couldn't have noticed you,\" Mrs. Pig declared. \"If you had squealed it would have been the end of you.\"  Grunty Pig felt that he was the most important member of the family. Not one of his brothers or sisters had ever seen a bear. At least they had never claimed to have enjoyed so fearsome a sight.  \"It was nothing,\" he boasted. \"I'd as soon meet a bear as the Muley Cow.\"  His mother, however, was of another mind. She kept looking about in an uneasy fashion.  \"I wish Farmer Green would come and put us into our pen,\" she murmured. \"It will soon be dark. And I shouldn't like to spend the night out here--not with a bear in the neighborhood.\"     IX  A GREAT ADVENTURE   The next outing that Farmer Green gave Mrs. Pig's family in the little yard proved to be anything but a picnic--for Mrs. Pig. That poor lady had a dreadful time. Grunty ran away again. And he hadn't been gone long before his mother heard a loud squealing in the nearest field. The sound rapidly grew louder. And as she stood still and listened, Mrs. Pig knew that it was Grunty's squeal and that he was drawing nearer every moment.  \"Dear me!\" she cried. \"He must be in trouble.\"  Soon Grunty tumbled through the fence. And scrambling to his feet he ran to his mother, crying at the top of his voice, \"A bear chased me!\"  \"Oh! Oh!\" shrieked Mrs. Pig. \"It's a mercy he didn't catch you. Oh! Oh! It's lucky you're no fatter, else you couldn't have run so fast.\" Being more than fat, herself, and greatly excited, Mrs. Pig had to stop talking for a time, because she gurgled and wheezed and panted in a most alarming fashion.  At last, when she had somewhat recovered from her flurry, she called to Grunty. And looking at him severely Mrs. Pig said to him, \"Let this be a lesson to you. Never, never stray away from the farmyard again!\"  \"Yes, Mother!\" was Grunty's glib reply. Then he sidled away. Somehow he felt uneasy under his mother's gaze.  \"Perhaps it was a good thing, after all, that the bear chased him,\" Mrs. Pig muttered. \"Maybe this fright will keep him at home.\"  She soon discovered that it would take more than a mere fright--more than a command--to stop Grunty from running away. For it wasn't long before she missed him again.  If Mrs. Pig hadn't been so upset she might have been vexed--and with good reason.  \"Oh! that dear little Grunty!\" she wailed. \"The bear may have caught him already, in the cabbage patch.\"  Then piercing squeals fell once more on Mrs. Pig's ears.  \"Dear! Dear!\" she cried. \"I ought to have watched him. I ought to have kept an eye on Grunty. After all, he's little more than a baby.\"  Again the squeals grew louder. Again Grunty Pig burst through the hole in the fence and romped up to his mother.  \"He chased me another time!\" he grunted. \"The bear chased me almost as far as the fence.\"  \"Sakes alive!\" his mother shrieked. \"Somebody ought to tell Farmer Green! This farm is not a safe place to live, with a bear prowling about it.\"  \"Do you want me to go and tell Mr. Green?\" Grunty inquired.  \"_You?_\" his mother exclaimed. \"No, indeed! You stay right here with me! Don't you dare stir out of this yard!\" And to Grunty's astonishment, Mrs. Pig bowled him right over, to show him that she meant what she said.  He jumped to his feet in a jiffy. And he was all ready to slink away into a corner of the yard; but his mother bade him wait.  \"This bear--\" she said--\"what did he look like?\"     X  A QUEER BEAR   Grunty Pig's little eyes fell away from his mother's when she asked him what the bear looked like--the bear that had chased him.  \"Er--he was whitish, with brown spots, like Johnnie Green's dog,\" said Grunty; \"and--er--he had a long tail like the old horse Ebenezer's; and he had six legs.\"  Mrs. Pig suddenly made a most peculiar sound. It couldn't be called a squeal, nor a grunt, nor a gurgle, nor a gasp. It was a little like all four. And springing clumsily upon her son, Mrs. Pig upset him before he could dodge her.  Grunty Pig began to whimper. \"What have I done?\" he whined.  \"You've deceived me!\" his mother cried. \"You haven't seen a bear. You've never seen a bear in all your life.\"  \"Ouch,\" Grunty howled, as his mother sent him sprawling once more. \"I didn't mean any harm. I was only having fun with you.\"  \"Well,\" said his mother. \"Turn about is fair play. I'll have a little fun with _you_, now.\"  Mrs. Pig gave her wayward son such a punishing that he remembered it all the rest of that day. At least, he stayed at home. And Mrs. Pig dared hope that at last she had cured him of two bad habits--running away and telling fibs.  The next day, however, the fields called again to Grunty Pig. They called so plainly that he couldn't resist answering.  \"I'll slip "]]]
