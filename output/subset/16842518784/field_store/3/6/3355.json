(2) A separate Department of Child Welfare would cost more than at     present because it would not be able to rely upon some of the     staffing and administrative facilities of the Department of     Education.      (3) Some of the institutions now conducted or controlled by child     welfare are really schools and as such they would always need to be     under the real control of the Department of Education.      (4) In actual practice no one could define with precision where the     functions of child welfare could be separated from those of     education.      (5) Over the years child welfare and education have worked out     their own joint policy of administration. They have in fact worked     along in harmony and with effective co-operation, and there     appeared to be no sound reason for disturbing a set-up which was in     fact efficient, economical, and harmonious.  We were completely satisfied that the present arrangement has the full support of the Director of Education and the Superintendent of Child Welfare. This view has also the support of the Public Service Commission. After a study of the evidence that was placed before us we came to the unanimous conclusion that matters should be left as they are.  If it was decided by Government that child welfare should remain linked with the Department of Education it would be advisable that some form of administrative procedure should be worked out to define the relations between the Director of Education and the Superintendent of Child Welfare in so far as their respective approaches to the Minister of Education and the Minister of Social Welfare are concerned. It was clear to us that the present set-up is both efficient and harmonious. A detailed plan for the due performance of the various duties was worked out and agreed to by all interested parties. As it is a purely administrative matter, we have not felt that it was necessary to embody it in this report. Suffice it to say that in our opinion child welfare should remain a part of the Department of Education, that its Superintendent should have a right of direct reference to the Minister of Social Welfare, that the Minister of Social Welfare should be directly responsible for the administration of the vote applicable to the Child Welfare Division, and that the administrative plan placed before us should be adopted and applied unless and until varied by agreement between the Ministers concerned.   _Page 59, paragraph (c)_  Dr Beeby said:      \"It is true that no regulations have ever been gazetted prescribing     the duties of Child Welfare Officers. The provisions for them under     the Act are merely permissive, and we think it would be a     retrograde step to gazette any. The duties of the Superintendent     are adequately defined in the Act, and, as in other parts of the     Public Service, he delegates such of those powers as he thinks fit     to his subordinates. The Division's work has been done on this     basis since the passing of the Act, and we can recall no incident     where the absence of regulations has caused any difficulty. To     define the powers might well be to restrict them and to interfere     with the very preventive work we all desire.      \"There should, as the Committee suggests, be some mention of     Honorary Child Welfare Officers in the Act, but their powers,     again, are better given by delegation than by legislation. It is     very desirable that the extent to which use is made of an Honorary     Officer's services be allowed to vary with the requirements of the     district and the ability of the officer.\"  We agree with the views expressed above by Dr Beeby.   _Page 59, paragraph (d)_  The Mazengarb Committee pointed out that the practice and procedure of the Children's Court may tend to vary from place to place throughout the Dominion because the Court was not presided over by its own specially appointed Magistrate.  On this point the Director of Education said:      \"This comment is true. The position has arisen because of the     practical difficulties of having the work carried out by specially     appointed Magistrates. The volume of work involved could justify     the appointment of only a few such Magistrates, and, because of the     geographical spread of the work, they could not handle it     expeditiously.\"  On this point we have no recommendations to make. We feel that the best possible results are being secured by the Magistrates having regard to their numbers and to the conditions under which they work.   _Page 59, paragraph (e)_  The Mazengarb Committee felt that it was a pity that proceedings in the Children's Court were not conducted in a separate and distinct building. It should at least be possible, said the report, to hear and determine the cases in a room other than the ordinary Court room of a Magistrate's Court. This was rather in the nature of a counsel of perfection. In less-densely populated districts it would not be easy or economic to provide separate accommodation of the kind envisaged. In larger and busier centres it was often necessary to study the convenience of the Magistrates themselves. The present Committee has no specific recommendation to make in this connection.  The best that can be done is in fact being done.   _Page 60, paragraph (f)_  On the subject of the publicity to be given to proceedings in the Children's Court the Mazengarb Committee said:      \"There may be reasons why a Children's Court should be open to the     public ... The public has a right to know how child offenders have     been dealt with. The Committee does not recommend any alteration in     the provision prohibiting the publication of the name of any child,     or of any name or particulars likely to lead to identification.     Subject to this, it is desirable that reporters should be allowed     to attend.\"  With these views we find ourselves to be in complete agreement.   _Page 60, paragraph (g)_  The Mazengarb Committee appeared to hold the view that when children have been placed under supervision there was no adequate \"follow up\" procedure.  The following is Dr Beeby's comment upon this paragraph:      \"It is a little difficult to see just what the Committee are     suggesting in this paragraph. If they are proposing that a Child     Welfare Officer be required to report progress to a Magistrate for     his personal information and to enable him to check on the     correctness of his judgment, there can be no possible objection.     When asked for, indeed, this is already done. If, on the other     hand, it is proposed that the Magistrate have continuing authority     over the child, then it would turn the Court into a social work     agency and would run counter to the whole trend in the development     of Children's Court and child welfare work from the beginning of     this century. The Magistrate would be compelled to take on     responsibilities for which he is not trained, and Child Welfare     Officers would tend to become merely junior probation officers     attached to the Court. One of the advantages of the present system     is that the Superintendent, being the final authority, can ensure     uniform standards of case work throughout New Zealand. If it were     left to each individual Magistrate to decide exactly what should be     done with children, it is certain that wide variations in     principles and procedures would occur. Experience has shown, for     example, that some Magistrates, with no first-hand knowledge of our     institutions, would send to them children for whom they are not     established to cater.      \"With regard to the Committee's suggestion that there 'should be     some person or body apart from the departmental officers to whom a     child could turn for help ...', we would agree that something like     the Visiting Justice system of the Justice Department might apply     to our institutions as a guarantee to the public and as a     protection to both children and officers. However, to extend such a     system to children boarded out in private homes would be to ask for     endless trouble. People would be loath to accept State wards into     their homes if it laid them open to official visits from laymen     whose sole function was to hear complaints from the children. The     visits of Child Welfare Officers and of Inspectors of the Division     must, we feel, be accepted as the main guarantee to the public of     fair treatment.\"  Without expressing any decided opinion, the Committee felt that what the Director of Education has to say is worthy of consideration by Government.   Certain Specific Changes Proposed by the Mazengarb Committee  In clause (5) on pages 60 to 63, both inclusive, of the report the Mazengarb Committee recommended that certain specific changes be made as soon as possible in the legislation relating to proceedings in the Children's Court. It was our duty to examine and report upon each of these suggestions. Our comments are as follow:      _Paragraph (a), page 61_ (creation of a new offence) and _paragraph     (b), page 61_ (the compulsory attendance of parents at a Children's     Court)  Both of these recommendations have been given effect to, and they are provided for in the legislation enacted late in the session of 1954.       _Paragraph (c). page 61_ (power of Court to make orders against the     parents of offending or delinquent children)  We agree with this recommendation, and we understand that the necessary provision has already been written into a new Child Welfare Bill which is in course of preparation.       _Paragraph (d), page 62_ (notification of fact of expulsion of a     child from school)  This proposal has already been given effect to by administrative direction. We feel that legislation on this point will not be necessary.       _Paragraph (e),"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26912"],["title","Report of the Juvenile Delinquency Committee (#2)"],["body","63_ (notification to be given to principal of     a school where child found to be delinquent)  In normal practice the Child Welfare Officer does take a head teacher into his confidence when placing a child in his school district and actively seeks his co-operation. There are odd cases, however, where it may be thought that an individual head teacher should not be given, in the words of the report, all \"the circumstances which led to the delinquency\". This would be a very rare occurrence, but the statutory obligation to tell everything he knew on every occasion might prevent the Child Welfare Officer's taking steps he believed to be in the best interests of all concerned. The best results, we feel, will come from wise administrative action and from a general improvement in the mutual understanding between teachers and Child Welfare Officers.  The Committee felt that when information of this nature was passed on to a Headmaster it should be treated as confidential. We feel strongly that any child should always have a full opportunity of repentance and of re-establishing his character, and where a child showed that definite improvement had been made by him his chances of rehabilitation should not be prejudiced by the fact of his earlier breach.       _Paragraph (f), page 63_ (recommendation that Child Welfare Act be     completely redrafted, etc.)  A complete redraft of the Act is now in course of preparation.  Further comments on paragraph (_f_) above were made by Dr Beeby. They are as follow:      \"We think that the right of appeal from the decisions of the     Children's Courts might be usefully made explicit in the Child     Welfare Act. We agree also that it might be well to provide for the     right of appeal against the Superintendent in certain     circumstances. If the system is to be workable and not brought to a     standstill by a mass of frivolous appeals, it will be necessary to     restrict the right of appeal. If an appeal were to lie every time     the Superintendent shifted a ward of State, the proceedings would     be endless. The only appeal, we think, should be one to have a     child discharged from the care of the Superintendent. Serious     complaints of ill treatment could be aired in this way. We are not     able to suggest, off-hand, exactly what the restrictions should be,     and very full discussions between Child Welfare authorities and     legal authorities would be necessary as a preliminary to effective     legislation on the point.\"  Little, if anything, appeared in the Mazengarb Committee's report to justify us in thinking that a right of appeal of the kind suggested should be provided. The Committee express the hope that a step of this kind should not be taken unless sound reasons were advanced for taking it.   Summary of Proposals for Administrative Action  In its report at pages 67 and 68 the Mazengarb Committee set out a number of proposals which in its view could be met by appropriate action on the part of the Departments mentioned by the Committee. The suggestions made have been considered by the Departments, and we give below a statement of the extent to which the suggestions have been carried into effect.  (_a_) Police Department  It was suggested that the training of policewomen should be considered with a view to deciding the best method of dealing with girls involved in sexual offences.  For the information of Parliament we set out below a few excerpts from a report prepared in the Police Department and sent to us by the Minister of Police. The excerpts are to the following effect:      \"A. _Selection and Training_      \"The minimum educational qualities required are secondary school     (Form 2).      \"Policewomen are not required for clerical or administrative     duties, therefore importance is not attached to ability to perform     office work, typing, or shorthand writing.      \"Recruits chosen with due regard to the foregoing are required to     undergo a course extending over five weeks in the Police School at     Lyttelton. They are coached in subjects relating to statutes,     general police duties, powers and responsibilities of the police,     methods of dealing with various contingencies with which they may     be faced when on duty, relations with and bearing towards the     general public, first-aid, and self-defence. In short, this course     is similar in character to that undergone by male recruits to the     Force.      \"Women recruits are instructed by a pathologist in matters     pertaining to pregnancy, abortion, and the identification of     abortion instruments and drugs. They receive instruction in     maternity hospitals, with special reference to the unmarried     mother. Children's homes, orphanages, and also homes for the aged     are visited and studied with a view to creating a solid background     for the policewomen's work.      \"With the co-operation of the Justice Department women trainees     visit prisons and borstal institutions. They also attend and study     procedure at Magistrates' and Supreme Courts. The workings of the     probation service and Child Welfare Department are also the subject     of visits and study.      \"The training course of five weeks is shorter than that for men,     but women recruits appear to absorb instruction more quickly and     less time is devoted to physical training.      \"B. _Suggestions Relative to Training_      \"It is felt the present training syllabus coupled with the     practical experience which rapidly follows is adequate and that     each policewoman is capable of dealing with the problem of the girl     who has been involved in sexual offences.      \"C. _Further Comments_      \"The Police Department appreciates that if increased numerically     and used more generally policewomen may be a great factor in the     prevention of juvenile delinquency, provided that through their     frequent association with children, both in the company of their     parents and at all grades of school, they become accepted by these     young persons from infancy. The help and guidance of women police     could be sought on grounds similar to those of the school dental     nurse who in her particular sphere is banishing the fear of dental     treatment. It is felt a similar approach to the child's moral     welfare is worthy of consideration.\"  It is a fact that within recent weeks steps have been taken by the Government to establish and operate an improved system of training for recruits for the Police Force. We had no information before us as to the nature of the course or the length of the training period: nor do we know whether a specific course of training will be prescribed for women recruits. We feel, however, that it is a fair assumption that a sounder, more thorough, and more systematic system is about to be put into operation. We feel, too, that with the increased emphasis about to be laid upon training, it can safely be taken for granted that every effort has been, and will continue to be, made to give effect to the suggestions of the Mazengarb Committee.   (_b_) Department of Internal Affairs  It was a recommendation of the Mazengarb Committee that steps should be taken to gazette the outstanding regulations authorized under the relevant film censorship Acts of 1934 and 1953.  A report received from the Department of Internal Affairs contains the information set out below:      \"It could be assumed from the terms of the recommendation that no     regulations are at present in force governing the censorship of     films and film posters. This, however, is not the case, as     appropriate regulations have been in operation for many years. What     is now contemplated is a revision of the existing regulations to     take account of later legislation and to modernise them in the     light of new developments and policies relating to this aspect of     the film industry.      \"In particular, the Cinematograph Films Amendment Act 1953 made     fairly extensive amendments to existing law relating to censorship,     and this in turn has led to the necessity for a completely new     approach to certain policy and machinery aspects of the existing     regulations. For these reasons, and as the film industry is a     licensed and controlled industry, the Committee will understand     that it has not been possible, or even perhaps desirable, to     progress as speedily as would be the case with other regulations     of a more normal character.      \"For the information of your Committee the general position now is     that the regulations are in a final stage of preparation and will     be submitted for Government approval as soon as practicable.\"  We have been advised that quite recently a final draft of the regulations was forwarded to the Film Industry Board for consideration. We were told, too, that conferences are being held between officers of the Department of Internal Affairs on the one hand and members of the Film Industry Board on the other. It is expected that at the conclusion of such conferences an agreed draft will be sent forward to the Government.   (_c_) Broadcasting Service  Two recommendations were before us for our consideration:      (1) \"That the Service ensure that the concept 'Crime must never     pay' is more prominently featured in crime serials; and      (2) \"That a married woman be immediately appointed to the     auditioning panel.\"  In its report to us the Broadcasting Service says:      \"As regards (1), the Service has always attached great importance     to this principle. We can let feature producers know that we attach     greater importance to it than ever; but we cannot make it more     explicit or more prominent in a feature than the producers have.     (After all, no convention in the field of dramatic fiction, in any     medium, is stronger or better understood than the convention which     distinguishes hero and villain and makes the first triumph over the    "]]]
