He is continually getting into some mischief. I have shut him up a close prisoner in the state room, and I am going to keep him there till we land. But it will do no good. It will not be an hour after he gets out before he will be in some new scrape. You know a great deal about boys; I wish you would tell me what to do with him.\"  \"I think, if he was under my charge,\" said Mr. George, very quietly, \"I should _load_ him.\"  \"Load him?\" repeated Mr. Kennedy, inquiringly.  \"Yes,\" said Mr. George, \"I mean I should give him a load to carry.\"  \"I don't understand, exactly,\" said Mr. Kennedy. \"What is your idea?\"  \"My idea is,\" said Mr. George, \"that a growing boy, especially if he is a boy of unusual capacity, is like a steam engine in this respect. A steam engine must always have a load to carry,--that is, something to _employ_ and _absorb_ the force it is capable of exerting,--or else it will break itself to pieces with it. The force _will_ expend itself on something, and if you don't load it with something good, it will employ itself in mischief.  \"Here now is the engine of this ship,\" continued Mr. George. \"Its force is conducted to the paddle wheels, where it has full employment for itself in turning the wheels against the immense resistance of the water, and in carrying the ship along. This work is its _load_. If this load were to be taken off,--for example, if the steamer were to be lifted up out of the water so that the wheels could spin round in the air,--the engine would immediately stave itself to pieces, for want of having any thing else to expend its energies upon.\"  \"Yes,\" said Mr. Kennedy. \"I have no doubt of it.\"  \"Now, I think,\" continued Mr. George, \"that it is in some sense the same with a boy whose mental and physical powers are in good condition. These powers must be employed. They hunger and thirst for employment, and if they don't get it in doing good they will be sure to find it in some kind of mischief.\"  \"Well,\" said Mr. Kennedy, with a sigh, \"there is a great deal in that; but what is to be done? You can't _employ_ such a boy as that. There is nothing he can do. I wish you would take him, and see if you can load him, as you call it. Take him with you on this tour you are going to make in Scotland. I will put money in your hands to cover his expenses, and you may charge any thing you please beyond, for your care of him.\"  \"Perhaps his mother would not like such an arrangement,\" said Mr. George.  \"O, yes,\" replied Mr. Kennedy; \"nothing would please her more.\"  \"And would Waldron like it himself?\" asked Mr. George.  \"I presume so,\" said Mr. Kennedy; \"he likes any thing that is a change.\"  Mr. Kennedy went down to the state room to see Waldron, and ask him what he thought of this plan. Waldron said he should like it very much. So he was at once liberated from his confinement, and transferred to Mr. George's charge.  \"Now, Waldron,\" said Mr. George, when Waldron came to him, \"I shall want some help from you about getting ashore from the boat. Do you think you could go ashore with Rollo as soon as we land, and take a cab and go directly up to the hotel, and engage rooms for us, while I am looking out for the baggage, and getting it ready?\"  \"Yes, sir; yes, sir,\" said Waldron, eagerly. \"I can do that. What hotel shall I go to?\"  \"I don't know,\" said Mr. George. \"I don't know any thing about the hotels in Glasgow. You must find out.\"  \"Well,\" said Waldron, \"only how shall I find out?\"  \"I am sure _I_ don't know,\" said Mr. George. \"I leave it all to you and Rollo. I am busy forming my plans for a tour. You and Rollo can go and talk about it, and see if you can discover any way of finding out the name of one of the best hotels. If you can't, after trying fifteen minutes, come to me, and I will help you.\"  So saying, Mr. George began to study his map again, and Waldron, apparently much pleased with his commission, said, \"Come, Rollo,\" and walked away.     CHAPTER II.  DISTRICTS OF SCOTLAND.   I think that Mr. George was quite right in his idea, that the true remedy for the spirit of restlessness and mischief that Waldron manifested was to employ him, or, as he metaphorically termed it, to _load_ him. And as this volume will, perhaps, fall into the hands of many parents as well as children, I will here remark that a great many good-hearted and excellent boys fall into the same difficulty from precisely the same cause; namely, that they have not adequate employment for their mental and physical powers, which are growing and strengthening every day, and are hungering and thirsting for the means and opportunities of expending their energies.  Parents are seldom aware how fast their children are growing and increasing in strength, both of body and mind. The evidences of this growth, in respect to the limbs and muscles of the body, are, indeed, obvious to the eye; and as the growth advances, we have continual proof of the pleasure which the exercise of these new powers gives to the possessor of them. The active and boisterous plays of boys derive their chief charm from the pleasure they feel in testing and exercising their muscular powers in every way. They are always running, and leaping, and wrestling, and pursuing each other, and pushing each other, and climbing up to high places, and standing on their heads, and walking on the tops of fences, and performing all other possible or conceivable feats, which may give them the pleasure of working, in new and untried ways, their muscular machinery, and feeling its increasing power, and in producing new effects by means of it. They get themselves into continual difficulties and dangers by these things, and cause themselves a great deal of suffering. Still they go on, for the intoxicating delight of using their powers, or, rather, the irresistible instinct which impels them to use them, has greater force with them than all other considerations.  We see all this very plainly in respect to the action of the limbs and organs of the body; for it is palpably evident to our senses, and we feel the necessity of providing safe and proper modes of expending these energies. Since we find, for example, that boys must kick something, we give them a football to kick; which, being a mere ball of wind, may be kicked without doing any harm. And so with almost all the other playthings and sports which are devised for boys, or which they devise for themselves. They are the means, simply, of enabling them to employ their growing powers and expand their energies, without doing any body any harm. We know very well that it is not safe to leave these powers and energies unemployed.  But we are very apt to forget that there are powers and faculties of the mind, equally vigorous, and equally eager to be exercised, that ought also to be provided for. The strength of the will, the power of exercising judgment and discretion, the spirit of enterprise, the love of command, and other such mental impulses, are growing and strengthening every day, in every healthy boy, and they are all clamorous for employment. The instinct that impels them is so strong that they will find employment in some way or other for themselves, unless an occupation is otherwise provided for them. A very large proportion of the acts of mischievousness and wrong which boys commit arise from this cause. Even boys who are bad enough to form a midnight scheme for robbing an orchard, are influenced mainly in perpetrating the deed, not by the pleasure of eating the apples which they expect to obtain by it, but by the pleasure of forming a scheme, of contriving ways and means of surmounting difficulties, of watching against surprises, of braving dangers, of successfully attaining to a desired end over and through a succession of obstacles interposing. This view of the case does not show that such deeds are right; it only shows the true nature of the wrong involved in them, and helps us in discovering and applying the remedy.  At least this was Mr. George's view of the case in respect to Waldron, when he heard how often he was getting into difficulty by his adventurous and restless character. He thought that the remedy was, as he expressed it, to _load_ him; that is, to give to the active and enterprising spirit of his mind something to expend his energies upon. It required great tact and discretion, and great knowledge of the habits and characteristics of boyhood, to enable him to do this; but Mr. George possessed these qualities in a high degree.  But to return to the story.  Mr. George had decided on coming into Scotland from Liverpool by water, because that was the cheapest way of getting into the heart of the country. And here, in order that you may understand the course of Rollo's travels, I must pause to explain the leading geographical features of the country. If you read this explanation carefully, and follow it on the map, you will understand the subsequent narrative much better than you otherwise would do.  You will see, then, by looking at any map, that Scotland is separated from England by two rivers which flow from the interior of the country into the sea--one towards the east, and the other towards the west. The one on the east side is the Tweed. The Tweed forms the frontier between England and Scotland for a considerable distance, and is, therefore, often spoken of as the boundary between the two countries. Indeed, the phrase \"beyond the Tweed\" is often used in England to denote Scotland. In former times, when England and Scotland were independent kingdoms, incessant wars were carried on across this border, and incursions were made by the chieftains from each realm into the territories of the other, and castles were built on many commanding points to defend the ground.

The young man paused before he spoke:  'There is another, but I don't think I can go into it fairly with you.'  'Why not?'  'Well, because after all you know, Stephen, you are only a girl and you can't be expected to know.'  The girl laughed:  'Well, if it's anything about women surely a girl, even of my tender age, must know something more of it, or be able to guess at, than any young man can.  However, say what you think and I'll tell you frankly if I agree--that is if a woman can be just, in such a matter.'  'Shortly the point is this: Can a woman be just to another woman, or to a man for the matter of that, where either her own affection or a fault of the other is concerned?'  'I don't see any reason to the contrary.  Surely pride alone should ensure justice in the former case, and the consciousness of superiority in the other.'  The young man shook his head:  'Pride and the consciousness of superiority!  Are they not much the same thing.  But whether or no, if either of them has to be relied on, I'm afraid the scales of Justice would want regulating, and her sword should be blunted in case its edge should be turned back on herself.  I have an idea that although pride might be a guiding principle with you individually, it would be a failure with the average.  However, as it would be in any case a rule subject to many exceptions I must let it go.'  Harold looked at his watch and rose.  Stephen followed him; transferring her whip into the hand which held up the skirt, she took his arm with her right hand in the pretty way in which a young girl clings to her elders. Together they went out at the lich-gate.  The groom drew over with the horses.  Stephen patted hers and gave her a lump of sugar.  Then putting her foot into Harold's ready hand she sprang lightly into the saddle. Harold swung himself into his saddle with the dexterity of an accomplished rider.  As the two rode up the road, keeping on the shady side under the trees, Stephen said quietly, half to herself, as if the sentence had impressed itself on her mind:  'To be God and able to do things!'  Harold rode on in silence.  The chill of some vague fear was upon him.     CHAPTER I--STEPHEN   Stephen Norman of Normanstand had remained a bachelor until close on middle age, when the fact took hold of him that there was no immediate heir to his great estate.  Whereupon, with his wonted decision, he set about looking for a wife.  He had been a close friend of his next neighbour, Squire Rowly, ever since their college days.  They had, of course, been often in each other's houses, and Rowly's young sister--almost a generation younger than himself, and the sole fruit of his father's second marriage--had been like a little sister to him too.  She had, in the twenty years which had elapsed, grown to be a sweet and beautiful young woman.  In all the past years, with the constant opportunity which friendship gave of close companionship, the feeling never altered.  Squire Norman would have been surprised had he been asked to describe Margaret Rowly and found himself compelled to present the picture of a woman, not a child.  Now, however, when his thoughts went womanward and wifeward, he awoke to the fact that Margaret came within the category of those he sought.  His usual decision ran its course.  Semi-brotherly feeling gave place to a stronger and perhaps more selfish feeling.  Before he even knew it, he was head over ears in love with his pretty neighbour.  Norman was a fine man, stalwart and handsome; his forty years sat so lightly on him that his age never seemed to come into question in a woman's mind.  Margaret had always liked him and trusted him; he was the big brother who had no duty in the way of scolding to do.  His presence had always been a gladness; and the sex of the girl, first unconsciously then consciously, answered to the man's overtures, and her consent was soon obtained.  When in the fulness of time it was known that an heir was expected, Squire Norman took for granted that the child would be a boy, and held the idea so tenaciously that his wife, who loved him deeply, gave up warning and remonstrance after she had once tried to caution him against too fond a hope.  She saw how bitterly he would be disappointed in case it should prove to be a girl.  He was, however, so fixed on the point that she determined to say no more.  After all, it might be a boy; the chances were equal.  The Squire would not listen to any one else at all; so as the time went on his idea was more firmly fixed than ever.  His arrangements were made on the base that he would have a son.  The name was of course decided.  Stephen had been the name of all the Squires of Normanstand for ages--as far back as the records went; and Stephen the new heir of course would be.  Like all middle-aged men with young wives he was supremely anxious as the time drew near.  In his anxiety for his wife his belief in the son became passive rather than active.  Indeed, the idea of a son was so deeply fixed in his mind that it was not disturbed even by his anxiety for the young wife he idolised.  When instead of a son a daughter was born, the Doctor and the nurse, who knew his views on the subject, held back from the mother for a little the knowledge of the sex.  Dame Norman was so weak that the Doctor feared lest anxiety as to how her husband would bear the disappointment, might militate against her.  Therefore the Doctor sought the Squire in his study, and went resolutely at his task.  'Well, Squire, I congratulate you on the birth of your child!'  Norman was of course struck with the use of the word 'child'; but the cause of his anxiety was manifested by his first question:  'How is she, Doctor?  Is she safe?'  The child was after all of secondary importance!  The Doctor breathed more freely; the question had lightened his task.  There was, therefore, more assurance in his voice as he answered:  'She is safely through the worst of her trouble, but I am greatly anxious yet.  She is very weak.  I fear anything that might upset her.'  The Squire's voice came quick and strong:  'There must be no upset!  And now tell me about my son?'  He spoke the last word half with pride, half bashfully.  'Your son is a daughter!'  There was silence for so long that the Doctor began to be anxious.  Squire Norman sat quite still; his right hand resting on the writing-table before him became clenched so hard that the knuckles looked white and the veins red.  After a long slow breath he spoke:  'She, my daughter, is well?'  The Doctor answered with cheerful alacrity:  'Splendid!--I never saw a finer child in my life.  She will be a comfort and an honour to you!'  The Squire spoke again:  'What does her mother think?  I suppose she's very proud of her?'  'She does not know yet that it is a girl.  I thought it better not to let her know till I had told you.'  'Why?'  'Because--because--Norman, old friend, you know why!  Because you had set your heart on a son; and I know how it would grieve that sweet young wife and mother to feel your disappointment.  I want your lips to be the first to tell her; so that on may assure her of your happiness in that a daughter has been born to you.'  The Squire put out his great hand and laid it on the other's shoulder. There was almost a break in his voice as he said:  'Thank you, my old friend, my true friend, for your thought.  When may I see her?'  'By right, not yet.  But, as knowing your views, she may fret herself till she knows, I think you had better come at once.'  All Norman's love and strength combined for his task.  As he leant over and kissed his young wife there was real fervour in his voice as he said:  'Where is my dear daughter that you may place her in my arms?'  For an instant there came a chill to the mother's heart that her hopes had been so far disappointed; but then came the reaction of her joy that her husband, her baby's father, was pleased.  There was a heavenly dawn of red on her pale face as she drew her husband's head down and kissed him.  'Oh, my dear,' she said, 'I am so happy that you are pleased!'  The nurse took the mother's hand gently and held it to the baby as she laid it in the father's arms.  He held the mother's hand as he kissed the baby's brow.  The Doctor touched him gently on the arm and beckoned him away.  He went with careful footsteps, looking behind as he went.  After dinner he talked with the Doctor on various matters; but presently he asked:  'I suppose, Doctor, it is no sort of rule that the first child regulates the sex of a family?'  'No, of course not.  Otherwise how should we see boys and girls mixed in one family, as is nearly always the case.  But, my friend,' he went on, 'you must not build hopes so far away.  I have to tell you that your wife is far from strong.  Even now she is not so well as I could wish, and there yet may be change.'  The Squire leaped impetuously to his feet as he spoke quickly:  'Then why are we waiting here?  Can nothing be done?  Let us have the best help, the best advice in the world.'  The Doctor raised his hand.  'Nothing can be done as yet.  I have only fear.'  'Then let us be ready in case your fears should be justified!  Who are the best men in London to help in such a case?'  The Doctor mentioned two names; and within a few minutes a mounted messenger was galloping to Norcester, the nearest telegraph centre.  The messenger was to arrange for a special train if necessary.  Shortly afterwards the Doctor went again to see his patient.  After a long absence he came back, pale and agitated.  Norman felt his heart sink when he saw him; a groan broke from him as the Doctor spoke:  'She is much worse!  I am in great fear that she may pass away before the morning!'  The Squire's strong voice was clouded, with a hoarse veil as he asked:  'May I see her?'  'Not yet; at present she is sleeping.  She may wake strengthened; in which case you may see her.  But if not--'  'If not?'--the voice"]]]
