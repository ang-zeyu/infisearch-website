And in the innumerable passages in which Jahveh is said to be jealous of other gods, to be angry, to be appeased, and to repent; in which he is represented as casting off Saul because the king does not quite literally execute a command of the most ruthless severity; or as smiting Uzzah to death because the unfortunate man thoughtlessly, but naturally enough, put out his hand to stay the ark from falling--can any one deny that the old Israelites conceived Jahveh not only in the image of a man, but in that of a changeable, irritable, and, occasionally, violent man? There appears to me, then, to be no reason to doubt that the notion of likeness to man, which was indubitably held of the ghost Elohim, was carried out consistently throughout the whole series of Elohim, and that Jahveh-Elohim was thought of as a being of the same substantially human nature as the rest, only immeasurably more powerful for good and for evil.  The absence of any real distinction between the Elohim of different ranks is further clearly illustrated by the corresponding absence of any sharp delimitation between the various kinds of people who serve as the media of communication between them and men. The agents through whom the lower Elohim are consulted are called necromancers, wizards, and diviners, and are looked down upon by the prophets and priests of the higher Elohim; but the \"seer\" [7] connects the two, and they are all alike in their essential characters of media. The wise woman of Endor was believed by others, and, I have little doubt, believed herself, to be able to \"bring up\" whom she would from Sheol, and to be inspired, whether in virtue of actual possession by the evoked Elohim, or otherwise, with a knowledge of hidden things, I am unable to see that Saul's servant took any really different view of Samuel's powers, though he may have believed that he obtained them by the grace of the higher Elohim. For when Saul fails to find his father's asses, his servant says to him--     Behold, there is in this city a man of Elohim, and he is a man    that is held in honour; all that he saith cometh surely to pass;    now let us go thither; peradventure, he can tell us concerning    our journey whereon we go. Then said Saul to his servant, But    behold if we go, what shall we bring the man? for the bread is    spent in our vessels and there is not a present to bring to the    man of Elohim. What have we? And the servant answered Saul again    and said, Behold I have in my hand the fourth part of a shekel    of silver: that will I give to the man of Elohim to tell us our    way. (Beforetime in Israel when a man went to inquire of Elohim,    then he said, Come and let us go to the Seer: for he that is now    called a Prophet was beforetime called a Seer [8])    (1 Sam. ix. 6-10).  In fact, when, shortly afterwards, Saul accidentally meets Samuel, he says, \"Tell me, I pray thee, where the Seer's house is.\" Samuel answers, \"I am the Seer.\" Immediately afterwards Samuel informs Saul that the asses are found, though how he obtained his knowledge of the fact is not stated. It will be observed that Samuel is not spoken of here as, in any special sense, a seer or prophet of Jahveh, but as a \"man of Elohim\"--that is to say, a seer having access to the \"spiritual powers,\" just as the wise woman of Endor might have been said to be a \"woman of Elohim\"--and the narrator's or editor's explanatory note seems to indicate that \"Prophet\" is merely a name, introduced later than the time of Samuel, for a superior kind of \"Seer,\" or \"man of Elohim.\" [9]  Another very instructive passage shows that Samuel was not only considered to be diviner, seer, and prophet in one, but that he was also, to all intents and purposes, priest of Jahveh--though, according to his biographer, he was not a member of the tribe of Levi. At the outset of their acquaintance, Samuel says to Saul, \"Go up before me into the high place,\" where, as the young maidens of the city had just before told Saul, the Seer was going, \"for the people will not eat till he come, because he doth bless the sacrifice\" (1 Sam. x. 12). The use of the word \"bless\" here--as if Samuel were not going to sacrifice, but only to offer a blessing or thanksgiving--is curious. But that Samuel really acted as priest seems plain from what follows. For he not only asks Saul to share in the customary sacrificial feast, but he disposes in Saul's favour of that portion of the victim which the Levitical legislation, doubtless embodying old customs, recognises as the priest's special property. [10]  Although particular persons adopted the profession of media between men and Elohim, there was no limitation of the power, in the view of ancient Israel, to any special class of the population. Saul inquires of Jahveh and builds him altars on his own account; and in the very remarkable story told in the fourteenth chapter of the first book of Samuel (v. 37-46), Saul appears to conduct the whole process of divination, although he has a priest at his elbow. David seems to do the same.  Moreover, Elohim constantly appear in dreams--which in old Israel did not mean that, as we should say, the subject of the appearance \"dreamed he saw the spirit\"; but that he veritably saw the Elohim which, as a soul, visited his soul while his body was asleep. And, in the course of the history of Israel Jahveh himself thus appears to all sorts of persons, non-Israelites as well as Israelites. Again, the Elohim possess, or inspire, people against their will, as in the case of Saul and Saul's messengers, and then these people prophesy--that is to say, \"rave\"--and exhibit the ungoverned gestures attributed by a later age to possession by malignant spirits. Apart from other evidence to be adduced by and by, the history of ancient demonology and of modern revivalism does not permit me to doubt that the accounts of these phenomena given in the history of Saul may be perfectly historical.  In the ritual practices, of which evidence is to be found in the books of Judges and Samuel, the chief part is played by sacrifices, usually burnt offerings. Whenever the aid of the Elohim of Israel is sought, or thanks are considered due to him, an altar is built, and oxen, sheep, and goats are slaughtered and offered up. Sometimes the entire victim is burnt as a holocaust; more frequently only certain parts, notably the fat about the kidneys, are burnt on the altar. The rest is properly cooked; and, after the reservation of a part for the priest, is made the foundation of a joyous banquet, in which the sacrificer, his family, and such guests as he thinks fit to invite, participate. [11] Elohim was supposed to share in the feast, and it has been already shown that that which was set apart on the altar, or consumed by fire, was spoken of as the food of Elohim, who was thought to be influenced by the costliness, or by the pleasant smell, of the sacrifice in favour of the sacrificer.  All this bears out the view that, in the mind of the old Israelite, there was no difference, save one of degree, between one Elohim and another. It is true that there is but little direct evidence to show that the old Israelites shared the widespread belief of their own, and indeed of all times, that the spirits of the dead not only continue to exist, but are capable of a ghostly kind of feeding and are grateful for such aliment as can be assimilated by their attenuated substance, and even for clothes, ornaments, and weapons. [12] That they were familiar with this doctrine in the time of the captivity is suggested by the well-known reference of Ezekiel (xxxii. 27) to the \"mighty that are fallen of the uncircumcised, which are gone down to [Sheol] hell with their weapons of war, and have laid their swords under their heads.\" Perhaps there is a still earlier allusion in the \"giving of food for the dead\" spoken of in Deuteronomy (xxvi. 14). [13]  It must be remembered that the literature of the old Israelites, as it lies before us, has been subjected to the revisal of strictly monotheistic editors, violently opposed to all kinds of idolatry, who are not likely to have selected from the materials at their disposal any obvious evidence, either of the practice under discussion, or of that ancestor-worship which is so closely related to it, for preservation in the permanent records of their people.  The mysterious objects known as _Teraphim,_ which are occasionally mentioned in Judges, Samuel, and elsewhere, however, can hardly be interpreted otherwise than as indications of the existence both of ancestor-worship and of image-worship in old Israel. The teraphim were certainly images of family gods, and, as such, in all probability represented deceased ancestors. Laban indignantly demands of his son-in-law, \"Wherefore hast thou stolen my Elohim?\" which Rachel, who must be assumed to have worshipped Jacob's God, Jahveh, had carried off, obviously because she, like her father, believed in their divinity. It is not suggested that Jacob was in any way scandalised by the idolatrous practices of his favourite wife, whatever he may have thought of her honesty when the truth came to light; for the teraphim seem to have remained in his camp, at least until he \"hid\" his strange gods \"under the oak that was by Shechem\" (Gen. xxxv. 4). And indeed it is open to question if he got rid of them then, for the subsequent history of Israel renders it more than doubtful whether the teraphim were regarded as \"strange gods\" even as late as the eighth century B.C.  The writer of the books of Samuel takes it quite as a matter of course that Michal, daughter of one royal Jahveh worshipper and wife of the servant of Jahveh _par excellence,_ the pious David, should have her teraphim handy, in her and David's chamber, when she dresses them up in their bed into a simulation of her husband, for the purpose of deceiving her father's messengers. Even one of the early prophets, Hosea, when he threatens that the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26346"],["title","Our Bird Comrades (#1)"],["body","tists--a feature that is invaluable in the work of identification. They possess a further advantage in not being too large to be carried with you in your excursions afield, enabling you to name each feathered stranger on the spot.  Should you desire a single volume that will help you to identify any bird you may meet on our continent, I would urge you to secure the latest revised edition of Dr. Elliott Coues's \"Key to North American Birds.\"  It is fully illustrated, thoroughly scientific and up-to-date in the matter of classification, and yet not too technical for practical use.  This book is too bulky to be carried with you to the haunts of the birds, but it may be used in this way: Note carefully the markings and other peculiarities of each new bird you meet; then, as soon as you return home, while all the circumstances are fresh in your memory, consult your \"key\" and make sure, if possible, of the identity of all your \"finds.\"  Mr. Robert Ridgway, one of the foremost ornithologists of our country, is now preparing a great work which is worthy of the highest praise. It is entitled \"The Birds of North and Middle America,\" and is the most comprehensive work yet undertaken relative to the avifauna of the entire North American Continent, giving a large amount of scientific data respecting all the species.  After its completion it will enable the student to identify every bird known to science from the Isthmus of Panama to the far North and from the Atlantic to the Pacific.  At this writing two volumes have been issued.  They are published under government auspices by the United States National Museum at Washington, D. C., and may be procured perhaps without cost by writing to the secretary of the Smithsonian Institution.  Of this the writer cannot be absolutely sure, as the supply of printed copies may be limited.  Nothing more need be said about bird manuals, save to warn you against spending your money for books which describe only a part of the avifauna of a given region and yet are advertised as serviceable for the identification of all birds.  Unless you have plenty of money to spend, when you buy a manual buy one that is scientifically accurate and complete.  Nothing is more trying to the student of birds, whether tyro or expert, than to encounter a new bird and then fail to find it described or even mentioned in the book that has been foisted upon him as a manual.  In saying this I do not mean to discourage the purchase of the charming popular books written in a literary vein and describing personal observations on bird life, such as the works of John Burroughs, Bradford Torrey, Olive Thorne Miller, and many others. These books, however, are not advertised as handbooks, and thus no one is deceived in buying them.  Even with the best manual in hand, you must not expect to be able to identify every new bird at the first attempt, for some species are either exceedingly shy or obscurely marked, or probably both, while quite a number are so much alike in markings and habits that it is hard to distinguish them from one another.  A few birds remained enigmas to me for a number of years, in spite of the help of the field glass.  At intervals for several months you will often catch provoking glimpses of some nymph-like bird before you succeed in determining its true place in the avian system.  But patience and persistence will some day overcome the most stubborn difficulties.  Since the foregoing references to leading bird manuals were written, a new work, which is unique in plan, has been published.  I refer to the book entitled \"Color Key to North American Birds\"; text by Frank M. Chapman, pictures by Chester A. Reed.  The range of the volume is from the Atlantic to the Pacific ocean and from the southern boundary of the United States to the far north.  It contains a brief description of every species and sub-species within the limits named; a key to all the Orders and Families, with the common and scientific names of all the birds; an introduction to every chief division; and last, and highly important, colored pictures of all the species and many of the geographical varieties.  What more can the bird student desire for purposes of identification?  While the other manuals give fuller descriptions of habits, songs, etc., and need not, therefore, be superseded by this volume, yet frankness forces us to say that if the student, and especially the beginner, cannot afford to buy more than one bird book, the Chapman-Reed \"Color Key\" is the one to get.  It is of a convenient size for carrying afield, so that a feathered stranger can be identified on the spot.  It can be used anywhere in the United States, in British America, and Alaska.  Think of that, fellow bird-lovers!  A good field glass is indispensable to successful bird study, especially if you desire to name all the birds without killing any, as I hope you do.  Perhaps the older ornithologists, like Audubon and Wilson, did not use helps of this kind, but they used guns, and consequently had to study dead birds, while you and I want to study living ones.  Their killing of birds was, indeed, necessary, for purposes of scientific classification; but now that such classifying has, for the most part, been attained, the gun has largely gone out of vogue, and the glass has taken its place.  Let your alliterative motto be: _With the glass, not the gun_.  I would advise you not to buy a flashily colored glass, for it will dazzle your eyes on sunshiny days.  Be sure to get one that is easily focused, as you must be quick in studying such shy creatures as the birds.  At first the glass may strain and tire your eyes, but that difficulty will pass in a short time.  Expertness will soon be won in the use of a binocular, so that you will be able, almost instantly, to get the desired object within its field, even though the object be quite tiny.  An opera glass is a great deal better than no glass at all; a field glass is better still, and a Bausch & Lomb binocular of six to eight magnifying power is the best of all; being almost equal to having the bird in hand.  The observer must lose as little time as possible in sighting a shy bird, or it may escape him altogether.  A book-bag or haversack, strapped around your shoulders, will also be a convenience.  In it you can stow your bird manual, and a luncheon in case you expect to spend the whole day in the open, for a hungry rambler is not likely to be an acute observer.  A notebook and a lead pencil, carried in handy pockets, should not be forgotten.  Donning an old suit of clothes, you can roam where you will, threading your way through brier and bush, wading the bog or the shallow stream, dropping upon your knees, even flinging yourself upon the ground, to spy upon a wary bird flitting about in the copse.  In almost all kinds of weather I wear rubber boots in my excursions to the haunts of the birds.  The observer can never tell when he may have to wade a stream or tramp through a boggy marsh.  In wet and cold weather the need of rubber boots can be seen readily, but even in dry and warm weather they have one decided advantage--they do not become slippery on the soles as one tramps through the leaf-strewn woods or the grassy fields.  Every pedestrian knows that sole-leather is apt to become as smooth as glass, making it difficult to retain one's footing. On the other hand, rubber seems to cling to the ground, no matter how much it is worn.  The only objection to rubbers is that they are uncomfortably warm in hot weather; but that difficulty can be overcome by frequently plunging into a cool stream and standing there for several minutes.  Let me caution you, however, not to purchase a _heavy_ pair of rubber boots.  Insist on having a light pair or none at all.  A good pair of rubber boots are a real luxury, for with them you may tramp about in all kinds of damp and boggy places without fear of wetting your feet, though it goes without saying that you must be careful not to wade in over the tops of your footgear.  Of great assistance to the pedestrian is a light cane.  In climbing Pikes Peak one evening after dark, I doubt whether I should have been able to gain the summit had it not been for my tough little wild-cherry cane, upon which I could lean when almost exhausted, which supported my faltering steps, and which happily never grew weary.  Two years later it helped me to scale a number of snow-capped mountains, among them Grays Peak and Peak Number Eight of the Ten Mile Range.  Indeed, my little cane was of so much service to me that I came to look upon it as a personal friend that cared almost as much for me as I did for it.  It pushed aside thorny bushes and nettlesome weeds when I was looking for nests, thus saving my hands many a painful wound.  And more than one serpent, including the rattlesnake, has had his head crushed or his spine broken by sturdy blows from my little wild-cherry cane.  I should add that it had a hooked handle, so that I could hang it on the strap of my haversack when I needed both hands.  In the beginning of your observations you will find the work of identifying the birds a rare and exciting pleasure; then, after you have named all the species in your neighborhood, it will be no less delightful to study their interesting ways, or to extend your researches to other fields.  And if at any time you observe some odd bits of bird behavior which you think will be news to the many bird lovers the world over, why should you not report them to one of the bird magazines, so that others may share the pleasures of your discoveries?  An admirer of feathered folk should not be selfish; indeed, I do not see how he can be.  It simply remains to be said that this volume is an illustration of the method of bird study just indicated.  In the first place, I shall show, in a few chapters, how the student goes about his work of identifying species and making new bird friends; then will follow a number of monographs"]]]
