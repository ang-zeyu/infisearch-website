And that--since Earth government's made it illegal to possess Geest artifacts--_might_ create attention.\"  Jackson fingered his chin thoughtfully, said, \"Of course, there's always a way to make sure Beulah didn't kick up a fuss.\"  Phil hesitated. \"Dr. Fitzsimmons gives Beulah another three months at the most,\" he said. \"If she can stay out of the hospital for even the next eight weeks, he'll consider it some kind of miracle. That should be early enough to take care of the gun.\"  \"It should be,\" Jackson said. \"However, if there does happen to be an investigation before that time--\"  Phil looked at him, said evenly, \"We'd do whatever was necessary. It wouldn't be very agreeable, but my neck's out just as far as yours.\"  Celia laughed. \"That's the reason we can all feel pretty safe,\" she observed. \"Every last one of us is completely selfish--and there's no more dependable kind of person than that.\"  Jackson flushed a little, glanced at Phil, smiled. Phil shrugged. Major Wayne Jackson, native son, Fort Roye's second in command, was scheduled for the number one spot and a string of promotions via the transfer of the current commander, Colonel Thayer. Their Earthside associates would arrange for that as soon as the decision to turn Fort Roye into a Class A military base was reached. Phil himself could get by with the guaranteed retention of the CLU presidency, and a membership moving up year by year to the half million mark and beyond--he could get by very, very comfortably, in fact. While Celia Adams would develop a discreetly firm hold on every upcoming minor racket, facilitated by iron-clad protection and an enforced lack of all competitors.  \"We're all thinking of Roye's future, Celia,\" Phil said amiably, \"each in his own way. And the future looks pretty bright. In fact, the only possible stumbling block I can still see is right here on Roye, and it's Honest Silas Thayer. If our colonel covers up the Geest gun find tomorrow--\"  Jackson grinned, shook his head. \"Leave that to me, my boy--and to our very distinguished visitors from Earth. Commissioner Sanford has arranged to be in Thayer's company on Territorial Office business all day tomorrow. Science Officer Vaughn is dizzy with delight because Ronald Black and most of the newsgathering troop will inspect his diggings in the ruins in the morning, with the promise of giving his theories about the vanished natives of Roye a nice spread on Earth. Black will happen to ask me to accompany the party. Between Black and Sanford--and myself--Colonel Silas Thayer won't have a chance to suppress the discovery of a Geest gun on Roye until the military has had a chance to look into it fully. And the only one he can possibly blame for that will be Science Officer Norm Vaughn--for whom, I'll admit, I feel just a little bit sorry!\"         *       *       *       *       *  First Lieutenant Norman Vaughn was an intense and frustrated young man whose unusually thick contact lenses and wide mouth gave him some resemblance to a melancholy frog. He suspected, correctly, that a good Science Officer would not have been transferred from Earth to Roye which was a planet deficient in scientific problems of any magnitude, and where requisitions for research purposes were infrequently and grudgingly granted.  The great spiraled ruin on the peninsula of Fort Roye had been Vaughn's one solace. Several similar deserted structures were known to be on the planet, but this was by far in the best condition and no doubt the most recently built. To him, if to no one else, it became clear that the construction had been carried out with conscious plan and purpose, and he gradually amassed great piles of notes to back up his theory that the vanished builders were of near-human intelligence. Unfortunately, their bodies appeared to have lacked hard and durable parts, since nothing that could be construed as their remains was found; and what Lieutenant Vaughn regarded as undeniable artifacts, on the level of very early Man's work, looked to others like chance shards and lumps of the tough, shell-like material of which the ruins were composed.  Therefore, while Vaughn was--as Jackson had pointed out--really dizzy with delight when Ronald Black, that giant of Earth's news media, first indicated an interest in the ruins and his theories about them, this feeling soon became mixed with acute anxiety. For such a chance surely would not come again if the visitors remained unconvinced by what he showed them, and what--actually--did he have to show? In the morning, when the party set out, Vaughn was in a noticeably nervous frame of mind.  Two hours later, he burst into the anteroom of the base commander's office in Fort Roye, where the warrant on duty almost failed to recognize him. Lieutenant Vaughn's eyes glittered through their thick lenses; his face was red and he was grinning from ear to ear. He pounded past the startled warrant, pulled open the door to the inner office where Colonel Thayer sat with the visiting Territorial Commissioner, and plunged inside.  \"Sir,\" the warrant heard him quaver breathlessly, \"I have the proof--the undeniable proof! They _were_ intelligent beings. They did _not_ die of disease. They were exterminated in war! They were ... but see for yourself!\" There was a thud as he dropped something on the polished table top between the commissioner and Colonel Thayer. \"_That_ was dug up just now--among their own artifacts!\"  Silas Thayer was on his feet, sucking in his breath for the blast that would hurl his blundering Science Officer back out of the office. What halted him was an odd, choked exclamation from Commissioner Sanford. The colonel's gaze flicked over to the visitor, then followed Sanford's stare to the object on the table.  For an instant, Colonel Thayer froze.  Vaughn was bubbling on. \"And, sir, I ...\"  \"Shut up!\" Thayer snapped. He continued immediately, \"You say this was found in the diggings in the ruins?\"  [Illustration]  \"Yes, sir--just now! It's ...\"  Lieutenant Vaughn checked himself under the colonel's stare, some dawning comprehension of the enormous irregularities he'd committed showing in his flushed face. He licked his lips uncertainly.  \"You will excuse me for a moment, sir,\" Thayer said to Commissioner Sanford. He picked the Geest gun up gingerly by its unmistakably curved shaft, took it over to the office safe, laid it inside and relocked the safe. He then left the office.         *       *       *  In an adjoining room, Thayer rapped out Major Wayne Jackson's code number on a communicator. He heard a faint click as Jackson's wrist speaker switched on, and said quickly, \"Wayne, are you in a position to speak?\"  \"I am at the moment,\" Jackson's voice replied cautiously.  Colonel Thayer said, \"Norm Vaughn just crashed in here with something he claims was found in the diggings. Sanford saw it, and obviously recognized it. We might be able to keep him quiet. But now some questions. Was that item actually dug up just now?\"  \"Apparently it was,\" Jackson said. \"I didn't see it happen--I was talking to Black at the moment. But there are over a dozen witnesses who claim they did see it happen, including five or six of the news agency men.\"  \"And they knew what it was?\"  \"Enough of them did.\"  Thayer cursed softly. \"No chance that one of them pitched the thing into the diggings for an Earthside sensation?\"  \"I'm afraid not,\" Jackson said. \"It was lying in the sifter after most of the sand and dust had been blown away.\"  \"Why didn't you call me at once?\"  \"I've been holding down something like a mutiny here, Silas. Vaughn got away before I could stop him, but I grounded the other aircars till you could decide what to do. Our visitors don't like that. Neither do they like the fact that I've put a guard over the section where the find was made, and haven't let them talk to Norm's work crew.  \"Ronald Black and his staff have been fairly reasonable, but there's been considerable mention of military highhandedness made by the others. This is the first moment I've been free.\"  \"You did the right thing,\" Thayer said, \"but I doubt it will help much now. Can you get hold of Ronald Black?\"  \"Yes, he's over there ...\"  \"Colonel Thayer?\" another voice inquired pleasantly a few seconds later.  \"Mr. Black,\" the colonel said carefully, \"what occurred in the diggings a short while ago may turn out to be a matter of great importance.\"  \"That's quite obvious, sir.\"  \"And that being the case,\" the colonel went on, \"do you believe it would be possible to obtain a gentleman's agreement from all witnesses to make no mention of this apparent discovery until the information is released through the proper channels? I'm asking for your opinion.\"  \"Colonel Thayer,\" Ronald Black's voice said, still pleasantly, \"my opinion is that the only way you could keep the matter quiet is to arrest every civilian present, including myself, and hold us incommunicado. You have your duty, and we have ours. Ours does not include withholding information from the public which may signal the greatest shift in the conduct of the Geest War in the past two decades.\"  \"I understand,\" Thayer said. He was silent for some seconds, and perhaps he, too, was gazing during that time at a Fort Roye of the future--a Class A military base under his command, with Earth's great war vessels lined up along the length of the peninsula.  \"Mr. Black,\" he said, \"please be so good as to give your colleagues this word from me. I shall make the most thorough possible investigation of what has occurred and forward a prompt report, along with any material evidence obtained, to my superiors on Earth. None of you will receive any other statement from me or from anyone under my command. An attempt to obtain such a statement will, in fact, result in the arrest of the person or persons involved. Is that clear?\"  \"Quite clear, Colonel Thayer,\" Ronald"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24560"],["title","The Jingle Book (#1)"],["body","scatterbrained, shatterbrained lady so grand,  Her Royal Skyhighness of Nonsense Land!      Opulent Ollie    One Saturday opulent Ollie  Thought he'd go for a ride on the trolley;    But his pennies were few,--    He only had two,--  So he went and made mud-pies with Polly.   [Illustration]      The Two Bears    Prince Curlilocks remarked one day    To Princess Dimplecheek,  \"I haven't had a real good play    For more than 'most a week.\"   Said Princess Dimplecheek, \"My dear,    Your majesty forgets--  This morning we played grenadier    With grandpa's epaulets.   \"And yesterday we sailed to Spain--    We both were pirates bold,  And braved the wild and raging main    To seek for hidden gold.\"   \"True,\" said the prince; \"I mind me well--    Right hardily we fought,  And stormed a massive citadel    To gain the prize we sought.   \"But if your ladyship agrees,    Methinks we'll go upstairs  And build a waste of arctic seas,    And we'll be polar bears.\"   \"Yes, if you'll promise not to bite,\"    Fair Dimplecheek replied,  Already half-way up the flight,    His highness by her side.   \"Princess, on that far window-seat,    Go, sit thee down and wait,  While I ask nursie for a sheet,    Or maybe six or eight.\"   A pile of sheets his highness brought.    \"Dear princess, pray take these;  Although our path with danger's fraught,    We'll reach the polar seas.\"   Two furry rugs his lordship bore,    Two pairs of mittens white;  He threw them on the nursery floor    And shouted with delight.   He spread those sheets--the funny boy--    O'er table, floor, and chair.  \"Princess,\" said he, \"don't you enjoy    This frosty, bracing air?   \"These snowy sheets are fields of ice,    This is an iceberg grim.\"  \"Yes, dear, I think it's very nice,\"    She said, and smiled at him.   And then they donned the rugs of fur,    The mittens, too, they wore;  And Curlilocks remarked to her,    \"Now you must roar and roar.\"   [Illustration]   Dimplecheek looked out from the cowl    Formed by her furry rug.  \"I'm 'fraid of bears that only growl--    I like the kind that hug.\"      The Very Merry Voyage of the Macaroni Man    This figure here before you is a Macaroni Man,  Who is built, as you may notice, on a most ingenious plan.  His skeleton, I beg to state, is made of hairpins three,  Which are bent and curved and twisted to a marvellous degree.  His coat-sleeves and his trouser-legs, his head and eke his waist  Are made of superfine imported macaroni paste.  And if you care to listen, you may hear the thrilling tale  Of the merry Macaroni Man's extraordinary sail.  One sunny day he started for a voyage in his yacht,  His anxious mother called to him, and said, \"You'd better not!  Although the sun is shining bright, I fear that it may rain;  And don't you think, my darling boy, you'd better take the train?\"  \"Oh, no,\" said he, \"no clouds I see,--the sky is blue and clear,  I will return in time for tea--good-by, my mother  dear.\"   [Illustration]   Full merrily he started off, the day was fine and fair,  And to his great delight he found no dampness in the air.  You know if he gets wet, a Macaroni Man is spoiled,  And if he stands too near the steam, of course he may get boiled.  But our hero used precautions,--carefully he shunned the spray,--  And when the steam blew toward him, he just steered the other way.  Now, as the breeze was from the land, his course lay out to sea;  He sailed so far that he felt sure he would be late for tea.  He sailed, and sailed, and sailed, and sailed,--                he feared the dew would fall--  He tried to turn,--but oh, that steam! it would not do at all!   [Illustration]   A single puff blew toward him, and it nearly cooked his face!  The mournful Macaroni Man felt sadly out of place.  But a happy thought occurred to him, \"Ha, ha,--ho, ho!\" said he,--  \"I'll just sail on around the world,--and then, it seems to me,  I'll reach my home (according to a careful estimate)  In time for tea, although I'll be perhaps a trifle late.\"  Then merrily his gallant ship sped o'er the bounding main,  Quickly he crossed the ocean wide, he flew by France and Spain;  Covered the Mediterranean, spanned the Suez Canal,--  \"I'll reach my home to-night,\" he thought, \"oh, yes, I'm sure I shall.\"  He skimmed the Red Sea like a bird,--the Indian Ocean crossed  (But once, in Oceanica, he feared that he was lost).   [Illustration]   He passed Australia on the fly,--cut over Capricorn,  And as the sunset gun he heard, he swung around Cape Horn.  Still at full speed, he sailed due north, he rounded Cape St. Roque,  Crossed the equator, and found out the Gulf Stream was no joke.  He coasted by the seaboard States. Hurrah! all danger past,  Quickly he sailed the last few miles and reached his home at last;  His mother welcomed him, and said, \"I'm glad there was no shower;  But hurry in, my bonny boy, I've waited tea an hour.\"   [Illustration]      The 4.04 Train    \"There's a train at 4.04,\" said Miss Jenny;  \"Four tickets I'll take. Have you any?\"      Said the man at the door:      \"Not four for 4.04,  For four for 4.04 is too many.\"      [Illustration]   A Valuable Gift    Old Father Time, one day  In his study, so they say,    Was indulging in a surreptitious nap,  When from his drowsy dreams  He was wakened, as it seems,    By a timid but persistent little rap.   He yawned and rubbed his eyes  In indolent surprise,    Then slowly he arose from where he sat;  He opened wide his door,  And nearly tumbled o'er    The figure that stood waiting on the mat.   A tiny little dog,  With excitement all agog,    And angry eyes that seemed to flash and glower.  His manner was polite,  But he said, \"I claim my right!    And I've called, sir, to demand of you my hour.\"   \"Your what?\" the old man said,  As he shook his puzzled head;    And the pertinacious puppy spoke with force:  \"Well, sir, they often say,  'Every dog must have his day,'    So a puppy ought to have an hour, of course!\"   [Illustration]   The old man shook with glee,  But he said obligingly,    \"The dog days are all gone, I grieve to say;  But since you've come so far,  And so mannerly you are,    I'll give you just an hour--to get away.\"      [Illustration]   The Grandiloquent Goat    A very grandiloquent Goat  Sat down to a gay table d'hôte;    He ate all the corks,    The knives and the forks,  Remarking: \"On these things I dote.\"   Then, before his repast he began,  While pausing the menu to scan,    He said: \"Corn, if you please,    And tomatoes and pease,  I'd like to have served in the can.\"      How the Cat was Belled    A fable told by La Fontaine,    Two centuries or more ago,  Describes some rats who would arraign    A cat, their direst foe,  Who killed so many rats    And caused the deepest woe,  This Catiline of cats.   The poor rats were at their wits' end  Their homes and families to defend;    And as a last resort    They took the case to court.   It seems they called a caucus wise  Of rats of every age and size,    And then their dean,    With sapient mien,  A very Solon of a rat,  Said it was best to bell the cat.   The quaint old tale goes on to tell  How this plan would have worked quite well,    But, somehow, flaws    Appeared, because  No one would hang the bell.   Though there the ancient fable ends,  Later report the tale extends,    No longer is the truth withheld;      Developments appear,      And so you have it here.        For the first time        Set down in rhyme    Just how that cat was belled.   The council, as 'twas getting late,  Was just about to separate,    When suddenly a rat arose    Who said he could a plan propose      Which would, he thought, succeed      And meet their urgent need.   Now as this rat was very small,  And had no dignity at all,    Although his plan was well advised,    We really need not be surprised  That all the rats of riper years  Expressed the gravest doubts and fears;      Till suddenly      He said, said he,  \"If you will leave it all to me,        I will avow        Three days from now  That you shall all be free.\"  The solemn council then adjourned.  Each rat to home and fireside turned;    But each shook his wise head    And to his neighbor said:  \"It is a dangerous job, in truth,  Though it seems naught to headstrong youth.\"   Now young Sir Rat we next behold,  With manner brave and visage bold,      Go marching down      To London town,  Where wondrous things are sold.      We see him stop      At a large shop,  And with the bland clerk's courteous aid  This was the purchase that he made:  A bicycle of finest make,  With modern gear and patent brake,  Pedometer, pneumatic tire,  And spokes that looked like silver wire,      A lantern bright      To shine at night,  Enamel finish, nickel plate,  And all improvements up to date.  Said sly Sir Rat: \"It suits me well,  Especially that sweet-toned _bell_.\"   [Illustration]   The shades of night were falling fast  When Sir Rat turned toward home at last.  The neighbors watched him as he passed  And said: \"What is that queer-shaped thing?  Surely that can't be made to ring.\"    Sir Rat went on, nor stayed    To hear the jests they made;  And just outside the old cat's gate  He stopped and boldly braved his fate,    For if that cat    Should smell a rat  How quickly he'd come out and catch him,  And with what gusto he'd despatch him!  Sir Rat, against the picket-fence  Leaned the machine, then hurried hence,    And hid himself with glee,    And waited breathlessly      To see what that      Cantankerous cat  Would say, when in the twilight dim  He saw that brightly shining rim.     Sir Rat, though hidden quite,    And safely out of sight,  Had scarcely time to wink his eye,  When Mr. Cat came sauntering by.       \"Ha! Ha!\" said he,      \"What's this I see,  A bicycle! and just my size!  Well, this, indeed, is a surprise!      I'll confiscate      This treasure great;  How quickly I'll fly o'er the ground  When I pursue my hunting round!\"   He mounted "]]]
