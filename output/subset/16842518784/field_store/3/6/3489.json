At fifteen minutes to the appointed dining time, I was ready, and hastened below to talk once more with my father. He was in the dining room, instructing the servants as to the placement of the silver and accessories. My father was proud of the excellence of his table, and took all his meals in the splendid manner. His appreciation of food and wine was unsurpassed in my experience, and it had always been the greatest of pleasures for me to watch him at table, stalking across the damask and dipping delicately into the silver dishes prepared for him. He pretended to be too busy with his dinner preparations to engage me in conversation, but I insisted.  \"I must talk to you,\" I said. \"We must decide together how to do this.\"  \"It will not be easy,\" he answered with a twinkle. \"Consider Joanna's view. A cat as large and as old as myself is cause enough for comment. A cat that speaks is alarming. A cat that dines at table with the household is shocking. And a cat whom you must introduce as your--\"  \"Stop it!\" I cried. \"Joanna must know the truth. You must help me reveal it to her.\"  \"Then you will not heed my advice?\"  \"In all things but this. Our marriage can never be happy unless she accepts you for what you are.\"  \"And if there is no marriage?\"  I would not admit to this possibility. Joanna was mine; nothing could alter that. The look of pain and bewilderment in my eyes must have been evident to my father, for he touched my arm gently with his paw and said:  \"I will help you, Etienne. You must give me your trust.\"  \"Always!\"  \"Then come to dinner with Joanna and explain nothing. Wait for me to appear.\"  I grasped his paw and raised it to my lips. \"Thank you, father!\"  He turned to Francois, and snapped: \"You have my instructions?\"  \"Yes, sir,\" the servant replied.  \"Then all is ready. I shall return to my room now, Etienne. You may bring your fiancee to dine.\"  I hastened up the stairway, and found Joanna ready, strikingly beautiful in shimmering white satin. Together, we descended the grand staircase and entered the room.  Her eyes shone at the magnificence of the service set upon the table, at the soldiery array of fine wines, some of them already poured into their proper glasses for my father's enjoyment: _Haut Medoc_, from _St. Estephe_, authentic _Chablis_, _Epernay Champagne_, and an American import from the Napa Valley of which he was fond. I waited expectantly for his appearance as we sipped our aperitif, while Joanna chatted about innocuous matters, with no idea of the tormented state I was in.  At eight o'clock, my father had not yet made his appearance, and I grew ever more distraught as Francois signalled for the serving of the _bouillon au madere_. Had he changed his mind? Would I be left to explain my status without his help? I hadn't realized until this moment how difficult a task I had allotted for myself, and the fear of losing Joanna was terrible within me. The soup was flat and tasteless on my tongue, and the misery in my manner was too apparent for Joanna to miss.  \"What is it, Etienne?\" she said. \"You've been so morose all day. Can't you tell me what's wrong?\"  \"No, it's nothing. It's just--\" I let the impulse take possession of my speech. \"Joanna, there's something I should tell you. About my mother, and my father--\"  \"Ahem,\" Francois said.  He turned to the doorway, and our glances followed his.  \"Oh, Etienne!\" Joanna cried, in a voice ringing with delight.  It was my father, the cat, watching us with his gray, gold-flecked eyes. He approached the dining table, regarding Joanna with timidity and caution.  \"It's the cat in the painting!\" Joanna said. \"You didn't tell me he was here, Etienne. He's beautiful!\"  \"Joanna, this is--\"  \"Dauphin! I would have known him anywhere. Here, Dauphin! Here, kitty, kitty, kitty!\"  Slowly, my father approached her outstretched hand, and allowed her to scratch the thick fur on the back of his neck.  \"Aren't you the pretty little pussy! Aren't you the sweetest little thing!\"  \"Joanna!\"  She lifted my father by the haunches, and held him in her lap, stroking his fur and cooing the silly little words that women address to their pets. The sight pained and confused me, and I sought to find an opening word that would allow me to explain, yet hoping all the time that my father would himself provide the answer.  Then my father spoke.  \"Meow,\" he said.  \"Are you hungry?\" Joanna asked solicitously. \"Is the little pussy hungry?\"  \"Meow,\" my father said, and I believed my heart broke then and there. He leaped from her lap and padded across the room. I watched him through blurred eyes as he followed Francois to the corner, where the servant had placed a shallow bowl of milk. He lapped at it eagerly, until the last white drop was gone. Then he yawned and stretched, and trotted back to the doorway, with one fleeting glance in my direction that spoke articulately of what I must do next.  \"What a wonderful animal,\" Joanna said.  \"Yes,\" I answered. \"He was my mother's favorite.\"   [Illustration]     Transcriber's Note:      This etext was produced from _Fantastic Universe_ December 1957.

Column after column of lorries came pounding along, bearing their freight of shells, trench-mortar bombs, wire, stakes, sandbags, pipes, and a thousand other articles essential for the offensive, so that great dumps of explosives and other material arose in the green wayside places. Staff cars and signallers on motor-bikes went busily on their way. Ambulances hurried backwards and forwards between the line and the Casualty Clearing Station, for the days of June were hard days for the infantry who dug the \"leaping-off\" trenches, and manned them afterwards through rain and raid and bombardment. Horse transport and new batteries hurried to their destinations. \"Caterpillars\" rumbled up, towing the heavier guns. Infantrymen and sappers marched to their tasks round and about the line.  Roads were repaired, telephone wires placed deep in the ground, trees felled for dug-outs and gun emplacements, water-pipes laid up to the trenches ready to be extended across conquered territory, while small-gauge and large-gauge railways seemed to spring to being in the night.  Then came days of terror for the enemy. Slowly our guns broke forth upon them in a tumult of rage. The Germans in retaliation sprayed our nearer batteries with shrapnel, and threw a barrage of whizz-bangs across the little white road leading into the village of HÃ©buterne. This feeble retaliation was swallowed up and overpowered by the torrent of metal that now poured incessantly into their territory. Shells from the 18-pounders and trench-mortars cut their wire and demoralised their sentries. Guns of all calibres pounded their system of trenches till it looked for all the world like nothing more than a ploughed field. The sky was filled with our aeroplanes wheeling about and directing the work of batteries, and with the black and white bursts of anti-aircraft shells. Shells from the 9.2 howitzers crashed into strong points and gun emplacements and hurled them skywards. Petrol shells licked up the few remaining green-leaved trees in Gommecourt Wood, where observers watched and snipers nested: 15-inch naval guns, under the vigilant guidance of observation balloons, wrought deadly havoc in Bapaume and other villages and billets behind their lines.  Thrice were the enemy enveloped in gas and smoke, and, as they stood-to in expectation of attack, were mown down by a torrent of shells.  The bombardment grew and swelled and brought down showers of rain. Yet the ground remained comparatively dry and columns of dust arose from the roads as hoof and wheel crushed their broken surfaces and battalions of infantry, with songs and jests, marched up to billets and bivouacs just behind the line, ready to give battle.     CHAPTER II  EVE OF ATTACK   Boom! Absolute silence for a minute. Boom! followed quickly by a more distant report from a fellow-gun. At each bellowing roar from the 9.2 near by, bits of the ceiling clattered on to the floor of the billet and the wall-plaster trickled down on to one's valise, making a sound like soot coming down a chimney.  It was about three o'clock in the morning. I did not look at my watch, as its luminous facings had faded away months before and I did not wish to disturb my companions by lighting a match. A sigh or a groan came from one part of the room or another, showing that our bombardment was troublesome even to the sleepers, and a rasping noise occasionally occurred when W----k, my Company Commander, turned round uneasily on his bed of wood and rabbit-wire.  I plunged farther down into the recesses of my flea-bag, though its linings had broken down and my feet stuck out at the bottom. Then I pulled my British Warm over me and muffled my head and ears in it to escape the regularly-repeated roar of the 9.2. Though the whole house seemed to be shaking to bits at every minute, the noise was muffled to a less ear-splitting fury and I gradually sank into a semi-sleep.  About six o'clock I awoke finally, and after an interval the battery stopped its work. At half-past seven I hauled myself out of my valise and sallied forth into the courtyard, clad in a British Warm, pyjamas, and gum-boots, to make my toilet. I blinked as I came into the light and felt very sleepy. The next moment I was on my hands and knees, with every nerve of my brain working like a mill-stone. A vicious \"swish\" had sounded over my head, and knowing its meaning I had turned for the nearest door and slipped upon the cobbled stones of the yard. I picked myself up and fled for that door just as the inevitable \"crash\" came. This happened to be the door to the servants' quarters, and they were vastly amused. We looked out of the window at the _dÃ©bris_ which was rising into the air. Two more \"crumps\" came whirling over the house, and with shattering explosions lifted more _dÃ©bris_ into the air beyond the farther side of the courtyard. Followed a burst of shrapnel and one more \"crump,\" and the enemy's retaliation on the 9.2 and its crew had ceased. The latter, however, had descended into their dug-out, while the gun remained unscathed. Not so some of our own men.  We were examining the nose-cap of a shell which had hit the wall of our billet, when a corporal came up, who said hurriedly to W----k, \"Corporal G----'s been killed and four men wounded.\"  The whole tragedy had happened so swiftly, and this sudden announcement of the death of one of our best N.C.O.s had come as such a shock, that all we did was to stare at each other with the words:  \"My God! Corporal G---- gone! It's impossible.\"  One expects shells and death in the line, but three or four miles behind it one grows accustomed, so to speak, to live in a fool's paradise. We went round to see our casualties, and I found two of my platoon, bandaged in the leg and arm, sitting in a group of their pals, who were congratulating them on having got \"soft Blighty ones.\" The Company Quartermaster-Sergeant showed me a helmet, which was lying outside the billet when the shells came over, with a triangular gash in it, into which one could almost place one's fist. At the body of Corporal G---- I could not bring myself to look. The poor fellow had been terribly hit in the back and neck, and, I confess it openly, I had not the courage, and felt that it would be a sacrilege, to gaze on the mangled remains of one whom I had valued so much as an N.C.O. and grown to like so much as a man during the last ten months.  Dark clouds were blowing over in an easterly direction; a cheerless day added to the general gloom. We had a Company Officers' final consultation on the plans for the morrow, after which I held an inspection of my platoon, and gave out some further orders. On my return to the billet W----k told me that the attack had been postponed for two days owing to bad weather. Putting aside all thought of orders for the time being, we issued out rum to the men, indulged in a few \"tots\" ourselves, and settled down to a pleasant evening.         *       *       *       *       *  In a little courtyard on the evening of June 30 I called the old platoon to attention for the last time, shook hands with the officers left in reserve, marched off into the road, and made up a turning to the left on to the Blue Track. We had done about a quarter of the ground between Bayencourt and Sailly-au-Bois when a messenger hurried up to tell me to halt, as several of the platoons of the L---- S---- had to pass us. We sat down by a large shell-hole, and the men lit up their pipes and cigarettes and shouted jokes to the men of the other regiment as they passed by.  It was a very peaceful evening--remarkably peaceful, now that the guns were at rest. A light breeze played eastward. I sat with my face towards the sunset, wondering a little if this was the last time that I should see it. One often reads of this sensation in second-rate novels. I must say that I had always thought it greatly \"overdone\"; but a great zest in the splendour of life swept over me as I sat there in the glow of that setting sun, and also a great calmness that gave me heart to do my uttermost on the morrow. My father had enclosed a little card in his last letter to me with the words upon it of the prayer of an old cavalier of the seventeenth century--Sir Jacob Astley--before the battle of Newbury:--\"Lord, I shall be very busy this day. I may forget Thee, but do not Thou forget me.\" A peculiar old prayer, but I kept on repeating it to myself with great comfort that evening. My men were rather quiet. Perhaps the general calmness was affecting them with kindred thoughts, though an Englishman never shows them. On the left stood the stumpy spire of Bayencourt Church just left by us. On the right lay Sailly-au-Bois in its girdle of trees. Along the side of the valley which ran out from behind Sailly-au-Bois, arose numerous lazy pillars of smoke from the wood fires and kitchens of an artillery encampment. An English aeroplane, with a swarm of black puffs around it betokening German shells, was gleaming in the setting sun. It purred monotonously, almost drowning the screech of occasional shells"]]]
