And one of those evil-minded men bent his bow and shot a shaft at us, but it fell far short of where we sat, and the laugh of those runagates came over the sands to us.  So we crept up the beach trembling, and then rose to our feet and got to our horses, and rode hither speedily, and our hearts are broken for thy sorrow.\"  At that word came Hallblithe's own sister out from the hall; and she bore weapons with her, to wit Hallblithe's sword and shield and helm and hauberk.  As for him he turned back silently to his work, and set the steel of the spear on the new ashen shaft, and took the hammer and smote the nail in, and laid the weapon on a round pebble that was thereby, and clenched the nail on the other side.  Then he looked about, and saw that the other damsel had brought him his coal-black war-horse ready saddled and bridled; then he did on his armour, and girt his sword to his side and leapt into the saddle, and took his new-shafted spear in hand and shook the rein.  But none of all those damsels durst say a word to him or ask him whither he went, for they feared his face, and the sorrow of his heart.  So he got him out of the garth and turned toward the sea-shore, and they saw the glitter of his spear-point a minute over the turf-wall, and heard the clatter of his horse-hoofs as he galloped over the hard way; and thus he departed.     CHAPTER III: THE WARRIORS OF THE RAVEN SEARCH THE SEAS   Then the women bethought them, and they spake a word or two together, and then they sundered and went one this way and one that, to gather together the warriors of the Raven who were a-field, or on the way, nigh unto the house, that they might follow Hallblithe down to the sea-shore and help him; after a while they came back again by one and two and three, bringing with them the wrathful young men; and when there was upward of a score gathered in the garth armed and horsed, they rode their ways to the sea, being minded to thrust a long-ship of the Ravens out over the Rollers into the sea, and follow the strong-thieves of the waters and bring a-back the Hostage, so that they might end the sorrow at once, and establish joy once more in the House of the Raven and the House of the Rose.  But they had with them three lads of fifteen winters or thereabouts to lead their horses back home again, when they should have gone up on to the Horse of the Brine.  Thus then they departed, and the maidens stood in the garth-gate till they lost sight of them behind the sandhills, and then turned back sorrowfully into the house, and sat there talking low of their sorrow. And many a time they had to tell their tale anew, as folk came into the hall one after another from field and fell.  But the young men came down to the sea, and found Hallblithe's black horse straying about amongst the tamarisk-bushes above the beach; and they looked thence over the sand, and saw neither Hallblithe nor any man: and they gazed out seaward, and saw neither ship nor sail on the barren brine.  Then they went down on to the sand, and sundered their fellowship, and went half one way, half the other, betwixt the sandhills and the surf, where now the tide was flowing, till the nesses of the east and the west, the horns of the bay, stayed them.  Then they met together again by the Rollers, when the sun was within an hour of setting.  There and then they laid hand to that ship which is called the Seamew, and they ran her down over the Rollers into the waves, and leapt aboard and hoisted sail, and ran out the oars and put to sea; and a little wind was blowing seaward from the gates of the mountains behind them.  So they quartered the sea-plain, as the kestrel doth the water-meadows, till the night fell on them, and was cloudy, though whiles the wading moon shone out; and they had seen nothing, neither sail nor ship, nor aught else on the barren brine, save the washing of waves and the hovering of sea-fowl.  So they lay-to outside the horns of the bay and awaited the dawning.  And when morning was come they made way again, and searched the sea, and sailed to the out-skerries, and searched them with care; then they sailed into the main and fared hither and thither and up and down: and this they did for eight days, and in all that time they saw no ship nor sail, save three barks of the Fish-biters nigh to the Skerry which is called Mew-stone.  So they fared home to the Raven Bay, and laid their keel on the Rollers, and so went their ways sadly, home to the House of the Raven: and they deemed that for this time they could do no more in seeking their valiant kinsman and his fair damsel.  And they were very sorry; for these two were well-beloved of all men.  But since they might not amend it, they abode in peace, awaiting what the change of days might bring them.     CHAPTER IV: NOW HALLBLITHE TAKETH THE SEA   Now must it be told of Hallblithe that he rode fiercely down to the sea- shore, and from the top of the beach he gazed about him, and there below him was the Ship-stead and Rollers of his kindred, whereon lay the three long-ships, the Seamew, and the Osprey and the Erne.  Heavy and huge they seemed to him as they lay there, black-sided, icy-cold with the washing of the March waves, their golden dragon-heads looking seaward wistfully. But first had he looked out into the offing, and it was only when he had let his eyes come back from where the sea and sky met, and they had beheld nothing but the waste of waters, that he beheld the Ship-stead closely; and therewith he saw where a little to the west of it lay a skiff, which the low wave of the tide lifted and let fall from time to time.  It had a mast, and a black sail hoisted thereon and flapping with slackened sheet.  A man sat in the boat clad in black raiment, and the sun smote a gleam from the helm on his head.  Then Hallblithe leapt off his horse, and strode down the sands shouldering his spear; and when he came near to the man in the boat he poised his spear and shook it and cried out: \"Man, art thou friend or foe?\"  Said the man: \"Thou art a fair young man: but there is grief in thy voice along with wrath.  Cast not till thou hast heard me, and mayst deem whether I may do aught to heal thy grief.\"  \"What mayst thou do?\" said Hallblithe; \"art thou not a robber of the sea, a harrier of the folks that dwell in peace?\"  The man laughed: \"Yea,\" said he, \"my craft is thieving and carrying off the daughters of folk, so that we may have a ransom for them.  Wilt thou come over the waters with me?\"  Hallblithe said wrathfully:  \"Nay, rather, come thou ashore here!  Thou seemest a big man, and belike shall be good of thine hands.  Come and fight with me; and then he of us who is vanquished, if he be unslain, shall serve the other for a year, and then shalt thou do my business in the ransoming.\"  The man in the boat laughed again, and that so scornfully that he angered Hallblithe beyond measure: then he arose in the boat and stood on his feet swaying from side to side as he laughed.  He was passing big, long- armed and big-headed, and long hair came from under his helm like the tail of a red horse; his eyes were grey and gleaming, and his mouth wide.  In a while he stayed his laughter and said: \"O Warrior of the Raven, this were a simple game for thee to play; though it is not far from my mind, for fighting when I needs must win is no dull work.  Look you, if I slay or vanquish thee, then all is said; and if by some chance stroke thou slayest me, then is thine only helper in this matter gone from thee.  Now to be short, I bid thee come aboard to me if thou wouldst ever hear another word of thy damsel betrothed.  And moreover this need not hinder thee to fight with me if thou hast a mind to it thereafter; for we shall soon come to a land big enough for two to stand on.  Or if thou listest to fight in a boat rocking on the waves, I see not but there may be manhood in that also.\"  Now was the hot wrath somewhat run off Hallblithe, nor durst he lose any chance to hear a word of his beloved; so he said: \"Big man, I will come aboard.  But look thou to it, if thou hast a mind to bewray me; for the sons of the Raven die hard.\"  \"Well,\" said the big man, \"I have heard that their minstrels are of many words, and think that they have tales to tell.  Come aboard and loiter not.\"  Then Hallblithe waded the surf and lightly strode over the gunwale of the skiff and sat him down.  The big man thrust out into the deep and haled home the sheet; but there was but little wind.  Then said Hallblithe: \"Wilt thou have me row, for I wot not whitherward to steer?\"  Said the red carle: \"Maybe thou art not in a hurry; I am not: do as thou wilt.\"  So Hallblithe took the oars and rowed mightily, while the alien steered, and they went swiftly and lightly over the sea, and the waves were little.     CHAPTER V: THEY COME UNTO THE ISLE OF RANSOM   So the sun grew low, and it set; the stars and the moon shone a while and then it clouded over.  Hallblithe still rowed and rested not, though he was weary; and the big man sat and steered, and held his peace.  But when the night was grown old and it was not far from the dawn, the alien said: \"Youngling of the Ravens, now shalt thou sleep and I will row.\"  Hallblithe was exceeding weary; so he gave the oars to the alien and lay down in the stern and slept.  And in his sleep he dreamed that he was lying in the House of the Raven, and his sisters came to him and said, \"Rise up now, Hallblithe! wilt thou be a sluggard on the day of thy wedding?  Come thou with us to the House of the Rose that we may bear away the Hostage.\"  Then he dreamed that they departed, and he arose and clad himself: but when he would have gone out of the hall, then was it no longer daylight, but moonlight, and he dreamed that he had dreamed: nevertheless he would have gone abroad, but might not"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2565"],["title","The Story of the Glittering Plain (#2)"],["body","the door; so he said he would go out by a window; but the wall was high and smooth (quite other than in the House of the Raven, where were low windows all along one aisle), nor was there any way to come at them.  But he dreamed that he was so abashed thereat, and had such a weakness on him, that he wept for pity of himself: and he went to his bed to lie down; and lo! there was no bed and no hall; nought but a heath, wild and wide, and empty under the moon.  And still he wept in his dream, and his manhood seemed departed from him, and he heard a voice crying out, \"Is this the Land?  Is this the Land?\"  Therewithal he awoke, and as his eyes cleared he beheld the big man rowing and the black sail flapping against the mast; for the wind had fallen dead and they were faring on over a long smooth swell of the sea. It was broad daylight, but round about them was a thick mist, which seemed none the less as if the sun were ready to shine through it.  As Hallblithe caught the red man's eye, he smiled and nodded on him and said: \"Now has the time come for thee first to eat and then to row.  But tell me what is that upon thy cheeks?\"  Hallblithe, reddening somewhat, said: \"The night dew hath fallen on me.\"  Quoth the sea-rover, \"It is no shame for thee a youngling to remember thy betrothed in thy sleep, and to weep because thou lackest her.  But now bestir thee, for it is later than thou mayest deem.\"  Therewith the big man drew in the oars and came to the afterpart of the boat, and drew meat and drink out of a locker thereby; and they ate and drank together, and Hallblithe grew strong and somewhat less downcast; and he went forward and gat the oars into his hands.  Then the big red man stood up and looked over his left shoulder and said: \"Soon shall we have a breeze and bright weather.\"  Then he looked into the midmost of the sail and fell a-whistling such a tune as the fiddles play to dancing men and maids at Yule-tide, and his eyes gleamed and glittered therewithal, and exceeding big he looked.  Then Hallblithe felt a little air on his cheek, and the mist grew thinner, and the sail began to fill with wind till the sheet tightened: then, lo! the mist rising from the face of the sea, and the sea's face rippling gaily under a bright sun.  Then the wind increased, and the wall of mist departed and a few light clouds sped over the sky, and the sail swelled and the boat heeled over, and the seas fell white from the prow, and they sped fast over the face of the waters.  Then laughed the red-haired man, and said: \"O croaker on the dead branch, now is the wind such that no rowing of thine may catch up with it: so in with the oars now, and turn about, and thou shalt see whitherward we are going.\"  Then Hallblithe turned about on the thwart and looked across the sea, and lo! before them the high cliffs and crags and mountains of a new land which seemed to be an isle, and they were deep blue under the sun, which now shone aloft in the mid heaven.  He said nought at all, but sat looking and wondering what land it might be; but the big man said: \"O tomb of warriors, is it not as if the blueness of the deep sea had heaved itself up aloft, and turned from coloured air into rock and stone, so wondrous blue it is?  But that is because those crags and mountains are so far away, and as we draw nigher to them, thou shalt see them as they verily are, that they are coal-black; and yonder land is an isle, and is called the Isle of Ransom.  Therein shall be the market for thee where thou mayst cheapen thy betrothed.  There mayst thou take her by the hand and lead her away thence, when thou hast dealt with the chapman of maidens and hast pledged thee by the fowl of battle, and the edge of the fallow blade to pay that which he will have of thee.\"  As the big man spoke there was a mocking in his voice and his face and in his whole huge body, which made the sword of Hallblithe uneasy in his scabbard; but he refrained his wrath, and said: \"Big man, the longer I look, the less I can think how we are to come up on to yonder island; for I can see nought but a huge cliff, and great mountains rising beyond it.\"  \"Thou shalt the more wonder,\" said the alien, \"the nigher thou drawest thereto; for it is not because we are far away that thou canst see no beach or strand, or sloping of the land seaward, but because there is nought of all these things.  Yet fear not! am I not with thee? thou shalt come ashore on the Isle of Ransom.\"  Then Hallblithe held his peace, and the other spake not for a while, but gave a short laugh once or twice; and said at last in a big voice, \"Little Carrion-biter, why dost thou not ask me of my name?\"  Now Hallblithe was a tall man and a fell fighter; but he said: \"Because I was thinking of other things and not of thee.\"  \"Well,\" said the big man, in a voice still louder, \"when I am at home men call me the Puny Fox.\"  Then Hallblithe said: \"Art thou a Fox?  It may well be that thou shalt beguile me as such beasts will but look to it, that if thou dost I shall know how to avenge me.\"  Then rose up the big man from the helm, and straddled wide in the boat, and cried out in a great roaring voice: \"Crag-nester, I am one of seven brethren, and the smallest and weakest of them.  Art thou not afraid?\"  \"No,\" said Hallblithe, \"for the six others are not here.  Wilt thou fight here in boat, O Fox?\"  \"Nay,\" said Fox, \"rather we will drink a cup of wine together.\"  So he opened the locker again and drew out thence a great horn of some huge neat of the outlands, which was girthed and stopped with silver, and also a golden cup, and he filled the cup from the horn and gave it into Hallblithe's hand and said: \"Drink, O black-fledged nestling!  But call a health over the cup if thou wilt.\"  So Hallblithe raised the cup aloft and cried: \"Health to the House of the Raven and to them that love it! an ill day to its foemen!\"  Then he set his lips to the cup and drank; and that wine seemed to him better and stronger than any he had ever tasted. But when he had given the cup back again to Fox, that red one filled it again, and cried over it, \"The Treasure of the Sea! and the King that dieth not!\"  Then he drank, and filled again for Hallblithe, and steered with his knees meanwhile; and thus they drank three cups each, and Fox smiled and was peaceful and said but little, but Hallblithe sat wondering how the world was changed for him since yesterday.  But now was the sky blown all clear of clouds and the wind piped shrill behind them, and the great waves rose and fell about them, and the sun glittered on them in many colours.  Fast flew the boat before the wind as though it would never stop, and the day was waning, and the wind still rising; and now the Isle of Ransom uphove huge before them, and coal-black, and no beach and no haven was to be seen therein; and still they ran before the wind towards that black cliff-wall, against which the sea washed for ever, and no keel ever built by man might live for one moment 'twixt the surf and the cliff of that grim land.  The sun grew low, and sank red under the sea, and that world of stone swallowed up half the heavens before them, for they were now come very nigh thereto; nor could Hallblithe see aught for it, but that they must be dashed against the cliff and perish in a moment of time.  Still the boat flew on; but now when the twilight was come, and they had just opened up along reach of the cliff that lay beyond a high ness, Hallblithe thought he saw down by the edge of the sea something darker than the face of the rock-wall, and he deemed it was a cave: they came a little nearer and he saw it was a great cave high enough to let a round- ship go in with all her sails set.  \"Son of the Raven,\" quoth Fox, \"hearken, for thy heart is not little. Yonder is the gate into the Isle of Ransom, and if thou wilt, thou mayst go through it.  Yet it may be that if thou goest ashore on to the Isle something grievous shall befall thee, a trouble more than thou canst bear: a shame it may be.  Now there are two choices for thee: either to go up on to the Isle and face all; or to die here by my hand having done nothing unmanly or shameful: What sayest thou?\"  \"Thou art of many words when time so presses, Fox,\" said Hallblithe.  \"Why should I not choose to go up on to the Island to deliver my trothplight maiden?  For the rest, slay me if thou canst, if we come alive out of this cauldron of waters.\"  Said the big red man: \"Look on then, and note Fox how he steereth, as it were through a needle's eye.\"  Now were they underneath the black shadow of the black cliff and amidst the twilight the surf was tossed about like white fire.  In the lower heavens the stars were beginning to twinkle and the moon was bright and yellow, and aloft all was peaceful, for no cloud sullied the sky.  One moment Hallblithe saw all this hanging above the turmoil of thundering water and dripping rock and the next he was in the darkness of the cave, the roaring wind and the waves still making thunder about him, though of a different voice from the harsh hubbub without.  Then he heard Fox say: \"Sit down now and take the oars, for presently shall we be at home at the landing place.\"  So Hallblithe took the oars and rowed, and as they went up the cave the sea fell, and the wind died out into the aimless gustiness of hollow places; and for a little while was all as dark as dark might be.  Then Hallblithe saw that the darkness grew a little greyer, and he looked over his shoulder and saw a star of light before the bows of the boat, and Fox cried out: \"Yea, it is like day; bright will the moon be for such as needs must be wayfaring to-night!  Cease rowing, O Son of the coal-blue fowl, for there is way enough on her.\"  Then Hallblithe lay on his oars, and in a minute the bows smote the land; then he turned about and saw a steep stair of stone, and up the sloping shaft thereof the moonlit sky and the bright stars.  Then Fox arose and came forward and leapt"]]]
