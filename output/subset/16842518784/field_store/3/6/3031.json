On the 24th of January, 1862, McClellan, then commanding all the armies of the United States, was called on by the Secretary of War to report whether the expedition proposed by General Butler should be prosecuted, abandoned, or modified, and in what manner.  McClellan at once urged that the expedition be suspended.  In his opinion, \"not less than 30,000 men, and it is believed 50,000, would be required to insure success against New Orleans in a blow to be struck from the Gulf.\"  This suggestion did not meet the approval of the government, now fully determined on the enterprise.  Brigadier-General J. G. Barnard, the chief engineer of the Army of the Potomac, an engineer also of more than common ability, energy, and experience, was now called into consultation.  On the 28th of January, 1862, he submitted to the Navy Department a memorandum describing fully the defences of Forts Jackson and St. Philip and outlining a plan for a combined attempt on these works by the army and navy.  The military force required for the purpose he estimated at 20,000 men.  Meanwhile the work of transferring Butler's forces by sea to Ship Island had been going on with vigor.  He had raised thirteen regiments of infantry, ten batteries of light artillery, and three troops of cavalry, numbering in all about 13,600 men.  To these were now added from the garrison of Baltimore three regiments, the 21st Indiana, 4th Wisconsin, and 6th Michigan, and the 2d Massachusetts battery, thus increasing his force to 14,400 infantry, 275 cavalry, and 580 artillerists; in all, 15,255 officers and men.  On the 23d of February, 1862, Butler received his final orders: \"The object of your expedition,\" said McClellan, \"is one of vital importance--the capture of New Orleans.  The route selected is up the Mississippi River, and the first obstacle to be encountered (perhaps the only one) is in the resistance offered by Forts St. Philip and Jackson.  It is expected that the navy can reduce these works.  Should the navy fail to reduce the works, you will land your forces and siege-train, and endeavor to breach the works, silence their guns, and carry them by assault.  \"The next resistance will be near the English bend, where there are some earthen batteries.  Here it may be necessary for you to land your troops to co-operate with the naval attack, although it is more than probable that the navy, unassisted, can accomplish the result.  If these works are taken, the city of New Orleans necessarily falls.\"  After obtaining possession of New Orleans, the instructions went on to say, Butler was to reduce all the works guarding the approaches, to join with the navy in occupying Baton Rouge, and then to endeavor to open communication with the northern column by the Mississippi, always bearing in mind the necessity of occupying Jackson, as soon as this could safely be done.  Mobile was to follow, then Pensacola and Galveston.  By the time New Orleans should have fallen the government would probably reinforce his army sufficiently to accomplish all these objects.  On the same day a new military department was created called the Department of the Gulf, and Butler was assigned to the command. Its limits were to comprise all the coast of the Gulf of Mexico west of Pensacola harbor, and so much of the Gulf States as might be occupied by Butler's forces.  Since the middle of October he had commanded the expeditionary forces, under the name of the Department of New England.  Arriving at Ship Island on the 20th of March, he formally assumed the command of the Department of the Gulf, announcing Major George C. Strong as Assistant Adjutant-General and Chief of Staff, Lieutenant Godfrey Weitzel as Chief Engineer, and Surgeon Thomas Hewson Bache as Medical Director.  To these were afterward added Colonel John Wilson Shaffer as Chief Quartermaster, Colonel John W. Turner as Chief Commissary, and Captain George A. Kensel as Acting Assistant Inspector-General and Chief of Artillery.  By the end of March all the troops destined for the expedition had landed at Ship Island, with the exception of the 13th Connecticut, 15th Maine, 7th and 8th Vermont regiments, 1st Vermont and 2d Massachusetts batteries.  Within the next fortnight all these troops joined the force except the 2d Massachusetts battery, which being detained more than seven weeks at Fortress Monroe, and being nearly five weeks at sea, did not reach New Orleans until the 21st of May. Meanwhile, of the six Maine batteries, all except the 1st had been diverted to other fields of service.  While awaiting at Ship Island the completion of the preparations of the navy for the final attempt on the river forts, Butler proceeded to organize his command and to discipline and drill the troops composing it.  Many of these were entirely without instruction in any of the details of service.  On the 22d of March, he divided his forces into three brigades of five or six regiments each, attaching to each brigade one or more batteries of artillery and a troop of cavalry.  These brigades were commanded by Brigadier-Generals John W. Phelps and Thomas Williams, and Colonel George F. Shepley of the 12th Maine.  When finally assembled the whole force reported about 13,500 officers and men for duty, and from that moment its strength was destined to undergo a steady diminution by the natural attrition of service, augmented, in this case, by climatic influences.  The fleet under Farragut consisted of seventeen vessels, mounting 154 guns.  Four were screw-sloops, one a side-wheel steamer, three screw corvettes, and nine screw gunboats.  Each of the gunboats carried one 11-inch smooth-bore gun, and one 30-pounder rifle; but neither of these could be used to fire at an enemy directly ahead, and, in the operations awaiting the fleet, it is within bounds to say that not more than one gun in four could be brought to bear at any given moment.  With this fleet were twenty mortar-boats, under Porter, each carrying one 13-inch mortar, and six gunboats, assigned for the service of the mortar-boats and armed like the gunboats of the river fleet.  Farragut, with the _Hartford_, had reached Ship Island on the 20th of February; the rest of the vessels assigned to his fleet soon followed.  Then entering the delta, from that time he conducted the blockade of the river from the head of the passes.  The Confederacy was now being so closely pressed in every quarter as to make it impossible, with the forces at its command, to defend effectively and at the same moment every point menaced by the troops and fleets of the Union.  Thus the force that might otherwise have been employed in defending New Orleans was, under the pressure of the emergency, so heavily drawn from to strengthen the army at Corinth, then engaged in resisting the southward advance of the combined armies of the Union under Halleck, as to leave New Orleans, and indeed all Louisiana, at the mercy of any enemy that should succeed in passing the river forts.  At this time the entire land-force, under Major-General Mansfield Lovell, hardly exceeded 5,000 men.  Of these, 1,100 occupied Forts Jackson and St. Philip, under the command of General Duncan; 1,200 held the Chalmette line, under General Martin L. Smith, and about 3,000, chiefly new levies, badly armed, were in New Orleans.  Besides this small land-force, the floating defences consisted of four improvised vessels of the Confederate navy, two belonging to the State of Louisiana, and six others of what was called the Montgomery fleet.  These were boats specially constructed for the defence of the river, but most of them had been sent up the river to Memphis to hold off Foote and Davis.  The twelve vessels carried in all thirty-eight guns.  Each of the boats of the river-fleet defence had its bows shod with iron and its engines protected with cotton.  This was also the case with the two sea-going steamers belonging to the State.  Of this flotilla the most powerful was the iron-clad _Louisiana_, whose armor was found strong enough to turn an 11-inch shell at short range, and, as her armament consisted of two 7-inch rifles, three 9-inch shell guns, four 18-inch shell guns, and seven 6-inch rifles, she might have proved a formidable foe had her engines been equal to their work.  At the Plaquemine Bend, twenty miles above the head of the passes and ninety below New Orleans, the engineers of the United States had constructed two permanent fortifications, designed to defend the entrance of the river against the foreign enemies of the Union. These formidable works had now to be passed or taken before New Orleans could be occupied.  Fort St. Philip, on the left or north bank, was a work of brick and earth, flanked on either hand by a water battery.  In the main work were mounted, in barbette, four 8-inch columbiads and one 24-pounder gun; the upper water battery carried sixteen 24-pounders, the lower one one 8-inch columbiad, one 7-inch rifle, six 42-pounders, nine 32-pounders, and four 24-pounders.  Besides these, there were seven mortars, one of 13-inch calibre, five of 10-inch, and one of 8-inch.  Forty-two of the guns could be brought to bear upon the fleet ascending the river.  Fort Jackson, on the south or left bank of the river, was a casemated pentagon of brick, mounting in the casemates fourteen 24-pounder guns, and ten 24-pounder howitzers, and in barbette in the upper tier two 10-inch columbiads, three 8-inch columbiads, one 7-inch rifle, six 42-pounders, fifteen 32-pounders, and eleven 24-pounders, in all sixty-two guns.  The water battery below the main work was armed with one 10-inch columbiad, two 8-inch columbiads, and two rifled 32-pounders.  Fifty of these pieces were available"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24606"],["title","History of the Nineteenth Army Corps (#2)"],["body","the fleet, but of the whole armament of one hundred and nine guns, fifty-six were old 24-pounder smooth-bores.  The passage of the forts had been obstructed by a raft or chain anchored between them.  The forts once overcome, no other defence remained to be encountered until English Turn was reached, where earthworks had been thrown up on both banks.  Here at Chalmette, on the left bank, it was that, in 1815, Jackson, with his handful of raw levies, so signally defeated Wellington's veterans of the Peninsula, under the leadership of the fearless Pakenham.  Fort St. Philip stands about 700 yards higher up the river than Fort Jackson; the river at this point is about 800 yards wide, and the distance between the nearest salients of the main works is about 1,000 yards.  A vessel attempting to run the gauntlet of the batteries would be under fire while passing over a distance of three and a half miles.  The river was now high, and the banks, everywhere below the river level, and only protected from inundation by the levees, were overflowed.  There was no standing room for an investing army; the lower guns were under water, and in the very forts the platforms were awash.  When the fleet was ready, Butler embarked eight regiments and three batteries under Phelps and Williams on transports, and, going to the head of the passes, held his troops in readiness to co-operate with the navy.  On the 16th of April the fleet took up its position. The mortar-boats, or \"bombers,\" as they began to be called, were anchored between 3,000 and 4,000 yards below Fort Jackson, upon which the attack was mainly to be directed.  From the view of those in the fort, the boats that lay under the right bank were covered by trees.  Those on the opposite side of the river were screened, after a fashion, by covering their hulls with reeds and willows, cut for the purpose.  On the 18th of April the bombardment began.  It soon became evident that success was not to be attained in this way, and Farragut determined upon passing the forts with his fleet.  Should he fail in reducing them by this movement, Butler was to land in the rear of Fort St. Philip, near Quarantine, and carry the works by storm. Accordingly, he remained with his transports below the forts, and waited for the hour.  Shepley occupied Ship Island with the rest of the force.  Early in March the raft, formed of great cypress trees, forty feet long and fifty inches through, laid lengthwise in the river about three feet apart, anchored by heavy chains and strengthened by massive cross-timbers, had been partly carried away by the flood. To make good the damage, a number of large schooners had then been anchored in the gap.  On the morning of the 21st of April this formidable obstruction was cleverly and in a most gallant manner broken through by the fleet.  On the night of the 23d of April, Farragut moved to the attack. His fleet, organized in three divisions of eight, three, and six vessels respectively, was formed in line ahead.  The first division was led by Captain Bailey, in the _Cayuga_, followed by the _Pensacola, Mississippi, Oneida, Varuna, Katahdin, Kineo_, and _Wissahickon;_ the second division followed, composed of Farragut's flag-ship, the _Hartford_, Commander Richard Wainwright, the _Brooklyn_, and the _Richmond;_ while the third division, forming the rear of the column, was led by Captain Bell, in the _Sciota_, followed by the _Iroquois, Kennebec, Pinola, Itasca,_ and _Winona_.  At half-past two o'clock on the morning of the 24th of April the whole fleet was under way; a quarter of an hour later the batteries of Forts Jackson and St. Philip opened simultaneously upon the _Cayuga_.  It was some time before the navy could reply, but soon every gun was in action.  Beset by perils on every hand, the fleet pressed steadily up the river.  The Confederate boats were destroyed, the fire-rafts were overcome, the gunners of the forts were driven from their guns, and when the sun rose Farragut was above the forts with the whole of his fleet, except the _Itasca, Winona_, and _Kennebec_, which put back disabled, and the _Varuna_, sunk by the Confederate gunboats.  The next afternoon, having made short work of Chalmette, Farragut anchored off New Orleans, and held the town at his mercy.  The casualties were 37 killed and 147 wounded, in all 184.  The Confederate loss was 50, 11 killed and 39 wounded.  The _Louisiana, McCrea_, and _Defiance_, sole survivors of the Confederate fleet, escaping comparatively unhurt, took refuge under the walls of Fort St. Philip.  Leaving Phelps, with the 30th Massachusetts and 12th Connecticut and Manning's 4th Massachusetts battery, at the head of the passes, in order to be prepared to occupy the works immediately on their surrender, Butler hastened with the rest of his force to Sable Island in the rear of Fort St. Philip.  When the transports came to anchor on the morning of the 26th, the Confederate flags on Forts St. Philip and Jackson were plainly visible to the men on board, while these, in their turn, were seen from the forts.  Here the troops received the news of Farragut's arrival at New Orleans. On the morning of the 28th they saw the Confederate ram _Louisiana_ blown up while floating past the forts, and on the same day Jones landed with the 26th Massachusetts and Paine with two companies of the 4th Wisconsin and a detachment of the 21st Indiana, to work their way through a small canal to Quarantine, six miles above Fort St. Philip, for the purpose of seizing the narrow strip by which the garrison must escape, if at all.  This was only accomplished by a long and tiresome transport in boats, and finally by wading. However, at half-past two on the afternoon of the 28th April, the Confederate flags over Forts Jackson and St. Philip were observed to disappear; the national ensign floated in their stead; and soon it became known that Duncan had surrendered to Porter.  Porter immediately took possession and held it until Phelps came up the river to relieve him.  Then Major Whittemore, of the 30th Massachusetts, with about two hundred men of his regiment, landed and took command at Fort St. Philip, while Manning occupied Fort Jackson.  Almost simultaneously the frigate _Mississippi_ came down the river, bringing Jones with the news that his regiment was at Quarantine, holding both banks of the river, and thus effectually sealing the last avenue of escape; for at this time the levee formed the only pathway.  On the 29th Phelps put Deming in command of Fort Jackson, intending to leave his regiment, the 12th Connecticut, in garrison there, and to place Dudley, with the 30th Massachusetts, at Fort St. Philip; but before this arrangement could be carried out, orders came from Butler, designating the 26th Massachusetts as the garrison of the two forts, with Jones in command.  Phelps, with his force, was directed to New Orleans.  On the 1st of May Butler landed at New Orleans and took military possession of the city.  Simultaneously, at five o'clock in the afternoon, the 31st Massachusetts with a section of Everett's 6th Massachusetts battery, and six companies of the 4th Wisconsin, under Paine, disembarked and marched up the broad levee to the familiar airs that announced the joint coming of \"Yankee Doodle\" and of \"Picayune Butler.\"  The outlying defences on both banks of the river and on the lakes were abandoned by the Confederates without a struggle.  Forts Pike and Wood, on Lake Pontchartrain, were garrisoned by detachments from the 7th Vermont and 8th New Hampshire regiments.  The 21st Indiana landed at Algiers, and marching to Brashear, eighty miles distant on Berwick Bay, took possession of the New Orleans and Opelousas railway.  New Orleans itself was occupied by the 30th and 31st Massachusetts, the 4th Wisconsin and 6th Michigan, 9th and 12th Connecticut, 4th and 6th Massachusetts batteries, 2d Vermont battery, and Troops A and B of the Massachusetts cavalry. At Farragut's approach Lovell, seeing that further resistance was useless, abandoned New Orleans to its fate and withdrew to Camp Moore, distant seventy-eight miles, on the line of the Jackson railway.   CHAPTER II. THE FIRST ATTEMPT ON VICKSBURG.  With the capture of New Orleans the first and vital object of the expedition had been accomplished.  The occupation of Baton Rouge by a combined land and naval force was the next point indicated in McClellan's orders to Butler.  Then he was to endeavor to open communication with the northern column coming down the Mississippi. McClellan was no longer General-in-chief; but this part of his plan represented the settled views of the government.  On the 2d of May, therefore, Farragut sent Craven with the _Brooklyn_ and six other vessels of the fleet up the river.  On the 8th, as early as the river transports could be secured, Butler sent Williams with the 4th Wisconsin and the 6th Michigan regiments, and two sections of Everett's 6th Massachusetts battery, to follow and accompany the fleet.  The next day Williams landed his force at Bonnet Carré, on the east bank of the river, about thirty-five miles above the town.  After wading about five miles through a swamp, where the water and mud were about three feet deep, the troops halted at night at Frenier, a station of the Jackson railway, situated on the shore of Lake Pontchartrain, about ten miles above Kenner.  A detachment of the 4th Wisconsin, under Major Boardman, was sent to Pass Manchac.  The Confederates made a slight but ineffective resistance with artillery, resulting in trivial losses on either side.  The bridges at Pass Manchac and Frenier being then destroyed, on the following morning, the 10th, the troops marched back the weary ten miles along the uneven trestle-work of the railway from Frenier to Kenner and there took transport.  After their long confinement on shipboard, with scant rations, without exercise or even freedom of movement, the excessive heat of the day caused the troops"]]]
