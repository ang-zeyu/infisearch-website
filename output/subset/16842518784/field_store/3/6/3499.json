Ex positionibus enim & distantiis rerum a corpore aliquo, quod spectamus ut immobile, definimus loca universa; deinde etiam & omnes motus æstimamus cum respectu ad prædicta loca, quatenus corpora ab iisdem transferri concipimus. Sic vice locorum & motuum absolutorum relativis utimur, nec incommode in rebus humanis: in Philosophicis autem abstrahendum est a sensibus. Fieri etenim potest ut nullum revera quiescat corpus, ad quod loca motusq; referantur.  Distinguuntur autem Quies & Motus absoluti & relativi ab invicem per eorum proprietates, causas & effectus. Quietis proprietas est, quod corpora vere quiescentia quiescunt inter se. Ideoq; cum possibile sit ut corpus aliquod in regionibus fixarum, aut longe ultra, quiescat absolute; sciri autem non possit ex situ corporum ad invicem in regionibus nostris, utrum horum aliquod ad longinquum illud datam positionem servet, quies vera ex horum situ inter se definiri nequit.  Motus proprietas est, quod partes quæ datas servant positiones ad tota, participant motus eorundem totorum. Nam gyrantium partes omnes conantur recedere de axe motus, et progredientium impetus oritur ex conjuncto impetu partium singularum. Igitur motis corporibus ambientibus, moventur quæ in ambientibus relative quiescunt. Et propterea motus verus et absolutus definiri nequit per translationem e vicinia corporum, quæ tanquam quiescentia spectantur. Debent corpora externa non solum tanquam quiescentia spectari, sed etiam vere quiescere. Alioquin inclusa omnia, præter translationem e vicinia ambientium, participabunt etiam ambientium motus veros, et sublata illa translatione non vere quiescent, sed tanquam quiescentia solummodo spectabuntur; sunt enim ambientia ad inclusa ut totius pars exterior ad partem interiorem, vel ut cortex ad nucleum. Moto autem cortice, nucleus etiam, absq; translatione de vicinia corticis, ceu pars totius, movetur.  Præcedenti proprietati affinis est, quod moto loco movetur una locatum, adeoq; corpus, quod de loco moto movetur, participat etiam loci sui motum. Igitur motus omnes, qui de locis motis fiunt, sunt partes solummodo motuum integrorum et absolutorum, et motus omnis integer componitur ex motu corporis de loco suo primo, et motu loci hujus de loco suo, et sic deinceps, usq; dum perveniatur ad locum immotum, ut in exemplo Nautæ supra memorato. Unde motus integri et absoluti non nisi per loca immota definiri possunt, et propterea hos ad loca immota, relativos ad mobilia supra retuli: Loca autem immota non sunt, nisi quæ omnia ab infinito in infinitum datas servant positiones ad invicem, atq; adeo semper manent immota, spatiumq; constituunt quod immobile appello.  Causæ, quibus motus veri et relativi distinguuntur ab invicem, sunt vires in corpora impressæ ad motum generandum. Motus verus nec generatur nec mutatur nisi per vires in ipsum corpus motum impressas: at motus relativus generari et mutari potest absq; viribus impressis in hoc corpus. Sufficit enim ut imprimantur in alia solum corpora ad quæ fit relatio, ut ijs cedentibus mutetur relatio illa in qua hujus quies vel motus relativus consistit. Rursus motus verus a viribus in corpus motum impressis semper mutatur, at motus relativus ab his viribus non mutatur necessario. Nam si eædem vires in alia etiam corpora, ad quæ fit relatio, sic imprimantur ut situs relativus conservetur, conservabitur relatio in qua motus relativus consistit. Mutari igitur potest motus omnis relativus ubi verus conservatur, et conservari ubi verus mutatur; et propterea motus verus in ejusmodi relationibus minime consistit.  Effectus quibus motus absoluti et relativi distinguuntur ab invicem, sunt vires recedendi ab axe motus circularis. Nam in motu circulari nude relativo hæ vires nullæ sunt, in vero autem et absoluto majores vel minores pro quantitate motus. Si pendeat situla a filo prælongo, agaturq; perpetuo in orbem donec filum a contorsione admodum rigescat, dein impleatur aqua, et una cum aqua quiescat; tum vi aliqua subitanea agatur motu contrario in orbem, et filo se relaxante, diutius perseveret in hoc motu: superficies aquæ sub initio plana erit, quemadmodum ante motum vasis, at postquam, vi in aquam paulatim impressa, effecit vas, ut hæc quoq; sensibiliter revolvi incipiat, recedet ipsa paulatim e medio, ascendetq; ad latera vasis, figuram concavam induens, (ut ipse expertus sum) et incitatiore semper motu ascendet magis & magis, donec revolutiones in æqualibus cum vase temporibus peragendo, quiescat in eodem relative. Indicat hic ascensus conatum recedendi ab axe motus, & per talem conatum & innotescit & mensuratur motus aquæ circularis verus & absolutus, motuiq; relativo hic omnino contrarius. Initio ubi maximus erat aquæ motus relativus in vase, motus ille nullum excitabat conatum recedendi ab axe: Aqua non petebat circumferentiam ascendendo ad latera vasis, sed plana manebat, & propterea motus illius circularis verus nondum inceperat. Postea vero ut aquæ motus relativus decrevit, ascensus ejus ad latera vasis indicabat conatum recedendi ab axe, atq; hic conatus monstrabat motum illius circularem verum perpetuo crescentem, ac tandem maximum factum ubi aqua quiescebat in vase relative. Igitur conatus iste non pendet a translatione aquæ respectu corporum ambientium, & propterea motus circularis verus per tales translationes definiri nequit. Unicus est corporis cujusq; revolventis motus vere circularis, conatui unico tanquam proprio & adæquato effectui respondens; motus autem relativi pro varijs relationibus ad externa innumeri sunt, & relationum instar, effectibus veris omnino destituuntur, nisi quatenus de vero illo & unico motu participant. Unde & in Systemate eorum qui Cælos nostros infra Cælos fixarum in orbem revolvi volunt, & Planetas secum deferre; Planetæ & singulæ Cælorum partes, qui relative quidem in Cælis suis proximis quiescunt, moventur vere. Mutant enim positiones suas ad invicem (secus quam fit in vere quiescentibus) unaq; cum cælis delati participant eorum motus, & ut partes revolventium totorum, ab eorum axibus recedere conantur.  Igitur quantitates relativæ non sunt eæ ipsæ quantitates quarum nomina præ se ferunt, sed earum mensuræ illæ sensibiles (veræ an errantes) quibus vulgus loco mensuratarum utitur. At si ex usu definiendæ sunt verborum significationes; per nomina illa Temporis, Spatij, Loci & Motus proprie intelligendæ erunt hæ mensuræ; & sermo erit insolens & pure Mathematicus si quantitates mensuratæ hic subintelligantur. Proinde vim inferunt Sacris literis qui voces hasce de quantitatibus mensuratis ibi interpretantur. Neq; minus contaminant Mathesin & Philosophiam qui quantitates veras cum ipsarum relationibus & vulgaribus mensuris confundunt.  Motus quidem veros corporum singulorum cognoscere, & ab apparentibus actu discriminare, difficillimum est; propterea quod partes spatij illius immobilis in quo corpora vere moventur, non incurrunt in sensus. Causa tamen non est prorsus desperata. Nam suppetunt argumenta partim ex motibus apparentibus, qui sunt motuum verorum differentiæ, partim ex viribus quæ sunt motuum verorum causæ & effectus. Ut si globi duo ad datam ab invicem distantiam filo intercedente connexi, revolverentur circa commune gravitatis centrum; innotesceret ex tensione fili conatus globorum recedendi ab axe motus, & inde quantitas motus circularis computari posset. Deinde si vires quælibet æquales in alternas globorum facies ad motum circularem augendum vel minuendum simul imprimerentur, innotesceret ex aucta vel diminuta fili tensione augmentum vel decrementum motus; & inde tandem inveniri possent facies globorum in quas vires imprimi deberent, ut motus maxime augeretur, id est facies posticæ, sive quæ in motu circulari sequuntur. Cognitis autem faciebus quæ sequuntur & faciebus oppositis quæ præcedunt, cognosceretur determinatio motus. In hunc modum inveniri posset & quantitas & determinatio motus hujus circularis in vacuo quovis immenso, ubi nihil extaret externum & sensibile, quocum globi conferri possent. Si jam constituerentur in spatio illo corpora aliqua longinqua datam inter se positionem servantia, qualia sunt stellæ fixæ in regionibus nostris: sciri quidem non posset ex relativa globorum translatione inter corpora, utrum his an illis tribuendus esset motus. At si attenderetur ad filum & inveniretur tensionem ejus illam ipsam esse quam motus globorum requireret; concludere liceret motum esse globorum, & tum demum ex translatione globorum inter corpora, determinationem hujus motus colligere. Motus autem veros ex eorum causis, effectibus & apparentibus differentijs colligere, & contra, ex motibus seu veris seu apparentibus, eorum causas & effectus, docebitur fusius in sequentibus.

The inevitable consequence is, that war is made throughout that unhappy continent, not only upon the slightest pretences, but often without any pretext at all. Villages are set on fire, and those who fly from the flames, rush upon the spears of the enemy. Private kidnapping is likewise carried on to a great extent, for he who can catch a neighbor's child is sure to find a ready purchaser; and it sometimes happens that the captor and his living merchandise are both seized by the white slave-trader. Houses are broken open in the night, and defenceless women and children carried away into captivity. If boys, in the unsuspecting innocence of youth, come near the white man's ships, to sell vegetables or fruit, they are ruthlessly seized and carried to slavery in a distant land. Even the laws are perverted to this shameful purpose. If a chief wants European commodities, he accuses a parent of witchcraft; the victim is tried by the ordeal of poisoned water;[A] and if he sicken at the draught, the king claims a right to punish him by selling his whole family. In African legislation, almost all crimes are punished with slavery; and thanks to the white man's rapacity, there is always a very powerful motive for finding the culprit guilty. He must be a very good king indeed, that judges his subjects impartially, when he is sure of making money by doing otherwise!  [Footnote A: Judicial trials by the ordeal of personal combat, in which the vanquished were always pronounced guilty, occurred as late as the sixteenth century, both in France and England.]  The king of Dahomy, and other despotic princes, do not scruple to seize their own people and sell them, without provocation, whenever they happen to want anything, which slave-ships can furnish. If a chief has conscience enough to object to such proceedings, he is excited by presents of gunpowder and brandy. One of these men, who could not resist the persuasions of the slave-traders while he was intoxicated, was conscience-stricken when he recovered his senses, and bitterly reproached his _Christian_ seducers. One negro king, debarred by his religion from the use of spirituous liquors, and therefore less dangerously tempted than others, abolished the slave-trade throughout his dominions and exerted himself to encourage honest industry; but his people must have been as sheep among wolves.  Relentless bigotry brings its aid to darken the horrors of the scene. The Mohammedans deem it right to subject the heathen tribes to perpetual bondage. The Moors and Arabs think Alla and the prophet have given them an undisputed right to the poor Caffre, his wife, his children, and his goods. But mark how the slave-trade deepens even the fearful gloom of bigotry! These Mohammedans are by no means zealous to enlighten their Pagan neighbors--they do not wish them to come to a knowledge of what they consider the true religion--lest they should forfeit the only ground, on which they can even pretend to the right of driving them by thousands to the markets of Kano and Tripoli.  This is precisely like our own conduct. We say the negroes are so ignorant that they must be slaves; and we insist upon keeping them ignorant, lest we spoil them for slaves. The same spirit that dictates this logic to the Arab, teaches it to the European and the American:--Call it what you please--it is certainly neither of heaven nor of earth.  When the slave-ships are lying on the coast of Africa, canoes well armed are sent into the inland country, and after a few weeks they return with hundreds of negroes, tied fast with ropes. Sometimes the white men lurk among the bushes, and seize the wretched beings who incautiously venture from their homes; sometimes they paint their skins as black as their hearts, and by this deception suddenly surprise the unsuspecting natives; at other times the victims are decoyed on board the vessel, under some kind pretence or other, and then lashed to the mast, or chained in the hold. Is it not very natural for the Africans to say \"devilish white?\"  All along the shores of this devoted country, terror and distrust prevail. The natives never venture out without arms, when a vessel is in sight, and skulk through their own fields, as if watched by a panther. All their worst passions are called into full exercise, and all their kindlier feelings smothered. Treachery, fraud and violence desolate the country, rend asunder the dearest relations, and pollute the very fountains of justice. The history of the negro, whether national or domestic, is written in blood. Had half the skill and strength employed in the slave-trade been engaged in honorable commerce, the native princes would long ago have directed their energies towards clearing the country, destroying wild beasts, and introducing the arts and refinements of civilized life. Under such influences, Africa might become an earthly paradise;--the white man's avarice has made it a den of wolves.  Having thus glanced at the miserable effects of this system on the condition of Africa, we will now follow the poor _slave_ through his wretched wanderings, in order to give some idea of his physical suffering, his mental and moral degradation.  Husbands are torn from their wives, children from their parents, while the air is filled with the shrieks and lamentations of the bereaved. Sometimes they are brought from a remote country; obliged to wander over mountains and through deserts; chained together in herds; driven by the whip; scorched by a tropical sun; compelled to carry heavy bales of merchandise; suffering with hunger and thirst; worn down with fatigue; and often leaving their bones to whiten in the desert. A large troop of slaves, taken by the Sultan of Fezzan, died in the desert for want of food. In some places, travellers meet with fifty or sixty skeletons in a day, of which the largest proportion were no doubt slaves, on their way to European markets. Sometimes the poor creatures refuse to go a step further, and even the lacerating whip cannot goad them on; in such cases, they become the prey of wild beasts, more merciful than white men.  Those who arrive at the seacoast, are in a state of desperation and despair. Their purchasers are so well aware of this, and so fearful of the consequences, that they set sail in the night, lest the negroes should know when they depart from their native shores.  And here the scene becomes almost too harrowing to dwell upon. But we must not allow our nerves to be more tender than our consciences. The poor wretches are stowed by hundreds, like bales of goods, between the low decks, where filth and putrid air produce disease, madness and suicide. Unless they die in _great_ numbers, the slave-captain does not even concern himself enough to fret; his live stock cost nothing, and he is sure of such a high price for what remains at the end of the voyage, that he can afford to lose a good many.  The following account is given by Dr. Walsh, who accompanied Viscount Strangford, as chaplain, on his embassy to Brazil. The vessel in which he sailed chased a slave-ship; for to the honor of England be it said, she has asked and obtained permission from other governments, to treat as pirates such of their subjects as are discovered carrying on this guilty trade north of the equator. Doctor Walsh was an eyewitness of the scene he describes; and the evidence given, at various times, before the British House of Commons, proves that the frightful picture is by no means exaggerated.  \"The vessel had taken in, on the coast of Africa, three hundred and thirty-six males, and two hundred and twenty-six females, making in all five hundred and sixty-two; she had been out seventeen days, during which she had thrown overboard fifty-five. They were all inclosed under grated hatchways, between decks. The space was so low, and they were stowed so close together, that there was no possibility of lying down, or changing their position, night or day. The greater part of them were shut out from light and air; and this when the thermometer, exposed to the open sky, was standing, in the shade on our deck, at eighty-nine degrees.  \"The space between decks was divided into two compartments, three feet three inches high. Two hundred and twenty-six women and girls were thrust into one space two hundred and eighty-eight feet square; and three hundred and thirty-six men and boys were crammed into another space eight hundred feet square; giving the whole an average of twenty-three inches; and to each of the women not more than thirteen inches; though several of them were in a state of health, which peculiarly demanded pity.--As they were shipped on account of different individuals, they were branded like sheep, with the owner's marks of different forms; which, as the mate informed me with perfect indifference, had been burnt in with red-hot iron. Over the hatchway stood a ferocious looking fellow, the slave-driver of the ship, with a scourge of many-twisted thongs in his hand; whenever he heard the slightest noise from below, he shook it over them, and seemed eager to exercise it.  \"As soon as the poor creatures saw us looking down at them, their melancholy visages brightened up. They perceived something of sympathy and kindness in our looks, to which they had not been accustomed; and feeling instinctively that we were friends, they immediately began to shout and clap their hands. The women were particularly excited. They all held up their arms, and when we bent down and shook hands with them, they could not contain their delight; they endeavored to scramble upon their knees, stretching up to kiss our hands, and we understood they knew we had come to liberate them. Some, however, hung down their heads in apparently hopeless dejection: some were greatly emaciated; and some, particularly children, seemed"]]]
