Wouldn't be the first time by many a hundred.\"  \"What!  When did I kick you?\"  \"Lots o' times when you was a little un, and I wouldn't let you drown yourself in the moat, or break your neck walking along the worsest parts o' the ramparts, or get yourself trod upon by the horses.  Why, I've known you kick, and squeal, and fight, and punch me as hard as ever you could.\"  \"And did it hurt you, Ben?\"  \"Hurt me, sir?  Not it.  I liked it.  Showed you was made o' good stuff, same good breed as your father; and I used to say to myself, `That young cub'll turn out as fine a soldier as his father some day, and I shall have the job o' training him.'  But deary me, deary me, old England's a-wasting all away!  You aren't got the sperrit you had, my lad; and instead o' coming to me cheery-like, and saying, `Now, Ben, get out the swords and let's have a good fence, or a bit o' back-sword or broad-sword-play, or a turn with the singlestick or staves,' you're always a-sticking your nose into musty old parchments, or dusty books, along o' Master Palgrave Pawson.  Brrr!\"  The latter was a low growl, following a loud smack given to the side of the helmet, after which, as the lad stood fretting and fuming, the old servant scrubbed away at the steel furiously.  \"It isn't true, Ben,\" the boy cried at last, indignantly; \"and perhaps I'm going to be a soldier after all, especially if this trouble goes on.\"  \"Tchaw! trouble goes on!\" said the man, changing the steel headpiece for a cuirass.  \"There won't be no trouble.  First time your father gets a sight of the mob of tailors, and shoemakers, and tinkers, with an old patch-work counterpane atop of a clothes-prop for their flag, he'll ride along the front of his ridgement of cavaliers, and he'll shout to 'em in that big voice of his as I've followed many's the time; and `Don't draw, gentlemen,' he'll say; `ride the scum down, and make the rest run;' and then they'll all roar with laughing loud enough to drown the trumpet charge.  My word, I'd a gi'n something to ha' been there to see the rebels fly like dead leaves before a wind in November.  But it were a mean and a cruel thing, Master Roy.  Look at that arm, look at these legs!  I'm a better and a stronger man than ever I was, and could sit any horse they'd put me on.  But to leave an old soldier, as had followed him as I have, at home here to rust like the rest o' things, when there was a chance for a bit o' fun, it went right to my 'art, sir, and it seemed to me as if it warn't the master as I used to sit with in the ranks.\"  The old fellow was bending now over the breastplate and rubbing hard, while as Roy listened to his excited words, wondering at the way in which he seemed to resent what he looked upon as a slight, something dropped upon the polished steel with a pat, and spread out; and Roy thought to himself that if that drop of hot salt water stayed there, it would make a deeper rust spot than anything.  But it did not stay, for the man hastily rubbed it away, and began with a rough show of indifference to hum over an old Devon song, something about \"A morn in May, to hear birds whistle and see lambkins play.\"  But he ceased as the boy laid a hand upon his shoulder, and bent over the breastplate and rubbed at it very slowly, listening intently the while.  \"Don't you get thinking that, Ben Martlet,\" said the boy, gently; \"father wanted to take you, and he said you were not too old.\"  \"Nay, nay, nay, sir; don't you get trying to ile me over.  I know.\"  \"But you don't know,\" said the boy, hotly; \"he said he should take you, but my mother asked him not to.\"  \"Ay, she would, sir.  She won't let you be a soldier, and she comes over your father as I was too old and helpless to be any good.\"  \"You're a stupid, pig-headed, old chump,\" cried Roy, angrily.  \"Yes, sir; that's it; now you're at me too.  Rusty, and worn-out, and good for nothing; but it'll soon be over.  I used to think it must be very horrid to have to die, but I know better now, and I shan't be sorry when my turn comes.\"  \"Will--you--listen to--what--I have--to say?\" cried the boy.  \"Oh, ay, sir, I'll listen.  You're my master, now Sir Granby's away, and nobody shan't say as Ben Martlet didn't do his dooty as a soldier to the end, even if he is set to dig in a garden as was once a castle court-yard.\"  \"Oh, you obstinate old mule!\" cried Roy, gripping the man's shoulders, as he stood behind him, sawing him to and fro, and driving his knee softly into the broad strong back.  \"Will you listen?\"  \"Yes, sir, I'll listen; but that's only your knee.  Kick the old worn-out mule with your boot-toe, and--\"  \"I've a good mind to,\" cried Roy.  \"Now listen: my mother begged of father to leave you here.\"  \"Oh, ay, of course.\"  \"Quiet!\" roared Roy, \"or I will really kick--hard; because she said she would feel safer, and that, if any trouble did arise with some of the men, Martlet would put it down at once, and everything would go right.\"  The cuirass went down on the dark oaken boards with a loud clang, and the old soldier sprang to his feet panting heavily.  \"Her ladyship said that?\" he cried.  \"Yes.\"  \"Say it again, sir; say it again!\" he cried, in a husky voice.  Roy repeated the words.  \"Yes, yes, sir; and what--what did Sir Granby say to that?\"  \"Said he was very sorry and very glad.\"  \"What?\"  \"Sorry to leave you, because it didn't seem natural to go back to the regiment without his right-hand man.\"  \"Right-hand man?\"  \"Yes; but he was glad my mother felt so about you, for he could go away more contented now, and satisfied that all would be right.  For though-- ahem!--he had the fullest confidence in me, I was too young to have the management of men.\"  \"Wrong, wrong, sir--wrong.  On'y want a bit o' training, and you'd make as good a captain as ever stepped.--Then it was her ladyship's doing, and she said all that?\"  \"Yes.\"  \"God bless her! my dear mistress.  Here, don't you take no notice o' this here,\" cried the rough fellow, changing his tone, and undisguisedly wiping the salt tears from his face.  \"I don't work so much as I ought, sir, and this here's only what you calls presperashum, sir, as collects, and will come out somewheres.  And so her ladyship says that, did her?\"  \"Yes, Ben.\"  \"Then why haven't I knowed this afore?  Here's three months gone by since the master went to take command of his ridgement, and I see him off.  Ay, I did send him off looking fine, and here have I been eating my heart out ever since.  Why didn't you tell me?\"  \"Oh, I don't know.  Yes, I do.  Of course, I wasn't going to tattle about what my father and mother said, but when I heard you talk as you did, and seem so cut up and unjust, why, I did.\"  \"Here, let me have it, my lad!  Kick away!  Jump on me for an old fool. Why, I'm as blind as old Jenk.  Worse.--She'd feel safer if there was any trouble.  Bless her!  Oh, what an old fool I've been.  No wonder I've got so weak and thin.\"  \"Ha, ha, ha!\"  \"What are you laughing at, sir?\"  \"You weak and thin!  Why, you're as strong as a horse.\"  \"Well, I am, Master Roy,\" said the man, with a grim smile of pride. \"But I have got a bit thin, sir.\"  \"Not a bit thinner.\"  \"Well, I aren't enjoyed my vittles since the master went, sir.  You can't contradick that.\"  \"No, and don't want to; but you did eat a four or five pound eel that you'd no right to catch.\"  \"That I didn't, sir.  I give it to poor old Jenk to make a pie.  I never tasted it.\"  \"Then you may catch as many as you like, Ben, without asking.\"  \"Thank you, sir; but I don't want to go eeling now.  Here, let's have all this fighting-tackle so as you can see your face in it.  But I say, my lad, do 'ee, now do 'ee, alter your mind; leave being statesman to them soft, smooth kind o' fellows like Master Pawson.\"  \"I don't see why one couldn't be a statesman and a soldier too,\" said the boy.  \"I don't know nothing about that sort, sir; but I do know how to handle a sword or to load a gun.  I do say, though, as you're going wrong instead of right.\"  \"How?\"  \"How, sir?  Just look at your hands.\"  \"Well, what's the matter with them?\" said the boy, holding them out.  Ben Martlet uttered a low, chuckling laugh.  \"I'll tell you, sir.  S'pose any one's badly, and the doctor comes; what does he do first?\"  \"Feels his pulse.\"  \"What else?\"  \"Looks at his tongue.\"  \"That's it, my lad; and he knows directly from his tongue what's the matter with him.  Now, you see, Master Roy, I aren't a doctor.\"  \"Not you, Ben; doctors cure people; soldiers kill 'em.\"  \"Not always, Master Roy,\" said the old fellow, whose face during the last few minutes had lit up till he seemed in the highest of glee. \"Aren't it sometimes t'other way on?  But look here: doctors look at people's tongues to see whether they wants to be physicked, or to have their arms or legs cut off.  I don't.  I looks at a man's hand to see what's the matter with him, and if I see as he's got a soft, white hand like a gal's, I know directly he's got no muscles in his arms, no spring in his back, and no legs to nip a horse's ribs or to march fifty mile in a day.  Now, just look at yours.\"  \"Oh, I can't help what my hands are like,\" said the boy, impatiently.  \"Oh, yes, you can, sir.  You've been a-neglecting of 'em, sir, horrible; so just you come to me a little more and let me harden you up a bit.  If you've got to be a statesman, you won't be none the worse for being able to fight, and ride, and run.  Now, will you? and--There's some one a-calling you, my lad.\"  \"Yes, coming!\" cried Roy; and he hurried out of the armoury into a long, dark passage, at the end of which a window full of stained glass admitted the sunbeams in a golden, scarlet, blue, and orange sheaf of rays which lit up the tall, stately figure of a lady, to whom the boy ran with a cry of--  \"Yes, mother!\"    CHAPTER TWO.  ROY'S MOTHER AND TUTOR.  \"I had missed you, Roy,\" said the lady, smiling proudly on the boy; and he looked with eyes"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25449"],["title","The Young Castellan: A Tale of the English Civil War (#2)"],["body","of pride at the beautiful woman, who now rested her arm upon his shoulder and walked by his side into the more homelike part of the old fortalice, whose grim interior had been transformed by wainscoting, hangings, carpets, stained glass, and massive oak furniture into the handsome mansion of the middle of the seventeenth century.  They passed down a broad staircase into a noble hall, and from thence into a library whose broad, low, mullioned stone window opened into what had been the inner court of the castle, whose ramparts and flanking corner towers were still there; but the echoing stones that had once paved it had given place to verdant lawn, trim flower-beds ablaze with bloom, quaintly-cut shrubs, and creepers which beautified the walls once so bare and grim.  \"I want to talk to you, Roy,\" said Lady Royland, sinking into a great formal chair.  \"Bring your stool and sit down.\"  \"Got too big for the stool, mother,\" said the boy; \"I can't double up my legs close enough.  I'll sit here.\"  He threw himself upon the thick carpet at her feet, and rested his arms upon her lap.  \"Want to talk to me?  I'd rather hear you read.\"  \"Not now, my dear.\"  \"Why, what's the matter, mother?\" said the boy, anxiously.  \"You're as white as can be.  Got one of your headaches?\"  \"No, my boy,--at least, my head does ache.  But it is my heart, Roy,--my heart.\"  \"Then you've heard bad news,\" cried the boy.  \"Oh, mother, tell me; what is it?  Not about father?\"  \"No, no; Heaven forbid, my dear,\" cried Lady Royland, wildly.  \"It is the absence of news that troubles me so.\"  \"I ought to say us,\" said Roy, angrily; \"but I'm so selfish and thoughtless.\"  \"Don't think that, my boy.  You are very young yet, but I do wish you would give more thought to your studies with Master Pawson.\"  The boy frowned.  \"I wish you'd let me read with you, mother,\" he said.  \"I understand everything then, and I don't forget it; but when that old--\"  \"Master Palgrave Pawson,\" said Lady Royland, reprovingly, but with a smile.  \"Oh, well, Master Palgrave Pawson.  P.P., P.P.  What a mouthful it seems to be!\"  \"Roy!\"  \"I've tried, mother; but I do get on so badly with him.  I can't help it; I don't like him, and he doesn't like me, and it will always be the same.\"  \"But why?  Why do you not like him?\"  \"Because--because--well, he always smiles at me so.\"  \"That does not seem as if he disliked you.  Rather the reverse.\"  \"He's so smooth and oily.\"  \"It is only his manner, my dear.  He seems to be very sincere, and to have your welfare at heart.\"  \"Yes, that's it, mother; he won't let me alone.\"  \"But he is your tutor, my dear.  You know perfectly well that he came to be your father's secretary and your tutor combined.\"  \"Yes, I know, mother,\" said the boy, impatiently; \"but somehow he doesn't seem to teach me.\"  \"But he is very studious, and tries hard.\"  \"Yes, I know.  But he seems to think I'm about seven instead of nearly seventeen, and talks to me as if I were a very little boy, and--and--and we don't get on.\"  \"This sounds very sad, Roy, and I cannot bear to have a fresh trouble now.  Your studies are so important to us.\"  Roy reached up to get his arms round his mother's neck, drew her head down, and kissed her lovingly.  \"And she shan't have any more trouble,\" he cried.  \"I'll get wonderfully fond of old Paw.\"  \"Roy!\"  \"Master Palgrave Pawson, then; and I'll work at my lessons and classics like a slave.  But you will read with me, too, mother?\"  \"As much as you like, my son.  Thank you.  That has taken away part of my load.\"  \"I wish I could take away the rest; but I know you're fidgeting because father hasn't written, and think that something has happened to him. But don't you get fancying that, because there can't be anything. They've only gone after a mob of shoemakers and tailors with a counterpane for flag, and father will scatter them all like dead leaves.\"  \"Roy!  My boy, these are not your words?\"  \"No, mother; old Ben Martlet said something of that kind to me this morning.\"  \"Does he not know, then, how serious it is?\"  \"Serious?  What do you mean by serious?\"  Lady Royland drew a deep breath, and laid her hand upon her side as if in pain.  \"Why, mother,\" repeated the boy, \"what do you mean by serious?\"  \"This trouble--this rising, my dear.  We have had no news, but Master Pawson has had letters from London, and he tells me that what was supposed to be a little petty discontent has grown into a serious revolution.\"  Roy gazed in his mother's troubled face as if he did not quite comprehend the full extent of her words.  \"Well, and if it has, mother, what then?\"  \"What then, my boy?\"  \"Yes.  You've nothing to fidget about.  Father is there with his men, and he'll soon put a stop to it all.  You know how stern he can be when people misbehave.\"  \"My dear Roy, this, I am afraid, is going to be no little trouble that your father can put down with his men.  Master Pawson tells me that there is every prospect of its being a civil war.\"  \"What!  Englishmen fighting against Englishmen?\"  \"Yes; a terrible fratricidal war.\"  \"But who has quarrelled, mother?  Oh, the king will soon stop it.\"  \"Roy, my boy, we have kept you so shut up here in this retired place for home study, instead of parting with you to send you to one of the great schools, that in some things you are as ignorant as I.\"  \"Oh, mother!\" cried the boy, laughing.  \"You ignorant!  I only wish I were half as learned and clever.  Why, father said--\"  \"Yes, yes, dear; but that is only book-learning.  We have been so happy here that the jarring troubles of politics and the court have not reached our ears; and I, for one, never gave them a thought till, after all these years of peacefulness, your father found himself compelled to obey the call of duty, and left us.  We both thought that it was only for a week or two, and then the disturbance would be at an end; but every letter he has sent me has contained worse news, till now it is nearly a month since I have heard from him.\"  \"Then it is because he is putting down the rioters,\" said Roy, quickly.  \"Rioters, my boy!  Rebels you should say, for I fear that a great attempt is to be made to overthrow the monarchy.  Master Pawson's informants assure him that this is the case, and before long, he says, there must be an encounter between the Royal and the Parliamentary troops.\"  \"Is Master Pawson right, mother?  Royal troops--Parliamentary troops? Why, they're all the same.\"  \"No, Roy; there is a division--a great division, I fear, and discontented people are taking the side against the king.\"  \"Then I'm sorry for them,\" said the boy, flushing.  \"They'll get a most terrible beating, these discontented folks.\"  \"Let us hope so, my boy, so that there may be an end to this terrible anxiety.  To those who have friends whom they love in the army, a foreign war is dreadful enough; but when I think of the possibility of a war here at home, with Englishmen striving against Englishmen, I shudder, and my heart seems to sink.\"  \"Look here,\" cried the boy, as he rose and stood with his hand resting upon his mother's shoulder, \"you've been fidgeting and fancying all sorts of things, because you haven't heard from father.\"  \"Yes, yes,\" said Lady Royland, faintly.  \"Then you mustn't, mother.  'Tis as I say; he is too busy to write, or else he hasn't found it easy to send you a letter.  I'll take the pony and ride over to Sidecombe and see when the Exeter wagon comes in. There are sure to be letters for you, and even if there are not, it will make you more easy for me to have been to see, and I can bring you back what news there is.  I'll go at once.\"  Lady Royland took hold of her son's hand and held it fast.  \"No,\" she said, making an effort to be firm.  \"We will wait another day. I have been fidgeting, dear, as you say, and it has made me nervous and low-spirited; but I'm better now for talking to you, my boy, and letting you share my trouble.  I dare say I have been exaggerating.\"  \"But I should like to ride over, mother.\"  \"You shall go to-morrow, Roy; but even then I shall be loath to let you. There, you see I am quite cheerful again.  You are perfectly right; your father is perhaps away with his men, and he may have sent, and the letter has miscarried in these troublous times.\"  \"I shouldn't like to be the man who took it, if it has miscarried,\" said the boy, laughing.  \"Poor fellow! it may have been an accident.  There, go to Master Pawson now; and Roy, my dear, don't talk about our trouble to any one for the present.\"  \"Not to old Pawson?\"  \"Master Pawson.\"  \"Not to Master Pawson?\" said Roy, smiling.  \"Not unless he speaks to you about it; then, of course, you can.\"  \"But he won't, mother.  He only talks to me about the Greek and Latin poets and about music.  I say, you don't want to see me squeezing a big fiddle between my knees and sawing at it with a bow as if I wanted to cut all the strings, do you, mother?\"  \"My dear boy, not unless you wished to learn the violoncello.\"  \"Well, I don't,\" said Roy, pettishly; \"but old Master Pawson is always bringing his out of its great green-baize bag and talking to me about it.  He says that he will instruct me, and he is sure that my father would have one sent to me from London if I asked him.  Just as if there are not noises enough in the west tower now without two of us sawing together.  _Thrrum, thrrum, throomp, throomp, throomp_!\"  Roy struck an attitude as if playing, running his left hand up and down imaginary strings while he scraped with his right, and produced no bad imitation of the vibrating strings with his mouth.  \"I should not dislike for you to play some instrument to accompany my clavichord, Roy,\" said Lady Royland, smiling at the boy's antics.  \"Very well, then; I'll learn the trumpet,\" cried the lad.  \"I'm off now to learn--not music.\"  \"One moment, Roy, my dear,\" said Lady Royland, earnestly.  \"Don't let your high spirits get the better of your discretion.\"  \"Of course not, mother.\"  \"You do not"]]]
