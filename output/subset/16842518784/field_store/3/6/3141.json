A party fell to work with frantic haste; but all their energy was wasted.  The occupants of the buried dug-out were dead when at last the spades found them . . . and broken finger-nails and bleeding finger-tips told a grisly tale of the last desperate struggle for escape and for the breath of life.  The officer covered the one convulsed face and starting eyes with his handkerchief, and a private placed a muddy cap over the other.  'Get back to your places and get down,' said the officer quietly, and the men crawled back and crouched low again.  For a full hour the line lay under the flail of the big shells that roared and shrieked overhead and thundered crashing along the trenches.  For a full hour the men barely moved, except to shift along from a spot where the shaken and crumbling parapet gave insufficient cover from the hailing shrapnel that poured down at intervals, and from the bullets that swept in and smacked venomously into the back of the trench through the shell-rifts in the parapet.  A senior officer made his way slowly along the sodden and quaking trench.  He halted beside the young officer and spoke to him a few minutes, asking what the casualties were and hoping vaguely 'they would ease off presently.'  'Can't our own guns do anything?' asked the youngster; 'or won't they let us get out and have a go at them?'  The senior nodded towards the bare stretch of muddy plough before their trench, and the tangle of barbed wire beyond.  'How many men d'you suppose would get there?' he asked.  'Some would,' said the youngster eagerly, 'and anything would be better than sticking here and getting pounded to pieces.'  'We'll see,' said the major moving off.  'They may ask us to try it presently.  And if not we'll pull through, I dare say.  See that the men keep down, and keep down yourself, Grant.  Watch out for a rush through.  This may be a preparation for something of the sort.'  He moved along, and the lad flattened himself again against the side of the wet trench.  A word from a man near him turned him round.  '. . . a 'tillery Observin' Officer comin'.  P'raps our guns are goin' for 'em at last.'  The gunner officer stumbled along the trench towards them.  Behind him came his signaller, a coil of wire and a portable telephone in a leather case slung over his shoulder.  No. 2 Platoon watched their approach with eager anticipation, and strained ears and attention to catch the conversation that passed between their officer and the artilleryman.  And a thrill of disappointment pulsed down the line at the gunner's answer to the first question put to him.  'No,' he said, 'I have orders not to fire unless they come out of the trenches to attack.  We'll give 'em gyp if they try it.  My guns are laid on their front trench and I can sweep the whole of this front with shrapnel.'  'But why not shut up their guns and put a stop to this?' asked the officer, and his platoon fervently echoed the question in their hearts.  'Not my pidgin,' said the gunner, cautiously peering through the field-glasses he levelled through a convenient loophole.  'That's the Heavies' job.  I'm Field, and my guns are too light to say much to these fellows.  Look out!' and he stooped low in the trench as the rising rush of sound told of a shell coming down near them.  'That's about an eight-inch,' he said, after the shell had fallen with a crash behind them, a spout of earth and mud leaping up and spattering down over them and fragments singing and whizzing overhead.  'Just tap in on the wire, Jackson, and raise the Battery.'  The telephonist opened his case and lifted out his instrument, groped along the trench wall a few yards and found his wire, joined up to his instruments, dashed off a series of dots and dashes on the 'buzzer,' and spoke into his mouthpiece.  No. 2 Platoon watched in fascinated silence and again gave all their attention to listening as the Artillery officer took the receiver.  '. . .  That you, Major?  . . .  Yes, this is Arbuthnot. . . .  In the forward firing trench. . . .  Yes, pretty lively . . . big stuff they're flinging mostly, and some fourteen-pounder shrap. . . .  No, no signs of a move in their trenches. . . .  All right, sir, I'll take care.  I can't see very well from here, so I'm going to move along a bit. . . .  Very well, sir, I'll tap in again higher up. . . . Good-bye.'  He handed back the instrument to the telephonist.  'Pack up again,' he said, 'and come along.'  When he had gone No. 2 Platoon turned eagerly on the telephonist, and he ran a gauntlet of anxious questions as he followed the Forward Officer.  Nine out of ten of the questions were to the same purpose, and the gunner answered them with some sharpness.  He turned angrily at last on one man who put the query in broad Scots accent.  'No,' he said tartly, 'we ain't tryin' to silence their guns.  An' if you partickler wants to know why we ain't--well, p'raps them Glasgow townies o' yours can tell you.'  He went on and No. 2 Platoon sank to grim silence.  The meaning of the gunner's words were plain enough to all, for had not the papers spoken for weeks back of the Clyde strikes and the shortage of munitions?  And the thoughts of all were pithily put in the one sentence by a private of No. 2 Platoon.  'I'd stop cheerful in this blanky 'ell for a week,' he said slowly, 'if so be I 'ad them strikers 'ere alongside me gettin' the same dose.'  All this time there had been a constant although not a heavy rifle fire on the trenches.  It had not done much damage, because the Royal Blanks were exposing themselves as little as possible and keeping low down in their narrow trenches.  But now the German rifles began to speak faster, and the fire rose to a dull roar.  The machine-guns joined in, their sharp rat-tat-tat sounding hard and distinct above the rifles. As the volume of rifle fire increased, so, for a minute, did the shell fire, until the whole line of the Royal Blanks' trenches was vibrating to the crash of the shells and humming with rifle bullets which whizzed overhead or smacked with loud whip-crack reports into the parapet.  The officer of No. 2 Platoon hitched himself higher on the parapet and hoisted a periscope over it.  Almost instantly a bullet struck it, shattering the glass to fragments.  He lowered it and hastily fitted a new glass, pausing every few moments to bob his head up over the parapet and glance hastily across at the German trench.  A second time he raised his instrument to position and in less than a minute it was shot away for a second time.  The Artillery officer came hurrying and stumbling back along the trench, his telephonist labouring behind him.  They stopped at the place where they had tapped in before and the telephonist busied himself connecting up his instrument.  The Artillery officer flung himself down beside the Platoon commander.  'My confounded wire cut again,' he panted, 'just when I want it too.  Sounds as if they meant a rush, eh?'  The infantryman nodded.  'Will they stop shelling before they rush?' he shouted.  'Not till their men are well out in front.  Their guns can keep going over their heads for a bit.  Are you through, Jackson?  Tell the Battery to \"eyes front.\"  It looks like an attack.'  The telephonist repeated the message, listened a moment and commenced, 'The Major says, sir----' when his officer interrupted sharply, 'Three rounds gun-fire--quick.'  'Three rounds gun-fire--quick, sir,' bellowed the telephonist into his mouthpiece.  'Here they come, lads.  Let 'em have it,' yelled the Platoon commander, and commenced himself to fire through a loophole.  At the same moment there came from the rear the quick thudding reports of the British guns, the rush of their shells overhead, and the sharp crash of their shells over the German parapets.  'All fired, sir,' called the telephonist.  'Battery fire one second,' the Observing Officer shouted without turning his head from his watch over the parapet.  'Number one fired--two fired--three fired,' the signaller called rapidly, and the Observing Officer watched narrowly the white cotton-wool clouds of the bursting shrapnel of his guns.  'Number three, ten minutes more right--all guns, drop twenty-five--repeat,' he ordered, and in swift obedience the guns began to drop their shrapnel showers, sweeping along the ground in front of the German trench.  But the expected rush of Germans hung fire.  A line of bobbing heads and shoulders had showed above their parapet and only a few scattered groups had clambered over its top.  'They're beat,' shouted the infantry officer, exultingly.  'They're dodging back.  Give it to 'em, boys--give it--_ow_!' He broke off and ducked down with a hand clapped to his cheek where a bullet had scored its way.  'Get down! get down!  Make your men get down,' said the gunner officer rapidly.  'It's all . . .'  Again there came the swishing rush of the light shells, a series of quick-following bangs, and a hail of shrapnel tearing across the trench, before the men had time to duck.  'All a false alarm--just a dodge to get your men's heads up within reach of their Fizz-Bangs' shrapnel,' said the artilleryman, and called to the signaller.  'All guns raise twenty-five.  Section fire five seconds. . . .  Hullo--hit?' he continued to the Platoon officer, as he noticed him wiping a smear of blood from his cheek.  'Just a nice little scratch,' said the lad, grinning.  'Enough to let me swank about being wounded and show off a pretty scar to my best girl when the war's over.'  'Afraid that last shrapnel burst gave some of your fellows more'n a pretty scar,' said the gunner.  'But I suppose I'd better slow my guns up again. . . .  Jackson, tell them the attack's evidently stopped--section fire ten seconds.'  'Can't you keep on belting 'em for a bit?' asked the Platoon officer. 'Might make 'em ease up on us.'  The gunner shook his head "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25079"],["title","Queensland Cousins (#1)"],["body","up here in the house, and you won't feel so lonely at night.\"  \"Oh no, no,\" Mrs. Orban said, \"don't do that. They have both got their wives and families to look after. Eustace will be an efficient man of the house and companion to his mummie--won't you, son?\"  \"I'll do my best,\" Eustace said soberly.  To be quite honest, he was as startled as his mother at his father's announcement; he did not like the idea at all. He had caught that curious look in his mother's eyes, and it troubled him.  But Nesta was too much taken up with the thought of the parcel to notice anything except the delay in opening it.  \"Couldn't we go on?\" she pleaded.  \"Poor Nesta,\" said Mr. Orban, beginning to cut the sewing, \"is it getting beyond your patience altogether? Well, here goes then!\"  Inside the American cloth was yet another wrapper, this time of linen sewn up most carefully, and within that paper after paper. The excitement grew more and more tense, till at last, when they came to a series of neat packages, each with a label to say from whom and to whom the gift was, every one except Becky was beyond speaking point.  The joys that parcel contained were indescribable, because no child born and bred in England could be made to understand how wonderful, how undreamed of, how surprising were the most ordinary things to those four Bush children. They lived right out of the world, and had spent most of their lives on a sugar plantation in North Queensland; the common things of our everyday existence were marvels to them.  A clockwork train sent out to Peter with a hope that \"he was not too old for it\" fascinated Eustace, despite his four years' seniority; the exquisite little doll's dinner service for Becky set Nesta longing to play with it and cook pretence dinners for it.  There was something for every one, and the children's eyes shone with pleasure; but Mrs. Orban's were dim as, the unpacking over, she turned quietly away and disappeared into the house.  In the midst of turning the pages of his new book to look for pictures, Eustace missed her, and shortly after Mr. Orban went away too.  \"Oh!\" Eustace exclaimed, slamming his book together with a big sigh, \"I do wish parcels from England didn't always make mother sad.\"  \"I guess she wants to see grannie and Aunt Dorothy badly,\" Nesta suggested.  \"Oh, it is more than that,\" Eustace said, getting up and moving restlessly about. \"I sometimes think she simply hates this place and everything to do with it.\"  \"Do you, Eustace?\" asked Peter, his eyes round with wonder.  \"Well, it is fearfully dull, isn't it?\" Nesta said. \"England must be quite different. English stories always make me ache to go there. It must be so awfully interesting, mustn't it?\"  \"Wouldn't it be splendid if father said suddenly one day we could all go to England!\" Peter cried excitedly.  \"I don't think there is the least chance of that,\" Eustace said. \"You heard what he said about its being too expensive to take us even to Brisbane. It would cost ten times as much to go to England.\"  \"I say,\" Nesta said quickly, \"I wonder why father has to go to Brisbane in such a hurry? Don't you, Eustace?\"  \"I haven't thought about it,\" Eustace answered. \"But, anyhow, mother doesn't like his going--that's very clear.\"  \"Doesn't she?\" Nesta asked in a surprised voice. \"How _do_ you know?\"  \"Didn't you see her face when father said he must go?\" Eustace asked with a touch of impatience.  Nesta shook her head.  \"Oh!\" was all Eustace exclaimed; then he turned, and resting his elbows on the railings, stared straight ahead with unseeing eyes.  The Orbans' house was built on the top of an isolated hill three hundred feet above a valley which, except where the scrub had been cleared for the growing of sugar-cane, was thickly wooded. On three sides of the valley, stretching round like a great horse-shoe, lay range upon range of hills, now softest purple. The fourth side, on which the boy gazed, was bounded by the sea--a shimmering patch of blue. No scene could have been grander, none more infinitely lonely. But Eustace was not thinking about it either admiringly or otherwise.  Nesta joined her brother, and stared curiously at his unusually serious face.  \"What do you mean, Eustace?\" she demanded.  He did not speak, so she put her hand on his shoulder and gave him a little shake.  \"What are you thinking about?\" she asked.  \"Mother,\" Eustace said quite shortly.  \"Yes, I know,\" Nesta said; \"but what about her?\"  \"Father's going away,\" Eustace said.  \"Of course,\" Nesta said, rather scornfully; \"you told me that before. And I know mother will be dreadfully dull without him.\"  \"Dull!\" exclaimed Eustace, knocking the tips of his toes impatiently against the woodwork.  \"Yes, dull,\" said the girl.  \"Worse than dull,\" Eustace responded soberly.  \"But we can do our best to cheer her up till he comes back.\"  Eustace turned slowly round until he was staring right into Nesta's eyes, and his look was so queer that she was startled.  \"Do you mean to say you don't understand?\" he said solemnly.  \"No, I certainly don't,\" Nesta replied.  Eustace wheeled quickly back to the railing, gazing seaward again.  \"Then I'm not going to tell you,\" he said decidedly.  Nesta stood blankly wondering for a moment.  \"Well, it's hateful of you,\" she began; then suddenly her expression changed. \"Eustace,\" she exclaimed, grabbing his arm with both hands, \"do you mean mother will be frightened?\"  \"I'm not going to tell you,\" repeated the boy with seeming obstinacy.  But Nesta's face was full of certainty.  \"It _is_ that!\" she said with conviction. \"You think she will be scared at being left.\"  Now Eustace had suddenly begun to repent of having said so much. He had not the least desire to frighten Nesta; he had honestly believed that she must have noticed what he did in their mother's tone and look, but now he realized Nesta had not understood. He stood silent, regretting his carelessness.  \"O Eustace,\" Nesta cried, \"of course it is that. How dreadful! I remember now what father said--he knew mother might be frightened, and that is why he offered to have Farley or Robertson up.\"  There was terror in Nesta's voice now, and Eustace rounded sharply upon her.  \"I say, shut up!\" he said, with a glance towards Peter, who was too engrossed with his train at the other side of the veranda to be listening. \"You don't want to frighten the kids, do you? Besides, father said we should be all right, and he knows.\"  \"But mother was frightened,\" Nesta said, looking unconvinced.  \"She didn't say so,\" Eustace argued. \"She refused to have either of the men up, you see. That doesn't look much like funking it.\"  \"Then what did you mean?\" demanded Nesta.  \"Oh, never mind,\" Eustace said, throwing himself into a chair and reopening his book. \"Don't let's talk about it.\"  \"That is nonsense,\" Nesta said. \"How can I help minding about a thing like that?\"  \"Well, but what's the good of talking?\" Eustace exclaimed. \"Dad has to go; we can't prevent that if we talk for ever.\"  \"Yes; but if it is dangerous--\" Nesta began in a low, awe-struck voice.  \"Dangerous!\" Eustace repeated. \"What could there be dangerous about it?\"  \"You know as well as I do,\" Nesta replied. \"Supposing the blacks were to come down on us in the night when we were here all alone!\"  \"Oh, do shut up!\" Eustace said sharply. \"Why should the blacks happen to come just because father is away? They may not even be in the neighbourhood.\"  \"Yes; but you remember that horrid story Kate told us,\" Nesta said, almost whispering. \"The father was away--there were nothing but women and children in the house--\"  \"Oh, stop, Nesta!\" Eustace said. \"Of course I remember all about it. I don't want to hear the beastly thing all over again. What is the good of frightening ourselves all for nothing? Don't you know that father wouldn't go if he could possibly help it? And if he must go, we've got to make the best of it, that's all. Now I'm going to read, so do shut up.\"  Nesta stood silently staring at him a moment, but he seemed already to have forgotten her very existence.  \"Well, you are a queer boy,\" she said, in what the boys always called her \"huffy\" voice.  Still Eustace took no notice.  \"Perhaps you will be sorry some day,\" Nesta said with a little gulp, and turned away to Becky, who was calling her.  Eustace was apparently engrossed in his book, but not a word did he see on the page he stared at so intently. He had done a stupid thing, and he regretted it, for the mischief was past remedy now. Quite unintentionally he had made Nesta as nervous as he was himself, and he knew that nothing he might say would reassure her. He was quite right that there was no use in talking about it; he felt sure that his father would say he ought not to have said so much, and he was vexed with himself for his carelessness. Silence seemed the only course open to him--silence on the subject for the present, and for the future a great, whole-hearted resolve to play the man come what might.     CHAPTER II.  BOB.   Eustace was right: their father would not have gone to Brisbane had it not been necessary; but this was not because Mr. Orban was troubled by any fears for the safety of his family. He had lived so long in North Queensland that he was used to the solitude, and thought nothing of the dangers surrounding them. It distressed him to have to go away simply because he knew that his wife would be terribly nervous without him. Fifteen years in the colony had not accustomed her to the loneliness of their position.  Besides the two engineers, and the field manager, Mr. Ashton, who all lived at the foot of the hill, the Orbans had no white neighbours nearer than five miles off. The field hands were coloured men of some five or six different races, chiefly Chinese or Malays--the good-for-nothing riff-raff of their own countries come to seek a living elsewhere.  There was no society, no constant dropping in of friends, nothing to relieve the monotony of daily life. But none of"]]]
