He was making the baskets out of rushes and he was biting them off with his teeth. He looked up and spied Mr. Rabbit with the knife in his mouth.  \"O, please, Mr. Rabbit,\" said he, \"will you not be so kind as to let me borrow that sharp knife you are carrying? It is very hard work to bite the rushes off with my teeth.\"  Mr. Rabbit let him take the knife. He started to cut off the rushes with it, when _snap_ went the knife! It broke into halves.  \"O, dear! O, dear!\" cried Mr. Rabbit. \"What shall I do! What shall I do! You have broken my nice new knife.\"  The little old man said that he was very sorry and that he did not mean to do it.  Then Mr. Rabbit said, \"A broken knife is of no use to me but perhaps you can use it, even if it is broken. I'll tell you what I'll do. I'll let you keep the knife if you will give me one of your baskets in exchange for it.\"  The little old man gave Mr. Rabbit a basket and he started on through the deep forest with it. \"I lost my tail but I gained a knife. I've lost my knife but I've gained a basket,\" said he. \"I'll get a new tail or something else just as good.\"  Mr. Rabbit hopped along through the deep forest for a long time until at last he came to a clearing. Here there was an old woman busily engaged in picking lettuce. When she had gathered it she put it into her apron. She looked up and spied Mr. Rabbit hopping along with his basket.  \"O, please, Mr. Rabbit,\" said she, \"will you not be so kind as to let me borrow that nice basket you are carrying?\"  Mr. Rabbit let her take the basket. She began to put her lettuce into it when out fell the bottom of the basket.  \"O, dear! O, dear!\" cried Mr. Rabbit. \"What shall I do! What shall I do! You have broken the bottom out of my nice new basket.\"  The old woman said that she was very sorry and that she did not mean to do it.  Then said Mr. Rabbit, \"I'll tell you what I'll do. I'll let you keep that broken basket if you will give me some of your lettuce.\"  The old woman gave Mr. Rabbit some lettuce and he hopped along with it, saying, \"I lost my tail but I gained a knife. I lost my knife but I gained a basket. I lost my basket but I gained some lettuce.\"  The rabbit was getting very hungry and how nice the lettuce smelled! He took a bite. It was just the very best thing he had ever tasted in all his life. \"I don't care if I did lose my tail,\" said he, \"I've found something I like very much better.\"  From that day to this no rabbit has ever had a tail. Neither has there ever been a rabbit who cared because he had no tail. From that time to this there has never been a rabbit who did not like lettuce to eat and who was not perfectly happy and contented if there was plenty of it.     III  How the Toad Got His Bruises   Once upon a time, ages and ages ago, the toad had a smooth skin. In those days he was a great gad about. He never could be found in his own house. If any one had a party he was sure to go, no matter how far away from home it was held, or how long it took to get there.  One day the toad received an invitation to attend a party in the sky. \"You never can get to this party,\" said his friend, the armadillo. \"You know how slowly you travel here upon earth.\"  \"Wait and see whether or not I go to the party,\" said the toad.  Not far from the toad's house there lived a big black buzzard. No one liked the buzzard. He was very unpopular with all the birds and beasts. The toad hopped over to the buzzard's house. The buzzard was outside the door making music on his violin.  \"Good morning, Friend Buzzard,\" said the toad. \"Are you going to attend the party in the sky?\"  The buzzard replied that he was planning to go.  \"That is good,\" said the toad. \"May I have the pleasure of your company for the trip?\"  The buzzard was delighted to have the toad seek his company. It was a new experience.  \"I'll be charmed to go to the party with you,\" replied the buzzard. \"What time shall we start?\"  \"We'll start at four o'clock,\" said the toad. \"Come to my house and we'll go on from there. Be sure to bring your violin with you.\"  Promptly at four o'clock the buzzard arrived at the toad's house. He had his violin with him, of course, because the toad had asked him to bring it.  \"I'm not quite ready to go,\" the toad called out. \"Just leave your violin there by the door and step inside. It will take me only a minute to finish my toilet.\"  The buzzard laid his violin carefully outside the door and went inside the toad's house. The toad jumped through the window and hid himself inside the violin.  The buzzard waited and waited for the toad to get ready but he did not hear a word from the toad. Finally he got tired of waiting. He picked up his violin and started.  When he arrived at the party he was a trifle late but he explained how he had waited for the toad.  \"How foolish to wait a minute for the toad,\" said his hosts. \"How could the toad ever get to a party in the sky? We just asked him as a joke because he is such a great gad about. Lay down your violin and come to the feast.\"  The buzzard laid down his violin. As soon as there was no one looking, out hopped the toad. He was laughing from ear to ear. \"So they thought I would not come to the party! What a joke! How surprised they will be to see me here!\" he said.  There was nobody at the feast who was as gay as the toad. When the buzzard asked how he arrived he said: \"I'll tell you some other day.\" Then he went on eating and dancing.  The buzzard did not have a very good time at the party. He decided that he would go home early. He went away without saying good-bye to his hosts and without taking his violin with him.  At the end of the party the toad hopped inside the violin and waited and waited for the buzzard to take him home. Nobody picked up the violin and the toad began to be very much worried. He almost wished he had not come.  After a while the falcon noticed the violin. \"That violin belongs to the buzzard. He must have forgotten to take it home. I'll carry it back for him,\" he said.  The falcon flew towards earth with the violin. The toad shook about terribly inside of the violin. He got very tired. The falcon got tired, too.  \"I'm not going to carry this heavy old violin of the buzzard's another minute,\" said the falcon. \"I was foolish to offer to carry it in the first place. The buzzard is no friend of mine.\"  He let the violin fall. Down, down toward earth it fell.  \"O, little stones, O, little stones, get out of my way,\" called the toad as he fell. The little stones had deaf ears. They did not get out of the way.  When the toad crawled out of the wrecked violin he was so covered with bruises that he could hardly hop home.  The buzzard never knew what became of his violin or why the toad had lost his good looks. To this very day the toad shows his bruises. And he is entirely cured of being a gad about.     IV  How the Tiger Got His Stripes   Once upon a time, ages and ages ago, so long ago that the tiger had no stripes upon his back and the rabbit still had his tail, there was a tiger who had a farm. The farm was very much overgrown with underbrush and the owner sought a workman to clear the ground for him to plant.  The tiger called all the beasts together and said to them when they had assembled, \"I need a good workman at once to clear my farm of the underbrush. To the one of you who will do this work I offer an ox in payment.\"  The monkey was the first one to step forward and apply for the position. The tiger tried him for a little while but he was not a good workman at all. He did not work steadily enough to accomplish anything. The tiger discharged him very soon and he did not pay him.  Then the tiger hired the goat to do the work. The goat worked faithfully enough but he did not have the brains to do the work well. He would clear a little of the farm in one place and then he would go away and work on another part of it. He never finished anything neatly. The tiger discharged him very soon without paying him.  Next the tiger tried the armadillo. The armadillo was very strong and he did the work well. The trouble with him was that he had such an appetite. There were a great many ants about the place and the armadillo could never pass by a sweet tender juicy ant without stopping to eat it. It was lunch time all day long with him. The tiger discharged him and sent him away without paying him anything.  At last the rabbit applied for the position. The tiger laughed at him and said, \"Why, little rabbit, you are too small to do the work. The monkey, the goat, and the armadillo have all failed to give satisfaction. Of course a little beast like you will fail too.\"  However, there were no other beasts who applied for the position so the tiger sent for the rabbit and told him that he would try him for a little while.  The rabbit worked faithfully and well, and soon he had cleared a large portion of the ground. The next day he worked just as well. The tiger thought that he had been very lucky to hire the rabbit. He got tired staying around to watch the rabbit work. The rabbit seemed to know just how to do the work anyway, without orders, so the tiger decided to go away on a hunting trip. He left his son to watch the rabbit.  After the tiger had gone away the rabbit said to the tiger's son, \"The ox which your father is going to give me is marked with a white spot on his left ear and another on his right side, isn't he?\"  \"O, no,\" replied the tiger's son. \"He is red all over with just a tiny white spot on his right ear.\"  The rabbit worked for a while longer and then he said, \"The ox which your father is going to give me is kept by the river, isn't "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24714"],["title","Fairy Tales from Brazil: How and Why Tales from Brazilian Folk-Lore (#2)"],["body","he?\"  \"Yes,\" replied the tiger's son.  The rabbit had made a plan to go and get the ox without waiting to finish his work. Just as he started off he saw the tiger returning. The tiger noticed that the rabbit had not worked so well when he was away. After that he stayed and watched the rabbit until the whole farm was cleared. Then the tiger gave the rabbit the ox as he had promised.  \"You must kill this ox,\" he said to the rabbit, \"in a place where there are neither flies nor mosquitoes.\"  The rabbit went away with the ox. After he had gone for some distance he thought he would kill him. He heard a cock, however, crowing in the distance and he knew that there must be a farm yard near. There would be flies of course. He went on farther and again he thought that he would kill the ox. The ground looked moist and damp and so did the leaves on the bushes. Since the rabbit thought there would be mosquitoes there he decided not to kill the ox. He went on and on and finally he came to a high place where there was a strong breeze blowing. \"There are no mosquitoes here,\" he said to himself. \"The place is so far removed from any habitation that there are no flies, either.\" He decided to kill the ox.  Just as he was ready to eat the ox, along came the tiger. \"O, rabbit, you have been such a good friend of mine,\" said the tiger, \"and now I am so very, very hungry that all my ribs show, as you yourself can see. Will you not be a good kind rabbit and give me a piece of your ox?\"  The rabbit gave the tiger a piece of the ox. The tiger devoured it in the twinkling of an eye. Then he leaned back and said, \"Is that all you are going to give me to eat?\"  The tiger looked so big and savage that the rabbit did not dare refuse to give him any more of the ox. The tiger ate and ate and ate until he had devoured that entire ox. The rabbit had been able to get only a tiny morsel of it. He was very, very angry at the tiger.  One day not long after the rabbit went to a place not far from the tiger's house and began cutting down big staves of wood. The tiger soon happened along and asked him what he was doing.  \"I'm getting ready to build a stockade around myself,\" replied the rabbit. \"Haven't you heard the orders?\" The tiger said that he hadn't heard any orders.  \"That is very strange,\" said the rabbit. \"The order has gone forth that every beast shall fortify himself by building a stockade around himself. All the beasts are doing it.\"  The tiger became very much alarmed. \"O, dear! O, dear! What shall I do,\" he cried. \"I don't know how to build a stockade. I never could do it in the world. O, good rabbit! O, kind rabbit! You are such, a very good friend of mine. Couldn't you, as a great favour, because of our long friendship, build a stockade about me before you build one around yourself?\"  The rabbit replied that he could not think of risking his own life by building the tiger's fortifications first. Finally, however, he consented to do it.  The rabbit cut down great quantities of long sharp sticks. He set them firmly in the ground about the tiger. He fastened others securely over the top until the tiger was completely shut in by strong bars. Then he went away and left the tiger.  The tiger waited and waited for something to happen to show him the need of the fortifications. Nothing at all happened.  He got very hungry and thirsty. After a while the monkey passed that way.  The tiger called out, \"O, monkey, has the danger passed?\"  The monkey did not know what danger the tiger meant, but he replied, \"Yes.\"  Then the tiger said, \"O, monkey, O, good, kind monkey, will you not please be so kind as to help me out of my stockade?\"  \"Let the one who got you in there help you out,\" replied the monkey and he went on his way.  Along came the goat and the tiger called out, \"O, goat, has the danger passed?\"  The goat did not know anything about any danger, but he replied, \"Yes.\"  Then the tiger said, \"O, goat, O, good kind goat, please be so kind as to help me out of my stockade.\"  \"Let the one who got you in there help you out,\" replied the goat as he went on his way.  Along came the armadillo and the tiger called out, \"O, armadillo, has the danger passed?\"  The armadillo had not heard of any danger, but he replied that it had passed.  Then the tiger said, \"O, armadillo, O, good, kind armadillo, you have always been such a good friend and neighbour. Please help me now to get out of my stockade.\"  \"Let the one who got you in there help you out,\" replied the armadillo as he went on his way.  The tiger jumped and jumped with all his force at the top of the stockade, but he could not break through. He jumped and jumped with all his might at the front side of the stockade, but he could not break through. He thought that never in the world would he be able to break out. He rested for a little while and as he rested he thought. He thought how bright the sun was shining outside. He thought what good hunting there was in the jungle. He thought how cool the water was at the spring. Once more he jumped and jumped with all his might at the back side of the stockade. At last he broke through. He did not get through, however, without getting bad cuts on both his sides from the sharp edges of the staves. Until this day the tiger has stripes on both his sides.     V  Why the Lamb Is Meek   Once upon a time there was a little lamb frisking gaily about the pasture. The bright sunshine and the soft breezes made him very happy. He had just finished a hearty meal and that made him happy too. He was the very happiest little lamb in all the world and he thought that he was the most wonderful little lamb.  A big toad sat on the ground and watched him. After a while the toad said: \"O, little lamb, how are you feeling today?\"  The lamb replied that he had never felt better in all his life.  \"Even though you are feeling very strong I can pull you into the sea,\" said the toad.  The little lamb laughed and laughed until he rolled over on the ground.  \"Just take hold of this rope and I'll show you how easy it is to pull you into the sea,\" said the toad.  The lamb took hold of the rope. Then the toad said, \"Please wait a minute while I get a good long distance away from you. I can pull better when I'm not too near you.\"  The lamb waited and the toad hopped down to the sea. He hopped up into a tree which hung over the water's edge and from there he hopped on to the whale's back. He fastened the end of the rope around the whale and then he called out to the lamb: \"All ready. Now we'll see how hard you can pull.\"  When the whale felt the lamb pulling at the rope he swam away from the shore. No matter how hard the lamb pulled or how much force he exerted it did not do one bit of good. He was dragged down to the water's edge as easily as could be.  \"I give up,\" said the lamb as he reached the water's edge.  After that, although the sunshine was just as bright as ever, any one who watched that little lamb could see that he was a little more meek.  One day not long afterwards the sunshine was again very bright and the little lamb was again feeling frisky. He was so happy and gay that he had forgotten all about how the toad had pulled him down to the water until the toad spoke to him. Then he remembered.  \"O, little lamb, how are you feeling today?\" asked the toad. The little lamb replied that he was very well.  \"Let us run a race,\" said the toad, \"I think I can beat you.\"  \"You may be strong enough to pull me into the sea,\" said the lamb, \"but surely I can run faster than you. I've watched you hopping about my pasture. You can't run fast at all. However, I'll gladly run a race with you to prove what I say.\"  The toad set a goal and told the lamb to call out every little while during the race so he could see how much farther ahead the lamb was. Then the toad and the lamb started.  The toad had assembled all his brothers and his sisters and his cousins and his uncles and his aunts before the race and had stationed them at various points along the path of the race. He had told them that whenever any of them should hear the lamb calling out, \"Laculay, laculay, laculay,\" the toad which was nearest should answer, \"Gulugubango, bango lay.\"  The lamb ran and ran as fast as he could. Then he remembered his promise and called out, \"Laculay, laculay, laculay.\" He expected to hear the toad answer from a long, long distance behind him. He was much surprised to hear some one near him answer, \"Gulugubango, bango lay.\" After that he ran faster than ever.  After running on for some distance farther the lamb again called out, \"Laculay, laculay, laculay.\" Again he heard the answer at only a short distance away, \"Gulugubango, bango lay.\" He ran and ran until his little heart was beating so fast that it seemed as if it would burst. At last he arrived at the goal of the race which the toad had set and there sat the toad's brother who looked so much like him that the lamb couldn't tell them apart. The lamb went back to his pasture very meekly and quietly. He acknowledged that he had been beaten in the race.  The next morning the toad said to him, \"Even though you did not run fast enough to win the race, still you are a very fast runner. I have told the daughter of the king about you and I have said to her that some day she shall see me riding on your back with a bridle in your mouth as if you were my horse.\"  The lamb was very angry. \"Perhaps you are strong enough to pull me into the sea, and perhaps you can beat me when we run a race,\" said the lamb, \"but never, never in the world will I be your horse.\"  Time passed and the sunshine was very bright and the soft, gentle breezes were very sweet. The lamb was so happy again that he forgot all about how the toad had pulled him into the sea, and how the toad had beaten him at running the race. He was very sorry for the toad when he saw him all humped up in a disconsolate little heap one day. \"O, poor toad, are you sick?\" he asked. \"Isn't there something I can"]]]
