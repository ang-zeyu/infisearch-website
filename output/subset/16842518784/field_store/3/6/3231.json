Actually, it could be found eventually with the D-N beryllium as a guide. But the _Mavis_ was in orbit around Fomalhaut V for two weeks before we found the D-N beryllium deposit, and the Service feels that we shouldn't waste any time.\"  The lieutenant sat down, and General Scarborough resumed his place on the platform.         *       *       *       *       *  \"That's the situation,\" Scarborough said bluntly. \"You know the setup, now--and I think some of you see how your specialities are going to fit into the operation. As Lieutenant Jervis pointed out, we don't know what killed the crew of the _Mavis_; therefore, we are going to take every possible precaution. As far as we know, there are no inimical life forms on Fomalhaut V--but it's possible that there are things we don't know about, such as airborne viruses that kill in a very short time. If so, then Lieutenant Jervis is immune to the virus and is not a transmitter or carrier of it.  \"However, to guard against such a possibility, no one will leave the _Lord Nelson_, once it has landed, without wearing a spacesuit. The air is breathable, but we're taking no chances. Also, no one will go out alone; scouting parties will always be in pairs, with wide open communication with the ship. And at no time will more than ten percent of the ship's company be outside at any one time.\"  Wayne made a rough mental computation. _The_ Lord Nelson _holds sixty. That means no more than six out at any single time. They really must be worried._  \"Aside from those orders, which were decided on by the Service Command, you'll be under the direct orders of Colonel Nels Petersen. Colonel Petersen.\"  Petersen was a tall, hard-faced man with a touch of gray at his temples. He stepped forward and stared intently at the assembled crew.         *       *       *       *       *  \"Our job is to make the preliminary preparations for getting D-N beryllium out of the crust of Fomalhaut V. We're supposed to stay alive while we do it. Therefore, our secondary job is to find out what it was that killed the scouting expedition of the _Mavis_. There are sixty of us going aboard the _Lord Nelson_ tomorrow, and I'd like to have sixty aboard when we come back. Got that?\"  He leaned forward, stretched upward on his toes, and smiled mechanically. \"Fine. Now, you all know your jobs, but we're going to have to work together as a team. We're going to have to correlate our work so that we'll know what we're doing. So don't think we won't have anything to do during the two weeks it will take us to get to Fomalhaut V. We're going to work it as though it were a shakedown cruise. If anyone doesn't work out, he'll be replaced, even if we have to turn around and come back to Earth. On a planet which has wiped out a whole scouting expedition, we can't afford to have any slip-ups. And that means we can't afford to have anyone aboard who doesn't know what he's doing or doesn't care. Is that clear?\"  It was.  \"All right,\" said the colonel. \"Let's go out and get acquainted with the _Lord Nelson_.\"         *       *       *       *       *  The briefing session broke up well past midnight, and the group that shortly would become the crew of the _Lord Nelson_ filtered out of the building and into the cool spring air. Each man had a fairly good idea of his job and each man knew the dangers involved. No one had backed out.  \"What d'ye think of it, Pete?\" Sherri James asked, as they left together. \"Sounds pretty mean.\"  \"I wish we knew what the answers were beforehand,\" Wayne said. He glanced down at Sherri. The moon was full, and its rays glinted brightly off her golden hair. \"It's a risky deal, as Petersen said. Nine men go out, and eight die--of what? Just dead, that's all.\"  \"It's the way the game goes,\" Sherri said. \"You knew that when you joined the corps.\" They turned down the main road of the IES compound and headed for the snack bar.  Wayne nodded. \"I know, kid. It's a job, and it has to be done. But nobody likes to walk into an empty planet like that knowing that eight of the last nine guys who did didn't come back.\"  He put his arm around her and they entered the snack bar that way. Most of the other crew-members were there already; Wayne sensed the heightening tenseness on their faces.  \"Two nuclear fizzes,\" he said to the pfc at the bar. \"With all the trimmings.\"  \"What's the matter, Captain?\" said a balding, potbellied major a few stools down, who was nursing a beer. \"How come the soft drinks tonight, Wayne?\"  Peter grinned. \"I'm in training, Major Osborne. Gotta kill the evil green horde from Rigel Seven, and I don't dare drink anything stronger than sarsaparilla.\"  \"How about the amazon, then?\" Osborne said, gesturing at Sherri. \"Her too?\"  \"Me too,\" Sherri said.  Osborne stared at his beer. \"You two must be in Scarborough's new project, then.\" He squinted at Peter, who nodded almost imperceptibly.  \"You'll need luck,\" Osborne said.  \"No we won't,\" Wayne said. \"Not luck. We'll need more than just luck to pull us through.\"  The nuclear fizzes arrived. He began to sip it quietly. A few more members of the crew entered the snack bar. Their faces were drawn tensely.  He guzzled the drink and looked up at Sherri, who was sucking down the last of the soda. \"Let's get going, Lieutenant James. The noncoms are coming, and we don't want them to make nasty remarks about us.\"         *       *       *       *       *  The _Lord Nelson_ blasted off the next evening, after a frenzied day of hurried preparations. The crew of sixty filed solemnly aboard, Colonel Petersen last, and the great hatch swung closed.  There was the usual routine loudspeaker-business while everyone quickly and efficiently strapped into his acceleration cradle, and then the ship leaped skyward. It climbed rapidly, broke free of Earth's grasp, and, out past the moon, abruptly winked out of normal space into overdrive. It would spend the next two weeks in hyperspace, short-cutting across the galaxy to Fomalhaut V.  It was a busy two weeks for everyone involved. Captain Peter Wayne, as a central part of the team, spent much of his time planning his attack. His job would be the actual climbing of the mountain where the double-nucleus beryllium was located. It wasn't going to be an easy job; the terrain was rough, the wind, according to Jervis, whipped ragingly through the hills, and the jagged peaks thrust into the air like the teeth of some mythical dragon.  Study of the three-dimensional aerial photographs taken from the _Mavis_ showed that the best route was probably up through one end of the valley, through a narrow pass that led around the mountain, and up the west slope, which appeared to offer better handholds and was less perpendicular than the other sides of the mountain.  This time, the expedition would have the equipment to make the climb. There were ropes, picks, and crampons, and sets of metamagnetic boots and grapples. With metamagnetic boots, Wayne thought, they'd be able to walk up the side of the mountain almost as easily as if it were flat.  He studied the thick, heavy soles of the boots for a moment, then set to work polishing. Wayne liked to keep his boots mirror-bright; it wasn't required, but it was a habit of his nonetheless.  He set to work vigorously. Everyone aboard the ship was working that way. Sherri James, who was in charge of the Correlation Section, had noticed the same thing the day before. Her job was to co-ordinate all the information from various members of the expedition, run them through the computers, and record them. She had been busy since blastoff, testing the computers, checking and rechecking them, being overly efficient.  \"I know why we're doing it,\" she said. \"It keeps our mind off the end of the trip. When we spend the whole day working out complicated circuits for the computers, or polishing mountain boots, or cleaning the jet tubes, it's just so we don't have to think about Fomalhaut V. It helps to concentrate on details.\"  Wayne nodded and said nothing. Sherri was right. There was one thought in everyone's mind: what was the deadly secret of the valley?  There was another thought, after that:  _Will we find it out in time?_         *       *       *       *       *  After two weeks of flight through the vast blackness of interstellar space, the _Lord Nelson_ came out of overdrive and set itself in an orbit around Fomalhaut V. Lieutenant Jervis, the sole survivor of the ill-fated _Mavis_, located the small valley between the giant crags that covered the planet, and the huge spherical bulk of the spaceship settled gently to the floor of the valley.  They were gathered in the central room of the ship ten minutes after the _all-clear_ rang through the corridors, informing everyone that the landing had been safely accomplished. From the portholes they could see the white bones of the _Mavis's_ crew lying on the reddish sand of the valley bottom.  \"There they are,\" Jervis said quietly. \"Just bones. Those were my shipmates.\"  Wayne saw Sherri repress a shudder. Little heaps of bones lay here and there on the sand, shining brightly in the hot sun. That was the crew of the _Mavis_--or what was left of them.  Colonel Petersen entered the room and confronted the crew. \"We're here,\" he said. \"You know the schedule from now on. No one's to leave the ship until we've made a check outside, and after that--assuming it's OK to go out--no more than six are to leave the ship at any one time.\"  He pointed to a row of metal magnetic tabs clinging to the wall nearest the corridor that led to the airlock. \"When you go out, take one of those tabs and touch it on your suit. There are exactly six tabs. If none are there, don't go out. It's as simple as that.\"  Four men in spacesuits entered the room, followed by two others. The leader of the group saluted. \"We're ready, sir,\" he said. "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25713"],["title","The Judas Valley (#2)"],["body"," \"Go out and get a look at the bodies,\" the colonel told the men, who were Medical Corpsmen. \"You know the procedure. Air and sand samples too, of course.\"  The leader saluted again, turned, and left. Wayne watched the six spacesuited figures step one at a time to the wall, withdraw one of the metal tabs, and affix it to the outer skin of his suit. Then they went outside.  Captain Wayne and Sherri James stood by one of the portholes and watched the six medics as they bent over the corpses outside. \"I don't get it, I just don't understand,\" Wayne said quietly.         *       *       *       *       *  \"What don't you get?\" Sherri asked.  \"Those skeletons. Those men have only been dead for two months, and they've been reduced to nothing but bones already. Even the fabric of their clothing is gone. Why? There must be something here that causes human flesh to deteriorate much faster than normal.\"  \"It does look pretty gruesome,\" Sherri agreed. \"I'm glad we've been ordered to keep our spacesuits on. I wouldn't want to be exposed to anything that might be out there.\"  \"I wonder--\" Wayne muttered.  \"What? What's the matter?\"  Wayne pointed to one figure lying on the sand. \"See that? What's that over his head?\"  \"Why--it's a space helmet!\"  \"Yeah,\" said Wayne. \"The question is: was he wearing just the helmet, or the whole suit? If he was wearing the whole suit, we're not going to be as well protected as we thought, even with our fancy suits.\"  Fifteen minutes passed slowly before the medics returned, and five minutes more before they had passed through the decontamination chambers and were allowed into the ship proper. A ring of tense faces surrounded them as they made their report.         *       *       *       *       *  The leader, a tall, bespectacled doctor named Stevelman, was the spokesman. He shrugged when Colonel Petersen put forth the question whose answer everyone waited for.  \"I don't know,\" the medic replied. \"I don't know what killed them. There's dry bones out there, but no sign of anything that might have done it. It's pretty hard to make a quick diagnosis on a skeleton, Colonel.\"  \"What about the one skeleton with the bubble helmet?\" Peter Wayne asked. \"Did you see any sign of a full suit on him?\"  Stevelman shook his head. \"Not a sign, sir.\"  Colonel Petersen turned and glanced at Lieutenant Jervis. \"Do you remember what the circumstances were, Lieutenant?\"  Jervis shrugged. \"I don't recall it very clearly, sir. I honestly couldn't tell you whether they were wearing suits or bubble-helmets or anything. I was too upset at the time to make careful observations.\"  \"I understand,\" Petersen said.  But the medic had a different theory. He pointed at Jervis and said, \"That's a point I've meant to make, Lieutenant. You're a trained space scout. Your psychological records show that you're not the sort of man given to panic or to become confused.\"  \"Are you implying that there's something improper about my statement, Dr. Stevelman?\"  The medic held up a hand. \"Nothing of the sort, Lieutenant. But since you're not the sort to panic, even in such a crisis as the complete destruction of the entire crew of your scout ship, you must have been ill--partly delirious from fever. Not delirious enough to cause hallucinations, but just enough to impair your judgment.\"  Jervis nodded. \"That is possible,\" he said.  \"Good,\" said Stevelman. \"I have two tentative hypotheses, then.\" He turned to the colonel. \"Should I state them now, Colonel Petersen?\"  \"There's to be no secrecy aboard this ship, Doctor. I want every man and woman on the ship to know all the facts at all times.\"  \"Very well,\" the medic said. \"I'd suggest the deaths were caused by some unknown virus--or, perhaps, by some virulent poison that occurred occasionally, a poisonous smog of some kind that had settled in the valley for a time and then dissipated.\"  Wayne frowned and shook his head. Both hypotheses made sense.  \"Do you have any suggestions, Doctor?\" Petersen said.  \"Since we don't have any direct information about why those men died, Colonel, I can't make any definite statements. But I can offer one bit of advice to everyone: _wear your suits and be alert_.\"         *       *       *       *       *  During the week that followed, several groups went out without suffering any ill effects. A short service was held for the eight of the _Mavis_ and then the skeletons were buried in the valley.  They ran a check on the double-nucleus beryllium toward the end of the week, after it had been fairly safely established that no apparent harm was going to come to them. Wayne and Sherri were both in the crew that went outside to set up the detector.  \"You man the detector plate,\" said Major MacDougal, who was in charge of the group, turning to Wayne.  He put his hand on the plate and waited for the guide coordinates to be set. MacDougal fumbled at the base of the detector for a moment, and the machine began picking up eloptic radiations.  Wayne now looked down at the detector plate. \"Here we are,\" he said. \"The dial's oscillating between four and eight, all right. The stuff's here.\"  MacDougal whistled gently. \"It's really sending, isn't it!\" He pointed toward the mountaintop. \"From up there, too. It's going to be a nice climb. Okay, pack the detector up and let's get back inside.\"  They entered the airlock and passed on into the ship.  \"The D-N beryllium up there, sir,\" Major MacDougal said. \"It's going to be a devil of a job to get up to find the stuff.\"  \"That's what Captain Wayne's here for,\" Petersen said. \"Captain, what do you think? Can you get up here?\"  \"It would have been easier to bring along a helicopter,\" Wayne said wryly. \"Pity the things don't fit into spaceships. But I think I can get up there. I'd like to try surveying the lay of the land, first. I want to know all the possible routes before I start climbing.\"  \"Good idea,\" Petersen said. \"I'll send you out with three men to do some preliminary exploring. Boggs! Manetti! MacPherson! Suit up and get with it!\"         *       *       *       *       *  Wayne strode toward the spacesuit locker, took out his suit, and donned it. Instead of the normal space boots, he put on the special metamagnetic boots for mountain climbing. The little reactors in the back of the calf activated the thick metal sole of each boot so that it would cling tightly to the metallic rock of the mountain. Unlike ordinary magnetism, the metamagnetic field acted on all metals, even when they were in combination with other elements.  His team of three stood before him in the airlock room. He knew all three of them fairly well from Earthside; they were capable, level-headed men, and at least one--Boggs--had already been out in the valley surveying once, and so knew the area pretty well.  He pulled on the boots and looked up. \"We're not going to climb the mountain this time, men. We'll just take a look around it to decide which is the best way.\"  \"You have any ideas, sir?\" Sergeant Boggs asked.  \"From looking at the photographs, I'd guess that the western approach is the best. But I may be wrong. Little details are hard to see from five hundred miles up, even with the best of instruments, and there may be things in our way that will make the west slope impassible. If so, we'll try the southern side. It looks pretty steep, but it also seems rough enough to offer plenty of handholds.\"  \"Too bad we couldn't have had that helicopter you were talking about,\" said Boggs.  Wayne grinned. \"With these winds? They'd smash us against the side of the mountain before we'd get up fifty feet. You ought to know, Sergeant--you've been out in them once already.\"  \"They're not so bad down in this valley, sir,\" Boggs said. \"The only time you really notice them is when you climb the escarpment at the northern end. They get pretty rough up there.\"  Wayne nodded. \"You can see what kind of a job we'll have. Even with metamagnetic boots and grapples, we'll still have to use the old standbys.\" He looked at the men. \"Okay; we're all ready. Let's go.\"  They unhooked four of the six tabs from the wall and donned them. Then they moved on into the airlock and closed the inner door. The air was pumped out, just as though the ship were in space or on a planet with a poisonous atmosphere. As far as anyone knew, the atmosphere of Fomalhaut V actually was poisonous. Some of the tension had relaxed after a week spent in safety, but there was always the first expedition to consider; no one took chances.  When all the air had been removed, a bleeder valve allowed the outer air to come into the chamber. Then the outer door opened, and the four men went down the ladder to the valley floor.         *       *       *       *       *  Wayne led the way across the sand in silence. The four men made their way toward the slope on the western side of the valley. Overhead, the bright globe of Fomalhaut shed its orange light over the rugged landscape.  When they reached the beginning of the slope, Wayne stopped and looked upwards. \"Doesn't look easy,\" he grunted. \"Damned rough hill, matter of fact. MacPherson, do you think you could make it to the top?\"  Corporal MacPherson was a small, wiry man who had the reputation of being a first-rank mountaineer. He had been a member of the eighteenth Mount Everest Party, and had been the second of that party to reach the summit of the towering peak.  \"Sure I can, sir,\" he said confidently. \"Shall I take the rope?\"  \"Go ahead. You and Manetti get the rope to the top, and Sergeant Boggs and I will follow up.\"  \"Righto, sir.\"  Corporal MacPherson reached his gloved hands forward and contracted his fingers. The tiny microswitches in his gloves actuated the relays, and his hands clung to the rock. Then he put his boots against the wall and began to move up the steep escarpment.  Private Manetti followed after him. The two men were lashed together by the light plastisteel cable. The sergeant held the end of the cable in his hands, waiting for "]]]
