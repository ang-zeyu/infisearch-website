The Squire, left alone, sank on his knees, his face in his hands; his great shoulders shook with the intensity of his grief.  An hour or more passed before he heard hurried steps.  He sprang to the door:  'Well?'  'You had better come now.'  'Is she better?'  'Alas! no.  I fear her minutes are numbered.  School yourself, my dear old friend!  God will help you in this bitter hour.  All you can do now is to make her last moments happy.'  'I know!  I know!' he answered in a voice so calm that his companion wondered.  When they came into the room Margaret was dozing.  When her eyes opened and she found her husband beside her bed there spread over her face a glad look; which, alas! soon changed to one of pain.  She motioned to him to bend down.  He knelt and put his head beside her on the pillow; his arms went tenderly round her as though by his iron devotion and strength he would shield her from all harm.  Her voice came very low and in broken gasps; she was summoning all her strength that she might speak:  'My dear, dear husband, I am so sad at leaving you!  You have made me so happy, and I love you so!  Forgive me, dear, for the pain I know you will suffer when I am gone!  And oh, Stephen, I know you will cherish our little one--yours and mine--when I am gone.  She will have no mother; you will have to be father and mother too.'  'I will hold her in my very heart's core, my darling, as I hold you!'  He could hardly speak from emotion.  She went on:  'And oh, my dear, you will not grieve that she is not a son to carry on your name?'  And then a sudden light came into her eyes; and there was exultation in her weak voice as she said:  'She is to be our only one; let her be indeed our son!  Call her the name we both love!'  For answer he rose and laid his hand very, very tenderly on the babe as he said:  'This dear one, my sweet wife, who will carry your soul in her breast, will be my son; the only son I shall ever have.  All my life long I shall, please Almighty God, so love her--our little Stephen--as you and I love each other!'  She laid her hand on his so that it touched at once her husband and her child.  Then she raised the other weak arm, and placed it round his neck, and their lips met.  Her soul went out in this last kiss.     CHAPTER II--THE HEART OF A CHILD   For some weeks after his wife's death Squire Norman was overwhelmed with grief.  He made a brave effort, however, to go through the routine of his life; and succeeded so far that he preserved an external appearance of bearing his loss with resignation.  But within, all was desolation.  Little Stephen had winning ways which sent deep roots into her father's heart.  The little bundle of nerves which the father took into his arms must have realised with all its senses that, in all that it saw and heard and touched, there was nothing but love and help and protection. Gradually the trust was followed by expectation.  If by some chance the father was late in coming to the nursery the child would grow impatient and cast persistent, longing glances at the door.  When he came all was joy.  Time went quickly by, and Norman was only recalled to its passing by the growth of his child.  Seedtime and harvest, the many comings of nature's growth were such commonplaces to him, and had been for so many years, that they made on him no impressions of comparison.  But his baby was one and one only.  Any change in it was not only in itself a new experience, but brought into juxtaposition what is with what was.  The changes that began to mark the divergence of sex were positive shocks to him, for they were unexpected.  In the very dawn of babyhood dress had no special import; to his masculine eyes sex was lost in youth.  But, little by little, came the tiny changes which convention has established.  And with each change came to Squire Norman the growing realisation that his child was a woman.  A tiny woman, it is true, and requiring more care and protection and devotion than a bigger one; but still a woman.  The pretty little ways, the eager caresses, the graspings and holdings of the childish hands, the little roguish smiles and pantings and flirtings were all but repetitions in little of the dalliance of long ago.  The father, after all, reads in the same book in which the lover found his knowledge.  At first there was through all his love for his child a certain resentment of her sex.  His old hope of a son had been rooted too deeply to give way easily.  But when the conviction came, and with it the habit of its acknowledgment, there came also a certain resignation, which is the halting-place for satisfaction.  But he never, not then nor afterwards, quite lost the old belief that Stephen was indeed a son. Could there ever have been a doubt, the remembrance of his wife's eyes and of her faint voice, of her hope and her faith, as she placed her baby in his arms would have refused it a resting-place.  This belief tinged all his after-life and moulded his policy with regard to his girl's upbringing.  If she was to be indeed his son as well as his daughter, she must from the first be accustomed to boyish as well as to girlish ways. This, in that she was an only child, was not a difficult matter to accomplish.  Had she had brothers and sisters, matters of her sex would soon have found their own level.  There was one person who objected strongly to any deviation from the conventional rule of a girl's education.  This was Miss Laetitia Rowly, who took after a time, in so far as such a place could be taken, that of the child's mother.  Laetitia Rowly was a young aunt of Squire Rowly of Norwood; the younger sister of his father and some sixteen years his own senior.  When the old Squire's second wife had died, Laetitia, then a conceded spinster of thirty-six, had taken possession of the young Margaret.  When Margaret had married Squire Norman, Miss Rowly was well satisfied; for she had known Stephen Norman all her life.  Though she could have wished a younger bridegroom for her darling, she knew it would be hard to get a better man or one of more suitable station in life.  Also she knew that Margaret loved him, and the woman who had never found the happiness of mutual love in her own life found a pleasure in the romance of true love, even when the wooer was middle-aged.  She had been travelling in the Far East when the belated news of Margaret's death came to her.  When she had arrived home she announced her intention of taking care of Margaret's child, just as she had taken care of Margaret.  For several reasons this could not be done in the same way.  She was not old enough to go and live at Normanstand without exciting comment; and the Squire absolutely refused to allow that his daughter should live anywhere except in his own house.  Educational supervision, exercised at such distance and so intermittently, could neither be complete nor exact.  Though Stephen was a sweet child she was a wilful one, and very early in life manifested a dominant nature.  This was a secret pleasure to her father, who, never losing sight of his old idea that she was both son and daughter, took pleasure as well as pride out of each manifestation of her imperial will.  The keen instinct of childhood, which reasons in feminine fashion, and is therefore doubly effective in a woman-child, early grasped the possibilities of her own will.  She learned the measure of her nurse's foot and then of her father's; and so, knowing where lay the bounds of possibility of the achievement of her wishes, she at once avoided trouble and learned how to make the most of the space within the limit of her tether.  It is not those who 'cry for the Moon' who go furthest or get most in this limited world of ours.  Stephen's pretty ways and unfailing good temper were a perpetual joy to her father; and when he found that as a rule her desires were reasonable, his wish to yield to them became a habit.  Miss Rowly seldom saw any individual thing to disapprove of.  She it was who selected the governesses and who interviewed them from time to time as to the child's progress.  Not often was there any complaint, for the little thing had such a pretty way of showing affection, and such a manifest sense of justified trust in all whom she encountered, that it would have been hard to name a specific fault.  But though all went in tears of affectionate regret, and with eminently satisfactory emoluments and references, there came an irregularly timed succession of governesses.  Stephen's affection for her 'Auntie' was never affected by any of the changes.  Others might come and go, but there no change came.  The child's little hand would steal into one of the old lady's strong ones, or would clasp a finger and hold it tight.  And then the woman who had never had a child of her own would feel, afresh each time, as though the child's hand was gripping her heart.  With her father she was sweetest of all.  And as he seemed to be pleased when she did anything like a little boy, the habit of being like one insensibly grew on her.  An only child has certain educational difficulties.  The true learning is not that which we are taught, but that which we take in for ourselves from experience and observation, and children's experiences and observation, especially of things other than repressive, are mainly of children.  The little ones teach each other.  Brothers and sisters are more with each other than are ordinary playmates, and in the familiarity of their constant intercourse some of the great lessons, so useful in after-life, are learned.  Little Stephen had no means of learning the wisdom of give-and-take.  To her everything was given, given bountifully and gracefully.  Graceful acceptance of good things came to her naturally, as it does to one who is born to be a great lady.  The children of the farmers in the neighbourhood, with whom at times she"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25206"],["title","Rollo's Philosophy. [Air] (#1)"],["body"," he did not know.  The fact, however, that they were lost, was no longer to be concealed; and Lucy proposed that they should go into the woods, where the tops of the trees would act as a sort of umbrella, to keep the snow from falling upon them, and wait there until it stopped snowing; and then the air would be clear, and they could find their way out.  \"O,\" said Rollo, \"I can easily make a hut of hemlock branches, and we can go into that for shelter.\"  \"But, Rollo,\" said Nathan, \"how do you know but that it will snow all day? We can't stay in the woods all day.\"  \"No,\" said Rollo; \"when it snows in great flakes, it is not going to snow long. Jonas told me so.\"  So the children went into the woods, and Rollo began to make his hut; but he was soon interrupted, and the attention of all the children was called off by a little bird, which they saw there, hopping about, and appearing benumbed with cold. After some effort, Rollo succeeded in catching her in his cap.  \"We'll carry her home,\" said Nathan; \"we'll carry her home, and show her to mother.\"  \"Yes,\" said Rollo, \"I'll carry her in my cap.\"  \"No,\" said Lucy, \"you must have your cap on your head, or you will take cold. Let me carry her in my hands.\"  \"No,\" said Rollo, \"you will have to lead Nathan. I'll tell you what we will do. We will put her into the basket, for a cage.\"  Lucy, on the whole, liked this plan, and they accordingly put the bird in the basket, and Rollo contrived to make a cover of boughs, to keep her from getting away.  By the time that this was all arranged, the children found, to their great satisfaction, that it had ceased snowing; and they immediately set out for home. Rollo drew the sled, with the basket and bird upon it, secured as before with the cord; and Lucy led Nathan. They now had no difficulty in finding their way, and soon reached home in safety.  They kept the bird until the next day, and then, as it was mild and pleasant, they let her fly away.       QUESTIONS.      By what process had the snow become hardened at this time? Did     Rollo's father expect that it would continue hard till noon?     Why not? Did it continue hard? What prevented its melting? How     did Rollo get sticks for his fire? What name did he give to the     hill which they ascended? What occasioned the difficulty in the     way of Rollo's finding his way home? What conversation took     place when he found the track? Was this track in the new snow,     or in the old snow? How had it become partly obliterated? How     did they carry the bird home?     CHAPTER II.  FLYING.   Nathan became very much interested in the bird, and that evening, as his father was sitting by the fire, with a book in his hand, which he had been reading, Nathan came up to him, and said,--  \"Father, are you busy now,--thinking, or anything?\"  \"No,\" said his father.  \"Because,\" said Nathan, \"if you are not, I want to read you something out of my little book.\"  So Nathan's father took him up into his lap, and Nathan opened his little book, and began to read as follows:--      \"'With fins for the water, and wings for the air,     And feet for the ground, I could go everywhere.'  \"Isn't that funny?\" said Nathan.  \"Rather funny,\" said his father.  \"I wish I had wings,\" said Nathan.  \"Why?\" said his father.  \"Why, then I could fly.\"  \"That is not certain,\" said his father. \"There are two difficulties which prevent boys from flying. One is, they have no wings; and the other is, they have not strength to use them.\"  \"O father,\" said Nathan, \"I could use them; I am pretty strong. I can wheel Rollo's wheelbarrow.\"  His father smiled. \"Very possibly,\" said he; \"but I do not think that you would be strong enough to use wings, even if you had them.\"  \"Why, at any rate, I am stronger than a bird,\" said Nathan.  \"Yes,\" said his father, \"you have more actual strength than a bird, but not more in proportion to your size. You are absolutely stronger, but not relatively.\"  \"What do you mean by that?\" said Nathan.  \"Why, you have actually more strength than a bird,--a robin, for instance; you could hold him so that he could not get away; and you could lift more than he could too. But then you are a great deal larger, and you are not as much stronger than he is, as you are larger. If you are a hundred times as heavy as he, you are not a hundred times as strong. That's what I mean by saying that you are absolutely stronger, but not relatively. That is, you are not as many times stronger, as you are larger and heavier. You are absolutely stronger, but not relatively; that is, in proportion to your size and weight.  \"Now I can prove to you,\" continued his father, \"that you would not be strong enough to fly with wings, even if you had them. Suppose there was a pole fastened across the room, and another pole just above it; could you pull yourself up, from one pole to the other, by your hands alone, without touching your feet?--Or a ladder,\" continued his father,--\"it will be better to suppose a ladder. Now, if there was a ladder leaning up against a building, could you climb up on the under side by your hands, drawing yourself up, hand over hand, without touching your feet?\"  Here Rollo, who was reading in a little chair at the back part of the room, when his father first commenced the conversation with Nathan, but who had been listening for a few minutes past to what his father had been saying, jumped up, and came across the room to his father, and said,--  \"Yes, sir, yes, sir; I can. I have done it often in the barn.\"  \"How high up could you go?\" said his father.  \"O, almost up to the loft,\" said Rollo. \"Only, you see, father, the rounds are too far up. I can't reach up very well. If they were nearer together, I could climb up so, very well.\"  \"Well,\" said his father, \"a bird, when flying, has to climb up in much the same way. He has to pull himself up by the _air_, with his wings, just as you do with your hands and arms, by the rounds of the ladder; only the air is not fixed, like the ladder, but constantly gives way under his wing; and so, to make the case the same, you must suppose that the ladder is not firm, but is floating in the air, and sinks down with your weight, so that you have to climb up faster than you pull the ladder down. Do you think you would have strength enough in your arms to do that?\"  Rollo and Nathan looked very much interested in what their father was saying, but they both admitted that they could not climb up such ladders as those.  \"The air,\" added their father, \"gives way continually under the bird's wing; and yet they have to pull themselves up by it. And this is very hard. They must either have very large wings, and prodigious strength to use them, so as to pull upon the air with very hard and heavy strokes, or else, if they have small wings, they must have strength to strike very quick and often with them.  \"The wings of sparrows move so quick, that you cannot count the strokes; and those of humming-birds, which are smaller still, so fast that you cannot see them. They make a hum.\"  \"I could make my wings go so fast,\" said Nathan; and he began to imitate the flapping of the wings of a bird, with his arms, as rapidly and forcibly as he could.  \"So can I,\" said Rollo; and he made the same motions. \"That is as fast as crows' wings move, when they are flying.\"  \"Yes,\" said his father, \"crows move their _wings_ as fast as that, whereas you only move hands and arms. If you had great wings, as long, in proportion, as the crows, you could not move them so fast.\"  \"How large would they be?\" said Rollo.  \"O, I don't know,--perhaps as big as the top of the dining-table.\"  \"O father,\" said Rollo, \"I don't think they would be as big as that. The crow's wings are not longer than his body, and so mine would not be longer than my body.\"  \"Perhaps you never saw a crow's body,\" said his father. \"His feathers and his tail, which are very light, swell out his body, and make it appear much larger than it really is. I presume his wings, when they are spread, are twice or three times as long as his body. If you had wings in proportion, it would be with the utmost difficulty that you could use them at all. You certainly could not strike the air with them fast enough to pull yourself up by them.\"  \"I did not think that the birds pulled themselves up by the air,\" said Nathan. \"I did not know that the air was anything _real_.\"  \"O yes; it is something real,\" said his father.  \"I've seen birds fly without moving their wings at all,\" said Rollo.  \"Yes,\" said his father, \"and so have I seen a stone.\"  \"A stone!\" repeated Rollo.  \"What, a stone fly?\" said Nathan.  \"Yes,\" replied his father; \"did you never see a stone fly through the air, without any wings at all?\"  \"Why, yes,\" said Rollo, \"when somebody threw it.\"  \"Very well,\" said his father. \"If you set the stone in motion, it will continue in motion for some time, without any wings; and so will a bird.\"  \"But, father, they don't throw birds,\" said Nathan; and he laughed aloud at such an idea.  \"Birds throw themselves,\" said his father; \"that is, they strike their wings upon the air, hard and quick, and thus get into very quick motion, and then they can keep their wings still for a time, and go on, as long as the impulse they have given them lasts. This shows what prodigious strength they have in their wings. They can not only strike the air hard and frequently enough to raise themselves up, and move along, but they can do it so easily, as to get such a velocity, that they can rest their wings for some time, and sail away through the air, only expending the impulse they had accumulated.\"  Rollo and Nathan were silent. Rollo was thinking how he had seen the swallows sailing swiftly round and round in the air, with their wings spread out motionless by their side.  \"So, you see,\" continued his father, \"the difficulty in the way of a boy's flying, is not the want of wings, but the want of strength to use them. It would be very easy to make wings.\"  \"Would"]]]
