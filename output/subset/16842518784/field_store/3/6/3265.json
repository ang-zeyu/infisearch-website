If so, it is to be hoped he will at once publish his discoveries for the satisfaction of all lovers of birds.  If one had time and opportunity, some intensely interesting experiments might be tried. Suppose an eastern blue jay should be carried to the top of Pike's Peak, or Gray's, and then set free, how would he fare? Would the muscles and tendons of his wings have sufficient strength to bear him up in the rarefied atmosphere? One may easily imagine that he would go wabbling helplessly over the granite boulders, unable to lift himself more than a few feet in the air, while the pipit and the leucosticte, inured to the heights, would mount up to the sky and shout \"Ha! ha!\" in good-natured raillery at the blue tenderfoot. And would the feathered visitor feel a constriction in his chest and be compelled to gasp for breath, as the human tourists invariably do? It is even doubtful whether any eastern bird would be able to survive the changed meteorological conditions, Nature having designed him for a different environment.     INTRODUCTION TO SOME SPECIES   It was night when I found lodgings in the picturesque village of Manitou, nestling at the foot of the lower mountains that form the portico to Pike's Peak. Early the next morning I was out for a stroll along the bush-fringed mountain brook which had babbled me a serenade all night. To my delight, the place was rife with birds, the first to greet me being robins, catbirds, summer warblers, and warbling vireos, all of which, being well known in the East, need no description, but are mentioned here only to show the reader that some avian species are common to both the East and the West.  But let me pause to pay a little tribute to the brave robin redbreast. Of course, here he is called the \"western robin.\" His distribution is an interesting scientific fact. I found him everywhere--on the arid plains and mesas, in the solemn pines of the deep gulches and passes, and among the scraggy trees bordering on timber-line, over ten thousand feet above sea-level. In Colorado the robins are designated as \"western,\" forms by the system-makers, but, even though called by a modified title, they deport themselves, build their nests, and sing their \"cheerily, cheerily, cheer up,\" just as do their brothers and sisters of the land toward the rising sun. If there is any difference, their songs are not so loud and ringing, and their breasts not quite so ruddy as are those of the eastern types. Perhaps the incessant sunshine of Colorado bleaches out the tints somewhat.  But in my ante-breakfast stroll at Manitou I soon stumbled upon feathered strangers. What was this little square-shouldered bird that kept uttering a shrill scream, which he seemed to mistake for a song? It was the western wood-pewee. Instead of piping the sweet, pensive \"Pe-e-e-o-we-e-e-e\" of the woodland bird of the Eastern States, this western swain persists in ringing the changes hour by hour upon that piercing scream, which sounds more like a cry of anguish than a song. At Buena Vista, where these birds are superabundant, their morning concerts were positively painful. One thing must be said, however, in defence of the western wood-pewee--he means well.  Another acquaintance of my morning saunter was the debonair Arkansas goldfinch, which has received its bunglesome name, not from the State of Arkansas, but from the Arkansas River, dashing down from the mountains and flowing eastwardly through the southern part of Colorado. Most nattily this little bird wears his black cap, his olive-green frock, and his bright yellow vest. You will see at once that he dresses differently from the American goldfinch, so well known in the East, and, for that matter, just as well known on the plains of Colorado, where both species dwell in harmony. There are some white markings on the wings of _Spinus psaltria_ that give them a gauze-like appearance when they are rapidly fluttered.  His song and some of his calls bear a close resemblance to those of the common goldfinch, but he is by no means a mere duplicate of that bird; he has an individuality of his own. While his flight is undulatory, the waviness is not so deeply and distinctly marked; nor does he sing a cheery cradle-song while swinging through the ether, although he often utters a series of unmusical chirps. One of the most pleasingly pensive sounds heard in my western rambles was the little coaxing call of this bird, whistled mostly by the female, I think. No doubt it is the tender love talk of a young wife or mother, which may account for its surpassing sweetness.  Every lover of feathered kind is interested in what may be called comparative ornithology, and therefore I wish to speak of another western form and its eastern prototype--Bullock's oriole, which in Colorado takes the place of the Baltimore oriole known east of the plains all the way to the Atlantic coast. However, Bullock's is not merely a variety or subspecies, but a well-defined species of the oriole family, his scientific title being _Icterus bullocki_.  Like our familiar Lord Baltimore, he bravely bears black and orange; but in _bullocki_ the latter color invades the sides of the neck, head, and forehead, leaving only a small black bow for the throat and a narrow black stripe running back over the crown and down the back of the neck; whereas in _Icterus galbula_ the entire head and neck are black. Brilliant as Bullock's oriole is, he does not seem to be anxious to display his fineries, for he usually makes it a point to keep himself ensconced behind a clump of foliage, so that, while you may hear a desultory piping in the trees, apparently inviting your confidence, it will be a long time before you can get more than a provoking glimpse of the jolly piper himself. \"My gorgeous apparel was not made for parade,\" seems to be his modest disclaimer.  He is quite a vocalist. Here is a quotation from my lead-pencil, dashes and all: \"Bullock's oriole--fine singer--voice stronger than orchard oriole's--song not quite so well articulated or so elaborate, but louder and more resonant--better singer than the Baltimore.\" It might be added that Bullock's, like the orchard, but unlike the Baltimore, pipes a real tune, with something of a theme running through its intermittent outbursts. The plumage of the young bird undergoes some curious changes, and what I took to be the year-old males seemed to be the most spirited musicians.  Maurice Thompson's tribute to the Baltimore oriole will apply to that bird's western kinsman. He calls him:--      \"Athlete of the air--     Of fire and song a glowing core;\"  and then adds, with tropical fervor:      \"A hot flambeau on either wing       Rimples as you pass me by;     'T is seeing flame to hear you sing,       'T is hearing song to see you fly.         *       *       *       *       *      \"When flowery hints foresay the berry,       On spray of haw and tuft of brier,     Then, wandering incendiary,       You set the maple swamps afire!\"  Many nests of Bullock's oriole rewarded my slight search. They are larger and less compactly woven than the Baltimore's, and have a woolly appearance exteriorly, as if the down of the Cottonwood trees had been wrought into the fabric. Out on the plains I counted four dangling nests, old and new, on one small limb; but that, of course, was unusual, there being only one small clump of trees within a radius of many miles.  In the vicinity of Manitou many trips were taken by the zealous pedestrian. Some of the dry, steep sides of the first range of mountains were hard climbing, but it was necessary to make the effort in order to discover their avian resources. One of the first birds met with on these unpromising acclivities was the spurred towhee of the Rockies. In his attire he closely resembles the towhee, or \"chewink,\" of the East, but has as an extra ornament a beautiful sprinkling of white on his back and wings, which makes him look as if he had thrown a gauzy mantle of silver over his shoulders.  But his song is different from our eastern towhee's. My notes say that it is \"a cross between the song of the chewink and that of dickcissel,\" and I shall stand by that assertion until I find good reason to disown it--should that time ever come. The opening syllabication is like dickcissel's; then follows a trill of no specially definable character. There are times when he sings with more than his wonted force, and it is then that his tune bears the strongest likeness to the eastern towhee's. But his alarm-call! It is no \"chewink\" at all, but almost as close a reproduction of a cat's mew as is the catbird's well-known call. Such crosses and anomalies does this country produce!  On the arid mountain sides among the stunted bushes, cactus plants, sand, and rocks, this quaint bird makes his home, coming down into the valleys to drink at the tinkling brooks and trill his roundelays. Many, many times, as I was following a deep fissure in the mountains, his ditty came dripping down to me from some spot far up the steep mountain side--a little cascade of song mingling with the cascades of the brooks. The nests are usually placed under a bush on the sides of the mesas and mountains.  And would you believe it? Colorado furnishes another towhee, though why he should have been put into the Pipilo group by the ornithologists is more than I can tell at this moment. He has no analogue in the East. True, he is a bird of the bushes, running sometimes like a little deer from one clump to another; but if you should see him mount a boulder or a bush, and hear him sing his rich, theme-like, finely modulated song, you would aver that he is closer kin to the thrushes or thrashers than to the towhees. There is not the remotest suggestion of the towhee minstrelsy in his prolonged and well-articulated melody. It would be difficult to find a finer lyrist among the mountains.  But, hold! I have neglected to introduce this pretty Mozart of the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25990"],["title","Bird Houses Boys Can Build (#1)"],["body","S.]  Almost any sort of lumber may be used, but birds take most readily to that which has been weathered out of doors. A kind should be used which does not warp or check badly; white pine and cypress meet these requirements and are worked with ease. Yellow poplar is used and cedar with or without the bark left on has its friends for houses of the first or second classes.  Nesting boxes of sawed lumber should be painted on the outside to improve their appearance and to preserve them against the effect of the weather. It is often wise to leave a small amount of unpainted surface around the entrance, and all paint should be thoroughly dry before houses are expected to be occupied. Colors selected will depend somewhat upon the neighborhood, but white, grey, dull greens or browns are often used.   DIMENSIONS OF NESTING BOXES.  The following table, copied from Farmers Bulletin, No. 609, U. S. Dept. of Agriculture, gives in small space valuable information about dimensions that experience and investigation have indicated as good for particular varieties of birds. This list includes many varieties that do not commonly live in houses built for them, however. As time goes on, we may expect to find more of these birds living in our nesting boxes because they are apt to seek the same sort of home as the one in which they were reared. The table is given to be of service to those wishing to plan new houses not shown here.  _Dimensions of nesting boxes for various species of birds._  =================+==========+==========+==========+==========+=========                  |   Floor  |   Depth  | Entrance | Diameter |  Height     Species.     |    of    |    of    |  above   |    of    |  above                  |  cavity. |  cavity. |  floor.  | entrance.|  ground. -----------------+----------+----------+----------+----------+---------                  | _Inches._| _Inches._| _Inches._| _Inches._|  _Feet._ Bluebird         |  5 by  5 |        8 |       6  |   1-1/2  |  5 to 10 Robin            |  6 by  8 |        8 |   [1]    |   [1]    |  6 to 15 Chickadee        |  4 by  4 |  8 to 10 |       8  |   1-1/8  |  6 to 15 Tufted titmouse  |  4 by  4 |  8 to 10 |       8  |   1-1/4  |  6 to 15 White-breasted   |          |          |          |          |         nuthatch |  4 by  4 |  8 to 10 |       8  |   1-1/4  | 12 to 20 House wren       |  4 by  4 |  6 to  8 | 1 to  6  |     7/8  |  6 to 10 Bewick wren      |  4 by  4 |  6 to  8 | 1 to  6  |   1      |  6 to 10 Carolina wren    |  4 by  4 |  6 to  8 | 1 to  6  |   1-1/8  |  6 to 10 Dipper           |  6 by  6 |        6 |       1  |   3      |  1 to  3 Violet-green     |          |          |          |          |          swallow |  5 by  5 |        6 | 1 to  6  |   1-1/2  | 10 to 15 Tree swallow     |  5 by  5 |        6 | 1 to  6  |   1-1/2  | 10 to 15 Barn swallow     |  6 by  6 |        6 |   [1]    |   [1]    |  8 to 12 Martin           |  6 by  6 |        6 |       1  |   2-1/2  | 15 to 20 Song sparrow     |  6 by  6 |        6 |   [2]    |   [2]    |  1 to  3 House finch      |  6 by  6 |        6 |       4  |   2      |  8 to 12 Phoebe           |  6 by  6 |        6 |   [1]    |   [1]    |  8 to 12 Crested          |          |          |          |          |       flycatcher |  6 by  6 |  8 to 10 |       8  |   2      |  8 to 20 Flicker          |  7 by  7 | 16 to 18 |      16  |   2-1/2  |  6 to 20 Red-headed       |          |          |          |          |       woodpecker |  6 by  6 | 12 to 15 |      12  |   2      | 12 to 20 Golden-fronted   |          |          |          |          |       woodpecker |  6 by  6 | 12 to 15 |      12  |   2      | 12 to 20 Hairy woodpecker |  6 by  6 | 12 to 15 |      12  |   1-1/2  | 12 to 20 Downy woodpecker |  4 by  4 |  8 to 10 |       8  |   1-1/4  |  6 to 20 Screech owl      |  8 by  8 | 12 to 15 |      12  |   3      | 10 to 30 Sparrow hawk     |  8 by  8 | 12 to 15 |      12  |   3      | 10 to 30 Saw-whet owl     |  6 by  6 | 10 to 12 |      10  |   2-1/2  | 12 to 20 Barn owl         | 10 by 18 | 15 to 18 |       4  |   6      | 12 to 18 Wood duck        | 10 by 18 | 10 to 15 |       3  |   6      |  4 to 20 -----------------+----------+----------+----------+----------+---------  [Footnote 1: One or more sides open.]  [Footnote 2: All sides open.]   HOUSES OF SAWED LUMBER.  The boy with an outfit of tools at home, or with a teacher of manual training interested in birds, can make all of the houses to be described in this section. Figs. 10 and 11 show simple houses for wrens and bluebirds. Drawings for this type of house are shown in Figs. 14, 15 and 21. While the surfaces of lumber used for these houses may or may not be planed, care must be taken that all pieces are sawed or planed to the correct sizes with edges and ends square and true so there will be no bad cracks for drafts and rain to enter. Be careful to nail the pieces together so that they will not have occasion to crack or warp. A good way to save time and lumber is to prepare a piece of stock, getting it of the right thickness, width and length, and then to saw up this stock on lines carefully laid out as shown in the drawings of the bluebird and wren houses, flicker nest, robin shelf and finch house. The most difficult houses to build are those for martins. In Fig. 45 is given a drawing for a small home arranged to care for eight families, while the photographs, Figs. 8, 9, 38, 66 and 67 show larger, finer and more difficult houses. The doors or openings are 2-1/2\" in diameter and can be made with an expansion bit or a key-hole saw. All of these houses are to be made so they may be cleaned. Sometimes the bottom is hinged on two screws or nails, and held in proper place by a dowel (bluebird house, Fig. 21); or screwed in place (wren house, Fig. 21, and martin house, Fig. 45); or hinged and held in place by a brass spring (wren house, Fig. 14).  [Illustration: FIG. 11. HOUSES FOR WRENS AND BLUEBIRDS.]  [Illustration: FIG. 12. RUSTIC HOUSES.]   RUSTIC HOUSES.  The first group of houses of this type are shown in Figs. 12, 35 and 36. These are made of slabs of wood with the bark left on, and in some cases, of the bark alone if it can be secured of sufficient thickness. It is usually a good plan to drive a sufficient number of nails into the bark to keep it in place, otherwise it will drop off. Houses such as these attract birds that would avoid a freshly painted imitation of some large residence or public building. Figs. 20 and 37 show houses made of a section of a tree split or sawed in halves, the nest cavity hollowed out, and then fastened together again with screws. The top should be covered with a board or piece of tin to keep out rain. The third division of this type of house is made of sawed lumber and then trimmed with bark or twigs. In this way the same frames may be made to appear as very different bird houses when completed. Such houses are shown in Figs. 30 to 34. Sometimes a pail is used for the frame and then covered with bark, as the center house of Fig. 28. This house has a partition placed half-way up making it a two family apartment, and is provided with ventilating and cleaning devices.   CEMENT AND STUCCO HOUSES.  Houses may be cast of concrete as Fig. 39. This requires a mold or form, and takes considerable planning to insure success. A form is made whose inside dimensions are those of the outside of the bird house, and of the desired shape. A second form, or core, to be placed inside of the first form, is made as large as the inside of the bird house. The two forms must be mounted so they will remain in the right relation while concrete is placed in the space between them. After this has set, the forms may be removed, cleaned and used again. The roof is generally made separately and put in position last. Or the roof can be cast as a part of the house in which case the bottom is inserted last. Birds do not take as kindly to this type of house as a rule, as to those made of wood.  [Illustration: FIG. 13. STUCCO HOUSE FOR MARTINS.]  The stucco house has many possibilities. Fig. 38, shows a group of such houses designed to match the general appearance of garages in good residence districts. The frame is made of wood and the stucco applied by one of the methods in use on large houses. Seventh grade boys have made such houses, using 3/8\" material for the frames, tacking on wire netting and then plastering each side of the house in turn with concrete. The sides were given a pebble-dash surface, while the roof was finished with a steel trowel to give a smooth surface that will shed water readily, Fig. 13.  [Illustration: FIG. 14.
