[Illustration]   Victory now! the deed is done!  No longer at the set of sun  The rats fly shrieking to their nests,  They saunter round with merry jests    And ne'er a thought of fear,      Knowing full well      They'll hear the bell    When Mr. Cat draws near.   [Illustration]   And young Sir Rat who did the deed,  Whose cleverness relieved their need,    His wondrous enterprise    Was lauded to the skies.  And everywhere his name  Was hailed with shouts of fame.   In difficulties, oft we see  Modern improvements frequently  Will prove a happy remedy.      The Rhyme of Triangular Tommy    [Illustration]   Triangular Tommy, one morning in May,  Went out for a walk on the public highway.      Just here I will say,      'Twas a bright sunny day,  And the sky it was blue, and the grass it was green,  The same sky and grass that you've all of you seen;  And the birds in the trees sang their usual song,  And Triangular Tommy went trudging along.       But I can tell you      He cared naught for the view.  He did just what small boys of his age always do:      He shouted out \"Scat!\"      At a wandering cat,  And he picked a big daisy to stick in his hat;      The clovers he topped,      And the toadstools he cropped,  And sometimes he scuffled and sometimes he hopped.   [Illustration]   He took an old stick and poked at a worm,  And merrily chuckled to see the thing squirm;  When he chanced to look up, and in gorgeous array  Triangular Tilly was coming his way.  Triangular Tom straightened up in a jiff,  And put on his best manner--exceedingly stiff;  And as far as his angular shape would allow  Triangular Tom made a beautiful bow.   [Illustration]   [Illustration]   [Illustration]   Triangular Tilly went smilingly by,  With a glance that was friendly, but just a bit shy.  And Tom so admired her that after she passed,  A backward look over his shoulder he cast.  And he said, \"Though I think many girls are but silly,  I really admire that Triangular Tilly.\"   [Illustration]   But soon all such thoughts were put out of his head,  For who should come by but Triangular Ted,  The very boy Tom had been wishing to see!  \"Hello!\" said Triangular Tommy, said he.  \"Hello!\" said Triangular Ted, and away  Those two children scooted to frolic and play.      And they had, on the green,      Where 'twas all dry and clean,  The best game of leap-frog that ever was seen.  Triangular Tom beat down this way, you know,  And Triangular Ted stood beside him, just so,      When one, two, three--go!      With  the  greatest gusto,  Ted flew over Tom in a manner not slow.   [Illustration]   [Illustration]   They played hide-and-seek, they played marbles and tag,  They played they were soldiers, and each waved a flag;      Till at last they confessed,      They wanted to rest;  So they sat down and chatted with laughter and jest;   [Illustration]   When Schoolmaster Jones they suddenly spied,  Come clumping along with his pedagogue stride,  As usual, with manner quite preoccupied;      With his hat on one side,      And his shoe-lace untied--  A surly old fellow, it can't be denied;      And each wicked boy      Thought that he would enjoy  An occasion the thoughtful old man to annoy,  And all of his wise calculations destroy.      So they thought they'd employ      A means known to each boy.  And across the wide pavement they fastened a twine  Exceedingly strong but exceedingly fine;  And Triangular Tommy laughed out in his glee,  To think how upset the old master would be!   [Illustration]   Although very wicked, their mischievous scheme  Was a perfect success; and with a loud scream,      A horrible clash,      A thump and a smash,  Old Schoolmaster Jones came down with a crash.  His hat rolled away, and his spectacles broke,  And those dreadful boys thought it a howling good joke.  And they just doubled up in immoderate glee,  Saying, \"Look at the Schoolmaster!      Tee-hee! tee-hee!\"   [Illustration]   [Illustration]       Tom gave a guffaw,      And Ted roared a \"haw-haw\";  But soon their diversion was turned into awe,  For old Schoolmaster Jones was angry, they saw.   [Illustration]   [Illustration]       Triangular Ted      Turned swiftly and fled,  And far down the street like a reindeer he sped,  Leaving Tommy to face the old gentleman's rage,  Who quickly jumped up,--he was brisk for his age,--  And with just indignation portrayed on his face,  To Triangular Tommy he quickly gave chase.   [Illustration]       And hearing his squeals      And his frantic appeals,  Triangular Tommy fast took to his heels.  Now Tommy was agile and Tommy was spry;  He whizzed through the air--he just seemed to fly;  He rushed madly on, until, dreadful to say!  He came where the railroad was just in his way--      And alas! and alack!      He tripped on the track  And then with a terrible, sudden ker-thwack!  Triangular Tommy sprawled flat on his back--  And the train came along with a crash, and a crack,  A din, and a clatter, a clang, and a clack,  A toot, and a boom, and a roar, and a hiss,  And chopped him up all into pieces like this--  If _you_ cut out papers just like them, why, then,  If you try, you can put him together again.

[Illustration]      An April Joke    [Illustration]   Oh, it was a merry, gladsome day,  When the April Fool met the Queen of May;  She had roguish eyes and golden hair,  And they were a mischief-making pair.  They planned the funniest kind of a joke  On the poor, long-suffering mortal folk;  And a few mysterious words he said,  His fool's cap close to her flower-crowned head.  Then he laughed till he made his cap-bells ring,  At the thought of the topsy-turvy Spring.  \"'Tis a fair exchange,\" he said, with a wink--  \"It is!\" she said, and what do you think?  The flowers that should bloom in the month of May  Every one of them came on an April day!  And they looked for April showers in vain,  But all through May it did nothing but rain!

The Funny Kittens    [Illustration]   Once there were some silly kittens,  And they knitted woolly mittens    To bestow upon the freezing Hottentots.  But the Hottentots refused them,  Saying that they never used them    Unless crocheted of red with yellow spots.   [Illustration]   So the silly little kittens  Took their blue and white striped mittens    To a Bear who lived within a hollow tree;  The Bear responded sadly,  \"I would wear your mittens gladly,    But I fear they are too gay for such as me.\"   [Illustration]   Then the kittens, almost weeping,  Came to where a Cow lay sleeping,    And they woke her with this piteous request,  \"Won't you wear our mittens furry?\"  Said the Cow, \"My dears, don't worry;    I will put them on as soon as I am dressed.\"   [Illustration]   Then the Cow put on her bonnet  With a wreath of roses on it,    And a beautiful mantilla fringed with white;  And she donned the pretty mittens,  While the silly little kittens    Clapped their paws in admiration at the sight.      The Strike of the Fireworks    'Twas the night before the Fourth of July, the people slept serene;  The fireworks were stored in the old town hall that stood                on the village green.  The steeple clock tolled the midnight hour, and at its final stroke,  The fire in the queer old-fashioned stove lifted its voice and spoke;  \"The earth and air have naught to do, the water, too, may play,  And only fire is made to work on Independence Day.   \"I won't stand such injustice! It's wrong, beyond a doubt,  And I shall take my holiday. Good-by, I'm going out!\"  Up spoke a Roman candle then, \"The principle is right!

In that Conference or in the world, there was never a purer or a more ardent patriot. Those of us who were associated with him politically, had learned to love and respect him. His opponents admired his unflinching devotion to his country, and his manly frankness and candor. He was the type of a true American, able, unselfish, prudent, unambitious, and good. Other pens will do justice to his memory, but I thought as I heard the last account of him alive, as he lay within the rebel lines, his face wearing that calm serenity which grew more beautiful the nearer death approached, after having given so abundantly of his goods, now yielding his life to his country in the hour of her trial, that hereafter the good and true men of the nation would emulate the illustrious example of his patriotism, and would prize the blessings of a free government the more highly, as they remembered that it could only be maintained and perpetuated by such expensive sacrifices.  L.E.C.  _May_, 1864.     PROCEEDINGS OF THE CONFERENCE,  Washington, D.C.   MONDAY, _February 4th, 1861._  Commissioners representing a number of the States, assembled at Willard's Hall, in the City of Washington, D.C., on the fourth day of February, A.D. 1861, at 12 o'clock M., in pursuance of the following preamble and resolutions, adopted by the General Assembly of the State of Virginia, on the nineteenth day of January, A.D. 1861:       _Whereas_, It is the deliberate opinion of the General      Assembly of Virginia, that unless the unhappy controversy      which now divides the States of this confederacy, shall be      satisfactorily adjusted, a permanent dissolution of Union is      inevitable; and the General Assembly, representing the      wishes of the people of the commonwealth, is desirous of      employing every reasonable means to avert so dire a      calamity, and determined to make a final effort to restore      the Union and the Constitution, in the spirit in which they      were established by the fathers of the Republic: Therefore,       _Resolved_, That on behalf of the commonwealth of Virginia,      an invitation is hereby extended to all such States, whether      slaveholding or non-slaveholding, as are willing to unite      with Virginia in an earnest effort to adjust the present      unhappy controversies, in the spirit in which the      Constitution was originally formed, and consistently with      its principles, so as to afford to the people of the      slaveholding States adequate guarantees for the security of      their rights, to appoint commissioners to meet on the fourth      day of February next, in the City of Washington, similar      commissioners appointed by Virginia, to consider, and if      practicable, agree upon some suitable adjustment.       _Resolved_, That ex-President JOHN TYLER, WILLIAM C. RIVES,      Judge JOHN W. BROCKENBROUGH, GEORGE W. SUMMERS, and JAMES A.      SEDDON are hereby appointed commissioners, whose duty it      shall be to repair to the City of Washington, on the day      designated in the foregoing resolution, to meet such      commissioners as may be appointed by any of said States, in      accordance with the foregoing resolution.       _Resolved_, That if said commissioners, after full and free      conference, shall agree upon any plan of adjustment      requiring amendments to the Federal Constitution, for the      further security of the rights of the people of the      slaveholding States, they be requested to communicate the      proposed amendments to Congress, for the purpose of having      the same submitted by that body, according to the forms of      the Constitution, to the several States for ratification.       _Resolved_, That if said commissioners cannot agree on such      adjustment, or if agreeing, Congress shall refuse to submit      for ratification, such amendments as may be proposed, then      the commissioners of this State shall immediately      communicate the result to the executive of this      commonwealth, to be by him laid before the convention of the      people of Virginia and the General Assembly: _Provided_,      That the said commissioners be subject at all times to the      control of the General Assembly, or if in session, to that      of the State convention.       _Resolved_, That in the opinion of the General Assembly of      Virginia, the propositions embraced in the resolutions      presented to the Senate of the United States by the Hon.      JOHN J. CRITTENDEN, so modified as that the first article      proposed as an amendment to the Constitution of the United      States, shall apply to all the territory of the United      States now held or hereafter acquired south of latitude      thirty-six degrees and thirty minutes, and provide that      slavery of the African race shall be effectually protected      as property therein during the continuance of the      territorial government, and the fourth article shall secure      to the owners of slaves the right of transit with their      slaves between and through the non-slaveholding States and      territories, constitute the basis of such an adjustment of      the unhappy controversy which now divides the States of this      confederacy, as would be accepted by the people of this      commonwealth.       _Resolved_, That ex-President JOHN TYLER is hereby      appointed, by the concurrent vote of each branch of the      General Assembly, a commissioner to the President of the      United States, and Judge JOHN ROBERTSON is hereby appointed,      by a like vote, a commissioner to the State of South      Carolina, and the other States that have seceded or shall      secede, with instructions respectfully to request the      President of the United States and authorities of such      States to agree to abstain, pending the proceedings      contemplated by the action of this General Assembly, from      any and all acts calculated to produce a collision of arms      between the States and the Government of the United States.       _Resolved_, That copies of the foregoing resolutions be      forthwith telegraphed to the executives of the several      States, and also to the President of the United States, and      the Governor be requested to inform, without delay, the      commissioners of their appointment by the foregoing      resolutions.       [A copy from the rolls.]       WM. F. GORDON, JR.,        _C.H.D. and K.R. of Va._  The Conference was called to order by Mr. MOREHEAD, of Kentucky, who proposed the name of the honorable JOHN C. WRIGHT, of Ohio, as temporary Chairman.  The motion of Mr. MOREHEAD was unanimously adopted.  Mr. WRIGHT was conducted to the Chair by Mr. MEREDITH, of Pennsylvania, and Mr. CHASE, of Ohio, and proceeded to address the Conference as follows:  My warmest thanks are due to you, Gentlemen, for the undeserved honor which you have conferred upon me, in selecting me for the purpose of temporarily presiding over your deliberations. We have come together to secure a common and at the same time a most important object--to agree if we can upon some plan for adjusting the unhappy differences which distract the country, which will be satisfactory to ourselves and those we represent. We have assembled as friends, as brothers, each, I doubt not, animated by the most friendly sentiments.  If we enter upon, and with these sentiments carry through, a patient examination of the difficulties which now surround the Government, the result will be, it must be, a success, earnestly hoped for by every lover of his country; a result which will establish the Union according to the spirit of the Constitution.  For myself, I may say that I have come here with the earnest purpose of doing justice to all sections of the Union. I will hear with a patient and impartial mind all that may be said in favor of, or against such amendments of the Constitution as may be proposed. Such of them as will give to the Government permanence, strength, and stability, as will tend to secure to any State, or any number of States, the quiet and unmolested enjoyment of their rights under it, shall receive my cordial support. My confidence in republican institutions, in the capacity of the people for self-government, has been increased with every year of a life which has been protracted beyond the term usually allotted to man. That life is now drawing to a close, and I hope, when it ends, I may leave the Government more firmly established in the affections of my countrymen than it ever was before. To this end I have always labored, and shall continue to labor while I live. I pray GOD that He will be with us during our deliberations, and that He may guide them to a happy and wise conclusion.  Mr. BENJAMIN C. HOWARD, a commissioner from the State of Maryland, was unanimously appointed temporary Secretary.  The Roll of the States was then called over, and commissioners representing the following were found to be present:  New Hampshire, Rhode Island, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, Kentucky, Ohio, Indiana.  Mr. PRICE, of New Jersey:--I am informed that a number of Reporters for the press are at the door of the hall, desiring admittance to this Conference, for the purpose of reporting our proceedings. Whatever may be the ultimate action of the Conference in this respect, I can see no objection to the admission of reporters to-day, for our business will relate wholly to organization. I hope we shall admit them, and I make that motion.  Mr. SEDDON, of Virginia:--I hope this motion will not prevail. I do not see that any good can possibly come of giving publicity now, to our proceedings. On the contrary, in the present excited condition of the country, I can see how much harm might result from that publicity. It is not unlikely that wide differences of opinion will be found to exist"]]]
