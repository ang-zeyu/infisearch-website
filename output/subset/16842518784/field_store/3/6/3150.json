All in vain. Everybody was in a hurry, and nobody sported the Brackenfield colours.  \"We shall have to get a taxi and manage as best we can,\" sighed Marjorie. \"I wish the porters weren't so stupid! I can't make them listen to me. The taxis will all be taken up if we're not quick! Oh, I say, there's that Tommy again! I wonder if he'd hail us one. I declare I'll ask him.\"  \"Hail you a taxi? With pleasure!\" replied the young soldier, as Marjorie impulsively stopped him and urged her request. \"Have you got your luggage this time?\"  \"Yes, yes, it's all here, and we've found a porter, only he's so slow, and----\"  \"Are you Marjorie and Dona Anderson?\" interrupted a sharp voice. \"I've been looking for you everywhere. Who is this you're speaking to? _You don't know?_ Then come along with me immediately. No, certainly not! I'll get a taxi myself. Where is your luggage?\"  The speaker was tall and fair, with light-grey eyes and pince-nez. She wore the unmistakable Brackenfield badge, so her words carried authority. She bustled the girls off in a tremendous hurry, and their good Samaritan of a soldier melted away amongst the crowd.  \"I've been waiting hours for you. How did you miss your train?\" asked the mistress. \"Why didn't you go and stand under the clock, as you were told in the Head Mistress's letter? And don't you know that you must _never_ address strangers?\"  \"She's angry with you for speaking to the Tommy,\" whispered Dona to Marjorie, as the pair followed their new guardian.  \"I can't help it. He would have got us a taxi, and now they're all gone, and we must put up with a four-wheeler. I couldn't see any clock, and no wonder we missed her in such a crowd. I think she's hateful, and I'm not going to like her a scrap.\"  \"No more am I,\" returned Dona.     CHAPTER II  Brackenfield College   Brackenfield College stood on the hills, about a mile from the seaside town of Whitecliffe. It had been built for a school, and was large and modern and entirely up-to-date. It had a gymnasium, a library, a studio, a chemical laboratory, a carpentering-shop, a kitchen for cooking-classes, a special block for music and practising-rooms, and a large assembly hall. Outside there were many acres of lawns and playing-fields, a large vegetable garden, and a little wood with a stream running through it. The girls lived in three hostels--for Seniors, Intermediates, and Juniors--known respectively as St. Githa's, St. Elgiva's, and St. Ethelberta's. They met in school and in the playgrounds, but, with a few exceptions, they were not allowed to visit each other's houses.  Marjorie and Dona had been separated on their arrival, the former being entered at St. Elgiva's and the latter at St. Ethelberta's, and it was not until the afternoon of the day following that they had an opportunity of meeting and comparing notes. To both life had seemed a breathless and confusing whirl of classes, meals, and calisthenic exercises, with a continual ringing of bells and marching from one room to another. It was a comfort at last to have half an hour when they might be allowed to wander about and do as they pleased.  \"Let's scoot into that little wood,\" said Marjorie, seizing Dona by the arm. \"It looks quiet, and we can sit down and talk. Well, how are you getting on? D'you like it so far?\"  Dona flung herself down under a larch tree and shook her head tragically.  \"I hate it! But then, you know, I never expected to like it. You should see my room-mates!\"  \"You should just see mine!\"  \"They can't be as bad as mine.\"  \"I'll guarantee they're worse. But go on and tell about yours.\"  \"There's Mona Kenworthy,\" sighed Dona. \"She looked over all my clothes as I put them away in my drawers, and said they weren't as nice as hers, and that she'd never dream of wearing a camisole unless it was trimmed with real lace. She twists her hair in Hinde's wavers every night, and keeps a pot of complexion cream on her dressing-table. She always uses stephanotis scent that she gets from one special place in London, and it costs four and sixpence a bottle. She hates bacon for breakfast, and she has seventeen relations at the front. She's thin and brown, and her nose wiggles like a rabbit's when she talks.\"  \"I shouldn't mind her if she'd keep to her own cubicle,\" commented Marjorie. \"Sylvia Page will overflow into mine, and I find her things dumped down on my bed. She's nicer than Irene Andrews, though; we had a squabble last night over the window. Betty Moore brought a whole box of chocolates with her, and she ate them in bed and never offered a single one to anybody else. We could hear her crunching for ages. I don't like Irene, but I agreed with her that Betty is mean!\"  \"Nellie Mason sleeps in the next cubicle to me,\" continued Dona, bent on retailing her own woes. \"She snores dreadfully, and it kept me awake, though she's not so bad otherwise. Beatrice Elliot is detestable. She found that little Teddy bear I brought with me, and she sniggered and asked if I came from a kindergarten. I've calculated there are seventy-four days in this term. I don't know how I'm going to live through them until the holidays.\"  \"Hallo!\" said a cheerful voice. \"Sitting weeping under the willows, are you? New girls always grouse. Miss Broadway's sent me to hunt you up and do the honours of the premises. I'm Mollie Simpson. Come along with me and I'll show you round.\"  The speaker was a jolly-looking girl of about sixteen, with particularly merry blue eyes and a whimsical expression. Her dark curly hair was plaited and tied with broad ribbons.  \"We've been round, thanks very much,\" returned Marjorie to the new-comer.  \"Oh, but that doesn't count if you've only gone by yourselves! You wouldn't notice the points. Every new girl has got to be personally conducted by an old one and told the traditions of the place. It's a sort of initiation, you know. We've a regular freemasons' code here of things you may do or mustn't. Quick march! I've no time to waste. Tea is at four prompt.\"  Thus urged, Marjorie and Dona got up, shook the pine needles from their dresses, and followed their cicerone, who seemed determined to perform her office of guide in as efficient a fashion as possible.  \"This is the Quad,\" she informed them. \"That's the Assembly Hall and the Head's private house, and those are the three hostels. What's it like in St. Githa's? I can't tell you, because I've never been there. It's for Seniors, and no Intermediate or Junior may pop her impertinent nose inside, or so much as go and peep through the windows without getting into trouble. They've carpets on the stairs instead of linoleum, and they may make cocoa in their bedrooms and fill their own hot-water bags, and other privileges that aren't allowed to us luckless individuals. They may come and see us, by special permission, but we mayn't return the visits. By the by, you'd oblige me greatly if you'd tilt your chapeau a little farther forward. Like this, see!\"  \"Why?\" questioned Marjorie, greatly astonished, as she made the required alteration to the angle of her hat.  \"Because only Seniors may wear their sailors on the backs of their heads. It's a strict point of school etiquette. You may jam on your hockey cap as you like, but not your sailor.\"  \"Are there any other rules?\" asked Dona.  \"Heaps. Intermediates mayn't wear bracelets, and Juniors mayn't wear lockets, they're limited to brooches. I advise you to strip those trinkets off at once and stick them in your pockets. Don't go in to tea with them on any account.\"  \"How silly!\" objected Dona, unclasping her locket, with Father's photo in it, most unwillingly.  \"Now, look here, young 'un, let me give you a word of good advice at the beginning. Don't you go saying anything here is silly. The rules have been made by the Seniors, and Juniors have got to put up with them and keep civil tongues in their heads. If you want to get on you'll have to accommodate yourself to the ways of the place. Any girl who doesn't has a rough time, I warn you. For goodness' sake don't begin to blub!\"  \"Don't be a cry-baby, Dona,\" said Marjorie impatiently. \"She's not been to school before,\" she explained to Mollie, \"so she's still feeling rather home-sick.\"  Mollie nodded sympathetically.  \"I understand. She'll soon get over it. She's a decent kid. I'm going to like her. That's why I'm giving her all these tips, so that she won't make mistakes and begin wrong. She'll get on all right at St. Ethelberta's. Miss Jones is a stunt, as jinky as you like. Wish we had her at our house.\"  \"Who is the Head of St. Elgiva's?\"  \"Miss Norton, worse luck for us!\"  \"Not the tall fair one who met us in London yesterday?\"  \"The same.\"  \"Oh, thunder! I shall never get on with her, I know.\"  \"The Acid Drop's a rather unsweetened morsel, certainly. You'll have to mind your p's and q's. She can be decent to those she likes, but she doesn't take to everybody.\"  \"She hasn't taken to me--I could see it in her eye at Euston.\"  \"Then I'm sorry for you. It isn't particularly pleasant to be in Norty's bad books. If you missed your train and kept her waiting she'll never forgive you. Look out for squalls!\"  \"What's the Head like?\"  \"Mrs. Morrison? Well, of course, she's nice, but we stand very much in awe of her. It's a terrible thing to be sent down to her study. We generally see her on the platform. We call her 'The Empress', because she's so like the pictures of the Empress Eug√©nie, and she's so dignified and above everybody else. Hallo, there's the first bell! We must scoot and wash our hands. If you're late for a meal you put a penny in the missionary box.\"  Marjorie walked into the large dining-hall with Mollie Simpson. She felt she had made, if not yet a friend, at least an acquaintance, and in this wilderness of fresh faces it was a boon to be able to speak to somebody. She hoped Mollie would not desert her and sit"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25152"],["title","All for a Scrap of Paper: A Romance of the Present War (#1)"],["body","silly?\" was Bob's retort.  \"I was in Germany last summer with my mother, and we had a great time. She knew some German families there, and we became great friends with them.  They don't want war any more than we do.  All they desire is to develop their own resources and to live their lives quietly.\"  \"Then what is the meaning of their huge army?  Why are they trying to build a navy that shall out-match ours?\"  \"Of course there is a large war party in Germany just as there is in England; but, as a people, they are as peace-loving as we are.  Why, a war with Germany is unthinkable, and it would be the greatest crime in history to draw our sword against them.  Even supposing we had a quarrel with them, nothing could be more revolting to humanity than to settle it by blood.\"  \"I don't wonder that you will not go into the Army if those are your views,\" replied Captain Pringle.  \"You talk like a peace-at-any-price parson.\"  From Clifton Bob went on to Oxford, where he became known as a \"reading man.\"  His ostensible purpose was to read for the Bar, after taking his degree; but he secretly hoped to obtain a Fellowship at his college, and settle down to a scholastic life.  While he was at Oxford Bob became acquainted with a Professor, named Dr. Renthall, who had been an undergraduate there with his father. Professor Renthall was also a Friend, and it was perhaps this fact that first drew them together.  For while Bob did not in any way profess adherence to the Society of Friends, he greatly admired those of that persuasion.  In addition to this, too, his father's influence was still strong upon him.  The boy revered his father's memory, and treasured in his heart those faiths by which Dr. Nancarrow had steered his life. Indeed, during his Oxford days he often declared that the Quakers were nearer to the ideal of Christianity than any other body.  \"My father was logical at all events,\" he often reflected, \"and as a consequence his life was a benediction.  On the other hand, religion among most people, whether churchmen or nonconformists, seems to mean nothing.  We attend so many 'chapels' as a matter of necessity, and are glad when they are over.  As to religion having any effect on our lives, it seems to be out of the question.\"  Dr. Renthall had a great influence over Bob.  Although he was nearing fifty, he was a keen sportsman.  He played a scratch game at golf, and during the cricket season he could keep his end up with the best of the younger men.  This appealed to the young fellow strongly.  But, more than this, he was one of the greatest authorities on history in the University.  He was a saint too, although he made little profession of Christianity.  He went regularly to the Meeting House, but never spoke, while his theology was of too latitudinarian a nature, to be \"sound.\"  Robert often went to Dr. Renthall's house, and it was during his many visits that his hatred of war grew.  \"War,\" said the Professor to him more than once, \"cannot obtain where there is real Christianity.  That is why Christianity is dying in this country.  We are being more and more filled with the spirit of militarism, which means the death of religion; while every new Dreadnought, which drains the nation of its treasure, is another nail driven into the Cross of Christ.\"  When Bob returned to St. Ia this summer, the influence of his father's life, and his association with Dr. Renthall, had done their work.  He detested militarism, and he hated the thought of war.  Not that the thought of war loomed largely in the horizon.  The country was at peace, and as far as he could judge no war-cloud hung in the sky.  \"Ah, there she is!\" Bob exclaimed, as presently the car drew up in front of the door of the great house, and a few seconds later he was talking eagerly with old Admiral Tresize, at the same time casting fervent glances towards Nancy.  It was no wonder that Bob loved her, for no fairer or better girl lived in the land of Tre, Pol, and Pen.  I, who have known her all her life, can testify to this, and as she stood there that day, young, happy, and beautiful, it was no wonder that his heart burned with a great love.  \"You'll almost have time for a run to Land's End,\" said the Admiral, looking at his watch, \"and it's a glorious afternoon.\"  \"No, we are going to picnic in the good old-fashioned way,\" said Nancy. \"We are going to have tea on the headland, after which we are going to quarrel about things generally.  We always do.\"  The Admiral laughed.  He had not the slightest hesitation about allowing Bob and Nancy to go to Gurnard's Head together.  They had been playfellows and friends all their lives, as for their being anything else, the thought never occurred to him.  \"Off you go,\" he said, \"and mind you take great care of her, Bob.\"  Admiral Tresize liked Bob very much, and always welcomed him to Penwennack.  He remembered that he had Trelawney blood in his veins, and, although his father had been a Quaker doctor, he made no secret of the fact that he liked the boy, and he often spoke of him as a nice, quiet, clever lad.  \"Fine-looking chap too,\" he would add; \"just the build for a soldier. Six feet in his stockings, and forty inches around the chest.  But there, although he has the looks of a Trelawney, he has the views of his Quaker father, and it's no use talking about it.  But it's a pity all the same, a great pity.\"  \"Well, Bob, I hear you have done great things at Oxford.  Astonished the professors, swept everything before you, and all that sort of thing,\" said Nancy, as presently they stood on the headland.  Bob laughed, and looked rather shamefaced.  He was very sensitive about his scholastic achievements, besides which he knew that Nancy thought far more of a \"blue\" than of a classical scholar.  \"You are fairly clever, you know, Bob,\" and the girl laughed as she spoke.  \"That does not count much with you, Nancy.\"  \"How do you know?  It doesn't follow that because I don't like dressing like a frump, and because I love hunting and dancing, that I don't admire cleverness.\"  \"It's not that at all, Nancy.  I know you admire clever people.  What I meant was,\" and he stammered painfully, \"that--that it's--a matter of indifference to you whether I, personally, am dull or clever.\"  \"What reason have you for saying that?\"  \"Hundreds,\" replied Bob.  \"That is--you see, you are always laughing at my desire to be 'a fusty bookworm,' as you call it, and--and, well, all that sort of thing.\"  \"Does that prove indifference?\" she replied, and Bob thought he noted a tremor in her voice.  \"You know it does,\" he went on, hating himself for talking in such a fashion, and yet unable to control his words.  \"Only yesterday, when we were talking together at tea, and some one said that I should die an old bachelor, you said that I was far more likely to die an old maid. Then, although you saw you wounded me, you went off with Captain Trevanion.\"  \"Hadn't you, just before, refused to stay the evening, although I went out of my way to persuade you?  And you gave as your excuse that you had some reading to do.  As though your--your books----\"  \"Did you want me to stay?\" asked Bob eagerly.  \"Nancy--did you really care?\"  The girl did not speak, but turned her eyes toward the great heaving sea.  Robert's heart beat wildly as he looked at her.  Never did he love her as he loved her now, never had she seemed so fair to him.  It was no wonder he had fallen in love with her, for he knew that, in spite of her love of pleasure, and her sometimes flippant way of talking, she was one of the sweetest, truest girls that ever breathed.  Although she might be wilful, and passionate, and sometimes seemed careless whether she gave pain or pleasure, she would give her last farthing to help any one in difficulty.  He had been surprised when she suggested his motoring her to Gurnard's Head that afternoon, little thinking that she did it to atone for what she had said two days before.  \"Nancy, did you want me to stay?\" he repeated.  \"If--if I thought you really----\"  \"Did it vex you that I asked Captain Trevanion to show me his new horse?\" she interrupted.  The flush on her face and the tremor of her lips set his heart beating more wildly than ever.  All caution went to the winds.  The mad passion which for years he had been trying to crush again mastered him.  He knew that his hour had come, and that he must speak and know his fate.     CHAPTER II  \"Nancy,\" repeated Bob, \"you know what is in my heart, don't you?  Know I've loved you for years?\"  \"You've never told me so,\" and there was a suggestion of a laugh in Nancy's voice.  \"Because I was afraid.  How could I dare to--to tell you--when--when you never gave a sign, and when--you seemed to like others better? Others have wanted you, I know that; fellows--better looking than I, more--more attractive than I, and with far better prospects.  I am not your sort of fellow--I know that; but--you've known all along that I loved you.  I've been afraid to tell you so, but I would willingly shed my life's blood for you.\"  \"I hate a coward!\" cried the girl.  \"Yes, I've known that; but then, how dared I speak when a fellow like Trevanion, heir to a title, and captain in a crack regiment, would give his life to get you?  What chance had I?\"  \"Then why do you tell me this now?\"  \"Because I can't help myself.  Because--Nancy, is there any chance?  I know your father would be mad, but I wouldn't mind that a bit.  Nancy, is there any hope for me?\"  Again the girl's lips became tremulous as she looked at the waves lashing themselves to foam on the great black rocks, while the sea-birds soared overhead.  It was easy to see she was greatly moved, although it was her nature to hide her feelings.  \"I don't know, Bob.\"  It did not seem like Nancy's voice at all.  It was almost hoarse, and she had a difficulty in speaking.  \"Don't know?\" he repeated.  \"Then--then----\"  \"I want to speak plainly.  Bob.  I may hurt you, although--I'll try not to."]]]
