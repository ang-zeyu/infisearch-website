They collect in their wards and turn their presents over, their eyes damp with joy; they pack up their games or their chocolate to send home to their wives who are spending Christmas in lonely cottage kitchens; they write letters to imaginary people just for the joy of using their writing blocks; they admire each others' treasures, and, sometimes, make exchanges, for the man who does not smoke has drawn a pipe, and the man in the corner over there, who has lost both legs, has drawn a pair of felt slippers!  Before they know where they are, the lunch is ready, and, children again, they eat far more than is good for them, until the nurses have to forbid them to have any more. \"No, Jones,\" they say, \"you can't have a third helping of pudding; you're supposed to be on a milk diet.\"  Oh, the happiness of it all! All day they sing and eat and talk, until you forget that there is war and misery in the world; when the evening comes they go, flushed and happy, back to their beds to dream that great black Germans are sitting on them, eating Christmas puddings by the dozen, and growing heavier with each one.  But upstairs in the little ward the mother sits with her son, and she tries with all her force to keep back the tears. They have had the door open all day to hear the laughter and fun, and on the table by the bed lie his presents and the choicest fruit and sweets. Until quite late at night she stays there, holding her son's hand, and telling of Christmases when he was a little boy. Then, when she gets up to go, the man in bed turns his head towards the poor little pile of presents. \"You'd better take those, mother,\" he says. \"They won't be much use to me. But it's the happiest Christmas I've ever had.\" And all the poor woman's courage leaves her, and she stoops forward under the mistletoe and kisses him, kisses him, with tears streaming down her face.         *       *       *       *       *  Most stirring of all are the clearing hospitals near the firing line. They are crowded, and all night long fresh wounded stumble in, the mud caked on their uniforms, and their bandages soiled by dark stains. In one corner a man groans unceasingly: \"Oh, my head ... God! Oh, my poor head!\" and you hear the mutterings and laughter of the delirious.  But if the pain here is at its height, the relief is keenest. For months they have lived in hell, these men, and now they have been brought out of it all. A man who has been rescued from suffocation in a coal mine does not grumble if he has the toothache; a man who has come from the trenches and death does not complain of the agony of his wound--he smiles because he is in comfortable surroundings for once.  Besides, there is a great feeling of expectation and hope, for there is to be a convoy in the morning and they are all to be sent down to the base--all except the men who are too ill to be moved and the two men who have died in the night, whose beds are shut off by red screens. The \"cot cases\" are lifted carefully on to stretchers, their belongings are packed under their pillows, and they are carried down to the ambulances, while the walking cases wander about the wards, waiting for their turn to come. They look into their packs for the fiftieth time to make sure they have left nothing; they lean out of the windows to watch the ambulance roll away to the station; they stop every orderly who comes along to ask if they have not been forgotten, or if there will be room for them on the train; they make new acquaintances, or discover old ones. One man meets a long-lost friend with a huge white bandage round his neck. \"Hullo, you poor devil,\" he says, \"how did you get it in the neck like that? was it a bullet or a bit of a shell?\" The other swears, and confesses that he has not been hit at all, but is suffering from boils.  For, going down to the base are wounded and sick of every sort--men who have lost a limb, and men who have only the tiniest graze; men who are mad with pain, and men who are going down for a new set of false teeth; men with pneumonia, and men with scabies. It is only when the boat leaves for England that the cases can be sorted out. It is only then that there are signs of envy, and the men whose wounds are not bad enough to take them back to \"Blighty\" curse because the bullet did not go deeper, or the bit of shrapnel did not touch the bone.         *       *       *       *       *  It is a wonderful moment for the \"Tommies\" when they reach their convalescent hospital in England. Less than a week ago many of them were stamping up and down in a slushy trench wondering \"why the 'ell there's a bloomin' war on at all.\" Less than a week ago many of them never thought to see England again, and now they are being driven up to the old Elizabethan mansion that is to be their hospital.  As the ambulance draws up outside the porch, the men can see, where the hostess used to welcome her guests of old, the matron waiting with the medical officer to welcome them in. One by one they are brought into the oak-panelled hall, and a nurse stoops over them to read their names, regiments, and complaints off the little labels that are fastened to their tunic buttons. As they await their turns, they snuff the air and sigh happily, they talk, and wink, and smile at the great carved ceiling, and forget all they have gone through in the joy of that splendid moment.  Away in one of the wards a gramophone is playing \"Mother Machree,\" and the little nurse, who hums the tune to herself as she leans over each man to see his label, sees a tear crawling through the grey stubble on one's cheek. He is old and Irish, and had not hoped to hear Irish tunes and to see fair women again. But he is ashamed of his emotion, and he tells a little lie. \"Sure, an' it's rainin' outside, nurse,\" he says.  And the nurse, who knows the difference between a raindrop and a tear--for was she not standing on the step five minutes ago, admiring the stars and the moon?--knows her part well, and plays it. \"I thought I heard the rain dripping down on the porch just now,\" she says, \"I hope you poor men did not get wet,\" and she goes on to her next patient.         *       *       *       *       *  How they love those days in hospital! How the great rough men love to be treated like babies, to be petted and scolded, ordered about and praised! How grand it is to see the flowers, to feel one's strength returning, to go for drives and walks, to find a field that is not pitted by shell holes! And how cheerful they all are, these grown-up babies!  The other day I opened the door of the hospital and discovered a \"convoy\" consisting of three legless and two armless men, trying to help each other up the six low steps, and shouting with laughter at their efforts. And one of them saw the pity on my face, for he grinned.  \"Don't you worry about us,\" he said. \"I wouldn't care if I 'ad no arms nor eyes nor legs, so long as I was 'ome in Blighty again. Why\"--and his voice dropped as he let me into the secret--\"I've 'ad a li'l boy born since I went out to the front, an' I never even seed the li'l beggar yet. Gawd, we in 'orspital is the lucky ones, an' any bloke what ain't killed ought to be 'appy and bright like what we is.\"  And it is the happiness of all these men that makes hospital a very beautiful place, for nowhere can you find more courage and cheerfulness than among these fellows with their crutches and their bandages.  There was only one man--Bill Stevens--who seemed despondent and miserable, and we scarcely wondered--he was blind, and lay in bed day after day, with a bandage round his head, the only blind man in the hospital. He was silent and morbid, and would scarcely mutter a word of thanks when some man came right across the ward on his crutches to do him a trifling service, but he had begged to be allowed to stay in the big ward until the time came for him to go off to a special hostel for the men who have lost their sight. And the men who saw him groping about helplessly in broad daylight forgave him his surliness, and ceased to wonder at his despondency.  But even Bill Stevens was to change, for there came a day when he received a letter.  \"What's the postmark?\" he demanded.  \"Oxford,\" said the nurse. \"Shall I read it to you?\"  But Bill Stevens clutched his letter tight and shook his head, and it was not until lunch-time that anything more was heard of it. Then he called the Sister to him, and she read the precious document almost in a whisper, so secret was it. Private Bill Stevens plucked nervously at the bedclothes as the Sister recited the little love sentences:--How was dear Bill? Why hadn't he told his Emily what was wrong with him? That she, Emily, would come to see him at four o'clock that afternoon, and how nice it would be.  \"Now you keep quiet and don't worry,\" said the Sister, \"or you'll be too ill to see her. Why, I declare that you're quite feverish. What have you got to worry about?\"  \"You see, it's like this 'ere,\" confided Bill Stevens. \"I ain't dared to tell 'er as 'ow I was blind, and it ain't fair to ask 'er to marry a bloke what's 'elpless. She only thinks I've got it slightly, and she won't care for me any more now.\"  \"You needn't be frightened,\" said the Sister. \"If she's worth anything at all, she'll love you all the more now.\" And she tucked him up and told him to go to sleep.  Then, when Emily arrived, the Sister met her, and broke the news. \"You love him, don't you?\" she asked, and Emily blushed, and smiled assent through her tears.  \"Then,\" said the Sister, \"do your best to cheer him up. Don't let him think you're distressed at his blindness,\" and she took the girl along to the ward where Bill Stevens lay waiting, restless and feverish.  \"Bill darling,\" said Emily. \"It's me. How are you? Why have you got that bandage on?\" But long before poor Bill could find words to break the news to her she stooped over him"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25470"],["title","Mud and Khaki: Sketches from Flanders and France (#2)"],["body","whispered: \"Bill dear, I could almost wish you were blind, so that you'd have to depend on me, like. If it wasn't for your own pain, I'd wish you was blind, I would really.\"  For a long time Bill stuttered and fumbled for words, for his joy was too great. \"I am blind, Em'ly,\" he murmured at last.  And the whole ward looked the other way as Emily kissed away his fears. As for Bill Stevens, he sang and laughed and talked so much that evening that the Matron had to come down to stop him.  For, as my legless friend remarked, \"We in 'orspital is the lucky ones, an' any bloke what ain't killed ought to be 'appy and bright like we is.\"     II  A RECIPE FOR GENERALS   Everyone is always anxious to get on the right side of his General; I have chanced upon a recipe which I believe to be infallible for anyone who wears spurs, and who can, somehow or other, get himself in the presence of that venerated gentleman.  I sat one day in a trench outside my dug-out, eating a stew made of bully beef, ration biscuits, and foul water. Inside my dug-out, the smell of buried men was not conducive to a good appetite; outside, some horrible Hun was amusing himself by firing at the sandbag just above me, and sending showers of earth down my neck and into my food. It is an aggravating fact that the German always makes himself particularly objectionable about lunch-time, and that, whenever you go in the trench, his bullets seem to follow you--an unerring instinct brings them towards food. A larger piece of earth than usual in my stew routed the last vestige of my good-humour. Prudence warning me of the futility of losing my temper with a Hun seventy yards away, I called loudly for my servant.  \"Jones,\" I said, when he came up, \"take away this stuff. It's as bad as a gas attack. I'm fed up with it. I'm fed up with Maconochie, I'm fed up with the so-called 'fresh' meat that sometimes makes its appearance. Try to get hold of something new; give me a jugged hare, or a pheasant, or something of that kind.\"  \"Yessir,\" said Jones, and he hurried off round the traverse to finish my stew himself.  It never does to speak without first weighing one's words. This is an old maxim--I can remember something about it in one of my first copy-books; but, like most other maxims, it is never learnt in real life. My thoughtless allusion to \"jugged hare\" set my servant's brain working, for hares and rabbits have, before now, been caught behind the firing line. The primary difficulty, that of getting to the country haunted by these animals, was easily solved, for, though an officer ought not to allow a man to leave a trench without a very important reason, the thought of new potatoes at a ruined farm some way back, or cherries in the orchard, generally seems a sufficiently important reason to send one's servant back on an errand of pillage. Thus it was that, unknown to me, my servant spent part of the next three days big-game hunting behind the firing line.  My first intimation of trouble came to me the day after we had gone back to billets for a rest, when an orderly brought me a message from Brigade Headquarters. It ran as follows:--     \"Lieut. Newcombe is to report at Brigade Headquarters this afternoon    at 2 p.m. to furnish facts with reference to his servant, No. 6789,    Pte. Jones W., who, on the 7th inst., discharged a rifle behind the    firing line, to the great personal danger of the Brigadier, Pte.    Jones's Company being at the time in the trenches.       \"(_Signed_) G. MACKINNON,      \"_Brigade Major_.\"  \"Jones,\" I cried, \"come and explain this to me,\" and I read him the incriminating document.  My servant's English always suffers when he is nervous.  \"Well, sir,\" he began, \"it 'appened like this 'ere. After what you said the other day abaht bully beef, I went orf ter try ter git a rebbit or an 'are. I seen sev'ral, sir, but I never 'it one nor wired one. Then, on Friday, jest as I was shootin' at an 'ole 'are what I see, up kime an orficer, one o' thim Staff gints. 'Who are you?' 'e asks. I told 'im as I was a servant, and was jest tryin' ter git an 'are fer my bloke--beggin' yer pardon, sir, I mean my orficer. Then, after a lot more talk, 'e says, 'Do yer know that yer gone and nearly 'it the Gen'ril?' That's all as I knows abaht it, sir. I never wanted ter 'it no Gen'ril.\"  \"All this, and not even a rabbit!\" I sighed. \"It's a serious business, and you ought to have known better than to go letting off ammunition behind the firing line. However, I'll see what can be done,\" and my servant went away, rather crestfallen, to drown his sorrows in a glass of very mild, very unpleasant Belgian beer.  An hour or two later, I strolled across to a neighbouring billet to see a friend, and to tell him of my coming interview.  \"You'll get hell,\" was his only comfort. Then, as an afterthought, he said, \"You'd better wear my spurs; they'll help to impress him. A clink of spurs will make even your salute seem smart.\"  Thus it was that I, who am no horseman, rode over to Brigade Headquarters, a mile away, with my toes turned in, and a pair of bright and shining spurs turned away as far as possible from my horse's flanks.  Unhappy and ill at ease, I was shown into the General's room.  \"Mr. Newcombe,\" he began, after a preliminary glance at a paper in front of him, \"this is a very serious matter. It is a serious offence on the part of Private Jones, who, I understand, is your servant.\"  \"Yes, sir.\"  \"It is also an example of gross carelessness on your part.\"  \"Yes, sir.\"  \"I was returning from the trenches on your right on Friday last, when a bullet flew past my head, coming from the direction opposed to the Germans. I have a strong objection to being shot at by my own men, right behind the fire trenches, so I sent Captain Neville to find out who had fired, and he found your servant.\"  \"Yes, sir.\"  \"Well, can you give any explanation of this extraordinary event?\"  I explained to the best of my ability.  \"It is a very unusual case,\" said the General, when I had finished. \"I do not wish to pursue the matter further, as you are obviously the real person to blame.\"  \"Yes, sir.\"  \"I am very dissatisfied about it, and you must please see that better discipline is kept. I do not like to proceed against officers under my command, so the matter drops here. You must reprimand your servant very severely, and, I repeat, I am very dissatisfied. You may go, Mr.\"--here another glance at the paper before him--\"Newcombe. Good afternoon.\"  I brought my heels together for a very smart salute ... and locked my spurs! For some seconds I stood swaying helplessly in front of him, then I toppled forward, and, supporting myself with both hands upon his table, I at length managed to separate my feet. When I ventured to look at him again to apologise, I saw that his frown had gone, and his mouth was twitching in a strong inclination to laugh.  \"You are not, I take it, Mr. Newcombe, quite accustomed to wearing spurs?\" he said presently.  I blushed horribly, and, in my confusion, blurted out my reason for putting them on. This time he laughed unrestrainedly. \"Well, you have certainly impressed me with them.\" Then, just as I was preparing to go, he said, \"Will you have a glass of whisky, Newcombe, before you go? Neville,\" he called to the Staff Captain in the next room, \"you might ask Andrews to bring the whisky and some glasses.\"  \"Good afternoon,\" said the General, very affably, when, after a careful salute, I finally took my leave.  Let anyone who will try this recipe for making friends with a General. I do not venture to guarantee its infallibility, however, for that depends entirely on the General himself, and, to such, rules and instruction do not apply.     III  \"MUD!\"   Those at home in England, with their experience of war books and photographs, of Zeppelin raids and crowded hospitals, are beginning to imagine they know all there is to know about war. The truth is that they still have but little idea of the life in the trenches, and, as far as mud is concerned, they are delightfully ignorant. They do not know what mud is.  They have read of Napoleon's \"Fourth Element,\" they have listened to long descriptions of mud in Flanders and France, they have raised incredulous eyebrows at tales of men being drowned in the trenches, they have given a fleeting thought of pity for the soldiers \"out there\" as they have slushed home through the streets on rainy nights; but they have never realised what mud means, for no photograph can tell its slimy depth, and even the pen of a Zola or a Victor Hugo could give no adequate idea of it.  And so, till the end of the war, the old story will be continued--while the soldier flounders and staggers about in that awful, sucking swamp, the pessimist at home will lean back in his arm-chair and wonder, as he watches the smoke from his cigar wind up towards the ceiling, why we do not advance at the rate of one mile an hour, why we are not in Berlin, and whether our army is any good at all. If such a man would know why we are not in German territory, let him walk, on a dark night, through the village duck-pond, and then sleep in his wet clothes in the middle of the farmyard. He would still be ignorant of mud and wet, but he would cease to wonder and grumble.  It is the infantryman who suffers most, for he has to live, eat, sleep, and work in the mud. The plain of dragging slime that stretches from Switzerland to the sea is far worse to face than the fire of machine guns or the great black trench-mortar bombs that come twisting down through the air. It is more terrible than the frost and the rain--you cannot even stamp your feet to drive away the insidious chill that mud always brings. Nothing can keep it from your hands and face and clothes; there is no taking off your boots to dry in the trenches--you must lie down just as you are, and often you are lucky if you have two empty sandbags under you to save you from the cold embrace of the swamp.  But if the"]]]
