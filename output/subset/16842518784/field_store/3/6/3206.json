There it runs and runs, all the time--all day, and all night; all summer, and all winter; all this year, and all last year, and every year. Where can all the water come from?\"  Then he thought that he should like to follow the brook up, and find where it came from; but he concluded that it must be a great way to go, through bushes, and rocks, and marshes; and he saw at once that the expedition was out of the question for him.  Just then he heard another gurgling in the water near him, and, looking down, he saw more bubbles coming up to the surface, very near where they had come up before. Rollo thought he would get a stick, and see if he could not poke up the mud, and find out what there was down there, to make such a bubbling. He thought that perhaps it might be some sort of animal blowing.  He went off of the bridge, therefore, and began to look about for a stick. He had just found one, when all at once he heard a noise in the bushes. He looked up suddenly, not knowing what was coming, but in a moment saw Jonas walking along towards him.  \"Ah, Jonas,\" said Rollo, \"are you going home?\"  \"Yes,\" said Jonas, \"unless you will go for me.\"  \"Well,\" said Rollo, \"what do you want me to get?\"  \"I want some fire, to burn up some brush. You can bring out the lantern.\"  \"Very well,\" said Rollo, \"I will go; only I wish you would tell me where these bubbles come from out of the bottom of the brook.\"  \"What bubbles?\" said Jonas.  So Rollo took his stick, and pushed the end of it down into the mud, and that made more bubbles come up.  \"They are bubbles of air,\" said Jonas.  \"But how comes the air down there,\" said Rollo, \"under the water?\"  \"I don't know,\" said Jonas; \"and besides I must not stay and talk here; I must go back to my work. I will talk to you about it when you come back.\" So Jonas returned to his work, and Rollo went to the house again after the lantern.  When he came back to the brook, he found that he could not make any more bubbles come up; but instead of that, his attention was attracted by some curiously colored pebbles near the shore. He put his hand down into the water, and took up two or three of them. He thought they were beautiful. Then he took his dipper, which had, all this time, been lying forgotten by the side of a log, on the shore, and walked along--the dipper full of raspberries in one hand, the lantern in the other, and his bright and beautiful pebbles in his pocket.  Rollo followed the path along the banks of the brook under the trees, until at length he came out to the open ground where Jonas was at work. There was a broad meadow, or rather marsh, which extended back to some distance from the brook, and beyond it the land rose to a hill. Just at the foot of this high land, at the side of the marsh farthest from the brook, was a pool of water, which had been standing there all summer, and was half full of green slime. Jonas had been at work, cutting a canal, or drain, from the bank of the brook back to this pool, in order to let the water off. The last time that Rollo had seen the marsh, it had been very wet, so wet that it was impossible for him to walk over it; it was then full of green moss, and sedgy grass, and black mire, with tufts of flags, brakes, and cranberry-bushes, here and there all over it. If any person stepped upon it, he would immediately sink in, except in some places, where the surface was firm enough to bear one up, and there the ground quivered and fluctuated under the tread, for some distance around, showing that it was all soft below.  When Rollo came out in view of the marsh, he saw Jonas at work away off in the middle of it, not very far from the pool. So he called out to him in a very loud voice,  \"Jo--nas!----hal--lo!\"[A]  [Footnote A: See Frontispiece.]  Jonas, who had been stooping down at his work, rose up at hearing this call, and replied to Rollo.  Rollo asked him how he should get across to him.  \"O, walk right along,\" said Jonas; \"the ground is pretty dry now. Go up a little farther, and you will find my canal, and then you can follow it directly along.\"  So Rollo walked on a little farther, and found the canal where it opened into the brook. He then began slowly and cautiously to walk along the side of the canal, into the marsh; and he was surprised to find how firm and dry the land was. He thought it was owing to Jonas's canal.  \"Jonas,\" said he, as he came up to where Jonas was at work, \"this is an excellent canal; it has made the land almost dry already.\"  \"O, no,\" said Jonas, \"my canal has not done any good yet.\"  \"What makes the bog so dry, then?\" said Rollo.  \"O, it has been drying all summer, and draining off into the brook.\"  \"Draining off into the brook?\" repeated Rollo.  \"Yes,\" said Jonas.  \"But there is not any drain,\" said Rollo; \"at least there has not been, until you began to make your canal.\"  \"But the water soaks off slowly through the ground, and oozes out under the banks of the brook.\"  \"Does it?\" said Rollo.  \"Yes,\" said Jonas; \"and the only use of my canal is to make it run off faster.\"  \"Ah! now I know,\" said Rollo, half talking to himself.  \"Know what?\" asked Jonas.  \"Why, where all the water of the brook comes from; at least, where some of it comes from.\"  \"How?\" said Jonas. \"I don't know what you mean.\"  \"Why, I could not think where all the water came from, to keep the brook running so fast all the time. But now I know that some of it has been coming all the time from this bog. Does it all come from bogs?\"  [Illustration]  \"Yes, from bogs, and hills, and springs, and from the soakings of all the land it comes through, from where it first begins.\"  \"Where does it first begin?\" said Rollo.  \"O, it begins in some bog or other, perhaps; just a little dribbling stream oozing out from among roots and mire, and it continually grows as it runs.\"  \"Is that the way?\" said Rollo.  \"Yes,\" said Jonas, \"that is the way.\"  During all this time Rollo had been standing with his lantern and his dipper in his hands, while Jonas had continued his digging. Rollo now put the lantern down, and handed the dipper to Jonas, telling him that he had brought him some raspberries.  Jonas seemed quite pleased with his raspberries. While he was eating them, Rollo asked him if a raspberry was a seed.  \"No,\" said Jonas. \"The whole raspberry is not, the seeds are _in_ the raspberry. They are very small. When you eat a raspberry, you can feel the little seeds, by biting them with your teeth.\"  Rollo determined to pick some seeds out, and see how they looked; but Jonas told him that the way to get them out was to wash them out in water.  \"Take some of these raspberries,\" said he, \"in the dipper to the brook, and pour in some water over them. Then take a stick and jam the raspberries all up, and stir them about, and then pour off the water, but keep the seeds in. Next, pour in some more water, and wash the seeds over again, and so on, until the seeds are all separated from the pulp, and left clean.\"  \"Is that the way they get raspberry seeds?\" said Rollo.  \"Yes,\" said Jonas, \"I believe so. I never tried it myself; but I have heard them say that that is the way they do with raspberries, and strawberries, and all such fruits.\"  Rollo immediately went and washed out some seeds as Jonas had directed, and when he came back he spread them out upon a piece of birch bark to dry. While they were there, Jonas let him kindle the pile of brush wood, which he had been intending to burn. It had been lying all summer, and had got very dry. In the mean time, Jonas continued digging his canal, and was gradually approaching the pool of water. When he had got pretty near the pool, he stopped digging the canal, and went to the pool itself. He rolled a pretty large log into the edge of it, for him to stand upon; and with his hoe he dug a trench, beginning as far in the pool as he could reach with his hoe, while standing upon his log, and working gradually out towards where he had left digging the canal. The bottom of the pool was very soft and slimy; but he contrived to get a pretty deep and wide trench out quite to the margin, and a little beyond.  \"Now,\" said he to Rollo, \"I am going to dig the canal up to the end of this trench, and then the water will all run very freely.\"  There was now a narrow neck of land between the end of the canal and the beginning of the trench; and as Jonas went on digging the canal along, this neck grew narrower and narrower. Rollo began to be impatient to see the water run. He wanted Jonas to let him hoe a little passage, so as to let it begin to run a little.  \"No,\" said Jonas.  \"Why not?\" said Rollo.  \"There are two good reasons,\" he replied. \"The first is, it will spoil my work, and the second is, it will spoil your play.\"  \"What do you mean by that?\" said Rollo.  \"Why, if I let the water run a little now, it will flood me here, where I am digging, and make all muddy; and I cannot finish my canal so easily; so it will spoil my work. Then, besides, we want to see the water run in a torrent; but if I let you dig a little trench along across the neck, so as to let it off by degrees, you will not take half as much pleasure in seeing it run, as you will to wait until it is all ready. So it will spoil your play.\"  Rollo did not reply to this, and Jonas went on digging.  \"Well,\" said Rollo, after a short pause, \"I wish, Jonas, you would tell me how the bubbles of air get down into the mud, at the bottom of the brook.\"  \"I don't know,\" said Jonas.  \"It seems to me it is very extraordinary,\" said Rollo.  \"It is somewhat extraordinary. I have thought of another extraordinary phenomenon somewhat like it.\"  \"What is that?\" said Rollo.  \"The rain,\" replied Jonas.  \"The rain?\" said Rollo; \"how?\"  \"Why, the rain,\" replied Jonas, \"is water coming down out of the air; and the bubbles are air coming up out of the water.\"  \"Then it is exactly the opposite of it,\" said Rollo.  \"Yes,\" said Jonas.  \"But you said it was _like_ it.\"  \"Well, and so it is,\" Jonas "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25548"],["title","Rollo's Museum (#2)"],["body","replied.  \"Like it, and yet exactly opposite to it! Jonas, that is impossible.\"  \"Why, yes,\" said Jonas, \"the air gets down into the water, and you wonder how it can, when it is so much lighter than water. So water gets up into the air, and I wonder how it can, when it is so much heavier. So that the difficulty is just about the same.\"  \"No,\" said Rollo, \"it is just about opposite.\"  \"Very well,\" said Jonas. Jonas never would dispute. Whenever any body said any thing that he did not think was correct, he would sometimes try to explain it; but then, if they persisted, he would generally say \"Very well,\" and that would prevent all dispute. This is an excellent way to prevent disputes, or to end them when they are begun.  While Jonas was digging slowly along through the neck of land, Rollo was rambling about among the bushes, and at length Jonas heard a sudden scream from him. Jonas looked up, and saw Rollo scrambling away from a little thicket, and then presently stopping to look back, apparently frightened.  \"What now, Rollo?\" said Jonas.  \"Here is a great hornets' nest,\" said Rollo.  Jonas laid down his spade, and went to where Rollo was. Rollo pointed to a little bush, where Jonas saw, hanging to a bough, not far from the ground, a small hornets' nest, about as big as a common snow-ball, and as round. Jonas walked slowly up towards it, watching it very attentively, as he advanced.  \"O Jonas! Jonas!\" exclaimed Rollo, \"you'd better be careful. Jonas! Jonas! you'll get stung.\"  Jonas paid no attention to what Rollo was saying, but still kept moving slowly on towards the bush. When he got pretty near, he took his knife out of his pocket, and advancing one step more, he took hold of the end of the branch with one hand, and cut it off close to the tree, with the other. Rollo, in the mean time, had run backwards several steps to avoid the danger; still, however, keeping his eyes fixed upon Jonas.  Jonas brought the nest out of the thicket.  \"Jonas!\" said Rollo, in a tone of strong remonstrance, \"you are crazy.\"  \"There are no hornets in it,\" said Jonas, quietly.  He brought out the nest, and held it so that he and Rollo could see it.  \"The hornets have made it of brown paper,\" said he.  \"Brown paper,\" said Rollo. \"Where do they get the brown paper?\"  \"O, they make the brown paper too.\"  \"Ho!\" said Rollo; \"hornets can't make paper.\"  \"Think not?\" said Jonas. Jonas was always careful not to contradict, even when he supposed that Rollo was mistaken.  Rollo said he was _sure_ that hornets could not make paper. Then Jonas took off a little shred from the hornets' nest, and compared it with some brown paper which he had in his pocket; and he explained to Rollo that the hornets' nest was made of little fibres adhering to each other, just as the fibres of the paper did.  \"It is the same article,\" he said, \"and made of the same materials; only they manufacture it in a different way. So I don't see why it is not proper to call it paper.\"  \"_I_ don't think it is paper,\" said Rollo; \"nothing is paper but what men make.\"  \"Very well,\" said Jonas, \"we won't dispute about the name.\"  So Jonas returned to his work, and Rollo said that he meant to carry the hornets' nest home, and show it to Nathan. He accordingly laid it down by the side of his fire, near the dipper and the raspberry seeds.  In a short time, Jonas reduced the neck of ground, where he was digging, to a very narrow wall, and he called Rollo to come and see him let out the water. He took the shovel, and he told Rollo to take the hoe, so that, as soon as he should break down this wall, they could both be at work, digging out the passage way, so as to get it cleared as soon as possible.  He accordingly began, and soon made a breach, through which the water rushed with considerable force into the canal, and then wandered along rapidly towards the outlet into the brook. Rollo pulled away with his hoe, hauling out mud, moss, grass, and water, up upon the bank where he stood; and Jonas also kept at work clearing the passage with the spade. In a short time they had got a fine, free course for the water, and then they stood still, one on each side of the bank, watching the torrent as it poured through.  At length, the water in the pool began to subside gradually, and then it did not run so fast through the canal; and pretty soon after this, Jonas said he thought it was time for them to go home to dinner. So Rollo put up his raspberry seeds in a paper, and put them into his pocket, and carried his hornets' nest in his hand. Jonas took the dipper and the lantern, and thus the boys walked along together.     A FALSE ALARM.   As Rollo and Jonas walked along towards home, Rollo told Jonas that he thought he had been very successful in collecting curiosities that day.  \"Why, what curiosities have you got besides your hornets' nest?\" asked Jonas.  \"Why, there are my raspberry seeds,\" said Rollo; \"I think they are a curiosity; and besides that, I have got some very beautiful, bright pebbles in my pocket.\"  \"Let us see them,\" said Jonas.  So Rollo put his hand into his pocket, and drew forth several pebbles; but they were by no means as beautiful as he had imagined. They looked rough and dull.  \"They _were_ very bright, when I got them,\" said Rollo.  \"That is because they were wet,\" said Jonas. \"Pebbles always look brightest and most beautiful when they are in their own proper place, in the brook; and that is the reason why I think it is generally best to leave them there.\"  Rollo looked at his faded pebbles with an air of disappointment. He asked Jonas if there was no way of keeping them bright all the time.  \"I think it probable that they might be oiled, and the oil would not dry.\"  \"Ho!\" said Rollo, \"I should not like to have them oiled.\"  \"Nor I,\" said Jonas; \"I should rather leave them in the brook.\"  \"But is not there any other way?\"  \"They might be varnished,\" said Jonas. \"That would bring out the colors; and the varnish would dry, so that you could handle them.\"  \"That would do,\" said Rollo, \"if I only had some varnish.\"  \"But the best way is to _polish_ them,\" said Jonas.  \"How is that done?\" asked Rollo.  \"O, it is very hard to do,\" replied Jonas. \"They grind them on stones, and then they polish them on polishing wheels.\"  \"I wish I could do it,\" said Rollo.  \"It is not worth while to take so much pains with any of _your_ curiosities,\" said Jonas, \"because you very soon get tired of them, and throw them away.\"  \"O, no,\" said Rollo, \"_I_ never throw them away.\"  \"You leave them lying about the house and yard, then, and so other people throw them away.\"  Rollo knew that this was true, and so he did not contradict Jonas.  \"It's not of much use to collect curiosities,\" said Jonas, \"unless you have a museum.\"  \"A museum?\" said Rollo.  \"Yes, that is a cabinet to put them in, and keep them safe. Then, when you have done looking at them yourself, you put them away safely; and, after a time, you get a great many collected, and you take pleasure in looking them over from time to time, and showing them to other boys that come to see you.\"  \"Well,\" said Rollo, \"I should like to have a museum.\"  \"O, _you_ could not keep one,\" said Jonas.  \"Why not?\" said Rollo.  \"You have not patience and perseverance enough. You would be very much pleased with it for a day or two; but then you would get interested in other plays, and let your museum all get into disorder.\"  Rollo was silent. He knew that what Jonas said was true.  \"I don't know but that your cousin Lucy might keep a museum,\" said Jonas; \"she is more careful than you are.\"  \"And cousin James could help us find the curiosities,\" said Rollo.  \"So he could,\" said Jonas. \"I think it might be a very good plan.\"  \"But what shall we have for our cabinet to put them in?\" said Rollo.  \"Why, sometimes they have something like a book-case,\" replied Jonas, \"with shelves and glass doors. Then the curiosities are all put upon the shelves, and you can see them through the glass doors. But this can only be done with very valuable curiosities.\"  \"Why?\" asked Rollo.  \"Because such a case, with glass doors, costs a good deal of money; and it is not worth while to pay so much money only to keep common things, such as your pebble stones.\"  \"But we have got such a book-case, already made; it is in mother's chamber,\" said Rollo.  \"Yes,\" said Jonas; \"but it is full of books. Sometimes they keep a museum in the drawers of a bureau; but that is not a very good plan.\"  \"Why not?\" said Rollo.  \"Because, when you open and shut the drawers, it joggles the curiosities about.\"  \"Does it?\" said Rollo.  \"Yes,\" replied Jonas. \"But there is one thing you can do--I did not think of it before. There is a good large box in the barn, and I can put some shelves into it, and make the cover into a door; and if you want to collect a museum, you can do it in that. You can keep it out in the play room, and so it will not trouble any body in the house.\"  Jonas meant, by _the play room_, a pretty large room, in the barn, made originally for a sort of granary, but which the children were accustomed to use for a play room.  Rollo was very much pleased with this plan. He determined to collect a museum, and to put his hornets' nest in it for the first thing. As soon as he got home, as he found that dinner was not quite ready, he and Jonas went out into the barn to look at the box. It was a large box, which had been made to pack up a bureau in, so that the bureau should not get injured in the wagon which it was brought home in. As it happened, the box was smooth inside and out, and the cover of it was made of two boards, which Jonas had taken off carefully, when he took the bureau out, and had then tacked them on again; thinking that he might perhaps want it some time or other,--box, covers, and all.  Now it happened, as it generally does to persons who take care of things, that the article which Jonas thus preserved, came into use exactly. The box, he said, would be just the thing. He"]]]
