Ingenious mechanics would soon find out modes of making something to answer the purpose of wings, to strike upon the air, if there was the necessary power to work them. The great difficulty in almost all cases in mechanics is, in getting the power; there is very little difficulty in applying it to any purpose it is wanted for. So, you see, next time, Nathan, when you want to fly, you must wish, not that you had wings, but that you were strong enough to use them.\"  \"Well, father,\" said Rollo, \"men are strong enough to paddle themselves along in the water; why can't they in the air?\"  \"Because,\" said his father, \"water supports them by its buoyancy, and they have nothing to do but to move themselves along upon it. But air cannot support them; and, of course, a great part of the effort which they would make, would be required to keep them up. And then, besides, the water is generally nearly at rest, but the air is generally in a state of rapid motion.\"  \"Why, father,\" said Rollo, \"I'm sure water is sometimes in rapid motion. The rivers run very swiftly, often.\"  \"Yes,\" replied his father; \"but then, when they do, men cannot paddle, or row boats upon them. A current that should run at the rate of four or five miles an hour, would be very hard to row against. But the air is seldom in a state of less motion than that. It is very often moving at the rate of fifteen or twenty miles an hour; sometimes sixty. So, you see, there is a double reason why men cannot fly in the air, as well as paddle on the water.\"  \"If we were only light enough,\" said Rollo, \"to float in the air, then we could fly.\"  \"We could paddle about in it, when it was calm,\" replied his father, \"but that would not be flying.\"  \"Is there anything light enough to float in the air?\" said Rollo.  \"No,\" said his father, \"I don't think of any visible substance that is.\"  \"What do you mean by visible substance?\" said Nathan.  \"Why, anything that you can see,\" replied his father. \"There are some other kinds of air, which are lighter than common air, but there is nothing else, so far as I know.\"  \"Why, father, there are clouds. They float, and they are visible, I am sure.\"  \"Yes,\" said his father. \"There is some mystery about the floating of clouds. I don't fully understand it. Clouds are formed of small globules or little balls of water; and water, I should think, whatever the size of the little drops might be, would be heavier than air. And yet they seem to float. If they are large, like rain drops, they fall quickly to the ground. If they are small, like mist, they fall slowly. That I should expect. If they are finer still, like vapor or fog, I should think that they would fall still more slowly; but still I should suppose that they would descend. But they do not appear to descend; they seem to float, nearly at rest; though perhaps all the clouds we see, may be slowly descending all the time, while we do not perceive it.\"  \"The smoke goes up from the top of the chimney,\" said Rollo.  \"Yes,\" said his father, \"there is no difficulty about that. The vapor from a fire is carried up by the warm air, no doubt. Air swells when it is heated, and so becomes lighter, and rises; and the hot air from the top of the chimney carries the vapor up with it, no doubt. After it rises a little way, and becomes cool, it ceases to ascend, but floats away horizontally. Perhaps it begins to descend when it gets cool, though very slowly; and perhaps all clouds are really descending all the time, though too slowly for us to perceive the motion.\"  \"Only,\" said Rollo, \"after a little time, they would get down to the ground.\"  \"Perhaps not,\" said his father; \"for, when they get down nearer the earth, where it is warm, they may be gradually dissolved, and disappear, and thus never reach the earth. I should think they would descend, being composed of globules of water, which, however small, must, I should think, be heavier than air.\"  \"A soap bubble will float in the air,\" said Rollo.  \"I never saw one that would,\" said his father, \"unless it got into a current, which carried it up. A soap bubble--make it ever so thin--shows a tendency to descend, unless you put it out in the open air, where there are currents to carry it up. It descends very slowly, but still it descends. It is heavier than the air. I am not absolutely certain, but I believe there is no visible substance that is lighter than the air; and it is very well for us there is not.\"  \"Why, father?\" said Rollo.  \"Because, if there were any, they would immediately rise from the earth, and float upwards, till they got up where the air was so light and thin, that they could not go up any higher.\"  \"And so,\" said Rollo, \"we should lose them.\"  \"That would not be all,\" said his father. \"They would float about, above us, and, if there were enough of them, they would form a perpetual cloud over our heads, to keep out the sun, and to make the world dark and gloomy. There seems to have been no way to keep all the solid and visible substances of the earth down upon its surface, but to make them all heavier than the air.  \"And thus,\" continued his father, \"all solid substances being heavier than the air, they sink in it, like stones or iron in water. Only those that are very much expanded in surface, sink very slowly, and sometimes almost seem to float.\"  \"What do you mean by _expanded_, father?\" said Nathan.  \"Spread out,\" said his father. \"An umbrella, for example, when it is spread out, is said to be expanded; other things are expanded in a little different way. A feather is expanded, that is, it is spread out in fine filaments, which extend, in every direction, into the air, all around the stem of it. Things that are expanded take a great deal of air with them when they descend, and so can only descend slowly.\"  \"And water is expanded in a soap bubble,\" said Rollo.  \"Yes,\" replied his father, \"and there is a great deal of air included in it, which all has to be brought down when the bubble itself descends. And thus, you see, the bubble must descend slowly. Water is expanded, too, in clouds; for, in that case, it is divided into millions of small particles, by which it is spread out over a great deal of air, and cannot descend without bringing a large portion of the air with it. Men have contrived, on this principle, to make an apparatus to prevent being hurt by falling from great heights.\"  \"What is it?\" said Rollo.  \"Why, it is called a parachute. It is a sort of umbrella; in fact, it is an umbrella, only made very large. It is folded up, and fastened under a balloon, just over the car, which the man is in. Then, if the balloon bursts, or any other accident happens to it, and the man begins to fall, the parachute opens and spreads, and then the man falls very slowly. The reason is, that the parachute takes hold of a large mass of air, and brings it down with it; and so it cannot descend very fast.\"         *       *       *       *       *  A few days after this, Nathan said to Rollo, as they were playing in the yard, that he wished that he had a parachute.  \"I know where there is one,\" said Rollo.  \"A parachute,\" said Nathan; \"a real parachute?\"  \"Yes,\" said Rollo, \"or, what is the same thing, a great umbrella.\"  \"Is that just the same?\" said Nathan.  \"Yes,\" said Rollo; \"for father said that a parachute was in fact only a large umbrella; and father has got a large umbrella in the closet, and I have a great mind to go and get it for a parachute.\"  \"But you haven't got any balloon,\" said Nathan.  \"O, no matter for that,\" said Rollo.  \"Then how are you going to get up into the air?\" asked Nathan.  \"Why, I can climb up on the shed, and jump off that, and hold the umbrella over my head.\"  Just at this moment, Rollo's cousin James came into the yard, and Rollo ran to him, to explain to him about the parachute. After describing to him the construction of it, and its use by men who go up in balloons, he said he was going to get his father's umbrella, which would make an excellent parachute.  \"And then,\" continued he, \"I am going to get upon some high place, and jump off, and hold the parachute over my head, and then I shall come down as light as a feather.\"  \"O Rollo,\" said James, \"I don't believe you will.\"  \"Yes I shall,\" said Rollo: \"you see the parachute is expanded, and so brings down a great deal of air with it, and this makes it come very slowly. Air is a _real thing_, James, and it keeps the parachute back a great deal.\"  [Illustration: \"James and Nathan both ran towards him, thinking that he must be hurt.\"--Page 37.]  So Rollo ran off after the umbrella, very much interested in proving to James, by actual experiment, that the air was a real thing. When he came with it, he was himself inclined to make the first experiment from the low side of the shed. He could climb up, by means of a fence at the corner. James advised him, however, to try it first from the end of a woodpile, which was pretty high, but yet not so high as the shed. James was not quite sure that the experiment would succeed, and he was afraid that Rollo might get hurt.  Rollo said that he was not afraid to jump off the shed. He knew the parachute would bear him up. He did not believe but that he could jump off the house with it; and, at any rate, he could jump off the shed, he knew. He accordingly clambered up, and, taking his station upon the eaves, he spread the umbrella over his head, and then jumped off.  Down he came with great violence; his cap flew off in one direction, and his umbrella rolled away in another, as he had to put out both his hands, to save himself, when he reached the ground. As it was, he came down upon all fours, and in such a way, that James and Nathan both ran towards him, thinking that he must be hurt.  \"Did you hurt yourself, Rollo?\" said James.  \"No,\" said Rollo, \"not much.\"  \"I don't think the umbrella did you much good.\"  \"No,\" said Rollo, as he got up"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25234"],["title","Cum Grano Salis (#1)"],["body","MacNeil carried a secret supply of his own personal palliatives, purgatives and poly-purpose pills. He kept them carefully concealed in a small section of his space locker, and had labeled them all as various vitamin mixtures, which made them seem perfectly legal, and which was not _too_ dishonest, since many of them _were_ vitamins.  On the morning after the fire, he heaved his well-muscled bulk out of bed and scratched his scalp through the close-cropped brown hair that covered his squarish skull. He did not feel well, and that was a fact. Of course, he had been up half the night fighting the blaze, and that hadn't helped any. He fancied he had a bit of a headache, and his nerves seemed a little jangled. His insides were probably in their usual balky state. He sighed, wished he were in better health, and glanced around at the other members of the company as they rose grumpily from their beds.  He sighed again, opened his locker, took out his depilator, and ran it quickly over his face. Then, from his assortment of bottles, he began picking over his morning dosage. Vitamins, of course; got to keep plenty of vitamins in the system, or it goes all to pot on you. A, B_1, B_2, B_12, C, ... and on down the alphabet and past it to A-G. All-purpose mineral capsules, presumably containing every element useful to the human body and possibly a couple that weren't. Two APC capsules. (Aspirin-Phenacetin-Caffeine. He liked the way those words sounded; very medicinal.) A milk-of-magnesia tablet, just in case. A couple of patent-mixture pills that were supposed to increase the bile flow. (MacNeil wasn't quite sure what bile was, but he _was_ quite sure that its increased flow would work wonders within.) A largish tablet of sodium bicarbonate to combat excess gastric acidity--obviously a _horrible_ condition, whatever it was. He topped it all off with a football-shaped capsule containing Liquid Glandolene--\"_Guards the system against glandular imbalance!_\"--and felt himself ready to face the day. At least, until breakfast.  He slipped several bottles into his belt-pak after he had put on his field uniform, so that he could get at them at mealtimes, and trudged out toward the mess hall to the meager breakfast that awaited him.         *       *       *       *       *  \"Specifically,\" said Colonel Fennister, \"what we want to know is: What are our chances of staying alive until the relief ship comes?\"  He and most of the other officers were still groggy-eyed, having had too much to do to even get an hour's sleep the night before. Only the phlegmatic Major Grodski looked normal; his eyes were always about half closed.  Captains Jones and Bellwether, in charge of A and B Companies respectively, and their lieutenants, Mawkey and Yutang, all looked grim and irritable.  The civilian components of the policy group looked not one whit better. Dr. Pilar had been worriedly rubbing at his face, so that his normally neat beard had begun to take on the appearance of a ruptured mohair sofa; Dr. Petrelli, the lean, waspish chemist, was nervously trimming his fingernails with his teeth: and the M.D., Dr. Smathers, had a hangdog expression on his pudgy face and had begun drumming his fingers in a staccato tattoo on his round belly.  Dr. Pilar tapped a stack of papers that lay before him on the long table at which they were all seated. \"I have Major Grodski's report on the remaining food. There is not enough for all of us to live, even on the most extended rations. Only the strongest will survive.\"  Colonel Fennister scowled. \"You mean to imply that we'll be fighting over the food like animals before this is over? The discipline of the Space Service--\"  His voice was angry, but Dr. Pilar cut him off. \"It may come to fighting, colonel, but, even if perfect discipline is maintained, what I say will still be true. Some will die early, leaving more food for the remaining men. It has been a long time since anything like this has happened on Earth, but it is not unknown in the Space Service annals.\"  The colonel pursed his lips and kept his silence. He knew that what the biologist said was true.  \"The trouble is,\" said Petrelli snappishly, \"that we are starving in the midst of plenty. We are like men marooned in the middle of an ocean with no water; the water is there, but it's undrinkable.\"  \"That's what I wanted to get at,\" said Colonel Fennister. \"Is there any chance at all that we'll find an edible plant or animal on this planet?\"  The three scientists said nothing, as if each were waiting for one of the others to speak.         *       *       *       *       *  All life thus far found in the galaxy had had a carbon-hydrogen-oxygen base. Nobody'd yet found any silicon based life, although a good many organisms used the element. No one yet had found a planet with a halogen atmosphere, and, although there might be weird forms of life at the bottom of the soupy atmospheres of the methane-ammonia giants, no brave soul had ever gone down to see--at least, not on purpose, and no information had ever come back.  But such esoteric combinations are not at all necessary for the postulation of wildly variant life forms. Earth itself was prolific in its variations; Earthlike planets were equally inventive. Carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen, plus varying proportions of phosphorus, potassium, iodine, nitrogen, sulfur, calcium, iron, magnesium, manganese, and strontium, plus a smattering of trace elements, seem to be able to cook up all kinds of life under the strangest imaginable conditions.  Alphegar IV was no different than any other Earth-type planet in that respect. It had a plant-dominated ecology; the land areas were covered with gigantic trees that could best be described as crosses between a California sequoia and a cycad, although such a description would have made a botanist sneer and throw up his hands. There were enough smaller animals to keep the oxygen-carbon-dioxide cycle nicely balanced, but the animals had not evolved anything larger than a rat, for some reason. Of course, the sea had evolved some pretty huge monsters, but the camp of the expedition was located a long way from the sea, so there was no worry from that quarter.  At the time, however, the members of the expedition didn't know any of that information for sure. The probe teams had made spot checks and taken random samples, but it was up to the First Analytical Expedition to make sure of everything.  And this much they had discovered: The plants of Alphegar IV had a nasty habit of killing test animals.         *       *       *       *       *  \"Of course,\" said Dr. Pilar, \"we haven't tested every plant yet. We may come across something.\"  \"What is it that kills the animals?\" asked young Captain Bellwether.  \"Poison,\" said Major Grodski.  Pilar ignored him. \"Different things. Most of them we haven't been able to check thoroughly. We found some vines that were heavily laced with cyanide, and there were recognizable alkaloids in several of the shrubs, but most of them are not that direct. Like Earth plants, they vary from family to family; the deadly nightshade is related to both the tobacco plant and the tomato.\"  He paused a moment, scratching thoughtfully at his beard.  \"Tell you what; let's go over to the lab, and I'll show you what we've found so far.\"  Colonel Fennister nodded. He was a military man, and he wasn't too sure that the scientists' explanations would be very clear, but if there was information to be had, he might as well make the most of it.         *       *       *       *       *  SM/2 Broderick MacNeil kept a firm grip on his blast rifle and looked around at the surrounding jungle, meanwhile thanking whatever gods there were that he hadn't been put on the fence-mending detail. Not that he objected violently to work, but he preferred to be out here in the forest just now. Breakfast hadn't been exactly filling, and he was hungry.  Besides, this was his pet detail, and he liked it. He had been going out with the technicians ever since the base had been finished, a couple of weeks before, and he was used to the work. The biotechnicians came out to gather specimens, and it was his job, along with four others, to guard them--make sure that no wild animal got them while they were going about their duties. It was a simple job, and one well suited to MacNeil's capacities.  He kept an eye on the technicians. They were working on a bush of some kind that had little thorny-looking nuts on it, clipping bits off here and there. He wasn't at all sure what they did with all those little pieces and bits, but that was none of his business, anyway. Let the brains take care of that stuff; his job was to make sure they weren't interrupted in whatever it was they were doing. After watching the three technicians in total incomprehension for a minute or so, he turned his attention to the surrounding forest. But he was looking for a plant, not an animal.  And he finally saw what he was looking for.  The technicians paid him no attention. They rarely did. They had their job, and he had his. Of course, he didn't want to be caught breaking regulations, but he knew how to avoid that catastrophe. He walked casually toward the tree, as though he were only slightly interested in it.  He didn't know what the name of the tree was. He'd asked a technician once, and the tech had said that the tree didn't have any name yet. Personally, MacNeil thought it was silly for a thing not to have a name. Hell, _everything_ had a name.  But, if they didn't want to tell him what it was, that was all right with him, too. He called it a banana-pear tree.  Because that's what the fruit reminded him of.  The fruit that hung from the tree were six or eight inches long, fat in the middle, and tapering at both ends. The skin was a pale chartreuse in color, with heliotrope spots.  [Illustration]  MacNeil remembered the first time he'd seen one, the time he'd asked the tech what its name was. The tech had been"]]]
