With the resolution of submitting every opinion to the test of experiment, Galileo's first inquiries at Pisa were directed to the mechanical doctrines of Aristotle. Their incorrectness and absurdity soon became apparent; and with a zeal, perhaps, bordering on indiscretion, he denounced them to his pupils with an ardour of manner and of expression proportioned to his own conviction of the truth. The detection of long-established errors is apt to inspire the young philosopher with an exultation which reason condemns. The feeling of triumph is apt to clothe itself in the language of asperity; and the abettor of erroneous opinions is treated as a species of enemy to science. Like the soldier who fleshes his first spear in battle, the philosopher is apt to leave the stain of cruelty on his early achievements. It is only from age and experience, indeed, that we can expect the discretion of valour, whether it is called forth in controversy or in battle. Galileo seems to have waged this stern warfare against the followers of Aristotle; and such was the exasperation which was excited by his reiterated and successful attacks, that he was assailed, during the rest of his life, with a degree of rancour which seldom originates in a mere difference of opinion. Forgetting that all knowledge is progressive, and that the errors of one generation call forth the comments, and are replaced by the discoveries, of the next, Galileo did not anticipate that his own speculations and incompleted labours might one day provoke unmitigated censure; and he therefore failed in making allowance for the prejudices and ignorance of his opponents. He who enjoys the proud lot of taking a position in advance of his age, need not wonder that his less gifted contemporaries are left behind. Men are not necessarily obstinate because they cleave to deeply rooted and venerable errors, nor are they absolutely dull when they are long in understanding and slow in embracing newly discovered truths.  It was one of the axioms of the Aristotelian mechanics, that the heavier of two falling bodies would reach the ground sooner than the other, and that their velocities would be proportional to their weights. Galileo attacked the arguments by which this opinion was supported; and when he found his reasoning ineffectual, he appealed to direct experiment. He maintained, that all bodies would fall through the same height in the same time, if they were not unequally retarded by the resistance of the air: and though he performed the experiment with the most satisfactory results, by letting heavy bodies fall from the leaning tower of Pisa, yet the Aristotelians, who with their own eyes saw the unequal weights strike the ground at the same instant, ascribed the effect to some unknown cause, and preferred the decision of their master to that of nature herself.  Galileo could not brook this opposition to his discoveries; nor could the Aristotelians tolerate the rebukes of their young instructor. The two parties were, consequently, marshalled in hostile array; when, fortunately for both, an event occurred, which placed them beyond the reach of danger. Don Giovanni de Medici, a natural son of Cosmo, had proposed a method of clearing out the harbour of Leghorn. Galileo, whose opinion was requested, gave such an unfavourable report upon it, that the disappointed inventor directed against him all the force of his malice. It was an easy task to concentrate the malignity of his enemies at Pisa; and so effectually was this accomplished, that Galileo resolved to accept another professorship, to which he had been previously invited.  The chair of mathematics in the university of Padua having been vacant for five years, the republic of Venice had resolved to fill it up; and, on the recommendation of Guido Ubaldi, Galileo was appointed to it, in 1592, for a period of six years.  Previous to this event, Galileo had lost his father, who died, in 1591, at an advanced age. As he was the eldest son, the support of the family naturally devolved upon him; and this sacred obligation must have increased his anxiety to better his circumstances, and therefore added to his other inducements to quit Pisa. In September 1592, he removed to Padua, where he had a salary of only 180 florins, and where he was again obliged to add to his income by the labours of tuition. Notwithstanding this fruitless occupation of his time, he appears to have found leisure for composing several of his works, and completing various inventions, which will be afterwards described. His manuscripts were circulated privately among his friends and pupils; but some of them strayed beyond this sacred limit, and found their way into the hands of persons, who did not scruple to claim and publish, as their own, the discoveries and inventions which they contained.  It is not easy to ascertain the exact time when Galileo became a convert to the doctrines of Copernicus, or the particular circumstances under which he was led to adopt them. It is stated by Gerard Voss, that a public lecture of Moestlin, the instructor of Kepler, was the means of making Galileo acquainted with the true system of the universe. This assertion, however, is by no means probable; and it has been ably shown, by the latest biographer of Galileo,[5] that, in his dialogues on the Copernican system, our author gives the true account of his own conversion. This passage is so interesting, that we shall give it entire.       [5] Life of Galileo, in Library of Useful Knowledge, p. 9.  \"I cannot omit this opportunity of relating to you what happened to myself at the time when this opinion (the Copernican system) began to be discussed. I was then a very young man, and had scarcely finished my course of philosophy, which other occupations obliged me to leave off, when there arrived in this country, from Rostoch, a foreigner, whose name, I believe, was Christian Vurstisius (Wurteisen), a follower of Copernicus. This person delivered, on this subject, two or three lectures in a certain academy, and to a crowded audience. Believing that several were attracted more by the novelty of the subject than by any other cause, and being firmly persuaded that this opinion was a piece of solemn folly, I was unwilling to be present. Upon interrogating, however, some of those who were there, I found that they all made it a subject of merriment, with the exception of one, who assured me that it was not a thing wholly ridiculous. As I considered this individual to be both prudent and circumspect, I repented that I had not attended the lectures; and, whenever I met any of the followers of Copernicus, I began to inquire if they had always been of the same opinion. I found that there was not one of them who did not declare that he had long maintained the very opposite opinions, and had not gone over to the new doctrines till he was driven by the force of argument. I next examined them one by one, to see if they were masters of the arguments on the opposite side; and such was the readiness of their answers, that I was satisfied they had not taken up this opinion from ignorance or vanity. On the other hand, whenever I interrogated the Peripatetics and the Ptolemeans--and, out of curiosity, I have interrogated not a few--respecting their perusal of Copernicus's work, I perceived that there were few who had seen the book, and not one who understood it. Nor have I omitted to inquire among the followers of the Peripatetic doctrines, if any of them had ever stood on the opposite side; and the result was, that there was not one. Considering, then, that nobody followed the Copernican doctrine, who had not previously held the contrary opinion, and who was not well acquainted with the arguments of Aristotle and Ptolemy; while, on the other hand, nobody followed Ptolemy and Aristotle, who had before adhered to Copernicus, and had gone over from him into the camp of Aristotle;--weighing, I say, these things, I began to believe that, if any one who rejects an opinion which he has imbibed with his milk, and which has been embraced by an infinite number, shall take up an opinion held only by a few, condemned by all the schools, and really regarded as a great paradox, it cannot be doubted that he must have been induced, not to say driven, to embrace it by the most cogent arguments. On this account I have become very curious to penetrate to the very bottom of the subject.\"[6]       [6] Systema Cosmicum, Dial. ii. p. 121.  It appears, on the testimony of Galileo himself, that he taught the Ptolemaic system, in compliance with the popular feeling, after he had convinced himself of the truth of the Copernican doctrines. In the treatise on the sphere, indeed, which bears his name,[7] and which must have been written soon after he went to Padua, and subsequently to 1592, the stability of the earth, and the motion of the sun, are supported by the very arguments which Galileo afterwards ridiculed; but we have no means of determining whether or not he had then adopted the true system of the universe. Although he might have taught the Ptolemaic system in his lectures after he had convinced himself of its falsehood, yet it is not likely that he would go so far as to publish to the world, as true, the very doctrines which he despised. In a letter to Kepler, dated in 1597, he distinctly states that he _had, many years ago, adopted the opinions of Copernicus_; but that _he had not yet dared to publish his arguments in favour of them, and his refutation of the opposite opinions_. These facts would leave us to place Galileo's conversion somewhere between 1593 and 1597, although _many_ years cannot be said to have elapsed between these two dates.       [7] The authenticity of this work has been doubted. It was printed      at Rome, in 1656, from a MS. in the library of Somaschi, at Venice.      See Opere di Galileo, tom. vii. p. 427.

In the Patent Office Report for 1862-3 will be found the following, with the corresponding illustration in the second volume:      No. 37,145--Elijah D. Williams, of Philadelphia,     Pennsylvania--_Improvement in Elongated Bullets_--Patent dated     December 9, 1862.      This invention consists in the combination with an elongated     expanding bullet of a leaded pin and a concave expanding disc, the     disc having its concave side against the base of the bullet, and the     pin entering the cavity thereof and operating to produce the     flattening of the disc, by which it is caused _to expand against the     walls of and enter the groves of the gun_.      Claim--First, the combination with elongated expanding bullets of a     pin, C, and expanding disc, B, applied substantially as herein     specified. Second, fitting the pin to the cavity of the bullet in     the manner substantially as herein specified, whereby the expansion     of the bullet is caused to commence in the front part of its     expanding portion and to be gradually continued toward the rear as     herein set forth.  So much for the _explosive_ ball \"_sent by the Confederates_.\"  In the same volume of the Patent Office Reports will be found also the following:      No. 36,197--Ira W. Shaler, of Brooklyn, New York, and Reuben Shaler,     of Madison, Connecticut, assigned to Ira W. Shaler     aforesaid--_Improvement in Compound Bullet for Small Arms_--Patent     dated August 12, 1862.      This projectile is composed of two or more parts which fit the bore     of the barrel and so constructed that the forward end of each of the     parts in the rear of the front one enters a cavity in the rear of     the one before it, and is formed in relation to the same in such a     manner as to separate from it after leaving the barrel of the gun     and make a slight deviation in its line of flight from that of its     predecessor.      Claim--The projectile hereinbefore described, made up of two or more     parts, each of equal diameter, constructed as set forth so as to     separate from each other.  No illustration of this projectile appears in the illustrated volume of patents; but an official drawing of it from the Patent Office lies before me. The ball is slightly different from figure B (_supra_), in that it is here perfect, and figure B gives but two parts of the missile.  So much for the _poisoned_ ball \"_sent by the Confederates_.\"  Any person ought to know perfectly well that it was not necessary to invent or construct a rifle ball especially adapted to carry poison, when the common minnie ball itself, dipped into liquid poison and coated, as ball cartridges are usually finished, with wax or tallow, would have effected the same purpose.  To what extent the bullets of Williams and Shaler were used during the late war by the United States troops, the following official communication from the War Department at Washington, under date of September 16, 1879, will show:      Sir--In reply to your letter of the 9th instant to the Secretary of     War, I have to inform you that during the late war a great many of     the bullets patented by Elijah D. Williams and about 200,000 of     those patented by Ira W. Shaler were used by the United States.                 Respectfully, your obedient servant,                                S. C. LYFORD, _Acting Chief of Ordnance_.  In the _fourth_ place, in repelling and refuting the charge against the Confederates of having used explosive musket or rifle projectiles, I charge the United States Government with not only patenting, but purchasing and using, especially at the battle of Gettysburg, an _explosive musket shell_; nor do I trust to my imagination, but I present the facts, which are as follows:  In April, 1862, the Commissioner of Public Buildings at Washington brought to the attention of the Assistant Secretary of War--then Mr. John Tucker--the explosive musket shell invented by Samuel Gardiner, jr. The Assistant Secretary at once referred the matter to General James W. Ripley, who was then the Chief of the Ordnance Bureau at Washington. What action was taken will appear when it is stated that in May, 1862, the Chief of Ordnance at the West Point Military Academy made a report to the Government of a trial of the Gardiner musket shell. In May, 1862, Mr. Gardiner offered to sell some of his explosive musket shells to the Government at a stipulated price. His application was referred to General Ripley with the following endorsement:      Will General Ripley consider whether this explosive shell will be a     valuable missile in battle?                                                               A. LINCOLN.  General Ripley replied that \"it had no value as a service projectile.\"  In June, 1862, Brigadier-General Rufus King, at Fredericksburg, made a requisition for some of the Gardiner musket shells. On referring this application to the Chief of Ordnance, General Ripley, that old army officer, whose sense of right must have been shocked at this instance of barbarism, a second time recorded his disapproval, replying that \"it was not advisable to furnish any such missiles to the troops at present in service.\"  In September, 1862, the Chief of Ordnance of the Eleventh corps, United States army, recommended the shell to the Assistant Secretary of War, who ordered 10,000 rounds to be purchased--made into cartridges. Of this number, 200 were issued to Mr. Gardiner for trial by the Eleventh corps. In October, 1862, the Chief of Ordnance of the Eleventh corps, then in reserve near Fairfax Courthouse, sent in a requisition, endorsed by the General commanding the corps, for 20,000 Gardiner musket shells and cartridges. The Assistant Secretary of War referred the matter to the Chief of Ordnance, General Ripley, who for the _third_ time recorded his disapproval of such issue. Nevertheless, the Assistant Secretary of War ordered the issue to be made to the Eleventh corps of the remaining 9,800 shells and cartridges, which order was obeyed.  In November, 1862, Mr. Gardiner offered to sell to the United States his explosive musket shell and cartridge at $35 per thousand, calibre 58. The Assistant Secretary of War at once ordered 100,000, of which 75,000 were calibre 58 for infantry, and 25,000 calibre 54 for cavalry service.  In June, 1863, the Second New Hampshire volunteers made a requisition for 35,000 of these shells, and by order of the Assistant Secretary of War, they received 24,000. Of this number, 10,060 were abandoned in Virginia and 13,940 distributed to the regiment. The report of this regiment, made subsequently, shows that in the third quarter of 1863--that is, from July 1st to October 1st--about 4,000 of these shells were used in trials and target firing, and about 10,000 were used in action. The Second New Hampshire regiment was in the battle of Gettysburg, and 49 of its members lie buried in the cemetery there.  The above statement shows that the Assistant Secretary of War, against what might be regarded as the protest of the Chief of Ordnance, purchased 110,000 of the Gardiner explosive musket shells, and issued to the troops in actual service 35,000, leaving 75,000 on hand at the close of the war.  In 1866 the Russian Government issued a circular calling a convention of the Nations for the purpose of declaring against the use of explosive projectiles in war. To this circular the then Chief of Ordnance of the United States, General A. B. Dyer, made the following reply, which I have but little doubt expresses the sentiment which actuated General Ripley in his disapproval of the purchase and issue of the Gardiner musket shell:                                          ORDNANCE OFFICE, WAR DEPARTMENT,                                           WASHINGTON, August 19, 1868.      HON. J. M. SCHOFIELD, _Secretary of War_:      Sir--I have read the communication from the Russian Minister in     relation to the abolishment of the use of explosive projectiles in     military warfare, with the attention and care it well deserves.      I concur heartily in the sentiments therein expressed, and I trust     that our Government will respond unhesitatingly to the proposition     in behalf of humanity and civilization. The use in warfare of     explosive balls, so sensitive as to ignite and burst on striking a     substance as soft and yielding as animal flesh (of men or horses), I     consider barbarous and no more to be tolerated by civilized nations     than the universally reprobated practice of using poisoned missiles,     or of poisoning food or drink to be left in the way of an enemy.     Such a practice is inexcusable among any people above the grade of     ignorant savages. Neither do I regard the use in war of such     explosive balls as of any public advantage, but rather the reverse;     for it will have the effect of killing outright, rather than     wounding, and it is known that the care of wounded men much more     embarrasses the future operations of the enemy than the loss of the     same number killed, who require no further attention which may delay     or impede them.      There is a class of explosive projectiles now used, the     discontinuance of which is not demanded by humanity, and the use of     which may be considered legitimate. These are the projectiles which     can only be exploded by contact with hard, resisting substances, and     which are generally used for destroying ships, caissons, or light     fortifications, and not directly against men or animals in the     opposing ranks. These latter ought not and probably cannot be     included in an agreement or treaty to prohibit their use in warfare;     but I strongly advocate an agreement or treaty binding all civilized     nations to discontinue and forever abandon the use in war of "]]]
