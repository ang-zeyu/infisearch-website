As the salary offered for this privilege was so munificent, the young teacher eagerly accepted, and then found her youngest charge a lovable and merry girl.  The two Chicago girls had returned home for a few months, but Eleanor could not stand the high winds and stubborn climate of Chicago, so the doctor again ordered her to spend a summer in the mountains of Colorado. In distraction, Mr. Maynard begged Anne Stewart to arrange everything, and thus it was that these two society girls came, with Anne, to board with Polly's family at Pebbly Pit ranch.  The Brewsters were considered very wealthy in land and cattle, to say nothing of the Rainbow Cliffs, for which a New York financier had offered them half a million dollars for part interest in mining them. But Sam Brewster could afford to refuse such destruction to his beautiful estate. Polly had never had city-made clothing, nor had she the slightest idea of city-ways, until the Maynard girls' advent to Pebbly Pit. But she had had years of thrilling experiences to her credit--experiences with wild-life of all kinds, of mountain-climbing, of adventures of other sorts, to say nothing about knowledge of farming and domestic animals. This outdoor life gave her abundant health, strength, and the beauty of a fine complexion, clear eyes, luxuriant glossy hair, and a graceful well-formed figure that was all the more attractive because of the charms her adolescence promised.  That very day had been spent in Oak Creek in filing the claim to Montresor's Mine, and just as the party started for home, they had met the young stranger, Kenneth Evans, who sought Carew's Surveying Camp, which was known to be located near Yellow Jacket Pass. The youth was directed how to find Jake, the driver of Carew's wagon, and then he was invited to visit Pebbly Pit, on Sunday.  As Polly and Eleanor had predicted, they were so excited over the events that promised such thrills on the morrow, that they slept little that night, but tossed and talked most of the time. However, when the call sounded for them all to awake and dress for the mountain trip, it found that these two girls were fast asleep and loath to get up.  \"Good gracious, Anne! My wrist watch says it's four o'clock! You don't suppose we have to get up at this awful hour?\" complained Barbara, rubbing her eyes.  Anne was already up and hurriedly dressing. \"Any one who is not ready to start when the man brings the horses around to the door, remains behind, you know.\"  That brought Polly and Eleanor out of bed with a hop, as there was only a wooden partition between the two rooms, and Anne's words were plainly heard by them.  \"If there was the least thing to do if I stayed here, I'd not go again for anything. But I should die of ennui if I had to be entertained by Sary for three whole days,\" grumbled Barbara.  The very idea of Sary, the \"house helper,\" entertaining Barbara, for whom she felt such scorn, caused mirth in the adjoining room.  Eleanor called out: \"More than likely Sary feels as glad to know that you're going, as we would be to have you stay behind.\"  \"Come, come, Bob! You _must_ get up and dress!\" now urged Anne, as she finished her dressing and turned to leave the room.  The purple gleams of the western dawn shot the heavens of blue and gold, as Jeb brought the sturdy horses from the barn. He had given careful attention to the trappings and shoes of the various mounts, and finding each one in splendid condition, started for the house.  An unusual hubbub came from the living-room where baskets of food and outfits were waiting. The moment Jeb was hailed, however, the noisy girls ran out to look over their horses.  \"Why, Jeb! Isn't Noddy going this time?\" asked Polly.  \"Not ef you-all want her to keep any breath in her skin. Ain't she eena-most done up from that other trip?\" retorted Jeb, who was the \"general-man\" on the ranch. Having been with the Brewsters since he was a boy of twelve, he felt that he was one of the family and he treated Polly as if she were a younger sister.  \"Never mind Noddy, this time, Polly, but let Jeb jump into the saddle and start off. He'll never reach Mike's cabin if you keep on arguing about the burros,\" said Mrs. Brewster, coming out to call them to breakfast.  Jeb had gone on to secure the company of Rattle-Snake Mike, and Mr. Brewster sat impatiently on his horse, waiting to guide the party of women, when all but Barbara were ready; then she came out while still munching her tardy breakfast.  As the riders passed the Rainbow Cliffs, the rays of the rising sun gilded their peaks, and the girls exclaimed at the beauty of the stones as they reflected the myriad colors of a rainbow. Then on down through the Devil's Causeway and out on the Sand Trail, rode the adventurers, until they saw Jeb and Mike riding to meet them.  \"Mike says we-all ain't the fust ones to start up Grizzly Slide, this mornin',\" said Jeb, the moment he was within hearing.  \"U-um! Plenty fool go by!\" grunted Mike.  Mike was an entirely new type to the city girls, and they studied him with interest. He was a swarthy-looking Indian; perhaps, as Mr. Brewster said, because he smoked himself brown. He always rode his famous Indian pony and carried an evil-looking gun, besides the revolvers in his belt. Another weapon he had, as evil but not quite so fatal to others as the gun--and that was his old pipe, as black as the Asiatic plague.  Mike was a descendant of a famous Chieftain, so he seldom noticed the miners or common natives about Oak Creek, but he considered himself an equal of educated people like the Brewsters. Hence his willingness to act as guide for this party, after he had refused tempting offers from the \"scorned\" early that morning.  \"Now we'll turn off at the Forks and ride fast to meet Simms and his party,\" advised Mr. Brewster, when they reached the place where the trails forked.  \"Mike says there's the old Indian Trail up the mountain, that cuts off half the distance to the Slide,\" called Jeb, from the front.  \"Him bad trail--no like Top Notch,\" warned the Indian.  \"Whereabouts will we hit it, Mike?\" asked Mr. Brewster.  \"Onny Mike say--him secret Indian Trail,\" explained the red-man, ever faithful to his ancestors.  \"Well, will we pass Pine Tree where we are to meet Simms and the sheriff?\" added Mrs. Brewster.  \"Na! him run away from Pine Tree. But him save half-day riding.\"  Mr. Brewster silently considered this possibility for a few moments, then turned to his wife, and said: \"Mary, it seems most important just now for us to get to the cave before others reach it, as we must stake out additional claims adjoining the mine, in order to protect the rights of the girls. Of course, we must have Mike show us his secret trail, and I will go to escort the girls, but you and Jeb might ride on to Pine Tree to meet Simms' party. Then ride with them up along Top Notch Trail. We will all meet at Four Mile Blaze.\"  \"I was about to suggest the same plan, Sam; but I won't need Jeb with me. I'm so used to this road that I am perfectly safe. It is the Trail that will be hazardous to a lone rider, when once the outlaws hear of this strike. But I will have Mr. Simms and the other men with me, so everything will be safe and all right,\" replied Mrs. Brewster.  After a hasty good-by, Mrs. Brewster rode away, and the others in the party followed after Mike who led up a hitherto unknown trail to Grizzly Slide. It was so over-grown that no one but an Indian could ever find a way through; however, Mike was an adept in this line.  \"I have been wondering if this could have been the trail Mr. Montresor discovered the day he approached his gold mine from the valley,\" said Polly, as she followed close at Mike's heels.  \"You may have hit the nail on the head, Poll. It always has been a question whether Montresor was quite sane, because he insisted that he rode up a strange trail that was over-grown with jungle before he came upon the ravine that held his gold mine,\" added Mr. Brewster.  \"Humph! Him good old scout,\" came from Mike.  \"I'm glad to hear you say so, Mike, because I liked him so much!\" sighed Polly, and tears filled her eyes at the memory of her old friend.  \"Patsy good scout, too. Solly dem dead,\" Mike added.  Conversation now became impossible, as Mike rode far in advance for some reason best known to himself, and the trail was so steep and rough that it took each rider all his attention to keep in the saddle. However, the flora and fauna were so interesting that the girls endured many a jar and jolt for the sake of seeing them.  Reaching Four Mile Blaze they found they had saved over half the distance it would have been to ride up over Top Notch Trail; and this pleased Mr. Brewster tremendously. He had just turned in his saddle to call out to the girls behind him when Mike held up a warning hand.  Every one looked at him to see what he had discovered. He grunted unpleasantly, and slid from his horse. He sprawled out on the ground and placed his ear close to the earth. Every one sat still, waiting to hear the report, or cause, of this unusual behavior.  The Indian listened attentively for a time, then got up and examined the trail along Top Notch, as far back as the blazed tree. There he placed his ear to the ground again, and listened for a longer time than at first. Then he got up slowly and crept about examining the bushes, the broken twigs, rocks, and even the grass.  The girls watched him with intense interest, as Polly had told them of the wonderful scouting instinct Mike possessed, and now they were going to have it demonstrated to them. Having satisfied himself, Mike came over to Mr. Brewster and announced, abruptly:  \"Tree miner gone aleddy--two tenderfut comin'.\"  \"Three up there already! By the Great Horned Spoon! how did they do it?\" cried Sam Brewster, aghast at the idea that perhaps they would have trouble when they reached Polly's mine.  \"Maybe the three gone on ahead have no"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25419"],["title","Polly and Eleanor (#2)"],["body"," that we found gold up there. Maybe they are after pelts, or some other thing,\" said Anne Stewart.  Mike grinned complacently, for he had spoken.  \"How do you know those three are miners, Mike?\" asked Polly.  The Indian pointed to the ground where an imprint of a miner's boot was plainly seen. Only the miners at Oak Creek wore such spiked heels, the ranchers and other citizens being satisfied with heavy leather soles. The foot-print pointed towards the Slide--not away from it.  \"That's only one, Mike, and you said there were three!\" exclaimed Anne, triumphantly.  \"Tree hoss go by--see.\" Mike pointed out three different kinds of horse-shoe imprints.  \"One hoss carry pack an' go lame. Two hoss all light.\"  \"How do you know he is lame--and maybe he isn't packed,\" Eleanor said.  Mike sniffed derisively, and pointed at the lighter impression of one hind foot. Then he showed his admiring audience how a slight rip in a flour-sack allowed the contents to trickle down upon the ground at each limp the lame horse gave.  Mike now said to Mr. Brewster: \"Dem go slow--lame hoss no go fas', mebbe jus' ahead.\"  \"If we ride on we can catch up with them!\" eagerly exclaimed Anne.  Mike shook his head and lifted a finger for silence. Then the girls heard a faint clip-clop of hoof-beats on the rocky trail leading along Top Notch.  \"Two tenderfut 'mos' catch up. We-all wait an' talkee,\" suggested Mike, settling himself in his saddle to await the riders.  \"Mike's right, because they will only follow us and find out where our claim is located, if we start on now,\" added Polly.  Mr. Brewster shook his head. \"Ah reckon you-all talk sense but Ah would offer an amendment to your plan: to have Polly and Anne take Jeb for an escort and ride on at once. Let the horses have their head and get to the cave as soon as you can. Hold the fort until we-all join you. We-all will see these two men and find out what they are after.\"  \"Daddy, you must remember a grizzly bear lives in that cave. He may have been injured but he may not have died, the other night. I have my small rifle but Anne hasn't any weapon at all. As for Jeb--he's great on the farm, but for this work, huh! Then there are those three miners who are up ahead: they wouldn't hesitate to put two mere girls out of their way, if we interfered with their staking our mine or jumping our claims,\" said Polly.  Mike smiled and expressed his opinion. \"Miss'r Brooser wait wid two ten'erfut, an' Mike go wid leedle leddies. Ef cabe hab trouble of grizzle er miner, Mike shoot.\"  \"Good! And Ah'll wait for Simms and the others, and then come after you-all,\" agreed Mr. Brewster.  \"I won't go with Mike if there is any danger at the cave. I didn't come to the Rockies to be killed!\" declared Barbara.  \"Daddy, you must keep Eleanor and Barbara here with you and Jeb, and wait for mother and the sheriff's men. Anne and I will go with Mike and see that our rights are protected,\" now said Polly.  \"I have as much right to go with you, Polly, as Anne has. Why must I remain here with Bob?\" demanded Eleanor.  \"I know that, Nolla, but three of us will be too many--especially as Anne and you have no firearms. I may need Anne to help me load but you can't even do that. So it will be far better for us all if you remain here. Mike will not have to bother over so many of us, then,\" explained Polly.  \"But everything may be safe at the cave, and all this worry about fighting may be a farce,\" argued Eleanor.  \"In that case Mike will leave us safely there and come back to guide you-all to us. Once we are safe on that ledge with a pile of dry wood in front of the entrance to the cave, we can defy the whole country.\"  \"All right! Hurry away and get on to that ledge before any more rascals steal a march on you. But be sure to send Mike back for us, the moment Anne and you arrive there and find everything is all right,\" replied Eleanor.  So Mike spurred his broncho along the trail, while Polly and Anne rode after him. Soon they disappeared around the bend where giant pines formed a wall on either side of the narrow going.     CHAPTER II  THE CLAIM-JUMPERS   The moment the three had passed out of sight, Sam Brewster jumped from his horse and led him over to the great tree that caused the trail to turn aside and run around it. He looped the reins over his arm and placed his hands in his coat pockets. As he leaned against the tree-trunk nibbling nonchalantly at a sprig of grass, a tenderfoot would never have dreamed that his fingers were tensely held against the triggers of the revolvers hidden in his pockets.  Soon after Mr. Brewster had taken his stand where he could see the first appearance of any one coming up the trail, two riders approached eagerly scanning the large trees, in evident search of something. As they came to the giant tree where the rancher waited, both men started in surprise.  \"How-dy, friends? Out early this morning, eh?\" was the greeting the two amazed men received from the alert man at the tree.  \"Oh--oh, yes!\" stammered one, plainly uneasy.  \"Hoh, it's Sam Brewster of Pebbly Pit, ain't it?\" said the other, also confused in his manner.  \"Right you are, Hank. You see, when a man has to attend to the girls' gold mine, he has to be up right early to forestall the plans of any claim-jumpers who read the records at Oak Creek, yesterday, after we left there. That's why I got a possé to guard the place. I reckon, now, Hank, that your boss sent you-all on to help we-all up yonder, eh?\" laughed Mr. Brewster, tantalizingly, as he recognized Hank to be the clerk at the filing office in Oak Creek.  The man Hank laughed also, but a discordant note rang through his forced merriment. \"We-all ain't claim-jumpers, Mr. Brewster, but it seemed so quare to find Old Montresor's Mine hed ben found again, that Ah sez to my pal, here, 'How'd you-all like to run up to the Slide and have a squint at that cave?' An' havin' a day off, he reckoned he'd enjy the trip. So here we-all are.\"  \"Yes--so Ah see! Here you-all are. And Ah says to my girls and the possé, says Ah: 'There'll be a lot of fools start off at night-fall, to hit this trail to the Slide just out of dern-fool curiosity to have a squint at Old Montresor's Mine. But human nature is human nature, girls,' says Ah, so when they get that squint, they may forget one of the Ten Commandments and want to covet their neighbor's property. And seeing how they have lost a good night's sleep through climbing the Top Notch Trail just to arrive early to have that squint, they will sort of feel justified in stealing an acre, or so, of gold-land. That would make them break another Commandment; so Ah felt it a duty, Hank, to send on a regiment in advance, to save the souls of such curious sightseers.\" Sam Brewster never changed a muscle of his serious face nor did his voice have the slightest sign of any other feeling than a reverent desire to help his fellow-man. But the two men knew Sam Brewster by experience as well as from hearsay.  \"Right-o! Hank told me what a good man you war,\" said the miner who accompanied Hank. But his shifty eyes belied the tone.  Mr. Brewster smiled. \"Yes. Ah did hate to see any one lose a good night's sleep and then get thus far only to be mistaken for claim-jumpers by the Sheriff's men up yonder. Of course, Hank and you-all aren't going to take such chances with the law.\"  The miner glanced about uneasily but only saw two girls sitting on their horses a short distance away. Hank's face lowered, however, and he growled forth: \"Ah don't see whose business it is whether we break the Sheriff's law or not.\"  \"Perhaps _you_ don't see--but Ah do, Hank. And when the Sheriff says, 'Keep the trail free from all trespassers till my possé can take charge,' you know me--Ah'll see that his orders are carried out,\" returned Mr. Brewster sternly, his pockets moving suspiciously.  \"You-all hain't got no orders, and thar hain't no possé up yander, neither, 'cause they hain't a-comin' till after Simms leaves,\" exclaimed Hank, unguardedly.  \"Ah! So you and your man thought you'd get a lead on the Sheriff, eh?\" laughed Mr. Brewster. \"Oh, but you are an easy tenderfoot to stuff, Hank! Did you-all really believe such a story would have been told at Oak Creek if the possé planned to wait for morning? Why, man, that is just what they wanted to do--to catch a lot of rascals red-handed and clean Oak Creek out, once for all! How do you know that there is a real claim staked out up there--or whether it is the Sheriff's joke to land a ring of crooks?\"  Eleanor and Barbara were so interested in the way Mr. Brewster handled the two rascals without telling a direct falsehood that they sighed when the claim-jumpers backed their horses and withdrew to confer anxiously on what they had heard. But Sam Brewster interpolated with:  \"If it is curiosity that brought you-all to lose a night's rest, pass right along and tell the Sheriff and Bill your yarn. They will not only let you take a squint at what you think is a mine, but they will pay you to remain and help arrest all the claim-jumpers who are already on the way.\"  Even as he spoke, Mr. Brewster saw the sly move of Hank as he tried to pull his gun from the holster; instantly a hand came from the rancher's pocket and brought to light a cocked revolver. The other man suddenly changed his mind when the bore of Brewster's gun was leveled so that the clerk could look right down into his grave if he made the slightest mistake in this outing of his.  But the miner became ugly; then he saw the other hand of Sam Brewster come from his pocket and he knew that he was a dead rascal too, if he made one false step. So his expression changed to a wily smile, and he said:  \"What you-all ha'r fur ef th' Sheriff's up thar guardin' th' precious mine?\"  \"Told to warn away any foolish town-clerks who might be heading straight to Kingdom Come! You know Bill likes to give every chump a loop-hole to save himself, if possible,\" retorted Mr. Brewster.  \"We ain't"]]]
