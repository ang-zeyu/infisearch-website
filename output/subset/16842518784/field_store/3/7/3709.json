Nonetheless, there was the possibility that the craving for fresh meat might change his mind for him. Besides, although hostile animals had long been gone from this part of the world--the only animals would be birds and squirrels and, farther up the Hudson, rabbits and chipmunks and deer ... perhaps an occasional bear in the mountains--who knew what harmless life form might become a threat now that its development would be left unchecked?  A cat sitting atop one of the stately stone lions outside the library met his eye with such a steady gaze of understanding, though not of sympathy, that he found himself needing to repeat the by-now almost magic phrase to himself: \"Not in my lifetime anyway.\" Would some intelligent life form develop to supplant man? Or would the planet revert to a primeval state of mindless innocence? He would never know and he didn't really care ... no point in speculating over unanswerable questions.  He settled back luxuriously on the worn cushions of his car. Even so little as twenty years before, it would have been impossible for him--for anyone--to stop his vehicle in the middle of Forty-second Street and Fifth Avenue purely to meditate. But it was his domain now. He could go in the wrong direction on one-way streets, stop wherever he pleased, drive as fast or as slowly as he would (and could, of course). If he wanted to do anything as vulgar as spit in the street, he could (but they were his streets now, not to be sullied) ... cross the roads without waiting for the lights to change (it would be a long, long wait if he did) ... go to sleep when he wanted, eat as many meals as he wanted whenever he chose.... He could go naked in hot weather and there'd be no one to raise an eyebrow, deface public buildings (except that they were private buildings now, his buildings), idle without the guilty feeling that there was always something better he could and should be doing ... even if there were not. There would be no more guilty feelings; without people and their knowledge there was no more guilt.  A flash of movement in the bushes behind the library caught his eye. Surely that couldn't be a fawn in Bryant Park? So soon?... He'd thought it would be another ten years at least before the wild animals came sniffing timidly along the Hudson, venturing a little further each time they saw no sign of their age-old enemy.  But probably the deer was only his imagination. He would investigate further after he had moved into the library.  Perhaps a higher building than the library.... But then he would have to climb too many flights of stairs. The elevators wouldn't be working ... silly of him to forget that. There were a lot of steps outside the library too--it would be a chore to get his bicycles up those steps.  Then he smiled to himself. Robinson Crusoe would have been glad to have had bicycles and steps and such relatively harmless animals as bears to worry about. No, Robinson Crusoe never had it so good as he, Johnson, would have, and what more could he want?  For, whoever before in history had had his dreams--and what was wrong with dreams, after all?--so completely gratified? What child, envisioning a desert island all his own could imagine that his island would be the whole world? Together Johnson and the Earth would grow young again.  No, the stars were for others. Johnson was not the first man in history who had wanted the Earth, but he had been the first man--and probably the last--who had actually been given it. And he was well content with his bargain.  There was plenty of room for the bears too.     Transcriber's Note:      This etext was produced from _Fantastic Universe_ August 1957.

Wisps of smoke were licking around the trees. A tongue of flame lapped at one while she watched. Branches writhed. The trees were too slow-moving to escape ...  But where was Ted? What had she exposed him to, with her hysterical orders? She held her breath till he moved within sight, standing quietly by a pile of salvaged tools. Behind him the cabin began to smoke.  Ted wasn't afraid, then. He understood what he faced. And Richard wasn't afraid, either, because he didn't understand.  But she? Surreptitiously Naomi pinched her hip till it felt black and blue. That was for being such a fool. She must _not_ be afraid!  \"Daddy seems to be staying there,\" she said. \"Let's wait for him at home, Richard.\"  \"Are you going to make Daddy burn _our_ tree?\"  She jumped as if stung. Then, consciously womanlike, she sought relief in talk.  \"What do _you_ think we should do, dear?\"  \"Oh, I _like_ the tree, Mommie. It's cool under there. And the tree plays with me.\"  \"How, Richard?\"  \"If I'm pilot, he's navigator. Or ship, maybe. But he's so dumb, Mommie! I always have to tell him everything. Doesn't know what a fairy is, or Goldilocks, or anything!\"  He clutched his book affectionately, rubbing his face on it. \"Hurry up, Mommie. It'll be bedtime before you ever read to me!\"  She touched his head briefly. \"You can look at the book while I fix your supper.\"         *       *       *       *       *  But to explain Cappy's pictures--crudely crayoned cartoons, really--she had to fill in the story they illustrated. She told it while Richard ate: how the intrepid Spaceman gallantly used his ray gun against the villainous Martians to aid the green-haired Princess. Richard spooned up the thrills with his mush, gazing fascinated at Cappy's colorful and fantastic pictures, propped before him on the table. Had Ted been home, the scene might almost have been blissful.  It might have been ... if their own tree hadn't reminded her of Cappy's. Still, she'd almost managed to stuff her fear back into that mental pigeon-hole before their own tree. It was unbelievable, but she'd been glancing out the window every few minutes, so she saw it start. Their own tree began to walk.  Down the hill it came--right there!--framed in the window behind Richard's head, moving slowly but inexorably on a root system that writhed along the surface. Like some ancient sculpture of Serpents Supporting the Tree of Life. Except that it brought death ...  \"Are you sick, Mommie?\"  No, not sick. Just something the matter with her throat, preventing a quick answer, leaving no way to keep Richard from turning to look out the window.  \"I think our tree is coming to play with me, Mommie.\"  No, no! Not Richard!  \"Remember how you used to say that about Cappy? When he was really coming to see your daddy?\"  \"But Daddy isn't home!\"  \"He'll get here, dear. Now eat your supper.\"  A lot to ask of an excited little boy. And the tree _was_ his friend, it seemed. Cappy's tree had even followed the child's orders. Richard might intercede--  No! Expose him to such danger? How could she think of it?  \"Had enough to eat, dear? Wash your hands and face at the pump, and you can stay out and play till Daddy gets home. I--I want----I may have to see your friend, the tree, by myself ...\"  \"But you haven't finished my story!\"  \"I will when Daddy gets home. And if I'm not here, you tell Daddy to do it.\"  \"Where are you going, Mommie?\"  \"I might see Cappy, dear. Now go and wash, please!\"  \"Sure, Mommie. Don't cry.\"  Accept his kiss, even if it _is_ from a mouth rimmed with supper. And don't rub it off till he's gone out, you damned fool. You frightened fool. You shaking, sweating, terror-stricken fool.  Who's he going to kiss when you're not here?  The tree has stopped. Our little tree is having its supper. How nice. Sucking sustenance direct from soil with aid of sun and air in true plant fashion--but exhausting our mineral resources.  (How wise of Ted to make you go to those lectures! You wouldn't want to die in ignorance, would you?)  The lecture--come on, let's go back to the lecture! Let's free our soil from every tree or we'll not hold the joint in fee. No, not joint. A vulgarism, teacher would say. Methinks the times are out of joint. Aroint thee, tree!  Now a pinch. Pinch yourself hard in the same old place so it'll hurt real bad. Then straighten your face and go stick your head out the window. Your son is talking--your son, your sun.  Can your son be eclipsed by a tree? A matter of special spatial relationships, and the space is shrinking, friend. The tree is only a few hundred feet from the house. It has finished its little supper and is now running around. Like Richard. _With_ Richard! Congenial, what?  Smile, stupid. Your son speaks. Answer him.  \"What, dear?\"  \"I see Daddy! He just came over the hill. He's running! Can I go meet him, Mommie?\"  \"No, dear. It's too far.\"  Too far. Far too far.  \"Did you say something to me, Richard?\"  \"No. I was talking to the tree. I'm the Spaceman and he's the Martian. But he doesn't want to be the Martian!\"  Richard plays. Let us play. Let us play.  You're close enough to get into the game, surely. A hundred and fifty feet, maybe. Effective range, fifty feet. Rate of motion? Projected time-interval? Depends on which system you observe it from. Richard has a system.  \"He doesn't want to play, Mommie. He wants to see you!\"  \"You tell that tree your Mommie _never_ sees strangers when Daddy isn't home!\"  \"I'll _make_ him wait!\"  Stoutly your pot-bellied little protector prevents his protective mother from going to pot.  \"If he won't play, I'll use my ray gun on him!\"  Obviously, the tree won't play. Watch your son lift empty hands, arm himself with a weapon yet to be invented, and open fire on the advancing foe.  \"Aa-aa-aa!\"  So _that's_ how a ray gun sounds!  \"You're dead, tree! You're dead! Now you _can't_ play with me any more. You're dead!\"         *       *       *       *       *  Seeing it happen, then, watching the tree accept the little boy's fantasy as fact, Naomi wondered why she'd never thought of that herself.  So the tree was a treacherous medicine-man, was it? A true-believing witch-doctor? And who could be more susceptible to the poisoning of fear than a witch-doctor who has made fear work--and believes it's being used against him?  It was all over. She and the tree bit the dust together. But the tree was dead, and Naomi merely fainting, and Ted would soon be home ...                                                          --DAVE DRYFOOS     Transcriber's Note:      This etext was produced from _Galaxy Science Fiction_ October 1952.
