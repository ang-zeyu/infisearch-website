I wrote to this effect to       Mr. Holly, but a week afterwards received a letter from that       gentleman’s lawyers, returning my own, with the information that       their client and Mr. Leo Vincey had already left this country for       Thibet, and they did not at present know their address.        Well, that is all I have to say. Of the history itself the reader       must judge. I give it him, with the exception of a very few       alterations, made with the object of concealing the identity of       the actors from the general public, exactly as it came to me.       Personally I have made up my mind to refrain from comments. At       first I was inclined to believe that this history of a woman on       whom, clothed in the majesty of her almost endless years, the       shadow of Eternity itself lay like the dark wing of Night, was       some gigantic allegory of which I could not catch the meaning.       Then I thought that it might be a bold attempt to portray the       possible results of practical immortality, informing the       substance of a mortal who yet drew her strength from Earth, and       in whose human bosom passions yet rose and fell and beat as in       the undying world around her the winds and the tides rise and       fall and beat unceasingly. But as I went on I abandoned that idea       also. To me the story seems to bear the stamp of truth upon its       face. Its explanation I must leave to others, and with this       slight preface, which circumstances make necessary, I introduce       the world to Ayesha and the Caves of Kôr.—The Editor.        P.S.—There is on consideration one circumstance that, after a       reperusal of this history, struck me with so much force that I       cannot resist calling the attention of the reader to it. He will       observe that so far as we are made acquainted with him there       appears to be nothing in the character of Leo Vincey which in the       opinion of most people would have been likely to attract an       intellect so powerful as that of Ayesha. He is not even, at any       rate to my view, particularly interesting. Indeed, one might       imagine that Mr. Holly would under ordinary circumstances have       easily outstripped him in the favour of _She_. Can it be that       extremes meet, and that the very excess and splendour of her mind       led her by means of some strange physical reaction to worship at       the shrine of matter? Was that ancient Kallikrates nothing but a       splendid animal loved for his hereditary Greek beauty? Or is the       true explanation what I believe it to be—namely, that Ayesha,       seeing further than we can see, perceived the germ and       smouldering spark of greatness which lay hid within her lover’s       soul, and well knew that under the influence of her gift of life,       watered by her wisdom, and shone upon with the sunshine of her       presence, it would bloom like a flower and flash out like a star,       filling the world with light and fragrance?        Here also I am not able to answer, but must leave the reader to       form his own judgment on the facts before him, as detailed by Mr.       Holly in the following pages.     I. MY VISITOR         There are some events of which each circumstance and surrounding       detail seems to be graven on the memory in such fashion that we       cannot forget it, and so it is with the scene that I am about to       describe. It rises as clearly before my mind at this moment as       though it had happened but yesterday.        It was in this very month something over twenty years ago that I,       Ludwig Horace Holly, was sitting one night in my rooms at       Cambridge, grinding away at some mathematical work, I forget       what. I was to go up for my fellowship within a week, and was       expected by my tutor and my college generally to distinguish       myself. At last, wearied out, I flung my book down, and, going to       the mantelpiece, took down a pipe and filled it. There was a       candle burning on the mantelpiece, and a long, narrow glass at       the back of it; and as I was in the act of lighting the pipe I       caught sight of my own countenance in the glass, and paused to       reflect. The lighted match burnt away till it scorched my       fingers, forcing me to drop it; but still I stood and stared at       myself in the glass, and reflected.        “Well,” I said aloud, at last, “it is to be hoped that I shall be       able to do something with the inside of my head, for I shall       certainly never do anything by the help of the outside.”        This remark will doubtless strike anybody who reads it as being       slightly obscure, but I was in reality alluding to my physical       deficiencies. Most men of twenty-two are endowed at any rate with       some share of the comeliness of youth, but to me even this was       denied. Short, thick-set, and deep-chested almost to deformity,       with long sinewy arms, heavy features, deep-set grey eyes, a low       brow half overgrown with a mop of thick black hair, like a       deserted clearing on which the forest had once more begun to       encroach; such was my appearance nearly a quarter of a century       ago, and such, with some modification, it is to this day. Like       Cain, I was branded—branded by Nature with the stamp of abnormal       ugliness, as I was gifted by Nature with iron and abnormal       strength and considerable intellectual powers. So ugly was I that       the spruce young men of my College, though they were proud enough       of my feats of endurance and physical prowess, did not even care       to be seen walking with me. Was it wonderful that I was       misanthropic and sullen? Was it wonderful that I brooded and       worked alone, and had no friends—at least, only one? I was set       apart by Nature to live alone, and draw comfort from her breast,       and hers only. Women hated the sight of me. Only a week before I       had heard one call me a “monster” when she thought I was out of       hearing, and say that I had converted her to the monkey theory.       Once, indeed, a woman pretended to care for me, and I lavished       all the pent-up affection of my nature upon her. Then money that       was to have come to me went elsewhere, and she discarded me. I       pleaded with her as I have never pleaded with any living creature       before or since, for I was caught by her sweet face, and loved       her; and in the end by way of answer she took me to the glass,       and stood side by side with me, and looked into it.        “Now,” she said, “if I am Beauty, who are you?” That was when I       was only twenty.        And so I stood and stared, and felt a sort of grim satisfaction       in the sense of my own loneliness; for I had neither father, nor       mother, nor brother; and as I did so there came a knock at my       door.        I listened before I went to open it, for it was nearly twelve       o’clock at night, and I was in no mood to admit any stranger. I       had but one friend in the College, or, indeed, in the       world—perhaps it was he.        Just then the person outside the door coughed, and I hastened to       open it, for I knew the cough.        A tall man of about thirty, with the remains of great personal       beauty, came hurrying in, staggering beneath the weight of a       massive iron box which he carried by a handle with his right       hand. He placed the box upon the table, and then fell into an       awful fit of coughing. He coughed and coughed till his face       became quite purple, and at last he sank into a chair and began       to spit up blood. I poured out some whisky into a tumbler, and       gave it to him. He drank it, and seemed better; though his better       was very bad indeed.        “Why did you keep me standing there in the cold?” he asked       pettishly. “You know the draughts are death to me.”        “I did not know who it was,” I answered. “You are a late       visitor.”        “Yes; and I verily believe it is my last visit,” he answered,       with a ghastly attempt at a smile. “I am done for, Holly. I am       done for. I do not believe that I shall see to-morrow.”        “Nonsense!” I said. “Let me go for a doctor.”        He waved me back imperiously with his hand. “It is sober sense;       but I want no doctors. I have studied medicine and I know all       about it. No doctors can help me. My last hour has come! For a       year past I have only lived by a miracle. Now listen to me as you       have never listened to anybody before; for you will not have the       opportunity of getting me to repeat my words. We have been       friends for two years; now tell me how much do you know about       me?”        “I know that you are rich, and have had a fancy to come to       College long after the age that most men leave it. I know that       you have been married, and that your wife died; and that you have       been the best, indeed almost the only friend I ever had.”        “Did you know that I have a son?”        “No.”        “I have. He is five years old. He cost me his mother’s life, and       I have never been able to bear to look upon his face in       consequence. Holly, if you will accept the trust, I am going to       leave you that boy’s sole guardian.”        I sprang almost out of my chair. “_Me!_” I said.  “Yes, you. I have not studied you for two years for nothing. I have known for some time that I could not last, and since I realised the fact I have been searching for some one to whom I could confide the boy and this,” and he tapped the iron box. “You are the man, Holly; for, like a rugged tree, you are hard and sound at core. Listen; the boy will be the only representative of one of the most ancient families in the world, that is, so far as families can be traced. You "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3155"],["title","She (#2)"],["body","laugh at me when I say it, but one day it will be proved to you beyond a doubt, that my sixty-fifth or sixty-sixth lineal ancestor was an Egyptian priest of Isis, though he was himself of Grecian extraction, and was called Kallikrates.[1] His father was one of the Greek mercenaries raised by Hak-Hor, a Mendesian Pharaoh of the twenty-ninth dynasty, and his grandfather or great-grandfather, I believe, was that very Kallikrates mentioned by Herodotus.[2] In or about the year 339 before Christ, just at the time of the final fall of the Pharaohs, this Kallikrates (the priest) broke his vows of celibacy and fled from Egypt with a Princess of Royal blood who had fallen in love with him, and was finally wrecked upon the coast of Africa, somewhere, as I believe, in the neighbourhood of where Delagoa Bay now is, or rather to the north of it, he and his wife being saved, and all the remainder of their company destroyed in one way or another. Here they endured great hardships, but were at last entertained by the mighty Queen of a savage people, a white woman of peculiar loveliness, who, under circumstances which I cannot enter into, but which you will one day learn, if you live, from the contents of the box, finally murdered my ancestor Kallikrates. His wife, however, escaped, how, I know not, to Athens, bearing a child with her, whom she named Tisisthenes, or the Mighty Avenger. Five hundred years or more afterwards, the family migrated to Rome under circumstances of which no trace remains, and here, probably with the idea of preserving the idea of vengeance which we find set out in the name of Tisisthenes, they appear to have pretty regularly assumed the cognomen of Vindex, or Avenger. Here, too, they remained for another five centuries or more, till about 770 A.D., when Charlemagne invaded Lombardy, where they were then settled, whereon the head of the family seems to have attached himself to the great Emperor, and to have returned with him across the Alps, and finally to have settled in Brittany. Eight generations later his lineal representative crossed to England in the reign of Edward the Confessor, and in the time of William the Conqueror was advanced to great honour and power. From that time to the present day I can trace my descent without a break. Not that the Vinceys—for that was the final corruption of the name after its bearers took root in English soil—have been particularly distinguished—they never came much to the fore. Sometimes they were soldiers, sometimes merchants, but on the whole they have preserved a dead level of respectability, and a still deader level of mediocrity. From the time of Charles II. till the beginning of the present century they were merchants. About 1790 my grandfather made a considerable fortune out of brewing, and retired. In 1821 he died, and my father succeeded him, and dissipated most of the money. Ten years ago he died also, leaving me a net income of about two thousand a year. Then it was that I undertook an expedition in connection with _that_,” and he pointed to the iron chest, “which ended disastrously enough. On my way back I travelled in the South of Europe, and finally reached Athens. There I met my beloved wife, who might well also have been called the ‘Beautiful,’ like my old Greek ancestor. There I married her, and there, a year afterwards, when my boy was born, she died.”   [1] The Strong and Beautiful, or, more accurately, the Beautiful in  strength.   [2] The Kallikrates here referred to by my friend was a Spartan,  spoken of by Herodotus (Herod. ix. 72) as being remarkable for his  beauty. He fell at the glorious battle of Platæa (September 22, B.C.  479), when the Lacedæmonians and Athenians under Pausanias routed the  Persians, putting nearly 300,000 of them to the sword. The following  is a translation of the passage, “For Kallikrates died out of the  battle, he came to the army the most beautiful man of the Greeks of  that day—not only of the Lacedæmonians themselves, but of the other  Greeks also. He when Pausanias was sacrificing was wounded in the side  by an arrow; and then they fought, but on being carried off he  regretted his death, and said to Arimnestus, a Platæan, that he did  not grieve at dying for Greece, but at not having struck a blow, or,  although he desired so to do, performed any deed worthy of himself.”  This Kallikrates, who appears to have been as brave as he was  beautiful, is subsequently mentioned by Herodotus as having been  buried among the ἰρένες‚ (young commanders), apart from the other  Spartans and the Helots.—L. H. H.        He paused a while, his head sunk upon his hand, and then       continued—        “My marriage had diverted me from a project which I cannot enter       into now. I have no time, Holly—I have no time! One day, if you       accept my trust, you will learn all about it. After my wife’s       death I turned my mind to it again. But first it was necessary,       or, at least, I conceived that it was necessary, that I should       attain to a perfect knowledge of Eastern dialects, especially       Arabic. It was to facilitate my studies that I came here. Very       soon, however, my disease developed itself, and now there is an       end of me.” And as though to emphasise his words he burst into       another terrible fit of coughing.        I gave him some more whisky, and after resting he went on—        “I have never seen my boy, Leo, since he was a tiny baby. I never       could bear to see him, but they tell me that he is a quick and       handsome child. In this envelope,” and he produced a letter from       his pocket addressed to myself, “I have jotted down the course I       wish followed in the boy’s education. It is a somewhat peculiar       one. At any rate, I could not entrust it to a stranger. Once       more, will you undertake it?”        “I must first know what I am to undertake,” I answered.        “You are to undertake to have the boy, Leo, to live with you till       he is twenty-five years of age—not to send him to school,       remember. On his twenty-fifth birthday your guardianship will       end, and you will then, with the keys that I give you now” (and       he placed them on the table) “open the iron box, and let him see       and read the contents, and say whether or no he is willing to       undertake the quest. There is no obligation on him to do so. Now,       as regards terms. My present income is two thousand two hundred a       year. Half of that income I have secured to you by will for life,       contingently on your undertaking the guardianship—that is, one       thousand a year remuneration to yourself, for you will have to       give up your life to it, and one hundred a year to pay for the       board of the boy. The rest is to accumulate till Leo is       twenty-five, so that there may be a sum in hand should he wish to       undertake the quest of which I spoke.”        “And suppose I were to die?” I asked.        “Then the boy must become a ward of Chancery and take his chance.       Only be careful that the iron chest is passed on to him by your       will. Listen, Holly, don’t refuse me. Believe me, this is to your       advantage. You are not fit to mix with the world—it would only       embitter you. In a few weeks you will become a Fellow of your       College, and the income that you will derive from that combined       with what I have left you will enable you to live a life of       learned leisure, alternated with the sport of which you are so       fond, such as will exactly suit you.”        He paused and looked at me anxiously, but I still hesitated. The       charge seemed so very strange.        “For my sake, Holly. We have been good friends, and I have no       time to make other arrangements.”        “Very well,” I said, “I will do it, provided there is nothing in       this paper to make me change my mind,” and I touched the envelope       he had put upon the table by the keys.        “Thank you, Holly, thank you. There is nothing at all. Swear to       me by God that you will be a father to the boy, and follow my       directions to the letter.”        “I swear it,” I answered solemnly.        “Very well, remember that perhaps one day I shall ask for the       account of your oath, for though I am dead and forgotten, yet I       shall live. There is no such thing as death, Holly, only a       change, and, as you may perhaps learn in time to come, I believe       that even that change could under certain circumstances be       indefinitely postponed,” and again he broke into one of his       dreadful fits of coughing.        “There,” he said, “I must go, you have the chest, and my will       will be found among my papers, under the authority of which the       child will be handed over to you. You will be well paid, Holly,       and I know that you are honest, but if you betray my trust, by       Heaven, I will haunt you.”        I said nothing, being, indeed, too bewildered to speak.        He held up the candle, and looked at his own face in the glass.       It had been a beautiful face, but disease had wrecked it. “Food       for the worms,” he said. “Curious to think that in a few hours I       shall be stiff and cold—the journey done, the little game played       out. Ah me, Holly! life is not worth the trouble of life, except       when one is in love—at least, mine has not been; but the boy       Leo’s may be if he has the courage and the faith. Good-bye, my       friend!” and with a sudden access of tenderness he flung his arm       about me and kissed me on the forehead, and then turned to go.        “Look here, Vincey,” I said, “if you are as ill as you think, you       had better let me fetch a doctor.”        “No, no,” he said earnestly. “Promise me that you won’t. I am       going to die, and, like a poisoned rat, I wish to die alone.”        “I don’t believe that you are going to do anything of the sort,”       I answered. He"]]]
