The material of which the diaper is made should not be stiff or harsh, but very limp, soft and pliable; nor should it be thick and bungling. There are great objections to the use of oil-cloth, rubber or other impervious materials as they prevent the escape of perspiration, urine, fecal matter, etc. As soon as possible, say near the end of the first year, the child should be taught to use its little chair-commode, thus dispensing with the diaper at an early age. This is much better for the sexual organs, is more comfortable for the child and is more healthy; it also favors a more perfect development of the limbs and joints, the hip joints particularly.     CHAPTER III.  Childhood.   Childhood is that portion of life extending from infancy to adolescence, which in boys occurs at the age of fourteen to sixteen years; and in girls at the age of twelve to fourteen years. In very warm climates adolescence is reached some two or three years earlier.  Most fortunate the infant who has completed its term of life, thus far, in accordance with the strictest rules of Hygiene, or the laws of health.  \"In a state of health sexual impressions should never affect a child's mind or body. All its vital energy should be employed in constructing the growing frame, in storing up proper external impressions and in educating the brain to receive them.\" Unfortunately this state of health is not always attained. Impressions may be exhibited in these organs at a very early age either from inheritance, from improper handling or from some morbid condition of the child that could show itself in no other organ of the body and which, like morbid conditions in general, make their appearance somewhere in the mind or body.  SEXUAL PRECOCITY.--Many parents who are most particular in all other respects, as to the moral and physical training of their children, imagine there is no need to pay any special attention to the genital organs. This, however, is a grave mistake and needs our careful consideration. As is well known, some children evince a sexual precocity which may lead to very serious results. In these it often happens that the sexual instinct arises long before puberty; such children, if males, manifest an instinctive attraction towards the female sex which they show by constantly spying after their nurses, chambermaids, etc.; by seeking as much as possible to play with children of the opposite sex and improperly toying with them. [C]\"One case is so remarkable that an abstract of it may be instructive: M.Â D----, between five and six years of age, was one day in summer in the room of a dressmaker who lived in the family; this girl thinking that she might put herself at ease before such a child, threw herself on her bed, almost without clothing. The little D---- had followed all her motions and regarded her figure with a greedy eye. He approached her on the bed, as if to sleep, but soon became so bold in his behavior that the girl, after having laughed at him for some time was obliged to put him out of the room. This girl's simple imprudence produced such an impression on the child that forty years afterwards he had not forgotten a single circumstance connected with it.\"    [C] Lallemand and Wilson, page 140.  Parents are remarkably careless on this point. They allow children to play together for hours at a time without the surveillance of an older person, provided only they are removed from any danger. It is sufficient to merely draw attention to such a custom as every reflective mind can easily draw the inevitable consequences. Habits are indulged in and marks of familiarity shown which should not for an instant be tolerated.  CAUSES which commonly produce sexual impressions on young children are, allowing them to repose playfully on their belly, to slide down bannisters, to go too long without urinating, constipation or straining at stool, cutaneous affections, and worms. Also, thoughtless acts of elder people which are very frequently more closely observed than is commonly supposed. The sliding down bannisters produces a titillation which is agreeable to the sexual organs. Children of both sexes will constantly repeat this act until they learn to become inveterate masturbators, even at a very early age.  Among boys a disease called _priapism_ is often developed; this arises from undue handling of the parts, or from some morbid state of the child's health. The disorder consists of paroxysms, occurring more or less frequently, of violent erections of the penis; these sometimes become very painful and require the attention of a physician. At all events medical aid should be sought at once, because some functional derangement is at work which might, if not arrested and cured, give rise to masturbation. Owing to unknown causes such morbid conditions induce some little boys to pull frequently at the foreskin of the penis until their health is seriously impaired; they pine away, lose flesh, and still continue to worry at the foreskin, till death has been known to result. These cases require the most careful and skillful constitutional treatment, until they are cured.  Sometimes, in other cases, the foreskin becomes inflamed, offensive secretions may form about the end of the penis, etc. All such disorders should be submitted to a judicious physician at once, to avoid irritations which might result in a tendency to sexual excitement--a calamity truly deplorable to the young. The idea which some writers advance--that a long prepuce (or foreskin) often proves an exciting cause of troublesome sensations to the boy, is certainly erroneous. So, too, it is all wrong to state that particular care should be taken to wash under the prepuce. That this objection in regard to washing is true, is proved from the physical fact that in a large majority of boys the orifice of the foreskin is not sufficiently opened to permit of these washings. And the objection is still further proved by the fact that all these unnatural secretions, offensive odors, sensations, etc., which irritate and worry a boy together with all inflammations of these parts are soon relieved and permanently cured by the proper medicament. Needless laving, handling or rubbing the sexual parts should be avoided as strictly as possible. To show how little good such washings really do, even though persisted in, I will mention one out of many similar cases: \"In spite of repeated washings every day, a fetid smegma was deposited in considerable quantity on the glans, causing a tiresome burning and itching.\" All such cases are utterly intractable by any amount of bathing. But the suitable remedy administered internally cures the trouble permanently in a few weeks and at the same time improves the general tone and health of the individual. This is so because the proper remedy removes the morbific cause which produced that condition of the penis and all concomitant symptoms, at the same time. It must be remembered that the troubles referred to above come from within, and that they are but developments of internal morbific causes. In a similar manner, small pox, measles, chicken pox and all eruptive diseases come _out_ as products from morbific causes _within_. No sane person ever thinks of washing off these appearances with the hope of curing the case!  All our external parts were made just as they should be and they work in harmony so long as we are perfectly healthy inwardly. Every blemish upon the skin, even to a wart, has a corresponding morbid influence within, which can be removed by proper treatment. Let it be remembered then for all coming time that a little boy's penis is never to be meddled or trifled with, nor his foreskin, nor the parts about the generative organs. All unnatural conditions, appearances or sensations require prompt and proper medical aid. If erections of his little penis occur during sleep, or if he cannot urinate promptly on rising in the morning, because of an erection, let these conditions beget an anxiety for his welfare and at once seek a judicious physician, who will be able to prescribe a medicament to arrest all further development of sexual precocity--an affliction so baneful to the young.  A little later in life children are liable to ascarides or seat worms, called by some \"pin worms.\" No applications, purgatives, \"vermifuges,\" injections or other mechanical means should ever be employed to remove these, as they are of constitutional origin and should be so treated, until perfectly cured. Removing the worms by irritants or by mechanical means does not remove the _cause_ of their existence or reproduction in the body. The dyscrasia that gives rise to these worms, with the accompanying itching and tickling, is apt to cause a sexual excitement which may prove more disastrous than the original trouble itself. Therefore be sure that this affection is treated constitutionally; so long as the vital forces work in harmonious order, no abnormal appearances of any kind can come to light, because they do not exist.  From the age of nine to fourteen, boys generally acquire very curious notions about sexual affairs and are naturally, from what they hear, desirous of obtaining some idea of sexual congress, a knowledge of where babies come from, etc. This curiosity, of course, causes the mind to dwell much upon sexual subjects. I fully believe that good information will, by satisfying this curiosity, free the mind to a great extent from sexual thoughts. It is from such very thoughts that boys are led to play with their sexual organs in secret, and to handle them so as to excite pleasurable sensations; erections of the penis are thus produced and"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31674"],["title","Comments on the Taxonomic Status of Apodemus peninsulae, with Description of a (#1)"],["body","occurs in Szechuan and Yunnan. Its relatively dark color, large feet and large ears, _flavicollis_-like skull and large molar teeth immediately separate it from _peninsulae_ although the two possibly have been confused in the earlier literature. Until a complete revisionary study of the Asiatic members of the subgenus _Sylvaemus_ can be undertaken the presence of _peninsulae_ in southwestern China must remain in question.  The western limits of the geographic range of _Apodemus peninsulae_ are unknown. _Apodemus gurkha_ Thomas, 1924, from Nepal is said to have 2-2=8 mammae but the description is not otherwise suggestive of close relationship to _peninsulae_. Farther to the west, _Apodemus flavicollis rusiges_ Miller, 1913, from Kashmir seems to have been properly assigned as a subspecies of _flavicollis_ (cotypes and large series in USNM).  Wood mice almost certainly do not occur in the Gobi Desert. They are known as far west as the Altai Mountains to the north of the Gobi and at least as far west as Kansu (see below) to the south of it. Whether the geographic range of the species skirts the western edge of the arid regions of northern China is at present unknown; perhaps it does not. At any rate, mice available to me from the North Chinese provinces of Jehol, Shansi, Shensi and Kansu are notably different in certain external and cranial features from other known races of _Apodemus peninsulae_ and are here given subspecific recognition. All measurements are in millimeters. Capitalized color terms are from Ridgway (1912).   Apodemus peninsulae sowerbyi, new subspecies       _Type._--Adult female molting from winter to summer pelage, skin      and skull, U. S. National Museum no. 175523, from 30 miles west of      Kuei-hua-cheng, 7000 ft., northern Shansi, China; obtained on 23      May 1912 by Arthur de Carle Sowerby, original no. 456.       _Distribution._--Known presently from eastern Kansu eastward      through Shensi, Shansi and Hopeh to southern Jehol, probably also      in northeastern Szechuan, exact limits of range unknown.       _Diagnosis._--Size small for species (see measurements). Color:      Upper parts (fresh summer pelage) averaging near (15'_a_)      Ochraceous-Buff, suffused with blackish (especially mid-dorsally);      winter pelage much paler; underparts grayish-white, individual      hairs plumbeous at base, tipped with white; ears pale brownish;      feet whitish above, darker below; tail bicolor, pale brownish      above, whitish below. Skull: Small (see measurements); rostrum      somewhat shortened and conspicuously down-curved; zygomatic notches      relatively shallow; zygomatic plates narrow; braincase      proportionally more inflated than in other subspecies of the      species; auditory bullae moderately inflated; upper incisors      slender, their faces averaging bright yellowish-orange.       _Measurements._--External measurements of the holotype, followed by      those of an adult male and female from the type locality, are,      respectively: Length of head and body, 101, 102, 100; length of      tail, 93, ----, 102; length of hind foot (_su_), 21, 21.5, 23;      length of ear from notch, 14, 16, 15.5.

From _Apodemus peninsulae praetor_ of Manchuria (holotype and paratypes), _A. p. sowerbyi_ differs in most of the same ways in which it does from _peninsulae_ as well as in having more shallow zygomatic notches, narrower zygomatic plates and smaller, more slender, upper incisors. From _Apodemus peninsulae nigritalus_ of the Altai Mountains of Siberia (holotype and paratypes), _A. p. sowerbyi_ differs in: Smaller size, both external and cranial; paler dorsal coloration; less convex cranial outline in lateral view; smaller auditory bullae.  _Remarks._--_Apodemus peninsulae sowerbyi_ is named in honor of the late Arthur de Carle Sowerby whose collections of mammals from North China and Manchuria have added so much to our meager knowledge of that part of the world.  Four specimens from Hsin-lung-shan, 65 mi. NE Peking, here assigned to _sowerbyi_, are darker dorsally than mice from farther to the west and in this respect may show approach to _A. p. praetor_. In all other features, however, they closely resemble the new subspecies.  All of the specimens of _sowerbyi_ available to me are from altitudes of 3000 feet or higher. At lower elevations in North China, destruction of wooded habitats owing to intense land-use practices has probably restricted the distribution of _sowerbyi_ primarily to hilly and mountainous areas where brushy, scrub and forest habitats still prevail.       _Specimens examined._--Thirty-three, all from North China, as      follows: JEHOL: Hsin-lung-shan, 65 mi. NE Peking, 3000 ft., 4.      KANSU: 15 mi. S Lanchow, 7400 ft., 1. SHANSI: Chiao-cheng-shan, 90      mi. W Taiyuan, 7000-8000 ft., 4; 30 mi. W Kuei-hau-cheng, 7000 ft.,      5; Lung-wang-shan, 20 mi. E Taiyuan, 4000 ft., 10; 18 mi. W      Taiyuan, 5000 ft., 1; 50 mi. NW Taiyuan, 5500 ft., 4. SHENSI: 12      mi. S Yenan, 4000 ft., 4.  _Apodemus peninsulae_, then, is known or suspected to occur over much of southeastern Siberia, Manchuria, Korea and North China. The western limits of its geographic range are unknown. Over this vast area only four subspecies, one newly named, can be ascribed with certainty to _peninsulae_ whereas only two other kinds, _giliacus_ of Thomas from Sakhalin and _rufulus_ of Dukelsky from extreme southeastern Siberia are probably conspecific with it, the latter possibly a synonym of _praetor_. These considerations underscore the preliminary nature of the present paper. The mammalian fauna of northeastern Asia is scarcely better known today than was that of North America in 1885 when Dr. C. Hart Merriam organized what was later to become the U. S. Biological Survey.  It seems to me that the correct names of four kinds of wood mice discussed above are as follows:  _Apodemus peninsulae peninsulae_ (Thomas, 1907) _Apodemus peninsulae nigritalus_ Hollister, 1913 _Apodemus peninsulae praetor_ Miller, 1914 _Apodemus peninsulae sowerbyi_ Jones, 1956   LITERATURE CITED  ALLEN, G.
