Sabayon of Madeira or Malaga wine without lemon juice is made the same way. If rum is added in place of wine it is then called Rum Sabayon Sauce.  65. +Strawberry Chaudeau Sauce.+-- Put 1 cup strawberry juice or syrup in a saucepan; sweeten to taste; add ½ cup white wine and the yolks of 2 eggs; beat this over the fire with an egg beater till it foams and rises up; remove from the fire and mix it with the beaten whites of 2 eggs; serve with vanilla koch or souflée.  66. +Pineapple Chaudeau Sauce.+-- Put 1 cup pineapple juice or syrup in a saucepan; sweeten to taste; add ½ cup white wine and the yolks of 2 eggs; beat this over the fire with an egg beater till it foams and rises up; remove from the fire and mix it with the beaten whites of 2 eggs; serve with vanilla koch or souflée.  67. +Raspberry Chaudeau Sauce+ is made the same as Strawberry Chaudeau Sauce.  68. +Cocoanut Snow Sauce.+-- Beat the whites of 3 eggs to a stiff froth and boil 1 cup sugar with ½ cup water till it forms a thread between 2 fingers; then gradually pour it into the beaten whites, stirring constantly; next add 1 cup freshly grated cocoanut.  69. +Cocoanut Sauce (another way).+-- Stir 2 tablespoonfuls butter with 1 cup powdered sugar to a cream; add by degrees the yolks of 2 eggs; then beat the whites to a stiff froth; mix them with the sauce; add ¾ cup freshly grated cocoanut and serve with boiled pudding.  70. +Snow Sauce (with orange flavor).+-- Beat the whites of 2 eggs to a stiff froth; boil a small cup of sugar with ½ cup water till it forms a thread between two fingers; remove it from the fire; add the juice of 1 orange and gradually pour it while hot into the beaten whites, stirring constantly; add last a little grated rind of orange and serve.

SYRUPS.  73. +Plain or Sugar Syrup.+-- Dissolve 4 pounds white sugar, 1 quart cold water and the beaten white of 1 egg; stir until sugar is dissolved; simmer for 3 minutes; skim well, strain through a fine flannel bag and bottle in well corked bottles.  74. +Pineapple Syrup.+-- Pare and cut some large, ripe pineapples into small pieces; put them in a stone jar or large bowl; sprinkle a little sugar between and let the pineapples stand covered with a cloth in cellar for 36 hours, or until they have bubbles on top; then strain through a sieve or coarse bag, and if not clear enough strain again through a flannel bag; add to each pint of juice 1 pound of sugar; stir until the sugar is melted; then put it over the fire and simmer 3 minutes; skim and put the syrup in bottles; cork well and keep them in cool place. This syrup may be thinned with 2 parts plain syrup.  75. +Strawberry Syrup.+-- Choose none but fine, ripe berries if you wish your syrup to be good; mash the strawberries in a stone jar or bowl; cover with a thin white cloth and let them stand 24 hours at a temperature of 70° to 80° F.; then inclose in a flannel bag and press them; add to each pint of juice 1 pound sugar; stir until the sugar is dissolved; then put it over the fire, let it boil up, skim well, remove from fire and bottle while hot.  75a. +Raspberry Syrup+ is made the same as strawberry.  76. +Raspberry and Currant Syrup.+-- Take equal quantities of raspberries and currants; free the latter from stems; put the fruit together into a stone jar or bowl, mash it up, cover with a cloth and let stand for 24 hours; then inclose the fruit in a coarse bag, press out the juice and to each pint add 1 pound sugar; let it boil up and bottle.  77. +Raspberry Syrup (without fruit).+-- To make 8 gallons of syrup prepare a plain syrup of 18 pounds sugar with 5 gallons of water and put it in a clean mixing barrel; next dissolve 2 ounces tataric acid in 1 pint cold water and add it to the syrup; then pour 1 quart boiling water over 4 ounces powdered orrisroot; let it get cold; then filter; add it also to the syrup and stir up well. Color it with the following mixture: Take ½ pound mallow or malva flowers and soak them in ½ gallon water for 6 hours; then mash in a mortar 2 ounces cochineal and 2 ounces alum and pour over these 2 quarts boiling water, and when cold filter; next mix both colors together, add them to the syrup and stir for 15-20 minutes. This is an excellent recipe for imitation of raspberry syrup.  78. +Raspberry Syrup (without boiling).+-- Mash some ripe berries in a stone jar or bowl and set the paste for 3 days (covered with a linen cloth) in a cool cellar; then press out the juice through a coarse bag; let it stand for 6 hours; drain off the clear juice and leave the sediment; add to 1 pint juice 1 pound sugar, stir for 1 hour and bottle; cork bottles loosely and set them for 4 days in the sun; then filter through a fine flannel bag; re-bottle the syrup in small bottles, cork well and cover corks with beeswax. Syrup made in this way is excellent for sauces. Strawberry and Currant Syrup without boiling is made in the same manner.  79. +Blackberry Syrup.+-- Mash the blackberries in a stone jar, cover and let them stand for 48 hours; then strain them through a bag; add to each pint of juice 1 pound sugar; stir until dissolved; put it over the fire to boil 3 minutes; skim well; add to each quart of syrup ½ gill of French brandy and bottle. Or take nice, ripe berries, mash and strain them; add to each pint of juice 1 pound sugar, ½ teaspoonful ground cloves and the same of cinnamon and mace; boil 5 minutes; add to 1 gallon of syrup ½ pint brandy and bottle.  80. +Peach Syrup.+-- Pare and cut the peaches into small pieces; put them in a preserving kettle with a little water; crack some of the peach stones, "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2974"],["title","The Memoirs of Jacques Casanova de Seingalt, 1725-1798.

He was their pander, and made them rob their visitors instructing them to pass it off as a joke if the theft was discovered. They gave him the stolen articles, but he never said what he did with them. I could not help laughing at this involuntary confession, remembering what Goudar had said about Pocchini selling him jewels.  After this wretched meal I went away leaving the duty of escorting them back to Goudar. He came and saw me the next day, and informed me that the girls had been arrested and taken to prison just as they were entering their house.  \"I have just been to Pocchini's,\" said he, \"but the landlord tells me he has not been in since yesterday.\"  The worthy and conscientious Goudar added that he did not care if he never saw him again, as he owed the fellow ten guineas for a watch, which his daughters had probably stolen, and which was well worth double.  Four days later I saw him again, and he informed me that the rascal had left London with a servant-maid, whom he had engaged at a registry office where any number of servants are always ready to take service with the first comer. The keeper of the office answers for their fidelity.  \"The girl he has gone with is a pretty one, from what the man tells me, and they have taken ship from London. I am sorry he went away before I could pay him for the watch; I am dreading every moment to meet the individual from whom it was stolen.\"  I never heard what became of the girls, but Pocchini will re-appear on the scene in due course.  I led a tranquil and orderly life, which I should have been pleased to continue for the remainder of my days; but circumstances and my destiny ordered it otherwise, and against these it is not becoming in a Christian philosopher to complain. I went several times to see my daughter at her school, and I also frequented the British Museum, where I met Dr. Mati. One day I found an Anglican minister with him, and I asked the clergyman how many different sects there were in England.  \"Sir,\" he replied in very tolerable Italian, \"no one can give a positive answer to that question, for every week some sect dies and some new one is brought into being. All that is necessary is for a man of good faith, or some rogue desirous of money or notoriety, to stand in some frequented place and begin preaching. He explains some texts of the Bible in his own fashion, and if he pleases the gapers around him they invite him to expound next Sunday, often in a tavern. He keeps the appointment and explains his new doctrines in a spirited manner. Then people begin to talk of him; he disputes with ministers of other sects; he and his followers give themselves a name, and the thing is done. Thus, or almost thus, are all the numerous English sects produced.\"  About this time M. Steffano Guerra, a noble Venetian who was travelling with the leave of his Government, lost a case against an English painter who had executed a miniature painting of one of the prettiest ladies in London, Guerra having given a written promise to pay twenty-five guineas. When it was finished Guerra did not like it, and would not take it or pay the price. The Englishman, in accordance with the English custom, began by arresting his debtor; but Guerra was released on bail, and brought the matter before the courts, which condemned him to pay the twenty-five guineas. He appealed, lost again, and was in the end obliged to pay. Guerra contented that he had ordered a portrait, that a picture bearing no likeness to the lady in question was not a portrait, and that he had therefore a right to refuse payment. The painter replied that it was a portrait as it had been painted from life. The judgment was that the painter must live by his trade, and that as Guerra had given him painting to do he must therefore provide him with the wherewithal to live, seeing that the artist swore he had done his best to catch the likeness. Everybody thought this sentence just, and so did I; but I confess it also seemed rather hard, especially to Guerra, who with costs had to pay a hundred guineas for the miniature.  Malingan's daughter died just as her father received a public box on the ear from a nobleman who liked piquet, but did not like players who corrected the caprices of fortune. I gave the poor wretch the wherewithal to bury his daughter and to leave England. He died soon after at Liege, and his wife told me of the circumstance, saying that he had expired regretting his inability to pay his debts.  M. M---- F---- came to London as the representative of the canton of Berne, and I called, but was not received. I suspected that he had got wind of the liberties I had taken with pretty Sara, and did not want me to have an opportunity for renewing them. He was a somewhat eccentric man, so I did not take offence, and had almost forgotten all about it when chance led me to the Marylebone Theatre one evening. The spectators sat at little tables, and the charge for admittance was only a shilling, but everyone was expected to order something, were it only a pot of ale.  On going into the theatre I chanced to sit down beside a girl whom I did not notice at first, but soon after I came in she turned towards me, and I beheld a ravishing profile which somehow seemed familiar; but I attributed that to the idea of perfect beauty that was graven on my soul. The more I looked at her the surer I felt that I had never seen her before, though a smile of inexpressible slyness had begun to play about her lips. One of her gloves fell, and I hastened to restore it to her, whereupon she thanked me in a few well-chosen French sentences.  \"Madam is not English, then?\" said I, respectfully.  \"No, sir, I am a Swiss, and a friend of yours.\"  At this I looked round, and on my right hand sat Madame M---- F----, then her eldest daughter, then her husband. I got up, and after bowing to the lady, for whom I had a great esteem, I saluted her husband, who only replied by a slight movement of the head. I asked Madame M---- F---- what her husband had against me, and she said that Possano had written to him telling some dreadful stories about me.  There was not time for me to explain and justify myself, so I devoted all my energies to the task of winning the daughter's good graces. In three years she had grown into a perfect beauty: she knew it, and by her blushes as she spoke to me I knew she was thinking of what had passed between us in the presence of my housekeeper. I was anxious to find out whether she would acknowledge the fact, or deny it altogether. If she had done so I should have despised her. When I had seen her before, the blossom of her beauty was still in the bud, now it had opened out in all its splendour.  \"Charming Sara,\" I said, \"you have so enchanted me that I cannot help asking you a couple of questions, which if you value my peace of mind you will answer. Do you remember what happened at Berne?\"  \"Yes.\"  \"And do you repent of what you did?\"  \"No.\"  No man of any delicacy could ask the third question, which may be understood. I felt sure that Sara would make me happy-nay, that she was even longing for the moment, and gave reins to my passions, determined to convince her that I was deserving of her love. The waiter came to enquire if we had any orders, and I begged Madame M---- F---- to allow me to offer her some oysters. After the usual polite refusals she gave in, and I profited by her acceptance to order all the delicacies of the season, including a hare (a great delicacy in London), champagne, choice liqueurs, larks, ortolans, truffles, sweetmeats--everything, in fact, that money could buy, and I was not at all surprised when the bill proved to amount to ten guineas. But I was very much surprised when M. M---- F----, who had eaten like a Turk and drunk like a Swiss, said calmly that it was too dear.  I begged him politely not to trouble himself about the cost; and by way of proving that I did not share his opinion, I gave the waiter half-a-guinea; the worthy man looked as if he wished that such customers came more often. The Swiss, who had been pale and gloomy enough a short while before; was rubicund and affable. Sara glanced at me and squeezed my hand; I had conquered.  When the play was over, M---- F---- asked me if I would allow him to call on me. I embraced him in reply. His servant came in, and said that he could not find a coach; and I, feeling rather surprised that he had not brought his carriage, offered him the use of mine, telling my man to get me a sedan-chair.  \"I accept your kind offer,\" said he, \"on the condition that you allow me to occupy the chair.\"  I consented to this arrangement, and took the mother and the two daughters with me in the carriage.  On the way, Madame M---- F---- was very polite, gently blaming her husband for the rudeness of which I had to complain. I said that I would avenge myself by paying an assiduous court to him in the future; but she pierced me to the heart by saying that they were on the point of departing. \"We wanted to go on the day after next,\" she said, \"and to-morrow we shall have to leave our present rooms to their new occupants. A matter of business which my husband was not able to conclude will oblige us to stay for another week, and to-morrow we shall have the double task of moving and finding new apartments.\"  \"Then you have not yet got new rooms?\"  \"No, but my husband says he is certain to find some to-morrow morning.\"  \"Furnished, I suppose, for as you intend to leave you will be selling, your furniture.\"  \"Yes, and we shall have to pay the expenses of carriage to the buyer.\"  On hearing that M. M---- F---- was sure of finding lodgings, I was precluded from offering to accommodate them in my own house, as the lady might think that I only made the offer because I was sure it would not be accepted.  When we got to the door of their house we alighted, and the"]]]
