NE Mosca, Alamosa     Co., Colorado).       _Distribution._--Western and southern Colorado, southeastern Utah,     northeastern Arizona and northern New Mexico, east to the panhandles     of Texas and Oklahoma and to southwestern Kansas.      _External measurements._--Average and extremes of 10 adults (5     males, 5 females) from San Juan County, New Mexico, and adjacent     Montezuma County, Colorado, are: total length, 140.1 (126-150);     length of tail-vertebrae, 67.4 (56-71); length of hind foot, 17.3     (16-18); length of ear from notch, 15.1 (13-17); tail averaging 92.7     per cent of length of body. Corresponding measurements of 13 adults     (7 males, 6 females) from Bernalillo and Guadalupe counties, New     Mexico, are: 142.1 (129-156); 69.4 (60-75); 17.9 (17-19); 16.3     (15-18); tail averaging 95.4 per cent of length of body.     Corresponding measurements of 22 adults (17 males, 5 females) from     Meade County, southwestern Kansas, are: 147.1 (139-162); 71.3     (65-77); 17.6 (17-19); 13.8 (13-15); tail averaging 94.1 per cent of     length of body. For cranial measurements see Table 2.   _Remarks._--For comparisons with _Reithrodontomys megalotis dychei_, geographically adjacent to the northeast, see account of that subspecies.  When Howell (1935:143) named _Reithrodontomys megalotis caryi_ from the San Luis Valley of Colorado he compared it directly only with _R. m. megalotis_ from southern New Mexico and northern Chihuahua. Few adults were available to Howell from the San Luis Valley, accounting for the fact, we think, that the published measurements of _caryi_ average less than those given for _R. m. aztecus_ by Howell (_op. cit._:144) and herein. We have examined 16 of the 23 specimens from Medano Ranch and the single specimen from Del Norte that Howell listed. Unfortunately, none is fully adult. The specimens from Medano Ranch, collected in late October and early November, are mostly in fresh winter pelage or molting from subadult pelage, and closely resemble topotypes of _aztecus_ in comparable pelages. Comparison of skulls of the specimens from Medano Ranch with skulls of topotypes and other individuals of _aztecus_ of approximately equal age indicates that the Coloradan specimens may average slightly smaller and have somewhat shorter rostra. Externally, topotypes of _caryi_ have the relatively long tail of _aztecus_ and approach it in length of ear (measured on dry specimens). To us, they appear to be intergrades between _aztecus_ and _dychei_, but to bear closer resemblance to the former, and we tentatively regard _caryi_ as a synonym of _aztecus_. Benson (1935:140) noted that two adult topotypes of _caryi_ were \"similar to adult topotypes of _aztecus_.\" Specimens from southern Colorado east of the San Luis Valley, assigned to _aztecus_, are intergrades between it and _dychei_, as are two specimens from El Paso County, to the north, which resemble _aztecus_ in color but resemble _dychei_ in other characters and are tentatively assigned to the latter.  Specimens from southwestern Kansas and adjacent Oklahoma, herein referred to _aztecus_, also are intergrades with _dychei_. Individuals from Meade County, for example, are intermediate on the average between typical specimens of the two subspecies in color of upper parts (if anything, nearer _dychei_), resemble _dychei_ in length of ear, but resemble _aztecus_ in length of tail and rostral proportions (consequently also in length of skull). Although a case could be made for assignment of the specimens from Meade County (and elsewhere in southwestern Kansas) to _dychei_, they are, everything considered, nearer _aztecus_, to which subspecies they have been assigned consistently since first reported from the area by Hill and Hibbard (1943:24).  Of two specimens examined from 10 mi. S and 1 mi. W Gruver, Hansford Co., in the Panhandle of Texas, the one adult is clearly assignable to _aztecus_ as is the specimen from 9 mi. E Stinnett, Hutchinson Co., Texas, that was referred to _dychei_ by Blair (1954:249).  _Reithrodontomys megalotis aztecus_ has had a rather unstable taxonomic history. Allen, who originally named the subspecies (1893:79), regarded it two years later (1895:125) as a synonym of _R. m. megalotis_, the subspecies with geographic range to the south and west of that occupied by _aztecus_. Howell (1914:30) recognized _aztecus_ as valid, but he, too, questioned its distinctness from _megalotis_ in a later paper (1935:144). Hooper (1952:218), the most recent reviewer, supported the validity of _aztecus_ because specimens available to him averaged \"distinctly larger in skull length and size of brain case\" than specimens of _megalotis_. Our comparisons of typical specimens of _aztecus_ with specimens of _megalotis_ from southern New Mexico and southwestern Texas confirm Hooper's observations and indicate also that _aztecus_ has a longer rostrum and slightly longer ear.       _Specimens examined._--205, as follows:      COLORADO. _Alamosa County_: Medano Ranch, 15 mi.

Hist.,     7:120, May 21, 1895 (type locality, Lawrence, Douglas Co., Kansas).      _Reithrodontomys megalotis dychei_, A. H. Howell, N. Amer. Fauna,     36:30, June 5, 1914.      _Reithrodontomys dychei nebrascensis_ J. A. Allen, Bull. Amer. Mus.     Nat. Hist., 7:122, May 21, 1895 (type locality, Kennedy, Cherry Co.,     Nebraska).      _Distribution._--Southwestern Wisconsin, southern Minnesota,     northwestern Illinois, Iowa, Missouri and northwestern Arkansas,     west through Kansas (except southwestern part), Nebraska and the     Dakotas to the foothills of the Rocky Mountains from central     Colorado to southeastern Alberta.      _External measurements._--Average and extremes of 17 adults (11     males, 6 females) from Douglas County, Kansas, are: total length,     134.2 (115-151); length of tail-vertebrae, 64.2 (59-72); length of     hind foot, 16.7 (15-18); length of ear from notch, 13.4 (12-15);     tail averaging 91.7 per cent of length of body. Corresponding     measurements of 20 adults (14 males, 6 females) from Cherry County,     Nebraska, are: 135.3 (122-155); 62.9 (56-72); 17.5 (17-18); 13.0     (12-14); tail averaging 86.9 per cent of length of body. For cranial     measurements see Tables 1 and 2.   _Remarks._--From _Reithrodontomys megalotis aztecus_, geographically adjacent to the southwest, _R. m. dychei_ differs as follows: upper parts averaging darker (especially in summer pelage), owing principally to more suffusion of blackish middorsally; tail slightly shorter; ears markedly shorter, rostrum shorter and relatively broader; occipitonasal length shorter owing to shorter rostrum.  \"_Reithrodontomys dychei nebrascensis_,\" named by Allen (1895:122) from Kennedy, Nebraska, was distinguished in the original description from _dychei_ by \"slightly larger size, relatively longer ears, and more strongly fulvous coloration.\" Allen applied the name _nebrascensis_ to harvest mice from Montana south to central Colorado and western Nebraska. Howell (1914:30-31) placed _nebrascensis_ in synonymy under _dychei_ because he found specimens from Kennedy to be \"indistinguishable from specimens of typical _dychei_ in comparable pelage.\" We concur with Howell. Topotypes of _nebrascensis_ that we have examined average only slightly paler than topotypes of _dychei_ in the same pelage (some specimens from each series can be matched almost exactly), and do not differ significantly in any external or cranial measurements. The \"fulvous\" upper parts of the series from Kennedy (all taken in late April) that was available to Allen resulted from worn winter pelage. We think that Allen was led astray also by his erroneous assumption that geographic variation in color of _R. megalotis_ on the Great Plains paralleled that found in _Peromyscus maniculatus_. Actually, _R. megalotis_ varies in color much less geographically in the region concerned than does _P. maniculatus_.

They had relaxed, having found control of the situation, and they were cutting her to pieces.  \"Tell me,\" his sister was saying, her eyes dancing slyly, \"don't you people have some very strange tricks you can do?\"  George tightened his fingers against his palms. He heard Gistla answer, \"Tricks?\"  \"Yes.\" His sister's white smile shined. \"You know, like making things disappear, things like that.\"  \"My father,\" Gistla said seriously, \"can do very wonderful things. He is a musician.\"  George's father leaned forward, blinking amusedly. \"Really? What does he play?\"  \"Play?\" asked Gistla.  \"Yes. He's a musician. He must play something, some kind of instrument.\"  Gistla looked at George, but George did not know what to say. He wished he had never tried to do this. He wished he had just ignored his family and gone on loving Gistla in the privacy of his own emotions.  \"Well, now,\" Mr. Kenington was saying rather impatiently. \"Does he play something like our violin or clarinet or oboe, or what?\" His father, George had noticed, was becoming impatient more frequently since he had become Secretary. The Secretarial post was very important.  \"He does not play anything,\" Gistla said carefully. \"He just ... makes the music and I hear it.\"  \"But how?\" Mr. Kenington insisted. \"What does he play the music _on_? He certainly can't make the music without using something to make it on.\"  Gistla glanced again at George and he said quickly, \"It's pretty hard to understand, Father. I don't think--\"  \"No, now don't interrupt just now, son. This is very interesting. We'd like to know what she's talking about.\"  Mrs. Kenington spoke for the first time. \"Are you just making this up?\"  It was like a whip coming through the air. His mother sat there, blinking, the suspicion and distrust she felt for this creature showing in her eyes and upon her mouth and even in the way she was sitting.  \"Now, Lois,\" Mr. Kenington said, as though he really sympathized with what she had said, believing that not only Gistla was making it up, but that all of her race made everything up. But he was stubborn. \"Come now, tell us. Tell us what you mean.\"  Gistla's smooth head turned this way and that. \"Sometimes,\" she said slowly, \"my father journeys to other places, and if he cannot return soon, he sends me music. When the light has gone from the day and I am alone, I hear it.\"  \"You mean he sends it by wires or by radio?\" Mr. Kenington asked with surprise.  \"No.\"  \"Now, wait a minute,\" George's sister leaned forward, smiling. \"You just hear this music, is that right? Up here.\" She tapped her forehead.  \"Yes,\" said Gistla.  \"My God,\" George's sister said. She looked at her parents, arching her eyebrows.  \"You shouldn't make things up,\" George's mother said.  \"Mother,\" George said, his face coloring. \"She's not making things up!\"  \"Just a moment, son,\" Mr. Kenington said crisply. \"You don't want to talk to your mother in that tone.\"  \"No, but, my God,\" George's sister went on. \"Imagine. No wires, no loudspeakers, just ... up here.\" She tapped her forehead again.  \"I'm not talking to my mother in any tone at all,\" George said, disregarding his sister.  \"Well, she shouldn't lie,\" said Mrs. Kenington with conviction.  George stood up. \"She is not lying, Mother.\"  \"I forbid you to argue with your mother that way, George,\" said Mr. Kenington.  \"I mean, my God,\" said George's sister happily. \"This is an innovation! Can you imagine? Gistla, or whatever your name is, could your father make his music sometime when we have a dance?\"  Gistla's eyes were hurt and she was, George knew, confused. She shook her head.  Mrs. Kenington was blinking accusingly. \"Do they teach you to make these things up? Is that what they teach you at home?\"  \"Mother, will you please?\" George said. \"Why must you talk to her that way?\"  Mr. Kenington stood up quickly. \"I did not raise my son to show an attitude like that to his mother.\"  \"But she isn't making this up,\" George said. \"You asked her to tell you and she--\"  George's sister had jumped out of her chair and she was waltzing over the patio. She began humming as she danced. \"Can't you just see it? Everyone dancing around, listening to music in their heads? No orchestra or records or anything?\"  Mr. Kenington stood very tall. \"Are you taking the word of your mother, or this ... this ...\" He motioned curtly at Gistla.  George licked his lips, looking defensively at each one of his family. \"It isn't a matter of taking anyone's word at all. It's just something we don't understand.\"  George's sister whirled and then suddenly she stopped, putting her hand against her mouth. \"My God, what if everyone got the music different? I mean, does everyone hear the same music, dear? Because if they didn't, what a mess!\" She began dancing again, her skirt swirling over the bricks of the patio.  Mr. Kenington's voice was louder. \"I think we understand, all right, George. There isn't anything about this we don't understand!\"  George's lips were paling.  His sister dipped and turned. \"We could call it a Music In The Head dance. Everybody brings his own head!\" She laughed merrily. \"My God!\"  George noticed then that Gistla was disappearing out of the rear gate. He stood, clenching his fists and glaring at his family. His sister had stopped dancing but she was still laughing.  \"I didn't think, George,\" his mother said resolutely, \"that you were going to invite someone who lied.\"  George turned and ran after Gistla.         *       *       *       *       *  They sat again in the clearing. George could still feel the anger churning inside him, and he held his hands together so tightly that his fingers began to ache. \"I hate them for that,\" he said.  Gistla touched his arm. \"No, George. It is all right. It is the way things are.\"  \"But they don't need to be! My family did that on purpose.\"  \"They just don't understand. My race is very different from yours and it seems strange.\"  \"So does mine,\" George said, standing and beginning to pace back and forth.  It had been what he really had expected. But still he had hoped, somehow, that his family might have understood. He looked at Gistla, sitting quietly, her large eyes watching him. He knew he loved her very much just then, more in fact than he ever had before, because she had been refused by his family.  \"Listen, Gistla,\" he said, kneeling on the grass in front of her. \"It won't make any difference what anyone thinks or does or says. I love you, and I'll go on loving you. We'll build our own life the way we want it.\"  She shook her head slowly. \"No, George. It does make a difference. You cannot forget your family or your people. That is important to you. I would only hurt you.\"  \"Do you love me?\"  \"Yes.\"  \"Then that's all that's important to me. Not what anyone thinks. Not what my sister thinks or my father or my mother.\"  \"We are different, you and I.\" She sat unmoving, her smooth face unchanging. \"My people seem strange to yours because we can do things your people do not understand. We seem strange because we look differently, we act differently, we value things differently.\"  \"My values are the same as yours,\" George pleaded. \"I love you because of what you are, not because of some kind of stupid chart for physical beauty, not because ...\"  \"George,\" she said. \"Look at me.\"  George met her eyes suddenly, caught by the urgency in her voice. And slowly, in front of his eyes, she changed. Her features shifted, until George saw a beautiful young girl with pink white skin and red lips. He saw shining blue eyes and shimmering golden hair that fell over her shoulders. Gistla's body had changed to a lithe, smooth figure that revealed its contours beneath the gray cape.  He caught his breath and wiped a hand at his eyes.  \"What you see,\" said Gistla softly, \"is an illusion. You see what would be in your values, a beautiful girl.\"  George opened his mouth but was unable to find his voice.  \"Do not be afraid, George. Beneath the illusion of your senses, I am still Gistla. I am still a Venusian.\"  George reached out and touched his fingers against a white arm and a white shoulder bared by the cape. He touched the golden hair. \"Gistla,\" he said, amazed. \"You're beautiful.\"  \"Yes,\" she said sadly.  \"But--you really are! Your hair and your eyes and your mouth. How did you do it?\"  She shook her head to show its unimportance. \"It is something--like your hypnotism.\"  George raised himself from his knees and sat beside her. \"But I can't believe it!\"  \"You can see, you can feel.\"  \"Yes,\" George said. \"Yes.\"  \"You are happy with me this way, aren't you, George?\"  \"But you're so beautiful.\"  The golden-haired girl nodded her head, and the shining blue eyes watched him carefully.  \"You see then,\" Gistla said. \"It does make a difference. You love me more this way.\"  \"No,\" George said, touching her hair again. \"I don't love you more, but if you can do this, why then, we'll have no more worries. Don't you see?\"  \"I think so,\" Gistla said, looking away.  George's voice was excited, and his eyes darted over her face and body. \"Would other people see you as I do?\"  \"If I wished, yes.\"  \"Then you see? It's all changed! You are what I see. Golden-haired and pale-skinned--\"  \"I am still Gistla. You would always know that. Would you love something that is not real, just because you see it with your eyes?\"         *       *       *       *       *  \"But I can feel that you're real,\" George said, putting his hands on her shoulders. He pulled her closer and kissed her hair. \"You're Gistla,\" he said, \"and you're beautiful.\" He tipped her face up to his and bent to kiss her mouth.  His lips touched smooth green skin and he looked into Gistla's large round lidless eyes. He recoiled as though he had been touched by fire.  She watched him as he wiped a trembling hand across his chest, and her globular head glistened in the reflection of the late sun.  She nodded. \"When you see what I really am,"]]]
