The subspecies _M. v. velifer_ has been reported previously from the adjacent states of Chihuahua, Durango, and Sonora.  A female (61149) obtained on June 8, 1954, carried a single embryo that measured 3 mm. in crown-rump length.  _=Lasiurus borealis teliotis=_ (H. Allen).--A female from 10 mi. NNW Los Mochis (61172), obtained on June 8, 1954, represents the first record of the species from Sinaloa, and is tentatively referred to this subspecies. It resembles cranially, but is paler than, Californian specimens seen of _teliotis_.  _=Molossus ater nigricans=_ Miller.--This large free-tailed bat previously has been reported no farther north in western México than the type locality, Acaponeta, Nayarit. Nineteen specimens from four different localities in Sinaloa are as follows: 1 mi. SE Camino Reál, 400 ft. (85093-99); 32 mi. SSE Culiacán (61279-87); 1 mi. S Pericos (61277-78); ½ mi. E Piaxtla (61288). The specimens labeled with reference to Camino Reál and Piaxtla were obtained along the Río Piaxtla at approximately the same place. Those from 1 mi. S Pericos extend the known range of the species approximately 225 miles northwestward.  _M. a. nigricans_ is characteristically an early flier. Along the Río Piaxtla, 1 mi. SE Camino Reál, where bats probably found daytime retreats in the rocky walls of the steep-sided valley of the river, individuals first appeared early in the evening when the sun was still on the western horizon, but were gone before other species of bats were seen. A female from 32 mi. SSE Culiacán, taken on June 18, 1954, contained one embryo that was 18 mm. in crown-rump length. Each of the color phases of the species, reddish (8) and black (11), are represented among our specimens. We follow Goodwin (1960) in the use of the specific name _ater_ for this bat.  _=Dasypus novemcinctus mexicanus=_ Peters.--Two armadillos (85402-03) from the valley of the Río del Fuerte, 3 mi. NE San Miguel, 300 ft., are the first of the species to be reported from northern Sinaloa. They extend the known range northwestward in the state approximately 285 miles from Escuinapa (Russell, 1953:25) and signal the possible occurrence of _D. n. mexicanus_ in southern Sonora. Sign of the armadillo was abundant at the place where our two specimens were collected. Because it was felt that the species possibly had been introduced along the Río del Fuerte, a number of local residents were questioned on the point, but all insisted that armadillos were native to the area.       External measurements of 85402 (female) and 85403 (male) are,      respectively, as follows: total length, 725, 748; length of tail,      351, 357; length of hind foot, 87, 89; length of ear from notch,      39, 39.  _=Sylvilagus audubonii goldmani=_ (Nelson).--This cottontail has been reported from Sinaloa only from Bacubirito, Culiacán (type locality), and Sinaloa (Nelson, 1909:226). Additional records are: 12 mi. N Culiacán (67561-62); 6 mi. N El Dorado (75263); 6 mi. N, 1½ mi. E El Dorado (75264-66); 7 mi. NE El Fuerte (81076-77); and 1 mi. S Pericos (61292-93). Specimens from the vicinity of El Dorado extend the known range some 30 miles southward from the type locality. A female from 1 mi. S Pericos that was taken on June 13, 1954, carried three embryos that measured 29 mm. in crown-rump length.  _=Sciurus truei=_ Nelson.--Three specimens (61300-02) of this species collected by A. A. Alcorn on June 19, 1954, 32 mi. SSE Culiacán extend the known range approximately 210 miles south-southeast from Guirocoba, Sonora (Burt, 1938:38), and provide the first record from Sinaloa. Two of the specimens are females and each was pregnant, one with two embryos and the other with three.  Our specimens generally agree in color with _S. truei_, but are larger than typical individuals and in this respect approach _S. sinaloensis_ of southern Sinaloa. Probably _truei_ and _sinaloensis_ both are only subspecies of the more southerly _S. colliaei_. The three nominal species currently constitute the _S. colliaei_ group in which the presence or absence of P3 seems to vary geographically. The tooth frequently is absent in the northern _truei_ and usually present (invariably in the specimens we have examined) in _colliaei_. Only one of our Sinaloan specimens is accompanied by a skull; in it P3 is present on the right side and absent on the left.       External measurements of the male and two females are,      respectively: total length, 512, 508, 504; length of tail, 263,      263, 252; length of hind foot, 64, 63, 64; length of ear from      notch, 28, 29, 28. Cranial measurements of 61300 (a female) are:      greatest length of skull, 56.2; zygomatic breadth, 32.6;      interorbital constriction, 17.9; postorbital constriction, 17.9;      length of nasals, 17.3; alveolar length of maxillary tooth-row (on      side lacking P3), 10.9.  _=Thomomys umbrinus atrovarius=_ J. A. Allen.--Two specimens (85104-05) from the valley of the Río Piaxtla, 1 mi. SE Camino Reál, 400 ft., resemble the description of _atrovarius_ and agree in size, color and most cranial details with a specimen (85744) from 5 mi. NW Mazatlán. The first-mentioned specimens extend the known range of the subspecies some 50 miles northward from Mazatlán (Bailey, 1915:96), and indicate the probable occurrence of the species at lower elevations in other parts of central Sinaloa.  _=Peromyscus merriami goldmani=_ Osgood.--This subspecies has been reported previously only from the type locality, Alamos, Sonora. Eight specimens were collected in Sinaloa by W. L. Cutter in the autumn of 1957 as follows: 6 mi. N, 1½ mi. E El Dorado (75368-72); 2½ mi. N El Fuerte (75365-66); El Fuerte (75367). The first-mentional locality is approximately 200 miles south-south-east of the type locality. All specimens collected by Cutter were taken in lowland areas, supporting remarks by Commissaris (1960) concerning habitat preferences of _P. merriami_ as compared with those of the closely related _P. eremicus_.  Two of three females from northeast of El Dorado were pregnant on November 18 and 19; one carried four embryos (8 mm. in crown-rump length) and the other three (11 mm.).       External and cranial measurements of _P. m. goldmani_ previously      were known only for the holotype (Osgood, 1909:252, 267).      Measurements of five adults, a male (75370) and four females      (75365, 75369, 75371-72) are, respectively, as follows: total      length, 204, 225, 215, 214, 210; length of tail, 105, 120, 110,      108, 109; length of hind foot, 21, 23, 23, 22, 22; length of ear      from notch, 21, 21, 21, 20, 21; weight in grams, 29, 19, 35      (pregnant), 33, 34 (pregnant); greatest length of skull, 26.6,      26.5, 26.9, 26.5,----; zygomatic breadth, 13.8, 13.9, 14.1,      13.4,----; interorbital constriction, 3.9, 3.8, 4.0, 4.0,----;      mastoid breadth, 11.8, 11.9, 11.8, 11.9, 11.5; length of nasals,      10.1, 9.4, 10.0, 10.0,----; length of maxillary tooth-row, 4.5,      4.3, 4.1, 4.1, 4.1.  _=Onychomys torridus yakiensis=_ Merriam.--Only one specimen of this grasshopper mouse has been reported previously from Sinaloa (from the town of Sinaloa by Hollister, 1914:471). Thirteen specimens in the Museum of Natural History better define the range of the species in the state as follows: 12 mi. N Culiacán (67981-82); 6 mi. N, 1½ mi. E El Dorado (75374-80); 2½ mi. N El Fuerte (75373); 1 mi. S Pericos (62118-20). The individuals from northeast of El Dorado extend the known range of the species some 115 miles south-southeast from Sinaloa.  A female taken on November 17, 1957, from 6 mi. N, 1½ mi. E El Dorado carried two embryos that measured 23 mm. in crown-rump length. A female obtained on November 18 at the same place carried four embryos that measured 10 mm.  _=Neotoma albigula melanura=_ Merriam.--Four specimens from northern Sinaloa, two (85379-80) from 3 mi. N, 1 mi. E San Miguel, 350 ft., and two (75386-87) from 2½ mi. N El Fuerte, provide the first records of the species from the state. _N. a. melanura_ has been known previously from adjacent parts of Sonora and Chihuahua (see Hall and Kelson, 1959:687-688). The specimens from northeast of San Miguel were trapped in runways under cholla cactus, in which nests also were found, on a slope above a rocky arroyo.  _=Spilogale pygmaea=_ Thomas.--Two pygmy spotted skunks from 5 mi. NW Mazatlán (85898-99) are the fifth and sixth of the species to be reported (see Van Gelder, 1959:381) and the second and third taken in Sinaloa (the holotype of _pygmaea_ was obtained at Rosario). One of our specimens, an adult male, was shot on the night of January 10, 1961, as it foraged near an old hollow tree in weedy-thorn bush habitat adjacent to the Pacific Ocean. The hollow tree contained the nest of a woodrat. The second, an adult female, was trapped nearby in a commercial rat trap baited with peanut butter and set near a burrow in a forested area having little undergrowth.       The two individuals here reported fit fairly well the description      of color pattern given for the species by Van Gelder (_op. cit._:      379), but are larger (considering sex), externally and cranially,      than any of the four specimens reported previously. Measurements of      the male and female are, respectively: total length, 291, 270;      length of tail, 65, 58; length of hind foot, 38, 35; length of ear      from notch, 25, 23; weight in grams, 247.0, 190.5; condylobasal      length, 46.0, 42.9; occipitonasal length, 45.0, 41.4; zygomatic      breadth, 29.0, 27.3; mastoid breadth, 23.9, 22.5; interorbital      constriction, 14.3, 13.6; postorbital constriction, 14.8, 14.1;      palatilar length, 15.6, 14.6; postpalatal length, 23.2, 22.4;      cranial depth, 16.6, 15.2; length of maxillary tooth-row, 14.2,      13.4. Cranial measurements were taken in the manner described by      Van Gelder (_op. cit._: 236-237).

In goods, of course; I don't suppose our money would be of much use to him. And I think he's rather glad of the chance to hang around and observe us conveniently.\"  \"Observe us!\" Greenfield exclaimed. \"You mean he's spying out the land for an attack? Let's prepare our defenses at once!\"  \"I doubt if that's what he has in mind,\" Professor Bernardi said judiciously.  \"He may be staying because he wants to be near me,\" Miss Anspacher blurted. Overcome by this unmaidenly admission, she reddened and rushed from them, calling, \"Yoo-hoo, Jrann-Pttt! Here is the frying pan!\" Algol woke up instantly and followed her. \"Frying\" was one of the more important words in his vocabulary.  Captain Greenfield stared across the clearing after them, then turned back to Bernardi with a frown. \"I don't like to see one of our girls mixed up with a lizard--and a foreign lizard at that.\" But his face too clearly betrayed a personal resentment.  \"Don't tell me you have a--a fondness for Miss Anspacher, Captain,\" Professor Bernardi exclaimed, genuinely surprised. Undeniably Miss Anspacher--although no longer in her first youth--was a handsome woman, but he would not have expected her somewhat cerebral type to appeal to the captain. On the other hand, she was the only unattached woman in the party and they were a long way from home.  Greenfield picked a fleck of dried violet mud from the side of the ship and avoided Bernardi's eye. \"One of the reasons I came along,\" he said almost bashfully. \"Thought I'd have the chance to be alone with her now and again and impress her with, with....\"  \"Your sterling qualities?\" Bernardi suggested.  The captain flashed him a glance of mingled gratitude and resentment. \"And now this damned lizard has to come along!\"  \"Cheer up, Captain,\" said the professor. \"I'll back you against a lizard any time.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Although the long twilight of Venus had deepened into night and it could never really be cool there by terrestrial standards, the temperature was almost comfortable. Everything was quite black, except for the pallid purple campfire glowing through the darkness; the clouds that perpetually covered the surface of the planet prevented even the light of the stars from reaching it.  \"Tell me more about the cross-versus the parallel-cousin relationships in your culture, Jrann-Pttt,\" Miss Anspacher breathed, wriggling her camp stool closer to the saurian's. \"Anthropology is a great hobby of mine, you know. How do your people feel about exogamy?\"  \"I'm afraid I'm rather exhausted, dear lady,\" he said, using one arm to mask a yawn, and one to surreptitiously wave away the saurian head that was peering out of the underbrush. \"I shouldn't like to give a scientist like yourself any misinformation that might become a matter of record.\"  \"Of course not,\" she murmured. \"You're so considerate.\"         *       *       *       *       *  A pale face appeared in the firelight like some weird creature of darkness. Terrestrial and extraterrestrial both started. \"Miss Anspacher,\" the captain growled, \"I'd like to lock up the ship, so if you wouldn't mind turning in--\"  Miss Anspacher pouted. \"You've interrupted such an interesting conversation. And I don't see why you have to lock up the ship. After all, the night is three hundred and eighty-five hours long. We don't sleep all that time and it would be a shame to be cooped up.\"  \"I'm going to try to rig up some floodlights,\" Greenfield explained stiffly, \"so we won't be caught like this again. Nobody bothered to tell me the day equals thirty-two of ours, so that half of it would be night.\"  \"Then I won't see you for almost two weeks of our time, Jrann-Pttt? Are you sure you wouldn't like to spend the rest of the night in our ship? Plenty of room, you know.\"  \"No, thank you, dear lady. The jungle is my natural habitat. I should feel stultified by walls and a ceiling. Don't worry--I shan't run away.\"  \"Oh, I'm not worried,\" Miss Anspacher said coyly, throwing a stick of wood on the fire.  \"Small riddance if he does.\"  \"Captain Greenfield!\"  That part of the captain's face not concealed by his piratical black beard turned red. \"Well, if he can read our minds, he knows damn well what I'm thinking, anyway, so why be hypocritical about it?\"  \"That's right--he is a telepath, isn't he?\" Miss Anspacher's face grew even redder than the captain's. \"I forgot he.... It _is_ getting late. I really must go. Good night, Jrann-Pttt.\"  \"Good night, dear lady.\" The saurian bowed low over her hand.  Leaning on the captain's brawny arm, Miss Anspacher ploughed through the mud to the ship, followed by the mosquito-bat and Algol, who had been toasting themselves more or less companionably at the fire. The door to the airlock clanged behind all four of them.         *       *       *       *       *  The other saurian's head appeared again from the bush. _Jrann-Pttt_, the insistent thought came, _shall I rescue you now_?  _Why, Dfar-Lll? I am not a prisoner. I'm quite free to come and go as I please. But let's get away from the strangers' ship while we communicate. They do have a certain amount of low-grade perception and might be able to sense the presence of another personality. At any rate, they might look out of a port and see you._  Keeping the illuminator on low beam, Dfar-Lll led the way through the bushes. _Seems to me you're going to an awful lot of trouble just to get zoo specimens_, the youngster protested, disentangling its arms from the embrace of an amorous vine. _There's really no reason for carrying on the work since Lieutenant Merglyt-Ruuu ... passed on._  Jrann-Pttt sat down on a fallen log and, tucking up his graceful tail, signaled his junior to join him. _In the event that we do decide to return to base, some handsome specimens might serve to offset the lieutenant's demise._  _Return to base? But I thought we were...._  _We haven't found swamp life pleasant, have we? After all, there's no real reason why we shouldn't go back. Is it our fault that Merglyt-Ruuu happened to meet with a fatal accident?_  _We-ell ... but will the commandant see it that way?_  _On the other hand, if we don't go back, wouldn't it be a good idea to attach ourselves to an expedition that, no matter how alien, is better equipped for survival than we? And carrying out our original purpose seemed the best way of getting to meet these strangers informally, as it were._  _They are unquestionably intelligent life-forms then?_  _After a fashion._ Jrann-Pttt yawned and rose. _But why are we sitting here? Let's start back to our camp. We will be able to converse more comfortably._  They made their way through the jungle--now walking, now wading where the mud became water. Small creatures with hardly any thoughts scurried before them as they went.  _The commandant may have already made contact with their rulers_, Dfar-Lll suggested, springing forward to illuminate the way. _In that case, we couldn't hope to remain undiscovered for long._  _Oh, these creatures are not Venusians. There's no intelligent life here. They hail from the third planet of this system and, according to their thoughts, this is the only vessel that was capable of traversing interplanetary space. So we needn't worry about extradition treaties or any other official annoyances._  _If they're friendly, why didn't you spend the night in their ship? It certainly looks more comfortable than our collapsible moslak--which, by the way, collapsed while you were gone. I hope we'll be able to put it up again ourselves. I must say this for the lieutenant--he was good at that sort of thing._  Jrann-Pttt made a gesture of distaste. _He was unfortunately good at other things, too. But let's not discuss him. I'm not staying with the strangers because I want to pick up one or two little things--mostly some of our food to serve them. I used up all the supplies in my pack and I want them to think we're living off the land. They believe me to be a primitive and it's best that they should until I decide just how I'm going to make most efficient use of them. Besides, I didn't want to leave you alone._  The younger saurian sniffed skeptically.         *       *       *       *       *  \"Honestly, Pitt,\" Mrs. Bernardi said, keeping to leeward of the tablecloth the lizard-man was efficiently shaking out of the airlock, \"I've never had a--an employee as competent as you.\" But the word she had in mind, of course, was \"servant.\" \"I do wish you'd come back to Earth with us.\"  \"Perhaps you would compel me to come?\" he suggested, as Algol and the mosquito-bat entered into hot competition to catch the crumbs before they sank into the purple ooze.  \"Oh, no! We'd want you to come as our guest--our friend.\" _Naturally_, her thoughts ran, _a house guest would be expected to help with the washing up and lend a hand with the cooking--and, of course, we wouldn't have to pay him. Though my husband, I suppose, would requisition him as a specimen._  _I fully intend to go to Earth with them_, Jrann-Pttt mused, _but certainly not in that capacity. Nor would I care to be a specimen. I must formulate some concrete plan._  The captain was crawling on top of the spaceship, scraping off the dried mud, brushing away the leaves and dust that marred its shining purity. The hot, humid haze that poured down from the yellow clouds made the metal surface a little hell. Yet it was hardly less warm on the other side of the clearing, where Miss Anspacher tried desperately to write up her notes on a table that kept sinking into the spongy ground, and hindered by the"]]]
