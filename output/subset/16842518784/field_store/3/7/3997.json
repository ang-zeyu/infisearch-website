Hedge had found his ftl drive and his counterprinciple, but no one before this has been able to put them to any use.\"  Reinhart walked over toward the great metal cylinder. Sherikov jumped down and followed him. \"I don't get it,\" Reinhart said. \"You said the principle is no good for space travel.\"  \"That's right.\"  \"What's this for, then? If the ship explodes as soon as it returns to our universe--\"  \"This is not a ship.\" Sherikov grinned slyly. \"Icarus is the first practical application of Hedge's principles. Icarus is a bomb.\"  \"So this is our weapon,\" Reinhart said. \"A bomb. An immense bomb.\"  \"A bomb, moving at a velocity greater than light. A bomb which will not exist in our universe. The Centaurans won't be able to detect or stop it. How could they? As soon as it passes the speed of light it will cease to exist--beyond all detection.\"  \"But--\"  \"Icarus will be launched outside the lab, on the surface. He will align himself with Proxima Centaurus, gaining speed rapidly. By the time he reaches his destination he will be traveling at ftl-100. Icarus will be brought back to this universe within Centaurus itself. The explosion should destroy the star and wash away most of its planets--including their central hub-planet, Armun. There is no way they can halt Icarus, once he has been launched. No defense is possible. Nothing can stop him. It is a real fact.\"  \"When will he be ready?\"  Sherikov's eyes flickered. \"Soon.\"  \"Exactly how soon?\"  The big Pole hesitated. \"As a matter of fact, there's only one thing holding us back.\"  Sherikov led Reinhart around to the other side of the lab. He pushed a lab guard out of the way.  \"See this?\" He tapped a round globe, open at one end, the size of a grapefruit. \"This is holding us up.\"  \"What is it?\"  \"The central control turret. This thing brings Icarus back to sub-ftl flight at the correct moment. It must be absolutely accurate. Icarus will be within the star only a matter of a microsecond. If the turret does not function exactly, Icarus will pass out the other side and shoot beyond the Centauran system.\"  \"How near completed is this turret?\"  Sherikov hedged uncertainly, spreading out his big hands. \"Who can say? It must be wired with infinitely minute equipment--microscope grapples and wires invisible to the naked eye.\"  \"Can you name any completion date?\"  Sherikov reached into his coat and brought out a manila folder. \"I've drawn up the data for the SRB machines, giving a date of completion. You can go ahead and feed it. I entered ten days as the maximum period. The machines can work from that.\"  Reinhart accepted the folder cautiously. \"You're sure about the date? I'm not convinced I can trust you, Sherikov.\"  Sherikov's features darkened. \"You'll have to take a chance, Commissioner. I don't trust you any more than you trust me. I know how much you'd like an excuse to get me out of here and one of your puppets in.\"  Reinhart studied the huge scientist thoughtfully. Sherikov was going to be a hard nut to crack. Designs was responsible to Security, not the Council. Sherikov was losing ground--but he was still a potential danger. Stubborn, individualistic, refusing to subordinate his welfare to the general good.  \"All right.\" Reinhart put the folder slowly away in his coat. \"I'll feed it. But you better be able to come through. There can't be any slip-ups. Too much hangs on the next few days.\"  \"If the odds change in our favor are you going to give the mobilization order?\"  \"Yes,\" Reinhart stated. \"I'll give the order the moment I see the odds change.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Standing in front of the machines, Reinhart waited nervously for the results. It was two o'clock in the afternoon. The day was warm, a pleasant May afternoon. Outside the building the daily life of the planet went on as usual.  As usual? Not exactly. The feeling was in the air, an expanding excitement growing every day. Terra had waited a long time. The attack on Proxima Centaurus had to come--and the sooner the better. The ancient Centauran Empire hemmed in Terra, bottled the human race up in its one system. A vast, suffocating net draped across the heavens, cutting Terra off from the bright diamonds beyond.... And it had to end.  The SRB machines whirred, the visible combination disappearing. For a time no ratio showed. Reinhart tensed, his body rigid. He waited.  The new ratio appeared.  Reinhart gasped. 7-6. Toward Terra!  Within five minutes the emergency mobilization alert had been flashed to all Government departments. The Council and President Duffe had been called to immediate session. Everything was happening fast.  But there was no doubt. 7-6. In Terra's favor. Reinhart hurried frantically to get his papers in order, in time for the Council session.  At histo-research the message plate was quickly pulled from the confidential slot and rushed across the central lab to the chief official.  \"Look at this!\" Fredman dropped the plate on his superior's desk. \"Look at it!\"  Harper picked up the plate, scanning it rapidly. \"Sounds like the real thing. I didn't think we'd live to see it.\"  Fredman left the room, hurrying down the hall. He entered the time bubble office. \"Where's the bubble?\" he demanded, looking around.  One of the technicians looked slowly up. \"Back about two hundred years. We're coming up with interesting data on the War of 1914. According to material the bubble has already brought up--\"  \"Cut it. We're through with routine work. Get the bubble back to the present. From now on all equipment has to be free for Military work.\"  \"But--the bubble is regulated automatically.\"  \"You can bring it back manually.\"  \"It's risky.\" The technician hedged. \"If the emergency requires it, I suppose we could take a chance and cut the automatic.\"  \"The emergency requires _everything_,\" Fredman said feelingly.  \"But the odds might change back,\" Margaret Duffe, President of the Council, said nervously. \"Any minute they can revert.\"  \"This is our chance!\" Reinhart snapped, his temper rising. \"What the hell's the matter with you? We've waited years for this.\"  The Council buzzed with excitement. Margaret Duffe hesitated uncertainly, her blue eyes clouded with worry. \"I realize the opportunity is here. At least, statistically. But the new odds have just appeared. How do we know they'll last? They stand on the basis of a single weapon.\"  \"You're wrong. You don't grasp the situation.\" Reinhart held himself in check with great effort. \"Sherikov's weapon tipped the ratio in our favor. But the odds have been moving in our direction for months. It was only a question of time. The new balance was inevitable, sooner or later. It's not just Sherikov. He's only one factor in this. It's all nine planets of the Sol System--not a single man.\"  One of the Councilmen stood up. \"The President must be aware the entire planet is eager to end this waiting. All our activities for the past eighty years have been directed toward--\"  Reinhart moved close to the slender President of the Council. \"If you don't approve the war, there probably will be mass rioting. Public reaction will be strong. Damn strong. And you know it.\"  Margaret Duffe shot him a cold glance. \"You sent out the emergency order to force my hand. You were fully aware of what you were doing. You knew once the order was out there'd be no stopping things.\"  A murmur rushed through the Council, gaining volume. \"We have to approve the war!... We're committed!... It's too late to turn back!\"  Shouts, angry voices, insistent waves of sound lapped around Margaret Duffe. \"I'm as much for the war as anybody,\" she said sharply. \"I'm only urging moderation. An inter-system war is a big thing. We're going to war because a machine says we have a statistical chance of winning.\"  \"There's no use starting the war unless we can win it,\" Reinhart said. \"The SRB machines tell us whether we can win.\"  \"They tell us our _chance_ of winning. They don't guarantee anything.\"  \"What more can we ask, beside a good chance of winning?\"  Margaret Duffe clamped her jaw together tightly. \"All right. I hear all the clamor. I won't stand in the way of Council approval. The vote can go ahead.\" Her cold, alert eyes appraised Reinhart. \"Especially since the emergency order has already been sent out to all Government departments.\"  \"Good.\" Reinhart stepped away with relief. \"Then it's settled. We can finally go ahead with full mobilization.\"  Mobilization proceeded rapidly. The next forty-eight hours were alive with activity.  Reinhart attended a policy-level Military briefing in the Council rooms, conducted by Fleet Commander Carleton.  \"You can see our strategy,\" Carleton said. He traced a diagram on the blackboard with a wave of his hand. \"Sherikov states it'll take eight more days to complete the ftl bomb. During that time the fleet we have near the Centauran system will take up positions. As the bomb goes off the fleet will begin operations against the remaining Centauran ships. Many will no doubt survive the blast, but with Armun gone we should be able to handle them.\"  Reinhart took Commander Carleton's place. \"I can report on the economic situation. Every factory on Terra is converted to arms production. With Armun out of the way we should be able to promote mass insurrection among the Centauran colonies. An inter-system Empire is hard to maintain, even with ships that approach light speed. Local war-lords should pop up all over the place. We want to have weapons available for them and ships starting _now_ to reach them in time. Eventually we hope to provide a unifying principle around which the colonies can all collect. Our interest is more economic than political. They can have any kind of government they want, as long as they act as supply areas for us. As our eight system planets act now.\"  Carleton resumed his report. \"Once the Centauran fleet has been scattered we can begin the crucial stage of the war. The"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32154"],["title","The Variable Man (#2)"],["body","of men and supplies from the ships we have waiting in all key areas throughout the Centauran system. In this stage--\"  Reinhart moved away. It was hard to believe only two days had passed since the mobilization order had been sent out. The whole system was alive, functioning with feverish activity. Countless problems were being solved--but much remained.  He entered the lift and ascended to the SRB room, curious to see if there had been any change in the machines' reading. He found it the same. So far so good. Did the Centaurans know about Icarus? No doubt; but there wasn't anything they could do about it. At least, not in eight days.  Kaplan came over to Reinhart, sorting a new batch of data that had come in. The lab organizer searched through his data. \"An amusing item came in. It might interest you.\" He handed a message plate to Reinhart.  It was from histo-research:                              May 9, 2136      This is to report that in bringing the research time bubble up     to the present the manual return was used for the first time.     Therefore a clean break was not made, and a quantity of     material from the past was brought forward. This material     included an individual from the early twentieth century who     escaped from the lab immediately. He has not yet been taken     into protective custody. Histo-research regrets this incident,     but attributes it to the emergency.                                                          E. Fredman  Reinhart handed the plate back to Kaplan. \"Interesting. A man from the past--hauled into the middle of the biggest war the universe has seen.\"  \"Strange things happen. I wonder what the machines will think.\"  \"Hard to say. Probably nothing.\" Reinhart left the room and hurried along the corridor to his own office.  As soon as he was inside he called Sherikov on the vidscreen, using the confidential line.  The Pole's heavy features appeared. \"Good day, Commissioner. How's the war effort?\"  \"Fine. How's the turret wiring proceeding?\"  A faint frown flickered across Sherikov's face. \"As a matter of fact, Commissioner--\"  \"What's the matter?\" Reinhart said sharply.  Sherikov floundered. \"You know how these things are. I've taken my crew off it and tried robot workers. They have greater dexterity, but they can't make decisions. This calls for more than mere dexterity. This calls for--\" He searched for the word. \"--for an _artist_.\"  Reinhart's face hardened. \"Listen, Sherikov. You have eight days left to complete the bomb. The data given to the SRB machines contained that information. The 7-6 ratio is based on that estimate. If you don't come through--\"  Sherikov twisted in embarrassment. \"Don't get excited, Commissioner. We'll complete it.\"  \"I hope so. Call me as soon as it's done.\" Reinhart snapped off the connection. If Sherikov let them down he'd have him taken out and shot. The whole war depended on the ftl bomb.  The vidscreen glowed again. Reinhart snapped it on. Kaplan's face formed on it. The lab organizer's face was pale and frozen. \"Commissioner, you better come up to the SRB office. Something's happened.\"  \"What is it?\"  \"I'll show you.\"  Alarmed, Reinhart hurried out of his office and down the corridor. He found Kaplan standing in front of the SRB machines. \"What's the story?\" Reinhart demanded. He glanced down at the reading. It was unchanged.  Kaplan held up a message plate nervously. \"A moment ago I fed this into the machines. After I saw the results I quickly removed it. It's that item I showed you. From histo-research. About the man from the past.\"  \"What happened when you fed it?\"  Kaplan swallowed unhappily. \"I'll show you. I'll do it again. Exactly as before.\" He fed the plate into a moving intake belt. \"Watch the visible figures,\" Kaplan muttered.  Reinhart watched, tense and rigid. For a moment nothing happened. 7-6 continued to show. Then--  The figures disappeared. The machines faltered. New figures showed briefly. 4-24 for Centaurus. Reinhart gasped, suddenly sick with apprehension. But the figures vanished. New figures appeared. 16-38 for Centaurus. Then 48-86. 79-15 in Terra's favor. Then nothing. The machines whirred, but nothing happened.  Nothing at all. No figures. Only a blank.  \"What's it mean?\" Reinhart muttered, dazed.  \"It's fantastic. We didn't think this could--\"  \"_What's happened?_\"  \"The machines aren't able to handle the item. No reading can come. It's data they can't integrate. They can't use it for prediction material, and it throws off all their other figures.\"  \"Why?\"  \"It's--it's a variable.\" Kaplan was shaking, white-lipped and pale. \"Something from which no inference can be made. The man from the past. The machines can't deal with him. The variable man!\"     II   Thomas Cole was sharpening a knife with his whetstone when the tornado hit.  The knife belonged to the lady in the big green house. Every time Cole came by with his Fixit cart the lady had something to be sharpened. Once in awhile she gave him a cup of coffee, hot black coffee from an old bent pot. He liked that fine; he enjoyed good coffee.  The day was drizzly and overcast. Business had been bad. An automobile had scared his two horses. On bad days less people were outside and he had to get down from the cart and go to ring doorbells.  But the man in the yellow house had given him a dollar for fixing his electric refrigerator. Nobody else had been able to fix it, not even the factory man. The dollar would go a long way. A dollar was a lot.  He knew it was a tornado even before it hit him. Everything was silent. He was bent over his whetstone, the reins between his knees, absorbed in his work.  He had done a good job on the knife; he was almost finished. He spat on the blade and was holding it up to see--and then the tornado came.  All at once it was there, completely around him. Nothing but grayness. He and the cart and horses seemed to be in a calm spot in the center of the tornado. They were moving in a great silence, gray mist everywhere.  And while he was wondering what to do, and how to get the lady's knife back to her, all at once there was a bump and the tornado tipped him over, sprawled out on the ground. The horses screamed in fear, struggling to pick themselves up. Cole got quickly to his feet.  _Where was he?_  The grayness was gone. White walls stuck up on all sides. A deep light gleamed down, not daylight but something like it. The team was pulling the cart on its side, dragging it along, tools and equipment falling out. Cole righted the cart, leaping up onto the seat.  And for the first time saw the people.  Men, with astonished white faces, in some sort of uniforms. Shouts, noise and confusion. And a feeling of danger!  Cole headed the team toward the door. Hoofs thundered steel against steel as they pounded through the doorway, scattering the astonished men in all directions. He was out in a wide hall. A building, like a hospital.  The hall divided. More men were coming, spilling from all sides.  Shouting and milling in excitement, like white ants. Something cut past him, a beam of dark violet. It seared off a corner of the cart, leaving the wood smoking.  Cole felt fear. He kicked at the terrified horses. They reached a big door, crashing wildly against it. The door gave--and they were outside, bright sunlight blinking down on them. For a sickening second the cart tilted, almost turning over. Then the horses gained speed, racing across an open field, toward a distant line of green, Cole holding tightly to the reins.  Behind him the little white-faced men had come out and were standing in a group, gesturing frantically. He could hear their faint shrill shouts.  But he had got away. He was safe. He slowed the horses down and began to breathe again.  The woods were artificial. Some kind of park. But the park was wild and overgrown. A dense jungle of twisted plants. Everything growing in confusion.  The park was empty. No one was there. By the position of the sun he could tell it was either early morning or late afternoon. The smell of the flowers and grass, the dampness of the leaves, indicated morning. It had been late afternoon when the tornado had picked him up. And the sky had been overcast and cloudy.  Cole considered. Clearly, he had been carried a long way. The hospital, the men with white faces, the odd lighting, the accented words he had caught--everything indicated he was no longer in Nebraska--maybe not even in the United States.  Some of his tools had fallen out and gotten lost along the way. Cole collected everything that remained, sorting them, running his fingers over each tool with affection. Some of the little chisels and wood gouges were gone. The bit box had opened, and most of the smaller bits had been lost. He gathered up those that remained and replaced them tenderly in the box. He took a key-hole saw down, and with an oil rag wiped it carefully and replaced it.  Above the cart the sun rose slowly in the sky. Cole peered up, his horny hand over his eyes. A big man, stoop-shouldered, his chin gray and stubbled. His clothes wrinkled and dirty. But his eyes were clear, a pale blue, and his hands were finely made.  He could not stay in the park. They had seen him ride that way; they would be looking for him.  Far above something shot rapidly across the sky. A tiny black dot moving with incredible haste. A second dot followed. The two dots were gone almost before he saw them. They were utterly silent.  Cole frowned, perturbed. The dots made him uneasy. He would have to keep moving--and looking for food. His stomach was already beginning to rumble and groan.  Work. There was plenty he could do: gardening, sharpening, grinding, repair work on machines and clocks, fixing all kinds of household things. Even painting and odd jobs and carpentry and chores.  He could do anything. Anything people wanted done. For a meal and pocket money.  Thomas Cole urged the team into life, moving forward. He sat hunched over in the"]]]
