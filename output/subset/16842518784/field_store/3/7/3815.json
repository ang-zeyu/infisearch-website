As the island is not in sight from the mainland, there is little chance that a band of savages, including women, would deliberately sail thither. There is equally little probability that they walked to the island on the ice, for the sea is never frozen across the whole width. Nevertheless the climate may at that time have been colder than now. There is also a chance that a party of savages may have been blown across to the island in a storm. Suppose that they succeeded in reaching Bering Island, as the most Asiatic of the Aleutians is called, the next step to Copper Island would be easy. Then, however, there comes a stretch of more than two hundred miles. The chances that a family would ever cross this waste of ocean are much smaller than in the first case. Still another possibility remains. Was there once a bridge of land from Asia to America in this region? There is no evidence of such a link between the two continents, for a few raised beaches indicate that during recent geological times the Aleutian Islands have been uplifted rather than depressed.  The passage from Asia to America at Bering Strait, on the other hand, is comparatively easy. The Strait itself is fifty-six miles wide, but in the middle there are two small islands so that the longest stretch of water is only about thirty-five miles. Moreover the Strait is usually full of ice, which frequently becomes a solid mass from shore to shore. Therefore it would be no strange thing if some primitive savages, in hunting for seals or polar bears, crossed the Strait, even though they had no boats. Today the people on both sides of the Strait belong to the American race. They still retain traditions of a time when their ancestors crossed this narrow strip of water. The Thilanottines have a legend that two giants once fought fiercely on the Arctic Ocean. One would have been defeated had not a man whom he had befriended cut the tendon of his adversary's leg. The wounded giant fell into Bering Strait and formed a bridge across which the reindeer entered America. Later came a strange woman bringing iron and copper. She repeated her visits until the natives insulted her, whereupon she went underground with her fire-made treasures and came back no more. Whatever may have been the circumstances that led the earliest families to cross from Asia to America, they little recked that they had found a new continent and that they were the first of the red race.  Unless the first Americans came to the new continent by way of the Kurile and Aleutian Islands, it was probably their misfortune to spend many generations in the cold regions of northeastern Asia and northwestern America. Even if they reached Alaska by the Aleutian route but came to the islands by way of the northern end of the Kamchatkan Peninsula, they must have dwelt in a place where the January temperature averages -10 degrees F. and where there are frosts every month in the year. If they came across Bering Strait, they encountered a still more severe climate. The winters there are scarcely worse than in northern Kamchatka, but the summers are as cold as the month of March in New York or Chicago.  Perhaps a prolonged sojourn in such a climate is one reason for the stolid character of the Indians. Of course we cannot speak with certainty, but we must, in our search for an explanation, consider the conditions of life in the far north. Food is scanty at all times, and starvation is a frequent visitor, especially in winter when game is hard to get. The long periods of cold and darkness are terribly enervating. The nervous white man goes crazy if he stays too long in Alaska. Every spring the first boats returning to civilization carry an unduly large proportion of men who have lost their minds because they have endured too many dark, cold winters. His companions say of such a man, \"The North has got him.\" Almost every Alaskan recognizes the danger. As one man said to a friend, \"It is time I got out of here.\"  \"Why?\" said the friend, \"you seem all right. What's the matter?\"  \"Well,\" said the other, \"you see I begin to like the smell of skunk cabbage, and, when a man gets that way, it's time he went somewhere else.\"  The skunk cabbage, by the way, grows in Alaska in great thickets ten feet high. The man was perfectly serious, for he meant that his mind was beginning to act in ways that were not normal. Nowhere is the strain of life in the far north better described than in the poems of Robert W. Service.  Oh, the awful hush that seemed to crush me down on every hand, As I blundered blind with a trail to find through that blank and bitter land; Half dazed, half crazed in the winter wild, with its grim heartbreaking woes, And the ruthless strife for a grip on life that only the sourdough knows! North by the compass, North I pressed; river and peak and plain Passed like a dream I slept to lose and waked to dream again. River and plain and mighty peak--and who could stand unawed? As their summits blazed, he could stand undazed at the foot of the throne of God. North, aye, North, through a land accurst, shunned by the scouring brutes, And all I heard was my own harsh word and the whine of the malamutes, Till at last I came to a cabin squat, built in the side of a hill, And I burst in the door, and there on the floor, frozen to death, lay Bill. *       * From \"Ballads of a Cheechako.\"   The human organism inherits so delicate an adjustment to climate that, in spite of man's boasted ability to live anywhere, the strain of the frozen North eliminates the more nervous and active types of mind. Only those can endure whose nerves lack sensitiveness and who are able to bear long privation and the strain of hunger and cold and darkness. Though the Indian may differ from the white man in many respects, such conditions are probably as bad for him as for any race. For this reason it is not improbable that long sojourns at way stations on the cold, Alaskan route from central Asia may have weeded out certain types of minds. Perhaps that is why the Indian, though brave, stoical, and hardy, does not possess the alert, nervous temperament which leads to invention and progress.  The ancestors of the red man unwittingly chose the easiest path to America and so entered the continent first, but this was their misfortune. They could not inherit the land because they chose a path whose unfavorable influence, exerted throughout centuries, left them unable to cope with later arrivals from other directions. The parts of America most favorable for the Indian are also best for the white man and Negro. There the alerter minds of the Europeans who migrated in the other direction have quickly eliminated the Indian. His long northern sojourn may be the reason why farther south in tropical lands he is even now at a disadvantage compared with the Negro or with the coolie from the East Indies. In Central America, for instance, it is generally recognized that Negroes stand the heat and moisture of the lowlands better than Indians. According to a competent authority: \"The American Indians cannot bear the heat of the tropics even as well as the European, not to speak of the African race. They perspire little, their skin becomes hot, and they are easily prostrated by exertion in an elevated temperature. They are peculiarly subject to diseases of hot climates, as hepatic disorders, showing none of the immunity of the African. Furthermore, the finest physical specimens of the race are found in the colder regions of the temperate zones, the Pampas and Patagonian Indians in the south, the Iroquois and Algonkins in the north; whereas, in the tropics they are generally undersized, short-lived, of inferior muscular force and with slight tolerance of disease.\" * \"No one,\" adds another observer, \"could live among the Indians of the Upper Amazon without being struck with their constitutional dislike to heat. The impression forced itself upon my mind that the Indian lives as a stranger or immigrant in these hot regions.\" * * Thus when compared with the other inhabitants of America, from every point of view the Indian seems to be at a disadvantage, much of which may be due to the path which he took from the Old World to the New.       * D. G. Brinton, \"The American Race,\" pp. 34, 35.       * * H. W. Bates, \"The Naturalist on the River Amazons.\" vol.II, pp. 200, 201.   Before the red man lost his American heritage, he must have enjoyed it for thousands upon thousands of years. Otherwise he never could have become so different from his nearest relative, the Mongol. The two are as truly distinct races as are the white man and the Malay. Nor could the Indians themselves have become so extraordinarily diverse except during the lapse of thousands of years. The Quichua of the cold highlands of Peru is as different from the Maya of Yucatan or the Huron of southern Canada as the Swede is from the Armenian or the Jew. The separation of one stock from another has gone so far that almost countless languages have been developed. In the United States alone the Indians have fifty-five \"families\" of languages and in the whole of America there are nearly two hundred such groups. These comprise over one thousand distinct languages which are mutually unintelligible and at least as different as Spanish and Italian. Such differences might arise in a day at the Tower of Babel, but in the processes of evolution they take thousands of years.  During those thousands of years the red man, in spite of his Arctic handicap, by no means showed himself wholly lacking in originality and inventive ability. In Yucatan two or three thousand years ago the Mayas were such good scientists and recorded their observations of the stars so accurately that they framed a calendar more exact than any except the one that we have used for the last two centuries. They showed still greater powers of mind in inventing the art of writing "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30667"],["title","The Tale of Old Dog Spot (#1)"],["body","know.\"  Well, that made Spot laugh. And he went out of the barn feeling even more pleased with himself than ever. He was sorry that Miss Kitty Cat wasn't in the yard. He felt just like bothering her.  \"I'll go up to the pasture and find me a woodchuck to chase,\" Spot said to himself, for he was in such high spirits that he simply had to have fun of some sort.  First, however, he decided to stop and dig up a bone that he had buried in the flower garden. So he trotted across the yard. And as he drew near the farmhouse he changed his plans all at once. He forgot his bone and he forgot his woodchuck, too. For he caught sight of something that had escaped his eye before. Stretched on the ledge outside one of the kitchen windows Miss Kitty Cat was enjoying a nap in the sunshine.  \"Aha!\" said Spot very softly. \"Aha! Here's a bit of luck.\" And he turned sharply aside and hurried towards the house, to come to a dead stop beneath the window and stand there motionless with his nose pointing at the sleeping form of Miss Kitty.  Though Spot didn't make the slightest noise the sleeper suddenly opened her eyes.  \"_Tchah!_\" she exclaimed, springing to her feet and glaring at her annoyer.  If the window hadn't been closed no doubt Miss Kitty would have slipped through it into the kitchen. But there was no escape that way.  \"It's a pity,\" she muttered, \"that a person can't take a cat nap without being stared at by this old dog. I think it's about time I took my neighbor's advice and taught him to keep his eyes and his nose where they belong.\"  Then Miss Kitty Cat jumped. She jumped off the window ledge straight at old dog Spot, who was still gazing up at her from below.  When he saw her coming he gave a startled yelp and tried to dodge her. But he was too slow. Miss Kitty Cat landed squarely on his back and clawed him savagely.  Old Spot dashed half way across the farmyard, then dropped suddenly and rolled over and over on the ground.  The next instant he was on his feet again and tearing toward the barn. Though Miss Kitty had dropped off his back and was already on her way to the house he did not look around to see what had become of her.  Spot bolted through the barn door and scurried into an empty stall, where he jumped into the manger and cowered down in the hay that half filled it, and moaned.  [Illustration: Spot Bolted Through the Barn Door.  (_Page 16_)]  It was the stall next to the old horse Ebenezer's. And that mild fellow peered over at him in wonder. \"What has happened?\" he inquired.  \"The cat scratched me,\" Spot told him. \"I was teasing her and she wasn't at all nice about it.\"  \"What were you doing--pointing at her?\" Ebenezer asked him.  \"Yes!\"  \"I suppose it made her wild,\" the old horse remarked. \"And a wild cat is a dangerous creature.\"  Spot whined fretfully. He wished he could lick his wounds. But how can one lick scratches when they are behind one's ears?  \"I was a wild dog for a few moments,\" he groaned. \"I never dreamed she would plump down on me like that.\"  \"Haven't you ever heard of it's raining cats and dogs?\" Ebenezer said. \"Well, to-day it rained cats.\"     IV  THE WOODPILE   Farmer Green always had a woodpile in the back yard. Sometimes it was big. Sometimes it was little. Sometimes it was mostly made up of four-foot logs. Sometimes the logs were all split and sawed, ready to burn.  When Farmer Green and the hired man had nothing more pressing to do they set to work on the woodpile. It was surprising how fast the big sticks grew into firewood under their axes and saws.  One day they started sawing and splitting when Johnnie Green and old dog Spot were roaming through the woods. And when Johnnie and Spot came back home, just in time for dinner, they found a great heap of firewood lying on the ground where there had been nothing but dirt when they started for the woods some hours before.  Old dog Spot ran straight to the woodpile and began sniffing and scratching and whining.  If Johnnie Green hadn't been hungry he would have paid more heed to Spot's behavior. But the men had already gone into the house. And Johnnie hurried after them, leaving Spot to nose about the woodpile as he pleased.  \"Humph!\" Spot growled. \"Seems to me Johnnie Green might stay here a while and help me. I've been chasing woodchucks and squirrels for him all the morning. And I showed him a few birds, too.\"  Spot never once left the woodpile while Johnnie was eating his dinner. When Johnnie and his father and the hired man came out of the house later old Spot began to yelp. He made frantic efforts to burrow down beneath the pile of firewood, stopping now and then to run up to his young master and bark.  Now that he had had his dinner, Johnnie Green was all ready for any sort of fun.  \"Spot smells some kind of game in the woodpile!\" Johnnie exclaimed.  \"Perhaps he does,\" said his father. \"But I don't see how he's going to get hold of it unless we move the woodpile. And I don't believe we'll quit work to help the old dog catch a chipmunk--or maybe a rat.\"  \"Come on!\" Spot begged Johnnie, as plainly as he could bark. \"Move some of this wood for me! There's something under it that I want to get my teeth on.\"  \"All right! All right!\" Johnnie told him. And to his father Johnnie said, \"Do you care if I throw some of the stove wood over on the other side of the pile?\"  \"If you're going to move any wood--\" Farmer Green replied with a wink at the hired man--\"if you're going to move any wood you might as well move it into the woodshed and pile it up neatly.\"  When he heard that suggestion Johnnie Green looked very glum. For a minute or two he thought he wouldn't bother to help old Spot find what he was looking for. But Spot teased and teased. And Johnnie couldn't help being curious to know what it was that Spot was after.  \"Maybe there's a muskrat here,\" he said to himself. \"If there is, I'll have his skin to pay me for my trouble.\"     V  A DEEP SECRET   Old Spot wouldn't let Johnnie Green alone. He kept jumping against him and whining, begging him to move some of the wood, because there was something very, very interesting beneath it.  Still Johnnie hesitated. He hadn't intended to do any work that afternoon.  \"After all,\" he thought, \"I'll have to help carry in this wood sooner or later. Really, I might as well take some of it into the woodshed now.\"  To Spot's delight he bent over and began gathering an armful of wood.  \"Wow! Wow!\" Spot howled. \"Thank goodness I'm going to get what's under this pile, after all.\"  Johnnie Green carried armful after armful of wood from the yard and piled it in the shed back of the kitchen. All the time old dog Spot was urging him with yelps and barks and whines and moans to move faster. And all the time Johnnie Green was working as spryly as he could.  Whatever it might be that Spot wanted to get under the woodpile in the yard, Johnnie hoped it wouldn't escape through the crevices between the sticks.  \"I don't want to get myself all tired out for nothing,\" Johnnie said to himself. \"I was going fishing this afternoon.\"  While Johnnie hurried back and forth between the woodpile and the shed Spot clawed away at the edge of the pile. He thrust his nose beneath loose sticks and pushed them about. He uttered pitiful sounds.  \"I never saw that dog take on so,\" Farmer Green remarked.  \"And I never saw Johnnie work so hard,\" said the hired man. \"When there's wood to be carried in he's usually a mile away.\"  Farmer Green laughed.  \"He'll quit as soon as Spot gets what he wants,\" he replied. \"It's too bad this sort of thing doesn't happen oftener. Except for driving the cows home, this is the first time I ever knew a boy and a dog to do much besides play, when they're together.\"  Turkey Proudfoot, the huge gobbler, came hurrying around the corner of the barn to see what was going on. He had an idea that he ruled the farmyard.  \"What's all this row about?\" he gobbled at old Spot. \"Have you lost something?\"  \"Yes!\" Spot told him. \"Johnnie Green's helping me to find it. We're moving part of the woodpile.\"  \"What did you lose?\" Turkey Proudfoot demanded.  Old Spot pretended not to hear him. He began barking again at Johnnie Green.  Mr. Catbird, who loved to play jokes on everybody, started mewing from his hiding place under the lilac bushes. He had noticed Spot's antics. And he hoped to fool him into thinking there was a strange cat around the place. For Spot was a famous chaser of all cats--so long as they kept running away from him and didn't turn around and try to scratch him.  To Mr. Catbird's astonishment old Spot paid no heed to his catcalls.  \"This is queer,\" Mr. Catbird muttered. \"Whenever I've mewed before he has always come a-running. There must be something uncommonly interesting under that woodpile.\"     VI  BURIED TREASURE   Henrietta Hen, who was one of the busiest busybodies on the farm, came along and stood and watched old dog Spot while he dug and scratched and howled about the woodpile.  \"What on earth is the matter with you?\" she asked him. \"I don't make half that fuss when I've just laid an egg and really have something to cackle about.\"  \"I've no time to talk with you now,\" Spot told Henrietta Hen. \"Can't you see that Johnnie Green and I are moving the woodpile?\"  \"Why are you doing that?\" Henrietta inquired.  \"There's something beneath it that I want,\" he said hurriedly.  Henrietta Hen gave a sudden start.  \"I wonder if it's a weasel!\" she exclaimed. And since he didn't reply, and she had learned to be mortally afraid of weasels, she ran off squawking, to hide high up in the haymow in the barn.  Johnnie Green hadn't carried away much more of the woodpile when old dog Spot began to dig furiously in the dirt. And in a few seconds' time he unearthed a big bone.  It was a choice bone. He had buried it several days before. And when he came back from the woods and found a woodpile on top of the place where he had hidden it, it was no wonder that he made such a howdy-do.  Johnnie Green looked much"]]]
