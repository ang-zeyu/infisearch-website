Now in these early years she was a silent and persistent child, growing up with a feeling that she was uncared for and neglected, and lavishing all her childish affection, as she did all that of her womanly life, on her brother WILLIAM. Throughout her long life, \"my brother\" was WILLIAM, \"my nephew\" _his_ son.  The brothers JACOB and WILLIAM were, with their father, members of the band of the Guards in 1755, when the regiment was ordered to England, and they were absent from Hanover a year.  WILLIAM (then seventeen years old) went as oboist, and out of his scanty pay brought back to Hanover, in 1756, only one memento of his stay--a copy of LOCKE _On the Human Understanding_.  He appears to have served with the Guard during part of the campaign of 1757. His health was then delicate, and his parents \"determined to remove him from the service--a step attended by no small difficulties.\"[3]  This \"removal\" was hurriedly and safely effected, so hurriedly that the copy of LOCKE was not put in the parcels sent after him to Hamburg by his mother; \"she, dear woman, knew no other wants than good linen and clothing.\"  Thus, at last, the young WILLIAM HERSCHEL, the son of an oboe-player in the King's Guard, is launched in life for himself, in the year 1757, at the age of nineteen.  All his equipment is the \"good linen and clothing,\" a knowledge of French, Latin, and English, some skill in playing the violin, the organ, and the oboe, and an \"uncommon precipitancy\" in doing what there is to be done.  A slender outfit truly; but we are not to overlook what he said of himself on another occasion. \"I have, nevertheless, several resources in view, and do not despair of succeeding pretty well in the end.\"  From 1757 to 1760--three years--we know nothing of his life. We can imagine what it was. His previous visit to England had given him a good knowledge of the language, and perhaps a few uninfluential acquaintances. On his return he would naturally seek these out, and, by means of his music, he could gain a livelihood. We first hear of him as charged with the organization of the music of a corps of the militia of Durham, under the auspices of the EARL OF DARLINGTON. \"La manière dont il remplit cette mission, le fit connaître avantageusement.\"[4] The nature of the service of these militia corps, which were then forming all over England, is well described in the Autobiography of GIBBON. Every county-gentleman felt constrained to serve his country, and the regimental mess-rooms were filled with men of rank and fashion.  In 1760 we hear of him again. He has attracted the notice of those about him.      \"About the year 1760, as MILLER[5] was dining at Pontefract with     the officers of the Durham militia, one of them, knowing his love of     music, told him they had a young German in their band as a performer     on the hautboy, who had only been a few months in England, and yet     spoke English almost as well as a native, and who was also an     excellent performer on the violin; the officer added that if MILLER     would come into another room, this German should entertain him with     a solo. The invitation was gladly accepted, and MILLER heard a solo     of GIARDINI'S executed in a manner that surprised him. He afterwards     took an opportunity of having some private conversation with the     young musician, and asked him whether he had engaged himself for any     long period to the Durham militia. The answer was, 'Only from month     to month.' 'Leave them, then,' said the organist, 'and come and live     with me. I am a single man, and think we shall be happy together;     and, doubtless, your merit will soon entitle you to a more eligible     situation.' The offer was accepted as frankly as it was made, and     the reader may imagine with what satisfaction Dr. MILLER     must have remembered this act of generous feeling when he hears     that this young German was HERSCHEL, the Astronomer. 'My humble     mansion,' says MILLER, 'consisted, at that time, but of two rooms.     However, poor as I was, my cottage contained a library of     well-chosen books; and it must appear singular that a foreigner who     had been so short a time in England should understand even the     peculiarities of the language so well as to fix upon SWIFT for his     favorite author.'      \"He took an early opportunity of introducing his new friend at     Mr. CROPLEY'S concerts; the first violin was resigned to him; 'and     never,' says the organist, 'had I heard the concertos of CORELLI,     GEMINIANI, and AVISON, or the overtures of HANDEL performed more     chastely, or more according to the original intention of the     composers, than by Mr. HERSCHEL. I soon lost my companion; his fame     was presently spread abroad; he had the offer of pupils, and was     solicited to lead the public concerts both at Wakefield and Halifax.     A new organ for the parish church of Halifax was built about this     time, and HERSCHEL was one of the seven candidates for the     organist's place. They drew lots how they were to perform in     succession. HERSCHEL drew the third, the second fell to Dr.     WAINWRIGHT of Manchester, whose finger was so rapid that old     SNETZLER, the organ-builder, ran about the church exclaiming:     '_Te tevel! te tevel! he run over te keys like one cat; he will     not give my piphes room for to shpeak._' 'During Mr. WAINWRIGHT'S     performance,' says MILLER, 'I was standing in the middle aisle with     HERSCHEL. 'What chance have you,' said I, 'to follow this man?' He     replied, 'I don't know; I am sure fingers will not do.' On which he     ascended the organ loft, and produced from the organ so uncommon a     fulness, such a volume of slow, solemn harmony, that I could by no     means account for the effect. After this short _ex tempore_     effusion, he finished with the Old Hundredth psalm-tune, which he     played better than his opponent.      \"'_Ay, ay_,' cried old SNETZLER, '_tish is very goot, very goot     indeet; I vil luf tish man, for he gives my piphes room for to     shpeak._' Having afterwards asked Mr. HERSCHEL by what means, in the     beginning of his performance, he produced so uncommon an effect, he     replied, 'I told you fingers would not do!' and producing two pieces     of lead from his waistcoat pocket, 'one of these,' said he,     'I placed on the lowest key of the organ, and the other upon the     octave above; thus by accommodating the harmony, I produced the     effect of four hands, instead of two.'\"[6]  The dates in this extract are not so well defined as might be wished. HERSCHEL had certainly been more than a few months in England at the time of his meeting with Dr. MILLER, which was probably about 1760. The appointment as organist at Halifax was in 1765, and the pupils and public concerts must have filled up the intervening five years. During a part of this time he lived in Leeds, with the family of Mr. BULMAN, whom he afterwards provided with a place as clerk to the Octagon Chapel, in his usual generous manner.  All during his life he was placing some of the less fortunate and energetic members of his family.  We cannot be too grateful to Dr. MILLER, who, seeing his opportunity, used it. Their frank friendship does honor to both. HERSCHEL'S organ-playing, which no doubt had been begun when his brother was the organist of the garrison chapel at Hanover, must have been perfected at this time, and it was through his organ-playing that he was able to leave the needy life in Yorkshire.  He was sure to have emerged sooner or later, but every year spared to him as a struggling musician was a year saved to Astronomy.  During all this period, a constant correspondence was maintained between the family at Hanover and the absent son.  Many of WILLIAM'S letters were written in English, and addressed to his brother JACOB, and treated of such subjects as the Theory of Music, in which he was already far advanced.  His little sister was still faithful to the memory of her _dearest_ brother, and his father, whose health was steadily declining, became painfully eager for his return. In 1764 (April 2), he returned to Hanover on a very brief visit. He was attached to England, he was prospering there, and he had no inclination towards returning to a life in Hanover. His sister says:      \"Of the joys and pleasures which all felt at this long-wished-for     meeting with my--let me say my _dearest_--brother, but a small     portion could fall to my share; for with my constant attendance at     church and school, besides the time I was employed in doing the     drudgery of the scullery, it was but seldom I could make one in the     group when the family were assembled together.      \"In the first week, some of the orchestra were invited to a concert,     at which some of my brother WILLIAM'S compositions, overtures, etc.,     and some of my eldest brother JACOB'S were performed, to the great     delight of my dear father, who hoped and expected that they would     be turned to some profit by publishing them, but there was no     printer who bid high enough.      \"Sunday, the 8th, was the--to me--eventful day of my confirmation,     and I left home not a little proud and encouraged by my dear brother     WILLIAM'S approbation of my appearance in my new gown.\"  The engagement of HERSCHEL at Halifax did not long continue. In 1766 he obtained an advantageous engagement as oboist at Bath, and soon after the position of organist at the Octagon Chapel was offered to him and accepted. This was a great and important change.  Bath was then, as now, one of the most beautiful cities in England, and the resort of the fashion and rank of the kingdom,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/29033"],["title","Critical Miscellanies (Vol. 3 of 3), Essay 10: Auguste Comte (#1)"],["body","claims as a powerful original thinker, or from his immeasurable pre-eminence over Saint Simon in intellectual grasp and vigour and coherence. As high a degree of originality may be shown in transformation as in invention, as Molière and Shakespeare have proved in the region of dramatic art. In philosophy the conditions are not different. _Il faut prendre son bien où on le trouve._  It is no detriment to Comte's fame that some of the ideas which he recombined and incorporated in a great philosophic structure had their origin in ideas that were produced almost at random in the incessant fermentation of Saint Simon's brain. Comte is in no true sense a follower of Saint Simon, but it was undoubtedly Saint Simon who launched him, to take Comte's own word, by suggesting to his strong and penetrating mind the two starting-points of what grew into the Comtist system--first, that political phenomena are as capable of being grouped under laws as other phenomena; and second, that the true destination of philosophy must be social, and the true object of the thinker must be the reorganisation of the moral, religious, and political systems. We can readily see what an impulse these far-reaching conceptions would give to Comte's meditations. There were conceptions of less importance than these, in which it is impossible not to feel that it was Saint Simon's wrong or imperfect idea that put his young admirer on the track to a right and perfected idea. The subject is not worthy of further discussion. That Comte would have performed some great intellectual achievement, if Saint Simon had never been born, is certain. It is hardly less certain that the great achievement which he did actually perform was originally set in motion by Saint Simon's conversation, though it was afterwards directly filiated with the fertile speculations of Turgot and Condorcet. Comte thought almost as meanly of Plato as he did of Saint Simon, and he considered Aristotle the prince of all true thinkers; yet their vital difference about Ideas did not prevent Aristotle from calling Plato master.  After six years the differences between the old and the young philosopher grew too marked for friendship. Comte began to fret under Saint Simon's pretensions to be his director. Saint Simon, on the other hand, perhaps began to feel uncomfortably conscious of the superiority of his disciple. The occasion of the breach between them (1824) was an attempt on Saint Simon's part to print a production of Comte's as if it were in some sort connected with Saint Simon's schemes of social reorganisation. Comte was never a man to quarrel by halves, and not only was the breach not repaired, but long afterwards Comte, as we have said, with painful ungraciousness took to calling the encourager of his youth by very hard names.  In 1825 Comte married. His marriage was one of those of which 'magnanimity owes no account to prudence,' and it did not turn out prosperously. His family were strongly Catholic and royalist, and they were outraged by his refusal to have the marriage performed other than civilly. They consented, however, to receive his wife, and the pair went on a visit to Montpellier. Madame Comte conceived a dislike to the circle she found there, and this was the too early beginning of disputes which lasted for the remainder of their union. In the year of his marriage we find Comte writing to the most intimate of his correspondents:--'I have nothing left but to concentrate my whole moral existence in my intellectual work, a precious but inadequate compensation; and so I must give up, if not the most dazzling, still the sweetest part of my happiness.' We cannot help admiring the heroism which cherishes great ideas in the midst of petty miseries, and intrepidly throws all squalid interruptions into the background which is their true place. Still, we may well suppose that the sordid cares that come with want of money made a harmonious life none the more easy. Comte tried to find pupils to board with him, but only one pupil came, and he was soon sent away for lack of companions. 'I would rather spend an evening,' wrote the needy enthusiast, 'in solving a difficult question, than in running after some empty-headed and consequential millionaire in search of a pupil.' A little money was earned by an occasional article in _Le Producteur_, in which he began to expound the philosophic ideas that were now maturing in his mind. He announced a course of lectures (1826), which it was hoped would bring money as well as fame, and which were to be the first dogmatic exposition of the Positive Philosophy. A friend had said to him, 'You talk too freely, your ideas are getting abroad, and other people use them without giving you the credit; put your ownership on record.' The lectures were intended to do this among other things, and they attracted hearers so eminent as Humboldt the cosmologist, as Poinsot the geometer, as Blainville the physiologist.  Unhappily, after the third lecture of the course, Comte had a severe attack of cerebral derangement, brought on by intense and prolonged meditation, acting on a system that was already irritated by the chagrin of domestic failure. He did not recover his health for more than a year, and as soon as convalescence set in he was seized by so profound a melancholy at the disaster which had thus overtaken him, that he threw himself into the Seine. Fortunately he was rescued, and the shock did not stay his return to mental soundness. One incident of this painful episode is worth mentioning. Lamennais, then in the height of his Catholic exaltation, persuaded Comte's mother to insist on her son being married with the religious ceremony, and as the younger Madame Comte apparently did not resist, the rite was duly performed, in spite of the fact that the unfortunate man was at the time neither more nor less than raving mad. To such shocking conspiracies against common sense and decency does ecclesiastical zealotry bring even good men like Lamennais. On the other hand, philosophic assailants of Comtism have not always resisted the temptation to recall the circumstance that its founder was once out of his mind,--an unworthy and irrelevant device, that cannot be excused even by the provocation of Comte's own occasional acerbity. As has been justly said, if Newton once suffered a cerebral attack without on that account forfeiting our veneration for the _Principia_, Comte may have suffered in the same way, and still not have forfeited our respect for what is good in the systems of Positive Philosophy and Positive Polity.  In 1828 the lectures were renewed, and in 1830 was published the first volume of the _Course of Positive Philosophy_. The sketch and ground plan of this great undertaking had appeared in 1826. The sixth and last volume was published in 1842. The twelve years covering the publication of the first of Comte's two elaborate works were years of indefatigable toil, and they were the only portion of his life in which he enjoyed a certain measure, and that a very modest measure, of material prosperity. In 1833 he was appointed examiner of the boys in the various provincial schools who aspired to enter the École Polytechnique at Paris. This and two other engagements as a teacher of mathematics secured him an income of some £400 a year. He made M. Guizot, then Louis Philippe's minister, the important proposal to establish a chair of general history of the sciences. If there are four chairs, he argued, devoted to the history of philosophy, that is to say, the minute study of all sorts of dreams and aberrations through the ages, surely there ought to be at least one to explain the formation and progress of our real knowledge? This wise suggestion, which still remains to be acted upon, was at first welcomed, according to Comte's own account, by Guizot's philosophic instinct, and then repulsed by his 'metaphysical rancour.'  Meanwhile Comte did his official work conscientiously, sorely as he grudged the time which it took from the execution of the great object of his thoughts. We cannot forbear to transcribe one delightful and touching trait in connection with this part of Comte's life. 'I hardly know if even to you,' he writes in the expansion of domestic confidence to his wife, 'I dare disclose the sweet and softened feeling that comes over me when I find a young man whose examination is thoroughly satisfactory. Yes, though you may smile, the emotion would easily stir me to tears if I were not carefully on my guard.' Such sympathy with youthful hope; in union with the industry and intelligence that are the only means of bringing the hope to fulfilment, shows that Comte's dry and austere manner veiled the fires of a generous social emotion. It was this which made the overworked student take upon himself the burden of delivering every year from 1831 to 1848 a course of gratuitous lectures on astronomy for a popular audience. The social feeling that inspired this disinterested act showed itself in other ways. He suffered the penalty of imprisonment rather than serve in the national guard; his position was that though he would not take arms against the new monarchy of July, yet being a republican he would take no oath to defend it. The only amusement that Comte permitted himself was a visit to the opera. In his youth he had been a playgoer, but he shortly came to the conclusion that tragedy is a stilted and bombastic art, and after a time comedy interested him no more than tragedy. For the opera he had a genuine passion, which he gratified as often as he could, until his means became too narrow to afford even that single relaxation.  Of his manner and personal appearance we have the following account from one who was his pupil:--'Daily as the clock struck eight on the horologe of the Luxembourg, while the ringing hammer on the bell was yet audible, the door of my room opened, and there entered a man, short, rather stout, almost what one might call sleek,"]]]
