The morn hath come, sweet morn, awake!     And from thy pinions slumber shake.                                     II      Pure as the morn God's presence shines;     Love like its beams, thy life entwines;     Richer the gifts thy God bestows     Than morning beauty can disclose.                                     III      Sweet as the breath that fans the bowers,     And stirs the leaves and opening flowers,     Comes with the morn, the breath divine     To stir thee, slumbering soul of mine.                                     IV      O Thou, the Morn, the Light, the Sun,     With Thee be every day begun;     Brightness shall clothe my life always,     And fill my soul with grateful praise.                                      V      Glory to Thee, O Christ! my Lord,     Light of my soul, Incarnate Word!     Come with the morn, abide alway,     And cheer my course to endless day.                                         I      The saffron tints appear,     The morning comes--'tis here.     Wipe slumber from thine eyes,     Behold the sun arise!                                     II      Clad in his garb of gold,     Bright as he shone of old;     Beams o'er the heavens extend,     Shafts from his orb descend.                                     III      Sun, that in morning light     Rises, nor sinks in night,     Shine in my soul alway,     Make there an endless day.                                     IV      Life for my deadness give;     Shine, that my soul may live;     Joy to my sorrow bring;     Light on Thy glowing wing.                                      V      If 'neath the cloud I lie,     Darkness obscure my sky;     Yet, may my faith behold     Glints of the hidden gold.                                     VI      Father, to Thee, always,     And Holy Ghost, be praise;     Glory, while ages run,     To Thee, O Christ! our Sun.                                         I      Now glows the morn in beauty rare,     O haste my soul to fervent prayer,     And let the wings of morning raise     To God the tribute of thy praise.                                     II      The night is gone; now disappear     The clouds that hung in threatening near;     Day comes apace, and terrors flee,     For light illumes the earth and sea.                                     III      O soul dismayed! when darkness fills     The dismal days with darkling ills,     Rest in the calm the promise gives,     That Christ, thy Light and Glory, lives.                                     IV      Morn shall appear and scatter night;     Light shall appear in noonday might.     Strong in the joy the daylight brings,     Soul, thou shalt rise on glowing wings.                                      V      Morn of my soul, O Christ, Thou art;     Light of my life; my drooping heart     Sings, when Thy countenance benign     Shines as the joys of noonday shine.                                      EVENING                                         I      When night her sable curtain spreads,       And darkness falls on sea and land,     In silent beauty, o'er our heads,           The stars shine grand.                                     II      The orb of day his race hath run,       But see what glory comes to view,     As, full of radiance, one by one,           The stars shine true.                                     III      Now bright their silver light appears,       And reverent eyes behold the sight;     Hope lights the darkness of our fears--           The stars shine bright.                                     IV      When on our life the curtain falls,       And fast descends a threatening night,     Then, lest dismay the soul appals,           The stars shine bright.                                      V      O great the wisdom, great the power,--       God draws the curtains of the night,     And, in the dark and lonesome hour,           The stars shine bright.                                     VI      The glory and the truth of God,       His lovingkindness and His care,--     Such is the light He sheds abroad,           His stars shine rare.                                         I      A crown of gold surpassing rare,     The western hills, in beauty, wear;     And earth and sea reflect the light,     That fades before th' approach of night.                                     II      O Glorious Sun! whose peerless ray     Illumes the realm of endless day,     Shine on a world where darkness dwells,     And all the joy of day dispels.                                     III      Soft o'er the land the twilight creeps;     Night falls apace, and nature sleeps;     O let not night my life control,     And plunge in sleep my drowsy soul.                                     IV      Sleep to the weary pilgrim give,     But let the soul through slumber live;     Wake when the first faint gleam of morn     Tells that another day is born.                                      V      Light of my life! bid night depart,     Sing to my soul, and cheer my heart;     That morn, and noon, and night may be     One beauteous day of joy to me.                                     VI      And when the brightest morn shall break,     And bid the eternal day awake,     O Glorious Sun! in radiance shine,     To guard from night the realm divine.
