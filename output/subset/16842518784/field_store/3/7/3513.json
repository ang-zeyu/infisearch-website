It was a simple but effective disguise.  [Illustration]  Carefully carrying the loaded trays, surrounded by a crowd of excited patrons, they made their way to the cashier's window. The manager himself was there, wearing a sickly grin. Even the grin faded when he counted the chips.  \"Could you come back in the morning,\" he said, \"I'm afraid we don't have that kind of money on hand.\"  \"What's the matter,\" Kerk shouted, \"trying to get out of paying him? You took _my_ money easy enough when I lost--it works both ways!\"  The onlookers, always happy to see the house lose, growled their disagreement. Jason finished the matter in a loud voice.  \"I'll be reasonable, give me what cash you have and I'll take a check for the balance.\"  There was no way out. Under the watchful eye of the gleeful crowd the manager packed an envelope with bills and wrote a check. Jason took a quick glimpse at it, then stuffed it into an inside pocket. With the envelope under one arm he followed Kerk towards the door.  Because of the onlookers there was no trouble in the main room, but just as they reached the side entrance two men moved in, blocking the way.  \"Just a moment--\" one said. He never finished the sentence. Kerk walked into them without slowing and they bounced away like tenpins. Then Kerk and Jason were out of the building and walking fast.  \"Into the parking lot,\" Kerk said. \"I have a car there.\"  When they rounded the corner there was a car bearing down on them. Before Jason could get his gun clear of the holster Kerk was in front of him. His arm came up and his big ugly gun burst through the cloth of his sleeve and jumped into his hand. A single shot killed the driver and the car swerved and crashed. The other two men in the car died coming out of the door, their guns dropping from their hands.  After that they had no trouble. Kerk drove at top speed away from the Casino, the torn sleeve of his pajamas whipping in the breeze, giving glimpses of the big gun back in the holster.  \"When you get the chance,\" Jason said, \"you'll have to show me how that trick holster works.\"  \"When we get the chance,\" Kerk answered as he dived the car into the city access tube.     III.   The building they stopped at was one of the finer residences in Cassylia. As they had driven, Jason counted the money and separated his share. Almost sixteen million credits. It still didn't seem quite real. When they got out in front of the building he gave Kerk the rest.  \"Here's your three billion, don't think it was easy,\" he said.  \"It could have been worse,\" was his only answer.  The recorded voice scratched in the speaker over the door.  \"Sire Ellus has retired for the night, would you please call again in the morning. All appointments are made in advan--\"  The voice broke off as Kerk pushed the door open. He did it almost effortlessly with the flat of his hand. As they went in Jason looked at the remnants of torn and twisted metal that hung in the lock and wondered again about his companion.  _Strength--more than physical strength--he's like an elemental force. I have the feeling that nothing can stop him._  It made him angry--and at the same time fascinated him. He didn't want out of the deal until he found out more about Kerk and his planet. And \"they\" who had died for the money he gambled.  Sire Ellus was old, balding and angry, not at all used to having his rest disturbed. His complaints stopped suddenly when Kerk threw the money down on the table.  \"Is the ship being loaded yet, Ellus? Here's the balance due.\" Ellus only fumbled the bills for a moment before he could answer Kerk's question.  \"The ship--but, of course. We began loading when you gave us the deposit. You'll have to excuse my confusion, this is a little irregular. We never handle transactions of this size in cash.\"  \"That's the way I like to do business,\" Kerk answered him, \"I've canceled the deposit, this is the total sum. Now how about a receipt.\"  Ellus had made out the receipt before his senses returned. He held it tightly while he looked uncomfortably at the three billion spread out before him.  \"Wait--I can't take it now, you'll have to return in the morning, to the bank. In normal business fashion,\" Ellus decided firmly.  Kerk reached over and gently drew the paper out of Ellus' hand.  \"Thanks for the receipt,\" he said. \"I won't be here in the morning so this will be satisfactory. And if you're worried about the money I suggest you get in touch with some of your plant guards or private police. You'll feel a lot safer.\"  When they left through the shattered door Ellus was frantically dialing numbers on his screen. Kerk answered Jason's next question before he could ask it.  \"I imagine you would like to live to spend that money in your pocket, so I've booked two seats on an interplanetary ship,\" he glanced at the car clock. \"It leaves in about two hours so we have plenty of time. I'm hungry, let's find a restaurant. I hope you have nothing at the hotel worth going back for. It would be a little difficult.\"  \"Nothing worth getting killed for,\" Jason said. \"Now where can we go to eat--there are a few questions I would like to ask you.\"         *       *       *       *       *  They circled carefully down to the transport levels until they were sure they hadn't been followed. Kerk nosed the car into a darkened loading dock where they abandoned it.  \"We can always get another car,\" he said, \"and they probably have this one spotted. Let's walk back to the freightway, I saw a restaurant there as we came by.\"  Dark and looming shapes of overland freight carriers filled the parking lot. They picked their way around the man-high wheels and into the hot and noisy restaurant. The drivers and early morning workers took no notice of them as they found a booth in the back and dialed a meal.  Kerk chiseled a chunk of meat off the slab in front of him and popped it cheerfully into his mouth. \"Ask your questions,\" he said. \"I'm feeling much better already.\"  \"What's in this ship you arranged for tonight--what kind of a cargo was I risking my neck for?\"  \"I thought you were risking your neck for money,\" Kerk said dryly. \"But be assured it was in a good cause. That cargo means the survival of a world. Guns, ammunition, mines, explosives and such.\"  Jason choked over a mouthful of food. \"Gun-running! What are you doing, financing a private war? And how can you talk about survival with a lethal cargo like that? Don't try and tell me they have a peaceful use. Who are you killing?\"  Most of the big man's humor had vanished, he had that grim look Jason knew well.  \"Yes, peaceful would be the right word. Because that is basically all we want. Just to live in peace. And it is not _who_ are we killing--it is _what_ we are killing.\"  Jason pushed his plate away with an angry gesture. \"You're talking in riddles,\" he said. \"What you say has no meaning.\"  \"It has meaning enough,\" Kerk told him, \"but only on one planet in the universe. Just how much do you know about Pyrrus?\"  \"Absolutely nothing.\"  For a moment Kerk sat wrapped in memory, scowling distantly. Then he went on.  \"Mankind doesn't belong on Pyrrus--yet has been there for almost three hundred years now. The age expectancy of my people is sixteen years. Of course most adults live beyond that, but the high child mortality brings the average down.  \"It is everything that a humanoid world should not be. The gravity is nearly twice Earth normal. The temperature can vary daily from arctic to tropic. The climate--well you have to experience it to believe it. Like nothing you've seen anywhere else in the galaxy.\"  \"I'm frightened,\" Jason said dryly. \"What do you have--methane or chlorine reactions? I've been down on planets like that--\"         *       *       *       *       *  Kerk slammed his hand down hard on the table. The dishes bounced and the table legs creaked. \"Laboratory reactions!\" he growled. \"They look great on a bench--but what happens when you have a world filled with those compounds? In an eye-wink of galactic time all the violence is locked up in nice, stable compounds. The atmosphere may be poisonous for an oxygen breather, but taken by itself it's as harmless as weak beer.  \"There is only one setup that is pure poison as a planetary atmosphere. Plenty of H{2}O, the most universal solvent you can find, plus free oxygen to work on--\"  \"Water and oxygen!\" Jason broke in. \"You mean Earth--or a planet like Cassylia here? That's preposterous.\"  \"Not at all. Because you were born in this kind of environment you accept it as right and natural. You take it for granted that metals corrode, coastlines change, and storms interfere with communication. These are normal occurrences on oxygen-water worlds. On Pyrrus these conditions are carried to the nth degree.  \"The planet has an axial tilt of almost forty-two degrees, so there is a tremendous change in temperature from season to season. This is one of the prime causes of a constantly changing icecap. The weather generated by this is spectacular to say the least.\"  \"If that's all,\" Jason said, \"I don't see why--\"  \"That's _not_ all--it's barely the beginning. The open seas perform the dual destructive function of supplying water vapor to keep the weather going, and building up gigantic tides. Pyrrus' two satellites, Samas and Bessos, combine at times to pull the oceans up into thirty meter tides. And until you've seen one of these tides lap over into an active volcano you've seen nothing.  \"Heavy elements are what brought us to Pyrrus--and these same elements keep the planet at a volcanic boil. There have been at least thirteen super-novas in the immediate stellar neighborhood. Heavy elements can be found on most of their planets of course--as well as completely unbreathable atmospheres. Long-term mining and exploitation can't be done by anything but a self-sustaining colony. Which meant Pyrrus.

This policy was not devised in order to set bounds to the expansion of the older colonies; that was an afterthought. The policy had its root in an honest desire to protect the Indians from the frauds of unscrupulous traders and from the encroachments of settlers on their hunting grounds. The need of a conciliatory, if firm, policy in regard to the great interior was made evident by the Pontiac rising in 1763, the aftermath of the defeat of the French, who had done all they could to inspire the Indians with hatred for the advancing English.  How to deal with Canada was a more thorny problem. The colony had not been sought by its conquerors for itself. It was counted of little worth. The verdict of its late possessors, as recorded in Voltaire's light farewell to \"a few arpents of snow,\" might be discounted as an instance of sour grapes; but the estimate of its new possessors was evidently little higher, since they debated long and dubiously whether in the peace settlement they should retain Canada or the little sugar island of Guadeloupe, a mere pin point on the map. Canada had been conquered not for the good it might bring but for the harm it was doing as a base for French attack upon the English colonies--\"the wasps' nest must be smoked out.\" But once it had been taken, it had to be dealt with for itself.  The policy first adopted was a simple one, natural enough for eighteenth-century Englishmen. They decided to make Canada* over in the image of the old colonies, to turn the \"new subjects,\" as they were called, in good time into Englishmen and Protestants. A generation or two would suffice, in the phrase of Francis Maseres--himself a descendant of a Huguenot refugee but now wholly an Englishman--for \"melting down the French nation into the English in point of language, affections, religion, and laws.\" Immigration was to be encouraged from Britain and from the other American colonies, which, in the view of the Lords of Trade, were already overstocked and in danger of being forced by the scarcity or monopoly of land to take up manufactures which would compete with English wares. And since it would greatly contribute to speedy settlement, so the Royal Proclamation of 1763 declared, that the King's subjects should be informed of his paternal care for the security of their liberties and properties, it was promised that, as soon as circumstances would permit, a General Assembly would be summoned, as in the older colonies. The laws of England, civil and criminal, as near as might be, were to prevail. The Roman Catholic subjects were to be free to profess their own religion, \"so far as the laws of Great Britain permit,\" but they were to be shown a better way. To the first Governor instructions were issued \"that all possible Encouragement shall be given to the erecting Protestant Schools in the said Districts, Townships and Precincts, by settling and appointing and allotting proper Quantities of Land for that Purpose and also for a Glebe and Maintenance for a Protestant minister and Protestant schoolmasters.\" Thus in the fullness of time, like Acadia, but without any Evangelise of Grand Pre, without any drastic policy of expulsion, impossible with seventy thousand people scattered over a wide area, even Canada would become a good English land, a newer New England.       * The Royal Proclamation of 1763 set the bounds of the new      colony. They were surprisingly narrow, a mere strip along      both sides of the St. Lawrence from a short distance beyond      the Ottawa on the west, to the end of the Gasps peninsula on      the east. The land to the northeast was put under the      jurisdiction of the Governor of Newfoundland, and the Great      Lakes region was included in the territory reserved for the      Indians.  It is questionable whether this policy could ever have achieved success even if it had been followed for generations without rest or turning. But it was not destined to be given a long trial. From the very beginning the men on the spot, the soldier Governors of Canada, urged an entirely contrary policy on the Home Government, and the pressure of events soon brought His Majesty's Ministers to concur.  As the first civil Governor of Canada, the British authorities chose General Murray, one of Wolfe's ablest lieutenants, who since 1760 had served as military Governor of the Quebec district. He was to be aided in his task by a council composed of the Lieutenant Governors of Montreal and Three Rivers, the Chief Justice, the head of the customs, and eight citizens to be named by the Governor from \"the most considerable of the persons of property\" in the province.  The new Governor was a blunt, soldierly man, upright and just according to his lights, but deeply influenced by his military and aristocratic leanings. Statesmen thousands of miles away might plan to encourage English settlers and English political ways and to put down all that was French. To the man on the spot English settlers meant \"the four hundred and fifty contemptible sutlers and traders\" who had come in the wake of the army from New England and New York, with no proper respect for their betters, and vulgarly and annoyingly insistent upon what they claimed to be their rights. The French might be alien in speech and creed, but at least the seigneurs and the higher clergy were gentlemen, with a due respect for authority, the King's and their own, and the habitants were docile, the best of soldier stuff. \"Little, very little,\" Murray wrote in 1764 to the Lords of Trade, \"will content the New Subjects, but nothing will satisfy the Licentious Fanaticks Trading here, but the expulsion of the Canadians, who are perhaps the bravest and best race upon the Globe, a Race, who cou'd they be indulged with a few priviledges wch the Laws of England deny to Roman Catholicks at home, wou'd soon get the better of every National Antipathy to their Conquerors and become the most faithful and most useful set of Men in this American Empire.\"*       * This quotation and those following in this chapter are      from official documents most conveniently assembled in Shorn      and Doughty, \"Documents relating to the Constitutional      History of Canada, 1759-1791\", and Doughty and McArthur,      \"Documents relating to the Constitutional History of Canada,      1791-1818\".  Certainly there was much in the immediate situation to justify Murray's attitude. It was preposterous to set up a legislature in which only the four hundred Protestants might sit and from which the seventy thousand Catholics would be barred. It would have been difficult in any case to change suddenly the system of laws governing the most intimate transactions of everyday life. But when, as happened, the Administration was entrusted in large part to newly created justices of the peace, men with \"little French and less honour,\" \"to whom it is only possible to speak with guineas in one's hand,\" the change became flatly impossible. Such an alteration, if still insisted upon, must come more slowly than the impatient traders in Montreal and Quebec desired.  The British Government, however, was not yet ready to abandon its policy. The Quebec traders petitioned for Murray's recall, alleging that the measures required to encourage settlement had not been adopted, that the Governor was encouraging factions by his partiality to the French, that he treated the traders with \"a Rage and Rudeness of Language and Demeanor\" and--a fair thrust in return for his reference to them as \"the most immoral collection of men I ever knew\"--as \"discountenancing the Protestant Religion by almost a Total Neglect of Attendance upon the Service of the Church.\" When the London business correspondents of the traders backed up this petition, the Government gave heed. In 1766 Murray was recalled to England and, though he was acquitted of the charges against him, he did not return to his post in Canada.  The triumph of the English merchants was short. They had jumped from the frying pan into the fire. General Guy Carleton, Murray's successor and brother officer under Wolfe, was an even abler man, and he was still less in sympathy with democracy of the New England pattern. Moreover, a new factor had come in to reenforce the soldier's instinctive preference for gentlemen over shopkeepers. The first rumblings of the American Revolution had reached Quebec. It was no time, in Carleton's view, to set up another sucking republic. Rather, he believed, the utmost should be made of the opportunity Canada afforded as a barrier against the advance of democracy, a curb upon colonial insolence. The need of cultivating the new subjects was the greater, Carleton contended, because the plan of settlement by Englishmen gave no sign of succeeding: \"barring a Catastrophe shocking to think of, this Country must, to the end of Time, be peopled by the Canadian race.\"  To bind the Canadians firmly to England, Carleton proposed to work chiefly through their old leaders, the seigneurs and the clergy. He would restore to the people their old system of laws, both civil and criminal. He would confirm the seigneurs in their feudal dues and fines, which the habitants were growing slack in paying now that the old penalties were not enforced, and he would give them honors and emoluments such as they had before enjoyed as officers in regular or militia regiments. The Roman Catholic clergy were already, in fact, confirmed in their right to tithe and toll; and, without objection from the Governor, Bishop Briand, elected by the chapter in Quebec and consecrated in Paris, once more assumed control over the flock.  Carleton's proposals did not pass unquestioned. His own chief legal adviser, Francis Maseres, was a sturdy adherent of the older policy, though he agreed that the time was not yet ripe for setting up an Assembly"]]]
