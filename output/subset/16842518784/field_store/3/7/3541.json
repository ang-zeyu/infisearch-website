I suspect that those who have criticised Mr.      Hope's work with asperity have never seen his house.       These sentiments are not the result of partiality or      prejudice, for I am wholly unacquainted with Mr. Hope. They      are delivered with zeal, but with deference. It is quite      consolatory to find a gentleman of large fortune, of      respectable ancestry, and of classical attainments, devoting      a great portion of that leisure time which hangs like a      leaden weight upon the generality of fashionable people, to      the service of the Fine Arts, and in the patronage of merit      and ingenuity. How much the world will again be indebted to      Mr. Hope's taste and liberality may be anticipated from the      \"_Costume of the Ancients_,\" a work which has recently been      published under his particular superintendence.]       [Footnote A: This book is beautifully executed, undoubtedly,      but being little more than a thin folio pamphlet devoid of      _typographical_ embellishment--it has been thought by some      hardly fair to say this of a press which brought out so many      works characterized by magnitude and various elegance. B.B.]  To say that I was not gratified by the perusal of it would be a confession contrary to the truth; but to say how ardently I anticipated an amplification of the subject, how eagerly I looked forward to a number of curious, apposite, and amusing anecdotes, and found them not therein, is an avowal of which I need not fear the rashness, when the known talents of the detector of Stern's plagiarisms[4] are considered. I will not, however, disguise to you that I read it with uniform delight, and that I rose from the perusal with a keener appetite for       \"The small, rare volume, black with tarnished gold.\"       _Dr. Ferriar's Ep._ v. 138.       [Footnote 4: In the fourth volume of the Transactions of the      Manchester Literary Society, part iv., p. 45-87, will be      found a most ingenious and amusing Essay, entitled      \"_Comments on Sterne_,\" which excited a good deal of      interest at the time of its publication. This discovery may      be considered, in some measure, as the result of the      BIBLIOMANIA. In my edition of Sir Thomas More's Utopia, a      suggestion is thrown out that even Burton may have been an      imitator of Boisatuau [Transcriber's Note: Boiastuau]: see      vol. II. 143.]  Whoever undertakes to write down the follies which grow out of an excessive attachment to any particular pursuit, be that pursuit horses,[5] hawks, dogs, guns, snuff boxes,[6] old china, coins, or rusty armour, may be thought to have little consulted the best means of ensuring success for his labours, when he adopts the dull vehicle of _Prose_ for the commnication [Transcriber's Note: communication] of his ideas not considering that from _Poetry_ ten thousand bright scintillations are struck off, which please and convince while they attract and astonish. Thus when Pope talks of allotting for       \"Pembroke[7] Statues, dirty Gods and Coins;      Rare monkish manuscripts for Hearne[8] alone;      And books to Mead[9] and butterflies to Sloane,\"[10]  when he says that       These Aldus[11] printed, those Du S[=u]eil has bound[12]  moreover that       For Locke or Milton[13] 'tis in vain to look;      These shelves admit not any modern book;  he not only seems to illustrate the propriety of the foregoing remark, by shewing the immense superiority of verse to prose, in ridiculing reigning absurdities, but he seems to have had a pretty strong foresight of the BIBLIOMANIA which rages at the present day. However, as the ancients tell us that a Poet cannot be a _manufactured_ creature, and as I have not the smallest pretensions to the \"rhyming art,\" [although in former times[14] I did venture to dabble with it] I must of necessity have recourse to _Prose_; and, at the same time, to your candour and forbearance in perusing the pages which ensue.       [Footnote 5: It may be taken for granted that the first book      in this country which excited a passion for the _Sports of      the field_ was Dame Juliana Berners, or Barnes's, work, on      _Hunting and Hawking_, printed at St. Alban's, in the year      1486; of which Lord Spencer's copy is, I believe, the only      perfect one known. It was formerly the Poet Mason's, and is      mentioned in the quarto edition of Hoccleve's Poems, p. 19,      1786. See too Bibl. Mason. Pt. iv. No. 153. Whether the      forementioned worthy lady was really the author of the work      has been questioned. Her book was reprinted by Wynkyn de      Worde in 1497, with an additional Treatise on _Fishing_.

What apology my friend Mr. Haslewood, the      author of them, has to offer in extenuation of the mischief      committed, it is _his_ business, and not mine, to consider;      and what the public will say to his curious forthcoming      reprint of the ancient edition of Wynkyn De Worde _on      Hunting, Hawking, and Fishing_, 1497 (with wood cuts), I      will not pretend to divine!

SOME NATURAL PHENOMENA:--Why sun-heat varies in intensity--The tides--Why high tide varies daily      410     HOW IT WORKS.     Chapter I.  THE STEAM-ENGINE.

WHAT IS STEAM?  If ice be heated above 32° Fahrenheit, its molecules lose their cohesion, and move freely round one another--the ice is turned into water. Heat water above 212° Fahrenheit, and the molecules exhibit a violent mutual repulsion, and, like dormant bees revived by spring sunshine, separate and dart to and fro. If confined in an air-tight vessel, the molecules have their flights curtailed, and beat more and more violently against their prison walls, so that every square inch of the vessel is subjected to a rising pressure. We may compare the action of the steam molecules to that of bullets fired from a machine-gun at a plate mounted on a spring. The faster the bullets came, the greater would be the continuous compression of the spring.   THE MECHANICAL ENERGY OF STEAM.  If steam is let into one end of a cylinder behind an air-tight but freely-moving piston, it will bombard the walls of the cylinder and the piston; and if the united push of the molecules on the one side of the latter is greater than the resistance on the other side opposing its motion, the piston must move. Having thus partly got their liberty, the molecules become less active, and do not rush about so vigorously. The pressure on the piston decreases as it moves. But if the piston were driven back to its original position against the force of the steam, the molecular activity--that is, pressure--would be restored. We are here assuming that no heat has passed through the cylinder or piston and been radiated into the air; for any loss of heat means loss of energy, since heat _is_ energy.   THE BOILER.  The combustion of fuel in a furnace causes the walls of the furnace to become _hot_, which means that the molecules of the substance forming the walls are thrown into violent agitation. If the walls are what are called \"good conductors\" of heat, they will transmit the agitation through them to any surrounding substance. In the case of the ordinary house stove this is the air, which itself is agitated, or grows warm. A steam-boiler has the furnace walls surrounded by water, and its function is to transmit molecular movement (heat, or energy) through the furnace plates to the water until the point is reached when steam generates. At atmospheric pressure--that is, if not confined in any way--steam would fill 1,610 times the space which its molecules occupied in their watery formation. If we seal up the boiler so that no escape is possible for the steam molecules, their motion becomes more and more rapid, and _pressure_ is developed by their beating on the walls of the boiler. There is theoretically no limit to which the pressure may be raised, provided that sufficient fuel-combustion energy is transmitted to the vaporizing water.  To raise steam in large quantities we must employ a fuel which develops great heat in proportion to its weight, is readily procured, and cheap. Coal fulfils all these conditions. Of the 800 million tons mined annually throughout the world, 400 million tons are burnt in the furnaces of steam-boilers.  A good boiler must be--(1) Strong enough to withstand much higher pressures than that at which it is worked; (2) so designed as to burn its fuel to the greatest advantage.  Even in the best-designed boilers a large part of the combustion heat passes through the chimney, while a further proportion is radiated from the boiler. Professor John Perry[1] considers that this waste amounts, under the best conditions at present obtainable, to eleven-twelfths of the whole. We have to burn a shillingsworth of coal to capture the energy stored in a pennyworth. Yet the steam-engine of to-day is three or four times as efficient as the engine of fifty years ago. This is due to radical improvements in the design of boilers and of the machinery which converts the heat energy of steam into mechanical motion.   CIRCULATION OF WATER IN A BOILER.  If you place a pot filled with water on an open fire, and watch it when it boils, you will notice that the water heaves up at the sides and plunges down at the centre. This is due to the water being heated most at the sides, and therefore being lightest there. The rising steam-bubbles also carry it up. On reaching the surface, the bubbles burst, the steam escapes, and the water loses some of its heat, and rushes down again to take the place of steam-laden water rising.  [Illustration: FIG. 1.]  [Illustration: FIG. 2.]  If the fire is very fierce, steam-bubbles may rise from all points at the bottom, and impede downward currents (Fig. 1). The pot then \"boils over.\"  Fig. 2 shows a method of preventing this trouble. We lower into our pot a vessel of somewhat smaller diameter, with a hole in the bottom, arranged in such a manner as to leave a space between it and the pot all round. The upward currents are then separated entirely from the downward, and the fire can be forced to a very much greater extent than before without the water boiling over. This very simple arrangement is the basis of many devices for producing free circulation of the water in steam-boilers.  We can easily follow out the process of development. In Fig. 3 we see a simple U-tube depending from a vessel of water. Heat is applied to the left leg, and a steady circulation at once commences. In order to increase the heating surface we can extend the heated leg into a long incline (Fig. 4), beneath which three lamps instead of only one are placed. The direction of the circulation is the same, but its rate is increased.  [Illustration: FIG. 3.]  A further improvement results from increasing the number of tubes (Fig. 5), keeping them all on the slant, so that the heated water and steam may rise freely.   THE ENCLOSED FURNACE.  [Illustration: FIG. 4.]  [Illustration: FIG. 5.]  Still, a lot of the heat gets away. In a steam-boiler the burning fuel is enclosed either by fire-brick or a \"water-jacket,\" forming part of the boiler. A water-jacket signifies a double coating of metal plates with a space between, which is filled with water (see Fig. 6). The fire is now enclosed much as it is in a kitchen range. But our boiler must not be so wasteful of the heat as is that useful household fixture. On their way to the funnel the flames and hot gases should act on a very large metal or other surface in contact with the water of the boiler, in order to give up a due proportion of their heat.  [Illustration: FIG. 6.--Diagrammatic sketch of a locomotive type of boiler. Water indicated by dotted lines. The arrows show the direction taken by the air and hot gases from the air-door to the funnel.]   THE MULTITUBULAR BOILER.  [Illustration: FIG. 7.--The Babcock and Wilcox water-tube boiler. One side of the brick seating has been removed to show the arrangement of the water-tubes and furnace.]  To save room, boilers which have to make steam very quickly and at high pressures are largely composed of pipes. Such boilers we call multitubular. They are of two kinds--(1) _Water_-tube boilers; in which the water circulates through tubes exposed to the furnace heat. The Babcock and Wilcox boiler (Fig. 7) is typical of this variety. (2) _Fire_-tube boilers; in which the hot gases pass through tubes surrounded by water. The ordinary locomotive boiler (Fig. 6) illustrates this form.  The Babcock and Wilcox boiler is widely used in mines, power stations, and, in a modified form, on shipboard. It consists of two main parts--(1) A drum, H, in the upper part of which the steam collects; (2) a group of pipes arranged on the principle illustrated by Fig. 5. The boiler is seated on a rectangular frame of fire-bricks. At one end is the furnace door; at the other the exit to the chimney. From the furnace F the flames and hot gases rise round the upper end of the sloping tubes TT into the space A, where they play upon the under surface of H before plunging downward again among the tubes into the space B. Here the temperature is lower. The arrows indicate further journeys upwards into the space C on the right of a fire-brick division, and past the down tubes SS into D, whence the hot gases find an escape into the chimney through the opening E. It will be noticed that the greatest heat is brought to bear on TT near their junction with UU, the \"uptake\" tubes; and that every succeeding passage of the pipes brings the gradually cooling gases nearer to the \"downtake\" tubes SS.  The pipes TT are easily brushed and scraped after the removal of plugs from the \"headers\" into which the tube ends are expanded.  Other well-known water-tube boilers are the Yarrow, Belleville, Stirling, and Thorneycroft, all used for driving marine engines.   FIRE-TUBE BOILERS.  Fig. 6 shows a locomotive boiler in section. To the right is the fire-box, surrounded on all sides by a water-jacket in direct communication with the barrel of the boiler. The inner shell of the fire-box is often made of copper, which withstands the fierce heat better than steel; the outer, like the rest of the boiler, is of steel plates from 1/2 to 3/4 inch thick. The shells of the jacket are braced together by a large number of rivets, RR; and the top, or crown, is strengthened by heavy longitudinal girders riveted to it, or is braced to the top of the boiler by long bolts. A large number of fire-tubes (only three are shown in the diagram for the sake of simplicity) extend from the fire-box to the smoke-box. The most powerful \"mammoth\" American locomotives have 350 or more tubes, which, with the fire-box, give 4,000"]]]
