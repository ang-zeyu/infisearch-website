Do you have union affiliation?\"  \"No. Spacemen aren't required to join the U.F.W.\"  \"If you want to give me a part payment on the initiation fee, I'll be glad to issue--\"  \"It'll be a long, hard winter before Eric Young gets any of my credits,\" Hunter said, his eyes narrowing. Considering how Hunter felt about the Union of Free Workers and the labor czar, Eric Young, he thought he had phrased his answer with remarkable restraint.  \"Anti-labor,\" the clerk said, and typed the designation on the form.  \"No,\" Hunter snapped, \"and I won't be labeled that. As far as the individual goes, I believe he has every right to organize. No one can stand up against the cartels in any other way. But this exploitation by Young--\"  \"You either join the U.F.W., or you're against us.\" The clerk shrugged disinterestedly. \"It's all one and the same thing to me, Captain. However, if you expect a job in the city, you'll have to get it through the union.\" He typed again on the customs form. \"According to a new regulation, I'm obliged to classify you as unemployed, and that restricts you to limited areas of Los Angeles as well as--\"  \"When the hell did they put over a law like that?\"  \"Two weeks ago, sir. It gives the clinics a closer control over the potentially maladjusted, and it should help ease the pressure--\"  \"There are no exceptions?\"  \"The executive classifications, naturally--professionals, and spacemen. That would have included you, Captain Hunter, but you say you've left the service.\"  Hunter gritted his teeth. It had been like this for as long as he could remember. Whenever he returned from a long flight there was always a new form of regimentation to adjust to. And always for the same reason--to stop the steadily rising incidence of psychotic maladjustment.  \"How does the law define an executive?\" Hunter asked.  \"Job bracket with one of the cartels,\" the clerk replied. \"Or the total credits held on deposit with a recognized fund.\"  The captain flung his savings book on the counter. The clerk glanced at the balance and X'ed out the last word he had typed on the customs form.  \"You qualify, sir--with a thousand credits to spare. I'll give you a city-wide clearance as an executive. But I can only make it temporary. You'll have to check once each week with the U.F.W. office. If your balance drops below ninety-five thousand, you'll be reclassified.\"  The clerk ran another celluloid card--this time it was blue--through the stamping machine and passed it across to Hunter. Captain Hunter picked up his bag and entered the customs booth, which by that time was empty. The probe lights glowed from the walls and ceiling, efficiently X-raying his bag and his clothing for any prohibited imports. Within seconds the alarm bell clanged and the metal doors banged shut, imprisoning Hunter in the booth.  Now what? he asked himself. What regulation had he violated this time? In his mind he inventoried the contents of his bag. It contained only a handful of personal belongings, and the tools of trade which he had needed as a captain of a fighting ship. Everything was legitimate and above-board. Hunter hadn't even brought Ann a souvenir from the frontier.         *       *       *       *       *  After a time, the booth door swung open. A senior inspector, carrying a blaster, crowded into the cubicle.  \"Open your bag!\" The inspector commanded, motioning with his weapon.  Hunter saw that the blaster dial was set to fire the death charge, not the weaker dispersal charge which produced only an hour's paralysis.  Hunter thumbed the photocell lock. It responded to the individual pattern of his thumbprint, and the bag fell open. The inspector picked up the worn blaster which lay under Hunter's shipboard uniform.  \"Smuggling firearms, Captain, is a violation of the city code. The fine is--\"  \"Smuggling?\" Hunter exploded. \"That blaster was registered to me nine years ago.\" He snapped open his wallet.  The inspector frowned over the registration form, biting indecisively at his lower lip.  \"That was issued before my time,\" he alibied. \"I'll have to check the regulations. It may take a while.\"  He left the booth. He was gone for a quarter of an hour. When he returned, both metal doors snapped open. \"Your permit is valid, Captain Hunter,\" the inspector admitted. \"Unrestricted registrations like yours have not been issued for the past five years. That's why the probe was not adjusted to the special conditions which apply in your case. Your permit is revocable if you are committed for maladjustment.\"  Hunter grinned. \"I wouldn't count on that. My adjustment index is zero-zero.\"  \"A paragon, Captain.\" The voice was dry and biting. \"But you may find conditions on the Earth a little trying. You haven't had a chance to get really well-acquainted with your own world since you were a kid of sixteen.\"  Hunter's customs clearance had taken more than an hour. Before he left the municipal building, he made a quick tour of the lobby, searching again for Ann Saymer. Satisfied that she had not come, he put in a call from a public tele-booth to Ann's apartment residence. After a moment, Mrs. Ames' face came into sharp focus on the screen, the light coalescing about her hair.  A warm, motherly widow of nearly eighty, Mrs. Ames had been the residence's owner for a decade, and had taken a great deal of vicarious pleasure in Ann's romance with the captain. \"It's so different,\" she said once to Hunter, \"your faith in each other, the way you work together for a goal you both want. If the rest of us could only learn to have some honest affection for each other. But, there, I'm an old woman, living too much in the past.\"  As soon as Hunter saw her face on the screen, he knew that something was wrong. She was tense and nervous, tied in the emotional knots of an anxiety neurosis. And Mrs. Ames was not the woman to fall easy victim to mental illness. If Hunter had been guessing the odds, he would have put her adjustment index on a par with his own.  \"I haven't seen Ann for a month,\" she told him.  \"Where is she? My last micropic from her said something about a commission-job--\"  \"She's all right, Max. Did you join the U.F.W.?\"  \"I'll be damned if I will.\"  Why had she asked him that? Her question seemed totally unrelated to her reassurance as to Ann--another clear symptom of her emotional unbalance.  \"About Ann, Mrs. Ames,\" he persisted. \"Do you know what clinic gave her the commission?\"  Mrs. Ames stared at him in surprise. \"Ann didn't tell you in her micropic?\"  \"We use a personal code,\" he explained. \"That makes a certain type of communication extremely difficult.\"  \"I didn't see her, Max. After she took the commission some men came for her things. They brought me a note from Ann, but it didn't tell me where she was. It just authorized the men to move out her belongings.\"  \"Is the work outside of Los Angeles? Do you know that much?\"  \"At first I guessed--\" She broke off, biting her lip, and her face twisted in an agony of intense feeling. \"No, Max, an old woman's guesses won't help. I can't tell you any more about it.\"  \"I'll come out and see you this afternoon, Mrs. Ames,\" he promised, \"after I check in at the Roost. I want to look at that note you had from Ann.\"   III  Captain Hunter left the municipal building and stood on the transit platform. It was blazing hot in the noon sun, and he considered chartering an autojet to the city, as he always had before. But though a jet was faster than the monorail it was also more expensive. Acutely mindful that he had left the service and would earn no more juicy credit bonuses, he took the monorail instead.  He had only a ten-minute wait before a crowded car screamed to a stop at the port station. Hunter went aboard, along with four passengers from recent inbound flights--laboring class tourists returning from vacations on one of the planetoid resorts. Since a majority of the people who passed through the spaceport were executives or professionals, they used the autojets.  Hunter's uniform set him apart. A spaceman was expected to live high, to throw away credits like the glamor heroes on the Tri-D space dramas.  The monorail car was crowded, primarily with afternoon-shift workers on their way to the industrial area. They all wore on their tunics the discs of the Union of Free Workers. The four tourists who went aboard at the spaceport with Hunter pulled out their U.F.W. badges and pinned them on. They belonged. Hunter didn't.  He found an empty chair at the rear of the car, beside a gaudily attired woman, whose union disc proclaimed her a member of Local 47, the Recreational Companion Union. What miracles we perform, Hunter thought, with a judicial selection of innocuous words!  He glanced at the woman. She was past the first bloom of youth and her face, under her makeup, was heavily lined, her eyes shrewd and observing. Had he known that she had been shadowing him almost from the instant of his arrival in Los Angeles, and had been awaiting his return to Earth in obedience to carefully formulated instructions he would not have regarded her so complacently.  The monorail shot up toward the Palms-Pine pass of the San Jacinto Mountains. From the crest of the grade Hunter could look back at the flat, cemented field of the spaceport and the ragged teeth of the launching tubes rearing high on the Mojave. Ahead of him, misted by the blue haze of industrial smog, was Los Angeles, the capital city of Sector West--and indirectly the capital of the entire planet.  Almost indistinct against the horizon were the soaring, Babel towers, the tangled network of walk-levels, jet-ways and private landing flats, which was the center-city. The lower, bulky factory buildings squatted under the towers and spreading outward from them, like concentric rings made by a stone hurled into a quiet pool, was the monotonous clutter of the minimum-"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31062"],["title","The Cartels Jungle (#2)"],["body","housing.  The city sprawled from San Diego to Santa Barbara, and it lapped against the arid Mojave to the east. Beyond were the suburban homes of laborers and low-echelon executives who had carved brass-knuckled niches for themselves in the medium-income bracket.  Hunter saw the panoramic view of Sector West for only a split-second before the monorail car screamed down through the layer of gray haze. For thirty minutes the car shot across the minimum-housing area, stopping from time to time at high-platformed stations.  In the industrial district the car emptied rapidly. Only Hunter and his faded seat companion got out at the turnaround terminal and took the slideway to center-city. In the metro-entry at the top of the stairs they went through a security check station manned by six blaster-armed police guards.  Half of the guards wore the insignia of Consolidated Solar Industries and half of United Research, the two titan cartels which were locked in deadly battle for the empire beyond the stars.  The government played it safe, Hunter thought with bitterness, using an equal number of police from each organization. On Earth the pacific balance of commercial power was never disturbed--not, at least, on the surface. The two imperial giants lived side by side in a tactful display of peace.  On the frontier the real conflict raged, fought with all the weapons of treachery and an arsenal of highly refined atomic weapons--the blaster which could tear a man into component elements, and the L-bombs that were capable of turning a young sun into a nova.  The woman passed through the security check with no trouble. The men knew her and made only a perfunctory examination of her cards. But Hunter again had difficulty because of the blaster in his bag. His registered permit carried no weight with the guards. It was not their duty to execute existing law, but to protect their private employers.  However, the Consolidated insignia on Hunter's jacket made the three Consolidated guards ready to honor his permit. Eventually they persuaded the opposition to pass Hunter into the city, on the ground that the captain's zero-zero adjustment index indicated that it was safe for him to carry arms.  When Hunter went through the probe, he found the woman waiting for him. During the half-hour ride from the spaceport, he had tried twice to start a conversation with her, and failed. Now, abruptly, her face was animated with interest. She put her arm through his and walked with him to the lift shaft.  \"So you got away with it, Captain.\" Since it was long-standing fashion, she had trained her voice to sound low-pitched and husky. \"I mean, bringing a blaster into center-city.\"  \"Why all this fuss about a gun?\" Hunter asked.  \"It's a new government regulation,\" she told him.  \"The government doesn't make the law,\" he reminded her. \"The cartels do.\"  \"The last fiscal mental health report showed the percentage of maladjusted--\" She laughed throatily. \"I wish we'd use words honestly! The survey showed the _lunatic_ percentage is still increasing. The cartels are using that report as an excuse to keep the people unarmed.\"  Hunter was regarding her steadily. \"Why?\" he asked.  \"We're not as content with our world as we're supposed to be,\" she said. \"Eric Young can't keep all of us in line forever. Captain, we could use your blaster. It's next to impossible to get one these days. I could make it worth your while--\"  \"It's registered to me,\" Hunter pointed out.  \"I'll change the serial,\" was her instant reply. \"Your name wouldn't be involved.\"  \"No, I want to keep it.\"  \"To use yourself?\"  \"Don't talk nonsense,\" he said. \"This isn't the frontier.\"  He made the denial vehemently, but deep in his mind he had an uncertain feeling that her guess was right. Earth was not the battle-ground, but it had spawned the conflict. The appearance of peace was a sham. Here the battle was fought with more subtlety, but the objective remained the same.  If Ann Saymer had somehow been caught in the no-man's-land between the two cartels--It was the first time that thought had occurred to Hunter, and it filled him with a dread foreboding.  The woman sensed his feeling. He saw a smile on her curving lips. She said softly, \"So even a spaceman sometimes has his doubts.\"  \"I left the service this morning,\" he said. Suddenly he was telling her all about himself and Ann. It was unwise, perhaps even dangerous. But he had to unburden himself to someone or run the risk of losing his emotional control.  \"So now you've lost this--this ambitious woman of yours,\" she said when he had finished.  \"No,\" he protested. \"I won't let myself believe that. Once I did--\"  \"As well as her interesting invention--the Exorciser,\" she went on relentlessly. \"Have you ever wondered, Captain Hunter, what might happen if the platinum grid was _not_ removed from a patient's brain?\"  \"No, but I suppose--I suppose he'd remain in control of the operator of the transmitter.\"  She nodded. \"He'd become a perfectly adjusted specimen with a zero-zero index, but--he'd also become a human robot with no will of his own.\"  \"But Ann wouldn't--\"  \"Not Ann, Captain. Not the girl you've waited so long to marry. All she wants is a clinic of her own so that she can help the maladjusted. But don't forget--she holds a _priceless_ patent. Keep your blaster, my friend. I've an idea you may need it.\"  He gripped her wrist. \"You know something about this?\"  \"I know the world we live in--nothing more.\"  \"But you're guessing--\"  \"Later, Captain, after you start putting some facts together on your own.\" She pulled away from him. \"If you want to find me again--and I think you will--look for me in Number thirty-four on the amusement level. Ask for Dawn.\"  Suddenly, for no reason that he could explain, he had for her a great sympathy. She was no ordinary woman. Her discernment was extraordinary, and she possessed, in addition, a strangely elusive charm.  They rode the lift as it moved up through the city level in its transparent, fairy-world shaft. Dawn got out first, at the mid-city walk-way where the cheapest shops and the gaudiest entertainment houses were crammed together. Dazzling in the glare of colored lights, the mid-city never slept. It was always thronged. It was the only area of the heartland--except for the top level casinos--open to every citizen without restriction.  On the levels immediately above it were the specialty shops, dealing in luxuries for the suburbanites who had fought, schemed and bribed their way out of the minimum housing. Higher still was the sector given over to the less expensive commercial hotels.  The upper levels were occupied by cartel executive offices and at the top, high enough to escape the smog and feel the warmth of the sun, were the fabulous casino resorts, the mansions built by the family dynasts who controlled the cartels, and the modest, limestone building housing the mockery which passed as government.   IV  Captain Hunter left the lift at Level Nineteen. An automatic entry probe accepted his blue-tinted executive card, and he walked the short distance to the hotel which specialized in catering to spacemen. It was traditionally neutral ground, where the mercenaries of Consolidated or United Research met as friends, although a week before they might have been firing radiation fire at each other in the outer reaches of space. The frontier conflict was a business to the spaceman. Hunter was too well-adjusted to become emotionally involved in it himself.  The spacemen called their hotel the Roost, a contraction lifted from the public micropic code. The full name was the _Roosevelt_, lettered on the entry. The hotel was popularly supposed to have been built close to the site of a twentieth century Los Angeles hotel of the same name, destroyed in the last convulsive war that had shattered the earth.  By micropic Hunter had made his customary reservation. His room was high in an upper floor overlooking Level Twenty-three. Through the visipanel he could see the walk-ways thronged by the various classifications of executives who worked in the central offices of the cartels--lawyers, engineers, administrators, directors, astrogeographers, designers, statisticians, researchers.  Somewhere in the crowd, perhaps, were the two men who ruled the cartels and directed the struggle for the Galactic empire. Glenn Farren of Consolidated Solar and Werner von Rausch of United Researchers. Max Hunter had never seen either of the men or any of their dynastic families. He knew little about them. Their pictures were never published.  Yet Farren and Von Rausch held in their hands more despotic power, more real wealth and military might, than any ancient Khan or Caesar had ever dreamed of.  Did they now want Ann Saymer's patent? The answer, Hunter realized, was obvious. With Ann's Exorciser, they could enslave the centers of civilization as they had enslaved the frontier. In itself that was a minor factor, already accomplished by man's acceptance of the jungle ethics of the cartels. Far more important, if one of the cartels controlled the patent, it had a weapon that would ultimately destroy the other.  With trembling fingers, Hunter took Ann's last micropic from his bag and rolled the tiny film into a wall-scanner. He could have recited it by heart; yet, by reading it again, he somehow expected to extract a new meaning. The code he and Ann used, contrived for economy rather than secrecy, was merely a telescoping of common phrases into single word symbols.  IHTKN, at the beginning, was easily interpreted as \"I have taken,\" and COMJB became \"commission-job.\" The micropic transmission monopoly arbitrarily limited all code words to five letters or less, counting additional letters as whole words. But because of the simplicity of the technique, some of Ann's symbols were open to a number of interpretations.  Hunter was sure of one thing. Ann had not specifically named the clinic where she was working. She said she"]]]
