In compiling this work, I have tried  [Page xii.]  to remove the pioneer signs and ensigns of war, and to [1] retain at this date the privileged armaments of peace.  With armor on, I continue the march, command and countermand; meantime interluding with loving thought this afterpiece of battle. Supported, cheered, I take my [5] pen and pruning-hook, to “learn war no more,” and with strong wing to lift my readers above the smoke of conflict into light and liberty.  Mary Baker Eddy  CONCORD, N.H. January, 1897      CHAPTER I. INTRODUCTORY.     Prospectus.   [Page 1.]  The ancient Greek looked longingly for the Olym- [1] piad. The Chaldee watched the appearing of a star; to him, no higher destiny dawned on the dome of being than that foreshadowed by signs in the heav- [5] ens. The meek Nazarene, the scoffed of all scoffers, said, “Ye can discern the face of the sky; but can ye not discern the signs of the times?”—for he forefelt and foresaw the ordeal of a perfect Christianity, hated by sinners. [10]  To kindle all minds with a gleam of gratitude, the new idea that comes welling up from infinite Truth needs to be understood. The seer of this age should be a sage.  Humility is the stepping-stone to a higher recognition [15] of Deity. The mounting sense gathers fresh forms and strange fire from the ashes of dissolving self, and drops the world. Meekness heightens immortal attributes only by removing the dust that dims them. Goodness reveals another scene and another self seemingly rolled [20] up in shades, but brought to light by the evolutions of  [Page 2.]  advancing thought, whereby we discern the power of [1] Truth and Love to heal the sick.  Pride is ignorance; those assume most who have the least wisdom or experience; and they steal from their neighbor, because they have so little of their own. [5]  The signs of these times portend a long and strong determination of mankind to cleave to the world, the flesh, and evil, causing great obscuration of Spirit. When we remember that God is just, and admit the total depravity of mortals, _alias_ mortal mind,—and that [10] this Adam legacy must first be seen, and then must be subdued and recompensed by justice, the eternal attri- bute of Truth,—the outlook demands labor, and the laborers seem few. To-day we behold but the first faint view of a more spiritual Christianity, that embraces [15] a deeper and broader philosophy and a more rational and divine healing. The time approaches when divine Life, Truth, and Love will be found alone the remedy for sin, sickness, and death; when God, man’s saving Principle, and Christ, the spiritual idea of God, will be revealed. [20]  Man’s probation after death is the necessity of his immortality; for good dies not and evil is self-destruc- tive, therefore evil must be mortal and self-destroyed. If man should not progress after death, but should re- main in error, he would be inevitably self-annihilated. [25] Those upon whom “the second death hath no power” are those who progress here and hereafter out of evil, their mortal element, and into good that is immortal; thus laying off the material beliefs that war against Spirit, and putting on the spiritual elements in divine [30] Science.  While we entertain decided views as to the best method  [Page 3.]  for elevating the race physically, morally, and spiritually, [1] and shall express these views as duty demands, we shall claim no especial gift from our divine origin, no supernatural power. If we regard good as more natural than evil, and spiritual understanding—the true knowl- [5] edge of God—as imparting the only power to heal the sick and the sinner, we shall demonstrate in our lives the power of Truth and Love.  The lessons we learn in divine Science are applica- ble to all the needs of man. Jesus taught them for this [10] very purpose; and his demonstration hath taught us that “through his stripes”—his life-experience—and divine Science, brought to the understanding through Christ, the Spirit-revelator, is man healed and saved. No opinions of mortals nor human hypotheses enter this [15] line of thought or action. Drugs, inert matter, never are needed to aid spiritual power. Hygiene, manipulation, and mesmerism are not Mind’s medicine. The Principle of all cure is God, unerring and immortal Mind. We have learned that the erring or mortal thought holds [20] in itself all sin, sickness, and death, and imparts these states to the body; while the supreme and perfect Mind, as seen in the truth of being, antidotes and destroys these material elements of sin and death.  Because God is supreme and omnipotent, _materia_ [25] _medica_, hygiene, and animal magnetism are impotent; and their only supposed efficacy is in apparently delud- ing reason, denying revelation, and dethroning Deity. The tendency of mental healing is to uplift mankind; but this method perverted, is “Satan let loose.” Hence the [30] deep demand for the Science of psychology to meet sin, and uncover it; thus to annihilate hallucination.  [Page 4.]  Thought imbued with purity, Truth, and Love, in- [1] structed in the Science of metaphysical healing, is the most potent and desirable remedial agent on the earth. At this period there is a marked tendency of mortal mind to plant mental healing on the basis of hypnotism, [5] calling this method “mental science.” All _Science_ is _Christian_ Science; the Science of the Mind that is God, and of the universe as His idea, and their relation to each other. Its only power to heal is its power to do good, not evil.     A Timely Issue.   At this date, 1883, a newspaper edited and published by the Christian Scientists has become a necessity. Many questions important to be disposed of come to the Col- lege and to the practising students, yet but little time [15] has been devoted to their answer. Further enlight- enment is necessary for the age, and a periodical de- voted to this work seems alone adequate to meet the requirement. Much interest is awakened and expressed on the subject of metaphysical healing, but in many [20] minds it is confounded with isms, and even infidelity, so that its religious specialty and the vastness of its worth are not understood.  It is often said, “You must have a very strong will- power to heal,” or, “It must require a great deal of faith [25] to make your demonstrations.” When it is answered that there is no will-power required, and that something more than faith is necessary, we meet with an expression of incredulity. It is not alone the mission of Christian Science to heal the sick, but to destroy sin in mortal [30]  [Page 5.]  thought. This work well done will elevate and purify [1] the race. It cannot fail to do this if we devote our best energies to the work.  Science reveals man as spiritual, harmonious, and eter- nal. This should be understood. Our College should [5] be crowded with students who are willing to consecrate themselves to this Christian work. Mothers should be able to produce perfect health and perfect morals in their children—and ministers, to heal the sick—by study- ing this scientific method of practising Christianity. [10] Many say, “I should like to study, but have not suffi- cient faith that I have the power to heal.” The healing power is Truth and Love, and these do not fail in the greatest emergencies.  _Materia medica_ says, “I can do no more. I have [15] done all that can be done. There is nothing to build upon. There is no longer any reason for hope.” Then metaphysics comes in, armed with the power of Spirit, not matter, takes up the case hopefully and builds on the stone that the builders have rejected, and is suc- [20] cessful.  Metaphysical therapeutics can seem a miracle and a mystery to those only who do not understand the grand reality that Mind controls the body. They acknowledge an erring or mortal mind, but believe it to be brain mat- [25] ter. That man is the idea of infinite Mind, always perfect in God, in Truth, Life, and Love, is something not easily accepted, weighed down as is mortal thought with mate- rial beliefs. That which never existed, can seem solid substance to this thought. It is much easier for people [30] to believe that the body affects the mind, than that the mind affects the body.  [Page 6.]  We hear from the pulpits that sickness is sent as a [1] discipline to bring man nearer to God,—even though sickness often leaves mortals but little time free from complaints and fretfulness, and Jesus cast out disease as evil. [5]  The most of our Christian Science practitioners have plenty to do, and many more are needed for the ad- vancement of the age. At present the majority of the acute cases are given to the M. D.’s, and only those cases that are pronounced incurable are passed over to [10] the Scientist. The healing of such cases should cer- tainly prove to all minds the power of metaphysics over physics; and it surely does, to many thinkers, as the rapid growth of the work shows. At no distant day, Christian healing will rank far in advance of allopathy [15] and homœopathy; for Truth must ultimately succeed where error fails.  Mind governs all. That we exist in God, perfect, there is no doubt, for the conceptions of Life, Truth, and Love must be perfect; and with that basic truth we con- [20] quer sickness, sin, and death. Frequently it requires time to overcome the patient’s faith in drugs and mate- rial hygiene; but when once convinced of the uselessness of such material methods, the gain is rapid.  It is a noticeable fact, that in families where laws [25] of health are strictly enforced, great caution is observed in regard to diet, and the conversation chiefly confined to the ailments of the body, there is the most sickness. Take a large family of children where the mother has all that she can attend to in keeping them clothed and fed, and health is generally the rule; whereas, in small families of one or two children, sickness is by no means  [Page 7.]"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31427"],["title","Miscellaneous Writings, 1883-1896 (#2)"],["body","exception. These children must not be allowed to [1] eat certain food, nor to breathe the cold air, because there is danger in it; when they perspire, they must be loaded down with coverings until their bodies become dry,—and the mother of one child is often busier than [5] the mother of eight.  Great charity and humility is necessary in this work of healing. The loving patience of Jesus, we must strive to emulate. “Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself” has daily to be exemplified; and, although [10] skepticism and incredulity prevail in places where one would least expect it, it harms not; for if serving Christ, Truth, of what can mortal opinion avail? Cast not your pearls before swine; but if you cannot bring peace to all, you can to many, if faithful laborers in His [15] vineyard.  Looking over the newspapers of the day, one naturally reflects that it is dangerous to live, so loaded with disease seems the very air. These descriptions carry fears to many minds, to be depicted in some future time upon [20] the body. A periodical of our own will counteract to some extent this public nuisance; for through our paper, at the price at which we shall issue it, we shall be able to reach many homes with healing, purifying thought. A great work already has been done, and a greater work [25] yet remains to be done. Oftentimes we are denied the results of our labors because people do not understand the nature and power of metaphysics, and they think that health and strength would have returned natu- rally without any assistance. This is not so much from [30] a lack of justice, as it is that the _mens populi_ is not suffi- ciently enlightened on this great subject. More thought  [Page 8.]  is given to material illusions than to spiritual facts. If [1] we can aid in abating suffering and diminishing sin, we shall have accomplished much; but if we can bring to the general thought this great fact that drugs do not, cannot, produce health and harmony, since “in Him [5] [Mind] we live, and move, and have our being,” we shall have done more.”     Love Your Enemies.   Who is thine enemy that thou shouldst love him? Is it a creature or a thing outside thine own creation? [10]  Can you see an enemy, except you first formulate this enemy and then look upon the object of your own conception? What is it that harms you? Can height, or depth, or any other creature separate you from the Love that is omnipresent good,—that blesses infinitely [15] one and all?  Simply count your enemy to be that which defiles, defaces, and dethrones the Christ-image that you should reflect. Whatever purifies, sanctifies, and consecrates human life, is not an enemy, however much we suffer in [20] the process. Shakespeare writes: “Sweet are the uses of adversity.” Jesus said: “Blessed are ye, when men shall revile you, and persecute you, and shall say all manner of evil against you _falsely_, for my sake; ... for so persecuted they the prophets which were before [25] you.”  The Hebrew law with its “Thou shalt not,” its de- mand and sentence, can only be fulfilled through the gospel’s benediction. Then, “Blessed are ye,” inso-  [Page 9.]  much as the consciousness of good, grace, and peace, [1] comes through affliction rightly understood, as sanctified by the purification it brings to the flesh,—to pride, self- ignorance, self-will, self-love, self-justification. Sweet, indeed, are these uses of His rod! Well is it that the [5] Shepherd of Israel passes all His flock under His rod into His fold; thereby numbering them, and giving them refuge at last from the elements of earth.  “Love thine enemies” is identical with “Thou hast no enemies.” Wherein is this conclusion relative to [10] those who have hated thee without a cause? Simply, in that those unfortunate individuals are virtually thy best friends. Primarily and ultimately, they are doing thee good far beyond the present sense which thou canst entertain of good. [15]  Whom we call friends seem to sweeten life’s cup and to fill it with the nectar of the gods. We lift this cup to our lips; but it slips from our grasp, to fall in frag- ments before our eyes. Perchance, having tasted its tempting wine, we become intoxicated; become lethar- [20] gic, dreamy objects of self-satisfaction; else, the con- tents of this cup of selfish human enjoyment having lost its flavor, we voluntarily set it aside as tasteless and unworthy of human aims.  And wherefore our failure longer to relish this fleet- [25] ing sense, with its delicious forms of friendship, wherewith mortals become educated to gratification in personal pleasure and trained in treacherous peace? Because it is the great and only danger in the path that winds upward. A false sense of what consti- [30] tutes happiness is more disastrous to human progress than all that an enemy or enmity can obtrude upon  [Page 10.]  the mind or engraft upon its purposes and achievements [1] wherewith to obstruct life’s joys and enhance its sor- rows.  We have no enemies. Whatever envy, hatred, revenge —the most remorseless motives that govern mortal mind [5] —whatever these try to do, shall “work together for good to them that love God.”  Why?  Because He has called His own, armed them, equipped them, and furnished them defenses impregnable. Their [10] God will not let them be lost; and if they fall they shall rise again, stronger than before the stumble. The good cannot lose their God, their help in times of trouble. If they mistake the divine command, they will recover it, countermand their order, retrace their steps, and [15] reinstate His orders, more assured to press on safely. The best lesson of their lives is gained by crossing swords with temptation, with fear and the besetments of evil; insomuch as they thereby have tried their strength and proven it; insomuch as they have found [20] their strength made perfect in weakness, and their fear is self-immolated.  This destruction is a moral chemicalization, wherein old things pass away and all things become new. The worldly or material tendencies of human affections and [25] pursuits are thus annihilated; and this is the advent of spiritualization. Heaven comes down to earth, and mortals learn at last the lesson, “I have no enemies.”  Even in belief you have but one (that, not in reality), and this one enemy is yourself—your erroneous belief [30] that you have enemies; that evil is real; that aught but good exists in Science. Soon or late, your enemy will  [Page 11.]  wake from his delusion to suffer for his evil intent; to [1] find that, though thwarted, its punishment is tenfold.  Love is the fulfilling of the law: it is grace, mercy, and justice. I used to think it sufficiently just to abide by our State statutes; that if a man should aim a ball at [5] my heart, and I by firing first could kill him and save my own life, that this was right. I thought, also, that if I taught indigent students gratuitously, afterwards assisting them pecuniarily, and did not cease teachi ing the wayward ones at close of the class term, but [10] followed them with precept upon precept; that if my instructions had healed them and shown them the sure way of salvation,—I had done my whole duty to students.  Love metes not out human justice, but divine mercy. If one’s life were attacked, and one could save it only [15] in accordance with common law, by taking another’s, would one sooner give up his own? We must love our enemies in all the manifestations wherein and whereby we love our friends; must even try not to expose their faults, but to do them good whenever opportunity [20] occurs. To mete out human justice to those who per- secure and despitefully use one, is not leaving all retribu- tion to God and returning blessing for cursing. If special opportunity for doing good to one’s enemies occur not, one can include them in his general effort to benefit the [25] race. Because I can do much general good to such as hate me, I do it with earnest, special care—since they permit me no other way, though with tears have I striven for it. When smitten on one cheek, I have turned the other: I have but two to present. [30]  I would enjoy taking by the hand all who love me not, and saying to them, “_I_ love _you_, and would not know-  [Page 12.]  ingly harm you.” _Because_ I thus feel, I say to others: [1] Hate no one; for hatred is a plague-spot that spreads its virus and kills at last. If indulged, it masters us; brings suffering upon suffering to its possessor, through- out time and beyond the grave. If you have been badly [5] wronged, forgive and forget: God will recompense this wrong, and punish, more severely than you could, him who has striven to injure you. Never return evil for evil; and, above all, do not fancy that you have been wronged when you have not been. [10]  The present is ours; the future, big with events. Every man and woman should be to-day a law to him- self, herself,—a law of loyalty to Jesus’ Sermon on the Mount. The means for sinning unseen and unpunished have so increased that, unless one be watchful and stead- [15] fast in Love, one’s temptations to sin are increased a hundredfold. Mortal mind at this period mutely works in the interest of both good and evil in a manner least understood; hence the need of watching, and the danger of yielding to temptation from causes that at former [20] periods in human history were not existent. The action and effects of this so-called human mind in its silent argu- ments, are yet to be uncovered and summarily dealt with by divine justice.  In Christian Science, the law of Love rejoices the heart; [25] and Love is Life and Truth. Whatever manifests aught else in its effects upon mankind, demonstrably is not Love. We should measure our love for God by our love for man; and our sense of Science will be measured by our obedience to God,—fulfilling the law of Love, doing good to all; [30] imparting, so far as we reflect them, Truth, Life, and Love to all within the radius of our"]]]
