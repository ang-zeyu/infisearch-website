The sweet odor of the flowers tucked in the open neck of her already grimy white blouse suddenly sickened her and she flung them into the mud.  \"We won't be going back to Earth for a long time!\" she called. Gathering up the purple-stained papers, she came toward the others, little puffs of mist rising at each step. \"We like it here. Lovely country.\"  How could she think to please even the savage she fancied him to be by such an inanity, Jrann-Pttt wondered. No one could possibly like that fetid swamp. Or was it not so much that she was trying to please him as convince herself? Was there some reason the terrestrials had for needing to like Venus. It hovered on the edge of the women's minds. If only it would emerge completely, he could pick it up, but it lurked in the shadows of their subconscious, tantalizing him.  \"I'd like to know when we're going to start putting up the shelters,\" Mrs. Bernardi said, pushing a streak of fog-yellow hair out of her eyes. \"I can't stand being cooped up for another night on that ship.\"  \"You're planning to put up shelters--to live outside of the ship?\" This would seem to confirm his darkest suspicions. Even a temporary settlement would leave them too open to visitation from the commandant. What his attitude toward the aliens might be, Jrann-Pttt didn't know. He might consider them as specimens, as enemies or as potential allies. What his attitude toward Jrann-Pttt and his companion would be, however, the saurian knew only too well. Had they reported the lieutenant's demise immediately, it was possible the commandant might have been brought to believe it was an accident. Now he would unquestionably think Jrann-Pttt had killed Merglyt-Ruuu on purpose--which was not true; how was Jrann-Pttt to know that the mud into which he'd knocked the lieutenant was quicksand?  \"Anything against putting up shelters?\" Captain Greenfield growled from his perch.  \"Monster!\" the mosquito-bat shrieked at the cat. \"Monster! Monster!\"         *       *       *       *       *  There was a painfully embarrassed silence.  \"The creature is not intelligent,\" Jrann-Pttt explained, smiling. \"It merely has vocal apparatus that can reproduce a frequently heard word, like--you have a bird, I believe, a--\" he searched their minds for the word--\"a parrot.\"  \"Monster!\" the mosquito-bat continued. \"Monster! Monster!\"  \"Shut up or I'll wring your neck!\" the captain snarled. The mosquito-bat obeyed sullenly, apparently recognizing the threat in his tone.  But the concept of \"monster\" hung heavily in the air between the terrestrials and the lizard-man. _They should not feel so bad about it_, he thought, _for they are the monsters themselves. But that would never occur to them and I can hardly reassure them by saying...._  \"Don't worry,\" Professor Bernardi said smoothly. \"To him, it's we who are the monsters.\"  A sudden gust of wind nearly whipped the tablecloth out of Jrann-Pttt's hands. He fought with it for a moment, glad of something tangible to contend with. \"About the shelters,\" he said. \"They might not stand up against a storm.\"  \"So this is monsoon country,\" Bernardi observed thoughtfully. \"Do you know when the storms usually come, Jrann-Pttt?\" The other shook his head. \"Peculiar. There usually is a season for that sort of thing.\"  \"I ... come from another part of the planet.\"  \"Storms here are bad, eh?\" the captain commented, swinging himself down easily. \"Frankly, that worries me. Ship's resting on mud as far as I can see, and if there's one thing I do know something about, it's mud. If it got any wetter, the ship might sink.\"  \"Maybe we should leave,\" Mrs. Bernardi suggested. \"Go to another part of the planet where it's drier, or--\" she tried not to show the sudden surge of hope--\"leave for home and come back after the rainy season.\"  There was a sudden silence, and Jrann-Pttt found himself able to pick up the answers to some of his questions from the alien minds. His worst fears were confirmed. Plan A was out. But something could still be done with these creatures.  \"Doesn't she know?\" the captain demanded accusingly. \"You brought her here without telling her?\"  Bernardi spread his hands wide in a futile gesture. \"She should know; I've told her repeatedly. She just doesn't understand ... or doesn't want to.\"  \"I know they'll forgive us,\" Mrs. Bernardi said stubbornly. \"We--you--haven't done anything really wrong, so how could they do anything terrible to us? After all, didn't they refuse you the funds because they said you couldn't--\"  \"Shhh, Louisa,\" her husband commanded.  Jrann-Pttt smiled to himself.  --\"do it,\" she went on. \"And you did. So they were wrong and they'll have to forgive us.\"  \"Tcha!\" Miss Anspacher said. \"Since when was there any fairness in justice?\"  \"On the other hand,\" Mrs. Bernardi continued, \"we have no idea of how dangerous the storms here could be.\"  \"Very dangerous,\" Jrann-Pttt said.  \"For you, perhaps,\" the captain retorted. \"Maybe not for us.\"  \"Now that's silly,\" Miss Anspacher said. \"You can see that Jrann-Pttt is much more--\" she blushed--\"sturdily built than we are.\"  \"I don't mean that we could face it without protection,\" the captain replied angrily. \"Naturally I mean that our superior technology could cope with the effects of any storm.\"  \"Well, Captain, we'll have to put that superior technology to use at once,\" the professor told him. \"You'd better start blasting that rock.\"  Laden with equipment and malevolent thoughts, the captain trudged off into the murky jungle. The others would not even offer to help. Confounded scientists; they certainly took his status as captain seriously. He wished, for a disloyal moment, that he had stayed on Earth. The quiet routine of a test pilot had prepared him for nothing like this. Were Miss Anspacher and adventure worth it? At the moment, he thought not. But he was on Venus and it was too late to change his mind.  Jrann-Pttt followed him into the jungle, keeping some distance behind, for he had good reason to suspect that Greenfield would take his warm interest in terrestrial technology for plain spying. Or, worse yet, he might try to press the lizard-man into service; Jrann-Pttt felt he had demeaned himself quite enough already.  \"Have you noticed,\" Miss Anspacher asked, pushing the mass of damp brown hair off her neck as she came alongside him, \"how the--the smell--\" _a scientist does not mince words_--\"of the swamp has grown stronger?\"  Jrann-Pttt halted. He had a good idea of what the captain's reactions to the sight of himself and Miss Anspacher arriving hand-in-hand would be. \"Yes, it is getting rather overpowering. Perhaps, for a lady of your delicate sensibilities, it would be best to--\"  \"I can stand a bad smell just as well as a male--any male!\"  \"Perhaps even better,\" Jrann-Pttt said, \"for I was on the verge of turning back myself.\"  \"Oh,\" she said, appeased. \"Well, in that case, I'll go back with you ... how quiet everything is!\"  He had not noticed. For him, it would never be quiet because of the stream of jangled thoughts constantly pouring into the back of his mind from everything sentient that surrounded him.  For a moment, he wondered what it would be like to be non-telepathic like the terrestrials, to have peace from the clamor of confused impressions, emotions and ideas that persistently beat at his mind. But that would be wondering how it was to be deaf to avoid discord, or blind to shut out ugliness.  \"The lull before the storm, I suppose,\" she said brightly. _Now is his opportunity to kiss me--only perhaps they don't have kissing in his society. His mouth does seem to be the wrong shape. And if I kissed him, it might violate a taboo._  During their short absence, the citrine clouds that closed off the sky had changed to a sinister umber. It was now almost as dusky in the clearing as in the jungle itself, when Jrann-Pttt and Miss Anspacher returned and joined the others.  Professor Bernardi stood looking up with sharp gray eyes at a sky he could not see. \"I hope Greenfield can finish the blasting more quickly than he estimated,\" he muttered.  \"Will we hear the noise way out here, Carl?\" his wife worried nervously.  \"Only two kilometers away? Of course we'll hear it. I do wish you wouldn't always be asking such stupid questions.\"  She shivered. \"Well, I hope they get it over with right away. If we just have to sit here waiting and waiting and waiting, I'll go mad. I know I will.\"  \"You should try to keep your nerves in check, Louisa,\" Miss Anspacher snapped. _Silly little fool._  \"At least I can control my glands!\" Mrs. Bernardi flared back. _Sex-starved spinster._  \"I shall make some tea, ladies,\" Jrann-Pttt interposed. \"I'm sure we will all feel the better for it.\"  Mrs. Bernardi smiled at him feebly. \"You're such a comfort, Pitt. I don't know why you of all creatures should be the one to remind me of home.\"  \"Home,\" remarked Mortland, emerging from the airlock, \"is where the heart is. Did I hear someone say 'tea'?\"         *       *       *       *       *  As Jrann-Pttt hung the kettle over the fire, suddenly the air erupted in stunning violence of sound. The ground undulated under their feet and water slopped out of the kettle, almost putting out the fire that rose high to claw at it. Rivulets of thick, muddy liquid welled out of the ground and drabbled their feet. The women turned pale. Algol gave a faint cry and hid under Mrs. Bernardi's skirts, trembling, while the mosquito-bat tried to lift Mortland's toupee and hide in his hair. The ship itself quivered and seemed to jump slightly in the air, then returned to its resting place.  All was quiet again, quieter than it had been before. Mortland anxiously gnawed his light mustache. \"Better hurry with that tea, there's a good fellow. I'm violently allergic to loud noises.\"  \"They'll probably continue all day,\" the professor said with almost malevolent cheerfulness, \"so you"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3169"],["title","The Pursuit of the House-Boat (#1)"],["body","er-skating rink or a bicycle academy in Ohio, or for some other purpose for which neither he nor it was designed.”                 [Picture: Dr. Johnson’s point is well taken]  “Dr. Johnson’s point is well taken,” said a stranger who had been sitting upon the string-piece of the pier, quietly, but with very evident interest, listening to the discussion.  He was a tall and excessively slender shade, “like a spirt of steam out of a teapot,” as Johnson put it afterwards, so slight he seemed.  “I have not the honor of being a member of this association,” the stranger continued, “but, like all well-ordered shades, I aspire to the distinction, and I hold myself and my talents at the disposal of this club.  I fancy it will not take us long to establish our initial point, which is that the gross person who has so foully appropriated your property to his own base uses does not contemplate removing it from its keel and placing it somewhere inland.  All the evidence in hand points to a radically different conclusion, which is my sole reason for doubting the value of that conclusion.  Captain Kidd is a seafarer by instinct, not a landsman.  The House-boat is not a house, but a boat; therefore the place to look for it is not, as Dr. Johnson so well says, in the Sahara Desert, or on the Alps, or in the State of Ohio, but upon the high sea, or upon the waterfront of some one of the world’s great cities.”  “And what, then, would be your plan?” asked Sir Walter, impressed by the stranger’s manner as well as by the very manifest reason in all that he had said.  “The chartering of a suitable vessel, fully armed and equipped for the purpose of pursuit.  Ascertain whither the House-boat has sailed, for what port, and start at once.  Have you a model of the House-boat within reach?” returned the stranger.  “I think not; we have the architect’s plans, however,” said the chairman.  “We had, Mr. Chairman,” said Demosthenes, who was secretary of the House Committee, rising, “but they are gone with the House-boat itself.  They were kept in the safe in the hold.”  A look of annoyance came into the face of the stranger.  “That’s too bad,” he said.  “It was a most important part of my plan that we should know about how fast the House-boat was.”  “Humph!” ejaculated Socrates, with ill-concealed sarcasm.  “If you’ll take Xanthippe’s word for it, the House-boat was the fastest yacht afloat.”  “I refer to the matter of speed in sailing,” returned the stranger, quietly.  “The question of its ethical speed has nothing to do with it.”  “The designer of the craft is here,” said Sir Walter, fixing his eyes upon Sir Christopher Wren.  “It is possible that he may be of assistance in settling that point.”           [Picture: What has all this got to do with the question]  “What has all this got to do with the question, anyhow, Mr. Chairman?” asked Solomon, rising impatiently and addressing Sir Walter.  “We aren’t preparing for a yacht-race, that I know of.  Nobody’s after a cup, or a championship of any kind.  What we do want is to get our wives back.  The Captain hasn’t taken more than half of mine along with him, but I am interested none the less.  The Queen of Sheba is on board, and I am somewhat interested in her fate.  So I ask you what earthly or unearthly use there is in discussing this question of speed in the House-boat.  It strikes me as a woful waste of time, and rather unprecedented too, that we should suspend all rules and listen to the talk of an entire stranger.”  “I do not venture to doubt the wisdom of Solomon,” said Johnson, dryly, “but I must say that the gentleman’s remarks rather interest me.”  “Of course they do,” ejaculated Solomon.  “He agreed with you.  That ought to make him interesting to everybody.  Freaks usually are.”  “That is not the reason at all,” retorted Dr. Johnson.  “Cold water agrees with me, but it doesn’t interest me.  What I do think, however, is that our unknown friend seems to have a grasp on the situation by which we are confronted, and he’s going at the matter in hand in a very comprehensive fashion.  I move, therefore, that Solomon be laid on the table, and that the privileges of the—ah—of the wharf be extended indefinitely to our friend on the string-piece.”  The motion, having been seconded, was duly carried, and the stranger resumed.  “I will explain for the benefit of his Majesty King Solomon, whose wisdom I have always admired, and whose endurance as the husband of three hundred wives has filled me with wonder,” he said, “that before starting in pursuit of the stolen vessel we must select a craft of some sort for the purpose, and that in selecting the pursuer it is quite essential that we should choose a vessel of greater speed than the one we desire to overtake.  It would hardly be proper, I think, if the House-boat can sail four knots an hour to attempt to overhaul her with a launch, or other nautical craft, with a maximum speed of two knots an hour.”  “Hear! hear!” ejaculated Cæsar.  “That is my reason, your Majesty, for inquiring as to the speed of your late club-house,” said the stranger, bowing courteously to Solomon. “Now, if Sir Christopher Wren can give me her measurements, we can very soon determine at about what rate she is leaving us behind under favorable circumstances.”  “’Tisn’t necessary for Sir Christopher to do anything of the sort,” said Noah, rising and manifesting somewhat more heat than the occasion seemed to require.  “As long as we are discussing the question I will take the liberty of stating what I have never mentioned before, that the designer of the House-boat merely appropriated the lines of the Ark.  Shem, Ham, and Japhet will bear testimony to the truth of that statement.”  “There can be no quarrel on that score, Mr. Chairman,” assented Sir Christopher, with cutting frigidity.  “I am perfectly willing to admit that practically the two vessels were built on the same lines, but with modifications which would enable my boat to sail twenty miles to windward and back in six days’ less time than it would have taken the Ark to cover the same distance, and it could have taken all the wash of the excursion steamers into the bargain.”  “Bosh!” ejaculated Noah, angrily.  “Strip your old tub down to a flying balloon-jib and a marline-spike, and ballast the Ark with elephants until every inch of her reeked with ivory and peanuts, and she’d outfoot you on every leg, in a cyclone or a zephyr.  Give me the Ark and a breeze, and your House-boat wouldn’t be within hailing distance of her five minutes after the start if she had 40,000 square yards of canvas spread before a gale.”  “This discussion is waxing very unprofitable,” observed Confucius.  “If these gentlemen cannot be made to confine themselves to the subject that is agitating this body, I move we call in the authorities and have them confined in the bottomless pit.”  “I did not precipitate the quarrel,” said Noah.  “I was merely trying to assist our friend on the string-piece.  I was going to say that as the Ark was probably a hundred times faster than Sir Christopher Wren’s—tub, which he himself says can take care of all the wash of the excursion boats, thereby becoming on his own admission a wash-tub—”  “Order! order!” cried Sir Christopher.  “I was going to say that this wash-tub could be overhauled by a launch or any other craft with a speed of thirty knots a mouth,” continued Noah, ignoring the interruption.  “Took him forty days to get to Mount Ararat!” sneered Sir Christopher.  “Well, your boat would have got there two weeks sooner, I’ll admit,” retorted Noah, “if she’d sprung a leak at the right time.”  “Granting the truth of Noah’s statement,” said Sir Walter, motioning to the angry architect to be quiet—“not that we take any side in the issue between the two gentlemen, but merely for the sake of argument—I wish to ask the stranger who has been good enough to interest himself in our trouble what he proposes to do—how can you establish your course in case a boat were provided?”  “Also vot vill be dher gost, if any?” put in Shylock.  A murmur of disapprobation greeted this remark.  “The cost need not trouble you, sir,” said Sir Walter, indignantly, addressing the stranger; “you will have carte blanche.”  “Den ve are ruint!” cried Shylock, displaying his palms, and showing by that act a select assortment of diamond rings.  “Oh,” laughed the stranger, “that is a simple matter.  Captain Kidd has gone to London.”  “To London!” cried several members at once.  “How do you know that?”  “By this,” said the stranger, holding up the tiny stub end of a cigar.  “Tut-tut!” ejaculated Solomon.  “What child’s play is this!”  “No, your Majesty,” observed the stranger, “it is not child’s play; it is fact.  That cigar end was thrown aside here on the wharf by Captain Kidd just before he stepped on board the House-boat.”  “How do you know that?” demanded Raleigh.  “And granting the truth of the assertion, what does it prove?”  “I will tell you,” said the stranger.  And he at once proceeded as follows.     II THE STRANGER UNRAVELS A MYSTERY AND REVEALS HIMSELF   “I HAVE made a hobby of the study of cigar ends,” said the stranger, as the Associated Shades settled back to hear his account of himself.  “From my earliest youth, when I used surreptitiously to remove the unsmoked ends of my father’s cigars and break them up, and, in hiding, smoke them in an old clay pipe which I had presented to me by an ancient sea-captain of my acquaintance, I have been interested in tobacco in all forms, even including these self-same despised unsmoked ends; for they convey to my mind messages, sentiments, farces, comedies, and tragedies which to your minds would never become manifest through their agency.”  The company drew closer together and formed themselves in a more compact mass about the speaker.  It was evident that they were beginning to feel an unusual interest in this extraordinary person, who had come among them unheralded and unknown.  Even"]]]
