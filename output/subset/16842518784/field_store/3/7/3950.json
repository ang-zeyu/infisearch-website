They did not come in sight, but the main road to Chattanooga did, and then a new trouble suggested itself.  \"I won't never dare haul this load uncovered through camp,\" he said to himself. \"The first gang o' roustabout teamsters that I meet'll take every spoonful of the vittles, and I'd be lucky if I have the horse and wagon left. I must hide it some way. How? That's a puzzler.\"  At length a happy idea occurred to him. He stopped by a cedar thicket, and with his jack-knife cut a big load of cedar boughs, which he piled on until every bit of food was thoroughly concealed. This took much time, and as he was finishing he heard a yell on the hill behind, and saw a squad of rebels riding down toward him. He sprang to the seat, whipped up his horse, and as he reached the main road was rejoiced to see a squad of Union cavalry approaching.  \"Here, old man,\" said the Lieutenant in command; \"who are you, and what are you doing here?\"  \"I'm a nurse in the hospital,\" answered the Deacon unhesitatingly. \"I was sent out here to get some cedar boughs to make beds in the hospital. Say, there's some rebels out there, comin' down the hill. They saw me and tuk after me. You'll find 'em right over the hill.\"  \"That's a pretty slick horse you're driving,\" said the Lieutenant. \"Looks entirely too slick to belong to Chattanooga. It's a much better horse than mine. I've a notion--\"  \"Say, them rebels are just over the hill, I tell you,\" said the Deacon in a fever of apprehension of losing his steed. \"They'll be on top of you in a minute if you don't look out.\"  \"Right over the hill, did you say?\" said the Lieutenant, forgetting for the moment the horse. \"Attention, there, boys. Look out for the rebels. Advance carbines--Forward--trot! I'll come back directly and take another look at that horse.\"  The squad trotted up the hill in the direction the Deacon had pointed, and as he drove off as fast as he could he heard the spatter of exchanging shots.  Late in the evening, as he drove off the pontoon into Chattanooga and turned to the right toward his corn-crib he muttered over to himself:  \"They say that when a man starts down the path of sin and crime the road seems greased for his swift progress. The other day I begun with petty larceny and chicken stealin'. To-day it's bin highway robbery, premeditated murder, horse stealin', grand larceny, and tellin' a deliberate lie. What'll I be doin' this time next week? I must git that old man's horse and buckboard back to him somehow, and pay him for his vittles. But how'm I goin' to do it? The army's terribly demoralizin'. I must git Si back home soon, or I won't be fit to associate with anybody outside the penitentiary. How kin I ever go to the communion table agin?\"    CHAPTER II. THE DEACON ATTEMPTED RESTITUTION  TRIED TO RETURN THE HORSE TO HIS OWNER.  SI AND SHORTY were on the anxious lookout for the Deacon when he arrived, and not a little worried lest something might have befallen him.  Si's weakness made him peevish and fretful, and Shorty was not a great deal better.  \"It's an awful risk to have an old man and a civilian come down here into camp,\" Si complained. \"And he oughtn't to go about alone. He's always been used to mingling with the quiet, honest, respectable people. Up home the people are as honest as the day is long. They're religious and peaceable, and Pap's never knowed no other kind. He wouldn't harm nobody for the world, and none o' them'd harm him. He's only a child among these toughs down here. I wisht one of us was able to be with him all the time.\"  \"That father o' yours is certainly quite an innocent old party,\" Shorty answered, consolingly, \"and the things he don't know about army life'd make more'n a pamphlet. But he has a way of wakin' up to the situation that is sometimes very surprisin'. I wisht I was able to go about with him, but I think he's fully able to take care o' himself around in camp. There's always somebody about who won't see an old man and a citizen imposed on. But what I'm afraid of is that he's wandered out in the country, huntin' for somethin' for us to eat, and the guerrillas've got him.\"  And he and Si shuddered at the thought of that good old man in the hands of the merciless scoundrels who infested the mountains and woods beyond the camps.  \"Yes,\" mourned Si, \"Pap's likely to mosey out into the country, jest like he would on Bean Blossom Crick, and stop at the first house he come to, and set down with 'em on the porch, and talk about the weather, and the crops, and the measles in the neighborhood, and the revivals, and the price o' pork and corn, and whether they'd better hold their wheat till Spring, and who was comin' up for office, and all the time the bushwhackers'd be sneakin' up on him, an' him know no more 'bout it than where the blackbirds was roostin'. He's jest that innocent and unsuspiciouslike.\"  \"If they've ketched him,\" said Shorty fiercely, \"we'll find out about it, and when we git able, we'll go out there and kill and burn everything for five miles around. I'll do it, if I have to spend the rest o' my life at hard labor on the Dry Tortugas.\"  They heard the rattle of light wheels on the frozen ground outside, and the hoof-beats of a quickly-moving horse.  \"Buggy or spring-wagon,\" muttered Si with a farmer boy's instinctive interpretation of such sounds. \"What's it doin' in camp? Strange horse. In better condition than any around here.\"  The vehicle stopped in front of the corn-crib at the Deacon's command, \"Whoa!\"  \"Gracious--there's Pap now,\" ejaculated Si, with whom memory went in a bound to the many times he had listened for his father's coming and heard that order.  \"Hello, boys,\" called out the Deacon. \"How are you? Shorty, come out here.\"  Shorty sprang up with something of his old-time alacrity, and Si made an effort to rise, but was too weak.  \"Throw a piece o' that fat pine on the fire. Shorty,\" said the Deacon, \"and let's see what I've got.\"  By the light of the blazing pine, the Deacon pulled off the cedar boughs and developed his store. The boughs had kept in the heat, so that the food was not yet quite cold, though it had a resinous flavor, from its covering. The Deacon broke one of the cornpones in two and gave half of it to Shorty, with as much as he thought he should have of the meat and vegetables. Then he fed Si, who relished the new diet almost as much as he had relished the chicken broth. The Deacon made a hearty supper himself, and then stored away the rest in his \"cellar\" under the crib, rolling up some more large stones as an additional precaution.  \"Well, you beat me,\" said Shorty admiringly, as he studied over the Deacon's booty. \"I used to think I was as slick a forager as there was in the army, but I simply ain't in the same class with a man that kin go out in this Sahara Desert o' starvation and bring in a four-year-old horse and a wagon-load o' cooked vittles. I'd never even see the distance pole runnin' with him. Gen. Rosecrans ought to know you. He'd appoint you Commissary-General o' the army at once. When I get a little stronger I want you to take me out and learn me the ABC's o' foragin'. To think that me and Si wuz grievin' about your being ketched by the guerrillas. What fools we wuz. It wuz lucky for the guerrillas that you didn't run acrost 'em, for you'd a ketched 'em, instid o' 'em you.\"  \"That's what I come purty nigh doin',\" chuckled the Deacon. \"But what in the world 'm I goin' to do with that hoss and buckboard? I must hunt around and find that poor beast some corn for tonight. He's bin driven purty sharp, and he needs his supper jest as bad as I did mine, and I won't feel right unless he has it. Then I must try to git him back to his owner termorrer.\"  \"If he's here to-morrer,\" said Shorty, looking at the animal carefully, \"it'll be a miracle. That's too good a hoss to be kept in this camp by anybody lower'n a Brigadier-General. The boys'll steal him, the Captains take him, the Colonels seize him, and the Brigadier-Generals appropriate him for the Government's service. They'll call it by different names, but the horse goes all the same. I don't see how you're goin' to keep him till mornin'. You can't put him in your cellar. If they don't steal him, it's because it's too dark to see him. I'm sorry to say there's an awful lot o' thieves in the Army o' the Cumberland.\"  And Shorty looked very grieved over the deplorable lack of regard in the army for the rights of property. He seemed to mourn this way for several minutes, and then broke out with:  \"Say, Mr. Klegg, I've an idee. That Quartermaster o' the Maumee Muskrats is a sport from way back. He'd give his vary eyes for a good hoss--one that kin beat everybody else's. The way the horses are run down now this one kin carry a heavy handicap, and beat any one in camp. I'll bet I kin take this hoss over to him and git $150 in greenbacks for him, for he kin win a bushel o' money with him the very first day.\"  \"Shorty,\" said the Deacon, in a tone that made that worthy start, \"necessity and the stress o' circumstances may force me to do many things which are agin my conscience, and for which I shall repent in sackcloth and ashes, if needs be, but I hain't yit bin reduced to sellin' stolen property. The Lord save me from that. That hoss and wagon's got to go back to the owner, if I risk my life in takin' 'em.\"  Shorty wisely kept his reply to himself, but he thought how absurd it was to have men about the army who were too old and set in their ideas to learn army ways. He muttered to himself:  \"If he succeeds in gittin' that hoss outen camp agin, I'll expect to see the back o' my neck, or something else quite as wonderful.\"  The Deacon finally succeeded in getting a couple of ears of corn and a handful of fodder for the horse's "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31776"],["title","Si Klegg, Book 6 (#1)"],["body","le, and the more that Si and Shorty cross-questioned such stragglers as came by the clearer it seemed to the boys that they were hopelessly bewildered, and the more depressed the youngsters became.  The morning brought no relief. Si and Shorty talked together, standing apart from the squad, and casting anxious glances over the swirling mass of army activity, which the boys did not fail to note and read with dismal forebodings.  \"I do believe they're lost,\" whimpered little Pete Skidmore. \"What in goodness will ever become of us, if we're lost in this awful wilderness?\"  The rest shuddered and grew pale at this horrible prospect.  \"That looks like a brigade headquarters over there,\" said Si, pointing to the left. \"And I believe that's our old brigade flag. I'm goin' over there to see.\"  \"I don't believe that's any brigade headquarters at all,\" said Shorty. \"Up there, to the right, looks ever so much more like a brigade headquarters. I'm goin' up there to see. You boys stay right there, and don't move off the ground till I come back. I won't be gone long.\"  As he left, the boys began to feel more lonely and hopeless than ever, and little Pete Skidmore had hard work to restrain his tears.  A large, heavy-jowled man, with a mass of black whiskers, and wearing a showy but nondescript uniform, appeared.  \"That must be one o' the big Generals,\" said Harry Joslyn. \"Looks like the pictures o' Grant. Git into line, boys, and salute.\"  \"No, it ain't Grant, neither,\" said Gid Mackall. \"Too big. Must be Gen. Thomas.\"  The awed boys made an effort to form a line and receive him properly.  \"Who are you, boys?\" said the newcomer, after gravely returning the salute.  \"We're recruits for the 200th Injianny Volunteer Infantry,\" answered Harry Joslyn. \"Kin you tell us where the rijimint is? We're lost.  \"Used to know sich a regiment. In fact, I used to be Lieutenant-Colonel of it. But I hain't heared of it for a long time. Think it's petered out.\"  \"Petered out!\" gasped the boys.  \"Yes. It was mauled and mummixed to death. There's plenty o' mismanagement all around the army, but the 200th Injianny had the worst luck of all. It got into awful bad hands. I quit it just as soon's I see how things was a-going. They begun to plant the men just as soon's they crossed the Ohio, and their graves are strung all the way from Louisville to Chickamauga. The others got tired o' being mauled around, and starved, and tyrannized over, and o' fighting for the nigger, and they skipped for home like sensible men.\"  The boys shuddered at the doleful picture.  \"Who brung you here?\" continued the newcomer.  \"Sarjint Klegg and Corpril Elliott,\" answered Harry.  \"Holy smoke,\" said the newcomer with a look of disgust. \"They've made non-commish out o' them sapsuckers. Why, I wouldn't let them do nothin' but dig ditches when I was in command o' the regiment. But they probably had to take them. All the decent material was gone. How much bounty'd you get?\"  \"We got $27.50 apiece,\" answered Harry. \"But we didn't care nothin' for the bounty. We--\"  \"Only $27.50 apiece. Holy smoke! They're payin' 10 times that in some places.\"  \"I tell you, we didn't enlist for the bounty,\" reiterated Harry.  \"All the same, you don't want to be robbed o' what's yours. You don't want to be skinned out o' your money by a gang o' snoozers who're gittin' rich off of green boys like you. Where's this Sarjint Klegg and Corpril Elliott that brung you here?\"  \"They've gone to look for the rijimint.\"  \"Gone to look for the regiment. Much they've gone to look for the regiment. They've gone to look out for their scalawag selves. When you see 'em agin, you'll know 'em, that's all.\"  Little Pete Skidmore began to whimper.  \"Say, boys,\" continued the newcomer, \"you'd better drop all idee of that 200th Injianny and come with me. If there is any sich a regiment any more, and you get to it, you'd be sorry for it as long as you live. I know a man over here who's got a nice regiment, and wants a few more boys like you to fill it up. He'll treat you white and give you twice as much bounty as you'll git anywhere's else, and he's goin' to keep his regiment back in the fortifications, where there won't be no fightin', and hard marches, and starvation--\"  \"But we enlisted to fight and march, and--\" interjected Harry.  \"Well, you want a good breakfast just now, more'n anything else, judgin' from appearances. Come along with me and I'll git you something to eat.\"  \"But we waz enlisted for the 200th Injianny Volunteer Infantry, and must go to that rijimint,\" protested Monty Scruggs.  \"Well, what's that got to do with your havin' a good breakfast?\" said the newcomer plausibly. \"You need that right off. Then we kin talk about your regiment. As a matter of fact, you're only enlisted in the Army of the United States and have the right to go to any regiment you please. Tyrannical as the officers may be, they can't take that privilege of an American freeman away from you. Come along and git breakfast first.\"  The man's appearance was so impressive, his words and confident manner so convincing, and the boys so hungry that their scruples vanished, and all followed the late Lieut.-Col. Billings, as he gave the word, and started off through the mazes of the camp with an air of confident knowledge that completed his conquest of them.  Ex-Lieut.-Col. Billings strode blithely along, feeling the gladsome exuberance of a man who had \"struck a good thing,\" and turning over in his mind as to where he had best market his batch of lively recruits, how he could get around the facts of their previous enlistment, and how much he ought to realize per head. He felt that he could afford to give the boys a good breakfast, and that that would be fine policy. Accordingly, he led the way to one of the numerous large eating houses, established by enterprising sutlers, to their own great profit and the shrinkage of the pay of the volunteers. He lined the boys up in front of the long shelf which served for a table and ordered the keeper:  \"Now, give each of these boys a good breakfast of ham and eggs and trimmings and I'll settle for it.\"  \"Good mornin', Kunnel. When 'd you git down here?\" said a voice at his elbow.  \"Hello, Groundhog, is that you?\" said Billings, turning around. \"Just the man I wanted to see. Finish your breakfast and come out here. I want to talk to you.\"  \"Well,\" answered Groundhog, wiping his mouth, \"I'm through. The feller that runs this shebang ain't made nothin' offen me, I kin tell you. It's the first square meal I've had for a week, and I've et until there ain't a crack left inside o' me that a skeeter could git his bill in. I laid out to git the wuth o' my money, and I done it. What're you doin' down here in this hole? Ain't Injianny good enough for you?\"  \"Injianny's good enough on general principles, but just now there's too much Abolition malaria there for me. The Lincoln satraps 've got the swing on me, and I thought I'd take a change of air. I've come down here to see if there weren't some chances to make a good turn, and I've done very well so far. I've done a little in cattle and got some cotton through the lines--enough at least to pay my board and railroad fare. But I think the biggest thing is in recruits, and I've got a scheme which I may let you into. You know there are a lot of agents down here from the New England States trying to git niggers to fill up their quotas, and they are paying big money for recruits. Can't you go out and gether up a lot o' niggers that we kin sell 'em?\"  \"Sure,\" said Groundhog confidently. \"Kin git all you want, if you'll pay for 'em. But what's this gang you've got with you?\"  \"O, they're a batch for that blasted Abolition outfit, the 200th Injianny. Them two ornery galoots, Si and Shorty, whose necks I ought've broke when I was with the regiment, have brung 'em down. They're not goin' to git to the 200th Injianny if I kin help it, though. First place, it'll give old McBiddle, that Abolition varmint, enough to git him mustered as Colonel. He helped oust me, and I have it in for him. He was recommended for promotion for gittin' his arm shot off at Chickamauga. Wisht it'd bin his cussed head.\"  \"But what're you goin' to do with the gang?\" Groundhog inquired.  \"O, there are two or three men around here that I kin sell 'em to for big money. I ought to make a clean thousand off 'em if I make a cent.\"  \"How much'll I git out o' that?\" inquired Groundhog anxiously.  \"Well, you ain't entitled to nothin' by rights. I've hived this crowd all by myself, and kin work 'em all right. But if you'll come along and make any affidavits that we may need, I'll give you a sawbuck. But on the nigger lay I'll stand in even with you, half and half. You run 'em in and I'll place 'em and we'll whack up.\"  \"'Tain't enough,\" answered Groundhog angrily. \"Look here, Jeff Billings, I know you of old. You've played off on me before, and I won't stand no more of it. Jest bekase you've bin a Lieutenant-Colonel and me only a teamster you've played the high and mighty with me. I'm jest as good as you are any day. I wouldn't give a howl in the infernal regions for your promises. You come down now with $100 in greenbacks and I'll go along and help you all I kin. If you don't--\"  \"If I don't what'll you do, you lowlived whelp?\" said Billings, in his usual brow-beating manner. \"I only let you into this as a favor, because I've knowed you before. You hain't brains enough to make a picayune yourself, and hain't no gratitude when someone else makes it for you. Git out o' here; I'm ashamed to be seen speakin' to a mangy hound like you. Git out o' here before I kick you out. Don't you dare speak to one o' them boys, or ever to me agin. If you do I'll mash you. Git out.\"  Si and Shorty's dismay when they returned and found their squad entirely disappeared was overwhelming. They stood and gazed at one another for a minute in speechless alarm and wonderment.  \"Great goodness,\" gasped Si at length, \"they can't"]]]
