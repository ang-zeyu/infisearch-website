Beginning from Jerusalem.     --_Acts._   A commercial message of trifling import may now be flashed in a few minutes from Jerusalem to the Antipodes: the message of Christ's love took nearly eighteen centuries to make the journey. For a time, indeed, the advance was direct and swift, for before the third century after Christ a Church had established itself in South India. But there the missionary impulse failed. Had the first rate of progress been maintained, the message would have reached our shores a whole millennium before it actually arrived.  But what would have been then its form and content? Had it made its way from island to island, passing through the minds of Malay, Papuan, or Melanesian on its passage, how much of its original purity would have been preserved? And who would have been here to receive it? Possibly, only the moa and the apteryx. Who knows?  These considerations enable us to look with less regret upon the check which the Christian message received after its first rapid advance. The rise of Mohammedanism in the sixth century drove the faith of Christ from Asia and from Africa, but it kept it \"white.\" It threw a barrier across the old road which led from Jerusalem to the Antipodes, but the barrier enabled preparation to be made on either side for a grander and more fruitful intercourse. On the south of the Islamic empire the migrations of the peoples brought to our islands the Maori race, who made them their permanent home. On the north, the Christian faith took firm hold of the maritime nations of Europe, from whom the missionaries of the future were to spring.  The capture of Constantinople by the Turks in 1452 may be taken as the turning point. It closed more firmly than ever the land-route to the south, but the libraries of this great city, in which was preserved nearly all that remained of ancient learning, were scattered by the captors, and their contents carried far and wide. New Testament manuscripts awakened fresh study in the western world, and led to a cleansing and quickening of religion; narratives of old Greek explorers made men impatient of the barrier which blocked them from the lands which the ancients had known, and thus drove them to seek new routes by sea.  Marvellous was the energy which now awoke. By 1492 Columbus had crossed the Atlantic, and Vasco da"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31235"],["title","Natural History of the Brush Mouse (Peromyscus boylii) in Kansas With (#1)"],["body","-on which brush mice are known to occur in Kansas are along Shoal Creek, Cherokee County. The brush mouse is found on low bluffs that are parts of higher systems, but in Cherokee County the mouse was not obtained from low bluffs separated by even a few miles from the cliff-system along Shoal Creek. As implied above the brush mouse is adapted for a scansorial mode of life; but other mice and rats inhabit the rocky crevices of low bluffs. Whereas the brush mouse is well adapted for living on high cliffs it seems that the other rodents are better adapted for life on low cliffs. _Sigmodon hispidus_ was obtained from the low, limestone cliffs mentioned previously. From most low bluffs in southeastern Kansas (and on some high bluffs outside the geographic range of _cansensis_) _Peromyscus leucopus_ was obtained. In Cowley County the brush mouse was abundant when _P. leucopus_ was not and _vice versa_ during this study. _Sigmodon hispidus_ did not associate with the brush mouse in any area, although _S. hispidus_ was often trapped in grassy areas adjacent to cliffs and on the grassy crests of the hills. Except at the locality in Cherokee County, the pack rat, _Neotoma floridana_, was found in association with the brush mouse. _Microtus ochrogaster_ was the must abundant rodent in adjacent southwestern Missouri (Jackson, 1907) before _Sigmodon_ thoroughly infiltrated this area and southeastern Kansas. Activities of other rodents may have confined the brush mouse ecologically to cliffs. Although the grasslands are a barrier to further intrusion by the brush mouse into Kansas, one cannot assume that they alone confined the brush mouse to cliffs. Such an assumption would not explain its absence on systems of cliffs similar to and near other systems of cliffs on which it is found in the non-grassy Ozarkian habitats of Arkansas, as was noticed by Black (1937). Such an assumption would not indicate why the size of the cliff-systems is correlated with the absence or presence of the brush mouse on the northeastern margin of its geographic range.  Parasites found on _P. b. attwateri_ include three individuals of the laelapid mite, _Haemolaelaps glasgowi_. Two of these mites were removed from a live mouse. Two larval Ixodid ticks, _Ixodes_ possibly _cookei_, were removed from the pinnae of the ears of a specimen of _cansensis_ from the type locality, 4 mi. E Sedan, Chautauqua County. Four larval Ixodid ticks, _Dermacentor_ possibly _variabilis_, were removed from the pinnae of the ears of a live specimen of _cansensis_ from 3 mi. W Cedar Vale, in Cowley County.  TABLE 2.

Analysis of 38 stomachs of the brush mouse (Table 2) show acorns to be the most commonly used food in winter and spring. Seed coats were only rarely found, and insects were absent. Two captive females preferred acorns. Live beetles and grasshoppers of numerous kinds were decapitated and their inner parts eaten. Seeds (wheat, corn, and oats) were also eaten. Inasmuch as acorns appear to be the chief food, it is not surprising that the brush mouse is usually found on cliffs that support stands of blackjack oak (_Quercus marilandica_). Other oaks are present, but I have no evidence that the brush mouse eats their acorns. A. Metcalf told me that he observed in December, 1960, a released brush mouse interrupt its movement toward a hole in a cliff-face along Cedar Creek, Cowley County, in order to pick up an acorn (judged to be from the blackjack oak) in daylight. The mouse carried the acorn into the hole in the cliff. I have observed that captive brush mice eat acorns of the blackjack oak but not some other kinds of acorns.   _Behavior_  The chief differences observed between the brush mouse and other species of the genus _Peromyscus_ in Kansas can be summarized as follows: the brush mouse is a superior and more cautious climber; seldom jumps from high places when under stress; is capable of finding its way better in partial darkness; has a stronger preference for acorns; and sometimes buries or hides seeds or acorns. These are all behavioral adaptations that seem in harmony with its mode of life.  Buck, Tolman, and Tolman (1925) showed the balancing function of the tail in _Mus musculus_. Climbers (for example, squirrels) often possess long, well-haired tails. It is reasonable to suggest (as did Hall, 1955:134) that the long, tufted tail is an adaptation for a scansorial existence. Little observation is necessary to observe how such a tail is used in balancing. Furthermore, it is used as a prop when the mouse is climbing a vertical surface. Dalquest (1955:144) mentioned tree-climbing in _P. boylii_ from San Luis Potosí, México. It may occur in _P. b. attwateri_ or in _P. b. cansensis_ also, but there is no evidence as yet to prove it.  The brush mouse can seldom be induced to jump from heights of two feet or more. Rather it tends to scamper downward or to remain in place. It often swings itself over an edge, holding to it by its hind feet, and sometimes to it lightly with its tail, and reduces a short jump by almost the length of its body. Such caution seems to be an adaptation in a mouse that lives as a climber.  Many animals of cavernous habitats have small eyes (see Dobzhansky, 1951:284). Some nocturnal animals (for example, owls) have large eyes. The brush mouse has large, protuberant eyes; it lives in the deep crevices and fissures of the cliffs on which it is found, but it is not strictly a cave-dwelling animal. Perhaps large eyes aid the brush mouse in performing activities in the partial darkness of a deep crevice or hole in a cliff. Brush mice experimentally placed in what appeared to be total darkness fed, built houses of cotton, and ran and climbed in the usual manner.  On several occasions the captive brush mice hid surplus seeds and on other occasions hid acorns by burying them and sometimes by placing them in a small jar. The mice never carried the surplus food into their house.  Black (1937:195) has claimed that the brush mouse builds a nest similar to that of the nest of the pack rat, _Neotoma floridana_. Hall (1955:134) doubts this to be the case. Dalquest (1953:144) described a nest of _P. boylii_ from San Luis Potosí as seven inches in diameter, made of leaves, and found in a hollow tree. Drake (1958:110) noted that _P. b. rowleyi_ lives in holes and crevices in rocky bluffs in Durango, México. I have found this to be the case for _P. b. attwateri_, as did A. Metcalf (unpublished) for _P. b. cansensis_. Nests of sticks and leaves were taken apart by Metcalf, and all sign indicated only the presence of the pack rat. I have observed that there are no such houses on the cliffs along Shoal Creek, Cherokee County, and that no pack rats have been obtained from there (pack rats have not been reported from Cherokee County). Blair (1938) found two brush mice (_P. b. attwateri_) in the house of a pack rat in Oklahoma. Nests of the brush mice that occur in Kansas have not been found.  A lactating, pregnant female (KU 81833) of _P. b. attwateri_, containing three embryos, was obtained on December 24, 1959, and shows that this subspecies breeds in winter. Accumulated records for the subspecies indicates year-round breeding (see Cockrum, 1952:181). Another female obtained on March 27, 1960, was probably lactating.  Pregnant females of _P. b. cansensis_ (KU 84892, 84895, and 84890) were obtained from the type locality on April 1-2, 1961, containing 3, 4, and 5 embryos respectively. This indicates, perhaps, increased breeding in spring; five was the highest number of embryos found in brush mice in Kansas.   _Population Studies_  In the period of my study the populations of brush mice became smaller, perhaps owing to the severe winter of 1959-1960. In Cowley County, _P. leucopus_ is now abundant and _P. boylii_ rare where in December of 1959, the opposite was true. It is also possible, of course, that trapping has depleted the populations.   Conclusions     1. A new subspecies of brush mouse is named and described from       southern Kansas.     2. The new subspecies has smaller eyes and a shorter tail and may       be more primitive than _P. b. attwateri_.     3. No significant sexual dimorphism was noted in _P. boylii_.     4. In Kansas, _P. b. attwateri_ is known only from a single       locality; _P. b. cansensis_ is known from only two localities,       both in Kansas.     5. The cliff-dwelling habit of _P. boylii_ probably isolates       populations from one another.     6. The grasslands constitute a barrier for the brush mouse.     7. In Kansas, _P. b. cansensis_ probably is an older population       than _P. b. attwateri_.     8. In Kansas the brush mouse is confined to systems of cliffs       that are wooded and that are at least 40 feet in height.     9. The brush mouse may be"]]]
