They must be somewhere around.\"  \"Don't know about that,\" said Shorty despairingly. \"We've bin gone some little time and they're quick-footed little rascals.\"  \"What fools we wuz to both go off and leave 'em,\" murmured Si in deep contrition. \"What fools we wuz.\"  \"No use o' cryin' over spilt milk,\" answered Shorty. \"The thing to do now is to find 'em, which is very much like huntin' a needle in a haystack. You stay here, on the chance o' them comin' back, and I'll take a circle around there to the left and look for 'em. If I don't find 'em I'll come back and we'll go down to the Provo-Marshal's.\"  \"Goodness, I'd rather be shot than go back to the rijimint without 'em,\" groaned Si. \"How kin I ever face the Colonel and the rest o' the boys?\"  Leaving Si gazing anxiously in every direction for some clew to his missing youngsters, Shorty rushed off in the direction of the sutler's shanties, where instinct told him he was most likely to find the runaways.  He ran up against Groundhog.  \"Where are you goin' in sich a devil of a hurry?\" the teamster asked. \"Smell a distillery somewhere?\"  \"Hello, Groundhog, is that you? Ain't you dead yit? Say, have you seen a squad o' recruits around here--all boys, with new uniforms, and no letters or numbers on their caps?\"  \"Lots and gobs of 'em. Camp's full of 'em. More comin' in by every train.\"  \"But these wuz all Injianny boys, most of 'em little. Not an old man among 'em.\"  \"Shorty, I know where your boys are. What'll you give me to tell you?\"  Shorty knew his man of old, and just the basis on which to open negotiations.  \"Groundhog, I've just had my canteen filled with first-class whisky--none o' your commissary rotgut, but old rye, hand-made, fire-distilled. I got it to take out to the boys o' the rijimint to celebrate my comin' back. Le' me have just one drink out of it, and I'll give it to you if you'll tell.\"  Groundhog wavered an instant. \"I wuz offered $10 on the other side.\"  Shorty was desperate. \"I'll give you the whisky and $10.\"  \"Le' me see your money and taste your licker.\"  \"Here's the money,\" said Shorty, showing a bill. \"I ain't goin' to trust you with the canteen, but I'll pour out this big spoon full, which'll be enough for you to taste.\" Shorty drew a spoon from his haversack and filled it level full.  \"It's certainly boss licker,\" said Groundhog, after he had drunk it, and prudently hefted the canteen to see if it was full. \"I'll take your offer. You're to have just one swig out o' it, and no more, and not a hog-swaller neither. I know you. You'd drink that hull canteenful at one gulp, if you had to. You'll let me put my thumb on your throat?\"  \"Yes, and I'll give you the canteen now and the money after we find the boys.\"  \"All right. Go ahead. Drink quick, for you must go on the jump, or you'll lose your boys.\"  Shorty lifted the canteen to his lips and Groundhog clasped his throat with his thumb on Adam's apple. When Shorty got his breath he sputtered:  \"Great Jehosephat, you didn't let me git more'n a spoonful. But where are the boys?\"  \"Old Jeff Billings's got 'em down at Zeke Wiggins's hash-foundry feedin' 'em, so's he kin toll 'em off into another rijimint.\"  \"Old Billings agin,\" shouted Shorty in a rage. \"Where's the place? Show it to me. But wait a minute till I run back and git my pardner.\"  \"Gi' me that licker fust,\" shouted Groundhog, but Shorty was already running back for Si. When he returned with him he threw the canteen to Groundhog with the order, \"Go ahead and show us the place.\"  By the time they came in sight of the sutler's shanty the boys had finished their breakfast and were moving off after Billings.  \"There's your man and there's your boys,\" said Groundhog, pointing to them. \"Now gi' me that 'ere sawbuck. You'll have to excuse me havin' anything to do with old Billings. He's licked me twice already.\"  Shorty shoved the bill into his hand, and rushed down in front of Billings.  \"Here, you black-whiskered old roustabout, where 're you takin' them boys?\" he demanded.  \"Git out o' my way, you red-headed snipe,\" answered Billings, making a motion as if to brush him away.  \"If you don't go off and leave them boys alone I'll belt you over the head with my gun,\" said Si, raising his musket.  \"You drunken maverick,\" answered Billings, trying to brave it out. \"I'll have you shot for insultin' and threatenin' your sooperior officer. Skip out o' here before the Provo comes up and ketches you. Let me go on about my business. Forward, boys.\"  \"Officer nothin'. You can't play that on us,\" said Si. \"Halt, there, boys, and stand fast.\"  A crowd of teamsters, sutlers' men and other camp followers gathered around. A tall, sandybearded man with keen, gray eyes and a rugged, stony face rode up. He wore a shabby slouch hat, his coat was old and weather-stained, but he rode a spirited horse.  \"Here, what's all this row about?\" he asked in quick, sharp tones.  \"Keep out o' this mix,\" said Shorty, without looking around. \"'Tain't none o' your business. This is our party.\" With that he made a snatch at Billings's collar to jerk him out of the way.  \"What, you rascal, would you assault an officer?\" said the newcomer, spurring his horse through the crowd to get at Shorty.  [Illustration: HE AIN'T NO OFFICER 27]  \"He ain't no officer, General,\" said Si, catching sight of two dim stars on the man's shoulders. \"He's tryin' to steal our recruits from us.\"  \"Yes, I am an officer,\" said Billings, avoiding Shorty's clutch. \"These men are assaultin' me while I'm on duty. I want them arrested and punished.\"  \"Fall back there, both of you,\" said the General severely, as Si and Shorty came to a present arms. \"Sergeant, who are you, and where do you belong?\"  \"I'm Serg't Klegg, sir, of Co. Q, 200th Injianny Volunteer Infantry.\"  \"Who are you, Corporal?\"  \"I'm Corp'l Elliott, sir, of Co. Q, 200th Injianny Volunteer Infantry.\"  \"Now, officer, who are you?\"  \"I'm Lieut.-Col. Billings, sir.\"  \"Where's your shoulder-straps?\"  \"I had 'em taken off this coat to git fixed. They were torn.\"  \"Where's your sword?\"  \"I left it in my quarters.\"  \"Fine officer, to go on duty that way. Where do you belong?\"  Billings hesitated an instant, but he felt sure that the General did not belong to the Army of the Cumberland, and he answered:  \"I belong to the 200th Ind.\"  \"That ain't true, General,\" Si protested. \"He was fired out of the regiment a year ago. He's a citizen.\"  \"Silence, Sergeant. Billings? Billings? The name of the Lieutenant-Colonel of the 200th Ind. happens to be McBiddle--one-armed man, good soldier. Billings? Billings? T. J. Billings? Is that your name?\"  \"Yes, sir,\" answered Billings, beginning to look very uncomfortable.  \"Didn't you have some trouble about a bunch of cattle you sold to the Quartermaster-General?\"  \"Well, there was little difference of opinion, but--\"  \"That'll do, sir. That'll do for the present. I begin to get you placed. I thought I knew the name Billings as soon as you spoke it, but I couldn't remember any officer in my army of that name. Now, Sergeant, tell me your story.\"  \"General, me and my pardner here,\" began Si, \"have bin home on wounded furlough. Wounded at Chickamauga and promoted. We got orders to bring on this squad o' recruits from Jeffersonville for our rijimint. We got in last night and this mornin' me and my pardner started out to see if we could find someone to direct us to the rijimint, leavin' the squad alone for a few minutes. While we wuz gone this feller, who's bin fired out of our rijimint and another one that he was in, come along and tolled our boys off, intendin' to sneak 'em into another rijimint and git pay for 'em. By great good luck we ketched him in time, just before you come up. You kin ask the boys themselves if I hain't told you the truth.\"  \"Good idea,\" said the General, in his quick, peremptory way. \"You three (indicating Si, Shorty and Billings) march off there 25 paces, while I talk to the boys.\"  Gen. Sherman, for it was the Commander of the Military Division of the Mississippi, who, with his usual impetuous, thorough way, would investigate even the most insignificant affair in his camps, when the humor seized him, now sprang from his horse, and began a sharp, nervous cross-questioning of the boys as to their names, residence, ages, how they came there and whither they were bound.  \"You came down with this Sergeant and Corporal, did you? You were recruited for the 200th Ind., were you? You were put under the charge of those men to be taken to your regiment?\" he asked Pete Skidmore, at the end of the line.  \"Yes, sir,\" blubbered Pete. \"And they are always losin' us, particularly me, durn 'em. Spite of all I kin say to 'em they'll lose me, durn their skins.\"  \"No, my boy, you sha'n't be lost,\" said the General kindly, as he remounted. \"Stick to our command and you'll come through all right. Billings, you thorough-paced rascal, I want you to get to the other side of the Ohio River as quickly as the trains will carry you. I haven't time to deal with you as you deserve, but if I have occasion to speak to you again you'll rue it as long as you live. There's a train getting ready to go out. If you are wise, you'll take it. Serg't Klegg and Corp'l Elliott, you deserve to lose your stripes for both of you leaving your squad at the same time. See that you don't do it again. You'll find the 200th Ind. in camp on the east side of Mission Ridge, about a mile south of Rossville Gap. Go out this road until you pass old John Ross's house about a half a mile. You'll find several roads leading off to the right, but don't take any of them till you come to one that turns off by a sweet gum and a honey-locust standing together on the banks of a creek. Understand? A sweet gum and a honey-locust standing together on the banks of a creek. Turn off there, go across the mountain and you'll find your camp. Move promptly now.\"  \"I declare,\" said a big Wagonmaster, as the General galloped off, \"if that old Gump Sherman don't"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31778"],["title","The Draw (#1)"],["body"," I'll move on instead, if you'll let me.\"  And I picked up my reins, moving my hands real careful-like, and turned my horse around and started down the slope. I could feel his eyes on me, and I was half-waiting for a bullet in the back. But it didn't come. Instead Buck Tarrant called, \"Doolin!\"  I turned my head. \"Yeah?\"  He was standing there in the same position. Somehow he reminded me of a crazy, runt wolf--his eyes were almost yellowish, and when he talked he moved his lips too much, mouthing his words, and his big crooked teeth flashed in the sun. I guess all the hankering for toughness in him was coming out--he was acting now like he'd always wanted to--cocky, unafraid, mean--because now he wore a bigger gun than anybody. It showed all over him, like poison coming out of his skin.  \"Doolin,\" he called. \"I'll be in town around three this afternoon. Tell Ben Randolph for me that he's a son of a bitch. Tell him he's a dunghead sheriff. Tell him he'd better look me up when I get there, or else get outa town and stay out. You got that?\"  \"I got it, Buck.\"  \"Call me Mr. Tarrant, you Irish bastard.\"  \"Okay ... Mr. Tarrant,\" I said, and reached the bottom of the slope and turned my horse along the road through the Pass. About a hundred yards farther on, I hipped around in the saddle and looked back. He was practising again--the crouch, the fantastic draw, the shot.  I rode on toward town, to tell Ben Randolph he'd either have to run or die.         *       *       *       *       *  Ben was a lanky, slab-sided Texan who'd come up north on a drive ten years before and liked the Arizona climate and stayed. He was a good sheriff--tough enough to handle most men, and smart enough to handle the rest. Fourteen years of it had kept him lean and fast.  When I told him about Buck, I could see he didn't know whether he was tough or smart or fast enough to get out of this one.  He leaned back in his chair and started to light his pipe, and then stared at the match until it burned his fingers without touching it to the tobacco.  \"You sure, Joe?\" he said.  \"Ben, I saw it four times. At first I just couldn't believe my eyes--but I tell you, he's fast. He's faster'n you or me or Hickock or anybody. God knows where he got it, but he's got the speed.\"  \"But,\" Ben Randolph said, lighting another match, \"it just don't happen that way.\" His voice was almost mildly complaining. \"Not overnight. Gunspeed's something you work on--it comes slow, mighty slow. You know that. How in hell could Buck Tarrant turn into a fire-eating gunslinger in a few days?\" He paused and puffed. \"You sure, Joe?\" he asked again, through a cloud of smoke.  \"Yes.\"  \"And he wants me.\"  \"That's what he said.\"  Ben Randolph sighed. \"He's a bad kid, Joe--just a bad kid. If his father hadn't died, I reckon he might have turned out better. But his mother ain't big enough to wallop his butt the way it needs.\"  \"You took his gun away from him a couple times, didn't you, Ben?\"  \"Yeah. And ran him outa town too, when he got too pestiferous. Told him to get the hell home and help his ma.\"  \"Guess that's why he wants you.\"  \"That. And because I'm sheriff. I'm the biggest gun around here, and he don't want to start at the bottom, not him. He's gonna show the world right away.\"  \"He can do it, Ben.\"  He sighed again. \"I know. If what you say's true, he can sure show _me_ anyhow. Still, I got to take him up on it. You know that. I can't leave town.\"  I looked at his hand lying on his leg--the fingers were trembling. He curled them into a fist, and the fist trembled.  \"You ought to, Ben,\" I said.  \"Of course I ought to,\" he said, a little savagely. \"But I can't. Why, what'd happen to this town if I was to cut and run? Is there anyone else who could handle him? Hell, no.\"  \"A crazy galoot like that,\" I said slowly, \"if he gets too damn nasty, is bound to get kilt.\" I hesitated. \"Even in the back, if he's too good to take from the front.\"  \"Sure,\" Ben Randolph said. \"Sooner or later. But what about meantime?... how many people will he have to kill before somebody gets angry or nervy enough to kill _him_? That's my job, Joe--to take care of this kind of thing. Those people he'd kill are depending on me to get between him and them. Don't you see?\"         *       *       *       *       *  I got up. \"Sure, Ben, I see. I just wish _you_ didn't.\"  He let out another mouthful of smoke. \"You got any idea what he meant about thinking his gun into his hand?\"  \"Not the slightest. Some crazy explanation he made up to account for his sudden speed, I reckon.\"  Another puff. \"You figure I'm a dead man, Joe, huh?\"  \"It looks kind of that way.\"  \"Yeah, it kind of does, don't it?\"  At four that afternoon Buck Tarrant came riding into town like he owned it. He sat his battered old saddle like a rajah on an elephant, and he held his right hand low beside his hip in an exaggerated gunman's stance. With his floppy hat over at a cocky angle, and his big eyes and scrawny frame, he'd have looked funny as hell trying to look like a tough hombre--except that he _was_ tough now, and everybody in town knew it because I'd warned them. Otherwise somebody might have jibed him, and the way things were now, that could lead to a sudden grave.  Nobody said a word all along the street as he rode to the hitchrail in front of the Once Again and dismounted. There wasn't many people around _to_ say anything--most everybody was inside, and all you could see of them was a shadow of movement behind a window there, the flutter of a curtain there.  Only a few men sat in chairs along the boardwalks under the porches, or leaned against the porchposts, and they just sort of stared around, looking at Buck for a second and then looking off again if he turned toward them.  I was standing near to where Buck hitched up. He swaggered up the steps of the saloon, his right hand poised, his bulging eyes full of hell.  \"You tell him?\" he asked.  I nodded. \"He'll look you up, like you said.\"  Buck laughed shortly. \"I'll be waiting. I don't like that lanky bastard. I reckon I got some scores to settle with him.\" He looked at me, and his face twisted into what he thought was a tough snarl. Funny--you could see he really wasn't tough down inside. There wasn't any hard core of confidence and strength. His toughness was in his holster, and all the rest of him was acting to match up to it.  \"You know,\" he said, \"I don't like you either, Irish. Maybe I oughta kill you. Hell, why not?\"  Now, the only reason I'd stayed out of doors that afternoon was I figured Buck had already had one chance to kill me and hadn't done it, so I must be safe. That's what I figured--he had nothing against me, so I was safe. And I had an idea that maybe, when the showdown came, I might be able to help out Ben Randolph somehow--if anything on God's Earth _could_ help him.  Now, though, I wished to hell I hadn't stayed outside. I wished I was behind one of them windows, looking out at somebody else get told by Buck Tarrant that maybe he oughta kill him.  \"But I won't,\" Buck said, grinning nastily. \"Because you done me a favor. You run off and told the sheriff just like I told you--just like the goddam white-livered Irish sheepherder you are. Ain't that so?\"  I nodded, my jaw set so hard with anger that the flesh felt stretched.  He waited for me to move against him. When I didn't, he laughed and swaggered to the door of the saloon. \"Come on, Irish,\" he said over his shoulder. \"I'll buy you a drink of the best.\"  I followed him in, and he went over to the bar, walking heavy, and looked old Menner right in the eye and said, \"Give me a bottle of the best stuff you got in the house.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Menner looked at the kid he'd kicked out of his place a dozen times, and his face was white. He reached behind him and got a bottle and put it on the bar.  \"Two glasses,\" said Buck Tarrant.  Menner carefully put two glasses on the bar.  \"_Clean_ glasses.\"  Menner polished two other glasses on his apron and set them down.  \"You don't want no money for this likker, do you, Menner?\" Buck asked.  \"No, sir.\"  \"You'd just take it home and spend it on that fat heifer of a wife you got, and on them two little halfwit brats, wouldn't you?\"  Menner nodded.  \"Hell, they really ain't worth the trouble, are they?\"  \"No, sir.\"  Buck snickered and poured two shots and handed me one. He looked around the saloon and saw that it was almost empty--just Menner behind the bar, and a drunk asleep with his head on his arms at a table near the back, and a little gent in fancy town clothes fingering his drink at a table near the front window and not even looking at us.  \"Where is everybody?\" he asked Menner.  \"Why, sir, I reckon they're home, most of them,\" Menner said. \"It being a hot day and all--\"  \"Bet it'll get hotter,\" Buck said, hard.  \"Yes, sir.\"  \"I guess they didn't want to really feel the heat, huh?\"  \"Yes, sir.\"  \"Well, it's going to get so hot, you old bastard, that everybody'll feel it. You know that?\"  \"If you say so, sir.\"  \"It might even get hot for you. Right now even. What do you think of that, huh?\"  \"I--I--\"  \"You thrun me outa here a couple times, remember?\"  \"Y-yes ... but I--\"  \"Look at this!\" Buck said--and his gun was in his hand, and he didn't seem to have moved at all, not an inch. I was looking right at him when he did it--his hand was on the bar, resting beside his shotglass, and then suddenly his gun was in it and pointing right at old Menner's belly.  \"You know,\" Buck said, grinning at how Menner's fear was crawling all over his face, \"I can put a bullet right where I want to. Wanta see me do it?\"  His gun crashed, and flame leaped across the bar, and the mirror behind the bar had a spiderweb of cracks radiating from a round black hole.  Menner stood there, blood leaking down his neck from a split earlobe.  Buck's gun went off again, and the other earlobe was a red tatter.  And Buck's gun was back in its holster with the same speed it had"]]]
