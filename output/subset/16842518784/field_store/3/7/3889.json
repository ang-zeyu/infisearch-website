[[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31334"],["title","Descriptions of Two Species of Frogs, Genus Ptychohyla (#1)"],["body","of the _schmidtorum_-group of      _Ptychohyla_ differing from other known members of the group      in having the following combination of characters: diameter      of tympanum not noticeably less than half that of eye; white      spot below eye; white lateral stripe on body anteriorly;      dorsum bright green in life; thighs yellowish brown.       _Description of Holotype._--Adult male having snout-vent      length of 27.3 mm.; tibia length, 12.8 mm.; tibia      length/snout-vent length, 48.7 per cent; foot length      (measured from proximal edge of inner metatarsal tubercle to      tip of longest toe), 10.8 mm.; head length, 9.2 mm.; head      length/snout-vent length, 33.7 per cent; head width, 9.0      mm.; head width/snout-vent length, 30.9 per cent; diameter      of eye, 2.8 mm.; diameter of tympanum, 1.4 mm.;      tympanum/eye, 50.0 per cent. Snout in lateral profile nearly      square, slightly rounded above; in dorsal profile bluntly      squared; canthus pronounced; loreal region concave; lips      thick, rounded, and flaring; nostrils protuberant;      internarial distance, 2.3 mm.; top of head flat;      interorbital distance, 3.3 mm.; much broader than width of      eyelid, 2.4 mm. A thin dermal fold from posterior corner of      eye above tympanum to insertion of forelimb, covering upper      edge of tympanum; tympanum nearly round, its diameter equal      to its distance from eye. Forearm slender lacking distinct      fold on wrist; a row of low, rounded tubercles on      ventrolateral surface of forearm; pollex moderately enlarged      without nuptial spines; second and fourth fingers equal in      length; subarticular tubercles round, none bifid; discs      small, that of third finger noticeably smaller than      tympanum; no web between first and second fingers; vestige      of web between other fingers. Heels overlap when hind limbs      adpressed; tibiotarsal articulation reaches to middle of      eye; no tarsal fold; inner metatarsal tubercle large, flat,      and elliptical; outer metatarsal tubercle slightly more      distal than inner, small, and elliptical; subarticular      tubercles round; length of digits from shortest to longest      1-2-5-3-4; third and fifth toes webbed to base of disc;      fourth toe webbed to base of penultimate phalanx; discs      smaller on toes than on fingers. Anal opening directed      posteriorly at upper level of thighs; no anal flap; pair of      large tubercles below anal opening and a slightly smaller      pair farther below. Skin of dorsum and ventral surfaces of      forelimbs and shanks smooth; that of throat, belly, and      ventral surfaces of thighs granular. Ventrolateral glands      well developed, not reaching axilla or groin and broadly      separated midventrally. Skin of anterior part of chin      glandular. Tongue cordiform, shallowly notched behind and      only slightly free posteriorly; vomerine teeth 2-2, situated      on small triangular elevations between large, ovoid inner      nares; openings to vocal sac large, one situated along inner      posterior edge of each mandibular ramus.       Color (in alcohol) dark purplish brown on dorsal surfaces of      head, body, and shanks; thighs brown above and yellowish tan      posteriorly; white stripe extending from below eye above      forearm to mid-flank. Ventral surfaces creamy white;      ventrolateral glands orange-tan flecked with dark brown;      edge of lower lip with dark brown spots; narrow white line      on upper lip; palms white and soles brown.       Color (in life) uniform dark bright green above with creamy      white bar below eye; lateral stripe silvery white; ventral      surfaces deep yellow; posterior surfaces of thighs yellow      brown; iris reddish bronze.       _Variation._--Sixteen adult males are available; these have      snout-vent lengths of 26.3 to 28.5 mm. (average, 27.6 mm.).      The tympanum/eye ratio is 48.2 to 58.6 per cent (average,      53.2 per cent). The number of vomerine teeth varies from      four to six. The extent of the ventrolateral glands is      variable. In five specimens the glands nearly meet      midventrally; in two others the glands include the axillary      region; in none do the glands extend into the groin. In      other structural details there is no noticeable variation.       The greatest variation in color pattern is found in the      lateral stripe. The pale spot or bar below the eye is      present in all specimens; in one individual there is no      lateral stripe; in three the stripe extends posteriorly only      to above the forearm, in two to the mid-flank, and in the      others to the groin.       Although all of the males were bright uniform green above      when collected at night as they were calling, some changed      color later. In these individuals the dorsum became a      somewhat paler green with faint irregular yellowish tan      blotches.       The one available female (UMMZ 121399) has a snout-vent      length of 30.3 mm. and a tympanum/eye ratio of 52.8 per      cent, and is colored like the males. The tubercles by the      anal opening are placed irregularly and do not consist of      two pairs below the opening. There are no ventrolateral      glands, glandular area on the chin, or enlarged prepollex.       _Comparisons._--_Ptychohyla chamulae_ resembles _P.      schmidtorum_ in color pattern and body proportions, but the      ground color of _schmidtorum_ is chocolate brown and not      green as in _chamulae_. Also, in _schmidtorum_ the webbing      and posterior surfaces of the thighs are pale cream-color in      preserved specimens as contrasted with tan in _chamulae_. In      living _schmidtorum_ the iris is bright red, not reddish      bronze as in _chamulae_. The ventrolateral glands in      _schmidtorum_ more closely approximate one another      midventrally than in _chamulae_. It is conceivable that      these populations are subspecifically related; _schmidtorum_      occurs in the same kind of habitat as does _chamulae_, but      is known only from the Pacific slopes of southeastern      Chiapas and southwestern Guatemala, whereas _chamulae_ is      known only from the Atlantic slopes of the Mesa Central in      north-central Chiapas. Both of these species differ from      _Ptychohyla ignicolor_ in having a relatively larger      tympanum, more webbing on the foot, different arrangement of      anal tubercles, and different coloration.       _Description of Tadpole._--Six tadpoles having fully      developed mouth parts have body lengths of 5.5 to 11.9 mm.      and total lengths of 17.3 to 44.0 mm. The following      description is based on a tadpole (KU 58199) having small      hind limbs, a body length of 10.5 mm., and a total length of      39.0 mm. Body ovoid, only slightly flattened dorsally and      ventrally (Fig. 1); body only slightly deeper than wide;      eyes directed dorsolaterally and slightly protuberant;      nostrils small. Tail long and slender; greatest depth of      tail-musculature two-thirds greatest depth of tail-fin;      tail-musculature extending nearly to tip of tail-fin.       Mouth directed anteroventrally; thin fleshy lips greatly      expanded and forming large suckerlike disc; width of mouth      greater than width of snout and nearly as wide as body.      Outer edge of lips having small papillae; inner surface of      mouth smooth; scattered large papillae, seemingly in rows,      around teeth and beak (Fig. 2). Tooth rows 3/3; the upper      rows subequal in length; upper rows one and three      interrupted medially; lower rows one and two about equal in      length to upper rows; third lower row short. Upper beak      heavy and horn-covered.  [Illustration: FIG. 1. Tadpole of _Ptychohyla chamulae_ (KU 58199). × 2.5.]  [Illustration: FIG. 2. Mouthparts of tadpole of _Ptychohyla chamulae_ (KU 58199). × 16.]       Color (in alcohol) dark brown over entire body and      tail-musculature; a white area near base of tail, and a dark      streak on anterior one-fourth of tail; tail-fin transparent      having brown blotches.       _Remarks_.--Five metamorphosing tadpoles and juveniles (KU      58074, 58234-8) were found at night on vegetation by      streams. Of two completely metamorphosed young each has a      snout-vent length of 15.7 mm. Another having a snout-vent      length of 16.2 mm. has a tail stub 2 mm. long and a      completely metamorphosed mouth. Two others have snout-vent      lengths of 13.6 and 14.1 mm. and tail lengths of 11.5 and      8.1 mm. respectively; in these the mouth parts are      incompletely metamorphosed. The single female available      (UMMZ 121399) contains approximately 60 ovarian eggs, the      largest of which are about 2.5 mm. in diameter.       _Referred Specimens.--Chiapas_: 6.2 km. S of Rayón      Mescalapa, KU 58063-74, 58199 (1 tadpole), 58234-8; 5.6 km.      S of Rayón Mescalapa, KU 58062, 58200 (5 tadpoles); 11.4 mi.      N of Pueblo Nuevo Solistahuacán, UMMZ 121395-9. The      specimens listed last were collected along a stream between      Pueblo Nuevo Solistahuacán and Rayón Mescalapa, which,      according to Floyd L. Downs, is probably the same stream      listed above as 5.6 km. S of Rayón Mescalapa.  Acknowledgments  I take this opportunity to thank Dale L. Hoyt, Thomas E. Moore, and John Wellman, who ably assisted in collecting and studying these frogs in the field. I am indebted to Floyd L. Downs for permission to include specimens collected by him and John Winklemann. My studies on hylid frogs are supported by the National Science Foundation (Grant G 9827).
