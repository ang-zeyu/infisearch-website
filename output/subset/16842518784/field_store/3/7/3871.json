When the plan was formed, the aid of the sister-arts was called in; for the essence of the Masque was pomp and glory. Moveable scenery of the most costly and splendid kind was lavished on the Masque; the most celebrated masters were employed on the songs and dances; and all that the kingdom afforded of vocal and instrumental excellence was employed to embellish the exhibition.[8] Thus magnificently constructed, the Masque was not committed to ordinary performers. It was composed, as Lord Bacon says, for princes, and by princes it was played.[9] Of these Masques, the skill with which their ornaments were designed, and the inexpressible grace with which they were executed, appear to have left a vivid impression on the mind of Jonson. His genius awakes at once, and all his faculties attune to sprightliness and pleasure. He makes his appearance, like his own Delight, 'accompanied with Grace, Love, Harmony, Revel, Sport, and Laughter.'    \"In curious knot and mazes so   The Spring at first was taught to go;   And Zephyr, when he came to woo   His Flora, had his _motions_[10] too;   And thus did Venus learn to lead   The Idalian brawls, and so to tread,   As if the wind, not she, did walk,   Nor press'd a flower, nor bow'd a stalk.  \"But in what,\" says Gifford, \"was the taste of the times _wretched_? In poetry, painting, architecture, they have not since been equalled; and it ill becomes us to arraign the taste of a period which possessed a cluster of writers of whom the meanest would now be esteemed a prodigy.\" Malone did not live to read this denouncement of his objection to these Masques, as \"bungling shows;\" and which Warburton treats as \"fooleries;\" Granger as \"wretched performances;\" while Mr. Todd regards them merely as \"the humour of the times!\"  Masques were often the private theatricals of the families of our nobility, performed by the ladies and gentlemen at their seats; and were splendidly got up on certain occasions: such as the celebration of a nuptial, or in compliment to some great visitor. The Masque of Comus was composed by Milton to celebrate the creation of Charles the First as Prince of Wales; a scene in this Masque presented both the castle and the town of Ludlow, which proves, that although our small public theatres had not yet displayed any of the scenical illusions which long afterwards Davenant introduced, these scenical effects existed in great perfection in the Masques. The minute descriptions introduced by Thomas Campion, in his \"Memorable Masque,\" as it is called, will convince us that the scenery must have been exquisite and fanciful, and that the poet was always a watchful and anxious partner with the machinist, with whom sometimes, however, he had a quarrel.  The subject of this very rare Masque was \"The Night and the Hours.\" It would be tedious to describe the first scene with the fondness with which the poet has dwelt on it. It was a double valley; one side, with dark clouds hanging before it; on the other, a green vale, with trees, and nine golden ones of fifteen feet high; from which grove, towards \"the State,\" or the seat of the king, was a broad descent to the dancing-place: the bower of Flora was on the right, the house of Night on the left; between them a hill, hanging like a cliff over the grove. The bower of Flora was spacious, garnished with flowers and flowery branches, with lights among them; the house of Night ample and stately, with black columns studded with golden stars; within, nothing but clouds and twinkling stars; while about it were placed, on wire, artificial bats and owls, continually moving. As soon as the king entered the great hall, the hautboys, out of the wood on the top of the hill, entertained the time, till Flora and Zephyr were seen busily gathering flowers from the bower, throwing them into baskets which two silvans held, attired in changeable taffeta. The song is light as their fingers, but the burden is charming:--    Now hath Flora robb'd her bowers   To befriend this place with flowers;     Strow about! strow about!   Divers, divers flowers affect   For some private dear respect;     Strow about! strow about!   But he's none of Flora's friend   That will not the rose commend;     Strow about! strow about!  I cannot quit this Masque, of which, collectors know the rarity, without preserving one of those Doric delicacies, of which, perhaps, we have outlived the taste! It is a playful dialogue between a Silvan and an Hour, while Night appears in her house, with her long black hair spangled with gold, amidst her Hours; their faces black, and each bearing a lighted black torch.    SILVAN. Tell me, gentle Hour of Night,                    Wherein dost thou most delight?    HOUR.   Not in sleep!    SILVAN.                Wherein then?    HOUR.    In the frolic view of men!    SILVAN.  Lov'st thou music?    HOUR.                    Oh! 'tis sweet!    SILVAN.  What's dancing?    HOUR.                   E'en the mirth of feet.    SILVAN.  Joy you in fairies and in elves?    HOUR.    We are of that sort ourselves!            But, Silvan! say, why do you love            Only to frequent the grove?    SILVAN.  Life is fullest of content            When delight is innocent.    HOUR.    Pleasure must vary, not be long!            Come then, let's close, and end the song!  That the moveable scenery of these Masques formed as perfect a scenical illusion as any that our own age, with all its perfection of decoration, has attained to, will not be denied by those who have read the few Masques which have been printed. They usually contrived a double division of the scene; one part was for some time concealed from the spectator, which produced surprise and variety. Thus in the Lord's Masque, at the marriage of the Palatine, the scene was divided into two parts, from the roof to the floor; the lower part being first discovered, there appeared a wood in perspective, the innermost part being of \"releeve or whole round,\" the rest painted. On the left a cave, and on the right a thicket, from which issued Orpheus. At the back part of the scene, at the sudden fall of a curtain, the upper part broke on the spectators, a heaven of clouds of all hues; the stars suddenly vanished, the clouds dispersed; an element of artificial fire played about the house of Prometheus--a bright and transparent cloud, reaching from the heavens to the earth, whence the eight masquers descending with the music of a full song; and at the end of their descent the cloud broke in twain, and one part of it, as with a wind, was blown athwart the scene. While this cloud was vanishing, the wood, being the under part of the scene, was insensibly changing; a perspective view opened, with porticoes on each side, and female statues of silver, accompanied with ornaments of architecture, filling the end of the house of Prometheus, and seemed all of goldsmiths' work. The women of Prometheus descended from their niches, till the anger of Jupiter turned them again into statues. It is evident, too, that the size of the proscenium, or stage, accorded with the magnificence of the scene; for I find choruses described, \"and changeable conveyances of the song,\" in manner of an echo, performed by more than forty different voices and instruments in various parts of the scene. The architectural decorations were the pride of Inigo Jones; such could not be trivial.  \"I suppose,\" says the writer of this Masque, \"few have ever seen more neat artifice than Master Inigo Jones showed in contriving their motion; who, as all the rest of the workmanship which belonged to the whole invention, showed extraordinary industry and skill, which if it be not as lively expressed in writing as it appeared in view, rob not him of his due, but lay the blame on my want of right apprehending his instructions, for the _adoring_ of his art.\" Whether this strong expression should be only _adorning_ does not appear in any errata; but the feeling of admiration was fervent among the spectators of that day, who were at least as much astonished as they were delighted. Ben Jonson's prose descriptions of scenes in his own exquisite Masques, as Gifford observes, \"are singularly bold and beautiful.\" In a letter which I discovered, the writer of which had been present at one of these Masques, and which Gifford has preserved,[11] the reader may see the great poet anxiously united with Inigo Jones in working the machinery. Jonson, before \"a sacrifice could be performed, turned the globe of the earth, standing behind the altar.\" In this globe \"the sea was expressed heightened with silver waves, which stood, or rather hung (for no axle was seen to support it), and _turning softly_, discovered the first Masque,\"[12] &c. This \"turning softly\" producing a very magical effect, the great poet would trust to no other hand but his own!  It seems, however, that as no Masque-writer equalled Jonson, so no machinist rivalled Inigo Jones. I have sometimes caught a groan from some unfortunate poet, whose beautiful fancies were spoilt by the bungling machinist. One says, \"The _order of this scene_ was carefully and ingeniously disposed, and as happily put in act (for the _motions_) by the king's master carpenter;\" but he adds, \"the _painters_, I must needs say (not to belie them), lent small colour to any, to attribute much of the spirit of these things to their pencil.\" Campion, in one of his Masques, describing where the trees were gently to sink, &c., by an engine placed under the stage, and in sinking were to open, and the masquers appear out at their tops, &c., adds this vindictive marginal note: \"Either by the _simplicity_, _negligence_, or _conspiracy_ of the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31084"],["title","Neotropical Bats from Western México (#1)"],["body"," open epiphyseal sutures; all other Guerreran specimens lacked these sutures. Of 13 adult females from Guerrero, only two, taken in May, contained embryos (one embryo in each).       Average and extreme measurements in millimeters of 28 adult      Guerreran _A. hirsutus_ of both sexes (the sexes are not      significantly different) are as follows: total length, 79.5      (69-90); length of hind foot, 15.1 (12-17); length of ear,      21.1 (19-24); length of forearm, 55.8 (53.1-57.8); greatest      length of skull, 27.11 (26.3-28.0); condylocanine length,      22.92 (22.1-23.5); lambdoidal breadth, 14.23 (13.7-14.6);      postorbital constriction, 6.51 (6.2-6.8); and weight (in      grams), 37.4 (34.0-42.6).  The presence or absence of the third molar tooth was recorded for 88 specimens (28 from Sonora, Sinaloa, and Chihuahua, and 60 from Guerrero and Jalisco). The third molar tooth is present on both sides of the lower jaw in all specimens except one (12413 Univ. Illinois) from Sonora which lacks both upper and lower third molars. The upper third molar is usually present on both sides. The exceptions are as follows: the above mentioned Sonoran specimen and one other Sonoran specimen, one specimen from La Bufa, Chihuahua, two from Jalisco, and five from Guerrero lack the tooth on both sides; two specimens from Guerrero and one from Sonora lack the tooth on only one side. Facial stripes are absent or present but inconspicuous in all specimens recorded here. The generally grayish hue, hairiness of interfemoral membrane, and configuration of skull described by Lukens and Davis (1957:7) for _A. hirsutus_ are evident in all the specimens reported here. Skins of three adults from Sonora and Chihuahua are slightly browner and somewhat paler than skins of adults from Jalisco and Guerrero.  Reproductive data from Sonora and Chihuahua are as follows: of the five Chihuahuan specimens, two are immature (open epiphyseal sutures); the one adult female (79443) contained a single embryo 28 mm. in crown-rump length. Eight of 20 Sonoran specimens taken in May are females, each of which lacks epiphyseal sutures, and each contained one embryo. One embryo measured 8 mm. in length of uterine enlargement; all others are longer than 20 mm. from crown to rump, but vary in stage of development, some having no pigmentation in the membranes and others having pigmentation. The forearm is only 42 mm. long in one young male from Sonora. Three of 8 Sonoran specimens taken in July had open epiphyseal sutures but were of adult size. In summary of the reproductive data by states, _Artibeus hirsutus_ is known to bear embryos in the following months: May in Sonora, July in Chihuahua, February in Jalisco, and May in Guerrero. These data, along with the presence of embryos and young of various ages among specimens taken at the same place and time, indicate that the species does not have a restricted breeding season.  A geographic overlap of the ranges of _A. hirsutus_ and _A. jamaicensis_ from Guerrero to central Sinaloa is now known. But the two species have not been taken at the same place within this region of overlap.   ~Other species.~--At the locality on the Río Septentrión, 1500 feet, 1-1/2 mi. SW Tocuina, Chihuahua, from which specimens of _A. hirsutus_ were obtained as mentioned previously, several other species of tropical bats were captured, including _Desmodus rotundus murinus_ Wagner, _Glossophaga soricina leachii_ (Gray), _Chilonycteris parnellii mexicana_ Miller, _Sturnira lilium parvidens_ Goldman, and _Chiroderma_ (specimens not yet certainly identified to species). The canyon of the Río Septentrión is steep and rocky, the tropical vegetation occurs only in the bottom of the canyon, and unless construction of a railroad had been in progress the area could have been reached only after several days by means of a pack train. From a distributional standpoint the occurrence of _Sturnira_ and _Chiroderma_ 1-1/2 mi. SW of Tocuina is of unusual interest.  The published record of _Sturnira lilium_ nearest to Tocuina is from 2 mi. N Ciudad Guzmán (19°43', 103°28'), Jalisco, and the nearest published record of the genus _Chiroderma_ is of _Chiroderma isthmicum_ from Presidio (18°37', 96°47'), Veracruz (Hall and Kelson, 1959:126, 134). The Chihuahuan specimens extend the known range of _Sturnira lilium_ approximately 585 miles northwestward and that of the genus _Chiroderma_ approximately 920 miles northwestward from the localities noted above. Five specimens (79434-79438) of _Sturnira lilium_, two adults and three immature individuals, were taken from July 18 to July 22, 1958, by the author and Kenneth E. Shain, as also were the two (79439-79440) _Chiroderma_.  To the list given by Koopman and Martin (1959:9) of neotropical genera known to range farther north on the west coast of North America than on the east coast there can now be added _Artibeus_, _Sturnira_ and _Chiroderma_ (as noted above), _Anoura_, _Choeronycteris_ and _Leptonycteris_ (Hall and Kelson, 1959:119, 120, 122; Hoffmeister, 1959:18), and _Liomys_ (Hall and Kelson, 1959:536).  In view of these additional genera, and others that almost certainly remain to be discovered farther north on the west coast, the suggestion by Koopman and Martin (1959:11) that species inhabiting humid tropical habitats, in general extend farther north on the east coast of Mexico than on the west coast may need to be reconsidered. On the west coast, areas of more humid tropical vegetation and climate are more distant from the coastline as one proceeds northwestward from Nayarit to Sonora. The broad band of humid tropical vegetation along the coast is progressively reduced in width, and crowded back against the mountains, and still farther north consists of only small scattered remnants that are difficult to visit, in the bottoms of deep canyons.
