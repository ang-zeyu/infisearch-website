Please?\"  Put that way, I guess it made sense. We found some rubber sheeting in one of the lockers, and began wrapping Hendrix in it; it wasn't pleasant, since he was beginning to soften up from the enzymes he'd absorbed. \"How about going ahead to make sure no one sees us?\" I suggested to Jenny.  Muller opened his mouth, but Jenny gave one of her quick little laughs and opened the door for us. Doc looked relieved. I guessed he was trying to kid himself. Personally, I wasn't a fool--I was just hooked; I knew perfectly well she was busy playing us off against one another, and probably having a good time balancing the books. But hell, that's the way life runs.  \"Get Pietro up here!\" Muller fired after us. She laughed again, and nodded. She went with us until we got to the 'tween-hulls lock, then went off after the chief. She was back with him just as we finished stuffing Hendrix through and sealing up again.  Muller grunted at us when we got back, then turned to Lomax again. The big chemist didn't look happy. He spread his hands toward us, and hunched his shoulders. \"A fifty-times over-dose of chromazone in those tanks--fortunately none in the others. And I can't find a trace of it in the fertilizer chemicals or anywhere else. Somebody deliberately put it into those tanks.\"  \"Why?\" Pietro asked. We'd filled him in with the rough details, but it still made no sense to him.  \"Suppose you tell me, Dr. Pietro,\" Muller suggested. \"Chromazone is a poison most people never heard of. One of the new _scientific_ nuisances.\"  Pietro straightened, and his goatee bristled. \"If you're hinting . . .\"  \"I am _not_ hinting, Dr. Pietro. I'm telling you that I'm confining your group to their quarters until we can clean up this mess, distil the water that's contaminated, and replant. After that, if an investigation shows nothing, I _may_ take your personal bond for the conduct of your people. Right now I'm protecting my ship.\"  \"But captain--\" Jenny began.  Muller managed a smile at her. \"Oh, not you, of course, Jenny. I'll need you here. With Hendrix gone, you're the closest thing we have to a Farmer now.\"         *       *       *       *       *  \"Captain Muller,\" Pietro said sharply. \"Captain, in the words of the historical novelists--drop dead! Dr. Sanderson, I forbid you to leave your quarters so long as anyone else is confined to his. I have ample authority for that.\"  \"Under emergency powers--\" Muller spluttered over it, and Pietro jumped in again before he could finish.  \"Precisely, Captain. Under emergency situations, when passengers aboard a commercial vessel find indications of total irresponsibility or incipient insanity on the part of a ship's officer, they are considered correct in assuming command for the time needed to protect their lives. We were poisoned by food prepared in your kitchen, and were nearly killed by radioactivity through a leak in the engine-room--and no investigation was made. We are now confronted with another situation aimed against our welfare--as the others were wholly aimed at us--and you choose to conduct an investigation against our group only. My only conclusion is that you wish to confine us to quarters so we cannot find your motives for this last outrage. Paul, will you kindly relieve the captain of his position?\"  They were both half right, and mostly wrong. Until it was proved that our group was guilty, Muller couldn't issue an order that was obviously discriminatory and against our personal safety in case there was an attack directed on us. He'd be mustered out of space and into the Lunar Cells for that. But on the other hand, the \"safety for passengers\" clause Pietro was citing applied only in the case of overt, direct and physical danger by an officer to normal passengers. He might be able to weasel it through a court, or he might be found guilty of mutiny. It left me in a pretty position.  Jenny fluttered around. \"Now, now--\" she began.  I cut her off. \"Shut up, Jenny. And you two damned fools cool down. Damn it, we've got an emergency here all right--we may not have air plants enough to live on. Pietro, we can't run the ship--and neither can Muller get through what's obviously a mess that may call for all our help by confining us. Why don't you two go off and fight it out in person?\"  [Illustration]  Surprisingly, Pietro laughed. \"I'm afraid I'd put up a poor showing against the captain, Paul. My apologies, Captain Muller.\"  Muller hesitated, but finally took Pietro's hand, and dropped the issue.  \"We've got enough plants,\" he said, changing the subject. \"We'll have to cut out all smoking and other waste of air. And I'll need Jenny to work the hydroponics, with any help she requires. We've got to get more seeds planted, and fast. Better keep word of this to ourselves. We--\"  A shriek came from Jenny then. She'd been busy at one of the lockers in the chamber. Now she began ripping others open and pawing through things inside rubber-gloves. \"Captain Muller! The seeds! The seeds!\"  Hal took one look, and his face turned gray.         *       *       *       *       *  \"Chromazone,\" he reported. \"Every bag of seed has been filled with a solution of chromazone! They're worthless!\"  \"How long before the plants here will seed?\" Muller asked sharply.  \"Three months,\" Jenny answered. \"Captain Muller, what are we going to do?\"  The dour face settled into grim determination. \"The only sensible thing. Take care of these plants, conserve the air, and squeeze by until we can reseed. And, Dr. Pietro, with your permission, we'll turn about for Earth at once. We can't go on like this. To proceed would be to endanger the life of every man aboard.\"  \"Please, Danton.\" Jenny put her hand on Pietro's arm. \"I know what this all means to you, but--\"  Pietro shook her off. \"It means the captain's trying to get out of the expedition, again. It's five months back to Earth--more, by the time we kill velocity. It's the same to Saturn. And either way, in five months we've got this fixed up, or we're helpless. Permission to return refused, Captain Muller.\"  \"Then if you'll be so good as to return to your own quarters,\" Muller said, holding himself back with an effort that turned his face red, \"we'll start clearing this up. And not a word of this.\"  Napier, Lomax, Pietro and I went back to the scientists' quarters, leaving Muller and Jenny conferring busily. That was at fifteen o'clock. At sixteen o'clock, Pietro issued orders against smoking.  Dinner was at eighteen o'clock. We sat down in silence. I reached for my plate without looking. And suddenly little Phil Riggs was on his feet, raving. \"Whole wheat! Nothing but whole wheat bread! I'm sick of it--sick! I won't--\"  \"Sit down!\" I told him. I'd bitten into one of the rolls on the table. It was white bread, and it was the best the cook had managed so far. There was corn instead of baked beans, and he'd done a fair job of making meat loaf. \"Stop making a fool of yourself, Phil.\"  He slumped back, staring at the white bun into which he'd bitten. \"Sorry. Sorry. It's this air--so stuffy. I can't breathe. I can't see right--\"  Pietro and I exchanged glances, but I guess we weren't surprised. Among intelligent people on a ship of that size, secrets wouldn't keep. They'd all put bits together and got part of the answer. Pietro shrugged, and half stood up to make an announcement.         *       *       *       *       *  \"Beg pardon, sirs.\" We jerked our heads around to see Bullard standing in the doorway.  He was scared stiff, and his words got stuck in his throat. Then he found his voice again. \"I heard as how Hendrix went crazy and poisoned the plants and went and killed himself and we'll all die if we don't find some trick, and what I want to know, please, sirs, is are what they're saying right and you know all kinds of tricks and can you save us because I can't go on like this not knowing and hearing them talking outside the galley and none of them telling me--\"  Lomax cut into his flood of words. \"You'll live, Bullard. Farmer Hendrix did get killed in an accident to some of the plants, but we've still got air enough. Captain Muller has asked the help of a few of us, but it's only a temporary emergency.\"  Bullard stared at him, and slowly some of the fear left his face--though not all of it. He turned and left with a curt bow of his head, while Pietro added a few details that weren't exactly lies to Lomax's hasty cover-up, along with a grateful glance at the chemist. It seemed to work, for the time being--at least enough for Riggs to begin making nasty remarks about cooked paste.  Then the tension began to build again. I don't think any of the crew talked to any of our group. And yet, there seemed to be a chain of rumor that exchanged bits of information. Only the crew could have seen the dead plants being carried down to our refuse breakdown plant; and the fact it was chromazone poisoning must have been deduced from a description by some of our group. At any rate, both groups knew all about it--and a little bit more, as was usual with rumors--by the second day.  Muller should have made the news official, but he only issued an announcement that the danger was over. When Peters, our radioman-navigator, found Sam and Phil Riggs smoking and dressed them down, it didn't make Muller's words seem too convincing. I guessed that Muller had other things on his mind; at least he wasn't in his cabin much, and I didn't see Jenny for two whole days.  My nerves were as jumpy as those of the rest. It isn't too bad cutting out smoking; a man can stand imagining the air is getting stale; but when every unconscious gesture toward cigarettes that aren't there reminds him of the air, and when every imagined stale stench makes him want a cigarette to relax, it gets a little rough.  Maybe that's why I was in a completely rotten mood when I finally did spot Jenny going down the passage, with the tight coveralls she was "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31287"],["title","Turnover Point (#1)"],["body","  *       *       *       *       *  Alone among the stars, _The Luck_ moved across the velvet night. The steady beat of flame from her tubes was a tiny spark of man-made vengeance on the face of the deeps.  From her turnover point, she drove outward toward the spinning Jovian moons. For a short while she could be seen from the EMV Observatory on Callisto, but very soon she faded into the outer darkness.  Much later, the Observatory at Land's End on Triton watched her heading past the gibbous mass of Pluto--out into the interstellar fastnesses.  The thrumming of the jets was still at last. A wild-eyed thing that may once have been a man stared in horror at the fading light of the yellow star far astern.  It had taken Kane time to understand what had happened to him, and now it was too late. Space had taken care of its own. The air in _The Luck_ was growing foul and the food was gone. Death hung in the fetid atmosphere of the tiny control room.  The old man--the boy--the money. They all seemed to spin in a narrowing circle. Kane wanted suddenly to shriek with laughter. A circle. The turnover circle. The full circle that the old man had made instead of the proper half-turn of a turnover. Three hundred sixty degrees instead of one hundred eighty. Three hundred sixty degrees to leave the nose of _The Luck_ pointing outward toward the stars, instead of properly toward the Sun. A full circle to pile G on G until the Jovian moons were missed, and the Uranian moons and Triton, too. _Ad Astra per Ardua...._  With the last fragment of his failing sanity, Kane thought of how Pop Ganlon and the boy must be laughing. He was still thinking that as the long night closed in around him.         *       *       *       *       *"]]]
