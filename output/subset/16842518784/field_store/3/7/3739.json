Any human raised outside of the political traditions that the race inherited from its bloodstained childhood would be as friendly and ready for friendship as I am toward these beings. I could never hurt these pleasant, overgrown bunnies and squirrels.  \"We will do everything we can to make up for ... we will try to help,\" says the bunny, stumbling over the English, but civilized and cordial and kind.  I sit up suddenly, reaching out impulsively to shake his hand. Suddenly frightened he leaps back. All of them step back, glancing behind them as though making sure of the avenue of escape. Their big luminous eyes widen and glance rapidly from me to the doors, frightened.  They must think I am about to leap out of bed and pounce on them and eat them. I am about to laugh and reassure them, about to say that all I want from them is friendship, when I feel a twinge in my abdomen from the sudden motion. I touch it with one hand under the bedclothes.  There is the scar of an incision there, almost healed. An operation. The weakness I am recovering from is more than the weakness of starvation.  For only half a second I do not understand; then I see why they looked ashamed.  They voted the murder of a race.  All the human survivors found have been made sterile. There will be no more humans after we die.  I am frozen, one hand still extended to grasp the hand of the rabbity one, my eyes still searching his expression, reassuring words still half formed.  There will be time for anger or grief later, for now, in this instant, I can understand. They are probably quite right.  We were carnivores.  I know, because, at this moment of hatred, I could kill them all.                                                          --G. A.

That isn't our plan. We're here to grow within ourselves and expand culturally. Not to commercialize a beautiful world like Dream Planet.\"  Atkinson stood unmoving, and Loveral could see the way the man's muscles were tight, like steel springs, and the way his eyes burned deep inside their blackness.  \"We've given you everything you need,\" Loveral explained, trying to adjust the smile on his lips again. \"Everybody has everything they want. But, you see, if you sit there and work and make something that someone else doesn't have, then the whole system is destroyed. Then someone will want what you've made. We'll have jealousy and hatred and fighting. This is the stuff of which wars are made, George. You know that. It starts with small things like this, but it grows. When it does, the structure of our life here will collapse. You wouldn't want that, would you, George?\"  \"Yes!\" Atkinson said, his mouth white at the edges. \"I'd like to see the whole rotten thing collapsed and blown to hell!\"  Loveral's teeth snapped together and his lips grew tight. He could feel a muscle jumping along his neck.  Atkinson looked at him with furious eyes. \"What do you think it's like, living this way? You're busy working twenty-four hours a day, while we wander around this damned prison like the breathing dead. You can feel sweat and aches in your bones from a hard day's work. Sleep is like medicine to you, instead of another stretch of torture. You can forget your own brain for a while by doing something with your hands. You can relax because you can get tired. Not us, by God. Not us!\"  \"I envy you, George,\" Loveral said through his teeth.  \"Oh, like hell you do. You treat us like we were helpless infants. You feed and clothe us and do all our work, and you're so happy you damned near split your guts.\"  \"I'll take that, if you don't mind,\" Loveral said, reaching for the hammer, his voice suddenly icy cold.  Atkinson slammed back against the table. \"No, you won't. You won't take anything more at all. You've taken our spirit and our pride and the strength right out of our spines. You won't take anything more!\"  \"George?\" Loveral said, but not moving any further.  Atkinson slid the hammer back of him onto the table, and his hands were searching among a dozen scattered pieces of metal and wood. He watched Loveral as he worked. \"Let me show you what else I've made,\" he said.  \"I'd hate to do it,\" Loveral said, \"but I can stop your food, your water, everything.\"  Atkinson's hands moved swiftly, assembling the pieces. He nodded. \"You can, but you won't.\"  \"I have the only keys to the storage units. I control everything, George.\"  \"Correction,\" said Atkinson, holding an assembled revolver in his hands. \"You _did_.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Loveral looked at what Atkinson had in his hands. He blinked.  \"You're nearly dead,\" Atkinson said.  Loveral looked at Atkinson, into his eyes. \"If you wanted to kill me, you could have done it some other way.\"  Atkinson shook his head. \"Just this way. Just with something that took me dozens of days and nights to make. With something that made me sweat and swear to get. It was difficult--with no tools or proper materials--but that made it all the better. Now I've got it finished,\" he said, pushing a bullet into the chamber, \"and ready to use.\"  Loveral stood frozen, then he turned. \"My dear,\" he said to the woman who moved her mouth as though her voice had been pumped out of her. He reached to touch her shoulder. She recoiled, as though his fingers held poison. \"George,\" he said, turning back to the black-eyed man.  \"This is a great moment,\" Atkinson said, lifting the muzzle of the revolver. \"When I squeeze the trigger, it'll be like blowing the lock off a prison door. I'll go yelling to the others, and we'll smash down the whole goddamned place. We'll smash it down, so we'll have to rebuild it. We'll pull apart every robot you've got. We'll tear apart the food lockers and have a celebration for a week, and when we've gotten sick from too much food, we'll start growing some more with our own hands. We'll make forges for the men and looms for the women. We'll burn our clothes and make new ones. We'll grow corn in the fields. We'll pump water from the ground. You're finished, Loveral.\"  Loveral stared at the revolver. \"George,\" he said, pleading. \"The plans. The beautiful, beautiful plans. All of you, you all wanted peace and contentment. Time to think and dream. You all wanted to get away from the work and the worry and the responsibility. You--\"  Atkinson fired the gun into Loveral's stomach.  Loveral gestured at the air and fell to his knees. Atkinson threw his gun through a window and grabbed his wife by the hand. \"Hurry!\" he said, laughing. \"Hurry!\"  Loveral felt of the blood on his shirt and rested on his knees. He could hear footsteps, racing through the house and out to the yard. He held out his bloody hand and looked at it. Atkinson's voice pealed through the warm clear air. \"He's dead! Loveral's dead!\"  There was a sound of sudden activity, and everywhere went the cry, \"Loveral's dead!\"  Loveral sank to his haunches and opened his lips. The blood was there, too. He could hear the shouts and the laughter, and then the tearing of steel, the smashing of glass. He bent over his knees, trembling with a sudden chill. The sound of destruction grew like thunder. \"Why?\" he said in his dying throat. \"Oh, why? It was what they said they wanted.\"   THE END     Transcriber's Note:      This etext was produced from _If Worlds of Science Fiction_     September 1953.
