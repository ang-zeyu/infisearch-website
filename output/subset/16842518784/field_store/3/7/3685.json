On the second of the two days, as he was returning from the village store with an orange for his mother, he was overtaken by Sam Pomeroy.  “Is your mother very sick, Frank?” he asked.  “Yes, Sam, I’m afraid she won’t live.”  “Is it so bad as that? I do believe,” he added, with a sudden change of tone, “Tom Pinkerton is the meanest boy I ever knew. He is trying to get your place as captain of the baseball club. He says that if your mother doesn’t live, you will have to go to the poorhouse, for you won’t have any money, and that it will be a disgrace for the club to have a captain from the poorhouse.”  “Did he say that?” asked Frank, indignantly.  “Yes.”  “When he tells you that, you may say that I shall never go to the poorhouse.”  “He says his father is going to put you and your sister there.”  “All the Deacon Pinkertons in the world can never make me go to the poorhouse!” said Frank, resolutely.  “Bully for you, Frank! I knew you had spunk.”  Frank hurried home. As he entered the little house a neighbor’s wife, who had been watching with his mother, came to meet him.  “Frank,” she said, gravely, “you must prepare yourself for sad news. While you were out your mother had another hemorrhage, and--and--”  “Is she dead?” asked the boy, his face very pale.  “She is dead!”    CHAPTER IV  THE TOWN AUTOCRAT   “The Widder Fowler is dead,” remarked Deacon Pinkerton, at the supper table. “She died this afternoon.”  “I suppose she won’t leave anything,” said Mrs. Pinkerton.  “No. I hold a mortgage on her furniture, and that is all she has.”  “What will become of the children?”  “As I observed, day before yesterday, they will be constrained to find a refuge in the poorhouse.”  “What do you think Sam Pomeroy told me, father?”  “I am not able to conjecture what Samuel would be likely to observe, my son.”  “He observed that Frank Fowler said he wouldn’t go to the poorhouse.”  “Ahem!” coughed the deacon. “The boy will not be consulted.”  “That’s what I say, father,” said Tom, who desired to obtain his father’s co-operation. “You’ll make him go to the poorhouse, won’t you?”  “I shall undoubtedly exercise my authority, if it should be necessary, my son.”  “He told Sam Pomeroy that all the Deacon Pinkertons in the world couldn’t make him go to the poorhouse.”  “I will constrain him,” said the deacon.  “I would if I were you, father,” said Tom, elated at the effect of his words. “Just teach him a lesson.”  “Really, deacon, you mustn’t be too hard upon the poor boy,” said his better-hearted wife. “He’s got trouble enough on him.”  “I will only constrain him for his good, Jane. In the poorhouse he will be well provided for.”  Meanwhile another conversation respecting our hero and his fortunes was held at Sam Pomeroy’s home. It was not as handsome as the deacon’s, for Mr. Pomeroy was a poor man, but it was a happy one, nevertheless, and Mr. Pomeroy, limited as were his means, was far more liberal than the deacon.  “I pity Frank Fowler,” said Sam, who was warm-hearted and sympathetic, and a strong friend of Frank. “I don’t know what he will do.”  “I suppose his mother left nothing.”  “I understood,” said Mr. Pomeroy, “that Deacon Pinkerton holds a mortgage on her furniture.”  “The deacon wants to send Frank and his sister to the poorhouse.”  “That would be a pity.”  “I should think so; but Frank positively says he won’t go.”  “I am afraid there isn’t anything else for him. To be sure, he may get a chance to work in a shop or on a farm, but Grace can’t support herself.”  “Father, I want to ask you a favor.”  “What is it, Sam?”  “Won’t you invite Frank and his sister to come and stay here a week?”  “Just as your mother says.”  “I say yes. The poor children will be quite welcome. If we were rich enough they might stay with us all the time.”  “When Frank comes here I will talk over his affairs with him,” said Mr. Pomeroy. “Perhaps we can think of some plan for him.”  “I wish you could, father.”  “In the meantime, you can invite him and Grace to come and stay with us a week, or a fortnight. Shall we say a fortnight, wife?”  “With all my heart.”  “All right, father. Thank you.”  Sam delivered the invitation in a way that showed how strongly his own feelings were enlisted in favor of its acceptance. Frank grasped his hand.  “Thank you, Sam, you are a true friend,” he said.  “I hadn’t begun to think of what we were to do, Grace and I.”  “You’ll come, won’t you?”  “You are sure that it won’t trouble your mother, Sam?”  “She is anxious to have you come.”  “Then I’ll come. I haven’t formed any plans yet, but I must as soon--as soon as mother is buried. I think I can earn my living somehow. One thing I am determined about--I won’t go to the poorhouse.”  The funeral was over. Frank and Grace walked back to the little house, now their home no longer. They were to pack up a little bundle of clothes and go over to Mr. Pomeroy’s in time for supper.  When Frank had made up his bundle, urged by some impulse, he opened a drawer in his mother’s bureau. His mind was full of the story she had told him, and he thought it just possible that he might find something to throw additional light upon his past history. While exploring the contents of the drawer he came to a letter directed to him in his mother’s well-known handwriting. He opened it hastily, and with a feeling of solemnity, read as follows:   “My Dear Frank: In the lower drawer, wrapped in a piece of brown paper, you will find two gold eagles, worth twenty dollars. You will need them when I am gone. Use them for Grace and yourself. I saved these for my children. Take them, Frank, for I have nothing else to give you. The furniture will pay the debt I owe Deacon Pinkerton. There ought to be something over, but I think he will take all. I wish I had more to leave you, dear Frank, but the God of the Fatherless will watch over you--to Him I commit you and Grace.  “Your affectionate mother,  “RUTH FOWLER.”   Frank, following the instructions of the letter, found the gold pieces and put them carefully into his pocketbook. He did not mention the letter to Grace at present, for he knew not but Deacon Pinkerton might lay claim to the money to satisfy his debt if he knew it.  “I am ready, Frank,” said Grace, entering the room. “Shall we go?”  “Yes, Grace. There is no use in stopping here any longer.”  As he spoke he heard the outer door open, and a minute later Deacon Pinkerton entered the room.  None of the deacon’s pompousness was abated as he entered the house and the room.  “Will you take a seat?” said our hero, with the air of master of the house.  “I intended to,” said the deacon, not acknowledging his claim. “So your poor mother is gone?”  “Yes, sir,” said Frank, briefly.  “We must all die,” said the deacon, feeling that it was incumbent on him to say something religious. “Ahem! your mother died poor? She left no property?”  “It was not her fault.”  “Of course not. Did she mention that I had advanced her money on the furniture?”  “My mother told me all about it, sir.”  “Ahem! You are in a sad condition. But you will be taken care of. You ought to be thankful that there is a home provided for those who have no means.”  “What home do you refer to, Deacon Pinkerton?” asked Frank, looking steadily in the face of his visitor.  “I mean the poorhouse, which the town generously provides for those who cannot support themselves.”  This was the first intimation Grace had received of the possibility that they would be sent to such a home, and it frightened her.  “Oh, Frank!” she exclaimed, “must we go to the poorhouse?”  “No, Grace; don’t be frightened,” said Frank, soothingly. “We will not go.”  “Frank Fowler,” said the deacon, sternly, “cease to mislead your sister.”  “I am not misleading her, sir.”  “Did you not tell her that she would not be obliged to go to the poorhouse?”  “Yes, sir.”  “Then what do you mean by resisting my authority?”  “You have no authority over us. We are not paupers,” and Frank lifted his head proudly, and looked steadily in the face of the deacon.  “You are paupers, whether you admit it or not.”  “We are not,” said the boy, indignantly.  “Where is your money? Where is your property?”  “Here, sir,” said our hero, holding out his hands.  “I have two strong hands, and they will help me make a living for my sister and myself.”  “May I ask whether you expect to live here and use my furniture?”  “I do not intend to, sir. I shall ask no favors of you, neither for Grace nor myself. I am going to leave the house. I only came back to get a few clothes. Mr. Pomeroy has invited Grace and me to stay at his house for a few days. I haven’t decided what I shall do afterward.”  “You will have to go to the poorhouse, then. I have no objection to your making this visit first. It will be a saving to the town.”  “Then, sir, we will bid you good-day. Grace, let us go.”    CHAPTER V  A LITTLE MISUNDERSTANDING   “Have you carried Frank Fowler to the poorhouse?” asked Tom Pinkerton, eagerly, on his father’s return.  “No,” said the deacon, “he is going to make a visit at Mr. Pomeroy’s first.”  “I shouldn’t think you would have let him make a visit,” said Tom, discontentedly. “I should think you would have taken him to the poorhouse right off.”  “I feel it my duty to save the town unnecessary expense,” said Deacon Pinkerton.  So Tom was compelled to rest satisfied with his father’s assurance that the removal was only deferred.  Meanwhile Frank and Grace received a cordial welcome at the house of Mr. Pomeroy. Sam and Frank were intimate friends, and our hero had been in the habit of calling frequently, and it seemed homelike.  “I wish you could stay with us all the time, Frank--you and Grace,” said Sam one evening.  “We should all like it,” said Mr. Pomeroy, “but we cannot always have what we want. If I had it in my power to offer Frank any employment which it would be worth his while to follow, it might do. But he has got his way to make in the world. Have you formed any plans yet, Frank?”  “That "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/29608"],["title","Personal Recollections of a Cavalryman (#1)"],["body","its great struggle more united than ever. The sections had learned to respect each other's prowess and to know each other's virtues. The cement that bound the union of states was no longer like wax to be melted by the fervent heat of political strifes. It had been tested and tempered in the fiery furnace of civil war. The history of that war often has been written. Much has been written that is not history. But whether fact or fiction, the story is read with undiminished interest as the years rush by.  One story there is that has not been told, at least not all of it; nor will it be until the last of those who took part in that great drama shall have gone over to the silent majority. It is the story of the individual experiences of the men who stood in the ranks, or of the officers who held no high rank; who knew little of plans and strategy, but bore their part of the burden and obeyed orders. There was no army, no corps, no division, brigade, or regiment, scarcely a battery, troop, or company, which went through that struggle, or a soldier who served in the field \"for three years or during the war,\" whose experiences did not differ from any other, whose history would not contain many features peculiar to itself or himself. Two regiments in the same command, two soldiers in the same regiment, might get entirely different impressions of the battle in which both participated. Two equally truthful accounts might vary greatly in their details. What one saw, another might not see, and each could judge correctly only of what he, himself, witnessed. This fact accounts, in part, for the many contradictions, which are not contradictions, in the \"annals of the war.\" The witnesses did not occupy the same standpoint. They were looking at different parts of the same panorama. Oftentimes they are like the two knights who slew each other in a quarrel about the color of a shield. One said it was red, the other declared it was green. Both were right, for it was red on one side and green on the other.  On such flimsy pretexts do men and nations wage war. Why then wonder if historians differ also? In the \"Wilderness,\" each man's view was bounded by a very narrow horizon and few knew what was going on outside their range of vision. What was true of the \"Wilderness\" was true of nearly every battle fought between the union and confederate forces. No picture of a battle, whether it be painted in words or in colors, can bring into the perspective more than a glimpse of the actual field. No man could possibly have been stationed where he could see it all. Hence it came to pass that many a private soldier knew things which the corps commander did not know; and saw things which others did not see. The official reports, for the most part, furnish but a bare outline and are often misleading. The details may be put in by an infinite number of hands, and those features that seen separately appear incongruous, when blended will form a perfect picture. But it must be seen, like a panorama, in parts, for no single eye could take in, at once, all the details in a picture of a battle.  In the winter of 1855-56, while engaged as assistant factotum in a general lumbering and mercantile business in the pine woods of Northern Michigan, one of my functions was that of assistant postmaster, which led to getting up a \"club\" for the New York Weekly Tribune, the premium for which was an extra copy for myself. The result was that in due time my mind was imbued with the principles of Horace Greeley.  The boys who read the Tribune in the fifties were being unconsciously molded into the men, who, a few years later, rushed to the rescue of their country's flag. The seed sown by Horace Greeley, and others like him, brought forth a rich crop of loyalty, of devotion and self-sacrifice that was garnered in the war.  In the latter part of the year 1860, the air was full of threatenings. The country was clearly on the verge of civil war, and the feeling almost as intense as it was in the following April, after the flash of Edmund Ruffin's gun had fired the Northern heart.  In October, I came a freshman into the University of Michigan, in Ann Arbor. That noble institution was, even then, the pride of the Peninsula state. A superb corps of instructors, headed by Henry P. Tappan, the noblest Roman of them all, smoothed the pathway to learning which a thousand young men were trying to tread. These boys were full of life, vigor, ambition and energy. They were from various parts of the country, though but few were from the Southern States. The atmosphere of the place was wholesome, and calculated to develop a robust, courageous manhood. The students were led to study the best antique models, and to emulate the heroic traits of character in the great men of modern times. It may be said that nowhere in the land did the fires of patriotism burn with more fervent heat, during the eventful and exciting period that preceded by a few months the inauguration of Abraham Lincoln.  The young men took a deep interest in the political campaign of that year, and watched with eager faces for every item of news that pertained to it.  The nomination of Abraham Lincoln was a bitter disappointment to the young Republicans of Michigan. Seward was their idol and their ideal, and when the news came of his defeat in the Chicago convention, many men shed tears, who later learned to love the very ground on which the Illinois \"Railsplitter\" stood; and who today cherish his memory with the same reverential respect which they feel for that of Washington.  During that memorable campaign, Seward spoke in Detroit and scores of students went from Ann Arbor to hear him. He did not impress one as a great orator. He was of slight frame, but of a noble and intellectual cast of countenance. His arguments were convincing, his language well-chosen, but he was somewhat lacking in the physical attributes so essential to perfect success as a public speaker. His features were very marked, with a big nose, a firm jaw, a lofty forehead, and a skin almost colorless. He had been the choice of Michigan for president and was received with the warmest demonstrations of respect and enthusiasm. Every word that fell from his lips was eagerly caught up by the great multitude. It was a proud day for him, and his heart must have been touched by the abounding evidences of affection.  Seward was looked upon as the embodiment of sagacious statesmanship and political prescience, but how far he fell short of comprehending the real magnitude of the crisis then impending, was shown by his prediction that the war would last but ninety days. His famous dictum about the \"irrepressible conflict\" did him more credit.  That same year, Salmon P. Chase also spoke in Michigan. There were giants in those days. Chase was not at all like Seward in his appearance. Tall and of commanding figure, he was a man of perfect physique. He had an expressive face and an excellent voice, well adapted to out-door speaking. In manner, he appeared somewhat pompous, and the impression he left on the mind of the listener was not so agreeable as that retained of the great New Yorker.  At some time during the summer of 1860, Stephen A. Douglas passed through Michigan over the Central Railroad. His train stopped at all stations and hundreds of students flocked to see and hear him. He came off the car to a temporary platform, and for twenty minutes, that sea of faces gazing at him with rapt attention, talked with great rapidity, but with such earnestness and force as to enchain the minds of his hearers. His remarks were in part stereotyped, and he made much of his well-worn argument about the right of the territories to \"regulate their own domestic institutions in their own way, subject only to the constitution.\" In manner, he was easy and graceful, in appearance, striking. He spoke with no apparent effort. Of massive frame, though short in stature, after the manner of General Sheridan, his head was large and set off by a luxuriant growth of hair that served to enhance its apparent size. His face was smooth, full and florid, the hue rather suggestive. His countenance and bearing indicated force, courage and tenacity of purpose. I was not surprised when he announced that he was on the side of the Union, and believe that, had he lived, he would have been, like Logan, a great soldier and a loyal supporter of Lincoln. He was a patriot of the purest type and one of the ablest men of his time.  A significant incident of the winter of 1860-61, seems worth recalling. That period was one of the most intense excitement. What with the secession of the Southern States, the resignation of Senators and Members of Congress, and the vacillating course of the Buchanan administration, the outlook was gloomy in the extreme. There were in the University a number of students from the South, and they kept their trunks packed ready to leave at a moment's notice. Party feeling ran high, and the tension was painful. William Lloyd Garrison came to Ann Arbor to speak and could not get a hall, but finally succeeded in securing a building used for a school-house, in the lower part of the town. Here he was set upon by a lot of roughs, who interrupted him with cat-calls and hisses, and made demonstrations so threatening, that, to avoid bodily injury, he was compelled to make his exit through a window. The affair was laid to the students, and some of them were engaged in it, to their discredit, be it said. It was not safe for an \"Abolitionist\" to free his mind even in the \"Athens\" of Michigan. Harper's Weekly published an illustrative cut of the scene, and Ann Arbor achieved an unenviable notoriety.  One day all hands went to the train to see the Prince of Wales, who was to pass through, on his way to Chicago. There was much curiosity to see the queen's son. He had been treated with distinguished consideration in the East and was going to take a look at the Western metropolis. There was a "]]]
