I fear we'll soon both sputter on the coals.\"  Cappen said nothing. If she wanted to think he had come especially to rescue her, he would not be so ungallant to tell her otherwise.  The troll-wife's mouth gashed in a grin as she walked through the fire to him. \"There is a price,\" she said. \"If you cannot tell me three things about myself which are true beyond disproving, not courage nor amulet nor the gods themselves may avail to keep that red head on your shoulders.\"  Cappen clapped a hand to his sword. \"Why, gladly,\" he said; this was a rule of magic he had learned long ago, that three truths were the needful armor to make any guardian charm work. \"Imprimis, yours is the ugliest nose I ever saw poking up a fire. Secundus, I was never in a house I cared less to guest at. Tertius, ever among trolls you are little liked, being one of the worst.\"  Hildigund moaned with terror as the monster swelled in rage. But there was no movement. Only the leaping flames and the eddying smoke stirred.  Cappen's voice rang out, coldly: \"Now the king lies on the sea, frozen and wet, and I am come to fetch a brand for his fire. And I had best also see his daughter home.\"  The troll shook her head, suddenly chuckling. \"No. The brand you may have, just to get you out of this cave, foulness; but the woman is in my thrall until a man sleeps with her--here--for a night. And if he does, I may have him to break my fast in the morning!\"  Cappen yawned mightily. \"Thank you, mother. Your offer of a bed is most welcome to these tired bones, and I accept gratefully.\"  \"You will die tomorrow!\" she raved. The ground shook under the huge weight of her as she stamped. \"Because of the three truths, I must let you go tonight; but tomorrow I may do what I will!\"  \"Forget not my little friend, mother,\" said Cappen, and touched the cord of the amulet.  \"I tell you, silver has no use against me--\"  Cappen sprawled on the floor and rippled fingers across his harp. \"_A lovely lady full oft lies--_\"  The troll-wife turned from him in a rage. Hildigund ladled up some broth, saying nothing, and Cappen ate it with pleasure, though it could have used more seasoning.  After that he indited a sonnet to the princess, who regarded him wide-eyed. The troll came back from a tunnel after he finished, and said curtly: \"This way.\" Cappen took the girl's hand and followed her into a pitchy, reeking dark.  She plucked an arras aside to show a room which surprised him by being hung with tapestries, lit with candles, and furnished with a fine broad featherbed. \"Sleep here tonight, if you dare,\" she growled. \"And tomorrow I shall eat you--and you, worthless lazy she-trash, will have the hide flayed off your back!\" She barked a laugh and left them.  Hildigund fell weeping on the mattress. Cappen let her cry herself out while he undressed and got between the blankets. Drawing his sword, he laid it carefully in the middle of the bed.  The girl looked at him through jumbled fair locks. \"How can ye dare?\" she whispered. \"One breath of fear, one moment's doubt, and the troll is free to rend ye.\"  \"Exactly.\" Cappen yawned. \"Doubtless she hopes that fear will come to me lying wakeful in the night. Wherefore 'tis but a question of going gently to sleep. O Svearek, Torbek, and Beorna, could you but see how I am resting now!\"  \"But ... the three truths ye gave her ... how knew ye...?\"  \"Oh, those. Well, see you, sweet lady, Primus and Secundus were my own thoughts, and who is to disprove them? Tertius was also clear, since you said there had been no company here in three years--yet are there many trolls in these lands, ergo even they cannot stomach our gentle hostess.\" Cappen watched her through heavy-lidded eyes.  She flushed deeply, blew out the candles, and he heard her slip off her garment and get in with him. There was a long silence.  Then: \"Are ye not--\"  \"Yes, fair one?\" he muttered through his drowsiness.  \"Are ye not ... well, I am here and ye are here and--\"  \"Fear not,\" he said. \"I laid my sword between us. Sleep in peace.\"  \"I ... would be glad--ye have come to deliver--\"  \"No, fair lady. No man of gentle breeding could so abuse his power. Goodnight.\" He leaned over, brushing his lips gently across hers, and lay down again.  \"Ye are ... I never thought man could be so noble,\" she whispered.  Cappen mumbled something. As his soul spun into sleep, he chuckled. Those unresting days and nights on the sea had not left him fit for that kind of exercise. But, of course, if she wanted to think he was being magnanimous, it could be useful later--         *       *       *       *       *  He woke with a start and looked into the sputtering glare of a torch. Its light wove across the crags and gullies of the troll-wife's face and shimmered wetly off the great tusks in her mouth.  \"Good morning, mother,\" said Cappen politely.  Hildigund thrust back a scream.  \"Come and be eaten,\" said the troll-wife.  \"No, thank you,\" said Cappen, regretfully but firmly. \"'Twould be ill for my health. No, I will but trouble you for a firebrand and then the princess and I will be off.\"  \"If you think that stupid bit of silver will protect you, think again,\" she snapped. \"Your three sentences were all that saved you last night. Now I hunger.\"  \"Silver,\" said Cappen didactically, \"is a certain shield against all black magics. So the wizard told me, and he was such a nice white-bearded old man I am sure even his attendant devils never lied. Now please depart, mother, for modesty forbids me to dress before your eyes.\"  The hideous face thrust close to his. He smiled dreamily and tweaked her nose--hard.  She howled and flung the torch at him. Cappen caught it and stuffed it into her mouth. She choked and ran from the room.  \"A new sport--trollbaiting,\" said the bard gaily into the sudden darkness. \"Come, shall we not venture out?\"  The girl trembled too much to move. He comforted her, absentmindedly, and dressed in the dark, swearing at the clumsy leggings. When he left, Hildigund put on her clothes and hurried after him.  The troll-wife squatted by the fire and glared at them as they went by. Cappen hefted his sword and looked at her. \"I do not love you,\" he said mildly, and hewed out.  She backed away, shrieking as he slashed at her. In the end, she crouched at the mouth of a tunnel, raging futilely. Cappen pricked her with his blade.  \"It is not worth my time to follow you down underground,\" he said, \"but if ever you trouble men again, I will hear of it and come and feed you to my dogs. A piece at a time--a very small piece--do you understand?\"  She snarled at him.  \"An _extremely_ small piece,\" said Cappen amiably. \"Have you heard me?\"  Something broke in her. \"Yes,\" she whimpered. He let her go, and she scuttled from him like a rat.  He remembered the firewood and took an armful; on the way, he thoughtfully picked up a few jeweled rings which he didn't think she would be needing and stuck them in his pouch. Then he led the girl outside.  The wind had laid itself, a clear frosty morning glittered on the sea and the longship was a distant sliver against white-capped blueness. The minstrel groaned. \"What a distance to row! Oh, well--\"         *       *       *       *       *  They were at sea before Hildigund spoke. Awe was in the eyes that watched him. \"No man could be so brave,\" she murmured. \"Are ye a god?\"  \"Not quite,\" said Cappen. \"No, most beautiful one, modesty grips my tongue. 'Twas but that I had the silver and was therefore proof against her sorcery.\"  \"But the silver was no help!\" she cried.  Cappen's oar caught a crab. \"What?\" he yelled.  \"No--no--why, she told ye so her own self--\"  \"I thought she lied. I _know_ the silver guards against--\"  \"But she used no magic! Trolls have but their own strength!\"  Cappen sagged in his seat. For a moment he thought he was going to faint. Then only his lack of fear had armored him; and if he had known the truth, that would not have lasted a minute.  He laughed shakily. Another score for his doubts about the overall value of truth!  The longship's oars bit water and approached him. Indignant voices asking why he had been so long on his errand faded when his passenger was seen. And Svearek the king wept as he took his daughter back into his arms.  The hard brown face was still blurred with tears when he looked at the minstrel, but the return of his old self was there too. \"What ye have done, Cappen Varra of Croy, is what no other man in the world could have done.\"  \"Aye--aye--\" The rough northern voices held adoration as the warriors crowded around the slim red-haired figure.  \"Ye shall have her whom ye saved to wife,\" said Svearek, \"and when I die ye shall rule all Norren.\"  Cappen swayed and clutched the rail.  Three nights later he slipped away from their shore camp and turned his face southward.     Transcriber's Note:      This etext was produced from _Fantastic Universe_ January 1957.

Three more natives bounded forward, their knives held high. They tumbled to the ground also. Fannia stopped and watched as a platoon of natives advanced on them.  Once they were within stabbing range of the Earthmen, the natives were slitting their own throats!  Fannia was frozen for a moment, unable to believe his eyes. Donnaught halted behind him.  Natives were rushing forward by the hundreds now, their knives poised, screaming at the Earthmen. As they came within range, each native stabbed himself, tumbling on a quickly growing pile of bodies. In minutes the Earthmen were surrounded by a heap of bleeding Cascellan flesh, which was steadily growing higher.  \"All right!\" Fannia shouted. \"Stop it.\" He yanked Donnaught back with him, to profane ground. \"Truce!\" he yelled in Cascellan.  The crowd parted and the chief was carried through. With two knives clenched in his fists, he was panting from excitement.  \"We have won the first battle!\" he said proudly. \"The might of our warriors frightens even such aliens as yourselves. You shall not profane our temple while a man is alive on Cascella!\"  The natives shouted their approval and triumph.  The two aliens dazedly stumbled back to their ship.         *       *       *       *       *  \"So that's what Galactic meant by 'a unique social structure,'\" Fannia said morosely. He stripped off his armor and lay down on his bunk. \"Their way of making war is to suicide their enemies into capitulation.\"  \"They must be nuts,\" Donnaught grumbled. \"That's no way to fight.\"  \"It works, doesn't it?\" Fannia got up and stared out a porthole. The sun was setting, painting the city a charming red in its glow. The beams of light glistened off the spire of the Galactic cache. Through the open doorway they could hear the boom and rattle of drums. \"Tribal call to arms,\" Fannia said.  \"I still say it's crazy.\" Donnaught had some definite ideas on fighting. \"It ain't human.\"  \"I'll buy that. The idea seems to be that if enough people slaughter themselves, the enemy gives up out of sheer guilty conscience.\"  \"What if the enemy doesn't give up?\"  \"Before these people united, they must have fought it out tribe to tribe, suiciding until someone gave up. The losers probably joined the victors; the tribe must have grown until it could take over the planet by sheer weight of numbers.\" Fannia looked carefully at Donnaught, trying to see if he understood. \"It's anti-survival, of course; if someone didn't give up, the race would probably kill themselves.\" He shook his head. \"But war of any kind is anti-survival. Perhaps they've got rules.\"  \"Couldn't we just barge in and grab the fuel quick?\" Donnaught asked. \"And get out before they all killed themselves?\"  \"I don't think so,\" Fannia said. \"They might go on committing suicide for the next ten years, figuring they were still fighting us.\" He looked thoughtfully at the city. \"It's that chief of theirs. He's their god and he'd probably keep them suiciding until he was the only man left. Then he'd grin, say, 'We are great warriors,' and kill himself.\"  Donnaught shrugged his big shoulders in disgust. \"Why don't we knock him off?\"  \"They'd just elect another god.\" The sun was almost below the horizon now. \"I've got an idea, though,\" Fannia said. He scratched his head. \"It might work. All we can do is try.\"         *       *       *       *       *  At midnight, the two men sneaked out of the ship, moving silently into the city. They were both dressed in space armor again. Donnaught carried two empty fuel cans. Fannia had his paralyzer out.  The streets were dark and silent as they slid along walls and around posts, keeping out of sight. A native turned a corner suddenly, but Fannia paralyzed him before he could make a sound.  They crouched in the darkness, in the mouth of an alley facing the cache.  \"Have you got it straight?\" Fannia asked. \"I paralyze the guards. You bolt in and fill up those cans. We get the hell out of here, quick. When they check, they find the cans still there. Maybe they won't commit suicide then.\"  The men moved across the shadowy steps in front of the cache. There were three Cascellans guarding the entrance, their knives stuck in their loincloths. Fannia stunned them with a medium charge, and Donnaught broke into a run.  Torches instantly flared, natives boiled out of every alleyway, shouting, waving their knives.  \"We've been ambushed!\" Fannia shouted. \"Get back here, Donnaught!\"  Donnaught hurriedly retreated. The natives had been waiting for them. Screaming, yowling, they rushed at the Earthmen, slitting their own throats at five-foot range. Bodies tumbled in front of Fannia, almost tripping him as he backed up. Donnaught caught him by an arm and yanked him straight. They ran out of the sacred area.  \"Truce, damn it!\" Fannia called out. \"Let me speak to the chief. Stop it! Stop it! I want a truce!\"  Reluctantly, the Cascellans stopped their slaughter.  \"This is war,\" the chief said, striding forward. His almost human face was stern under the torchlight. \"You have seen our warriors. You know now that you cannot stand against them. The word has spread to all our lands. My entire people are prepared to do battle.\"  He looked proudly at his fellow-Cascellans, then back to the Earthmen. \"I myself will lead my people into battle now. There will be no stopping us. We will fight until you surrender yourselves completely, stripping off your armor.\"  \"Wait, Chief,\" Fannia panted, sick at the sight of so much blood. The clearing was a scene out of the Inferno. Hundreds of bodies were sprawled around. The streets were muddy with blood.  \"Let me confer with my partner tonight. I will speak with you tomorrow.\"  \"No,\" the chief said. \"You started the battle. It must go to its conclusion. Brave men wish to die in battle. It is our fondest wish. You are the first enemy we have had in many years, since we subdued the mountain tribes.\"  \"Sure,\" Fannia said. \"But let's talk about it--\"  \"I myself will fight you,\" the chief said, holding up a dagger. \"I will die for my people, as a warrior must!\"  \"Hold it!\" Fannia shouted. \"Grant us a truce. We are allowed to fight only by sunlight. It is a tribal taboo.\"  The chief thought for a moment, then said, \"Very well. Until tomorrow.\"  The beaten Earthmen walked slowly back to their ship amid the jeers of the victorious populace.         *       *       *       *       *  Next morning, Fannia still didn't have a plan. He knew that he had to have fuel; he wasn't planning on spending the rest of his life on Cascella, or waiting until the Galactic Survey sent another ship, in fifty years or so. On the other hand, he hesitated at the idea of being responsible for the death of anywhere up to three billion people. It wouldn't be a very good record to take to Thetis. The Galactic Survey might find out about it. Anyway, he just wouldn't do it.  He was stuck both ways.  Slowly, the two men walked out to meet the chief. Fannia was still searching wildly for an idea while listening to the drums booming.  \"If there was only someone we could fight,\" Donnaught mourned, looking at his useless blasters.  \"That's the deal,\" Fannia said. \"Guilty conscience is making sinners of us all, or something like that. They expect us to give in before the carnage gets out of hand.\" He considered for a moment. \"It's not so crazy, actually. On Earth, armies don't usually fight until every last man is slaughtered on one side. Someone surrenders when they've had enough.\"  \"If they'd just fight _us_!\"  \"Yeah, if they only--\" He stopped. \"We'll fight each other!\" he said. \"These people look at suicide as war. Wouldn't they look upon war--real fighting--as suicide?\"  \"What good would that do us?\" Donnaught asked.  They were coming into the city now and the streets were lined with armed natives. Around the city there were thousands more. Natives were filling the plain, as far as the eye could see. Evidently they had responded to the drums and were here to do battle with the aliens.  Which meant, of course, a wholesale suicide.  \"Look at it this way,\" Fannia said. \"If a guy plans on suiciding on Earth, what do we do?\"  \"Arrest him?\" Donnaught asked.  \"Not at first. We offer him anything he wants, if he just won't do it. People offer the guy money, a job, their daughters, anything, just so he won't do it. It's taboo on Earth.\"  \"So?\"  \"So,\" Fannia went on, \"maybe fighting is just as taboo here. Maybe they'll offer us fuel, if we'll just stop.\"  Donnaught looked dubious, but Fannia felt it was worth a try.         *       *       *       *       *  They pushed their way through the crowded city, to the entrance of the cache. The chief was waiting for them, beaming on his people like a jovial war god.  \"Are you ready to do battle?\" he asked. \"Or to surrender?\"  \"Sure,\" Fannia said. \"Now, Donnaught!\"  He swung, and his mailed fist caught Donnaught in the ribs. Donnaught blinked.  \"Come on, you idiot, hit me back.\"  Donnaught swung, and Fannia staggered from the force of the blow. In a second they were at it like a pair of blacksmiths, mailed blows ringing from their armored hides.  \"A little lighter,\" Fannia gasped, picking himself up from the ground. \"You're denting my ribs.\" He belted Donnaught viciously on the helmet.  \"Stop it!\" the chief cried. \"This is disgusting!\"  \"It's working,\" Fannia panted. \"Now let me strangle you. I think that might do it.\"  Donnaught obliged by falling to the ground. Fannia clamped both hands around Donnaught's armored neck, and squeezed.  \"Make believe you're in agony, idiot,\" he said.  Donnaught groaned and moaned as convincingly as he could.  \"You must stop!\" the chief screamed. \"It is terrible to kill another!\"  \"Then let me get some fuel,\" Fannia said, tightening his grip on Donnaught's throat.  The chief thought it over for a little while. Then he shook his head.  \"No.\"  \"What?\"  \"You are aliens. If you want to do this"]]]
