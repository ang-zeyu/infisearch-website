He was invariably dressed in a suit of the most spotless black, as if going to a dinner party; his white neckcloth was fresh from the laundress's hands, and his hat shining like a racer's coat. He advanced to the arm-chair prepared for him in the centre of the writing-table, laid his hat on the left-hand corner; his snuff-box was deposited on the same side beside the quire of paper placed in readiness for his use, and dipping the pen twice into the ink-bottle, then bringing it to within an inch of his nose, to make sure it was properly filled, he broke silence: \"We have said that the chord AB,\" etc. For three quarters of an hour he continued his demonstration, making short notes as he went on, to guide the listener in repeating the problem alone; then, taking up another cahier which lay beside him, he went over the written repetition of the former lesson. He explained, corrected, or commented till the clock struck nine; then, with the little finger of the right hand brushing from his coat and waistcoat the shower of superfluous snuff which had fallen on them, he pocketed his snuff-box, and resuming his hat, he as silently as when he came in made his exit by the door which I rushed to open for him.'  In 1842, as we have said, the last volume of the _Positive Philosophy_ was given to the public. Instead of that contentment which we like to picture as the reward of twelve years of meritorious toil devoted to the erection of a high philosophic edifice, the author of this great contribution found himself in the midst of a very sea of small troubles. And they were troubles of that uncompensated kind that harass without elevating, and waste a man's spirit without softening or enlarging it. First, the jar of temperament between Comte and his wife had become so unbearable that they separated (1842). It is not expedient for strangers to attempt to allot blame in such cases, for it is impossible for strangers to know all the deciding circumstances. We need only say that in spite of one or two disadvantageous facts in her career which do not concern the public, Madame Comte seems to have uniformly comported herself towards her husband with an honourable solicitude for his wellbeing. Comte made her an annual allowance, and for some years after the separation they corresponded on friendly terms. Next in the list of the vexations that greeted Comte on emerging from the long tunnel of philosophising was a lawsuit with his publisher. The publisher had impertinently inserted in the sixth volume a protest against a certain foot-note, in which Comte had used some hard words about M. Arago. Comte threw himself into the suit with an energy worthy of Voltaire, and he won it. Third, and worst of all, he had prefixed a preface to the sixth volume, in which he deliberately went out of his way to rouse the active enmity of the very men on whom depended his annual re-election to the post of examiner for the Polytechnic School. The result of this perversity was that by and by he lost the appointment, and with it one half of his very modest income. This was the occasion of an episode, which is of more than merely personal interest.  Before 1842 Comte had been in correspondence with our distinguished countryman, J. S. Mill. Mr. Mill had been greatly impressed by Comte's philosophic ideas; he admits that his own _System of Logic_ owes many valuable thoughts to Comte, and that, in the portion of that work which treats of the logic of the moral sciences, a radical improvement in the conceptions of logical method was derived from the _Positive Philosophy_. Their correspondence, which was extremely full and copious, and which we may hope will one day be made accessible to the public, turned principally upon the two great questions of the equality between men and women, and of the expediency and constitution of a sacerdotal or spiritual order. When Comte found himself straitened, he confided the entire circumstances to his English friend. As might be supposed by those who know the affectionate anxiety with which Mr. Mill regarded the welfare of any one whom he believed to be doing good work in the world, he at once took pains to have Comte's loss of income made up to him, until Comte should have had time to repair that loss by his own endeavour. Mr. Mill persuaded Grote, Molesworth, and Raikes Currie to advance the sum of £240. At the end of the year (that is in 1845) Comte had taken no steps to enable himself to dispense with the aid of the three Englishmen. Mr. Mill applied to them again, but with the exception of Grote, who sent a small sum, they gave Comte to understand that they expected him to earn his own living. Mr. Mill had suggested to Comte that he should write articles for the English periodicals, and expressed his own willingness to translate any such articles from the French. Comte at first fell in with the plan, but he speedily surprised and disconcerted Mr. Mill by boldly taking up the position of 'high moral magistrate,' and accusing the three defaulting contributors of a scandalous falling away from righteousness and a high mind. Mr. Mill was chilled by these pretensions; they struck him as savouring of a totally unexpected charlatanry; and the correspondence came to an end. For Comte's position in the argument one feels that there is much to be said. If you have good reason for believing that a given thinker is doing work that will destroy the official system of science or philosophy, and if you desire its destruction, then you may fairly be asked to help to provide for him the same kind of material freedom that is secured to the professors and propagators of the official system by the state or by the universities. And if it is a fine thing for a man to leave money behind him in the shape of an endowment for the support of a scientific teacher of whom he has never heard, why should it not be just as natural and as laudable to give money, while he is yet alive, to a teacher whom he both knows and approves of? On the other hand, Grote and Molesworth might say that, for anything they could tell, they would find themselves to be helping the construction of a system of which they utterly disapproved. And, as things turned out, they would have been perfectly justified in this serious apprehension. To have done anything to make the production of the _Positive Polity_ easier would have been no ground for anything but remorse to any of the three. It is just to Comte to remark that he always assumed that the contributors to the support of a thinker should be in all essentials of method and doctrine that thinker's disciples; aid from indifferent persons he counted irrational and humiliating. But is an endowment ever a blessing to the man who receives it? The question is difficult to answer generally; in Comte's case there is reason in the doubts felt by Madame Comte as to the expediency of relieving the philosopher from the necessity of being in plain and business-like relations with indifferent persons for a certain number of hours in the week. Such relations do as much as a doctrine to keep egoism within decent bounds, and they must be not only a relief, but a wholesome corrective to the tendencies of concentrated thinking on abstract subjects.  What finally happened was this. From 1845 to 1848 Comte lived as best he could, as well as made his wife her allowance, on an income of £200 a year. We need scarcely say that he was rigorously thrifty. His little account books of income and outlay, with every item entered down to a few hours before his death, are accurate and neat enough to have satisfied an ancient Roman householder. In 1848, through no fault of his own, his salary was reduced to £80. M. Littré and others, with Comte's approval, published an appeal for subscriptions, and on the money thus contributed Comte subsisted for the remaining nine years of his life. By 1852 the subsidy produced as much as £200 a year. It is worth noticing, after the story we have told, that Mr. Mill was one of the subscribers, and that M. Littré continued his assistance after he had been driven from Comte's society by his high pontifical airs. We are sorry not to be able to record any similar trait of magnanimity on Comte's part. His character, admirable as it is for firmness, for intensity, for inexorable will, for iron devotion to what he thought the service of mankind, yet offers few of those softening qualities that make us love good men and pity bad ones. He is of the type of Brutus or of Cato--a model of austere fixity of purpose, but ungracious, domineering, and not quite free from petty bitterness.  If you seek to place yourself in sympathy with Comte it is best to think of him only as the intellectual worker, pursuing in uncomforted obscurity the laborious and absorbing task to which he had given up his whole life. His singularly conscientious fashion of elaborating his ideas made the mental strain more intense than even so exhausting a work as the abstract exposition of the principles of positive science need have been, if he had followed a more self-indulgent plan. He did not write down a word until he had first composed the whole matter in his mind. When he had thoroughly meditated every sentence, he sat down to write, and then, such was the grip of his memory, the exact order of his thoughts came back to him as if without an effort, and he wrote down precisely what he had intended to write, without the aid of a note or a memorandum, and without check or pause. For example, he began and completed in about six weeks a chapter in the _Positive Philosophy_ (vol. v. ch. lv.), which would fill forty of the large pages of the _Encyclopædia Britannica_. Even if his subject had been merely narrative or descriptive, this would be a very satisfactory piece of continuous production. When we reflect that the chapter in question is not narrative, but an abstract exposition of the guiding principles"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/29042"],["title","A Tangled Tale (#1)"],["body","\"Cabbages, I perceive,\" said Balbus. \"Well, they're green, at any rate.\"  \"Which the greens at the shops,\" their hostess explained, \"are by no means dependable upon. Here you has them on the premises, _and_ of the best.\"  \"Does the window open?\" was always Balbus' first question in testing a lodging: and \"Does the chimney smoke?\" his second. Satisfied on all points, he secured the refusal of the room, and they moved on to Number Twenty-five.  This landlady was grave and stern. \"I've nobbut one room left,\" she told them: \"and it gives on the back-gyardin.\"  \"But there are cabbages?\" Balbus suggested.  The landlady visibly relented. \"There is, sir,\" she said: \"and good ones, though I say it as shouldn't. We can't rely on the shops for greens. So we grows them ourselves.\"  \"A singular advantage,\" said Balbus: and, after the usual questions, they went on to Fifty-two.  \"And I'd gladly accommodate you all, if I could,\" was the greeting that met them. \"We are but mortal,\" (\"Irrelevant!\" muttered Balbus) \"and I've let all my rooms but one.\"  \"Which one is a back-room, I perceive,\" said Balbus: \"and looking out on--on cabbages, I presume?\"  \"Yes, indeed, sir!\" said their hostess. \"Whatever _other_ folks may do, _we_ grows our own. For the shops----\"  \"An excellent arrangement!\" Balbus interrupted. \"Then one can really depend on their being good. Does the window open?\"  The usual questions were answered satisfactorily: but this time Hugh added one of his own invention--\"Does the cat scratch?\"  The landlady looked round suspiciously, as if to make sure the cat was not listening, \"I will not deceive you, gentlemen,\" she said. \"It _do_ scratch, but not without you pulls its whiskers! It'll never do it,\" she repeated slowly, with a visible effort to recall the exact words of some written agreement between herself and the cat, \"without you pulls its whiskers!\"  \"Much may be excused in a cat so treated,\" said Balbus, as they left the house and crossed to Number Seventy-three, leaving the landlady curtseying on the doorstep, and still murmuring to herself her parting words, as if they were a form of blessing, \"---- not without you pulls its whiskers!\"  At Number Seventy-three they found only a small shy girl to show the house, who said \"yes'm\" in answer to all questions.  \"The usual room,\" said Balbus, as they marched in: \"the usual back-garden, the usual cabbages. I suppose you can't get them good at the shops?\"  \"Yes'm,\" said the girl.  \"Well, you may tell your mistress we will take the room, and that her plan of growing her own cabbages is simply _admirable_!\"  \"Yes'm,\" said the girl, as she showed them out.  \"One day-room and three bed-rooms,\" said Balbus, as they returned to the hotel. \"We will take as our day-room the one that gives us the least walking to do to get to it.\"  \"Must we walk from door to door, and count the steps?\" said Lambert.  \"No, no! Figure it out, my boys, figure it out!\" Balbus gaily exclaimed, as he put pens, ink, and paper before his hapless pupils, and left the room.  \"I say! It'll be a job!\" said Hugh.  \"Rather!\" said Lambert.     KNOT III.  MAD MATHESIS.     \"I waited for the train.\"   \"Well, they call me so because I _am_ a little mad, I suppose,\" she said, good-humouredly, in answer to Clara's cautiously-worded question as to how she came by so strange a nick-name. \"You see, I never do what sane people are expected to do now-a-days. I never wear long trains, (talking of trains, that's the Charing Cross Metropolitan Station--I've something to tell you about _that_), and I never play lawn-tennis. I can't cook an omelette. I can't even set a broken limb! _There's_ an ignoramus for you!\"  Clara was her niece, and full twenty years her junior; in fact, she was still attending a High School--an institution of which Mad Mathesis spoke with undisguised aversion. \"Let a woman be meek and lowly!\" she would say. \"None of your High Schools for me!\" But it was vacation-time just now, and Clara was her guest, and Mad Mathesis was showing her the sights of that Eighth Wonder of the world--London.  \"The Charing Cross Metropolitan Station!\" she resumed, waving her hand towards the entrance as if she were introducing her niece to a friend. \"The Bayswater and Birmingham Extension is just completed, and the trains now run round and round continuously--skirting the border of Wales, just touching at York, and so round by the east coast back to London. The way the trains run is _most_ peculiar. The westerly ones go round in two hours; the easterly ones take three; but they always manage to start two trains from here, opposite ways, punctually every quarter-of-an-hour.\"  \"They part to meet again,\" said Clara, her eyes filling with tears at the romantic thought.  \"No need to cry about it!\" her aunt grimly remarked. \"They don't meet on the same line of rails, you know. Talking of meeting, an idea strikes me!\" she added, changing the subject with her usual abruptness. \"Let's go opposite ways round, and see which can meet most trains. No need for a chaperon--ladies' saloon, you know. You shall go whichever way you like, and we'll have a bet about it!\"  \"I never make bets,\" Clara said very gravely. \"Our excellent preceptress has often warned us----\"  \"You'd be none the worse if you did!\" Mad Mathesis interrupted. \"In fact, you'd be the better, I'm certain!\"  \"Neither does our excellent preceptress approve of puns,\" said Clara. \"But we'll have a match, if you like. Let me choose my train,\" she added after a brief mental calculation, \"and I'll engage to meet exactly half as many again as you do.\"  \"Not if you count fair,\" Mad Mathesis bluntly interrupted. \"Remember, we only count the trains we meet _on the way_. You mustn't count the one that starts as you start, nor the one that arrives as you arrive.\"  \"That will only make the difference of _one_ train,\" said Clara, as they turned and entered the station. \"But I never travelled alone before. There'll be no one to help me to alight. However, I don't mind. Let's have a match.\"  A ragged little boy overheard her remark, and came running after her. \"Buy a box of cigar-lights, Miss!\" he pleaded, pulling her shawl to attract her attention. Clara stopped to explain.  \"I never smoke cigars,\" she said in a meekly apologetic tone. \"Our excellent preceptress----,\" but Mad Mathesis impatiently hurried her on, and the little boy was left gazing after her with round eyes of amazement.  The two ladies bought their tickets and moved slowly down the central platform, Mad Mathesis prattling on as usual--Clara silent, anxiously reconsidering the calculation on which she rested her hopes of winning the match.  \"Mind where you go, dear!\" cried her aunt, checking her just in time. \"One step more, and you'd have been in that pail of cold water!\"  \"I know, I know,\" Clara said, dreamily. \"The pale, the cold, and the moony----\"  \"Take your places on the spring-boards!\" shouted a porter.  \"What are _they_ for!\" Clara asked in a terrified whisper.  \"Merely to help us into the trains.\" The elder lady spoke with the nonchalance of one quite used to the process. \"Very few people can get into a carriage without help in less than three seconds, and the trains only stop for one second.\" At this moment the whistle was heard, and two trains rushed into the station. A moment's pause, and they were gone again; but in that brief interval several hundred passengers had been shot into them, each flying straight to his place with the accuracy of a Minie bullet--while an equal number were showered out upon the side-platforms.  Three hours had passed away, and the two friends met again on the Charing Cross platform, and eagerly compared notes. Then Clara turned away with a sigh. To young impulsive hearts, like hers, disappointment is always a bitter pill. Mad Mathesis followed her, full of kindly sympathy.  \"Try again, my love!\" she said, cheerily. \"Let us vary the experiment. We will start as we did before, but not to begin counting till our trains meet. When we see each other, we will say 'One!' and so count on till we come here again.\"  Clara brightened up. \"I shall win _that_,\" she exclaimed eagerly, \"if I may choose my train!\"  Another shriek of engine whistles, another upheaving of spring-boards, another living avalanche plunging into two trains as they flashed by: and the travellers were off again.  Each gazed eagerly from her carriage window, holding up her handkerchief as a signal to her friend. A rush and a roar. Two trains shot past each other in a tunnel, and two travellers leaned back in their corners with a sigh--or rather with _two_ sighs--of relief. \"One!\" Clara murmured to herself. \"Won! It's a word of good omen. _This_ time, at any rate, the victory will be mine!\"  But _was_ it?     KNOT IV.  THE DEAD RECKONING.     \"I did dream of money-bags to-night.\"   Noonday on the open sea within a few degrees of the Equator is apt to be oppressively warm; and our two travellers were now airily clad in suits of dazzling white linen, having laid aside the chain-armour which they had found not only endurable in the cold mountain air they had lately been breathing, but a necessary precaution against the daggers of the banditti who infested the heights. Their holiday-trip was over, and they were now on their way home, in the monthly packet which plied between the two great ports of the island they had been exploring.  Along with their armour, the tourists had laid aside the antiquated speech it had pleased them to affect while in knightly disguise, and had returned to the ordinary style of two country gentlemen of the Twentieth Century.  Stretched on a pile of cushions, under the shade of a huge umbrella, they were lazily watching some native fishermen, who had come on board at the last landing-place, each carrying over his shoulder a small but heavy sack. A large weighing-machine, that had been used for cargo at the last port, stood on the deck; and round this the fishermen had gathered, and, with much"]]]
