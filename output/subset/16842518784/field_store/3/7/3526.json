It's _such_ a relief, because there _was_ a time when it really seemed as if he'd never settle down to any regular work. Nothing would induce him to enter my husband's business--for I must tell you, Lady Harriet, we _are_ in business. Sauces, pickles, condiments of every sort and description--_wholesale_, you know, _not_ retail, so I hope you aren't _too_ dreadfully shocked!\"  Lady Harriet remarked that she saw nothing to be shocked at--several of her relations and friends were in business of various kinds, which gave Mrs. Wibberley-Stimpson the opening she required. \"Society has changed its views so _much_ lately, has it not?\" she said. \"Why, the youngest partner in Mr. Wibberley-Stimpson's firm is a younger son of the Earl of Fallowfields--Mr. Chervil Thistleton, and an Honourable, of _course_! I daresay you are acquainted with him?... Not? Quite a charming young man--married a Miss Succory, a connection of the Restharrows, and such a sweet girl! You may have met her?... Oh, I thought--but I really hardly know her _myself_ yet,\" (which was Mrs. Stimpson's method of disguising the fact that she had never met either of them in her life). \"When he came into the warehouse he was perfectly amazed at the immense variety in pickles and sauces--it was quite a revelation to him. Only he can't _touch_ pickles of any kind, which is a pity, because it prevents him from taking the interest he might in the business.... Just _one_ of these hot cakes, dear Lady Harriet--you're making such a wretched tea!... I should like you to see my youngest child, Ruby. She's gone out to tea with some little friends of hers, but she may be back before you go. So much admired--such lovely colouring! But just a _little_ difficult to manage. Governess after governess have I had, and none of them could do anything with her. My present one, however, she seems to have taken to. Miss Heritage, her name is--at least she was adopted as a baby by a rich widow of that name, and brought up in every luxury. But Mrs. Heritage died without making a will, and it seems she'd muddled away most of her money, and there were claims on what she left, so the poor girl had to turn out, and earn her own living. Such a sad little story, is it not? I felt it was really a charity to engage her. I'm not sure that I can keep her much longer, though. She's far too good-looking for a governess, and there's always a danger with a marriageable young man in the house, but fortunately Clarence has too much sense and principle to marry out of his own rank. I do think that's _such_ a mistake, don't you, dear Lady Harriet? Look at the Duke of Mountravail's heir, the young Marquis of Muscombe--married only last month at a registry office to a girl who was in the chorus at the Vivacity! I hear she comes of quite a respectable family, and all that,\" admitted Mrs. Stimpson, who derived her information from her Society journals. \"But still, can you _wonder_ at the poor Duke and Duchess being upset by it? I've no doubt you are constantly coming across similar instances in Smart Society.\"  Lady Harriet disclaimed all acquaintanceship with Smart Society, which Mrs. Stimpson protested she could not believe. \"I am sure you have the _entrée_ into _any_ set, Lady Harriet, even the smartest! Which reminds me. _Have_ you heard anything more about that mysterious disappearance of the Dowager Duchess of Gleneagle's diamonds during her journey from the North last week? A tiara, _and_ a dog-collar, I was told. Professional thieves, I suppose, but don't you think the Duchess's maid?--Oh, _really_? I made _sure_ you would be a friend of the Duchess's--but, of course, Society is so much larger than it used to be!\"  \"You are a far better authority than I can pretend to be about it,\" Lady Harriet owned smilingly; \"and really you've given me so much interesting information that I had nearly forgotten what I came to see you about. It's--well, I wanted to ask----\"  \"I think I can _guess_, Lady Harriet,\" put in Mrs. Stimpson, as her visitor paused for a second. \"I've heard of your difficulties about getting players for the Pageant, and I'm sure I, and indeed _all_ the family, would feel only too honoured.\"  \"It's most kind of you,\" Lady Harriet interrupted, rising, \"but--but that isn't why I've troubled you. It's only that I'm thinking of engaging Jane Saunders as house-parlourmaid, and she tells me she was in your service, so I called to ask about her character, don't you know.\"  For a moment Mrs. Wibberley-Stimpson wished she had been less precipitate, but she soon recognised that no real harm had been done. \"Saunders?\" she said, \"yes, she left me last month. Do sit down again, dear Lady Harriet, and I'll give you all the information I possibly can. Well, when that girl first came, she had everything to learn. It was quite evident she'd never been in service before with gentlefolks. Actually brought in letters in her _fingers_, Lady Harriet, and knocked at sitting-room doors! And _no_ notion of cleaning silver, and I like to see mine come up to table without a speck! However, after being with me for a while, she improved, and I can conscientiously say that she became quite competent in time. That is, for a household like _ours_, you know, where things are done in quite an unpretentious style.\"  \"I don't think we are at all pretentious people either,\" said Lady Harriet, rising once more. \"And now, Mrs. Stimpson, you have told me all I wanted to know, so I must tear myself away.\"  \"Must you _really_ be going? Well, Lady Harriet, I've _so_ much enjoyed our little chat. There are so few persons in a semi-suburban neighbourhood like this, with whom one can have anything in common. So I shall hope to see more of you in future. And if,\" she added, after ringing for Mitchell, \"I _should_ find I've forgotten anything I ought to have told you about Saunders, I can easily pop in some morning.\" Lady Harriet hastened to assure her that she must not think of giving herself this trouble--after which she took her leave.  \"Rather an amusing experience in its way,\" she was thinking. \"Something to tell Joan when I get back. But oh! _what_ an appalling woman! She's settled _one_ thing, though. It will be quite impossible to take Jane Saunders _now_. A pity--because I rather liked the girl's looks!\"  Meanwhile the happily unconscious Mrs. Stimpson had settled down in her chair again with the conviction that she had made a distinctly favourable impression. She allowed her eyes to wander complacently round the room, which, with its big bay window looking on the semi-circular gravel sweep, and its glazed door by the fireplace leading through a small conservatory, gay with begonias, asters, and petunias to the garden beyond, was not merely large, by Gablehurst standards, but undeniably pleasant. She regarded its various features--the white chimney-piece and over-mantel with Adam decorations in _Cartonpierre_, the silk fire-screen printed with Japanese photographs, the cottage-grand, on which stood a tall trumpet vase filled with branches of imitation peach blossom, the _étagères_ (\"Louis Quinze style\") containing china which could not be told from genuine Dresden at a distance, the gaily patterned chintz on the couches and chairs, the water-colour sketches of Venice, and coloured terra-cotta plaques embossed on high relief with views of the Forum and St. Peter's at Rome on the walls, and numerous \"nick-nacks\"--an alabaster model of the Leaning Tower of Pisa, a wood carving of the Lion of Lucerne, and groups of bears from Berne--all of which were not only souvenirs of her wedding-journey, but witnesses to Continental travel and general culture.  She could see nothing that was not in the most correct taste, as Lady Harriet must have observed for herself, together with the hammered copper gong, the oak chest, and the china bowl for cards in the hall. Strange that Saunders should have been the humble means of bringing about so unexpected a meeting, but Providence chose its own instruments, and now the seed was sown, Mrs. Stimpson felt she could rely on herself for the harvest.  And so she took up the latest number of _The Upper Circle_, and read, to the accompaniment of alternate duologues and soliloquies by thrushes and blackbirds in the garden, until gradually she drifted into a blissful dream of being at a garden-party at Lady Harriet's and entreated, not merely by her hostess, but Royalty itself, to accept the _rôle_ of Queen at the County Pageant!  She was in the act of doing this gracefully, when the vision was abruptly ended by the entrance of her elder daughter. Edna was by no means bad-looking, in spite of her light eyelashes and eyebrows, and the fact that the _pince-nez_ she wore compressed her small nose in an unbecoming ridge. Her eyes were larger than her mother's, though of the same colour, and her hair was of a deeper shade of auburn. Her costume was of a kind that may be described as the floppily artistic.  \"I never heard you come in, my dear,\" said her mother. \"Did you enjoy your lecture?\"  \"Quite; I took pages and pages of notes. Nietzsche's _Gospel of the Superman_ is certainly most striking.\"  \"And _what_ is his Gospel exactly?\"  \"Oh, well, he teaches that the ideal man ought to rise superior to conventional prejudices, and have the courage to do as he thinks right without deferring to ordinary ideas. To be strong in willing what he wants--all that sort of thing, you know.\"  \"Dear me!\" said Mrs. Wibberley-Stimpson dubiously. \"But, if everybody acted like that, would it be quite--er--nice?\"  \"There's no fear of any of the men in Gablehurst being Supermen, at all events!\" said Edna. \"They're all perfect slaves to convention! But the lecturer explained the Nietzschean theories in such a way that he made us feel there was a great deal to be said for them.... No tea, thanks. I had mine at the Fletchers. It looks,\" she added, with a glance at the tea-cups, \"as if you had been entertaining"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28459"],["title","In Brief Authority (#2)"],["body","one, Mother--who was it?\"  \"Only Lady Harriet,\" replied Mrs. Stimpson, with elaborate carelessness.  \"_What_ Lady Harriet?\" was the intentionally provoking query.  \"Really, Edna, one would think there were dozens of them! _The_ Lady Harriet: Lady Harriet Elmslie, of course.\"  \"Oh,\" said Edna. \"And what did _she_ want?\"  \"Well, she _came_ to ask after Saunders' character, but she stayed to tea, and we really struck up quite an intimate friendship, discussing one thing and another. She's so quiet and unassuming, Edna--absolutely no _hauteur_. I'm sure you will like her. I told her about you all, and she seemed _so_ interested. Quite between ourselves, I shouldn't be at all surprised if she got us invited to take part in the Pageant--she's on the Committee, you know.\"  \"If I _was_ invited, Mother, I'm not at all sure I shouldn't refuse.\"  \"You must please yourself about that, my dear,\" said Mrs. Stimpson, who, perhaps, felt but little anxiety as to the result. \"_I_ shall certainly accept if the part is at all suitable.\"  She might have said more, if Ruby had not suddenly burst into the room. Ruby was certainly the flower of the family--an extremely engaging young person of about ten, whose mischievous golden-brown eyes had long and curling lashes, and whose vivacious face was set off by a thick mane of deepest Titian red.  \"Oh, Mummy,\" she announced breathlessly, \"I've got invitations for nearly all my animals while we're away at Eastbourne! Mucius Scævola's the most popular--everybody asked him, but I think he'll feel _most_ at home with Daisy Williams. Vivian and Ada Porter will simply love to have Numa Pompilius, but nobody seems to want Tarquinius Superbus, so I shall turn him out in the garden, and he must catch worms for himself.\"  \"Dearest child,\" said her mother, \"what are these new animals of yours with the extraordinary names?\"  \"They're the same old animals, Mums. I've rechristened them since I began Roman History with Miss Heritage. Mucius Scævola's the Salamander, because they're indifferent to fire, like he was--though Miss Heritage says it wouldn't be kind to try with Mucius. Numa Pompilius is the Blind-worm--he used to be Kaa--and the Toad has changed from Nobbles to Tarquinius Superbus.\"  \"I can't understand how you can keep such unpleasant pets as reptiles,\" said Edna.  \"Because I like them,\" said Ruby simply. \"And Bobby Williams has promised, as soon as it gets warmer, to come out on the Common with me and catch lizards. _Won't_ it be lovely?\"  \"I hope you won't put one of them down anybody's neck, then, as you did to Tommy Fletcher.\"  \"That was Mucius,\" Ruby admitted cheerfully. \"But I didn't mean him to go so far down. And he was very good--he didn't bite Tommy anywhere.\"  \"Little ladies don't play such tricks,\" said her Mother. \"I hope Miss Heritage doesn't encourage your liking for these horrid creatures?\"  \"Oh, she doesn't mind, so long as I don't take them out of the aquarium, but she hates touching them herself.\"  \"Did she come in with you?\" her mother inquired, and was told that Miss Heritage had done so, and had gone upstairs, whereupon Ruby was ordered to go and take off her things, and stay quietly in the schoolroom till it was time to come down.  \"I don't know if you noticed it, Mother,\" Edna began, as soon as Ruby had consented to leave them, \"but Miss Heritage had a letter by the afternoon post which seemed to upset her. I went rather out of my way to ask her if she had had bad news of any kind, but she did not think proper to take me into her confidence. Perhaps she might be more open with _you_.\"  \"My dear,\" said Mrs. Wibberley-Stimpson, with much dignity, \"I take no interest whatever in Miss Heritage's private correspondence.\"  \"Nor I,\" declared Edna. \"I only thought that if she is in any trouble--She's so secretive, you know, Mums. I've tried more than once to get her to tell me what cosmetic she uses for her hands--and she never will own to using any at all!\"  \"I'm sure, Edna, you've no reason to be ashamed of your hands.\"  \"Oh, they look all right just now,\" said Edna, examining them dispassionately. \"But they _will_ turn lobster colour at the most inconvenient times. Hers never do--and it _does_ seem so unfair, considering--\" She broke off here, as Daphne Heritage entered.  \"Well, Miss Heritage?\" said Mrs. Stimpson, as the girl hesitated on seeing Edna. \"Did you wish to speak to me?\"  \"I did rather want your advice about something,\" said Daphne, who had a paper, and a small leather case in her hands; \"I thought I might find you alone. It doesn't matter--it will do quite well another time.\"  \"Don't let _me_ prevent you, Miss Heritage,\" said Edna. \"If you don't wish to speak to Mother before me, I've no desire to remain. I was just going up to change in any case.\"  She went out with a slightly huffy air, which was not entirely due to baffled curiosity, for she admired Daphne enough to resent being quietly kept at a distance.  \"It's about this,\" explained Daphne, after Edna had made her exit--\"a bill that has just been sent on to me.\" She gave the paper to Mrs. Stimpson as she spoke. \"I don't know quite what to do about it.\"  She looked very young and inexperienced as she stood there, a slim girlish figure with masses of burnished hair the colour of ripe corn, braided and coiled as closely as possible round her small head, but there was no trace of timidity or subservience in her manner. In the slight form, with the milk-white skin, delicate profile and exquisite hands, there was a distinction that struck her employer as quite absurdly out of keeping with her position.  \"The only thing to do about a bill, my dear,\" said Mrs. Stimpson, \"is to pay it. But nearly thirty pounds is a large sum for you to owe your milliner.\"  \"It's for things Mother--my adopted mother, you know--ordered for me. Stéphanie was always told to send in the account to her. But this seems to have been overlooked, and the executors have sent it on to me. Only I can't pay it myself--unless you wouldn't mind advancing me the money out of my salary.\"  \"I couldn't possibly. You forget that it would represent over a year's salary, and it's by no means certain that you will be with me so long.\"  \"I was afraid you wouldn't,\" said Daphne, with a little droop at the corners of her extremely pretty mouth. \"So I brought this to show you.\" She held out the leather case. \"It's the only jewellery I've got. It belonged to my father, I believe; he and my real mother both died when I was a baby, you know--and I never meant to part with it. But now I'm afraid I must--that is, if you think any jeweller would give as much as thirty pounds for it.\"  Mrs. Wibberley-Stimpson opened the case, which was much more modern than the kind of badge or pendant it contained. This was a fairly large oval stone of a milky green, deeply engraved with strangely formed letters interlaced in a cypher, and surrounded by a border of dark blue gems which Mrs. Stimpson decided instantly must be Cabochon star sapphires of quite exceptional quality. The gold chain attached to it was antique and of fine and curious workmanship.  She was convinced that the pendant must be worth considerably more than thirty pounds, though she was no doubt right in telling Daphne that no jeweller would offer so much for an ornament that was quite out of fashion. \"Besides,\" she said, \"I don't like the idea of any governess of mine going about offering jewellery for sale. Have Edna or Ruby seen you wearing this thing?\" she asked with apparent irrelevance.  It appeared they had not; Daphne had never worn it herself, and she had only remembered its existence that afternoon, and found it hidden away at the back of her wardrobe.  \"Well,\" said Mrs. Stimpson, \"it is most unpleasant to me to see a young girl like you owing all this money to her milliner.\"  \"It isn't very pleasant for _me_,\" said Daphne ruefully; \"but if you won't advance the money, and I can't or mustn't sell the pendant, I don't very well see how I can help it.\"  \"I'll tell you what I'll do,\" said Mrs. Stimpson. \"I really _oughtn't_ to--and under ordinary circumstances I couldn't afford it, but, as it happens, a great-uncle of mine left me a small legacy not long ago, and I haven't spent quite all of it yet. So I don't mind buying this for thirty pounds myself.\"  \"Will you really?\" cried Daphne. \"How angelic of you!\"  \"I think it is,\" said Mrs. Stimpson; \"but I feel myself responsible for you, to some extent. So I'll write you a cheque for the thirty pounds, and you can send it off to this milliner person at once.\" She went to the writing-table and filled up the cheque. \"There,\" she said, handing it to Daphne, \"put it in an envelope and direct it at once--you'll find a stamp in that box, and it can go by the next post.\"  \"By the way, my dear,\" she added, as she was leaving the room, \"I needn't tell you that _I_ shall not breathe a word to a soul of our little transaction, and I should advise you, in your own interests, to keep it entirely to yourself.\"  \"I was quite wrong about Mrs. Stimpson,\" Daphne told herself reproachfully, after she had slipped the letter containing bill and cheque into the letter-box in the hall. \"She _can_ be kind sometimes, and I've been a little beast to see only the comic side of her! I daresay she won't even _wear_ that pendant.\"  But Mrs. Stimpson had every intention of wearing it that same evening. It is not often that one has the opportunity of doing a kindness and securing a real bargain at a single stroke; and she knew enough about jewels to be fully aware that, if the ornament was a trifle old-fashioned, she had not done at all badly over her purchase.  \"It really suits me very well,\" she thought, as, after putting the last touches to her evening demi-toilette, she fastened the pendant round her neck. \"Even better than I expected. It was lucky Miss Heritage came to _me_. A jeweller would have been sure to cheat her, poor child!\"  And she went down to the drawing-room"]]]
