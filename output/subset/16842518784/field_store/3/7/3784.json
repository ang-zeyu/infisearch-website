Scarce grew the shell in the shallows, rarely a patch could they touch;   Always the take was so little, always the labour so much;   Always they thought of the Islands held by the lumbering Dutch,    Islands where shell was in plenty lying in passage and bay,   Islands where divers could gather hundreds of shell in a day:   But the lumbering Dutch, with their gunboats, hunted the divers away.    Joe Nagasaki, the 'tender', finding the profits grow small,   Said, 'Let us go to the Islands, try for a number one haul!   If we get caught, go to prison -- let them take lugger and all!'    Kanzo Makame, the diver -- knowing full well what it meant --   Fatalist, gambler, and stoic, smiled a broad smile of content,   Flattened in mainsail and foresail, and off to the Islands they went.    Close to the headlands they drifted, picking up shell by the ton,   Piled up on deck were the oysters, opening wide in the sun,   When, from the lee of the headland, boomed the report of a gun.    Once that the diver was sighted pearl-shell and lugger must go.   Joe Nagasaki decided -- quick was the word and the blow --   Cut both the pipe and the life-line, leaving the diver below!    Kanzo Makame, the diver, failing to quite understand,   Pulled the 'haul up' on the life-line, found it was slack in his hand;   Then, like a little brown stoic, lay down and died on the sand.    Joe Nagasaki, the 'tender', smiling a sanctified smile,   Headed her straight for the gunboat -- throwing out shells all the while --   Then went aboard and reported, 'No makee dive in three mile!    'Dress no have got and no helmet -- diver go shore on the spree;   Plenty wind come and break rudder -- lugger get blown out to sea:   Take me to Japanee Consul, he help a poor Japanee!'         .    .    .    .    .    So the Dutch let him go, and they watched him, as off from the Islands he ran,   Doubting him much, but what would you?  You have to be sure of your man   Ere you wake up that nest-full of hornets -- the little brown men of Japan.    Down in the ooze and the coral, down where earth's wonders are spread,   Helmeted, ghastly, and swollen, Kanzo Makame lies dead:   Joe Nagasaki, his 'tender', is owner and diver instead.    Wearer of pearls in your necklace, comfort yourself if you can,   These are the risks of the pearling -- these are the ways of Japan,   'Plenty more Japanee diver, plenty more little brown man!'     The City of Dreadful Thirst      The stranger came from Narromine and made his little joke --   'They say we folks in Narromine are narrow-minded folk.   But all the smartest men down here are puzzled to define   A kind of new phenomenon that came to Narromine.    'Last summer up in Narromine 'twas gettin' rather warm --   Two hundred in the water-bag, and lookin' like a storm --   We all were in the private bar, the coolest place in town,   When out across the stretch of plain a cloud came rollin' down,    'We don't respect the clouds up there, they fill us with disgust,   They mostly bring a Bogan shower -- three rain-drops and some dust;   But each man, simultaneous-like, to each man said, \"I think   That cloud suggests it's up to us to have another drink!\"    'There's clouds of rain and clouds of dust -- we'd heard of them before,   And sometimes in the daily press we read of \"clouds of war\":   But -- if this ain't the Gospel truth I hope that I may burst --   That cloud that came to Narromine was just a cloud of thirst.    'It wasn't like a common cloud, 'twas more a sort of haze;   It settled down about the streets, and stopped for days and days,   And not a drop of dew could fall and not a sunbeam shine   To pierce that dismal sort of mist that hung on Narromine.    'Oh, Lord! we had a dreadful time beneath that cloud of thirst!   We all chucked-up our daily work and went upon the burst.   The very blacks about the town that used to cadge for grub,   They made an organised attack and tried to loot the pub.    'We couldn't leave the private bar no matter how we tried;   Shearers and squatters, union-men and blacklegs side by side   Were drinkin' there and dursn't move, for each was sure, he said,   Before he'd get a half-a-mile the thirst would strike him dead!    'We drank until the drink gave out, we searched from room to room,   And round the pub, like drunken ghosts, went howling through the gloom.   The shearers found some kerosene and settled down again,   But all the squatter chaps and I, we staggered to the train.    'And, once outside the cloud of thirst, we felt as right as pie,   But while we stopped about the town we had to drink or die.   But now I hear it's safe enough, I'm going back to work   Because they say the cloud of thirst has shifted on to Bourke.    'But when you see those clouds about -- like this one over here --   All white and frothy at the top, just like a pint of beer,   It's time to go and have a drink, for if that cloud should burst   You'd find the drink would all be gone, for that's a cloud of thirst!'         .    .    .    .    .    We stood the man from Narromine a pint of half-and-half;   He drank it off without a gasp in one tremendous quaff;   'I joined some friends last night,' he said, 'in what THEY called a spree;   But after Narromine 'twas just a holiday to me.'    And now beyond the Western Range, where sunset skies are red,   And clouds of dust, and clouds of thirst, go drifting overhead,   The railway-train is taking back, along the Western Line,   That narrow-minded person on his road to Narromine.     Saltbush Bill's Gamecock      'Twas Saltbush Bill, with his travelling sheep, was making his way to town;   He crossed them over the Hard Times Run, and he came to the Take 'Em Down;   He counted through at the boundary gate, and camped at the drafting yard:   For Stingy Smith, of the Hard Times Run, had hunted him rather hard.   He bore no malice to Stingy Smith -- 'twas simply the hand of fate   That caused his waggon to swerve aside and shatter old Stingy's gate;   And, being only the hand of fate, it follows, without a doubt,   It wasn't the fault of Saltbush Bill that Stingy's sheep got out.   So Saltbush Bill, with an easy heart, prepared for what might befall,   Commenced his stages on Take 'Em Down, the station of Rooster Hall.    'Tis strange how often the men out back will take to some curious craft,   Some ruling passion to keep their thoughts away from the overdraft;   And Rooster Hall, of the Take 'Em Down, was widely known to fame   As breeder of champion fighting cocks -- his 'forte' was the British Game.   The passing stranger within his gates that camped with old Rooster Hall   Was forced to talk about fowls all night, or else not talk at all.   Though droughts should come, and though sheep should die,     his fowls were his sole delight;   He left his shed in the flood of work to watch two gamecocks fight.   He held in scorn the Australian Game, that long-legged child of sin;   In a desperate fight, with the steel-tipped spurs, the British Game must win!   The Australian bird was a mongrel bird, with a touch of the jungle cock;   The want of breeding must find him out, when facing the English stock;   For British breeding, and British pluck, must triumph it over all --   And that was the root of the simple creed that governed old Rooster Hall.         .    .    .    .    .    'Twas Saltbush Bill to the station rode ahead of his travelling sheep,   And sent a message to Rooster Hall that wakened him out of his sleep --   A crafty message that fetched him out, and hurried him as he came --   'A drover has an Australian Bird to match with your British Game.'   'Twas done, and done in a half a trice; a five-pound note aside;   Old Rooster Hall, with his champion bird, and the drover's bird untried.   'Steel spurs, of course?' said old Rooster Hall;     'you'll need 'em, without a doubt!'   'You stick the spurs on your bird!' said Bill, 'but mine fights best without.'   'Fights best without?' said old Rooster Hall; 'he can't fight best unspurred!   You must be crazy!'  But Saltbush Bill said, 'Wait till you see my bird!'   So Rooster Hall to his fowlyard went, and quickly back he came,   Bearing a clipt and a shaven cock, the pride of his English Game.   With an eye as fierce as an eaglehawk, and a crow like a trumpet call,   He strutted about on the garden walk, and cackled at Rooster Hall.   Then Rooster Hall sent off a boy with word to his cronies two,   McCrae (the boss of the Black Police) and Father Donahoo.   Full many a cockfight old McCrae had held in his empty Court,   With Father D. as a picker-up -- a regular all-round Sport!   They got the message of Rooster Hall, and down to his run they came,   Prepared to scoff at the drover's bird, and to bet on the English Game;   They hied them off to the drover's camp, while Saltbush rode before --   Old Rooster Hall was a blithesome man, when he thought of the treat in store.   They reached the camp, where the drover's cook, with countenance all serene,   Was boiling beef in an iron pot, but never a fowl was seen.    'Take off the beef from the fire,' said Bill,     'and wait till you see the fight;   There's something fresh for the bill-of-fare --     there's game-fowl stew to-night!   For Mister Hall has a fighting cock, all feathered and clipped and spurred;   And he's fetched him here, for a bit of sport, to fight our Australian bird.   I've made a match that our pet will win, though he's hardly a fighting cock,   But he's game enough, and it's many a mile     that he's tramped with the travelling stock.'   The cook he banged on a saucepan lid; and, "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3040"],["title","The Boss and the Machine: A Chronicle of the Politicians and Party Organization (#1)"],["body","his votes to Adams, who was elected, thereby arousing the wrath of Jackson and of the stalwart and irreconcilable frontiersmen who hailed him as their leader. The Adams term merely marked a transition from the old order to the new, from Jeffersonian to Jacksonian democracy. Then was the word Republican dropped from the party name, and Democrat became an appellation of definite and practical significance.  By this time many of the older States had removed the early restrictions upon voting, and the new States carved out of the West had written manhood suffrage into their constitutions. This new democracy flocked to its imperator; and Jackson entered his capital in triumph, followed by a motley crowd of frontiersmen in coonskin caps, farmers in butternut-dyed homespun, and hungry henchmen eager for the spoils. For Jackson had let it be known that he considered his election a mandate by the people to fill the offices with his political adherents.  So the Democrats began their new lease of life with an orgy of spoils. \"Anybody is good enough for any job\" was the favorite watchword. But underneath this turmoil of desire for office, significant party differences were shaping themselves. Henry Clay, the alluring orator and master of compromise, brought together a coalition of opposing fragments. He and his following objected to Jackson's assumption of vast executive prerogatives, and in a brilliant speech in the Senate Clay espoused the name Whig. Having explained the origin of the term in English and colonial politics, he cried: \"And what is the present but the same contest in another form? The partizans of the present Executive sustain his favor in the most boundless extent. The Whigs are opposing executive encroachment and a most alarming extension of executive power and prerogative. They are contending for the rights of the people, for free institutions, for the supremacy of the Constitution and the laws.\"  There soon appeared three practical issues which forced the new alignment. The first was the Bank. The charter of the United States Bank was about to expire, and its friends sought a renewal. Jackson believed the Bank an enemy of the Republic, as its officers were anti-Jacksonians, and he promptly vetoed the bill extending the charter. The second issue was the tariff. Protection was not new; but Clay adroitly renamed it, calling it \"the American system.\" It was popular in the manufacturing towns and in portions of the agricultural communities, but was bitterly opposed by the slave-owning States.  A third issue dealt with internal improvements. All parts of the country were feeling the need of better means of communication, especially between the West and the East. Canals and turnpikes were projected in every direction. Clay, whose imagination was fervid, advocated a vast system of canals and roads financed by national aid. But the doctrine of states-rights answered that the Federal Government had no power to enter a State, even to spend money on improvements, without the consent of that State. And, at all events, for Clay to espouse was for Jackson to oppose.  These were the more important immediate issues of the conflict between Clay's Whigs and Jackson's Democrats, though it must be acknowledged that the personalities of the leaders were quite as much an issue as any of the policies which they espoused. The Whigs, however, proved unequal to the task of unhorsing their foes; and, with two exceptions, the Democrats elected every President from Jackson to Lincoln. The exceptions were William Henry Harrison and Zachary Taylor, both of whom were elected on their war records and both of whom died soon after their inauguration. Tyler, who as Vice-President succeeded General Harrison, soon estranged the Whigs, so that the Democratic triumph was in effect continuous over a period of thirty years.  Meanwhile, however, another issue was shaping the destiny of parties and of the nation. It was an issue that politicians dodged and candidates evaded, that all parties avoided, that publicists feared, and that presidents and congressmen tried to hide under the tenuous fabric of their compromises. But it was an issue that persisted in keeping alive and that would not down, for it was an issue between right and wrong. Three times the great Clay maneuvered to outflank his opponents over the smoldering fires of the slavery issue, but he died before the repeal of the Missouri Compromise gave the death-blow to his loosely gathered coalition. Webster, too, and Calhoun, the other members of that brilliant trinity which represented the genius of Constitutional Unionism, of States Rights, and of Conciliation, passed away before the issue was squarely faced by a new party organized for the purpose of opposing the further expansion of slavery.  This new organization, the Republican party, rapidly assumed form and solidarity. It was composed of Northern Whigs, of anti-slavery Democrats, and of members of several minor groups, such as the Know-Nothing or American party, the Liberty party, and included as well some of the despised Abolitionists. The vote for Fremont, its first presidential candidate, in 1856, showed it to be a sectional party, confined to the North. But the definite recognition of slavery as an issue by an opposition party had a profound effect upon the Democrats. Their Southern wing now promptly assumed an uncompromising attitude, which, in 1860, split the party into factions. The Southern wing named Breckinridge; the Northern wing named Stephen A. Douglas; while many Democrats as well as Whigs took refuge in a third party, calling itself the Constitutional Union, which named John Bell. This division cost the Democrats the election, for, under the unique and inspiring leadership of Abraham Lincoln, the Republicans rallied the anti-slavery forces of the North and won.  Slavery not only racked the parties and caused new alignments; it racked and split the Union. It is one of the remarkable phenomena of our political history that the Civil War did not destroy the Democratic party, though the Southern chieftains of that party utterly lost their cause. The reason is that the party never was as purely a Southern as the Republican was a Northern party. Moreover, the arrogance and blunders of the Republican leaders during the days of Reconstruction helped to keep it alive. A baneful political heritage has been handed down to us from the Civil War--the solid South. It overturns the national balance of parties, perpetuates a pernicious sectionalism, and deprives the South of that bipartizan rivalry which keeps open the currents of political life.  Since the Civil War the struggle between the two dominant parties has been largely a struggle between the Ins and the Outs. The issues that have divided them have been more apparent than real. The tariff, the civil service, the trusts, and the long list of other \"issues\" do not denote fundamental differences, but only variations of degree. Never in any election during this long interval has there been definitely at stake a great national principle, save for the currency issue of 1896 and the colonial question following the War with Spain. The revolt of the Progressives in 1912 had a character of its own; but neither of the old parties squarely joined issue with the Progressives in the contest which followed. The presidential campaign of 1916 afforded an opportunity to place on trial before the people a great cause, for there undoubtedly existed then in the country two great and opposing sides of public opinion--one for and the other against war with Germany. Here again, however, the issue was not joined but was adroitly evaded by both the candidates.  None the less there has been a difference between the two great parties. The Republican party has been avowedly nationalistic, imperialistic, and in favor of a vigorous constructive foreign policy. The Democratic party has generally accepted the lukewarm international policy of Jefferson and the exaltation of the locality and the plain individual as championed by Jackson. Thus, though in a somewhat intangible and variable form, the doctrinal distinctions between Hamilton and Jefferson have survived.  In the emergence of new issues, new parties are born. But it is one of the singular characteristics of the American party system that third parties are abortive. Their adherents serve mainly as evangelists, crying their social and economic gospel in the political wilderness. If the issues are vital, they are gradually absorbed by the older parties.  Before the Civil War several sporadic parties were formed. The most unique was the Anti-Masonic party. It flourished on the hysteria caused by the abduction of William Morgan of Batavia, in western New York, in 1826. Morgan had written a book purporting to lay bare the secrets of Freemasonry. His mysterious disappearance was laid at the doors of leading Freemasons; and it was alleged that members of this order placed their secret obligations above their duties as citizens and were hence unfit for public office. The movement became impressive in Pennsylvania, Vermont, Massachusetts, Ohio, and New York. It served to introduce Seward and Fillmore into politics. Even a national party was organized, and William Wirt, of Maryland, a distinguished lawyer, was nominated for President. He received, however, only the electoral votes of Vermont. The excitement soon cooled, and the party disappeared.  The American or Know-Nothing party had for its slogan \"America for Americans,\" and was a considerable factor in certain localities, especially in New York and the Middle States, from 1853 to 1856. The Free Soil party, espousing the cause of slavery restriction, named Martin Van Buren as its presidential candidate and polled enough votes in the election of 1848 to defeat Cass, the Democratic candidate. It did not survive the election of 1852, but its essential principle was adopted by the Republican party."]]]
