We are glad to see you, Mr. Gilton;\" and she held out her hand to him. \"Won't you sit down?\" She felt that he had come in the Christmas spirit, and she was anxious to meet him half-way.  \"Yes,\" said her husband, coming forward, and instantly taking his cue from his wife,--for he was really a very nice man,--\"we are very glad.\" To be sure, in his manner there was a certain stiffness, for a man cannot always change completely in a moment, as a woman can; but Mr. Gilton was too perplexed to notice this. In the incomprehensible way that one's mind has of clinging to unimportant things at great crises, while he was fuming with rage and bothered with this strange feeling which was not precisely rage, he was wondering how in the world he was going to sit down with that ridiculous turkey, with its ridiculous legs, in his arms, and not look more absurd than he did now. In this moment of absentmindedness he had mechanically taken Mrs. Bilton's hand and shaken it, and after that of course there was nothing to do except to shake Mr. Bilton's. Then he began to know it was all up. He had not spoken yet, but now he made a frantic effort to save what might be left besides honor. \"I came--\" he began, \"I came--came to your house--\" There he paused a moment, and that unlucky child with that tendency to be possessed by one idea, which is characteristic of small and trivial minds, and for which she should have been shaken, burst in with, \"And did the reindeer bring you, and are they outside?\"  He almost groaned, so overwhelmed was he by this new idiocy. Reindeer! If those overworked, struggling car-horses could have heard that! Then Mrs. Bilton, pitying his evident confusion, came to his assistance.  \"Don't mind the children, Mr. Gilton,\" she said, her cheeks flushing, and looking very pretty with the excitement of the unusual circumstances, \"we are glad you came, however you made your way here. I think we may thank Christmas Eve for it. Now do take off your overcoat and sit down.\"  Oh, mispraised woman's tact! What complications you may produce! That finished it, of course. He sat down. In those few moments that strange feeling had grown marvellously stronger. It seemed to be made up of the most diverse elements,--a mixture of green wreaths and his own childhood, and his mother, and a top he had not thought of for years, and the wide fireplace at home, and a stable with a child in it, and a picture, in a book he used to read, of a lot of angels in the sky, one particular one in the middle, and underneath it some words--what were the words? He'd forgotten they had anything to do with Christmas, anyway.  \"But you _did_ bring us the turkey, didn't you?\" said Cora Cordelia, helping her mother on.  To do the child justice,--for even Cora Cordelia has a right to demand justice,--her manners were corrupted by Christmas expectancy.  \"Cora Cordelia, I'm ashamed of you,\" said Mrs. Bilton.  \"Yes,\" said Mr. Gilton, the words wrung from his lips, while beads stood on his forehead,--\"yes, I brought you the turkey.\"  \"Did you really?\" exclaimed Mrs. Bilton, who thought he had all the time. \"That was very kind of you.\"  \"Will you please take it--take it away?\" he said, with that wish to have something over which we associate with the dentist. So Mrs. Bilton took the turkey and thanked him, and gave it to Fanny, who carried it out to the kitchen, and Mr. Gilton gave one last look at its legs as it went through the door, feeling that now he must wake up from this nightmare. But things only went farther and became more incredible and upsetting, only that, strangely enough, that feeling of horror began to wear off, and that singular strain of association with all sorts of Christmas things to grow stronger. He himself could hardly believe that it was no worse, when he found himself seated by the littered table, with Mrs. Bilton near and Mr. Bilton over by the fire again, listening to first one and then the other, and occasionally letting fall a word himself, his conversational powers seeming to thaw out along with the snow on his greatcoat. These words themselves were a surprise to him. He was quite sure that he started them with a creditable gruffness, but the Christmas air mellowed them in a highly unsatisfactory fashion, so that they fell on his own ears quite otherwise than as he had meant they should sound. Moreover the general tenor of the conversation was exceedingly perplexing. It was all about how fine it was of him to come this evening, and how they had often regretted the hard feeling, and how things always did get exaggerated. Of course he would not have believed a word of it, if he had been able to get any grip on the situation, but he wasn't, and he just went on assenting to it all as if it were true. There came a time when Mr. Bilton cleared his throat, hesitated a moment, and then said boldly,--  \"I think I ought to tell you, Mr. Gilton, that I had nothing whatever to do with the death of your dog.\" Mr. Gilton felt the ground slipping away from under his very feet. That dog had been his piece of resistance, as it were. \"I wouldn't have poisoned him,\" went on Mr. Bilton, \"for a hundred dollars. But,\" he added, with a queer little smile, \"I wasn't going to tell you so, you know.\"  \"Of course you wasn't,\" exclaimed Mr. Gilton, hurriedly, with a touch of that unholy excitement that a lapse from grammar imparts.  \"We wouldn't any of us,\" asserted Walter.  \"No,\" said Susan, Fanny, and Cora Cordelia.  Then it came out that the whole family had rather admired the dog than otherwise. It was here that John did really come in, his entrance sounding very much as had Mr. Gilton's. He nearly fell over when he saw the visitor, but he had time to pull himself together, for Cora Cordelia had snatched that moment for showing Mr. Gilton her gifts for the family, and he was bound hand and foot with helplessness. Then they all came and showed him their gifts. While he examined them Mr. and Mrs. Bilton carefully averted their eyes and gazed hard at the opposite wall, while Cora Cordelia urged him, in stage whispers, not to let them suspect. It was pitiable the state to which he was reduced. Of course resisting this Christmas enthusiasm was out of the question. To be sure it came over him once with startling force, as she showed him a toy water-wheel, that went by sand,--which she had purchased for her father at a phenomenally low rate because the wheel could not be made to go,--that Cora Cordelia was the very child that he had fallen over as she came hastening out of a toy-shop with a queerly shaped bundle, the day before, and so been further imbittered towards Christmas. Susan had purchased a cup and ball for her mother, and as she went out of the room for a moment, insisted upon Mr. Gilton's trying to do it and see what fun it was. If Mr. Gilton lives to be a hundred he will never forget the mingled feelings with which he awkwardly tried to get that senseless ball into that idiotic cup. At last he stood up to go--it was after six o'clock--and they went with him to the door, and wished him Merry Christmas, and sent Merry Christmas to Mrs. Gilton, and said good-night several times, and he stumbled on through the snow, this time towards his own door. It had stopped snowing as suddenly and quietly as it had begun, and the stars had come out. He gazed up at them,--something he very rarely did. They seemed a part of Christmas. Just before he turned in at his own gate, he looked back at the Bilton house and shook his fist at it, but the expression on his face was such that the very same newsboy who had accosted him earlier failed utterly to recognize him and was emboldened to offer him a paper. He too was pushing his way home with two papers left, in a somewhat dispirited way.  \"I'll take 'em both,\" said this singular customer. \"Here's a quarter--never mind the change. It's Christmas Eve, I believe--\" and this when he knew perfectly well that a copy of that very same journal was waiting for him on his table. The boy looked at his quarter and looked again at his customer, and recognized him, and made up his mind to buy a couple of hot sausages on the corner, and went on his way feeling that there was a new heaven and a new earth. Mrs. Gilton was standing at the parlor window, peering out anxiously as he came up the path. She was in the hall as he entered.  \"Why, Reuben,\" she said, \"I was afraid something had happened.\"  Goodness gracious! As if something hadn't happened! He turned away to hang up his overcoat and tried to speak crossly.  \"Well,\" he said, \"I've lost my turkey. That's happened.\"  \"Never mind,\" said Mrs. Gilton, quickly; \"the other one came later, the first one, you know--so--so the Biltons didn't get it this time.\"  \"They got the second one, though,\" said Reuben, hanging up his hat.  \"Oh, dear, did they!\" said Mrs. Gilton. Then she went on, \"Well, I don't care if they did, so there! I guess they need it for their Christmas dinner.\"  \"No, they don't,\" said Reuben, turning around and facing her, \"because they are going to eat part of ours. They are coming in to-morrow to have dinner with us,--every one of them!\" he asserted more loudly, on account of the expression on his wife's face. \"Bilton, and his wife, and all the five children, down to Cora Cordelia! So we'll have to have something for them to eat.\"  If Mr. Gilton will never forget the cup and ball, Mrs. Gilton will never forget that moment. She went all over it in her mind whether she could manage him herself to-night, or whether to send Bridget right away then for the doctor, and if she hadn't better say a policeman too, and whether he could be kept for the future in a private house, or would have to be confined in an asylum. She was inclining towards the asylum when he, who was going into the sitting-room before her, turned round and laughed an odd little laugh. She began to think then that a private house would do.  The next day they all dined together, which proved that it was not all "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2832"],["title","Myth, Ritual and Religion, Vol. 1 (of 2) (#1)"],["body","promised third edition of Mr. Frazer's The Golden Bough.  A. L.     PREFACE TO NEW EDITION.   The original edition of Myth, Ritual and Religion, published in 1887, has long been out of print. In revising the book I have brought it into line with the ideas expressed in the second part of my Making of Religion (1898) and have excised certain passages which, as the book first appeared, were inconsistent with its main thesis. In some cases the original passages are retained in notes, to show the nature of the development of the author's opinions. A fragment or two of controversy has been deleted, and chapters xi. and xii., on the religion of the lowest races, have been entirely rewritten, on the strength of more recent or earlier information lately acquired. The gist of the book as it stands now and as it originally stood is contained in the following lines from the preface of 1887: \"While the attempt is made to show that the wilder features of myth survive from, or were borrowed from, or were imitated from the ideas of people in the savage condition of thought, the existence--even among savages--of comparatively pure, if inarticulate, religious beliefs is insisted on throughout\". To that opinion I adhere, and I trust that it is now expressed with more consistency than in the first edition. I have seen reason, more and more, to doubt the validity of the \"ghost theory,\" or animistic hypothesis, as explanatory of the whole fabric of religion; and I present arguments against Mr. Tylor's contention that the higher conceptions of savage faith are borrowed from missionaries.(1) It is very possible, however, that Mr. Tylor has arguments more powerful than those contained in his paper of 1892. For our information is not yet adequate to a scientific theory of the Origin of Religion, and probably never will be. Behind the races whom we must regard as \"nearest the beginning\" are their unknown ancestors from a dateless past, men as human as ourselves, but men concerning whose psychical, mental and moral condition we can only form conjectures. Among them religion arose, in circumstances of which we are necessarily ignorant. Thus I only venture on a surmise as to the germ of a faith in a Maker (if I am not to say \"Creator\") and Judge of men. But, as to whether the higher religious belief, or the lower mythical stories came first, we are at least certain that the Christian conception of God, given pure, was presently entangled, by the popular fancy of Europe, in new Marchen about the Deity, the Madonna, her Son, and the Apostles. Here, beyond possibility of denial, pure belief came first, fanciful legend was attached after. I am inclined to surmise that this has always been the case, and, in the pages on the legend of Zeus, I show the processes of degeneration, of mythical accretions on a faith in a Heaven-God, in action. That \"the feeling of religious devotion\" attests \"high faculties\" in early man (such as are often denied to men who \"cannot count up to seven\"), and that \"the same high mental faculties... would infallibly lead him, as long as his reasoning powers remained poorly developed, to various strange superstitions and customs,\" was the belief of Mr. Darwin.(2) That is also my view, and I note that the lowest savages are not yet guilty of the very worst practices, \"sacrifice of human beings to a blood-loving God,\" and ordeals by poison and fire, to which Mr. Darwin alludes. \"The improvement of our science\" has freed us from misdeeds which are unknown to the Andamanese or the Australians. Thus there was, as regards these points in morals, degeneracy from savagery as society advanced, and I believe that there was also degeneration in religion. To say this is not to hint at a theory of supernatural revelation to the earliest men, a theory which I must, in limine disclaim.   (1) Tylor, \"Limits of Savage Religion.\" Journal of the Anthropological Institute, vol. xxi.  (2) Descent of Man, p. 68, 1871.   In vol. ii. p. 19 occurs a reference, in a note, to Mr. Hartland's criticism of my ideas about Australian gods as set forth in the Making of Religion. Mr. Hartland, who kindly read the chapters on Australian religion in this book, does not consider that my note on p. 19 meets the point of his argument. As to the Australians, I mean no more than that, AMONG endless low myths, some of them possess a belief in a \"maker of everything,\" a primal being, still in existence, watching conduct, punishing breaches of his laws, and, in some cases, rewarding the good in a future life. Of course these are the germs of a sympathetic religion, even if the being thus regarded is mixed up with immoral or humorous contradictory myths. My position is not harmed by such myths, which occur in all old religions, and, in the middle ages, new myths were attached to the sacred figures of Christianity in poetry and popular tales.  Thus, if there is nothing \"sacred\" in a religion because wild or wicked fables about the gods also occur, there is nothing \"sacred\" in almost any religion on earth.  Mr. Hartland's point, however, seems to be that, in the Making of Religion, I had selected certain Australian beliefs as especially \"sacred\" and to be distinguished from others, because they are inculcated at the religious Mysteries of some tribes. His aim, then, is to discover low, wild, immoral myths, inculcated at the Mysteries, and thus to destroy my line drawn between religion on one hand and myth or mere folk-lore on the other. Thus there is a being named Daramulun, of whose rites, among the Coast Murring, I condensed the account of Mr. Howitt.(1) From a statement by Mr. Greenway(2) Mr. Hartland learned that Daramulun's name is said to mean \"leg on one side\" or \"lame\". He, therefore, with fine humour, speaks of Daramulun as \"a creator with a game leg,\" though when \"Baiame\" is derived by two excellent linguists, Mr. Ridley and Mr. Greenway, from Kamilaroi baia, \"to make,\" Mr. Hartland is by no means so sure of the sense of the name. It happens to be inconvenient to him! Let the names mean what they may, Mr. Hartland finds, in an obiter dictum of Mr. Howitt (before he was initiated), that Daramulun is said to have \"died,\" and that his spirit is now aloft. Who says so, and where, we are not informed,(3) and the question is important.   (1) J. A. I., xiii. pp. 440-459.  (2) Ibid., xxi. p. 294.  (3) Ibid., xiii. p. 194.   For the Wiraijuri, IN THEIR MYSTERIES, tell a myth of cannibal conduct of Daramulun's, and of deceit and failure of knowledge in Baiame.(1) Of this I was unaware, or neglected it, for I explicitly said that I followed Mr. Howitt's account, where no such matter is mentioned. Mr. Howitt, in fact, described the Mysteries of the Coast Murring, while the narrator of the low myths, Mr. Matthews, described those of a remote tribe, the Wiraijuri, with whom Daramulun is not the chief, but a subordinate person. How Mr. Matthews' friends can at once hold that Daramulun was \"destroyed\" by Baiame (their chief deity), and also that Daramulun's voice is heard at their rites, I don't know.(2) Nor do I know why Mr. Hartland takes the myth of a tribe where Daramulun is \"the evil spirit who rules the night,\"(3) and introduces it as an argument against the belief of a distant tribe, where, by Mr. Howitt's account, Daramulun is not an evil spirit, but \"the master\" of all, whose abode is above the sky, and to whom are attributed powers of omnipotence and omnipresence, or, at any rate, the power \"to do anything and to go anywhere.... To his direct ordinances are attributed the social and moral laws of the community.\"(4) This is not \"an evil spirit\"! When Mr. Hartland goes for scandals to a remote tribe of a different creed that he may discredit the creed of the Coast Murring, he might as well attribute to the Free Kirk \"the errors of Rome\". But Mr. Hartland does it!(5) Being \"cunning of fence\" he may reply that I also spoke loosely of Wiraijuri and Coast Murring as, indifferently, Daramulunites. I did, and I was wrong, and my critic ought not to accept but to expose my error. The Wiraijuri Daramulun, who was annihilated, yet who is \"an evil spirit that rules the night,\" is not the Murring guardian and founder of recognised ethics.   (1) J. A. I., xxv. p. 297.  (2) Ibid., May, 1895, p. 419.  (3) Ibid.  (4) Ibid., xiii. pp. 458, 459.  (5) Folk-Lore, ix., No. iv., p. 299.   But, in the Wiraijuri mysteries, the master, Baiame, deceives the women as to the Mysteries! Shocking to US, but to deceive the women as to these arcana, is, to the Australian mind in general, necessary for the safety of the world. Moreover, we have heard of a lying spirit sent to deceive prophets in a much higher creed. Finally, in a myth of the Mystery of the Wiraijuri, Baiame is not omniscient. Indeed, even civilised races cannot keep on the level of these religious conceptions, and not to keep on that level is--mythology. Apollo, in the hymn to Hermes, sung on a sacred occasion, needs to ask an old vine-dresser for intelligence. Hyperion \"sees all and hears all,\" but needs to be informed, by his daughters, of the slaughter of his kine. The Lord, in the Book of Job, has to ask Satan, \"Whence comest thou?\" Now for the sake of dramatic effect, now from pure inability to live on the level of his highest thought, man mythologises and anthropomorphises, in Greece or Israel, as in Australia.  It does not follow that there is \"nothing sacred\" in his religion. Mr. Hartland offers me a case in point. In Mrs. Langloh Parker's Australian Legendary Tales (pp. 11, 94), are myths of low adventures of Baiame. In her More Australian Legendary Tales (pp. 84-99), is a very poetical and charming aspect of the Baiame belief. Mr. Hartland says that I will \"seek to put\" the first set of stories out of court, as \"a kind of joke with no sacredness about it\". Not I, but the Noongahburrah tribe themselves make this essential distinction. Mrs. Langloh Parker says:(1) \"The former series\" (with the low Baiame myths) \"were"]]]
