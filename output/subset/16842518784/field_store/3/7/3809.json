Since the creative composer of music is a thinker in tones, our perceptions must be so trained that, as we listen, we make sense of the fabric of sounds and rhythms.  [Footnote 7: From earliest times, mothers have doubtless crooned to their infants in instinctive lullabies.]  It is evident from the foregoing observations that our approach to the subject is to be on the intellectual side. Music, to be sure, is an emotional art and so appeals to our emotions, but these will take care of themselves. We all have a reasonable supply of emotion and practically no human being is entirely deficient in the capacity for being moved by music. We can, however, sharpen our wits and strengthen our musical memories; for it is obvious that if we cannot recognize a theme or remember it whenever it appears, often in an amplified or even subtly disguised form, we are in no condition to follow and appreciate the logical growth and development of the themes themselves which, in a work of music, are just as real beings as the \"dramatis personae\" in a play. The would-be appreciator should early recognize the fact that listening to music is by no means passive, a means of light amusement or to pass the time, but demands coöperation of an active nature. Whether or not we have the emotional capacity of a creator of music may remain an open question; but by systematic mental application we _can_, as we listen to it, get from the music that sense which the composer meant to convey. Music--more than the other arts--demands, to use a happy expression of D.G. Mason, that we \"mentally organize our sensations and ideas\"; for the language of music has no such fixed grammar as verbal modes of expression, and the message, even when received, is suggestive rather than definite. In this way only can the composition be recreated in our imaginations. For acquiring this habit of mind, this alertness and concentration, the start, as always, is more than half the battle. Schumann's good advice to young composers may be transferred to the listener: \"Be sure that you invent a thoroughly vital theme; the rest will grow of itself from this.\" Likewise in listening to music, one should be sure to grasp the opening theme, the fundamental motive, in order to follow it intelligently and to enjoy its subsequent growth into the complete work.[8]  [Footnote 8: In this connection we cannot refrain from suggesting the improvement which should be made in the concert manners of the public. How often, at the beginning of a concert, do we see people removing their wraps, looking at their neighbors, reading the programme book, etc., instead of concentrating on the music itself; with the result that the composition is often well on its way before such people have found their bearings.]  Every piece of music, with the exception of intentionally rhapsodic utterances, begins with some group of notes of distinct rhythmic and melodic interest, which is the germ--the generative force--of the whole, and which is comparable to the text of a sermon or the subject of a drama. This introductory group of notes is called, technically, a _motive_ or moving force and may be defined as _the simplest unit of imaginative life in terms of rhythm and sound_, which instantly impresses itself upon our consciousness and, when heard several times, cannot be forgotten or confused with any other motive. A musical theme--a longer sweep of thought (to be explained later)--may consist of several motives of which the first is generally the most important. Just here lies the difference between the Heaven-born themes of a truly creative composer and the bundle of notes put forth by lesser men. These living themes pierce our imaginations and sing in our memories, sometimes for years, whereas the inept and flabby tunes of certain so-called composers make no strong impression and are forgotten almost as soon as heard. Motives obviously differ from each other in regard to the intervals of the tones composing them, _i.e._, the up and down relationship in pitch, the duration of the tones and their grouping into metric schemes. But a real motive is always terse, concise, characteristic and pregnant with unrevealed meaning. The chief glory of such creative tone-poets as Beethoven, Wagner, Brahms and Franck is that their imaginations could give birth to musical offspring that live for ever and are loved like life itself. The first step, then, in the progress of the appreciator of music is the recognition of the chief motive or motives of a composition and the development of power to follow them in their organic growth. This ability is particularly necessary in modern music: for frequently all four movements of a symphony or string-quartet are based upon a motive which keeps appearing--often in altered form and in relationships which imply a dramatic or suggestive meaning. A few of such motives are cited herewith, taken from works with which, as we proceed, we shall become familiar.  [Music: CÉSAR FRANCK: _Symphony in D minor_]  [Music: BRAHMS: _First Symphony in C minor_]  [Music: TCHAIKOWSKY: _5th Symphony_]  [Music: DVO[VR]ÁK: Symphony _From the New World_]  It is now necessary for the student to know something about the constructive principles by which large works of music are fashioned; not so much that he could compose these works himself, even if he had the inspiration, but to know enough, so that the reception of the music is not a haphazard activity but an intellectual achievement, second only to that of the original creator. Every genuine work of art in whatever medium, stone, color, word or tone, must exhibit _unity of general effect with variety of detail_. That is, the material must hold together, be coherent and convince the participant of the logical design of the artist; not fall apart as might a bad building, or be diffuse as a poorly written essay. And yet, with this coherence, there must always be stimulating and refreshing variety; for a too constant insistence on the main material produces intolerable monotony, such as the \"damnable iteration\" of a mediocre prose work or the harping away on one theme by the hack composer. In no art more than music is this dual standard of greater importance, and in no art more difficult to attain. For the raw material of music, fleeting rhythms and waves of sound, is in its very nature most incoherent. Here we are not dealing with the concrete, tangible and definite material which is available for all the other arts, but with something intangible and elusive. We know from the historical record[9] of musical development, that, only after centuries of experimentation conducted by some of the best intellects in Europe, was sufficient coherence gained so that there could be composed music which would compare with the simplest modern hymn-tune or part-song. And this was long after each of the other arts--architecture, sculpture, painting and literature--had reached points of attainment which, in many respects, have never since been equalled.  [Footnote 9: Compare Parry's _Evolution of the Art of Music_, passim and D.G. Mason's _Beethoven and his Forerunners_, Chapter I.]  Before carrying our inquiries further, something must be said about the two main lines of musical development which led up to music as we know it to-day. These tendencies are designated by the terms _Homophonic_ and _Polyphonic_. By homophonic,[10] from Greek words signifying a \"single voice,\" is meant music consisting of a _single_ melodic line, as in the whole field of folk-songs (which originally were always unaccompanied) or in the unison chants of the Greeks and the Gregorian tones of the early church, in which there is _one melody_ though many voices may unite in singing it. Later we shall see what important principles for the growth of instrumental music were borrowed from the instinctive practise associated with the folk-song and folk-dance. But history makes clear that the fundamental principles of musical coherence were worked out in the field of music known as the _Polyphonic_. By this term, as the derivation implies, is meant music the fabric of which is made by the interweaving of _several_ independent melodies. For many centuries the most reliable instrument was the human voice and the only art-music, _i.e._, music which was the result of conscious mental and artistic endeavor, was vocal music for groups of unaccompanied voices in the liturgy of the church. About the tenth century, musicians tried the crude experiment,[11] called Organum, of making two groups of singers move in parallel fifths _e.g._,  [Music: Tu Patris sempiternus es Filius.]  but during the 13th and 14th centuries a method was worked out by which the introductory tune was made to generate its own subsequent tissue. It was found that a body of singers could announce a melody of a certain type and that, after they had proceeded so far, a second set of singers could repeat the opening melodic phrase--and so likewise often a third and a fourth set--and that all the voices could be made to blend together in a fairly harmonious whole.[12] A piece of music of this systematic structure is called a _Round_ because the singers take up the melody in _rotation_ and at regular rhythmic periods.[13] The earliest specimen of a Round is the famous one \"Sumer is icumen in\" circa 1225 (see Supplement of musical Examples No. 1), which shows to what a high point of perfection--considering those early days--musicians had brought their art. For, at any rate, by these systematic, imitative repetitions they had secured the first requisite of all music, coherence. This principle, once it was sanctioned by growing musical instinct, and approved by convention, was developed into such well-known types of"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30583"],["title","The Asses of Balaam (#1)"],["body","disliked and were disgusted by a snith because of the uncanny resemblance the stupid beast had to the appearance of Dodeth's own race. There could be no question of the genetic linkage between the two species, but, in spite of the physical similarities, their actions were controlled almost entirely by instinct instead of reason. They were like some sort of idiot parody of intelligent beings.  But it was their similarity which made them loathsome. Why should Dodeth Pell feel a like emotion when he saw the bathygraphs of the two-legged thing? Certainly there was no similarity.  Wait a minute!  He looked carefully at the three-dimensional pictures again.  Fry it! He couldn't be sure--  After all, he wasn't a geneticist. Checking the files wouldn't be enough; he wouldn't know how to ask the proper cross-filing questions.  He lolled his tongue out and absently rasped at a slight itch on the back of his hand while he thought.  If his hunch were correct, then it was time to call in outside help now, instead of waiting for more information. Still, he needn't necessarily call in official expert help just yet. If he could just get a lead--enough to verify or disprove the possibility of his hunch being correct--that would be enough for a day or two, until Wygor got more data.  There was always Yerdeth, an older parabrother on his prime-father's side. Yerdeth had studied genetics--theoretical, not applied--with the thought of going into Control, and kept on dabbling in it even after he had discovered that his talents lay in the robot design field.  \"Ardan!\" he said sharply.  At the other end of the office, the robot assistant ceased his work for a moment. \"Yes, sir?\"  \"Come here a minute; I want you to look at something.\"  \"Yes, sir.\"  The robot's segmented body was built very much like Dodeth's own, except that instead of the twelve pairs of legs that supported Dodeth's body, the robot was equipped with wheels, each suspended separately and equipped with its individual power source. Ardan rolled sedately across the floor, his metallic body gleaming in the light from the low ceiling. He came to a halt in front of Dodeth's business bench.  Dodeth handed Ardan the thin data booklet. \"Scan through that.\"  Ardan went through it rapidly, his eyes carefully scanning each page, his brain recording everything permanently. After a few seconds, he looked back up at Dodeth. \"A new species.\"  \"Exactly. Did you notice anything odd about their appearance?\"  \"Naturally,\" said Ardan. \"Since their like has never been seen before, it is axiomatic that they would appear odd.\"  _Fry it!_ Dodeth thought. He should have known better than to ask a question like that of Ardan. To ask it to determine what might be called second-order strangeness in a pattern that was strange in the first place was asking too much of a robot.  \"Very well, then. Make an appointment for this evening with Yerdeth Pell. I would like to see him at his home if it is convenient.\"  \"Yes, sir,\" said the robot.         *       *       *       *       *  Evening was four work-periods away, and even after Yerdeth had granted the appointment, Dodeth found himself fidgeting in anticipation.  Twice, during the following work periods, Wygor came in with more information. He had gone above ground with a group of protection robots, finally, to take a look at the new animals himself, but he hadn't yet managed to obtain enough data to make a definitive report on the strange beasts.  But the lack of data was, in itself, significant.  Dodeth usually liked to walk through the broad tunnels of the main thoroughfares, since he didn't particularly care to ride robot-back for so short a distance, but this time he was in such a hurry to see Yerdeth that he decided to let Ardan take him.  He climbed aboard, clamped his legs to the robot's sides, and said: \"To Yerdeth Pell's.\"  The robot said \"Yes, sir,\" and rolled out to the side tunnel that led toward one of the main robot tunnels. When they finally came to a tunnel labeled _Robots and Passengers Only_, Ardan rolled into it and revved his wheels up to high speed, shooting down the tunnelway at a much higher velocity than Dodeth could possibly have run.  The tunnelway was crowded with passenger-carrying robots, and with robots alone, carrying out orders from their masters. But there was no danger; no robot could harm any of Dodeth's race, nor could any robot stand idly by while someone was harmed. Even in the most crowded of conditions, every robot in the area had one thing foremost in his mind: the safety of every human within sight or hearing.  Dodeth ignored the traffic altogether. He had other things to think about, and he knew--without even bothering to consider it--that Ardan could be relied upon to take care of everything. Even if it cost him his own pseudolife, Ardan would do everything in his power to preserve the safety and health of his passenger. Once in a while, in unusual circumstances, a robot would even disobey orders to save a life, for obedience was strictly secondary to the sanctity of human life, just as the robot's desire to preserve his own pseudoliving existence was outranked by the desire to obey.  Dodeth thought about his job, but he carefully kept his mind off the new beasts. He knew that fussing in his mind over them wouldn't do him any good until he had more to work with--things which only his parabrother, Yerdeth, could supply him. Besides, there was the problem of what to do about the hurkle breeding sites, which were being encroached upon by the quiggies. Some of the swamps on the surface, especially those that approached the Hot Belts, were being dried out and filled with dust, which decreased the area where the hurkle could lay its eggs, but increased the nesting sites for quiggies.  That, of course, was a yearly cycle, in general. As the Blue Sun moved from one side to the other, and the winds shifted accordingly, the swamps near the Twilight Border would dry out or fill up accordingly. But this year the eastern swamps weren't filling up as they should, and some precautionary measures would have to be taken to prevent too great a shift in the hurkle-quiggie balance.  Then there was the compensating migratory shift of the Hotland beasts--those which lived in the areas where the slanting rays of the Blue Sun could actually touch them, and which could not stand the, to them, terrible cold of the Darklands. Instead, they moved back and forth with the Blue Sun and remained in their own area--a hot, dry, fiery-bright hinterland occupied only by gnurrs, gpoles, and other horrendous beasts.  Beyond those areas, according to the robot patrols which had reconnoitered there, nothing lived. Nothing could. No protoplasmic being could exist under the direct rays of the Blue Sun. Even the metal-and-translite bodies of a robot wouldn't long protect the sensitive mechanisms within from the furnace heat of the huge star.  Each species had its niche in the World. Some, like the hurkle, lived in swamp water. Others lived in lakes and streams. Still others flew in the skies or roamed the surface or climbed the great trees. Some, like Dodeth's own people, lived beneath the surface.  The one thing an intelligent species had to be most careful about was not to disturb the balance with their abilities, but to work to preserve it. In the past, there had been those who had built cities on the surface, but the cities had removed the natural growth from large areas, which, in turn, had forced the city people to import their food from outside the cities. And that had meant an enforced increase in the cultivation of the remaining soil, which destroyed the habitats of other animals, besides depleting the soil itself. The only sensible way was to live _under_ the farmlands, so that no man was ever more than a few hundred feet from the food supply. The Universal Motivator had chosen that their species should evolve in burrows beneath the surface, and if that was the niche chosen for Dodeth's people, then that was obviously where they should remain to keep the Balance.  Of course, the snith, too, was an underground animal, though the tunnels were unlined. The snith's tunnels ran between and around the armored tunnels of Dodeth's people, so that each city surrounded the other without contact--if the burrows of the snith could properly be called a city.  \"Yerdeth Pell's residence,\" said Ardan.  \"Ah, yes.\" Dodeth, his thoughts interrupted, slid off the back of the robot and flexed his legs. \"Wait here, Ardan. I'll be back in an hour or so.\" Then he scrambled over to the door which led to Yerdeth's apartment.  [Illustration]         *       *       *       *       *  Twenty minutes later, Yerdeth Pell looked up from the data book facsimiles and scanned Dodeth's face with appraising eyes.  \"Very cute,\" he said at last, with a slight chuckle. \"Now, what I want to know is: is someone playing a joke on you, or are you playing a joke on me?\"  Dodeth's eyelids slid upwards in a fast blink of surprise. \"What do you mean?\"  \"Why, these bathygraphs.\" Yerdeth rapped the bathygraphs with a wrinkled, horny hand. He was a good deal older than Dodeth, and his voice had a tendency to rasp a little when the frequency went above twenty thousand cycles. \"They're very good, of course. _Very_ good. The models have very fine detail to them. The eyes, especially are good; they look as if they really _ought_ to be built that way.\" He smiled and looked up at Dodeth.  Dodeth resisted an urge to ripple a stomp. \"Well?\" he said impatiently.  \"Well, they can't be real, you know,\" Yerdeth replied mildly.  \"Why not?\"  \"Oh, come, now, Dodeth. What did it evolve from? An animal doesn't just spring out of nowhere, you know.\"  \"New species are discovered occasionally,\" Dodeth said. \"And there are plenty of mutants and just plain freaks.\"  \"Certainly, certainly. But you don't hatch a snith out of a hurkle egg. Where are your intermediate stages?\"  \"Is it possible that we"]]]
