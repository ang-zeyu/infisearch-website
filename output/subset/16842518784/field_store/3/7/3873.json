I cannot bear it any longer! the whole day is so long, and the evenings are still longer! here it is not at all as it is over the way at your home, where your father and mother spoke so pleasantly, and where you and all your sweet children made such a delightful noise. Nay, how lonely the old man is!--do you think that he gets kisses? do you think he gets mild eyes, or a Christmas tree?--He will get nothing but a grave.--I can bear it no longer!\"  \"You must not let it grieve you so much,\" said the little boy; \"I find it so very delightful here, and then all the old thoughts, with what they may bring with them, they come and visit here.\"  \"Yes, it's all very well, but I see nothing of them, and I don't know them!\" said the pewter soldier, \"I cannot bear it!\"  \"But you must!\" said the little boy.  Then in came the old man with the most pleased and happy face, the most delicious preserves, apples, and nuts, and so the little boy thought no more about the pewter soldier.  The little boy returned home happy and pleased, and weeks and days passed away, and nods were made to the old house, and from the old house, and then the little boy went over there again.  The carved trumpeters blew, \"trateratra! there is the little boy! trateratra!\" and the swords and armor on the knights' portraits rattled, and the silk gowns rustled; the hog's-leather spoke, and the old chairs had the gout in their legs and rheumatism in their backs: Ugh!--it was exactly like the first time, for over there one day and hour was just like another.  \"I cannot bear it!\" said the pewter soldier, \"I have shed pewter tears! it is too melancholy! rather let me go to the wars and lose arms and legs! it would at least be a change. I cannot bear it longer!--Now, I know what it is to have a visit from one's old thoughts, with what they may bring with them! I have had a visit from mine, and you may be sure it is no pleasant thing in the end; I was at last about to jump down from the drawers.  \"I saw you all over there at home so distinctly, as if you really were here; it was again that Sunday morning; all you children stood before the table and sung your Psalms, as you do every morning. You stood devoutly with folded hands; and father and mother were just as pious; and then the door was opened, and little sister Mary, who is not two years old yet, and who always dances when she hears music or singing, of whatever kind it may be, was put into the room--though she ought not to have been there--and then she began to dance, but could not keep time, because the tones were so long; and then she stood, first on the one leg, and bent her head forwards, and then on the other leg, and bent her head forwards--but all would not do. You stood very seriously all together, although it was difficult enough; but I laughed to myself, and then I fell off the table, and got a bump, which I have still--for it was not right of me to laugh. But the whole now passes before me again in thought, and everything that I have lived to see; and these are the old thoughts, with what they may bring with them.  \"Tell me if you still sing on Sundays? Tell me something about little Mary! and how my comrade, the other pewter soldier, lives! Yes, he is happy enough, that's sure! I cannot bear it any longer!\"  \"You are given away as a present!\" said the little boy; \"you must remain. Can you not understand that?\"  The old man now came with a drawer, in which there was much to be seen, both \"tin boxes\" and \"balsam boxes,\" old cards, so large and so gilded, such as one never sees them now. And several drawers were opened, and the piano was opened; it had landscapes on the inside of the lid, and it was so hoarse when the old man played on it! and then he hummed a song.  \"Yes, she could sing that!\" said he, and nodded to the portrait, which he had bought at the broker's, and the old man's eyes shone so bright!  \"I will go to the wars! I will go to the wars!\" shouted the pewter soldier as loud as he could, and threw himself off the drawers right down on the floor.  What became of him? The old man sought, and the little boy sought; he was away, and he stayed away.  \"I shall find him!\" said the old man; but he never found him. The floor was too open--the pewter soldier had fallen through a crevice, and there he lay as in an open tomb.  That day passed, and the little boy went home, and that week passed, and several weeks too. The windows were quite frozen, the little boy was obliged to sit and breathe on them to get a peep-hole over to the old house, and there the snow had been blown into all the carved work and inscriptions; it lay quite up over the steps, just as if there was no one at home;--nor was there any one at home--the old man was dead!  In the evening there was a hearse seen before the door, and he was borne into it in his coffin: he was now to go out into the country, to lie in his grave. He was driven out there, but no one followed; all his friends were dead, and the little boy kissed his hand to the coffin as it was driven away.  Some days afterwards there was an auction at the old house, and the little boy saw from his window how they carried the old knights and the old ladies away, the flower-pots with the long ears, the old chairs, and the old clothes-presses. Something came here, and something came there; the portrait of her who had been found at the broker's came to the broker's again; and there it hung, for no one knew her more--no one cared about the old picture.  In the spring they pulled the house down, for, as people said, it was a ruin. One could see from the street right into the room with the hog's-leather hanging, which was slashed and torn; and the green grass and leaves about the balcony hung quite wild about the falling beams.--And then it was put to rights.  \"That was a relief,\" said the neighboring houses.    * * * * *   A fine house was built there, with large windows, and smooth white walls; but before it, where the old house had in fact stood, was a little garden laid out, and a wild grapevine ran up the wall of the neighboring house. Before the garden there was a large iron railing with an iron door, it looked quite splendid, and people stood still and peeped in, and the sparrows hung by scores in the vine, and chattered away at each other as well as they could, but it was not about the old house, for they could not remember it, so many years had passed,--so many that the little boy had grown up to a whole man, yes, a clever man, and a pleasure to his parents; and he had just been married, and, together with his little wife, had come to live in the house here, where the garden was; and he stood by her there whilst she planted a field-flower that she found so pretty; she planted it with her little hand, and pressed the earth around it with her fingers. Oh! what was that? She had stuck herself. There sat something pointed, straight out of the soft mould.  It was----yes, guess!--it was the pewter soldier, he that was lost up at the old man's, and had tumbled and turned about amongst the timber and the rubbish, and had at last laid for many years in the ground.  The young wife wiped the dirt off the soldier, first with a green leaf, and then with her fine handkerchief--it had such a delightful smell, that it was to the pewter soldier just as if he had awaked from a trance.  \"Let me see him,\" said the young man. He laughed, and then shook his head. \"Nay, it cannot be he; but he reminds me of a story about a pewter soldier which I had when I was a little boy!\" And then he told his wife about the old house, and the old man, and about the pewter soldier that he sent over to him because he was so very, very lonely; and he told it as correctly as it had really been, so that the tears came into the eyes of his young wife, on account of the old house and the old man.  \"It may possibly be, however, that it is the same pewter soldier!\" said she, \"I will take care of it, and remember all that you have told me; but you must show me the old man's grave!\"  \"But I do not know it,\" said he, \"and no one knows it! all his friends were dead, no one took care of it, and I was then a little boy!\"  \"How very, very lonely he must have been!\" said she.  \"Very, very lonely!\" said the pewter soldier; \"but it is delightful not to be forgotten!\"  \"Delightful!\" shouted something close by; but no one, except the pewter soldier, saw that it was a piece of the hog's-leather hangings; it had lost all its gilding, it looked like a piece of wet clay, but it had an opinion, and it gave it:      \"The gilding decays,     But hog's leather stays!\"  This the pewter soldier did not believe.   ------------    THE DROP OF WATER.  What a magnifying glass is, you surely know--such a round sort of spectacle-glass that makes everything full a hundred times larger than it really is. When one holds it before the eye, and looks at a drop of water out of the pond, then one sees above a thousand strange creatures. It looks almost like a whole plateful of shrimps springing about among each other, and they are so ravenous, they tear one another's arms and legs, tails and sides, and yet they are glad and pleased in their way.  Now, there was once an old man, who was called by every body Creep-and-Crawl; for that was his name. He would always make the best out of everything, and when he could not make anything out of it he resorted to witchcraft.  Now, one day he sat and held his magnifying glass before his eye, and looked at a drop of water that was taken out of a little pool in the ditch. What a creeping and crawling was there! all the thousands of small creatures hopped and jumped about, pulled one another, and pecked one another.  \"But this is abominable!\" said Creep-and-Crawl, \"Can one not get them to live in peace and quiet, and each mind his own business?\" And he thought and thought, but he could come to no conclusion, and so he was obliged to conjure. \"I must give"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31103"],["title","A Christmas Greeting: A Series of Stories (#2)"],["body","a color, that they may be more discernible!\" said he; and so he poured something like a little drop of red wine into the drop of water, but it was bewitched blood from the lobe of the ear--the very finest sort for a penny; and then all the strange creatures became rose-colored over the whole body. It looked like a whole town of naked savages.  \"What have you got there?\" said another old wizard, who had no name, and that was just the best of it.  \"Why,\" said Creep-and-Crawl, \"if you can guess what it is, I will make you a present of it; but it is not so easy to find out when one does not know it!\"  The wizard who had no name looked through the magnifying glass. It actually appeared like a whole town, where all the inhabitants ran about without clothes! it was terrible, but still more terrible to see how the one knocked and pushed the other, bit each other, and drew one another about. What was undermost should be topmost, and what was topmost should be undermost!--See there, now! his leg is longer than mine!--whip it off, and away with it! There is one that has a little lump behind the ear, a little innocent lump, but it pains him, and so it shall pain him still more! And they pecked at it, and they dragged him about, and they ate him, and all on account of the little lump. There sat one as still as a little maid, who only wished for peace and quietness, but she must be brought out and they dragged her, and they pulled her, and they devoured her!  \"It is quite amusing!\" said the wizard.  \"Yes; but what do you think it is?\" asked Creep-and-Crawl. \"Can you find it out!\"  \"It is very easy to see,\" said the other, \"it is some great city, they all resemble each other. A great city it is, that's sure!\"  \"It is ditch-water!\" said Creep-and-Crawl.   ------------    THE HAPPY FAMILY.  Really, the largest green leaf in this country is a dock-leaf; if one holds it before one, it is like a whole apron, and if one holds it over one's head in rainy weather, it is almost as good as an umbrella, for it is so immensely large. The burdock never grows alone, but where there grows one there always grow several: it is a great delight, and all this delightfulness is snails' food. The great white snails which persons of quality in former times made fricassees of, ate, and said, \"Hem, hem! how delicious!\" for they thought it tasted so delicate--lived on dock leaves, and therefore burdock seeds were sown.  Now, there was an old manor-house, where they no longer ate snails, they were quite extinct; but the burdocks were not extinct, they grew and grew all over the walks and all the beds; they could not get the mastery over them--it was a whole forest of burdocks. Here and there stood an apple and a plumb-tree, or else one never would have thought that it was a garden; all was burdocks, and there lived the two last venerable old snails.  They themselves knew not how old they were, but they could remember very well that there had been many more; that they were of a family from foreign lands, and that for them and theirs the whole forest was planted. They had never been outside it, but they knew that there was still something more in the world, which was called the manor-house, and that there they were boiled, and then they became black, and were then placed on a silver dish; but what happened further they knew not; or, in fact, what it was to be boiled, and to lie on a silver dish, they could not possibly imagine; but it was said to be delightful, and particularly genteel. Neither the chafers, the toads, nor the earth-worms, whom they asked about it could give them any information,--none of them had been boiled or laid on a silver dish.  The old white snails were the first persons of distinction in the world, that they knew; the forest was planted for their sake, and the manor-house was there that they might be boiled and laid on a silver dish.  Now they lived a very lonely and happy life; and as they had no children themselves, they had adopted a little common snail, which they brought up as their own; but the little one would not grow, for he was of a common family; but the old ones, especially Dame Mother Snail, thought they could observe how he increased in size, and she begged father, if he could not see it, that he would at least feel the little snail's shell; and then he felt it, and found the good dame was right.  One day there was a heavy storm of rain.  \"Hear how it beats like a drum on the dock leaves!\" said Father Snail.  \"There are also rain-drops!\" said Mother Snail; \"and now the rain pours right down the stalk! You will see that it will be wet here! I am very happy to think that we have our good house, and the little one has his also! There is more done for us than for all other creatures, sure enough; but can you not see that we are folks of quality in the world? We are provided with a house from our birth, and the burdock forest is planted for our sakes! I should like to know how far it extends, and what there is outside!\"  \"There is nothing at all,\" said Father Snail. \"No place can be better than ours, and I have nothing to wish for!\"  \"Yes,\" said the dame. \"I would willingly go to the manor-house, be boiled, and laid on a silver dish; all our forefathers have been treated so; there is something extraordinary in it, you may be sure!\"  \"The manor-house has most likely fallen to ruin!\" said Father Snail. \"or the burdocks have grown up over it, so that they cannot come out. There need not, however, be any haste about that; but you are always in such a tremendous hurry, and the little one is beginning to be the same. Has he not been creeping up that stalk these three days? It gives me a headache when I look up to him!\"  \"You must not scold him,\" said Mother Snail; \"he creeps so carefully; he will afford us much pleasure--and we have nothing but him to live for! But have you not thought of it?--where shall we get a wife for him? Do you not think that there are some of our species at a great distance in the interior of the burdock forest?\"  \"Black snails, I dare say, there are enough of,\" said the old one--\"black snails without a house--but they are so common, and so conceited. But we might give the ants a commission to look out for us; they run to and fro as if they had something to do, and they certainly know of a wife for our little snail!\"  \"I know one, sure enough--the most charming one!\" said one of the ants; \"but I am afraid we shall hardly succeed, for she is a queen!\"  \"That is nothing!\" said the old folks; \"has she a house?\"  \"She has a palace!\" said the ant--\"the finest ant's palace, with seven hundred passages!\"  \"I thank you!\" said Mother Snail; \"our son shall not go into an ant-hill; if you know nothing better than that, we shall give the commission to the white gnats. They fly far and wide, in rain and sunshine; they know the whole forest here, both within and without.\"  \"We have a wife for him,\" said the gnats; \"at a hundred human paces from here there sits a little snail in her house, on a gooseberry bush; she is quite lonely, and old enough to be married. It is only a hundred human paces!\"  \"Well, then, let her come to him!\" said the old ones; \"he has a whole forest of burdocks, she has only a bush!\"  And so they went and fetched little Miss Snail. It was a whole week before she arrived; but therein was just the very best of it, for one could thus see that she was of the same species.  And then the marriage was celebrated. Six earth-worms shone as well as they could. In other respects the whole went off very quietly, for the old folks could not bear noise and merriment; but old Dame Snail made a brilliant speech. Father Snail could not speak, he was too much affected; and so they gave them as a dowry and inheritance, the whole forest of burdocks, and said--what they had always said--that it was the best in the world; and if they lived honestly and decently, and increased and multiplied, they and their children would once in the course of time come to the manor-house, be boiled black, and laid on silver dishes. After this speech was made, the old ones crept into their shells, and never more came out. They slept; the young couple governed in the forest, and had a numerous progeny, but they were never boiled, and never came on the silver dishes; so from this they concluded that the manor-house had fallen to ruins, and that all the men in the world were extinct; and as no one contradicted them, so, of course it was so. And the rain beat on the dock-leaves to make drum-music for their sake, and the sun shone in order to give the burdock forest a color for their sakes; and they were very happy, and the whole family was happy; for they, indeed were so.   ------------    THE STORY OF A MOTHER  A mother sat there with her little child. She was so downcast, so afraid that it should die! It was so pale, the small eyes had closed themselves, and it drew its breath so softly, now and then, with a deep respiration, as if it sighed; and the mother looked still more sorrowfully on the little creature.  Then a knocking was heard at the door, and in came a poor old, man wrapped up as in a large horse-cloth, for it warms one, and he needed it, as it was the cold winter season! Every thing out of doors was covered with ice and snow, and the wind blew so that it cut the face.  As the old man trembled with cold, and the little child slept a moment, the mother went and poured some ale into a pot and set it on the stove, that it might be warm for him; the old man sat and rocked the cradle, and the mother sat down on a chair close by him, and looked at her little sick child that drew its breath so deep, and raised its little hand.  \"Do you not think that I shall save him?\" said she, \"_Our Lord_ will not take him from me!\"  And the old man,--it was Death himself,--he nodded so strangely, it could just as well signify yes as no. And the mother looked down in her lap, and the tears ran down over her cheeks; her head became so heavy--"]]]
