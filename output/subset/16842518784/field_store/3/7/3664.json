And then he heard someone chuckle amusedly and felt the curious furry sensation of electric anesthesia beginning....         *       *       *       *       *  When he came to himself again a machine was clicking erratically and there was the soft whine of machinery going somewhere. He opened his eyes and saw red all about him. He stirred, and he was free. Painfully, he sat up and blinked about him with streaming, gas-irritated eyes. He had been lying on a couch. He was in a room perhaps fifteen feet by twenty, of which the floor was slightly off-level. And everything in the room was red. Floor and walls and ceiling, the couch he had lain on and the furniture itself. There was a monstrous bulk of a man sitting comfortably in a chair on the other side of the room, pecking at a device resembling a writing-machine.  Thorn sat still for an instant, gaining strength. Then he flung himself desperately across the room, his fingers curved into talons.  Five feet, ten, with the slant of the floor giving him added impetus.... Then his muscles tightened convulsively. A wave of pure agony went through his body. He dropped and lay writhing on the floor, while the high-frequency currents of an induction-screen had their way with him. He was doubled into a knot by his muscles responding to the electric stimulus instead of his will. Sheer anguish twisted him. And the room filled with a hearty bellow of laughter. The monstrous whiskered man had turned about and was shaking with merriment.  He picked up a pocket-gun from beside him and turned off a switch at his elbow. Thorn's muscles were freed.  \"Go back, my friendt,\" boomed the same voice that had come from a speaker the night before. \"Go to der couch. You amuse me and you haff already been useful, but I shall haff no hesitation in killing you. You are Thorn Hardt. My name is Kreynborg. How do you do?\"  \"Where's my friend?\" demanded Thorn savagely. \"Where is she?\"  \"Der lady friendt? There!\" The whiskered man pointed negligently with the pocket-gun. \"I gafe her a bunk to slumber in.\"         *       *       *       *       *  There was a niche in the wall, which Thorn had not seen. Sylva was there, sleeping the same heavy, dreamless sleep from which Thorn himself had just awakened. He went to her swiftly. She was breathing naturally, though tears from the irritating gas still streaked her face and her skin seemed to be pinkened a little from the same cause.  Thorn swung around. His weapons were gone, of course. The huge man snapped on the induction-screen switch again and put down his weapon. With that screen separating the room into two halves, no living thing could cross it without either such muscular paralysis as Thorn had just experienced, or death. Coils in the floor induced alternating currents in the flesh itself, very like those currents used for supposed medical effects in \"medical batteries,\" and \"shockers.\"  \"Be calm!\" said Kreynborg, chuckling. \"I am pleased to haff company. This is der loneliest spot in der Rockies. It was chosen for that reason. But I shall be here for maybe months, and now I shall not be lonely. We of der Com-Pubs haff scientific resources such as your fools haff nefer dreamed of, but there is no scientific substitute for a pretty woman.\"  He turned again to the writing device. It clicked half a dozen times more, and he stopped. A strip of paper came out of it. He inserted it into the slot of another mechanism and switched on a standard G.C. phone as the paper began to feed. In seconds the room was filled with unearthly hoots and wails and whistles. They came from the device into which the paper was feeding, and they poured into the G.C. transmitter. They went on for nearly a minute, and ceased. Kreynborg shut off the transmitter.  \"My code,\" he observed comfortably, \"gifing der good news to Stalingrad. Everything is going along beautifully. I roused der fair Sylva and kissed her a few times to make her scream into a record, and I interpolated her screamings into der last code transmission. Your wise men think der Martians haff vivisected her. They are concentrating der entire fighting force of der United Nations outside der dome of force. And all for a few kisses!\"         *       *       *       *       *  Thorn was white with rage. His eyes burned with a terrible fury. His hands shook. Kreynborg chuckled again.  \"Oh, she is unharmed--so far. I haff not much time now. Presently der two of you will while away der time. But not now.\"  He switched on the G.C. receiver and the room filled with a multitude of messages. Thorn sat beside Sylva, watching, watching, watching, while invisible machinery whined softly and Kreynborg listened intently to the crisp, curt official reports that came through on the Fighting Force band. Three combat-squadrons were on the spot now; One, Three and Eight. Four more were coming at fast cruising speed--four hundred miles an hour. One combat-squadron of the whole fleet alone would be left to cope with all other emergencies that might arise.... A television screen lighted up and Thorn could see where the lenses on the bulbous tower showed the air all about filled with fighting-planes, hovering about the dome of force like moths beating their wings against a screen. The strongest fighting-force in the world, helpless against a field of electric energy!  \"It is amusing,\" chuckled Kreynborg, looking at the screen complacently. \"Der dome of force is a new infention. It is a heterodyning of one frequency upon another at a predetermined distance. It has all der properties of matter except mass and a limit of strength. There is no limit to its strength! But it cannot be made except in a sphere, so at first it seemed only a defensif weapon. With it, we could defy der United Nations to attack us. But we wished to do more. So I proposed a plan, and I haff der honor of carrying it out. If I fail, Krassin disavows me. But I shall not fail, and I shall end as Commissar for der continent of North America!\"         *       *       *       *       *  He looked wisely at Thorn, who sat motionless.  \"You keep quiet, eh, and wait for me to say something indiscreet? Ferry well, I tell you. We are in a sort of gold-fish globe of electric force. Your air fleet cannot break in. You know that! Also, if they were in they could not break out again. So I wait, fery patiently pretending to be a Martian until all your Fighting Force has gathered around in readiness to fight me. But I shall not fight. I shall simply make a new and larger gold-fish globe, outside of this one. And then I go out and make faces at der Fighting Force of der United Nations imprisoned between der two of them--and then der Com-Pub fleet comes ofer!\"  He stood up and put his hand on a door-knob.  \"Is it not pretty?\" he asked blandly. \"In two weeks der air fleet will begin to starfe. In three, there will be cannibalism, unless der Com-Pubs accept der surrender. Imagine....\" He laughed. \"But do not fear, my friendt! I haff profisions for a year. If you are amusing, I feed you. In any case I exchange food for kisses with der charming Sylva. It will be amusing to change her from a woman who screams as I kiss her, to one who weeps for joy. If I do not haff to kill you, you shall witness it!\"  He vanished through a doorway on the farther side of the room. Instantly Thorn was on his feet. The dead slumber in which Sylva was sunk was wholly familiar. Electric anesthesia, used not only for surgery, but to enforce complete rest at any chosen moment. He dragged her from that couch to his own. He saw her stir, and her eyes were instantly wide with terror. But Thorn was tearing the couch to pieces. Cover, pneumatic mattress.... He ripped out a loosely-fitting frame-piece of steel.  \"Quick, now,\" he said in a low tone, \"I'm going to short the induction-screen. We'll get across it. Then--out the door!\"         *       *       *       *       *  She struggled to her feet, terrified, but instantly game. Thorn slid the rod of metal across the stretch of flooring he had previously been unable to cross. The induced currents in the rod amounted to a short-circuit of the field. The rod grew hot and its paint blistered smokily. Thorn leaped across with Sylva in his wake. He pointed to the door, and she fled through it. He seized a chair, crashed it frenziedly into the television screen, and had switched on the G.C. phone when there was a roar of fury from Kreynborg. Instantly there was the spitting sound of a pocket-gun and in the red room the racking crash of a hexynitrate pellet. Nothing can stand the instant crash of hexynitrate. Its concussion-wave is a single pulsation of the air. The cellate diaphragm of the G.C. transmitter tore across from its violence and Thorn cursed bitterly. There was no way, now, of signaling....  A second racking crash as a second pellet flashed its tiny green flame. Kreynborg was using a pocket-gun, one of those small terrible weapons which shoot a projectile barely larger than the graphite of a lead pencil, but loaded with a fraction of a milligram of hexynitrate. Two hundred charges would feed automatically into the bore as the trigger was pressed.  Thorn gazed desperately about for weapons. There was nothing in sight. To gain the outside world he had to pass before the doorway through which the bullets had come.... And suddenly Thorn seized the code-writer and the device which transmitted that code as a series of unearthly noises which the world was taking for Martian speech. He swung the two machines before the door in a temporary barrier. Whatever else Kreynborg might be willing to destroy, he would not shoot into them!  Thorn leaped madly past the door as Kreynborg roared with rage again. He paused only to hurl a chair at the two essential machines, and as they dented and toppled, he fled through the door and away.         *       *       *       *       *  Sylva peered anxiously at him from behind a huge boulder.

Service to the customer is our job and we know it well.\"  Carrin wavered visibly.  \"And after you're gone, sir, they'll all belong to your son.\"  That was true, Carrin thought. His son would have all the marvelous things that filled the house. And after all, it was only thirty years out of a life expectancy of a hundred and fifty.  He signed with a flourish.  \"Excellent!\" Pathis said. \"And by the way, has your home got an A. E. Master-operator?\"  It hadn't. Pathis explained that a Master-operator was new this year, a stupendous advance in scientific engineering. It was designed to take over all the functions of housecleaning and cooking, without its owner having to lift a finger.  \"Instead of running around all day, pushing half a dozen different buttons, with the Master-operator all you have to do is push _one_! A remarkable achievement!\"  Since it was only five hundred and thirty-five dollars, Carrin signed for one, having it added to his son's debt.  Right's right, he thought, walking Pathis to the door. This house will be Billy's some day. His and his wife's. They certainly will want everything up-to-date.  Just one button, he thought. That _would_ be a time-saver!         *       *       *       *       *  After Pathis left, Carrin sat back in an adjustable chair and turned on the solido. After twisting the Ezi-dial, he discovered that there was nothing he wanted to see. He tilted back the chair and took a nap.  The something on his mind was still bothering him.  \"Hello, darling!\" He awoke to find his wife was home. She kissed him on the ear. \"Look.\"  She had bought an A. E. Sexitizer-negligee. He was pleasantly surprised that that was all she had bought. Usually, Leela returned from shopping laden down.  \"It's lovely,\" he said.  She bent over for a kiss, then giggled--a habit he knew she had picked up from the latest popular solido star. He wished she hadn't.  \"Going to dial supper,\" she said, and went to the kitchen. Carrin smiled, thinking that soon she would be able to dial the meals without moving out of the living room. He settled back in his chair, and his son walked in.  \"How's it going, Son?\" he asked heartily.  \"All right,\" Billy answered listlessly.  \"What'sa matter, Son?\" The boy stared at his feet, not answering. \"Come on, tell Dad what's the trouble.\"  Billy sat down on a packing case and put his chin in his hands. He looked thoughtfully at his father.  \"Dad, could I be a Master Repairman if I wanted to be?\"  Mr. Carrin smiled at the question. Billy alternated between wanting to be a Master Repairman and a rocket pilot. The repairmen were the elite. It was their job to fix the automatic repair machines. The repair machines could fix just about anything, but you couldn't have a machine fix the machine that fixed the machine. That was where the Master Repairmen came in.  But it was a highly competitive field and only a very few of the best brains were able to get their degrees. And, although the boy was bright, he didn't seem to have an engineering bent.  \"It's possible, Son. Anything is possible.\"  \"But is it possible for me?\"  \"I don't know,\" Carrin answered, as honestly as he could.  \"Well, I don't want to be a Master Repairman anyway,\" the boy said, seeing that the answer was no. \"I want to be a space pilot.\"  \"A space pilot, Billy?\" Leela asked, coming in to the room. \"But there aren't any.\"  \"Yes, there are,\" Billy argued. \"We were told in school that the government is going to send some men to Mars.\"  \"They've been saying that for a hundred years,\" Carrin said, \"and they still haven't gotten around to doing it.\"  \"They will this time.\"  \"Why would you want to go to Mars?\" Leela asked, winking at Carrin. \"There are no pretty girls on Mars.\"  \"I'm not interested in girls. I just want to go to Mars.\"  \"You wouldn't like it, honey,\" Leela said. \"It's a nasty old place with no air.\"  \"It's got some air. I'd like to go there,\" the boy insisted sullenly. \"I don't like it here.\"  \"What's that?\" Carrin asked, sitting up straight. \"Is there anything you haven't got? Anything you want?\"  \"No, sir. I've got everything I want.\" Whenever his son called him 'sir,' Carrin knew that something was wrong.  \"Look, Son, when I was your age I wanted to go to Mars, too. I wanted to do romantic things. I even wanted to be a Master Repairman.\"  \"Then why didn't you?\"  \"Well, I grew up. I realized that there were more important things. First I had to pay off the debt my father had left me, and then I met your mother--\"  Leela giggled.  \"--and I wanted a home of my own. It'll be the same with you. You'll pay off your debt and get married, the same as the rest of us.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Billy was silent for a while, then he brushed his dark hair--straight, like his father's--back from his forehead and wet his lips.  \"How come I have debts, sir?\"  Carrin explained carefully. About the things a family needed for civilized living, and the cost of those items. How they had to be paid. How it was customary for a son to take on a part of his parent's debt, when he came of age.  Billy's silence annoyed him. It was almost as if the boy were reproaching him. After he had slaved for years to give the ungrateful whelp every luxury!  \"Son,\" he said harshly, \"have you studied history in school? Good. Then you know how it was in the past. Wars. How would you like to get blown up in a war?\"  The boy didn't answer.  \"Or how would you like to break your back for eight hours a day, doing work a machine should handle? Or be hungry all the time? Or cold, with the rain beating down on you, and no place to sleep?\"  He paused for a response, got none and went on. \"You live in the most fortunate age mankind has ever known. You are surrounded by every wonder of art and science. The finest music, the greatest books and art, all at your fingertips. All you have to do is push a button.\" He shifted to a kindlier tone. \"Well, what are you thinking?\"  \"I was just wondering how I could go to Mars,\" the boy said. \"With the debt, I mean. I don't suppose I could get away from that.\"  \"Of course not.\"  \"Unless I stowed away on a rocket.\"  \"But you wouldn't do that.\"  \"No, of course not,\" the boy said, but his tone lacked conviction.  \"You'll stay here and marry a very nice girl,\" Leela told him.  \"Sure I will,\" Billy said. \"Sure.\" He grinned suddenly. \"I didn't mean any of that stuff about going to Mars. I really didn't.\"  \"I'm glad of that,\" Leela answered.  \"Just forget I mentioned it,\" Billy said, smiling stiffly. He stood up and raced upstairs.  \"Probably gone to play with his rockets,\" Leela said. \"He's such a little devil.\"         *       *       *       *       *  The Carrins ate a quiet supper, and then it was time for Mr. Carrin to go to work. He was on night shift this month. He kissed his wife good-by, climbed into his Jet-lash and roared to the factory. The automatic gates recognized him and opened. He parked and walked in.  Automatic lathes, automatic presses--everything was automatic. The factory was huge and bright, and the machines hummed softly to themselves, doing their job and doing it well.  Carrin walked to the end of the automatic washing machine assembly line, to relieve the man there.  \"Everything all right?\" he asked.  \"Sure,\" the man said. \"Haven't had a bad one all year. These new models here have built-in voices. They don't light up like the old ones.\"  Carrin sat down where the man had sat and waited for the first washing machine to come through. His job was the soul of simplicity. He just sat there and the machines went by him. He pressed a button on them and found out if they were all right. They always were. After passing him, the washing machines went to the packaging section.  The first one slid by on the long slide of rollers. He pressed the starting button on the side.  \"Ready for the wash,\" the washing machine said.  Carrin pressed the release and let it go by.  That boy of his, Carrin thought. Would he grow up and face his responsibilities? Would he mature and take his place in society? Carrin doubted it. The boy was a born rebel. If anyone got to Mars, it would be his kid.  But the thought didn't especially disturb him.  \"Ready for the wash.\" Another machine went by.  Carrin remembered something about Miller. The jovial man had always been talking about the planets, always kidding about going off somewhere and roughing it. He hadn't, though. He'd committed suicide.  \"Ready for the wash.\"  Carrin had eight hours in front of him, and he loosened his belt to prepare for it. Eight hours of pushing buttons and listening to a machine announce its readiness.  \"Ready for the wash.\"  He pressed the release.  \"Ready for the wash.\"  Carrin's mind strayed from the job, which didn't need much attention in any case. He wished he had done what he had longed to do as a youngster.  It would have been great to be a rocket pilot, to push a button and go to Mars.                                                       --ROBERT SHECKLEY     Transcriber's Note:      This etext was produced from _Galaxy Science Fiction_ December 1952.
