See you in the park outside the hostel.\"  \"Right.\"  Duggan's thoughts were muddled. Fingerprints probably; at every super mech hostel all guests were printed and taped, and possibly through his similar name. Short must have been suspicious from the first. And if he had come to the hostel to see Duggan's mentrol-hooded face, while Duggan worked, his identification must have been sure.  Short knew that he was Merle Duggan, and before too long Janith, and all his friends--if he had any left now--would know he had been in hiding here.  He hurried to eat and get ready for another period under the mentrol's hooded probes.  Less than half an hour later he strode out of the hostel, his super mech gleaming and clean and his jacket and shorts newly pressed. He met Rusche in the park and they headed for the lift to the upper level.  En route to the 10th Level he explained.  \"I thought you looked like somebody I should know.\" Rusche scrubbed at his pseudo beard's coarseness. \"Accident left you sort of psychoed, huh? So you was scared of the levels? Had to try coming back with a false name?\"  Duggan gulped. It made a believable sort of yarn. He hadn't taken time to concoct a story.... Why not?  \"Something like that. I guess I was badly shook, Ted.\"  \"So now you go back to being engineer at a thousand or so, and I'm still a rock hog.\" Rusche shrugged. \"Less headaches anyhow.\"  They stepped off the lift at the 10th Level and took the high speed strip toward the business section. Duggan had it in his mind to see Janith and tell her she had failed--that he was his own man again. She would be at the office. He would tell her off, and leave. And then he'd show Rusche some of the high spots of the low-number levels of Appalachia.  The darkness came about them swiftly. To Duggan it was like a return to the nightmare of sightlessness. Under their feet the racing strip faltered and stalled. They were thrown off their feet and sprawled on the fiber-ribbed squares of the checkerboarded way's surface.  \"What is it?\" demanded Rusche.  He fought back the panic. This was not true blindness.  \"Criminals. They set off a few dozen 'midnight' bombs and try to rob banks or stores. We get these attacks quite often.\"  \"Last long?\"  \"Emergency ventilation will clear it out in a couple of minutes. And the Squads will have them in half an hour. They never get very far.\"  They sat close together, to wait. From the walkways and stalled strips shrieks and frightened cries sounded. The sounds seemed to increase from behind them.  \"This's my first time above the Twentieth Level,\" Rusche confided. \"Thirty-five years and I never saw the Outside. I don't think I like it up this high.\"  \"It will be over in a little while, Ted. Probably just a group of teen-agers looking for thrills.\" He laughed drily. \"They'll end up with blanked memories and new faces like those who tried before them.\"  \"Listen,\" muttered Rusche.  In the lightlessness, and above the wailing of the terrified people about them, they could hear the scuff of running feet. They were coming closer at a swift pace. In a moment the runners would collide with them!         *       *       *       *       *  Duggan's years of blindness had given him the ability to judge and gauge distance from sound. At the proper instant he pounced, his hands clamping around a body, and a second body crashed into the leader. They went down in a tangle.  He heard Rusche shouting and fists battering and the tinkle of metal or crystal on metal. He was fighting desperately, his super mech's strength overtaxed. The unseen man's hands tore at his neck and shoulder, ripping away the synthetic flesh and baring the complex framework beneath.  Then his hand caught an arm and he exerted the full strength of his mech power, until now carefully subdued. The entire arm tore away from its shoulder. And yet the wounded man continued to attack.  It was only then that he realized this must be a super mech. The criminals must have stolen one or two super mechs and were using them in this robbery.  He was ruthless, then. He wrenched away the other arm. He battered at the unseen torso. The feet of the desperate mech smashed at his knees and thighs, staggering him. Then he bore the armless torso of the mech backward and fell upon it.  The mech went limp, its mentrols blanked by the distant criminal who controlled it.  Duggan came to his feet, listening for the sound of battle between Rusche and his captive. It came from his right, faintly. About ten feet distant, he judged it. And now the emergency vents were clearing the darkness from the travel strips. Twilight faded and vision replaced it.  Rusche was sitting astride a prone body, and even as Duggan reached his side the struggling criminal's arms and legs went limp. Rusche grunted and started to stand.  \"A super mech!\" he said. He rubbed thoughtfully at his disarranged nose and cheeks, smoothing them again into their normal contours. \"What about yours?\"  \"The same.\"  \"Here's their loot, anyhow,\" Rusche said, holding up a small gray plastine bag.  \"Drop it, Ted. We better fade out of here before the Squads arrive, too. They might think we're--\"  \"Not on your life, Al. We should get a reward. Pics on the newswires and tapes.\"  Duggan shrugged and smoothed at his own neck and face. Four red-uniformed men, their heads hidden by ovoid gas helmets, came hissing toward them along the travel strip. They rode single-wheeled cycles and their rapid-fire expoders were trained on them.  \"Careful now, Ted. Let me do the talking. They like to use paralysis needles and question later.\"  \"But--\"  \"I've lived up here.\"  The unicycles braked to a halt.  \"Step over here, slow,\" ordered one of the Squadmen.  Duggan obeyed, careful to keep his arms rigid. Of course paralysis needles would cause this mech body no damage, but why make trouble? They _had_ more destructive weapons.  \"Ran into us,\" he said mildly. \"We figured something wrong--honest men would be standing where they were. We stopped them.\"  The four members of the Squad were inspecting the damage.  \"I guess you did,\" one of them said, admiringly. \"You must be super mechs too?\"  \"That's right. I'm Duggan, Al--Merle Duggan, and this is my friend, Ted Rusche. We work on the 80th Level--rockhounds.\"  \"Duggan?\" The man's voice was suddenly strained. \"Maybe you're not so clear as you pretend. A woman got in the way by accident, supposedly, of their getaway from the bank. Her name was Duggan too.\"  Duggan started forward, remembered the ugly expoder muzzles and backed away.  \"Was her name Janith?\" he demanded.  \"Radio report didn't say. Contact them, Joe,\" he told one of the other faceless men.  \"Couldn't be you hired these two to kill her and pretend the robbery?\" he inquired.  \"Of course not.\"  One of the Squad mumbled something. Duggan's interrogator dropped his weapon's muzzle.  \"Woman twisted her ankle trying to get out of the way, and fell. Received a cut on her temple and is being taken to the hospital. Accidental all right.\"  \"But her name.\"  \"Janith.\"  Duggan felt a strange mingling of anger and of tenderness. The anger was directed toward the criminals.  \"Could I go to her now? Rusche can fill you in on details.\"  \"It's not--oh, all right. Regulations aren't too strict on these levels. She your sister?\"  \"Wife.\" He turned to Rusche.  \"See you at the lift in about an hour,\" he said and headed for the advertising agency where Janith was employed.         *       *       *       *       *  \"We haven't been informed as to her whereabouts yet, Mr. Duggan,\" the receptionist at Duffey's offices said coldly.  Duggan glared down into the carefully pretty face, the solar-lamp tan and the knife-smoothed wrinkles.  \"Now see here, Blanche,\" he said, and spluttered impotently.  \"See here yourself, Merle Duggan,\" the woman spat back sharply. \"After all! You come running back just because she's hurt. Why didn't you come back like this a year ago?\"  \"I was with her a year ago.\"  \"That wasn't you. You didn't have guts enough to rent a super mech and go back to your old job.\" The woman laughed. \"Janith tried to insult and needle you into being a man again. And you just crawled.\"  \"That's a lie,\" Duggan cried. \"I begged her to let me go back. She wouldn't listen.\"  \"That's what you say now. You don't want to remember. I know. I was here all the time. Many a time Janith has come to the office, crying, and told me how hopeless it seemed.\"  \"You're--you're inventing all this, Blanche,\" he accused.  \"I wish I were. Remember, Merle. Think. Be honest with yourself.\" Blanche put her nervous, blue-veined hand on his arm. A detached part of his brain noted how bony and brittle her hand was.  \"She's loved you all these years, Merle.\" The tiny hand dug into his jacket sleeve. \"To make you well again she risked losing your love--and she lost.\"  Blanche must be all of fifty, perhaps fifty-five, the analytical portion of his mind noted. Old-maidish in many ways, despite her five ex-husbands; yet so sentimental--  \"It's all part of her scheme. Pretend to be the patient, long-suffering wife and then secretly forbid me to go back to the deep levels again! You don't know!\"  The woman's tired eyes sparkled green. Her little fist cracked against his chest. She turned half away from him.  \"But I do know. I sat up with you many nights, while Janith got a few hours of rest. You were like a baby, slobbering and whimpering in your sleep. The days were worse. You were drunk and shouting and weeping. To you blindness was the end.\"  Merle gulped. He could remember nothing of the sort. Only the accident and awakening in the hospital to darkness.... But there was a strange blankness, a hiatus in his memories, that ended with his hated job in the cigar stand. He could not recall his first day there or--  Could Blanche be telling the truth?  \"You--spiteful old hag!\" he shouted at her, and rushed out of the offices.  His feet pounded at the yielding"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/29832"],["title","Second Sight (#2)"],["body","of the walkway. The hospital was less than two blocks distant--no need to take a travel strip--and he needed the automatic motion of walking to steady his thoughts.  The forgotten months. Four months, or was it five months, ago, he was in the cigar-and-news stand. That was the day when an old acquaintance from the lower levels sold him the chance on the 80th Level's breakthrough.  That night he had begged Janith to let him rent a super mech. And she had scoffed at his wastefulness. Yet, now that he remembered it again, there had been a wistful note of hope in her voice.  Could she have been trying to fan his faint desire for sight into something more powerful and consuming--so he would become again the engineering Duggan he had been?  He had surrendered then, as he did many times afterward. Sullenly, yes, but he had surrendered. Perhaps she knew he was not ready for sight. When he refused to obey her, when he insisted on hiring a super mech--then, perhaps, she would know the cure was complete.  But that was only theory. He remembered her clearly expressed hatred for the mucking, lower-level life of a rockhound. Always his hatred for her grew as she spoke of his work....  She had never expressed herself in that way before the accident. She had gone with him on many exploratory trips into the caverns that the lower levels of Appalachia cut across. And she had enjoyed the experience--he was sure of that.  Remember! Think back. Back before the cigars and papers. Back to the days and months after the accident. It hurt to think. His temples, here on the mentrol-hooded sleeping plate, were pounding irregularly....  Huddling in a bed, knees drawn up and head tucked in, trying to gain somehow the safety that an infant once knew. Janith's voice, soft and understanding, and the acid of panic that set his lips to mumbling meaningless jargon....  Why had Janith not sent him to the medical centers for mental clearing and re-education as was done with all cases of psychoed abnormals? The answer was with him. She loved him as he was, Merle Duggan--not as a new personality in her husband's body.  Artificial amnesia automatically dissolves all marriage partnerships. She had not wanted that. Instead she had three years of hell....  Striking out at emptiness, his fists contacting soft flesh, and the pained cry, swiftly suppressed, of Janith. His voice, cursing and high-pitched, as he fought the straps that now were restraining his sightless body. The bite of a needle and gradual dissolution of feeling....  Memory was coming reluctantly back to Duggan. This was not the self-imagined visionings of an abused helpless man. These memories were true. He had fought against all mental therapy and turned from those who loved him.  Now the hospital entrance was before him. He paused for a moment and then went inside. The automatic hush of the door shutting out the muted street sounds was all too familiar.  \"Mrs. Janith Duggan,\" he told the crisply white woman at the desk.  \"Room 212, second floor.\"  \"Thank you.\"         *       *       *       *       *  He used the steps in preference to the lift. He needed more time to think--would he ever find enough time?  Undoubtedly, now, Janith's love for him was dead. His desertion of her must have finished the dissolution of their marriage. It had been cowardly--he should have faced her and declared what he was going to do and what she could do.  These past weeks, working with the rock hogs, had been invaluable. They had restored something of his self-esteem.  The second floor. Pastel bare walls and soft voices. The odors. 208 and opposite, 209. A wheelchair, propelled by a timidly smiling white-haired woman. He nodded automatically.  210. What could he say to her? That he was sorry she was hurt and that he was such a fool? And then back to the super mech hostel and the five other cripples who shared the room?  212. The door ajar. A private room. He was glad of that. The headache was more violent now--there was a bitter taste in his mouth as his super mech entered the room.  She was alone, looking tiny and helpless on the high bed. To him, after three years, she was more beautiful than he remembered, even though the pure whiteness of her once-graying hair startled him.  \"Janith,\" he said uncertainly.  She turned her head, curiosity in her expression, and then understanding came. There was no mistaking the warmth and welcome that came into her eyes. She held out her arms.  \"Duggy,\" she commanded, \"come here.\"  And he knew then, without ever being told, that his revolt and flight had all been part of the therapy, and Janith had known all the time where he had been....
