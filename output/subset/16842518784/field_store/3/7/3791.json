Penn, now in the prime of life, must surely have been aroused by this scene and by the reflection that the noble river was his and the vast stretches of forests and mountains for three hundred miles to the westward.  He was soon ashore, exploring the edge of his mighty domain, settling his government, and passing his laws. He was much pleased with the Swedes whom he found on his land. He changed the name of the little Swedish village of Upland, fifteen miles below Philadelphia, to Chester. He superintended laying out the streets of Philadelphia and they remain to this day substantially as he planned them, though unfortunately too narrow and monotonously regular. He met the Indians at Philadelphia, sat with them at their fires, ate their roasted corn, and when to amuse him they showed him some of their sports and games he renewed his college days by joining them in a jumping match.  Then he started on journeys. He traveled through the woods to New York, which then belonged to the Duke of York, who had given him Delaware; he visited the Long Island Quakers; and on his return he went to Maryland to meet with much pomp and ceremony Lord Baltimore and there discuss with him the disputed boundary. He even crossed to the eastern shore of the Chesapeake to visit a Quaker meeting on the Choptank before winter set in, and he describes the immense migration of wild pigeons at that season, and the ducks which flew so low and were so tame that the colonists knocked them down with sticks.  Most of the winter he spent at Chester and wrote to England in high spirits of his journeys, the wonders of the country, the abundance of game and provisions, and the twenty-three ships which had arrived so swiftly that few had taken longer than six weeks, and only three had been infected with the smallpox. \"Oh how sweet,\" he says, \"is the quiet of these parts, freed from the anxious and troublesome solicitations, hurries and perplexities of woful Europe.\"  As the weeks and months passed, ships kept arriving with more Quakers, far exceeding the migration to the Jerseys. By summer, Penn reported that 50 sail had arrived within the past year, 80 houses had been built in Philadelphia, and about 300 farms had been laid out round the town. It is supposed that about 8000 immigrants had arrived. This was a more rapid development than was usual in the colonies of America. Massachusetts and Virginia had been established slowly and with much privation and suffering. But the settlement of Philadelphia was like a summer outing. There were no dangers, the hardships were trifling, and there was no sickness or famine. There was such an abundance of game close at hand that hunger and famine were in nowise to be feared. The climate was good and the Indians, kindly treated, remained friendly for seventy years.  It is interesting to note that in that same year, 1682, in which Penn and his friends with such ease and comfort founded their great colony on the Delaware, the French explorers and voyageurs from Canada, after years of incredible hardships, had traversed the northern region of the Great Lakes with their canoes and had passed down the Mississippi to its mouth, giving to the whole of the Great West the name of Louisiana, and claiming it for France. Already La Salle had taken his fleet of canoes down the Mississippi River and had placed the arms of France on a post at its mouth in April, 1682, only a few months before Penn reached his newly acquired colony. Thus in the same year in which the Quakers established in Pennsylvania their reign of liberty and of peace with the red men, La Salle was laying the foundation of the western empire of despotic France, which seventy years afterwards was to hurl the savages upon the English colonies, to wreck the Quaker policy of peace, but to fail in the end to maintain itself against the free colonies of England.  While they were building houses in Philadelphia, the settlers lived in bark huts or in caves dug in the river bank, as the early settlers in New Jersey across the river had lived. Pastorius, a learned German Quaker, who had come out with the English, placed over the door of his cave the motto, \"Parva domus, sed amica bonis, procul este profani,\" which much amused Penn when he saw it. A certain Mrs. Morris was much exercised one day as to how she could provide supper in the cave for her husband who was working on the construction of their house. But on returning to her cave she found that her cat had just brought in a fine rabbit. In their later prosperous years they had a picture of the cat and the rabbit made on a box which has descended as a family heirloom. Doubtless there were preserved many other interesting reminiscences of the brief camp life. These Quakers were all of the thrifty, industrious type which had gone to West Jersey a few years before. Men of means, indeed, among the Quakers were the first to seek refuge from the fines and confiscations imposed upon them in England. They brought with them excellent supplies of everything. Many of the ships carried the frames of houses ready to put together. But substantial people of this sort demanded for the most part houses of brick, with stone cellars. Fortunately both brick clay and stone were readily obtainable in the neighborhood, and whatever may have been the case in other colonies, ships loaded with brick from England would have found it little to their profit to touch at Philadelphia. An early description says that the brick houses in Philadelphia were modeled on those of London, and this type prevailed for nearly two hundred years.  It was probably in June, 1683, that Penn made his famous treaty with the Indians. No documentary proof of the existence of such a treaty has reached us. He made, indeed, a number of so-called treaties, which were really only purchases of land involving oral promises between the principals to treat each other fairly. Hundreds of such treaties have been made. The remarkable part about Penn's dealings with the Indians was that such promises as he made he kept. The other Quakers, too, were as careful as Penn in their honorable treatment of the red men. Quaker families of farmers and settlers lived unarmed among them for generations and, when absent from home, left children in their care. The Indians, on their part, were known to have helped white families with food in winter time. Penn, on his first visit to the colony, made a long journey unarmed among the Indians as far as the Susquehanna, saw the great herds of elk on that river, lived in Indian wigwams, and learned much of the language and customs of the natives. There need never be any trouble with them, he said. They were the easiest people in the world to get on with if the white men would simply be just. Penn's fair treatment of the Indians kept Pennsylvania at peace with them for about seventy years--in fact, from 1682 until the outbreak of the French and Indian Wars, in 1755. In its critical period of growth, Pennsylvania was therefore not at all harassed or checked by those Indian hostilities which were such a serious impediment in other colonies.  The two years of Penn's first visit were probably the happiest of his life. Always fond of the country, he built himself a fine seat on the Delaware near Bristol, and it would have been better for him, and probably also for the colony, if he had remained there. But he thought he had duties in England: his family needed him; he must defend his people from the religious oppression still prevailing; and Lord Baltimore had gone to England to resist him in the boundary dispute. One of the more narrow-minded of his faith wrote to Penn from England that he was enjoying himself too much in his colony and seeking his own selfish interest. Influenced by all these considerations, he returned in August, 1684, and it was long before he saw Pennsylvania again--not, indeed, until October, 1699, and then for only two years.    Chapter III. Life In Philadelphia  The rapid increase of population and the growing prosperity in Pennsylvania during the life of its founder present a striking contrast to the slower and more troubled growth of the other British colonies in America. The settlers in Pennsylvania engaged at once in profitable agriculture. The loam, clay, and limestone soils on the Pennsylvania tide of the Delaware produced heavy crops of grain, as well as pasture for cattle and valuable lumber from its forests. The Pennsylvania settlers were of a class particularly skilled in dealing with the soil. They apparently encountered none of the difficulties, due probably to incompetent farming, which beset the settlers of Delaware, whose land was as good as that of the Pennsylvania colonists.  In a few years the port of Philadelphia was loading abundant cargoes for England and the great West India trade. After much experimenting with different places on the river, such as New Castle, Wilmington, Salem, Burlington, the Quakers had at last found the right location for a great seat of commerce and trade that could serve as a center for the export of everything from the region behind it and around it. Philadelphia thus soon became the basis of a prosperity which no other townsite on the Delaware had been able to attain. The Quakers of Philadelphia were the soundest of financiers and men of business, and in their skillful hands the natural resources of their colony were developed without setback or accident. At an early date banking institutions were established in Philadelphia, and the strongest colonial merchants and mercantile firms had their offices there. It was out of such a sound business life that were produced in Revolutionary times such characters as Robert Morris and after the Revolution men like Stephen Girard.  Pennsylvania in colonial times was ruled from Philadelphia somewhat as France has always been ruled from Paris. And yet there was a difference: Pennsylvania had free government. The Germans and"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30434"],["title","Occasion for Disaster (#1)"],["body","said, \"the only actual trouble we can pinpoint is that there seem to be a great many errors occurring in the paperwork--more than usual.\"  \"People get tired,\" Malone said tentatively.  \"But computer-secretary calculating machines don't,\" Burris said. \"And that's where the errors are--in the computer-secretaries down in the Senate Office Building. I think you'd better start out there.\"  \"Sure,\" Malone said sadly.  \"See if there's any mechanical or electrical defect in any of those computers,\" Burris said. \"Talk to the computer technicians. Find out what's causing all these errors.\"  \"Yes, sir,\" Malone said. He was still trying to feel resigned, but he wasn't succeeding very well.  \"And if you don't find anything--\" Burris began.  \"I'll come right back,\" Malone said instantly.  \"No,\" Burris said. \"You keep on looking.\"  \"I do?\"  \"You do,\" Burris said. \"After all, there has to be _something_ wrong.\"  \"Sure,\" Malone said, \"if you say so. But--\"  \"There are the interview tapes,\" Burris said, \"and the reports the congressmen brought in. You can go through those.\"  Malone sighed. \"I guess so,\" he said.  \"And there must be thousands of other things to do,\" Burris said.  \"Well--\" Malone began cautiously.  \"You'll be able to think of them,\" Burris said heartily. \"I know you will. I have confidence in you, Malone. Confidence.\"  \"Thanks,\" Malone said sadly.  \"You just keep me posted from time to time on what you're doing, and what ideas you get,\" Burris said. \"I'm leaving the whole thing in your hands, Malone, and I'm sure you won't disappoint me.\"  \"I'll try,\" Malone said.  \"I know you will,\" Burris said warmly. \"And no matter how long it takes--I know you'll succeed.\"  \"No matter how long it takes?\" Malone said hesitantly.  \"That's right!\" Burris said. \"You can do it, Malone! You can do it.\"  Malone nodded slowly. \"I hope so,\" he said. \"Well, I ... well, I'll start out right away, then.\"  He turned. Before he could make another move Burris said: \"Wait!\"  Malone turned again, hope in his eyes. \"Yes, sir?\" he said.  \"When you leave--\" Burris began, and the hope disappeared \"please do one little favor for me. Just one little favor, because I'm an old, tired man and I'm not used to things any more.\"  \"Sure,\" Malone said. \"Anything, Chief.\"  \"Don't call me--\"  \"Sorry,\" Malone said.  Burris breathed heavily. \"When you leave,\" he said, \"please, please use the door.\"  \"But--\"  \"Malone,\" Burris said, \"I've tried. I've really tried. Believe me. I've tried to get used to the fact that you can teleport. But--\"  \"It's useful,\" Malone said, \"in my work.\"  \"I can see that,\" Burris said. \"And I don't want you to ... well, to stop doing it. By no means. It's just that it sort of unnerves me, if you see what I mean. No matter how useful it is for the FBI to have an agent who can go instantaneously from one place to another, it unnerves me.\" He sighed. \"I can't get used to seeing you disappear like an over-dried soap bubble, Malone. It does something to me--here.\" He placed a hand directly over his sternum and sighed again.  \"I can understand that,\" Malone said. \"It unnerved me, too, the first time I saw it. I thought I was going crazy, when that kid--Mike Fueyo--winked out like a light. But then we got him, and some FBI agents besides me have learned the trick.\" He stopped there, wondering if he'd been tactful. After all, it took a latent ability to learn teleportation, and some people had it, while others didn't. Malone, along with a few other agents, did. Burris evidently didn't--so he couldn't teleport, no matter how hard he tried or how many lessons he took.  \"Well,\" Burris said, \"I'm still unnerved. So ... please, Malone ... when you come in here, or go out, use the door. All right?\"  \"Yes, sir,\" Malone said. He turned and went out. As he opened the door, he could almost hear Burris' sigh of relief. Then he banged it shut behind him and, feeling that he might as well continue with his spacebound existence, walked all the way to the elevator, and rode it downstairs to the FBI laboratories.  The labs, highly efficient and divided into dozens of departments, covered several floors. Malone passed through the Fingerprint section, filled with technicians doing strange things to great charts and slides, and frowning over tiny pieces of material and photographs. Then came Forgery Detection, involving many more technicians, many more slides and charts and tiny pieces of things and photographs, and even a witness or two sitting on the white bench at one side and looking lost and somehow civilian. Identification Classified was next, a great barn of a room filled with index files. The real indexes were in the sub-basement; here, on microfilm, were only the basic division. A man was standing in front of one of the files, frowning at it. Malone went on by without stopping.  Cosmetic Surgery Classification came next. Here there were more indexes, and there were also charts and slides. There was an FBI agent sitting on a bench looking bored while two female technicians--classified as O&U for Old and Ugly in Malone's mind--fluttered around him, deciding what disguises were possible, and which of those was indicated for the particular job on hand. Malone waved to the agent, whom he knew very slightly, and went on. He felt vaguely regretful that the FBI couldn't hire prettier girls for the Cosmetic Surgery Division, but the trouble was that pretty girls fell for the agents--and vice versa--and this led to an unfortunate tendency toward only handsome and virile-looking disguises. The O&U Division was unfortunate, he decided, but a necessity.  Chemical Analysis (III) was next. The Chemical Analysis section was scattered over several floors, with the first stages up above. Division III, Malone remembered, was devoted to non-poisonous substances--like clay or sand found in boots or trouser cuffs, cigar ashes and such. They were placed on the same floor as Fingerprints to allow free and frequent passage between the sections on the problems of plastic prints--made in putty or like substances--and visible prints, made when the hand is covered with a visible substance like blood, ketchup or glue.  Malone found what he was looking for at the very end of the floor. It was the Computer Section, a large room filled with humming, clacking and buzzing machines of an ancient vintage, muttering to themselves as they worked, and newer machines which were smaller and more silent. Lights were lighting and bells were ringing softly, relays were relaying and the whole room was a gigantic maze of calculating and control machines. What space wasn't filled by the machines themselves was filled by workbenches, all littered with an assortment of gears, tubes, spare relays, transistors, wires, rods, bolts, resistors and all the other paraphernalia used in building the machines and repairing them. Beyond the basic room were other, smaller rooms, each assigned to a particular kind of computer work.  The narrow aisles were choked here and there with men who looked up as Malone passed by, but most of them gave him one quick glance and went back to work. A few didn't even do that, but went right on concentrating on their jobs. Malone headed for a man working all alone in front of a workbench, frowning down at a complicated-looking mechanism that seemed to have neither head nor tail, and prodding at it with a long, thin screwdriver. The man was thin, too, but not very long; he was a little under average height, and he had straight black hair, thick-lensed glasses and a studious expression, even when he was frowning. He looked as if the mechanism were a student who had cut too many classes, and he was being kindly but firm with it.         *       *       *       *       *  Malone managed to get to the man's side, and coughed discreetly. There was no response.  \"Fred?\" he said.  The screwdriver waggled a little. Malone wasn't quite sure that the man was breathing.  \"Fred Mitchell,\" he said.  Mitchell didn't look up. Another second passed.  \"Hey,\" Malone said. Then he closed his eyes and took a deep breath. \"Fred,\" he said in a loud, reasonable-sounding voice, \"the State Department's translator has started to talk pig-Latin.\"  Mitchell straightened up as if somebody had jabbed him with a pin. The screwdriver waved wildly in the air for a second, and then pointed at Malone. \"That's impossible,\" Mitchell said in a flat, precise voice. \"Simply impossible. It doesn't have a pig-Latin circuit. It can't possibly--\" He blinked and seemed to see Malone for the first time. \"Oh,\" he said. \"Hello, Malone. What can I do for you?\"  Malone smiled, feeling a little victorious at having got through the Mitchell armor, which was almost impregnable when there was a job in hand. \"I've been standing here talking to you for some time.\"  \"Oh, have you?\" Mitchell said. \"I was busy.\" That, obviously, explained that. Malone shrugged.  \"I want you to help me check over some calculators, Fred,\" he said. \"We've had some reports that some of the government machines are out of kilter, and I'd like you to go over them for me.\"  \"Out of kilter?\" Fred Mitchell said. \"No, you can forget about it. It's absolutely unnecessary to make a check--believe me. Absolutely. Forget it.\" He smiled suddenly. \"I suppose it's some kind of a joke, isn't it?\" he said, just a trifle uncertainly. Fred Mitchell's world, while pleasant, did not include much humor, Malone knew. \"It's supposed to be funny,\" he said in the same flat, precise voice.  \"It isn't funny,\" Malone said.  Fred sighed. \"Then they're obviously lying,\" he said, \"and that's all there is to it. Why bother me with it?\"  \"Certainly,\" Fred said. He looked at the machinery with longing.  Malone took a breath. \"How do you know?\" he said.  Fred sighed. \"It's perfectly obvious,\" he said in a patient tone. \"Since the State Department translator has no pig-Latin circuit, it can't possibly be talking pig-Latin. I will admit that such a circuit would be relatively easy to"]]]
