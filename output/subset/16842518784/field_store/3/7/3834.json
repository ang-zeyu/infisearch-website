Perhaps in other days that crowd might have so behaved itself, and might have vanished long before the constables and their captives had reached the station; but crowds in the city of Berlin of other days, and the mob as it was in the latter part of July and the early days of August of 1914, were essentially and unmistakably different.  War had been declared by the Fatherland, that war expected by the nation, eagerly awaited by all Teutons, longed for, oh how much and how eagerly, by all the subjects of the Kaiser!  And now that it had come, now that the Emperor had thrown down the gauntlet before France and Russia, you would have imagined that the people of Berlin would have been overjoyed, would have been delighted, too happy and too contented to be angry.  And yet, it so happened that there was disappointment, anger, rage, in the hearts of almost all these Germans.  True, they had obtained, after all those years of training, a declaration for which they had so eagerly waited.  France was in their power, conquered already, they told themselves, for was she not utterly unprepared for war?  And as for Russia, Russia the Colossus, the steam-roller, inefficiency reigned in her ranks, and she, too, in her turn, would be most unquestionably conquered.  Then what, what had occurred to make this Berlin crowd--the swarm of people who hurried along the streets elsewhere, the mobs which gathered in front of embassies--so violent, so intensely hostile to France, so suspicious of the presence of spies, so furiously disappointed and angry?  \"Spies!  British spies!\" a young man in the ranks of that crowd bellowed, catching a full view of Jules and Henri; \"spies from the King of England!  Kill them!\"  And the mob took up the shout: \"British!  Down with Britain!\"  Was that then the explanation of the hatred, of the intense animosity, shown by these people?  Was that then the reason why these two Berlin constables, for one of them at least knew Jules and Henri to be French--why they too should grit their teeth, should scowl and mutter at the name of Britain?  Yes, indeed, that was the reason why all the subjects of the Kaiser, deliriously happy but a few hours ago, were now snarling with anger, less contented with what was occurring, furiously indignant at something beyond their conception.  For within half an hour of Henri's successful purchase of tickets, which were to take himself and his chum to safety in England, there had come news of importance from London.  Already German troops had invaded Belgium, had fired upon the people, were engaged with King Albert's soldiers, and Britain--that arrogant Britain, ever an eyesore and a thorn in the flesh for Germans--had protested, had declared her detestation of that Germanic act, and her decision to oppose it.  Indeed, she had answered the deeds of the Kaiser and his soldiers by declaring war, by announcing her determination to fight the Germans, and her decision to support France and Belgium and Russia to her utmost.  That, then, was the reason why that mob, gathering weight at every moment, howled with rage when, seeing Jules and Henri so distinctly British in appearance, they recalled to their minds the engrossing fact that all Britons were now their enemies.  \"Hang them to the nearest lamp-post!  Strangle the spies!\" they bellowed; \"why take them to the police station?\"  In his excessive zeal to deal a blow for his country, with an extremity of valour which he would hardly have displayed had Jules and Henri been free to defend themselves, one youth, possessed of coal-black, flashing eyes, of raven locks, and of pallid and bloated features, darted in between the two constables and struck a blow at Jules which, if it had taken effect, would most decidedly have damaged his personal appearance.  \"Himmel!  But not that!\" shouted the stoutest of the constables. \"What!  You would strike and damage a prisoner of ours who may be valuable to the authorities!  You would!\"  In a moment he had gripped the scabbard of his sword, and, swinging it round, dealt this malefactor a blow across the head which stretched him on the pavement.  Then, jostling their prisoners between them, hurrying them on, and smiling triumphantly at the crowd still massed around them, encouraging them almost to repeat the attempt of that young fellow so drastically punished, and so to torture their prisoners, and yet keeping the most valiant of these angry individuals at arm's length, the two men of law dragged Jules and Henri swiftly onwards.  And at last the doors of the police station closed behind them, leaving outside a great mass of men and women, of gutter-snipes, and of every sort and class of individual--a mob which howled like hungry wolves as the prisoners were lost to sight to them.  Inside that station Jules and Henri at once underwent a most thorough and rigorous search.  \"Ha!  Tickets for England!  Then you were bound for that country?  And letters from France, from Paris--suspicious!\"  It was useless to point out to these police officials that it was natural enough for two Frenchmen caught in Berlin at a time of declaration of war between Germany and their own people to attempt to reach some other place; and hopeless to draw their attention to the fact that, being French, letters from France in their possession were to be expected, while the contents alone could prove whether Jules and Henri were of necessity suspects.  We need hardly follow the course of events after the capture of these two unfortunate, if lively, young fellows.  They were clapped into prison as a natural course, into a dark, noisome cell, which would have been but indifferent accommodation for some malefactor.  They were half-starved, bullied, browbeaten, and even beaten by their jailers, they were threatened with death as spies--though there was not an atom of evidence against them--and, finally, after many months of anguish, of short commons, of brutal treatment, they found themselves interned in Ruhleben race-course, to which so many unfortunate civilians were sent, there to mope and fret and rot while the war was in progress.  \"And here we'll stay, I suppose,\" grumbled Henri, when some weeks had passed, and they had, as it were, settled down to the routine of camp life in Ruhleben, and had become inured--as far as young men of active dispositions and healthy appetites can become inured, to the scantily short rations with which the Germans supplied them.  \"It's awfully hard luck to be prisoners in a place like this when our people are fighting.\"  \"Awfully hard,\" Jules echoed despondently, for he was not gifted with quite the allowance of high spirits possessed of Henri.  \"But it needn't necessarily last for ever, this imprisonment,\" his friend told him; and perhaps he had said the same a hundred times already.  \"Little news comes to us in this hole, but yet tales have reached us of men who have escaped, who have got out of Germany and have joined their French regiments.\"  Yes, there had been news of such escapes, and no doubt there would be others; and perhaps even Henri and Jules might themselves contrive to get out of their predicament.  Yet, how?  Look round the camp and see those rolls of barbed wire which encircled them, see the armed sentries who moved along their beats, and the jailers and men appointed to watch and spy amongst the prisoners, who strode here and there, hectoring the weak, browbeating the strong, and fawning, perhaps, upon those fortunate enough to be possessed of a store of money.  Bitterly did the two young fellows regret the chances which had brought them to Berlin, and had found them there at the outbreak of war; for, indeed, it was but a chance which had taken them to the Kaiser's city.  Let us explain how it happened that these two young men were of such distinctly British appearance.  After all, there was nothing extraordinary about that fact, nothing particularly unusual, for in Paris, for years past, there has been a sufficiency of British tailors to turn out every young man after the latest British fashion.  But it was more than clothes in the case of these two young men, more than mere dress, that made them so conspicuously British; it was environment, in fact, training and education; it was the result of the intuition of their parents.  \"France is all right, my boy,\" Monsieur de Farquissaire had told Henri when he was quite a lad, \"France is a splendid country, and, if you are but like your fellows when you reach man's age, neither you nor I will have anything to complain of.  But there is good in other nationalities, and there is great advantage to one among our people who both speaks the language, say, of England, and, better even than that, understands her people and has inside knowledge of them.  So you will go to an English university once you have left your school in Paris.\"  As a matter of strict fact, Henri had left his school in Paris when only fifteen years of age, and had crossed the Channel to become one of the inmates of a public school famous throughout Great Britain.  It was there that he had learned to speak like a native, and, better still, it was there that he had learned, unconsciously, quite easily in fact, to behave just as did his fellows, to speak as they did, quietly, without undue or exaggerated action, to play their games, to understand and practise their codes of honour; and so faithful and diligent a student was he, so heartily did he enter into the work and games of that public school, that, when in due course he went to a university, he was mistaken, just as he had been at the moment of the opening of this story, for a British subject, an essentially insular individual.  As "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30791"],["title","With Joffre at Verdun: A Story of the Western Front (#2)"],["body","Jules, when one has described the appearance and the life-history, though only a short one so far, of the energetic Henri, one has practically described that of his companion.  For Jules and Henri were born next-door to one another, were chums from their earliest boyhood, and, thanks to the intimate friendship of their parents, had the same course marked out for them.  Jules, then, followed Henri to that public school in England, followed him to the university, was like him in his fancy for British ways and British customs, and followed him yet again, indeed went in his company, on that journey to Berlin which immersed them in this misfortune.  And there they were, interned in Ruhleben, impounded, corralled if you like, separated from their countrymen by ghastly fences of barbed wire, and by a nation composed of men and women who, almost without exception, would, if they were to discover them outside their prison, most eagerly tear them to pieces.  \"But it's got to be done!\" Jules said, as he and Henri sat outside the stable, the wooden hovel, indeed, in which they lived, in which they bedded down at night in stalls once occupied by horses, and now merely strewed with straw, cruelly cold and unfit for human habitation.  \"And the sooner we set about it the better.  We'll have to harden our hearts,\" said Henri, looking very determined and attempting to twist the ends of his miniature moustache; \"we'll have to save our food for the journey.\"  Jules shivered.  He wasn't a greedy young man, nor could his appetite be described as unusually large, but he was hungry.  Hungry then, at the moment when Henri spoke of saving rations, hungry at night, hungry when he had had his food, hungry always.  He was like every member of the unfortunate crowd now inhabiting the race-course at Ruhleben, he was short of food--for the Germans were the harshest of captors.  And how could a man save sufficient from a mere crust of bread?  How could he put away from rations, already and for so long insufficient, even a crumb _per diem_ to carry him on during some coming journey?  \"Yes, it's got to be done,\" said Henri, with determination; \"and, what's more, we shall have to save money.  We are getting a little already: I had a few marks sent through from Paris only last week, while we have both got a few notes tucked away in our clothing.  But it's not money, however, which will help us; not even food.  It will be our wits, which will have to be brisk, I can tell you.\"  Looking about them as they sat near their hovel, both knew that the words were abundantly true, for where was there a loophole in those barbed-wire fences?  Where was there an opportunity to break out of this prison?  Yet the chance came, came unexpectedly, came after some weeks of waiting and despondency, came at a moment, in fact, when it found Jules and Henri almost unready, unprepared to seize a golden opportunity.     CHAPTER II  Henri and Jules and Stuart  There was a hue and cry in the camp of Ruhleben which caused heads to be thrust out of doors and out of windows, made prisoners who had been languishing in the place for months start to their feet and look enquiringly about them, and set a German official turning round and round like a teetotum--his moustaches bristling, his hair on end, amazed at the din and fearful for the cause of it.  It all commenced with a sudden shout, and then was emphasized by the explosion of a rifle.  A dull thud followed as a bullet struck one of the huts and perforated it, and then a dozen weapons went off, the somewhat aged guardians of the camp losing their heads and blazing away without aim and without authority.  \"What's up?  What's happened?  Why is there firing?\"  \"Shooting a prisoner, eh?  Brutes--they'd do anything!  Mon Dieu!  What will happen next?\"  The first speaker was a delicate, pale-faced, spectacled Breton; the second, a vivacious individual from Paris, who, like Henri and Jules, had had the misfortune to be in Germany when the war broke out.  Their eager questions were followed by the somewhat phlegmatic and casual words of an Englishman--a red-headed, red-cheeked, healthy-looking individual, who, in spite of short commons, still looked bulky.  \"Someone's lost his head,\" he said caustically, with a growl, sitting up and looking about him.  \"I'll get the reason in two guesses: someone's trying to escape, or someone has escaped.\"  Something very dreadful might really have happened, judging by the commotion in the camp, by the shouts of the sentries, and by the firing.  The Governor himself--living aloof from the individuals interned in the place and under his administration--heard the racket and came out, buttoning up his tunic, alarmed, his thoughts in a whirl, eager to discover what had given rise to the commotion; and Henri and Jules, like the rest of their companions, were, as one may imagine, just as curious and just as eager.  \"Whatever the ruction is, whatever the cause, the point where it commenced is over there, behind those huts in the far corner,\" said the former, watching the German guards race across the place and listening to their shouts and to the loud commands of the non-commissioned officers amongst them.  \"Let's saunter in that direction.  Come along.\"  And saunter they did, being joined in a little while by a number of people interned in the camp; and amongst them by the red-headed, red-cheeked, and healthy-looking individual who boasted, somewhat loudly it is to be feared at times, of his English nationality.  Not that such boastings disgusted the unhappy people interned at Ruhleben, for it did them good in those days of depression to hear a man--a robust man such as this individual--proud of his birth, and still possessed of sufficient spirit to glory in it, to draw comparisons between himself, his French, his Belgian, and his Japanese fellow-prisoners, and Germans in general, The man's swagger, in fact, delighted them, and helped to bolster up the fading spirits of many an unfortunate captive in the camp--of many a man, who, but for the jibes and uncomplimentary remarks of this robust prisoner, would long since have given up hope and have subsided into melancholy.  \"What a row!\" he scoffed, as side by side with Jules and Henri he sauntered across the compound.  \"No, don't you hurry, you fellows, for there's never any knowing what will happen in these days.  Those German guards have lost their heads, and the chances are that, if in your curiosity you happen to step along too quickly or to run, they'd imagine that a mutiny had broken out, and would blaze away at you. Lor' what a commotion!\"  By now some twenty of the German guards--those Landsturm men of perhaps fifty years of age--had collected in the opposite corner, at the point where the alarm had first been given, and could be seen, grouped together, gesticulating, shouting at one another, peering into the corner of the compound, and carrying on in a manner which accentuated, if anything, the curiosity of the prisoners.  \"One could imagine anything,\" laughed Henri as they got nearer.  \"For instance, you could imagine that one of the fellows interned here, goaded to rashness by these bullies who look after us, had struck one of them.\"  \"Yes, that's not at all unlikely.  Goaded to madness, one of the poor chaps may have put his fist into the face of a German guard, and that shot would have been the result; of course, the poor beggar would be killed instantly, for your German is nothing if not ruthless.  He's armed, you see, and is the stronger party, and knows that the authorities won't look too harshly on any drastic action.\"  \"Hold on!  Perhaps it's not a case of an assault on one of the guards,\" chimed in the healthy Englishman, Stuart by name.  \"I've said already that I'd guess the reason in two guesses--someone trying to escape, or someone already escaped--and I stick to that opinion.  Let's hope it's someone escaped--lucky beggar!  Here have I been kicking my heels about this infernal camp for months past, looking round for a chance to get out, ready to 'do in' a German guard if the opportunity came.  But, bless you, there's never been the remotest chance, for these Germans keep their eyes so precious wide open.  As for 'doing in' a guard, why, I'd do in half a dozen; for, believe me, it'd want a good half-dozen Germans to stop me, once I saw the hole open through which I could get out.\"  It wasn't altogether undiluted brag on the part of this sturdy fellow--mere boasting of what he would do under particular conditions which were never likely to arise.  A glance at him, indeed, rather helped to support his statements, for Stuart, though somewhat attenuated after those months of internment at Ruhleben, after months of short commons and indifferent accommodation, was still a big bony fellow of some twenty-five years of age, with broad shoulders, long arms and legs, and a chest which would have fitted a Hercules.  True, there were hollows in his cheeks, and his eyes were gaunt and sunken, yet what man in that camp of suffering, what man amongst all the unfortunate fellows caught in Germany at the outbreak of war and hustled to Ruhleben, did not, long since, show signs of suffering and anxiety and of want, often of destitution.  As a matter of fact, the robust Stuart had stood the privations of the place better than the majority of his fellows; and perhaps his very jauntiness of spirit, the courage which sustained him and helped also to sustain his comrades, kept him from feeling his position so acutely, and helped also to assist him in surviving a state of affairs which to some had long since become intolerable, which indeed was killing not a few by inches.  By now the trio had crossed the compound, and were within a few feet of their guards, who, absorbed in whatever had caused the alarm and had sent them rushing to that corner, seemed to overlook the prisoners--all the men about them--seemed to be unaware of the crowd collecting in that "]]]
