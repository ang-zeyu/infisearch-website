And I might have been fishing all the time.\"  \"Well,\" said his father, \"whose fault is it?\"  \"Old Spot's, I should think!\" Johnnie replied.  \"I don't see how you can blame him,\" said Farmer Green. \"Suppose you had buried a piece of strawberry shortcake here, expecting to eat it for your dinner. And suppose there wasn't another piece as good--or as big--to be had anywhere. And suppose you had come back from a tramp in the woods, hungry as--well, hungry as you were this noon. Wouldn't you want that piece of shortcake? If you could get old Spot to move the wood off it, wouldn't you be glad to have him do it?\"  \"Maybe!\" Johnnie admitted. \"Maybe! But Spot wasn't after a piece of strawberry shortcake. He was after an old bone. And he fooled me.\"  \"I should say that you fooled yourself,\" his father retorted. \"Anyhow, we're going to have strawberry shortcake for supper to-night. I heard your mother say so. And she made a special cake for you.\"  That news made Johnnie Green look a good deal less gloomy. In fact he almost smiled.  \"I _was_ going to give you that old fishing rod of mine if you'd help carry in the wood,\" Farmer Greene went on. \"And you _could_ take it now and go fishing, if you thought you could be home in time for supper.\"  \"Hurrah!\" Johnnie Green suddenly jumped up and down. \"Hurrah!\" he cried. \"And thank you very much!\"  And when, an hour later, old Spot came swimming across the creek and joined Johnnie on the further bank, and shook drops of water all over his young master, Johnnie Green only patted him and called him a \"good old fellow.\"     VII  SWIMMING   Old dog Spot liked boys. Somehow they always managed to have a lively time; and usually they seemed glad to have him join them in their sports.  He never could understand why Johnnie Green and the neighbors' boys didn't want him to play baseball with them. Spot loved to chase a ball. And sometimes when he was watching a game and somebody hit a slow grounder he would rush out and grab the ball and run with it.  Then all the boys would run after him and try to catch him. That always pleased Spot mightily. And the longer the chase lasted the happier he was. But it was different with the boys. The harder they had to run after Spot before they got the ball away from him the more out of patience they became.  Whenever Spot took part in a ball game like that Johnnie Green usually put an end to his fun, for the time being, by tying him to something or other--perhaps a fence or a tree. But even that was better--so Spot thought--than being sent home in disgrace.  Luckily there were other sports in which Spot could romp with the boys as much as he pleased, without anybody's objecting. Nutting in the woods in the fall; skating on the mill pond or coasting down the long hill past Farmer Green's house in the winter; berrying in the summer--and swimming! Those were only a few of the jolly times that Spot and the boys enjoyed together.  Perhaps, of them all, both Spot and the boys liked swimming the most. As for Spot, he didn't care _where_ he swam, so long as the water was wet. Broad Brook, Swift River, Black Creek, or the mill pond--any one of those places suited him as well as another. The boys, however, preferred the mill pond. It was deep enough, by the dam, to suit the best swimmers; and it was shallow enough at the upper end for those that were just learning.  All the boys thought it great fun when a wagon clattered over the bridge, which crossed right above the dam. Then they ducked into the water, with only their heads out, and shouted more or less politely at whoever was passing.  At such times Spot barked, because that seemed to him the gentlemanly thing to do. But he never could see any sense in jumping into the water if he happened to be out on the bank when a wagon came along.  The boys threw sticks about the pond for Spot to fetch back to them. They raced with him. They upset him when he was sunning himself on the big rock near the dam, and they laughed to see the splash he made when he struck the water.  No matter what tricks the boys played on him, Spot never lost his temper. He took everything good-naturedly. And one day, when Johnnie Green and his friends were swimming in the mill pond he even took a bundle of clothes from beneath a big hickory on the bank. Yes! Spot caught up somebody's clothes in his mouth and started along the road with them.  He was surprised to hear a terrible outcry from the water.     VIII  WHAT RED DID   Old dog Spot was trotting down the road from the mill pond, carrying a bundle of somebody's clothes in his mouth. When he heard frantic shouts from the water, where Johnnie Green and his friends were swimming, he quickened his pace.  One of the swimmers was known as \"Red.\" And it was a favorite trick of his to tie hard knots in other boys' garments while the owners of them were in the pond. Usually he wet the knots, because wetting them made them harder to untie.  On this day somebody had turned the tables on Red. Somebody had crept up behind the big old hickory tree on the bank and had knotted Red's clothes tightly. That was why old Spot found a bundle under the tree, all tied up and ready to carry off.  It was no wonder that the boys began to yell when they saw Spot pick up those clothes and calmly trot away with them. It was no wonder that they swam to the bank and scrambled up to the big hickory to find out whose clothes were missing.  When they saw that Red was the unlucky one, everybody else began to whoop and laugh.  But not Red! He let out a frightened scream and started to follow old dog Spot.  To the great delight of his companions, the rattle of a wagon and the thud of a horse's feet sounded from up the road. And since some one must soon drive over the bridge, which crossed right above the dam, Red scurried back again and dived into the pond, into which Johnnie Green and the others had already plunged.  Red rose to the surface spluttering. And finding that he could touch bottom with his feet, he stood with his carroty head out of water, watching for the wagon.  It soon came into view, out of the woods, and the horse that drew it thundered upon the bridge. The horse was old Ebenezer; and Farmer Green was driving him.  \"Hi!\" Red shouted. \"Stop! Wait a minute!\"  Johnnie Green's father pulled Ebenezer to a halt.  \"What's going on here?\" he inquired.  \"Spot took my clothes,\" Red explained. \"He's run down the road with them. Get them for me--please!\"  Hoots and catcalls from the other boys followed Red's speech, which was a wonderfully polite one--for him.  Farmer Green couldn't help laughing.  \"I'm going to the village,\" he said. \"If I find any clothes along the road I'll pick them up and put them in the wagon. And if you're here when I come back I'll give them to you.\"  \"He'll be here!\" Johnnie Green shouted. \"Red'll wait for you.\"  \"If you hurry, maybe you can catch Spot,\" Red called to Farmer Green as he drove off. \"I can't stay here all day.\"  \"You'll have to,\" the boys jeered.  \"Maybe you'll have to wait here till dark,\" Johnnie Green suggested.  \"I won't!\" Red replied, as he swam towards the bank. \"Your dog took my clothes,\" he cried as he ran up to the big hickory. \"And I'm going to take yours.\"  [Illustration: Spot Started After Frisky Squirrel.  (_Page 42_)]  It was Johnnie's turn to yell then. He was on the further side of the mill pond. And long before he could cross it Red had snatched up Johnnie's clothes from the shade of the hickory and dodged into the bushes with them.     IX  A BUNDLE OF CLOTHES   Old dog Spot was trotting down the road with the bundle of clothes in his mouth--the clothes which belonged to Johnnie Green's friend Red, who was one of the swimming party in the mill pond.  Somewhat to Spot's surprise the boys had not come tearing down the road after him.  \"It's queer,\" he said to himself. \"I wonder why they don't follow me. This would be fun if they'd only chase me.\"  Just then he happened to spy a squirrel on a stone wall. Spot promptly made for this gentleman. Keeping a firm hold on his bundle, he plunged through a tangle of blackberry bushes that grew beside the road.  The thorny brambles caught at Spot's bundle and held it fast.  \"_G-r-r-r!_\" he growled. \"I don't want to lose sight of that fat fellow. Unless I'm mistaken, it was Frisky Squirrel. And I've had an eye out for him for a longtime.\"  After a few frantic tugs he let go of the bundle of clothes and dashed after the squirrel.  It was Frisky Squirrel. He ran up a tree while Spot was struggling in the blackberry thicket. And he scampered from one tree top to another while Spot followed beneath him, barking furiously.  At last Frisky stopped and sat on a limb, to chatter and scold at old dog Spot.  \"What are you doing so far from home?\" he demanded after a while.  \"I've been swimming in the mill pond with the boys,\" said old dog Spot.  \"Then you'd better go back there at once, unless you want a punishing later,\" Frisky Squirrel told him. \"I can hear them whistling for you.\"  It wasn't far from the mill pond--that place where they were talking, for Spot's chase of Frisky Squirrel had led him back up the hill again. Now Spot cocked his ear in the direction of the pond and listened. Sure enough! he could hear Johnnie Green's whistle.  \"I'll see you again,\" he told Frisky Squirrel.  \"Not if I see you first!\" Frisky muttered as old Spot started through the woods for the mill pond.  \"Come here!\" Johnnie Green greeted him sternly when, a few minutes later, he appeared on the bank. \"Where are those clothes that you took?\"  Spot wagged his tail. He acted very, very friendly.

I haven't said it did quit in use, or that it could be made to quit in use.\"  \"Then what the hell are you good for?\" Cleary growled.  I didn't have any answer for that.  He repeated his question, blue eyes glittering. \"I asked you what the hell you were good for, Seaman!\" he said, much more loudly.  \"For putting in the middle,\" I snapped back.  \"That's how you interpret this affair, then?\"  \"Yes.\"  \"All right,\" Cleary said, straightening up. \"We'll stop talking about your work as if it were scientific study and talk about it as a play in office politics. Is that what you want?\"  \"I don't want any part of it,\" I said, hoping I wasn't plaintive. \"I work under orders. The director of assembly asked me to test the part to destruction. I tested it. I'm sorry that it wasn't a soldered joint that failed. It wasn't. It was a solenoid. What has that got to do with me?\"  \"Nothing, maybe,\" Cleary conceded, pushing himself up out of his chair. He went to his window to stare out at the parking lot. \"You can be a test engineer all your life, if that's what you want.\"  \"It isn't.\"  \"And what do you want, Mike?\" he said, turning back to face me.  \"Your job,\" I said. \"In time.\"         *       *       *       *       *  He nodded. \"Well said,\" he decided. \"But if you want it, you'll have to learn that business is about ninety per cent people and about ten per cent operations. You know, as you have clearly shown, that Fred Stone is pushing to get me out of here a little before my time, and pushing to make sure that he gets this spot, for which there are other claimants of equal rank in the organization. Oh no,\" he said, holding up his hand. \"Don't tell me that is none of your affair. Right now you are in the unusual position of being able to cast a vote that will decide just how soon Fred Stone can make his move for the top spot. And as long as you sit there and try that smug line of 'I just test 'em and let the chips fall where they may,' you are really siding with Fred Stone. I need something else out of you, and you know it. What's it going to be? Are you a wise enough head at your years to pick a winner in this scrap? And what if it _isn't_ Fred? I'll have your hide, young man.\"  [Illustration]  \"That's what your snippy little brunette said,\" I told him. \"She told me that you'd eat me for breakfast, and she was right.\" I got to my feet.  \"Where are you going,\" he growled. He was still standing behind his chair.  \"To look for another job, Mr. Cleary. There must be some place where the honest result of a test will be assessed as the honest result of a test rather than a move in a political fight.\"  \"Honest result?\" he echoed, and snorted. \"_Was_ your test honest? What _really_ happened out there in space?\"  \"Nobody asked me,\" I said hotly. \"My assignment was to test that gate until a part failed.\"  \"A dishonest assignment,\" Cleary said. \"Sit down a minute.\" We both calmed down and took our seats. I got a cigar out of my coat, peeled the wrapper and made counter-smoke. \"Here, I'll give you an honest assignment, Seaman. You're a test engineer. Tell me what happened _out there in space_. Why did that switching operation fail?\"  \"I haven't the faintest idea,\" I said.  \"Then find out!\"  I chewed my cigar. \"Without duplicating the conditions?\" I protested. \"And how can we? There's zero gravity--zero pressure--all sorts of things going on out there we can't duplicate in a lab.\"  \"I really don't care how you do it,\" he said. \"But if it were my job I'd just light my pipe and sit here and think for a week or so. Why don't _you_ try it?\"  I got up again. \"Yes, sir,\" I said. \"I suppose it would help to have the original telemetry data so that I could evaluate for myself what went wrong.\"  \"I thought you'd get to that,\" he said, passing me a fat file-folder. \"Here it is.\" He stood up, too, and led me to the door. \"And other data you might want?\" he asked, now a good deal more kindly. His hand was on my elbow.  I looked at him. \"How about the phone number of the brunette out there?\" I asked without taking the stogey from my teeth.  \"Sylvia? That's pretty valuable information,\" he said, beginning to grin in a sleepy old fashion. \"But she only dates astronauts. If you haven't made at least three orbits, she won't even have dinner with you.\"  [Illustration]  I stopped at Sylvia's desk with half an idea of asking her for a date. \"Well, Dr. Seaman,\" she demanded as I chewed on my pacifier. \"What did you learn?\"  I thought about it. \"That a lot depends on knowing where to put your feet,\" I said, puffing smoke. \"And my name is Mike.\"  She sniffed. \"If you think Paul Cleary hasn't been around long enough to catch Fred Stone trying to fake him out of position with a meaningless test,\" she said, \"you have another think coming!\"  \"He'd never have tried it,\" I told her, \"if he'd known Cleary had you to look after him.\" That got me a much louder sniff and toss of the dark curly head, which broke up my plans to ask her to dinner.  The telemetry results had been decoded, of course, so that a mere mortal could read them. I didn't have a pipe, which probably meant I'd be a failure as a physicist, so I chewed cigars ragged for about three days and did some serious thinking. When I got a result, I looked up Shouff, Sylvia, Secy./Mgr./Dsgn., in the phone directory, and talked to my favorite brunette.  \"Mr. Cleary's office,\" she said.  \"When would he like to see Mike Seaman?\" I tried.  \"Probably never,\" she told me. \"But I suppose he'll have to. Isn't Fred Stone going to run your errand for you?\"  \"I'm running Fred Stone's errands, isn't that what you really think, Sylvia?\" I asked her.  Sniff! \"He can see you at eleven.\" Click.  Paul Cleary had his coat off and was poring over a large black-on-white schematic when I was shown in by sniffin' Sylvia. \"Hello, Mike,\" he growled. \"Here, Sylvia. Mike's not supposed to see this stuff. Drag it away, honey. Drag it away!\"  With quick motions she rolled up the drawings, snapped a rubber binder around them and went out. Cleary wagged his hairy old paw to the chair beside his desk.  \"So you've been thinking?\" he asked, reaching for his curve-stemmed pipe.  \"How do you know?\"  \"My spies tell me you haven't been out in the lab since the other day. Certainly you were doing something besides sulk in your office.\"  \"Yes.\"  \"Well, what did you come up with? Why did that switching operation fail out in space.\"  \"I don't know.\"  His shaggy eyebrows shot up. \"You don't know? Is that all COMCORP got for three days' pay?\"  \"A confession of ignorance is a hell of a lot more revealing than a solid error,\" I snapped. \"The honest answer that I get out of the telemetry data is that something in that gate broke the circuit and the switching operation failed. I think there are about seven thousand components in the gate. I don't know which one failed. A few I can rule out, because they would only cause part of the gate to fail. But a hundred different breaks could account for the data. So I don't know.\"  He lit his pipe and blew smoke around the curved stem before he made reply. \"So we got a philosopher for our money,\" he said. \"A confession of ignorance, eh? What are you going to do about it?\"  \"You tell me, Mr. Cleary. You're the old head around here.\"  \"So I am,\" he said evenly. \"So I am. Well, my advice to young pups is that they should not be ashamed when they don't know. They should say so. But they should have something else to say along with it.\"  \"For example,\" I suggested grumpily.  \"They should say, 'I don't know, but I know where to find out,'\" he said. \"Tell me, Dr. Seaman, do you know where to find out?\"  He puffed at me for the two or three minutes I thought about it. Really, that's a very long time to think. Most ideas come to you the moment you identify the problem, which is the really hard part of thinking. But this problem took some thought, and I wanted him to think I was thinking.  \"Yes,\" I said at last. \"I know where to find out.\"  \"Where?\"  \"Out in space.\"         *       *       *       *       *  This called for a lot more smoke. \"You mean, go out there and look at the satellite, in space?\"  \"Yes, I can't imagine any other way really to figure it out.\"  He nodded. \"You may be right, Mike. But do you know how much it costs to send a manned satellite aloft?\"  \"Oh,\" I agreed. \"There are cheaper ways. We can beef up every part in that gate, test it much tougher than we already have, and when we get the gate to where all seven thousand components can stand any imaginable strain, we can rebuild the twelve Telstars we haven't launched yet and be pretty sure they won't have switching failures. But that isn't what you asked me.\"  \"We'd have to fix eighteen of them,\" he said. \"The first six are about sixty per cent useless. They'd have to be replaced.\"  \"I still think you should consider sending a man to examine the Telstars in orbit,\" I suggested.  \"Science demands it, eh\" he growled.  \"No, I was thinking that perhaps a simple repair could be made in space, and that you wouldn't have to launch six extra birds.\"  He got out of the chair and went to the clothes tree to put on his coat. The elbows were shiny from leaning on his desk. \"It might be cheaper at that,\" he said. \"The first six are launched in only two orbits. Three telstars in each orbit, separated by one hundred and twenty degrees. Two launches of a repair man might do it, with careful handling. Is that what you had in mind?\"  \"Something like that.\"  \"We'd have to send a pretty rare kind of a repair man, Mike,\" he said, coming "]]]
