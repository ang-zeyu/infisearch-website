The unfit in the State include all those mental and moral and physical defectives who are unable or unwilling to support themselves according to the recognised laws of human society. They include the criminal, the pauper, the idiot and imbecile, the lunatic, the drunkard, the deformed, and the diseased. We are now face to face with the startling fact that this army of defectives is increasing in numbers and relative fertility.  Consider what a burden is the criminal. Every community is more or less terrorised by him; our property is liable to be plundered, our houses invaded, our women ravished, our children murdered. To restrain him we must build gaols, and keep immense staffs of highly paid officials to tend him in confinement, and watch him when he is at liberty. Notwithstanding these, crime is rife, and is rapidly increasing. Says Douglas Morrison:--\"It is perfectly well known to every serious student of criminal questions, both at home and abroad, that the proportion of habitual criminals in the criminal population is steadily on the increase, and was never so high as it is now.... The population under detention in reformatory institutions is increasing more rapidly than the growth of the community as a whole, and, as far as it is possible to see, the juvenile population in prisons is doing the same thing.\" Havelock Ellis (\"The Criminal,\" p. 295), Boies, and McKim, all corroborate this testimony. \"Among the three or four millions of inhabitants of London, one in every five dies in gaol, prison, or workhouse.\" (\"Heredity and Human Progress,\" p. 32.)  All these defectives are prolific, and transmit their fatal taints. \"In a certain family of sixteen persons, eight were born deaf and dumb, and one at least of this family transmitted the defect as far as the third generation.\" (\"Heredity and Human Progress.\") A murderer was the son of a drunkard; of three brothers, one was normal, one a drunkard, and the third was a criminal epileptic. Of his three paternal uncles, one was a murderer, one a half idiot, and one a violent character. Of his four cousins, sons of the latter, two were half idiots, one a complete idiot, and the other a lunatic.  There is an agricultural community of about 4000 in the rich and fertile district in the valley of Artena, in Italy, who have been thieves, brigands, and assassins since 1155 A.D. They were outlawed by Pope Paul IV., in 1557, but they still live and flourish in their crime, the victims of a criminal inheritance. The ratio of homicides in Italy and Artena is as 9 to 61; of assault and battery as 34 to 205; of highway robbery as 3 to 145; of theft as 47 to 111. Professor Pellman, of Bonn University, has traced the careers of a large number of defectives, and shown their cost to the State. Take this example:--A woman who was a thief, a drunkard, and a tramp for forty years of her life, had 834 descendants, 709 of whom were traced; 106 were born out of wedlock, 142 were beggars, and 64 more lived on charity. Of the women, 181 lived disreputable lives. There were in the family 76 convicts, 7 of whom were convicted of murder. In 75 years, this family cost their country in almshouses, trials, courts, prisons, and correctional establishments about £250,000. The injury inflicted by this one family on person and property was simply incalculable.  In New Zealand, the ratio of those dependent upon the State, or on public or private support, has gone up from 16.86 per thousand of population, over 15 years of age in 1878, to 23.01 in 1901. The ratio of defectives, including deaf and dumb, blind, lunatics, epileptics, paralytics, crippled and deformed, debilitated and infirm, has gone up from 5.4 per thousand, over fifteen years, in 1874, to 11.4 in 1896, declining slightly to 10.29 in 1901. The ratio of lunatics has gone up from 1.9, in 1874, to 3.4 in 1901. This is the period of the most rapid and persistent decline in the New Zealand birth-rate; and, coincident with this period, the marriage-rate went down from 8.8 per thousand in 1874, to 5.8 in 1886, and then gradually rose to 7.83 in 1901. The number of weekly rations (Parkes's standard), purchasable by the average weekly wages of an artisan in Wellington province, has gone up from 11 to 16.5 between the years 1877 and 1897. In other words, the price of food and the rate of wages in 1897 would enable an artisan to fill 5½ more mouths than he could have done at the rates prevailing in 1877.  Notwithstanding the development of civilising, Christianising, and educational institutions, crime, insanity, and pauperism are increasing with startling rapidity. The true cause is to be found deep down in biological truth. Society is breeding from defective stock. The best fit to produce the best offspring are ceasing to produce their kind, while the fertility of the worst remains undisturbed. The most striking demographical phenomenon of recent years is the declining birth-rate of civilised nations. In Germany the birth-rate has fallen from 40 to 35 per thousand of the population; in England from 35 to 30; in Ireland from 26 to 22; in France from 26 to 21; and in the United States from 36 to 30 during the last twenty years; while, in New Zealand, it has declined from 40.8, in 1880, to 25.6, in 1900. In Australia there were 47,000 less births in 1899 than would have occurred under the rates prevailing ten years ago.  There is a consensus of opinion among demographists that this decline is due to the voluntary curtailment of the family in married life. Prudence is the motive, and self-restraint the means by which this curtailment is made possible. But prudence and self-restraint are the characteristic attributes of the best citizens. They are conspicuous by their absence in the worst; and it is a matter of common observation that the hopelessly poor, the drunken and improvident, the criminal and the defective have the largest families, while those in the higher walks of life rejoice in smaller numbers. The very qualities, therefore, that make the social unit a law-abiding and useful citizen, who could and should raise the best progeny for the State, also enable him to limit his family, or escape the responsibility of family life altogether; while, on the other hand, the very qualities which make a man a social burden, a criminal, a pauper, or a drunkard--improvidence and defective inhibition--ensure that his fertility will be unrestrained, except by the checks of biological law. And it now comes about that the good citizen, who curtails his family, has the defective offspring of the bad citizen thrown upon his hands to support; and the humanitarian zeal, born of Christian sentiment, which is at flood-tide to-day, ensures that all the defectives born to the world shall not only be nursed and tended, but shall have the same opportunities of the highest possible fertility enjoyed by their defective progenitors.  A higher and nobler human happiness is attainable only through social evolution, and this comes from greater freedom of thought, from bolder enquiry, from broader experience, and from a scientific study of the laws of causation. What \"is\" becomes \"right\" from custom, but with our yearnings for a higher ideal, sentiment slowly yields to the logic of comparison, and, often wiping from our eyes the sorrows over vanishing idols, we behold broader vistas of human powers, possibilities, duties, and destiny.  As the proper study of mankind is man, influenced wholly by a desire to be useful to a society to which I am indebted for the pleasures of civilised life, I offer this brief volume as a comment on a phase of the social condition of the times, and as my conclusions regarding its interest for the future.         *       *       *       *       *     CHAPTER I.

The change, however, was anticipated by the great economist, and predicted in the words:--\"The history of modern civilisation is largely the history of the gradual victory of the third check over the two others\" (_vide_ Essay, 7th edition, p. 476). The third check is moral restraint and the two others vice and misery.  The statistics of all civilized nations show a gradual and progressive decline in the birth-rate much more marked of recent years. In Germany, between the years 1875 and 1899, it has diminished from 40 to 35.9 per thousand of the population. In England and Wales, it dropped from 35 to 29.3 during the same time; in Ireland, from 26 to 22.9; in France, from 26 to 21.9; in the United States of America (between the years 1880 and 1890) the decline has been from 36 to 30; while in New Zealand it gradually and persistently declined from 40.8 in 1880 to 25.6 in 1900.

This was perhaps because she disliked to rumple her beautifully starched skirts.  But Miss Katie--impetuous, dimple-cheeked Katie, would fling herself down anywhere regardless of edged ruffles or floating sash ribbons.  \"For it is clean dirt,\" she laughingly said, when Miss Dorothy playfully scolded her for it.  \"This kind of dirt is healthful, and it isn't going to hurt me if a few dusty twigs or a bit of dried grass or weeds should cling to my gown.  You must remember, Sister Dorothy, there are different kinds of dirt.  I haven't any respect for grease spots or for clothes soiled from wearing them too long.  I don't like that kind of dirt, but to get close to dear old mother earth, and have a scent of her fresh soil once in a while is what I enjoy.  It is delightful.  I like nature too well to stand on ceremony with her.\"  \"You like butterflies too, don't you, aunty?\" asked little Marian.  \"To be sure I do, dear.  I love all the pretty things that fly.\"  \"And the birdies too?\" asked the child.  \"Yes, indeed; I love the birds the best of all.\"  \"And the old cat was awful naughty when he caught the baby robin the other day and ate it up.  Wasn't he, aunty?\"  \"Yes.  Tom is a cruel, bad, bad cat,\" responded Miss Katie, as she squeezed Marian's little pink hand between her own palms.  \"That naughty puss gets plenty to eat in the house and there are lots of nice fat mice in the barn, and yet he slips slyly out to the orchard and takes the life of a poor, innocent little bird.\"  \"And it made the mamma-bird cry because her little one was dead,\" added Miss Dorothy, who had drawn near.  Little Marian heaved a deep sigh and her rosy lips trembled suspiciously.  \"Poor mamma-bird!  It can never have its baby bird any more,\" she said, with a sob of sympathy.  \"Don't you feel sorry for it, Aunt Dorothy?\"  \"Yes, dear.  I feel very sorry for it.\"  \"And I expect the poor mamma-bird cries and cries and weeps and grieves when she comes home to supper and finds out her little children are gone forever and ever.\"  And with her bright eyes dimmed with tears of pity, Marian, clasping a hand of each of the young ladies, walked slowly to the house still bewailing the fate of the robin.  My heart warmed toward these sweet young girls for their tender sympathy.  I almost wished I were a carrier pigeon, that I might devote myself hereafter to their service by bearing loving messages from them to their friends.  But, alas!  I was to have a rude awakening from this pleasant thought. As we flew that evening to our roosting-place, I observed to my mother that if there were no cats in the world what a delightful time we birds might have.  \"You have a greater enemy than the cat,\" she responded sadly.  \"It is true the cat is cruel and tries to kill us, but it knows no better.\"  \"If not the cat, what enemy is it?\" I asked in surprise.  \"I thought the cat was the most bloodthirsty foe the birds had.\"  My mother dipped her wings more slowly and poised her body gracefully a moment.  Then she said impressively, \"Our greatest enemy is man.  No,\" suddenly correcting herself, \"not man, but women, women and children.\"  \"Women and dear little children our enemies?\" said I, in astonishment. \"The pretty ladies who speak so sweet and kind!  The pretty ladies who gather roses in the garden!  Would they deprive us of life?\"  My mother nodded.  \"Yes,\" she answered, \"the pretty ladies, the wicked ladies.\"     CHAPTER II  DICKEY DOWNY'S MEDITATION    It hath the excuse of youth.           --_Shakespeare._   That night I pondered long upon what my mother had told me.  Ever since I left my shell I had been taught to respect my elders, and that it was a mark of ill manners and bad breeding for children to question the superior knowledge of those much older than themselves. Notwithstanding this, in my secret heart I could not help thinking that my mother was mistaken in her estimate of women when she called them wicked.  She had surely misjudged them.  However, I took good care not to mention these doubts to her.  I had heard from my grandmother, who had traveled a great deal from the tropics to the North and back again, that women were the leaders in the churches and were foremost in all Christian and philanthropic work; that they provided beautiful homes for orphan children, where they took care of them and nursed them when they were sick.  She told me about the hospitals where diseased and aged people were kindly cared for by them.  She said they were active in the societies for the prevention of cruelty to children and to animals.  They fed armies of tramps out of sheer pity; even the debauched drunkard was the object of their tenderest care and their earnest prayers.  They held out a friendly hand to the prisoners in the jails and sent them flowers and Bibles; they pitied and cheered the outcast with kind words.  They offered themselves as missionaries for foreign lands to convert the heathen and bring them to Christ.  They soothed the sick and made easy the last days of the dying.  On the battlefield, when blood was flowing and cannon smoking, my grandmother had seen the Red Cross women like angels of mercy binding up the gaping wounds and gently closing the glazed eyes of the expiring soldier.  In woman's ear was poured his last message to his loved ones far away, and when death was near it was woman who spoke the words of consolation and her finger that pointed hopefully to the stars.  Did not all this prove her to be sweet and tender and loving and gentle and kind?  Yes--a thousand times yes.  My grandmother once had her nest near a cemetery, and often related pathetic incidents which had come under her observation at that time. One in particular I now recalled.  It was of a woman who came every day to weep over the mound where her babe was buried.  She was worn to a shadow from her long watching through its illness, and when it was taken from her, her grief was deep.  The bright world was no longer bright since she was bereft of her darling, and her moans for the lost loved one were heartrending.  This incident was only yet another instance of the tenderness of woman's nature, and I could not reconcile it with what my mother had told me.  \"No, no,\" I repeated as I cuddled my head under my wing, \"never can I believe that woman, tender-hearted woman, who is all love and mercy, all gentleness and pity, never can I believe she is our enemy.\"  And resolving to ask my mother to more fully explain her unjust assertion I fell asleep.  But a source of fresh anxiety arose which for a time caused me to forget the matter.  The lindens which fringed the wood were now in full leafage, adorned with their delicate ball-like tassels, and hosts of birds flitted among them daily.  Many of them were of the kind frequently known as indigo birds, smaller than the ordinary bluebird.  In color they were of the metallic cast of blue which has a sheen distinct from the rich shade seen on the jay's wings or the brilliance of the bluebird.  Flashing in and out among the hanging blossoms their beautiful blue coats made them an easy target for the boys who attended the neighborhood country school.  [Illustration: The Indigo Bird.]  To bring down a sweet songster with a shower of stones, panting and bleeding to the ground, they thought was the best sport in the world, and the woods rang and echoed with their whoops and cheers as each poor bird fell to the earth.  A mere glimpse of one of the blue beauties as he hid among the leaves seemed to fire these cruel children with a wish to kill it.  One half-grown boy, who went by the name of Big Bill, was noticeable for his brutality.  He encouraged the others in cruelties which they might not have thought of, for such is the force of evil example and companionship.  A distinguishing mark was a large scar on his cheek, probably inflicted by some enraged animal while being tortured by him. I always felt sure Big Bill would come to some bad end.  My mother said that a cruel childhood was often a training school for the gallows, and the boy who killed defenseless birds and bugs deadened his sensibilities and destroyed his moral nature so that it was easy to commit greater crimes.  So dreadful became the persecutions of the schoolboys that the indigo birds finally held a council and determined to leave that part of the country and settle far from the habitations of men, where they might live unmolested and free from persecutions.     CHAPTER III  THE RULER WITH THE IRON HAND    But evil is wrought by want of thought   As well as want of heart.           --_Hood._   One morning as we flew across the open space which lay between the wood and the wheat fields, we noticed two gentlemen in the orchard who were carefully examining the trees, peering curiously into the cracks of the rough bark or unfolding the curled leaves.  As we came nearer we discovered that one of them was the owner of the place, the father of Miss Dorothy and Miss Katie.  The other was a thin gentleman in spectacles, who held a magnifying glass through which he intently looked at a twig which he had broken off.  After a few minutes' inspection he said: \"Colonel, your orchard is somewhat affected.  This is a specimen of the _chionaspis furfuris_.\"  \"Is it anything like the scurfy-bark louse?\" inquired the colonel.  \"The same thing exactly.  It occurs more commonly in the apple, but it infects the pear and peach trees.  You will find it on the mountain ash, and sometimes on the currant bushes,\" he answered.  The colonel asked him if he would recommend spraying to get rid of the pests, and was advised to begin immediately, using tobacco water or whale-oil soap.  \"By the way,\" said the colonel, \"there is a beetle attacking my shade trees.  They are ruining that fine row of elms in front of the lawn.\"  \"It is undoubtedly the _melolontha vulgaris_,\" said the professor.  I designate him in this"]]]
