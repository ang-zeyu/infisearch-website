We must be pardoned here for making a little remark which, however, astronomers and other scientific men of sanguine temperament would do well to ponder over. An observer cannot be too cautious in announcing to the public his discovery when it is of a nature purely speculative. Nobody is obliged to discover a planet, or a comet, or even a satellite, but, before announcing to the world that you have made such a discovery, first make sure that such is really the fact. Because, you know, should it afterwards come out that you have done nothing of the kind, you make yourself a butt for the stupid jokes of the lowest newspaper scribblers. Belfast had never thought of this. Impelled by his irrepressible rage for discovery--the _furor inveniendi_ ascribed to all astronomers by Aurelius Priscus--he had therefore been guilty of an indiscretion highly un-scientific when his famous telegram, launched to the world at large from the summit of the Rocky Mountains, pronounced so dogmatically on the only possible issues of the great enterprise.  The truth was that his telegram contained _two_ very important errors: 1. Error of _observation_, as facts afterwards proved; the Projectile _was_ not seen on the 13th and _could_ not have been on that day, so that the little black spot which Belfast professed to have seen was most certainly not the Projectile; 2. Error of _theory_ regarding the final fate of the Projectile, since to make it become the Moon's satellite was flying in the face of one of the great fundamental laws of Theoretical Mechanics.  Only one, therefore, the first, of the hypotheses so positively announced, was capable of realization. The travellers--that is to say if they still lived--might so combine and unite their own efforts with those of the Lunar attraction as actually to succeed at last in reaching the Moon's surface.  Now the travellers, those daring but cool-headed men who knew very well what they were about, _did_ still live, they _had_ survived the frightful concussion of the start, and it is to the faithful record of their wonderful trip in the bullet-car, with all its singular and dramatic details, that the present volume is devoted. The story may destroy many illusions, prejudices and conjectures; but it will at least give correct ideas of the strange incidents to which such an enterprise is exposed, and it will certainly bring out in strong colors the effects of Barbican's scientific conceptions, M'Nicholl's mechanical resources, and Ardan's daring, eccentric, but brilliant and effective combinations.  Besides, it will show that J.T. Marston, their faithful friend and a man every way worthy of the friendship of such men, was only losing his time while mirroring the Moon in the speculum of the gigantic telescope on that lofty peak of the mountains.     CHAPTER I.  FROM 10 P.M. TO 10 46' 40''.   The moment that the great clock belonging to the works at Stony Hill had struck ten, Barbican, Ardan and M'Nicholl began to take their last farewells of the numerous friends surrounding them. The two dogs intended to accompany them had been already deposited in the Projectile. The three travellers approached the mouth of the enormous cannon, seated themselves in the flying car, and once more took leave for the last time of the vast throng standing in silence around them. The windlass creaked, the car started, and the three daring men disappeared in the yawning gulf.  The trap-hole giving them ready access to the interior of the Projectile, the car soon came back empty; the great windlass was presently rolled away; the tackle and scaffolding were removed, and in a short space of time the great mouth of the Columbiad was completely rid of all obstructions.  M'Nicholl took upon himself to fasten the door of the trap on the inside by means of a powerful combination of screws and bolts of his own invention. He also covered up very carefully the glass lights with strong iron plates of extreme solidity and tightly fitting joints.  Ardan's first care was to turn on the gas, which he found burning rather low; but he lit no more than one burner, being desirous to economize as much as possible their store of light and heat, which, as he well knew, could not at the very utmost last them longer than a few weeks.  Under the cheerful blaze, the interior of the Projectile looked like a comfortable little chamber, with its circular sofa, nicely padded walls, and dome shaped ceiling.  All the articles that it contained, arms, instruments, utensils, etc., were solidly fastened to the projections of the wadding, so as to sustain the least injury possible from the first terrible shock. In fact, all precautions possible, humanly speaking, had been taken to counteract this, the first, and possibly one of the very greatest dangers to which the courageous adventurers would be exposed.  Ardan expressed himself to be quite pleased with the appearance of things in general.  \"It's a prison, to be sure,\" said he \"but not one of your ordinary prisons that always keep in the one spot. For my part, as long as I can have the privilege of looking out of the window, I am willing to lease it for a hundred years. Ah! Barbican, that brings out one of your stony smiles. You think our lease may last longer than that! Our tenement may become our coffin, eh? Be it so. I prefer it anyway to Mahomet's; it may indeed float in the air, but it won't be motionless as a milestone!\"  [Illustration: TURN ON THE GAS.]  Barbican, having made sure by personal inspection that everything was in perfect order, consulted his chronometer, which he had carefully set a short time before with Chief Engineer Murphy's, who had been charged to fire off the Projectile.  \"Friends,\" he said, \"it is now twenty minutes past ten. At 10 46' 40'', precisely, Murphy will send the electric current into the gun-cotton. We have, therefore, twenty-six minutes more to remain on earth.\"  \"Twenty-six minutes and twenty seconds,\" observed Captain M'Nicholl, who always aimed at mathematical precision.  \"Twenty-six minutes!\" cried Ardan, gaily. \"An age, a cycle, according to the use you make of them. In twenty-six minutes how much can be done! The weightiest questions of warfare, politics, morality, can be discussed, even decided, in twenty-six minutes. Twenty-six minutes well spent are infinitely more valuable than twenty-six lifetimes wasted! A few seconds even, employed by a Pascal, or a Newton, or a Barbican, or any other profoundly intellectual being      Whose thoughts wander through eternity--\"  \"As mad as Marston! Every bit!\" muttered the Captain, half audibly.  \"What do you conclude from this rigmarole of yours?\" interrupted Barbican.  \"I conclude that we have twenty-six good minutes still left--\"  \"Only twenty-four minutes, ten seconds,\" interrupted the Captain, watch in hand.  \"Well, twenty-four minutes, Captain,\" Ardan went on; \"now even in twenty-four minutes, I maintain--\"  \"Ardan,\" interrupted Barbican, \"after a very little while we shall have plenty of time for philosophical disputations. Just now let us think of something far more pressing.\"  \"More pressing! what do you mean? are we not fully prepared?\"  \"Yes, fully prepared, as far at least as we have been able to foresee. But we may still, I think, possibly increase the number of precautions to be taken against the terrible shock that we are so soon to experience.\"  \"What? Have you any doubts whatever of the effectiveness of your brilliant and extremely original idea? Don't you think that the layers of water, regularly disposed in easily-ruptured partitions beneath this floor, will afford us sufficient protection by their elasticity?\"  \"I hope so, indeed, my dear friend, but I am by no means confident.\"  \"He hopes! He is by no means confident! Listen to that, Mac! Pretty time to tell us so! Let me out of here!\"  \"Too late!\" observed the Captain quietly. \"The trap-hole alone would take ten or fifteen minutes to open.\"  \"Oh then I suppose I must make the best of it,\" said Ardan, laughing. \"All aboard, gentlemen! The train starts in twenty minutes!\"  \"In nineteen minutes and eighteen seconds,\" said the Captain, who never took his eye off the chronometer.  The three travellers looked at each other for a little while, during which even Ardan appeared to become serious. After another careful glance at the several objects lying around them, Barbican said, quietly:  \"Everything is in its place, except ourselves. What we have now to do is to decide on the position we must take in order to neutralize the shock as much as possible. We must be particularly careful to guard against a rush of blood to the head.\"  \"Correct!\" said the Captain.  \"Suppose we stood on our heads, like the circus tumblers!\" cried Ardan, ready to suit the action to the word.  \"Better than that,\" said Barbican; \"we can lie on our side. Keep clearly in mind, dear friends, that at the instant of departure it makes very little difference to us whether we are inside the bullet or in front of it. There is, no doubt, _some_ difference,\" he added, seeing the great eyes made by his friends, \"but it is exceedingly little.\"  \"Thank heaven for the _some_!\" interrupted Ardan, fervently.  \"Don't you approve of my suggestion, Captain?\" asked Barbican.  \"Certainly,\" was the hasty reply. \"That is to say, absolutely. Seventeen minutes twenty-seven seconds!\"  \"Mac isn't a human being at all!\" cried Ardan, admiringly. \"He is a repeating chronometer, horizontal escapement, London-made lever, capped, jewelled,--\"  His companions let him run on while they busied themselves in making their last arrangements, with the greatest coolness and most systematic method. In fact, I don't think of anything just now to compare them to except a couple of old travellers who, having to pass the night in the train, are trying to make themselves as comfortable as possible for their long journey. In your profound astonishment, you may naturally ask"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16457"],["title","All Around the Moon (#2)"],["body","of what strange material can the hearts of these Americans be made, who can view without the slightest semblance of a flutter the approach of the most appalling dangers? In your curiosity I fully participate, but, I'm sorry to say, I can't gratify it. It is one of those things that I could never find out.  Three mattresses, thick and well wadded, spread on the disc forming the false bottom of the Projectile, were arranged in lines whose parallelism was simply perfect. But Ardan would never think of occupying his until the very last moment. Walking up and down, with the restless nervousness of a wild beast in a cage, he kept up a continuous fire of talk; at one moment with his friends, at another with the dogs, addressing the latter by the euphonious and suggestive names of Diana and Satellite.  [Illustration: DIANA AND SATELLITE.]  \"Ho, pets!\" he would exclaim as he patted them gently, \"you must not forget the noble part you are to play up there. You must be models of canine deportment. The eyes of the whole Selenitic world will be upon you. You are the standard bearers of your race. From you they will receive their first impression regarding its merits. Let it be a favorable one. Compel those Selenites to acknowledge, in spite of themselves, that the terrestrial race of canines is far superior to that of the very best Moon dog among them!\"  \"Dogs in the Moon!\" sneered M'Nicholl, \"I like that!\"  \"Plenty of dogs!\" cried Ardan, \"and horses too, and cows, and sheep, and no end of chickens!\"  \"A hundred dollars to one there isn't a single chicken within the whole Lunar realm, not excluding even the invisible side!\" cried the Captain, in an authoritative tone, but never taking his eye off the chronometer.  \"I take that bet, my son,\" coolly replied Ardan, shaking the Captain's hand by way of ratifying the wager; \"and this reminds me, by the way, Mac, that you have lost three bets already, to the pretty little tune of six thousand dollars.\"  \"And paid them, too!\" cried the captain, monotonously; \"ten, thirty-six, six!\"  \"Yes, and in a quarter of an hour you will have to pay nine thousand dollars more; four thousand because the Columbiad will not burst, and five thousand because the Projectile will rise more than six miles from the Earth.\"  \"I have the money ready,\" answered the Captain, touching his breeches pocket. \"When I lose I pay. Not sooner. Ten, thirty-eight, ten!\"  \"Captain, you're a man of method, if there ever was one. I think, however, that you made a mistake in your wagers.\"  \"How so?\" asked the Captain listlessly, his eye still on the dial.  \"Because, by Jove, if you win there will be no more of you left to take the money than there will be of Barbican to pay it!\"  \"Friend Ardan,\" quietly observed Barbican, \"my stakes are deposited in the _Wall Street Bank_, of New York, with orders to pay them over to the Captain's heirs, in case the Captain himself should fail to put in an appearance at the proper time.\"  \"Oh! you rhinoceroses, you pachyderms, you granite men!\" cried Ardan, gasping with surprise; \"you machines with iron heads, and iron hearts! I may admire you, but I'm blessed if I understand you!\"  \"Ten, forty-two, ten!\" repeated M'Nicholl, as mechanically as if it was the chronometer itself that spoke.  \"Four minutes and a half more,\" said Barbican.  \"Oh! four and a half little minutes!\" went on Ardan. \"Only think of it! We are shut up in a bullet that lies in the chamber of a cannon nine hundred feet long. Underneath this bullet is piled a charge of 400 thousand pounds of gun-cotton, equivalent to 1600 thousand pounds of ordinary gunpowder! And at this very instant our friend Murphy, chronometer in hand, eye on dial, finger on discharger, is counting the last seconds and getting ready to launch us into the limitless regions of planetary--\"  \"Ardan, dear friend,\" interrupted Barbican, in a grave tone, \"a serious moment is now at hand. Let us meet it with some interior recollection. Give me your hands, my dear friends.\"  \"Certainly,\" said Ardan, with tears in his voice, and already at the other extreme of his apparent levity.  The three brave men united in one last, silent, but warm and impulsively affectionate pressure.  \"And now, great God, our Creator, protect us! In Thee we trust!\" prayed Barbican, the others joining him with folded hands and bowed heads.  \"Ten, forty-six!\" whispered the Captain, as he and Ardan quietly took their places on the mattresses.  Only forty seconds more!  Barbican rapidly extinguishes the gas and lies down beside his companions.  The deathlike silence now reigning in the Projectile is interrupted only by the sharp ticking of the chronometer as it beats the seconds.  Suddenly, a dreadful shock is felt, and the Projectile, shot up by the instantaneous development of 200,000 millions of cubic feet of gas, is flying into space with inconceivable rapidity!     CHAPTER II.  THE FIRST HALF HOUR.   What had taken place within the Projectile? What effect had been produced by the frightful concussion? Had Barbican's ingenuity been attended with a fortunate result? Had the shock been sufficiently deadened by the springs, the buffers, the water layers, and the partitions so readily ruptured? Had their combined effect succeeded in counteracting the tremendous violence of a velocity of 12,000 yards a second, actually sufficient to carry them from London to New York in six minutes? These, and a hundred other questions of a similar nature were asked that night by the millions who had been watching the explosion from the base of Stony Hill. Themselves they forgot altogether for the moment; they forgot everything in their absorbing anxiety regarding the fate of the daring travellers. Had one among them, our friend Marston, for instance, been favored with a glimpse at the interior of the projectile, what would he have seen?  Nothing at all at first, on account of the darkness; except that the walls had solidly resisted the frightful shock. Not a crack, nor a bend, nor a dent could be perceived; not even the slightest injury had the admirably constructed piece of mechanical workmanship endured. It had not yielded an inch to the enormous pressure, and, far from melting and falling back to earth, as had been so seriously apprehended, in showers of blazing aluminium, it was still as strong in every respect as it had been on the very day that it left the Cold Spring Iron Works, glittering like a silver dollar.  Of real damage there was actually none, and even the disorder into which things had been thrown in the interior by the violent shock was comparatively slight. A few small objects lying around loose had been furiously hurled against the ceiling, but the others appeared not to have suffered the slightest injury. The straps that fastened them up were unfrayed, and the fixtures that held them down were uncracked.  The partitions beneath the disc having been ruptured, and the water having escaped, the false floor had been dashed with tremendous violence against the bottom of the Projectile, and on this disc at this moment three human bodies could be seen lying perfectly still and motionless.  Were they three corpses? Had the Projectile suddenly become a great metallic coffin bearing its ghastly contents through the air with the rapidity of a lightning flash?  In a very few minutes after the shock, one of the bodies stirred a little, the arms moved, the eyes opened, the head rose and tried to look around; finally, with some difficulty, the body managed to get on its knees. It was the Frenchman! He held his head tightly squeezed between his hands for some time as if to keep it from splitting. Then he felt himself rapidly all over, cleared his throat with a vigorous \"hem!\" listened to the sound critically for an instant, and then said to himself in a relieved tone, but in his native tongue:  \"One man all right! Call the roll for the others!\"  He tried to rise, but the effort was too great for his strength. He fell back again, his brain swimming, his eyes bursting, his head splitting. His state very much resembled that of a young man waking up in the morning after his first tremendous \"spree.\"  \"Br--rr!\" he muttered to himself, still talking French; \"this reminds me of one of my wild nights long ago in the _Quartier Latin_, only decidedly more so!\"  Lying quietly on his back for a while, he could soon feel that the circulation of his blood, so suddenly and violently arrested by the terrific shock, was gradually recovering its regular flow; his heart grew more normal in its action; his head became clearer, and the pain less distracting.  \"Time to call that roll,\" he at last exclaimed in a voice with some pretensions to firmness; \"Barbican! MacNicholl!\"  He listens anxiously for a reply. None comes. A snow-wrapt grave at midnight is not more silent. In vain does he try to catch even the faintest sound of breathing, though he listens intently enough to hear the beating of their hearts; but he hears only his own.  \"Call that roll again!\" he mutters in a voice far less assured than before; \"Barbican! MacNicholl!\"  The same fearful unearthly stillness.  \"The thing is getting decidedly monotonous!\" he exclaimed, still speaking French. Then rapidly recovering his consciousness as the full horror of the situation began to break on his mind, he went on muttering audibly: \"Have they really hopped the twig? Bah! Fudge! what has not been able to knock the life out of one little Frenchman can't have killed two Americans! They're all right! But first and foremost, let us enlighten the situation!\"  So saying, he contrived without much difficulty to get on his feet. Balancing himself then for a moment, he began groping about for the gas. But he stopped suddenly.  \"Hold on a minute!\" he cried; \"before lighting this match, let us see if the gas has been escaping. Setting fire to a mixture of air and hydrogen would make a pretty how-do-you-do! Such an explosion would infallibly burst the Projectile, which so"]]]
