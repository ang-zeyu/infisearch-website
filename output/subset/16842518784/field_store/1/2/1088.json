I gave the lad a piece to measure by.\"  \"I thought it was the same length. Oh, dear! I am so tired;\" and he propped himself against the old lady's chair.  \"My dear! don't lean so; you'll tipple me over!\" she shrieked.  \"I beg your pardon, Grandmother. Will _that_ do?\"  \"It's that much too long.\"  \"Tear that bit off. Now it's all right.\"  \"But, my dear, that wastes it. Now that bit is of no use. There goes my knitting, you awkward lad!\"  \"Johnnie, pick it up!--Oh! Grandmother, I _am_ so hungry.\" The boy's eyes filled with tears, and the old lady was melted in an instant.  \"What can I do for you, my poor bairns?\" said she. \"There, never mind the scraps, Tommy.\"  \"Tell us a tale, Granny. If you told us a new one, I shouldn't keep thinking of that bread in the cupboard.--Come, Johnnie, and sit against me. Now then!\"  \"I doubt if there's one of my old-world cracks I haven't told you,\" said the old lady, \"unless it's a queer ghost story was told me years ago of that house in the hollow with the blocked-up windows.\"  \"Oh! not ghosts!\" Tommy broke in; \"we've had so many. I know it was a rattling, or a scratching, or a knocking, or a figure in white; and if it turns out a tombstone or a white petticoat, I hate it.\"  \"It was nothing of the sort as a tombstone,\" said the old lady with dignity. \"It's a good half-mile from the churchyard. And as to white petticoats, there wasn't a female in the house; he wouldn't have one; and his victuals came in by the pantry window. But never mind! Though it's as true as a sermon.\"  Johnnie lifted his head from his brother's knee.  \"Let Granny tell what she likes, Tommy. It's a new ghost, and I should like to know who he was, and why his victuals came in by the window.\"  \"I don't like a story about victuals,\" sulked Tommy. \"It makes me think of the bread. O Granny dear! do tell us a fairy story. You never will tell us about the Fairies, and I know you know.\"  \"Hush! hush!\" said the old lady. \"There's Miss Surbiton's Love-letter, and her Dreadful End.\"  \"I know Miss Surbiton, Granny. I think she was a goose. Why don't you tell us about the Fairies?\"  \"Hush! hush! my dear. There's the Clerk and the Corpse-candles.\"  \"I know the Corpse-candles, Granny. Besides, they make Johnnie dream, and he wakes me to keep him company. _Why_ won't you tell us about the Fairies?\"  \"My dear, they don't like it,\" said the old lady.  \"O Granny dear, why don't they? Do tell! I shouldn't think of the bread a bit, if you told us about the Fairies. I know nothing about them.\"  \"He lived in this house long enough,\" said the old lady. \"But it's not lucky to name him.\"  \"O Granny, we are so hungry and miserable, what can it matter?\"  \"Well, that's true enough,\" she sighed. \"Trout's luck is gone; it went with the Brownie, I believe.\"  \"Was that _he_, Granny?\"  \"Yes, my dear, he lived with the Trouts for several generations.\"  \"What was he like, Granny?\"  \"Like a little man, they say, my dear.\"  \"What did he do?\"  \"He came in before the family were up, and swept up the hearth, and lighted the fire, and set out the breakfast, and tidied the room, and did all sorts of house-work. But he never would be seen, and was off before they could catch him. But they could hear him laughing and playing about the house sometimes.\"  \"What a darling! Did they give him any wages, Granny?\"  \"No! my dear. He did it for love. They set a pancheon of clear water for him over night, and now and then a bowl of bread-and-milk, or cream. He liked that, for he was very dainty. Sometimes he left a bit of money in the water. Sometimes he weeded the garden, or threshed the corn. He saved endless trouble, both to men and maids.\"  \"O Granny! why did he go?\"  \"The maids caught sight of him one night, my dear, and his coat was so ragged, that they got a new suit, and a linen shirt for him, and laid them by the bread-and-milk bowl. But when Brownie saw the things, he put them on, and dancing round the kitchen, sang,       'What have we here? Hemten hamten!      Here will I never more tread nor stampen,'  and so danced through the door, and never came back again.\"  \"O Grandmother! But why not? Didn't he like the new clothes?\"  \"The Old Owl knows, my dear; I don't.\"  \"Who's the Old Owl, Granny?\"  \"I don't exactly know, my dear. It's what my mother used to say when we asked anything that puzzled her. It was said that the Old Owl was Nanny Besom (a witch, my dear!), who took the shape of a bird, but couldn't change her voice, and that's why the owl sits silent all day for fear she should betray herself by speaking, and has no singing voice like other birds. Many people used to go and consult the Old Owl at moon-rise, in my young days.\"  \"Did you ever go, Granny?\"  \"Once, very nearly, my dear.\"  \"Oh! tell us, Granny dear.--There are no Corpse-candles, Johnnie; it's only moonlight,\" he added consolingly, as Johnnie crept closer to his knee, and pricked his little red ears.  \"It was when your grandfather was courting me, my dears,\" said the old lady, \"and I couldn't quite make up my mind. So I went to my mother, and said, 'He's this on the one side, but then he's that on the other, and so on. Shall I say yes or no?' And my mother said, 'The Old Owl knows;' for she was fairly puzzled. So says I, 'I'll go and ask her to-night, as sure as the moon rises.'  \"So at moon-rise I went, and there in the white light by the gate stood your grandfather. 'What are you doing here at this time o' night?' says I. 'Watching your window,' says he. 'What are _you_ doing here at this time o' night?' 'The Old Owl knows,' said I, and burst out crying.\"  \"What for?\" said Johnnie.  \"I can't rightly tell you, my dear,\" said the old lady, \"but it gave me such a turn to see him. And without more ado your grandfather kissed me. 'How dare you?' said I. 'What do you mean?' 'The Old Owl knows,' said he. So we never went.\"  \"How stupid!\" said Tommy.  \"Tell us more about Brownie, please,\" said Johnnie, \"Did he ever live with anybody else?\"  \"There are plenty of Brownies,\" said the old lady, \"or used to be in my mother's young days. Some houses had several.\" \"Oh! I wish ours would come back!\" cried both the boys in chorus. \"He'd--  \"tidy the room,\" said Johnnie;  \"fetch the turf,\" said Tommy;  \"pick up the chips,\" said Johnnie;  \"sort your scraps,\" said Tommy;  \"and do everything. Oh! I wish he hadn't gone away.\"  \"What's that?\" said the Tailor, coming in at this moment.  \"It's the Brownie, Father,\" said Tommy. \"We are so sorry he went, and do so wish we had one.\"  \"What nonsense have you been telling them, Mother?\" asked the Tailor.  \"Heighty teighty,\" said the old lady, bristling. \"Nonsense, indeed! As good men as you, son Thomas, would as soon have jumped off the crags, as spoken lightly of _them_, in my mother's young days.\"  \"Well, well,\" said the Tailor, \"I beg their pardon. They never did aught for me, whatever they did for my forbears; but they're as welcome to the old place as ever, if they choose to come. There's plenty to do.\"  \"Would you mind our setting a pan of water, Father?\" asked Tommy very gently. \"There's no bread-and-milk.\"  \"You may set what you like, my lad,\" said the Tailor; \"and I wish there were bread-and-milk for your sakes, bairns. You should have it, had I got it. But go to bed now.\"  They lugged out a pancheon, and filled it with more dexterity than usual, and then went off to bed, leaving the knife in one corner, the wood in another, and a few splashes of water in their track.  There was more room than comfort in the ruined old farm-house, and the two boys slept on a bed of cut heather, in what had been the old malt-loft. Johnnie was soon in the land of dreams, growing rosier and rosier as he slept, a tumbled apple among the grey heather. But not so lazy Tommy. The idea of a domesticated Brownie had taken full possession of his mind; and whither Brownie had gone, where he might be found, and what would induce him to return, were mysteries he longed to solve. \"There's an owl living in the old shed by the mere,\" he thought. \"It may be the Old Owl herself, and she knows, Granny says. When Father's gone to bed, and the moon rises, I'll go.\" Meanwhile he lay down.         *       *       *       *       *  The moon rose like gold, and went up into the heavens like silver, flooding the moors with a pale ghostly light, taking the colour out of the heather, and painting black shadows under the stone walls. Tommy opened his eyes, and ran to the window. \"The moon has risen,\" said he, and crept softly down the ladder, through the kitchen, where was the pan of water, but no Brownie, and so out on to the moor. The air was fresh, not to say chilly; but it was a glorious night, though everything but the wind and Tommy seemed asleep. The stones, the walls, the gleaming lanes, were so intensely still; the church tower in the valley seemed awake and watching, but silent; the houses in the village round it had all their eyes shut, that is, their window-blinds down; and it seemed to Tommy as if the very moors had drawn white sheets over them, and lay sleeping also.  \"Hoot! hoot!\" said a voice from the fir plantation behind him. Somebody else was awake, then. \"It's the Old Owl,\" said Tommy; and there she came, swinging heavily across the moor with a flapping stately flight, and sailed into the shed by the mere. The old lady moved faster than she seemed to do, and though Tommy ran hard she was in the shed some time before him. When he got in, no bird was to be seen, but he heard a crunching sound from above, and looking up, there sat the Old Owl, pecking and tearing and munching at some shapeless black object, and blinking at him--Tommy--with yellow eyes.  \"Oh dear!\" said Tommy, for he didn't much like it.  The Old Owl dropped the black mass on to the floor; and Tommy did not care somehow to examine it.  \"Come up! come up!\" said she hoarsely.  She could speak, then! Beyond all doubt it was _the_ Old Owl, and none other. Tommy shuddered.

There is a period in youth when the mere power of numbers has a more strong effect on ear and imagination than in more advanced life. At this season of immature taste, the author was greatly delighted with the poems of Mickle and Langhorne, poets who, though by no means deficient in the higher branches of their art, were eminent for their powers of verbal melody above most who have practised this department of poetry. One of those pieces of Mickle, which the author was particularly pleased with, is a ballad, or rather a species of elegy, on the subject of Cumnor Hall, which, with others by the same author, was to be found in Evans's Ancient Ballads (vol. iv., page 130), to which work Mickle made liberal contributions. The first stanza especially had a peculiar species of enchantment for the youthful ear of the author, the force of which is not even now entirely spent; some others are sufficiently prosaic.        CUMNOR HALL.       The dews of summer night did fall;      The moon, sweet regent of the sky,      Silver'd the walls of Cumnor Hall,      And many an oak that grew thereby,       Now nought was heard beneath the skies,      The sounds of busy life were still,      Save an unhappy lady's sighs,      That issued from that lonely pile.       “Leicester,” she cried, “is this thy love      That thou so oft hast sworn to me,      To leave me in this lonely grove,      Immured in shameful privity?       “No more thou com'st with lover's speed,      Thy once beloved bride to see;      But be she alive, or be she dead,      I fear, stern Earl, 's the same to thee.       “Not so the usage I received      When happy in my father's hall;      No faithless husband then me grieved,      No chilling fears did me appal.       “I rose up with the cheerful morn,      No lark more blithe, no flower more gay;      And like the bird that haunts the thorn,      So merrily sung the livelong day.       “If that my beauty is but small,      Among court ladies all despised,      Why didst thou rend it from that hall,      Where, scornful Earl, it well was prized?       “And when you first to me made suit,      How fair I was you oft would say!      And proud of conquest, pluck'd the fruit,      Then left the blossom to decay.       “Yes!  now neglected and despised,      The rose is pale, the lily's dead;      But he that once their charms so prized,      Is sure the cause those charms are fled.       “For know, when sick'ning grief doth prey,      And tender love's repaid with scorn,      The sweetest beauty will decay,--      What floweret can endure the storm?       “At court, I'm told, is beauty's throne,      Where every lady's passing rare,      That Eastern flowers, that shame the sun,      Are not so glowing, not so fair.       “Then, Earl, why didst thou leave the beds      Where roses and where lilies vie,      To seek a primrose, whose pale shades      Must sicken when those gauds are by?       “'Mong rural beauties I was one,      Among the fields wild flowers are fair;      Some country swain might me have won,      And thought my beauty passing rare.       “But, Leicester (or I much am wrong),      Or 'tis not beauty lures thy vows;      Rather ambition's gilded crown      Makes thee forget thy humble spouse.       “Then, Leicester, why, again I plead      (The injured surely may repine)--      Why didst thou wed a country maid,      When some fair princess might be thine?       “Why didst thou praise my hum'ble charms,      And, oh!  then leave them to decay?      Why didst thou win me to thy arms,      Then leave to mourn the livelong day?       “The village maidens of the plain      Salute me lowly as they go;      Envious they mark my silken train,      Nor think a Countess can have woe.       “The simple nymphs!  they little know      How far more happy's their estate;      To smile for joy, than sigh for woe--      To be content, than to be great.       “How far less blest am I than them?      Daily to pine and waste with care!      Like the poor plant that, from its stem      Divided, feels the chilling air.       “Nor, cruel Earl!  can I enjoy      The humble charms of solitude;      Your minions proud my peace destroy,      By sullen frowns or pratings rude.       “Last night, as sad I chanced to stray,      The village death-bell smote my ear;      They wink'd aside, and seemed to say,      'Countess, prepare, thy end is near!'       “And now, while happy peasants sleep,      Here I sit lonely and forlorn;      No one to soothe me as I weep,      Save Philomel on yonder thorn.       “My spirits flag--my hopes decay--      Still that dread death-bell smites my ear;      And many a boding seems to say,      'Countess, prepare, thy end is near!'”       Thus sore and sad that lady grieved,      In Cumnor Hall, so lone and drear;      And many a heartfelt sigh she heaved,      And let fall many a bitter tear.       And ere the dawn of day appear'd,      In Cumnor Hall, so lone and drear,      Full many a piercing scream was heard,      And many a cry of mortal fear.       The death-bell thrice was heard to ring,      An aerial voice was heard to call,      And thrice the raven flapp'd its wing      Around the towers of Cumnor Hall.       The mastiff howl'd at village door,      The oaks were shatter'd on the green;      Woe was the hour--for never more      That hapless Countess e'er was seen!       And in that Manor now no more      Is cheerful feast and sprightly ball;      For ever since that dreary hour      Have spirits haunted Cumnor Hall.       The village maids, with fearful glance,      Avoid the ancient moss-grown wall;      Nor ever lead the merry dance,      Among the groves of Cumnor Hall.       Full many a traveller oft hath sigh'd,      And pensive wept the Countess' fall,      As wand'ring onward they've espied      The haunted towers of Cumnor Hall.       ARBOTSFORD, 1st March 1831.      KENILWORTH    CHAPTER I.        I am an innkeeper, and know my grounds,      And study them; Brain o' man, I study them.      I must have jovial guests to drive my ploughs,      And whistling boys to bring my harvests home,      Or I shall hear no flails thwack.             THE NEW INN.  It is the privilege of tale-tellers to open their story in an inn, the free rendezvous of all travellers, and where the humour of each displays itself without ceremony or restraint. This is specially suitable when the scene is laid during the old days of merry England, when the guests were in some sort not merely the inmates, but the messmates and temporary companions of mine Host, who was usually a personage of privileged freedom, comely presence, and good-humour. Patronized by him the characters of the company were placed in ready contrast; and they seldom failed, during the emptying of a six-hooped pot, to throw off reserve, and present themselves to each other, and to their landlord, with the freedom of old acquaintance.  The village of Cumnor, within three or four miles of Oxford, boasted, during the eighteenth of Queen Elizabeth, an excellent inn of the old stamp, conducted, or rather ruled, by Giles Gosling, a man of a goodly person, and of somewhat round belly; fifty years of age and upwards, moderate in his reckonings, prompt in his payments, having a cellar of sound liquor, a ready wit, and a pretty daughter. Since the days of old Harry Baillie of the Tabard in Southwark, no one had excelled Giles Gosling in the power of pleasing his guests of every description; and so great was his fame, that to have been in Cumnor without wetting a cup at the bonny Black Bear, would have been to avouch one's-self utterly indifferent to reputation as a traveller. A country fellow might as well return from London without looking in the face of majesty. The men of Cumnor were proud of their Host, and their Host was proud of his house, his liquor, his daughter, and himself.  It was in the courtyard of the inn which called this honest fellow landlord, that a traveller alighted in the close of the evening, gave his horse, which seemed to have made a long journey, to the hostler, and made some inquiry, which produced the following dialogue betwixt the myrmidons of the bonny Black Bear.  “What, ho! John Tapster.”  “At hand, Will Hostler,” replied the man of the spigot, showing himself in his costume of loose jacket, linen breeches, and green apron, half within and half without a door, which appeared to descend to an outer cellar.  “Here is a gentleman asks if you draw good ale,” continued the hostler.  “Beshrew my heart else,” answered the tapster, “since there are but four miles betwixt us and Oxford. Marry, if my ale did not convince the heads of the scholars, they would soon convince my pate with the pewter flagon.”  “Call you that Oxford logic?” said the stranger, who had now quitted the rein of his horse, and was advancing towards the inn-door, when he was encountered by the goodly form of Giles Gosling himself.  “Is it logic you talk of, Sir Guest?” said the host; “why, then, have at you with a downright consequence--        'The horse to the rack,      And to fire with the sack.'”  “Amen! with all my heart, my good host,” said the stranger; “let it be a quart of your best Canaries, and give me your good help to drink it.”  “Nay, you are but in your accidence yet, Sir Traveller, if you call on your host for help for such a sipping matter as a quart of sack; Were it a gallon, you might lack some neighbouring aid at my hand, and yet call yourself a toper.”  “Fear me not.” said the guest, “I will do my devoir as becomes a man who finds himself within five miles of Oxford; for I am not come from the field of Mars to discredit myself amongst the followers of Minerva.”  As he spoke thus, the landlord, with much semblance of hearty welcome, ushered his guest into a large, low chamber, where several persons"]]]
