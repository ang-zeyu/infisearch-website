Suppose your task, my little man,       Is very hard to get,     Will it make it any easier       For you to sit and fret?     And wouldn't it be wiser       Than waiting like a dunce,     To go to work in earnest,       And learn the thing at once?      ALICE CARY     [Illustration]  CINDERELLA--I   Once upon a time there lived a maiden named Cinderella.  Her mother was dead, and she had to work very, very hard in the kitchen.  She had two older sisters, but they were cross to little Cinderella.  They made her stay among the pots and the kettles and do all the hard work about the house.  Sometimes, to keep warm, she crept in among the cinders.  That is why she was called Cinderella.  One day the sisters came dancing into the house. \"We have been invited to the king's ball,\" they cried.  At length the day of the great ball came, and the two sisters rode away in their fine silk dresses.  Poor Cinderella, who had to stay behind, looked at her old ragged clothes, and burst into tears.  \"Alas,\" she cried, \"why should I always have to stay in the kitchen while my sisters dress in silks and satins?\"  Hardly had she spoken when there stood before her a dear little old lady with a golden wand in her hand.  \"My child,\" she cried, \"I am your fairy godmother, and you shall go to the ball, too.  First go into the garden, Cinderella, and bring to me the largest pumpkin you can find.\"  When Cinderella had done this, the fairy waved her golden wand over the yellow pumpkin.  In a flash, it was not a pumpkin at all, but a beautiful yellow coach.  \"Now bring me four white mice, two large ones and two small ones.\"  In a moment Cinderella brought a trap full of mice into the room.  The fairy waved her golden wand, and the two largest mice were turned into two snow-white horses.  Two small mice became two men, one a coachman, the other a footman.  \"But how am I to go in these clothes?\" said Cinderella.  \"Ah, let me see,\" said the fairy, and she slowly waved her wand over the maiden's head.  [Illustration]  Oh, what a change!  The rags tumbled to the floor.  And, what do you think! in their place was a beautiful pink silk dress.  The ugly shoes fell off.  And, lo! a tiny pair of glass slippers were on Cinderella's little feet.  \"Now listen to what I say,\" said the fairy godmother. \"You must not stay after the clock strikes twelve.  At that time your coach will again be a pumpkin, the men will be mice, and you will have on your old ragged dress.\"  Cinderella said she would not forget.  Then she jumped into the coach, and away she drove to the king's ball.   CINDERELLA--II  The king's son was charmed with Cinderella.  She was so very beautiful that he would dance with her and with no one else.  Cinderella had such a good time that she forgot about the clock.  It began to strike twelve--one, two, three.  Cinderella ran from the room.  Down the steps of the palace she flew.  She ran so fast that she lost one of her little glass slippers.  The clock finished striking.  Lo! the coach turned into a pumpkin.  The horses and men turned into mice.  Poor Cinderella had to walk home in her ragged clothes.  The next morning the prince found Cinderella's little glass slipper on the stairs.  \"There is only one maiden in all the world who can wear so tiny a slipper,\" said the prince. \"I will marry her and no other.\"  The prince hunted far and wide for a maiden who could put it on. Many tried, but none could do it.  At last he came to the house where Cinderella lived. The two older sisters tried and tried to put the slipper on their large feet.  While the prince was waiting, Cinderella came into the room.  \"Let me try it,\" she said.  \"You!\" cried the older sisters. \"You could never put it on.\"  \"Let her try it,\" said the prince.  At once the little glass slipper was fitted to the tiny foot.  [Illustration]  Then Cinderella stood up; her ragged clothes turned into a beautiful silk dress, and there were two little slippers on her two little feet.  Then the prince knew that Cinderella was the one he had danced with at the ball, and taking her hand, he led her out to his coach.  Soon they were married and lived happily ever after.  _English Fairy Tale_         RAINDROPS      Oh, where do you come from,       You little drops of rain,     Pitter-patter, pitter-patter,       Down the windowpane?      Tell me, little raindrops,       Is that the way you play?     Pitter-patter, pitter-patter,       All the rainy day?      I sit here at the window;       I've nothing else to do;     Oh, I wish that I could play,       This rainy day, with you!      The little raindrops cannot speak,       But \"pitter-patter-pat\"     Means, \"We can play on this side,       Why can't you play on that?\"      ANN HAWKSHAWE     [Illustration]  THE FOUR FRIENDS--I  comb  music  giants  chief   Once upon a time a man had a donkey.  His donkey had worked for him many years.  At last the donkey grew so old that he was no longer of any use for work, and his master wished to get rid of him.  The donkey, fearing he might be killed, ran away.  He took the road to Bremen, where he had often heard the street band playing.  He liked music, so he thought he might join the band.  He had not gone far when he came upon an old dog.  The dog was panting, as if he had been running a long way.  \"Why are you panting, my friend?\" asked the donkey.  \"Ah,\" said the dog, \"I am too old for the hunt. My master wished to have me killed. So I ran away. But how I am to find bread and meat, I do not know.\"  \"Well,\" said the donkey, \"come with me. I am going to play in the band at Bremen. I think you and I can easily earn a living by music. I can play the lute, and you can play the kettledrum.\"  The dog was quite willing, and so they be walked on.  They had not gone far when they saw a cat sitting in a yard.  He looked as sad as three days of rainy weather.  \"What's the matter with you, old Tom?\" asked the donkey.  \"You would be sad, too,\" said the cat, \"if you were in my place; for now that I am getting old and cannot catch mice, they wish to drown me. I have run away, but how I am going to live, I do not know.\"  \"Come with us to Bremen,\" said the donkey. \"We are going to play in the band.  I know you love music, as you sing so well at night. You too can join the band.\"  \"That is just what I should like to do,\" said the cat.  So the donkey, the dog, and the cat all walked on together.  [Illustration]  After a time the three came to a farmyard.  There on the gate sat a cock, crying \"Cock-a-doodle-doo\" with all his might.  \"Why are you making so much noise?\" asked the donkey.  \"Ah,\" said the cock, \"I find I must have my head cut off so that I may serve as a dinner for Monday. I'm crowing as hard as I can while my head is still on.\"  \"Come with us, old Red Comb,\" said the donkey. \"We are going to Bremen to join the band. You have a fine voice. You can join, too.\"  \"Ah,\" said the cock, \"that is just what I should like to do.\"  And they all went on their way to Bremen.   THE FOUR FRIENDS--II  At evening the four friends came to a wood, where they stopped for the night.  The donkey and the dog lay down under a large tree.  The cat climbed up on one of the branches.  The cock flew to the very top of the tree, where he felt quite safe.  From his perch on the top of the tree the cock saw a light.  Calling to his friends, he said, \"We are not far from a house. I can see a light.\"  \"Let us go on,\" said the donkey, \"for it may be just the house for us.\"  As they drew near, the light grew larger and brighter.  At last they could see that it came from the window of a robber's house.  The donkey, who was the tallest, went up and looked in.  \"What do you see, old Long Ears?\" asked the cock.  \"What do I see?\" answered the donkey. \"Why, a table spread with plenty to eat and drink, and the robbers having their supper.\"  \"We should be there, too, if we had our rights,\" said the cock.  \"Ah, yes,\" said the donkey; \"if we could only get inside.\"  Then the four friends talked over what they had better do in order to drive the robbers out of the house.  At last they hit upon a plan.  The donkey stood upon his hind legs and placed his front feet on the window sill.  [Illustration]  The dog then stood on the donkey's back  The cat climbed upon the dog, while the cock perched upon the cat's head.  The donkey gave a signal, and they began all at the same time, to make their loudest music.  The donkey brayed, the dog barked, the cat mewed, and the cock crowed, all with such force that the windowpane shook and was almost broken.  The robbers had never heard such a noise.  They thought it must come from witches, or giants, or goblins, and they all ran as fast as they could to the wood behind the house.  Then our four friends rushed in and ate what the robbers had left upon the table.  It did not take long, for they acted as if they had been hungry for a month.  When the four had eaten, they put out the light, and each went to sleep in the spot which he liked the best.  The donkey lay down in the yard.  The dog lay behind the door.  The cat curled himself in front of the fire, while the cock flew up on a high beam.  They soon fell fast asleep.   THE FOUR FRIENDS--III  When all was still and the light was out, the robber chief sent one of his bravest men back to the house.  The man found the house quiet, so he went into the kitchen to strike a light.  Seeing the great fiery eyes of the cat, he thought they were live coals and held a match to them.  Puss was so angry that he flew up and scratched the man's face. This gave the robber a great fright, and he ran for the door.  As he went by, the dog sprang up and bit him in the leg.  In the yard the robber ran into the donkey, who gave him a great kick.  The cock on the beam was waked by the! noise, and cried, \"Cock-a-doodle-doo!\"  The man ran as fast as his"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15661"],["title","The Golden Goose Book (#1)"],["body","at, Huge Bear.  One day, after they had made the porridge for their breakfast, and poured it into their porridge-pots, they walked out into the wood while the porridge was cooling, that they might not burn their mouths by beginning too soon to eat it. And while they were walking, a little Girl called Goldenlocks came to the house. First she looked in at the window, and then she peeped in at the keyhole; and seeing nobody in the house, she turned the handle of the door. The door was not fastened, because the Bears were good Bears, who did nobody any harm, and never suspected that anybody would harm them. So Goldenlocks opened the door, and went in; and well pleased she was when she saw the porridge on the table. If she had been a thoughtful little Girl, she would have waited till the Bears came home, and then, perhaps, they would have asked her to breakfast; for they were good Bears--a little rough or so, as the manner of Bears is, but for all that very good-natured and hospitable. But the porridge looked tempting, and she set about helping herself.  So first she tasted the porridge of the Great, Huge Bear, and that was too hot for her. And then she tasted the porridge of the Middle Bear, and that was too cold for her. And then she went to the porridge of the Little, Small, Wee Bear, and tasted that; and that was neither too hot nor too cold, but just right, and she liked it so well that she ate it all up.  Then Goldenlocks sat down in the chair of the Great, Huge Bear, and that was too hard for her. And then she sat down in the chair of the Middle Bear, and that was too soft for her. And then she sat down in the chair of the Little, Small, Wee Bear, and that was neither too hard nor too soft, but just right. So she seated herself in it, and there she sat till the bottom of the chair came out, and down she came plump upon the ground.  Then Goldenlocks went upstairs into the bedchamber in which the three Bears slept. And first she lay down upon the bed of the Great, Huge Bear, but that was too high at the head for her. And next she lay down upon the bed of the Middle Bear, and that was too high at the foot for her. And then she lay down upon the bed of the Little, Small, Wee Bear; and that was neither too high at the head nor at the foot, but just right. So she covered herself up comfortably, and lay there till she fell fast asleep.  By this time the Three Bears thought their porridge would be cool enough; so they came home to breakfast. Now Goldenlocks had left the spoon of the Great, Huge Bear standing in his porridge.  \"SOMEBODY HAS BEEN AT MY PORRIDGE!\" said the Great, Huge Bear, in his great, rough, gruff voice. And when the Middle Bear looked at hers, she saw that the spoon was standing in it too.  \"SOMEBODY HAS BEEN AT MY PORRIDGE!\" said the Middle Bear, in her middle voice. Then the Little, Small, Wee Bear looked at his, and there was the spoon in the porridge-pot, but the porridge was all gone.  \"SOMEBODY HAS BEEN AT MY PORRIDGE, AND HAS EATEN IT ALL UP!\" said the Little, Small, Wee Bear, in his little, small, wee voice.  Upon this the Three Bears, seeing that someone had entered their house, and eaten up the Little, Small, Wee Bear's breakfast, began to look about them. Now Goldenlocks had not put the hard cushion straight when she rose from the chair of the Great, Huge Bear.  \"SOMEBODY HAS BEEN SITTING IN MY CHAIR!\" said the Great, Huge Bear, in his great, rough, gruff voice.  And Goldenlocks had squatted down the soft cushion of the Middle Bear.  \"SOMEBODY HAS BEEN SITTING IN MY CHAIR!\" said the Middle Bear, in her middle voice.  And you know what Goldenlocks had done to the third chair.  \"SOMEBODY HAS BEEN SITTING IN MY CHAIR, AND HAS SAT THE BOTTOM OUT OF IT!\" said the Little, Small, Wee Bear, in his little, small, wee voice.  Then the Three Bears thought it necessary that they should make farther search; so they went upstairs into their bedchamber. Now Goldenlocks had pulled the pillow of the Great, Huge Bear out of its place.  \"SOMEBODY HAS BEEN LYING IN MY BED!\" said the Great, Huge Bear, in his great, rough, gruff voice.  And Goldenlocks had pulled the bolster of the Middle Bear out of its place.  \"SOMEBODY HAS BEEN LYING IN MY BED!\" said the Middle Bear, in her middle voice.  And when the Little, Small, Wee Bear came to look at his bed, there was the bolster in its place; and the pillow in its place upon the bolster; and upon the pillow was the head of Goldenlocks--which was not in its place, for she had no business there.  \"SOMEBODY HAS BEEN LYING IN MY BED--AND HERE SHE IS!\" said the Little, Small, Wee Bear, in his little, small, wee voice.  Goldenlocks had heard in her sleep the great, rough, gruff voice of the Great, Huge Bear, and the middle voice of the Middle Bear, but it was only as if she had heard someone speaking in a dream. But when she heard the little, small, wee voice of the Little, Small, Wee Bear, it was so sharp, and so shrill, that it awakened her at once. Up she started; and when she saw the Three Bears on one side of the bed she tumbled herself out at the other, and ran to the window. Now the window was open, because the Bears, like good, tidy Bears, as they were, always opened their bedchamber window when they got up in the morning. Out Goldenlocks jumped, and ran away as fast as she could run--never looking behind her; and what happened to her afterwards I cannot tell. But the Three Bears never saw anything more of her.     THE THREE LITTLE PIGS   Once upon a time there was an old Sow with three little Pigs, and as she had not enough to keep them, she sent them out to seek their fortune.  The first that went off met a Man with a bundle of straw, and said to him, \"Please, Man, give me that straw to build me a house\"; which the Man did, and the little Pig built a house with it. Presently came along a Wolf, and knocked at the door, and said, \"Little Pig, little Pig, let me come in.\"  To which the Pig answered, \"No, no, by the hair of my chinny chin chin.\"  \"Then I'll huff and I'll puff, and I'll blow your house in!\" said the Wolf. So he huffed, and he puffed, and he blew his house in, and ate up the little Pig.  The second Pig met a Man with a bundle of furze, and said, \"Please, Man, give me that furze to build a house\"; which the Man did, and the Pig built his house. Then along came the Wolf and said, \"Little Pig, little Pig, let me come in.\"  \"No, no, by the hair of my chinny chin chin.\"  \"Then I'll puff and I'll huff, and I'll blow your house in!\" So he huffed and he puffed, and he puffed and he huffed, and at last he blew the house down, and ate up the second little Pig.  The third little Pig met a Man with a load of bricks, and said, \"Please, Man, give me those bricks to build a house with\"; so the Man gave him the bricks, and he built his house with them. So the Wolf came, as he did to the other little Pigs, and said, \"Little Pig, little Pig, let me come in.\"  \"No, no, by the hair of my chinny chin chin.\" \"Then I'll huff and I'll puff, and I'll blow your house in.\" Well, he huffed and he puffed, and he huffed and he puffed, and he puffed and he huffed; but he could _not_ get the house down. When he found that he could not, with all his huffing and puffing, blow the house down, he said, \"Little Pig, I know where there is a nice field of turnips.\"  \"Where?\" said the little Pig.  \"Oh, in Mr. Smith's home-field; and if you will be ready to-morrow morning, I will call for you, and we will go together and get some for dinner.\"  \"Very well,\" said the little Pig, \"I will be ready. What time do you mean to go?\"  \"Oh, at six o'clock.\"  Well, the little Pig got up at five, and got the turnips and was home again before six. When the Wolf came he said, \"Little Pig, are you ready?\"  \"Ready!\" said the little Pig, \"I have been and come back again, and got a nice pot-full for dinner.\"  The Wolf felt very angry at this, but thought that he would be _up_ to the little Pig somehow or other; so he said, \"Little Pig, I know where there is a nice apple-tree.\" \"Where?\" said the Pig.  \"Down at Merry-garden,\" replied the Wolf; \"and if you will not deceive me I will come for you, at five o'clock to-morrow, and we will go together and get some apples.\"  Well, the little Pig woke at four the next morning, and bustled up, and went off for the apples, hoping to get back before the Wolf came; but he had farther to go, and had to climb the tree, so that just as he was coming down from it, he saw the Wolf coming, which, as you may suppose, frightened him very much. When the Wolf came up he said, \"Little Pig, what! are you here before me? Are they nice apples?\"  \"Yes, very,\" said the little Pig; \"I will throw you down one.\" And he threw it so far that, while the Wolf was gone to pick it up, the little Pig jumped down and ran home.  The next day the Wolf came again, and said to the little Pig, \"Little Pig, there is a Fair in the Town this afternoon: will you go?\"  \"Oh, yes,\" said the Pig, I will go; what time shall you be ready?\"  \"At three,\" said the Wolf.  So the little Pig went off before the time, as usual, and got to the Fair, and bought a butter churn, and was on his way home with it when he saw the Wolf coming. Then he could not tell what to do. So he got into the churn to hide, and in doing so turned it round, and it began to roll, and rolled down the hill with the Pig inside it, which frightened the Wolf so much that he ran home without going to the Fair.  He went to the little Pig's house, and told him how frightened he had been by a great round thing which came down the hill past him.  Then the little Pig said, \"Hah! I frightened you, did I? I had been to the Fair and bought a butter churn, and when I saw you I got into it, and rolled down the hill.\"  Then the Wolf was very angry indeed, and declared he would eat up the little Pig, and that he would get down the chimney after him.  When the little Pig saw what he was about, he hung on the pot full of water, and made up a blazing fire, and,"]]]
