The day will come when thou wilt gaze upon the stars, and long bitterly to go thither. I will once more appear to thee; when, bowed to the dust with affliction, thou rememberest me, and weepest to come to me, I will return. Then do thou come. But now do thou, looking on the horizon, follow the design of my finger. I will show thee two human figures. These two beings are in this world the arbiters of thy destiny. If possible, when thou meetest them turn away as from venomous snakes. In their paths walk thou not.\"  Then the shining figure pointed to the opposite sky. Kunda, following the indication, saw traced on the blue vault the figure of a man more beautiful than a god. Beholding his high, capacious forehead, his sincere kindly glance, his swan-like neck a little bent, and other traits of a fine man, no one would have believed that from him there was anything to be feared.  Then the figure dissolving as a cloud in the sky, the mother said--  \"Forget not this god-like form. Though benevolent, he will be the cause of thy misery; therefore avoid him as a snake.\"  Again pointing to the heavens she continued--  \"Look hither.\"  Kunda, looking, saw a second figure sketched before her, not this time that of a man, but a young woman of bright complexion and lotus-shaped eyes. At this sight she felt no fear; but the mother said--  \"This dark figure in a woman's dress is a _Rakshasi_.[2] When thou seest her, flee from her.\"  [Footnote 2: A female demon.]  As she thus spoke the heavens suddenly became dark, the halo disappeared from the sky, and with it the bright figure in its midst.  Then Kunda awoke from her sleep.  Nagendra went to the village, the name of which he heard was Jhunjhunpur. At his recommendation and expense, some of the villagers performed the necessary rites for the dead, one of the female neighbours remaining with the bereaved girl. When Kunda saw that they had taken her father away, she became convinced of his death, and gave way to ceaseless weeping.  In the morning the neighbour returned to her own house, but sent her daughter Champa to comfort Kunda Nandini.  Champa was of the same age as Kunda, and her friend. She strove to divert her mind by talking of various matters, but she saw that Kunda did not attend. She wept constantly, looking up every now and then into the sky as though in expectation.  Champa jestingly asked, \"What do you see that you look into the sky a hundred times?\"  Kunda replied, \"My mother appeared to me yesterday, and bade me go with her, but I feared to do so; now I mourn that I did not. If she came again I would go: therefore I look constantly into the sky.\"  Champa said, \"How can the dead return?\"  To which Kunda replied by relating her vision.  Greatly astonished, Champa asked, \"Are you acquainted with the man and woman whose forms you saw in the sky?\"  \"No, I had never seen them. There cannot be anywhere a man so handsome; I never saw such beauty.\"  On rising in the morning, Nagendra inquired of the people in the village what would become of the dead man's daughter, where she would live, and whether she had any relatives. He was told that there was no dwelling-place for her, and that she had no relatives.  Then Nagendra said, \"Will not some of you receive her and give her in marriage? I will pay the expense, and so long as she remains amongst you I will pay so much a month for her board and lodging.\"  If he had offered ready money many would have consented to his proposal; but after he had gone away Kunda would have been reduced to servitude, or turned out of the house. Nagendra did not act in so foolish a manner; therefore, money not being forthcoming, no one consented to his suggestion.  At length one, seeing him at the end of his resources, observed: \"A sister of her mother's lives at Sham Bazar; Binod Ghosh is the husband's name. You are on you way to Calcutta; if you take her with you and place her with her aunt, then this _Kaystha_ girl will be cared for, and you will have done your duty to your caste.\"  Seeing no other plan, Nagendra adopted this suggestion, and sent for Kunda to acquaint her with the arrangement.  Champa accompanied Kunda. As they were coming, Kunda, seeing Nagendra from afar, suddenly stood still like one stunned. Her feet refused to move; she stood looking at him with eyes full of astonishment.  Champa asked, \"Why do you stand thus?\"  Kunda, pointing with her finger, said, \"It is he!\"  \"He! Who?\" said Champa.  \"He whom last night my mother pictured in the heavens.\"  Then Champa also stood frightened and astonished. Seeing that the girls shrank from approaching, Nagendra came near and explained everything. Kunda was unable to reply; she could only gaze with eyes full of surprise.     CHAPTER III.  OF MANY SUBJECTS.   Reluctantly did Nagendra Natha take Kunda with him to Calcutta. On arriving there he made much search for her aunt's husband, but he found no one in Sham Bazar named Binod Ghosh. He found a Binod Das, who admitted no relationship. Thus Kunda remained as a burthen upon Nagendra.  Nagendra had one sister, younger than himself, named Kamal Mani, whose father-in-law's house was in Calcutta. Her husband's name was Srish Chandra Mittra. Srish Babu was accountant in the house of Plunder, Fairly, and Co. It was a great house, and Srish Chandra was wealthy. He was much attached to his brother-in-law. Nagendra took Kunda Nandini thither, and imparted her story to Kamal Mani.  Kamal was about eighteen years of age. In features she resembled Nagendra; both brother and sister were very handsome. But, in addition to her beauty, Kamal was famed for her learning. Nagendra's father, engaging an English teacher, had had Kamal Mani and Surja Mukhi well instructed. Kamal's mother-in-law was living, but she dwelt in Srish Chandra's ancestral home. In Calcutta Kamal Mani was house-mistress.  When he had finished the story of Kunda Nandini, Nagendra said, \"Unless you will keep her here, there is no place for her. Later, when I return home, I will take her to Govindpur with me.\"  Kamal was very mischievous. When Nagendra had turned away, she snatched up Kunda in her arms and ran off with her. A tub of not very hot water stood in an adjoining room, and suddenly Kamal threw Kunda into it. Kunda was quite frightened. Then Kamal, laughing, took some scented soap and proceeded to wash Kunda. An attendant, seeing Kamal thus employed, bustled up, saying, \"I will do it! I will do it!\" but Kamal, sprinkling some of the hot water over the woman, sent her running away. Kamal having bathed and rubbed Kunda, she appeared like a dew-washed lotus. Then Kamal, having robed her in a beautiful white garment, dressed her hair with scented oil, and decorated her with ornaments, said to her: \"Now go and salute the _Dada Babu_ (elder brother), and return, but mind you do not thus to the master of the house: if he should see you he will want to marry you.\"  Nagendra Natha wrote Kunda's history to Surja Mukhi. Also when writing to an intimate friend of his living at a distance, named Hara Deb Ghosal, he spoke of Kunda in the following terms:  \"Tell me what you consider to be the age of beauty in woman. You will say after forty, because your Brahmini is a year or two more than that. The girl Kunda, whose history I have given you, is thirteen. On looking at her, it seems as if that were the age of beauty. The sweetness and simplicity that precede the budding-time of youth are never seen afterwards. This Kunda's simplicity is astonishing; she understands nothing. To-day she even wished to run into the streets to play with the boys. On being forbidden, she was much frightened, and desisted. Kamal is teaching her, and says she shows much aptitude in learning, but she does not understand other things. For instance, her large blue eyes--eyes swimming ever like the autumn lotus in clear water--these two eyes may be fixed upon my face, but they say nothing. I lose my senses gazing on them; I cannot explain better. You will laugh at this history of my mental stability; but if I could place you in front of those eyes, I should see what your firmness is worth. Up to this time I have been unable to determine what those eyes are like. I have not seen them look twice the same; I think there are no other such eyes in the world, they seem as if they scarcely saw the things of earth, but were ever seeking something in space. It is not that Kunda is faultlessly beautiful. Her features, if compared with those of many others, would not be highly praised; yet I think I never saw such rare beauty. It is as if there were in Kunda Nandini something not of this world, as though she were not made of flesh and blood, but of moonbeams and the scent of flowers. Nothing presents itself to my mind at this moment to which to liken her. Incomparable being! her whole person seems to breathe peace. If in some clear pool you have observed the sheen produced by the rays of the autumn moon, you have seen something resembling her. I can think of no other simile.\"  Surja Mukhi's reply to Nagendra's letter came in a few days. It was after this manner:  \"I know not what fault your servant has committed. If it is necessary you should stay so long in Calcutta, why am I not with you to attend upon you? This is my earnest wish; the moment I receive your consent, I will set out.  \"In picking up a little girl, have you forgotten me? Many unripe things are esteemed. People like green guavas, and green cucumbers; green cocoa-nuts are cooling.

On the hither side of the Popham house, and quite obscured by it, stood Letitia Boynton's one-story gray cottage. It had a clump of tall cedar trees for background and the bare branches of the elms in front were hung lightly with snow garlands. As Mrs. Larrabee came closer, she set down her lantern and looked fixedly at the familiar house as if something new arrested her gaze.  \"It looks like a little night-light!\" she thought. \"And how queer of Letty to be sitting at the open window!\"  Nearer still she crept, yet not so near as to startle her friend. A tall brass candlestick, with a lighted tallow candle in it, stood on the table in the parlor window; but the room in which Letty sat was unlighted save by the fire on the hearth, which gleamed brightly behind the quaint andirons--Hessian soldiers of iron, painted in gay colors. Over the mantel hung the portrait of Letty's mother, a benign figure clad in black silk, the handsome head topped by a snowy muslin cap with floating strings. Just round the corner of the fireplace was a half-open door leading into a tiny bedroom, and the flickering flame lighted the heads of two sleeping children, arms interlocked, bright tangled curls flowing over one pillow.  Letty herself sat in a low chair by the open window wrapped in an old cape of ruddy brown homespun, from the folds of which her delicate head rose like a flower in a bouquet of autumn leaves. One elbow rested on the table; her chin in the cup of her hand. Her head was turned away a little so that one could see only the knot of bronze hair, the curve of a cheek, and the sweep of an eyelash.  \"What a picture!\" thought Reba. \"The very thing for my Christmas card! It would do almost without a change, if only she is willing to let me use her.\"  \"Wake up, Letty!\" she called. \"Come and let me in!--Why, your front door isn't closed!\"  \"The fire smoked a little when I first lighted it,\" said Letty, rising when her friend entered, and then softly shutting the bedroom door that the children might not waken. \"The night is so mild and the room so warm, I couldn't help opening the window to look at the moon on the snow. Sit down, Reba! How good of you to come when you've been rehearsing for the Christmas Tree exercises all the afternoon.\"     [Illustration]  II   \"It's never 'good' of me to come to talk with you, Letty!\" And the minister's wife sank into a comfortable seat and took off her rigolette. \"Enough virtue has gone out of me to-day to Christianize an entire heathen nation! Oh! how I wish Luther would go and preach to a tribe of cannibals somewhere, and make me superintendent of the Sabbath-School! How I should like to deal, just for a change, with some simple problem like the undesirability and indigestibility involved in devouring your next-door neighbor! Now I pass my life in saying, 'Love your neighbor as yourself'; which is far more difficult than to say, 'Don't _eat_ your neighbor, it's such a disgusting habit,--and wrong besides,'--though I dare say they do it half the time because the market is bad. The first thing I'd do would be to get my cannibals to raise sheep. If they ate more mutton, they wouldn't eat so many missionaries.\"  Letty laughed. \"You're so funny, Reba dear, and I was so sad before you came in. Don't let the minister take you to the cannibals until after I die!\"  \"No danger!--Letty, do you remember I told you I'd been trying my hand on some verses for a Christmas card?\"  \"Yes; have you sent them anywhere?\"  \"Not yet. I couldn't think of the right decoration and color scheme and was afraid to trust it all to the publishers. Now I've found just what I need for one of them, and you gave it to me, Letty!\"  \"I?\"  \"Yes, you; to-night, as I came down the road. The house looked so quaint, backed by the dark cedars, and the moon and the snow made everything dazzling. I could see the firelight through the open window, the Hessian soldier andirons, your mother's portrait, the children asleep in the next room, and you, wrapped in your cape waiting or watching for something or somebody.\"  \"I wasn't watching or waiting! I was dreaming,\" said Letty hurriedly.  \"You looked as if you were watching, anyway, and I thought if I were painting the picture I would call it 'Expectancy,' or 'The Vigil,' or 'Sentry Duty.' However, when I make you into a card, Letty, nobody will know what the figure at the window means, till they read my verses.\"  \"I'll give you the house, the room, the andirons, and even mother's portrait, but you don't mean that you want to put _me_ on the card?\" And Letty turned like a startled deer as she rose and brushed a spark from the hearth-rug.  \"No, not the whole of you, of course, though I'm not clever enough to get a likeness even if I wished. I merely want to make a color sketch of your red-brown cape, your hair that matches it, your ear, an inch of cheek, and the eyelashes of one eye, if you please, ma'am.\"  \"That doesn't sound quite so terrifying.\" And Letty looked more manageable.  \"Nobody'll ever know that a real person sat at a real window and that I saw her there; but when I send the card with a finished picture, and my verses beautifully lettered on it, the printing people will be more likely to accept it.\"  \"And if they do, shall I have a dozen to give to my Bible-class?\" asked Letty in a wheedling voice.  \"You shall have more than that! I'm willing to divide my magnificent profits with you. You will have furnished the picture and I the verses. It's wonderful, Letty,--it's providential! You just _are_ a Christmas card to-night! It seems so strange that you even put the lighted candle in the window when you never heard my verse. The candle caught my eye first, and I remembered the Christmas customs we studied for the church festival,--the light to guide the Christ Child as he walks through the dark streets on the Eve of Mary.\"  \"Yes, I thought of that,\" said Letty, flushing a little. \"I put the candle there first so that the house shouldn't be all dark when the Pophams went by to choir-meeting, and just then I--I remembered, and was glad I did it!\"  \"These are my verses, Letty.\" And Reba's voice was soft as she turned her face away and looked at the flames mounting upward in the chimney:--      My door is on the latch to-night,       The hearth fire is aglow.     I seem to hear swift passing feet,--       The Christ Child in the snow.      My heart is open wide to-night       For stranger, kith or kin.     I would not bar a single door       Where Love might enter in!  There was a moment's silence and Letty broke it. \"It means the sort of love the Christ Child brings, with peace and good-will in it. I'm glad to be a part of that card, Reba, so long as nobody knows me, and--\"  Here she made an impetuous movement and, covering her eyes with her hands, burst into a despairing flood of confidence, the words crowding each other and tumbling out of her mouth as if they feared to be stopped.  \"After I put the candle on the table ... I could not rest for thinking ... I wasn't ready in my soul to light the Christ Child on his way ... I was bitter and unresigned ... It is three years to-night since the children were born ... and each year I have hoped and waited and waited and hoped, thinking that David might remember. David! my brother, their father! Then the fire on the hearth, the moon and the snow quieted me, and I felt that I wanted to open the door, just a little. No one will notice that it's ajar, I thought, but there's a touch of welcome in it, anyway. And after a few minutes I said to myself: 'It's no use, David won't come; but I'm glad the firelight shines on mother's picture, for he loved mother, and if she hadn't died when he was scarcely more than a boy, things might have been different.... The reason I opened the bedroom door--something I never do when the babies are asleep--was because I needed a sight of their faces to reconcile me to my duty and take the resentment out of my heart ... and it did flow out, Reba,--out into the stillness. It is so dazzling white outside, I couldn't bear my heart to be shrouded in gloom!\"  \"Poor Letty!\" And Mrs. Larrabee furtively wiped away a tear. \"How long since you have heard? I didn't dare ask.\"  \"Not a word, not a line for nearly three months, and for the half-year before that it was nothing but a note, sometimes with a five-dollar bill enclosed. David seems to think it the natural thing for me to look after his children; as if there could be no question of any life of my own.\"  \"You began wrong, Letty. You were born a prop and you've been propping somebody ever since.\"  \"I've done nothing but my plain duty. When my mother died there was my stepfather to nurse, but I was young and strong; I didn't mind; and he wasn't a burden long, poor father. Then, after four years came the shock of David's reckless marriage. When he asked if he might bring that girl here until her time of trial was over, it seemed to me I could never endure it! But there were only two of us left, David and I; I thought of mother and said yes.\"  \"I remember, Letty; I had come to Beulah then.\"  \"Yes, and you know what Eva was. How David, how anybody, could have loved her, I cannot think! Well, he brought her, and you know how it turned out. David never saw her alive again, nor ever saw his babies after they were three days old. Still, what can you expect of a father who is barely twenty-one?\"  \"If he's old enough to have children, he's old enough to notice them,\" said Mrs. Larrabee with her accustomed spirit. \"Somebody ought to jog his sense of responsibility. It's wrong for women to assume men's burdens beyond a certain point; it only makes them more selfish. If you only knew where David is, you ought to bundle the children up and"]]]
