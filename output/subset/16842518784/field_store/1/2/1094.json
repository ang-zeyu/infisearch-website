Value for planting: The hemlock makes an excellent hedge because it     retains its lowest branches and will stand shearing. In this respect     it is preferable to the spruce. It makes a fair tree for the lawn     and is especially desirable for underplanting in woodlands, where     the shade from the surrounding trees is heavy. In this respect it is     like the beech.  Commercial value: The wood is soft, brittle, and coarse-grained, and is     therefore used mainly for coarse lumber. Its bark is so rich in     tannin that it forms one of the chief commercial products of the     tree.  Other characters: The _fruit_ is a small cone about ¾ of an inch long,     which generally hangs on the tree all winter.  [Illustration: FIG. 10.--Twig of the Hemlock.]    GROUP III. THE RED CEDAR AND ARBOR-VITAE  How to tell them from other trees: The red cedar (juniper) and     arbor-vitae may be told from other trees by their _leaves_, which     remain on the tree and keep green throughout the entire year. These     leaves differ from those of the other evergreens in being much     shorter and of a distinctive shape as shown in Figs. 12 and 13. The     trees themselves are much smaller than the other evergreens     enumerated in this book. Altogether, there are thirty-five species     of juniper recognized and four of arbor-vitae. The junipers are     widely distributed over the northern hemisphere, from the Arctic     region down to Mexico in the New World, and in northern Africa,     China, and Japan in the Old World. The arbor-vitae is found in     northeastern and northwestern America, China, and Japan. The species     mentioned here are those commonly found in America.  How to tell them from each other: The _twigs_ of the arbor-vitae are     _flat and fan-like_ as in Fig. 13; the twigs of the red cedar are     _needle-shaped or scale-like_ as in Fig. 12. The foliage of the     arbor-vitae is of a lighter color than that of the red cedar, which     is sombre green. The arbor-vitae will generally be found growing in     moist locations, while the red cedar will grow in dry places as     well. The arbor-vitae generally retains its lower branches in open     places, while the branches of the red cedar start at some distance     from the ground.   RED CEDAR (_Juniperus virginiana_)  [Illustration: FIG. 11.--The Red Cedar.]  Distinguishing characters: The tree can best be told at a glance by its     general form, size and leaves. It is a medium-sized tree with a     _symmetrical, cone-like form_, Fig. 11, which, however, broadens     out somewhat when the tree grows old. Its color throughout the year     is dull green with a tinge of brownish red, and its bark peels in     thin strips.  [Illustration: FIG. 12(a).--Twig of Young Cedar. FIG. 12(b).--Twig of Cedar (Older Tree).]  Leaf: In young trees the leaf is needle-shaped, pointed, and marked by a     white line on its under side, Fig. 12(a). In older trees it is     scale-like, Fig. 12(b), and the white line on its under side is     indistinct.  Range: Widely distributed over nearly all of eastern and central North     America.  Soil and location: Grows on poor, gravelly soils as well as in rich     bottom lands.  Enemies: The \"_cedar apple_,\" commonly found on this tree, represents a     stage of the apple rust, and for that reason it is not desirable to     plant such trees near orchards. Its wood is also sometimes attacked     by small _boring insects_.  Value for planting: Its characteristic slender form gives the red cedar     an important place as an ornamental tree, but its chief value lies     in its commercial use.  Commercial value: The wood is durable, light, smooth and fragrant, and     is therefore used for making lead-pencils, cabinets, boxes,     moth-proof chests, shingles, posts, and telegraph poles.  Other characters: The _fruit_ is small, round and berry-like, about the     size of a pea, of dark blue color, and carries from one to four bony     seeds.  Other common names: The red cedar is also often called _juniper_ and     _red juniper_.  Comparisons: The red cedar is apt to be confused with the _low juniper_     (_Juniperus communis_) which grows in open fields all over the     world. The latter, however, is generally of a low form with a flat     top. Its leaves are pointed and prickly, never scale-like, and they     are whitish above and green below. Its bark shreds and its fruit is     a small round berry of agreeable aromatic odor.   ARBOR-VITAE; NORTHERN WHITE CEDAR (_Thuja occidentalis_)  Distinguishing characters: The *branchlets* are extremely *flat and     fan-like*, Fig. 13, and have an agreeable _aromatic odor_ when     bruised. The tree is an evergreen with a _narrow conical form_.  [Illustration: FIG. 13.--Twig of the Arbor-vitae.]  Leaf: Leaves of two kinds, one scale-like and flat, the other keeled,     all tightly pressed to the twig (see Fig. 13).  Form and size: A close, conical head with dense foliage near the base.     Usually a small tree, but in some parts of the northeastern States     it grows to medium size with a diameter of two feet.  Range: Northern part of North America.  Soil and location: Inhabits low, swampy lands; in the State of Maine     often forming thick forests.  Enemies: Very seldom affected by insects.  Value for planting: Is hardy in New England, where it is especially used     for hedges. It is also frequently used as a specimen tree on the     lawn.  Commercial value: The wood is durable for posts, ties, and shingles. The     bark contains considerable tannin and the juices from the tree have     a medicinal value.  Other characters: The _fruit_ is a cone about ½ inch long.  Other common names: Arbor-vitae is sometimes called _white cedar_ and     _cedar_.  Comparisons: The arbor-vitae is apt to be confused with the true _white     cedar_ (_Chamaecyparis thyoides_) but the leaves of the latter are     sharp-pointed and not flattened or fan-shaped.     CHAPTER II  HOW TO IDENTIFY TREES--(Continued)    GROUP IV. THE LARCH AND CYPRESS  How to tell them from other trees: In summer the larch and cypress may     easily be told from other trees by their _leaves_. These are     needle-shaped and arranged in clusters with numerous leaves to each     cluster in the case of the larch, and feathery and flat in the case     of the cypress. In winter, when their leaves have dropped off, the     trees can be told by their cones, which adhere to the branches.      There are nine recognized species of larch and two of bald cypress.     The larch is characteristically a northern tree, growing in the     northern and mountainous regions of the northern hemisphere from the     Arctic circle to Pennsylvania in the New World, and in Central     Europe, Asia, and Japan in the Old World. It forms large forests in     the Alps of Switzerland and France.      The European larch and not the American is the principal species     considered here, because it is being planted extensively in this     country and in most respects is preferable to the American species.      The bald cypress is a southern tree of ancient origin, the     well-known cypress of Montezuma in the gardens of Chepultepec having     been a species of Taxodium. The tree is now confined to the swamps     and river banks of the South Atlantic and Gulf States, where it     often forms extensive forests to the exclusion of all other trees.     In those regions along the river swamps, the trees are often     submerged for several months of the year.  How to tell them from each other: In summer the larch may be told from     the cypress by its leaves (compare Figs. 14 and 16). In winter the     two can be distinguished by their characteristic forms. The larch is     a broader tree as compared with the cypress and its form is more     conical. The cypress is more slender and it is taller. The two have     been grouped together in this study because they are both coniferous     trees and, unlike the other Conifers, are both deciduous, their     leaves falling in October.  [Illustration: FIG. 14.--Twig of the Larch in Summer.]   THE EUROPEAN LARCH (_Larix europaea_)  Distinguishing characters: Its leaves, which are needle-shaped and about     an inch long, are borne in *clusters* close to the twig, Fig. 14.     There are many leaves to each cluster. This characteristic together     with the *spire-like* form of the crown will distinguish the tree at     a glance.  Leaf: The leaves are of a light-green color but become darker in the     spring and in October turn yellow and drop off. The cypress, which     is described below, is another cone-bearing tree which sheds its     leaves in winter.  [Illustration: FIG. 15.--Twig of the Larch in Winter.]  Form and size: A medium-sized tree with a conical head and a straight     and tapering trunk. (See Fig. 90.)  Range: Central Europe and eastern and central United States.  Soil and location: Requires a deep, fresh, well-drained soil and needs     plenty of light. It flourishes in places where our native species     would die. Grows very rapidly.  Enemies: The larch is subject to the attacks of a _sawfly_, which has     killed many trees of the American species. A _fungus_ (_Trametes     pini_) which causes the tree to break down with ease is another of     its enemies.  Value for planting: A well-formed tree for the lawn. It is also useful     for group planting in the forest.  Commercial value: Because its wood is strong and durable the larch is     valuable for poles, posts, railroad ties, and in shipbuilding.  [Illustration: FIG. 16.--Twig of the Cypress.]  Other characters: The _fruit_ is a small cone about one inch long,     adhering to the tree throughout the winter.  [Illustration: FIG. 17.--The Bald Cypress.]  Comparisons: The tree is apt to be confused with the _American larch_,     also known as _tamarack_ and _hackmatack_, but differs from it in     having longer leaves, cones twice"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16121"],["title","Brothers of Pity and Other Tales of Beasts and Men (#1)"],["body"," floor.\"  I took it up in my arms and carried it sorrowfully to Godfather Gilpin. He was very kind, and said it was not hurt, and I might go on playing with the others; but I could see him stroking its brown leather and gold back, as if it had been bruised and wanted comforting, and I was far too sorry about it to go on preaching, even if I had had anything to preach.  I picked up the smallest book I could see in the congregation, and sat down and pretended to read. There were pictures in it, but I turned over a great many, one after the other, before I could see any of them, my eyes were so full of tears of mortification and regret. The first picture I saw when my tears had dried up enough to let me see was a very curious one indeed. It was a picture of two men carrying what looked like another man covered with a blue quilt, on a sort of bier. But the funny part about it was the dress of the men. They were wrapped up in black cloaks, and had masks over their faces, and underneath the picture was written, \"_Fratelli della Misericordia_\"--\"Brothers of Pity.\"  I do not know whether the accident to Jeremy Taylor had made Godfather Gilpin too anxious about his books to sleep, but I found that he was keeping awake, and after a bit he said to me, \"What are you staring so hard and so quietly at, little Mouse?\"  I looked at the back of the book, and it was called _Religious Orders_; so I said, \"It's called _Religious Orders_, but the picture I'm looking at has got two men dressed in black, with their faces covered all but their eyes, and they are carrying another man with something blue over him.\"  \"_Fratelli della Misericordia_,\" said Godfather Gilpin.  \"Who are they, and what are they doing?\" I asked. \"And why are their faces covered?\"  \"They belong to a body of men,\" was Godfather Gilpin's reply, \"who bind themselves to be ready in their turn to do certain offices of mercy, pity, and compassion to the sick, the dying, and the dead. The brotherhood is six hundred years old, and still exists. The men who belong to it receive no pay, and they equally reject the reward of public praise, for they work with covered faces, and are not known even to each other. Rich men and poor men, noble men and working men, men of letters and the ignorant, all belong to it, and each takes his turn when it comes round to nurse the sick, carry the dying to hospital, and bury the dead.'  \"Is that a dead man under the blue coverlet?\" I asked with awe.  \"I suppose so,\" said Godfather Gilpin.  \"But why don't his friends go to the funeral?\" I inquired.  \"He has no friends to follow him,\" said my godfather. \"That is why he is being buried by the Brothers of Pity.\"  Long after Godfather Gilpin had told me all that he could tell me of the _Fratelli della Misericordia_--long after I had put the congregation (including the _Religious Orders_ and Taylor's _Sermons_) back into the shelf to which they belonged--the masked faces and solemn garb of the men in the picture haunted me.  I have changed my mind a great many times, since I can remember, about what I will be when I am grown up. Sometimes I have thought I should like to be an officer and die in battle; sometimes I settled to be a clergyman and preach splendid sermons to enormous congregations; once I quite decided to be a head fireman and wear a brass helmet, and be whirled down lighted streets at night, every one making way for me, on errands of life and death.  But the history of the Brothers of Pity put me out of conceit with all other heroes. It seemed better than anything I had ever thought of--to do good works unseen of men, without hope of reward, and to those who could make no return. For it rang in my ears that Godfather Gilpin had said, \"He has no friends--that is why he is being buried by the Brothers of Pity.\"  I quite understood what I thought they must feel, because I had once buried a cat who had no friends. It was a poor half-starved old thing, for the people it belonged to had left it, and I used to see it slinking up to the back door and looking at Tabby, who was very fat and sleek, and at the scraps on the unwashed dishes after dinner. Mrs. Jones kicked it out every time, and what happened to it before I found it lying draggled and dead at the bottom of the Ha-ha, with the top of a kettle still fastened to its scraggy tail, I never knew, and it cost me bitter tears to guess. It cost me some hard work, too, to dig the grave, for my spade was so very small.  I don't think Mrs. Jones would have cared to be a Brother of Pity, for she was very angry with me for burying that cat, because it was such a wretched one, and so thin and dirty, and looked so ugly and smelt so nasty. But that was just why I wanted to give it a good funeral, and why I picked my crimson lily and put it in the grave, because it seemed so sad the poor thing should be like that when it might have been clean and fluffy, and fat and comfortable, like Tabby, if it had had a home and people to look after it.  It was remembering about the cat that made me think that there were no Brothers of Pity (not even in Tuscany, for I asked Godfather Gilpin) to bury beasts and birds and fishes when they have no friends to go to their funerals. And that was how it was that I settled to be a Brother of Pity without waiting till I grew up and could carry men.  I had a shilling of my own, and with sixpence of it I bought a yard and a half of black calico at the post-office shop, and Mrs. Jones made me a cloak out of it; and with the other sixpence I bought a mask--for they sell toys there too. It was not a right sort of mask, but I could not make Mrs. Jones understand about a hood with two eye-holes in it, and I did not like to show her the picture, for if she had seen that I wanted to play at burying people, perhaps she would not have made me the cloak. She made it very well, and it came down to my ankles, and I could hide my spade under it. The worst of the mask was that it was a funny one, with a big nose; but it hid my face all the same, and when you get inside a mask you can feel quite grave whatever it's painted like.  I had never had so happy a summer before as the one when I was a Brother of Pity. I heard Nurse saying to Mrs. Jones that \"there was no telling what would keep children out of mischief,\" for that I \"never seemed to be tired of that old black rag and that ridiculous face.\"  But it was not the dressing-up that pleased me day after day, it was the chance of finding dead bodies with no friends to bury them. Going out is quite a new thing when you have something to look for; and Godfather Gilpin says he felt just the same in the days when he used to collect insects.  I found a good many corpses of one sort and another: birds and mice and frogs and beetles, and sometimes bigger bodies--such as kittens and dogs. The stand of my old wooden horse made a capital thing to drag them on, for all the wheels were there, and I had a piece of blue cotton-velvet to put on the top, but the day I found a dead mole I did not cover him. I put him outside, and he looked like black velvet lying on blue velvet. It seemed quite a pity to put him into the dirty ground, with such a lovely coat.  One day I was coming back from burying a mouse, and I saw a \"flying watchman\" beetle lying quite stiff and dead, as I thought, with his legs stretched out, and no friends; so I put him on the bier at once, and put the blue velvet over him, and drew him to the place where the mouse's grave was. When I took the pall off and felt him, and turned him over and over, he was still quite rigid, so I felt sure he was dead, and began to dig his grave; but when I had finished and went back to the bier, the flying watchman was just creeping over the wheel. He had only pretended to be dead, and had given me all that trouble for nothing.  When first I became a Brother of Pity, I thought I would have a graveyard to bury all the creatures in, but afterwards I changed my mind and settled to bury them all near wherever I found them. But I got some bits of white wood, and fastened them across each other with bits of wire, and so marked every grave.  At last there were lots of them dotted about the fields and woods I knew. I remembered to whom most of them belonged, and even if I had forgotten, it made a very good game, to pretend to be a stranger in the neighbourhood, and then pretend to be somebody else, talking to myself, and saying, \"Wherever you see those little graves some poor creature has been buried by the Brothers of Pity.\"  I did not like to read the burial service, for fear it should not be quite right (especially for frogs; there were so many of them in summer, and they were so horrid-looking, I used to bury several together, and pretend it was the time of the plague); but I did not like not having any service at all. So when I put on my cloak and mask, and took my spade and the bier, I said, \"Brothers, let us prepare to perform this work of mercy,\" which is the first thing the real _Fratelli della Misericordia_ say when they are going out. And when I buried the body I said, \"Go in peace,\" which is the last thing that they say. Godfather Gilpin told me, and I learnt it by heart.  I enjoyed it very much. There were graves of beasts and birds who had died without friends in the hedges and the soft parts of the fields in almost all our walks. I never showed them to Nurse, but I often wondered that she did not notice them. I always touched my hat when I passed them, and sometimes it was very difficult to do so without her seeing me, but it made me quite uncomfortable if I passed a grave without. When I could not find any bodies I amused myself with making wreaths to hang over particularly nice poor beasts, such as a bullfinch or a kitten.  I had been a Brother of Pity for several months, when a very curious thing happened.  One summer evening I went by myself after tea into a steep little field at the back of our house, with an old stone-quarry at the top,"]]]
