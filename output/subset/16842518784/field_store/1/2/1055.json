If you had seen the owner of the little voice, perhaps you would not have thought him any thing remarkable.  It is true he had on a clean white coat, so smooth and shining that it looked as if it had been newly starched and ironed, and inside of this, he hugged two stout packages.  The coat had only one fastening; but that fastening extended down the back, and was a curious thing to see.  It looked just as if the coat had been cut with a knife, and had afterward grown together again. It was like a scar on your hand; and a scar it is called.  \"Yes, I ought to be growing,\" said the little voice, \"for I am a bean, and in the spring a bean ought to grow.\"  Now you know how the coat came by its scar, for the scar was the spot which showed where the bean had been broken from the pod.  \"What do you mean by growing?\" said the other voice, which came from a large red stone.  \"Why,\" said the bean, \"don't you know what growing means? I thought every thing knew how to grow. You see, when I grow, my root goes down into the soil to get moisture, and my stem goes up into the light to find heat. Heat and moisture are my food and drink.  \"By and by, I shall be a full-grown plant, and that is wonderful! In the ground, my roots will travel far and wide.  \"In the air, how happy my stem will be! I shall learn a great deal, and see beautiful things every day. O how I long for that time to come!\"  \"What you say is very strange,\" said the red stone. \"Here I have been in this same place for many years, and I have not grown at all. I have no root; I have no stem; or, if I have, they never move upward nor downward, as you say. Are you sure you are not mistaken?\"  \"Why, of course I'm not mistaken,\" cried the bean. \"I feel within myself that I can grow; and I have absorbed so much moisture that I must soon begin.\"  Just then the bean's coat split from end to end, and for one or two minutes neither the stone nor the bean spoke. The stone was astonished, and the bean was a little frightened. However, he soon recovered his courage.  \"There!\" said he, showing the two packages he had been carrying; \"these are my seed-leaves. In them is the food on which I intend to live when I begin growing.  \"When my stem is strong enough to do without them, they will wither away. My coat is all worn-out, too. I shall not need it any longer. Look inside the seed-leaves, and you will see the germ. Part of it is root, and part of it is stem. Do you see?\"  \"I see two little white lumps,\" replied the stone; \"but I can not understand how they will ever be a root and a stem.\"  \"I do believe you are a poor, dull mineral, after all,\" said the bean; \"and if so, of course you can not understand what pleasure a vegetable has in growing.  \"I wouldn't be a mineral for the world! I would not lie still and do nothing, year after year. I would rather spread my branches in the sunshine, and drink in the sweet spring air through my leaves.\"  \"What you say must be all nonsense,\" said the stone. \"I can't understand it.\"  But the bean grew on without minding him. The roots pushed down into the soil and drank up the moisture from the ground. Then this moisture went into the stem, and the stem climbed bravely up into the light.  \"How happy I am!\" cried the bean.  It ran over the red stone, and clasped it with long green branches, covered with white bean flowers.  \"O indeed!\" said the stone. \"Is this what you call growing? I thought you were only in fun. How handsome you are!\"  \"May I hang my pods on you, so that they can ripen in the sun?\" said the bean.  \"Certainly, friend,\" said the stone.  He was very polite, now that he saw the bean was a full-grown vine.          *       *       *       *       *   Directions for Reading.--Read in a conversational tone of voice, as in Lessons I and II.

He was too young--this little elf--   With troublesome questions to vex himself;   But for many days a thought would rise,   And bring a shade to the dancing eyes.    He went to one whom he thought more wise   Than any other beneath the skies:   \"Mother,\"--O word that makes the home!--   \"Tell me, when will to-morrow come?\"    \"It is almost night,\" the mother said,   \"And time for my boy to be in bed;   When you wake up and it's day again,   It will be to-morrow, my darling, then.\"    The little boy slept through all the night,   But woke with the first red streak of light;   He pressed a kiss on his mother's brow,   And whispered, \"Is it to-morrow now?\"    \"No, little Eddie, this is to-day;   To-morrow is always one night away.\"   He pondered awhile, but joys came fast,   And this vexing question quickly passed.    But it came again with the shades of night:   \"Will it be to-morrow when it is light?\"   From years to come, he seemed care to borrow,   He tried so hard to catch to-morrow.    \"You can not catch it, my little Ted;   Enjoy to-day,\" the mother said;   \"Some wait for to-morrow through many a year--   It always is coming, but never is here.\"          *       *       *       *       *   Directions for Reading.--In reading poetry, pupils should notice the emphatic words, and give them proper force.

PART I.   \"During the summer and winter, we had several adventures in the trapping and killing of wild animals. One of them was of such a singular and dangerous kind, that you may feel interested in hearing it.  \"It occurred in the dead of winter, when there was snow upon the ground. The lake was frozen over, and the ice was as smooth as glass. We spent much of our time in skating about over its surface, as the exercise gave us health and a good appetite.  \"Even Cudjo, our colored servant, had taken a fancy for this amusement, and was a very good skater. Frank was fonder of it than the rest of us, and was, in fact, the best skater among us.  \"One day, however, neither Cudjo nor I had gone out, but only Frank and Harry. The rest of us were busy at some carpenter work within doors.  \"We could hear the merry laugh of the boys, and the ring of their skates as they glided over the smooth ice. All at once, a cry reached our ears, which we knew meant the presence of some danger.  \"'O Robert!' cried my wife, 'they have broken through the ice!'  \"We all dropped what we held in our hands, and rushed to the door. I seized a rope as I ran, while Cudjo took his long spear, thinking it might be of use to us. This was the work of a moment, and the next we were outside the house.  \"What was our astonishment to see both the boys, away at the farthest end of the lake, but skating toward us as fast as they could!  \"At the same time, our eyes rested upon a terrible sight. Close behind them upon the ice, and following at full gallop, was a pack of wolves!  \"They were not the small prairie wolves, which either of the boys might have chased with a stick, but of a species known as the 'Great Dusky Wolf' of the Rocky Mountains.  \"There were six of them in all. Each of them was twice the size of the prairie wolf, and their long, dark bodies, gaunt with hunger, and crested from head to tail with a high, bristling mane, gave them a most fearful appearance.  \"They ran with their ears set back and their jaws apart, so that we could see their red tongues and white teeth.  \"We did not stop a moment, but rushed toward the lake. I threw down the rope, and seized hold of a large rail as I ran, while Cudjo hurried forward armed with a spear. My wife, with presence of mind, turned back into the house for my rifle.  \"I saw that Harry was foremost, and that the fierce wolves were fast closing upon Frank. This was strange, for we knew that Frank was by far the better skater. We all called out to him, uttering loud shouts of encouragement. Both were bearing themselves manfully, but Frank was most in danger.  \"The wolves were upon his heels! 'O they will kill him!' I cried, expecting the next moment to see him thrown down upon the ice. What was my joy at seeing him suddenly wheel and dart off in a new direction.\"          *       *       *       *       *   Directions for Reading.--This lesson should be read with spirit, and in a full, clear tone of voice.          *       *       *       *       *   Language Lesson.--_Presence of mind_ is the power to act quickly when sudden danger threatens.  _Upon his heels_ means very close to.  _Dead of winter_ is the middle of winter, as that is supposed to be the quietest or most lifeless time.

Gord-a-massy, whut am dis yere ol' worl' a-comin' to?  Ebery time ol' Mis' cry for young Massa Dick, Colonel say Job gobbles--\"  The old darky choked miserably at the thought of the destined check to Job's gobbling career and, replacing his spectacles, carefully carried in the supper, prolonging its simple service to the uttermost, with the single idea of adding precious minutes to the doomed turkey's span of life.  When at length he sought the barn it was quite dark and the velvet stillness of the night was dotted thickly with snowflakes.  With trembling fingers he opened the great barn-door, lit a queer old lantern hanging just within, and hung it high upon a projecting hook. The dim light revealed an antique carriage-house, in one corner of which upon a rude, improvised roost of shingles the tyrant Job slept the sleep of the just and the unjust rolled into one.  As the lights flickered upon his ruffled feathers the turkey emitted a throaty grunt of disapproval and moved cumbrously around to avoid the light.  Uncle Noah addressed him with great firmness.  \"Now see yere, Massa Job,\" he said, \"tain't no use yoh puttin' on yoh high and mighty airs to-night.  I'se come to interview yoh, sah!  Understand?\"  Job majestically tucked his head beneath his wing as if to intimate his indifference to the proposed interview.  Uncle Noah surveyed his ruffled back feathers with increased respect. \"So,\" he said, \"yoh refuse me an interview, Massa Job Fairfax.  Yoh is sleepy, sah, dat's whut's got into yoh.\"  He stroked the turkey with a gentle hand, and, Job, resenting the indignity, withdrew his head from the sheltering wing and pecked at the brown fingers, turning around with a stately movement and facing the light once more with a sleepy blink of his bright, beadlike eyes.  \"Now, sah, we can talk,\" exclaimed the negro in delight.  Drawing up an old box he seated himself before the roost and beamed benevolently over his glasses.  \"Colonel done say yoh gobble under de winder 'bout suppertime,\" he began confidentially.  \"When ol' Mis' cry 'bout young Massa Dick de Colonel he jus' gotta scold 'bout sumthin', and as yoh is de mos' important person about he jus' naturally selects yoh.\"  The turkey held his head upon one side, apparently in critical admiration of the darky's quaint old scarfpin which resembled a grain of corn mounted on a needle.  Uncle Noah, who had always had a faint mistrust of Job's attitude toward this ancient Ethiopian heirloom, promptly removed it to a place of safety.  Then with a sudden resolve that no thought of the coming tragedy should mar his last visit with his old companion he rose and sought a dim, cobwebby corner of the barn, whence he returned with a box.  \"Dese yere, Job,\" he explained, \"is de flowers whut young Massa Dick have sent to his mother ebery holiday since he done went away from yere.  Mornin', I specs, when de Colonel sees 'em at her plate, he'll declare yoh gobblin' sumthin' fierce under de winder again; he always do.\"  The old negro broke the string of the box and removed a glowing mass of purple orchids--odd, transient tenants of the crazy old barn.  Job suddenly reached over and pecked a blossom from its stem, ate the heart with the dainty air of an epicure, and discarded the remainder with a noise akin to a gobble of disgust.  Uncle Noah rose in scandalized protest.  \"Yoh good-foh-nothin', miserable, sassy turkey!\" he scolded, hastily removing the orchids; \"you sartinly is de mos' scan'lous, no-'count bird I ever knowed.  Eat one o' ol' Missus's orchards!  Laws-a-massy, Job, yoh goes mos' too far.  Now, sah, yoh be quiet and listen to dis note I gets from young Massa Dick,\" and he carefully deciphered the written lines for the listening Job.   _Dear Uncle Noah_: I have written Foster and Company as usual to send Mother's orchids.  They should get there Christmas Eve.  Will you put them at her plate in the morning?  I find they are the only suggestion of me that the Colonel will allow in the house.  I tried another letter this week, but it came back unopened.  Uncle Noah, give Mother \"A Merry Christmas\" for me.                 DICK.   [Illustration: Now, sah, yoh be quiet and listen to dis note I gets from young Massa Dick]   Uncle Noah laid the letter on his knee and drew from a worn leather wallet several newspaper clippings.  They were glowing reports, gleaned from a stray newspaper, of the success of a young architect in a distant northern city, one Richard Fairfax, Jr.  Uncle Noah proudly read them aloud for the hundredth time, interpolating little explanatory remarks to the turkey, who gobbled threateningly but failed to intimidate his tormentor.  \"Job, whut yoh think 'bout dis yere quarrel?\" Uncle Noah said as the turkey eyed him sternly.  \"I say de Colonel's too hard on de boy.  A quarrel's a quarrel, yoh say.  H'm, maybe yoh right, but it's dis Fairfax pride ob de Colonel's dat keep him from readin' de boy's letters, and nothin' else, sah.  He sorry for dat quarrel, doan you fo'get it.  But de Colonel he prouder'n Lucifer.  H'm, yoh say yoh understan' pride cause yoh is proud yohself.\"  Then as the turkey relapsed into slumber, \"Now, see yere, Massa Job, yoh ain't no mo' sleepier'n I is.\"  Uncle Noah poked the turkey with his finger, and Job arched his neck with a threatening flap of his wings and descended from his perch.  \"Fight me, will yoh?\" demanded Uncle Noah in secret delight, \"yoh is de touchiest bird!  Yere, fight wid dese yere crusts o' bread.\"  Job spread his tail magnificently and began an erratic consumption of the bread crusts, pertly taking them one by one from the old negro's hand and arranging them upon the barn floor for later and more personal inspection.  Uncle Noah watched him with misty eyes.  Presently his gaze furtively sought the rusty ax in the corner, and great tear rolled down his cheek.  Caught in the wave of a sudden panic he dropped upon his knees and clasped his trembling hands.  The dusky barn, littered with odds and ends, was dimly visible in the glimmering light of the old-fashioned lantern whose slanting rays fell upon the doomed bird and the praying negro.  No thought of sacrilege marred the quaint, halting prayer.  A terrible earnestness lined the negro's face with a holiness of purpose and made it beautiful.  \"Oh, Lord,\" he prayed, \"save dis yere ol' turkey gobbler.  I knows, Lord, he's a powahful wuthless bird, but he's all I'se got.  I'se jus' an' ol' slave, Massa, what's been free since de War, an' Job, sah, he understan's me.  Lord, I doan wanta live no mo' if I has to kill ol' Job.  Send me an inspiration, Lord, an' tell me how I can save his wuthless ol' hide.  Save him an'--an' God bless de Colonel!  Amen.\"  For an interval, in which the only sound was that of Job's feet as he strutted about seeking an edible successor to the bread, Uncle Noah remained upon his knees in the attitude of prayer, perhaps awaiting inspiration.  At length he rose, and, seating himself upon the box once more, buried his white head dejectedly in his hands.  The snow-flakes filtered slowly through a crevice at the side, heaping fantastically into a miniature drift.  Absently Uncle Noah watched them, his mind traveling back to many a snowy Christmas \"before the War.\"  Suddenly his brown face glowed with radiance and he drew a long breath of relief.  \"Job,\" he said, leaning forward and patting the turkey, \"I has it! Yoh'd scarcely believe it, sah, but I'se a-goin' to save yoh.\"  He arose transformed, the despondent droop of his lean body replaced by an alert energy.  \"Now, Job,\" he coaxed, \"I jus' wants yoh foh to come along wif me peaceable, sah.  I'se after yoh to save yoh ol' hide from de Christmas platter.\"  But Job, with a malicious enjoyment of the game, was prancing wildly about the barn, flapping his wings in hysterical derision of his breathless pursuer.  Brought to bay he squawked a protest and struggled violently as Uncle Noah unceremoniously imprisoned him beneath one arm.  \"There, sah,\" exclaimed the negro triumphantly, \"I has yoh!  Yoh is sartinly the mos' wuthless turkey on dis yere plantation.\"  Tightly clasping the outraged tyrant Uncle Noah tiptoed to the lantern and blew it out.  Then stumbling across the floor he stealthily left the barn and set out across the snowy fields to a tumble-down shanty, sole survivor of a string of negro huts long since burned one by one in the library fireplace.  Into its dilapidated interior he thrust the protesting turkey, pausing at the door as he struck a match to view the bird's temporary quarters.  \"Now, Massa Job Fairfax,\" he began, \"I knows yoh is jus' mad clean through.  Yoh jus' naturally objects to bein' toted out in de snow in de middle o' de turkey night 'thout bein' asked.  Yoh says yoh back is full o' snow?  Well, I jus' asks yoh, Massa Job Fairfax, ain't dat better'n bein' wifout a head?  Now, sah, I asks yoh to be mos' terrible quiet dis yere night.  I'se a-goin' into Cotesville on a little trip an' I doan want de Colonel to know yoh here.\"  He closed the rickety door, and, hurrying back across the fields, sought the kitchen, his eyes behind their spectacles shining with excitement.  Muffling himself in a quaint red knitted scarf, a dingy overcoat and a worn fur cap, plentifully earlapped, he left the house again, pausing only long enough to peer through the library window at the Colonel, who was reading aloud to his wife, both drawn up in the cheery warmth of a blazing wood fire.  Then he hurried on along the road to town.  With a prayer in his heart for the success of his mission Uncle Noah trudged sturdily down the two miles to Cotesville, past Major Verney's old plantation, the cheery lights of the great house twinkling brightly through a curtain of snow, and into the snow-laden air of the village streets alive with Christmas shoppers.
