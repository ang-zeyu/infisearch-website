I knows it, I knows it, and I will pound 'em all up when I gits home.\"  Looking about his person, he found that one of the hooks, catching in his clothes, had brought the line to shore; and, as his involuntary bath had not really been unpleasant, he was able to continue his labor. But, before going out upon the tree he examined the roots to satisfy himself that no further mischief had been perpetrated by his hopeful sons.  Feeling assured upon this point, he again passed out on the tree, and was soon engaged in fishing as before, totally unmindful of the broad grins of the delighted Shawnees who had witnessed his discomfiture.  The fish bit readily.  In a short time he had taken enough to insure him a welcome reception in his own wigwam.  He was debating with himself whether it would not be better to return, especially as his pipe had been extinguished by his immersion, when a piece of bark floated down toward him and caught against his line.  There certainly was nothing remarkable in this.  After freeing it of the obstruction, he continued fishing.  But, scarcely a minute had elapsed before a second and a third piece of bark, precisely like the first, lodged against his line, and remained there with such persistency that it required considerable effort upon his part to remove them.  \"Where in dunderation did dey come from?\" he asked, looking inquiringly about him.  His first impression was that the Shawnees along the banks were throwing these pieces out into the river for the purpose of annoying him; but, on looking toward them, he could discover nothing in their appearance to warrant such a supposition.  He turned elsewhere for the cause.  Resuming his attention to his line, he found several other pieces passing beneath him, and he began now to feel really provoked at this repeated annoyance.  He was about to break out into some exclamation, when the appearance of these floating objects arrested his attention.  A glance showed him there was something meant more than mere mischief.  The pieces of bark were of a peculiar construction, roughly cut into the shape of an Indian canoe, showing unmistakably that they were sent down the stream for the purpose of arresting his notice.  \"Dat means something,\" exclaimed Hans, decidedly, \"and I must find out what it is.\"  By simply looking up-stream, he could discern this fleet of miniature boats coming down toward him in a straight line.  In the clear sunlight they were visible for a great distance, and it was no difficult matter to determine their starting point.  Some two hundred yards above, another tree projected out over the water very much the same as that upon which Hans was seated, so similar in fact that he had often used it for the same purpose.  As the line of the pieces of bark pointed directly toward these, there was but little doubt that here they were launched upon the water.  \"It can't be dat Quanonshet and Madokawandock is dere,\" mused Hans Vanderbum, \"for to try to worry deir poor old fader.  Dey're too big Dutchmen to build such boats, and dey wouldn't know how to make 'em float under me if dey did.  No; dere's somebody out on dat tree, and he's doing it to make me look up at him.  I'm looking but I can't see notting.\"  He shaded his eyes as he spoke, and looked long and searchingly at the tree, but for a considerable time could discover nothing unusual about it.  At length, however, he fancied that he saw one of the limbs sway gently backward and forward in a manner that could hardly be caused by the wind.  Gradually it began to dawn upon him that if there was any person upon the tree, he meant that his presence should not be suspected by the Shawnees along the bank.  Accordingly Hans Vanderbum was more circumspect in his observations.  Still watching the tree, he soon discovered something else that he thought was meant to attract his eye.  The water directly beneath it flashed and sparkled as if it was disturbed by some object.  Straining his gaze, he finally discerned what appeared to be a human hand swaying backward and forward.  \"Dat is enough!\" thought Hans Vanderbum.  \"Dere's somebody dere dat wants to see me, and is afeard of dese oder chaps about, so I goes to him.\"  Working his way cautiously backward, he reached the land and started apparently to return to his wigwam.  As he did so, he looked at the Shawnees and was gratified to see that their suspicions had not been aroused by his movements.  Proceeding some distance, he hid his fish and line and made his way up the river, escaping the Shawnees by means of a long _d√©tour_.  Reaching the stream and tree, he was somewhat taken aback by not finding any one at all.  Considerably perplexed, he looked about him.  \"Can't be dat Quanonshet and Madokawandock have been fooling deir poor old fader again,\" said he.  \"I'm purty sure I seen some one on the tree, when dem pieces of bark come swimming downstream.\"  A subdued whistle reached his ear.  Looking behind him, he saw a Huron Indian standing a few yards away.  The eyes of both lit up as they encountered the gaze of each other, for they were both friends and old acquaintances.  \"Ish dat you, Oonomoo?\" inquired Hans Vanderbum.  \"Yeh--me--Oonomoo,\" replied the Indian, pronouncing his name somewhat differently from the Dutchman, (and from that by which we have before referred to him).  \"Was dat you on de tree out dere?\"  \"Yeh, me--Oonomoo out dere on log.\"  \"And did you make dem pieces of bark to come swimming down by me?\"  \"Yeh, me made 'em.\"  \"And shtirred de water wid yer hand and moved de limb?\"  \"Yeh, Oonomoo do all dat.\"  \"I shpose you wanted to see me?\"  \"Yeh, wanted to see you--want talk wid you,\" said the Huron, motioning for Hans to follow him.  The latter did not hesitate to do so, as he had perfect faith in his honesty, knowing much of his history.  The savage led the way some distance into the woods, where they were not likely to be seen or overheard, and then stopped and confronted his companion.  \"Where'd you come from, Oonomoo?\" asked the latter.  \"From fightin' de Shawnees,\" replied the savage, proudly.  \"Yaw, I sees yer am in de war-paint.  Did you get many?\"  \"The lodge of Oonomoo is full of the scalps of the cowardly Shawnees, taken many moons ago,\" answered the Huron, his eyes flashing fire and his breast heaving at the remembrance of his exploits.  This reply was made in the Shawnee language, as he spoke it as well as one of their warriors; and, as Hans also understood it, the conversation was now carried on in that tongue.  \"When did you see Annie Stanton last?\" inquired the Dutchman, showing considerable interest.  \"Several moons ago, when the sun was in the woods and the waters were asleep.\"  \"Is her husband, that rascally Ferrington, living?\"  Oonomoo replied that he was.  \"And is their baby, too?\"  \"Yes, they have two pappooses.\"  \"Dunder and blixen!\" exclaimed Hans Vanderbum, and then resuming the English language, or rather his version of it, he added:  \"Dat gal wanted to marry mit me once.\"  \"Why no marry den?\" inquired Oonomoo, also coming back to the more difficult language.  \"She wan't te right kind of a gal--she wan't like my Keewaygooshturkumkankangewock, dat is de same shape all de way down from her head to her heels.  So I let dat Ferrington have her.\"  The Huron, who understood all about that matter, indulged in a broad smile at this remark.  Whatever his business was, it was manifest he was in no hurry, else he would not have indulged in this by-play of words with his friend.  \"You doesn't t'ink de baby will dies, does you?\"  \"No--in de settlement--Shawnee can't git her now--don't live off in de woods like as dey did afore.\"  \"Dat's lucky for her; don't t'ink dey will get her there, 'cause dey tried it once--dat time, you remember, when we was all in de HUNTER'S CABIN in de woods, and you came down de chimney, and I watched and kept de Shawnee off.\"  The Huron signified that he remembered the circumstance well.  \"Dem was great times,\" added Hans Vanderbum, calling up the recollection of them.  \"I left de village one hot afternoon, and walked all de way t'rough de woods to get to de cabin to help dem poor folks. We had mighty hard times.  I catched a cold and couldn't shtop my dunderin' nose one night when it wanted to shneeze, and dat's de way de Shawnee catched me.  Twan't so bad arter all,\" added Hans Vanderbum, musingly, \"'cause if it wasn't for dat I wouldn't got my Keewaygooshturkumkankangewock.\"  \"How soon go back?\" asked Oonomoo.  \"To de village, do you mean?\"  \"Yeh.\"  \"Any time afore noon will does, so Keewaygooshturkumkankangewock gits de fish for our dinner.\"  \"One, two hours,\" said the Huron, looking up at the sky, \"den sun git dere,\" pointing to the zenith.  \"Shawnees know here?\"  \"Know me here?  Guesses not; don't care if dey does, nor dey doesn't care neider.\"  \"Shawnees won't come here?\"  \"No, no, Oonomoo, you needn't be afraid--\"  \"Afraid who?\" demanded the Huron, with quick fierceness.  \"Oonomoo never run afore one--two--t'ree--dozen Shawnees.  He only runs when dey comes like de leaves in de woods.\"  \"Dey won't come like de leaves.  If dey does, why you can leave too, and I t'inks you know how to use dem legs dat you've got tacked onto you.  I t'inks you run as fast as me.\"  \"So I t'inks,\" replied the Indian, with a grin.  \"Dere's no mistake but dem Shawnees would like to get your scalp, Oonomoo.\"  \"Two--t'ree--hundreds--all Shawnees like to git Oonomoo's scalp--nebber git him--Oonomee die in his lodge--scalp on his head,\" said the Huron, proudly.  \"I hopes so; hopes I will, too.\"  The expression of the Indian's face was changed.  It assumed a dark, earnest appearance.  He was done trifling, and wished to commence business.  \"See her dis mornin'?\" he asked, in short, quick tones.  \"See who?\" asked Hans Vanderbum, in turn, completely at a loss to understand him.  \"De gal.\"  \"De gal?  Who you talking about--Keewaygooshturkumkankangewock?\"  \"De gal Shawnees got"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16871"],["title","Skyrider (#1)"],["body","n't even rhyme!\"  \"Aw, ferget that stuff! Witless wight's all right, ain't it? I claim Mary V's some poetry writer. Don't you go actin' up jealous. She ain't got the jingle, mebby, but she shore is there with the big idee.\"  \"'_Drink the dipper dry_'--that shore does hit me where I live!\" cried little Curley. \"Did you make it up outa yore own head, Johnny?\"  \"Naw. I made it up out of a spellin' book!\" Johnny, being outnumbered five to one, decided to treat the whole matter with lofty unconcern. \"Hand it over, Bud.\"  Bud did not want to hand it over. He had just discovered that he could sing it, which he proceeded to do to the tune of \"Auld Lang Syne\" and the full capacity of his lungs. Bill and Aleck surged up to look over his shoulder and join their efforts to his, and the half dozen horses held captive in that corral stampeded to a far corner and huddled there, shrinking at the uproar.  \"_And kiss 'er snow-white ha-a-and, and kiss 'er snow-white ha-and_,\" howled the quartet inharmoniously, at least two of them off key; for Tex Martin had joined the concert and was performing with a bull bellow that could be heard across a section. Then Bud began suddenly to improvise, and his voice rose valiantly that his words might carry their meaning to the ears of Johnny Jewel, who had stalked back across the corral and was striving now to catch the horse he had let go, while his one champion, little Curley, shooed the animal into a corner for him.  \"_It would be grand to kiss her hand, her snow-white hand, if I had the sand!_\" Bud chanted vain-gloriously. \"How's that, Skyrider? Ain't that purty fair po'try?\"  \"It don't fit into the tune with a cuss,\" Tex criticized jealously. \"Pass over that po'try of Johnny's. Yo' all ain't needin' it--not if you aims to make up yore own words.\"  \"C'm _'ere_! You wall-eyed weiner-wurst!\" Johnny harshly addressed the horse he was after. \"You've got about as much brains as the rest of this outfit--and that's putting it strong! If I owned you--\"  \"_I'd cir-cle high 's if pass-in' by, then vol-lup bank an' la-a-and_,\" the voice of Tex roared out in a huge wave that drowned all other sounds, the voices of Bill, Aleck, and Bud trailing raucously after.  Johnny, goaded out of his lofty contempt of them, whirled suddenly and picked up a rock. Johnny could pitch a very fair ball for an amateur, and the rock went true without any frills or curving deception. It landed in the middle of Bud Norris's back, and Bud's vocal efforts ended in a howl of pain.  \"Serves you right, you devil!\" Mary V commented unsympathetically from her perch on the ledge.  Three more rocks ended the concert abruptly and started something else. Curley had laughed hysterically until the four faced belligerently Johnny's bombardment and started for him. \"Beat it, Johnny! Beat it!\" cried Curley then, and made for the fence.  \"I will like hell!\" snarled Johnny, and gathered more rocks.  \"Oh, Johnny! Sudden's comin'!\" wailed Curley from the top rail. \"Quit it, Johnny, or you'll git fired!\"  \"I don't give a damn if I do!\" Johnny's full, young voice shouted ragefully. \"It'll save me firing myself. Before I'll work with a bunch of yellow-bellied, pin-headed fools--\" He threw a clod of dirt that caught Tex on the chin and filled his mouth so that he nearly choked, and a jagged pebble that hit Aleck just over the ear a glancing blow that sent him reeling. The third was aimed at Bill, but Bill ducked in time, and the rock went on over his head and very nearly laid out Mary V's father, he whom the boys called \"Sudden\" for some inexplicable reason.  Mary V's father dodged successfully the rock, saw a couple of sheets of paper lying on the ground, and methodically picked them up before he advanced to where his men were trying to appear very busy with the horses, or with their ropes, or with anything save what had held their attention just previous to his coming.  All save Johnny, who was too mad to care a rap what old Sudden Selmer thought of him or did to him. He went straight up to the boss.  \"I'll thank you for that paper,\" he said hardily. \"It's mine, and the boys have been acting the fool with it.\"  \"Yeh? They have?\" Selmer turned from the first page and read the second without any apparent emotion. \"You write that?\"  Johnny flushed. \"Yes, sir, I did. Do you mind letting--\"  \"That what I heard them yawping here in the corral?\" Selmer folded the paper with care, his fingers smoothing out the wrinkles and pausing to observe the place where Mary V had torn off a corner.  \"Poets and song birds on the pay roll, eh? Thought I hired you boys to handle horses.\" Having folded the papers as though they were to be placed in an envelope, Sudden held the verses out to Johnny. \"As riders,\" he observed judicially, \"I know just about what you boys are worth to me. As poets and singers, I doubt whether the Rolling R can find use for you. What capacity do I find you in, Curley? Director of the orchestra, or umpire?\"  Curley climbed shamefacedly off the fence and picked up his rope. The business of taming bronks was resumed in a dead silence broken only by the trampling of the horses and a muttered oath now and then. A lump over Aleck's ear was swelling so that the hair lifted there, and Bud limped and sent scowling glances at Johnny Jewel. Tex spat dirt off his tongue and scowled while he did it; indeed, no eyes save those of little Curley seemed able to look upon Johnny with a kindly light.  Mary V's father stood dispassionately watching them for five minutes or so before he turned back to the gate. Not once had he smiled or shown any emotion whatever. But he had a new story to tell his friends in the clubs of Tucson, Phoenix, Yuma, Los Angeles. And whenever he told it, Sudden Selmer would repeat what he called _The Skyrider's Dream_ from the first verse to Mary V's last--even unto Bud's improvisation. He would paint Johnny's bombardment of the choir practice until his audience could almost hear the thud of the rocks when they landed. He would describe the welt on Aleck's head, the exact shade of purple in Curley's face when his boss called him off the fence. He would not smile at all during the recital, but his audience would shout and splutter and roar, and when he paused as though the story was done, some one would be sure to demand more.  Then a little twitching smile would show at the corner of Sudden's lips, and he would drawl whimsically: \"Those boys were so scared they never chirped when the poet actually went sky-riding to an altitude of about ten feet above the saddle horn, and lit on the back of his neck. Johnny's a good rider, too, but he was mad. He was so mad I don't believe he knows yet that he was piled. Afterwards? Oh, well, they came to along about supper time and yawped his poetry all over the place, I heard. But that was after I had left the ranch.\"  There were a few details which Sudden, being only human, could not possibly give his friends. He could not know that Mary V went back down the hill, sneaked into the bunk house and got Johnny's coat, and sewed the sleeve lining in very neatly, and took the coat back without being seen. Nor did he know that she violently regretted the deed of kindness, when she discovered that Johnny remained perfectly unconscious of the fact that his coat sleeve no longer troubled him.     CHAPTER TWO  ONE FIGHT, TWO QUARRELS, AND A RIDDLE   Rolling R ranch lies down near the border of Mexico--near as distances are counted in Arizona. Possibly a hawk could make it in one flight straight across that jagged, sandy, spiney waste of scenery which the chance traveler visions the moment you mention southern Arizona, but if you wanted to ride to the Border from the Rolling R corrals, you would find the trip a half-day proposition. As to the exact location, never mind about that.  The Selmer Stock Company had other ranches where they raised other animals, but the Rolling R raised horses almost exclusively, the few hundred head of cattle not being counted as a real ranch industry, but rather an incidental by-product. Rolling R Ranch was the place Sudden Selmer called home, although there was a bungalow out in the Wilshire District in Los Angeles about which Sudden would grumble when the tax notice came in his mail. There was a big touring car in the garage on the back of the lot, and there was a colored couple who lived in two rooms of the bungalow for sake of the fire insurance and as a precaution against thieves, and to keep the lawn watered and clipped and the dust off the furniture. They admitted that they had a snap, for they were seldom disturbed in their leisurely caretaking routine save in the winter. Even Mary V always tired of the place after a month or two in it, and would pack her trunk and \"hit the trail\" for the Rolling R.  Speaking of Mary V, you would know that a girl with modern upbringing lived a good deal at the ranch. You could tell by the low, green bungalow with wide, screened porches and light cream trim, that was almost an exact reproduction of the bungalow in Los Angeles. A man and woman who have lived long together on a ranch like the Rolling R would have gone on living contentedly in the adobe house which was now abandoned to the sole occupancy of the boys. It is the young lady of the family who demands up-to-date housing.  So the bungalow stood there in the glaring sun, surrounded by a scrap of lawn which the Arizona winds whipped and buffeted with sand and wind all summer, and vines which the wind tousled into discouragement. And fifty yards away squatted the old adobe house in the sand, with a tree at each front corner and a narrow porch extending from one to the other.  Beyond the adobe, toward the sheltering bluff, a clutter of low sheds, round-pole corrals, a modern barn of fair size, and beside it a square corral of planks and stout, new posts, continued the tale of how progress was joggling the elbow of picturesqueness. Sudden's father had built the adobe and the oldest"]]]
