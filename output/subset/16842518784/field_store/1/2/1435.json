There is nothin' in Christmas now, nothin' for _me_ at least; it is so long since Santa Claus remembered me that I venture to say he has forgotten that there ever was such a person as Joel Baker in all the world. It used to be different; Santa Claus _used_ to think a great deal of me when I was a boy. Ah! Christmas nowadays ain't what it was in the good old time--no, not what it used to be.\"  As Joel was absorbed in his distressing thoughts he became aware very suddenly that somebody was entering or trying to enter the room. First came a draught of cold air, then a scraping, grating sound, then a strange shuffling, and then,--yes, then, all at once, Joel saw a pair of fat legs and a still fatter body dangle down the chimney, followed presently by a long white beard, above which appeared a jolly red nose and two bright twinkling eyes, while over the head and forehead was drawn a fur cap, white with snowflakes.  \"Ha, ha,\" chuckled the fat, jolly stranger, emerging from the chimney and standing well to one side of the hearth-stone; \"ha, ha, they don't have the big, wide chimneys they used to build, but they can't keep Santa Claus out--no, they can't keep Santa Claus out! Ha, ha, ha. Though the chimney were no bigger than a gas pipe, Santa Claus would slide down it!\"  It didn't require a second glance to assure Joel that the new-comer was indeed Santa Claus. Joel knew the good old saint--oh, yes--and he had seen him once before, and, although that was when Joel was a little boy, he had never forgotten how Santa Claus looked.  Nor had Santa Claus forgotten Joel, although Joel thought he had; for now Santa Claus looked kindly at Joel and smiled and said: \"Merry Christmas to you, Joel!\"  \"Thank you, old Santa Claus,\" replied Joel, \"but I don't believe it's going to be a very merry Christmas. It's been so long since I've had a merry Christmas that I don't believe I'd know how to act if I had one.\"  \"Let's see,\" said Santa Claus, \"it must be going on fifty years since I saw you last--yes, you were eight years old the last time I slipped down the chimney of the old homestead and filled your stocking. Do you remember it?\"  \"I remember it well,\" answered Joel. \"I had made up my mind to lie awake and see Santa Claus; I had heard tell of you, but I'd never seen you, and Brother Otis and I concluded we'd lie awake and watch for you to come.\"  Santa Claus shook his head reproachfully.  \"That was very wrong,\" said he, \"for I'm so scarey that if I'd known you boys were awake I'd never have come down the chimney at all, and then you'd have had no presents.\"  \"But Otis couldn't keep awake,\" explained Joel. \"We talked about everythin' we could think of, till father called out to us that if we didn't stop talking he'd have to send one of us up into the attic to sleep with the hired man. So in less than five minutes Otis was sound asleep and no pinching could wake him up. But _I_ was bound to see Santa Claus and I don't believe anything would've put me to sleep. I heard the big clock in the sitting-room strike eleven, and I had begun wonderin' if you never were going to come, when all of a sudden I heard the tinkle of the bells around your reindeers' necks. Then I heard the reindeers prancin' on the roof and the sound of your sleigh-runners cuttin' through the crust and slippin' over the shingles. I was kind o' scared and I covered my head up with the sheet and quilts--only I left a little hole so I could peek out and see what was goin' on. As soon as I saw you I got over bein' scared--for you were jolly and smilin' like, and you chuckled as you went around to each stockin' and filled it up.\"  \"Yes, I can remember the night,\" said Santa Claus. \"I brought you a sled, didn't I?\"  \"Yes, and you brought Otis one, too,\" replied Joel. \"Mine was red and had 'Yankee Doodle' painted in black letters on the side; Otis's was black and had 'Snow Queen' in gilt letters.\"  \"I remember those sleds distinctly,\" said Santa Claus, \"for I made them specially for you boys.\"  \"You set the sleds up against the wall,\" continued Joel, \"and then you filled the stockin's.\"  \"There were six of 'em, as I recollect?\" said Santa Claus.  \"Let me see,\" queried Joel. \"There was mine, and Otis's, and Elvira's, and Thankful's, and Susan Prickett's--Susan was our help, you know. No, there were only five, and, as I remember, they were the biggest we could beg or borrer of Aunt Dorcas, who weighed nigh unto two hundred pounds. Otis and I didn't like Susan Prickett, and we were hopin' you'd put a cold potato in her stockin'.\"  \"But Susan was a good girl,\" remonstrated Santa Claus. \"You know I put cold potatoes only in the stockin's of boys and girls who are bad and don't believe in Santa Claus.\"  \"At any rate,\" said Joel, \"you filled all the stockin's with candy and pop-corn and nuts and raisins, and I can remember you said you were afraid you'd run out of pop-corn balls before you got around. Then you left each of us a book. Elvira got the best one, which was 'The Garland of Frien'ship,' and had poems in it about the bleeding of hearts, and so forth. Father wasn't expectin' anything, but you left him a new pair of mittens, and mother got a new fur boa to wear to meetin'.\"  \"Of course,\" said Santa Claus, \"I never forgot father and mother.\"  \"Well, it was as much as I could do to lay still,\" continued Joel, \"for I'd been longin' for a sled, an' the sight of that red sled with 'Yankee Doodle' painted on it jest made me wild. But, somehow or other, I began to get powerful sleepy all at once, and I couldn't keep my eyes open. The next thing I knew Otis was nudgin' me in the ribs. 'Git up, Joel,' says he; 'it's Chris'mas an' Santa Claus has been here.' 'Merry Chris'mas! Merry Chris'mas!' we cried as we tumbled out o' bed. Then Elvira an' Thankful came in, not more 'n half dressed, and Susan came in, too, an' we just made Rome howl with 'Merry Chris'mas! Merry Chris'mas!' to each other. 'Ef you children don't make less noise in there,' cried father, 'I'll hev to send you all back to bed.' The idea of askin' boys an' girls to keep quiet on Chris'mas mornin' when they've got new sleds an' 'Garlands of Frien'ship'!\"  Santa Claus chuckled; his rosy cheeks fairly beamed joy.  \"Otis an' I didn't want any breakfast,\" said Joel. \"We made up our minds that a stockin'ful of candy and pop-corn and raisins would stay us for a while. I _do_ believe there wasn't buckwheat cakes enough in the township to keep us indoors that mornin'; buckwheat cakes don't size up much 'longside of a red sled with 'Yankee Doodle' painted onto it and a black sled named 'Snow Queen.' _We_ didn't care how cold it was--so much the better for slidin' downhill! All the boys had new sleds--Lafe Dawson, Bill Holbrook, Gum Adams, Rube Playford, Leander Merrick, Ezra Purple--all on 'em had new sleds excep' Martin Peavey, and he said he calculated Santa Claus had skipped him this year 'cause his father had broke his leg haulin' logs from the Pelham woods and had been kep' indoors six weeks. But Martin had his ol' sled, and he didn't hev to ask any odds of any of us, neither.\"  \"I brought Martin a sled the _next_ Christmas,\" said Santa Claus.  \"Like as not--but did you ever slide downhill, Santa Claus? I don't mean such hills as they hev out here in this _new_ country, but one of them old-fashioned New England hills that was made 'specially for boys to slide down, full of bumpers an' thank-ye-marms, and about ten times longer comin' up than it is goin' down! The wind blew in our faces and almos' took our breath away. 'Merry Chris'mas to ye, little boys!' it seemed to say, and it untied our mufflers an' whirled the snow in our faces, jist as if it was a boy, too, an' wanted to play with us. An ol' crow came flappin' over us from the cornfield beyond the meadow. He said: 'Caw, caw,' when he saw my new sled--I s'pose he'd never seen a red one before. Otis had a hard time with _his_ sled--the black one--an' he wondered why it wouldn't go as fast as mine would. 'Hev you scraped the paint off'n the runners?' asked Wralsey Goodnow. 'Course I hev,' said Otis; 'broke my own knife an' Lute Ingraham's a-doin' it, but it don't seem to make no dif'rence--the darned ol' thing won't go!' Then, what did Simon Buzzell say but that, like's not, it was because Otis's sled's name was 'Snow Queen.' 'Never did see a girl sled that was worth a cent, anyway,' sez Simon. Well, now, that jest about broke Otis up in business. 'It ain't a girl sled,' sez he, 'and its name ain't \"Snow Queen\"! I'm a-goin' to call it \"Dan'l Webster,\" or \"Ol'ver Optic,\" or \"Sheriff Robbins,\" or after some other big man!' An' the boys plagued him so much about that pesky girl sled that he scratched off the name, an', as I remember, it _did_ go better after that!  \"About the only thing,\" continued Joel, \"that marred the harmony of the occasion, as the editor of the _Hampshire County Phoenix_ used to say, was the ashes that Deacon Morris Frisbie sprinkled out in front of his house. He said he wasn't going to have folks breakin' their necks jest on account of a lot of frivolous boys that was goin' to the gallows as fas' as they could! Oh, how we hated him! and we'd have snowballed him, too, if we hadn't been afraid of the constable that lived next door. But the ashes didn't bother us much, and every time we slid side-saddle we'd give the ashes a kick, and that sort of scattered 'em.\"  The bare thought of this made Santa Claus laugh.  \"Goin' on about nine o'clock,\" said Joel, \"the girls come along--Sister Elvira an' Thankful, Prudence Tucker, Belle Yocum, Sophrone Holbrook, Sis Hubbard, an' Marthy Sawyer. Marthy's brother Increase wanted her to ride on _his_ sled, but Marthy allowed that a red sled was her choice every time.

Was it really three-quarters of a million?\"  \"Maybe it was more,\" suggested Jack.  \"If I were you, Peleg, I'd not carry so much around in my pockets,\" said Dale.  \"I ain't had a cent left to me!\" shouted the driver of the carryall. \"This is some of your jokes, an' I want you to stop it! Oh, dear, now the school's opened ag'in I suppose there won't be no rest fer nobuddy!\" And he heaved a mountainous sigh.  \"Oh, Peleg! Don't be angry with me!\" murmured Pepper, with a trace of tears in his voice. \"If you get angry I'll die!\"  \"You behave yourself, Pepper Ditmore, or I won't drive you to the Hall.\"  \"Peleg, don't you want me to drive?\" asked Andy, who was on the front seat. \"I'm a cracker-jack at driving.\"  \"Not much! Don't you tech them hosses!\" shouted the general utility man in alarm. \"That off hoss is a new one an' he's mighty skittish, I can tell you. This mornin' when I was hookin' him up he nigh kicked the leg off o' me!\"  \"Say, how are we going to get to the Hall?\" came in ugly tones from Reff Ritter. He, with six other boys, was standing beside the carryall.  \"Captain Putnam said he'd send down some carriages,\" answered Peleg Snuggers. \"There they come now,\" and he pointed to the turnouts.  \"Pshaw! I wanted to go in the carryall,\" grumbled Ritter.  \"So did I,\" added Gus Coulter.  \"Well, this is full, so you'll have to take the carriages,\" answered Peleg Snuggers. \"Everybody hold fast!\" he shouted, as he took up the reins.  \"We are off!\" shouted Pepper, gaily. \"Farewell to Cedarville and ho! for Putnam Hall!\"  \"Wish I had room, I'd turn a handspring for you,\" came from Andy, who was quite an acrobat.  \"Now don't you cut up any monkey-shines,\" pleaded the driver of the carryall. \"That new hoss won't stand for 'em.\"  \"All right, Peleg, I'll keep as quiet as a lamb without a tail.\"  \"Why is a lamb without a tail quiet?\" asked Fred Century, quickly.  \"Give it up, Fred. Why?\"  \"Because he has no tale to tell.\"  \"Wow!\"  \"What a joke!\"  \"Throw him out!\"  \"Give him some cotton to eat!\"  \"Say, do keep quiet!\" pleaded Peleg Snuggers, as the boys in the carryall commenced to push Fred from one seat to another. \"Want these hosses to ran away with you?\"  \"Better draw it mild,\" suggested Major Jack. \"We don't want any accident on the way to the Hall.\" He looked back at the crowd left on the dock. \"Has anybody seen Bert Field?\" he asked.  \"Yes, I saw him last week,\" answered a student named Paul Singleton. \"He'll be here to-morrow.\"  \"How about Emerald?\" asked Pepper.  \"Coming to-night,\" answered Andy. \"He went to Ireland this summer, and his brogue is worse than ever.\"  \"Never mind, Emerald is a good fellow,\" said Major Jack. \"His heart is as big as a barrel.\"  \"Say, but wasn't Reff Ritter mad!\" came from Dale.  \"Oh, he makes me tired,\" answered Pepper. \"After all that happened last term wouldn't you think he'd behave himself better?\"  \"It isn't in him to behave himself,\" answered Fred Century. \"He is a bully and always will be.\"  \"Well, he has got to keep his distance this term,\" said Major Jack, with a firm look on his face. \"I am not going to stand for what I have in the past.\"  \"Nor I,\" added Pepper. \"If he doesn't keep his distance he'll suffer for it.\"  The carryall was now leaving the little village of Cedarville. Soon it came out on a country road that ran in the direction of Putnam Hall.  It was an ideal day in early September, and the cadets returning to the school were in high spirits. One started to sing and the others joined in.  \"Hello, there goes the Pornell Academy stage!\" cried Pepper, presently.  \"And there are some fellows we know!\" returned Jack, as the turnout belonging to a rival school came closer. \"Roy Bock and Bat Sedley.\"  \"I'll bet they are sore over what happened last June,\" cried Pepper.  \"It was their own fault that they suffered,\" came from Andy.  \"Look out!\" sang out Dale, and dodged down in the carryall.  Spat! A half-decayed apple struck the side of the turnout. Spat! came one through the open window. Then the skin of a banana followed, landing in Jack's lap.  \"Stop that, Bock!\"  \"Don't throw things in here, Sedley!\"  \"Something to remember us by!\" shouted Roy Bock, the bully of Pornell Academy, and he threw another soft apple into the carryall. It landed on Pepper's arm, leaving quite a mess there.  \"All right, if that's your game!\" cried Pepper, and feeling in his pocket he brought forth an orange he had purchased on the boat. Taking careful aim, he let fly with all force. The orange landed fairly and squarely on Roy Bock's nose.  \"Ouch!\" roared Roy Bock, and clapped his hand to his nose, which began to bleed.  \"Here's something for you, Sedley!\" cried Andy, and sent a handful of peanut shells into the Pornell student's face.  \"I'll fix you fellows!\" roared Roy Bock in a rage, and catching up a heavy book that was on the seat beside him he started to throw the volume at Jack and Pepper.  But the volume slipped and went sailing in the air in another direction, catching poor Peleg Snuggers on the cheek. The driver of the carryall was so startled that he let go the reins and fell from his seat into the dust of the road.  As the reins dropped at their heels, one of the horses--the new one--threw up his head in sudden fright. Then he made a mad lunge forward, dragging his mate with him. The carryall gave a lurch and a bound that sent the occupants flying into each other's laps.  \"Stop the team!\" was the cry.  \"The horses are running away!\"     CHAPTER II  THE CADETS OF PUTNAM HALL   It was true, the team was running away. One of the horses was a spirited animal and he now had the bit in his teeth. The boys in the rear of the turnout looked back, to see Peleg Snuggers still lying in the highway. The stage belonging to Pornell Academy had turned down a side road.  \"Can't you stop them, Andy?\" asked Jack Ruddy.  \"I don't see how,\" was the answer from the youth on the front seat. \"I can't get hold of the lines.\"  \"We must stop 'em somehow!\" cried Fred Century. \"Otherwise we'll have a smash-up, sure!\"  \"Whoa! whoa!\" yelled half a dozen, but these cries only served to scare the team more, and away they shot along the country road, sending the carryall swaying from side to side.  \"Look! look!\" yelled Andy, suddenly. \"The regular road is shut off! They are repairing it!\"  The boys gazed ahead and saw that some wooden horses and planking had been placed across the highway. This side of the barrier some bars had been taken from a fence, so that those using the road might drive around, through an orchard belonging to a farmer named Darrison.  \"We are going to strike those planks!\" cried Dale Blackmore.  \"Maybe the team will try to jump them!\" came from Fred.  \"If they do, they'll smash the carryall sure!\" answered Pepper. \"Perhaps we had better drop out at the rear.\"  \"Look out!\" sang out somebody, and just then the carryall left the highway and turned into the orchard. Then came a scraping, as the top of the turnout hit the low-hanging branches of some apple trees.  \"Whoa! stop that wagon!\" yelled a man's voice, and Amos Darrison appeared from among the trees. He made a leap for the team, but they swerved to one side. Then came a crash, as one of the wheels caught in a stump. Over went the carryall, with the boys in it. Andy, quick to act, used his acrobatic abilities by leaping into the branches of a nearby tree. Then the farmer caught the team and stopped them.  \"Anybody hurt?\" was Pepper's question, as he crawled out of the wreck.  \"I'm all right,\" answered Fred.  \"I got a twisted ankle, that's all,\" came from Dale, as he limped out.  \"Look at Jack!\" cried several. \"He's hurt!\"  All looked and saw the young major of the school battalion lying flat on his back in the front of the carryall. He had a nasty cut on the temple and his eyes were closed.  \"He is dead!\" murmured Pepper, hoarsely.  \"Oh, don't say that!\" said Andy, in sudden terror. He had just dropped to the ground.  \"If he ain't dead he's putty badly hurted,\" said the farmer who owned the orchard.  Pepper caught his chum in his arms and brought him out and laid him on the grass.  \"He is still breathing!\" he cried. \"Get some water and we'll bathe his face. Maybe that will bring him around.\"  \"I'll get the water!\" exclaimed Dale, and ran towards a well located at the side of the orchard.  To those who have read the other volumes in this \"Putnam Hall Series,\" the lads already mentioned will need no special introduction. For the benefit of others, let me state that Jack Ruddy and Pepper Ditmore were close chums, living, when at home, in the western part of New York State. Jack was slightly the older of the two and was of rather a serious turn of mind. Pepper was full of fun, and on that account was frequently called \"The Imp.\"  As related in my first volume, entitled \"The Putnam Hall Cadets,\" the lads left home to become cadets at a new institution of learning located on Cayuga Lake. This new school was presided over by Captain Victor Putnam, a retired army officer, who had modeled his institution somewhat after the famous military academy at West Point. It was a large school, ideally located on the shore of the lake, and had attached to it a gymnasium, a boathouse, and several other buildings. On the lower floor of the main building were the"]]]
