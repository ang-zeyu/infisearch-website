Poor lassie wan, &c.  I' summer time they romp an' play    Where flowers grow wild and sweet; Ther bodies strong, ther spirits gay,    They thrive throo morn to neet. But tha's a cough, aw hear tha has;    An' oft aw've known thee sick; But tha mun work, poor little lass,    For hauf-a-craan a wick.          Poor lassie wan, &c.  Aw envy net fowks' better lot--    Aw should'nt like to swap. Aw'm quite contented wi'mi cot;    Aw'm but a warkin chap. But if aw had a lot o' brass    Aw'd think o' them 'at's poor; Aw'd have yo' childer workin' less,    An' mak yor wages moor.          Poor lassie wan, &c.  \"There is a land of pure delight,    Where saints immortal reign, Infinite day excludes the night,    And pleasures banish pain.\" Noa fact'ry bell shall greet thi ear,    I' that sweet home ov love; An' those 'at scorn thi sufferins here    May envy thee above.          Poor lassie wan, &c.   Th' First o'th Sooart  Aw heeard a funny tale last neet-- Aw could'nt howd fro' laffin-- 'Twor at th' Bull's Heead we chonced to meet, An' spent an haar i' chaffin. Some sang a song, some cracked a joak, An' all seem'd full o' larkin; An' th' raam war blue wi' bacca smook, An' ivery e'e'd a spark in.  Long Joa 'at comes thro th' Jumples cluff, Wor gettin rayther mazy; An' Warkus Ned had supped enuff To turn they're Betty crazy;-- An Bob at lives at th' Bogeggs farm, Wi' Nan throo th' Buttress Bottom, Wor treating her to summat wanm, (It's just his way,--\"odd drot em!\")  An' Jack o'th' Slade wor theear as weel, An' Joa o' Abe's throo Waerley; An' Lijah off o'th' Lavver Hill, Wor passing th' ale raand rarely.-- Throo raand and square they seem'd to meet, To hear or tell a stoory; But th' gem o' all aw heard last neet Wor one bi Dooad o'th' gloory.  He bet his booits 'at it wor true, An' all seem'd to believe him; Tho' if he'd lost he need'nt rue-- But 't wodn't ha done to grieve him His uncle lived i' Pudsey taan, An' practised local praichin; An' if he 're lucky, he wor baan To start a schooil for taichin.  But he wor takken varry ill; He felt his time wor comin: (They say he brought it on hissel Wi' studdyin his summin.) He call'd his wife an' neighbors in To hear his deein sarmon, An' tell'd 'em if they liv'd i' sin Ther lot ud be a warm en.  Then turin raand unto his wife, Said--\"Mal, tha knows, owd craytur, If awd been bless'd wi' longer life, Aw might ha' left things straighter. Joa Sooitill owes me eighteen pence-- Aw lent it him last lovefeast.\" Says Mal--\"He has'nt lost his sense-- Thank God for that at least!\"  \"An Ben o'th' top o'th' bank tha knows, We owe him one paand ten.\".-- \"Just hark!\" says Mally, \"there he goas! He's ramellin agean! Dooant tak a bit o' noatice, fowk! Yo see, poor thing, he's ravin! It cuts me up to hear sich talk-- He spent his life i' savin!  \"An, Mally, lass,\" he said agean, \"Tak heed o' my direction: Th' schooil owes us hauf a craan--aw mean My share o'th' last collection.-- Tha'll see to that, an have what's fair When my poor life is past.\"-- Says Mally, \"listen, aw declare, He's sensible to th' last.\"  He shut his een an' sank to rest-- Deeath seldom claimed a better: They put him by,--but what wor th' best, He sent 'em back a letter, To tell 'em all ha he'd gooan on; An' ha he gate to enter; An' gave 'em rules to act upon If ever they should ventur.  Theear Peter stood wi' keys i' hand: Says he, \"What do you want, sir? If to goa in--yo understand Unknown to me yo can't sir.-- Pray what's your name? where are yo throo? Just make your business clear.\" Says he, \"They call me Parson Drew, Aw've come throo Pudsey here.\"  \"You've come throo Pudsey, do you say? Doant try sich jokes o' me, sir; Aw've kept thease doors too long a day, Aw can't be fooiled bi thee, sir.\" Says Drew, \"aw wodn't tell a lie, For th' sake o' all ther's in it: If yo've a map o' England by, Aw'll show yo in a minit.\"  Soa Peter gate a time-table-- They gloored o'er th' map together: Drew did all at he wor able, But could'nt find a stiver. At last says he, \"Thear's Leeds Taan Hall, An thear stands Braforth mission: It's just between them two--that's all: Your map's an old edition.  But thear it is, aw'll lay a craan, An' if yo've niver known it, Yo've miss'd a bonny Yorksher taan, Tho mony be 'at scorn it.\" He oppen'd th' gate,--says he, \"It's time Some body coom--aw'll trust thee. Tha'll find inside noa friends o' thine-- Tha'rt th' furst 'at's come throo Pudsey.\"   Lines,  on finding a butterfly in a weaving shed.  Nay surelee tha's made a mistak;    Tha'rt aght o' thi element here; Tha may weel goa an' peark up oth' thack,    Thi bonny wings shakin wi fear.  Aw should think 'at theease rattlin looms    Saand queer sooart o' music to thee; An' tha'll hardly quite relish th' perfumes    O' miln-grease,--what th' quality be.  Maybe' tha'rt disgusted wi' us,    An' thinks we're a low offald set But tha'rt sadly mistaen if tha does,    For ther's hooap an' ther's pride in us yet.  Tha wor nobbut a worm once thisen,    An' as humble as humble could be; An' tho we nah are like tha wor then,    We may yet be as nobby as thee.  Tha'd to see thi own livin when young,    An' when tha grew up tha'd to spin; An' if labor like that worn't wrong,    Tha con hardly call wayvin 'a sin.'  But tha longs to be off aw con tell;    For tha shows 'at tha ar'nt content: Soa aw'll oppen thee th' window--farewell!    Off tha goas, bonny fly!--An' it went.   Uncle Ben  A gradely chap wor uncle Ben    As iver lived ith' fowd: He made a fortun for hissen,    An' lived on't when he'r owd. His yed wor like a snow drift,    An' his face wor red an' breet, An' his heart wor like a feather,    For he did the thing 'at's reet.  He wore th' same suit o' fustian clooas    He'd worn sin aw wor bred; An' th' same owd booits, wi' cappel'd tooas,    An' th' same hat for his yed; His cot wor lowly, yet he'd sing    Throo braik o' day till neet; His conscience niver felt a sting,    For he did the thing 'at's reet.  He wod'nt swap his humble state    Wi' th' grandest fowk i' th' land; He niver wanted silver plate,    Nor owt 'at's rich and grand; He did'nt sleep wi' curtained silk    Drawn raand him ov a neet, But he slept noa war for th' want o' that,    For he'd done the thing 'at's reet.  Owd fowk called him \"awr Benny,\"    Young fowk, \"mi uncle Ben,\"-- An' th' childer, \"gronfather,\" or \"dad,\"    Or what best pleased thersen. A gleam o' joy coom o'er his face    When he heeard ther patterin feet, For he loved to laik wi' th' little bairns    An' he did the thing 'at's reet.  He niver turned poor fowk away    Uncared for throo his door; He ne'er forgate ther wor a day    When he hissen wor poor; An' mony a face has turned to Heaven,    All glistenin wi' weet, An' prayed for blessins on owd Ben,    For he did th' thing 'at's reet.  He knew his lease wor ommost spent,    He'd sooin be called away; Yet he wor happy an' content,    An' waited th' comin day; But one dark neet he shut his e'en,    An' slept soa calm an' sweet, when mornin coom, th' world held one less,    'At did the thing 'at's reet.   The New Year's Resolve  Says Dick, \"ther's a' notion sprung up i' mi yed,    For th' furst time i' th' whole coorse o' mi life, An' aw've takken a fancy aw'st like to be wed,    If aw knew who to get for a wife.  Aw dooant want a woman wi' beauty, nor brass,    For aw've nawther to booast on misel; What aw want is a warm-hearted, hard-workin' lass,    An' ther's lots to be fun, aw've heeard tell.  To be single is all weel enuf nah an' then,    But it's awk'ard when th' weshin' day comes; For aw nivver think sooapsuds agree weel wi' men;    They turn all mi ten fingers to thumbs.  An' awm sure it's a fact, long afoor aw get done,    Aw'm slopt throo mi waist to mi fit; An' th' floor's in' a pond, as if th' peggy-tub run,    An' mi back warks as if it 'ud split.  Aw fancied aw'st manage at breead-bakin' best;    Soa one day aw bethowt me to try, But aw gate soa flustered, aw ne'er thowt o'th' yeast,    Soa aw mud as weel offered to fly.  Aw did mak a dumplin', but a'a! dear a me!    Abaght that lot aw hardly dar think; Aw ne'er fan th' mistak' till aw missed th' sooap, yo see,    An' saw th' suet i'th' sooap-box o'th' sink.  But a new-year's just startin', an' soa aw declare    Aw'll be wed if a wife's to be had; For mi clooas is soa ragg'd woll aw'm ommost hauf bare,    An' thease mullucks, they're drivin' me mad.  Soa, if yo should know, or should chonce to hear tell,    Ov a lass 'at to wed is inclined, Talegraft me at once, an' aw'll see her misel    Afoor shoo can alter her mind.\"   The Old Bachelor's Story  It was an humble cottage,    Snug in a rustic lane, Geraniums and fuschias peep'd    From every window-pane;  The dark-leaved ivy dressed its walls,    Houseleek adorned the thatch; The door was standing open wide,    They had no need of latch.  And close besides the corner    There stood an old stone well, Which caught a mimic waterfall,    That warbled as it fell.  The cat, crouched on the well-worn steps,    Was blinking in the sun; The birds sang out a welcome    To the morning just begun.  An air of peace and happiness    Pervaded all the scene; The tall trees formed a back ground    Of rich and varied green;  And all was steeped in quietness,    Save nature's music wild, When all at once, methought I heard    The sobbing of a child.--  I listened, and the sound again    Smote clearly on my ear: \"Can there,\"--I wondering asked myself--    \"Can there be sorrow here?\"--  I looked within, and on the floor    Was sat a little boy, Striving to soothe his sister's grief    By giving her a toy.  \"Why weeps your sister thus?\" I asked;    \"What is her cause "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17474"],["title","How to Listen to Music, 7th ed.

It does not aim to edify either the musical professor or the musical scholar. It comes into the presence of the musical student with all becoming modesty. Its business is with those who love music and present themselves for its gracious ministrations in Concert-Room and Opera House, but have not studied it as professors and scholars are supposed to study. It is not for the careless unless they be willing to inquire whether it might not be well to yield the common conception of entertainment in favor of the higher enjoyment which springs from serious contemplation of beautiful things; but if they are willing so to inquire, they shall be accounted the class that the author is most anxious to reach. The reasons which prompted its writing and the laying out of its plan will presently appear. For the frankness of his disclosure the author might be willing to apologize were his reverence for music less and his consideration for popular affectations more; but because he is convinced that a love for music carries with it that which, so it be but awakened, shall speedily grow into an honest desire to know more about the beloved object, he is willing to seem unamiable to the amateur while arguing the need of even so mild a stimulant as his book, and ingenuous, mayhap even childish, to the professional musician while trying to point a way in which better appreciation may be sought.  [Sidenote: _Talent in listening._]  The capacity properly to listen to music is better proof of musical talent in the listener than skill to play upon an instrument or ability to sing acceptably when unaccompanied by that capacity. It makes more for that gentleness and refinement of emotion, thought, and action which, in the highest sense of the term, it is the province of music to promote. And it is a much rarer accomplishment. I cannot conceive anything more pitiful than the spectacle of men and women perched on a fair observation point exclaiming rapturously at the loveliness of mead and valley, their eyes melting involuntarily in tenderness at the sight of moss-carpeted slopes and rocks and peaceful wood, or dilating in reverent wonder at mountain magnificence, and then learning from their exclamations that, as a matter of fact, they are unable to distinguish between rock and tree, field and forest, earth and sky; between the dark-browns of the storm-scarred rock, the greens of the foliage, and the blues of the sky.  [Sidenote: _Ill equipped listeners._]  Yet in the realm of another sense, in the contemplation of beauties more ethereal and evanescent than those of nature, such is the experience which in my capacity as a writer for newspapers I have made for many years. A party of people blind to form and color cannot be said to be well equipped for a Swiss journey, though loaded down with alpenstocks and Baedekers; yet the spectacle of such a party on the top of the Rigi is no more pitiful and anomalous than that presented by the majority of the hearers in our concert-rooms. They are there to adventure a journey into a realm whose beauties do not disclose themselves to the senses alone, but whose perception requires a co-operation of all the finer faculties; yet of this they seem to know nothing, and even of that sense to which the first appeal is made it may be said with profound truth that \"hearing they hear not, neither do they understand.\"  [Sidenote: _Popular ignorance of music._]  Of all the arts, music is practised most and thought about least. Why this should be the case may be explained on several grounds. A sweet mystery enshrouds the nature of music. Its material part is subtle and elusive. To master it on its technical side alone costs a vast expenditure of time, patience, and industry. But since it is, in one manifestation or another, the most popular of the arts, and one the enjoyment of which is conditioned in a peculiar degree on love, it remains passing strange that the indifference touching its nature and elements, and the character of the phenomena which produce it, or are produced by it, is so general. I do not recall that anybody has ever tried to ground this popular ignorance touching an art of which, by right of birth, everybody is a critic. The unamiable nature of the task, of which I am keenly conscious, has probably been a bar to such an undertaking. But a frank diagnosis must precede the discovery of a cure for every disease, and I have undertaken to point out a way in which this grievous ailment in the social body may at least be lessened.  [Sidenote: _Paucity of intelligent comment._]  [Sidenote: _Want of a model._]  It is not an exaggeration to say that one might listen for a lifetime to the polite conversation of our drawing-rooms (and I do not mean by this to refer to the United States alone) without hearing a symphony talked about in terms indicative of more than the most superficial knowledge of the outward form, that is, the dimensions and apparatus, of such a composition. No other art provides an exact analogy for this phenomenon. Everybody can say something containing a degree of appositeness about a poem, novel, painting, statue, or building. If he can do no more he can go as far as Landseer's rural critic who objected to one of the artist's paintings on the ground that not one of the three pigs eating from a trough had a foot in it. It is the absence of the standard of judgment employed in this criticism which makes significant talk about music so difficult. Nature failed to provide a model for this ethereal art. There is nothing in the natural world with which the simple man may compare it.  [Sidenote: _Simple terms confounded._]  It is not alone a knowledge of the constituent factors of a symphony, or the difference between a sonata and a suite, a march and a mazurka, that is rare. Unless you chance to be listening to the conversation of musicians (in which term I wish to include amateurs who are what the word amateur implies, and whose knowledge stands in some respectable relation to their love), you will find, so frequently that I have not the heart to attempt an estimate of the proportion, that the most common words in the terminology of the art are misapplied. Such familiar things as harmony and melody, time and tune, are continually confounded. Let us call a distinguished witness into the box; the instance is not new, but it will serve. What does Tennyson mean when he says:      \"All night have the roses heard       The flute, violin, bassoon;     All night has the casement jessamine stirr'd       To the dancers dancing in tune?\"  [Sidenote: _Tune and time._]  Unless the dancers who wearied Maud were provided with even a more extraordinary instrumental outfit than the Old Lady of Banbury Cross, how could they have danced \"in tune?\"  [Sidenote: _Blunders of poets and essayists._]  Musical study of a sort being almost as general as study of the \"three Rs,\" it must be said that the gross forms of ignorance are utterly inexcusable. But if this is obvious, it is even more obvious that there is something radically wrong with the prevalent systems of musical instruction. It is because of a plentiful lack of knowledge that so much that is written on music is without meaning, and that the most foolish kind of rhapsody, so it show a collocation of fine words, is permitted to masquerade as musical criticism and even analysis. People like to read about music, and"]]]
