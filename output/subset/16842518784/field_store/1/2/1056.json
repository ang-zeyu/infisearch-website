Uncle Noah felt his heart quiver with hope; jubilantly he turned his steps toward the railroad station ahead.  The Northern Express flashed through the snow and came to a stop with a clang and a roar, disgorging a chattering holiday crowd who paused for a change of cars at Cotesville on their southbound trips.  Uncle Noah hastened his shuffling footsteps: the Northern Express with its horde of transient visitors had been a vital part of the inspiration.  Upon the station platform people stamped up and down in the snow or laughed and chatted, quite oblivious to the timid gaze of the old darky who slowly made his way among them.  One by one Uncle Noah left them all behind, a great disappointment in his face.  In their laughing countenances he had found nothing of what he sought.     III  The Gray-Eyed Lady     III  Just ahead a girl appeared from the shadows and walked quickly toward the waiting-room.  Uncle Noah looked into her fresh, sweet face; then his own lit up with renewed hope and he followed her in and touched her timidly on the arm.  The girl turned, revealing a face rosy with cold, and a pair of warm gray eyes fringed in lashes of black, eyes that frankly offered a glimpse of a girl's impulsive heart brimming over with Christmas spirit.  Uncle Noah removed the battered fur cap and bowed low with the deference of a Cavalier.  \"I'se jus' come in to--to ask yoh, Miss,\" he said simply, \"if yoh'd like to buy an ol' nigger servant.  I'se foh sale.\"  [Illustration: \"I'se jus' come in to--to ask yoh, Miss,\" he said simply, \"if yoh'd like to buy an ol' nigger servant.  I'se foh sale.\"]  \"For sale!\"  The girl took in the quaint figure with a glance of blank astonishment.  \"Why,\"  she gasped, \"surely you--\"  \"I'se ol', Miss,\" he interrupted timidly, but meeting her gaze with unwavering sincerity; \"I specs I'se mos' a hundred; but I'se powahful tough an' full o' work, an'--an', Miss, I has to sell maself tonight 'cause--'cause--\"  Uncle Noah paused uncertainly, seeking a fit expression of his dilemma, and the girl, readily intuitive, glanced swiftly about to assure herself that the waiting-room was free from unsympathetic eavesdroppers.  Then, strangely drawn by this quaint old vender of humanity, and warmly eager to put him more at his ease, she impulsively pushed a rocking-chair toward the old stove in the center and motioned him to be seated.  But Uncle Noah had been reared in the Fairfax family, and a Fairfax never sat when a lady was still upon her feet. With a courtly gesture the old man bowed her to the chair she had drawn for him.  A quick gleam of approval flashed in the gray eyes and with a deepening flush of puzzled interest, the girl instantly seated herself, unfastening the silver fox at her throat as she felt the warmth of the old country stove.  \"Please, I would _so_ much rather you, too, would sit down,\" she said impulsively, and as Uncle Noah drew forward another of the rickety old rocking-chairs with which the Cotesville waiting-room was dotted, she bent toward him--a light in the wonderful gray eyes that won Uncle Noah's heart.  \"Tell me,\" she said kindly: \"Tell me just why you want to sell yourself.\"  No, she had not laughed at him.  Uncle Noah glowed to the tips of his fingers at the ready sympathy of her tone.  He beamed mildly at her over his spectacles, turning the old fur cap round and round in his hands as he sought to voice the words that struggled to his lips.  \"Ol' Massa's money--an', Miss, he hain't had much since de War; jus' 'nuff to live comfutable--all go in de Cotesville bank crash las' fall an' he doan want ol' Mis' foh to know.  I'se de only one o' de niggers whut's left, an' dere's only one ol' turkey gobbler left o' de stock.  He's my ol' pet, Miss, mos' like a chile, an'--an'--\"  Uncle Noah choked.  The girl's eyes were misty velvet.  \"And he told you to kill your pet for the Christmas dinner?\" she finished gently.  Uncle Noah nodded.  \"Massa done say we mus' hab a turkey for de Christmas dinner, or ol' Mis'll suspect de--de financial crisis whut we're in.  Out in de barn I prays foh an inspiration an' I 'spect it come.\"  \"And so you decided to sell yourself--\" began the girl.  \"Yas'm.\"  Uncle Noah's voice had grown apologetic.  \"Yoh see, Miss, I'se de only thing whut I really owns 'cept dis yere ol' stickpin. Cose I'se free now, but I reckons if I has a mind to sell maself de Norf can't stop me.  I'se sellin' ma own property.\"  There was a gentle defiance in the old negro's argument.  \"And you--you wouldn't accept a--a loan?\"  The girl flushed.  The negro's hurt eyes were answer enough.  Uncle Noah had not lived in an atmosphere permeated with Fairfax pride without feeling its influence.  \"I'se not askin' foh charity, Miss,\" he averred stubbornly.  \"I'se a-sellin' sumthin'.  I reckons if yoh buy me, Miss, an' yoh lemme go back an' stay Christmas wif ol' Massa, I'll sell maself cheap.  Yoh see I'se a-plannin' first to buy a turkey whut'll take Job's place on de platter, an' den to give de Massa a gran' Christmas wif de rest o' de money what I gits foh maself, savin' out jus' enough to buy ma ol' turkey an' come to yoh first day after Christmas.  It'll be hard to leave ol' Massa and Mis', but I reckons it's jus' gotta be done.\"  Uncle Noah gulped and blinked, and there was a glimmer of wet lashes about the warm gray eyes that had won his heart.  The girl was silent so long that Uncle Noah shifted uneasily; but at last she spoke a little tremulously.  \"For what price will you sell yourself?\" she asked, and Uncle Noah never doubted but that she regarded the purchase in the same light in which he himself had viewed it.  He turned about for his purchaser's thorough inspection, his bald head above the fringe of white wool about it glistening in the lamplight. \"Do yoh think I'se wuth, say, twenty-five dollahs?\" he queried, regarding her fixedly over his spectacles.  The girl touched her throat with an unconscious gesture.  \"Yes, you are,\" she cried impulsively; \"you are indeed!\"  And before Uncle Noah had quite time to adjust himself to the joy of his unique sale the girl thrust a roll of bills into his hands and disappeared through the station door.     IV  Christmas Intrigue     IV  Uncle Noah hobbled after her.  His new mistress had quite forgotten to tell him where to deliver himself when his Christmas with the Colonel was over.  But when he reached the door she was eagerly greeting a man who had just alighted from a waiting carriage.  Uncle Noah could but dimly see him, but as the genial voice reached his ears he halted in the shadow quite content.  It was Major Verney.  The fact that the Colonel's old friend and neighbor had driven in from Fernlands to meet the radiant lady whose great gray eyes, Uncle Noah now recalled, had had the Verney look which endeared the owner of Fernlands to all who knew him, seemed to the watching negro a direct interposition of Providence.  A scant mile of cottonfields lay between the two plantations, and, Christmas over, Uncle Noah had but to trudge across the fields to deliver himself to the Major's guest.  \"And, Ruth,\" concluded Major Verney in laughing reprimand, \"you have kept me waiting.  Why, child, the Northern Express came in fifteen minutes ago.\"  Uncle Noah did not catch the girl's reply as Major Verney assisted her into the carriage and they drove rapidly away.  The old darky beamed happily after the retreating carriage; then, with his hand tightly clasped about the precious roll of greenbacks for which he had so willingly bartered his freedom, he began a tour of the Cotesville stores.  When at length he staggered into the big grocery store for his final purchases he was laden with a miscellaneous collection of Christmas packages from which he was cheerfully disentangled by the bulky proprietor himself.  Uncle Noah made a critical pilgrimage about the store, pausing at last before a counter where the proprietor had laid out a number of turkeys for the careful inspection of this beaming shopper about to select an understudy for the incomparable Job.  A very respectable fowl was presently mantled in brown paper and laid beside the other bundles, along with sundry bags of cranberries and apples, oranges and nuts, celery and raisins, cigars for the Colonel, a box of candy for Mrs. Fairfax, huge bunches of holly and mistletoe, Christmas wreaths for the windows, and a great bag of cracked corn for the reprieved tyrant gloomily roosting in the ruined hut.  As Uncle Noah carefully counted out the money required to purchase this astonishing outlay the bulky proprietor tasked pleasantly: \"Uncle Noah, do you happen to know where I can get a good woman to scrub up my store every morning?\"  Uncle Noah fingered his scarfpin uncertainly.  \"How much do yoh pay foh de work?\" he queried.  \"Fifty cents a day.\"  The negro leaned forward in tense expectancy.  \"Do yoh 'spect I could do it?\" he demanded excitedly.  The proprietor, secretly astonished by the old man's manner, nodded assuringly.  \"Why, yes, you could easily; it's nothing much; but the Colonel--\"  \"Colonel doan have foh to know,\" exclaimed Uncle Noah.  \"I comes yere mornin's foh he's up--an I 'clare to goodness, sah, I needs de money mos' powahful.\"  The proprietor was easy-going and too phlegmatic to harbor curiosity. So the bargain was straightway sealed under a pledge of deepest secrecy.  Somewhat confused by the unusual series of events, Uncle Noah, his eyes shining with a strange excitement, started for the door, quite forgetting the countless packages on the counter.  The proprietor recalled him with a hearty laugh.  \"Uncle Noah,\" he called, \"you've forgotten one or two little bundles here.\"  With a smothered gasp the old negro hurried back.  But try as they would, room for all the numerous bundles could not be found."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15831"],["title","The Scientific American Boy; Or, The Camp at Willow Clump Island (#1)"],["body","ffairs, a man who took time to answer every question put to him, explaining everything completely and yet so clearly that you caught on at once. Uncle Ed (we all called him that) was a civil engineer of very high standing in his profession, which had taken him pretty much all over the world, and his naturally inquisitive nature, coupled with a wonderful memory, had made him a veritable walking encyclopedia. With such an uncle it is no wonder that Bill knew everything. Of course, there were some things that puzzled even Bill. But all such difficulties, after a reasonable amount of brain-work had failed to clear them, were submitted to Uncle Ed. Uncle Ed was always prompt (that was one thing we liked about him), and no matter where he was or what he was doing he would drop everything to answer a letter from the society.   THE OLD TRUNK.  [Illustration: Fig. 1. The Old Trunk in the Attic.]  [Illustration: Fig. 2. The Black Walnut Box.]  But hold on, I am getting ahead of my story. I was rummaging through the attic the other day, and came across an old battered trunk, one that I used when I went to boarding-school down in south Jersey. That trunk was certainly a curiosity shop. It contained a miscellaneous assortment of glass tubes, brass rods, coils of wire, tools, fish hooks--in fact, it was a typical collection of all those \"valuables\" that a boy is liable to pick up. Down in one corner of the trunk was a black walnut box, marked, with brass letters, \"Property of the S. S. I. E. E. of W. C. I.\" On my key-ring I still carried the key to that box, which had not been opened for years. I unlocked the box and brought to light the \"Records and Chronicles of the Society for the Scientific Investigation, Exploration and Exploitation of Willow Clump Island.\" For hours I pored over those pages, carried back to the good old times we used to have as boys along the banks of the Delaware River, until I was brought sharply back to the present by the sound of the dinner bell. It seemed that the matter contained in those \"Chronicles\" was too good to be kept locked up in an old trunk. Few boys' clubs ever had such a president as Bill, or such a wonderful bureau of information as Uncle Ed. For the benefit of boys and boykind in general, I decided then and there to publish, as fully as practicable, a record of what our society did.   CHRISTMAS VACATION.  This was how the society came to be formed. Bill, whom I met at boarding-school, was an orphan, and that's why he was sent to boarding-school. His uncle had to go down to Brazil to lay out a railroad, I believe, and so he packed Bill off to our school, which was chosen in preference to some others because one of the professors there had been a classmate of Uncle Ed's at college. Bill roomed with me, and naturally we became great chums. When Christmas time came, of course I invited him to spend the holidays with me. My home was situated in the little village of Lamington, on the Jersey side of the Delaware River. Here we arrived late at night on the Saturday before Christmas. A cold wind was blowing which gave promise of breaking the spell of warm weather we had been having, and of giving us a chance to try our skates for the first time. True to our expectations, the next day was bitterly cold, and a visit to the canal which ran along the river bank, just beyond our back fence, showed that quite a thick skim of ice had formed on the water. Monday morning, bright and early, found us on the smooth, slippery surface of the canal. \"Us\" here includes, in addition to Bill and myself, my two younger brothers, Jack and Fred, and also Dutchy Van Syckel and Reddy Schreiner, neighbors of ours. It was the custom at the first of December every year to drain out most of the water in the canal, in order to prevent possible injury to the canal banks from the pressure of the ice. But there was always a foot or two of water covering the bottom of the canal, and this afforded a fine skating park of ample width and unlimited length, while the high canal banks on each side protected us from the bitter wind that was blowing. Toward noon, however, the wind shifted and swept at a terrific rate down the narrow lane between the canal banks. We could scarcely make headway against the blow. It was too much for Bill, who wasn't as used to skating as we were. He sat down in a sheltered nook and commenced to think. When Bill sat down to think it always meant that something was going to happen, as we soon learned.  \"Say, Jim,\" said he to me, \"have you got any canvas up at the house?\"  \"No,\" I replied. \"What do you want it for?\"  \"I want to rig up a skate sail. If you have an old sheet, that will do just as well.\"  \"Well, I guess I can find you an old sheet. Do you think you can make one?\"  \"Sure thing,\" answered Bill, and off we went to the house, where I received my first lesson on the practical genius of my chum.   \"BILL'S\" SKATE SAIL.  [Illustration: Fig. 3. Laying Out the Sail.]  [Illustration: Fig. 4. The Tape Tie Strings.]  [Illustration: Fig. 5. \"Bill's\" Sail Complete.]  The old sheet which Mother furnished us was laid out on the floor and two corners were folded over to the center, as shown in the drawing, making a triangle with base 7 feet long and sides each about 4 feet 6 inches long. The surplus end piece was then cut off, and a broad hem turned and basted all around the edges of the triangle. Bill wanted to work the sewing machine himself, but Mother was afraid he would break something, so she sewed down the hem for us. Then, under Bill's supervision, she re-enforced the corners by sewing on patches of cloth. Along the diagonal a strip of heavy tape was sewed, leaving loops at intervals, which afterward were cut and provided means for tying the sail to the mast. Tie strings of tape were also sewed at the corners, as shown in the illustration, and then a trip was made to the garden in search of suitable spars. A smooth bean pole of about the right weight served for the mast, and another stick with a crotch at one end served as the boom or cross-spar. The spars were cut to proper length, and the sail was then tied on, as illustrated, with the crotch of the cross-spar fitted against and tied to the center of the mast. A light rope, long enough to provide plenty of slack, was tied to the ends of the mast to assist in guiding the sail when in use. In the meantime I had procured another sheet from one of our neighbors, and Bill helped me make a sail for myself. It was not until long after dark that we finished our work.   WILLOW CLUMP ISLAND.  The next day we tried the sails and it didn't take me very long to learn how to steer the device. The wind had changed again and this time blew up the canal. We took the line of least resistance, and went skimming up the ice lane like birds for several miles before we realized how far we were getting away from home. As we rounded a bend in the canal, much to my astonishment, I saw just before us the bridge at Raven Hill, eight miles from our town. We started to go back, but the wind was too strong for us, and there wasn't much room in which to do any tacking; nor could we make any progress when the sails were folded. I began to get extremely tired and rather exasperated at Bill for not having thought of the return trip before he led me such a hot pace up the canal. But Bill was getting tired, too.  \"Look here, Jim,\" he said, \"we haven't covered a mile, and I'm worn out.\"  \"Why in thunder didn't you think of this before we started?\" I returned.  \"How much money have you with you?\" was the reply.  \"What's that got to do with it?\"  \"I'll tell you in a minute. How much have you?\"  A careful search of my dozen odd pockets netted the sum of twenty-seven cents.  \"I have fifty-nine,\" said Bill, \"and that makes eighty-six altogether, doesn't it? Isn't there a railroad depot near here?\"  \"There is one at Raven Hill, and the next is at Lumberville. That is about eleven miles from home.\"  \"Well,\" said Bill, \"at three cents each per mile that would amount to sixty-six cents. Let's sail on to Lumberville and then take the train back.\"  On we sped to Lumberville, only to find that the next train was not due until noon, and it was now just half past ten.  Time never hung heavy on our hands. Out on the river we espied an island. I had heard of this island--Willow Clump Island, it was called--but had never been on it; consequently I fell in with Bill's suggestion that we make it a visit. Owing to the rapids which separated the island from the Jersey shore, we had to go up stream a quarter of a mile, to where a smooth sheet of ice had formed, over a quiet part of the river; thence we sailed down to the island along the Pennsylvania side.  \"What a capital island for a camp,\" cried Bill, after we had explored it pretty thoroughly. \"Have you ever been out camping?\"  I had to confess I never had, and then Bill gave me a glowing account of his experiences in the Adirondacks with his uncle the year before, which so stirred up the romance in me that I wanted to camp out at once.  \"Shucks!\" said Bill, \"We would freeze in this kind of weather, and besides, we've got to make a tent first.\"  We then sat down and made elaborate plans for the summer. Suddenly the distant sound of a locomotive whistle interrupted our reveries.  \"Jiminy crickets!\" I exclaimed. \"That's the train coming through Spalding's Cut. We've got to hustle if we are to catch it.\"  We were off like the wind, and a merry chase brought us to the Lumberville depot in time to flag the train. We arrived at Lamington at half past twelve, a trifle late for dinner, rather tired and hungry, but with a glowing and I fear somewhat exaggerated account of our adventure for the credulous ears of the rest of the boys.   ORGANIZING THE SOCIETY.  The camping idea met with the hearty approval of all, and it was decided to begin preparations at once for the following summer.
