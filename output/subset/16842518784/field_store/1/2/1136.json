See his ears shake! He's putting something in his mouth.\"  \"In whose mouth?\"  Mr. Parlin looked across the aisle.  \"That 'big man' is my old friend Captain Lally,\" said he quite pleased; and in a moment he was shaking hands with him. Presently the captain and his son Adolphus changed places with the woman and the freckled girl, and made themselves neighbors to the Parlins. The two seats were turned _vis-a-vis_, the gentlemen occupying one, the children the other.  Now Dotty discovered what it was that Adolphus had in his lap; it was a Spanish rabbit; and if you never saw one, little reader, you have no idea how beautiful an animal can be. If there is any gem so soft and sparkling as his liquid Indian-red eyes, with the sunshine quivering in them as in dewdrops, then I should like to see that gem, and have it set in the finest gold, and send it to the most beautiful woman in the world to wear for a ring. This rabbit was white as a snowball, with ears as pink as blush roses, and a mouth that was always in motion, whether Adolphus put lumps of sugar in it or not.  Dotty went into raptures. She forgot her \"style\" hat, and her new dignity, and had no greater ambition than to hold the lovely white ball in her arms. Adolphus allowed her to do so. He was very kind to answer all her questions, and always in the most sensible manner. If Dotty had been a little older, she would have seen that the captain's son was a remarkably intelligent boy, in spite of his smashed hat.  After everything had been said that could possibly be thought of, in regard to rabbits and their ways, Dotty looked again, and very critically, at Adolphus. His collar was wrinkled, his necktie one-sided, he wore no gloves, and, on the whole, was not dressed ad well as Dotty, who had started from home that very morning, clean and fresh. He was every day as old as Susy; but Miss Dimple, as a traveller bound on a long journey, felt herself older and wiser still, and began to talk accordingly. Smoothing down the skirt of her dress with her neatly-gloved hands, she remarked:--     CHAPTER II.  THE CAPTAIN'S SON.   \"Is your name Dollyphus?\"  \"Yes, Adolphus Lally.\"  \"Well, my name is Alice. Nobody calls me by it but my papa and my grandmas. Dotty Dimple is my short name. There are a pair of dimples dotted into my cheek; don't, you see? That's what it's for. I was born so. My _other_ sisters haven't any at all.\"  Adolphus smiled quietly; he had seen dimples before.  \"You didn't ever know till just now there was any such girl as _me_, I s'pose.\"  \"No, I never did.\"  \"I live in the city of Portland,\" pursued Dotty, with a grand air, \"and my papa and mamma, and two sisters, and a Quaker grandma (only you must say 'Friend') with a white handkerchief on. Have you any grandma like that?\"  \"No, my grandmother is dead.\"  \"Why, there's two of mine alive, and one grandpa. Just as nice! They don't scold. They let you do everything. I wouldn't _not_ have grandmothers and fathers for anything! But _you_ can't help it. Did you ever have your house burnt up?\"  \"No, indeed.\"  \"Well, ours did; the chambers, and the cellar, and the windows and doors. We hadn't any place to stay. My sister Susy! You ought to heard her cry! I lost the beautifulest tea-set; but I didn't say much about it.\"  \"Where do you live now?\"  \"O, there was a man let us have another house. It isn't so handsome as our house was; for the man can't make things so nice as my father can. We live in it now. Can you play the piano?\"  \"No, not at all.\"  \"Don't you, honestly; Why, I do. Susy's given me five lessons. You have to sit up as straight as a pin, and count your fingers, one, two, three, four. X is your thumb.\"  Dotty believed she was imparting valuable information. She felt great pleasure in having found a travelling companion to whom she could make herself useful.  \"I'm going to tell you something. Did you ever go to Indiana?\"  \"No.\"  \"Didn't you? They call it Out West. I'm going there. Yes, I started to-day. The people are called Hoojers. They don't spect me, but I'm going. Did you ever hear of a girl that travelled out West?\"  \"O, yes; ever so many.\"  \"I mean a girl as little as me, 'thout anybody but my papa; and he don't know how to part my hair in the middle. I have to take all the care of myself.\"  Dotty had been trying all the while to call forth some exclamation of awe, or at least surprise. She was sure Adolphus would be impressed now.  \"All the whole care of myself,\" repeated she. \"My papa has one of the _highest_ 'pinions of me; and he says I'm as good as a lady when I try. Were you ever in the cars before, Dollyphus?\"  \"O, yes,\" was the demure reply, \"a great many times. I've been round the world.\"  Dotty started suddenly, dropping her porte-monnaie on the floor.  \"Round the world! The whole round world?\" gasped she, feeling as insignificant as a \"Catharine wheel,\" which, having \"gone up like a rocket,\" has come down \"like a stick.\"  \"You didn't say round the _whole_ world?\" repeated she, looking very flat indeed.  \"O, yes, in my father's ship.\"  His \"father's ship.\" Dotty's look of superiority was quenched entirely. Even her jaunty hat seemed to humble itself, and her haughty head sink with it.  Adolphus stooped and restored the porte-monnaie, which, in her surprise, she had quite forgotten.  \"Does your father keep a ship?\" asked she, reverently.  \"Yes; and mother often makes voyages with him. Once they took me; and that was the time I went round the world. We were gone two years.\"  \"Weren't you afraid?\"  \"No, I'm never afraid where my father is.\"  \"Just a little afraid, I mean, when you found the ship was going tip-side up?\"  \"Tip-side up?\" said Adolphus. \"I don't understand you.\"  \"Why, when you got to the other side of the world, then of course the ship turned right over, you know. Didn't you want to catch hold of something, for fear you'd fall into the sky?\"  Adolphus laughed; he could not very well help it; but, observing the mortification expressed in his companion's face, he sobered himself instantly, and replied,--  \"No, Dotty; the world is round, but you wouldn't know it by the looks of it. Wherever I've been, the land seems flat, except the hills, and so does the water, all but the waves.\"  As the captain's son said this, he looked pityingly at his little companion, wondering how she happened to be so silly as to suppose a ship ever went \"tip-side up.\" But he was mistaken if he considered Dotty a simpleton. The child had never gone to school. Her parents believed there would be time enough yet for her to learn a great many things; and her ignorance had never distressed them half so much as her faults of temper.  \"Did you ever go as far as Boston before?\" pursued Adolphus, rather grandly, in his turn.  \"No, I never,\" replied Dotty, meekly; \"but Prudy has.\"  \"So I presume you haven't been in Spain? It was there I bought my beautiful rabbit. Were you ever in the Straits of Malacca?\" continued he, roguishly.  \"No--o. I didn't know I was.\"  \"Indeed? Nor in the Bay of Palermo? The Italians call it the Golden Shell.\"  \"I don't _s'pose_ I ever,\" replied Dotty, with a faint effort to keep up appearances; \"but I went to _Quoddy_ Bay once!\"  \"So you haven't seen the _loory_? It is a beautiful bird, and talks better than a parrot. I have one at home.\"  \"O, have you?\" said Dotty, in a tone of the deepest respect.  \"Yes; then there is the _mina_, a brown bird, larger than a crow; converses quite fluently. You have heard of a mina, I dare say.\"  Dotty shook her head in despair. She was so overwhelmed by this time, that, if Adolphus had told of going with Captain Lally to the moon in a balloon, she would not have been greatly surprised.  A humorous smile played around the boy's mouth. Observing his little companion's extreme simplicity, he was tempted to invent some marvellous stories for the sake of seeing her eyes shine.  \"I can explain it to her afterwards,\" said he to his conscience.  \"Did you ever hear of the Great Dipper, Dotty?\"  \"I don't know's I did. No.\"  \"You don't say so! Never heard of the Great Dipper! Your sister Prudy has, I'm sure. It is tied to the north pole, and you can dip water with it.\"  \"Is it big?\"  \"No, not very. About the size of a tub.\"  \"A dipper as big as a tub?\" repeated Dotty, slowly.  \"Yes, with the longest kind of handle.\"  \"I couldn't lift it?\"  \"No, I should judge not.\"  \"Who tied it to the north pole?\"  \"I don't know. Columbus, perhaps. You remember he discovered the world?\"  Dotty brightened.  \"O, yes, I've heard about that! Susy read it in a book.\"  \"Well, I'll tell you how it was. There had been a world, you see; but people had lost the run of it, and didn't know where it was, after the flood. And then Columbus went in a ship and discovered it.\"  \"He did?\"  Dotty looked keenly at the captain's son. He was certainly in earnest; but there was something about it she did not exactly understand.  \"Why, if there wasn't any world all the time, where did _C'lumbus_ come from?\" faltered she, at last.  \"It is not generally known,\" replied Adolphus, taking off his hat, and hiding his face in it.  Dolly sat for some time lost in thought.  \"O, I forgot to say,\" resumed Adolphus, \"the north pole isn't driven in so hard as it ought to be. It is so cold up there that the frost 'heaves' it. You know what 'heaves' means? The ground freezes and then thaws, and that loosens the pole. Somebody has to pound it down, and that makes the noise we call thunder.\"  Dotty said nothing to this; but her youthful face expressed surprise, largely mingled with doubt.  \"You have heard of the _axes_ of the earth? That is what they pound the pole with. Queer--isn't it? But not so queer to me as the Red Sea.\"  Adolphus paused, expecting to be questioned; but Dotty maintained a discreet silence.  \"The water is a very bright red, I know; but I never _could_ believe that story about the giant's having"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16383"],["title","Dotty Dimple Out West (#2)"],["body","nose-bleed, and coloring the whole sea with blood. Did you ever hear of that?\"  \"No, I never,\" replied Dotty, gravely. \"You needn't tell it, Dollyphus. I'm too tired to talk.\"  Adolphus felt rather piqued as the little girl turned away her head and steadily gazed out of the window at the trees and houses flying by. It appeared very much as if she suspected he had been making sport of her.  \"She isn't a perfect ignoramus, after all.\" he thought; \"that last lie was a little too big.\"  After this he sat for some time watching his little companion, anxious for an opportunity to assure her that these absurd stories had been spun out of his own brain. But Dotty never once turned her face towards him. She was thinking,--  \"P'rhaps he's a good boy; p'rhaps he's a naughty boy: but I shan't believe him till I ask my father.\"  At Portsmouth, Captain Lally and son left the cars, much to Dotty's relief, though they did carry away the beautiful Spanish rabbit; and it seemed to the child as if a piece of her heart went with it.  \"Is my little girl tired?\" said Mr. Parlin, putting an arm around Dotty.  \"No, papa, only I'm thinking. The north pole is top of the world--isn' it? As much as five hundred miles off?\"  \"A great deal farther than that, my dear.\"  \"There, I thought so! And we couldn't hear 'em pound it down with an axe--could we? That isn't what makes thunder? O, what a boy!\"  Mr. Parlin laughed heartily.  \"Did Adolphus tell you such a story as that?\"  \"Yes, sir, he did,\" cried Dotty, indignantly, \"and said there was a dipper to it, with a handle on, as large as a tub. And a man tied it that came from I-don't-know-where, and found this world. I know _that_ wasn't true, for he didn't say anything about Adam and Eve. What an awful boy!\"  \"What did you say to Adolphus?\" said Mr. Parlin, still laughing. \"Hadn't you been putting on airs? And wasn't that the reason he made sport of you?\"  \"I don't know what 'airs' are, papa.\"  \"Perhaps you told him, for instance, that you were travelling out West, and asked him if _he_ ever went so far as that.\"  \"Perhaps I did,\" stammered Dotty.  \"And it is very likely you made the remark that you had the whole care of yourself, and know how to part your hair in the middle. I did not listen; but it is possible you told him you could play on the piano.\"  Dotty looked quite ashamed.  \"This is what we call 'putting on airs.' Adolphus was at first rather quiet and unpretending. Didn't you think he might be a little stupid? And didn't you wish to give him the idea that you yourself were something of a fine lady?\"  How very strange it was to Dotty that her father could read the secret thoughts which she herself could hardly have told! She felt supremely wretched, and crept into his bosom to hide her blushing face.  \"I didn't say Adolphus did right to tease you,\" said Mr. Parlin, gently.  He thought the little girl's lesson had been quite severe enough; for, after all, she had done nothing very wrong: she had only been a little foolish.  \"Upon my word, chincapin,\" said he, \"we haven't opened that basket yet! What do you say to a lunch, with the Boston Journal for a table-cloth? And here comes a boy with some apples.\"  In two minutes Dotty had buried her chagrin in a sandwich.  And all the while the cars were racketing along towards Boston.     CHAPTER III.  A BABY IN A BLUE CLOAK.   Dotty had begun to smile again, and was talking pleasantly with her father, when there was a sudden rocking of the cars, or, as Prudy had called it, a \"car-quake.\" Dotty would have been greatly alarmed if she had not looked up in her father's face and seen that it was perfectly tranquil. They had run over a cow.  This little accident gave a new turn to the child's thoughts. She gazed at the conductor with some distrust. If he did not take care of the cars, what made him wear that printed hat-band? She supposed that in some mysterious way he drove or guided the furious iron horse; and when she saw him sitting at ease, conversing with the passengers, she was not satisfied; she thought he was neglecting his duty.  \"I s'pose,\" mused she, finishing the final crumb of her sandwich,--\"I s'pose there are two kinds of conductors in cars, same as in thunder. One is a _non_, and the other isn't. I'm afraid this man is a _non_; if he is, he will conduct us all to pieces.\"  Still her fear was not very active; it did not prevent her having a good time. She saw that her father was comfortable, and this fact reassured her somewhat. If they were going to meet with a dreadful accident, wouldn't he be likely to know it?  She began to look about her for something diverting. At no great distance was a little baby in a blue cloak. Not a very attractive baby, but a great deal better than none.  \"Papa, there's more room on the seat by that lady's bandbox. Mayn't I ask to take care of her baby?\"  \"Yes, dear, if she is willing.\"  Dotty danced down the aisle, thinking as she went,--  \"My father lets me do every single thing. If we had mamma with us, _sometimes_ she'd say, No.\"  The tired woman greeted Miss Dimple cordially. She was not only willing, but very well pleased to have the uneasy baby taken out of her arms. Dotty drew off her gloves, and laid the little one's head tenderly against her cheek. Baby looked wonderingly into the bright eyes bending above him, reached up a chubby hand, caught Dotty's hat, and twitched it towards the left ear.  \"Sweetest cherub!\" said the fond mother, as if the child had done a good deed, \"Take off your hat, little girl. I'll hang it in the rack.\"  Dotty was glad to obey. But baby was just as well satisfied with his new friend's hair as he had been with the hat. It was capable of being pulled; and that is a quality which delights the heart of infancy. Dotty bore the pain heroically, till she bethought herself of appearances; for, being among so many people, she did not wish to look like a gypsy. She smoothed back her tangled locks as well as she could, and tried every art of fascination to attract the baby's attention to something else.  \"You are a pretty little girl, and a nice little girl,\" said the gratified mother. \"You have a wonderful faculty for 'tending babies. Now, do you think, darling, you could take care of him a few minutes alone, and let me try to get a nap? I am very tired, for I got up this morning before sunrise, and had baking to do.\"  \"O, yes'm,\" replied Dotty, overflowing with good nature; \"you can go to sleep just as well as not. Baby likes me--don't you, baby? And we'll play pat-a-cake all so nice!\"  \"It isn't every day I see such a handsome, obliging little dear,\" remarked the oily-tongued woman, as she folded up a green and yellow plaid shawl, and put it on the arm of the seat for a pillow. \"I should like to know what your name is; and some time, perhaps, I can tell your mother how kind you were to my baby.\"  \"My name is Alice Parlin,\" replied our enraptured heroine, \"and I live in Portland. I'm going out West, where the Hoojers live. I--\"  Dotty stopped herself just in time to avoid \"putting on airs.\"  \"H--m! I _thought_ I had seen you before. Well, your mother is proud of you; I know she is,\" remarked the new acquaintance, settling herself for a nap.  Dotty looked at her as she lay curled in an ungraceful heap, with her eyes closed. It was a hard, disagreeable face. Dotty did not know why it was unpleasing. She only compared it with the child's usual standard, and thought, \"She is not so handsome as my mamma,\" and went on making great eyes at the baby.  She was not aware that the person she was obliging was Mrs. Lovejoy, an old neighbor of the Parlins, who had once been very angry with Susy, saying sarcastic words to her, which even now Susy could not recall without a quiver of pain.  For some time Dotty danced the lumpish baby up and down, sustained in her tedious task by remembering the honeyed compliments its mother had given her.  \"I should think they _would_ be proud of me at home; but nobody ever said so before. O, dear, what a homely baby! Little bits of eyes, like huckleberries. 'Twill have to wear a head-dress when it grows up, for it hasn't any hair. I'm glad it isn't my brother, for then I should have to hold him the whole time, and he weighs more'n I do.\"  Dotty sighed heavily.  \"That woman's gone to sleep. She'll dream it's night, and p'rhaps she won't wake up till we get to Boston. Hush-a-by, baby, your cradle is green! O, dear, my arms'll ache off.\"  A boy approached with a basket of pop-corn and other refreshments. Dotty remembered that she had in her pocket the means to purchase very many such luxuries. But how was she to find the way to her pocket? Baby required both hands, and undivided attention. Dotty looked at the boy imploringly. He snapped his fingers at her little charge, and passed on. She looked around for her father. He was at the other end of the car, talking politics with a group of gentlemen.  \"Please stop,\" said she, faintly, and the boy came to her elbow again. \"I want some of that pop-corn so much!\" was the plaintive request. \"I could buy it if you'd hold this baby till I put my hand in my pocket.\"  The youth laughed, but, for the sake of \"making a trade,\" set down his basket and took the \"infant terrible.\" There was an instant attack upon his hair, which was so long and straggling as to prove an easy prey to the enemy.  [Illustration: DOTTY IN THE CARS. Page 44.]  \"Hurry, you!\" said he to Dotty, with juvenile impatience. \"I can't stand any more of this nonsense.\"  Dotty did hurry; but before she received the baby again he had been well shaken, and his temper was aroused; he objected to being punished for such a harmless amusement as uprooting a little hair. There was one thing certain: if his eyes were small, his lungs were large enough, and perfectly sound.  Startled by his lusty cries, his mamma opened one of her eyes, but immediately closed it again when she saw that Dotty was bending all the powers of her mind to the effort of soothing \"the "]]]
