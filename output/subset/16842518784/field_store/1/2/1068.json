He suddenly turned and staggered towards the side. “Do what I like on my own ship,” he said.  I think Montgomery might have left him then, seeing the brute was drunk; but he only turned a shade paler, and followed the captain to the bulwarks.  “Look you here, Captain,” he said; “that man of mine is not to be ill-treated. He has been hazed ever since he came aboard.”  For a minute, alcoholic fumes kept the captain speechless. “Blasted Sawbones!” was all he considered necessary.  I could see that Montgomery had one of those slow, pertinacious tempers that will warm day after day to a white heat, and never again cool to forgiveness; and I saw too that this quarrel had been some time growing. “The man’s drunk,” said I, perhaps officiously; “you’ll do no good.”  Montgomery gave an ugly twist to his dropping lip. “He’s always drunk. Do you think that excuses his assaulting his passengers?”  “My ship,” began the captain, waving his hand unsteadily towards the cages, “was a clean ship. Look at it now!” It was certainly anything but clean. “Crew,” continued the captain, “clean, respectable crew.”  “You agreed to take the beasts.”  “I wish I’d never set eyes on your infernal island. What the devil—want beasts for on an island like that? Then, that man of yours—understood he was a man. He’s a lunatic; and he hadn’t no business aft. Do you think the whole damned ship belongs to you?”  “Your sailors began to haze the poor devil as soon as he came aboard.”  “That’s just what he is—he’s a devil! an ugly devil! My men can’t stand him. _I_ can’t stand him. None of us can’t stand him. Nor _you_ either!”  Montgomery turned away. “_You_ leave that man alone, anyhow,” he said, nodding his head as he spoke.  But the captain meant to quarrel now. He raised his voice. “If he comes this end of the ship again I’ll cut his insides out, I tell you. Cut out his blasted insides! Who are _you_, to tell _me_ what _I’m_ to do? I tell you I’m captain of this ship,—captain and owner. I’m the law here, I tell you,—the law and the prophets. I bargained to take a man and his attendant to and from Arica, and bring back some animals. I never bargained to carry a mad devil and a silly Sawbones, a—”  Well, never mind what he called Montgomery. I saw the latter take a step forward, and interposed. “He’s drunk,” said I. The captain began some abuse even fouler than the last. “Shut up!” I said, turning on him sharply, for I had seen danger in Montgomery’s white face. With that I brought the downpour on myself.  However, I was glad to avert what was uncommonly near a scuffle, even at the price of the captain’s drunken ill-will. I do not think I have ever heard quite so much vile language come in a continuous stream from any man’s lips before, though I have frequented eccentric company enough. I found some of it hard to endure, though I am a mild-tempered man; but, certainly, when I told the captain to “shut up” I had forgotten that I was merely a bit of human flotsam, cut off from my resources and with my fare unpaid; a mere casual dependant on the bounty, or speculative enterprise, of the ship. He reminded me of it with considerable vigour; but at any rate I prevented a fight.     IV. AT THE SCHOONER’S RAIL.   That night land was sighted after sundown, and the schooner hove to. Montgomery intimated that was his destination. It was too far to see any details; it seemed to me then simply a low-lying patch of dim blue in the uncertain blue-grey sea. An almost vertical streak of smoke went up from it into the sky. The captain was not on deck when it was sighted. After he had vented his wrath on me he had staggered below, and I understand he went to sleep on the floor of his own cabin. The mate practically assumed the command. He was the gaunt, taciturn individual we had seen at the wheel. Apparently he was in an evil temper with Montgomery. He took not the slightest notice of either of us. We dined with him in a sulky silence, after a few ineffectual efforts on my part to talk. It struck me too that the men regarded my companion and his animals in a singularly unfriendly manner. I found Montgomery very reticent about his purpose with these creatures, and about his destination; and though I was sensible of a growing curiosity as to both, I did not press him.  We remained talking on the quarter deck until the sky was thick with stars. Except for an occasional sound in the yellow-lit forecastle and a movement of the animals now and then, the night was very still. The puma lay crouched together, watching us with shining eyes, a black heap in the corner of its cage. Montgomery produced some cigars. He talked to me of London in a tone of half-painful reminiscence, asking all kinds of questions about changes that had taken place. He spoke like a man who had loved his life there, and had been suddenly and irrevocably cut off from it. I gossiped as well as I could of this and that. All the time the strangeness of him was shaping itself in my mind; and as I talked I peered at his odd, pallid face in the dim light of the binnacle lantern behind me. Then I looked out at the darkling sea, where in the dimness his little island was hidden.  This man, it seemed to me, had come out of Immensity merely to save my life. To-morrow he would drop over the side, and vanish again out of my existence. Even had it been under commonplace circumstances, it would have made me a trifle thoughtful; but in the first place was the singularity of an educated man living on this unknown little island, and coupled with that the extraordinary nature of his luggage. I found myself repeating the captain’s question. What did he want with the beasts? Why, too, had he pretended they were not his when I had remarked about them at first? Then, again, in his personal attendant there was a bizarre quality which had impressed me profoundly. These circumstances threw a haze of mystery round the man. They laid hold of my imagination, and hampered my tongue.  Towards midnight our talk of London died away, and we stood side by side leaning over the bulwarks and staring dreamily over the silent, starlit sea, each pursuing his own thoughts. It was the atmosphere for sentiment, and I began upon my gratitude.  “If I may say it,” said I, after a time, “you have saved my life.”  “Chance,” he answered. “Just chance.”  “I prefer to make my thanks to the accessible agent.”  “Thank no one. You had the need, and I had the knowledge; and I injected and fed you much as I might have collected a specimen. I was bored and wanted something to do. If I’d been jaded that day, or hadn’t liked your face, well—it’s a curious question where you would have been now!”  This damped my mood a little. “At any rate,” I began.  “It’s a chance, I tell you,” he interrupted, “as everything is in a man’s life. Only the asses won’t see it! Why am I here now, an outcast from civilisation, instead of being a happy man enjoying all the pleasures of London? Simply because eleven years ago—I lost my head for ten minutes on a foggy night.”  He stopped. “Yes?” said I.  “That’s all.”  We relapsed into silence. Presently he laughed. “There’s something in this starlight that loosens one’s tongue. I’m an ass, and yet somehow I would like to tell you.”  “Whatever you tell me, you may rely upon my keeping to myself—if that’s it.”  He was on the point of beginning, and then shook his head, doubtfully.  “Don’t,” said I. “It is all the same to me. After all, it is better to keep your secret. There’s nothing gained but a little relief if I respect your confidence. If I don’t—well?”  He grunted undecidedly. I felt I had him at a disadvantage, had caught him in the mood of indiscretion; and to tell the truth I was not curious to learn what might have driven a young medical student out of London. I have an imagination. I shrugged my shoulders and turned away. Over the taffrail leant a silent black figure, watching the stars. It was Montgomery’s strange attendant. It looked over its shoulder quickly with my movement, then looked away again.  It may seem a little thing to you, perhaps, but it came like a sudden blow to me. The only light near us was a lantern at the wheel. The creature’s face was turned for one brief instant out of the dimness of the stern towards this illumination, and I saw that the eyes that glanced at me shone with a pale-green light. I did not know then that a reddish luminosity, at least, is not uncommon in human eyes. The thing came to me as stark inhumanity. That black figure with its eyes of fire struck down through all my adult thoughts and feelings, and for a moment the forgotten horrors of childhood came back to my mind. Then the effect passed as it had come. An uncouth black figure of a man, a figure of no particular import, hung over the taffrail against the starlight, and I found Montgomery was speaking to me.  “I’m thinking of turning in, then,” said he, “if you’ve had enough of this.”  I answered him incongruously. We went below, and he wished me good-night at the door of my cabin.  That night I had some very unpleasant dreams. The waning moon rose late. Its light struck a ghostly white beam across my cabin, and made an ominous shape on the planking by my bunk. Then the staghounds woke, and began howling and baying; so that I dreamt fitfully, and scarcely slept until the approach of dawn.     V. THE MAN WHO HAD NOWHERE TO GO.   In the early morning (it was the second morning after my recovery, and I believe the fourth after I was picked up), I awoke through an avenue of tumultuous dreams,—dreams of guns and howling mobs,—and became sensible of a hoarse shouting above me. I rubbed my eyes and lay listening to the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15904"],["title","The Rover Boys on the River; Or, The Search for the Missing Houseboat (#1)"],["body","ioned.  \"I don't think we'll be bothered much with Dan Baxter after this,\" Tom had said, but he was mistaken, as later events proved.  Rat, tat, tat! Rat, tat, tat! went the drum on the parade ground, and soon the three companies which comprised the Putnam Hall Battalion were duly assembled, with Major Larry Colby in command of the whole, and Dick at the head of Company A, Fred Garrison at the head of Company B, and Mark Romer leading Company C. In front of all stood Captain Putnam, the sole owner of the military institution, and George Strong, his chief assistant.  \"The boys certainly make a fine showing, on this last day of our encampment,\" said Captain Putnam to his assistant. \"And a good deal of the credit is due to you, Mr. Strong.\"  \"Thank you for saying so, sir,\" was the answer. \"Yes, they look well, and I am proud of them, Captain Putnam. I believe our military school will compare favorably with any in the land.\"  After the drill was over Captain Putnam came forward and made a rather extended speech, in which he reviewed the work accomplished at the academy from its first opening, as told by me in another series of books, entitled \"The Putnam Hall Series,\" starting with \"The Putnam Hall Cadets,\" down to those later days when the Rover boys appeared on the scene. He also complimented the cadets on their excellent showing and trusted they would all have a pleasant vacation during the summer. This speech was followed by a short address by George Strong, and then came a surprise when Dick Rover stepped forward.  \"Captain Putnam,\" said he, \"in behalf of all the cadets here assembled I wish to thank you for your kind words, which we deeply appreciate.  \"I have been chosen by my fellows to present you with this as a token of our esteem. We trust it will prove to your liking, and that whenever you look upon it you will remember us all.\"  As Dick spoke he brought into view a fair-sized package wrapped in tissue paper. When unrolled, it proved to be a small figure of a cadet, done in silver and gold. On the base was the inscription: \"From the Cadets of Putnam Hall, to Their Beloved Head Master, Captain Victor Putnam.\"  After that Mr. Strong was presented with a set of Cooper's works and the other teachers were likewise remembered. More addresses of thanks followed, and then the battalion was dismissed for dinner.  \"It's a fine wind-up for this season's encampment,\" said Tom, after it was over. \"I don't believe we'll ever have another encampment like it.\"  \"And now, ho, for the rolling river!\" cried Sam. \"Say, I'm just crazy to begin that trip on the houseboat.\"  \"So am I,\" came from both of his brothers. But they might not have been so anxious had they dreamed of the many adventures and perils in store for them.     CHAPTER II  ON THE WAY TO PUTNAM HALL   \"Boys, we start the march back to Putnam Hall in fifteen minutes!\"  Such was the news which flew around the camp not long after the dinner hour had passed. Already the tents had been taken down, the baggage strapped, and six big wagons fairly groaned with the loads of goods to be taken back to the military institution.  The cadets had marched to the camp by one route and were to return to the academy by another. All was bustle and excitement, for in spite of the general order a few things had gone astray.  \"Weally, this is most--ah--remarkable, don't you know,\" came from that aristocratic cadet named William Philander Tubbs.  \"What's remarkable, Tublets?\" asked Tom, who was near by, putting away a pair of blankets.  \"Lieutenant Rover, how many times must I--ah--tell you not to address me as Tublets?\" sighed the fashionable young cadet.  \"Oh, all right, Tubhouse, it shan't occur again, upon my honor.\"  \"Tubhouse! Oh, Rover, please let up!\"  \"What's wrong, Billy?\"  \"That is better, but it is bad enough,\" sighed William Philander. \"I've--ah--lost one of my walking shoes.\"  \"Perhaps, being a walking shoe, it walked off.\"  \"Maybe it got in that beefsteak we had this morning,\" put in Sam, with a wink. \"I thought that steak was rather tough.\"  \"Shoo yourself with such a joke, Sam,\" came from Fred Garrison.  \"Have you really lost your shoe, Tubby, dear?\" sang out Songbird Powell, the so-styled \"poet\" of the academy. And then he started to sing:  \"Rub a dub dub! One shoe on the Tubb!   Where can the other one be? Look in your bunk And look in your trunk,   And look in the bumble-bee tree!\"  \"Whoop! hurrah! Songbird has composed another ode in Washtub's honor,\" sang out Fred Garrison. \"Washtub, you ought to give Songbird a dollar for that.\"  \"Thanks, but I make not my odes for filthy lucre,\" same from Powell, tragically, and then he continued:  \"One penny reward, And a big tin sword,   To whoever finds the shoe. Come one at a time, And form in line,   And raise a hullabaloo!\"  And then a shout went up that could be heard all over the encampment.  \"I'll lend you a slipper, Tubbs,\" said little Harry Moss, whose shoes were several sizes smaller than those of the aristocratic cadet.  \"Somebody get me a shingle and I'll cut Tubstand a sandal with my jackknife,\" came from Tom.  \"I'll shingle you!\" roared William Philander Tubbs, and rushed away to escape his tormentors. In the end he found another shoe, but it was not the one he wanted, for that had been rolled up in the blankets by Tom and was not returned until Putnam Hall was reached.  Drums and fifes enlivened the way as the cadets started for the military academy. The march was to take the balance of that afternoon and all of the next day. During the night they were to camp out like regular soldiers on the march, in a big field Captain Putnam had hired for that purpose.  The march did not take the cadets through Oakville, so the Rover boys did not see the friends they had made in that vicinity. They headed directly for the village of Bramley, and then for another small settlement named White Corners,--why, nobody could tell, since there was not so much as a white post anywhere to be seen in that vicinity.  \"It's queer how a name sticks,\" declared Tom, after speaking of this to his brother Dick. \"They might rather call this Brown Corners, since most of the houses are brown.\"  At the Corners they obtained supper, which was supplied to the cadets by the hotel keeper, who had been notified in advance of their coming.  While they were eating a boy who worked around the stables of the hotel watched them curiously. Afterwards this boy came up to Sam and Tom.  \"We had a cadet here yesterday who was awfully mad,\" said the boy.  \"Had hydrophobia, eh?\" returned Tom. \"Too bad!\"  \"No, I don't mean that; I mean he was very angry.\"  \"What was the trouble?\"  \"I don't know exactly, but I think he had been sent away from the school for something or other.\"  \"What was his name?\"  \"Lew Flapp.\"  \"Why, I thought he had gone home!\" cried Sam.  \"So did I,\" answered his brother. He turned to the hotel youth. \"What was this Flapp doing here?\"  \"Nothing much. He asked the boss when you were expected here.\"  \"Is he here now?\"  \"No, he left last night.\"  \"Where did he go to?\"  \"I don't know, but I thought I would tell you about the fellow. I think he is going to try to do you cadets some harm.\"  \"Did he mention any names?\"  \"He seemed to be extra bitter against three brothers named Rover.\"  \"Humph!\"  \"Are the Rovers here?\" went on the youth.  \"I think they are, sonny. I'm one, this is another, and there is the third,\" and Tom pointed to Dick, who was at a distance, conversing with some other cadets.  \"Oh, so you are the Rovers! How strange that I should speak to you of this!\"  \"Which way did this Lew Flapp go?\" questioned Sam. \"Off the way you are bound.\"  \"I'll wager he tries to make trouble for us on our way to Putnam Hall, Tom.\"  \"It's not unlikely, Sam.\"  \"Shall we tell Captain Putnam of this?\" Tom shook his head.  \"No, let us tell Dick, though, and a few of the others. Then we can keep our eyes peeled for Lew Flapp and, if he actually does wrong, expose him.\"  A little later Tom and Sam interviewed Dick on the subject, and then they told Larry Colby, Fred Garrison, George Granbury, and half a dozen others.  \"I don't believe he will do much,\" said Larry Colby. \"He is only talking, that's all. He knows well enough that Captain Putnam can have him locked up, if he wants to.\"  By eight o'clock that evening the field in which they were to encamp for the night was reached. Tents were speedily put up, and half a dozen camp-fires started, making the boys feel quite at home. The cadets gathered around the fires and sang song after song, and not a few practical jokes were played.  \"Hans, they tell me you feel cold and want your blood shook up,\" said Tom to Hans Mueller, the German cadet.  \"Coldt, is it?\" queried Hans. \"Vot you dinks, I vos coldt mid der borometer apout two hundred by der shade, ain't it? I vos so hot like I lif in Africa alretty!\"  \"Oh, Hans must be cold!\" cried Sam. \"Let us shake him up, boys!\"  \"All right!\" came from half a dozen. \"Get a blanket, somebody!\"  \"No, you ton't, not by my life alretty!\" sang out Hans, who had been tossed up before. \"I stay py der groundt mine feets on!\" And he started to run away.  Several went after him, and he was caught in the middle of an adjoining cornfield, where a rough-and-tumble scuffle ensued, with poor Hans at the bottom of the heap.  \"Hi, git off, kvick!\" he gasped. \"Dis ton't been no footsball game nohow! Git off, somebody, und dake dot knee mine mouth out of!\"  \"Are you warm, now, Hansy!\" asked Tom.  \"Chust you wait, Tom Rofer,\" answered the German cadet, and shook his fist at his tormentor. \"I git square somedimes, or mine name ain't--\"  \"Sauerkraut!\" finished another cadet, and a roar went up. \"Hans, is it true that you eat sauerkraut three times a day when you are at home?\"  \"No, I ton't eat him more as dree dimes a veek,\" answered Hans, innocently.  \"Hans is going to treat us all to Limberger cheese when his birthday comes,\" put in Fred Garrison. \"It's a secret though, so don't tell"]]]
