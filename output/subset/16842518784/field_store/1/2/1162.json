One thought is absorbing, with giant control,--     With deadliest earnest, the national soul:--     \"The right of self-government, crown of our pride,--     Right, bought with the sacredest blood,--is denied!     Shall we tamely resign what our enemy craves?     No! martyrs we _may_ be!--we _cannot_ be slaves!\"     Fair women who naught but indulgence have seen,     Who never have learned what denial could mean,--      Who deign not to clipper their own dainty feet,     Whose wants swarthy handmaids stand ready to meet,     Whose fingers decline the light kerchief to hem,--     What aid in this struggle is hoped for from them?      Yet see! how they haste from their bowers of ease,     Their dormant capacities fired,--to seize     Every feminine weapon their skill can command,--     To labor with head, and with heart, and with hand.     They stitch the rough jacket, they shape the coarse shirt,     Unheeding though delicate fingers be hurt;     They bind the strong haversack, knit the grey glove,     Nor falter nor pause in their service of love.      When ever were people subdued, overthrown,     With women to cheer them on, brave as our own?     With maidens and mothers at work on their knees,     When ever were soldiers as fearless as these?      June's flower-wreathed sceptre is dropped with a sigh,     And forth like an empress steps stately July:     She sits all unveiled, amidst sunshine and balms,     As Zenobia sat in her City of Palms!      Not yet has the martial horizon grown dun,     Not yet has the terrible conflict begun:     But the tumult of legions,--the rush and the roar,     Break over our borders, like waves on the shore.     Along the Potomac, the confident foe     Stands marshalled for onset,--prepared, at a blow,     To vanquish the daring rebellion, and fling     Utter ruin at once on the arrogant thing!      How sovran the silence that broods o'er the sky,     And ushers the twenty-first morn of July;     --Date, written in fire on history's scroll,--     --Date, drawn in deep blood-lines on many a soul!      There is quiet at Beechenbrook: Alice's brow     Is wearing a Sabbath tranquility now,     As softly she reads from the page on her knee,--     \"Thou wilt keep him in peace who is stayed upon Thee!\"     When Sophy bursts breathlessly into the room,--     \"Oh! mother! we hear it,--we hear it!.., the boom     Of the fast and the fierce cannonading!--it shook     The ground till it trembled, along by the brook.\"      One instant the listener sways in her seat,--     The paralysed heart has forgotten to beat;     The next, with the speed and the frenzy of fear,     She gains the green hillock, and pauses to hear.      Again and again the reverberant sound     Is fearfully felt in the tremulous ground;     Again and again on their senses it thrills,     Like thunderous echoes astray in the hills.      On tip-toe,--the summer wind lifting his hair,     With nostril expanded, and scenting the air     Like a mettled young war-horse that tosses his mane,     And frettingly champs at the bit and the rein,--     Stands eager, exultant, a twelve-year-old boy,     His face all aflame with a rapturous joy.      \"_That's_ music for heroes in battle array!     Oh, mother! I feel like a Roman to-day!     The Romans I read of in Plutarch;--Yes, men     Thought it noble to die for their liberties then!     And I've wondered if soldiers were ever so bold,     So gallant and brave, as those heroes of old.     --There!--listen!--that volley peals out the reply;     They prove it is sweet for their country to die:     How grand it must be! what a pride! what a joy!     --And _I_ can do nothing: I'm only a boy!\"      The fervid hand drops as he ceases to speak,     And the eloquent crimson fades out on his cheek.      \"Oh, Beverly!--brother! It never would do!     Who comforts mamma, and who helps her like you?     She sends to the battle her darlingest one,--     She could not give both of them,--husband and son;     If she lose _you_, what's left her in life to enjoy?     --Oh, no! I am _glad_ you are only a boy.\"     And Sophy looks up with her tenderest air,     And kisses the fingers that toy with her hair.      For her, who all silent and motionless stands,     And over her heart locks her quivering hands,     With white lips apart, and with eyes that dilate,     As if the low thunder were sounding her fate,--     What racking suspenses, what agonies stir,     What spectres these echoes are rousing for her!      Brave-natur'd, yet quaking,--high-souled, yet so pale,--     Is it thus that the wife of a soldier should quail,     And shudder and shrink at the boom of a gun,     As only a faint-hearted girl should have done?     Ah! wait until custom has blunted the keen,     Cutting edge of that sound, and no woman, I ween,     Will hear it with pulses more equal, more free     From feminine terrors and weakness, than she.      The sun sinks serenely; a lingering look     He flings at the mists that steal over the brook,     Like nuns that come forth in the twilight to pray,     Till their blushes are seen through their mantles of grey.      The gay-hearted children, but lightly oppressed,     Find perfect relief on their pillow of rest:     For Alice, no bless'd forgetfulness comes;--     The wail of the bugles,--the roll of the drums,--     The musket's sharp crack,--the artillery's roar,--     The flashing of bayonets dripping with gore,--     The moans of the dying,--the horror, the dread,     The ghastliness gathering over the dead,--     Oh! these are the visions of anguish and pain,--     The phantoms of terror that troop through her brain!      She pauses again and again on the floor,     Which the moonlight has brightened so mockingly o'er;     She wrings her cold hands with a groan of despair;     --\"Oh, God! have compassion!--my darling is there!\"      All placidly, dewily, freshly, the dawn     Comes stealing in pulseless tranquility on:     More freely she breathes, in its balminess, though     The forehead it kisses is pallid with woe.      Through the long summer sunshine the Cottage is stirred     By passers, who brokenly fling them a word:     Such tidings of slaughter! \"The enemy cowers;\"--     \"He breaks!\"--\"He is flying!\"--\"Manassas is ours!\"      'Tis evening: and Archie, alone on the grass,     Sits watching the fire-flies gleam as they pass,     When sudden he rushes, too eager to wait,--     \"Mamma! there's an ambulance stops at the gate!\"      Suspense then is past: he is borne from the field,--     \"God help me!... God grant it be _not_ on his shield!\"     And Alice, her passionate soul in her eyes,     And hope and fear winging each quicken'd step, flies,--     Embraces, with frantical wildness, the form     Of her husband, and finds ... it is living, and warm!   III.      Ye, who by the couches of languishing ones,     Have watched through the rising and setting of suns,--     Who, silent, behind the close curtain, withdrawn,     Scarce know that the current of being sweeps on,--     To whom outer life is unreal, untrue,     A world with whose moils ye have nothing to do;     Who feel that the day, with its multiform rounds,     Is full of discordant, impertinent sounds,--     Who speak in low whispers, and stealthily tread,     As if a faint footfall were something to dread,--     Who find all existence,--its gladness, its gloom,--     Enclosed by the walls of that limited room,--     Ye only can measure the sleepless unrest     That lies like a night-mare on Alice's breast.      Days come and days go, and she watches the strife     So evenly balanced, 'twixt death and 'twixt life;     Thanks God he still breathes, as each evening takes wing,     And dares not to think what the morrow may bring.      In the lone, ghostly midnight, he raves as he lies,     With death's ashen pallidness dimming his eyes:     He shouts the sharp war-cry,--he rallies his men,--     He is on the red field of Manassas again.      \"Now, courage, my comrades! Keep steady! lie low!     Wait, like the couch'd lion, to spring on your foe:     Ye'll face without flinching the cannons' grim mouth,     For ye're 'Knights of the Horse-Shoe'--ye're Sons of the South!     There's Jackson!--how brave he rides! coursing at will,     Midst the prostrated lines on the crest of the hill;     God keep him! for what will we do if he falls?     Be ready, good fellows!--be cool when he calls     To the charge: Oh! we'll beat them,--we'll turn them,--and then     We'll ride them down madly!--On! Onward! my men!\"      The feverish frenzy o'erwearies him soon,     And back on his pillows he sinks in a swoon.      And sometimes, when Alice is wetting his lip,     He turns from the draught, and refuses to sip:     --\"'Tis sweet, pretty angel!--but yonder there lies     A famishing comrade, with death in his eyes:     His need is far greater,... Sir Philip, I think,--     Or was it Sir Philip?... go, go!--let him drink!\"      And oft, with a sort of bewildered amaze,     On her face he would fasten the wistfullest gaze:     --\"You are kind, but a hospital nurse cannot be     Like Alice,--my tenderest Alice,--to me.     Oh! I know there's at Beechenbrook, many a tear,     As she asks all the day,--'Will he never be here?'\"      But Nature, kind healer! brings sovereignest balm,     And strokes the wild pulses with coolness and calm;      The conflict so equal, so stubborn, is past,     And life gains the hardly-won battle at last.     How sweet through the long convalescence to lie,     And from the low window, gaze out at the sky,     And float, as the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16480"],["title","Beechenbrook (#2)"],["body"," so tranquilly do,     Aloft in the depths of ineffable blue:--     In painless, delicious half consciousness brood,--     No duties to cumber, no claims to intrude,--     Receptive as childhood, from trouble as free,     And feel it is bliss enough simply, to be!      For Alice,--what pencil can picture her joy,--     So perfect, so thankful, so free from annoy,     As her lips press the lotus-bound chalice, and drain     That exquisite blessedness born out of pain!     Oh! not in her maidenhood, blushing and sweet,     When Douglass first poured out his love at her feet;     And not when a shrinking and beautiful bride,     With worshipping fondness she clung to his side;     And not in those holiest moments of life,     When first she was held to his heart, as his wife;     And never in motherhood's earliest bliss,     Had she tasted a happiness rounded like this!      And Douglass, safe sheltered from war's rude alarms,     Finds Eden's lost precincts again in her arms:     He hears afar off, in the distance, the roar     And the lash of the billows that break on the shore     Of his isle of enchantment,--his haven of rest,--     And rapturous languor steals over his breast.      He bathes in the sunlight of Alice's smiles;     He wraps himself round with love's magical wiles:     His sweet iterations pall not on her ear,--     \"_I love you--I love you!_\"--she never can hear     That cadence too often; its musical roll     Wakes ever an echoed reply in her soul.      --Do visions of trial, of warning, of woe,     Loom dark in the future of doubt? Do they know     They are hiving, of honied remembrance, a store     To live on, when summer and sunshine are o'er?     Do they feel that their island of beauty at last     Must be rent by the tempest,--be swept by the blast?     Do they dream that afar, on the wild, wintry main,     Their love-freighted bark must be driven again?      --Bless God for the wisdom that curtains so tight     To-morrow's enjoyments or griefs from our sight!     Bless God for the ignorance, darkness and doubt,     That girdle so kindly our future about!      The crutches are brought, and the invalid's strength     Is able to measure the lawn's gravel'd length;     And under the beeches, once more he reclines,     And hears the wind plaintively moan through the pines;     His children around him, with frolic and play,     Cheat autumn's mild listlessness out of the day;     And Alice, the sunshine all flecking her book,     Reads low to the chime of the murmuring brook.      But the world's rushing tide washes up to his feet,     And leaps the soft barriers that bound his retreat;     The tumult of camps surges out on the breeze,     And ever seems mocking his Capuan ease.     He dare not be happy, or tranquil, or blest,     While his soil by the feet of invaders is prest:     What brooks it though still he be pale as a ghost?     --If he languish or fail, let him fail at his post.       The gums by the brook-side are crimson and brown;     The leaves of the ash flicker goldenly down;     The roses that trellis the porches, have lost     Their brightness and bloom at the touch of the frost;     The ozier-twined seat by the beeches, no more     Looks tempting, and cheerful, and sweet, as of yore;     The water glides darkly and mournfully on,     As Alice sits watching it:--Douglass has gone!     IV.       \"I am weary and worn,--I am hungry and chill,     And cuttingly strikes the keen blast o'er the hill;     All day I have ridden through snow and through sleet,     With nothing,--not even a cracker to eat;     But now, as I rest by the bivouac fire,     Whose blaze leaps up merrily, higher and higher,     Impatient as Roland, who neighs to be fed,--     For Caleb to bring me my bacon and bread,--     I'll warm my cold heart, that is aching and lone,     By thinking of you, love,--my Alice,--my own!      \"I turn a deaf ear to the scream of the wind,     I leave the rude camp and the forest behind;     And Beechenbrook, wrapped in its raiment of white,     Is tauntingly filling my vision to-night.     I catch my sweet little ones' innocent mirth,     I watch your dear face, as you sit at the hearth;     And I know, by the tender expression I see,     I know that my darling is musing of me.     Does her thought dim the blaze?--Does it shed through the room     A chilly, unseen, and yet palpable gloom?     Ah! then we are equal! _You_ share all my pain,     And _I_ halve your blessedness with you again!      \"Don't think that my hardships are bitter to bear;     Don't think I repine at the soldier's rough fare;     If ever a thought so unworthy steals on,     I look upon Ashby,--and lo! it is gone!     Such chivalry, fortitude, spirit and tone,     Make brighter, and stronger, and prouder, my own.     Oh! Beverly, boy!--on his white steed, I ween,     A princelier presence has never been seen;     And as yonder he lies, from the groups all apart,     I bow to him loyally,--bow with my heart.      \"What brave, buoyant letters you write, sweet!--they ring     Through my soul like the blast of a trumpet, and bring     Such a flame to my eye, such a flush to my cheek,--     That often my hand will unconsciously seek     The hilt of my sword as I read,--and I feel     As the warrior does, when he flashes the steel     In fiery circles, and shouts in his might,     For the heroes behind him, to follow its light!     True wife of a soldier!--If doubt or dismay     Had ever, within me, one instant held sway,     Your words wield a spell that would bid them be gone,     Like bodiless ghosts at the touch of the dawn.      \"Could the veriest craven that cowers and quails     Before the vast horde that insults and assails     Our land and our liberties,--could he to-night,     Sit here on the ice-girdled log where I write,     And look on the hopeful, bright brows of the men,     Who have toiled all the day over mountain, through glen,--     Half-clothed and unfed,--would he doubt?--would he dare,     In the face of such proof, yield again to despair?      \"The hum of their voices comes laden with cheer,     As the wind wafts a musical swell to my ear,--     Wild, clarion catches,--now flute-like and low;     --Would you like me to give you their Song of the Snow?      Halt!--the march is over!       Day is almost done;     Loose the cumbrous knapsack,       Drop the heavy gun:     Chilled and wet and weary,       Wander to and fro,     Seeking wood to kindle       Fires amidst the snow.      Round the bright blaze gather,       Heed not sleet nor cold,--     Ye are Spartan soldiers,       Stout and brave and bold:     Never Xerxian army       Yet subdued a foe,     Who but asked a blanket       On a bed of snow.      Shivering midst the darkness       Christian men are found,     There devoutly kneeling       On the frozen ground,--      Pleading for their country,       In its hour of woe,--     For its soldiers marching       Shoeless through the snow.      Lost in heavy slumbers,       Free from toil and strife;     Dreaming of their dear ones,--       Home, and child, and wife;     Tentless they are lying,       While the fires burn low,--     Lying in their blankets,       Midst December's snow!      Come, Sophy, my blossom! I've something to say     Will chase for a moment your gambols away:     To-day as we climbed the steep mountain-path o'er,     I noticed a bare-footed lad in my corps;     \"How comes it,\"--I asked,--\"you look careful and bold,     How comes it you're marching, unshod, through the cold?\"      \"Ah, sir! I'm a poor, lonely orphan, you see;     No mother, no friends that are caring for me;     If I'm wounded, or captured, or killed, in the war,     'Twill matter to nobody, Colonel Dunbar.\"      Now, Sophy!--your needles, dear!--Knit him some socks,     And send the poor fellow a pair in my box;     Then he'll know,--and his heart with the thought will be filled,--     There is _one_ little maiden will care if he's killed.      The fire burns dimly, and scattered around,     The men lie asleep on the snow-covered ground;     But ere in my blanket I wrap me to rest,     I hold you, my darling, close,--close, to my breast:     God love you! God grant you His comforting light!     I kiss you a thousand times over!--Good night!     V.       \"To-morrow is Christmas!\"--and clapping his hands,     Little Archie in joyful expectancy stands,     And watches the shadows, now short and now tall,     That momently dance up and down on the wall.      Drawn curtains of crimson shut out the cold night,     And the parlor is pleasant with odours and light;     The soft lamp suspended, its mellowness throws     O'er cluster'd geranium, jasmine and rose;     The sleeping canary hangs caged midst the blooms,     A Sybarite slumberer steeped in perfumes;     For Alice still clings to her birds and her flowers,     Sweet tokens of kindlier, happier hours.      \"To-morrow is Christmas!--but Beverly,--say,     Will it do to be glad when Papa is away?\"     And the face that is tricksy and blythe as can be,     Tries vainly to temper its shadowless glee.      \"For _you_, pet, I'm sure it is right to be glad;     'Tis a pitiful thing to see little ones sad;     But for Sophy and me, who are older, you know,--     We dare not be glad when we look at the snow!     I shrink from this comfort, this light and this heat,     This plenty to wear, and this plenty to eat,     When the soldiers who fight for us,--die for us,--lie,     With nothing around and above, but the sky;     When their clothes are so light, and the rations they deal,     Are only a morsel of bacon and meal:     And how can I fold my thick blankets around,     When I know that my father's asleep on the ground?     I'm ashamed to be happy, or merry, or free,     As if war and its trials were nothing to me:     Oh! I never can know any frolic or fun,--     Any real, mad romps,--till the battles are done!\"     And the face of the boy, so"]]]
