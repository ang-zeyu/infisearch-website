But the King was not easily discouraged, and kept on until he found the blackberry bushes, when he immediately began to fill his pail, the berries being remarkably big and sweet.  While thus occupied he heard a sound of footsteps coming down the mountain side, and presently a little dog ran out from the bushes and trotted up to him.  Now there were no dogs at all in Mo, and the King had never seen a creature like this before; therefore he was greatly surprised, and said:  \"What are you, and where do you come from?\"  The dog also was surprised at this question, and looked suspiciously at the King's tin pail; for many times wicked boys had tied such a pail to the end of his tail. In fact, that was the reason he had run away from home and found his way, by accident, to the Valley of Mo.  \"My name is Prince,\" replied the gravely; \"and I have come from a country beyond the mountains and the desert.\"  \"Indeed! are you in truth a prince?\" exclaimed the monarch; \"then you will be welcome in my kingdom, where we always treat nobility with proper respect. But why do you have four feet?\"  \"Because six would be too many,\" replied the dog.  \"But I have only two,\" said the King.  \"I am sorry,\" said the dog, who was something of a wag, \"because where I come from it is more fashionable to walk on four feet.\"  \"I like to be in the fashion,\" remarked the King, thoughtfully; \"but what am I to do, having only two legs?\"  \"Why, I suppose you could walk on your hands and feet,\" returned the dog with a laugh.  \"So I will,\" said the King, being pleased with the idea; \"and you shall come to the palace with me and teach me all the fashions of the country from whence you came.\"  The King got down on his hands and knees, and was delighted to find he could get along in this way very nicely.  \"How am I to carry my pail?\" he asked.  \"In your mouth, of course,\" replied the dog. This suggestion seeming a happy one, the King took the pail in his mouth and they started back toward the palace. But when his Majesty came to the gum-drops and jackson-balls they hurt his hands and knees, so that he groaned aloud. But the dog only laughed. Finally they reached a place where it was quite muddy. Of course the mud was only jelly, but it hadn't dried up since the last rain. The dog jumped over the place nimbly enough, but when the King tried to do likewise he failed, and came down into the jelly with both hands and knees, and stuck fast.  Now the monarch had a very good temper, which he carried in his vest pocket; but as he passed over the gum-drop pebbles on his hands and knees this temper dropped out of his pocket, and, having lost it, he became very angry at the dog for getting him into such a scrape.  So he began to scold, and when he opened his mouth the pail dropped out and the berries were all spilled. This made the dog laugh more than ever, at which the King pulled himself out of the jelly, jumped to his feet, and began to chase the dog as fast as he could. Finally the dog climbed a tall tree where the King could not reach him, and when safe among the branches he looked down and said: \"See how foolish a man becomes who tries to be in fashion rather than live as nature intended he should! You can no more be a dog than I can be a king; so hereafter, if you are wise, you will be content to walk on two legs.\"  \"There is much truth in what you say,\" replied the Monarch of Mo. \"Come with me to the palace, and you shall be forgiven; indeed, we shall have a fine feast in honor of your arrival.\"  So the dog climbed down from the tree and followed the King to the palace, where all the courtiers were astonished to see so queer an animal, and made a great favorite of him.  After dinner the King invited the dog to take a walk around the grounds of the royal mansion, and they started out merrily enough. But the King's boots had begun to hurt him again; for, as they did not fit, being picked green, they had rubbed his toes until he had corns on them. So when they reached the porch in front of the palace the King asked:  \"My friend, what is good for corns?\"  \"Tight boots,\" replied the dog, laughing; \"but they are not very good for your feet.\"  Now the King, not yet having found his lost temper, became exceedingly angry at this poor jest; so he rushed at the dog and gave it a tremendous kick.  Up into the air like a ball flew the dog, while the King, having hurt his toe by the kick, sat down on the door-step and nursed his foot while he watched the dog go farther and farther up, until it seemed like a tiny speck against the blue of the sky.  \"I must have kicked harder than I thought,\" said the King, ruefully; \"there he goes, out of sight, and I shall never see him again!\"  He now limped away into the back garden, where he picked a new pair of boots that would not hurt his feet; and while he was gone the dog began to fall down again. Of course he fell faster than he went up, and finally landed with a crash exactly on the King's door-step. But so great was the force of the fall and so hard the door-step that the poor dog was flattened out like a pancake, and could not move a bit.  When the King came back he said:  \"Hullo! some kind friend has brought me a new door-mat as a present,\" and he leaned down and stroked the soft hair with much pleasure. Then he wiped his feet on the new mat and went into the palace to tell the Queen.  When her Majesty saw the nice, soft door-mat she declared it was too good to be left outside; so she brought it into the parlor and put it on the floor before the fire-place.  The good King was sorry he had treated the dog so harshly, and for fear he might do some other dreadful thing he went back to the place where he had lost his temper and searched until he found it again, when he put it carefully away in his pocket where it would stay.  Then he returned to the palace an entered the parlor; but as he passed the mat, his new boots were so clumsy, he stumbled against the edge and pushed the mat together into a roll.  Immediately the dog gave a bark, got upon its legs and said:  \"Well, this is better! Now I can breathe again, but while I was so flat I could not draw a single breath.\"  The monarch and his Queen were much surprised to find that what they had taken for a mat was only the dog, that had fallen so flat on their door-step; but they could not forbear laughing at his queer appearance. For, as the King had kicked the mat on the edge, the dog was more than six feet long, and no bigger around than a lead-pencil; which brought its font legs so far from its rear legs that it could scarcely turn around in the room without getting tangled up.  \"But it is better than being a door-mat,\" said the dog; and the King and Queen agreed with him in this.  Then the King went away to tell the people he had found the dog again, and when he left the palace he slammed the front door behind him. The dog had started to follow the King out, so when the front door slammed it hit the poor animal so sharp a blow on the nose that it pushed his body together again; and, lo and behold! there was the dog in his natural shape, just as he was before the King kicked him.  After this the dog and the King agreed very well; for the King was careful not to kick, since he had recovered his temper, and the dog took care not to say anything that would provoke the King to anger.  And one day the dog saved the Kingdom and all the Valley of Mo from destruction, as I shall tell you another time.    _The Fourth Surprise_  THE PECULIAR PAINS OF FRUITCAKE ISLAND   Prince Zingle, who was the eldest of all the princes of the Valley of Mo, at one time became much irritated because the King, his father, would not allow him to milk the cow with the golden horns. This cow was a great favorite with the King, because she gave as large a quantity of ice-cream at a milking as an ordinary cow does of milk, and in the warm days this was an agreeable luxury. The King liked to keep the cow with the golden horns for his own use and that of the Queen; so Prince Zingle thought he was being abused, having a great fondness for ice-cream himself.  To be sure, there was the great fountain of ice-cream soda-water playing constantly in the courtyard, which was free to every one; but the Prince longed for what he could not have.  Therefore, being filled with anger against his father, the King, he wandered away until he chanced to come near to the castle of the Purple Dragon.  When the wicked monster saw the Prince, it decided that here was a splendid opportunity to make mischief; so it said, politely:  \"Good morning, King Zingle.\"  \"I am not a king--I am only a prince,\" replied Zingle.  \"What! not a king?\" exclaimed the Dragon, as if surprised; \"that is too bad.\"  \"I can never be a king while my father lives,\" continued the Prince, \"and it is impossible for him to die. So what can I do?\"  \"Since you ask my advice, I will tell you,\" answered the naughty Dragon. \"Down near Rootbeer River, where the peanut trees grow, is a very deep hole in the ground. You must get the King to go and look into this hole, and while he is leaning over the edge, push him in. Of course, he will not die, for that, as you say, is impossible; but no one will know where to find him. So, your father being out of the way, you will be king in his place.\"  \"That is surely good advice,\" said the Prince, \"and I will go and do it at once. Then the cow with the golden horns will be mine, and I shall become the Monarch of Mo.\"  The Prince turned to go back to the palace, and as soon as he was out of sight, the horrid Dragon laughed to think what a fool it had made of the boy.  When Zingle saw his father he called him aside and said:  \"Your Majesty, I have discovered something very funny at the bottom of the hole near the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16260"],["title","Nouveau moyen de préparer la couche sensible des plaques destinées à recevoir (#1)"],["body"," de l'huile et du rouge pour enlever toutes les traces de l'image qu'on efface.  On continue alors l'opération comme je viens de le dire plus haut pour la seconde préparation de la plaque neuve et à partir de l'emploi de l'alcool.   _Sur l'épreuve non fixée (mais dont la couche sensible a été enlevée comme à l'ordinaire, dans l'hyposulfite de soude)._  D'abord, il faut frotter la plaque avec de l'alcool et du rouge pour enlever les traces de l'huile qui a servi à faire l'épreuve précédente.  On continue ensuite comme il est indiqué plus haut pour la plaque neuve, et à partir de l'emploi de l'alcool.   TABLEAU RÉSUMÉ DES OPÉRATIONS.  _Première préparation._  1°. _Sublimé corrosif_ avec _tripoli_ d'abord, et _rouge_ ensuite, pour polir la plaque;  2°. _Cyanure de mercure chauffé_ et _séché_ avec du _coton_ et du _rouge_;  3°. _Huile acidulée_ avec _rouge_ pour polir la couche de mercure;  4°. _Or et platine chauffé_ et _séché_ avec du _coton_ et du _rouge_.   _Seconde préparation._  5°. _Huile acidulée_ avec _rouge_ pour polir la couche d'or et de platine;  6°. _Alcool absolu_ pour enlever le plus possible l'huile et le rouge;  7°. _Cyanure de mercure employé à froid_ et _frotté seulement_ avec du _coton_;  8°. _Huile frottée assez fortement_ et _égalisée_ en dernier lieu avec du _rouge saupoudré_.   _Sur l'épreuve fixée._  1°. _Acide nitrique_ à 2 degrés avec _rouge_ pour enlever les taches;  2°. _Huile_ avec _rouge_ pour enlever les traces d'image et pour polir.  Continuer ensuite comme plus haut, à partir du n°6, alcool, etc.   _Sur l'épreuve non fixée (dont la couche sensible a été enlevée avec l'hyposulfite de soude)._  _Alcool_ avec _rouge_ pour enlever les traces d'huile, et continuer comme plus haut, à partir du n°6, alcool, etc.   OBSERVATIONS.  _De l'iodage._  La couleur de l'épreuve dépend de la teinte que l'on donne à l'iodure métallique. On peut donc la varier à volonté; cependant la couleur _rose violâtre_ m'a paru la plus convenable.  Pour transmettre l'iode à la plaque, on peut remplacer la feuille de carton par un plateau de faïence dont on aura usé l'émail. L'iode transmis par ce moyen n'est pas décomposé.  Il est inutile, je dirai même nuisible, de chauffer la plaque avant de l'exposer à la vapeur de l'iode.   _Du lavage à l'hyposulfite de soude._  Pour enlever la couche sensible, il ne faut pas que la dissolution d'hyposulfite de soude soit trop forte, parce qu'alors elle voile les vigueurs. 60 grammes d'hyposulfite suffisent pour 1 litre d'eau distillée.   NOTES:  [1] Sur la plaque décapée au moyen de la couche d'eau, comme je l'ai indiqué, on obtient très-rapidement des épreuves d'une grande finesse, mais qui manquent aussi de modelé, à cause du peu d'épaisseur de la couche sensible.  [2] Tout le monde sait que la vapeur sèche du brome est plus favorable que celle qu'on obtient au moyen de l'eau bromée, car cette dernière a l'inconvénient d'entraîner avec elle de l'humidité qui se condense à la surface de la plaque. L'emploi de l'huile que j'indique plus loin neutralise cet effet et donne à la vapeur du brome étendu d'eau la même propriété qu'à celle du brome sec.  [3] Cela est tellement vrai que, si l'on fait une épreuve sur une plaque qui a été fixée plusieurs fois, on peut la laisser à l'exposition de la vapeur du brome autant de fois en plus du temps nécessaire qu'elle a reçu de différentes couches d'or.  [4] Je veux dire seulement que l'emploi de tous les métaux que j'indique plus loin est indispensable; mais la manière de les appliquer peut varier.  [5] Car, en multipliant ces éléments comme dans une pile, on augmente cette puissance, et l'on parvient ainsi à faire agir dans le même temps les radiations les plus paresseuses, telles que celles du rouge et du vert.  [6] L'huile de pétrole la plus convenable est d'un ton jaune-verdâtre, et prend, sous différents angles, des reflets azurés.  J'ai donné la préférence à cette huile sur les huiles fixes, parce qu'elle reste toujours limpide, quoique fortement acidulée. Le but que je me propose en employant une huile acidulée est de réduire les métaux en poussière et de retenir cette poussière à la surface de la plaque, en même temps de donner plus d'épaisseur à la couche par ses propriétés onctueuses; car le naphte qui résulte de la distillation de cette huile ne produit pas le même effet, parce qu'étant trop fluide, il entraîne la poussière des métaux. C'est par cette même raison que j'ai conseillé dernièrement l'emploi de l'_essence de lavande_, plutôt que celui de l'essence de térébenthine.  [7] Si je préfère, pour polir, le rouge aux autres substances, ce n'est pas que je lui reconnaisse une propriété photogénique, mais bien parce qu'il brunit mieux et qu'il aide à fixer la couche d'or qui n'est plus si susceptible de s'enlever par écailles lorsqu'on la chauffe trop.  Les plaques galvaniques, lorsqu'elles n'ont ni marbrures ni taches noires (ce qui arrivait quelquefois dans l'origine), reçoivent mieux que les autres l'application des métaux, et par conséquent le chlorure d'or y adhérant plus fortement ne s'enlève pas par écailles.  [8] Il faut avoir soin d'appuyer le moins possible, car autrement le rouge adhérerait à la plaque et formerait un voile général.  [9] Lorsque l'on opérera sur une plaque qui aura reçu longtemps à l'avance la première préparation, il faudra, avant d'employer l'huile acidulée et l'oxyde rouge, opérer comme je l'indique plus loin pour la plaque qui a reçu une épreuve fixée. Cette précaution est nécessaire pour détruire les taches que le temps pourrait avoir développées.     IMPRIMERIE DE BACHELIER,  RUE DU JARDINET, N° 12."]]]
