He protested against the censoriousness which was found connected with  peculiar claims of religious feelings. \"If any man among you seem to  be religious and bridleth not his tongue, but deceiveth his own  heart, this man's religion is vain.\" He protested against that spirit  which had crept into the Christian Brotherhood, truckling to the rich,  and despising the poor. \"If ye have respect of persons ye commit sin,  and are convinced of the law as transgressors.\" He protested against  that sentimental fatalism which induced men to throw the blame of  their own passions upon God. \"Let no man say, when he is tempted, I am  tempted of God; for God cannot tempt to evil; neither tempteth He any  man.\" He protested against that unreal religion of excitement which  diluted the earnestness of real religion in the enjoyment of  listening. \"Be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only; deceiving  your own souls.\" He protested against that trust in the correctness of  theological doctrine which neglected the cultivation of character.  \"What doth it profit, if a man _say_ that he hath faith, and have not  works? Can faith save him?\"   Read St. James's epistle through, this is the mind breathing through  it all:--all this _talk_ about religion, and spirituality--words,  words, words--nay, let us have _realities_.   It is well known that Luther complained of this epistle, that it did  not contain the Gospel; for men who are hampered by a system will  say--even of an inspired Apostle--that he does not teach the Gospel if  their own favourite doctrine be not the central subject of his  discourse; but St. James's reply seems spontaneously to suggest itself  to us. The Gospel! how can we speak of the Gospel, when the first  principles of _morality_ are forgotten? when Christians are excusing  themselves, and slandering one another? How can the superstructure of  Love and Faith be built, when the very foundations of human  character--Justice, Mercy, Truth--have not been laid?     1st. The license of the tongue.    2nd. The guilt of that license.   The first license given to the tongue is slander. I am not of course,  speaking now of that species of slander against which the law of libel  provides a remedy, but of that of which the Gospel alone takes  cognisance; for the worst injuries which man can do to man, are  precisely those which are too delicate for _law_ to deal with. We  consider therefore not the calumny which is reckoned such by the  moralities of an earthly court, but that which is found guilty by the  spiritualities of the courts of heaven--that is, the mind of God.   Now observe, this slander is compared in the text to poison--\"the  tongue is an unruly evil, full of deadly poison.\" The deadliest  poisons are those for which no test is known: there are poisons so  destructive that a single drop insinuated into the veins produces  death in three seconds, and yet no chemical science can separate that  virus from the contaminated blood, and show the metallic particles of  poison glittering palpably, and say, \"Behold, it is there!\"   In the drop of venom which distils from the sting of the smallest  insect, or the spikes of the nettle-leaf, there is concentrated the  quintessence of a poison so subtle that the microscope cannot  distinguish it, and yet so virulent that it can inflame the blood,  irritate the whole constitution, and convert day and night into  restless misery.   In St. James's day, as now, it would appear that there were idle men  and idle women, who went about from house to house, dropping slander  as they went, and yet you could not take up that slander and detect  the falsehood there. You could not evaporate the truth in the slow  process of the crucible, and then show the residuum of falsehood  glittering and visible. You could not fasten upon any word or  sentence, and say that it was calumny; for in order to constitute  slander it is not necessary that the word spoken should be false--half  truths are often more calumnious than whole falsehoods. It is not even  necessary that a word should be distinctly uttered; a dropped lip, an  arched eyebrow, a shrugged shoulder, a significant look, an  incredulous expression of countenance, nay, even an emphatic silence,  may do the work: and when the light and trifling thing which has done  the mischief has fluttered off, the venom is left behind, to work and  rankle, to inflame hearts, to fever human existence, and to poison  human society at the fountain springs of life. Very emphatically was  it said by one whose whole being had smarted under such affliction,  \"Adder's poison is under their lips.\"   The second license given to the tongue is in the way of persecution:  \"therewith curse we men which are made after the similitude of God.\"  \"We!\"--men who bear the name of Christ--curse our brethren! Christians  persecuted Christians. Thus even in St. James's age that spirit had  begun, the monstrous fact of Christian persecution; from that day it  has continued, through long centuries, up to the present time. The  Church of Christ assumed the office of denunciation, and except in the  first council, whose object was not to strain, but to relax the bonds  of brotherhood, not a council has met for eighteen centuries which has  not guarded each profession of belief by the too customary formula,  \"If any man maintain otherwise than this, let him be accursed.\"   Myriad, countless curses have echoed through those long ages; the  Church has forgotten her Master's spirit and called down fire from  heaven. A fearful thought to consider this as the spectacle on which  the eye of God has rested. He looks down upon the creatures He has  made, and hears everywhere the language of religious  imprecations:--and after all, who is proved right by curses?   The Church of Rome hurls her thunders against Protestants of every  denomination: the Calvinist scarcely recognises the Arminian as a  Christian: he who considers himself as the true Anglican, excludes  from the Church of Christ all but the adherents of his own orthodoxy;  every minister and congregation has its small circle, beyond which all  are heretics: nay even among that sect which is most lax as to the  dogmatic forms of truth, we find the Unitarian of the old school  denouncing the spiritualism of the new and rising school.   This is the state of things to which we are arrived. Sisters of  Charity refuse to permit an act of charity to be done by a Samaritan;  ministers of the Gospel fling the thunderbolts of the Lord; ignorant  hearers catch and exaggerate the spirit,--boys, girls, and women  shudder as one goes by, perhaps more holy than themselves, who adores  the same God, believes in the same Redeemer, struggles in the same  life-battle, and all this because they have been taught to look upon  him as an enemy of God.   There is a class of religious persons against whom this vehemence has  been especially directed. No one who can read the signs of the times  can help perceiving that we are on the eve of great changes, perhaps a  disruption of the Church of England. Unquestionably there has been a  large secession to the Church of Rome.   Now what has been the position of those who are about to take this  step? They have been taunted with dishonest reception of the wages of  the Church; a watch has been set over them: not a word they uttered in  private, or in public, but was given to the world by some religious  busy-body; there was not a visit which they paid, not a foolish dress  which they adopted, but became the subject of bitter scrutiny and  malevolent gossip. For years the religious press has denounced them  with a vehemence as virulent, but happily more impotent than that of  the Inquisition. There has been an anguish and an inward struggle  little suspected, endured by men who felt themselves outcasts in their  own society, and naturally looked for a home elsewhere.   We congratulate ourselves that the days of persecution are gone by;  but persecution is that which affixes penalties upon _views held_,  instead of upon _life led_. Is persecution _only_ fire and sword? But  suppose a man of sensitive feeling says, The sword is less sharp to me  than the slander: fire is less intolerable than the refusal of  sympathy!   Now let us bring this home; you rejoice that the faggot and the stake  are given up;--_you_ never persecuted--you leave that to the wicked  Church of Rome. Yes, you never burned a human being alive--you never  clapped your hands as the death-shriek proclaimed that the lion's fang  had gone home into the most vital part of the victim's frame; but did  you never rob him of his friends?--gravely shake your head and  oracularly insinuate that he was leading souls to hell?--chill the  affections of his family?--take from him his good name? Did you never  with delight see his Church placarded as the Man of Sin, and hear the  platform denunciations which branded it with the spiritual  abominations of the Apocalypse? Did you never find a malicious  pleasure in repeating all the miserable gossip with which religious  slander fastened upon his daily acts, his words, and even his  uncommunicated thoughts? Did you never forget that for a man to \"work  out his own salvation with fear and trembling\" is a matter difficult  enough to be laid upon a human spirit, without intruding into the most  sacred department of another's life--that namely, which lies between  himself and God? Did you never say that \"it was to be wished he should  go to Rome,\" until at last life became intolerable,--until he was  thrown more and more in upon himself; found himself, like his  Redeemer, in this world alone, but unable like his Redeemer, calmly to  repose upon the thought that his Father was with him? Then a stern  defiant"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16645"],["title","Sermons Preached at Brighton (#2)"],["body","took possession of his soul, and there burst from his  lips, or heart, the wish for _rest_--rest at any cost,--peace  anywhere, if even it is to be found only in the bosom of the Church of  Rome!    II. The guilt of this license.   The first evil consequence is the harm that a man does himself: \"so is  the tongue among the members, that it defiles the whole body.\" It is  not very obvious, in what way a man does himself harm by calumny. I  will take the simplest form in which this injury is done; it effects a  dissipation of spiritual energy. There are two ways in which the steam  of machinery may find an outlet for its force: it may work, and if so  it works silently; or it may escape, and that takes place loudly, in  air and noise. There are two ways in which the spiritual energy of a  man's soul may find its vent: it may express itself in action,  silently; or in words, noisily: but just so much of force as is thrown  into the one mode of expression, is taken from the other.   Few men suspect how much mere talk fritters away spiritual  energy,--that which should be spent in action, spends itself in words.  The fluent boaster is not the man who is steadiest before the enemy;  it is well said to him that his courage is better kept till it is  wanted. Loud utterance of virtuous indignation against evil from the  platform, or in the drawing-room, do not characterize the spiritual  giant: so much indignation as is expressed, has found vent, is wasted,  is taken away from the work of coping with evil; the man has so much  less left. And hence he who restrains that love of talk, lays up a  fund of spiritual strength.   With large significance, St. James declares, \"If any man offend not in  word, the same is a perfect man, able also to bridle the whole body.\"  He is entire, powerful, because he has not spent his strength. In  these days of loud profession, and bitter, fluent condemnation, it is  well for us to learn the divine force of silence. Remember Christ in  the Judgment Hall, the very Symbol and Incarnation of spiritual  strength; and yet when revilings were loud around Him and charges  multiplied, \"He held His peace.\"   2. The next feature in the guilt of calumny is its uncontrollable  character: \"the tongue can no man tame.\" You cannot arrest a  calumnious tongue, you cannot arrest the calumny itself; you may  refute a slanderer, you may trace home a slander to its source, you  may expose the author of it, you may by that exposure give a lesson so  severe as to make the repetition of the offence appear impossible; but  the fatal habit is incorrigible: to-morrow the tongue is at work  again.   Neither can you stop the consequences of a slander; you may publicly  prove its falsehood, you may sift every atom, explain and annihilate  it, and yet, years after you had thought that all had been disposed of  for ever, the mention of a name wakes up associations in the mind of  some one who heard the calumny, but never heard or never attended to  the refutation, or who has only a vague and confused recollection of  the whole, and he asks the question doubtfully, \"But were there not  some suspicious circumstances connected with him?\"   It is like the Greek fire used in ancient warfare, which burnt  unquenched beneath the water, or like the weeds which when you have  extirpated them in one place are sprouting forth vigorously in another  spot, at the distance of many hundred yards; or, to use the metaphor  of St. James himself, it is like the wheel which catches fire as it  goes, and burns with a fiercer conflagration as its own speed  increases; \"it sets on fire the whole course of nature\" (literally,  the wheel of nature). You may tame the wild beast, the conflagration  of the American forest will cease when all the timber and the dry  underwood is consumed; but you cannot arrest the progress of that  cruel word which you uttered carelessly yesterday or this  morning,--which you will utter perhaps, before you have passed from  this church one hundred yards: that will go on slaying, poisoning,  burning beyond your own control, now and for ever.   3. The third element of guilt lies in the unnaturalness of calumny.  \"My brethren, these things ought not so to be;\" _ought not_--that is,  they are unnatural. That this is St. James's meaning is evident from  the second illustration which follows: \"Doth a fountain send forth at  the same place, sweet water and bitter?\" \"Can the fig tree, my  brethren, bear olive berries, or a vine, figs?\"   There is apparently in these metaphors little that affords an argument  against slander; the motive which they suggest would appear to many  far-fetched and of small cogency; but to one who looks on this world  as a vast whole, and who has recognised the moral law as only a part  of the great law of the universe, harmoniously blending with the  whole, illustrations such as these are the most powerful of all  arguments. The truest definition of evil is that which represents it  as something contrary to nature: evil is evil, because it is  unnatural; a vine which should bear olive berries, an eye to which  blue seems yellow, would be diseased: an unnatural mother, an  unnatural son, an unnatural act, are the strongest terms of  condemnation. It is this view which Christianity gives of moral evil:  the teaching of Christ was the recall of man to nature, not an  infusion of something new into Humanity. Christ came to call out all  the principles and powers of human nature, to restore the natural  equilibrium of all our faculties; not to call us back to our own  individual selfish nature, but to human nature as it is in God's  ideal--the perfect type which is to be realised in us. Christianity is  the regeneration of our whole nature, not the destruction of one atom  of it.   Now the nature of man is to adore God and to love what is god-like in  man. The office of the tongue is to bless. Slander is guilty because  it contradicts this; yet even in slander itself, perversion as it is,  the interest of man in man is still distinguishable. What is it but  perverted interest which makes the acts, and words, and thoughts of  his brethren, even in their evil, a matter of such strange delight?  Remember therefore, this contradicts your nature and your destiny; to  speak ill of others makes you a monster in God's world: get the habit  of slander, and then there is not a stream which bubbles fresh from  the heart of nature,--there is not a tree that silently brings forth  its genial fruit in its appointed season,--which does not rebuke and  proclaim you to be a monstrous anomaly in God's world.   4. The fourth point of guilt is the diabolical character of slander;  the tongue \"is set on fire of hell.\" Now, this is no mere strong  expression--no mere indignant vituperation--it contains deep and  emphatic meaning.   The apostle means literally what he says, slander is diabolical. The  first illustration we give of this is contained in the very meaning of  the word devil. \"Devil,\" in the original, means traducer or slanderer.  The first introduction of a demon spirit is found connected with a  slanderous insinuation against the Almighty, implying that His command  had been given in envy of His creature: \"for God doth know that in the  day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be  as gods, knowing good and evil.\"   In the magnificent imagery of the book of Job, the accuser is  introduced with a demoniacal and malignant sneer, attributing the  excellence of a good man to interested motives; \"Doth Job serve God  for naught?\" There is another mode in which the fearful accuracy of  St. James's charge may be demonstrated. There is one state only from  which there is said to be no recovery--there is but one sin that is  called unpardonable. The Pharisees beheld the works of Jesus. They  could not deny that they were good works, they could not deny that  they were miracles of beneficence, but rather than acknowledge that  they were done by a good man through the co-operation of a Divine  spirit, they preferred to account for them by the wildest and most  incredible hypothesis; they said they were done by the power of  Beelzebub, the prince of the devils. It was upon this occasion that  our Redeemer said with solemn meaning, \"For every idle word that men  shall speak, they shall give account in the day of judgment.\" It was  then that He said, for a word spoken against the Holy Ghost there is  no forgiveness in this world, or in the world to come.   Our own hearts respond to the truth of this--to call evil, good, and  good, evil--to see the Divinest good, and call it Satanic evil--below  this lowest deep there is _not_ a lower still. There is no cure for  mortification of the flesh--there is no remedy for ossification of the  heart. Oh! that miserable state, when to the jaundiced eye all good  transforms itself into evil, and the very instruments of health  become the poison of disease. Beware of every approach of  this!--Beware of that spirit which controversy fosters, of watching  only for the evil in the character of an antagonist!--Beware of that  habit which becomes the slanderer's life, of magnifying every speck of  evil and closing the eye to goodness!--till at last men arrive at the  state in which generous, universal love (which is heaven) becomes  impossible, and a suspicious, universal hate takes possession of the  heart, and _that_ is hell!   There is one peculiar manifestation of this spirit to which I desire  specially to direct your attention.   The politics of the community are guided by the political press. The  religious views of a vast number are formed by that portion of the  press which is called religious; it becomes, therefore, a matter of  deepest interest to inquire what is the spirit of that \"religious  press.\" I am not asking you what are the views maintained--whether  Evangelical, Anglican, or Romish--but what is the _spirit_ of that  fountain from which the"]]]
