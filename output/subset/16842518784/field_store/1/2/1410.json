Which one of you stirred this up?\" But the guilty face at the tail of the romping procession was the face of old Asher.  Radiantly triumphant the old Doctor swung little John Leslie 3rd to his shoulder and faced his laughing family and as old Annie appeared with a steaming tray--he seized a mug of cider and held it high aloft.  \"To the ruddy warmth of the Christmas log and the Christmas home spirit--\" he cried--\"to the home-keeping hearts of the country-side! Gentlemen--I give you--A Country home and a Country Christmas! May more good folk come to know them!\" And little John Leslie cried hoarsely--  \"Hooray, grandpop, hooray for a Country Christmas!\"  Carelessly alive to the merry spirit of the night, the jester presently adjusted a flute which hung from his shoulder by a scarlet cord and lazily piping a Christmas air, wandered to another room--to come suddenly upon a forgotten playmate of his boyhood days.  \"It--it can't be!\" he reflected in startled interest. \"It surely can't be Madge Hildreth!\"  But Madge Hildreth it surely was, spreading the satin folds of his grandmother's crimson gown in mocking courtesy. Moreover it was not the awkward, ragged elfish little gipsy who had tormented his debonair boyhood with her shy ardent worship of himself and his daring exploits, but instead a winsome vision of Christmas color and Christmas cheer, holly-red of cheek, with flashes of scarlet holly in her night black hair and eyes whose unfathomable dusk reflected no single hint of that old, wild worship slumbering still in the girl's rebellious heart.  \"And the symbolism of this stunning make-up?\" queried Ralph after a while, lazily admiring.  The girl's eyes flashed.  \"To-night, if you please,\" she said, \"I am the spirit of the old-fashioned Christmas who dwells in the holly heart of the evergreen wood. A _country_ Christmas, ruddy-cheeked and cheerful and rugged like the winter holly--simple and old-fashioned and hallowed with memories like this bright soft crimson gown!\"  Well, she had been a queer, fanciful youngster too, Doctor Ralph remembered, always passionately aquiver with a wild sylvan poetry and over-fond of book-lore like her father. Mischievously glancing at a spray of mistletoe above the girl's dark head, he stepped forward with the careless gallantry that had won him many a kindly glance from pretty eyes and was strangely to fail him now. For at the look in Madge's calm eyes, he drew back, stammering.  \"I--I beg your pardon!\" said Doctor Ralph.  Later as he stood thoughtfully by his bedroom window, staring queerly at the wind-beaten elms, he found himself repeating Madge Hildreth's words. \"Ruddy-cheeked and rugged and cheerful!\"--indeed--this unforgettable Christmas eve. Yes--she was right. Had he not often heard his father say that the Christmas season epitomized all the rugged sympathy and heartiness and health of the country year! To-night the blazing Yule-log, his mother's face--how white her hair was growing, thought Doctor Ralph with a sudden tightening of his throat--all of these memories had strummed forgotten and finer chords. And darkly foiling the homely brightness came the picture of rushing, overstrung, bundle-laden city crowds, of shop-girls white and weary, of store-heaps of cedar and holly sapped by electric glare. Rush and strain and worry--yes--and a spirit of grudging! How unlike the Christmas peace of this white, wind-world outside his window! So Doctor Ralph went to bed with a sigh and a shrug--to listen while the sleety boughs tapping at his windows roused ghostly phantoms of his boyhood. Falling asleep, he dreamt that pretty Madge Hildreth had lightly waved a Christmas wand of crimson above his head and dispelled his weariness and discontent.     IV  Embers   And in the morning--there was the royal glitter of a Christmas ice-storm to bring boyhood memories crowding again, boughs sheathed in crystal armor and the old barn roof aglaze with ice. Yes--Ralph thrilled--and there were the Christmas bunches of oats on the fences and trees and the roof of the barn--how well he remembered! For the old Doctor loved this Christmas custom too and never forgot the Christmas birds. And to-day--why of course--there would be double allowances of food for the cattle and horses, for old Toby the cat and Rover the dog. Hadn't Ralph once performed this cherished Christmas task himself!  But now, clamoring madly at his door was a romping swarm of youngsters eager to show Uncle Ralph the Christmas tree which, though he had helped to trim it the night before, he inspected in great surprise. And here in his chair by another Yule-log he found Roger, staring wide-eyed at the glittering tree with his thin little arms full of Christmas gifts. Near him was Sister Madge whose black eyes, Ralph saw with approval, were very soft and gentle, and beyond in the coffee-fragrant dining-room Aunt Ellen and old Annie conspired together over a mammoth breakfast table decked with holly.  \"Oh, John, dear,\" Ralph heard his mother say as the Doctor came in, \"I've always said that Christmas is a mother's day. Wasn't the first Christmas a mother's Christmas and the very first tree--a mother's tree?\" and then the Doctor's scandalized retort--\"Now--now, now, see here, Mother Ellen, it's a father's day, too, don't you forget that!\"  And so on to the Christmas twilight through a day of romping youngsters and blazing Yule-logs, of Christmas gifts and Christmas greetings--of a haunting shame for Doctor Ralph at the memory of the wild Christmas he had planned to spend with Griffin and Edwards.  With the coming of the broad shadows which lay among the stiff, ice-fringed spruces like iris velvet, Doctor Ralph's nieces and nephews went flying out to help old Asher feed the stock. By the quiet fire the Doctor beckoned Ralph.  \"Suppose, my boy,\" he said, \"suppose you take a look at the little lad's leg here. I've sometimes wondered what you would think of it.\"  Coloring a little at his father's deferential tone Ralph turned the stocking back from the pitiful shrunken limb and bent over it, his dark face keen and grave. And now with the surgeon uppermost, Roger fancied Doctor Ralph's handsome eyes were nothing like so tired. Save for the crackle of the fire and the tick of the great clock, there was silence in the firelit room and presently Roger caught something in Doctor Ralph's thoughtful face that made his heart leap wildly.  \"An operation,\" said the young Doctor suddenly--and halted, meeting his father's eyes significantly.  \"You are sure!\" insisted the old Doctor slowly. \"In my day, it was impossible--quite impossible.\"  \"Times change,\" said the younger man. \"I have performed such an operation successfully myself. I feel confident, sir--\" but Roger had caught his hand now with a sob that echoed wildly through the quiet room.  \"Oh, Doctor Ralph,\" he blurted with blazing, agonized eyes, \"you don't--you can't mean, sir, that I'll walk and run like other boys--and--and climb the Cedar King--\" his voice broke in a passionate fit of weeping.  \"Yes,\" said Doctor Ralph, huskily, \"I mean just that. Dad and I, little man, we're going to do what we can.\"  By the window Sister Madge buried her face in her hands.  \"Come, come, now Sister Madge,\" came the Doctor's kindly voice a little later, \"you've cried enough, lass. Roger is fretting about you and Doctor Ralph here, he says he's going to take you for a little sleigh-ride if you'll honor him by going.\"  Outside a Christmas moon rode high above a sparkling ice-bright world and as the sleigh shot away into its quiet glory, Ralph, meeting the dark, tear-bright eyes of Sister Madge, tucked the robes closer about her with a hand that shook a little.  \"'Gipsy' Hildreth!\" he said suddenly, smiling, but the hated nickname to-night was almost a caress. \"Tell me,\" Ralph's voice was very grave--\"You've been sewing? Mother spoke of it.\"  \"There was nothing else,\" said Sister Madge. \"I could not leave Roger.\"  \"And now Mother wants you to stay on with her. You--you'll do that?\"  \"She is very lonely,\" said Madge uncertainly and Ralph bit his lip.  \"Mother lonely!\" he said. \"She didn't tell me that.\"  \"Roger is wild to stay,\" went on Madge, looking away--\"but I--oh--I fear it is only their wonderful kindness. Still there's the Doctor's rheumatism--and he does need some one to keep his books.\"  \"Rheumatism!\" said Ralph sharply.  \"Yes,\" nodded Madge in surprise--\"didn't you know. It's been pretty bad this winter. He's been thinking some of breaking in young Doctor Price to take part of his practise now and perhaps all of it later.\"  \"Price!\" broke out Ralph indignantly. \"Oh--that's absurd! Price couldn't possibly swing Dad's work. He's not clever enough.\"  \"He's the only one there is,\" said Madge and Ralph fell silent.  All about them lay a glittering moonlit country of peaceful, firelit homes and snowy hills--of long quiet roads and shadowy trees and presently Ralph spoke again.  \"You like all this,\" he said abruptly, \"the quiet--the country--and all of it?\"  Sister Madge's black eyes glowed.  \"After all,\" she said, \"is it not the only way to live? This scent of the pine, the long white road, the wild-fire of the winter sunset and the wind and the hills--are they not God-made messages of mystery to man? Life among man-made things--like your cities--seems somehow to exaggerate the importance of man the maker.

Lieutenant-Colonel Édouard Réquin of the French General Staff, who was at General Foch's side from the day Foch was made commander of an army, has been especially kind to me in this undertaking; I am indebted to him, not only for many anecdotes and suggestions, but also for his patience in reading my manuscript for verification (or correction) of its details and its essential truthfulness.  And I want especially to record my gratefulness to M. Antonin Barthélemy, French Consul at Chicago, the extent and quality of whose helpfulness, not alone on this but on many occasions, I shall never be able to describe.  Through him the Spirit of France has been potent in our community.  Thus aided and encouraged, I have done what I could to set before my countrymen a sketch of the great, dominant figure of the World War.  The thing about Foch that most impresses us as we come to know him is not primarily his greatness as a military genius, but his greatness as a spiritual force.  Those identical qualities in him which saved the world in war, will serve it no less in peace--if we study them to good purpose.  As a leader of men, his principles need little, if any, adaptation to meet the requirements of the re-born world from which, we hope, he has banished the sword.  Not to those only who would or who must captain their fellows, but to every individual soul fighting alone against weakness and despair and other foes, his life-story brings a rising tide of new courage, new strength, new faith.  For the young man or woman struggling with the principles of success; for the man or woman of middle life, fearful that the time for great service has gone by; to the preacher and the teacher and other moulders of ideals--to these, and to many more, he speaks at least as thrillingly as to the soldier.  This is what I have tried to make clear in my simple sketch here offered.     I  WHERE HE WAS BORN  Ferdinand Foch was born at Tarbes on October 2, 1851.  His father, of good old Pyrenean stock and modest fortune, was a provincial official whose office corresponded to that of secretary of state for one of our commonwealths.  So the family lived in Tarbes, the capital of the department called the Upper Pyrénées.  The mother of Ferdinand was Sophie Dupré, born at Argèles, twenty miles south of Tarbes, nearer the Spanish border.  Her father had been made a chevalier of the empire by Napoleon I for services in the war with Spain, and the great Emperor's memory was piously venerated in Sophie Dupré's new home as it had been in her old one.  So her first-born son may be said to have inherited that passion for Napoleon which has characterized his life and played so great a part in making him what he is.  There was a little sister in the family which welcomed Ferdinand.  And in course of time two other boys came.  [Illustration: The Room in Which Ferdinand Foch was Born.]  [Illustration: The House in Tarbes Where Foch was Born.]  These four children led the ordinary life of happy young folks in France.  But there was much in their surroundings that was richly colorful, romantic.  Probably they took it all for granted, the way children (and many who are not children) take their near and intimate world.  But even if they did, it must have had its deep effect upon them.  To begin with, there was Tarbes.  Tarbes is a very ancient city.  It is twenty-five miles southeast of Pau, where Henry of Navarre made his dramatic entry upon a highly dramatic career, and just half that distance northeast of Lourdes, whose famous pilgrimages began when Ferdinand Foch was a little boy of seven.  He must have heard many soul-stirring tales about little Bernadette, the peasant girl to whom the grotto's miraculous qualities were revealed by the Virgin, and whose stories were weighed by the Bishop of Tarbes before the Catholic Church sponsored them.  The procession of sufferers through Tarbes on their way to Lourdes, and the joyful return of many, must have been part of the background of Ferdinand Foch's young days.  Many important highways converge at Tarbes, which lies in a rich, elevated plain on the left bank of the River Adour.  The town now has some 30,000 inhabitants, but when Ferdinand Foch was a little boy it had fewer than half that many.  For many centuries of eventful history it has consisted principally of one very long street, running east and west over so wide a stretch of territory that the town was called Tarbes-the-Long.  Here and there this \"main street\" is crossed by little streets running north and south and giving glimpses of mountains, green fields and orchards; and many of these are threaded by tiny waterways--small, meandering children of the Adour, which take themselves where they will, like the chickens in France, and nobody minds having to step over or around them, or building his house to humor their vagaries.  Tarbes was a prominent city of Gaul under the Romans.  They, who could always be trusted to make the most of anything of the nature of baths, seem to have been duly appreciative of the hot springs in which that region abounds.  But nothing of stirring importance happened at or near Tarbes until after the battle of Poitiers (732), when the Saracens were falling back after the terrible defeat dealt them by Charles Martel.  Sullen and vengeful, they were pillaging and destroying as they went, and probably none of the communities through which they passed felt able to offer resistance to their depredations--until they got to Tarbes.  And there a valiant priest named Missolin hastily assembled some of the men of the vicinity and gave the infidels a good drubbing--killing many and hastening the flight, over the mountains, of the rest.  This encounter took place on a plain a little to the south of Tarbes which is still called the Heath of the Moors.  When Ferdinand Foch was a little boy, more than eleven hundred years after that battle, it was not uncommon for the spade or plowshare of some husbandman on the heath to uncover bones of Christian or infidel slain in what was probably the last conflict fought on French soil to preserve France against the Saracens.  And there may still have been living some old, old men or women who could tell Ferdinand stories of the 24th of May (anniversary of the battle) as it was observed each year until the Revolution of 1789.  At the southern extremity of the battlefield there stood for many generations a gigantic equestrian statue, of wood, representing the holy warrior, Missolin, rallying his flock to rout the unbelievers.  And in the presence of a great concourse singing songs of grateful praise to Missolin, his statue was crowned with garlands by young maidens wearing the picturesque gala dress of that vicinity.  Some forty-odd years after Missolin's victory, Charlemagne went with his twelve knights and his great army through Tarbes on his way to Spain to fight the Moors.  And when that ill-starred expedition was defeated and its warriors bold were fleeing back to France, Roland--so the story goes--finding no pass in the Pyrénées where he needed one desperately, cleaved one with his sword Durandal.  High up among the clouds (almost 10,000 feet) is that Breach of Roland--200 feet wide, 330 feet deep, and 165 feet long.  A good slice-out for a single stroke!  And when Roland had cut it, he dashed through it and across the chasm, his horse making a clean jump to the French side of the mountains.  That no one might ever doubt this, the horse thoughtfully left the mark of one iron-shod hoof clearly imprinted in the rock just where he cleared it, and where it is still shown to the curious and the stout of wind.  It is a pity to remember that, in spite of such prowess of knight and devotion of beast.  Roland perished on his flight from Spain.  But, like all brave warriors, he became mightier in death even than he had been in life, and furnished an ideal of valor which animated the most chivalrous youth of all Europe, throughout many centuries.  With such traditions is the country round about Tarbes impregnated.  It has been suggested that the name Foch (which, by the way, is pronounced as if it rhymed with \"hush\") is derived from Foix--a town some sixty miles east of St. Gaudens, near which was the ancestral home of the Foch family.  Whatever the relatives of Ferdinand may have thought of this as a probability, it is certain that Ferdinand was well nurtured in the history of Foix and especially in those phases of it that Froissart relates.  Froissart, the genial gossip who first courted the favor of kings and princes and then was gently entreated by them so that his writing of them might be to their renown, was on his way to Blois when he heard of the magnificence of Gaston Phoebus, Count of Foix.  Whereupon the chronicler turned him about and jogged on his way to Foix.  Gaston Phoebus was not there, but at Orthez--150 miles west and north--and, nothing daunted, to Orthez went Froissart, by way of Tarbes, traveling in company with a knight named Espaing de Lyon, who was a graphic and charmful raconteur thoroughly acquainted with the country through which they were journeying.  A fine, \"that-reminds-me\" gentleman was Espaing, and every turn of the road brought to his mind some stirring tale or doughty legend.  \"Sainte Marie!\" Froissart cried.  \"How pleasant are your tales, and how much do they profit me while you relate them.  They shall all be set down in the history I am writing.\"  So they were!  And of all Froissart's incomparable recitals, none are more fascinating than those of the countryside Ferdinand Foch grew up in.     II  BOYHOOD SURROUNDINGS  The country round about Tarbes has long been famed for its horses of an Arabian breed especially suitable for cavalry.  Practically all the farmers of the region raised these fine, fleet animals.  There was a great stud-farm on the"]]]
