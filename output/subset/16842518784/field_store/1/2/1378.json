With some few and comparatively unimportant exceptions, the map of England remains to-day in this respect what those races made it more than a thousand years ago.  8. Climate.  With regard to the climate of England,--its insular form, geographical position, and its exposure to the warm currents of the Gulf Stream give it a temperature generally free from great extremes of heat or cold.  On this account, it is favorable to the full and healthy development of both animal and vegetable life.  Nowhere is greater vigor or longevity found.  Charles II said that he was convinced that there was not a country in the world so far as he knew, where one could spend so much time out of doors comfortably as in England.  9. Industrial Division of England.  From an industrial and historical point of view, the country falls into two divisions.  Let a line be drawn from Hull, on the northeast coast, to Leicester, in the Midlands, and thence to Exmouth, on the southwest coast.  (See map on p. 10.)  On the upper or northwest side of that line will lie the coal and iron which constitute the greater part of the mineral wealth and form the basis of the manufacturing industry of England; here too are all the largest towns except London.  On the lower or southeast side of the line there will be a comparatively level surface of rich agricultural land, and most of the fine old cathedral cities with their historic associations; in a world, the England of the past as contrasted with modern and democratic England, that part which has grown up since the introduction of steam.  10. Eastern and Western Britain compared.  As the southern and eastern coasts of Britain were in most direct communication with the Continent, and were first settled, they continued until modern times to be the wealthiest, most civilized, and progressive part of the island.  Much of the western portion is a rough, wild country.  To it the East Britons retreated, keeping their primitive customs and language, as in Wales and Cornwall.  In all the great movements of religious or political reform, up to the middle of the seventeenth century, we find that the people of the eastern half of the island were usually on the side of a larger measure of liberty; while those of the western half were generally in favor of increasing the power of the King and the Church.  11. Influence of the Island Form on the Roman Invasion  Geologists tell us that Great Britain was once connected with the mainland of western Europe.  It was fortunate for Britain that this connection was severed and that it became an island.  We see an illustration of this advantage in the case of the Roman invasion.  It was easy for the Romans to march great armies into Gaul and take complete possession of that country, but it was with no little difficulty that they sent fleets across the tempestuous waters of the Channel.  This may have been one reason why they never succeeded in permanently establishing their language and their laws in the island of Britain.  It is true that they conquered and held it for several centuries, but they never destroyed its individuality,--they never Latinized it as they did France and Spain.  12. Influence of the Island Form on the Saxon Invasion.  In like manner, when the northern tribes of Europe overran the Roman Empire, they found themselves, in some measure, shut out from Britain by its wall of sea.  The Jutes, Saxons, and Angles could not enter it in countless hordes, but only in small numbers and by occasional attacks.  Because of this, the invaders could only drive back the Britons by slow degrees, and they never entirely crushed them.  Again, the conquerers could not build up a strong, united kinigdom, but they had to content themselves with establishing a number of petty kingdoms which were constantly at war with each other.  Later, the whole of England became subject to a sing sovereign.  But the chief men of the separate kingdoms, which had now become simply shires or counties, retained a certain degree of control over the government. This prevented the royal power from becoming the unchecked will of an arbitrary ruler.  Finally, it may be said that the isolation of England had much to do with the development of the strong individual character of its people.  13. Influence of the Island Form on the Danes and Normans.  In the course of the ninth, tenth, and eleventh centuries the Danes invaded England, but the sea prevented their coming all at once and with overwhelming force.  They got possession of the throne (S63) and permanently established themselves in the northern half of the country.  The English, however, held their own so well that the Danes were eventually compelled to unite with them.  Even when the Normans invaded England and conquered it (SS74, 107), they felt obliged to make many concessions to both the English and the Danes.  The result was that every invasion of the island ended in a compromise, so that no one race ever got complete predominance.  In time all the elements mingled and became one people.  14. Influence of the Channel in Later History.  Furthermore, the immense protective value of the Channel to England may be traced down to our own day.  In the great crisis when Simon de Montfort was fighting (1264) to secure parliamentary representation for the people (S213), King Henry III sought help from France.  The French monarcy got a fleet ready to send to England, but bad weather held it back, and Henry was obliged to concede De Montfort's demands for reform.[1]  [1] W. Stubb's \"Select Charters,\" p. 401  Again, when the Spanish Armada swooped down upn England (1588) a terrible tempest dispersed a part of the enemy's fleet.  Many of the vessels were wrecked (S399) and only a few were left to creep back, crippled and disheartened, to the ports of Spain.  When Queen Elizabeth publicly thanked the leaders of her valiant navy for what they had done to repel the Spanish forces, she also acknowledged how much England owed to the protective power of wind and wave.  The same elements taught Napoleon a lesson which he never forgot.  He had carefully planned an expedition against England (S557), but violent and long-continued storms compelled him to abandon the hazardous undertaking (1804).  The great French commander felt himself invincible on land, but he was obliged to confess that \"a few leagues of salt water\" had completely out-generaled him.  In fact, ever since England organized a regular navy (1512) the encircling arms of the ocean have been her closest and surest friend. They have exempted her from keeping up a large standing army and so preserved her from the danger of military despotism at home.  They too have made her the greatest sea power,[1] and, at the same time, the greatest colonizing power[2] the world has yet seen.  They have also made her the greatest commercial power on the globe.[3]  [1] The English navy far outranks that of any other nation in the number of its warships. [2] The English colonial possessions and \"spheres of influence\" cover an area of more than 11,400,000 square miles.  (See map between pp. 422, 423.) [3] The total commerce of the United Kingdom in 1910 was nearly 912,000,000 pounds and that of the British Empire exceeded 1,990,680,000 pounds.  It is true that the use of steam for vessels of war has diminished the natural protective service of the Channel, since a hostile fleet can now move against England in almost any weather.  Still, the \"silver streak,\" as the English call that waterway, will always remain, in some degree, a defense against sudden invasion, except, of course, from a squadron of military airships.  15. England as a Commercial Center.  In closing this period, the position of England, with respect to facilities for commerce, deserves particular attention.  In the first place the country has many excellent harbors; next, it is situated in the ocean which is the great highway between the two continents having the highest civilization and the most constant intercourse.  Finally, a glance at the maps on pages 185 and 420 will show that geographically England is located at about the center of the land masses of the globe.  It is evident that a large island so placed stands in the favorable position for easy and rapid trade communications with every quarter of the world.  For this reason England has been able to attain, and thus far to maintain, the highest rank among maritime and commercial powers.  It is true that since the opening of the Suez Canal (1869) the trade with the Indies, China, and Japan has considerably changed. Many cargoes of teas, silks, spices, and other Eastern products, which formerly went to London, Liverpool, or Southampton, to be reshipped to different countries of Europe, now pass by other routes direct to the consumer.  Furthermore, it is a question what effect the completion of the Panama Canal will have on English trade in parts of the Pacific. But for the present England retains her supremacy as the great carrier and distributor of the productions of the earth,--a fact which has had a very decided influence on her history, and on her relations with other nations, both in peace and war.

Fuller's account of the elder Marvell is too good to be passed over:--     \"He afterwards became Minister at Hull, where for his lifetime he was    well beloved. Most facetious in discourse, yet grave in his carriage,    a most excellent preacher who, like a good husband, never broached    what he had new brewed, but preached what he had pre-studied some    competent time before. Insomuch that he was wont to say that he would    cross the common proverb which called Saturday the working-day and    Monday the holyday of preachers. It happened that Anno Dom. 1640,    Jan. 23, crossing Humber in a Barrow boat, the same was sandwarpt,    and he was drowned therein (with Mrs. Skinner, daughter to Sir Edward    Coke, a very religious gentlewoman) by the carelessness, not to say    drunkenness of the boatmen, to the great grief of all good men. His    excellent comment upon St. Peter is daily desired and expected, if    the envy and covetousness of private persons _for their own use_    deprive not the public of the benefit thereof.\"[6:1]  This good man, to whom perhaps, remembering the date of his death, the words may apply, _Tu vero felix non vitæ tantum claritate sed etiam opportunitate mortis_, was married at Cherry Burton, on the 22nd of October 1612, to Anne Pease, a member of a family destined to become widely known throughout the north of England. Of this marriage there were five children, all born at Winestead, viz. three daughters, Anne, Mary, and Elizabeth, and two sons, Andrew and John, the latter of whom died a year after his birth, and was buried at Winestead on the 20th September 1624.  The three daughters married respectively James Blaydes of Sutton, Yorkshire, on the 29th of December 1633; Edmund Popple, afterwards Sheriff of Hull, on the 18th of August 1636; and Robert More. Anne's eldest son, Joseph Blaydes, was Mayor of Hull in 1702, having married the daughter of a preceding Mayor in 1698. The descendants of this branch still flourish. The Popples also had children, one of whom, William Popple, was a correspondent of his uncle the poet's, and a merchant of repute, who became in 1696 Secretary to the Board of Trade, and the friend of the most famous man who ever sat at the table of that Board, John Locke. A son of this William Popple led a very comfortable eighteenth-century life, which is in strong contrast with that of his grand-uncle, for, having entered the Cofferers' Office about 1730, he was made seven years later Solicitor and Clerk of the Reports to the Commissioners of Trade and Plantations, and in 1745 became in succession to a relative, one Alured Popple, Governor of the Bermudas, a post he retained until his death, which occurred not      \"Where the remote Bermudas ride      In the ocean's bosom unespied,\"  but at his house in Hampstead. So well placed and idle a gentleman was almost bound to be a bad poet and worse dramatist, and this William Popple was both.  Marvell's third sister, Elizabeth, does not seem to have had issue, a certain Thomas More, or Moore, a Fellow of Magdalen College, Cambridge, whose name occurs in family records, being her stepson.  In the latter part of 1624 the elder Marvell resigned the living of Winestead, and took up the duties of schoolmaster and lecturer, or preacher, at Hull. Important duties they were, for the old Grammar School of Hull dates back to 1486, and may boast of a long career of usefulness, never having fallen into that condition of decay and disrepute from which so many similar endowments have been of late years rescued by the beneficent and, of course, abused action of the Charity Commissioners. Andrew Marvell the elder succeeded to and was succeeded by eminent headmasters. Trinity Church, where the poet's father preached on Sundays to crowded and interested congregations, was then what it still is, though restored by Scott, one of the great churches in the north of England.  The Rev. Andrew Marvell made his mark upon Hull. Mr. Grosart, who lacked nothing but the curb upon a too exuberant vocabulary, a little less enthusiasm and a great deal more discretion, to be a model editor, tells us in his invaluable edition of _The Complete Works in Verse and Prose of Andrew Marvell, M.P._,[8:1] that he had read a number of the elder Marvell's manuscripts, consisting of sermons and miscellaneous papers, from which Mr. Grosart proceeds:--     \"I gather three things.     \"(1) That he was a man of a very brave, fearlessly outspoken    character. Some of his practical applications in his sermons before    the Magistrates are daring in their directness of reproof, and    melting in their wistfulness of entreaty.     \"(2) That he was a well-read man. His Sermons are as full of    classical and patristic allusions and pat sayings from the most    occult literatures as even Bishop Andrewes.     \"(3) That he was a man of tireless activity. Besides the two offices    named, he became head of one of the Great Hospitals of the Town    (Charter House), and in an address to the Governors placed before    them a prescient and statesmanlike plan for the better management of    its revenues, and for the foundation of a Free Public Library to be    accessible to all.\"  When at a later day, and in the midst of a fierce controversy, Andrew Marvell wrote of the clergy as \"the reserve of our Christianity,\" he doubtless had such men as his father in his mind and memory.  It was at the old Grammar School of Hull, and with his father as his _Orbilius_, that Marvell was initiated into the mysteries of the Latin grammar, and was, as he tells us, put to his        \"Montibus, inquit, erunt; et erant submontibus illis;       Risit Atlantiades; et me mihi, perfide, prodis?       Me mihi prodis? ait.     \"For as I remember this scanning was a liberal art that we learn'd at    Grammar School, and to scan verses as he does the Author's prose    before we did or were obliged to understand them.\"[8:2]  Irrational methods have often amazingly good results, and the Hull Grammar School provided its head-master's only son with the rudiments of learning, thus enabling him to become in after years what John Milton himself, the author of that terrible _Treatise on Education_ addressed to Mr. Hartlibb, affirmed Andrew Marvell to be in a written testimonial, \"a scholar, and well-read in the Latin and Greek authors.\"  Attached to the Grammar School there was \"a great garden,\" renowned for its wall-fruit and flowers; so by leaving Winestead behind, our \"garden-poet,\" that was to be, was not deprived of inspiration.  Apart from these meagre facts, we know nothing of Marvell's boyhood at Hull. His clerical foe, Dr. Parker, afterwards Bishop of Oxford, writes contemptuously of \"an hunger-starved whelp of a country vicar,\" and in another passage, which undoubtedly refers to Marvell, he speaks of \"an unhappy education among Boatswains and Cabin-boys,\" whose unsavoury phrases, he goes on to suggest, Marvell picked up in his childhood. But truth need not be looked for in controversial pages. The best argument for a married clergy is to be found, for Englishmen at all events, in the sixty-seven volumes of the _Dictionary of National Biography_, where are recorded the services rendered to religion, philosophy, poetry, justice, and the empire by the \"whelps\" of many a country vicar. Parsons' wives may sometimes be trying and hard to explain, but an England without the sons of her clergy would be shorn of half her glory.  Marvell's boyhood seems to have been surrounded with the things that most make for a child's happiness. A sensible, affectionate, humorous, religious father, occupying a position of authority, and greatly respected, a mother and three elder sisters to make much of his bright wit and early adventures, a comfortable yet simple home, and an atmosphere of piety, learning, and good fellowship. What more is wanted, or can be desired? The \"Boatswains\" and \"Cabin-boys\" of Bishop Parker's fancy were in the neighbourhood, no doubt, and as stray companions for a half-holiday must have had their attractions; but it is unnecessary to attribute Andrew Marvell's style in controversy to his early acquaintance with a sea-faring population, for he is far more likely to have picked it up from his great friend and colleague, the author of _Paradise Lost_.  Marvell's school education over, he went up to Cambridge, not to his father's old college, but to the more splendid foundation of Trinity. About the date of his matriculation there is a doubt. In Wood's _Athenæ Oxonienses_ there is a note to the effect that Marvell was admitted \"in matriculam Acad. Cant. Coll. Trin.\" on the 14th of December 1633, when the boy was but twelve years old. Dr. Lort, a famous master of Trinity in his day, writing in November 1765 to Captain Edward Thompson, of whom more later on, told the captain that until 1635 there was no register of admissions of ordinary students, or pensioners, as they are called, but only a register of Fellows and Foundation Scholars, and in this last-named register Marvell's name appears as a Scholar sworn and admitted on the 13th of April 1638. As, however, Marvell took his B.A. degree in 1639, he must have been in residence long before April 1638. Probably Marvell went to Trinity about 1635, just before the register of pensioners was begun, as a pensioner, becoming a Scholar in 1638, and taking his degree in 1639.  Cambridge undergraduates do not usually keep diaries, nor after they have become Masters of Art are they much in the habit of giving details as to their academic career. Marvell is no exception to this provoking rule. He nowhere tells us what his University taught him or how. The logic of the schools he had no choice but to learn. Molineus, Peter Ramus, Seton, Keckerman were text-books of reputation, from one or another of which every Cambridge"]]]
