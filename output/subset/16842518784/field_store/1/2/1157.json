Some of the young German school found inspiration in Berlioz. The dramatic symphony that he created flourished in its German form under Liszt; the most eminent German composer of to-day, Richard Strauss, came under his influence; and Felix Weingartner, who with Charles Malherbe edited Berlioz's complete works, was bold enough to write, \"In spite of Wagner and Liszt, we should not be where we are if Berlioz had not lived.\" This unexpected support, coming from a country of traditions, has thrown the partisans of Classic tradition into confusion, and rallied Berlioz's friends.  [Footnote 2: _Mémoires_, II, 149.]  But here is a new danger. Though it is natural that Germany, more musical than France, should recognise the grandeur and originality of Berlioz's music before France, it is doubtful whether the German nature could ever fully understand a soul so French in its essence. It is, perhaps, what is exterior in Berlioz, his positive originality, that the Germans appreciate. They prefer the _Requiem_ to _Roméo_. A Richard Strauss would be attracted by an almost insignificant work like the _Ouverture du roi Lear_; a Weingartner would single out for notice works like the _Symphonic fantastique_ and _Harold_, and exaggerate their importance. But they do not feel what is intimate in him. Wagner said over the tomb of Weber, \"England does you justice, France admires you, but only Germany loves you; you are of her own being, a glorious day of her life, a warm drop of her blood, a part of her heart....\" One might adapt his words to Berlioz; it is as difficult for a German really to love Berlioz as it is for a Frenchman to love Wagner or Weber. One must, therefore, be careful about accepting unreservedly the judgment of Germany on Berlioz; for in that would lie the danger of a new misunderstanding. You see how both the followers and opponents of Berlioz hinder us from getting at the truth. Let us dismiss them.  Have we now come to the end of our difficulties? Not yet; for Berlioz is the most illusive of men, and no one has helped more than he to mislead people in their estimate of him. We know how much he has written about music and about his own life, and what wit and understanding he shows in his shrewd criticisms and charming _Mémoires_.[3]  [Footnote 3: The literary work of Berlioz is rather uneven. Beside passages of exquisite beauty we find others that are ridiculous in their exaggerated sentiment, and there are some that even lack good taste. But he had a natural gift of style, and his writing is vigorous, and full of feeling, especially towards the latter half of his life. The _Procession des Rogations_ is often quoted from the _Mémoires_; and some of his poetical text, particularly that in _L'Enfance du Christ_ and in _Les Troyens_, is written in beautiful language and with a fine sense of rhythm. His _Mémoires_ as a whole is one of the most delightful books ever written by an artist. Wagner was a greater poet, but as a prose writer Berlioz is infinitely superior. See Paul Morillot's essay on _Berlioz écrivain_, 1903, Grenoble.] One would think that such an imaginative and skilful writer, accustomed in his profession of critic to express every shade of feeling, would be able to tell us more exactly his ideas of art than a Beethoven or a Mozart. But it is not so. As too much light may blind the vision, so too much intellect may hinder the understanding. Berlioz's mind spent itself in details; it reflected light from too many facets, and did not focus itself in one strong beam which would have made known his power. He did not know how to dominate either his life or his work; he did not even try to dominate them. He was the incarnation of romantic genius, an unrestrained force, unconscious of the road he trod. I would not go so far as to say that he did not understand himself, but there are certainly times when he is past understanding himself. He allows himself to drift where chance will take him,[4] like an old Scandinavian pirate laid at the bottom of his boat, staring up at the sky; and he dreams and groans and laughs and gives himself up to his feverish delusions. He lived with his emotions as uncertainly as he lived with his art. In his music, as in his criticisms of music, he often contradicts himself, hesitates, and turns back; he is not sure either of his feelings or his thoughts. He has poetry in his soul, and strives to write operas; but his admiration wavers between Gluck and Meyerbeer. He has a popular genius, but despises the people. He is a daring musical revolutionary, but he allows the control of this musical movement to be taken from him by anyone who wishes to have it. Worse than that: he disowns the movement, turns his back upon the future, and throws himself again into the past. For what reason? Very often he does not know. Passion, bitterness, caprice, wounded pride--these have more influence with him than the serious things of life. He is a man at war with himself.  [Footnote 4: \"Chance, that unknown god, who plays such a great part in my life\" (_Mémoires_, II, 161).]  Then contrast Berlioz with Wagner. Wagner, too, was stirred by violent passions, but he was always master of himself, and his reason remained unshaken by the storms of his heart or those of the world, by the torments of love or the strife of political revolutions. He made his experiences and even his errors serve his art; he wrote about his theories before he put them into practice; and he only launched out when he was sure of himself, and when the way lay clear before him. And think how much Wagner owes to this written expression of his aims and the magnetic attraction of his arguments. It was his prose works that fascinated the King of Bavaria before he had heard his music; and for many others also they have been the key to that music. I remember being impressed by Wagner's ideas when I only half understood his art; and when one of his compositions puzzled me, my confidence was not shaken, for I was sure that the genius who was so convincing in his reasoning would not blunder; and that if his music baffled me, it was I who was at fault. Wagner was really his own best friend, his own most trusty champion; and his was the guiding hand that led one through the thick forest and over the rugged crags of his work.  Not only do you get no help from Berlioz in this way, but he is the first to lead you astray and wander with you in the paths of error. To understand his genius you must seize hold of it unaided. His genius was really great, but, as I shall try to show you, it lay at the mercy of a weak character.         *       *       *       *       *  Everything about Berlioz was misleading, even his appearance. In legendary portraits he appears as a dark southerner with black hair and sparkling eyes. But he was really very fair and had blue eyes,[5] and Joseph d'Ortigue tells us they were deep-set and piercing, though sometimes clouded by melancholy or languor.[6] He had a broad forehead furrowed with wrinkles by the time he was thirty, and a thick mane of hair, or, as E. Legouvé puts it, \"a large umbrella of hair, projecting like a movable awning over the beak of a bird of prey.\"[7]   [Footnote 5: \"I was fair,\" wrote Berlioz to Bülow (unpublished letters, 1858). \"A shock of reddish hair,\" he wrote in his _Mémoires_, I, 165. \"Sandy-coloured hair,\" said Reyer. For the colour of Berlioz's hair I rely upon the evidence of Mme. Chapót, his niece.]  [Footnote 6: Joseph d'Ortigue, _Le Balcon de l'Opéra_, 1833.]  [Footnote 7: E. Legouvé, _Soixante ans de souvenirs_. Legouvé describes Berlioz here as he saw him for the first time.]  His mouth was well cut, with lips compressed and puckered at the corners in a severe fold, and his chin was prominent. He had a deep voice,[8] but his speech was halting and often tremulous with emotion; he would speak passionately of what interested him, and at times be effusive in manner, but more often he was ungracious and reserved. He was of medium height, rather thin and angular in figure, and when seated he seemed much taller than he really was.[9] He was very restless, and inherited from his native land, Dauphiné, the mountaineer's passion for walking and climbing, and the love of a vagabond life, which remained with him nearly to his death.[10] He had an iron constitution, but he wrecked it by privation and excess, by his walks in the rain, and by sleeping out-of-doors in all weathers, even when there was snow on the ground.[11]  [Footnote 8: \"A passable baritone,\" says Berlioz _(Mémoires_, I, 58). In 1830, in the streets of Paris, he sang \"a bass part\" _(Mémoires_, I, 156). During his first visit to Germany the Prince of Hechingen made him sing \"the part of the violoncello\" in one of his compositions (_Mémoires_, II, 32).]  [Footnote 9: There are two good portraits of Berlioz. One is a photograph by Pierre Petit, taken in 1863, which he sent to Mme. Estelle Fornier. It shows him leaning on his elbow, with his head bent, and his eyes fixed on the ground as if he were tired. The other is the photograph which he had reproduced in the first edition of his _Mémoires_, and which shows him leaning back, his hands in his pockets, his head upright, with an expression of energy in his face, and a fixed and stern look in his eyes.]  [Footnote 10: He would go on foot from Naples to Rome in a straight line over the mountains, and would walk at one stretch from Subiaco to Tivoli.]  [Footnote 11: This brought on several attacks of bronchitis and frequent sore throats, as well as the internal affection from which he died.]  But in this strong and athletic frame lived a feverish and sickly soul that was dominated and tormented by a morbid craving for love and sympathy: \"that imperative need of love which is killing me....\"[12] To love, to be loved--he would give up all for that.  [Footnote 12: \"Music and love are the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16467"],["title","Musicians of To-Day (#2)"],["body","wings of the soul,\" he wrote in his _Mémoires_.]  But his love was that of a youth who lives in dreams; it was never the strong, clear-eyed passion of a man who has faced the realities of life, and who sees the defects as well as the charms of the woman he loves, Berlioz was in love with love, and lost himself among visions and sentimental shadows. To the end of his life he remained \"a poor little child worn out by a love that was beyond him.\"[13] But this man who lived so wild and adventurous a life expressed his passions with delicacy; and one finds an almost girlish purity in the immortal love passages of _Les Troyens_ or the \"_nuit sereine\"_ of _Roméo et Juliette_. And compare this Virgilian affection with Wagner's sensual raptures. Does it mean that Berlioz could not love as well as Wagner? We only know that Berlioz's life was made up of love and its torments. The theme of a touching passage in the Introduction of the _Symphonic fantastique_ has been recently identified by M. Julien Tiersot, in his interesting book,[14] with a romance composed by Berlioz at the age of twelve, when he loved a girl of eighteen \"with large eyes and pink shoes\"--Estelle, _Stella mentis, Stella matutina_. These words--perhaps the saddest he ever wrote--might serve as an emblem of his life, a life that was a prey to love and melancholy, doomed to wringing of the heart and awful loneliness; a life lived in a hollow world, among worries that chilled the blood; a life that was distasteful and had no solace to offer him in its end.[15] He has himself described this terrible \"_mal de l'isolement_,\" which pursued him all his life, vividly and minutely.[16] He was doomed to suffering, or, what was worse, to make others suffer.  [Footnote 13: _Mémoires_, I, 11.]  [Footnote 14: Julien Tiersot, _Hector Berlioz et la société de son temps_, 1903, Hachette.]  [Footnote 15: See the _Mémoires_, I, 139.]  [Footnote 16: \"I do not know how to describe this terrible sickness.... My throbbing breast seems to be sinking into space; and my heart, drawing in some irresistible force, feels as though it would expand until it evaporated and dissolved away. My skin becomes hot and tender, and flushes from head to foot. I want to cry out to my friends (even those I do not care for) to help and comfort me, to save me from destruction, and keep in the life that is ebbing from me. I have no sensation of impending death in these attacks, and suicide seems impossible; I do not want to die--far from it, I want very much to live, to intensify life a thousandfold. It is an excessive appetite for happiness, which becomes unbearable when it lacks food; and it is only satisfied by intense delights, which give this great overflow of feeling an outlet. It is not a state of spleen, though that may follow later ... spleen is rather the congealing of all these emotions--the block of ice. Even when I am calm I feel a little of this '_isolement_' on Sundays in summer, when our towns are lifeless, and everyone is in the country; for I know that people are enjoying themselves away from me, and I feel their absence. The _adagio_ of Beethoven's symphonies, certain scenes from Gluck's _Alceste_ and _Armide_, an air from his Italian opera _Telemacco_, the Elysian fields of his _Orfeo_, will bring on rather bad attacks of this suffering; but these masterpieces bring with them also an antidote--they make one's tears flow, and then the pain is eased. On the other hand, the _adagio_ of some of Beethoven's sonatas and Gluck's _Iphigénie en Tauride_ are full of melancholy, and therefore provoke spleen ... it is then cold within, the sky is grey and overcast with clouds, the north wind moans dully....\" _(Mémoires_, I, 246).]  Who does not know his passion for Henrietta Smithson? It was a sad story. He fell in love with an English actress who played Juliet (Was it she or Juliet whom he loved?). He caught but a glance of her, and it was all over with him. He cried out, \"Ah, I am lost!\" He desired her; she repulsed him. He lived in a delirium of suffering and passion; he wandered about for days and nights like a madman, up and down Paris and its neighbourhood, without purpose or rest or relief, until sleep overcame him wherever it found him--among the sheaves in a field near Villejuif, in a meadow near Sceaux, on the bank of the frozen Seine near Neuilly, in the snow, and once on a table in the Café Cardinal, where he slept for five hours, to the great alarm of the waiters, who thought he was dead.[17] Meanwhile, he was told slanderous gossip about Henrietta, which he readily believed. Then he despised her, and dishonoured her publicly in his _Symphonie fantastique_, paying homage in his bitter resentment to Camille Moke, a pianist, to whom he lost his heart without delay.  [Footnote 17: _Mémoires_, I, 98.]  After a time Henrietta reappeared. She had now lost her youth and her power; her beauty was waning, and she was in debt. Berlioz's passion was at once rekindled. This time Henrietta accepted his advances. He made alterations in his symphony, and offered it to her in homage of his love. He won her, and married her, with fourteen thousand francs debt. He had captured his dream--Juliet! Ophelia! What was she really? A charming Englishwoman, cold, loyal, and sober-minded, who understood nothing of his passion; and who, from the time she became his wife, loved him jealously and sincerely, and thought to confine him within the narrow world of domestic life. But his affections became restive, and he lost his heart to a Spanish actress (it was always an actress, a virtuoso, or a part) and left poor Ophelia, and went off with Marie Recio, the Inès of _Favorite_, the page of _Comte Ory_--a practical, hardheaded woman, an indifferent singer with a mania for singing. The haughty Berlioz was forced to fawn upon the directors of the theatre in order to get her parts, to write flattering notices in praise of her talents, and even to let her make his own melodies discordant at the concerts he arranged.[18] It would all be dreadfully ridiculous if this weakness of character had not brought tragedy in its train.  So the one he really loved, and who always loved him, remained alone, without friends, in Paris, where she was a stranger. She drooped in silence and pined slowly away, bedridden, paralysed, and unable to speak during eight years of suffering. Berlioz suffered too, for he loved her still and was torn with pity--\"pity, the most painful of all emotions.\"[19] But of what use was this pity? He left Henrietta to suffer alone and to die just the same. And, what was worse, as we learn from Legouvé, he let his mistress, the odious Recio, make a scene before poor Henrietta.[20] Recio told him of it and boasted about what she had done.  [Footnote 18: \"Isn't it really devilish,\" he said to Legouvé, \"tragic and silly at the same time? I should deserve to go to hell if I wasn't there already.\"]  [Footnote 19: _Mémoires_, II, 335. See the touching passages he wrote on Henrietta Smithson's death.]  [Footnote 20: \"One day, Henrietta, who was living alone at Montmartre, heard someone ring the bell, and went to open the door.  \"'Is Mme. Berlioz at home?'  \"'I am Mme. Berlioz.'  \"'You are mistaken; I asked for Mme. Berlioz.'  \"'And I tell you, I am Mme. Berlioz.'  \"'No, you are not. You are speaking of the old Mme. Berlioz, the one who was abandoned; I am speaking of the young and pretty and loved one. Well, that is myself!'  \"And Recio went out and banged the door after her.  \"Legouvé said to Berlioz, 'Who told you this abominable thing? I suppose she who did it; and then she boasted about it into the bargain. Why didn't you turn her out of the house?' 'How could I?' said Berlioz in broken tones, 'I love her'\" _(Soixante ans de souvenirs_).]  And Berlioz did nothing--\"How could I? I love her.\"  One would be hard upon such a man if one was not disarmed by his own sufferings. But let us go on. I should have liked to pass over these traits, but I have no right to; I must show you the extraordinary feebleness of the man's character. \"Man's character,\" did I say? No, it was the character of a woman without a will, the victim of her nerves.[21]  [Footnote 21: From this woman's nature came his love of revenge, \"a thing needless, and yet necessary,\" he said to his friend Hiller, who, after having made him write the _Symphonie fantastique_ to spite Henrietta Smithson, next made him write the wretched fantasia _Euphonia_ to spite Camille Moke, now Mme. Pleyel. One would feel obliged to draw more attention to the way he often adorned or perverted the truth if one did not feel it arose from his irrepressible and glowing imagination far more than from any intention to mislead; for I believe his real nature to have been a-very straightforward one. I will quote the story of his friend Crispino, a young countryman from Tivoli, as a characteristic example. Berlioz says in his _Mémoires_ (I, 229): \"One day when Crispino was lacking in respect I made-him a present of two shirts, a pair of trousers, and three good kicks behind.\" In a note he added, \"This is a lie, and is the result of an artist's tendency to aim at effect. I never kicked Crispino.\" But Berlioz took care afterwards to omit this note. One attaches as little importance to his other small boasts as to this one. The errors in the _Mémoires_ have been greatly exaggerated; and besides, Berlioz is the first to warn his readers that he only wrote what pleased him, and in his preface says that he is not writing his Confessions. Can one blame him for that?]         *       *       *       *       *  Such people are destined to unhappiness; and if they make other people suffer, one may be sure that it is only half of what they suffer themselves. They have a peculiar gift for attracting and gathering up trouble; they savour sorrow like wine, and do not lose a drop of it. Life seemed desirous that Berlioz should be steeped in suffering; and his misfortunes were so real"]]]
