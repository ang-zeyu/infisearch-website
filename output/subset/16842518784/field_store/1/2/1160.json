(I do not altogether agree with Mr. Graham about hanging the caramel-maker, but I should heartily like to burn all his wares. Fancy a great mountain of caramels and chocolate-creams and marrons glac√©s piled up in Union Square, for example, and blazing away merrily,--that is, if the things would burn, which is more than doubtful. How the maidens would weep and wring their hands while the heartless parents chuckled and fed the flames with all the precious treasures of Maillard and Huyler! Ah! it is a pleasant thought, for I who write this am a heartless parent, do you see?)  As I said before, Hilda had no suspicion of the plot which her parents were concocting. She knew that her father was obliged to go to San Francisco, being called suddenly to administer the estate of a cousin who had recently died there, and that her mother and--as she supposed--herself were going with him to offer sympathy and help to the widow, an invalid with three little children. As to the idea of her being left behind; of her father's starting off on a long journey without his lieutenant-general; of her mother's parting from her only child, whom she had watched with tender care and anxiety since the day of her birth,--such a thought never came into Hilda's mind. Wherever her parents went she went, as a matter of course. So it had always been, and so without doubt it always would be. She did not care specially about going to California at this season of the year,--in fact she had told her bosom friend, Madge Everton, only the day before, that it was \"rather a bore,\" and that she should have preferred to go to Newport. \"But what would you?\" she added, with the slightest shrug of her pretty shoulders. \"Papa and mamma really must go, it appears; so of course I must go too.\"  \"A bore!\" repeated Madge energetically, replying to the first part of her friend's remarks. \"Hilda, what a _very_ singular girl you are! Here I, or Nelly, or _any_ of the other girls would give both our ears, and our front teeth too, to make such a trip; and just because you _can_ go, you sit there and call it 'a bore!'\" And Madge shook her black curls, and opened wide eyes of indignation and wonder at our ungrateful heroine. \"I only wish,\" she added, \"that you and I could be changed into each other, just for this summer.\"  \"I wish--\" began Hilda; but she checked herself in her response to the wish, as the thought of Madge's five brothers rose in her mind (Hilda could not endure boys!), looked attentively at the toe of her little bronze slipper for a few moments, and then changed the subject by proposing a walk. \"Console yourself with the caramels, my fiery Madge,\" she said, pushing the box across the table, \"while I put on my boots. We will go to Maillard's and get some more while we are out. His caramels are decidedly better than Huyler's; don't you think so!\"  A very busy woman was pretty Mrs. Graham during the next two weeks. First she made an expedition into the country \"to see an old friend,\" she said, and was gone two whole days. And after that she was out every morning, driving hither and thither, from shop to dressmaker, from dressmaker to milliner, from milliner to shoemaker.  \"It is a sad thing,\" Mr. Graham would say, when his wife fluttered in to lunch, breathless and exhausted and half an hour late (she, the most punctual of women!),--\"it is a sad thing to have married a comet by mistake, thinking it was a woman. How did you find the other planets this morning, my dear? Is it true that Saturn has lost one of his rings? and has the Sun recovered from his last attack of spots? I really fear,\" he would add, turning to Hilda, \"that this preternatural activity in your comet-parent portends some alarming change in the--a--atmospheric phenomena, my child. I would have you on your guard!\" and then he would look at her and sigh, shake his head, and apply himself to the cold chicken with melancholy vigor.  Hilda thought nothing of her father's remarks,--papa was always talking nonsense, and she thought she always understood him perfectly. It did occur to her, however, to wonder at her mother's leaving her out on all her shopping expeditions. Hilda rather prided herself on her skill in matching shades and selecting fabrics, and mamma was generally glad of her assistance in all such matters. However, perhaps it was only under-clothing and house-linen, and such things that she was buying. All that was the prosy part of shopping. It was the poetry of it that Hilda loved,--the shimmer of silk and satin, the rich shadows in velvet, the cool, airy fluttering of lawn and muslin and lace. So the girl went on her usual way, finding life a little dull, a little tiresome, and most people rather stupid, but everything on the whole much as usual, if her head only would not ache so; and it was without a shadow of suspicion that she obeyed one morning her mother's summons to come and see her in her dressing-room.  Mr. Graham always spoke of his wife's dressing-room as \"the citadel.\" It was absolutely impregnable, he said. In the open field of the drawing-room or the broken country of the dining-room it might be possible--he had never known such a thing to occur, but still it _might_ be possible--for the commander-in-chief to sustain a defeat; but once intrenched behind the walls of the citadel, horse, foot, and dragoons might storm and charge upon her, but they could not gain an inch. Not an inch, sir! True it was that Mrs. Graham always felt strongest in this particular room. She laughed about it, but acknowledged the fact. Here, on the wall, hung a certain picture which was always an inspiration to her. Here, on the shelf above her desk, were the books of her heart, the few tried friends to whom she turned for help and counsel when things puzzled her. (Mrs. Graham was never disheartened. She didn't believe there was such a word. She was only \"puzzled\" sometimes, until she saw her way and her duty clear before her, and then she went straight forward, over a mountain or through a stone wall, as the case might be.) Here, in the drawer of her little work-table, were some relics,--a tiny, half-worn shoe, a little doll, a sweet baby face laughing from an ivory frame: the insignia of her rank in the great order of sorrowing mothers; and these, perhaps, gave her that great sympathy and tenderness for all who were in trouble which drew all sad hearts towards her.  And so, on this occasion, the little woman had sat for a few moments looking at the pictured face on the wall, with its mingled majesty and sweetness; had peeped into the best-beloved of all books, and said a little prayer, as was her wont when \"puzzled,\" before she sent the message to Hilda,--for she knew that she must sorely hurt and grieve the child who was half the world to her; and though she did not flinch from the task, she longed for strength and wisdom to do it in the kindest and wisest way.  \"Hilda, dear,\" she said gently, when they were seated together on the sofa, hand in hand, with each an arm round the other's waist, as they loved best to sit,--\"Hilda, dear, I have something to say that will not please you; something that may even grieve you very much at first.\" She paused, and Hilda rapidly reviewed in her mind all the possibilities that she could think of. Had anything happened to the box of French dresses which was on its way from Paris? Had a careless servant broken the glass of her fernery again? Had Aunt Emily been saying disagreeable things about her, as she was apt to do? She was about to speak, but at that moment, like a thunderbolt, the next words struck her ear: \"We have decided not to take you with us to California.\" Amazed, wounded, indignant, Hilda could only lift her great gray eyes to meet the soft violet ones which, full of unshed tears, were fixed tenderly upon her. Mrs. Graham continued: \"Your father and I both feel, my darling, that this long, fatiguing journey, in the full heat of summer, would be the worst possible thing for you. You have not been very well lately, and it is most important that you should lead a quiet, regular, healthy life for the next few months. We have therefore made arrangements to leave you--\"  But here Hilda could control herself no longer. \"Mamma! mamma!\" she cried. \"How can you be so unkind, so cruel? Leave me--you and papa both? Why, I shall die! Of course I shall die, all alone in this great house. I thought you loved me!\" and she burst into tears, half of anger, half of grief, and sobbed bitterly.  \"Dear child!\" said Mrs. Graham, smoothing the fair hair lovingly, \"if you had heard me out, you would have seen that we had no idea of leaving you alone, or of leaving you in this house either. You are to stay with--\"  \"Not with Aunt Emily!\" cried the girl, springing to her feet with flashing eyes. \"Mamma, I would rather beg in the streets than stay with Aunt Emily. She is a detestable, ill-natured, selfish woman.\"  \"Hildegarde,\" said Mrs. Graham gravely, \"be silent!\" There was a moment of absolute stillness, broken only by the ticking of the little crystal clock on the mantelpiece, and then Mrs. Graham continued: \"I must ask you not to speak again, my daughter, until I have finished what I have to say; and even then, I trust you will keep silence until you are able to command yourself. You are to stay with my old nurse, Mrs. Hartley, at her farm near Glenfield. She is a very kind, good woman, and will take the best possible care of you. I went to the farm myself last week, and found it a lovely place, with every comfort, though no luxuries, save the great one of a free, healthy, natural life. There, my Hilda, we shall leave you, sadly indeed, and yet feeling that you are in good and loving hands. And I feel very sure,\" she added in a lighter tone, \"that"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16473"],["title","Queen Hildegarde (#2)"],["body"," the time we return, you will be a rosy-cheeked country lass, strong and hearty, with no more thought of headaches, and no wrinkle in your forehead.\" As she ceased speaking, Mrs. Graham drew the girl close to her, and kissed the white brow tenderly, murmuring: \"God bless my darling daughter! If she knew how her mother's heart aches at parting with her!\" But Hilda did not know. She was too angry, too bewildered, too deeply hurt, to think of any one except herself. She felt that she could not trust herself to speak, and it was in silence, and without returning her mother's caress, that she rose and sought her own room.  Mrs. Graham looked after her wistfully, tenderly, but made no effort to call her back. The tears trembled in her soft blue eyes, and her lip quivered as she turned to her work-table; but she said quietly to herself: \"Solitude is a good medicine. The child will do well, and I know that I have chosen wisely for her.\"  Bitter tears did Hildegarde shed as she flung herself face downward on her own blue sofa. Angry thoughts surged through her brain. Now she burned with resentment at the parents who could desert her,--their only child; now she melted into pity for herself, and wept more and more as she pictured the misery that lay before her. To be left alone--_alone!_--on a squalid, wretched farm, with a dirty old woman, a woman who had been a servant,--she, Hildegardis Graham, the idol of her parents, the queen of her \"set\" among the young people, the proudest and most exclusive girl in New York, as she had once (and not with displeasure) heard herself called!  What would Madge Everton, what would all the girls say! How they would laugh, to hear of Hilda Graham living on a farm among pigs and hens and dirty people! Oh! it was intolerable; and she sprang up and paced the floor, with burning cheeks and flashing eyes.  The thought of opposing the plan did not occur to her. Mrs. Graham's rule, gentle though it was, was not of the flabby, nor yet of the elastic sort. Her decisions were not hastily arrived at; but once made, they were final and abiding. \"You might just as well try to oppose the Gulf Stream!\" Mr. Graham would say. \"They do it sometimes with icebergs, and what is the result? In a few days the great clumsy things are bowing and scraping and turning somersaults, and fairly jostling each other in their eagerness to obey the guidance of the insidious current. Insidious Current, will you allow a cup of coffee to drift in my direction? I shall be only too happy to turn a somersault if it will afford you--thanks!--the smallest gratification.\"  So Hildegarde's first lessons had been in obedience and in truthfulness; and these were fairly well learned before she began her ABC. And so she knew now, that she might storm and weep as she would in her own room, but that the decree was fixed, and that unless the skies fell, her summer would be passed at Hartley's Glen.     CHAPTER II.  DAME AND FARMER.   When the first shock was over, Hilda was rather glad than otherwise to learn that there was to be no delay in carrying out the odious plan. \"The sooner the better,\" she said to herself. \"I certainly don't want to see any of the girls again, and the first plunge will be the worst of it.\"  \"What clothes am I to take?\" she asked her mother, in a tone which she mentally denominated \"quiet and cold,\" though possibly some people might have called it \"sullen.\"  \"Your clothes are already packed, dear,\" replied Mrs. Graham; \"you have only to pack your dressing-bag, to be all ready for the start to-morrow. See, here is your trunk, locked and strapped, and waiting for the porter's shoulder;\" and she showed Hilda a stout, substantial-looking trunk, bearing the initials H.G.  \"But, mamma,\" Hilda began, wondering greatly, \"my dresses are all hanging in my wardrobe.\"  \"Not all of them, dear!\" said her mother, smiling. \"Hark! papa is calling you. Make haste and go down, for dinner is ready.\"  Wondering more and more, Hildegarde made a hasty toilet, putting on the pretty pale blue cashmere dress which her father specially liked, with silk stockings to match, and dainty slippers of bronze kid. As she clasped the necklace of delicate blue and silver Venetian beads which completed the costume, she glanced into the long cheval-glass which stood between the windows, and could not help giving a little approving nod to her reflection. Though not a great beauty, Hildegarde was certainly a remarkably pretty and even distinguished-looking girl; and \"being neither blind nor a fool,\" she soliloquized, \"where is the harm in acknowledging it?\" But the next moment the thought came: \"What difference will it make, in a stupid farm-house, whether I am pretty or not? I might as well be a Hottentot!\" and with the \"quiet and cold\" look darkening over her face, she went slowly down stairs.  Her father met her with a kiss and clasp of the hand even warmer than usual.  \"Well, General!\" he said, in a voice which insisted upon being cheery, \"marching orders, eh? Marching orders! Break up camp! boot, saddle, to horse and away! Forces to march in different directions, by order of the commander-in-chief.\" But the next moment he added, in an altered tone: \"My girl, mamma knows best; remember that! She is right in this move, as she generally is. Cheer up, darling, and let us make the last evening a happy one!\"  Hilda tried to smile, for who _could_ be angry with papa? She made a little effort, and the father and mother made a great one,--_how_ great she could not know; and so the evening passed, better than might have been expected.  The evening passed, and the night, and the next day came; and it was like waking from a strange dream when Hilda found herself in a railway train, with her father sitting beside her, and her mother's farewell kiss yet warm on her cheek, speeding over the open country, away from home and all that she held most dear. Her dressing-bag, with her umbrella neatly strapped to it, was in the rack overhead, the check for her trunk in her pocket. Could it all be true? She tried to listen while her father told her of the happy days he had spent on his grandfather's farm when he was a boy; but the interest was not real, and she found it hard to fix her mind on what he was saying. What did she care about swinging on gates, or climbing apple-trees, or riding unruly colts! She was not a boy, nor even a tomboy. When he spoke of the delights of walking in the country through woodland and meadow, her thoughts strayed to Fifth Avenue, with its throng of well-dressed people, the glittering equipages rolling by, the stately houses on either side, through whose shining windows one caught glimpses of the splendors within; and to the Park, with its shady alleys and well-kept lawns. Could there be any walking so delightful as that which these afforded? Surely not! Ah! Madge and Helen were probably just starting for their walk now. Did they know of her banishment? would they laugh at the thought of Queen Hildegardis vegetating for three months at a wretched--  \"Glenfield!\" The brakeman's voice rang clear and sharp through the car. Hilda started, and seized her father's hand convulsively.  \"Papa!\" she whispered, \"O papa! don't leave me here; take me home! I cannot bear it!\"  \"Come, my child!\" said Mr. Graham, speaking low, and with an odd catch in his voice; \"that is not the way to go into action. Remember, this is your first battle. So, eyes front! charge bayonets! quick step! forward, _march_!\"  The train had stopped. They were on the platform. Mr. Graham led Hilda up to a stout, motherly-looking woman, who held out her hand with a beaming smile.  \"Here is my daughter, Mrs. Hartley!\" he said, hastily. \"You will take good care of her, I know. My darling, good-by! I go on to Dashford, and home by return train in an hour. God bless you, my Hilda! Courage! Up, Guards, and at them! Remember Waterloo!\" and he was gone. The engine shrieked an unearthly \"Good-by!\" and the train rumbled away, leaving Hilda gazing after it through a mist which only her strong will prevented from dissolving in tears.  \"Well, my dear,\" said Dame Hartley's cheery voice, \"your papa's gone, and you must not stand here and fret after him. Here is old Nancy shaking her head, and wondering why she does not get home to her dinner. Do you get into the cart, and I will get the station-master to put your trunk in for us.\"  Hilda obeyed in silence; and climbing into the neat wagon, took her seat and looked about her while Dame Hartley bustled off in search of the station-master. There was not very much to look at at Glenfield station. The low wooden building with its long platform stood on a bare spot of ground, from which the trees all stood back, as if to mark their disapproval of the railway and all that belonged to it. The sandy soil made little attempt to produce vegetation, but put out little humps of rock occasionally, to show what it could do. Behind, a road led off into the woods, hiding itself behind the low-hanging branches of chestnut and maple, ash and linden trees. That was all. Now that the train was gone, the silence was unbroken save by the impatient movements of the old white mare as she shook the flies off and rattled the jingling harness.  Hilda was too weary to think. She had slept little the night before, and the suddenness of the recent changes confused her mind and made her feel as if she were some one else, and not herself at all. She sat patiently, counting half-unconsciously each quiver of Nancy's ears. But now Dame Hartley came bustling back with the station-master, and between the two, Hilda's trunk was hoisted into the cart. Then the good woman climbed in over the wheel, settled her ample person on the seat and gathered up the reins, while the station-master stood smoothing the mare's mane, ready for a parting word of friendly gossip.  \"Jacob pooty smart!\" he asked, brushing a fly from Nancy's shoulder.  \"Only middling,\" was the reply. \"He had a touch o'"]]]
