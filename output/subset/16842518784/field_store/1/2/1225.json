This book is the leaven fermenting religion; it is palpably working in the sermons, Sunday Schools, and literature of our and other lands. This spiritual chemicalization is the upheaval produced when Truth is neutralizing error and impurities are passing off. And it will continue till the antithesis of Christianity, engendering the limited forms of a national or tyrannical religion, yields to the church established by the Nazarene Prophet and maintained on the spiritual foundation of Christ's healing.  Good, the Anglo-Saxon term for God, unites Science to Christianity. It presents to the understanding, not matter, but Mind; not the deified drug, but the goodness of God--healing and saving mankind.  The author of \"Marriage of the Lamb,\" who made the mistake of thinking she caught her notions from my book, wrote to me in 1894, \"Six months ago your book, Science and Health, was put into my hands. I had not read three pages before I realized I had found that for which I had hungered since girlhood, and was healed instantaneously of an ailment of seven years' standing. I cast from me the false remedy I had vainly used, and turned to the 'great Physician.' I went with my husband, a missionary to China, in 1884. He went out under the auspices of the Methodist Episcopal Church. I feel the truth is leading us to return to Japan.\"  Another brilliant enunciator, seeker, and servant of Truth, the Rev. William R. Alger of Boston, signalled me kindly as my lone bark rose and fell and rode the rough sea. At a _conversazione_ in Boston, he said, \"You may find in Mrs. Eddy's metaphysical teachings more than is dreamt of in your philosophy.\"  Also that renowned apostle of anti-slavery, Wendell Phillips, the native course of whose mind never swerved from the chariot-paths of justice, speaking of my work, said: \"Had I young blood in my veins, I would help that woman.\"  I love Boston, and especially the laws of the State whereof this city is the capital. To-day, as of yore, her laws have befriended progress.  Yet when I recall the past,--how the gospel of healing was simultaneously praised and persecuted in Boston,--and remember also that God is just, I wonder whether, were our dear Master in our New England metropolis at this hour, he would not weep over it, as he wept over Jerusalem! O ye tears! Not in vain did ye flow. Those sacred drops were but enshrined for future use, and God has now unsealed their receptacle with His outstretched arm. Those crystal globes made morals for mankind. They will rise with joy, and with power to wash away, in floods of forgiveness, every crime, even when mistakenly committed in the name of religion.  An unjust, unmerciful, and oppressive priesthood must perish, for false prophets in the present as in the past stumble onward to their doom; while their tabernacles crumble with dry rot. \"God is not mocked,\" and \"the word of the Lord endureth forever.\"  I have ordained the Bible and the Christian Science textbook, \"Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures,\" as pastor of The First Church of Christ, Scientist, in Boston,--so long as this church is satisfied with this pastor. This is my first ordination. \"They shall be abundantly satisfied with the fatness of Thy house; and Thou shalt make them drink of the river of Thy pleasures.\"  All praise to the press of America's Athens,--and throughout our land the press has spoken out historically, impartially. Like the winds telling tales through the leaves of an ancient oak, unfallen, may our church chimes repeat my thanks to the press.  Notwithstanding the perplexed condition of our nation's finances, the want and woe with millions of dollars unemployed in our money centres, the Christian Scientists, within fourteen months, responded to the call for this church with $191,012. Not a mortgage was given nor a loan solicited, and the donors all touchingly told their privileged joy at helping to build The Mother Church. There was no urging, begging, or borrowing; only the need made known, and forth came the money, or diamonds, which served to erect this \"miracle in stone.\"  Even the children vied with their parents to meet the demand. Little hands, never before devoted to menial services, shoveled snow, and babes gave kisses to earn a few pence toward this consummation. Some of these lambs my prayers had christened, but Christ will rechristen them with his own new name. \"Out of the mouths of babes and sucklings Thou hast perfected praise.\" The resident youthful workers were called \"Busy Bees.\"  Sweet society, precious children, your loving hearts and deft fingers distilled the nectar and painted the finest flowers in the fabric of this history,--even its centre-piece,--Mother's Room in The First Church of Christ, Scientist, in Boston. The children are destined to witness results which will eclipse Oriental dreams. They belong to the twentieth century. By juvenile aid, into the building fund have come $4,460.[B] Ah, children, you are the bulwarks of freedom, the cement of society, the hope of our race!  Brothers of the Christian Science Board of Directors, when your tireless tasks are done--well done--no Delphian lyre could break the full chords of such a rest. May the altar you have built never be shattered in our hearts, but justice, mercy, and love kindle perpetually its fires.  It was well that the brother whose appliances warm this house, warmed also our perishless hope, and nerved its grand fulfilment. Woman, true to her instinct, came to the rescue as sunshine from the clouds; so, when man quibbled over an architectural exigency, a woman climbed with feet and hands to the top of the tower, and helped settle the subject.  After the loss of our late lamented pastor, Rev. D.A. Easton, the church services were maintained by excellent sermons from the editor of _The Christian Science Journal_ (who, with his better half, is a very whole man), together with the Sunday School giving this flock \"drink from the river of His pleasures.\" O glorious hope and blessed assurance, \"it is your Father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom.\" Christians rejoice in secret, they have a bounty hidden from the world. Self-forgetfulness, purity, and love are treasures untold--constant prayers, prophecies, and anointings. Practice, not profession,--goodness, not doctrines,--spiritual understanding, not mere belief, gain the ear and right hand of omnipotence, and call down blessings infinite. \"Faith without works is dead.\" The foundation of enlightened faith is Christ's teachings and _practice_. It was our Master's self-immolation, his life-giving love, healing both mind and body, that raised the deadened conscience, paralyzed by inactive faith, to a quickened sense of mortal's necessities,--and God's power and purpose to supply them. It was, in the words of the Psalmist, He \"who forgiveth all thine iniquities; who healeth all thy diseases.\"  Rome's fallen fanes and silent Aventine is glory's tomb; her pomp and power lie low in dust. Our land, more favored, had its Pilgrim Fathers. On shores of solitude, at Plymouth Rock, they planted a nation's heart,--the rights of conscience, imperishable glory. No dream of avarice or ambition broke their exalted purpose, theirs was the wish to reign in hope's reality--the realm of Love.  Christian Scientists, you have planted your standard on the rock of Christ, the true, the spiritual idea,--the chief corner-stone in the house of our God. And our Master said: \"The stone which the builders rejected, the same is become the head of the corner.\" If you are less appreciated to-day than your forefathers, wait--for if you are as devout as they, and more scientific, as progress certainly demands, your plant is immortal. Let us rejoice that chill vicissitudes have not withheld the timely shelter of this house, which descended like day-spring from on high.  Divine presence, breathe Thou Thy blessing on every heart in this house. Speak out, O soul! This is the newborn of Spirit, this is His redeemed; this, His beloved. May the kingdom of God within you,--with you alway,--reascending, bear you outward, upward, heavenward. May the sweet song of silver-throated singers, making melody more real, and the organ's voice, as the sound of many waters, and the Word spoken in this sacred temple dedicated to the ever-present God--mingle with the joy of angels and rehearse your hearts' holy intents. May all whose means, energies, and prayers helped erect The Mother Church, find within it home, and _heaven_.     CHRISTIAN SCIENCE TEXTBOOK   The following selections from \"Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures,\" pages 568-571, were read from the platform. The impressive stillness of the audience indicated close attention.      _Revelation_ xii. 10-12. And I heard a loud voice saying in     heaven, Now is come salvation, and strength, and the kingdom of     our God, and the power of His Christ: for the accuser of our     brethren is cast down, which accused them before our God day and     night. And they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb, and by the     word of their testimony; and they loved not their lives unto the     death. Therefore rejoice, ye heavens, and ye that dwell in them.     Woe to the inhabiters of the earth and of the sea! for the devil     is come down unto you, having great wrath, because he knoweth that     he hath but a short time.  For victory over a single sin, we give thanks and magnify the Lord of Hosts. What shall we say of the mighty conquest over all sin? A louder song, sweeter than has ever before reached high heaven, now rises clearer and nearer to the great heart of Christ; for the accuser is not there, and Love sends forth her primal and everlasting strain. Self-abnegation, by which we lay down all for Truth, or Christ, in our warfare against error, is a rule in Christian Science. This rule clearly interprets God as divine Principle,--as Life, represented by the Father; as Truth, represented by the Son;"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16778"],["title","Pulpit and Press (#2)"],["body"," as Love, represented by the Mother. Every mortal at some period, here or hereafter, must grapple with and overcome the mortal belief in a power opposed to God.  The Scripture, \"Thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many,\" is literally fulfilled, when we are conscious of the supremacy of Truth, by which the nothingness of error is seen; and we know that the nothingness of error is in proportion to its wickedness. He that touches the hem of Christ's robe and masters his mortal beliefs, animality, and hate, rejoices in the proof of healing,--in a sweet and certain sense that God is Love. Alas for those who break faith with divine Science and fail to strangle the serpent of sin as well as of sickness! They are dwellers still in the deep darkness of belief. They are in the surging sea of error, not struggling to lift their heads above the drowning wave.  What must the end be? They must eventually expiate their sin through suffering. The sin, which one has made his bosom companion, comes back to him at last with accelerated force, for the devil knoweth his time is short. Here the Scriptures declare that evil is temporal, not eternal. The dragon is at last stung to death by his own malice; but how many periods of torture it may take to remove all sin, must depend upon sin's obduracy.      _Revelation_ xii. 13. And when the dragon saw that he was cast     unto the earth, he persecuted the woman which brought forth the     man child.  The march of mind and of honest investigation will bring the hour when the people will chain, with fetters of some sort, the growing occultism of this period. The present apathy as to the tendency of certain active yet unseen mental agencies will finally be shocked into another extreme mortal mood,--into human indignation; for one extreme follows another.      _Revelation_ xii. 15, 16. And the serpent cast out of his mouth     water as a flood, after the woman, that he might cause her to be     carried away of the flood. And the earth helped the woman, and the     earth opened her mouth, and swallowed up the flood which the     dragon cast out of his mouth.  Millions of unprejudiced minds--simple seekers for Truth, weary wanderers, athirst in the desert--are waiting and watching for rest and drink. Give them a cup of cold water in Christ's name, and never fear the consequences. What if the old dragon should send forth a new flood to drown the Christ-idea? He can neither drown your voice with its roar, nor again sink the world into the deep waters of chaos and old night. In this age the earth will help the woman; the spiritual idea will be understood. Those ready for the blessing you impart will give thanks. The waters will be pacified, and Christ will command the wave.  When God heals the sick or the sinning, they should know the great benefit which Mind has wrought. They should also know the great delusion of mortal mind, when it makes them sick or sinful. Many are willing to open the eyes of the people to the power of good resident in divine Mind, but they are not so willing to point out the evil in human thought, and expose evil's hidden mental ways of accomplishing iniquity.  Why this backwardness, since exposure is necessary to ensure the avoidance of the evil? Because people like you better when you tell them their virtues than when you tell them their vices. It requires the spirit of our blessed Master to tell a man his faults, and so risk human displeasure for the sake of doing right and benefiting our race. Who is telling mankind of the foe in ambush? Is the informer one who sees the foe? If so, listen and be wise. Escape from evil, and designate those as unfaithful stewards who have seen the danger and yet have given no warning.  At all times and under all circumstances, overcome evil with good. Know thyself, and God will supply the wisdom and the occasion for a victory over evil. Clad in the panoply of Love, human hatred cannot reach you. The cement of a higher humanity will unite all interests in the one divinity.     HYMNS  BY REV. MARY BAKER EDDY  [Set to the Church Chimes and Sung on This Occasion]   LAYING THE CORNER-STONE      _Laus Deo_, it is done!     Rolled away from loving heart       Is a stone.     Joyous, risen, we depart       Having one.      _Laus Deo_,--on this rock     (Heaven chiselled squarely good)       Stands His church,--     God is Love, and understood       By His flock.      _Laus Deo_, night starlit     Slumbers not in God's embrace;       Then, O man!     Like this stone, be in thy place;       Stand, not sit.      Cold, silent, stately stone,     Dirge and song and shoutings low,       In thy heart     Dwell serene,--and sorrow? No,       It has none,       _Laus Deo!_  \"FEED MY SHEEP\"      Shepherd, show me how to go       O'er the hillside steep,     How to gather, how to sow,--       How to feed Thy sheep;     I will listen for Thy voice,       Lest my footsteps stray;     I will follow and rejoice       All the rugged way.      Thou wilt bind the stubborn will,       Wound the callous breast,     Make self-righteousness be still,       Break earth's stupid rest.     Strangers on a barren shore,       Lab'ring long and lone--     We would enter by the door,       And Thou know'st Thine own.      So, when day grows dark and cold,       Tear or triumph harms,     Lead Thy lambkins to the fold,       Take them in Thine arms;     Feed the hungry, heal the heart,       Till the morning's beam;     White as wool, ere they depart--       Shepherd, wash them clean.  CHRIST MY REFUGE      O'er waiting harpstrings of the mind       There sweeps a strain,     Low, sad, and sweet, whose measures bind       The power of pain.      And wake a white-winged angel throng       Of thoughts, illumed     By faith, and breathed in raptured song,       With love perfumed.      Then his unveiled, sweet mercies show       Life's burdens light.     I kiss the cross, and wake to know       A world more bright.      And o'er earth's troubled, angry sea       I see Christ walk,     And come to me, and tenderly,       Divinely talk.      Thus Truth engrounds me on the rock,       Upon Life's shore;     'Gainst which the winds and waves can shock,       Oh, nevermore!      From tired joy and grief afar,       And nearer Thee,--     Father, where Thine own children are,       I love to be.      My prayer, some daily good to do       To Thine, for Thee;     An offering pure of Love, whereto       God leadeth me.     NOTE  BY REV. MARY BAKER EDDY   The land whereon stands The First Church of Christ, Scientist, in Boston, was first purchased by the church and society. Owing to a heavy loss, they were unable to pay the mortgage; therefore I paid it, and through trustees gave back the land to the church.  In 1892 I had to recover the land from the trustees, reorganize the church, and reobtain its charter--not, however, through the State Commissioner, who refused to grant it, but by means of a statute of the State, and through Directors regive the land to the church. In 1895 I reconstructed my original system of ministry and church government. Thus committed to the providence of God, the prosperity of this church is unsurpassed.  From first to last The Mother Church seemed type and shadow of the warfare between the flesh and Spirit, even that shadow whose substance is the divine Spirit, imperatively propelling the greatest moral, physical, civil, and religious reform ever known on earth. In the words of the prophet: \"The shadow of a great rock in a weary land.\"  This church was dedicated on January 6, anciently one of the many dates selected and observed in the East as the day of the birth and baptism of our master Metaphysician, Jesus of Nazareth.  Christian Scientists, their children and grandchildren to the latest generations, inevitably love one another with that love wherewith Christ loveth us; a love unselfish, unambitious, impartial, universal,--that loves only because it _is_ Love. Moreover, they love their enemies, even those that hate them. This we all must do to be Christian Scientists in spirit and in truth. I long, and live, to see this love demonstrated. I am seeking and praying for it to inhabit my own heart and to be made manifest in my life. Who will unite with me in this pure purpose, and faithfully struggle till it be accomplished? Let this be our Christian endeavor society, which Christ organizes and blesses.  While we entertain due respect and fellowship for what is good and doing good in all denominations of religion, and shun whatever would isolate us from a true sense of goodness in others, we cannot serve mammon.  Christian Scientists are really united to only that which is Christlike, but they are not indifferent to the welfare of any one. To perpetuate a cold distance between our denomination and other sects, and close the door on church or individuals--however much this is done to us--is not Christian Science. Go not into the way of the unchristly, but wheresoever you recognize a clear expression of God's likeness, there abide in confidence and hope.  Our unity with churches of other denominations must rest on the spirit of Christ calling us together. It cannot come from any other source. Popularity, self-aggrandizement, aught that can darken in any degree our spirituality, must be set aside. Only what feeds and fills the sentiment with unworldliness, can give peace and good will towards men.  All Christian churches have one bond of unity, one nucleus or point of convergence, one prayer,--the Lord's Prayer. It is matter for rejoicing that we unite in love, and in this sacred petition with every praying assembly on earth,--\"Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven.\"  If the lives of Christian Scientists attest their fidelity to Truth, I predict that in the twentieth century every Christian church in our land, and a few in far-off lands, will approximate the understanding of Christian Science"]]]
