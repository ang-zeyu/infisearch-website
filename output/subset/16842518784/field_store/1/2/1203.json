But Solomon Owl interrupted him.  “There!” cried Solomon. “You can speak, after all. I supposed you’d swallowed your tongue. And I was just waiting to see what you’d do next. I thought maybe you would swallow your _head_.”  Mr. Frog managed to laugh at the joke, though, to tell the truth, he felt more nervous than ever. He saw what was in Solomon Owl’s mind, for Solomon was thinking of swallowing Mr. Frog’s head himself.  “No doubt—” Mr. Frog resumed—“no doubt you’ve come to ask me to make you a new suit of clothes.”  Now, Solomon Owl had had no such idea at all. But when it was mentioned to him, he rather liked it.  “Will you?” he inquired, with a highly interested air.  “Why, certainly!” the tailor replied. And for the first time since he had turned his backward somersault into the bulrushes, he smiled widely. “I’ll tell you what I’ll do!” he said. “First, I’ll make you a coat free. And second, if you like it I will then make you a waistcoat and trousers, at double rates.”  Solomon Owl liked the thought of getting a coat for nothing. But for all that, he looked at the tailor somewhat doubtfully.  “Will it take you long?” he asked.  “No, indeed!” Mr. Frog told him. “I’ll make your coat while you wait.”  “Oh, I wasn’t going away,” Solomon assured him with an odd look which made Mr. Frog shiver again. “Be quick, please! Because I have some important business to attend to.”  Mr. Frog couldn’t help wondering if it wasn’t he himself that Solomon Owl was going to attend to. In spite of his fears, to work to cut up some cloth that hung just outside his door.  “Stop!” Solomon Owl cried in a voice that seemed to shake the very ground. “You haven’t measured me yet!”  “It’s not necessary,” Mr. Frog explained glibly. “I’ve become so skilful that one look at an elegant figure like yours is all that I need.”  Naturally, Mr. Frog’s remark pleased Solomon Owl. And he uttered ten rapid hoots, which served to make Mr. Frog’s fingers fly all the faster. Soon he was sewing Solomon’s coat with long stitches; and though his needle slipped now and then, he did not pause to take out a single stitch. For some reason, Mr. Frog was in a great hurry.  Solomon Owl did not appear to notice that the tailor was not taking much pains with his sewing. Perhaps Mr. Frog worked so fast that Solomon could not see what he was doing.  Anyhow, he was delighted when Mr. Frog suddenly cried:  “It’s finished!” And then he tossed the coat to Solomon. “Try it on!” he said. “I want to see how well it fits you.”  Solomon Owl held up the garment and looked at it very carefully. And as he examined it a puzzled look came over his great pale face.  There was something about his new coat that he did not understand.     V The Cold Weather Coat   Yes! As he held up his new coat and looked at it, Solomon Owl was puzzled. He turned his head toward Mr. Frog and stared at him for a moment. And then he turned his head away from the tailor and gazed upon the coat again.  Mr. Frog was most uncomfortable—especially when Solomon looked at _him_.  “Everything’s all right, isn’t it?” he inquired.  Solomon Owl slowly shook his head.  “This is a queer coat!” he said. “What’s this bag at the top of it?”  “Oh!” exclaimed Mr. Frog. “That’s the hood! Knowing that you spend your winters here in Pleasant Valley, I made a hood to go over your head.... You’ll find it very comfortable in cold weather—and it’s the latest style, too. All the winter coats this year will have hoods, with holes to see through, you know.”  Solomon Owl looked relieved at Mr. Frog’s explanation. But there was still something more that appeared to trouble him.  “How shall I get into the coat?” he inquired. “It doesn’t open in front, as it should.”  “Another cold-weather style!” Mr. Frog assured him. “It’s wind-proof! And instead of buttoning the coat, you pull it on over your head.”  Solomon Owl said he didn’t like that style very well.  “Then I can easily change it,” the tailor told him. “But just try it on!” he urged. “It may please you, after all.”  So Solomon Owl pulled the coat over his head. And it fell down about him, almost reaching his feet. But the coat did not seem to suit him at all, for he began to splutter and choke.  “What’s the matter now?” Mr. Frog asked him.  “I can’t see—that’s what’s the matter!” Solomon Owl cried in a voice that sounded hollower than ever, because it was muffled by the hood, which covered his head.  “I declare—I haven’t cut the holes for your eyes!” the tailor exclaimed. “Just wait a moment and I’ll make everything satisfactory.” He clinked his shears together sharply as he spoke.  But Solomon Owl told him that he wouldn’t _think_ of letting anybody use shears so near his eyes.   [Illustration: ] Solomon Found Mr. Frog’s Shop Was Closed   “I’ll take off the coat,” he said. “And I know now that you’re a very poor tailor, or you wouldn’t have made such a mistake.” He began to tug at the coat. But he soon found that taking it off was not so easy as putting it on. Solomon’s sharp claws caught in the cloth; and his hooked beak, too, fastened itself in the hood the moment he tried to pull the coat over his head. “Here!” he cried to Mr. Frog. “Just lend me a hand! I can’t see to help myself.”  But Mr. Frog did not even answer him.  “Don’t you hear me?” Solomon Owl shouted, as he struggled with his new coat, only to become tangled in it more than ever.  Still, the tailor said never a word, though something very like a giggle, followed by a splash, caught Solomon’s ear.  “He’s left me!” Solomon Owl groaned.  “Mr. Frog has left me to get out of this coat alone. And goodness knows how I’m ever a-going to do it.” He threshed about so vigorously that he tripped himself and fell upon the bank of the brook, rolling over and over toward the water.  He had a very narrow escape. If he hadn’t happened to bring up against an old stump he would certainly have tumbled into the stream.  Though Solomon couldn’t see, he knew that he was in danger. So he lay on his back on the ground and carefully tore his new coat into strings and ribbons.  At last he was free. And he rose to his feet feeling very sheepish, for he knew that Mr. Frog had played a sly trick on him.  “Nevermind!” said Solomon Owl, as he flew way. “I’ll come back to-morrow and ask Mr. Frog to make me a waistcoat and trousers. And then——” He did not finish what he was saying. But there is no doubt that whatever it was, it could not have been very pleasant for Mr. Frog.  Just as he had planned, Solomon Owl returned to the brook the next day. And he was both surprised and disappointed at what he found.  The door of Mr. Frog’s tailor’s shop was shut and locked. And on it there was a sign, which said:  TO LET   “He’s moved away!” cried Solomon Owl. And he went off feeling that he had been cheated out of a good dinner—to say nothing of a new waistcoat—and new trousers, too.  He had not been gone long when the door opened. And Mr. Frog leaped nimbly outside. He took the sign off the door; and sitting down cross-legged upon the bank, he began to sew upon Jasper Jay’s new blue suit, while his face wore a wider smile than ever.  He had suddenly decided not to let his shop, after all.     VI Solomon Needs a Change   For some time Solomon Owl had known that a queer feeling was coming over him. And he could not think what it meant. He noticed, too, that his appetite was leaving him. Nothing seemed to taste good any more.  So at last, one fine fall evening he went to see Aunt Polly Woodchuck, who was an herb doctor; for he had begun to worry about his health.  “It’s lucky you came to-day,” said Aunt Polly. “Because to-night I’m going to begin my winter’s nap. And you couldn’t have seen me again till spring—unless you happened to come here on ground-hog day, next February.... What appears to be your trouble?” she inquired.  “It’s my appetite, partly,” Solomon Owl said. “Nothing tastes as it did when I was a youngster. And I keep longing for something, though what it is I can’t just tell.”  Aunt Polly Woodchuck nodded her head wisely.  “What have you been eating lately?” she asked.  Solomon Owl replied that he hadn’t eaten anything but mice since the leaves began to turn.  “H-m—the leaves are nearly all off the trees now,” the old lady remarked. “How many mice have you eaten in that time?”  Solomon said that as nearly as he could remember he had eaten twenty-seven—or a hundred and twenty-seven. He couldn’t say which—but one of those numbers was correct.  Aunt Polly Woodchuck threw up her hands.  “Sakes alive!” she cried. “It’s no wonder you don’t feel well! What you need is a change of food. And it’s lucky you came to me now. If you’d gone on like that much longer I’d hate to say what might have happened to you. You’d have had dyspepsia, or some other sort of misery in your stomach.”  “What shall I do?” asked Solomon Owl. “Insects are scarce at this season of the year. Of course, there are frogs—but I don’t seem to care for them. And there are fish—but they’re not easy to get, for they don’t come out of the water and sit on the bank, as the frogs do.”  “How about pullets?” Aunt Polly inquired.  At that Solomon Owl let out a long row of hoots, because he was pleased.  “The very thing!” he cried. “That’s what I’ve been wanting all this time. And I never guessed it.... I’ll pay you for your advice the next time I see you,” he told Aunt Polly. And Solomon Owl hurried away before she could stop him. Since he had no intention of visiting her on ground-hog day, he knew it would be spring before he saw Aunt Polly Woodchuck again.  The old lady scolded a bit. And it did not make her feel any pleasanter to hear Solomon’s mocking laughter, which grew fainter and fainter as he left the pasture behind him. Then she went inside her house, for she was fast growing sleepy. And she wanted to set things to rights before she began her long winter’s nap.  Meanwhile, Solomon Owl roamed restlessly through the woods. There was only one"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16663"],["title","The Tale of Solomon Owl (#2)"],["body","in the neighborhood where he could get a pullet. That was at Farmer Green’s chicken house. And for some reason he did not care to visit the farm buildings until it grew darker.  So he amused himself by making the woods echo with his strange cry, “_Whoo-whoo-whoo, whoo-whoo, to-whoo-ah!_” And now and then he threw in a few “_wha-whas_,” just for extra measure.  Many of the forest folk who heard him remarked that Solomon Owl seemed to be in extra fine spirits.  “Probably it’s the hunter’s moon that pleases him!” Jimmy Rabbit remarked to a friend of his. “I’ve always noticed that old Solomon makes more noise on moonlight nights than at any other time.”  The hunter’s moon, big and yellow and round, was just rising over Blue Mountain. But for once it was not the moon that made Solomon Owl so talkative. He was in fine feather, so to speak, because he was hoping to have a fat pullet for his supper. And as for the moon, he would have been just as pleased had there been none at all that night. For Solomon Owl never cared to be seen when he visited Farmer Green’s chicken house.     VII The Blazing Eyes   It was some three hours after sunset when Solomon Owl at last reached Farmer Green’s place. All was quiet in the chicken house because the hens and roosters and their families had long since gone to roost. And except for a light that shone through a window, the farmhouse showed not a sign of life.  Everything was as Solomon Owl wished it—or so he thought, at least, as he alighted in a tree in the yard to look about him. He wanted no one to interrupt him when he should go nosing around the chicken house, to find an opening.  To his annoyance, he had not sat long in the tree when the wood-shed door opened. And Solomon stared in amazement at the strange sight he saw.  A great head appeared, with eyes and mouth—yes! and nose, too—all a glaring flame color. Solomon had never seen such a horrible face on man or bird or beast. But he was sure it was a man, for he heard a laugh that was not to be mistaken for either a beast’s or a bird’s. And the worst of it was, those blazing eyes were turned squarely toward Farmer Green’s chicken house!  Solomon Owl was too wary to go for his fat pullet just then. He decided that he would wait quietly in the tree for a time, hoping that the man would go away.  While Solomon watched him the stranger neither moved nor spoke. And, of course, Solomon Owl was growing hungrier every minute. So at last he felt that he simply _must_ say something.  “Who-who-who-are-you?” he called out from his tree.  But the strange man did not answer. He did not even turn his head.  “He must be some city person,” Solomon Owl said to himself. “He thinks he’s too good to speak to a countryman like me.”  Then Solomon sat up and listened. He heard a scratching sound. And soon he saw a plump figure crawl right up into his tree-top.  It was Fatty Coon!  “What are you doing here?” Solomon Owl asked in a low voice, which was not any too pleasant.  “I’m out for an airing,” Fatty answered. “Beautiful night—isn’t it?”  But Solomon Owl was not interested in the weather. “I don’t suppose you’ve come down here to get a chicken, have you?” he inquired.  Fatty Coon seemed greatly surprised at the question.  “Why—no!” he exclaimed. “But now that you speak of it, it reminds me that Farmer Green’s saving a pullet for me. He was heard to say not long ago that he would like to catch me taking one of his hens. So he must have one for me. And I don’t want to disappoint him.”  At first Solomon Owl didn’t know what answer to make. But at last he turned his head toward Fatty.  “Why don’t you go and get your pullet now?” he asked.  “There’s that man down below, with the glaring eyes—” said Fatty Coon. “I’ve been waiting around here for quite a long time and he hasn’t looked away from the chicken house even once.... Do you know him?”  “No! And I don’t want to!” said Solomon Owl.  “S-sh!” Fatty Coon held up a warning hand. “Who’s that?” he asked, peering down at a dark object at the foot of their tree.  Then both he and Solomon saw that it was Tommy Fox, sitting on his haunches and staring at the big head, with its blazing eyes and nose and mouth.  “Not looking for chickens, I suppose?” Solomon Owl called in a low tone, which was hardly more than a whisper.  But Tommy Fox’s sharp ears heard him easily. And he looked up, licking his chops as if he were very hungry indeed. And all the while the stranger continued to stare straight at the chicken house, as if he did not intend to let anybody go  prowling about that long, low building to steal any of Farmer Green’s poultry.  It was no wonder that the three chicken-lovers (two in the tree and one beneath it) hesitated. If the queer man had only spoken they might not have been so timid. But he said never a word.     VIII Watching The Chickens   Solomon Owl and Fatty Coon couldn’t help laughing at what Tommy Fox said to them, as they sat in their tree near the farmhouse, looking down at him in the moonlight.  “I’m here to watch Farmer Green’s chickens for him—” said he—“to see that no rat—or anybody else—runs away with a pullet.”  “Farmer Green has someone else watching for him to-night,” said Solomon Owl, when he had stopped laughing. “There’s that strange man! You can see how he keeps his glaring eyes fixed on the chicken house. And unless I’m mistaken, he’s on the lookout for _you_.”  “No such thing!” Tommy Fox snapped. And he looked up at Solomon as if he wished that he could climb the tree.  “Here comes somebody else!” Fatty Coon exclaimed suddenly. His keen eyes had caught sight of Jimmy Rabbit, hopping along on his way to the vegetable garden, to see if he couldn’t find a stray cabbage or a turnip.  Solomon Owl called to him. Whereupon, Jimmy Rabbit promptly sat up and looked at the odd trio. If it hadn’t been for Tommy Fox he would have drawn nearer.  “Do you know that stranger?” Solomon Owl asked him, pointing out the horrible head to Jimmy.  “I haven’t the pleasure,” said Jimmy Rabbit, after he had taken a good look.  “Well,” said Solomon, “won’t you kindly speak to him; and ask him to go away?”  “Certainly!” answered Jimmy Rabbit, who always tried to be obliging.  “I hope the stranger won’t eat him,” remarked Tommy Fox, “because I hope to do that some day, myself.”  It was queer—but Jimmy Rabbit was the only one of the four that wasn’t afraid of those glaring features. He hopped straight up to the big round head, which was just a bit higher than one of the fence posts, against which the stranger seemed to be leaning. And after a moment or two Jimmy Rabbit called to Solomon and Fatty and Tommy Fox:  “He won’t go away! He’s going to stay right where he is!”  “Come here a minute!” said Tommy.  Jimmy Rabbit shook his head.  “You come over here!” he answered. And he did not stir from the side of the stranger. He knew very well that Tommy Fox was afraid of the man with the head with the glaring eyes.  As for Tommy Fox, he did not even reply—that is, to Jimmy Rabbit. But he spoke his mind freely enough to his two friends in the tree.  “It seems to me one of you ought to do something,” said he. “We’ll eat no pullets to-night if we can’t get rid of this meddlesome stranger.”  Fatty Coon quite agreed with him.  “The one who was here first is the one to act!” Fatty declared. “That’s _you!_” he told Solomon Owl.  So Solomon Owl felt most uncomfortable.  “I don’t know what I can do,” he said. “I spoke to the stranger—asked him who he was. And he wouldn’t answer me.”  “Can’t you frighten him away?” Tommy Fox inquired. “Fly right over his head and give him a blow with your wing as you pass!”  Solomon Owl coughed. He was embarrassed, to say the least.  “He’s afraid!” Fatty Coon cried. And both he and Tommy Fox kept repeating, over and over again, “He’s afraid! He’s afraid! He’s afraid!”  It was really more than Solomon Owl could stand.  “I’m not!” he retorted angrily. “Watch me and you’ll see!” And without another word he darted out of the tree and swooped down upon the stranger, just brushing the top of his head. Solomon Owl knew at once that he had knocked something off the top of that dreadful head—something that fell to the ground and made Jimmy Rabbit jump nervously.  Then Solomon returned to his perch in the tree.  “He hasn’t moved,” he said. “But I knocked off his hat.”  “You took off the top of his head!” cried Fatty Coon in great excitement. “Look! The inside of his head is afire.”  And peering down from the tree-top, Solomon Owl saw that Fatty Coon had told the truth.     IX Hallowe’en   Solomon Owl was afraid of fire. And when he looked down from his perch in the tree and saw, through the hole in the stranger’s crown, that all was aglow inside his big, round head, Solomon couldn’t help voicing his horror. He “_whoo-whooed_” so loudly that Tommy Fox, at the foot of the tree, asked him what on earth was the matter.  “His head’s all afire!” Solomon Owl told him. “That’s what makes his eyes glare so. And that’s why the fire shines through his mouth and his nose, too. It’s no wonder he didn’t answer my question—for, of course, his tongue must certainly be burned to a cinder.”  “Then it ought to be safe for anybody to enter the chicken house,” Tommy Fox observed. “What could the stranger do, when he’s in such a fix?”  “He could set the chicken house afire, if he followed you inside,” replied Solomon Owl wisely. “And I, for one, am not going near the pullets to-night.”  “Nor I!” Fatty Coon echoed. “I’m going straight to the cornfield. The corn is still standing there in shocks; and I ought to find enough ears to make a good meal.”  But Solomon Owl and Tommy Fox were not interested in corn. They never ate it. And so it is not surprising that they should be greatly disappointed. After a person has his mouth all made up for chicken it is hard to think of anything that would taste even half as good.  “It’s queer he doesn’t go and hold his head under the pump,” said Solomon Owl. “That’s what I should"]]]
