It was Grandma Elsie who at length succeeded in speaking a word in season to the dying woman.  \"Oh, this racking cough! Shall I never be done with it?\" gasped Laura, as she lay panting upon her pillow after an unusually severe and exhausting paroxysm.  \"Yes; when you reach the other side of Jordan; for there in that blessed land the inhabitant shall not say 'I am sick,'\" returned Grandma Elsie in low, sympathising tones. \"The Bible tells us that 'God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain.'\"  \"Oh, but I am not fit for that place yet!\" exclaimed Laura with a look of alarm, \"and I don't want to die for years to come, though it is hard to suffer as I do. You don't think I'm a dying woman, Mrs. Travilla?\"  \"You know, dear friend, that no one of us is certain of life for a day or an hour,\" returned Grandma Elsie gently, taking the wasted hand in hers and gazing tenderly into the anxious, troubled face, \"and surely it is the part of wisdom to make careful preparation for that which we must inevitably meet, sooner or later. And if our peace is made with God--if Jesus is our Friend and Saviour--it will only be joy unspeakable to be called into his immediate presence, there to dwell forevermore.\"  \"Yes, yes, if one is fitted for it, as Eric, Eva's father, was. Death seemed only joy to him, except for leaving us. But oh, I am afraid of death! Hard as life is in my weak, ailing condition, I don't want to die, I can't bear to think of it.\"  \"My poor friend, my heart bleeds for you,\" said Grandma Elsie in low, tender tones. \"'The sting of death is sin and the strength of sin is the law.' But 'Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to everyone that believeth.' He fulfilled its conditions, he bore the penalty God's justice required against those who had broken it; and now salvation is offered as his free gift to all who will accept it: 'Even the righteousness of God which is by faith of Jesus Christ unto all and upon all them that believe: for there is no difference: For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God; Being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus: Whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God; To declare, I say, at this time his righteousness: that he might be just and the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus.'\"  \"Is that all? only to believe in Jesus?\" Laura asked with a look of mingled anxiety, hope, and fear. \"But one must repent deeply, sincerely, and oh, I'm afraid I cannot!\"  \"He will help you,\" returned Grandma Elsie in moved tones. \"'Him hath God exalted with his right hand to be a Prince and a Saviour, for to give repentance to Israel, and forgiveness of sins.' Ask him, remembering his own gracious promise, 'Ask and it shall be given you; seek and ye shall find; knock and it shall be opened unto you. For everyone that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened.'\"  \"Ah, I see the way as I never did before,\" said Laura, after a moment's silence in which she seemed in deep thought. \"What wonderful love and condescension it was for him, the God-man, to die that painful and shameful death that we--sinful worms of the dust--might live! Oh, I do begin to love him and to hate and abhor my sins that helped nail him to the tree.\" With the last words tears coursed down her cheeks. \"I want to be his, whether I live or die,\" she added; and from that hour a great change came over her; her sufferings were borne with patience and resignation; and when the end came she passed peacefully and quietly away, leaving her bereaved daughter mourning the separation, but not as those without hope of a blessed reunion at some future day, in that land where sin and sorrow, sickness and pain are unknown.     CHAPTER III.   Through all the six long weeks of her mother's illness at Fairview Evelyn had been a most devoted, tender nurse, scarcely leaving the sick room for an hour by day or by night. She bore up wonderfully until all was over and the worn-out body laid to rest in the quiet grave; but then came the reaction; strength and energy seemed suddenly to forsake her, and thin, pale, sad, and heavy-eyed, she was but the shadow of her former self.  Change of air and scene was the doctor's prescription. She was very reluctant to leave home and friends for a sojourn in new scenes and among strangers, but receiving an urgent invitation from Captain and Mrs. Raymond to spend some weeks at Woodburn with her loved friend Lucilla, and finding that her uncle and aunt--Dr. Conly also--highly approved, she gladly accepted; all the more so because she had learned that Grandma Elsie too, whom she loved even better than ever for her kindness to the dear departed, was about to spend some days or weeks with her daughter Violet. That was an added attraction to what Evelyn esteemed one of the most delightful places, and inhabited by the dearest, kindest, most lovable people anywhere to be found.  She was most heartily welcomed by the entire family, Lucilla and Grace being particularly joyful over her arrival.  It was delightful spring weather, and family and guests, older and younger, spent much of the time in the beautiful grounds or in driving and riding about the country.  The captain pronounced Eva hardly in a fit condition for study, and for her sake required his daughters Lucilla and Grace to pass only an hour or two daily in the schoolroom; so that they were able to give to Eva as much of their society as he considered desirable for her under the circumstances--seeing that she needed a good deal of quiet rest and sleep in order to regain the youthful vigour she had lost during the exhausting nursing of her invalid mother.  His kindness was highly appreciated by all three, and under its benign influence Eva made rapid improvement in health and spirits, enjoying every day of her sojourn at Woodburn, the Sabbath even more than any other, especially the afternoon study of the Bible in which all took part, from Grandma Elsie and Captain Raymond down to little Ned.  The subject chosen for the first lesson after Eva's coming was the resurrection, probably selected especially for Eva's comfort in her sorrow over her mother's recent departure, to be with her no more in this life.  \"Mother,\" the captain said, addressing Grandma Elsie, when they were all seated, each with a Bible in hand, \"as you are somewhat older and certainly much wiser than I--especially as regards spiritual things--will you not take the lead to-day?\"  \"Older I certainly am,\" returned Mrs. Travilla, with her own sweet smile, \"but I think not wiser than yourself, captain; and certainly I have not made the preparation for this occasion which doubtless you have. So please lead the exercises just as you would if I were not present.\"  \"You would prefer my doing so?\" he asked.  \"Very much,\" she replied. \"The resurrection is the subject?\"  \"Yes; and what a glorious one! how full of comfort for all who believe in Christ! 'For I know that my Redeemer liveth, and that he shall stand at the latter day upon the earth; and though after my death my body is destroyed, yet in my flesh shall I see God; whom I shall see for myself and mine eyes shall behold, and not another,' said the patriarch Job; comforting himself in his affliction with that blessed prospect. The doctrine of a general resurrection is expressly taught in both the Old Testament and the New, and I think we cannot spend our lesson hour more profitably than in looking up the texts on the subject. Can you give us one, mother?\"  At that Grandma Elsie opened her Bible.  \"Beginning with the Old Testament,\" she said, \"here in Psalms xlix. 15 we read: 'But God will redeem my soul from the power of the grave: for he shall receive me. Selah.' Then here in Isaiah; 'Thy dead men shall live, together with my dead body shall they arise. Awake and sing, ye that dwell in dust: for thy dew is as the dew of herbs, and the earth shall cast out the dead.'\"  Then Violet, sitting next, read from her open Bible: \"'The same day came to him the Sadducees, which say that there is no resurrection, and asked him, saying, Master, Moses said, if a man die, having no children, his brother shall marry his wife, and raise up seed unto his brother. Now there were with us seven brethren: and the first, when he had married a wife, deceased, and having no issue, left his wife unto his brother: likewise the second also, and the third unto the seventh. And last of all the woman died also. Therefore in the resurrection, whose wife shall she be? for they all had her. Jesus answered and said unto them, Ye do err, not knowing the Scriptures, nor the power of God. For in the resurrection they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are as the angels of God in heaven. But as touching the resurrection of the dead, have ye not read that which was spoken unto you by God, saying, I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob? God is not the God of the dead, but of the living.'\"  Eva's turn came next and she read: \"'And the graves were opened; and many bodies of the saints which slept arose, and came out of the graves after his resurrection, and went into the holy city, and appeared unto many.'\"  Then Lucilla: \"'Women received their dead raised to life again: and others were tortured, not accepting deliverance; that they might obtain a better resurrection.'\"  \"Will the resurrection be of all the dead, Grace? the wicked as well as the righteous?\" asked her father.  \"Yes, papa,\" she answered; then read aloud: \"'Marvel not at this: for the hour is coming, in the which all that are in the graves shall hear "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/175"],["title","The Phantom of the Opera (#1)"],["body","me; and, thanks to them, I shall be able to reproduce those hours of sheer love and terror, in their smallest details, before the reader's eyes.  And I should be ungrateful indeed if I omitted, while standing on the threshold of this dreadful and veracious story, to thank the present management the Opera, which has so kindly assisted me in all my inquiries, and M. Messager in particular, together with M. Gabion, the acting-manager, and that most amiable of men, the architect intrusted with the preservation of the building, who did not hesitate to lend me the works of Charles Garnier, although he was almost sure that I would never return them to him.  Lastly, I must pay a public tribute to the generosity of my friend and former collaborator, M. J. Le Croze, who allowed me to dip into his splendid theatrical library and to borrow the rarest editions of books by which he set great store.  GASTON LEROUX.    Chapter I  Is it the Ghost?   It was the evening on which MM. Debienne and Poligny, the managers of the Opera, were giving a last gala performance to mark their retirement.  Suddenly the dressing-room of La Sorelli, one of the principal dancers, was invaded by half-a-dozen young ladies of the ballet, who had come up from the stage after \"dancing\" Polyeucte.  They rushed in amid great confusion, some giving vent to forced and unnatural laughter, others to cries of terror.  Sorelli, who wished to be alone for a moment to \"run through\" the speech which she was to make to the resigning managers, looked around angrily at the mad and tumultuous crowd.  It was little Jammes--the girl with the tip-tilted nose, the forget-me-not eyes, the rose-red cheeks and the lily-white neck and shoulders--who gave the explanation in a trembling voice:  \"It's the ghost!\"  And she locked the door.  Sorelli's dressing-room was fitted up with official, commonplace elegance.  A pier-glass, a sofa, a dressing-table and a cupboard or two provided the necessary furniture.  On the walls hung a few engravings, relics of the mother, who had known the glories of the old Opera in the Rue le Peletier; portraits of Vestris, Gardel, Dupont, Bigottini.  But the room seemed a palace to the brats of the corps de ballet, who were lodged in common dressing-rooms where they spent their time singing, quarreling, smacking the dressers and hair-dressers and buying one another glasses of cassis, beer, or even rhum, until the call-boy's bell rang.  Sorelli was very superstitious.  She shuddered when she heard little Jammes speak of the ghost, called her a \"silly little fool\" and then, as she was the first to believe in ghosts in general, and the Opera ghost in particular, at once asked for details:  \"Have you seen him?\"  \"As plainly as I see you now!\" said little Jammes, whose legs were giving way beneath her, and she dropped with a moan into a chair.  Thereupon little Giry--the girl with eyes black as sloes, hair black as ink, a swarthy complexion and a poor little skin stretched over poor little bones--little Giry added:  \"If that's the ghost, he's very ugly!\"  \"Oh, yes!\" cried the chorus of ballet-girls.  And they all began to talk together.  The ghost had appeared to them in the shape of a gentleman in dress-clothes, who had suddenly stood before them in the passage, without their knowing where he came from. He seemed to have come straight through the wall.  \"Pooh!\" said one of them, who had more or less kept her head.  \"You see the ghost everywhere!\"  And it was true.  For several months, there had been nothing discussed at the Opera but this ghost in dress-clothes who stalked about the building, from top to bottom, like a shadow, who spoke to nobody, to whom nobody dared speak and who vanished as soon as he was seen, no one knowing how or where.  As became a real ghost, he made no noise in walking.  People began by laughing and making fun of this specter dressed like a man of fashion or an undertaker; but the ghost legend soon swelled to enormous proportions among the corps de ballet.  All the girls pretended to have met this supernatural being more or less often.  And those who laughed the loudest were not the most at ease. When he did not show himself, he betrayed his presence or his passing by accident, comic or serious, for which the general superstition held him responsible.  Had any one met with a fall, or suffered a practical joke at the hands of one of the other girls, or lost a powderpuff, it was at once the fault of the ghost, of the Opera ghost.  After all, who had seen him?  You meet so many men in dress-clothes at the Opera who are not ghosts.  But this dress-suit had a peculiarity of its own.  It covered a skeleton.  At least, so the ballet-girls said. And, of course, it had a death's head.  Was all this serious?  The truth is that the idea of the skeleton came from the description of the ghost given by Joseph Buquet, the chief scene-shifter, who had really seen the ghost.  He had run up against the ghost on the little staircase, by the footlights, which leads to \"the cellars.\"  He had seen him for a second--for the ghost had fled--and to any one who cared to listen to him he said:  \"He is extraordinarily thin and his dress-coat hangs on a skeleton frame.  His eyes are so deep that you can hardly see the fixed pupils. You just see two big black holes, as in a dead man's skull.  His skin, which is stretched across his bones like a drumhead, is not white, but a nasty yellow.  His nose is so little worth talking about that you can't see it side-face; and THE ABSENCE of that nose is a horrible thing TO LOOK AT.  All the hair he has is three or four long dark locks on his forehead and behind his ears.\"  This chief scene-shifter was a serious, sober, steady man, very slow at imagining things.  His words were received with interest and amazement; and soon there were other people to say that they too had met a man in dress-clothes with a death's head on his shoulders.  Sensible men who had wind of the story began by saying that Joseph Buquet had been the victim of a joke played by one of his assistants.  And then, one after the other, there came a series of incidents so curious and so inexplicable that the very shrewdest people began to feel uneasy.  For instance, a fireman is a brave fellow!  He fears nothing, least of all fire!  Well, the fireman in question, who had gone to make a round of inspection in the cellars and who, it seems, had ventured a little farther than usual, suddenly reappeared on the stage, pale, scared, trembling, with his eyes starting out of his head, and practically fainted in the arms of the proud mother of little Jammes.[1]  And why? Because he had seen coming toward him, AT THE LEVEL OF HIS HEAD, BUT WITHOUT A BODY ATTACHED TO IT, A HEAD OF FIRE!  And, as I said, a fireman is not afraid of fire.  The fireman's name was Pampin.  The corps de ballet was flung into consternation.  At first sight, this fiery head in no way corresponded with Joseph Buquet's description of the ghost.  But the young ladies soon persuaded themselves that the ghost had several heads, which he changed about as he pleased.  And, of course, they at once imagined that they were in the greatest danger. Once a fireman did not hesitate to faint, leaders and front-row and back-row girls alike had plenty of excuses for the fright that made them quicken their pace when passing some dark corner or ill-lighted corridor.  Sorelli herself, on the day after the adventure of the fireman, placed a horseshoe on the table in front of the stage-door-keeper's box, which every one who entered the Opera otherwise than as a spectator must touch before setting foot on the first tread of the staircase.  This horse-shoe was not invented by me--any more than any other part of this story, alas!--and may still be seen on the table in the passage outside the stage-door-keeper's box, when you enter the Opera through the court known as the Cour de l'Administration.  To return to the evening in question.  \"It's the ghost!\" little Jammes had cried.  An agonizing silence now reigned in the dressing-room. Nothing was heard but the hard breathing of the girls.  At last, Jammes, flinging herself upon the farthest corner of the wall, with every mark of real terror on her face, whispered:  \"Listen!\"  Everybody seemed to hear a rustling outside the door.  There was no sound of footsteps.  It was like light silk sliding over the panel. Then it stopped.  Sorelli tried to show more pluck than the others.  She went up to the door and, in a quavering voice, asked:  \"Who's there?\"  But nobody answered.  Then feeling all eyes upon her, watching her last movement, she made an effort to show courage, and said very loudly:  \"Is there any one behind the door?\"  \"Oh, yes, yes!  Of course there is!\" cried that little dried plum of a Meg Giry, heroically holding Sorelli back by her gauze skirt. \"Whatever you do, don't open the door!  Oh, Lord, don't open the door!\"  But Sorelli, armed with a dagger that never left her, turned the key and drew back the door, while the ballet-girls retreated to the inner dressing-room and Meg Giry sighed:  \"Mother!  Mother!\"  Sorelli looked into the passage bravely.  It was empty; a gas-flame, in its glass prison, cast a red and suspicious light into the surrounding darkness, without succeeding in dispelling it.  And the dancer slammed the door again, with a deep sigh.  \"No,\" she said, \"there is no one there.\"  \"Still, we saw him!\"  Jammes declared, returning with timid little steps to her place beside Sorelli.  \"He must be somewhere prowling about.  I shan't go back to dress.  We had better all go down to the foyer together, at once, for the 'speech,' and we will come up again together.\"  And the child reverently touched the little coral finger-ring which she wore as a charm against bad luck, while Sorelli, stealthily, with the tip of her pink right thumb-nail, made a St. Andrew's cross on the wooden ring which adorned the fourth finger of her left hand.
