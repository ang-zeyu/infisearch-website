These men were too self-interested to follow the group-thoughts which controlled the centers of empire, and the seams and wrinkles of their faces stamped a rough kind of individuality even more visually upon them.  Of them all, the man who was instantly recognizable in any crowd like this was Rene Malhomme; Rynason immediately saw the man in one corner of the room. He stood six and a half feet tall, heavily muscled and a bit wild-eyed; his greying hair fell in disorder over his dirty forehead and sprayed out over his ears. He was surrounded by laughing and shouting men; Rynason couldn't tell from this distance whether he was engaged in one of his usual heated arguments on religion or in his other avocation of recounting stories of the women he had \"converted\". He waved a black-lettered sign saying REPENT! over his head--but then, he always did.  Rynason found Manning in the back, sitting under a cheap print of a Picasso nude with cold light trained on it in typically bad taste. He had a woman with him. Rynason recognized her--Mara Stephens, in charge of communications and supplies for the survey team. She was a strange girl, aloof but not hard, and she carried herself with a quiet dignity. What was she doing with Manning?  He passed a waiter on his way to the table and ordered a drink. Malhomme saw him as he passed: \"Lee Rynason! Come and join me in repentance! Give your soul to God and your money to the barman, for as the prophet sayeth, lo, I am dry! Join us!\"  Rynason grinned and shook his head, walking past. He grabbed one of the light-metal chairs and sat down next to Mara.  \"You wanted to see me,\" he said to Manning.  Manning looked up at him to apparent surprise. \"Lee! Yes, yes--sit down. Wait, we'll get you a drink.\"  So he was in that kind of a mood. \"I've got one coming,\" Rynason said. \"What's our problem today?\"  Manning smiled broadly. \"No problem, Lee; no problem at all. Not unless you want to make one.\" He chuckled goodnaturedly, a tacit statement that he was expecting no such thing. \"I've got good news today, by god. You tell him, Mara.\"  Rynason turned to the girl, who smiled briefly. \"It just came over the telecom,\" she said. \"Manning has a good chance for the governorship here. The Council is supposed to announce its decision in two weeks.\"  Rynason looked over at Manning, his face expressionless. \"Congratulations. How did this happen?\"  \"I've got an inside track; friend of mine knows several of the big guys. Throws parties, things like that. He's been putting in a word for me, here and there.\"  \"Isn't this a bit out of your line?\" Rynason said.  Manning sat back, a large man with close-cropped dark hair and heavy features. His beard was trimmed to a thin line along the ridge of his jaw--a style that was popular on the inner worlds, but rarely seen here on the Edge. \"This _is_ my line,\" he said. \"God, this is what I was after when I took this damned job. Survey teams are a dime a dozen out here, Lee; it's no job for a man.\"  \"We've got sort of a special case here,\" Rynason said evenly, glancing at Mara. She smiled at him. \"We haven't run into any alien races before that were intelligent.\"  Manning laughed, and took a long swallow of his drink. \"Twenty-six lousy horsefaces--now there's an important discovery for you. No, Lee, this is peanuts. For that matter, they may be running into intelligent aliens all over the Edge by now--communication isn't so reliable out here that we'd necessarily know about it. What we've found here isn't any more important than all the rubble and trash the Outsiders left behind.\"  \"Still, it _is_ unique so far,\" Mara said.  \"I'll tell you exactly how unique it is,\" Manning said, leaning forward and setting down his glass with a bang. \"It's just unique enough that I can make it sound important in my report to the Council. I can make myself sound a little impressive. That's how important it is; no more than that.\"  Rynason pursed his lips, but didn't say anything. The waiter arrived with his drink; he threw a green coin onto the table which was scooped up before it had finished ringing to a stop, and sat back with the glass in his hand.  \"Is that your pitch to the Council?\" he asked. \"You're telling them that Hirlaj is an important archaeological area and that's why you should get the governorship?\"  \"Something like that,\" Manning nodded. \"That, and my friend at Seventeenth Cluster headquarters. Incidentally, he's an idiot and a slob--turns on quadsense telemuse instead of working, drinks hopsbrau from his own sector. I can't stand him. But I did him a few favors, just in case, and they're paying off.\"  \"I think it's marvelous the way our frontier policy caters to the colonists,\" Mara said quietly. She was still smiling, but it was an ironic smile which suddenly struck Rynason as characteristic of her.  He knew exactly what she meant. Manning's little push for power was nothing new or shocking in Terran frontier politics. With the rapid expansion of the Edge through the centuries, the frontier policy of the Confederation had had to adapt itself to comparatively slipshod methods of setting up governments in the newly-opened areas. Back in the early days they'd tried sending out trained men from each Cluster headquarters, but that had been foredoomed to failure: travel between the stars was slow, and too often the governors had arrived after local officialdoms had already been established, and there had been clashes. The colonists had almost always backed the local governments, and there were a few full-scale revolts when the system had been backed too militantly by Cluster headquarters.  So the Local Autonomy System had been sanctioned. The colonists would always support their own men, who at least knew conditions in the areas they were to govern. But since this necessarily limited the choice of Edge governorships to the roustabouts and drifters who wandered the outworlds, the resulting administrations were probably even more corrupt than they had been under the old system of what had amounted to centralized graft. The Cluster Councils retained the power of appointing the local governors, but aside from that the newly-opened worlds of the Edge were completely under their own rule. Some of the more vocal critics of the Local Autonomy System had dubbed it instead the Indigenous Corruption System; it was by now a fairly standard nickname in the outworlds.  The system made for a wide-open frontier--bustling, wild, hectic, and rich. For the worlds of the Edge were untamed worlds, raw and forbidding, and the policy of the Councils was calculated to attract the kind of men who not only could but would open these frontiers. The roustabouts, the low drifters of the spaceways ... men who were hard and strong from repeated knocks, who were looking for a way to work or fight their way up. The lean and hungry of the outworlds.  Rynason glanced across the table at Manning. He was neither lean nor hungry, but he had that look in his eyes. Rynason had been around the Edge for years--his father had travelled the spacers in the commercial lines--and he had seen that look on many men, in the fields and mines, in the spaceports, in the quickly-tarnished prefab towns that sprang up almost overnight when a planetfall was made. He could recognize it on Manning despite the man's casual, self-satisfied expression.  \"You don't have to worry about the colonists here,\" Manning was saying to the girl. \"I'll treat 'em decently. There'll be money to be made here, and I can make it without stepping on too many toes.\"  Mara seemed amused. \"And what would happen if you _had_ to step on them to make your money? What if Hirlaj doesn't turn out to have any natural resources worth exploiting--a whole civilization has been here for thousands of years? What if the colony here starts to falter, and the men move on?\"  Manning frowned at her for a moment, then gave a grunting laugh. \"No chance of that. It's like Lee was just saying--this planet is an important discovery--we've got tame aliens here, intelligent horsefaces that you can lead around with a rope on their necks. That alone will draw tourists. Maybe we'll set up an official Restricted Ground, a sort of reservation.\"  \"A zoo, you mean,\" Rynason interrupted.  Manning raised an amused eyebrow at him. \"A reservation, I said. You know what reservations are like, Lee.\"  Rynason glared at the heavier man, then subsided. There was no point in getting into a fight over if's and maybe's; in the outworlds you learned quickly to confine your clashes to tangibles. \"Why did you want to see me?\" he said.  \"I want your preliminary report completed,\" Manning said. \"I've got to have my complete report collated and transmitted within the week, if it's to have any effect on the Council. Most of the boys have got them in already; Breune and Larsborg have promised theirs within four days. But you're still holding me up.\"  Rynason took a long swallow of his drink and put it down empty. The noise and smell of the bar seemed to grow around him, washing over him. It might have been the effects of the tarpaq in the drink, but he felt his stomach tighten and turn slightly when he thought of how Earth's culture presented itself, warped itself, here on the frontier Edge. Was this land of mercenary, slipshod rush really what had carried Earthmen to the stars?  \"I don't know if I'll have much to report for at least a week,\" he said shortly.  \"Then give me a report on what you've got!\" Manning snapped. \"If nothing else, turn in your transcripts and I'll do the report myself; I can handle it. What the hell do you mean, you won't have much to report?\"  \"Larsborg said the same thing,\" Mara interjected.  \"Larsborg said he'd have his report ready in a couple of days anyway!\"  \"I'll give you what I've got as soon as I can,\" Rynason said. \"But things are just beginning to break for me--did you see my note this afternoon?\"  \"Yes,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17959"],["title","The Hand of Fu-Manchu (#1)"],["body","rowth, which served to accentuate the cavitous hollowness of his face. His eyes seemed starting from their sockets as he lay upon his back uttering inarticulate sounds and plucking with skinny fingers at his lips.  Smith bent forward peering into the wasted face; and then started back with a suppressed cry.  \"Merciful God! can it be Hale?\" he muttered. \"What does it mean? what does it mean?\"  I ran to the opposite side of the bed, and placing my arms under the writhing man, raised him and propped a pillow at his back. He continued to babble, rolling his eyes from side to side hideously; then by degrees they seemed to become less glazed, and a light of returning sanity entered them. They became fixed; and they were fixed upon Nayland Smith, who bending over the bed, was watching Sir Gregory (for Sir Gregory I concluded this pitiable wreck to be) with an expression upon his face compound of many emotions.  \"A glass of water,\" I said, catching the glance of the man Beeton, who stood trembling at the open doorway.  Spilling a liberal quantity upon the carpet, Beeton ultimately succeeded in conveying the glass to me. Hale, never taking his gaze from Smith, gulped a little of the water and then thrust my hand away. As I turned to place the tumbler upon a small table the resumed the wordless babbling, and now, with his index finger, pointed to his mouth.  \"He has lost the power of speech!\" whispered Smith.  \"He was stricken dumb, gentlemen, ten minutes ago,\" said Beeton in a trembling voice. \"He dropped off to sleep out there on the floor, and I brought him in here and laid him on the bed. When he woke up he was like that!\"  The man on the bed ceased his inchoate babbling and now, gulping noisily, began to make quick nervous movements with his hands.  \"He wants to write something,\" said Smith in a low voice. \"Quick! hold him up!\" He thrust his notebook, open at a blank page, before the man whose movement were numbered, and placed a pencil in the shaking right hand.  Faintly and unevenly Sir Gregory commenced to write--whilst I supported him. Across the bent shoulders Smith silently questioned me, and my reply was a negative shake of the head.  The lamp above the bed was swaying as if in a heavy draught; I remembered that it had been swaying as we entered. There was no fog in the room, but already from the bleak corridor outside it was entering; murky, yellow clouds steaming in at the open door. Save for the gulping of the dying man, and the sobbing breaths of Beeton, there was no sound. Six irregular lines Sir Gregory Hale scrawled upon the page; then suddenly his body became a dead weight in my arms. Gently I laid him back upon the pillows, gently his finger from the notebook, and, my head almost touching Smith's as we both craned forward over the page, read, with great difficulty, the following:--    \"Guard my diary.... Tibetan frontier ... Key of India. Beware man ...   with the limp. Yellow ... rising.   Watch Tibet ... the _Si-Fan_....\"  From somewhere outside the room, whether above or below I could not be sure, came a faint, dragging sound, accompanied by a _tap--tap--tap_....    CHAPTER III  \"SAKYA MUNI\"   The faint disturbance faded into silence again. Across the dead man's body I met Smith's gaze. Faint wreaths of fog floated in from the outer room. Beeton clutched the foot of the bed, and the structure shook in sympathy with his wild trembling. That was the only sound now; there was absolutely nothing physical so far as my memory serves to signalize the coming of the brown man.  Yet, stealthy as his approach had been, something must have warned us. For suddenly, with one accord, we three turned upon the bed, and stared out into the room from which the fog wreaths floated in.  Beeton stood nearest to the door, but, although he turned, he did not go out, but with a smothered cry crouched back against the bed. Smith it was who moved first, then I followed, and close upon his heels burst into the disordered sitting-room. The outer door had been closed but not bolted, and what with the tinted light, diffused through the silken Japanese shade, and the presence of fog in the room, I was almost tempted to believe myself the victim of a delusion. What I saw or thought I saw was this:--  A tall screen stood immediately inside the door, and around its end, like some materialization of the choking mist, glided a lithe, yellow figure, a slim, crouching figure, wearing a sort of loose robe. An impression I had of jet-black hair, protruding from beneath a little cap, of finely chiseled features and great, luminous eyes, then, with no sound to tell of a door opened or shut, the apparition was gone.  \"You saw him, Petrie!--you saw him!\" cried Smith.  In three bounds he was across the room, had tossed the screen aside and thrown open the door. Out he sprang into the yellow haze of the corridor, tripped, and, uttering a cry of pain, fell sprawling upon the marble floor. Hot with apprehension I joined him, but he looked up with a wry smile and began furiously rubbing his left shin.  \"A queer trick, Petrie,\" he said, rising to his feet; \"but nevertheless effective.\"  He pointed to the object which had occasioned his fall. It was a small metal chest, evidently of very considerable weight, and it stood immediately outside the door of Number 14a.  \"That was what he came for, sir! That was what he came for! You were too quick for him!\"  Beeton stood behind us, his horror-bright eyes fixed upon the box.  \"Eh?\" rapped Smith, turning upon him.  \"That's what Sir Gregory brought to England,\" the man ran on almost hysterically; \"that's what he's been guarding this past two weeks, night and day, crouching over it with a loaded pistol. That's what cost him his life, sir. He's had no peace, day or night, since he got it....\"  We were inside the room again now, Smith bearing the coffer in his arms, and still the man ran on:  \"He's never slept for more than an hour at a time, that I know of, for weeks past. Since the day we came here he hasn't spoken to another living soul, and he's lain there on the floor at night with his head on that brass box, and sat watching over it all day.\"  \"'Beeton!' he'd cry out, perhaps in the middle of the night--'Beeton-- do you hear that damned woman!' But although I'd begun to think I could hear something, I believe it was the constant strain working on my nerves and nothing else at all.  \"Then he was always listening out for some one he called 'the man with the limp.' Five and six times a night he'd have me up to listen with him. 'There he goes, Beeton!' he'd whisper, crouching with his ear pressed flat to the door. 'Do you hear him dragging himself along?'  \"God knows how I've stood it as I have; for I've known no peace since we left China. Once we got here I thought it would be better, but it's been worse.  \"Gentlemen have come (from the India Office, I believe), but he would not see them. Said he would see no one but Mr. Nayland Smith. He had never lain in his bed until to-night, but what with taking no proper food nor sleep, and some secret trouble that was killing him by inches, he collapsed altogether a while ago, and I carried him in and laid him on the bed as I told you. Now he's dead--now he's dead.\"  Beeton leant up against the mantelpiece and buried his face in his hands, whilst his shoulders shook convulsively. He had evidently been greatly attached to his master, and I found something very pathetic in this breakdown of a physically strong man. Smith laid his hands upon his shoulders.  \"You have passed through a very trying ordeal,\" he said, \"and no man could have done his duty better; but forces beyond your control have proved too strong for you. I am Nayland Smith.\"  The man spun around with a surprising expression of relief upon his pale face.  \"So that whatever can be done,\" continued my friend, \"to carry out your master's wishes, will be done now. Rely upon it. Go into your room and lie down until we call you.\"  \"Thank you, sir, and thank God you are here,\" said Beeton dazedly, and with one hand raised to his head he went, obediently, to the smaller bedroom and disappeared within.  \"Now, Petrie,\" rapped Smith, glancing around the littered floor, \"since I am empowered to deal with this matter as I see fit, and since you are a medical man, we can devote the next half-hour, at any rate, to a strictly confidential inquiry into this most perplexing case. I propose that you examine the body for any evidences that may assist you determining the cause of death, whilst I make a few inquiries here.\"  I nodded, without speaking, and went into the bedroom. It contained not one solitary item of the dead man's belongings, and in every way bore out Beeton's statement that Sir Gregory had never inhabited it. I bent over Hale, as he lay fully dressed upon the bed.  Saving the singularity of the symptom which had immediately preceded death--viz., the paralysis of the muscles of articulation--I should have felt disposed to ascribe his end to sheer inanition; and a cursory examination brought to light nothing contradictory to that view. Not being prepared to proceed further in the matter at the moment I was about to rejoin Smith, whom I could hear rummaging about amongst the litter of the outer room, when I made a curious discovery.  Lying in a fold of the disordered bed linen were a few petals of some kind of blossom, three of them still attached to a fragment of slender stalk.  I collected the tiny petals, mechanically, and held them in the palm of my hand studying them for some moments before the mystery of their presence there became fully appreciable to me. Then I began to wonder. The petals (which I was disposed to class as belonging to some species of _Curcas_ or Physic Nut), though bruised, were fresh, and therefore could not have been in the room for many hours. How had they been introduced, and by whom? Above all, what could their presence there at that time portend?  \"Smith,\" I called, and walked"]]]
