In 1624 an English fur trader named Henry Fleet came hither to trade with the Anacostian Indians, who then inhabited the present site of the city of Washington, and with the tribes of the Upper Potomac. In his journal (discovered a few years since in the Lambeth Library, London) Fleet gave a quaint description of the city's site as it then appeared. The following is from the explorer's journal:  \"Monday, the 25th June, we set sail for the town of Tohoga, where we came to an anchor 2 leagues short of the falls. * * * This place, without question, is the most pleasant and healthful place in all this country, and most convenient for habitation, the air temperate in summer and not violent in winter. It aboundeth with all manner of fish. The Indians in one night commonly will catch thirty sturgeons in a place where the river is not above 12 fathoms broad, and as for deer, buffaloes, bears, turkeys, the woods do swarm with them. * * * The 27th of June I manned my shallop and went up with the flood, the tide rising about 4 feet at this place. We had not rowed above 3 miles, but we might hear the falls to roar about 6 miles distant.\"[7]  [Note 7: Charles Burr Todd's \"Story of Washington,\" p. 18. New York, 1889.]  MARYLAND.--There is no evidence that the bison ever inhabited Maryland, except what has already been adduced with reference to the District of Columbia. If either of the references quoted may be taken as conclusive proof, and I see no reason for disputing either, then the fact that the bison once ranged northward from Virginia into Maryland is fairly established. There is reason to expect that fossil remains of _Bison americanus_ will yet be found both in Maryland and the District of Columbia, and I venture to predict that this will yet occur.  VIRGINIA.--Of the numerous references to the occurrence of the bison in Virginia, it is sufficient to allude to Col. William Byrd's meetings with buffaloes in 1620, while surveying the southern boundary of the State, about 155 miles from the coast, as already quoted; the references to the discovery of buffaloes on the eastern side of the Virginia mountains, quoted by Mr. Allen from Salmon's \"Present State of Virginia,\" page 14 (London, 1737), and the capture _and domestication_ of buffaloes in 1701 by the Huguenot settlers at Manikintown, which was situated on the James River, about 14 miles above Richmond. Apparently, buffaloes were more numerous in Virginia than in any other of the Atlantic States.  NORTH CAROLINA.--Colonel Byrd's discoveries along the interstate boundary between Virginia and North Carolina fixes the presence of the bison in the northern part of the latter State at the date of the survey. The following letter to Prof. G. Brown Goode, dated Birdsnest post-office, Va., August 6, 1888, from Mr. C. R. Moore, furnishes reliable evidence of the presence of the buffalo at another point in North Carolina: \"In the winter of 1857 I was staying for the night at the house of an old gentleman named Houston. I should judge he was seventy then. He lived near Buffalo Ford, on the Catawba River, about 4 miles from Statesville, N. C. I asked him how the ford got its name. He told me that his grandfather told him that when he was a boy the buffalo crossed there, and that when the rocks in the river were bare they would eat the moss that grew upon them.\" The point indicated is in longitude 81Â° west and the date not far from 1750.  SOUTH CAROLINA.--Professor Allen cites numerous authorities, whose observations furnish abundant evidence of the existence of the buffalo in South Carolina during the first half of the eighteenth century. From these it is quite evident that in the northwestern half of the State buffaloes were once fairly numerous. Keating declares, on the authority of Colhoun, \"and we know that some of those who first settled the Abbeville district in South Carolina, in 1756, found the buffalo there.\"[8] This appears to be the only definite locality in which the presence of the species was recorded.  [Note 8: Long's Expedition to the Source of the St. Peter's River, 1823, II, p. 26.]  GEORGIA.--The extreme southeastern limit of the buffalo in the United States was found on the coast of Georgia, near the mouth of the Altamaha River, opposite St. Simon's Island. Mr. Francis Moore, in his \"Voyage to Georgia,\" made in 1736 and reported upon in 1744,[9] makes the following observation:  [Note 9: Coll. Georgia Hist. Soc., I, p. 117.]  \"The island [St. Simon's] abounds with deer and rabbits. There are no buffalo in it, though there are large herds upon the main.\" Elsewhere in the same document (p. 122) reference is made to buffalo-hunting by Indians on the main-land near Darien.  In James E. Oglethorpe's enumeration (A. D. 1733) of the wild beasts of Georgia and South Carolina he mentions \"deer, elks, bears, wolves, and buffaloes.\"[10]  [Note 10: Ibid., I, p. 51.]  Up to the time of Moore's voyage to Georgia the interior was almost wholly unexplored, and it is almost certain that had not the \"large herds of buffalo on the main-land\" existed within a distance of 20 or 30 miles or less from the coast, the colonists would have had no knowledge of them; nor would the Indians have taken to the war-path against the whites at Darien \"under pretense of hunting buffalo.\"  ALABAMA.--Having established the existence of the bison in northwestern Georgia almost as far down as the center of the State, and in Mississippi down to the neighborhood of the coast, it was naturally expected that a search of historical records would reveal evidence that the bison once inhabited the northern half of Alabama. A most careful search through all the records bearing upon the early history and exploration of Alabama, to be found in the Library of Congress, failed to discover the slightest reference to the existence of the species in that State, or even to the use of buffalo skins by any of the Alabama Indians. While it is possible that such a hiatus really existed, in this instance its existence would be wholly unaccountable. I believe that the buffalo once inhabited the northern half of Alabama, even though history fails to record it.  LOUISIANA AND MISSISSIPPI.--At the beginning of the eighteenth century, buffaloes were plentiful in southern Mississippi and Louisiana, not only down to the coast itself, from Bay St. Louis to Biloxi, but even in the very Delta of the Mississippi, as the following record shows. In a \"Memoir addressed to Count de Pontchartrain,\" December 10, 1697, the author, M. de Remonville, describes the country around the mouth of the Mississippi, now the State of Louisiana, and further says:[11]  \"A great abundance of wild cattle are also found there, which might be domesticated by rearing up the young calves.\" Whether these animals were buffaloes might be considered an open question but for the following additional information, which affords positive evidence: \"The trade in furs and peltry would be immensely valuable and exceedingly profitable. We could also draw from thence a great quantity of buffalo hides every year, as the plains are filled with the animals.\"  In the same volume, page 47, in a document entitled \"Annals of Louisiana from 1698 to 1722, by M. Penicaut\" (1698), the author records the presence of the buffalo on the Gulf coast on the banks of the Bay St. Louis, as follows: \"The next day we left Pea Island, and passed through the Little Rigolets, which led into the sea about three leagues from the Bay of St. Louis. We encamped at the entrance of the bay, near a fountain of water that flows from the hills, and which was called at this time Belle Fountain. We hunted during several days upon the coast of this bay, and filled our boats with the meat of the deer, buffaloes, and other wild game which we had killed, and carried it to the fort (Biloxi).\"  [Note 11: Hist. Coll. of Louisiana and Florida, B. F. French, 1869, first series, p. 2.]  The occurrence of the buffalo at Natchez is recorded,[12] and also (p. 115) at the mouth of Red River, as follows: \"We ascended the Mississippi to Pass Manchac, where we killed fifteen buffaloes. The next day we landed again, and killed eight more buffaloes and as many deer.\"  [Note 12: Ibid., pp. 88-91.]  The presence of the buffalo in the Delta of the Mississippi was observed and recorded by D'Iberville in 1699.[13]  [Note 13: Hist. Coll. of Louisiana and Florida, French, second series, p. 58.]  According to Claiborne,[14] the Choctaws have an interesting tradition in regard to the disappearance of the buffalo from Mississippi. It relates that during the early part of the eighteenth century a great drought occurred, which was particularly severe in the prairie region. For three years not a drop of rain fell. The Nowubee and Tombigbee Rivers dried up and the forests perished. The elk and buffalo, which up to that time had been numerous, all migrated to the country beyond the Mississippi, and never returned.  [Note 14: Mississippi as a Province, Territory, and State, p. 484.]  TEXAS.--It will be remembered that it was in southeastern Texas, in all probability within 50 miles of the present city of Houston, that the earliest discovery of the American bison on its native heath was made in 1530 by Cabeza de Vaca, a half-starved, half-naked, and wholly wretched Spaniard, almost the only surviving member of the celebrated expedition which burned its ships behind it. In speaking of the buffalo in Texas at the earliest periods of which we have any historical record, Professor Allen says: \"They were also found in immense herds on the coast of Texas, at the Bay of St. Bernard (Matagorda Bay), and on the lower part of the Colorado (Rio Grande, according to some authorities), by La Salle, in 1685, and thence northwards across the Colorado, Brazos, and Trinity Rivers.\" Joutel says that when in"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17763"],["title","The Mystery of the Hasty Arrow (#1)"],["body","ls--even hers for whose benefit this remark had possibly been made:  \"But there are no arrows over there. All the arrows are here.\"  She was right. They were here, quiver after quiver of them; nor were they all beyond reach. As the woman thus significantly assailed noted this and saw with what suspicion others noted it also, a decided change took place in her aspect.  \"I should like to sit down,\" she murmured. Possibly she was afraid she might fall.  As some one brought a chair, she spoke, but very tremulously, to the director:  \"Are there no arrows in the rooms over there?\"  \"I am quite sure not.\"  \"And no bows?\"  \"None.\"  \"If--if anyone had been seen in the gallery----\"  \"No one was.\"  \"You are sure of that?\"  \"You heard the question asked. It brought no answer.\"  \"But--but these galleries are visible from below. Some one may have been looking up from the court and----\"  \"If there was any such person in the building, he would have been here by this time. People don't hold back such information.\"  \"Then--then--\" she stammered, her eyes taking on a hunted look, \"you conclude--these people conclude _what_?\"  \"Madam,\"--the word came coldly, stinging her into drawing herself to her full height,--\"it is not for me to conclude in a case like this. That is the business of the police.\"  At this word, with its suggestion of crime, her air of conscious power vanished in sudden collapse. Possibly she had seen the significant gesture with which the Curator pointed out a quiver from which one of the arrows was missing. That this was so, was shown by her next question:  \"But where is the bow? Look about on the floor. You will find none. How can an arrow be shot without a bow?\"  \"It cannot be,\" came from some one at her back. \"But it can be driven home like a dagger if the hand wielding it is sufficiently powerful.\"  A cry left her lips; she seemed to listen as for some echo; then in a wild abandonment which ignored person and place she flung herself again at the dead girl's side, and before the astonished people surrounding her could intervene, she had caught up the body in her arms, and bending over it, whispered word after word into the poor child's closed ear.     II  IN ROOM B   Five minutes later the Curator was at the 'phone calling up Police Headquarters. A death had occurred at the museum. Would they send over a capable detective?  \"What kind of death?\" was the harsh reply. \"We don't send detectives in cases of heart-failure or simple accident. Is it an accident?\"  \"No--no--hardly. It looks more like an insane woman's attack upon a harmless stranger. It's the oddest sort of an affair, and we feel very helpless. No common officer will do. We have one of that kind in the building. What we want is a man of brains; he will need them.\"  A muffled sound at the other end--then a different voice asking some half-dozen comprehensive questions--which, having been answered to the best of the Curator's ability, were followed by the welcome assurance that a man on whose experience he could rely would be at the museum doors within five minutes.  With an air of relief Mr. Jewett stepped again into the court, and repelling with hasty gestures the importunities of the small group of men and women who had lacked the courage to follow the more adventurous ones upstairs, crossed to where the door-man stood on guard over the main entrance.  \"Locked?\" he asked.  \"Yes, sir. Such were the orders. Didn't you give them?\"  \"No, but I should have done so, had I known. No one's to go out, and no one's to come in but the detective whom I am expecting any moment.\"  They had not long to wait. Before their suspense had reached fever-point, a tap was heard on the great door. It was opened, and a young man stepped in.  \"Coast clear?\" he sang out with a humorous twist of his jaw as he noted the Curator's evident chagrin at his meager and unsatisfactory appearance. \"Oh, I'm not your man,\" he added as his eye ran over the whole place with a look which seemed to take in every detail in an instant. \"Mr. Gryce is in the automobile. Wait till I help him up.\"  He was gone before the Curator could utter a word, only to reappear in a few minutes with a man in his wake whom the former at first blush thought to be as much past the age where experience makes for efficiency as the other seemed to be short of it.  But this impression, if impression it were, was of short duration. No sooner had this physically weak but extremely wise old man entered upon the scene than his mental power became evident to every person there. Timorous hearts regained their composure, and the Curator--who in his ten years of service had never felt the burden of his position so acutely as in the last ten minutes--showed his relief by a volubility quite unnatural to him under ordinary conditions. As he conducted the detectives across the court, he talked not of the victim, as might reasonably be expected, but of the woman who had been found leaning over her with her hand on the arrow.  \"We think her some escaped lunatic,\" he remarked. \"Only a demented woman would act as she does. First she denied all knowledge of the girl. Then when she was made to see that the arrow sticking in the girl's breast had been taken from a quiver hanging within arm's reach on the wall and used as lances are used, she fell a-moaning and crying, and began to whisper in the poor child's senseless ear.\"  \"A common woman? One of a low-down type?\"  \"Not at all. A lady, and an impressive one, at that. You seldom see her equal. That's what has upset us so. The crime and the criminal do not seem to fit.\"  The detective blinked. Then suddenly he seemed to grow an inch taller.  \"Where is she now?\" he asked.  \"In Room B, away from the crowd. She is not alone. A young lady detained with the rest of the people here is keeping her company, to say nothing of an officer we have put on guard.\"  \"And the victim?\"  \"Lies where she fell, in Section II on the upper floor. There was no call to move her. She was dead when we came upon the scene. She does not look to be more than sixteen years old.\"  \"Let's go up. But wait--can we see that section from here?\"  They were standing at the foot of the great staircase connecting the two floors. Above them, stretching away on either side, ran the two famous, highly ornamented galleries, with their row of long, low arches indicating the five compartments into which they were severally divided. Pointing to the second one on the southern side, the Curator replied:  \"That's it--the one where you see the Apache relics hanging high on the rear wall. We shall have to shift those to some other place just as soon as we can recover from this horror. I don't want the finest spot in the whole museum made a Mecca for the morbid and the curious.\"  The remark fell upon unheeding ears. Detective Gryce was looking, not in the direction named, but in the one directly opposite to it.  \"I see,\" he quietly observed, \"that there is a clear view across. Was there no one in the right-hand gallery to see what went on in the left?\"  \"Not that I have heard of. It's the dullest hour of the day, and not only this gallery but many of the rooms were entirely empty.\"  \"I see. And now, what about the persons who were here? How many of them have you let go?\"  \"Not one; the doors have been opened twice only--once to admit the officer you will find on guard, and the other to let in yourself.\"  \"Good! And how many have you here, all told?\"  \"I have not had time to count them, but I should say less than thirty. This includes myself, as well as two attendants.\"  With a thoughtful air Mr. Gryce turned in the direction of the few persons he could see huddled together around one of the central statues.  \"Where are the others?\" he asked.  \"Upstairs--in and about the place where the poor child lies.\"  \"They must be got out of there. Sweetwater!\"  The young man who had entered with him was at his side in an instant.  \"Clear the galleries. Then take down the name and address of every person in the building.\"  \"Yes, sir.\"  Before the last word had left his lips, the busy fellow was halfway up the marble steps. \"Lightning,\" some of his pals called him, perhaps because he was as noiseless as he was quick. Meanwhile the senior detective had drawn the Curator to one side.  \"We'll take a look at these people as they come down. I have been said to be able to spot a witness with my eyes shut. Let's see what I can do with my eyes open.\"  \"Young and old, rich and poor,\" murmured the Curator as some dozen persons appeared at the top of the staircase.  \"Yes,\" sighed the detective, noting each one carefully as he or she filed down, \"we sha'n't make much out of this experiment. Not one of them avoids our looks. Emotion enough, but not of the right sort. Well, we'll leave them to Sweetwater. Our business is above.\"  The Curator offered his arm. The old man made a move to take it--then drew himself up with an air of quiet confidence.  \"Many thanks,\" said he, \"but I can go alone. Rheumatism is my trouble, but these mild days loosen its grip upon my poor old muscles.\" He did not say that the prospect of an interesting inquiry had much the same effect, but the Curator suspected it, possibly because he was feeling just a little bit spry himself.  Steeled as such experienced officers necessarily are to death in all its phases, it was with no common emotion that the aged detective entered the presence of the dead girl and took his first look at this latest victim of mental or moral aberration. So young! so innocent! so fair! A schoolgirl, or little more, of a class certainly above the average, whether judged from the contour of her features or the niceties of her dress. With no evidences of great wealth about her, there was yet something in the cut of her garments and the careful attention to each detail which bespoke not only natural but cultivated taste. On her breast just above the spot where the cruel dart had entered, a fresh and blooming nosegay"]]]
