I know by the feel of the air.\"  \"Let it come!\" said the Little Red House. \"I don't care. I couldn't be more miserable than I am.\"  Just as he said that, one great rain-drop fell right on the middle of his roof--Plop!  \"It's coming already,\" cried the Blue-gum, \"and it's going to pour.\"  Then three more big drops fell--Plop! Plop! Plop!  \"I have never in my life seen such big rain-drops,\" said the Blue-gum. \"I've lived on this mountain, tree and sapling, for--\"  But--Crash! came rain before he could finish; and in two seconds everything was sopping wet. The noise of it was deafening,  \"Why, it's a cloud-burst!\" shouted the Blue-gum. \"Half of my leaves have been stripped off already.\" Then he peered through the rain and the dark to see how the Little Red House was taking it. \"Why, what's the matter with your face?\" he cried. \"You look awful.\"  \"I'm crying!\" sobbed the Little Red House. \"That's all--just crying. \"Can't you see the tears?\"  \"Nonsense!\" said the Blue-gum. \"Those are not tears. It's just the rain-water running off your window-sills.\"  \"I tell you I'm crying!\" wailed the Little Red House. \"I'm crying bitterly. I should know, shouldn't I? I'm shivering and crying because I'm cold and lonely and miserable.\"  \"Oh, very well,\" agreed the Blue-gum. \"You are crying. But if this rain doesn't stop soon, you'll cry the front path away. It certainly is wet.\"  Very late that night the rain eased a little and then stopped altogether. The tears ceased to run from the eyes of the Little Red House, and they now came only in drops, slower and slower, falling into the great pool by the front door.  \"It's a hard world!\" sobbed the Little Red House, squeezing out another tear.  \"Listen!\" cried the Big Blue-gum. \"Do you hear THAT?\"  From far away on the distant ranges came a dull, moaning sound. As they listened it grew louder, and right in the middle of of it came another sound--Thump!  \"That's wind,\" said the Blue-gum; \"and a big wind, too.\"  \"Let it come!\" sighed the Little Red House. \"I couldn't be more miserable than I am.\"  As he spoke, the moaning grew louder, and there were three or four quite big thumps one after another.  \"What's that thumping?\" asked the little House.  \"Those are my poor brothers,\" answered the big Blue-gum very sadly, \"Those are trees going down before the big wind. The birds were bringing me messages from those poor fellows quite lately; and now I shall never hear from them again. It's very sad.\"  \"I never thought the wind could blow down big trees,\" said the Little House.  \"No tree knows when his time will come,\" the big Blue-gum answered gravely. \"I've had some very narrow escapes in my time, as tree and sapling on this mountain.\"  The Little Red House was very quiet and thoughtful for a long time after that. Then he asked suddenly, \"Which way do you think you would fall if you did fall?\"  But the big Blue-gum said that he couldn't tell. It depended on the wind, and he might fall any way.  \"Not on me!\" cried the Little House.  The Blue-gum said that he didn't know; but he hoped not.  \"If you DID fall on me,\" said the Little Red House, \"I suppose it would hurt me.\"  The Blue-gum said it certainly would, and there would be very little left but splinters and glass.  \"Then don't! Please don't,\" yelled the Little Red House.  But before they could say another word the great wind struck them with a roar. It tossed the roses about so that the eyebrows of the Little House seemed to be twitching horribly; and it swayed the big Blue-gum this way and that till he appeared to be fighting for his very life. It picked up the fallen leaves and twigs, and even small stones, and hurled them down the mountain in a cloud.  In the midst of all the uproar the Little House heard the Blue-gum calling to him.  \"As long as I've lived upon this mountain, tree and sapling,\" he shouted, \"I've never known such a wind. I'm not so young as I used to be, and I fear that my end has come.\"  \"Be brave! Oh, be brave!\" implored the Little Red House. \"Don't let him blow you down. I should be so sorry to lose you, What are you grunting for?\"  \"I'm not grunting,\" answered the Blue-gym in a pained voice. \"Those are my roots giving way, one by one. I can't stand much more of this. Look out!\"  The Little Red House looked up, and what he saw terrified him. The big Blue-gum, in the clutch of the wind, was bent right over him, so that the top branches seemed to be just above his roof; and the great tree appeared to be falling, falling, helplessly.  \"Don't fall on me!\" shrieked the Little Red House. \"Oh, don't fall on me; because, if you do, you know you'll squash me! I don't want to be squashed!\"  But the big Blue-gum said, \"There is just one little root holding now. If that gives way we are both done for.\"  \"Be brave! Oh, be brave!\" shrieked the Little Red House.  Then slowly, very slowly, the big Blue-gum began to straighten up again, away from the Little Red House.  \"I have stood upon this mountain, tree and sapling, for over a hundred years,\" he said when he had recovered; \"but if it blows like that again, it is the end of me.\"  But it did not blow like that again; though the wind howled and shrieked all that day as if it was very angry and disappointed that it could not blow down the big Blue-gum.  Then, towards evening, the wind fell; the heavy clouds went away beyond the edge of the sky, and all became very calm and peaceful.  The birds came from their hiding places and sat in the branches of the Blue-gum and chattered away to him, until he began to feel quite cheerful once more, in spite of his trouble. And when a certain little Tree-creeper--a very wise bird--came and had a long, serious talk with the Blue-gum, he became very much interested indeed and quite happy.  But the Little Red House was miserable still; and the beauty of the evening didn't cheer him up one bit.  \"Ah, well,\" said the Blue-gum, when the darkness came to the mountain, \"I am going to have a good sleep tonight. I'm a match still for old Daddy Wind, in spite of all his noise and bluster. And there are ways of dealing with white-ants, too. I've lived upon this mountain, tree and sapling, for--\"  But as he was talking he fell fast asleep.  The Little Red House did not sleep. How could he, with his eyes wide open? So he just stood there all night staring before him, lonely and wretched. And when an owl came and sat in the tree and began to call, \"Mopoke,\" the Little Red House told him rudely to stop his silly noise and clear out. That will just show you how very miserable he was.  It was quite late next morning when the Blue-gum awoke. He stretched his big limbs, and began to wonder what he might say to comfort the Little Red House. But when the Blue-gum looked down, he saw that the Little Red House was smiling all over his face.  \"Well, now!\" cried the big Blue-gum cheerfully. \"That's the kind of face I like to see in the morning! So you've decided to be sensible and forget your loneliness?\"  But the Little Red House didn't say a word. He just went on smiling.  Then the big Blue-gum began to get uneasy.  \"I do hope your troubles haven't turned you silly,\" he said. \"You haven't lost your senses, have you?\"  \"I?\" cried the Little Red House. \"Why, look down the valley! See who's coming!\"  Down, far down, the valley, just coming through the white gate, were two figures that looked like tiny specks. And much nearer was another speck, which was certainly a little dog.  \"It's them--I mean those are they!\" shouted the Little Red House happily. \"Sym and Emily Ann! And here comes our little dog.\"  \"Well, you certainly have sharp eyes,\" replied the Blue-gum. \"But I suppose I'm getting old--over a hundred years, you know.\"  The two figures were through the white gate now, and had crossed the red road out on to the stony flat--getting bigger and bigger as they came; and the smile on the Little Red House seemed to grow broader and broader. On they came, under the tree-ferns, up by the big rocks, past the sign-post. And now the Little Red House could hear Sym singing his Tinker's song.  But it was not quite the same song this time:  \"Kettles and pans! Ho, kettles and pans! Where's there a home like the tinkering man's? Weary of wandering, home is the place-- The Little Red House with the smile on his face-- Weary and hungry, my Emily Ann. Then put on the kettle! Ho, put on the pan!\"  \"Now THAT is the sort of song I DO like,\" said the Little Red House, as he watched them coming up the mountain.  On they came, growing bigger and bigger--through the sliprails, across the potato paddock, over the bridge, round by the bracken-patch, past the black stump, through the gate, and here they were, right at the front door.  \"Oh, I AM glad to be home again,\" cried Emily Ann. \"And do look at the Little House. He seems to be smiling.\"  \"Of course he is smiling,\" answered Sym; \"but he has a very dirty face.\"  \"The storm did that,\" said Emily Ann. \"Now hurry and get the fire alight, and I'll put the kettle on.\" And they went inside laughing and singing, while the little dog flew round the house, barking for dear life, and pretending he was very busy seeing everything was in order.  \"Now I suppose you're happy,\" said the big Blue-gum to the Little Red House.  \"Happy?\" cried the Little House. \"Of course I am. Why, I'm a home again!\" But suddenly he remembered that his own happiness had made him forget all about his old friend's troubles; and he tried his best to look serious, as he said: \"But what about YOU? Are the white-ants still troubling you?\"  \"Ah!\" replied the Blue-gum. \"Don't let that worry you. Yesterday I had a talk with the doctor--Doctor Tree-creeper, you know--a very clever little bird he is, and he knows all about white-ants. He examined me thoroughly all over. He says that they have hardly got under my skin yet, and he will have them all out in a couple of days.

CONCLUSION      p. 124     THE FERTILITY OF THE UNFIT.         *       *       *       *       *  INTRODUCTION.   Biology is the Science of Life. It seeks to explain the phenomena of all life, whether animal or vegetable. Its methods are observation and experiment. It observes the tiny cell on the surface of an egg yolk, and watches it divide and multiply until it becomes a great mass of cells, which group off or differentiate, and rearrange and alter their shapes. It observes how little organs unfold themselves, or evolve out of these little cell groups--how gradual, but how unvarying the change; how one group becomes a bone, another a brain, another a muscle, to constitute in three short weeks the body of a matured chick. Those little tendons like silken threads, that run down those slender pink legs to each and every toe, and move its little joints so swiftly that we hardly see them--that little brain, no bigger than a tiny seed, in which is planted a mysterious force that impels it to set all those brand-new muscles in motion, and to dart after a fly with the swiftness of an arrow--all this wondrous mechanism, all this beauteous structure, all this perfection of function, all this adaptation to environment, have evolved from a few microscopic cells in three short weeks.  Biology is the science that observes all this, and enunciates the law that the life history of this animal cell, _i.e._, its history from a simple unicellular state in the egg, to its complex multicellular state in the matured chick, represents the history of the race to which the chick belongs. If we could trace that chicken back through all its ancestry, we would discover at different periods in the history of life upon the globe (about 100 million years, according to Haeckel) exactly the stages of development we found in the life history of the chick, and arrive at last at a primordial cell.  What is true of the chick is true of all life. This is the law of evolution. It is true of all plant and animal life; it is true of man as an individual; it is true of his mind as well as of his body; it is true of society as an aggregation of individuals. As men have evolved from a lower to a higher, a simple to a complex state, so they are still evolving and rising \"on stepping stones of their dead selves to higher things.\"  Natural selection, or the survival of the fittest, is one of the processes by which evolution takes place. According to this law, only the fittest survive in the struggle for life. Darwin was led to this discovery on reading Malthus's thesis regarding the disproportion between the rates of increase in population and food, and the consequent struggle for existence.  All living organisms require food and space. The power of multiplication in plants and animals is so great that food or space is sooner or later entrenched upon, and then commences this inevitable struggle for existence. In this struggle for life, the individuals best able to conform to their environment, _i.e._, the best able to resist adverse circumstances, to sustain hardships, to overcome difficulties, to defend themselves, to outstrip their fellows, in short, to harmonise function with environment, survive. These propagate their kind according to the law of heredity. Variations exist in the progeny, and the individuals whose variations best adapt them to their environment are the fittest to, and do, survive.  In a state of nature the weaklings perish. If man interferes with this state of nature in the lower animals, he may make a selection and cultivate some particular attribute. This is artificial selection, and is best exemplified in the experiments with pigeons. Pasteur saved the silk industry of France, and perhaps of the whole world, by the application of this law of artificial selection. The disease of silkworms, known as Pebrine, was spreading with ruinous rapidity in France. Pasteur demonstrated that the germ of the disease could be detected in the blood of affected moths by the aid of the microscope. He proved that the eggs of diseased moths produced unhealthy worms, and he advised that the eggs of each moth be kept apart, until the moth was examined for germs. If these were found, the eggs were to be burned. Thus the eggs of unhealthy moths were never hatched, and artificial selection of healthy stock stamped out a disease, and saved a great industry.  Each individual plant in the struggle for life has only itself to maintain. In the higher forms of animal life, each animal has its offspring as well as itself to maintain. In a state of nature, that is in a state unaffected by man's rational interference, defective offspring and weaker brethren were the victims of the inexorable law of natural selection. When Christ gave _his_ reply to the question, \"Am I my brother's keeper?\" the defective and the weakling became the special care of their stronger brother. They constituted thenceforth The Fit Man's Burden. The work a man has to do during life, in order to support himself, is the unit of measurement of the burden he has to bear. Many factors in modern times have helped to reduce that work to a minimum. The invention of machinery has multiplied his eyes, his hands, his feet; and one man can now produce, for his own maintenance and comfort, what it took perhaps a score of men to produce even a century ago. Man's disabilities from incidental and epidemic disease have been immeasurably reduced by modern sanitation, and the teaching and practice of preventive medicine. Agricultural chemistry has made the soil more productive, and manufacturing arts have aided distribution as well as production.  All the departments of human knowledge have been placed under contribution to man's necessity, and longer life, better health, and more food and clothing for less work, are the blessings on his head to-day.  While the burden has been lessened by the industrial and scientific progress of the last half century, it has been augmented by the fertility of the unfit; and the maintenance in idleness and "]]]
