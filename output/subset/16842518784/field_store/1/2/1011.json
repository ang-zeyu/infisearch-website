As early as thought began to form itself clearly in him, he singled out Mistress Halsell as a person to reflect upon. When he was too young to know wherefore, he comprehended vaguely that she was of a world to which the rest of his attendants did not belong. 'Twas not that she was of greatly superior education and manners, since all those who waited upon him had been carefully chosen; 'twas that she seemed to love him more gravely than did the others, and to mean a deeper thing when she called him \"my lord Marquess.\" She was a pock-marked woman (she having taken the disease from her late husband the Chaplain, who had died of that scourge), and in her earliest bloom could have been but plainly favoured. She had a large-boned frame, and but for a good and serious carriage would have seemed awkward. She had, however, the good fortune to be the possessor of a mellow voice, and to have clear grey eyes, set well and deep in her head, and full of earnest meaning.  \"Her I shall always remember,\" the young Marquess often said when he had grown to be a man and was Duke, and had wife and children of his own. \"I loved to sit upon her knee, and lean against her breast, and gaze up into her eyes. 'Twas my child-fancy that there was deep within them something like a star, and when I gazed at it, I felt a kind of loving awe such as grew within me when I lay and looked up at a star in the sky.\"  His mother's eyes were of so dark a violet that 'twas his fancy of them that they looked like the velvet of a purple pansy. Her complexion was of roses and lilies, and had in truth by nature that sweet bloom which Sir Peter Lely was kind enough to bestow upon every beauty of King Charles's court his brush made to live on canvas. She was indeed a lovely creature and a happy one, her life with her husband and child so contenting her that, young though she was, she cared as little for Court life as my lord Duke, who, having lived longer in its midst than she, had no taste for its intrigues and the vices which so flourished in its hot-bed. Though the noblest Duke in England, and of a family whose whole history was enriched with services to the royal house, his habits and likings were not such as made noblemen favourites at the court of Charles the Second. He was not given to loose adventure, and had not won the heart of my Lady Castlemaine, since he had made no love to her, which was not a thing to be lightly forgiven to any handsome and stalwart gentleman. Besides this, he had been so moved by the piteous case of the poor Queen, during her one hopeless battle for her rights when this termagant beauty was first thrust upon her as lady of her bedchamber, that on those cruel days during the struggle when the poor Catherine had found herself sitting alone, deserted, while her husband and her courtiers gathered in laughing, worshipping groups about her triumphant rival, this one gentleman had sought by his courteous respect to support her in her humiliated desolation, though the King himself had first looked black and then had privately mocked at him.  \"He hath fallen in love with her,\" the Castlemaine had said afterwards to a derisive group; \"he hath fallen deep in love--with her long teeth and her Portuguese farthingale.\"  \"She needs love, poor soul, Heaven knows,\" the Duke returned, when this speech was repeated to him. \"A poor girl taken from her own country, married to a King, and then insulted by his Court and his mistresses! Some man should remember her youth and desolateness, and not forget that another man has broke her heart and lets his women laugh at her misfortunes.\"  'Twould have been a dangerous speech perhaps had a man of the Court of Henry the Eighth made it, even to a friend, but Charles was too lightly vicious and too fond of gay scenes to be savage. His brutality was such as was carelessly wreaked on hearts instead of heads--hearts he polluted, made toys of, flung in the mire or broke; heads he left on the shoulders they belonged to. But he did not love his Grace of Osmonde, and though his rank and character were such that he could not well treat him with indignity, he did not regret that after his Grace's marriage with the Lady Rosalys Delile he appeared but seldom at Court.  \"He is a tiresome fellow, for one can find no fault with him,\" his Majesty said, fretfully. \"Odd's fish! fortune is on his side where my house is concerned. His father fought at Edgehill and Marston Moor, and they tell me died but two years after Naseby of a wound he had there. Let him go and bury himself on his great estates, play the benefactor to his tenantry, listen to his Chaplain's homilies, and pay stately visits to the manors of his neighbours.\"  His Grace lived much in the country, not being fond of town, but he did not bury himself and his fair spouse. Few men lived more active lives and found such joy in existence. He entertained at his country seats most brilliantly, since, though he went but seldom to London, he was able to offer London such pleasures and allurements that it was glad to come to him. There were those who were delighted to leave the Court itself to visit Roxholm or Camylott or some other of his domains. Men who loved hunting and out-of-door life found entertainment on the estates of a man who was the most splendid sportsman of his day, whose moors and forests provided the finest game and his stables the finest horses in England. Women who were beauties found that in his stately rooms they might gather courts about them. Men of letters knew that in his libraries they might delve deep into the richest mines. Those who loved art found treasures in his galleries, and wide comprehension and finished tastes in their master.  And over the assemblies, banquets, and brilliant hunt balls there presided the woman with the loveliest eyes, 'twas said, in England, Scotland, Ireland, or Wales--the violet eyes King Charles had been stirred by and which had caused him a bitter scene with my Lady Castlemaine, whose eyes were neither violet nor depths of tender purity. The sweetest eyes in the world, all vowed them to be; and there was no man or woman, gentle or simple, who was not rejoiced by their smiling.  \"In my book of pictures,\" said the little Marquess to his mother once, \"there is an angel. She looks as you do when you come in your white robe to kiss me before you go down to dine with the ladies and gentlemen who are our guests. Your little shining crown is made of glittering stones, and hers is only gold. Angels wear only golden crowns--but you are like her, mother, only more beautiful.\"  The child from his first years was used to the passing and repassing across his horizon of brilliant figures and interesting ones. From the big mullioned window of his nursery he could see the visitors come and go, he watched the beaux and beauties saunter in the park and pleasaunce in their brocades, laces, and plumed hats, he saw the scarlet coats ride forth to hunt, and at times fine chariots roll up the avenue with great people in them come to make visits of state. His little life was full of fair pictures and fair stories of them. When the house was filled with brilliant company he liked nothing so much as to sit on Mistress Halsell's knee or in his chair by her side and ask her questions about the guests he caught glimpses of as they passed to and fro. He was a child of strong imagination and with a great liking for the romantic and poetic. He would have told to him again and again any rumour of adventure connected with those he had beheld. He was greatly pleased by the foreign ladies and gentlemen who were among the guests--he liked to hear of the Court of King Louis the Fourteenth, and to have pointed out to him those visitors who were personages connected with it. He was attracted by the sound of foreign tongues, and would inquire to which country a gentleman or lady belonged, and would thrust his head out of the window when they sauntered on the terraces below that he might hear them speak their language. As was natural, he heard much interesting gossip from his attendants when they were not aware that he was observing, they feeling secure in his extreme youth. He could not himself exactly have explained how his conception of the difference between the French and English Courts arose, but at seven years old, he in some way knew that King Louis was a finer gentleman than King Charles, that his Court was more elegant, and that the beauties who ruled it were not merry orange wenches, or romping card house-building maids of honour, or splendid viragoes who raved and stamped and poured forth oaths as fishwives do. How did he know it--and many other things also? He knew it as children always know things their elders do not suspect them of remarking, but which, falling upon their little ears sink deep into their tiny minds, and lying there like seeds in rich earth, put forth shoots and press upwards until they pierce through the darkness and flower and bear fruit in the light of day. He knew that a certain great Duchess of Portsmouth had been sent over from France by King Louis to gain something from King Charles, who had fallen in love with her. The meaning of \"falling in love\" he was yet vague in his understanding of, but he knew that the people hated her because they thought she played tricks and would make trouble for England if she led the King as she tried to do. The common people called her \"Madame Carwell,\" that being their pronunciation of the French name she had borne before she had been made a Duchess. He had once heard his nurses Alison and Grace gossiping together of a great service of gold the King had given her, and which, when it had been on exhibition, had made the people so angry that they had said they would like to see it melted and poured down her throat. \"If he must give it,\" they had grumbled, \"he had better have bestowed it upon Madame Ellen.\"  Hearing this, my"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15659"],["title","The Beacon Second Reader (#1)"],["body","the door. Our mother's feet, are white and yours are black. Go away; you are the wolf.\"  [Illustration]  Then the wolf went to the miller's, and said to him, \"Mr. Miller, put some flour on my foot, for I have hurt it.\"  The miller was so afraid of the wolf that he did as he was told.  Then the wicked wolf went to the goat's house again and said, \"Open the door, dear children, for I am your mother.\"  \"Show us your foot,\" said the little kids.  So the wolf put his one white foot on the window sill.  When the little kids saw that it was white, they thought this was really their mother, and they opened the door.  In jumped the ugly old wolf, and all the little kids ran to hide themselves.  The first hid under the table, the second in the bed, the third in the oven, the fourth in the kitchen, the fifth in the cupboard, the sixth under the washtub, and the seventh, who was the smallest of all, in the tall clock.  The wolf quickly found and gobbled up all but the youngest, who was in the clock.  Then the wolf, who felt sleepy, went out and lay down on the green grass.  Soon he was fast asleep.   THE WOLF AND THE SEVEN YOUNG KIDS--II  Not long after this the old goat came home from the woods.  Ah, what did she see! The house door was wide open; the tables and chairs were upset.  The washtub was broken in pieces, and the bed was tipped over.  \"Where are my dear children?\" cried the poor goat.  At last she heard a little voice crying, \"Dear mother, here I am in the tall clock.\"  The old goat helped the little goat out.  Soon she learned how the wolf had eaten her dear children.  Then she went out of the hut, and there on the grass lay the wolf sound asleep.  As the goat looked at the wicked old wolf, she thought she saw something jumping about inside him.  \"Ah,\" she said, \"it may be that my poor children are still alive.\"  So she sent the little kid into the house for a pair of scissors and a needle and some thread.  She quickly cut a hole in the side of the wicked old wolf.  At the first snip of the scissors, one of the kids stuck out his head.  As the old goat cut, more and more heads popped out.  At last all six of the kids jumped out upon the grass.  They went hopping and skipping about their mother.  Then the old goat said to them, \"Go and bring me some large stones from the brook.\"  The seven little kids ran off to the brook and soon came back with seven large stones.  They put these stones inside the wicked old wolf.  [Illustration]  The old goat sewed up the wolf's side so gently and quietly that he did not wake up nor move.  When at last the wicked wolf did wake up, the great stones inside him made him feel very heavy.  He was thirsty, too, so he walked down to the brook to drink.  The stones were so heavy that they tipped him over the edge of the bank into the deep water, and he was drowned.  WILLIAM AND JACOB GRIMM         THEY DIDN'T THINK      danger  folks  seized       Once a trap was baited       With a piece of cheese;     It tickled so a little mouse,       It almost made him sneeze.     An old rat said, \"There's danger,       Be careful where you go!\"     \"Nonsense!\" said the other,       \"I don't think you know!\"     So he walked in boldly--       Nobody in sight--     First he took a nibble,       Then he took a bite;     Close the trap together       Snapped as quick as wink,     Catching mousey fast there,       'Cause he didn't think.      Once there was a robin,       Lived outside the door,     Who wanted to go inside       And hop upon the floor.     \"No, no,\" said the mother,       \"You must stay with me;     Little birds are safest       Sitting in a tree.\"     \"I don't care,\" said Robin,       And gave his tail a fling,     \"I don't think the old folks       Know quite everything.\"     Down he flew, and kitty seized him       Before he'd time to blink;     \"Oh,\" he cried, \"I'm sorry,       But I didn't think.\"      PHOEBE CARY  [Illustration]     [Illustration]  TOM THUMB--I  thumb  people  suit  reins  fought frightened  brought  thistledown   In the days of King Arthur, there lived a wise man named Merlin.  He knew all the fairies and where they lived.  Even the fairy queen was a friend of his.  Once, while he was traveling, night overtook him in a deep forest.  He rapped at the door of a small cottage and asked for some food.  Merlin looked so hungry and poor that the farmer and his wife took pity on him.  They not only gave him a bowl of milk with some brown bread, but they said he might stay through the night.  Merlin saw that, in spite of their pleasant cottage, both the farmer and his wife were very sad.  \"Why are you sad?\" asked Merlin.  \"You seem to have a good farm, a pleasant cottage, and many things to make you happy.\"  \"Ah!\" said the woman, \"we are unhappy because we have no child.  I should be the happiest woman in the world if I had a son.  Why, even if he were no bigger than my husband's thumb, we should love him dearly.\"  \"That would be indeed a very strange kind of child,\" said Merlin, \"but I hope you may have your wish.\"  Now Merlin was on his way to call on the queen of the fairies.  When he came to her castle the next day, he told the fairy queen the wish of the farmer's wife.  The queen of the fairies said, \"The good woman shall have her wish. I will give her a son no larger than her husband's thumb.\"   TOM THUMB--II  Soon after this the good farmer's wife had a son. He was, indeed, just the size of his father's thumb.  People came from far and wide to see the tiny boy.  One day the fairy queen and some other fairies came to see him.  The queen kissed the little boy and named him Tom Thumb.  [Illustration]  Each of the other fairies made Tom a gift.  He had a shirt made of silk from a spider's web, a coat of thistledown, a hat made from the leaf of an oak, tiny shoes made from a mouse's skin, and many other gifts besides.  Tom never grew any larger than a man's thumb, but he could do many clever tricks.  One day his mother was mixing a pudding.  Tom leaned over the edge of the bowl to see how it was made.  He slipped, and in he went, head first.  His mother did not see him fall, and kept stirring and stirring the pudding.  Tom could not see nor hear, but he kicked and kicked inside the pudding.  The pudding moved and tossed about.  His mother was afraid.  She did not know what to think.  \"There must be witches in it,\" she said.  She went to the window to throw the pudding out.  Just then a poor beggar was passing by the house.  \"Here is a pudding you may have, if you like,\" said Tom's mother.  The beggar thanked her and put it into his basket.  He had not gone very far, when Tom got his head out of the pudding and shouted in a shrill voice:  \"Take me out! take me out!\"  The poor beggar was so frightened that he dropped his basket, pudding and all, and ran off as fast as he could.  Tom crawled out of the pudding, climbed out of the basket, and ran home.  His mother washed him and put him to bed.   TOM THUMB--III  Not long after this Tom's mother took him with her when she went to milk the cow.  That he might not get lost, she tied him to a wisp of hay.  When Tom's mother was not looking, the cow took the wisp of hay into her mouth.  She began to chew and chew.  Tom began to jump about and shout.  He frightened the cow so that she opened her great mouth and out Tom jumped.  Then Tom's mother took him in her apron and ran with him to the house, but he was not hurt in the least.  [Illustration]  One day Tom was in the field helping his father.  \"Let me drive the horse home,\" said Tom \"You drive the horse!\" said his father.  \"How could you hold the reins?\"  \"I could stand in the horse's ear and tell him which way to go,\" said Tom.  So his father put him in the horse's ear, and he drove safely home.  \"Mother! mother!\" cried Tom.  But when Tom's mother came out, she could see no one.  She began to be afraid.  \"Where are you, Tom?\" she cried.  \"Here I am in the horse's ear. Please take me down,\" said Tom.  His mother lifted him gently down, kissed him, and gave him a blackberry for his supper.  Tom's father made him a whip out of a straw.  Tom tried to drive the cows, but he fell into a deep ditch.  There a great bird saw him and thought he was a mouse.  The bird seized Tom in her claws and carried him toward her nest.  As they were passing over the sea, Tom got away and fell into the water, where a great fish swallowed him at one mouthful.  Soon after this the fish was caught, and it was such a big one that it was sent at once to King Arthur.  When the cook cut open the fish, out jumped Tom Thumb. Tom was brought before the king, and his story was told.   TOM THUMB--IV  The king grew very fond of Tom and his wise sayings. He took Tom with him wherever he went.  If it began to rain, Tom would creep into the king's pocket and sleep until the rain was over.  The king had a new suit made for Tom, and gave him a needle for a sword.  A mouse was trained for Tom to ride.  The king and queen never tired of seeing him ride his queer little horse and bravely wave his sword.  One day, as they were going hunting, a cat jumped out and caught Tom's mouse.  [Illustration]  Tom drew his sword and tried to drive the cat away.  The king ran to help poor Tom, but the little mouse was dead, and Tom was scratched and bitten.  Tom was put to bed, but he did not die.  No indeed! he was soon well again, and fought many brave battles and did many brave deeds to please the king.  _English Fairy Tale_     [Illustration]      SUPPOSE      wouldn't  pouring  earnest  lady       Suppose, my little lady,       Your doll should break her head,     Could you make it whole by crying       Till your eyes and nose are red?
