A subspecies, _D. s. cratodon_ Merriam, has been described from Chicalote, Aguas Calientes, Mexico, the geographic range of which lies in central Mexico in portions of the States of Zacatecas, San Luis Potosi, and Aguas Calientes.   HABITAT.  In the Tucson region _spectabilis_ is typically a resident of the Lower Sonoran Zone. This is perhaps the principal zone inhabited over its entire range, but the animal is often found in the Upper Sonoran also, and in the Gallina Mountains of New Mexico Hollister found it invading the yellow pine Transition where the soil was dry and sandy and the pine woods of open character. The same observer found it common in grassy and weed-grown parks among the large junipers, pinyons, and scattering yellow pines of the Bear Spring Mountains, N. Mex. Bailey calls attention to the fact that the animal apparently does not inhabit the lower half of the Lower Sonoran Zone, as it extends neither into the Rio Grande Valley of Texas nor the Gila Valley of Arizona. In extreme western Texas it is common at the upper edge of the arid Lower Sonoran Zone, and in this region does not enter the Upper Sonoran to any extent.  In July, 1914, Goldman found this kangaroo rat common on the plain at 4,600 feet altitude, near Bonita, Graham County, Ariz., and noted a few as high as 5,000 feet altitude on the warm southwestern slopes of the Graham Mountains, near Fort Grant. Apparently _spectabilis_ reaches its upper altitude limit in the Burro Mountains, N. Mex., where Bailey has found it sparingly on warm slopes up to 5,700 feet, and at the western base of the Sandia Mountains, east of Albuquerque, N. Mex., where dens occur at approximately 6,000 feet.  About Tucson it is undoubtedly more common in the somewhat higher portions of the Lower Sonoran Zone, above the _Covillea_ association, than elsewhere (Pl. IV, Figs. 1 and 2). A few scattered dens are to be seen in the _Covillea_ belt, but as one rises to altitudes of 3,500 to 4,000 feet, and the _Covillea_ is replaced by the cat's-claws (_Acacia_ sp. and _Mimosa_ sp.) and scattered mesquite (_Prosopis_), with the _Opuntia_ becoming less abundant, kangaroo rat mounds come more and more in evidence. Here is to be found the principal grass growth supporting the grazing industry, and the presence of a more luxuriant grass flora is probably an important factor in the greater abundance of kangaroo rats, both _spectabilis_ and _merriami_. In this generally preferred environment the desert hackberry (_Celtis pallida_) is one of the most conspicuous shrubs; clumps of this species are commonly accompanied by kangaroo rat mounds.  In order to ascertain whether the banner-tailed kangaroo rat has any marked preference for building its mounds under _Celtis_ or some other particular plant, all the observable mounds were counted in a strip about 20 rods wide and approximately 4 miles long, an area of approximately 160 acres, particular note being taken of the kind of shrub under which each mound was located. Of 300 mounds in this area, 96 were under _Prosopis_, 95 under _Acacia_, 65 under _Celtis_, 11 under _Lycium_, 31 in the open, 1 about a \"cholla\" cactus (_Opuntia spinosior_), and 1 about a prickly pear (_Opuntia_ sp.). There is apparently no strongly marked preference for any single species of plant. While both desert hackberry and the cat's-claws afford a better protection than mesquite--since cattle more often seek shade under the latter, and in so doing frequently trample the mounds severely--it appears that the general protection of a tree or shrub of some sort is sought by kangaroo rats, rather than the specific protection of the thickest or thorniest species.  The following records indicate particular habitat preferences of _spectabilis_ as noted at different points in its range:       Occurs on open bare knolls exposed to winds, also on gravelly      places at lower edge of foothills (Franklin Mountains, Tex., Gaut);      here and there over the barest and hardest of the gravelly mesas      (Bailey, Tex., 1905, 147); on open creosote-bush and giant-cactus      desert (Tucson, Ariz., Vorhies and Taylor); on firm, gravelly, or      even rocky soil on the grassy bajada land along the northwest base      of the mountains, either in the open or under _Celtis_, _Prosopis_,      _Lycium_, _Acacia greggii_, or other brush (Santa Rita Mountains,      Ariz., Vorhies and Taylor); mounds usually thrown up around a bunch      of cactus or mesquite brush (Magdalena, Sonora, Bailey); in heavy      soil (Ajo, Ariz., A. B. Howell); loamy soil (Gunsight, Ariz., A. B.      Howell); in mesa where not too stony (Magdalena, Sonora, Bailey);      grassy plain (Gallego, Chihuahua, Nelson); in open valley and high      open plains (Santa Rosa, N. Mex., Bailey); in grassy and weed-grown      parks among the larger junipers, pinyons, and scattering yellow      pines (Bear Spring Mountains, N. Mex., Hollister); on sand-dune      strip (east side of Pecos River, 15 miles northeast of Roswell, N.      Mex., Bailey); among _Ephedra_ patches (San Juan Valley, N. Mex.,      Birdseye); in open sandy soil along dry wash (Rio Alamosa, N. Mex.,      Goldman); on sides and crests of bare, stony hills (Mesa Jumanes,      N. Mex., Gaut); in open, arid part of the valley and stony mesas      (Carlsbad and Pecos Valley, N. Mex., Bailey); about the edges of      the plains of San Augustine and the foothills of the Datil and      Gallina Mountains, and in the Transition Zone yellow-pine forest of      the Gallina Mountains (Datil region, N. Mex., Hollister); on hard      limy ridges (Monahans, Tex., Cary).  A. Brazier Howell notes that _spectabilis_ occurs in harder soil than does _deserti_. This observation is confirmed by others, and seems to afford a conspicuous habitat difference between the two, for _deserti_ is typically an animal of the shifting aeolian sands.  Usually, as on the Range Reserve, the rodents are widely distributed over a considerable area. Occasionally, as in the vicinity of Rio Alamosa, N. Mex., as reported by Goldman, they occur only in small colonies.   [Illustration: PLATE IV. FIG. 1.--RANGE CONDITIONS FAVORING KANGAROO RATS.

FIG. 2.--RANGE CONDITIONS LESS FAVORABLE TO KANGAROO RATS.  View on lower portion of Range Reserve, where _Dipodomys s. spectabilis_ is less abundant. Vegetation consists principally of _Lycium_, mesquite, rabbit brush, and cactus, there being very little grass.]     HABITS.   EVIDENCE OF PRESENCE.   MOUNDS.  One traveling over territory thickly occupied by the banner-tailed kangaroo rat is certain to note the numerous and conspicuous mounds so characteristic of the species, particularly if the region is of the savannah type, grassy rather than brushy. These low, rounded mounds occupy an area of several feet in diameter, and rise to varying heights above the general surface of the surrounding soil, the height depending rather more upon the character of the soil and the location of the mound as to exposure or protection than upon the area occupied by the burrow system which lies within and is the reason for the mound.  A den in sandy soil in the open may be of maximum size in area occupied and yet scarcely present the appearance of a mound in any sense, due probably both to the fact that the sandy soil will not heap up to such a height over a honeycomb of tunnels as will a firmer or rocky soil, and also to its greater exposure to the leveling action of rains and the trampling of animals. These mounds are in themselves large enough to attract some attention, but their conspicuousness is enhanced by the fact that they are more or less completely denuded of vegetation and are the centers of cleared areas often as much as 30 feet in diameter (Pl. V, Fig. 1); and further that from 3 to 12 large dark openings loom up in every mound. The larger openings are of such size as to suggest the presence of a much larger animal than actually inhabits the mound. Add to the above the fact that the traveler by day never sees the mound builder, and we have the chief reasons why curiosity is so often aroused by these habitations.  On the Range Reserve the mounds are usually rendered conspicuous by the absence of small vegetation, but Nelson writes that in the vicinity of Gallego, Chihuahua, they can be readily distinguished at a distance because of a growth of weeds and small bushes over their summits, which overtop the grass. In the vicinity of Albuquerque, N. Mex., Bailey reports (and this was recently confirmed by Vorhies) that the mounds about the holes of _spectabilis_ are often hardly noticeable. Hollister writes that in the yellow-pine forests of the Gallina Mountains the burrows are usually under the trunk of some fallen pine, both sides of it in some cases being taken up with holes, there being some eight or ten entrances along each side, the burrows extending into the ground beneath the log. In the vicinity of Blanco, N. Mex., Birdseye says that occasionally _spectabilis_ makes typical dens but more often lives in old prairie-dog holes (_Cynomys_), or in holes which look more like those of _D. ordii_.   RUNWAYS AND TRACKS.  Still other features add to the interest in the dwelling places of _spectabilis_. Radiating in various directions from some of the openings of the mounds well-used runways are to be seen, some of them fading out in the surrounding vegetation, but others extending 30, 40, or even 50 or more yards to neighboring burrows or mounds (Pl. V, Fig. 2; Pl. VI, Fig. 1). These runways and the entrances to the mounds are well worn, showing that the inhabitants are at home"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17968"],["title","Boer Politics (#1)"],["body"," \"A policy of force is openly declared against us; £250,000 have      been expended on the construction of forts; upon one alone,      designed to terrorise the inhabitants of Johannesburg, £100,000 has      been spent. Large orders have been given to Krupp for big guns and      maxims; and it is said that German Officers are coming to drill the      burghers.\"  The Uitlanders of Johannesburg treated with contumely, adopted the theories made use of by the Boers in their Petition of Rights of February 17th, 1881, by which they justified their insurrection against British rule, of December, 1880.       \"Then the cause was unexpectedly helped on by the courageous      resistance of O. Bezuidenhout against the seizure of his household      effects for non-payment of taxes. Here was a breach of the law easy      to lay hold of; here was a crime indeed! It was illegal,      undoubtedly, but illegal in the same sense as was the refusal of      Hampden to pay the four or five shillings \"ship money\"; the taking      of den Briel by the Watergeuzen (Waterbeggars) in 1572; as was the      throwing overboard of a cargo of tea in Boston; as was the plot in      Cape Colony against the importation of convicts. All these acts      were illegal, but of such are the illegalities in which a people      takes refuge, when a Government fails in its duty to a law higher      than that of man.\"  In virtue of the principles invoked by the Boers, the Johannesburg Uitlanders entered into a conspiracy; Jameson was to come to their aid after they had risen. Messrs. Leonard and Phillips put themselves in communication with Cecil Rhodes. He listened to their manifesto, and the instant they came to the mention of free trade in South Africa, he said: \"That will do for me.\" The supposition that he desired to annex the Transvaal is absurd.[1] He has admitted that he gave his personal co-operation to Jameson without having first consulted his colleagues of the Chartered Company. Jameson was to have gone to the assistance of the Uitlanders; not to forestall the insurrection, which was fixed for January 4th. On December 29th, Jameson invaded the Transvaal with 480 men. They got as far as Krugersdorp, about 31 miles distant from Johannesburg, and after a fight at Doornkop, in which the Raiders' losses were 18 killed and 40 wounded, and on the Boers' side four killed and five wounded, they surrendered on the condition that their lives should be spared.  That stipulation is forgotten when we fall to admiring President Krüger's magnanimity in handing over Jameson to the British Government.  [Footnote 1: Fitzpatrick. \"The Transvaal from Within.\" p. 122.]   _The Profits from the Jameson Raid._  The trial by the Government of Pretoria of the sixty-four members of the \"Reform Committee\" was held in Johannesburg. Four of them, Mr. Lionel Phillips, Colonel Rhodes, Mr. George Farrar, and Mr. Hammond were condemned to death. The remainder were sentenced to two years' imprisonment and £2,000 fine, or failing payment, to another year's imprisonment and three years' banishment. The Executive reserved to themselves the right to confiscate their property.  In commutation of the four death sentences, the Government exacted £100,000; fifty-six other prisoners paid in a sum of £112,000. One of the accused died, another who had pleaded not guilty, was so ill that his sentence was not carried out; Messrs. Sampson and Davies refused to pay the fine. The British Government left Mr. Krüger a free hand in the matter; it cannot be reproached with having interposed on their behalf--although it was its own representatives who persuaded the Johannesburg conspirators to deliver up their arms. In the moment of danger many and various hopes were held out by Mr. Krüger in his proclamation of December 30th, 1895. The danger once past, the promises were forgotten. He remembered the Jameson Raid only as an excuse for demanding an indemnity of £677,938 3s. 6d. for material damages, and a further £1,000,000 for damages \"moral and intellectual.\"  In February, 1896, Mr. Chamberlain proposed to him \"the autonomy of that portion occupied by mining industries\" (see details of the proposal, letter of Mr. Chamberlain, published in _Le Siècle_, July 5th, 1899.) Mr. Krüger refused contemptuously. At the same time he got the Volksraad to pass a bill giving him the right to expel any foreigner, at his discretion, at a fortnight's notice. Mr. Chamberlain reminded him that this bill was contrary to Act 14 of the Convention of 1884. Krüger took no notice of this remonstrance, and the bill became law on October 24th. In December, 1896, Mr. Chamberlain made a renewed protest.  The correspondence continued. Mr. Chamberlain recapitulated the breaches of the Convention of 1884 committed by the Boer Government. In the summer of 1897, the act was at last repealed, but always with the unavowed intention of re-enacting it in another form.  Mr. Krüger persistently continued to refuse all demands for reform, becoming more and more insolent, while, thanks to the wealth brought to the exchequer by the gold mines, he continued to increase the very armaments against which the petitioners of 1894 had protested.  To all representations, his answer was \"The Jameson Raid.\" To all Europe, his plea was \"The Jameson Raid.\" If you mention Transvaal affairs to a Pro-Boer, he shuts you up at once with \"what about the Jameson Raid?\" He will listen to no arguments; and loses his temper. If you suggest that the Jameson Raid bears a certain analogy to the expedition of Garibaldi's One Thousand, he gazes at you with amazement. If you proceed to remark that the Jameson Raid took place at the close of the year 1895; that we are now in 1900; that it is _res judicata_; that the British Government left Boer Justice a free hand to deal with the conspirators, he accuses you of having been bought by England. Not a whisper, of course, is heard about the millions of secret service money placed at the disposal of Dr. Leyds.   _The Logical Consequences of the Jameson Raid._  According to the Boers, they are briefly: (1) The Jameson Raid of Dec. 29th, 1895, gives the South African Republic the right in perpetuity to regard the Convention of 1884 as null and void. (2) The Jameson Raid gives the Government of the South African Republic the right to treat all Uitlanders, especially the British, as Boers treat Kaffirs. (3) The Jameson Raid gives the Government of the South African Republic an undefined and perpetual right to plunder the Uitlanders.  YVES GUYOT.     CHAPTER I.  BOER APOLOGISTS.[2]  1.--_Disregard of Facts and Subordination to the Vatican._   I notice with satisfaction, that people, who a short time ago would not listen to a word about the Transvaal, are now no longer animated by the same spirit of confidence, and are even beginning to wonder whether they have not fallen into the same mistake made by so many in the Dreyfus case, who only began to entertain doubts after the exposure of the Henry forgery.  I have been asked \"Why have you not answered Dr. Kuyper's article in the _Revue des Deux Mondes_?\" and it appears that Dr. Leyds has been heard to say in Brussels: \"M. Yves Guyot has made no answer to Dr. Kuyper's article.\" As though it were unanswerable!  I might well retort with the question: \"Why does the Pro-Boer press never reply to counter arguments save by vague phrases, and evading the real issue? Why does the French press, in particular, confine itself to lauding \"the brave Boers\" and the \"venerable President Krüger,\" and to extolling the virtues with which it credits them, instead of studying their actual social condition, and giving its readers the plain facts? Why do we not find one word in our papers of the articles by M.M. Villarais and Tallichet, published in the _Bibliothèque Universelle_.[3]\"  It is an exact repetition of the method employed by the Anti-Dreyfusard papers in the Dreyfus case. But the odd thing is, that many who were then exasperated by it, now look upon it as quite natural, and are not surprised to find themselves bosom friends of Drumont, Rochefort, Judet, and Arthur Mayer. The Transvaal question unites them in a \"nationalist\" policy, which, if it were to go beyond mere words, would result in a war with England and might complete, by a naval Sedan, the disaster of 1870.  The majority of Frenchmen have brought to the scrutiny of the matter a degree of pigheadedness that clearly proves the influence of our method of subjective education. We state our faith on words, and believe--because it is a mystery.  The _Revue des Deux Mondes_, in which Dr. Kuyper's article is published (February 1st), has become an organ of Leo XIII. Those free-thinkers, protestants, and Jews in France who take part in the Anglophobe movement, are thus naively furthering the aims of the Vatican and the Jesuits, whose endeavour has ever been to stir up Europe against England--England that shall never be forgiven for the liberalism of her institutions, for the independence of her thinkers, and for her politics, to which they attribute, not without reason, the downfall of the temporal power.  The apologetic portion of Dr. Kuyper's article shows the Boers in their true light. Far from refuting it, I will quote from it. The critical part obscures the points at issue. I will clear them up.

He begins by waxing wroth with the English who, in 1816, in consequence of the representations of their missionaries, had instituted an enquiry as to the manner in"]]]
