Gladys's eyes nearly popped out of her head as Sahwah cast herself headlong into the water.  \"Awfully sorry, 'Wisi, I dropped it in off the tower,\" said Sahwah, tendering her the glass, \"will getting it wet hurt it any?\"  Nakwisi screwed her beloved glass back and forth and wiped the lenses and finally reported it unharmed.  \"Sahwah, Sahwah,\" said Nyoda, shaking her head, \"you will never learn to be careful of other people's things?\"  Sahwah flushed.  \"I didn't mean to be careless with it, it just slipped out of my hand.\"  Here Hinpoha spoke up. \"It's all my fault, Nyoda,\" she explained. \"I hit her with a pine cone and made her drop it.\"  Nyoda could do nothing but laugh at the good-natured sparring that was continually going on between those two.  \"Come on, girls,\" she called, \"and get dry clothes on. Whoever gets dressed first may go to the village with me this afternoon.\"  The girls scurried up the steep path like squirrels and Nyoda followed more slowly with Gladys, whose city shoes made it hard for her to climb.  As they went up she explained how she happened to be so wet, describing in detail the upsetting of the canoes. Gladys's eyes opened wide at the tale of Sahwah's pranks.  \"How dreadful,\" she said with a shudder, and Nyoda sighed inwardly, for she realized that she had a problem on her hands.  Gladys Evans was not a regular member of the Winnebago Camp Fire. She did not attend the public high school where the other girls went, but went to a private girls' school in the East.  Early in the spring, Mr. Evans, with whom Miss Kent was slightly acquainted, came to her and offered her group the use of his camping grounds on Loon Lake in Maine for the summer if they would take Gladys in and teach her to do the things they did.  He had become interested in the Winnebago group through a picture of them in the newspaper, and thought it would be a fine thing for Gladys.  He and Mrs. Evans were going on an all-summer trip through Canada with a party of friends, and wanted to put Gladys where she would have a good time.  He added in confidence that Gladys had been in the company of grown-ups so much that she felt altogether too grown up herself, and he wished her to romp a whole summer in bloomers and forget about styles.  Miss Kent gladly accepted the charge.  Aside from her willingness to help Gladys, the offer of a camping ground for the summer was irresistible.  All winter the girls had been trying to find a place to camp for at least a few weeks the next summer, and had given a play to raise the money.  They had not thought of going so far away as Maine, but now that they could have the camp without paying for it they could use the money for railroad fares.  Such a shout went up from the Winnebagos when Miss Kent broke the news that passersby paused to listen.  They sang a dozen different cheers to Gladys and her father; then they cheered for the lake and the camp and the good time they were going to have until they were too hoarse to speak.  Gladys was then away at school and was to be in New York City with her parents until the first of July, so Miss Kent and her girls came up the last week in June to open camp.  Gladys had never seen the place until that day, for her father had just bought it the previous winter.  That she did not want to come was evident to Miss Kent.  She was overdressed and rather supercilious looking, and was not strong enough to really enjoy the rough and tumble life of the camp.  Miss Kent realized that some adjusting would be necessary before Gladys would be transformed into a genuine Winnebago. \"But we'll do it, never fear,\" she thought brightly, with the unquenchable optimism that had won for her the name of \"Face Toward the Mountain.\"    CHAPTER II.  THE COUNCIL FIRE.  Supper, which was eaten on the big rock overhanging the lake, was made short work of, for tonight was to be held the first Council Fire.  \"What's going to happen?\" asked Gladys of Nyoda, watching the girls scrambling out of their bloomers and middies and into brown khaki dresses trimmed with leather fringe.  \"Ceremonial Meeting,\" answered Nyoda, slipping on a pair of beaded moccasins.  \"What's that?\" asked Gladys.  \"You'll see,\" said Nyoda.  \"Follow the girls when I call them.\"  Nyoda slipped out of her tent and disappeared into the woods.  In a few minutes a clear call rang out through the stillness: \"Wohelo, Wohelo, come ye all Wohelo.\"  The girls stepped forward in a single file, their arms folded in front of them, singing as they went, \"Wohelo, Wohelo, come we all Wohelo.\"  Gladys followed at the tail of the procession.  Nyoda stood in the center of a circular space about twenty feet across among the trees, completely surrounded by high pines.  In the middle the fire was laid.  The girls took their places in the circle, and Gladys, now arrayed in bloomers and middy, with her hair down in two braids and a leather band around her forehead, sat under a tree and looked on.  Not being a Camp Fire Girl she could not sit in the Council Circle.  Nyoda made fire with the bow and drill, and when the leaping flames lit up the circle of faces the girls sprang to their feet and sang, \"Burn, fire, burn,\" and then, \"Mystic Fire,\" with its dramatic gestures. Gladys, sitting in the shadows, looked on curiously at the fantastically clad figures passing back and forth around the fire singing,      \"Ghost-dance round the mystic ring,     Faces in the starlight glow,     Maids of Wohelo.     Praises to Wokanda sing,     While the music soft and low     Rubbing sticks grind slow.     Dusky forest now darker grown,     Broods in silence o'er its own,     Till the wee spark to a flame has blown,     And living fire leaps up to greet     The song of Wohelo.\"  As they chanted the words the girls acted out with gestures the dancing ghosts, the brooding forest, the rubbing sticks and  the leaping fire.  So they proceeded through the strange measures, ending up in a close circle around the fire, all making the hand sign of fire together.  Gladys began to be stirred with a desire to sit in the circle.  When the girls were again seated in their original places and the roll called, Nyoda rose and read the rules of camp.  No one was to leave the camp without telling at least one person where she was going, or the general direction in which she was going, and the length of time she expected to be gone.  No candy was to be bought in the village.  No one was to go in swimming except at the regular swimming time.  Every one pointed a finger at Sahwah when this was read, for she had been going into the lake at least a dozen times a day.  No one could go in swimming whose belongings were not in order at tent inspection time.  A groan went around the circle at this.  Nyoda dwelt with particular emphasis on the rules governing the canoes.  No one could go out in a canoe who had not taken the swimming test.  No one could go out in a canoe unless Sahwah, Hinpoha or herself were along. Disobedience to these rules would mean having to stay out of the canoes altogether.  She explained to the girls the importance of implicit obedience to the one in charge of a boat, regardless of personal feeling, and how the captain of a vessel had absolute authority over those on board. She spoke of the necessity of coolheadedness and courage on the part of the girl in charge, and ability to control her temper. She said she knew Sahwah and Hinpoha were well able to have charge of a canoe and she would never feel uneasy to have the other girls go out with them.  Hinpoha and Sahwah flushed with pleasure and mentally resolved to die rather than prove unworthy of her trust.  Gladys gave a little start when the canoe rules were read.  She could not swim.  She had been looking forward to going out in a canoe very shortly.  The rest of the rules dealt with the day's schedule, which was as follows:      Rising bugle at seven.     Morning dip.     Breakfast.     Song hour.     Tent inspection.     Craft work.     Folk dancing.     Swimming.     Lesson in camp cookery.     Dinner.     Rest hour.     Nature study.     Two hours spent in any way preferred.     Supper.     Evening open for any kind of stunt.     First bugle, 8:30.     Lights out, 9:00.  Ceremonial meeting would be held every week on Monday night, because the girls had so many opportunities to win honors now that a whole month would be too long to wait.  After the announcements Nyoda awarded the honors.  Medmangi had taken the swimming test, Nakwisi and Chapa had righted an overturned canoe, Sahwah had built a reflecting oven and baked biscuits in it.  All the girls had won some kind of an honor. Gladys listened wonderingly to the account of the things they had accomplished--things she did not have the faintest notion of how to do.  Then came the elevating of Migwan to the rank of Fire Maker. Proudly she exhibited her fourteen purple beads, indicating the fulfilment of the fourteen requirements.  Nyoda asked her questions on the things she had learned, and asked her to explain to the girls how much better she had gotten along since she started to keep an itemized account book.  Migwan blushed and hung her head, for figures were an abomination to her and keeping accounts a fearful task.  If it had not been for her ambition to be a Fire Maker she would never have attempted it at all, but once having learned how she realized their value, and heroically resolved to keep accurate accounts right along.  When it came to the subject of bandaging she had to give demonstrations of triangular and roller bandaging, with Hinpoha as the subject. Then in a clear, earnest voice she dedicated her \"strength, her ambition, her heart's desire, her joy and her sorrow\" to the keeping up of the flame of love for her fellow creatures. Satisfied that Migwan was a worthy candidate, Nyoda slipped the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18606"],["title","The Camp Fire Girls in the Maine Woods; Or, The Winnebagos Go Camping (#2)"],["body"," bracelet on her arm and proclaimed her a Fire Maker. Migwan blushed fiery red and hung her head modestly.  \"Speech, speech!\" shouted the girls.  \"Give us a poem, Migwan.\"  Migwan thought a moment and then recited dramatically:      \"I am a Fire Maker!     I have completed     The Fourteen Requirements!     I have repeated     The Fire Maker's Desire!     Now I may light     The great Council Fire!     Now I may kindle     The Wohelo Candles!     Long months have I labored     Gathering firewood,     That I might kindle     The Fire of Wohelo!     My arm is encircled     With a silver bracelet,     The outward symbol     Of the Fire I have kindled;     And those who behold it     Shall say to each other,     'Lo, she has labored,     She has given service,     She has pursued knowledge,     She has been trustworthy,     Fulfilled the requirements,     She is a Fire Maker!'     That symbol is sacred,     A charm against evil,     Evil thoughts and dark passions,     Against envy and hatred!     One step am I nearer     The goal of my ambition,     To be a Torch Bearer     Is now my desire!     To carry aloft     The threefold flame,     The symbol of Work,     Of Health and of Love,     The flaming, enveloping     Symbol of Love     Triumphant; where might fails     I conquer by Love!     Where I have been led     I now will lead others,     Undimmed will I pass on     The light I have kindled;     The flame in my hand     Shall mount higher and higher,     To be a Torch Bearer     Is now my desire!\"  A round of applause followed.  Next the \"Count\" was called for. This had also been written by Migwan.  In rippling Hiawatha meter it told how the Winnebagos had journeyed      \"From their homes in distant Cleveland     To Loon Lake's inviting waters--\"  how they pitched the tents and made the beds, how they named the tents Alpha and Omega, how eagerly they awaited Gladys's coming, how Sahwah was placed on the tower to wave at her,      \"And the telescope descending,     Fell kersplash into the water,\"  and all the rest of the doings up to the beginning of Council Fire.  Nyoda then rose and said that as the Camp Fire was a singing movement she wished the girls to write as many songs as possible, and to encourage this had worked out a system of local honors for songs which could be sung by the Winnebagos.  Any girl writing the words of a song which was adopted for use would receive a leather W cut in the form of wings to represent \"winged words\" or poetry; the honor for composing the music for a song would be a winged note cut from leather, and the honor for writing both words and music would be a combination of the two. These were to be known as the \"Olowan\" honors, because \"Olowan\" was the Winnebago word for song, and were quite independent of the National song honors, because a great many songs which could not be adopted by the National organization would be admirable for use in the local group on account of their aptness.  Just before they sang the Goodnight Song, Nyoda drew Gladys into the group and officially invited her to become a Winnebago at the next Council Fire. Gladys accepted the invitation and the girls sang a ringing cheer to her because her coming made it possible for them to have the camp.  To close the Ceremonial Meeting the girls sang \"Mammy Moon,\" ending up by lying in a circle around the fire, their heads pillowed on one another.  The fire was burning very low now and great shadows from the woods lay across the open space.  Nyoda stole silently to the edge of the clearing and the girls rose and filed past her, softly singing \"Now our Camp Fire's burning low.\" Nyoda held each girl's hand in a warm clasp for a moment as she passed before her and the girls clung to her lovingly.  The forest was so big and dark, and they were so far from home, and Nyoda was so strong and tender!  \"Wasn't it wonderful?\" whispered Migwan to Sahwah, as they picked their way back to the tents in the darkness.  \"Wasn't it, though!\" answered Sahwah, flashing her little bug light on the path before her.  Gladys's bed was in the Omega tent with Sahwah, Hinpoha and Migwan.  One end faced the lake and the stars peeked in with friendly twinkles, while the moon flooded the place with silver light.  The three girls were out of their Ceremonial costumes and into their nightgowns in no time, while Gladys fussed around nervously.  \"Aren't we going to have the lantern lit?\" she asked.  \"What for?\" said Sahwah.  \"The moon makes it as bright as day.\"  Gladys took off her middy.  \"Where are we going to hang our clothes?\" she asked next.  \"Throw them across the foot of your bed,\" answered Hinpoha, \"or lay them on the stool, or up on the swinging shelf, or hang them on the floor, the way Sahwah does.\"  At this Sahwah sat up in bed and threw her pillow at Hinpoha. Hinpoha sent it back and Sahwah threw it the second time.  Instead of hitting Hinpoha, however, it landed in the basin of water in which Gladys was trying to wash herself, knocking it off the stand and out of the tent door. Gladys gave an exclamation of impatience.  Sahwah hastened to apologize. \"I'm awfully sorry, Gladys.  But you saw how it was. I was trying to hit 'Poha and hit you by mistake.\"  Here the pent-up laughter of the three girls broke forth, and they shouted in unison.  Gladys did not laugh.  \"I'll get you some more water,\" said Sahwah, getting out of bed.  The pail was empty, so Sahwah went all the way down to the lake for water.  On the way back she rescued the pillow, which was soaking wet, and stood it up against the tent pole to dry.  Just then came a loud hail from the other tent.  \"Goodnight, Omegas!\"  \"Good night, Alphas,\" they answered, \"sleep tight!\" Again came the fourfold voice out of Alpha, \"Goodnight, Gladys!\"  Gladys was finally ready for bed.  \"You aren't going to leave the sides of the tent rolled up all night, are you?\" she asked in a horrified tone.  \"We surely are,\" said Sahwah, \"we always do.\"  \"What if it rains?\"  \"Plenty of time then to put them down.\"  Gladys stood irresolute beside the bed.  \"We'll put your side down, if you prefer it,\" said Migwan good-naturedly, \"but it's really pleasanter with it up.  It seemed rather airy to me at first, but now I wouldn't have it down for anything.\"  \"Don't trouble yourself,\" said Gladys.  \"Sure, I'll put it down,\" said Migwan, making a motion to rise, but just then the second bugle rang out and she subsided.  Gladys got into bed and pulled the blankets over her head.  It was the first time she had ever slept out of doors.  She felt very small and lonesome and neglected.  She had not wanted to come to this camp the least bit.  Other summers she had always gone to Atlantic City or some other crowded, lively summer resort with her parents, where she had received considerable attention from young men, just like the older girls with whom she associated.  Here, banished to the silent woods, she saw the summer stretch out endlessly before her, intolerably dull and uninteresting.  She loved fluffy clothes and despised the bloomers and middies which the girls wore. She loved dainty table service and hated to cook.  Up here she would be expected to help with the meals, and all there was to cook on was an open fire and a gasoline stove!  What could her father have been thinking of to want her to join such a club!  These girls were not in her own class; they went to public school, they were rough and horrid and threw each other into the water!  Gladys could not go to sleep.  She tossed restlessly, thinking rebellious thoughts, and shuddering at the night noises in the woods.  The lapping of the water on the rocks below had a lonesome sound.  She had not yet learned to hear its soft crooning lullaby.  The wind rustled in the pine trees with a ghostly, mysterious sound.  From somewhere in the woods came a mournful cry that sent the chills up and down her spine.  It was only a whippoorwill, but Gladys did not know a whippoorwill from a bluebird.  Then the frogs in a distant pool began their concert. \"Blub!\" \"Blub!\" \"Knee-deep!\" \"Better go round!\" \"Knee-deep!\" \"Better go round!\" \"Skeel!\" \"Skeek!\" \"Skeel!\" \"Skeek!\" \"Blub!\" \"Glub!\" \"Chralk!\"  Gladys's eyes started out of her head at the unearthly noises.  Her nerves were just about on edge from their incessant piping when suddenly a long, eerie laugh rang out over the water.  \"Ah-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!  Ah-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!\"  She screamed aloud and sat up in bed.  \"What's the matter?\" said Migwan, waking up.  \"What was it?  Oh, what was it?\" asked Gladys in a voice cold with terror.  \"What was what?\" said Migwan.  Just then the sound rang out again.  \"That!\" said Gladys.  \"Why, that's nothing but a loon,\" answered Migwan.  \"Isn't it lovely!\"  And she fell asleep again.  But slumber would not come to Gladys.  The bed sagged in the middle and she could not get herself adjusted to it.  She was finally in the act  of dozing off when the bed collapsed with a jarring crash.  Instantly the whole camp was awake.  Migwan jumped up and lit the lantern, and Nyoda came running over from Alpha to see what was the matter.  There was much laughter over the mishap, but unfortunately Gladys got the idea that Sahwah, who had giggled uncontrollably from the start, was responsible for the bed going down.  \"You made it fall down,\" she said to her, and burst into tears. Sahwah stared at her open mouthed.  \"I never touched it,\" she declared.  Nyoda hastened to smooth things over.  \"Nobody made your bed collapse, dear,\" she said, putting her arm around Gladys, \"it's a trick camp beds have.\" Gladys went on crying, however, so Nyoda sat down on the edge of her bed and talked soothingly to her. She realized that Gladys felt strange in camp and was probably homesick in spite of the fact that the girls had received her with open arms.  So to divert the girl's attention from herself she pointed out the constellations blazing in the sky and told some of their stories, and Gladys gradually"]]]
