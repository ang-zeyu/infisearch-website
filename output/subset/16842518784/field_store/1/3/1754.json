How weird it sounded in the darkness of the still spring night! The cold chills ran down his back and he caught his mother's dress as she reached for the rifle that stood beside her bed.  \"You're not goin' out there, Ma?\" the Boy protested.  \"Yes. It's a dirty thief after our horse.\"  Her voice was low and steady and her hand was without tremor as she grasped his.  \"Get back in bed. I won't be gone a minute.\"  She left the cabin and noiselessly walked toward the low shed in which the horse was stabled.  The Boy was at her heels. She knew and rejoiced in the love that made him brave for her sake.  She paused a moment, listened, and then lifted her tall, slim form and advanced steadily. Her bare feet made no noise. The waning moon was shining with soft radiance. The Boy's heart was in his throat as he watched her slender neck and head outlined against the sky. Never had he seen anything so calm and utterly brave.  There was a slight noise at the stable. The chickens cackled with louder call. Five minutes passed and they were silent. A shadowy figure appeared at the corner of the stable. She raised the rifle and flashed a dagger-like flame into the darkness.  A smothered cry, the shadow leaped the fence and the beat of swift feet could be heard in the distance.  The Boy clung close to her side and his voice was husky as he spoke:  \"Ain't you afraid, Ma?\"  The calm answer rang forever through his memory:  \"I don't know what fear means, my Boy. It's not the first time I've caught these prowling scoundrels.\"  Next morning he saw the dark blood marks on the trail over which the thief had fled, and looked into his mother's wistful grey eyes with a new reverence and awe.   IV  The Boy was quick to know and love the birds of hedge and field and woods. The martins that built in his gourds on the tall pole had opened his eyes. The red and bluebirds, the thrush, the wren, the robin, the catbird, and song sparrows were his daily companions.  A mocking-bird came at last to build her nest in a bush beside the garden, and her mate began to make the sky ring with his song. The puzzle of the feathered tribe whose habits he couldn't fathom was the whip-poor-will. His mother seemed to dislike his ominous sound. But the soft mournful notes appealed to the Boy's fancy. Often at night he sat in the doorway of the cabin watching the gathering shadows and the flicker of the fire when supper was cooking, listening to the tireless song within a few feet of the house.  \"Why don't you like 'em, Ma?\" he asked, while one was singing with unusually deep and haunting voice so near the cabin that its echo seemed to come from the chimney jamb.  It was some time before she replied:  \"They say it's a sign of death for them to come so close to the house.\"  The Boy laughed:  \"You don't believe it?\"  \"I don't know.\"  \"Well, I like 'em,\" he stoutly declared. \"I like to feel the cold shivers when they sing right under my feet. You're not afraid of a little whip-poor-will?\"  He looked up into her sombre face with a smile.  \"No,\" was the gentle answer, \"but I want to live to see my Boy a fine strong man,\" she paused, stooped, and drew him into her arms.  There was something in her tones that brought a lump into his throat. The moon was shining in the full white glory of the Southern spring. A night of marvellous beauty enfolded the little cabin. He looked into her eyes and they were shining with tears.  \"What's the matter?\" he asked tenderly.  \"Nothing, Boy, I'm just dreaming of you!\"         *       *       *       *       *  The first day of the fall in his sixth year he asked his mother to let him go to the next corn-shucking.  \"You're too little a boy.\"  \"I can shuck corn,\" he stoutly argued.  \"You'll be good, if I let you go?\" she asked.  \"What's to hurt me there?\"  \"Nothing, unless you let it. The men drink whiskey, the girls dance. Sometimes there's a quarrel or fight.\"  \"It won't hurt me ef I 'tend to my own business, will it?\"  \"Nothing will ever hurt you, if you'll just do that, Boy,\" the father broke in.  \"May I go?\"  \"Yes, we're invited next week to a quilting and corn-shucking. I'll go with you.\"  The Boy shouted for joy and counted the days until the wonderful event. They left home at two o'clock in the wagon. The quilting began at three, the corn-shucking at sundown.  The house was a marvellous structure to the Boy's excited imagination. It was the first home he had ever seen not built of logs.  \"Why, Ma,\" he cried in open-eyed wonder, \"there ain't no logs in the house! How did they ever put it together?\"  \"With bricks and mortar.\"  The Boy couldn't keep his eyes off this building. It was a simple, one-story square structure of four rooms and an attic, with little dormer windows peeping from the four sides of the pointed roof. McDonald, the thrifty Scotch-Irishman, from the old world, had built it of bricks he had ground and burnt on his own place.  The dormer windows peeping from the roof caught the Boy's fancy.  \"Do you reckon his boys sleep up there and peep out of them holes?\"  The mother smiled.  \"Maybe so.\"  \"Why don't we build a house like that?\" he asked at last. \"Don't you want it?\"  The mother squeezed his little hand:  \"When you're a man will you build your mother one?\"  He looked into her eyes a moment, caught the pensive longing and answered:  \"Yes. I will.\"  She stooped and kissed the firm mouth and was about to lead him into the large work-room where the women were gathering around the quilts stretched on their frames, when a negro slave suddenly appeared to take her horse to the stable. He was fat, jolly and coal black. His yellow teeth gleamed in their blue gums with a jovial welcome.  The Boy stood rooted to the spot and watched until the negro disappeared. It was the first black man he had ever seen. He had heard of negroes and that they were slaves. But he had no idea that one human being could be so different from another.  In breathless awe he asked:  \"Is he folks?\"  \"Of course, Boy,\" his mother answered, smiling.  \"What made him so black?\"  \"The sun in Africa.\"  \"What made his nose so flat and his lips so thick?\"  \"He was born that way.\"  \"What made him come here?\"  \"He didn't. The slave traders put him in chains and brought him across the sea and sold him into slavery.\"  The little body suddenly stiffened:  \"Why didn't he kill 'em?\"  \"He didn't know how to defend himself.\"  \"Why don't he run away?\"  \"He hasn't sense enough, I reckon. He's got a home, plenty to eat and plenty to wear, and he's afraid he'll be caught and whipped.\"  The mother had to pull the Boy with her into the quilting room. His eyes followed the negro to the stable with a strange fascination. The thing that puzzled him beyond all comprehension was why a big strong man like that, if he were a man, would submit. Why didn't he fight and die? A curious feeling of contempt filled his mind. This black thing that looked like a man, walked like a man and talked like a man couldn't be one! No real man would grin and laugh and be a slave. The black fool seemed to be happy. He had not only grinned and laughed, but he went away whistling and singing.  In three hours the quilts were finished and the men had gathered for the corn-shucking.  Before eight o'clock the last ear was shucked, and a long white pile of clean husked corn lay glistening in the moonlight where the dark pyramid had stood at sunset.  With a shout the men rose, stretched their legs and washed their hands in the troughs filled with water, provided for the occasion. They sat down to supper at four long tables placed in the kitchen and work room, where the quilts had been stretched.  Never had the Boy seen such a feast--barbecued shoat, turkeys, ducks, chickens, venison, bear meat, sweet potatoes, wild honey, corn dodgers, wheat biscuit, stickies and pound cake--pound cake until you couldn't eat another mouthful and still they brought more!  After the supper the young folks sang and danced before the big fires until ten o'clock, and then the crowd began to thin, and by eleven the last man was gone and the harvest festival was over.  It was nearly twelve before the Boy knelt at his mother's knee to say his prayers.  When the last words were spoken he still knelt, his eyes gazing into the flickering fire.  The mother bent low:  \"What are you thinking about, Boy? The house you're going to build for me?\"  \"No.\"  \"What?\"  \"That nigger--wasn't he funny? You don't want me to get you any niggers with the house do you?\"  \"No.\"  \"I didn't think you would,\" he went on thoughtfully, \"because you said General Washington set his slaves free and wanted everybody else to do it too.\"  He paused and shook his head thoughtfully. \"But he was funny--he was laughin' and whistlin' and singin'!\"   V  The air of the Southern autumn was like wine. The Boy's heart beat with new life. The scarlet and purple glory of the woods fired his imagination. He found himself whistling and singing at his tasks. He proudly showed a bee tree to his mother, the honey was gathered and safely stored. A barrel of walnuts, a barrel of hickory-nuts and two bushels of chestnuts were piled near his bed in the loft.  But the day his martins left, he came near breaking down. He saw them circle high in graceful sweeping curves over the gourds, chattering and laughing with a strange new note in their cries.  He watched them wistfully. His mother found him looking with shining eyes far up into the still autumn sky. His voice was weak and unsteady when he spoke:  \"I--can--hardly--hear--'em--now; they're so high!\"  A slender hand touched his tangled hair:  \"Don't worry, Boy, they'll come again.\"  \"You're sure, Ma?\" he asked, pathetically.  \"Sure.\"  \"Will they know when it's time?\"  \"Some one always tells them.\"  \"Who?\"  \""]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19138"],["title","Resonance in Singing and Speaking (#1)"],["body","twelve years of age by wrong methods, and they recovered only after a protracted season of rest. As a consequence her beautiful voice began to fail long before her splendid physique, and long before her years demanded. Singers taught in nature's way should be able to sing so long as strength lasts, and, like Adelaide Phillips, Carl Formes, and Sims Reeves, sing their sweetest songs in the declining years of life. Martel, at seventy years of age, had a full, rich voice. He focused all his tones alike, and employed deep abdominal breathing.  The whole matter of voice training has been clouded by controversy. The strident advocates of various systems, each of them \"the only true method,\" have in their disputes overcast the subject with much that is irrelevant, thus obscuring its essential simplicity.  The \"scientific\" teachers, at one extreme, have paid too exclusive attention to the mechanics of the voice. The \"empiricists\" have gone to the other extreme in leaving out of account fundamental facts in acoustics, physiology, and psychology.  The truth is that no purely human function, especially one so subtle as singing, can be developed mechanically; nor, on the other hand, can the mere _ipse dixit_ of any teacher satisfy the demands of the modern spirit.   PRINCIPLES ADVOCATED  The positions here advocated, because they seem both rational and simple, are:  =1. That the singing and speaking tones are identical, produced by the same organs in the same way, and developed by the same training.=  =2. That breathing is, for the singer, only an amplification of the correct daily habit.=  =3. That \"registers\" are a myth.=  =4. That \"head tones, chest tones, closed tones, open tones,\" etc., as confined to special parts of the range of the voice, are distracting distinctions arising from false education.=  =5. That resonance determines the quality and carrying power of every tone, and is therefore the most important element in the study and training of the voice.=  =6. That the obstacles to good speaking and singing are psychologic rather than physiologic.=  =7. That, in the nature of things, the right way is always an easy way.=     CHAPTER I  THE VOCAL INSTRUMENT   Since the vocal organism first became an object of systematic study, discussion has been constant as to whether the human vocal instrument is a stringed instrument, a reed instrument, or a whistle. Discussion of the question seems futile, for practically it is all of these and more. The human vocal organs form an instrument, _sui generis_, which cannot be compared with any other one thing. Not only is it far more complex than any other instrument, being capable, as it is, of imitating nearly every instrument in the catalogue and almost every sound in nature, but it is incomparably more beautiful, an instrument so universally superior to any made by man that comparisons and definitions fail.   ELEMENTS  The human vocal instrument has the three elements common to all musical instruments,--a motor, a vibrator, and a resonator; to which is added--what all other instruments lack--an articulator.  1. The respiratory muscles and lungs for a =motor=.  2. The vocal cords for a =vibrator=.  3. The throat, mouth, and the nasal and head cavities for a =resonator=.  4. The tongue, lips, teeth, and palate for an =articulator=.  These elements appear in as great a variety of size and proportion as do the variations of individual humanity, and each element is, moreover, variable according to the will or feeling of the individual. This susceptibility to change constitutes a modifying power which gives a variety in tone quality possible to no other instrument and makes it our wonder and admiration. The modification and interaction of these various parts produced by the emotions of the singer or speaker give qualities of tone expressive of the feelings, as of pain or pleasure, grief or joy, courage or fear.  [Illustration: FIGURE 1.--Section of the head and throat locating the organs of speech and song, including the upper resonators. The important maxillary sinus cannot well be shown. It is found within the maxillary bone (cheek bone). The inner end of the line marked _Nasal cavity_ locates it.]   TIMBRE  The minute differences in these physical conditions, coupled with the subtler differences in the psychical elements of the personality, account for that distinctive physiognomy of the voice called =timbre=, which is only another name for individuality as exhibited in each person. The same general elements enter into the composition of all voices, from the basso profundo to the high soprano.  That the reader may better understand the proportion and relations of the different parts of the vocal apparatus, a sectional drawing of the head is here produced, showing the natural position of the vocal organs at rest. As the drawing represents but a vertical section of the head the reader should note that the sinuses, like the eyes and nostrils, lie in pairs to the right and left of the centre of the face. The location of the maxillary sinuses within the maxillary or cheek bones cannot be shown in this drawing.  The dark shading represents the cavities of the throat, nose, and head. The relations of the parts are shown more accurately than is possible in any diagram. It will be noticed that the vibrations from the larynx would pass directly behind the soft palate into the nasal chamber, and very directly into the mouth. The nasal roof is formed by two bones situated between the eyes; the sphenoid or wedge-bone, which is connected with all other bones of the head, and the ethmoid or sieve-like bone. The structure of these two bones, especially of the ethmoid, consists of very thin plates or laminæ, forming a mass of air cavities which communicate by small openings with the nasal cavity below. Thus, the vibrations in the nose are transmitted to the air spaces above, and the effective qualities of the head vibrations are added to the tone.   THE LARYNX  The larynx or voice-box contains the vocal cords. Just above the vocal cords on each side is a large, deep cavity, called the ventricle. These cavities reinforce the primary vibrations set up by the cords and serve to increase their intensity as they are projected from the larynx. The larynx is the vibrating organ of the voice. It is situated at the base of the tongue and is so closely connected with it by attachment to the hyoid bone, to which the tongue is also attached, that it is capable of only slight movement independent of that organ; consequently it must move with the tongue in articulation. The interior muscles of the larynx vary the position of its walls, thus regulating the proximity and tension of the vocal cords. The male larynx is the larger and shows the Adam's apple. In both sexes the larynx of the low voice, alto or bass, is larger than that of the high voice, soprano or tenor. The larynx and tongue should not rise with the pitch of the voice, but drop naturally with the lower jaw as the mouth opens in ascending the scale. The proper position of the tongue will insure a proper position for the larynx. The less attention the larynx receives the better.   THE VOCAL CORDS  The vocal cords are neither cords nor bands, but instead are thick portions of membrane extending across the inner surface of the larynx. On account of familiarity the name _vocal cords_ will still be used. They are fairly well represented by the lips of the cornet player when placed on the mouthpiece of the instrument. The pitch of the tone is fixed by the tension of the vocal cords and the width and length of the opening between them. Their tension and proximity are self-adjusted to produce the proper pitch without any conscious volition of the singer. They can have no special training, needing only to be left alone. The work of the vocal cords, though essentially important, is, when naturally performed, light and consequently not exhausting. If the larynx and all of its supporting muscles are relaxed as they are in free and easy breathing, then when the air passes out through the larynx, the vocal cords will automatically assume a tension sufficient to vocalize the breath and give the note the proper pitch. The normal action of the cords will never cause hoarseness or discomfort. The sound should seem to be formed, not in the throat,--thus involving the vocal cords,--but in the resonance chambers.   THE EPIGLOTTIS  The epiglottis is the valve which closes over the upper opening of the larynx. It not only closes the mouth of the larynx when food is swallowed, but aids materially in converting into tone the vibrations set up by the vocal cords.   THE PHARYNX  The pharynx extends from the larynx to the nasal cavity. The size of the opening into the nasal chamber is controlled by the soft palate and is frequently entirely closed. The size of the pharynx is varied by the contraction and relaxation of the circular muscles in its tissue; when swallowing its walls are in contact. The pharynx acts as does the expanding tube of brass instruments. It increases the force and depth of the tone waves. The wider the pharynx is opened, without constraint, the fuller the resonance and the better the tone.   THE UNDER JAW  The under jaw furnishes attachment for the muscles of the tongue and hyoid or tongue bone. It also controls, owing to the connections of the larynx with the hyoid bone, the muscles that fix the position of the larynx.  The pterygoid muscles, which move the under jaw forward and backward, do not connect with the larynx, so their action does not compress that organ or in any way impede the action of the vocal apparatus. A relaxed under jaw allows freer action of the vocal cords and ampler resonance. The under jaw should drop little by little as the voice ascends the scale, thus opening the mouth slightly wider with each rise in the pitch of the tone. In ascending the scale it is well to open the throat a little wider as you ascend. The delivery will "]]]
