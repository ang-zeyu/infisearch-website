You don't care, do you, Florence?\"  \"No, indeed. I am glad you like it.\"  \"Now they are named, we will dress them.\"  \"How are you going to dress yours, Dimple?\"  \"I think I'll have a skirt of the blue and a waist of the pink. No, the other way, will look best, because the velvet is thickest, the skirt of pink and the waist of blue.\"  \"Well, I will have to make my doll's frock of all the same, with velvet trimming. Will that look well?\"  \"Lovely! What are you going to do with your piece, Bubbles?\"  \"Make a overskirt for Floridy Alabamy,\" said Bubbles, importantly.  \"Who?\" said Dimple, with her scissors ready to cut into the pink.  \"Floridy Alabamy,\" said Bubbles, gravely.  \"What a name!\" shrieked Dimple, throwing back her head in a fit of laughter. \"Florence, _did_ you hear? Floridy Alabamy.\"  And the girls laughed till the tears ran down their cheeks.  \"Bubbles, you are too ridiculous,\" said Dimple, while Bubbles pinned her bit of scarlet on her doll.  Just then Sylvy called her, and she ran off, holding her doll admiringly at arm's length.  \"She will dress it just like a darkey. You see,\" said Dimple, \"she has a purple dress on it now; think of that, with a scarlet overskirt; and I know she will make it a blue waist out of one of my old sash ribbons I gave her.\"  And sure enough, Floridy Alabamy did wear the three colors in triumph.  \"Do you like big or little dolls best?\" asked Florence.  \"I don't know,\" said Dimple. \"I think rather big or real little. Middle sizes are so hard to dress. They have to have such little fidgety sleeves and waists. I have two little dolls upstairs, and we can dress them up next. I believe one of them has an arm off, but it can be mended. How many dolls have you?\"  \"Four, now,\" answered Florence. \"I had five, but Gertrude broke one. Gertrude is such a mischief, I have to keep all my things locked up. I hope to goodness they won't let her get at them while I'm away.\"  \"Oh, you must make a traveling dress for your Celestine. I have a piece of grey linen that will just do.\"  By the time the dinner bell rang, both the dolls were dressed gorgeously.  \"Aren't they lovely, papa?\" said Dimple, as she hobbled out to meet him.  \"Yes; they look like two butterflies,\" he said, lifting her up, doll and all.  \"Are you having a good time, Florence? I hope Dimple hasn't pinched or scratched you yet.\"  \"Why, papa,\" said Dimple, looking very much hurt. \"Florence will think I am a regular little cat,\" but seeing a twinkle in his eyes, she knew he was only in fun, and was consoled by the kiss he gave her as he put her in her chair at the table.  There was a long afternoon before them, and, although Dimple could not walk very well with her bandaged foot, she managed to get down to her favorite place, under a big tree, where the grass was long and thick.  \"Now we can play beautifully with our dolls, Florence,\" she said, \"and have no one to disturb us, for Bubbles doesn't count. She has to be in the kitchen for a while anyhow.\"  They had not been out very long before Bubbles came running to them. \"There is a lady and a boy in the house, Miss Dimple,\" she said, \"and your mamma's a bringin' the boy out hyah.\"  \"A boy!\" said both the girls in horror.  \"Think of it, Florence, a horrid boy! What will we do with him? I can't run, and boys despise dolls. As for talking, I never could talk to boys. They shut me up like a clam. I always feel as if they wanted to get away, and I believe they would if they could,\" said Dimple in a disgusted tone.  But, by this time, Mrs. Dallas had come up to them.  \"This is Rock Hardy, girls,\" said she. \"As Dimple is a little lame, I brought him out here, rather than take her in the house,\" and so saying, she left them. There was a deep silence after they had shaken hands; all looking rather bashful for a few minutes.  Finally Rock took courage to say, \"What pretty dolls.\"  This was encouraging; Florence and Dimple exchanged pleased glances.  \"Do you think they are pretty?\" asked Dimple. \"I thought boys hated dolls.\"  \"I don't,\" said Rock. \"I played with them myself for a long time, and I have one now, but I don't play with it because I like to read better.\"  \"He _is_ a nice boy,\" thought the girls.  \"How funny,\" said Florence. \"How came you to play with dolls?\"  \"Why, you see, I haven't any brothers and sisters. When I was a little fellow I used to get so lonely, that my mother dressed a boy doll for me, and I talked to it and pretended it was another boy.\"  \"I haven't any brothers, or sisters either,\" said Dimple, \"but Florence has. I have Bubbles, though. Everybody can't have a Bubbles; she is next best to a sister, or a cousin.\"  \"Who is Bubbles?\" asked Rock.  \"She is the little colored girl you saw when you came out of the house; she has lived here ever since I was a baby; she is a year older than I am; her mother ran off and left her, and she is real nice to play with.\"  Dimple was fast getting over her embarrassment.  \"Don't you go to school?\" asked Rock.  \"No, mamma has always taught me at home, but I am going next year. It is vacation now.\"  \"Yes, I know,\" said Rock, \"that is why we came here. We are going to stay for some time. I like to play with girls. Will you let me come and play with you sometimes?\"  \"Yes, indeed,\" said Dimple, in her warm-hearted way. \"My foot is nearly well, and I can soon run about. I think I should like to play with a nice boy.\"  \"I hope I'm a nice boy,\" said Rock, \"but I don't know. I suppose everybody is mean sometimes.\"  \"I think you look nice,\" said Dimple, honestly, looking at him from head to foot.  \"Why don't you say something, Florence?\"  Florence thus appealed to, could say nothing.  \"Florence is my cousin,\" said Dimple. \"She lives in Baltimore and she came here yesterday.\"  \"Why, I live in Baltimore,\" said Rock. \"What street do you live on, Florence?\"  Florence told him, and they found it was in the next street to that on which Rock lived, so they all began to feel like old friends.  \"If I had my scroll saw here, I could make you each a chair for your dolls,\" said Rock. \"Maybe my mother will let me send for it. I will ask her.\"  \"Oh, that would be lovely,\" said the girls.  \"And I will lend you some of my books to read,\" said Dimple. \"If you will please hand me that little cane, we will go in and you can choose them.\"  \"Oh, thank you,\" said Rock. \"I shall like to have them, for I like to read better than to do anything else.\"  They all went in and found Rock's mother and Mrs. Dallas in the parlor.  Dimple told her mamma what they had come for, and her mamma suggested her taking Rock into the library first, as he might find something there that he liked.  So Rock was taken to the bookcase, and found there a book of travels he had been wanting to read, so he bade them good-bye, with it under his arm, promising soon to come again.  Then Dimple and Florence returned to the garden where they had left a colony of grasshoppers imprisoned in a small house built for them out of bits of wood and bark.  \"Baby Grasshopper has gone,\" said Florence, in dismay, as she peeped in to see the prisoners.  \"I knew he would get out; he was so little,\" returned Dimple. \"Let's set them all free, Florence. We'll pretend that they escaped in the night, or that peace has been declared.\"  \"Or that a tornado blew down their prison.\"  \"Yes, that will be the best. We'll blow real hard, and maybe it will come down.\"  So, with cheeks much puffed out they blew and blew, but without avail, and finally they picked up their hats and fanned the little bark structure so vigorously that it toppled over, and the grasshoppers escaped in every direction, the children laughing to see how quickly they disappeared.  They sat there in the grass wondering what to do next when Dimple exclaimed, \"There comes papa with Mr. Coulter,--he's the carpenter, you know--I wonder what he is going to do. See, Mr. Coulter is measuring the ground, and papa is explaining something. I can tell by the way he keeps doing so, with his hand. He always does that when he is explaining. Help me up, Florence, and let's go over there and see what's going on. Papa must mean to have something built. I hope it isn't a fence. No, it can't be that, for it would be too near the other one. Isn't it funny to watch men talking? They do so many funny things. Mr. Coulter keeps nodding his head like a horse.\"  Florence laughed and they made their way over to where the two men stood. As soon as they were within speaking distance, Dimple began to put her questions. \"Are you going to build something, papa? What is it? Please don't say it's a fence, or a--a pig-sty.\"  Mr. Coulter chuckled as he went on laying his foot-rule along the ground.  \"I hope it won't turn into a pig-sty,\" Mr. Dallas replied, with a smile. \"It won't unless little pigs get into it.\"  \"Are you going to keep little pigs?\" Dimple asked.  \"I didn't say so.\"  \"Oh, papa, you are so mystiferious. I wish you would tell us all about it. What are you going to build? Any sort of house?\"  \"Yes, one sort of house.\"  \"What is it to be for?\"  \"Little chicks.\"  \"Ah!\" Dimple was quite satisfied. \"I see. You need a new hen house. Isn't the old one big enough? To be sure we don't get very many eggs just now, for so many of the hens are sitting. Oh, I know, maybe you are going to build a place like Mr. Lind's, with a--what is that thing? A inkybator. Are you going to have one of those? and a brooder? Are you, papa?\"  \"I haven't decided exactly what is to be in it, just yet. I think we'll let mamma see to that--she knows best what is "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19029"],["title","The Gifts of Asti (#1)"],["body","kness. But the sun of Asti lighted their way and perhaps some virtue in the rays from it kept away the makers of such trails.  When they pulled themselves up onto a wide ledge the talons on Varta's gloves were worn to splintered stubs and there was a bright girdle of pain about her aching body. Lur lay panting beside her, his red-forked tongue protruding from his foam ringed mouth.  \"We walk again the ways of men,\" Lur was the first to note the tool marks on the stone where they lay. \"By the Will of Asti, we may win out of this maze after all.\"  Since there were no signs of the deadly steam Varta dared to push off her hood and share with her companion the sustaining power she carried in her pouch. There was a freshness to the air they breathed, damp and cold though it was, which hinted of the upper world.  The ledge sloped upwards, at a steep angle at first, and then more gently. Lur slipped past her and thrust head and shoulders through a break in the rock. Grasping his neck spines she allowed him to pull her through that narrow slit into the soft blackness of a surface night. They tumbled down together, Varta's head pillowed on Lur's smooth side, and so slept as the sun and worlds of Asti whirled protectingly above them.  A whir of wings in the air above her head awakened Varta. One of the small, jewel bright flying lizard creatures of the deep jungle poised and dipped to investigate more closely the worlds of Asti. But at Varta's upflung arm it uttered a rasping cry and planed down into the mass of vegetation below. By the glint of sunlight on the stone around them the day was already well advanced. Varta tugged at Lur's mane until he roused.  There was a regularity to the rocks piled about their sleeping place which hinted that they had lain among the ruins left by man. But of this side of the mountains both were ignorant, for Memphir's rule had not run here.  \"Many dead things in times past,\" Lur's scarlet nostril pits were extended to their widest. \"But that was long ago. This land is no longer held by men.\"  Varta laughed cheerfully. \"If here there are no men, then there will rise no barbarian hordes to dispute our rule. Asti has led us to safety. Let us see more of the land He gives us.\"  There was a road leading down from the ruins, a road still to be followed in spite of the lash of landslip and the crack of time. And it brought them into a cup of green fertility where the lavishness of Asti's sowing was unchecked by man. Varta seized eagerly upon globes of blood red fruit which she recognized as delicacies which had been cultivated in the Temple gardens, while Lur went hunting into the fringes of the jungle, there dining on prey so easily caught as to be judged devoid of fear.  The jungle choked highway curved and they were suddenly fronted by a desert of sere desolation, a desert floored by glassy slag which sent back the sun beams in a furnace glare. Varta shaded her eyes and tried to see the end of this, but, if there was a distant rim of green beyond, the heat distortions in the air concealed it.  Lur put out a front paw to test the slag but withdrew it instantly.  \"It cooks the flesh, we can not walk here,\" was his verdict.  Varta pointed with her chin to the left where, some distance away, the mountain wall paralleled their course.  \"Then let us keep to the jungle over there and see if it does not bring around to the far side. But what made this--?\" She leaned out over the glassy stuff, not daring to touch the slick surface.  \"War.\" Lur's tongue shot out to impale a questing beetle. \"These forgotten people fought with fearsome weapons.\"  \"But what weapon could do this? Memphir knew not such--.\"  \"Memphir was old. But mayhap there were those who raised cities on Erb before the first hut of Memphir squatted on tidal mud. Men forget knowledge in time. Even in Memphir the lords of the last days forgot the wisdom of their earlier sages--they fell before the barbarians easily enough.\"  \"If ever men had wisdom to produce this--it was not of Asti's giving,\" she edged away from the glare. \"Let us go.\"  But now they had to fight their way through jungle and it was hard--until they reached a ridge of rock running out from the mountain as a tongue thrust into the blasted valley. And along this they picked their slow way.  \"There is water near--,\" Lur's thought answered the girl's desire. She licked dry lips longingly. \"This way--,\" her companion's sudden turn was to the left and Varta was quick to follow him down a slide of rock.  Lur's instinct was right, as it ever was. There was water before them, a small lake of it. But even as he dipped his fanged muzzle toward that inviting surface, Lur's spined head jerked erect again. Varta snatched back the hand she had put out, staring at Lur's strange actions. His nostrils expanded to their widest, his long neck outstretched, he was swinging his head back and forth across the limpid shallows.  \"What is it--?\"  \"This is no water such as we know,\" the scaled one answered flatly. \"It has life within it.\"  Varta laughed. \"Fish, water snakes, your own distant kin, Lur. It is the scent of them which you catch--\"  \"No. It is the water itself which lives--and yet does not live--\" His thought trailed away from her as he struggled with some problem. No human brain could follow his unless he willed it so.  Varta squatted back on her heels and began to look at the water and then at the banks with more care. For the first time she noted the odd patches of brilliant color which floated just below the surface of the liquid. Blue, green, yellow, crimson, they drifted slowly with the tiny waves which lapped the shore. But they were not alive, she was almost sure of that, they appeared more a part of the water itself.  Watching the voyage of one patch of green she caught sight of the branch. It was a drooping shoot of the turbi, the same tree vine which produced the fruit she had relished less than an hour before. Above the water dangled a cluster of the fruit, dead ripe with the sweet pulp stretching its skin. But below the surface of the water--  Varta's breath hissed between her teeth and Lur's head snapped around as he caught her thought.  The branch below the water bore a perfect circle of green flowers close to its tip, the flowers which the turbi had borne naturally seven months before and which should long ago have turned into just such sweetness as hung above.  With Lur at her heels the girl edged around to pull cautiously at the branch. It yielded at once to her touch, swinging its tip out of the lake. She sniffed--there was a languid perfume in the air, the perfume of the blooming turbi. She examined the flowers closely, to all appearances they were perfect and natural.  \"It preserves,\" Lur settled back on his haunches and waved one front paw at the quiet water. \"What goes into it remains as it was just at the moment of entrance.\"  \"But if this is seven months old--\"  \"It may be seven years old,\" corrected Lur. \"How can you tell when that branch first dipped into the lake? Yet the flowers do not fade even when withdrawn from the water. This is indeed a mystery!\"  \"Of which I would know more!\" Varta dropped the turbi and started on around the edge of the lake.  Twice more they found similar evidence of preservation in flower or leaf, wherever it was covered by the opaline water.  The lake itself was a long and narrow slash with one end cutting into the desert of glass while the other wet the foot of the mountain. And it was there, on the slope of the mountain that they found the greatest wonder of all, Lur scenting it before they sighted the remains among the stones.  \"Man made,\" he cautioned, \"but very, very old.\"  And truly the wreckage they came upon must have been old, perhaps even older than Memphir. For the part which rested above the water was almost gone, rusty red stains on the rocks outlining where it had lain. But under water was a smooth silver hull, shining and untouched by the years. Varta laid her hand upon a ruddy scrap between two rocks and it became a drift of powdery dust. And yet--there a few feet below was strong metal!  Lur padded along the scrap of shore surveying the thing.  \"It was a machine in which men traveled,\" his thoughts arose to her. \"But they were not as the men of Memphir. Perhaps not even as the sons of Erb--\"  \"Not as the sons of Erb!\" her astonishment broke into open speech.  Lur's neck twisted as he looked up at her. \"Did the men of Erb, even in the old chronicles fight with weapons such as would make a desert of glass? There are other worlds than Erb, mayhap this strange thing was a sky ship from such a world. All things are possible by the Will of Asti.\"  Varta nodded. \"All things are possible by the Will of Asti,\" she repeated. \"But, Lur,\" her eyes were round with wonder, \"perhaps it is Asti's Will which brought us here to find this marvel! Perhaps He has some use for us and it!\"  \"At least we may discover what lies within it,\" Lur had his own share of curiosity.  \"How? The two of us can not draw that out of the water!\"  \"No, but we can enter into it!\"  Varta fingered the folds of the hood on her shoulders. She knew what Lur meant, the suit which had protected her in the underworld was impervious to everything outside its surface--or to every substance its makers knew--just as Lur's own hide made his flesh impenetrable. But the fashioners of her suit had probably never known of the living lake and what if she had no defense against the strange properties of the water?  She leaned back against a rock. Overhead the worlds and sun of Asti still traveled their appointed paths. The worlds of Asti! If it was His Will which had brought them here, then Asti's power would wrap her round with safety. By His Will she had come out of Memphir over ways no human of Erb had ever trod before. Could she doubt that His Protection was with her now?  It took only a moment to make secure the webbed shoes, to pull on and fasten the hood, to"]]]
