Thorne rose sullenly, and without a word strode toward the large, square building, with an extended wing, which was used for the boarding-school.  Little Cameron seized Jasper's hand and kissed it.  \"How brave you are!\" he said. \"How much I thank you!\"  \"Oh, it's nothing,\" said Jasper, modestly. \"You just send for me when you're in trouble, Cameron. I won't let him hurt you.\"     CHAPTER II.  STRANGE NEWS.   Entering the house, Thorne reported at the doctor's study. His flushed appearance attracted the teacher's attention.  \"What's the matter, Thorne?\" he asked.  \"The new boy pitched into me and I licked him,\" said Thorne.  But his sullen manner was so unlike that of a victor that the doctor shrewdly suspected that his statement was not wholly correct.  \"What was the quarrel about?\" he asked.  \"We were playing ball,\" said Thorne, evasively.  \"I will inquire into it. At present you are wanted in the parlor.\"  So Thorne left the presence of the principal and entered the opposite room. A lady, seated on a sofa, arose quickly, and advanced to meet him. She kissed the boy's cheek, to which he submitted without manifesting any responsive feeling.  \"How long it is since I saw you, Nicholas, my dear boy!\" she said.  \"It's only about six months,\" said Nicholas, stolidly.  \"And are not six months long for a mother to be separated from her only child?\" said the lady, tenderly.  \"It doesn't seem so long,\" said Nicholas.  The lady looked pained, but she proceeded:  \"How you have grown!\"  \"Yes, I've grown,\" said Nicholas, showing a little pleasure now. \"I think I shall be a large man.\"  \"Like your father. And how are you improving in your studies, Nicholas?\"  \"Oh! I'm doing well enough,\" said the boy, indifferently, for Nicholas Thorne's taste for study was very moderate. \"Did you bring me any money, mother?\"  \"You have your regular allowance, Nicholas.\"  \"It isn't enough. What's a dollar a week?\"  \"It is a good deal for me to pay,\" said his mother. \"Remember, I have to pay your school bills, and my means are but small.\"  \"A dollar a week is very small for a boy of my age,\" grumbled Thorne. \"Why, some of the little boys get more; and there's that new boy, Jasper Kent, gets five dollars, so they say.\"  The lady betrayed strong interest at the sound of his name.  \"I forgot,\" she said. \"So Jasper Kent has arrived, has he?\"  \"What, mother, do you know him?\" demanded Thorne, surprised in turn.  \"Yea, I know him. What do you think of him?\"  \"Think of him? I hate him!\" said Thorne, fiercely.  \"Why?\"  \"He tries to bully me.\"  \"And you permit it? Why, you are larger than he.\"  \"Yes, but he knows how to fight.\"  \"How do you know?\"  \"I had a fight with him this morning,\" said Nicholas.  \"Did he come off best?\" asked the lady.  \"No,\" answered Nicholas, with hesitation. \"That is, we were only half through the fight when a boy ran up and said you had come. So we had to stop.\"  \"Humph! That is strange,\" said the lady, in a low voice, more to herself than to her son, \"this sudden antagonism.\"  \"What do you know about Kent?\" demanded Nicholas, his curiosity aroused.  \"Perhaps I may as well tell you,\" said his mother, thoughtfully, \"but I wish you to keep the matter secret from him.\"  \"You won't catch me telling him anything, except that he is a scoundrel!\" muttered Nicholas.  \"Then sit down by me, and I will tell you much that you do not know, but ought now to hear. Is the door shut?\"  \"Yes.\"  \"Go and see. It is important that no one should overhear us.\"  Nicholas complied with her request.  \"It's shut fast enough,\" he said. \"Now what have you got to tell me?\"  \"To begin with, do you know where I get the money I pay for your schooling and clothes?\"  \"My father left you some money, didn't he?\"  \"He left me a small property which rents for two hundred dollars a year.\"  \"You pay three hundred a year for me, don't you?\"  \"For your school bills, yes. Besides, I give you an allowance and buy your clothes.\"  \"How do you do it?\" asked Nicholas, in surprise. \"Have you sold the house?\"  \"No. If I should do that, there would soon be nothing left. That was the problem I had to solve three years ago, when your father died.\"  \"What did you do?\"  \"I felt that the property must not be touched, save the income. I saw that it was necessary for me to exert myself, or I should be unable to educate you as I desired. I had a good education, and I determined to avail myself of it. I therefore went to a teacher's agency in New York and set forth my desire to obtain the position of governess in some family in the country.\"  \"You a governess!\"  \"Why not? It was the only way I could think of that would yield me an income. After waiting a few weeks I succeeded. A wealthy gentleman, living in a country town of moderate size, saw my testimonials, was pleased with them, and engaged me to superintend the education of an orphan niece resident in his family. He offered me a fair salary--enough, added to the rent which I received from the property left me by your father, to justify me in putting you at this boarding-school. That was three years ago.\"  \"Why didn't you tell me all this before, mother?\"  \"It would have done no good. I preferred that you should think of me as possessing an independent property. I felt that it would enable you the better to hold up your head among your school-fellows, as they could know nothing of your antecedents.\"  \"Does Dr. Benton know this?\" asked Nicholas, quickly.  \"No; he only knows that I am a widow, He supposes that I have sufficient means.\"  \"I am glad of that.\"  \"Would it make any difference with him?\"  \"I don't know. Any way, I'd rather he wouldn't know it.\"  Nicholas Thorne sat by his mother's side thoughtful. He was disappointed to think that his mother's means were so limited, since it curtailed his future expectations. The thought of that mother working patiently to defray his expenses at school made comparatively little impression. He was essentially selfish, and, so long as his wants were provided for, he cared little who labored for him.  \"You don't ask the name of the man who employs me,\" said his mother.  Nicholas looked up.  \"I suppose it is nobody I ever heard of,\" he said.  \"No, you never heard of him, but you know some one connected with him.\"  \"What do you mean?\" asked the boy, his curiosity aroused.  \"The gentleman who employs me is father of one of your schoolmates.\"  \"Father of one of my school-mates?\"  \"Yes.\"  \"Who is it? Why don't you tell me, mother?\"  \"You have spoken of him to me this morning. It is Jasper Kent.\"  \"You work for Jasper Kent's father!\" exclaimed Nicholas in unbounded astonishment. \"Does he know it?\"  \"Yes, he knows that I am, or have been, governess in his father's family. But he knows nothing of my connection with you.\"  \"If he knew, he'd taunt me with my mother's being obliged to work for a living,\" said Thorne.  \"I don't think he would. At any rate, the time is coming very soon when he will have no advantage over you.\"  \"How do you make that out, mother?\"  \"Listen, and keep secret what I tell you. Next week I become his father's wife.\"  \"You marry Jasper Kent's father!\"  \"Yes; I shall be Jasper's step-mother.\"  \"Is old Kent rich?\" asked Nicholas, eagerly.  His mother nodded.  \"Yes, he is rich; that is, for the country. He is in poor health, too,\" she added, significantly.  \"Good!\" said Nicholas, with satisfaction. \"You know how to play your cards, mother.\"  The mother smiled.  \"My days of dependence are drawing to an end,\" she said. \"Some time I can do better for you than I am doing now.\"     CHAPTER III.  JASPER RECOGNIZES THE VISITOR.   \"Will the old man do anything for me after he marries you, mother?\" asked Nicholas, who never failed to look out for his own interests.  \"He doesn't know you are in existence, Nicholas.\"  \"Did you never speak to him of me?\"  \"No; I didn't dare to tell him.\"  \"Why not?\"  \"It might prevent his marrying me.\"  \"It seems to me,\" grumbled Nicholas, \"you only thought of yourself. You didn't care what became of me.\"  \"That is unjust, Nicholas. You must see that it is. Once we are married I shall have more control of money, and if Mr. Kent dies I shall be entitled to a third of his property.\"  \"I wish he'd leave you the whole, and cut off that upstart Jasper,\" said Nicholas, frowning.  \"There is not much chance of that. He thinks everything of Jasper. However, I don't think he'll live long, and I shall induce him, if possible, to name me as Jasper's guardian.\"  \"That would be a good job for you, mother--not so good for Jasper, I'm thinking.\"  \"You are right, Nicholas. Did you say you disliked him?\"  \"Yes, I hate him.\"  \"So do I,\" said his mother in a low tone, but one of intense energy.  \"Why?\" asked Thorne, in some curiosity.  \"I'll tell you. From my entrance into his father's family he has never treated me with any cordiality. Evidently he didn't like me. I think, indeed, he mistrusted me, though I never gave occasion for any suspicions. If he should learn now that I am to marry his father, he would move heaven and earth to prevent the marriage.\"  \"Has he been home much since you were in the house?\"  \"No; he was at school elsewhere, and was only at home during his vacations.\"  \"How did he come to be sent here to this school? Did you advise it?\"  \"No; I was opposed to it, but Mr. Kent was recommended by a friend to send his son here. I did not venture to say much, lest I should be asked how I came to know anything of the school. I was afraid you and he would meet, and he would learn the connections between us.\"  \"I suppose you'll own up after the wedding, won't you?\"  \"I think not at once, Nicholas.\"  \"Why not?\"  \"Remember what I told you, that Mr. Kent is in poor health. He may not live six months. We can keep the matter secret for that"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19592"],["title","Frank and Fearless; or, The Fortunes of Jasper Kent (#2)"],["body","ime, can't we, Nicholas?\"  \"If you were only sure he would die in that time.\"  \"He has heart disease, and is liable to die at any time.\"  \"You want him to make his will first, and leave you guardian?\"  \"Of course.\"  \"After that you wouldn't mourn very much for his loss?\"  \"No; I don't pretend to care for him.\"  \"He thinks you do, eh, mother?\"  \"Of course.\"  \"Oh, you're a deep one, you are,\" said Nicholas, winking in a way to indicate his shrewd insight into his mother's motives.  \"I have to be, Nicholas. There's no getting on in this world without it. But I think I shall have to leave you now.\"  \"Then you don't mean to invite me to the wedding, mother?\"  \"It will be a private ceremony.\"  \"Will Jasper be invited?\"  \"His father was anxious to have him at home. Indeed, I have had a great deal of trouble to prevent his sending for him, but at length I have succeeded. I know too well the danger. The boy has a great influence over his father, whose mind is weakened with his body, and I should be afraid that the match would be broken off even at the last moment if the boy got wind of our plan.\"  \"How mad Jasper will be when he hears of it!\" said Thorne, laughing with malicious enjoyment. \"I wish I could tell him.\"  \"Don't breathe a word of it, Nicholas,\" said his mother, in evident alarm.  \"Oh, I'll keep the secret. But it won't do any harm when it's all over, will it?\"  \"Say nothing till I authorize it.\"  \"Well, I won't, then, if I can help it. But I say, mother, the old gentleman will come down handsomely when you're married. You ought to raise my allowance to two dollars a week.\"  \"I will if I can afford it,\" said his mother. \"But I must leave you now, Nicholas. I shall have about time to go to the station and meet the next train.\"  \"Shan't I go with you?\"  \"I should like your company, my dear boy, but we must be prudent. We might meet Jasper Kent.\"  \"That's so. Well, good-bye.\"  \"Good-bye, Nicholas,\" and his mother pressed her lips upon the cheek of her son.  He tolerated the kiss, but did not return it. His heart was not very impressible, and he cared for no one except himself.  \"I won't stop to see Dr. Benton,\" she said, at parting. \"You may tell him that I was in haste.\"  \"All right.\"  Mrs. Thorne emerged from the parlor and from the house. She was tall and erect in figure, and walked rapidly. Her face was concealed by a thick veil, but, for the information of the reader it may be described as narrow and long, with small eyes, like those of Nicholas, and thin, tightly-compressed lips. She was not a woman to yield to misfortune or give way to sentimental sorrow. She looked rather like one who knew how to face fortune and defy it. It was not a pleasant face, but it was decidedly a strong one.  The grounds of the school were extensive, and the house stood back two or three hundred yards from the street. A long avenue led from the house to the main thoroughfare.  Mrs. Thorne looked hurriedly about her as she went out on her way.  \"I shouldn't like to meet Jasper Kent,\" she said to herself. \"It might lead to unpleasant questions and suspicions on his part, and I don't want anything to happen before I am married.\"  It seemed likely that she would escape the encounter which she dreaded. Had there been no interruption or delay she would have done so; but it was not so to be. She met Dr. Benton in front of the house, and was compelled to stop and speak to him.  \"You find Nicholas well?\" he said, politely.  \"Oh, yes, doctor,\" she answered, softly. \"I have no anxiety on that subject, as long as he is under your care. I know that he cannot fail to do well.\"  We all like flattery, and the learned principal was not proof against it.  \"Ahem! Mrs. Thorne,\" he said, pompously, \"we try to do our duty by the young people intrusted to our charge. We do not limit our endeavors to their mental culture, but strive to promote their physical well-being also.\"  \"And you succeed remarkably well, Dr. Benton. But you must excuse my leaving you abruptly. I wish to catch the next train.\"  \"I hope we shall see you again soon, madam,\" said the doctor, politely.  \"I shall endeavor to call again before many weeks, Dr. Benton. Good-morning.\"  \"Good-morning, madam.\"  Mrs. Thorne adjusted her veil and swiftly resumed her course. Her heart gave a bound when, just outside the gate, she espied the well-known figure of Jasper Kent.  \"I hope he won't recognize me,\" she thought  But she forgot her peculiar gait, and the quick, rapid step, which were likely to identify her in the eyes of anyone who had seen her often. Jasper Kent's attention was drawn to her, and he observed these peculiarities.  \"By Jove!\" he said to himself, \"she walks just like the governess.\"  Still, having no reason to suspect the presence of Miss Thorne, as he called her, at the school, he would have thought the resemblance only accidental, but for a whiff of wind which blew the veil aside from her face. That face there was no mistaking.  \"Miss Thorne!\" he exclaimed, in surprise, advancing to meet her.  She was exceedingly vexed, but it would not do to betray it.  \"Jasper!\" she said, with a smile. \"You didn't expect to see me here?\"  \"No; did you come to see me? Is my father unwell?\" he asked, anxiously.  \"Your father is quite well.\"  \"Then--\"  \"Why have I come? I see that is what you wish to ask. I have not come on your account at all. I came to see a nephew of my own.\"  \"At this school?\"  \"Yes.\"  \"You must mean Nicholas Thorne.\"  \"Yes; do you know him?\"  \"A little,\" said Jasper, with reserve.  \"Poor fellow! He has neither father nor mother to look after him, only myself. I am his only relative living.\"  \"I never heard you speak of him before.\"  \"No; I have not cared to intrude my private concerns upon your father or yourself. But I must hurry, or I shall be late at the station. Have you any message to send to your father?\"  \"Give him my love, and tell him to take care of his health for my sake.\"  \"I hope he will do that for all our sakes,\" said the lady, with affected warmth. \"Good-bye.\"  \"Good-bye.\"  Jasper Kent looked after her as she walked rapidly away.  \"Why is it that I distrust her so much?\" he thought to himself. \"So she is Thorne's aunt. Well, he is not a relation to be proud of.\"  \"How vexatious that I should meet him,\" thought Mrs. Thorne. \"I ought not to have run the risk of coming. If he tells Nicholas that I have admitted a relationship it may do harm. Once the wedding is over I shall feel more secure.\"     CHAPTER IV.  THORNE'S REVENGE.   The unexpected communication which Thorne had received from his mother influenced his treatment of Jasper. Under ordinary circumstances he would have resented bitterly the humiliating defeat he had received at the hands of the \"new boy.\" Now, however, he felt sure of ultimate revenge, and was willing to \"bide his time.\"  \"Just wait till his father is dead, and mother is his guardian!\" he said to himself. \"Then, my young gentleman, your pride'll be taken down, see if it ain't!\"  His politic forbearance surprised the other boys, who did not understand the secret cause.  \"Ain't you goin' to lick that new boy?\" asked Tower, a sycophantic follower of Thorne.  \"What for?\" asked Nicholas.  \"Because he licked you the other day.\"  \"Who says he licked me?\" demanded the young tyrant, with a frown.  \"Why, all the boys say so,\" stammered Tower.  \"Do you say so?\" demanded Nicholas, savagely.  \"N-no,\" said Tower, timidly.  \"Lucky you don't,\" said Thorne, significantly. \"I'll lick any boy that tells such a lie about me.\"  Tower was silent.  \"The fact is,\" he continued, in a milder tone, \"we were stopped in the middle of the fight. I was called to see a lady visitor. But for that I should have licked him in the end.\"  \"I guess you can lick him,\" said the young sycophant.  \"Of course I can,\" said Nicholas, loftily.  \"Are you going to try it?\"  \"Why should I? I haven't anything against him. We came out even. What's the use of bearing malice?\"  Tower was astonished to hear such sentiments from Thorne. It did not sound at all like him. He was about the last boy who would be singled out for forbearance or forgiveness of injuries. So the younger boy concluded that his leader was afraid of Jasper. But here he did him wrong. Thorne had learned to respect his adversary's strength and skill, but he would have hazarded a second encounter but for the prudential reasons already suggested. For the present he thought it best to keep quiet.  Jasper also had made a discovery, though, as we know, the information he had received was not correct. He supposed Thorne to be a nephew of his father's governess, whereas she was his mother.  \"Does Thorne know this?\" he asked himself.  He could not feel quite satisfied on this point, nor could he determine precisely how far his feelings were affected by this discovery. He felt a dislike toward Thorne on account of his tyrannical disposition and ill-treatment of younger boys. He cherished a dislike for the governess, the cause of which he could not as well define. Now, it appeared that these two were allied to each other. I beg to say that Jasper was too sensible and gentlemanly to dislike the governess simply because she was poor. That he knew very well had nothing to do with the substantial worth of a person. But he could not rid himself of the feeling that Miss Thorne's residence in his father's family portended misfortune to the parent whom he loved so well.  So a week passed without any new disturbance or outbreak between the two boys. Jasper had been on the lookout, fearing that Thorne would take some opportunity to wreak vengeance on young Cameron when he was not present. But his fears were gradually allayed. Thorne seemed usually peaceable--so much so that his school-mates, who knew him well, thought he had turned over a new leaf, and speculated as to what had produced the change. But neither boys nor men change suddenly and completely, though policy and self-interest may for a time lead them to suppress the"]]]
