One nice young woman browt him a cheer to sit on, but he darn't ventur 'on it, for it lukt as if it wor made o' black sealin wax, but Hepsabah flopt daan on it as if shoo'd been used to sittin o' sich articles all her life. Sammywell whispered to her to be as sharp as shoo could, an stood watchin what wor gooin on. Then th' young woman coom agean wi her armful o' what lukt to be flaars an feathers an ribbins all jumbled in a lump, but which proved to be what they called hats, an as shoo put furst one an then another on to Hepsabah, he wor fairly surprised to discover what a bonny lukkin woman his dowter wor; an when shoo axt him which he liked best, he could nobbut say, \"onny on em! suit thisen, lass!\" an th' young woman smiled at him an sed, \"It's nice when a gentleman likes to see his wife well dressed,\" an Sammywell blushed an sed \"Hem! hem!\" but didn't undeceive her. After tryin on abaat a scoor, nooan seemin to exactly suit Hepsabah, th' young woman browt another, an Sammywell's e'en fairly sparkled. \"By th' heart!\" he sed, \"but that's what aw call a Bobby Dazzler!\" an it wor plain to be seen at Hepsabah thowt soa too. \"Aw should like it,\" shoo sed, \"but awm feeared it'll cost a lot.\"  \"Tha's nowt to do wi that. It's me at's to pay for it!\" soa in a few minnits it wor packt in a box, an handed to her, an Sammywell tell'd her to tak it an get aghtside an wait for him an he'd bi wi her as sooin as he'd sattled for it. Hepsabah's face wor all smiles, tho' ther wor just a glisten o' tears in her een as shoo went away.  \"An nah, young woman,\" sed Sammywell, as he held his purse in his hand, \"ha mich do yo want?\"  Shoo handed him th' bill, but he seemed as if he couldn't mak it aght, soa he put on his spectacles. \"This is a mistak, Miss,\" he sed, \"aw've nobbut agreed to pay for one.\"  \"That's quite right, sir,\" shoo sed, \"One hat,--twenty two and six.\"  \"Twenty two fiddlesticks!\"  \"No, sir, twenty two shillings and six pence. That's not much for a gentleman to pay for his wife's hat.\"  \"But shoo isn't mi wife! Shoo's nobbut mi dowter!\"  \"No one would think you had a daughter so old;--you must have married very young,\" sed th' young woman smilin at him in a way at made him feel funny all ovver.  He sed noa moor but handed her two soverins; shoo gave him his change, an he made th' best ov his way into th' street where Hepsabah wor waitin for him; then he lained his back agean a lamp-pooast as if he wor too waik to stand.  \"Do yo feel sick, father?\" sed Hepsabah.  \"Eeah, aw think aw've getten a bit ov a sickener.\"  \"It wor varry warm i' that shop.\"  \"Eeah,--its th' hottest shop aw've ivver been in.\"  \"Yo see, yo arn't used to buyin hats.\"  \"Noa, an awm net likely to get used to it. Aw hooap thar't suited.\"  \"O, father,--its a beauty! If aw can nobbut get my chap to buy me a costume to match it!\"  \"Tha'll nivver do that, Hepsabah, becoss he connot. If he'd to buy thee a costoom, as tha calls it, to match that, an pay for it at th' same rate as aw've paid for that hat, it ud cost him aboon a thaasand paand! What does to think it's cost me?\"  \"Aw can't guess.\"  \"Twenty two shillin an sixpence! That's true whether tha believes it or net.\"  \"Is that all! Why its as cheap as muck.\"  \"Well, mak th' best on it, for tha'll get noa moor muck at th' same price aght o' me. But promise me at tha'll nivver tell thi mother! If shoo'd to get to know shoo wodn't be able to sleep for a wick. It's a scandlus shame, an aw've been swindled! Why, tha owt to ha getten a hat as big as a umbrella for that price.\"  \"Well, if yo hadn't wanted me to have it yo shouldn't ha sed soa.\"  \"Aw did want thi to have it, but it's price aw connot get ovver. Why it weighs nowt hardly. Its cost aboon five shillin an aance. Thee goa in an show it to thi mother an aw'll goa an get summat to steady mi narves.\"  Sammywell tried to keep his spirits up wi puttin some spirits daan, but he couldn't manage it, an it wor wi fear an tremblin at he lifted th' sneck when he went hooam. All lukt breet an cheerful an th' supper wor on th' table, an Mally's face showed noa sign o' ill temper. \"Thank gooidness,\" he sed to hissen, \"shoo hasn't been upstairs to caant th' brass yet.\"  \"Come thi ways to thi supper, Sammywell, aw wor gettin uneasy abaat thi.\"  \"Has Hepsabah been?\" he axt.  \"Eeah. An shoo's shown me her new hat, an aw must say aw didn't gie thi credit for havin sich gooid taste. Shoo's famously suited, an awm pleeased to think tha's acted as a father should act for once. Aw do believe if tha could nobbut live long enuff aw should be able to mak a daycent chap on thi at th' finish.\"  \"Did shoo say owt abaght what it cost?\"  \"Nay shoo didn't, an aw nivver axt her, for aw know tha'd nooan be likely to give mich; but if aw thowt aw could get one like it for owt under five an twenty shillin awd be after one i'th mornin.\"  \"Well, but tha connot,--for ther's nivver been but one made o' that pattern.\"  \"Ther'd happen be one ov another pattern to suit me.\"  \"Ther's noa moor ov onny sooart whativver; for th' chap at keeps that shop is gooin to retire from business to-neet an start a bank i'th mornin,--an noa wonder.\"  \"Onnybody'd think to listen to thi at tha didn't thoil it. Aw know ha mich brass tha tuk wi thi an if tha's spent it all, what bi that! Tha doesn't buy thi dowter a hat ivvery wick! an its far cheaper to buy a daycent article nor to squander yor brass on a lot o' rubbish. Shoo's varry careful ov her clooas is Hepsabah, an tha'll see it'll ha lasted weel bi th' time tha gooas to buy her another.\"  \"That's a moral sartainty. If that hat lasts her wol aw buy her another it'll last a long time.\"  \"Say noa moor abaat it. Tha's suited us an if tha hasn't suited thisen its thi own fault. Aw thowt tha desarved a bit ov a treeat soa aw fotched thi a drop o' thi favourite, an if tha doesn't want it all thisen aw dooant mind havin a drop.\"  \"That's all reight, Mally, an awm glad tha'rt soa thowtful, but aw connot help thinkin tha'rt a varry inconsistent woman.\"  \"Nah then! If tha'rt gooin to start callin me names aw willn't have a drop!\"  \"Aw dooant want to call thi names, but facts are stubborn things. If aw happen to goa an get two-penoth into mi heead tha praiches at me for a full clockhaar abaat th' sin ov extravagance an th' blessins ov economy; but awr Hepsabah can wear a hat at's cost as mich as aw could buy a distillary for, an that's all reight.\"  \"If tha bowt a distillery, Sammywell, nawther thee nor it wod last as long as awr Hepsabah's hat, soa things are better as they are. Hand ovver what change tha's getten i' thi pocket an then sup up an let's get off to bed, an be thankful tha's getten a dowter to buy a hat for, an a wife at advises thee allus for th' best.\"  \"All reight, lass,--awm ready,--but aw connot for th' life o' me see what awr Hepsabah's hat has to do wi young wimmen darnin ther stockins an weshin ther shifts.\"  \"A'a, Sammywell! Ther's a deeal o' things abaat wimmen at tha has to leearn yet.\"  \"Aw believe there is,--but twenty two an sixpence a lesson is a trifle aboon my cut.\"     Old Dave to th' New Parson.   \"Soa, yo're th' new parson, are yo?    Well, awm fain to see yo've come; Yo'll feel a trifle strange at furst,    But mak yorsen at hooam.  Aw hooap yo'll think nor war o' me,    If aw tell what's in mi noddle, Remember, if we dooant agree,    It's but an old man's twaddle.  But aw might happen drop a hint,    'At may start yo to thinkin; Awd help yo if aw saw mi way,    An do it too, like winkin.  Awm net mich up o' parsons,--    Ther's some daycent ens aw know; They're smart enuff at praichin,    But at practice they're too slow.  For dooin gooid nooan can deny    Ther chonces are mooast ample; If they'd give us fewer precepts,    An rayther moor example.  We need a friend to help waik sheep,    Oe'r life's rough ruts an boulders;-- Ther's a big responsibility    Rests on a parson's shoulders.  But oft ther labor's all in vain,    Noa matter ha persistent; Becoss ther taichin an ther lives    Are hardly quite consistent.  Ther's nowt can shake ther faith in God,    When bad is growing worse; An nowt abate ther trust, unless    It chonce to touch ther purse.  They say, \"Who giveth to the poor,    Lends to the Lord,\" but yet, They all seem varry anxious,    Net to get the Lord in debt.  But wi my fooilish nooations    Mayhap yo'll net agree,-- Its like enuff 'at awm mistaen,--    But it seems that way to me.

You can't expect it. All I can do for you is to couple your truck on to the commissariat train of your army corps. It will take you as far as the terminus, and there you must see what you can do.\"  I went back to my horses. After various excursions hither and thither which took up the whole morning I at last managed to get my horse-box coupled to the train. Wattrelot and I, together with the Territorial section that served as guard, were the only passengers. The whole train was composed of vans stuffed with food supplies and mysterious cases, packed into some separate vans carefully sealed. Our departure was fixed for two o'clock, and meanwhile I had a chat with the Territorial lieutenant who commanded our escort. I tried to find out from him what had happened at the Front. He did not know any more than I did, and merely told me how sorry he was for his own ill-luck: \"You know, our job is no joke. We start after luncheon, travel all the rest of the day and part of the night, sleep where we can, and the next day we go back again in the empty train. It takes still longer to get back. And the day after we begin all over again.\"  And the worthy man quietly folded his hands on the \"fair roundness\" of his figure. He looked a good sort of fellow. He did his job conscientiously; put his men into the third-class compartments assigned to them; saw that they had their cartridges, and gave them some fatherly counsel; and then he invited me into the second-class compartment reserved for him. But I declined, as I preferred to travel with my horses. The train jolted off. The heat was tropical. We had pushed our sliding-door wide open, and, seated on our packages, we contemplated the smiling summer landscape as it passed slowly before us. And I came to the conclusion that we had found out the pleasantest way of travelling:--to have a railway carriage to yourself, where you can stand up, walk about and lie down; to go at a pace that allows you to enjoy the scenery of the countries you pass through; and to be able to linger and admire such and such a view, such and such a country mansion or monument of olden days! That is a hundred times better than the shaking and rush of a _train de luxe_.  I was delighted and touched by the sympathetic interest shown in us by the people. Everywhere old men, women and children waved their handkerchiefs and called out, \"Good luck!... Good luck!\"  The worthy Territorials answered back as best they could. One felt that all hearts were possessed with one and the same thought, wish, and hope,--the hearts of the men who were going slowly up to battle, and those of the people who watched them pass and sent their good wishes with them.  At one station where we stopped a group of girls dressed in white were waiting on the platform under the burning rays of the sun. With simplicity, grace, and charming smiles they distributed chocolate, bread, and fruit to all the men. The good fellows were so touched that tears came to their eyes. One of them, an elderly man with a small grey pointed beard, could not help saying: \"But _we_ aren't going to fight, you know. We are only here to take care of the train.\"  \"That doesn't matter. That doesn't matter. Take it all the same. You are soldiers, like the others.... _Vive la France!_\" And all the thirty Territorials, in deep and solemn tones, repeated \"_Vive la France!_\"  What a change had come over these men who, people feared, were ripe for revolt, undisciplined, and reckless! What kindness and grace in the women who stay at home and suffer! An old railwayman said to me: \"It has been like that, Sir, from the first day of the mobilisation. These girls pass their days and nights at the station. It is really very good of them, for they won't make anything by it.\" The old working man was right: \"They won't make anything by it.\" And yet I am sure that many soldiers who have passed that station on their way to the Front will keep the same grateful remembrance that I still have. I shall never forget the group of girls in white on the sunny platform of the little station; I shall never forget the simple grace with which they prevailed upon the men to accept the good things they offered and even forced upon them. I thanked them as best I could, but awkwardly enough, trying to interpret the thoughts of all those soldiers. And when the train had started again on its panting course, I felt sorry I had not been more eloquent in my speech; that I had already forgotten the name of the little station, and never thought of asking the names of our benefactresses.  We were now getting near the fighting zone, and I already felt that there was a change in the state of mind of the people. They still called out to us: \"Good luck!... Good luck!\" But earlier in the day this greeting had been given with smiles and merry gestures; now it was uttered in a serious and solemn tone. At the station gates and the level crossings, the eyes of the women who looked at us were more sad and profound. They fixed themselves upon ours, and seemed to speak to us. And even when their lips did not move their eyes still said \"Good luck!... Good luck!\"  We saw motor cars rushing along the roads, and could distinguish the armbands on the men's sleeves, and rifles in the cars or lying in the hoods. And yet daily life was going on as usual. There were workers in the fields, tradespeople on the doorsteps of their shops, groups of peasants just outside the hamlets. But yet a peculiar state of mind was evident in each one of these people who were going on with their daily work. And all these accumulated cares, all these stirred imaginations, produced a strange atmosphere which infected everything, seemed to impregnate the air we breathed, and quenched the gaiety of the men in our train. Wattrelot and I were overcome by a kind of religious emotion; we felt as though we were already breathing the air of battle.  At about six o'clock we arrived at the station of L., where the train stopped for a few minutes. The platforms were crowded with Staff officers. A soldier assured me that the chief Headquarters were here. I wanted to question some one and try to get some authoritative information as to what was happening at the Front. It seemed to me that I had a right to know, now that I was on the point of becoming one of the actors in the tragedy in progress a few leagues off. But directly I came up to these officers I felt my assurance fail me. They looked disturbed and anxious. There was none of that merry animation that had reigned in the interior and that I had expected to find everywhere.  And then a strange and ridiculous fear came over me; the fear of being looked upon as an intruder by these well-informed men who knew everything. I imagined that they would spurn me with scorn, or that I should cause them pain by forcing them to tell me truths people do not like to repeat. It also occurred to me that I was too insignificant a person to confront men so high in office, and that I should appear importunate if I disturbed their reflections. But I was now quite sure that the official announcements had not told us all. Without having heard one word, I felt that things were not going so well as we had hoped, as every day in our little town in the west we tried passionately to divine the truth, devouring the few newspapers that reached us.  A pang shot through me. I now felt alone and lost amongst these men who seemed strangers to me. Crossing the rails, I got back to our train, drawn up at some distance from the platforms. The sun was on the horizon. In the red sky two monoplanes passed over our heads at no great height. The noise of their engines made everybody look up. They were flying north. And I felt a desire to rush upwards and overtake one of them and take my seat close to the pilot, behind the propeller which was spinning round and sending the wind of its giddy speed into his face. I longed to be able to lift myself into the air above the battlefields, and there, suspended in space, try to make out the movements of the clashing nations.  I resolved to have a talk with the engine-driver of a train returning to Paris empty. He told me in a few words that the French army was retreating rapidly, that it had already recrossed the Belgian frontier, and that at that moment it was fighting on French soil. He told me this simply, with a touch of sadness in his voice, shaking his head gently. He added no comments of his own, and I did not feel equal to any reply. Full of foreboding, I returned to my train and Wattrelot. He had heard what the engine-driver had told me, and he said not a word, but looked out into the distance at the fiery sky. We sat down side by side and said nothing.  So we were retreating. Then all our calculations and dreams were shattered. All the fine plans we officers had sketched out together were folly. We were wasting time when, bending over our maps, we foresaw a skilful advance on the heels of Belgium's invaders, followed by a huge victory, dearly bought, perhaps, but one that would upset the German Colossus at a single blow. The whole thing was an illusion. And I thought what a fool I had been. I thought of my regiment. How much of it was there left? How many of those good fellows were lying dead on foreign soil? How many friends should I never see again? For I imagined things to be worse than they really were. I felt absolutely despondent. What my mind conjured up was no longer a retreat in good order but a rout.  The train had begun to move again. The sun had set, and over the horizon there was but a streak of pale yellow sky lighting up the country. I sat down in the open doorway with my legs dangling outside, and as I breathed the first few whiffs of fresh air I felt somewhat relieved. The calm around was such as to make one forget that we were at war. Darkness came on by degrees.  Suddenly my heart began to beat faster,"]]]
