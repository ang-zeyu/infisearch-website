I think it might be as well if I explained a little of what's back of all this trouble. Want to listen? If you do, I'll try. And if I'm not making myself clear, ask all the questions you like.\"  There was a chorus of assent. Grenfel sat in the middle, the scouts ranged about him in a circle.  \"In the first place,\" he began, \"this Servian business is only an excuse. I'm not defending the Servians--I'm taking no sides between Servia and Austria. Here in England we don't care about that, because we know that if that hadn't started the war, something else would have been found.  \"England wants peace. And it seems that, every so often, she has to fight for it. It was so when the Duke of Marlborough won his battles at Blenheim and Ramillies and Malplaquet. Then France was the strongest nation in Europe. And she tried to crush the others and dominate everything. If she had, she would have been strong enough, after her victories, to fight us over here--to invade England. So we went into that war, more than two hundred years ago, not because we hated France, but to make a real peace possible. And it lasted a long time.  \"Then, after the French revolution, there was Napoleon. Again France, under him, was the strongest nation in Europe. He conquered Germany, and Austria, Italy and Spain, the Netherlands. And he tried to conquer England, so that France could rule the world. But Nelson beat his fleet at Trafalgar--\"  \"Hurrah!\" interrupted Dick, carried away. \"Three cheers for Nelson!\"  Grenfel smiled as the cheers were given.  \"Even after Trafalgar,\" he went on, \"Napoleon hoped to conquer England. He had massed a great army near Boulogne, ready to send it across the channel. And so we took the side of the weaker nations again. All Europe, led by England, rose against Napoleon. And you know what happened. He was beaten finally at Waterloo. And so there was peace again in Europe for a long time, with no one nation strong enough to dictate to all the others. But then Germany began to rise. She beat Austria, and that made her the strongest German country. Then she beat France, in 1870, and that gave her her start toward being the strongest nation on the continent.  \"And then, I believe--and so do most Englishmen--she began to be jealous of England. She wanted our colonies. She began, finally, to build a great navy. For years we have had to spend great sums of money to keep our fleet stronger than hers. And she made an alliance with Austria and Italy. Because of that France and Russia made an alliance, too, and we had to be friendly with them. And now it looks to me as if Germany thought she saw a chance to beat France and Russia. Perhaps she thinks that we won't fight, on account of the trouble in Ireland. And what we English fear is that, if she wins, she will take Belgium and Holland. Then she would be so close to our coasts that we would never be safe. We would have to be prepared always for invasion. So, you see, it seems to me that we are facing the same sort of danger we have faced before. Only this time it is Germany, instead of France, that we shall have to fight--if we do fight.\"  \"If the Germans go through Belgium, will that mean that we shall fight?\" asked Leslie Franklin.  \"Almost certainly, yes,\" said Grenfel. \"And it is through Belgium that Germany has her best chance to strike at France. So you see how serious things are. I don't want to go into all the history that is back of all this. I just want you to understand what England's interest is. If we make war, it will be a war of self-defence. Suppose you owned a house. And suppose the house next door caught fire. You would try to put out that fire, wouldn't you, to save your own house from being burned up? Well, that's England's position. If the Germans held Belgium or Holland--and they would hold both, if they beat France and Russia--England would then be in just as much danger as your house would be. So if we fight, it will be to put out the German fire in the house next door.  \"Now I want you to understand one thing. I'm talking as an Englishman. A German would tell you all this in a very different way. I don't like the people who are always slandering their enemies. Germany has her reasons for acting as she does. I think her reasons are wrong. But the Germans believe that they are right. We can respect even people who are wrong if they themselves believe that they are right. There may be two sides to this quarrel. And Germans, even if they are to be our enemies, may be just as patriotic, just as devoted to their country, as we are. Never forget that, no matter what may happen.\"  He stopped then, waiting for questions. None came.  \"Then you understand pretty well?\" he asked.  There was a murmur of assent from the whole circle.  \"All right, then,\" he said. \"Now there's work for Scouts to do. _Be prepared!_ That's our motto, isn't it? Suppose there's war. Franklin, what's your idea of what the Boy Scouts would be able to do?\"  \"I suppose those who are old enough could volunteer, sir,\" said Franklin, doubtfully. \"I can't think of anything else--\"  \"Time enough for that later,\" said Grenfel, with a short laugh. \"England may have to call boys to the colors before she's done, if she once starts to fight. But long before that time comes, there will be a great work for the organization we all love and honor. Work that won't be showy, work that will be very hard. Boys, everyone in England, man and woman and child will have work to do! And we, who are organized, and whose motto is _Be prepared_, ought to be able to show what stuff there is in us.  \"Think of all the places that must be guarded. The waterworks, the gas tanks, the railroads that lead to the seaports and that will be used by the troops.\"  A startled burst of exclamations answered him.  \"Why, there won't be any fighting in England, sir, will there?\" asked Dick Mercer, in surprise.  \"We all hope not,\" said Grenfel. \"But that's not what I mean. It doesn't take an army to destroy a railroad. One man with a bomb and a time fuse attached to it can blow up a culvert and block a whole line so that precious hours might be lost in getting troops aboard a transport. One man could blow up a waterworks or a gas tank or cut an important telegraph or telephone wire!\"  \"You mean that there will be Germans here trying to hurt England any way they can, don't you, sir?\" asked Harry Fleming.  \"I mean exactly that,\" said Grenfel. \"We don't know this--we can't be sure of it. But we've got good reason to believe that there are a great many Germans here, seemingly peaceable enough, who are regularly in the pay of the German government as spies. We don't know the German plans. But there is no reason, so far as we know, why their great Zeppelin airships shouldn't come sailing over England, to drop bombs down where they can do the most harm. There is nothing except our own vigilance to keep these spies, even if they have to work alone, from doing untold damage!\"  \"We could be useful as sentries, then?\" said Leslie Franklin. He drew a deep breath. \"I never thought of things like that, sir! I'm just beginning to see how useful we really might be. We could do a lot of things instead of soldiers, couldn't we? So that they would be free to go and fight?\"  \"Yes,\" answered the scoutmaster. \"And I can tell you now that the National Scout Council has always planned to 'Be Prepared!' It decided, a long time ago, what should be done in case of war. A great many troops will be offered to the War Department to do odd jobs. They will carry messages and dispatches. They will act as clerks, so far as they can. They will patrol the railways and other places that ought to be under guard, where soldiers can be spared if we take their places. So far as such things can be planned, they have been planned.  \"But most of the ways in which we can be useful haven't showed themselves at all yet. They will develop, if war comes. We shall have to be alert and watchful, and do whatever there is to be done.\"  \"Who will be scoutmaster, sir, if you go to the war?\" asked Harry.  \"I'm not quite sure,\" said Grenfel. \"We haven't decided yet. But it will be someone you can trust--be sure of that. And I think I needn't say that if you scouts have any real regard for me you will show it best by serving as loyally and as faithfully under him as you have under me. I shall be with you in spirit, no matter where I am. Now it's getting late. I think we'd better break up for to-night. We will make a special order, too, for the present. Every scout in the troop will report at scout headquarters until further notice, every day, at nine o'clock in the morning.  \"I think we'll have to make up our minds not to play many games for the time that is coming. There is real work ahead of us if war comes--work just as real and just as hard, in its way, as if we were all going to fight for England. Everyone cannot fight, but the ones who stay at home and do the work that comes to their hands will serve England just as loyally as if they were on the firing line! Now--up, all of you! Three cheers for King George!\"  They were given with a will--and Harry Fleming joined in as heartily as any of them. He was as much of an American as he had ever been, but something in him responded with a strange thrill to England's need, as Grenfel had expressed it. After all, England had been and was the mother country. England and America had fought, in their time, and America had won, but now, for a hundred years, there had been peace between them. And he and these English boys were of the same blood and the same language, binding them very closely together.  \"Blood is thicker than water, after all!\" he thought.  Then every scout there shook hands with John Grenfel. He smiled as he greeted them.  \"I hope this will pass over,\" he said, \"and that we'l"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19958"],["title","Some Forerunners of Italian Opera (#1)"],["body","or, in his \"Histoire de l'Harmonie au Moyen Age,\" gives facsimiles of all the pages of the original manuscript of this play. The notation, that of the eleventh century, is beautifully clear, and its deciphering is made easier by the presence of a line ruled across the page to indicate the relative positions of the notes. The music of these dramas is what we should naturally expect it to be, if we take into account the character of the text. The subjects of the dramas were always incidents from the Bible and the plays were represented in churches by priests or those close to them.  It is certain that the educational drama of the church continued in the state of its infancy for several centuries. Even after the birth of the \"Sacra Rappresentazione\" in the fourteenth century the old-fashioned liturgical drama survived in Italy and was preserved in activity in other parts of Europe. Several interesting manuscripts in great libraries attest the consideration accorded to it at a period much later than that of which we have been speaking. Nevertheless the era of the origin of the plays as a rule will be found to antedate that of the manuscripts. For example, in the royal library of Berlin there is a fifteenth century manuscript of a liturgical drama entitled, \"Die Marienklage.\" Dr. Frommann, of Nuremberg, after careful study, has decided that the play was of middle German (perhaps Thuringian) origin in the fourteenth century. This play is in part sung and in part spoken.[3] It begins with this bit of Latin chant by Mary:    [Musical Notation]      [Footnote 3: See Robert Eitner's introduction to the First Part of     \"Die Oper von ihren ersten Anfängen bis zur Mitte des 18.     Jahrhunderts.\" Leipsic, 1881.]  The rest of the text is in old German. Here is a specimen of the recitative or chant with the German text:    [Musical Notation]  These recitatives are in a style exactly like that of the early French church plays.  As Coussemaker notes, one does not find in these plays the passions, the intrigues nor the scenic movement found in the secular drama. What we do find is calm simplicity of statement, elevation and nobility of thought, purity of moral principles. The music designed to present these ideas in a high light necessarily has an appropriate character. We do not find here music of strongly marked rhythm and clearly defined measure, suitable to the utterance of worldly emotions, but a melody resembling the chant, written in the tonalities used in the church, but containing a certain kind of prose rhythm and accentuation, such as exists in the Gregorian music.  This was the inevitable march of development. The liturgical drama originated, as has been shown, in the celebration of certain offices and fêtes, for which the music assumed a style of delivery clothed in unwonted pomp. Characters and costumes and specially composed music soon found their way into these ceremonies. The new music followed the old lines and preserved the character of the liturgical chant. Gradually these accessories rose to the importance of separate incidents and finally to that of dramas. But they did not lose their original literary and musical character.  In studying the development of a secular lyric drama, it is essential that we keep in mind the nature of the music employed in the dramatic ceremonials, and later in the frankly theatrical representations of the church. The opera is a child of Italy and its direct ancestors must be sought there. The first secular musical plays of France far antedated the birth of the primitive lyric drama of Italy, and it requires something more than scientific devotion to establish a close connection between the two. But the early French ecclesiastical play is directly related to that of Italy. Both were products of the Catholic Church. Both employed the same texts and the same kind of music. They were developed by similar conditions; they were performed in similar circumstances and under the same rules.  For these reasons it is proper to discuss the early French religious drama and that of Italy as practically one and the same thing, and to pass without discrimination from the first performances of such plays outside the church to the establishment of that well-defined variety known in Italy as the \"Sacre Rappresentazioni.\" This form, as we shall see, was the immediate outgrowth of the \"laud,\" but one of its ancestors was the open-air performances. The emergence of the churchly play into the open was effected through the agency of ecclesiastic ceremonial. Pagan traditions and festivities died a hard death in the early years of Christianity, and some of them, instead of passing entirely out of the world of worship, maintained their existence in a transformed shape. Funerals, as Chouquet[4] pointedly notes, \"provided the occasion for scenic performances and certain religious fêtes the pretext for profane ceremonies.\"      [Footnote 4: \"Histoire de la Musique Dramatique en France,\" par     Gustave Chouquet. Paris, 1873.]  The fête of the ass, celebrated on January 14 every year at Beauvais, was an excellent example of this sort of ceremony. This was a representation of the flight into Egypt. A beautiful young woman, carrying in her arms an infant gorgeously dressed, was mounted on an ass. Then she moved with a procession from the cathedral to the church of St. Etienne. The procession marched into the choir, while the girl, still riding the ass, took a position in front of the altar. Then the mass was celebrated, and at the end of each part the words \"Hin han\" were chanted in imitation of the braying of the beast. The officiating priest, instead of chanting the \"Ite missa est,\" invited the congregation to join in imitating the bray.  This simple procession in time developed into a much more pretentious liturgical drama called \"The Prophets of Christ.\" But this appearance in the open streets was doubtless the beginning of the custom of enacting sacred plays in the public squares of cities and small towns. The fête of the ass dates from the eleventh century, and we shall see that open-air performances of religious dramas took place in the twelfth, if no sooner.  Other significant elements of the fête of the ass and similar ceremonials were the singing of choruses by the populace and dancing. In the Beauvais \"Flight into Egypt\" at one point the choir sang an old song, half Latin and half French, before the ass, clothed in a cope.    \"Hez, sire Asnes, car chantez!   Belle bouche rechignez;   Vous aurez du foin assez   Et de l'avoine a plantez.\"  This refrain was changed after each stanza of the Latin. The people of Limoges, in their yearly festival, sang:    \"San Marceau, pregas per nous,   E nous epingarem per vous.\"  In the seventeenth century these good people of Limoges were still holding a festival in honor of the patron saint of their parish, and singing:    \"Saint Martial, priez pour nous,   Et nous, nous danserons pour vous!\"  This choral dance formed in the church, and continued to the middle of the nave, and thence to the square before the edifice, or even into the cemetery. At a period later than that first mentioned these dances had instrumental accompaniment and became animated even to the verge of hysteria. Thus unwittingly the people of the medieval church were gathering into a loose, but by no means unformed, union the same materials as the ancients used in the creation of their drama.  The earnest Lewis Riccoboni[5] holds that the Fraternity of the Gonfalone, founded in 1264, was accustomed to enact the Passion in the Coliseum, and that these performances lasted till Paul III abolished them in 1549. Riccoboni argues that not the performance was interdicted, but the use of the Coliseum. This matters not greatly, since it is perfectly certain that out-door performances of the Passion took place long before 1549. Those which were given in France were extremely interesting and in regard to them we have important records. It is established beyond doubt that near the end of the fourteenth century a company of players called the Fraternity of the Passion assisted at the festivities attendant upon the marriage of Charles VI and Isabella of Bavaria. Thereafter they gave public performances of their version of the Passion.      [Footnote 5: \"An Historical and Critical Account of the Theaters     in Europe,\" by Lewis Riccoboni, translated from the Italian.     London, 1741.]  It was too long to be performed without rest, and it was therefore divided into several days' work. It employed eighty-seven personages and made use of elaborate machinery. There seems to be little doubt that some of the scenes were sung, and there is no question that there were choruses. The stage directions are not the least remarkable part of this play. The baptism is set forth in this wise: \"Here Jesus enters the waters of Jordan, all naked, and Saint John takes some of the water in his hand and throws it on the head of Jesus.\" Saint John says:    \"Sir, you now baptized are,   As it suits my simple skill,   Not the lofty rank you fill;   Unmeet for such great service I;   Yet my God, so debonair,   All that's wanting will supply.\"  \"Here Jesus comes out of the river Jordan and throws himself upon his knees, all naked, before Paradise. Then God, the Father, speaks, and the Holy Ghost descends, in the form of a white dove, upon the head of Jesus, and then returns into Paradise: and note that the words of God the Father be very audibly pronounced and well sounded in three voices, that is to say, a treble, a counter-treble and a counter-bass, all in tune; and in this way must the following lines be repeated:    'Hic est filius meus dilectus,   In quo mihi bene complacui.   C'estui-ci est mon fils amé Jesus,   Que bien me plaist, ma plaisance est en lui.'\"  Students are offered another choice of dates for the beginning of the performance of sacred plays in the open air in Italy, to wit, 1304.
