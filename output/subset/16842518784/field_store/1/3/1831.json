But you ain't by yo'self, Br'er Whale, in dat--         No, you ain't by yo'self in dat.  [Illustration]     THE GAME-COCK     Dey's some things square an' some things round,   An' little game cocks ain't sol' by de pound;   Dey's weighed by sand an' pluck an' grit   An' de number o' dead dey leave in de pit.         An' dey ain't by deyselves in rank like dat--         No, dey ain't by deyselves in dat.  [Illustration]     THE EPICURE     Ef you keep yo' eyes on Br'er Carrion Crow,   You'll wonder huccome he kin carry on so!   He flies in high circles an' chooses meat   Dat no honest workin'-man would eat.         An' he ain't no new high-flyer in dat--         No, he ain't by 'isself in dat.
