But with the ocean and the beach, I doubt if you'll stay in this yard much.\"  \"Oh, that's so; I forgot the ocean! Come on, Father, let's go and look at it.\"  So the three went down to the beach, and Marjorie, who hadn't been to the seashore since she was a small child, plumped herself down on the sand, and just gazed out at the tumbling waves.  \"I don't care for the swings and things,\" she said. \"I just want to stay here all the time, and dig and dig and dig.\"  As she spoke she was digging her heels into the fine white sand, and poking her hands in, and burying her arms up to her dimpled elbows.  \"Oh, Father, isn't it gee-lorious! Sit down, won't you, and let us bury you in sand, all but your nose!\"  \"Not now,\" said Mr. Maynard, laughing. \"Some day you may, when I'm in a bathing suit. But I don't care for pockets full of sand. Now, I'm going back to home and Mother. You two may stay down here till luncheon time if you like.\"  Mr. Maynard went back to the house, and King and Marjorie continued their explorations. The beach was flat and smooth, and its white sand was full of shells, and here and there a few bits of seaweed, and farther on some driftwood, and in the distance a pier, built out far into the ocean.  \"Did you ever _see_ such a place?\" cried Marjorie, in sheer delight.  \"Well, I was at the seashore last year,\" said King, \"while you were at Grandma's.\"  \"But it wasn't as nice as this, was it? Say it wasn't!\"  \"No; the sand was browner. This is the nicest sand I ever saw. Say, Mops, let's build a fire.\"  \"What for? It isn't cold.\"  \"No, but you always build fires on the beach. It's lots of fun. And we'll roast potatoes in it.\"  \"All right. How do we begin?\"  \"Well, we gather a lot of wood first. Come on.\"  Marjorie came on, and they worked with a will, gathering armfuls of wood and piling it up near the spot they had selected for their fire.  \"That's enough,\" said Marjorie, for her arms ached as she laid down her last contribution to their collection.  \"You'll find it isn't much when it gets to burning. But never mind, it will make a start. I'll skin up to the house and get matches and potatoes.\"  \"I'll go with you, 'cause I think we'd better ask Father about making this fire. It might do some harm.\"  \"Fiddlesticks! We made a fire 'most every day last summer.\"  And, owing to King's knowledge and experience regarding beach fires, his father told him he might build one, and to be properly careful about not setting fire to themselves.  Then they procured potatoes and apples from the kitchen, and raced back to the beach.  \"Why, where's our wood?\" cried Marjorie.  Not a stick or a chip remained of their carefully gathered wood pile.  \"Some one has stolen it!\" said King.  \"No, there's nobody around, except those people over there, and they're grown-ups. It must have been washed away by a wave.\"  \"Pooh, the waves aren't coming up near as far as this.\"  \"Well, there might have been a big one.\"  \"No, it wasn't a wave. That wood was stolen, Mops!\"  \"But who could have done it? Those grown-up people wouldn't. You can see from their looks they wouldn't. They're reading aloud. And in the other direction, there are only some fishermen,--they wouldn't take it.\"  \"Well, somebody did. Look, here are lots of footprints, and I don't believe they're all ours.\"  Sure enough, on the smooth white sand they could see many footprints, imprinted all over each other, as if scurrying feet had trodden all around their precious wood pile.  \"Oh, King, you're just like a detective!\" cried Marjorie, in admiration. \"But it's so! These aren't our footprints!\"  She fitted her spring-heeled tan shoes into the prints, and proved at once that they were not hers. Nor did King's shoes fit exactly, though they came nearer to it than Marjorie's.  \"Yes, sir; some fellows came along and stole that wood. Here are two or three quite different prints.\"  \"Well, where do they lead to?\" said practical Marjorie.  \"That's so. Let's trace them and get the wood back.\"  But after leading away from them for a short distance the footprints became fainter, and in a softer bit of sand disappeared altogether.  \"Pshaw!\" said King. \"I don't so much care about the wood, but I hate to lose the trail like this. Let's hunt, Mopsy.\"  \"All right, but first, let's bury these apples and potatoes, or they'll be stolen, too.\"  \"Good idea!\" And they buried their treasures in the nice, clean sand, and marked the place with an inconspicuous stick.  Then they set out to hunt their lost wood. The beach, though flat and shelving at the water's edge, rose in a low bluff farther back, and this offered among its irregular projections many good hiding-places for their quarry.  And, sure enough, after some searching, they came suddenly upon three boys who sat, shaking with laughter, upon a pile of wood.  The two Maynards glared at them rather angrily, upon which the three again went off in peals of laughter.  \"That's our wood!\" began King, aggressively.  \"Sure it is!\" returned the biggest boy, still chuckling.  \"What did you bring it over here for?\"  \"Just for fun!\"  \"H'm, just for fun! And do you think it would be fun to carry it back again?\"  \"Yep; just's lieve as not. Come on, kids!\" And that remarkable boy began to pick up the sticks.  \"Oh, hold on,\" said King. \"If you're so willing, you needn't do it! Who are you, anyway?\"  \"Well,\" said the biggest boy, suddenly straightening himself up and bowing politely to Marjorie, \"we're your neighbors. We live in that green house next to yours. And we're named Tom, Dick, and Harry. Yes, I know you think those names sound funny, but they're ours all the same. Thomas, Richard, and Henry Craig,--at your service! I'm Tom. This is Dick, and this is Harry.\"  He whacked his brothers on the shoulder as he named them, and they ducked forward in polite, if awkward salutation.  \"And did you really take our wood?\" said Marjorie, with an accusing glance, as if surprised that such pleasant-spoken boys could do such a thing.  \"Yes, we did. We wanted to see what sort of stuff you were made of. You know Seacote people are sort of like one big family, and we wanted to know how you'd behave about the wood. You've been fine, and now we'll cart it back where we found it. If you had got mad about it, we wouldn't touch a stick to take it back,--would we, fellows?\"  \"Nope,\" said the other two, and the Maynards could see at once that Tom was the captain and ringleader of the trio.  \"Well,\" said King, judicially, \"if you hadn't been the sort you are, I _should_ have got mad. But I guess you're all right, and so you _may_ take it back. But we don't help you do it,--see? I'm Kingdon Maynard, and this is my sister Marjorie. You fellows took our wood, and now you're going to return it. Is that right?\"  \"Right-o!\" said Tom. \"Come on, fellows.\"  The three boys flew at it, and King and Midget sat on the sand and watched them till the wood was restored to its original position.  \"All right,\" said King; \"you boys'll do. Now, come on and roast potatoes with us.\"  Thus, all demands of honor having been complied with, the five proceeded to become friends. The boys built the fire, and gallantly let Marjorie have the fun of putting the potatoes and apples in place.  The Craig boys had nice instincts, and while they were rather rough-and-tumble among themselves, they treated King more decorously, and seemed to consider Marjorie as a being of a higher order, made to receive not only respect, but reverent homage.  \"You see, we never had a sister,\" said Tom; \"and we're a little bit scared of girls.\"  \"Well, I have three,\" said King, \"so you see I haven't such deep awe of them. But Midget won't hurt you, so don't be _too_ scared of her.\"  Marjorie smiled in most friendly fashion, for she liked these boys, and especially Tom.  \"How old are you?\" she asked him, in her frank, pleasant way.  \"I'm fourteen,\" replied Tom, \"and the other kids are twelve and ten.\"  \"King's fourteen,--'most fifteen,\" said Midget; \"and I'll be thirteen in July. So we're all in the same years. I wish our Kitty was here. She's nearly eleven, but she isn't any bigger than Harry.\"  Harry smiled shyly, and poked at the potatoes with a stick, not knowing quite what to say.  \"You see,\" King explained, \"Midget is the best sort of a girl there is. She's girly, all right, and yet she's as good as a boy at cutting up jinks or doing any old kind of stunts.\"  The three Craigs looked at Marjorie in speechless admiration.  \"I never knew that kind,\" said Tom, thoughtfully. \"You see, we go to a boys' school, and we haven't any girl cousins, or anything; and the only girls I ever see are at dancing class, or in a summer hotel, and then they're all frilled up, and sort of airy.\"  \"I love to play with boys,\" said Marjorie, frankly, \"and I guess we'll have a lot of fun this summer.\"  \"I guess we _will_! Are you going to stay all summer?\"  \"Yes, till September, when school begins.\"  \"So are we. Isn't it funny we live next door to each other?\"  \"Awful funny,\" agreed Marjorie, pulling a very black potato out of the red-hot embers. \"This is done,\" she went on, \"and I'm going to eat it.\"  \"So say we all of us,\" cried King. \"One done,--all done! Help yourselves, boys!\"  So they all pulled out the black, sooty potatoes, with more delighted anticipations than would have been roused by the daintiest dish served at a table.  \"Ow!\" cried Marjorie, flinging down her potato, and sticking her finger in her mouth. \"Ow! that old thing _popped_ open, and burned me awfully!\"  \"Too bad, Mops!\" said King, with genuine sympathy, but the Craig boys were more solicitous.  \"Oh, oh! I'm so sorry,\" cried Tom. \"Does it hurt _terribly_?\"  \"Yes, it does,\" said Midget, who was not in the habit of complaining when she got hurt, but who was really suffering from the sudden burn.  \"Let me tie it up,\" said Dick, shyly.  \"Yes, do,\" said Tom. \"Dick is our good boy. He always helps everybody else.\"  "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18038"],["title","Days of the Discoverers (#1)"],["body","woodland appeared glimpses of a treeless pasture dotted with scrubby low bushes and clumps of rushes. A glint of clear green water betrayed a small lake in a dip of the hills. And now were heard sounds most unusual in that lonely place, the high sweet voices of children.  Birch trees, little trees, dwarfed by sharp winds and poor soil, encircled a level space perhaps ten feet across, carpeted with new soft grass, reindeer moss and cupped lichens. Here sat seven or eight children eagerly listening to a story told by an older child as she divided the ration of fladbrod,[3] wild strawberries from a small basket of birchbark, and brown goat's-milk cheese.  \"And Freya came from Asgard in her chariot drawn by two cats--\"  Nikolina the daughter of Sven Larsson of the Trolle farm was known through all the valley, not only as the sole child of its richest farmer, but for the bright blonde hair that covered her shoulders with its soft abundance and hung to her waist. Her father would not have it cut or braided or even covered save by such a little embroidered cap as she wore now. Her scarlet bodice, and blue-black skirt bordered with bright woven bands, were of the finest wool; the full-sleeved white linen under-dress had been spun and woven and embroidered by skilful and loving fingers. Nikolina had lost the roof from over her head, and a great deal more than that. Now she was giving her whole mind to the little ones of all ages from four to eight, crowding close about her.  [Illustration: \"'And Freya came from Asgard in her chariot drawn by two cats'\"--_Page_ 4]  \"Hi!\" called Nils, \"where is Mother Elle? See what Thorolf and I have got!\"  The children scrambled to their feet and gazed with round eyes, their small hungry teeth munching their morsels of hard bread. Nikolina plucked a bunch of grass for Snow, the foremost cow, and patted her as she ate it.  \"The little ones were so tired and hungry,\" she said, \"that Mother Elle said they might have their supper now, while she and Olof and Anders went on to the saeter. This is wonderful! She was saying only this morning that she feared all the cattle were dead or stolen.\"  Within an hour they came in sight of the log huts with turf-covered roofs that sloped almost to the ground in the rear. A broad plain stretched away beyond, and the new grass was of that vivid green to be found in places which deep snow makes pure. Hills enclosed it, and beyond, a gleaming network of lake and stream ended in range above range of blue and silver peaks. The clear invigorating air was like some unearthly wine. The cows at the scent of fresh pasture moved more briskly; the pony tossed his head and whinnied. Not far from the cottages there came to meet them a little old woman, dark and wiry, with bright searching eyes. Her face was wrinkled all over in fine soft lines, but her hair was hardly gray at all. She wore a pointed hood and girdled tunic of tanned reindeer hide, with leggings and shoes of the same. A blanket about her shoulders was draped into a kind of pouch, in which she carried on her back a tow-headed, solemn-eyed baby.  \"Welcome to you, Thorolf Erlandsson,\" she said, just as if she had been expecting him. \"With this good milk we shall fare like the King.\"  No king, truly, could have supped on food more delicious than that enjoyed by Nils and Thorolf on this first night in the saeter. It is strange but true that the most exquisite delights are those that money cannot buy. No man can taste cold spring water and barley bread in absolute perfection who has not paid the poor man's price--hard work and keen hunger.  When Nikolina, Karen and Lovisa came up with the smaller children the place had already an inhabited, homelike look. There was even a wise old raven, almost as large as a gander, whom Nils had christened Munin, after Odin's bird. The little ones had all the new milk they could drink from their wooden bowls, and were put to bed in the movable wooden bed-places, on beds of hay covered with sheepskins and blankets. All were asleep before dark, for at that season the night lasted only two or three hours. The last thing that Thorolf heard was a happy little pipe from the five-year-old Ellida,--  \"Now we shall live in Asgard forever and ever.\"  For all it had to do with the experience of many of the children the saeter might really have been Asgard, the Norse paradise. The youngest had never before been outside the narrow valley where they were born. Ellida and Margit, Didrik and little Peder, could not be convinced that they were anywhere but in Asgard the Blest.  Norway had long since become Christian, but the old faith was not forgotten. The legends, songs and customs of the people were full of it. In the sagas Asgard was described as being on a mountain at the top of the world. Around the base of this mountain lay Midgard, the abode of mankind. Beyond the great seas, in Utgard, the giants lived. Hel was the under-world, the home of evil ghosts and spirits. Tales were told in the long winter evenings, of Baldur the god of spring, Loki the crafty, Odin the old one-eyed beggar in a hooded cloak, with his two ravens and his two tame wolves, Freya the lovely lady of flowers, Elle-folk dancing in the moonlight, and little rascally Trolls.  The songs and legends repeated by the old people or chanted by minstrels or skalds were more than idle stories--they were the history of a race. Children heard over and over again the family records telling in rude rhyme the story of centuries. In distant Iceland, Greenland, the Shetlands, the Faroes or the Orkneys, a Norseman could tell exactly what might be his udall right, or right of inheritance, in the land of his fathers.  On Nils and Thorolf, Anders, Olof, Nikolina, Karen and Lovisa, who were all over ten years old, rested great responsibility. Mother Elle always managed to solve her own problems and expected them to attend to theirs without constant direction from her. She told them what there was to be done and left them to attend to it.  All were hardy, active youngsters who took to fending for themselves as naturally as a day-old chick takes to scratching. In ordinary seasons the work at the saeter was heavy, for the maidens must not only follow the herds over miles of pasture land, but make butter and cheese for the winter from their milking. The few cows that were here now could be tethered near by; the milk, when the children had had all they wanted, was mostly used in soups, pudding or gröt (porridge). A net or weir stretched across the outlet of the lake would fill with fish overnight. The streams were full of trout. Mother Elle knew how to make fish-hooks of bone, bows and arrows, ropes, and baskets of bark, how to weave osiers, how to cure bruises and cuts, how to trap the wild hares, grouse and plover and cook them over an open fire. The children found plover's eggs and the eggs of other wild fowl. They raised pulse, leeks, onions and turnips in a little garden patch. They gathered strawberries, cranberries, crowberries, wild currants, black and red, the cloudberry and the delicious arctic raspberry which tastes of pineapple. Some stores of salt and grain were already at the saeter and the grain-fields had been sowed, before the pestilence appeared in the valley.  In the long summer days of these northern mountains, one has the feeling that they will never end, that life must go on in an infinite succession of still, sunshiny, fragrant hours, filled with the songs of birds, the chirr of insects and the distant lowing of cattle. There is time for everything. At night comes dreamless slumber, and the morning is like a birth into new life.  There was a great deal of singing and story-telling at odd times. A group of children making mats or baskets, gathering pease or going after berries would beg Nils or Nikolina to tell a story, or Karen would lead them in some old song with a familiar refrain. But some of the songs the Wind-wife crooned to the baby were not like any the children had heard. They were not even in Norwegian.  Thorolf was a silent lad, who would rather listen than talk, and hated asking questions. But one day, when he and Nikolina were hunting wild raspberries, he asked her if she thought Mother Elle meant to stay in the mountains through the winter. Nikolina did not know.      \"'Tis well to be wise but not too wise,     'Tis well that to-morrow is hid from our eyes,     For in forward-looking forebodings rise,\"  she added quaintly. \"I have heard her say that it is colder in Greenland than it is here.\"  \"Has she been in Greenland?\"  \"Her father and mother were on the way there when she was little, and the ship was wrecked somewhere on the coast. The Skroelings found her and took her to live in their country. That is how she learned so much about trees and herbs, and how to make bows and arrows and moccasins.\"  \"Moccasins?\"  \"The little shoes she made for Ellida. And she made a little boat for Peder, like their skiffs.\"  This was interesting. For a private reason, Thorolf held Greenland to be the most fascinating of all places.  \"Can she speak their language?\"  \"Of course. I asked her to teach me, and she said that perhaps she would some day. The songs that she sings to the little ones are some that the Skroeling woman who adopted her used to sing to her when she cried for her own mother. One of them begins like this:      \"'Piche Klooskap pechian     Machieswi menikok.'\"  \"What does it mean?\"  \"'Long ago Klooskap came to the island of the partridges.' Klooskap was like Odin, or Thor. The priests in Greenland told her he was a devil and wouldn't let her talk about him, but the Skroelings had runes for everything just like the people in the sagas,--runes for war, and healing, and the sea.\"  \"How did she ever get away?\"  \"Some men came from Westbyrg to cut wood in the forest, and when they saw that she was not really a Skroeling they bought her for an iron pot and one of them married her. But he was drowned a"]]]
