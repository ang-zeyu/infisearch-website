At La Ferte, among the hills, he paused at a crossroads and, alighting from his machine, stood watching as a long, silent procession of wagons passed by in the quiet night, moving southward. He knew now what it meant to go into the West. One after another they passed in deathlike stillness, the Red Cross upon the side of each plainly visible in the moonlight. As he paused, the rider could hear the thunder of great guns in the north. Many stretchers, borne by men afoot, followed the wagons and he could hear the groans of those who tossed restlessly upon them.  \"Look out for shell holes,\" he heard someone say. So there were Americans in the fighting, he thought.  He ran along the edge of the hills now on the fifteen-mile stretch to Meaux, where he intended to follow the road northward through Senlis and across the old trenches near Clermont. He could hear the booming all the while, but it seemed weary and spent, like a runner who has slackened his pace and begun to pant.  At Meaux he crossed the path of another silent cavalcade of stretchers and ambulances and wounded soldiers who were being supported as they limped along. They spoke in French and one voice came out of an ambulance, seeming hollow and far off, as though from a grave. Then came a lot of German prisoners tramping along, some sullen and some with a fine air of bravado sneering at their guards.  The rider knew where he was going and how to get there and he did not venture any inquiries either as to his way or what had been going on.  Happenings in Flanders and Picardy are known in America before they are known to the boys in Alsace. He knew there was fighting in the West and that Fritz had poked a big bulge into the French line, for his superiors had given him a road map with the bulge pencilled upon it so that he might go around it and not bump his nose into it, as he had said. But he had not expected to see such obvious signs of fighting and it made him realize that at last he was getting into the war with a vengeance.  Instead of following the road leading northwest out of Meaux, he took the one leading northeast up through Villers-Cotterets, intending to run along the edge of the forest to Campiegne and then verge westward to the billet villages northwest of Montdidier, where he was to report.  This route brought him within ten miles of the west arm of the salient, but the way was quiet and there was no sign of the fighting as he rode along in the woody solitude. It reminded him of his home far back in America and of the woods where he and his scout companions had camped and hiked and followed the peaceful pursuits of stalking and trailing.  He was thinking of home as he rode leisurely along the winding forest road, when suddenly he was startled by a rustling sound among the trees.  \"Who goes there?\" he demanded in pursuance of his general instructions for such an emergency, at the same time drawing his pistol. \"Halt!\"  He was the scout again now, keen, observant. But there was no answer to his challenge and he narrowed his eyes to mere slits, peering into the tree-studded solitude, waiting.  Then suddenly, close by him he heard that unmistakable sound, the clanking of a chain, and accompanying it a voice saying, \"Kamerad.\"     CHAPTER TWO  AID AND COMFORT TO THE ENEMY   Tom Slade, dispatch-rider, knew well enough what _kamerad_ meant. He had learned at least that much of German warfare and German honor, even in the quiet Toul sector. He knew that the German olive branch was poisoned; that German treachery was a fine art--a part of the German efficiency. Had not Private Coleburn, whom Tom knew well, listened to that kindly uttered word and been stabbed with a Prussian bayonet in the darkness of No Man's Land?  \"Stand up,\" said Tom. \"Nobody can talk to _me_ crouching down like that.\"  \"Ach!\" said the voice in the unmistakable tone of pain. \"Vot goot--see!\"  Tom turned on his searchlight and saw crawling toward him a German soldier, hatless and coatless, whose white face seemed all the more pale and ghastly for the smear of blood upon it. He was quite without arms, in proof of which he raised his open hands and slapped his sides and hips. As he did so a long piece of heavy chain, which was manacled to his wrist clanged and rattled.  \"Ach!\" he said, shaking his head as if in agony.  \"Put your hands down. All right,\" said Tom. \"Can you speak English?\"  \"Kamerad,\" he repeated and shrugged his shoulders as if that were enough.  \"You escape?\" said Tom, trying to make himself understood. \"How did you get back of the French lines?\"  \"Shot broke--yach,\" the man said, his face lapsing again into a hopeless expression of suffering.  \"All right,\" said Tom, simply. \"Comrade--I say it too. All right?\"  The soldier's face showed unmistakable relief through his suffering.  \"Let's see what's the matter,\" Tom said, though he knew the other only vaguely understood him. Turning the wheel so as the better to focus the light upon the man, he saw that he had been wounded in the foot, which was shoeless and bleeding freely, but that the chief cause of his suffering was the raw condition of his wrist where the manacle encircled it and the heavy chain pulled. It seemed to Tom as if this cruel sore might have been caused by the chain dragging behind him and perhaps catching on the ground as he fled.  \"The French didn't put that on?\" he queried, rather puzzled.  The soldier shook his head. \"Herr General,\" said he.  \"Not the Americans?\"  \"Herr General--gun.\"  Then suddenly there flashed into Tom's mind something he had heard about German artillerymen being chained to their guns. So that was it. And some French gunner, or an American maybe, had unconsciously set this poor wretch free by smashing his chain with a shell.  \"You're in the French lines,\" Tom said. \"Did you mean to come here? You're a prisoner.\"  \"Ach, diss iss petter,\" the man said, only half understanding.  \"Yes, I guess it is,\" said Tom. \"I'll bind your foot up and then I'll take that chain off if I can and bind your wrist. Then we'll have to find the nearest dressing station. I suppose you got lost in this forest. I been in the German forest myself,\" he added; \"it's fine--better than this. I got to admit they've got fine lakes there.\"  Whether he said this by way of comforting the stranger--though he knew the man understood but little of it--or just out of the blunt honesty which refused to twist everything German into a thing of evil, it would be hard to say. He had about him that quality of candor which could not be shaken even by righteous enmity.  Tearing two strips from his shirt, he used the narrower one to make a tourniquet, which he tied above the man's ankle.  \"If you haven't got poison in it, it won't be so bad,\" he said. \"Now I'll take off that chain.\"  He raised his machine upon its rest so that the power wheel was free of the ground. Then, to the wounded Boche's puzzled surprise, he removed the tire and fumbling in his little tool kit he took out a piece of emery cloth which he used for cleaning his plugs and platinum contact points, and bent it over the edge of the rim, binding it to the spokes with the length of insulated wire which he always carried. It was a crude and makeshift contrivance at best, but at last he succeeded, by dint of much bending and winding and tying of the pliable copper wire among the spokes of the wheel, in fastening the emery cloth over the fairly sharp rim so that it stayed in place when he started his power and in about two revolutions it cut a piece of wire with which he tested the power of his improvised mechanical file.  \"Often I sharpened a jackknife that way on the fly-wheel of a motor boat,\" he said. The Boche did not understand him, but he was quick to see the possibilities of this whirling hacksaw and he seemed to acknowledge, with as much grace as a German may, the Yankee ingenuity of his liberator.  \"Give me your wrist,\" said Tom, reaching for it; \"I won't hurt it any more than I have to; here--here's a good scheme.\"  He carefully stuffed his handkerchief around under the metal band which encircled the soldier's wrist and having thus formed a cushion to receive the pressure and protect the raw flesh, he closed his switch again and gently subjected the manacle to the revolving wheel, holding it upon the edge of the concave tire bed.  If the emery cloth had extended all the way around the wheel he could have taken the manacle off in less time than it had taken Kaiser Bill to lock it on, for the contrivance rivalled a buzzsaw. As it was, he had to stop every minute or two to rearrange the worn emery cloth and bind it in place anew. But for all that he succeeded in less than fifteen minutes in working a furrow almost through the metal band so that a little careful manipulating and squeezing and pressing of it enabled him to break it and force it open.  \"There you are,\" he said, removing the handkerchief so as to get a better look at the cruel sore beneath; \"didn't hurt much, did it? That's what Uncle Sam's trying to do for all the rest of you fellers--only you haven't got sense enough to know it.\"     CHAPTER THREE  THE OLD COMPASS   Tom took the limping Boche, his first war prisoner, to the Red Cross station at Vivieres where they had knives and scissors and bandages and antiseptics, but nothing with which to remove Prussian manacles, and all the king's horses and all the king's men and the willing, kindly nurses there could have done little for the poor Boche if Tom Slade, alias Thatchy, had not administered his own particular kind of first aid.  The French doctors sent him forth with unstinted praise which he only half understood, and as he sped along the road for Compiegne he wondered who could have been the allied gunner who at long range had cut Fritzie loose from the piece of artillery to which he had been chained.  \"That feller and I did a good job anyway,\" he thought.  At Compiegne the whole"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19495"],["title","Tom Slade, Motorcycle Dispatch Bearer (#2)"],["body","was in a ferment as he passed through. Hundreds of refugees with mule carts and wheelbarrows laden with their household goods, were leaving the town in anticipation of the German advance. They made a mournful procession as they passed out of the town along the south road with babies crying and children clamoring about the clumsy, overladen vehicles. He saw many boys in khaki here and there and it cheered and inspired him to know that his country was represented in the fighting. He had to pause in the street to let a company of them pass by on their way northward to the trench line and it did his heart good to hear their cheery laughter and typical American banter.  \"Got any cigarettes, kiddo?\" one called.  \"Where you going--north?\" asked another.  \"To the billets west of Montdidier,\" Tom answered. \"I'm for new service. I came from Toul sector.\"  \"Good-_night_! That's Sleepy Hollow over there.\"  From Compiegne he followed the road across the Aronde and up through Mery and Tricot into Le Cardonnois. The roads were full of Americans and as he passed a little company of them he called,  \"How far is ----?\" naming the village of his destination.  \"About two miles,\" one of them answered; \"straight north.\"  \"Tell 'em to give 'em Hell,\" another called.  This laconic utterance was the first intimation which Tom had that anything special was brewing in the neighborhood, and he answered with characteristic literalness, \"All right, I will.\"  The road northward from Le Cardonnois was through a hilly country, where there were few houses. About half a mile farther on he reached the junction of another road which appeared also to lead northward, verging slightly in an easterly direction. He had made so many turns that he was a little puzzled as to which was the true north road, so he stopped and took out the trusty little compass which he always carried, and held it in the glare of his headlight, thinking to verify his course. Undoubtedly the westward road was the one leading to his destination for as he walked a little way along the other road he found that it bent still more to the eastward and he believed that it must reach the French front after another mile or two.  As he looked again at the cheap, tin-encased compass he smiled a little ruefully, for it reminded him of Archibald Archer, with whom he had escaped from the prison camp in Germany and made his perilous flight through the Black Forest into Switzerland and to the American forces near Toul.  Archibald Archer! Where, in all that war-scourged country, was Archibald Archer now, Tom wondered. No doubt, chatting familiarly with generals and field marshals somewhere, in blithe disregard of dignity and authority; for he was a brazen youngster and an indefatigable souvenir hunter.  So vivid were Tom's thoughts of Archer that, being off his machine, he sat down by the roadside to eat the rations which his anxiety to reach his destination had deterred him from eating before.  \"That's just like him,\" he thought, holding the compass out so that it caught the subdued rays of his dimmed headlight; \"always marking things up, or whittling his initials or looking for souvenirs.\"  The particular specimen of Archer's handiwork which opened this train of reminiscence was part and parcel of the mischievous habit which apparently had begun very early in his career, when he renovated the habiliments of the heroes and statesmen in his school geography by pencilling high hats and sunbonnets on their honored heads and giving them flowing moustaches and frock coats.  In the prison camp from which they had escaped he had carved his initials on fence and shack, but his masterpiece was the conversion of the N on this same glassless compass into a very presentable S (though turned sideways) and the S into a very presentable N.  The occasion of his doing this was a singular experience the two boys had had in their flight through Germany when, after being carried across a lake on a floating island while asleep, they had swum back and retraced their steps northward supposing that they were still going south.  \"Either we're wrong or the compass is wrong, Slady,\" the bewildered Archer had said, and he had forthwith altered the compass points before they discovered the explanation of their singular experience.  After reaching the American forces Archer had gone forth to more adventures and new glories in the transportation department, the line of his activities being between Paris and the coast, and Tom had seen him no more. He had given the compass to Tom as a \"souvenir,\" and Tom, whose sober nature had found much entertainment in Archer's sprightliness, had cherished it as such. It was useful sometimes, too, though he had to be careful always to remember that it was the \"wrong way round.\"  \"He'll turn up like a bad penny some day,\" he thought now, smiling a little. \"He said he'd bring me the clock from a Paris cathedral for a souvenir, and he'd change the twelve to twenty-two on it.\"  He remembered that he had asked Archer _what_ cathedral in Paris, and Archer had answered, \"The Cathedral de la Plaster of Paris.\"  \"He's a sketch,\" thought Tom.     CHAPTER FOUR  THE OLD FAMILIAR FACES   \"That's the way it is,\" thought Tom, \"you get to know fellers and like 'em, and then you get separated and you don't see 'em any more.\"  Perhaps he was the least bit homesick, coming into this new sector where all were strangers to him. In any event, as he sat there finishing his meal he fell to thinking of the past and of the \"fellers\" he had known. He had known a good many for despite his soberness there was something about him which people liked. Most of his friends had taken delight in jollying him and he was one of those boys who are always being nicknamed wherever they go. Over in the Toul sector they \"joshed\" and \"kidded\" him from morning till night but woe be to you if you had sought to harm him!  He had been sorry, in a way, to leave the Toul sector, just as he had been sorry to leave Bridgeboro when he got his first job on a ship. \"That's one thing fellers can't understand,\" he thought, \"how you can be sorry about a thing and glad too. Girls understand better--I'll say that much for 'em, even though I--even though they never had much use for me----\"  He fell to thinking of the scout troop of which he had been a member away back in America, of Mr. Ellsworth, the scoutmaster, who had lifted him out of the gutter, and of Roy Blakeley who was always fooling, and Peewee Harris. Peewee must be quite a boy by now--not a tenderfootlet any more, as Roy had called him.  And then there was Rossie Bent who worked in the bank and who had run away the night before Registration Day, hoping to escape military service. Tom fell to thinking of him and of how he had traced him up to a lonely mountain top and made him go back and register just in time to escape disgrace and punishment.  \"He thought he was a coward till he got the uniform on,\" he thought. \"That's what makes the difference. I bet he's one of the bravest soldiers over here now. Funny if I should meet him. I always liked him anyway, even when people said he was conceited. Maybe he had a right to be. If girls liked me as much as they did him maybe _I'd_ be conceited. Anyway, I'd like to see him again, that's one sure thing.\"  When he had finished his meal he felt of his tires, gave his grease cup a turn, mounted his machine and was off to the north for whatever awaited him there, whether it be death or glory or just hard work; and to new friends whom he would meet and part with, who doubtless would \"josh\" him and make fun of his hair and tell him extravagant yarns and belittle and discredit his soberly and simply told \"adventures,\" and yet who would like him nevertheless.  \"That's the funny thing about some fellers,\" he thought, \"you never can tell whether they like you or not. Rossie used to say girls were hard to understand, but, gee, I think fellers are harder!\"  Swiftly and silently along the moonlit road he sped, the dispatch-rider who had come from the blue hills of Alsace across the war-scorched area into the din and fire and stenching suffocation and red-running streams of Picardy \"for service as required.\" Two miles behind the straining line he rode and parallel with it, straight northward, keeping his keen, steady eyes fixed upon the road for shell holes. Over to the east he could hear the thundering boom of artillery and once the air just above him seemed to buzz as if some mammoth wasp had passed. But he rode steadily, easily, without a tremor.  When he dismounted in front of headquarters at the little village of his destination his stolid face was grimy from his long ride and the dust of the blue Alsatian mountains mingled with the dust of devastated France upon his khaki uniform (which was proper and fitting) and his rebellious hair was streaky and matted and sprawled down over his frowning forehead.  A little group of soldiers gathered about him after he had given his paper to the commanding officer, for he had come a long way and they knew the nature of his present service if he did not. They watched him rather curiously, for it was not customary to bring a dispatch-rider from such a distance when there were others available in the neighborhood. He was the second sensation of that memorable night, for scarcely two hours before General Pershing himself had arrived and he was at that very minute in conference with other officers in the little red brick cottage. Even as the group of soldiers clustered about the rider, officers hurried in and out with maps, and one young fellow, an aviator apparently, suddenly emerged and hurried away.  \"What's going to be doing?\" Tom asked, taking notice of all these activities and speaking in his dull way.  Evidently the boys had already taken his measure and formulated their policy, for one answered,  \"Peace has been declared and they're trying to decide whether we'd better take Berlin or have it sent C.O.D.\"  "]]]
