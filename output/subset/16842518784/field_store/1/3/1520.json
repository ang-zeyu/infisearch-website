Ever since 1807, when the space between the Rhine and the Niemen had been overrun, the two great empires of which these rivers were the boundaries had become rivals. By his concessions at Tilsit, at the expense of Prussia, Sweden, and Turkey, Napoleon had only satisfied Alexander. That treaty was the result of the defeat of Russia, and the date of her submission to the continental system. Among the Russians, it was regarded by some as attacking their honour; and by all it was felt to be ruinous to their interests.  By the continental system Napoleon had declared eternal war against the English; to that system he attached his honour, his political existence, and that of the nation under his sway. That system banished from the Continent all merchandise which was English, or had paid duty in any shape to England. He could not succeed in establishing it but by the unanimous consent of the continental nations, and that consent could not be hoped for but under a single and universal dominion.  France had besides alienated the nations of Europe from her by her conquests, and the monarchs by her revolution and her new dynasty. Henceforward she could no longer look forward to have either friends or rivals, but merely subjects; for the first would have been false, and the second implacable: it followed that all must be subject to her, or she to all.  With feelings of this kind, her leader, influenced by his position, and urged on by his enterprising character, filled his imagination with the vast project of becoming the sole master of Europe, by overwhelming Russia, and wresting Poland from her dominion. He had so much difficulty in concealing this project, that hints of it began to escape him in all directions. The immense preparations which so distant an enterprise required, the enormous quantities of provisions and ammunition collecting, the noise of arms, of carriages, and the march of such numbers of soldiers--the universal movement the majestic and terrible course of all the forces of the West against the East--every thing announced to Europe that her two colossuses were about to measure their strength with each other.  But, to get within reach of Russia, it was necessary to go beyond Austria, to cross Prussia, and to march between Sweden and Turkey; an offensive alliance with these four powers was therefore indispensable. Austria was as much subject to the influence of Napoleon as Prussia was to his arms: to them he had only to declare his intentions; Austria voluntarily and eagerly entered into his plans, and Prussia he easily prevailed on to join him.  Austria, however, did not act blindly. Situated between the two great colossuses of the North and the West, she was not displeased to see them at war: she looked to their mutually weakening each other, and to the increase of her own strength by their exhaustion. On the 14th of March, 1812, she promised France 30,000 men; but she prepared prudent secret instructions for them. She obtained a vague promise of an increase of territory, as an indemnity for her share of the expenses of the war, and the possession of Gallicia was guaranteed to her. She admitted, however, the future possibility of a cession of part of that province to the kingdom of Poland; but in exchange for that she would have received the Illyrian provinces. The sixth article of the secret treaty establishes that fact.  The success of the war, therefore, in no degree depended on the cession of Gallicia, or the difficulties arising from the Austrian jealousy of that possession. Napoleon, consequently, might on his entrance into Wilna, have publicly proclaimed the liberation of the whole of Poland, instead of betraying the expectations of her people, astonishing and rendering them indifferent by expressions of wavering import.  This, however, was one of those prominent points, which in politics as well as in war are decisive, with which every thing is connected, and from which nothing ought to have made him swerve. But whether it was that Napoleon reckoned too much on the ascendancy of his genius, or the strength of his army, and the weakness of Alexander; or that, considering what he left behind him, he felt it too dangerous to carry on so distant a war slowly and methodically; or whether, as we shall presently be told by himself, he had doubts of the success of his undertaking; certain it is, that he either neglected, or could not yet determine to proclaim the liberation of that country whose freedom he had come to restore.  And yet he had sent an ambassador to her Diet. When this inconsistency was remarked to him, he replied, that \"that nomination was an act of war, which only bound him during the war, while by his words he would be bound both in war and peace.\" Thus it was, that he made no other reply to the enthusiasm of the Lithuanians than evasive expressions, at the very time he was following up his attack on Alexander to the very capital of his empire.  He even neglected to clear the southern Polish provinces of the feeble hostile armies which kept the patriotism of their inhabitants in check, and to secure, by strongly organizing their insurrection, a solid basis of operation. Accustomed to short methods, and to rapid attacks, he wished to imitate himself, in spite of the difference of places and circumstances; for such is the weakness of man, that he is always led by imitation, either of others, or of himself, which in the latter case, that of great men, is habit; for habit is nothing more than the imitation of one's self. So true it is, that by their strongest side these extraordinary men are undone!  The one in question committed himself to the fortune of battles. Having prepared an army of six hundred and fifty thousand men, he fancied that that was doing sufficient to secure victory, from which he expected every thing. Instead of sacrificing every thing to obtain victory, it was by that he looked to obtain every thing; he made use of it as a _means_, when it ought to have been his _end_. In this manner he made it too necessary; it was already rather too much so. But he confided so much of futurity to it, he overloaded it with so much responsibility, that it became urgent and indispensable to him. Hence his precipitation to get within reach of it, in order to extricate himself from so critical a position.  But we must not be too hasty in condemning a genius so great and universal; we shall shortly hear from himself by what urgent necessity he was hurried on; and even admitting that the rapidity of his expedition was only equalled by its rashness, success would have probably crowned it, if the premature decline of his health had left the physical constitution of this great man all the vigour which his mind still retained.     CHAP. II.   As to Prussia, of which Napoleon was completely master, it is not known whether it was from his uncertainty as to the fate which he reserved for her, or as to the period at which he should commence the war, that he refused, in 1811, to contract the alliance which she herself proposed to him, and of which he dictated the conditions, in 1812.  His aversion to Frederick William was remarkable. Napoleon had been frequently heard to speak reproachfully of the cabinet of Prussia for its treaties with the French republic. He said, \"It was a desertion of the cause of kings; that the negotiations of the court of Berlin with the Directory displayed a timid, selfish, and ignoble policy, which sacrificed its dignity, and the general cause of monarchs, to petty aggrandizements.\" Whenever he followed with his finger the traces of the Prussian frontiers upon the map, he seemed to be angry at seeing them still so extensive, and exclaimed, \"Is it possible that I have left this man so large a territory?\"  This dislike to a"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18125"],["title","The Audacious War (#1)"],["body","final chapter, which naturally follows after that treating of the lessons for the United States from this war.  Only in an international organization, with power to make decrees of peace and enforce them, and with insurance of powers above those of all dissenters, can we find the peace of nations as we have found the peace of cities.  This Audacious War has forced such an alliance as can yield this power.  Its transfer to the support of an International tribunal can make and keep the peace of Europe and eventually of the world.

WHAT PEACE SHOULD MEAN     THE AUDACIOUS WAR   CHAPTER I  THE WORLD'S GREATEST CONTEST  The Censorship--The Warship \"Audacious\"--Mine or Torpedo?--The Battle Line--War by Gasolene Motors--The Boys from Canada--The Audacity of it.  The war of 1914 is not only the greatest war in history but the greatest in the political and economic sciences.  Indeed, it is the greatest war of all the sciences, for it involves all the known sciences of earth, ocean, and the skies.  To get the military, the political, and especially the financial flavor of this war, to study its probable duration and its financial consequences, was the object of a trip to England and France from which the writer has recently returned.  One can hear \"war news\" from the time he leaves the American coast and begins to pick up the line of the British warships--England's far-flung battle line--until he returns to the dock, but thorough investigation would convince a trained news man that most of this war gossip is erroneous.  This war is so vast and wide, from causes so powerful and deep, and will be so far-reaching in its effects that no ill-considered or partial statements concerning it should be made by any responsible writer.  The difficulty of obtaining the exact facts by any ordinary methods is very great.  There is a strict supervision of all news, and to insure that by news sources no \"aid or comfort\" is given to the enemy, a vast amount of pertinent, legitimate, and harmless news and data is necessarily suppressed.  The censors are military men and not news men, and act from the standpoint that a million facts had better be suppressed than that a single report should be helpful to the enemy. Only in Russia are reports of news men from the firing line allowed.  One hears abroad continually of the battle of the Marne, of the battle of the Aisne, of the contest at Ypres, and the fight on the Yser, but no outside man has yet been permitted to describe any of these in detail, or to give the strategy, beginning, end, or boundaries of them, or even the distinct casualties therefrom.  Indeed, it is doubtful if the official histories, when they are written, can do this, for these are the emphasized portions of one great and continuous battle that went on for more than one hundred days.  To illustrate the strength of the hand on the English war news, it may be noted that there is no mention permitted in the English press of such a ship as the \"Audacious.\"  Yet American papers with photographs of the \"Audacious\" as she sinks in the ocean are sold in London and on the Continent.  Outside of London not ten per cent of the people know anything concerning this boat or her finish.  This word \"finish\" would be disputed in any newspaper or well-informed financial office in London where it is daily declared that although the \"Audacious\" met with an accident, her guns have been raised and will go aboard another ship of the same size, purchased, or just being finished, and named the \"Audacious.\"  Indeed, I was informed on \"good authority\" that the \"Audacious\" was afloat, had been towed into Birkenhead and that the repairs to her bottom were nearly finished. You can hear similar stories wherever the \"accident\" is discussed.  I have heard it so many times that I ought to believe it.  Yet if one hundred people separately and individually make assurances concerning something of which they have no personal knowledge, it does not go down with a true news man.  I was able to run across a man who saw the affair of the \"Audacious.\"  He laughed at the stories of shallow water and raised guns.  His position was such, both then and thereafter, that I was sure that he knew and told me the truth.  Later I learned that the \"Audacious\" was too far off the Irish coast to permit of talk of shallow water, and that neither guns nor 30,000-ton warships are raised from fifty-fathom depths.  Yet I am willing to narrate what has not been permitted publication in England, and I think not elsewhere: that the mines about Lough Swilly, along the Scotch and Irish coasts, and in the Irish Sea, were laid with the assistance of English fishing-boats flying the English flag.  These boats had been captured by the Germans and impressed into this work.  There are also stories of Irish boats and Norwegian trawlers in this work, but I secured no confirmation of such reports.  It is still unsettled in British Admiralty circles as to whether the \"Audacious\" came in contact with a mine or torpedo from a German submarine.  Two of her crew report that they saw the wake of a torpedo. Reports that the periscope of a submarine showed above the water I have reason to reject.  English reports were suppressed--the admiralty claimed this right, since there was no loss of life--in the belief that if the ship was torpedoed by a submarine, the Germans would give out the first report, and thereby be of assistance in determining the cause.  But to-day the Germans have their doubt as to where the \"Audacious\" is, and as to whether or not she was ever really sunk.  Expert opinion is divided in authoritative circles in England as to the cause of the disaster; but more than 400 mines have been swept up along the Irish and Scotch coasts by the English mine sweepers.  While upon this subject, I ought to narrate that the study of this topic has convinced me that the Germans have a long task if they hope within a reasonable number of months to reduce by submarine torpedo practice the efficiency of the English navy to a basis that will warrant German warships coming forth to battle.  Every battleship is protected by four destroyers.  Submarines, when detected, are the most easily destroyed craft.  They have no protection against even a well-directed rifle bullet.  Their whole protection is that of invisibility.  Their plan of operation is to reach a position during the night, whence in the early morning they can single out an unprotected warship or cruiser not in motion, and launch against her side a well-directed torpedo, before being discovered.  The place for England's battleships is where they are: in the harbors with their protecting nets down until they are called for in battle. In motion or action, submarines have little show against them.  The Japanese at Port Arthur found that protecting nets picked up many torpedoes and submarines.  Since that time, torpedoes have been made with cutting heads to pierce steel nets encircling the warships, but their effectiveness has not so far been practically demonstrated.  It is Kitchener's idea to keep the enemy guessing.  Therefore he was rather pleased than otherwise when the story of Russians coming through England from Archangel was told all over the world.  The War Office winked at the story and certainly had no objection to the Germans getting a good dose of it.  I think that story might have been helpful at the time when the Allies were at their weakest, but they do not now need Russians, or stories of Russians, from Archangel.  The story must also go by the board that a submarine north of Ireland meant either a new type of boat that could go so far from Germany, or an unknown base nearer Scotland.  Submarines as now built could go from Germany around the British Isles and then across the Atlantic--in fair weather.  The eastern boundary of France divides itself into four very nearly equal sections.  Italy and Switzerland are the lower quarters of this boundary line; and of the upper quarters Belgium is the larger and Germany the smaller.  The southern half of the German quarter boundary is a mountain range and on the open sections stand the great fortifications of France and Germany, regarded by both countries as practically impregnable.  The defence of France on the Belgian frontier was the treaty which guaranteed the neutrality of the smaller country.  When Germany's conquering hosts came through Belgium, the war soon became a battle of human beings rather than of fortifications.  Neither the French nor the Germans had learned from practical experience the modern art of fighting human legions in ground trenches, but both sides quickly betook themselves to this rabbit method of warfare.  To-day from Switzerland to the North Sea is a double wall of 4,000,000 men, all fighting, not only for their own existence but for the existence of their nationality--their national ideals.  They are protected by aeroplanes, flying above, that keep watch of any large movements.  They are backed by 4,000,000 men in reserve and training who keep the trenches filled with fighting men, as 10,000 to 20,000 daily retire to mother earth, to the hospitals, or to the camps of the imprisoned.  On the North Sea and the English Channel they are supported by fleets of battleships, cruisers, submarines, and torpedo boat destroyers that"]]]
