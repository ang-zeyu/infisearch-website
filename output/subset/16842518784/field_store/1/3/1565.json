I don't know what became of my friends Hugh and Bill.  They were just beside me, but when I looked around both were gone.  A shell landed just at the side of me, and I think Hugh and Bill were blown to pieces.  I got my wound in the chest and the fragment came out through my back.  I thought my last day had come.  I dropped into a hole, and no sooner had I got in, than Mack got it through the face.  He was able to go back, but I was simply helpless, as my legs refused to move.  Anyhow, I pulled the shovel off my back and dug a little ridge in the side of the trench.  No sooner had I done this than Fritz started to bombard.  One shell fell in the hole in which I was, but exploded in the opposite direction.  Then another came and landed just above my head, but it failed to go off. Had it gone off I never would have been here now.  I had prayed hard to my God to deliver me from my enemies and when those things happened I felt my prayer was heard and that I was going to come through.  I was there in that hole all day and the next night before anyone came near me.  At last one of the 19th Battalion chaps came along and went for a stretcher for me.\"   Such are the varying impressions which a battle makes upon various men. It is no romance, but a grim reality of life and death.  Far into the night we lie awake and ask ourselves, what is the meaning of it all?  At first on the field of battle one thrills at the sound of mighty and unearthly forces loosed, but in the din we suddenly realize that boys are dying all about us, and that these guns bear swift death and mangling to suffering men.  Between us and the enemy are just a few deep shell holes and a thin red line of flesh and blood, as a human rampart, formed of men who hold their lives in their hands, ready to make the great sacrifice.  Behind us are the hidden guns and the support trenches in the narrow strip of hard-won territory.  Behind these are the moving columns on the long roads, the pulsing arteries of traffic, and the moving troop trains on the rails.  Behind these in turn are the plying ships, the millions of toiling workers, and the suffering hearts of the nations in arms.  Whole nations--yes, almost the whole of humanity--are organized for war and dragged into deadly conflict as by some devil's behest, instead of being organized for brotherhood and the building of a better world.  Oh, not for this devil's work were men made.  Surely mankind must come to its own in these birth pangs of a new era.  Never, never again must a whole humanity of the free-born sons of God be dragged into the hell of war to sate the pride or pomp of kings, or to glut the ambition of scheming secret groups who have taught men that they are created as obedient slaves.  Far behind us, marking the slow advance up this ridge of death, are the sheltered cemeteries of white crosses that tell the price that has already been paid.  There are five thousand crowded graves in yonder acre alone.  Great is the price, awful in its solid weight of agony. This is no longer a war between two peoples, but between two principles; it is as much to free the German people as to protect ourselves.  It is not for this narrow strip of hard-won soil, but for every foot of a world that from henceforth must be free.  The men who are fighting on grounds of moral principle would rather pay any price than lie at ease under the false shadow of militarism, materialism, and grasping greed.  These men are fighting, and many of them know that they are fighting, for a new world.  Not only military oppression, but industrial oppression, must go.  Not only German militarism, and Russian autocracy, and Turkish cruelty must be done away; but American materialism must be purged in the fiery furnace of this war.  Its purposes will reach far beyond our ken, and though man's sin alone has caused the war, its issues are in the hands of God.  The whole war has been a demonstration of the result of leaving God out of His world. The world with God left out leaves war; and life with God left out leaves hell.  There must be a turning to God in our own national life.  We speak of the menace of German militarism, but what is militarism but armed and aggressive materialism, the deeper principle which lies behind it?  And what is materialism but organized selfishness?  Materialism and selfishness are the dangers of our own land as well as of Germany.  And the war is a call to set our own house in order.  America can no longer live to herself alone.  She is fighting for the freedom of humanity.  Here on the very field of battle, at the throbbing heart of the conflict, we ask ourselves, What is the real issue of the war?  What are they fighting for?  Away there in Austria a young crown prince, Francis Ferdinand, was murdered.  It was the spark which set off the powder mine of Europe. But not for him are they fighting.  Behind him stood the two contending forces of the growing nationalism of Serbia and the expanding commercialism of Austria.  These two forces clashed in conflict, but not for them are they fighting.  Behind these stood two greater powers, those of pan-Germanism and pan-Slavism, a growing Germany and a rising Russia, which like a vast glacier for a thousand years had sought the open sea.  The ambitions of these two powers clashed in conflict at Constantinople and elsewhere.  But not for them are they fighting.  On the western front there were two deeper principles in conflict, those of autocracy and democracy, the question whether one man and a sinister, hidden group of plotting militarists could drag the whole world into war and crush its liberties and its laws beneath the iron heel of despotism, or whether man as man should stand erect in his God-given right of freedom and work out his own destiny in friendly brotherhood.  But behind even the great conflict between autocracy and democracy lay a yet deeper issue.  In the last analysis the final question in human life is between a material and a spiritual interpretation of the universe, whether might makes right and the strong are to rule, or whether right makes might and the moral order is supreme.  There is a material and a spiritual side of life.  On this side is the brute struggle for life; on that, the struggle for the life of others; on the one hand, the fight for the survival of the fittest, and on the other, the fight to make men fit to survive.  On the left hand is selfishness and on the right service; on the one side are the red battlefields of the enemy, and on the other is a cross red in sacrifice of a life laid down in the serving and saving of men.  There is a final issue in the world between passion and principle, between wrong and right, between darkness and light, between mammon and God, between self and Christ.  This ultimate issue must be faced by individuals and by nations.  It is the challenge which confronts men in this war.  Seventy years ago a crushed Europe faced the issue in the prophetic words of Mazzini, written in the hour of darkness and defeat:   \"Our victory is certain; I declare it with the profoundest conviction, here in exile, and precisely when monarchical reaction appears most insolently secure.  What matters the triumph of an hour?  What matters it that by concentrating all your means of action, availing yourselves of every artifice, turning to your account those prejudices and jealousies of race which yet for a while endure, and spreading distrust, egotism, and corruption, you have repulsed our forces and restored the former order of things?  Can you restore men's faith in it, or think you can long maintain it by brute force alone, now that all faith in it is extinct?  Threatened and undermined on every side, can you hold all Europe forever in a stage of siege?\" [1]   Pasteur sees the same issue looming even in his day and states it in burning words at the close of his life:   \"Two contrary laws seem to be wrestling with each other nowadays, the one a law of blood and of death, ever seeking new means of destruction and forcing nations to be constantly ready for the battlefield; the other a law of peace, work, and health, ever evolving new means of delivering man from the scourges which beset him.  The first seeks violent conquests, the other the relief of humanity.  The latter places one human life above any victory, while the former would sacrifice hundreds and thousands of lives to the ambition of one.  Which of these two laws will ultimately prevail God only knows.  We will have tried, by obeying the laws of humanity, to extend the frontiers of Life.\" [2]  Lincoln faced the same issue in the midst of the war weariness of our own great conflict with words which come back to the nation now with a prophetic call:   \"The world will little note, nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here.  It is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced.  It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us--that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion--that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain--that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom, and that government of the people, by the people, for the people shall not perish from the earth.\"   [1] Life and Writings of Mazzini, vol. v, pp. 269-271.

For miles away over the rolling country the golden harvests of France are ripening in the sun, broken by patches of green field, forest, and stream.  The reapers are gathering in the grain.  Only old men, women, and children are left to do the work, for the sons "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18328"],["title","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung and the Fall of the Niblungs (#1)"],["body","ut,     And sang as mid the woodways sings the summer-hidden ford:     There were gold-rings God-fashioned, and many a Dwarf-wrought sword,     And many a Queen-wrought kirtle and many a written spear;     So came they to the acres, and drew the threshold near,     And amidst of the garden blossoms, on the grassy, fruit-grown land,     Was Volsung the King of the Wood-world with his sons on either hand;     Therewith down lighted Siggeir the lord of a mighty folk,     Yet showed he by King Volsung as the bramble by the oak,     Nor reached his helm to the shoulder of the least of Volsung's sons.     And so into the hall they wended, the Kings and their mighty ones;     And they dight the feast full glorious, and drank through the       death of the day,     Till the shadowless moon rose upward, till it wended white away;     Then they went to the gold-hung beds, and at last for an hour or twain     Were all things still and silent, save a flaw of the summer rain.      But on the morrow noontide when the sun was high and bare,     More glorious was the banquet, and now was Signy there,     And she sat beside King Siggeir, a glorious bride forsooth;     Ruddy and white was she wrought as the fair-stained sea-beast's tooth,     But she neither laughed nor spake, and her eyes were hard and cold,     And with wandering side-long looks her lord would she behold.     That saw Sigmund her brother, the eldest Volsung son,     And oft he looked upon her, and their eyes met now and anon,     And ruth arose in his heart, and hate of Siggeir the Goth,     And there had he broken the wedding, but for plighted promise and       troth.     But those twain were beheld of Siggeir, and he deemed of the       Volsung kin,     That amid their might and their malice small honour should he win;     Yet thereof made he no semblance, but abided times to be     And laughed out with the loudest, amid the hope and the glee.     And nought of all saw Volsung, as he dreamed of the coming glory,     And how the Kings of his kindred should fashion the round world's       story.      So round about the Branstock they feast in the gleam of the gold;     And though the deeds of man-folk were not yet waxen old,     Yet had they tales for songcraft, and the blossomed garth of rhyme;     Tales of the framing of all things and the entering in of time     From the halls of the outer heaven; so near they knew the door.     Wherefore uprose a sea-king, and his hands that loved the oar     Now dealt with the rippling harp-gold, and he sang of the shaping       of earth,     And how the stars were lighted, and where the winds had birth,     And the gleam of the first of summers on the yet untrodden grass.     But e'en as men's hearts were hearkening some heard the thunder pass     O'er the cloudless noontide heaven; and some men turned about     And deemed that in the doorway they heard a man laugh out.     Then into the Volsung dwelling a mighty man there strode,     One-eyed and seeming ancient, yet bright his visage glowed:     Cloud-blue was the hood upon him, and his kirtle gleaming-grey     As the latter morning sundog when the storm is on the way:     A bill he bore on his shoulder, whose mighty ashen beam     Burnt bright with the flame of the sea and the blended silver's gleam.     And such was the guise of his raiment as the Volsung elders had told     Was borne by their fathers' fathers, and the first that warred in       the wold.      So strode he to the Branstock nor greeted any lord,     But forth from his cloudy raiment he drew a gleaming sword,     And smote it deep in the tree-bole, and the wild hawks overhead     Laughed 'neath the naked heaven as at last he spake and said:     \"Earls of the Goths, and Volsungs, abiders on the earth,     Lo there amid the Branstock a blade of plenteous worth!     The folk of the war-wand's forgers wrought never better steel     Since first the burg of heaven uprose for man-folk's weal.     Now let the man among you whose heart and hand may shift     To pluck it from the oakwood e'en take it for my gift.     Then ne'er, but his own heart falter, its point and edge shall fail     Until the night's beginning and the ending of the tale.     Be merry Earls of the Goth-folk, O Volsung Sons be wise,     And reap the battle-acre that ripening for you lies:     For they told me in the wild wood, I heard on the mountain side,     That the shining house of heaven is wrought exceeding wide,     And that there the Early-comers shall have abundant rest     While Earth grows scant of great ones, and fadeth from its best,     And fadeth from its midward and groweth poor and vile:--     All hail to thee King Volsung! farewell for a little while!\"      So sweet his speaking sounded, so wise his words did seem,     That moveless all men sat there, as in a happy dream     We stir not lest we waken; but there his speech had end,     And slowly down the hall-floor, and outward did he wend;     And none would cast him a question or follow on his ways,     For they knew that the gift was Odin's, a sword for the world to       praise.      But now spake Volsung the King: \"Why sit ye silent and still?     Is the Battle-Father's visage a token of terror and ill?     Arise O Volsung Children, Earls of the Goths arise,     And set your hands to the hilts as mighty men and wise!     Yet deem it not too easy; for belike a fateful blade     Lies there in the heart of the Branstock for a fated warrior made.\"      Now therewith spake King Siggeir: \"King Volsung give me a grace     To try it the first of all men, lest another win my place     And mere chance-hap steal my glory and the gain that I might win.\"      Then somewhat laughed King Volsung, and he said: \"O Guest, begin;     Though herein is the first as the last, for the Gods have long to live,     Nor hath Odin yet forgotten unto whom the gift he would give.\"      Then forth to the tree went Siggeir, the Goth-folk's mighty lord,     And laid his hand on the gemstones, and strained at the glorious sword     Till his heart grew black with anger; and never a word he said     As he wended back to the high-seat: but Signy waxed blood-red     When he sat him adown beside her; and her heart was nigh to break     For the shame and the fateful boding: and therewith King Volsung spake:      \"Thus comes back empty-handed the mightiest King of Earth,     And how shall the feeble venture? yet each man knows his worth;     And today may a great beginning from a little seed upspring     To o'erpass many a great one that hath the name of King:     So stand forth free and unfree; stand forth both most and least:     But first ye Earls of the Goth-folk, ye lovely lords we feast.\"      Upstood the Earls of Siggeir, and each man drew anigh     And deemed his time was coming for a glorious gain and high;     But for all their mighty shaping and their deeds in the battle-wood,     No looser in the Branstock that gift of Odin stood.     Then uprose Volsung's homemen, and the fell-abiding folk;     And the yellow-headed shepherds came gathering round the Oak,     And the searchers of the thicket and the dealers with the oar:     And the least and the worst of them all was a mighty man of war.     But for all their mighty shaping, and the struggle and the strain     Of their hands, the deft in labour, they tugged thereat in vain;     And still as the shouting and jeers, and the names of men and the       laughter     Beat backward from gable to gable, and rattled o'er roof-tree and       rafter,     Moody and still sat Siggeir; for he said: \"They have trained me here     As a mock for their woodland bondsmen; and yet shall they buy it dear.\"      Now the tumult sank a little, and men cried on Volsung the King     And his sons, the hedge of battle, to try the fateful thing.     So Volsung laughed, and answered: \"I will set me to the toil,     Lest these my guests of the Goth-folk should deem I fear the foil.     Yet nought am I ill-sworded, and the oldest friend is best;     And this, my hand's first fellow, will I bear to the grave-mound's       rest,     Nor wield meanwhile another: Yea this shall I have in hand     When mid the host of Odin in the Day of Doom I stand.\"      Therewith from his belt of battle he raised the golden sheath,     And showed the peace-strings glittering about the hidden death:     Then he laid his hand on the Branstock, and cried: \"O tree beloved,     I thank thee of thy good-heart that so little thou art moved:     Abide thou thus, green bower, when I am dead and gone     And the best of all my kindred a better day hath won!\"      Then as a young man laughed he, and on the hilts of gold     His hand, the battle-breaker, took fast and certain hold,     And long he drew and strained him, but mended not the tale,     Yet none the more thereover his mirth of heart did fail;     But he wended to the high-seat and thence began to cry:      \"Sons I have gotten and cherished, now stand ye forth to try;     Lest Odin tell in God-home how from the way he strayed,     And how to the man he would not he gave away his blade.\"     So therewithal rose Rerir, and wasted might and main;     Then Gunthiof, and then Hunthiof, they wearied them in vain;     Nought was the might of Agnar; nought Helgi could avail;     Sigi the tall and Solar no further brought the tale,     Nor Geirmund the priest of the temple, nor Gylfi of the wood.      At last by the side of the Branstock Sigmund the Volsung stood,     And with right hand wise in battle the precious sword-hilt caught,     Yet in a careless fashion, as he deemed it all for nought:     When lo, from floor to rafter went up a shattering shout,     For aloft in the hand of Sigmund the naked blade shone out     As high o'er his head he shook it: for the sword had come away     From the grip of the heart of the Branstock, as though all loose       it lay.     A little while he stood there mid the glory of the hall,     Like the best of the"]]]
