Safe outside the shielding, in a corner of a high-ceilinged room, was the plyboard-screened on-the-job office of the Melroy Engineering Corporation's timekeepers and foremen. Beyond, along the far wall, were the washroom and locker room and lunch room of the workmen.  Sixty or seventy men, mostly in white coveralls and all wearing identification badges and carrying dosimeters in their breast pockets and midget Geigers strapped to their wrists, were crowded about the bulletin-board in front of the makeshift office. There was a hum of voices--some perplexed or angry, but mostly good-humored and bantering. As Melroy and Doris Rives approached, the talking died out and the men turned. In the sudden silence, one voice, harshly strident, continued:  \"... do they think this is, anyhow? We don't hafta take none of that.\"  Somebody must have nudged the speaker, trying without success to hush him. The bellicose voice continued, and Melroy spotted the speaker--short, thick-set, his arms jutting out at an angle from his body, his heavy features soured with anger.  \"Like we was a lotta halfwits, 'r nuts, 'r some'n! Well, we don't hafta stand for this. They ain't got no right--\"  Doris Rives clung tighter to Melroy's arm as he pushed a way for himself and her through the crowd and into the temporary office. Inside, they were met by a young man with a deputy marshal's badge on his flannel shirt and a .38 revolver on his hip.  \"Ben Puryear: Dr. Rives,\" Melroy introduced. \"Who's the mouthy character outside?\"  \"One of the roustabouts; name's Burris,\" Puryear replied. \"Wash-room lawyer.\"  Melroy nodded. \"You always get one or two like that. How're the rest taking it?\"  Puryear shrugged. \"About how you'd expect. A lot of kidding about who's got any intelligence to test. Burris seems to be the only one who's trying to make an issue out of it.\"  \"Well, what are they doing ganged up here?\" Melroy wanted to know. \"It's past oh-eight-hundred; why aren't they at work?\"  \"Reactor's still too hot. Temperature and radioactivity both too high; radioactivity's still up around eight hundred REM's.\"  \"Well, then, we'll give them all the written portion of the test together, and start the personal interviews and oral tests as soon as they're through.\" He turned to Doris Rives. \"Can you give all of them the written test together?\" he asked. \"And can Ben help you--distributing forms, timing the test, seeing that there's no fudging, and collecting the forms when they're done?\"  \"Oh, yes; all they'll have to do is follow the printed instructions.\" She looked around. \"I'll need a desk, and an extra chair for the interview subject.\"  \"Right over here, doctor.\" Puryear said. \"And here are the forms and cards, and the sound-recorder, and blank sound disks.\"  \"Yes,\" Melroy added. \"Be sure you get a recording of every interview and oral test; we may need them for evidence.\"  He broke off as a man in white coveralls came pushing into the office. He was a scrawny little fellow with a wide, loose-lipped mouth and a protuberant Adam's apple; beside his identity badge, he wore a two-inch celluloid button lettered: I.F.A.W. STEWARD.  \"Wanta use the phone,\" he said. \"Union business.\"  Melroy gestured toward a telephone on the desk beside him. The newcomer shook his head, twisting his mouth into a smirk.  \"Not that one; the one with the whisper mouthpiece,\" he said. \"This is private union business.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Melroy shrugged and indicated another phone. The man with the union steward's badge picked it up, dialed, and held a lengthy conversation into it, turning his head away in case Melroy might happen to be a lip reader. Finally he turned.  \"Mr. Crandall wants to talk to you,\" he said, grinning triumphantly, the phone extended to Melroy.  The engineer picked up another phone, snapping a button on the base of it.  \"Melroy here,\" he said.  Something on the line started going _bee-beep-beep_ softly.  \"Crandall, executive secretary, I.F.A.W.,\" the man on the other end of the line identified himself. \"Is there a recorder going on this line?\"  \"Naturally,\" Melroy replied. \"I record all business conversations; office routine.\"  \"Mr. Melroy, I've been informed that you propose forcing our members in your employ to submit to some kind of a mental test. Is that correct?\"  \"Not exactly. I'm not able to force anybody to submit to anything against his will. If anybody objects to taking these tests, he can say so, and I'll have his time made out and pay him off.\"  \"That's the same thing. A threat of dismissal is coercion, and if these men want to keep their jobs they'll have to take this test.\"  \"Well, that's stated more or less correctly,\" Melroy conceded. \"Let's just put it that taking--and passing--this test is a condition of employment. My contract with your union recognizes my right to establish standards of intelligence; that's implied by my recognized right to dismiss any person of 'unsound mind, deficient mentality or emotional instability.' Psychological testing is the only means of determining whether or not a person is classifiable in those terms.\"  \"Then, in case the test purports to show that one of these men is, let's say, mentally deficient, you intend dismissing him?\"  \"With the customary two weeks' severance-pay, yes.\"  \"Well, if you do dismiss anybody on those grounds, the union will have to insist on reviewing the grounds for dismissal.\"  \"My contract with your union says nothing whatever about any right of review being reserved by the union in such cases. Only in cases of disciplinary dismissal, which this is not. I take the position that certain minimum standards of intelligence and mental stability are essentials in this sort of work, just as, say, certain minimum standards of literacy are essential in clerical work.\"  \"Then you're going to make these men take these tests, whatever they are?\"  \"If they want to work for me, yes. And anybody who fails to pass them will be dropped from my payroll.\"  \"And who's going to decide whether or not these men have successfully passed these tests?\" Crandall asked. \"You?\"  \"Good Lord, no! I'm an electronics engineer, not a psychologist. The tests are being given, and will be evaluated, by a graduate psychologist, Dr. D. Warren Rives, who has a diploma from the American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology and is a member of the American Psychological Association. Dr. Rives will be the final arbiter on who is or is not disqualified by these tests.\"  \"Well, our man Koffler says you have some girl there to give the tests,\" Crandall accused.  \"I suppose he means Dr. Rives,\" Melroy replied. \"I can assure you, she is an extremely competent psychologist, however. She came to me most highly recommended by Dr. Karl von Heydenreich, who is not inclined to be careless with his recommendations.\"  \"Well, Mr. Melroy, we don't want any more trouble with you than we have to have,\" Crandall told him, \"but we will insist on reviewing any dismissals which occur as a result of these tests.\"  \"You can do that. I'd advise, first, that you read over the contract you signed with me. Get a qualified lawyer to tell you what we've agreed to and what we haven't. Was there anything else you wanted to talk about?... No?... Then good morning, Mr. Crandall.\"  He hung up. \"All right; let's get on with it,\" he said. \"Ben, you get them into the lunch room; there are enough tables and benches in there for everybody to take the written test in two relays.\"  \"The union's gotta be represented while these tests is going on,\" the union steward announced. \"Mr. Crandall says I'm to stay here an' watch what you do to these guys.\"  \"This man working for us?\" Melroy asked Puryear.  \"Yes. Koffler, Julius. Electrical fitter; Joe Ricci's gang.\"  \"All right. See to it that he gets placed in the first relay for the written test, and gets first turn for the orals. That way he can spend the rest of his time on duty here for the union, and will know in advance what the test is like.\" He turned to Koffler. \"But understand this. You keep your mouth out of it. If you see anything that looks objectionable, make a note of it, but don't try to interfere.\"  The written tests, done on printed forms, required about twenty minutes. Melroy watched the process of oral testing and personal interviewing for a while, then picked up a big flashlight and dropped it into his overcoat pocket, preparatory to going out to inspect some equipment that had been assembled outside the reactor area and brought in. As he went out, Koffler was straddling a chair, glowering at Doris Rives and making occasional ostentatious notes on a pad.         *       *       *       *       *  For about an hour, he poked around the newly assembled apparatus, checking the wiring, and peering into it. When he returned to the temporary office, the oral testing was still going on; Koffler was still on duty as watcher for the union, but the sport had evidently palled on him, for he was now studying a comic book.  Melroy left the reactor area and returned to the office in the converted area. During the midafternoon, somebody named Leighton called him from the Atomic Power Authority executive office, wanting to know what was the trouble between him and the I.F.A.W. and saying that a protest against his alleged high-handed and arbitrary conduct had been received from the union.  Melroy explained, at length. He finished: \"You people have twenty Stuart tanks, and a couple of thousand soldiers and cops and undercover-men, here, guarding against sabotage. Don't you realize that a workman who makes stupid or careless or impulsive mistakes is just as dangerous to the plant as any saboteur? If somebody shoots you through the head, it doesn't matter whether he planned to murder you for a year or just didn't know the gun was loaded; you're as dead one way as the other. I should think you'd thank me for trying "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18953"],["title","The Tale of Dickie Deer Mouse (#1)"],["body"," doing here at this hour?\" Mr. Crow demanded at last.  \"I thought----\" Dickie began.  \"There you go again!\" the old gentleman interrupted him testily. \"I didn't ask you what you _thought_. I asked you what you were _doing_.\"  \"I'm not doing anything just now,\" Dickie Deer Mouse faltered.  \"Yes, you are!\" Mr. Crow corrected him. \"You're sitting on a limb of my tree.... Get off it at once!\"  So Dickie Deer Mouse moved to a more distant perch.  \"Now you're sitting on another!\" Mr. Crow exploded. \"Get out of my tree this instant!\" It always made him ill-tempered to be awakened from a sound sleep in the middle of the night.  Once more Dickie Deer Mouse asked his pardon.  \"I was told,\" he explained, \"that you had moved lately. And I did not expect to find you here.\"  \"Ah!\" said Mr. Crow. \"I know now why you came sneaking into my house. You'd like to live here yourself.\"  \"Pardon me!\" Dickie Deer Mouse exclaimed with the lowest of bows. \"You are mistaken, Mr. Crow. Though your house is a fine, large one, it's much too small to hold us both.\"  And whisking about, while Mr. Crow stared at him, he ran down the tall elm as fast as he could go.  It was clear that if Mr. Crow wasn't going to move he would have to look elsewhere for a summer home.  [Illustration]     [Illustration]  IV  THE BLACKBIRD'S NEST   For a few days after his visit to Mr. Crow's elm, Dickie Deer Mouse kept watch carefully of Mr. Crow's comings and goings. And he decided at last that the old gentleman liked his home too well to leave it.  But Dickie was not discouraged. He had no doubt that he could find some other pleasant quarters in which to spend the summer--quarters that would prove almost as airy, and perhaps more convenient--because they were not so high.  For there was no denying that Mr. Crow's nest was a long, long way from the ground.  So Dickie began to search for birds' nests. And for a time he had to suffer a great deal of scolding by his feathered neighbors. It must be confessed that they were none too fond of Dickie Deer Mouse. There was a story of something he was said to have done one time--a tale about his having driven a Robin family away from their nest, in order to live in it himself.  That seems a strange deed on the part of anyone so gentle as Dickie Deer Mouse. But old Mr. Crow always declared that it was true. And Solomon Owl often remarked that he wished Dickie Deer Mouse would try to drive _him_ away from his home in the hollow hemlock.  [Illustration: Dickie scampered through the woods with his friends]  But during his hunt for birds' nests Dickie Deer Mouse was careful to keep away from Solomon Owl, and his cousin Simon Screecher, and all the rest of the Owl family. He contented himself with hasty peeps into nests built by such smaller folk as Blackbirds and Robins. And if it happened that anybody was living in one of those nests, Dickie soon found it out. For the angry owners were sure to fly at him with screams of rage, and peck at his head as they darted past him.  It was really not worth while getting into a fight over a bird's nest, when there was plenty of old ones in which nobody dwelt. To be sure, many of them were almost ready to fall apart. But Dickie Deer Mouse finally found one to his liking--a last year's bird's nest where two Blackbirds had reared a promising family. They had not come back to Pleasant Valley. And there was their house, almost as good as new, just waiting for some one to move in and make himself at home.  Nobody objected when Dickie took the old nest for his home, though many a bird in the neighborhood remarked in his hearing that _he_ would hate to be too lazy to build a house for himself.  Dickie Deer Mouse was too mild and gentle-mannered to make any reply to such rude speeches. Besides, he expected to make a good many changes in the old nest before the place was exactly what he wanted.  \"I don't understand,\" he said aloud to nobody in particular, \"why most birds don't know how a house should be built. Of all the birds in Pleasant Valley the only good nest-builder I know is Long Bill Wren. He must be a very sensible fellow, because he puts a roof on his house.\"  Now, Dickie Deer Mouse may--or may not--have known that some of his bird neighbors were near at hand, watching him. Certainly they must have heard what he said, for they began to scold at the top of their voices. And one rude listener named Jasper Jay screamed with fine scorn:  \"What do you know about building a nest?\" And then he laughed harshly.  But Dickie Deer Mouse only looked very wise and said nothing.  [Illustration]     [Illustration]  V  DICKIE'S SUMMER HOME   Dickie Deer Mouse was busier than ever. When he wasn't looking for food--and eating it when he had found it--he gathered cat-tail down in Cedar Swamp.  If there was one thing that he liked in a house it was a soft bed. And he knew that if the weather happened to be chilly now and then, he could snuggle into the cat-tail down and sleep as comfortably as he pleased.  The swamp was none too near his new home; and he might have found moss or shreds of bark near-by that would have served his purpose. But he would rather have cat-tail down, even though he had to make a good many trips back and forth before he finally lined the old bird's nest to his liking.  Then, having finished his bed, he had to make a roof over it. So he covered the top of his house with moss, leaving a hole right under the eaves, for a doorway.  When Dickie's home was done he was so pleased with it that he asked all his neighbors if they didn't like his \"improvements,\" as he called the additions he had made. And all his Deer Mouse relations told him that he certainly had a fine place.  But none of the birds cared for it at all, except Long Bill Wren; and even he remarked that the house would be better \"if it was rounder.\"  As for Jasper Jay, he told Dickie Deer Mouse that, in his opinion, the house was ruined.  \"It's nothing but a trap,\" he declared. \"And I'd hate to go to sleep inside it.\"  His views, however, did not trouble Dickie Deer Mouse in the least. The place suited him. And he was so happy in it that sometimes when the weather was bad and he wasn't whisking about in the trees, or scurrying around on the ground, he would stay inside his cozy home, with only his head sticking out through the doorway, while his big, bright, bulging, black eyes took in everything that happened in his dooryard.  Dickie Deer Mouse knew that one needed sharp eyes to spy him when he was peeping from his house in that fashion. And often when somebody of whom he was really afraid came wandering through the woods, Dickie would keep quite still, while he watched the newcomer without being seen.  But with some of the wood folk he took no chances. Whenever he heard Solomon Owl's rolling call, or his cousin Simon Screecher's quavering whistle, Dickie Deer Mouse always pulled his head inside his house in a hurry.  For they were usually on the lookout for him. And he knew it.  Of course, if they had been aware that Dickie Deer Mouse was hidden inside his rebuilt, last year's bird's nest, either of them, with his sharp claws, could easily have torn the moss roof off Dickie's home. But luckily for Dickie, there were some things that they didn't know.  [Illustration]     [Illustration]  VI  A WARNING   If old Mr. Crow had minded his own affairs everything would have gone well with Dickie Deer Mouse, after he moved into his new home. But Mr. Crow could not forget the time when Dickie had awakened him out of a sound sleep and frightened him almost out of his mind.  So whenever he caught sight of Dickie the old gentleman was sure to drop down upon the ground and ask him in a loud voice whose house he had prowled into lately.  \"Nobody's!\" Dickie Deer Mouse always told him. And then he would assure Mr. Crow that he was very sorry to have disturbed his rest.  It was quite like Mr. Crow, on such occasions, to act grumpy.  \"I haven't had a good night's sleep since you broke into my house,\" he declared to Dickie one day.  \"Perhaps you're over-eating,\" Dickie suggested politely.  Old Mr. Crow did not appear to like that remark.  \"Nothing of the sort!\" he bawled. \"I don't eat enough to keep a mosquito alive.\"  \"I often see you in the cornfield,\" Dickie Deer Mouse told him.  \"Ha!\" Mr. Crow exclaimed. \"What are you doing in the cornfield, I should like to know?\"  \"Sometimes I go there to get a few kernels of corn,\" Dickie explained.  \"Ha!\" Mr. Crow cried once more. \"That's where the corn's going! Farmer Green thinks I'm taking it. And so you're getting me into a peck of trouble, young man.\"  Dickie Deer Mouse couldn't help being worried when Mr. Crow said that. And he looked puzzled, too.  \"I don't see,\" he said, \"how I could have got you into a _peck_ of trouble, Mr. Crow, for I haven't eaten a peck of Farmer Green's corn. I've had only a few kernels of it--not more than half a pint.\"  \"Then you've got me into a half-pint of trouble, anyway,\" old Mr. Crow insisted. \"And that's too much, for a person of my age. You'll have to keep away from my--ahem!--from Farmer Green's cornfield. And what's more, Fatty Coon says the same thing.\"  At the mention of Fatty Coon's name Dickie Deer Mouse had to smile.  \"Fatty Coon!\" he echoed. \"How he does like corn!\"  \"Yes! But he doesn't like you,\" Mr. Crow snapped. \"You'd better look out for him,\" he warned Dickie. \"He'll come to call on you some night, the first thing you know.  \"By the way, where are you living now?\" Mr. Crow inquired.  But Dickie Deer Mouse made no answer. Right before Mr. Crow's sharp eyes he vanished among the roots of a tree. And it made the old gentleman quite peevish because he couldn't discover where Dickie Deer Mouse had hidden himself.  For a little while Mr. Crow stood like a black statue and peered at the tangle where Dickie Deer Mouse had disappeared. But Mr. Crow couldn't see him anywhere. And at last his patience came to an end.  \"He never answered my question,\" Mr. Crow "]]]
