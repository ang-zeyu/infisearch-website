Yea, I am the hired of Odin, his workday will to speed,     And the harvest-tide shall be heavy.--What then, were it come and past     And I laid by the last of the sheaves with my wages earned at the last?      He lifted his eyes as he thought it, for now was he come to his place,     And there he stood by his father and met Siggeir face to face,     And he saw him blithe and smiling, and heard him how he spake:     \"O best of the sons of Volsung, I am merry for thy sake     And the glory that thou hast gained us; but whereas thine hand and       heart     Are e'en now the lords of the battle, how lack'st thou for thy part     A matter to better the best? Wilt thou overgild fine gold     Or dye the red rose redder? So I prithee let me hold     This sword that comes to thine hand on the day I wed thy kin.     For at home have I a store-house; there is mountain-gold therein     The weight of a war-king's harness; there is silver plenteous store;     There is iron, and huge-wrought amber, that the southern men love sore,     When they sell me the woven wonder, the purple born of the sea;     And it hangeth up in that bower; and all this is a gift for thee:     But the sword that came to my wedding, methinketh it meet and right,     That it lie on my knees in the council and stead me in the fight.\"      But Sigmund laughed and answered, and he spake a scornful word:     \"And if I take twice that treasure, will it buy me Odin's sword,     And the gift that the Gods have given? will it buy me again to stand     Betwixt two mightiest world-kings with a longed-for thing in mine hand     That all their might hath missed of? when the purple-selling men     Come buying thine iron and amber, dost thou sell thine honour then?     Do they wrap it in bast of the linden, or run it in moulds of earth?     And shalt thou account mine honour as a matter of lesser worth?     Came the sword to thy wedding, Goth-king, to thine hand it never came,     And thence is thine envy whetted to deal me this word of shame.\"      Black then was the heart of Siggeir, but his face grew pale and red,     Till he drew a smile thereover, and spake the word and said:     \"Nay, pardon me, Signy's kinsman! when the heart desires o'ermuch     It teacheth the tongue ill speaking, and my word belike was such.     But the honour of thee and thy kindred, I hold it even as mine,     And I love you as my heart-blood, and take ye this for a sign.     I bid thee now King Volsung, and these thy glorious sons,     And thine earls and thy dukes of battle and all thy mighty ones,     To come to the house of the Goth-kings as honoured guests and dear     And abide the winter over; that the dusky days and drear     May be glorious with thy presence, that all folk may praise my life,     And the friends that my fame hath gotten; and that this my new-wed wife     Thine eyes may make the merrier till she bear my eldest born.\"     Then speedily answered Volsung: \"No king of the earth might scorn     Such noble bidding, Siggeir; and surely will I come     To look upon thy glory and the Goths' abundant home.     But let two months wear over, for I have many a thing     To shape and shear in the Woodland, as befits a people's king:     And thou meanwhile here abiding of all my goods shalt be free,     And then shall we twain together roof over the glass-green sea     With the sides of our golden dragons; and our war-hosts' blended       shields     Shall fright the sea-abiders and the folk of the fishy fields.\"      Answered the smooth-speeched Siggeir: \"I thank thee well for this,     And thy bidding is most kingly; yet take it not amiss     That I wend my ways in the morning; for we Goth-folk know indeed     That the sea is a foe full deadly, and a friend that fails at need,     And that Ran who dwells thereunder will many a man beguile:     And I bear a woman with me; nor would I for a while     Behold that sea-queen's dwelling; for glad at heart am I     Of the realm of the Goths and the Volsungs, and I look for long to lie     In the arms of the fairest woman that ever a king may kiss.     So I go mine house to order for the increase of thy bliss,     That there in nought but joyance all we may wear the days     And that men of the time hereafter the more our lives may praise.\"      And for all the words of Volsung e'en so must the matter be,     And Siggeir the Goth and Signy on the morn shall sail the sea.     But the feast sped on the fairer, and the more they waxed in disport     And the glee that all men love, as they knew that the hours were short.     Yet a boding heart bare Sigmund amid his singing and laughter;     And somewhat Signy wotted of the deeds that were coming after;     For the wisest of women she was, and many a thing she knew;     She would hearken the voice of the midnight till she heard what the       Gods would do,     And her feet fared oft on the wild, and deep was her communing     With the heart of the glimmering woodland, where never a fowl may sing.      So fair sped on the feasting amid the gleam of the gold,     Amid the wine and the joyance; and many a tale was told     To the harp-strings of that wedding, whereof the latter days     Yet hold a little glimmer to wonder at and praise.     Then the undark night drew over, and faint the high stars shone,     And there on the beds blue-woven the slumber-tide they won;     Yea while on the brightening mountain the herd-boy watched his sheep.     Yet soft on the breast of Signy King Siggeir lay asleep.       _How the Volsungs fared to the Land of the Goths, and of the fall of     King Volsung._      Now or ever the sun shone houseward, unto King Volsung's bed     Came Signy stealing barefoot, and she spake the word and said:     \"Awake and hearken, my father, for though the wedding be done,     And I am the wife of the Goth-king, yet the Volsungs are not gone.     So I come as a dream of the night, with a word that the Gods would say,     And think thou thereof in the day-tide, and let Siggeir go on his way     With me and the gifts and the gold, but do ye abide in the land,     Nor trust in the guileful heart and the murder-loving hand,     Lest the kin of the Volsungs perish, and the world be nothing worth.\"      So came the word unto Volsung, and wit in his heart had birth;     And he sat upright in the bed and kissed her on the lips;     But he said: \"My word is given, it is gone like the spring-tide ships:     To death or to life must I journey when the months are come to an end.     Yet my sons my words shall hearken, and shall nowise with me wend.\"      Then she answered, speaking swiftly: \"Nay, have thy sons with thee;     Gather an host together and a mighty company,     And meet the guile and the death-snare with battle and with wrack.\"      He said: \"Nay, my troth-word plighted e'en so should I draw aback:     I shall go a guest, as my word was; of whom shall I be afraid?     For an outworn elder's ending shall no mighty moan be made.\"      Then answered Signy, weeping: \"I shall see thee yet again     When the battle thou arrayest on the Goth-folks' strand in vain.     Heavy and hard are the Norns: but each man his burden bears;     And what am I to fashion the fate of the coming years?\"      She wept and she wended back to the Goth-king's bolster blue,     And Volsung pondered awhile till slumber over him drew;     But when once more he wakened, the kingly house was up,     And the homemen gathered together to drink the parting cup:     And grand amid the hall-floor was the Goth king in his gear,     And Signy clad for faring stood by the Branstock dear     With the earls of the Goths about her: so queenly did she seem,     So calm and ruddy coloured, that Volsung well might deem     That her words were a fashion of slumber, a vision of the night.     But they drank the wine of departing, and brought the horses dight,     And forth abroad the Goth-folk and the Volsung Children rode,     Nor ever once would Signy look back to that abode.      So down over acre and heath they rode to the side of the sea,     And there by the long-ships' bridges was the ship-host's company.     Then Signy kissed her brethren with ruddy mouth and warm,     Nor was there one of the Goth-folk but blessed her from all harm;     Then sweet she kissed her father and hung about his neck,     And sure she whispered him somewhat ere she passed forth toward the       deck,     Though nought I know to tell it: then Siggeir hailed them fair,     And called forth many a blessing on the hearts that bode his snare.     Then were the gangways shipped, and blown was the parting horn,     And the striped sails drew with the wind, and away was Signy borne     White on the shielded long-ship, a grief in the heart of the gold;     Nor once would she turn her about the strand of her folk to behold.      Thenceforward dwelt the Volsungs in exceeding glorious state,     And merry lived King Volsung, abiding the day of his fate;     But when the months aforesaid were well-nigh worn away     To his sons and his folk of counsel he fell these words to say:     \"Ye mind you of Signy's wedding and of my plighted troth     To go in two months' wearing to the house of Siggeir the Goth:     Nor will I hide how Signy then spake a warning word     And did me to wit that her husband was a grim and guileful lord,     And would draw us to our undoing for envy and despite     Concerning the Sword of Odin, and for dread of the Volsung might.     Now wise is Signy my daughter and knoweth nought but sooth:     Yet are there seasons and times when for longing and self-ruth     The hearts of "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18329"],["title","The National Preacher, Vol. 2. No. 6., Nov. 1827 (#1)"],["body","immediately preached the gospel of their ascended Saviour in other great cities of the world.  Paul and Barnabas are found at Antioch, the capital of Pisidia. From Antioch they went to Iconium, the metropolis of Lyconia. Thence to Derbe, another city of Lyconia. In that embassy, they also preached at Lystra, and Perga, and many other cities. Soon after this, Paul said unto Barnabas, \"Let us go again, and visit our brethren in every city where we have preached the word of the Lord, and see how they do.\" Paul expressed an ardent desire to be at Jerusalem on the feast-days:--\"For he hasted, if it were possible for him, to be at Jerusalem, the day of Pentecost;\" for then thousands of strangers would be there assembled--\"Parthians, Medes, and Elamites, and the dwellers of Mesopotamia,\" and of many other places. In Rome, too, that imperial city, did this apostle continue for two years, preaching the gospel of Christ. There he established a Christian church, to which he addressed the noblest epistle ever written. Of Philip it is recorded, that \"passing through, he preached in all the cities, till he came to Cesarea.\" The apostles and disciples, then directed their attention very particularly to cities.   III. _Cities were the theatres of the Holy Spirit's first and most illustrious achievements._  Open the book of the Acts, and mark how and where the Spirit of God accompanied the labours of the apostles. It was at Jerusalem, the city whose million voices had just before demanded the death of their Lord, and imprecated his blood upon their own heads, that the first and greatest effusion of the Holy Spirit took place. _There_ was spiritual wickedness in high places. There iniquity was strongly intrenched. The strong arm of the civil as well as ecclesiastical power was its defence; and human calculation could look for no visits of mercy. Still the Savior's command, to begin at Jerusalem, was obeyed. Nor was it long before that city was filled with the presence of the Most High--before the Spirit came down in power, and thousands were converted to Christ.  But this is not a solitary case. At Antioch, also, the Spirit was poured out. Indeed, there are two places of this name mentioned in the Acts of the Apostles;--both visited in saving mercy. One, the capital of Syria, a city of great note. It was about ten miles in circumference; and, in population, wealth, and splendour, esteemed the third city of the age. Here Paul and Barnabas preached. Here the disciples were first called Christians. Here the Church continued long to flourish. Here the eloquent Chrysostom, at the close of the fourth century, preached with great power and success: and here the Holy Spirit descended. \"Now they, which were scattered abroad, upon the persecution that arose about Stephen, travelled as far as Phenice, and Cyprus, and Antioch, preaching the word to none but the Jews only. And some of them were men of Cyprus and Cyrene, which, when they were come to Antioch, spake unto the Grecians, preaching the Lord Jesus. And the hand of the Lord was with them: and a great number believed and turned unto the Lord. Then tidings of these things came unto the ears of the Church which was in Jerusalem; and they sent forth Barnabas, that he should go as far as Antioch. Who, when he came and had seen the grace of God, was glad, and exhorted them all, that with purpose of heart they would cleave unto the Lord.\" So great was this work, so important this field of usefulness, that to secure the best assistance, \"Barnabas departed to Tarsus to seek Saul; and when he had found him, he brought him unto Antioch. And it came to pass, that a whole year they assembled themselves with the church, and taught much people.\" So powerful was this work of God, as to demand, for a whole year, the special labours of two of his most favoured servants.  The other Antioch, mentioned in the Acts, was the capital of Pisidia; a place where many things opposed the advance of holiness. But there also Paul and Barnabas laboured; and there souls were born into the kingdom. The record is, \"They came to Antioch, in Pisidia, and went into the synagogue on the Sabbath day.\" And Paul preached of Jesus and the resurrection, and faithfully warned against lightly esteeming the work of God. \"Beware, therefore, lest that come upon you, which is spoken in the prophets: Behold, ye despisers, and wonder, and perish; for I work a work in your days, which ye shall in nowise believe though a man declare it unto you. And when the Jews were gone out of the synagogue, the Gentiles besought that these words might be preached unto them the next Sabbath. And the next Sabbath day came almost the whole city together, to hear the word of God. And when the Gentiles heard this, they were glad, and glorified the word of the Lord; and as many as were ordained to eternal life believed. And the word of the Lord was published throughout all the region, and the disciples were filled with joy and with the Holy Ghost.\"  Ephesus, too, was visited by the Holy Spirit. This was one of the most famous cities of Asia Minor. By historians, it has been called the ornament of Asia--the greatest and most frequented emporium of the continent. Here stood one of the seven wonders of the world--the idolatrous temple of Diana. Paul paid two visits to this city: the first, a very short one. After some months, he returned, and continued for three years, and had great success. Many things opposed the influence of truth. Iniquity was deeply rooted: their established religion was a source of revenue; and countenanced them in unhallowed courses. But the Spirit of grace prevailed. The result was, \"that many that believed, came, and confessed, and showed their deeds. Many of them, also, which used curious arts, brought their books together, and burned them before all men. And they counted the price of them, and found it fifty thousand pieces of silver;\" or, according to our currency, nearly twenty-eight thousand dollars. Thus multitudes made a public renunciation of idolatry, and a public profession of their faith in Christ. \"So mightily grew the word of God, and prevailed.\"  The last city that we shall mention, as blessed with a revival, is Corinth, the capital of Achaia. Here stood the temple of Venus; for the support of whose costly and debasing services, a thousand human victims were continually kept!--The multitude in this city were given to a species of crime, most deadening to the conscience, and damning to the soul. Yet all this did not discourage the intrepid apostle. For, about the year of our Lord fifty-two, he came to Corinth, and \"reasoned in the synagogue every Sabbath day, and persuaded the Jews and the Greeks.\" The persecuting spirit of the Jews was marshalled against him. Yet he was successful, for _God was with him_. \"Crispus, the chief ruler of the synagogue, believed on the Lord with all his house; and many of the Corinthians, hearing, believed and were baptized. Then spake the Lord to Paul in the night by a vision, Be not afraid, but speak, and hold not thy peace, for I am with thee, and no man shall set on thee to hurt thee; for I have much people in this city.\" And so great was the work, and so important the station, that \"he continued there a year and six months, teaching the word of God among them.\" Here a large church was gathered, to which he addressed two epistles.  We could mention other ancient cities as blessed with revivals. We could tell you of Athens, the eye and glory of Greece; of Philippi, the chief city of Macedonia; of Iconium, \"where a great multitude, both of the Jews and also of the Greeks, believed;\" of Rome too, and many others; but we forbear, since enough is already before you to illustrate the position, that cities were the theatres of the Holy Spirit's first and most illustrious achievements. Indeed, what is the book of the Acts, but one continued history of revivals in cities and populous places?   IV. _We should seek the conversion of Cities, because in them the Adversary reigns with peculiar power._  Experienced Generals bend their most powerful forces against those positions most strongly intrenched; well knowing, that if these are subdued, the courage of the enemy is daunted, his plans marred, and that what remains may fall an easy conquest. Why then should Christians leave to Satan the quiet dominion of cities? He would rather give up a thousand inland posts, than these strong holds of his empire. But, Oh, could he be dislodged from these, how paralyzed would be his arm--how feeble his resistance--how lost his influence! Would you see the power of Satan in cities? Cast your eye back upon the past. What were Sodom and Gomorrah? What were Tyre, and Sidon, and Ninevah? What was Babylon? What was Jerusalem in its latter days, when given up accursed of God? What were they, but sinks of pollution and fountains of ruin? And could we draw aside the curtains of darkness, what might we see in modern cities! Oh, the pollution, and dark waters, that are open to the eye of God! Oh, the thousand lures to vice! Oh, the frauds, the oppressions, the numberless wrongs, which break down the integrity of the young; which harden the middle-aged, and cover gray hairs with shame, and wretchedness, and ruin! Oh, the dissipations, over which custom has thrown an influence well nigh omnipotent! Oh, the tauntings, and the high looks, the stiff neck, and the contemptuous sneer, with which wealth and station conduct themselves towards the lowliness of Christian meekness! Oh, the power that nerves itself against holiness! Wealth and imposing splendour, eloquence and numbers, are in its ranks. Perjury and cruel mockings are among its weapons. Oh, the chains of darkness and gates of death, with which the strong man armed here holds his prisoners! How loudly then do these demand the commiseration and special effort of those, who would proclaim liberty to the captives, and life to the dead! And for the encouragement of the "]]]
