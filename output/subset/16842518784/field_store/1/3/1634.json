But still the old woman could hardly wait for him to finish, she was so anxious to tell him her wonderful secret.  \"Here, son!\" she cried at last, as he began to pause between mouthfuls, \"look at my treasure!\" And she held out to him the golden beetle.  \"First tell me what good fairy of a rich man has been filling our hands with silver?\"  \"That's just what I am trying to tell you,\" she laughed, \"for there was a fairy here this afternoon sure enough, only he was dressed like a bald priest. That golden beetle is all he gave me, but with it comes a secret worth thousands of cash to us.\"  The youth fingered the trinket idly, still doubting his senses, and waiting impatiently for the secret of his delicious dinner. \"But, mother, what has this brass bauble to do with the dumplings, these wonderful pork dumplings, the finest I ever ate?\"  \"Baubles indeed! Brass! Fie, fie, my boy! You little know what you are saying. Only listen and you shall hear a tale that will open your eyes.\"  She then told him what had happened, and ended by setting all of the left-over dumplings upon the floor for Blackfoot and Whitehead, a thing her son had never seen her do before, for they had been miserably poor and had had to save every scrap for the next meal.  Now began a long period of perfect happiness. Mother, son, dog and cat--all enjoyed themselves to their hearts' content. All manner of new foods such as they had never tasted were called forth from the pot by the wonderful little beetle. Bird-nest soup, shark's fins, and a hundred other delicacies were theirs for the asking, and soon Ming-li regained all his strength, but, I fear, at the same time grew somewhat lazy, for it was no longer necessary for him to work. As for the two animals, they became fat and sleek and their hair grew long and glossy.  [Illustration: \"HERE SON!\" SHE CRIED, \"HAVE A LOOK AT MY TREASURE!\"]  But alas! according to a Chinese proverb, pride invites sorrow. The little family became so proud of their good fortune that they began to ask friends and relatives to dinner that they might show off their good meals. One day a Mr. and Mrs. Chu came from a distant village. They were much astonished at seeing the high style in which the Wangs lived. They had expected a beggar's meal, but went away with full stomachs.  \"It's the best stuff I ever ate,\" said Mr. Chu, as they entered their own tumble-down house.  \"Yes, and I know where it came from,\" exclaimed his wife. \"I saw Widow Wang take a little gold ornament out of the pot and hide it in a cupboard. It must be some sort of charm, for I heard her mumbling to herself about pork and dumplings just as she was stirring up the fire.\"  \"A charm, eh? Why is it that other people have all the luck? It looks as if we were doomed forever to be poor.\"  \"Why not borrow Mrs. Wang's charm for a few days until we can pick up a little flesh to keep our bones from clattering? Turn about's fair play. Of course, we'll return it sooner or later.\"  \"Doubtless they keep very close watch over it. When would you find them away from home, now that they don't have to work any more? As their house only contains one room, and that no bigger than ours, it would be difficult to borrow this golden trinket. It is harder, for more reasons than one, to steal from a beggar than from a king.\"  \"Luck is surely with us,\" cried Mrs. Chu, clapping her hands. \"They are going this very day to the Temple fair. I overheard Mrs. Wang tell her son that he must not forget he was to take her about the middle of the afternoon. I will slip back then and borrow the little charm from the box in which she hid it.\"  \"Aren't you afraid of Blackfoot?\"  \"Pooh! he's so fat he can do nothing but roll. If the widow comes back suddenly, I'll tell her I came to look for my big hair-pin, that I lost it while I was at dinner.\"  \"All right, go ahead, only of course we must remember we're borrowing the thing, not stealing it, for the Wangs have always been good friends to us, and then, too, we have just dined with them.\"  So skilfully did this crafty woman carry out her plans that within an hour she was back in her own house, gleefully showing the priest's charm to her husband. Not a soul had seen her enter the Wang house. The dog had made no noise, and the cat had only blinked her surprise at seeing a stranger and had gone to sleep again on the floor.  Great was the clamour and weeping when, on returning from the fair in expectation of a hot supper, the widow found her treasure missing. It was long before she could grasp the truth. She went back to the little box in the cupboard ten times before she could believe it was empty, and the room looked as if a cyclone had struck it, so long and carefully did the two unfortunates hunt for the lost beetle.  Then came days of hunger which were all the harder to bear since the recent period of good food and plenty. Oh, if they had only not got used to such dainties! How hard it was to go back to scraps and scrapings!  But if the widow and her son were sad over the loss of the good meals, the two pets were even more so. They were reduced to beggary and had to go forth daily upon the streets in search of stray bones and refuse that decent dogs and cats turned up their noses at.  One day, after this period of starvation had been going on for some time, Whitehead began suddenly to frisk about in great excitement.  \"Whatever is the matter with you?\" growled Blackfoot. \"Are you mad from hunger, or have you caught another flea?\"  \"I was just thinking over our affairs, and now I know the cause of all our trouble.\"  \"Do you indeed?\" sneered Blackfoot.  \"Yes, I do indeed, and you'd better think twice before you mock me, for I hold your future in my paw, as you will very soon see.\"  \"Well, you needn't get angry about nothing. What wonderful discovery have you made--that every rat has one tail?\"  \"First of all, are you willing to help me bring good fortune back to our family?\"  \"Of course I am. Don't be silly,\" barked the dog, wagging his tail joyfully at the thought of another good dinner. \"Surely! surely! I will do anything you like if it will bring Dame Fortune back again.\"  \"All right. Here is the plan. There has been a thief in the house who has stolen our mistress's golden beetle. You remember all our big dinners that came from the pot? Well, every day I saw our mistress take a little golden beetle out of the black box and put it into the pot. One day she held it up before me, saying, 'Look, puss, there is the cause of all our happiness. Don't you wish it was yours?' Then she laughed and put it back into the box that stays in the cupboard.\"  \"Is that true?\" questioned Blackfoot. \"Why didn't you say something about it before?\"  \"You remember the day Mr. and Mrs. Chu were here, and how Mrs. Chu returned in the afternoon after master and mistress had gone to the fair? I saw her, out of the tail of my eye, go to that very black box and take out the golden beetle. I thought it curious, but never dreamed she was a thief. Alas! I was wrong! She took the beetle, and if I am not mistaken, she and her husband are now enjoying the feasts that belong to us.\"  \"Let's claw them,\" growled Blackfoot, gnashing his teeth.  \"That would do no good,\" counselled the other, \"for they would be sure to come out best in the end. We want the beetle back--that's the main thing. We'll leave revenge to human beings; it is none of our business.\"  \"What do you suggest?\" said Blackfoot. \"I am with you through thick and thin.\"  \"Let's go to the Chu house and make off with the beetle.\"  \"Alas, that I am not a cat!\" moaned Blackfoot. \"If we go there I couldn't get inside, for robbers always keep their gates well locked. If I were like you I could scale the wall. It is the first time in all my life I ever envied a cat.\"  \"We will go together,\" continued Whitehead. \"I will ride on your back when we are fording the river, and you can protect me from strange animals. When we get to the Chu house, I will climb over the wall and manage the rest of the business myself. Only you must wait outside to help me to get home with the prize.\"  No sooner arranged than done. The companions set out that very night on their adventure. They crossed the river as the cat had suggested, and Blackfoot really enjoyed the swim, for, as he said, it took him back to his puppyhood, while the cat did not get a single drop of water on her face. It was midnight when they reached the Chu house.  \"Just wait till I return,\" purred Whitehead in Blackfoot's ear.  With a mighty spring she reached the top of the mud wall, and then jumped down to the inside court. While she was resting in the shadow, trying to decide just how to go about her work, a slight rustling attracted her attention, and pop! one giant spring, one stretch-out of the claws, and she had caught a rat that had just come out of his hole for a drink and a midnight walk.  Now, Whitehead was so hungry that she would have made short work of this tempting prey if the rat had not opened its mouth and, to her amazement, begun to talk in good cat dialect.  \"Pray, good puss, not so fast with your sharp teeth! Kindly be careful with your claws! Don't you know it is the custom now to put prisoners on their honour? I will promise not to run away.\"  \"Pooh! what honour has a rat?\"  \"Most of us haven't much, I grant you, but my family was brought up under the roof of Confucius, and there we picked up so many crumbs of wisdom that we are exceptions to the rule. If you will spare me, I will obey you for life, in fact, will be your humble slave.\" Then, with a quick jerk, freeing itself, \"See, I am loose now, but honour holds me as if I were tied, and so I make no further attempt to get away.\"  \"Much good it would do you,\" purred Whitehead, her fur crackling noisily, and her mouth watering for a taste of rat steak. \"However, I am quite willing to put you to the test. First, answer"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18674"],["title","A Chinese Wonder Book (#2)"],["body"," few polite questions and I will see if you're a truthful fellow. What kind of food is your master eating now, that you should be so round and plump when I am thin and scrawny?\"  \"Oh, we have been in luck lately, I can tell you. Master and mistress feed on the fat of the land, and of course we hangers-on get the crumbs.\"  \"But this is a poor tumble-down house. How can they afford such eating?\"  \"That is a great secret, but as I am in honour bound to tell you, here goes. My mistress has just obtained in some manner or other, a fairy's charm----\"  \"She stole it from our place,\" hissed the cat, \"I will claw her eyes out if I get the chance. Why, we've been fairly starving for want of that beetle. She stole it from us just after she had been an invited guest! What do you think of that for honour, Sir Rat? Were your mistress's ancestors followers of the sage?\"  \"Oh, oh, oh! Why, that explains everything!\" wailed the rat. \"I have often wondered how they got the golden beetle, and yet of course I dared not ask any questions.\"  \"No, certainly not! But hark you, friend rat--you get that golden trinket back for me, and I will set you free at once of all obligations. Do you know where she hides it?\"  \"Yes, in a crevice where the wall is broken. I will bring it to you in a jiffy, but how shall we exist when our charm is gone? There will be a season of scanty food, I fear; beggars' fare for all of us.\"  \"Live on the memory of your good deed,\" purred the cat. \"It is splendid, you know, to be an honest beggar. Now scoot! I trust you completely, since your people lived in the home of Confucius. I will wait here for your return. Ah!\" laughed Whitehead to herself, \"luck seems to be coming our way again!\"  Five minutes later the rat appeared, bearing the trinket in its mouth. It passed the beetle over to the cat, and then with a whisk was off for ever. Its honour was safe, but it was afraid of Whitehead. It had seen the gleam of desire in her green eyes, and the cat might have broken her word if she had not been so anxious to get back home where her mistress could command the wonderful kettle once more to bring forth food.  The two adventurers reached the river just as the sun was rising above the eastern hills.  \"Be careful,\" cautioned Blackfoot, as the cat leaped upon his back for her ride across the stream, \"be careful not to forget the treasure. In short, remember that even though you are a female, it is necessary to keep your mouth closed till we reach the other side.\"  \"Thanks, but I don't think I need your advice,\" replied Whitehead, picking up the beetle and leaping on to the dog's back.  But alas! just as they were nearing the farther shore, the excited cat forgot her wisdom for a moment. A fish suddenly leaped out of the water directly under her nose. It was too great a temptation. Snap! went her jaws in a vain effort to land the scaly treasure, and the golden beetle sank to the bottom of the river.  \"There!\" said the dog angrily, \"what did I tell you? Now all our trouble has been in vain--all on account of your stupidity.\"  For a time there was a bitter dispute, and the companions called each other some very bad names--such as turtle and rabbit. Just as they were starting away from the river, disappointed and discouraged, a friendly frog who had by chance heard their conversation offered to fetch the treasure from the bottom of the stream. No sooner said than done, and after thanking this accommodating animal profusely, they turned homeward once more.  When they reached the cottage the door was shut, and, bark as he would, Blackfoot could not persuade his master to open it. There was the sound of loud wailing inside.  \"Mistress is broken-hearted,\" whispered the cat, \"I will go to her and make her happy.\"  So saying, she sprang lightly through a hole in the paper window, which, alas! was too small and too far from the ground for the faithful dog to enter.  A sad sight greeted the gaze of Whitehead. The son was lying on the bed unconscious, almost dead for want of food, while his mother, in despair, was rocking backwards and forwards wringing her wrinkled hands and crying at the top of her voice for some one to come and save them.  \"Here I am, mistress,\" cried Whitehead, \"and here is the treasure you are weeping for. I have rescued it and brought it back to you.\"  The widow, wild with joy at sight of the beetle, seized the cat in her scrawny arms and hugged the pet tightly to her bosom.  \"Breakfast, son, breakfast! Wake up from your swoon! Fortune has come again. We are saved from starvation!\"  Soon a steaming hot meal was ready, and you may well imagine how the old woman and her son, heaping praises upon Whitehead, filled the beast's platter with good things, but never a word did they say of the faithful dog, who remained outside sniffing the fragrant odours and waiting in sad wonder, for all this time the artful cat had said nothing of Blackfoot's part in the rescue of the golden beetle.  At last, when breakfast was over, slipping away from the others, Whitehead jumped out through the hole in the window.  \"Oh, my dear Blackfoot,\" she began laughingly, \"you should have been inside to see what a feast they gave me! Mistress was so delighted at my bringing back her treasure that she could not give me enough to eat, nor say enough kind things about me. Too bad, old fellow, that you are hungry. You'd better run out into the street and hunt up a bone.\"  Maddened by the shameful treachery of his companion, the enraged dog sprang upon the cat and in a few seconds had shaken her to death.  \"So dies the one who forgets a friend and who loses honour,\" he cried sadly, as he stood over the body of his companion.  Rushing out into the street, he proclaimed the treachery of Whitehead to the members of his tribe, at the same time advising that all self-respecting dogs should from that time onwards make war upon the feline race.  And that is why the descendants of old Blackfoot, whether in China or in the great countries of the West, have waged continual war upon the children and grandchildren of Whitehead, for a thousand generations of dogs have fought them and hated them with a great and lasting hatred.     THE GREAT BELL  [Illustration]   The mighty Yung-lo sat on the great throne surrounded by a hundred attendants. He was sad, for he could think of no wonderful thing to do for his country. He flirted his silken fan nervously and snapped his long finger-nails in the impatience of despair.  \"Woe is me!\" he cried at last, his sorrow getting the better of his usual calmness. \"I have picked up the great capital and moved it from the South to Peking and have built here a mighty city. I have surrounded my city with a wall, even thicker and greater than the famous wall of China. I have constructed in this city scores of temples and palaces. I have had the wise men and scholars compile a great book of wisdom, made up of 23,000 volumes, the largest and most wonderful collection of learning ever gathered together by the hands of men. I have built watch-towers, bridges, and giant monuments, and now, alas! as I approach the end of my days as ruler of the Middle Kingdom there is nothing more to be done for my people. Better far that I should even now close my tired eyes for ever and mount up on high to be the guest of the dragon, than live on in idleness, giving to my children an example of uselessness and sloth.\"  \"But, your Majesty,\" began one of Yung-lo's most faithful courtiers, named Ming-lin, falling upon his knees and knocking his head three times on the ground, \"if you would only deign to listen to your humble slave, I would dare to suggest a great gift for which the many people of Peking, your children, would rise up and bless you both now and in future generations.\"  \"Only tell me of such a gift and I will not only grant it to the imperial city, but as a sign of thanksgiving to you for your sage counsel I will bestow upon you the royal peacock feather.\"  \"It is not for one of my small virtues,\" replied the delighted official, \"to wear the feather when others so much wiser are denied it, but if it please your Majesty, remember that in the northern district of the city there has been erected a bell-tower which as yet remains empty. The people of the city need a giant bell to sound out the fleeting hours of the day, that they may be urged on to perform their labours and not be idle. The water-clock already marks the hours, but there is no bell to proclaim them to the populace.\"  \"A good suggestion in sooth,\" answered the Emperor, smiling, \"and yet who is there among us that has skill enough in bell-craft to do the task you propose? I am told that to cast a bell worthy of our imperial city requires the genius of a poet and the skill of an astronomer.\"  \"True, most mighty one, and yet permit me to say that Kwan-yu, who so skilfully moulded the imperial cannon, can also cast a giant bell. He alone of all your subjects is worthy of the task, for he alone can do it justice.\"  Now, the official who proposed the name of Kwan-yu to the Emperor had two objects in so doing. He wished to quiet the grief of Yung-lo, who was mourning because he had nothing left to do for his people, and, at the same time, to raise Kwan-yu to high rank, for Kwan-yu's only daughter had for several years been betrothed to Ming-lin's only son, and it would be a great stroke of luck for Ming-lin if his daughter-in-law's father should come under direct favour of the Emperor.  \"Depend upon it, Kwan-yu can do the work better than any other man within the length and breadth of your empire,\" continued Ming-lin, again bowing low three times.  \"Then summon Kwan-yu at once to my presence, that I may confer with him about this important business.\"  In great glee Ming-lin arose and backed himself away from the golden throne, for it would have been very improper for him to turn his coat-tails on the Son of Heaven.  But it was with no little fear that Kwan-yu undertook the casting"]]]
