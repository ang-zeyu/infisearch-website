It would have been strange, indeed, had the primitive assumption in philology been true, and the history of language exhibited universal degradation.  In the remarks on the \"Origin of Man,\" the statement was made that mankind was distributed throughout the habitable earth, in some geological period anterior to the present and anterior to the development of other than the rudest arts. Here, again, we reach the conclusion that man was distributed throughout the earth anterior to the development of organized speech.  In the presence of these two great facts, the difficulty of tracing genetic relationship among human races through arts, customs, institutions, and traditions will appear, for all of these must have been developed after the dispersion of mankind. Analogies and homologies in these phenomena must be accounted for in some other way. Somatology proves the unity of the human species; that is, the evidence upon which this conclusion is reached is morphologic; but in arts, customs, institutions, and traditions abundant corroborative evidence is found. The individuals of the one species, though inhabiting diverse climes, speaking diverse languages, and organized into diverse communities, have progressed in a broad way by the same stages, have had the same arts, customs, institutions, and traditions in the same order, limited only by the degree of progress to which the several tribes have attained, and modified only to a limited extent by variations in environment.  If any ethnic classification of mankind is to be established more fundamental than that based upon language, it must be upon physical characteristics, and such must have been acquired by profound differentiation anterior to the development of languages, arts, customs, institutions, and traditions. The classifications hitherto made on this basis are unsatisfactory, and no one now receives wide acceptance. Perhaps further research will clear up doubtful matters and give an acceptable grouping; or it may be that such research will result only in exhibiting the futility of the effort.  The history of man, from the lowest tribal condition to the highest national organization, has been a history of constant and multifarious admixture of strains of blood; of admixture, absorption, and destruction of languages with general progress toward unity; of the diffusion of arts by various processes of acculturation; and of admixture and reciprocal diffusion of customs, institutions, and traditions. Arts, customs, institutions, and traditions extend beyond the boundaries of languages and serve to obscure them, and the admixture of strains of blood has obscured primitive ethnic divisions, if such existed.  If the physical classification fails, the most fundamental grouping left is that based on language; but for the reasons already mentioned and others of like character, the classification of languages is not, to the full extent, a classification of peoples.  It may be that the unity of the human race is a fact so profound that all attempts at a fundamental classification to be used in all the departments of anthropology will fail, and that there will remain multifarious groupings for the multifarious purposes of the science; or, otherwise expressed, that languages, arts, customs, institutions, and traditions may be classified, and that the human family will be considered as one race.   MYTHOLOGY.  Here again America presents a rich field for the scientific explorer. It is now known that each linguistic stock has a distinct mythology, and as in some of these stocks there are many languages differing to a greater or less extent, so there are many like differing mythologies.  As in language, so in mythology, investigation has proceeded from, the known to the unknown--from the higher to the lower mythologies. In each step of the progress of opinion on this subject a particular phenomenon may be observed. As each lower status of mythology is discovered it is assumed to be the first in origin, the primordial mythology, and all lower but imperfectly understood mythologies are interpreted as degradations, from this assumed original belief; thus polytheism was interpreted as a degeneracy from monotheism; nature worship, from psychotheism; zoölotry, from ancestor worship; and, in order, monotheism has been held to be the original mythology, then polytheism, then physitheism or nature worship, then ancestor worship.  With a large body of mythologists nature worship is now accepted as the primitive religion; and with another body, equally as respectable, ancestor worship is primordial. But nature worship and ancestor worship are concomitant parts of the same religion, and belong to a status of culture highly advanced and characterized by the invention of conventional pictographs. In North America we have scores or even hundreds of systems of mythology, all belonging to a lower state of culture.  Let us hope that American students will not fall into this line of error by assuming that zoötheism is the lowest stage, because this is the status of mythology most widely spread on the continent.  Mythology is primitive philosophy. A mythology--that is, the body of myths current among any people and believed by them--comprises a system of explanations of all the phenomena of the universe discerned by them; but such explanations are always mixed with much extraneous matter, chiefly incidents in the history of the personages who were the heroes of mythologic deeds.  Every mythology has for its basis a theology--a system of gods who are the actors, and to whom are attributed the phenomena to be explained--for the fundamental postulate in mythology is \"some one does it,\" such being the essential characteristic of subjective reasoning. As peoples pass from one stage of culture to another, the change is made by developing a new sociology with all its institutions, by the development of new arts, by evolution of language, and, in a degree no less, by a change in philosophy; but the old philosophy is not supplanted. The change is made by internal growth and external accretion.  Fragments of the older are found in the newer. This older material in the newer philosophy is often used for curious purposes by many scholars. One such use I wish to mention here. The nomenclature which has survived from the earlier state is supposed to be deeply and occultly symbolic and the mythic narratives to be deeply and occultly allegoric. In this way search is made for some profoundly metaphysic cosmogony; some ancient beginning of the mythology is sought in which mystery is wisdom and wisdom is mystery.  The objective or scientific method of studying a mythology is to collect and collate its phenomena simply as it is stated and understood by the people to whom it belongs. In tracing back the threads of its historical development the student should expect to find it more simple and childlike in every stage of his progress.  It is vain to search for truth in mythologic philosophy, but it is important to search for veritable philosphies, that they may be properly compared and that the products of the human mind in its various stages of culture may be known; important in the reconstruction of the history of philosophy; and important in furnishing necessary data to psychology. No labor can be more fruitless than the search in mythology for true philosophy; and the efforts to build up from the terminology and narratives of mythologies an occult symbolism and system of allegory is but to create a new and fictitious body of mythology.  There is a symbolism inherent in language and found in all philosophy, true or false, and such symbolism was cultivated as an occult art in the early history of civilization when picture-writing developed into conventional writing, and symbolism is an interesting subject for study, but it has been made a beast of burden to carry packs of metaphysic nonsense.   SOCIOLOGY.  Here again North America presents a wide and interesting field to the investigator, for it has within its extent many distinct governments, and these governments, so far as investigations have been carried, are found to belong to a type more primitive than any of the feudalities from which the civilized nations of the earth sprang, as shown by concurrently recorded history.  Yet in this history many facts have been discovered suggesting that feudalities themselves had an origin in something more primitive. In the study of the tribes of the world a multitude of sociologic institutions and customs have been discovered, and in reviewing the history of feudalities it is seen that many of their important elements are survivals from tribal society.  So important are these discoveries that all human history has to be rewritten, the whole philosophy of history reconstructed. Government does not begin in the ascendency of chieftains through prowess in war, but in the slow specialization of executive functions from communal associations based on kinship. Deliberative assemblies do not start in councils gathered by chieftains, but councils precede chieftaincies. Law does not begin in contract, but is the development of custom. Land tenure does not begin in grants from the monarch or the feudal lord, but a system of tenure in common by gentes or tribes is developed into a system of tenure in severalty. Evolution in society has not been from militancy to industrialism, but from organization based on kinship to organization based on property, and alongside of the specializations of the industries of peace the arts of war have been specialized.  So, one by one, the theories of metaphysical writers on sociology are overthrown, and the facts of history are taking their place, and the philosophy of history is being erected out of materials accumulating by"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1887"],["title","The Life of the Spider (#1)"],["body","method, I sometimes caught    as many as fifteen Tarantulae within the space of an hour.     'In a few cases, in which the Tarantula was under no misapprehension    as to the trap which I was setting for her, I was not a little    surprised, when I pushed the stalk far enough down to twist it round    her hiding-place, to see her play with the spikelet more or less    contemptuously and push it away with her legs, without troubling to    retreat to the back of her lair.     'The Apulian peasants, according to Baglivi's {4} account, also hunt    the Tarantula by imitating the humming of an insect with an oat-stalk    at the entrance to her burrow.  I quote the passage:     '\"_Ruricolae nostri quando eas captare volunt, ad illorum latibula    accedunt, tenuisque avenacae fistulae sonum, apum murmuri non    absimilem, modulantur.  Quo audito, ferox exit Tarentula ut muscas vel    alia hujus modi insecta, quorum murmur esse putat, captat; captatur    tamen ista a rustico insidiatore_.\" {5}     'The Tarantula, so dreadful at first sight, especially when we are    filled with the idea that her bite is dangerous, so fierce in    appearance, is nevertheless quite easy to tame, as I have often found    by experiment.     'On the 7th of May 1812, while at Valencia, in Spain, I caught a fair-    sized male Tarantula, without hurting him, and imprisoned him in a    glass jar, with a paper cover in which I cut a trap-door.  At the    bottom of the jar I put a paper bag, to serve as his habitual    residence.  I placed the jar on a table in my bedroom, so as to have    him under frequent observation.  He soon grew accustomed to captivity    and ended by becoming so familiar that he would come and take from my    fingers the live Fly which I gave him.  After killing his victim with    the fangs of his mandibles, he was not satisfied, like most Spiders,    to suck her head: he chewed her whole body, shoving it piecemeal into    his mouth with his palpi, after which he threw up the masticated    teguments and swept them away from his lodging.     'Having finished his meal, he nearly always made his toilet, which    consisted in brushing his palpi and mandibles, both inside and out,    with his front tarsi.  After that, he resumed his air of motionless    gravity.  The evening and the night were his time for taking his walks    abroad.  I often heard him scratching the paper of the bag.  These    habits confirm the opinion, which I have already expressed elsewhere,    that most Spiders have the faculty of seeing by day and night, like    cats.     'On the 28th of June, my Tarantula cast his skin.  It was his last    moult and did not perceptibly alter either the colour of his attire or    the dimensions of his body.  On the 14th of July, I had to leave    Valencia; and I stayed away until the 23rd.  During this time, the    Tarantula fasted; I found him looking quite well on my return.  On the    20th of August, I again left for a nine days' absence, which my    prisoner bore without food and without detriment to his health.  On    the 1st of October, I once more deserted the Tarantula, leaving him    without provisions.  On the 21st, I was fifty miles from Valencia and,    as I intended to remain there, I sent a servant to fetch him.  I was    sorry to learn that he was not found in the jar, and I never heard    what became of him.     'I will end my observations on the Tarantulae with a short description    of a curious fight between those animals.  One day, when I had had a    successful hunt after these Lycosae, I picked out two full-grown and    very powerful males and brought them together in a wide jar, in order    to enjoy the sight of a combat to the death.  After walking round the    arena several times, to try and avoid each other, they were not slow    in placing themselves in a warlike attitude, as though at a given    signal.  I saw them, to my surprise, take their distances and sit up    solemnly on their hind-legs, so as mutually to present the shield of    their chests to each other.  After watching them face to face like    that for two minutes, during which they had doubtless provoked each    other by glances that escaped my own, I saw them fling themselves upon    each other at the same time, twisting their legs round each other and    obstinately struggling to bite each other with the fangs of the    mandibles.  Whether from fatigue or from convention, the combat was    suspended; there was a few seconds' truce; and each athlete moved away    and resumed his threatening posture.  This circumstance reminded me    that, in the strange fights between cats, there are also suspensions    of hostilities.  But the contest was soon renewed between my two    Tarantulae with increased fierceness.  One of them, after holding    victory in the balance for a while, was at last thrown and received a    mortal wound in the head.  He became the prey of the conqueror, who    tore open his skull and devoured it.  After this curious duel, I kept    the victorious Tarantula alive for several weeks.'  My district does not boast the ordinary Tarantula, the Spider whose habits have been described above by the Wizard of the Landes; but it possesses an equivalent in the shape of the Black-bellied Tarantula, or Narbonne Lycosa, half the size of the other, clad in black velvet on the lower surface, especially under the belly, with brown chevrons on the abdomen and grey and white rings around the legs.  Her favourite home is the dry, pebbly ground, covered with sun-scorched thyme.  In my _harmas_ {6} laboratory there are quite twenty of this Spider's burrows.  Rarely do I pass by one of these haunts without giving a glance down the pit where gleam, like diamonds, the four great eyes, the four telescopes, of the hermit.  The four others, which are much smaller, are not visible at that depth.  Would I have greater riches, I have but to walk a hundred yards from my house, on the neighbouring plateau, once a shady forest, to-day a dreary solitude where the Cricket browses and the Wheat-ear flits from stone to stone.  The love of lucre has laid waste the land.  Because wine paid handsomely, they pulled up the forest to plant the vine.  Then came the Phylloxera, the vine-stocks perished and the once green table-land is now no more than a desolate stretch where a few tufts of hardy grasses sprout among the pebbles.  This waste-land is the Lycosa's paradise: in an hour's time, if need were, I should discover a hundred burrows within a limited range.  These dwellings are pits about a foot deep, perpendicular at first and then bent elbow-wise.  The average diameter is an inch.  On the edge of the hole stands a kerb, formed of straw, bits and scraps of all sorts and even small pebbles, the size of a hazel-nut.  The whole is kept in place and cemented with silk.  Often, the Spider confines herself to drawing together the dry blades of the nearest grass, which she ties down with the straps from her spinnerets, without removing the blades from the stems; often, also, she rejects this scaffolding in favour of a masonry constructed of small stones.  The nature of the kerb is decided by the nature of the materials within the Lycosa's reach, in the close neighbourhood of the building-yard.  There is no selection: everything meets with approval, provided that it be near at hand.  Economy of time, therefore, causes the defensive wall to vary greatly as regards its constituent elements.  The height varies also.  One enclosure is a turret an inch high; another amounts to a mere rim.  All have their parts bound firmly together with silk; and all have the same width as the subterranean channel, of which they are the extension.  There is here no difference in diameter between the underground manor and its outwork, nor do we behold, at the opening, the platform which the turret leaves to give free play to the Italian Tarantula's legs.  The Black-bellied Tarantula's work takes the form of a well surmounted by its kerb.  When the soil is earthy and homogeneous, the architectural type is free from obstructions and the Spider's dwelling is a cylindrical tube; but, when the site is pebbly, the shape is modified according to the exigencies of the digging.  In the second case, the lair is often a rough, winding cave, at intervals along whose inner wall stick blocks of stone avoided in the process of excavation.  Whether regular or irregular, the house is plastered to a certain depth with a coat of silk, which prevents earth-slips and facilitates scaling when a prompt exit is required.  Baglivi, in his unsophisticated Latin, teaches us how to catch the Tarantula.  I became his _rusticus insidiator_;  I waved a spikelet at the entrance of the burrow to imitate the humming of a Bee and attract the attention of the Lycosa, who rushes out, thinking that she is capturing a prey.  This method did not succeed with me.  The Spider, it is true, leaves her remote apartments and comes a little way up the vertical tube to enquire into the sounds at her door; but the wily animal soon scents a trap; it remains motionless at mid-height and, at the least alarm, goes down again to the branch gallery, where it is invisible.  Leon Dufour's appears to me a better method if it were only practicable in the conditions wherein I find myself.  To drive a knife quickly into the ground, across the burrow, so as to cut off the Tarantula's retreat when she is attracted by the spikelet and standing on the upper floor, would be a manoeuvre certain of success, if the soil were favourable. Unfortunately, this is not so in my case: you might as well try to dig a knife into a block of tufa.  Other stratagems become necessary.  Here are two which were successful: I recommend them to future Tarantula-hunters.  I insert into the burrow, as far down as I can, a stalk with a fleshy spikelet, which the Spider can bite into.  I move and turn and twist my bait.  The Tarantula, when touched by the intruding"]]]
