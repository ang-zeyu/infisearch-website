Testing the \"Disintegrator.\"  I had the good fortune to be present when this powerful engine of destruction was submitted to its first test. We had gone upon the roof of Mr. Edison's laboratory and the inventor held the little instrument, with its attached mirror, in his hand. We looked about for some object on which to try its powers. On a bare limb of a tree not far away, for it was late in the Fall, sat a disconsolate crow.  \"Good,\" said Mr. Edison, \"that will do.\" He touched a button at the side of the instrument and a soft, whirring noise was heard.  \"Feathers,\" said Mr. Edison, \"have a vibration period of three hundred and eighty-six million per second.\"  He adjusted the index as he spoke. Then, through a sighting tube, he aimed at the bird.  \"Now watch,\" he said.   The Crow's Fate.  Another soft whirr in the instrument, a momentary flash of light close around it, and, behold, the crow had turned from black to white!  \"Its feathers are gone,\" said the inventor; \"they have been dissipated into their constituent atoms. Now, we will finish the crow.\"  Instantly there was another adjustment of the index, another outshooting of vibratory force, a rapid up and down motion of the index to include a certain range of vibrations, and the crow itself was gone--vanished in empty space! There was the bare twig on which a moment before it had stood. Behind, in the sky, was the white cloud against which its black form had been sharply outlined, but there was no more crow.   Bad for the Martians.  \"That looks bad for the Martians, doesn't it?\" said the Wizard. \"I have ascertained the vibration rate of all the materials of which their war engines whose remains we have collected together are composed. They can be shattered into nothingness in the fraction of a second. Even if the vibration period were not known, it could quickly be hit upon by simply running through the gamut.\"  \"Hurrah!\" cried one of the onlookers. \"We have met the Martians and they are ours.\"  Such in brief was the first of the contrivances which Mr. Edison invented for the approaching war with Mars.  And these facts had become widely known. Additional experiments had completed the demonstration of the inventor's ability, with the aid of his wonderful instrument, to destroy any given object, or any part of an object, provided that that part differed in its atomic constitution, and consequently in its vibratory period, from the other parts.  A most impressive public exhibition of the powers of the little disintegrator was given amid the ruins of New York. On lower Broadway a part of the walls of one of the gigantic buildings, which had been destroyed by the Martians, impended in such a manner that it threatened at any moment to fall upon the heads of the passers-by. The Fire Department did not dare touch it. To blow it up seemed a dangerous expedient, because already new buildings had been erected in its neighborhood, and their safety would be imperiled by the flying fragments. The fact happened to come to my knowledge.  \"Here is an opportunity,\" I said to Mr. Edison, \"to try the powers of your machine on a large scale.\"  \"Capital!\" he instantly replied. \"I shall go at once.\"   Disintegrating a Building.  For the work now in hand it was necessary to employ a battery of disintegrators, since the field of destruction covered by each was comparatively limited. All of the impending portions of the wall must be destroyed at once and together, for otherwise the danger would rather be accentuated than annihilated. The disintegrators were placed upon the roof of a neighboring building, so adjusted that their fields of destruction overlapped one another upon the wall. Their indexes were all set to correspond with the vibration period of the peculiar kind of brick of which the wall consisted. Then the energy was turned on, and a shout of wonder arose from the multitudes which had assembled at a safe distance to witness the experiment.   Only a Cloud Remained.  The wall did not fall; it did not break asunder; no fragments shot this way and that and high in the air; there was no explosion; no shock or noise disturbed the still atmosphere--only a soft whirr, that seemed to pervade everything and to tingle in the nerves of the spectators; and--what had been was not! The wall was gone! But high above and all around the place where it had hung over the street with its threat of death there appeared, swiftly billowing outward in every direction, a faint, bluish cloud. It was the scattered atoms of the destroyed wall.  And now the cry \"On to Mars!\" was heard on all sides. But for such an enterprise funds were needed--millions upon millions. Yet some of the fairest and richest portions of the earth had been impoverished by the frightful ravages of those enemies who had dropped down upon them from the skies. Still, the money must be had. The salvation of the planet, as everybody was now convinced, depended upon the successful negotiation of a gigantic war fund, in comparison with which all the expenditures in all of the wars that had been waged by the nations for 2,000 years would be insignificant. The electrical ships and the vibration engines must be constructed by scores and thousands. Only Mr. Edison's immense resources and unrivaled equipment had enabled him to make the models whose powers had been so satisfactorily shown. But to multiply these upon a war scale was not only beyond the resources of any individual--hardly a nation on the globe in the period of its greatest prosperity could have undertaken such a work. All the nations, then, must now conjoin. They must unite their resources, and, if necessary, exhaust all their hoards, in order to raise the needed sum.   The Yankees Lead.  Negotiations were at once begun. The United States naturally took the lead, and their leadership was never for a moment questioned abroad.  Washington was selected as the place of meeting for a great congress of the nations. Washington, luckily, had been one of the places which had not been touched by the Martians. But if Washington had been a city composed of hotels alone, and every hotel so great as to be a little city in itself, it would have been utterly insufficient for the accommodation of the innumerable throngs which now flocked to the banks of the Potomac. But when was American enterprise unequal to a crisis? The necessary hotels, lodging houses and restaurants were constructed with astounding rapidity. One could see the city growing and expanding day by day and week after week. It flowed over Georgetown Heights; it leaped the Potomac; it spread east and west, south and north; square mile after square mile of territory was buried under the advancing buildings, until the gigantic city, which had thus grown up like a mushroom in a night, was fully capable of accommodating all its expected guests.  At first it had been intended that the heads of the various governments should in person attend this universal congress, but as the enterprise went on, as the enthusiasm spread, as the necessity for haste became more apparent through the warning notes which were constantly sounded from the observatories where the astronomers were nightly beholding new evidences of threatening preparations in Mars, the kings and queens of the old world felt that they could not remain at home; that their proper place was at the new focus and centre of the whole world--the city of Washington. Without concerted action, without interchange of suggestion, this impulse seemed to seize all the old world monarchs at once. Suddenly cablegrams flashed to the Government at Washington, announcing that Queen Victoria, the Emperor William, the Czar Nicholas, Alphonso of Spain, with his mother, Maria Christina; the old Emperor Francis Joseph and the Empress Elizabeth, of Austria; King Oscar and Queen Sophia, of Sweden and Norway; King Humbert and Queen Margherita, of Italy; King George and Queen Olga, of Greece; Abdul Hamid, of Turkey; Tsait'ien, Emperor of China; Mutsuhito, the Japanese Mikado, with his beautiful Princess Haruko; the President of France, the President of Switzerland, the First Syndic of the little republic of Andorra, perched on the crest of the Pyrenees, and the heads of all the Central and South American republics, were coming to Washington to take part in the deliberations, which, it was felt, were to settle the fate of earth and Mars.  One day, after this announcement had been received, and the additional news had come that nearly all the visiting monarchs had set out, attended by brilliant suites and convoyed by fleets of warships, for their destination, some coming across the Atlantic to the port of New York, others across the Pacific to San Francisco, Mr. Edison said to me:  \"This will be a fine spectacle. Would you like to watch it?\"  \"Certainly,\" I replied.   A Grand Spectacle.  The Ship of Space was immediately at our disposal. I think I have not yet mentioned the fact that the inventor's control over the electrical generator carried in the car was so perfect that by varying the potential or changing the polarity he could cause it slowly or swiftly, as might be desired, to approach or recede from any object. The only practical difficulty was presented when the polarity of the electrical charge upon an object in the neighborhood of the car was unknown to those in the car, and happened to be opposite to that of the charge which the car, at that particular moment, was bearing. In such a case, of course, the car would fly toward the object, whatever it might be, like a pith ball or a feather, attracted to the knob of an electrical machine. In this way, considerable danger was occasionally encountered, and a few accidents could not be avoided. Fortunately, however, such cases were rare. It was only now and then that, owing to some local cause, electrical polarities unknown to or unexpected by the navigators, endangered the safety of the car.

At the gate I stood looking up and down the road. The houses were all in darkness. What could be the meaning of the mysterious summons? I had made no mistake respecting the name of my patient; it had been twice repeated over the telephone; yet that the call had not emanated from Mrs. Hewett's house was now palpably evident. Days had been when I should have regarded the episode as preluding some outrage, but to-night I felt more disposed to ascribe it to a silly practical joke.  Eltham walked up briskly.  \"You're in demand to-night, doctor,\" he said. \"A young person called for you almost directly you had left your house, and, learning where you were gone, followed you.\"  \"Indeed!\" I said, a trifle incredulously. \"There are plenty of other doctors if the case is an urgent one.\"  \"She may have thought it would save time as you were actually up and dressed,\" explained Eltham; \"and the house is quite near to here, I understand.\"  I looked at him a little blankly. Was this another effort of the unknown jester?  \"I have been fooled once,\" I said. \"That 'phone call was a hoax--\"  \"But I feel certain,\" declared Eltham earnestly, \"that this is genuine! The poor girl was dreadfully agitated; her master has broken his leg and is lying helpless: number 280 Rectory Grove.\"  \"Where is the girl?\" I asked sharply.  \"She ran back directly she had given me her message.\"  \"Was she a servant?\"  \"I should imagine so: French, I think. But she was so wrapped up I had little more than a glimpse of her. I am sorry to hear that some one has played a silly joke on you, but believe me\"--he was very earnest--\"this is no jest. The poor girl could scarcely speak for sobs. She mistook me for you, of course.\"  \"Oh!\" said I grimly; \"well, I suppose I must go. Broken leg, you said?--and my surgical bag, splints and so forth, are at home!\"  \"My dear Petrie!\" cried Eltham, in his enthusiastic way, \"you no doubt can do something to alleviate the poor man's suffering immediately. I will run back to your rooms for the bag and rejoin you at 280 Rectory Grove.\"  \"It's awfully good of you, Eltham--\"  He held up his hand.  \"The call of suffering humanity, Petrie, is one which I may no more refuse to hear than you.\"  I made no further protest after that, for his point of view was evident and his determination adamantine, but told him where he would find the bag and once more set out across the moon-bright common, he pursuing a westerly direction and I going east.  Some three hundred yards I had gone, I suppose, and my brain had been very active the while, when something occurred to me which placed a new complexion upon this second summons. I thought of the falsity of the first, of the improbability of even the most hardened practical joker practising his wiles at one o'clock in the morning. I thought of our recent conversation; above all I thought of the girl who had delivered the message to Eltham, the girl whom he had described as a French maid--whose personal charm had so completely enlisted his sympathies. Now, to this train of thought came a new one, and, adding it, my suspicion became almost a certainty.  I remembered (as, knowing the district, I should have remembered before) that there was no number 280 Rectory Grove.  Pulling up sharply, I stood looking about me. Not a living soul was in sight; not even a policeman. Where the lamps marked the main paths across the common nothing moved; in the shadows about me nothing stirred. But something stirred within me--a warning voice which for long had lain dormant.  What was afoot?  A breeze caressed the leaves overhead, breaking the silence with mysterious whisperings. Some portentous truth was seeking for admittance to my brain. I strove to reassure myself, but the sense of impending evil and of mystery became heavier. At last I could combat my strange fears no longer. I turned and began to run towards the south side of the common--towards my rooms--and after Eltham.  I had hoped to head him off, but came upon no sign of him. An all-night tramcar passed at the moment that I reached the high-road, and as I ran around behind it I saw that my windows were lighted and that there was a light in the hall.  My key was yet in the lock when my housekeeper opened the door.  \"There's a gentleman just come, doctor,\" she began.  I thrust past her and raced up the stairs to my study.  Standing by the writing-table was a tall thin man, his gaunt face brown as a coffee-berry and his steely grey eyes fixed upon me. My heart gave a great leap--and seemed to stand still.  It was Nayland Smith!  \"Smith!\" I cried. \"Smith, old man, by God, I'm glad to see you!\"  He wrung my hand hard, looking at me with his searching eyes; but there was little enough of gladness in his face. He was altogether greyer than when last I had seen him--greyer and sterner.  \"Where is Eltham?\" I asked.  Smith started back as though I had struck him.  \"Eltham!\" he whispered--\"_Eltham_! is Eltham here?\"  \"I left him ten minutes ago on the common.\"  Smith dashed his right fist into the palm of his left hand, and his eyes gleamed almost wildly.  \"My God, Petrie!\" he said, \"am I fated _always_ to come too late?\"  My dreadful fears in that instant were confirmed. I seemed to feel my legs totter beneath me.  \"Smith, you don't mean--\"  \"I do, Petrie!\" His voice sounded very far away. \"Fu-Manchu is here; and Eltham, God help him ... is his first victim!\"     CHAPTER II  ELTHAM VANISHES   Smith went racing down the stairs like a man possessed. Heavy with such a foreboding of calamity as I had not known for two years, I followed him--along the hall and out into the road. The very peace and beauty of the night in some way increased my mental agitation. The sky was lighted almost tropically with such a blaze of stars as I could not recall to have seen since, my futile search concluded, I had left Egypt. The glory of the moonlight yellowed the lamps speckled across the expanse of the common. The night was as still as night can ever be in London. The dimming pulse of a cab or car alone disturbed the quietude.  With a quick glance to right and left, Smith ran across on to the common, and, leaving the door wide open behind me, I followed. The path which Eltham had pursued terminated almost opposite to my house. One's gaze might follow it, white and empty, for several hundred yards past the pond, and farther, until it became overshadowed and was lost amid a clump of trees.  I came up with Smith, and side by side we ran on, whilst pantingly I told my tale.  \"It was a trick to get you away from him!\" cried Smith. \"They meant no doubt to make some attempt at your house, but, as he came out with you, an alternative plan--\"  Abreast of the pond, my companion slowed down, and finally stopped.  \"Where did you last see Eltham?\" he asked, rapidly.  I took his arm, turning him slightly to the right, and pointed across the moon-bathed common.  \"You see that clump of bushes on the other side of the road?\" I said. \"There's a path to the left of it. I took that path and he took this. We parted at the point where they meet--\"  Smith walked right down to the edge of the water and peered about over the surface.  What he hoped to find there I could not imagine. Whatever it had been he was disappointed, and he turned to me again, frowning perplexedly, and tugging at the lobe of his left ear, an old trick which reminded me of gruesome things we had lived through in the past.  \"Come on,\" he jerked. \"It may be amongst the trees.\"  From the tone of his voice I knew that he was tensed up nervously, and his mood but added to the apprehension of my own.  \"_What_ may be amongst the trees, Smith?\" I asked.  He walked on.  \"God knows, Petrie; but I fear--\"  Behind us, along the high-road, a tramcar went rocking by, doubtless bearing a few belated workers homeward. The stark incongruity of the thing was appalling. How little those weary toilers, hemmed about with the commonplace, suspected that almost within sight from the car windows, amid prosy benches, iron railings, and unromantic, flickering lamps, two fellow-men moved upon the border of a horror-land!  Beneath the trees a shadow carpet lay, its edges tropically sharp; and fully ten yards from the first of the group, we two, hatless both, and sharing a common dread, paused for a moment and listened.  The car had stopped at the farther extremity of the common, and now with a moan that grew to a shriek was rolling on its way again. We stood and listened until silence reclaimed the night. Not a footstep could be heard. Then slowly we walked on. At the edge of the little coppice we stopped again abruptly.  Smith turned and thrust his pistol into my hand. A white ray of light pierced the shadows; my companion carried an electric torch. But no trace of Eltham was discoverable.  There had been a heavy shower of rain during the evening, just before sunset, and although the open paths were dry again, under the trees the ground was still moist. Ten yards within the coppice we came upon tracks--the tracks of one running, as the deep imprints of the toes indicated.  Abruptly the tracks terminated; others, softer, joined them, two sets converging from left and right. There was a confused patch, trailing off to the west; then this became indistinct, and was finally lost, upon the hard ground outside the group.  For perhaps a minute, or more, we ran about from tree to tree, and from bush to bush, searching like hounds for a scent, and fearful of what we might find. We found nothing; and fully in the moonlight we stood facing one another. The night was profoundly still.  Nayland Smith stepped back into the shadows, and began slowly to turn his head from left to right, taking in"]]]
