When all was done, she took up a little frock of one of the children's, and, sitting down by the window, began to work. Her pretty dark head was bent over her task; her thick curling lashes lay heavy on her rounded cheek. Mrs. Staunton, who had been having a doze on the sofa, started up now and looked at her.  \"Oh, Effie dear, I have had such a nice sleep,\" she said, with a little sigh; \"I am ever so much the better for it. But what have you done with baby?\"  \"I have put him to sleep, mother; he is in his cot now, as comfortable as possible.\"  \"How good of you, Effie! What a comfort you are to me!\"  Effie smiled. \"I think I hear father coming in,\" she said, \"and supper is quite ready.\"  Mrs. Staunton started up from the sofa; she pushed back her tumbled hair, and shook out her somewhat untidy dress.  \"Now let me make you trim,\" said Effie.  She ran over to her parent, put back her gray hair with an affectionate little touch, and then kissed her mother on her flushed cheeks.  \"You look better for your nice sleep, mother,\" she said.  \"So I am, darling, and for your loving care,\" replied Mrs. Staunton.  Her husband came into the room, and she took her place before the tea-tray.  Supper at the Stauntons' was a nondescript sort of meal. It consisted of meat and vegetables, and tea and cakes and puddings, all placed on the table together. It was the one hearty meal Dr. Staunton allowed himself in the twenty-four hours. At the children's early dinner he only snatched a little bread and cheese, but at peaceful seven o'clock the children were in bed, the house was quiet, the toil of the day was supposed to be over, and Dr. Staunton could eat heartily and enjoy himself. It was at this hour he used to notice how very pretty Effie looked, and how sweet it was to see her sitting like a little mouse on one side of the table, helping him and his wife in her affectionate way, and seeing to the comforts of all. It did not occur to him as even possible that Effie could carry such a dreadful thing as rebellion in her heart. No face could look more perfectly happy than hers. Was it possible that she was pining for a wider field of usefulness than the little niche which she filled so perfectly in the home life? Dr. Staunton never thought about it at all. Effie was just a dear little girl--not a bit modern; she was the comfort of her mother's life, and, for that matter, the comfort of his also.  He looked at her now with his usual grave smile. \"Well, Effie, useful and charming as usual? I see you have not forgotten my favorite dish, and I am glad of it, for I can tell you I am just starving. I have had a hard day's work, and it is nice to feel that I can rest for this evening at least.\"  \"Have you been to the Watsons', dear?\" inquired Mrs. Staunton. \"They sent a message for you two or three hours ago.\"  \"Yes; I met the farmer in the High Street, and went straight out to the farm. Mrs. Watson is better now, poor soul; but it is a bad case, the heart is a good deal implicated. I shall have to go out there again the first thing in the morning. It would be a dreadful thing for that family if anything happened to her.\"  \"The heart--is it heart trouble?\" said Mrs. Staunton.  \"Yes, yes! Don't you begin to fancy that your case is the least like hers; yours is only functional, hers is organic. Now, why have I broken through my rule of saying nothing about my patients? You will be fancying and fretting all night that you are going to shuffle off this mortal coil just as quickly as poor Mrs. Watson will have to do before long, I fear. Why, Effie, what is the matter? Why are you staring at me with those round eyes?\"  Mrs. Staunton looked also at Effie, and the sudden memory of her recent conversation with her returned.  \"By the way,\" she said, \"if you are likely to be at home this evening, John, Effie would like to ask her friend Dorothy Fraser to come in for an hour or two. She wants to introduce her to you.\"  \"She is one of those modern girls, is she not?\" said the doctor.  \"Oh, father, she is just splendid,\" said Effie. \"If you only knew her, if you could hear her speak----\"  \"Well, my dear, don't get into a state, and above all things, don't learn that dreadful habit of exaggeration. I dare say Miss Fraser is very well, but there are few prodigies in the world, my little Effie; and, for my part, give me the home birds--they are the girls for my world; they are the girls who will make good wives by and by. There, my love, I shall be pleased to welcome any friend of yours, so ask her over, by all means. She won't mind the old doctor's pipe, I hope?\"  \"Oh, no, father!\" Effie could not help smiling. She knew perfectly well that Dorothy thought it no harm to indulge in a tiny cigarette herself, not often, nor every day, but sometimes when she was dead beat, as she expressed it. Effie had to keep this knowledge of her friend's delinquencies to herself. If Dr. Staunton knew that Dorothy did not consider smoking the unpardonable sin in woman, he would not allow her inside his doors. \"I will go and fetch her,\" Effie said, jumping up and putting on her hat. \"She is longing to know you, father, and you can smoke two or three pipes while she is here.\"  Effie left the room. Mrs. Staunton looked at her husband. \"I doubt if Dorothy Fraser is the best of friends for our Effie.\"  \"Eh!\" said the doctor, taking his pipe out of his mouth for a moment. \"What ails the girl?\"  \"Oh, nothing at all,\" replied Mrs. Staunton. \"Effie is very fond of her, and I believe she really is a fine creature. You know she is educating her two brothers.\"  \"What is she doing--how does she earn her living?\"  \"Oh, she is a nurse in a hospital. She has been in St. Joseph's Hospital for years, and is now superintendent of one of the wards. She gets a good salary.\"  The doctor rubbed his hands together in a somewhat impatient way. \"You know my opinion of lady nurses,\" he said, looking at his wife.  \"Well, dear, make the best of Dorothy for Effie's sake. I hear the steps of the two girls now. You will do what you can to be agreeable, won't you?\"  \"No,\" said the doctor; \"I shall growl like a bear with a sore head, when I see women who ought to be content with sweet home duties struggling and pining to go out into the world.\"  The last words had scarcely left the doctor's lips before the dining-room door was opened, and Effie, accompanied by her friend, entered the room.  Dorothy Fraser was about twenty-eight years of age; she was tall; she had a fair, calm sort of face; her eyes were large and gray, her mouth sweet. She had a way of taking possession of those she spoke to, and she had not been two minutes in the shabby little sitting-room before Dr. and Mrs. Staunton were looking at her earnestly and listening to her words with respect.  Dorothy sat near Mrs. Staunton.  \"I am very glad to know you,\" she said, after a pause. \"Effie has talked to me over and over again about you.\"  \"May I ask how long you have known Effie?\" interrupted Dr. Staunton.  \"Well, exactly a week,\" replied Miss Fraser. \"I have been home a week, and I am going to stay another week. I met Effie the night I came home, and---- But one can cultivate a friendship in a week; don't you think so, Dr. Staunton?\"  \"Perhaps, perhaps,\" said the doctor in a dubious voice. \"I am slow in making friends myself. It is the old-fashioned way of country folk.\"  \"Oh, pray don't speak of yourself as old-fashioned, Dr. Staunton; and don't run down country folk, I see so many of them at the hospital. For my part, I think they are worth twenty of those poor London people, who are half starved in body, and have only learned the wicked side of life.\"  \"Poor creatures!\" said Mrs. Staunton. \"I wish you would tell us something about the hospital, my dear. It is vastly entertaining to hear all about sick people.\"  \"No; now pardon me,\" said the doctor; \"you will do nothing of the kind, Miss Fraser. There are not many sick folk about here, but what few there are I have got to look after, and my thoughts are bothered enough about them and their sicknesses, so I would rather, if you please, turn our conversation to people who are not ill. The wife here is a bit nervous, too, and she is never the better for hearing people talk about what they call 'bad cases.' I think it is the worst thing in the world for people to keep talking of their maladies, or even about other people's maladies. My motto is this, 'When you are ill, try and see how soon you can get well again, and when you are well, try to keep so. Never think of illness at all.'\"  Miss Fraser looked fully at the doctor while he was talking. A slight frown came between her eyebrows. Effie's bright dark eyes were fixed on her friend.  \"Illness interests me, of course,\" Dorothy said, after a pause; \"but I won't talk of it. There are many other things, as you say, just as vital.\"  \"Well, at any rate,\" said Mrs. Staunton, \"Miss Fraser can tell us how she came to be a nurse----\"  \"For my part,\" interrupted Dr. Staunton, \"I think it is a great pity that girls like you, Miss Fraser, should take up that sort of life. Lady girls are not suited to it; for one who is fitted for the life, there are fifty who are not. If you could only guess how doctors hate to see lady nurses in possession of a case. She is a fine lady through it all; she thinks she is not, but she is. Do you suppose she will wash up the cups and plates and spoons as they ought to be washed and kept in a sick person's room? and do you fancy she will clean out the grate, and go down on her knees to wash the floor? Your fine lady nurse won't. There is a case of infection, for instance,--measles or scarlet fever,--and the nurse comes down from London, and she is supposed to take possession; but one of the servants of the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19761"],["title","A Girl in Ten Thousand (#2)"],["body","has to go in to clean and dust and arrange, or the sickroom is not dusted or cleaned at all. That is your lady nurse; and I say she is not suited to the work.\"  Miss Fraser turned pale while the doctor was speaking.  \"You must admit,\" she said, when he stopped and looked at her,--\"you must admit, Dr. Staunton, that every lady nurse is not like that. If you have an infection case in your practice, send for me. I think I can prove to you that there are some ladies who are too truly women to think anything menial or beneath them.\" She colored as she spoke, and lowered her eyes.  The conversation drifted into other channels. After a time Dorothy got up and went away; and Effie, yawning slightly, went up to her room to go to bed. She slept in a little room next to the nursery. Instead of undressing at once, as was her wont, she went and stood by the window, threw it open, and looked out. \"What would father say if he knew my thoughts?\" she said to herself. \"He despises ladies who are nurses; he thinks it wrong for any lady girl to go away from home; but I am going--yes, I am going to London. Dorothy is my friend. She is about the grandest, noblest creature I ever met, and I am going to follow in her steps. Mother will consent in the end--mother will see that I cannot throw away my life. Dear mother! I shall miss her and father awfully, but, all the same, I shall be delighted to go. I do want to get out of this narrow, narrow life; I do want to do something big and grand. Oh, Dorothy, how splendid you are! How strong you look! How delightful it is to feel that one can live a life like yours, and do good, and be loved by all! Oh, Dorothy, I hope I shall be able to copy you! I hope----\"  Effie's eager thoughts came to a sudden stop. A tall dog-cart dashed down the street and pulled up short at her father's door. A young man in a Norfolk suit jumped out, threw the horse's reins to his groom, and pulled the doctor's bell furiously. Effie leaned slightly out of her window in order to see who it was. She recognized the man who stood on the doorstep with a start of surprise, and the color flew into her face. He was the young Squire of the neighborhood. His name was Harvey. His place was two miles out of Whittington. He was married; his wife was the most beautiful woman Effie had ever seen; and he had one little girl. The Harveys were rich and proud; they spent the greater part of their time in London, and had never before condescended to consult the village doctor. What was the matter now? Effie rushed from her room and knocked furiously at her father's door.  \"Father, do you hear the night-bell? Are you getting up?\" she called.  \"Yes, child, yes,\" answered the doctor.  The bell downstairs kept on ringing at intervals. Effie stood trembling on the landing; she felt positively sure that something dreadful must have happened.  \"May I go down stairs and say you are coming, father?\" she called again through the key-hole.  \"Yes, I wish you would. Say I will be downstairs in a minute.\"  Effie ran off; she took the chain off the heavy hall door and threw it open.  \"Is Dr. Staunton in?\" asked the Squire. He stared at Effie's white trembling face. His eyes were bloodshot, his hair in disorder; he looked like a man who is half distracted.  \"Yes,\" said Effie, in as soothing a voice as she could assume; \"my father will be down in a minute.\"  Harvey took off his cap.  \"You are Miss Staunton, I presume? Pray ask your father to be as quick as possible. My little girl is ill--very ill. We want a doctor to come to The Grange without a moment's delay.\"  \"All right, Squire; here I am,\" said the hearty voice of Dr. Staunton on the stairs.  The Squire shook hands with him, made one or two remarks in too low a voice for Effie to hear, sprang into his dog-cart, the doctor scrambled up by his side, and a moment later the two had disappeared. Effie stood by the open hall door looking up and down the quiet village street. The great man of the place had come and gone like a flash. The thing Mrs. Staunton had longed for, dreamed of, and almost prayed for, had come to pass at last--her husband was sent for to The Grange. Effie wondered if Fortune were really turning her wheel, and if, from this date they would be better off than they had been.  Dorothy Fraser's people lived in the house nearly opposite. From where Effie stood she could see a light still burning in her friend's window. The thought of Dorothy raised the girl's state of excitement almost to fever pitch. She longed to go over and see her friend; she knew she must not do that, however. She shut the hall door, and went slowly back to her bedroom. She wanted to sleep, but sleep was far away. She lay listening during the long hours of the summer night, and heard hour after hour strike from the church clock close by. Between two and three in the morning she dropped off into a troubled doze. She awoke in broad daylight, to start to her feet and see her father standing in the room.  \"Get up, Effie,\" he said. \"I want you; dress yourself as quickly as you can.\"  There was an expression about his face which prevented Effie's uttering a word. She scrambled into her clothes--he waited for her on the landing. When she was dressed he took her hand and went softly down through the house.  \"I do not want your mother to be disturbed,\" he said. \"There is a very bad case of illness at The Grange.\"  \"What is it, father?\" asked Effie.  \"Well, I fear that it is a complication of scarlet fever and diphtheria. The child will have an awful fight for her life, and at the present moment I am afraid the odds are terribly against her.\"  \"Oh, father, and she is the only child!\" said Effie.  \"Yes, yes, I know all that; but there is no use in going into sentiment just now--the thing is to pull her through if possible. Now, look here: I can send to London, of course, for a nurse, but she would not arrive for several hours--do you think your friend Miss Fraser would undertake the case?\"  \"Yes, I am sure she would,\" said Effie.  \"That's just like you women,\" said the doctor impatiently; \"you jump to conclusions without knowing anything at all about the matter. The child's case is horribly infectious. In fact, I shall be surprised if the illness does not run right through the house. The mother has been sitting up with this baby day and night for the last week, and they were so silly they never sent for a doctor, imagining that the awful state of the throat was due to hoarseness, and that the rash was what they were pleased to call 'spring heat.' The folly of some people is enough to drive any reasonable man to despair. They send for the doctor, forsooth, when the child is almost in the grip of death! I have managed to relieve her a bit during the night, but I must have the services of a good nurse at once. Go over and awake Miss Fraser, Effie, and bring her to see me. If she has the pluck she gave me to understand she had, she will come in as a stop-gap until I get somebody else. And now, look here: the case is so infectious, and your mother is so weak just now, that I am going to devote myself altogether to it for the next few days. I am going to take up my abode at The Grange, and I shall wire to my old friend Edwards to look after the rest of my patients. There are only half a dozen to be seen to, and he will keep them quiet until I am free again. Now go over and bring Miss Fraser for me to see. I have driven down on the Squire's dog-cart, and will take her back with me if she will come. Run along, Effie, and wake her up.\"     CHAPTER II.   Dorothy Fraser was sound asleep when Effie rushed into her little room.  \"Get up!\" said Effie, shaking her friend by the shoulder.  As a nurse Miss Fraser was accustomed to unexpected disturbances. She opened her eyes now and gazed at Effie for a bewildered moment, then she sat up in bed and pushed back her heavy hair.  \"Why, Effie,\" she exclaimed, \"what do you want? I fancied I was back at St. Joseph's and that one of the nurses had got into trouble and had come to me, but I find I am at home for the holidays. Surely it is not time to get up yet?\"  \"It is only five o'clock,\" said Effie. \"It is not the usual time to get up; but, Dorothy, father wants you. There is a bad case of illness at The Grange--very bad indeed, and father is nearly distracted, and he wants to know if you will help him just for a bit.\"  \"Why, of course,\" cried Dorothy. \"I shall be delighted.\"  \"I knew you would; I knew you were just that splendid sort of a girl.\"  Miss Fraser knit her brows in some perplexity \"Don't, Effie,\" she said. \"I wish you would not go into such ecstasies over me; I am only just a nurse. A nurse is, and ought to be, at the beck and call of everyone who is in trouble. Now run away, dear; I won't be any time in getting dressed. I will join you and your father in a minute.\"  \"Father will see you in the street,\" said Effie. \"The fact is----\"  \"Oh, do run away,\" exclaimed Dorothy. \"I cannot dress while you stand here talking. Whatever it is, I will be with your father in two or three minutes.\"  Effie ran downstairs again. Mrs. Fraser, who had let her in, had gone back to bed. Effie shut the Frasers' hall door as quietly as she could. She then went across the sunlit and empty street to where her father stood on the steps at his own door. The groom who had driven the doctor over was standing by the horse's head at a little distance.  \"Well,\" said Dr. Staunton, \"she has fought shy of it, has she?\"  \"No; she is dressing,\" said Effie. \"She will be down in a minute or two.\"  \"Good girl!\" said Dr. Staunton. \"You didn't happen to mention the nature of the case?\"  \"No, no,\" answered Effie; \"but the nature of the case won't make any difference to her.\"  The doctor pursed up his mouth as if he meant to whistle; he restrained himself, however, and stood looking down the street. After a time he turned and glanced at his daughter.  \"Now, Effie,\" he said, \"you must do all you can for your mother. Don't"]]]
