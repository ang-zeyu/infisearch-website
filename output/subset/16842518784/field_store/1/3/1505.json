Extracts of pyrethrum flowers are now generally available commercially, and these give fairly good results in the destruction of house flies in buildings. Most of the sprays of pyrethrum extract contain kerosene oil as a carrier, and undoubtedly the kerosene has much to do with the toxicity of the spray. Such materials are most applicable to buildings which become infested with flies and which can be readily closed up at night and the air within thoroughly saturated with the spray by means of an atomizer. Under such conditions the flies are rather quickly overcome by the spray and if a sufficient quantity is used they will not revive.   FLYTRAPS.  Flytraps may be used to advantage in decreasing the number of flies. Their use has been advocated not only because of the immediate results, but because of the chances that the flies may be caught before they lay eggs, and the number of future generations will be reduced greatly.  Many types of flytraps are on the market. As a rule the larger ones are the more effective. Anyone with a few tools can construct flytraps for a small part of the price of the ready-made ones. A trap (fig. 8) which is very effective in catching flies and is easily made, durable, and cheap, may be made of four barrel hoops, four laths, a few strips of boxing, and 8 1/2 lineal feet of screening, 24 inches wide. (For greater details see Farmers' Bulletin 734.)  The effectiveness of the traps will depend on the selection of baits. A good bait for catching house flies is 1 part of blackstrap molasses to 3 parts of water, after the mixture has been allowed to ferment for a day or two. Overripe or fermenting bananas crushed and placed in the bait pans give good results, especially with milk added to them. A mixture of equal parts brown sugar and curd of sour milk, thoroughly moistened, gives good results after it has been allowed to stand for three or four days.     PREVENTING THE BREEDING OF FLIES.   As previously stated, fly papers, poisons, and traps are at best only temporary expedients. The most logical method of abating the fly nuisance is the elimination or treatment of all breeding places. It would appear from what is known of the life history and habits of the common house fly that it is perfectly feasible for cities and towns to reduce the numbers of this annoying and dangerous insect so greatly as to render it of comparatively slight account. On farms also, in dairies, and under rural conditions generally, much can and should be done to control the fly, which here, as elsewhere, constitutes a very serious menace to health.   CONSTRUCTION AND CARE OF STABLES.  In formulating rules for the construction and care of stables and the disposal of manure the following points must be taken into consideration. In the first place, the ground of soil-floor stables may offer a suitable place for the development of fly larvæ. The larvæ will migrate from the manure to the soil and continue their growth in the moist ground. This takes place to some extent even when the manure is removed from the stables every day. Even wooden floors are not entirely satisfactory unless they are perfectly water-tight, since larvæ will crawl through the cracks and continue their development in the moist ground below. Water-tight floors of concrete or masonry, therefore, are desirable. Flies have been found to breed in surprising numbers in small accumulations of material in the corners of feed troughs and mangers, and it is important that such places be kept clean.   FLY-TIGHT MANURE PITS.  The Bureau of Entomology for a number of years has advised that manure from horse stables be kept in fly-tight pits or bins. Such pits can be built in or attached to the stable so that manure can be easily thrown in at the time of cleaning and so constructed that the manure can be readily removed. It is desirable that the manure be placed in these fly-proof receptacles as soon as possible after it is voided. The essential point is that flies be prevented from reaching the manure, and for this reason the pit or bin must be tightly constructed, preferably of concrete, and the lid kept closed except when the manure is being thrown in or removed. The difficulty has been that manure often becomes infested before it is put into the container, and flies frequently breed out before it is emptied and often escape through the cracks. To obviate these difficulties a manure box or pit with a modified tent trap or cone trap attached is desirable.  In order to retain the fertilizing value of manure to the greatest extent it is advisable that air be excluded from it as much as possible and that it be protected from the leaching action of rains. This being the case, there is really no necessity for covering a large portion of the top of the box with a trap, but merely to have holes large enough to attract flies to the light, and to cover these holes with ordinary conical traps, with the legs cut off, so, that the bottoms of the traps will fit closely to the box. The same arrangement can be made where manure is kept in a pit. If manure boxes or pits are kept fly tight they are satisfactory under farm or dairy conditions for the storage of manure during the busy season when it can not be hauled out daily.   FREQUENCY WITH WHICH MANURE SHOULD BE REMOVED IN CITIES AND TOWNS.  In deciding the question as to how often manure should be removed in cities and towns, it should be borne in mind that when the larvæ have finished feeding they will often leave the manure and pupate in the ground below or crawl some distance away to pupate in débris under boards or stones and the like. Hence the manure should be removed before the larvæ reach the migratory stage; that is to say, removal is necessary every three days, and certainly not less frequently than twice a week during the summer months. A series of orders issued in 1906 by the health department of the District of Columbia, on the authority of the Commissioners of the District, covers most of these points, and these orders, which may well serve as a model to other communities desiring to undertake similar measures, may be briefly condensed as follows:      HEALTH OFFICE REGULATIONS FOR CONTROL OF HOUSE FLIES IN CITIES.       All stalls in which animals are kept shall have the surface of the      ground covered with a water-tight floor. Every person occupying a      building where domestic animals are kept shall maintain in      connection therewith a bin or pit for the reception of manure and,      pending the removal from the premises of the manure from the animal      or animals, shall place such manure in said bin or pit. This bin      shall be so constructed as to exclude rain water and shall in all      other respects be water-tight, except as it may be connected with      the public sewer. It shall be provided with a suitable cover and      constructed so as to prevent the ingress and egress of flies. No      person owning a stable shall keep any manure or permit any manure      to be kept in or upon any portion of the premises other than the      bin or pit described, nor shall he allow any such bin or pit to be      overfilled or needlessly uncovered. Horse manure may be kept      tightly rammed into well-covered barrels for the purpose of removal      in such barrels. Every person keeping manure in the more densely      populated parts of the District shall cause all such manure to be      removed from the premises at least twice every week between June 1      and October 31, and at least once every week between November 1 and      May 31 of the following year. No person shall remove or transport      any manure over any public highway in any of the more densely      populated parts of the District except in a tight vehicle, which,      if not inclosed, must be effectually covered with canvas, so as to      prevent the manure from being dropped. No person shall deposit      manure removed from the bins or pits within any of the more densely      populated parts of the District without a permit from the health      officer. Any person violating any of the provisions shall, upon      conviction thereof, be punished by a fine of not more than $40 for      each offense.  Not only must horse stables be cared for, but chicken yards, piggeries, and garbage receptacles as well. In cities, with better methods of disposal of garbage and with the lessening of the number of horses and horse stables consequent upon electric street railways, bicycles, and automobiles, the time may come, and before very long, when window screens may be discarded.   DISPOSAL OF MANURE IN RURAL AND SUBURBAN DISTRICTS.  The control of flies in rural and suburban districts offers a much more difficult problem. Here it is often out of the question to remove all manure from the premises twice a week, and the problem is to find some method of disposal or storage which will conserve the fertilizing value of the manure and at the same time prevent all flies from breeding, or destroy such as do breed there.  With this idea in mind, it has been recommended that stable manure be collected every morning and hauled out at once and spread rather thinly on the fields. This procedure is advisable from the point of view of getting the maximum fertilizing value from the manure. Immediate spreading on the fields is said largely to prevent the loss of plant food which occurs when manure is allowed to stand in heaps for a long time. This method will be effective in preventing the breeding of flies only if the manure is hauled out promptly every morning and spread thinly so that it will dry, since it is unfavorable for fly development in desiccated condition. The proper scattering of the manure on the fields is best and most easily and quickly accomplished by the use of a manure spreader, and many dairies, and even farms, are practicing the daily distribution of manure in this way.

I'm so sorry for you, papa, and I mean to do all I can to supply his place. What do you suppose Maxie is doing just now, papa?\"  \"Doubtless he is in his room preparing his lessons for to-morrow. The bugle-call for evening study-hour sounds at half-past seven, and the lads must be busy with their books till half-after nine.\"  He drew out his watch, and glancing at its face, \"Ah, it is just nine o'clock,\" he said. \"Kiss me good-night, daughter, and go back to your berth.\"     CHAPTER II.   Max was in his room at the Academy, busy with his tasks, trying determinately to forget homesickness by giving his whole mind to them, and succeeding fairly well. Very desirous, very determined was the lad to acquit himself to the very best of his ability that he might please and honor both his Heavenly Father and his earthly one.  By the time the welcome sound of gun-fire and tattoo announced that the day's work was over he felt fully prepared for the morrow's recitations. But he was in no mood for play. The quiet that had reigned through the building for the last two hours was suddenly broken in upon by sounds of mirth and jollity--merry boyish voices talking, singing, some accompanying themselves with the twang of a banjo or the tinkle of a guitar; but Max, closing and putting his book aside, kept his seat, his elbow on the desk, his head on his hand, while with a far-away look in his dark eyes, he indulged in a waking dream.  He seemed to see the _Dolphin_ steaming down the bay, his father, perhaps, sitting in the saloon with the other grown folks (the younger ones would be pretty sure to have retired to their state-rooms), and thinking and speaking of his absent son. Or, it might be, pacing the deck alone, his heart going up in prayer to God for his first-born--his \"might and the beginning of his strength,\"--that he might be kept from sin and every danger and evil and enabled to prove himself a brave, true follower of Christ, never ashamed or afraid to show his colors and let it be known to all with whom he had to do that he was a disciple, a servant of the dear Lord Jesus.  \"Lord, help me; help me to be brave and faithful and true,\" was the silent petition that went up from the boy's heart.  \"Homesick, bub?\" asked a boyish voice, in mocking tones. \"I believe most of the fellows are just at the first, but they get over it after a bit without much doctoring.\"  \"I'm inclined to think it is not a dangerous kind of ailment,\" returned Max, in a pleasant tone, lifting his head and turning toward his companion with a smile that seemed rather forced. \"However, I was thinking not of home, exactly, but the homefolks who are just at present aboard my father's yacht and steaming down the bay.\"  It was only by a great effort he repressed a sigh with the concluding words.  \"That's a handsome yacht and about the largest I ever saw,\" was the next remark of his room-mate, a lad--Benjamin Hunt by name--of about the same age as himself, not particularly handsome but with a good, honest face.  \"Yes, and a splendid sailor,\" returned Max, with enthusiasm. \"Papa bought her this summer and we've had a jolly good time sailing or steaming (sometimes one and again the other, the _Dolphin_ has both sails and engines) along the coast and a short distance out to sea.\"  \"Had a good, safe captain?\" Hunt asked, with a quizzical smile.  \"My father, a retired naval officer; there could be none better,\" returned Max, straightening himself slightly, while the color deepened on his cheek.  \"Yes; I don't wonder you are proud of him,\" laughed Hunt. \"I happened to see him when he brought you here, and I must say I thought he had a fine military bearing and was--well, I think I might say one of the handsomest men I ever saw.\"  \"Thank you,\" said Max heartily, glancing up at Hunt with a gratified smile. \"I suppose being so fond of him I may not be a competent judge, but to me my father seems the best, the noblest, and the handsomest man that ever lived.\"  \"Didn't force you to come here against your will, eh?\" queried Hunt jestingly.  \"No, indeed! he only let me come because I wanted to. I think he would have been glad if I had chosen the ministry, but you see I don't think I have any talent in that line, and I inherit a love for the sea, and papa says a man can do best in the profession or business that is most to his taste, so that perhaps I may be more useful as a naval officer than I could be in the ministry.\"  \"Especially in case of war, and if you turn out a good and capable commander,\" returned Hunt, tossing up a ball and catching it as it fell. \"I sometimes think I'd like nothing better; a fellow would have a chance to distinguish himself, such as he could never hope for in time of peace.\"  \"Yes; and if such a thing should happen I hope it will be when I'm ready to take part in the defence of my country,\" said Max, his cheek flushing and his eyes kindling, \"but war is an awful thing considering all the killing and maiming, to say nothing of the destruction of property; and I hope our country will never be engaged in another. But excuse me,\" he added, opening his Bible, \"I see we have scarcely fifteen minutes now before taps will sound.\"  At that Hunt moved away to his own side of the room, from whence he watched Max furtively, a mocking smile on his lips.  Max was uncomfortably conscious of it, but tried to ignore it and give his thoughts to what he was reading. Presently, closing his book he knelt and silently offered up his evening prayer, asking forgiveness of all his sins, strength to resist temptation, and never be afraid or ashamed to own himself a follower of Jesus, his loving disciple, his servant, whose greatest desire was to know and do the Master's will; and very earnestly he prayed that no evil might befall his dearly loved and honored father, his sisters or brother, Mamma Vi, or any of those he loved; that they might be taken safely through all their journeying, and he permitted to see them all again when the right time should come; and having committed both them and himself to the watchful care of his Heavenly Father, he rose from his knees and began his preparations for bed.  \"Well, sonny, I hope you will sleep soundly and well after saying your prayers like the goodest of little boys,\" sneered Hunt.  \"I shall sleep none the worse,\" returned Max pleasantly.  \"I'll bet not a bit better than I shall without going through any such baby-like performance.\"  \"God is very good and often takes care of those who don't ask him to,\" said Max; \"but I don't think they have any right to expect it; also I am sure I should be shamefully ungrateful if I were to lie down for my night's rest without a word of thanks to him for his protecting care over me and mine through the day that is just past. As to its being a baby-like performance, it is one in which some of the greatest, as well as best men, have indulged. Washington was a man of prayer. So was General Daniel Morgan--that grand revolutionary officer who whipped Tarleton so completely at the battle of the Cowpens. There was Macdonough also, who gained that splendid victory over the British on Lake Champlain in the war of 1812-14. Have you forgotten that just before the fight began, after he had put springs on his cables, had the decks cleared, and everything was ready for action, with his officers and men around him, he knelt down near one of his heaviest guns and in a few words asked God to help him in the coming struggle? He might well do that, because, as you know of course, we were in the right, fighting against oppression and wrongs fit to rouse the indignation of the most patient and forbearing of mortals.\"  \"That's a fact!\" interrupted Hunt. \"Americans have always been forbearing at the start; but let them get once thoroughly roused and they make things hot enough for the aggressors.\"  \"So they do,\" said Max, \"and so I think they always will; I hope so, anyhow; for I don't believe it's right for any nation to allow any of its people to be so dreadfully wronged and ill-treated as thousands of our poor sailors were, by the English, before the war of 1812 taught them better. I don't believe the mass of the English people approved, but they couldn't keep their aristocracy--who hated republicanism, and wanted always to continue superior in station and power to the mass of their countrymen and ours--from oppressing and abusing our poor sailors, impressing, flogging, and ill-treating them in various ways, and to such a degree that it makes one's blood boil in reading or thinking of it. And I think it's right enough for one to be angry and indignant at such wrongs to others.\"  \"Of course it is,\" said Hunt; \"and Americans always will resist oppression--of themselves or their weaker brethren--and I glory in the fact. What a fight that was of Macdonough's! Do you remember the incident of the gamecock?\"  \"No; what was it?\"  \"It seems that one of the shots from the British vessel _Linnet_ demolished a hencoop on the deck of the _Saratoga_, releasing this gamecock, and that he flew to a gun-slide, where he alighted, then clapped his wings and crowed lustily.  \"That delighted our sailors, who accepted the incident as an omen of the victory that crowned their arms before the fight was over. They cheered and felt their courage strengthened.\"  \"Good!\" said Max, \"that cock was at better business than the fighting he had doubtless been brought up to.\"  \"Yes; so say I:            \"O Johnny Bull, my joe John,              Behold on Lake Champlain,            With more than equal force, John,              You tried your fist again;            But the cock saw how 'twas going.              And cried 'Cock-a-doodle-doo,'            And Macdonough was victorious,              Johnny Bull, my joe!\"  \"Pretty good,\" laughed Max. \"But there are the taps;"]]]
