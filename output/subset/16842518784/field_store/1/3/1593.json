In every mining camp containing 1,000 men, 4.86 were taken by violent death in that year. In the mining of coal in Great Britain, 1.31 men were killed in every 1,000 employed in the same year; in France, 1.1; in Belgium, 0.94, or less than 1 man in every 1,000 employed. It is thus seen that from three to four times as many men are being killed in the United States as in any European coal-producing country. This safer condition in Europe has resulted from the use of safer explosives, or the better use of the explosives available; from the reduction in the use of open lights; from the establishment of mine rescue stations and the training with artificial breathing apparatus; and from the adoption of regulations for safeguarding the lives of the workmen.  The mining engineering field force of the Geological Survey, at the head of which is Mr. George S. Rice, an experienced mining and consulting engineer, has already made great progress in the study of underground mining conditions and methods. Nearly all the more dangerous coal mines in the United States have been examined; samples of gas, coal, and dust have been taken and analyzed at the chemical laboratories at Pittsburg; extended tests have been made as to the explosibility of various mixtures of gas and air; as to the explosibility of dust from various typical coals; as to the chemical composition and physical characteristics of this dust; the degree of fineness necessary to the most explosive conditions; and the methods of dampening the dust by water, by humidifying, by steam, or of deadening its explosibility by the addition of calcium chloride, stone dust, etc. A bulletin outlining the results thus far obtained in the study of the coal-dust problem is now in course of publication.[3]  After reviewing the history of observations and experiments with coal dust carried on in Europe, and later, the experiments at the French, German, Belgian, and English explosives-testing stations, this bulletin takes up the coal-dust question in the United States. Further chapters concern the tests as to the explosibility of coal dust, made by the Geological Survey, at Pittsburg; investigations, both at the Pittsburg laboratory and in mines, as to the humidity of mine air. There is also a chapter on the chemical investigations into the ignition of coal dust by Dr. J. C. W. Frazer, of the Geological Survey. The application of some of these data to actual mine conditions in Europe, in the last year, is treated by Mr. Axel Larsen; the use of exhaust steam in a mine of the Consolidation Coal Company, in West Virginia, is discussed by Mr. Frank Haas, Consulting Engineer; and the use of sprays in Oklahoma coal mines is the subject of a chapter by Mr. Carl Scholz, Vice-President of the Rock Island Coal Mining Company.  An earlier bulletin setting forth the literature and certain mine investigations of explosive gases and dust,[4] has already been issued. After treating of methods of collecting and analyzing the gases found in mines, of investigations as to the rate of liberation of gas from coal, and of studies on coal dust, this bulletin discusses such factors as the restraining influence of shale dust and dampness on coal-dust explosions. It then takes up practical considerations as to the danger of explosions, including the relative inflammability of old and fresh coal dust. The problems involved are undergoing further investigation and elaboration, in the light of information already gathered.  _Permissible Explosives._--The most important progress in these tests and investigations has been made in those relating to the various explosives used in getting coal from mines. Immediately upon the enactment of the first legislation, in the spring of 1908, arrangements were perfected whereby the lower portion of the old Arsenal grounds belonging to the War Department and adjacent to the Pennsylvania Railroad, on the Alleghany River, at 40th and Butler Streets, Pittsburg, Pa., were transferred to the Interior Department for use in these investigations. Meantime, in anticipation of the appropriation, Mr. Clarence Hall, an engineer experienced in the manufacture and use of explosives, was sent to Europe to study the methods of testing explosives practiced at the Government stations in Great Britain, Germany, Belgium, and France. Mr. Joseph A. Holmes also visited Europe for the purpose of studying methods of ameliorating conditions in the mines. Three foreign mining experts, the chiefs of investigating bureaus in Belgium, Germany, and England, spent three months studying conditions in the United States at the invitation of the Secretary of the Interior, to whom they submitted a valuable report.[5]  Under the supervision of the writer, Chief Engineer of these investigations, detailed plans and specifications had been prepared in advance for the necessary apparatus and the transformation of the buildings at Pittsburg to the purposes of this work. It was possible, therefore, to undertake immediately the changes in existing buildings, the erection of new buildings, the installation of railway tracks, laboratories, and the plumbing, heating, and lighting plant, etc. This work was carried on with unusual expedition, under the direction of the Assistant Chief Engineer, Mr. James C. Roberts, and was completed within a few months, by which time most of the apparatus was delivered and installed.  One building (No. 17) is devoted to the smaller physical tests of explosives. It was rendered fire resistant by heavily covering the floors, ceiling, and walls with cement on metal lath, and otherwise protecting the openings. In it are installed apparatus for determining calorific value of explosives, pressure produced on ignition, susceptibility to ignition when dropped, rate of detonation, length and duration of flame, and kindred factors. Elsewhere on the grounds is a gallery of boiler-steel plate, 100 ft. long and more than 6 ft. in diameter, solidly attached to a mass of concrete at one end, in which is embedded a cannon from which to discharge the explosive under test, and open at the other end, and otherwise so constructed as to simulate a small section of a mine gallery (Fig. 2, Plate VI). The heavy mortar pendulum, for the pendulum test for determining the force produced by an explosive, is near by, as is also an armored pit in which large quantities of explosive may be detonated, with a view to studying the effects of magazine explosions, and for testing as to the rate at which ignition of an explosive travels from one end to the other of a cartridge, and the sensitiveness of one cartridge to explosion by discharge of another near by.    [Illustration: PLATE VI.    Fig. 1.--Explosion from Coal Dust in Gas and Dust Gallery No. 1.    Fig. 2.--Mine Gallery No. 1.    Fig. 3.--Ballistic Pendulum.]  In another building (No. 21), is a well-equipped chemical laboratory for chemical analyses and investigations of explosives, structural materials, and fuels.  Several months were required to calibrate the various apparatus, and to make analyses of the available natural gas to determine the correct method of proportioning it with air, so as to produce exact mixtures of 2, 4, 6, or 8% of methane with air. Tests of existing explosives were made in air and in inflammable mixtures of air and gas, with a view to fixing on some standard explosive as a basis of comparison. Ultimately, 40% nitro-glycerine dynamite was adopted as the standard. Investigative tests having been made, and the various factors concerning all the explosives on the market having been determined, a circular was sent to all manufacturers of explosives in the United States, on January 9th, 1909, and was also published in the various technical journals, through the associated press, and otherwise.  On May 15th, 1909, all the explosives which had been offered for test, as permissible, having been tested, the first list of permissible explosives was issued, as given in the following circular:    “EXPLOSIVES CIRCULAR NO. 1.   “DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR.   “United States Geological Survey.   “May 15, 1909.    “LIST OF PERMISSIBLE EXPLOSIVES.   “Tested prior to May 15, 1909.    “As a part of the investigation of mine explosions authorized by   Congress in May, 1908, it was decided by the Secretary of the Interior   that a careful examination should be made of the various explosives   used in mining operations, with a view to determining the extent to   which the use of such explosives might be responsible for the   occurrence of these disasters.    “The preliminary investigation showed the necessity of subjecting to   rigid tests all explosives intended for use in mines where either gas   or dry inflammable dust is present in quantity or under conditions   which are indicative of danger.    “With this in view, a letter was sent by the Director of the United   States Geological Survey on January 9, 1909, to the manufacturers of   explosives in the United States, setting forth the conditions under   which these explosives would be examined and the nature of the tests   to which they would be subjected.    “Inasmuch as the conditions and tests described in this letter were   subsequently followed in testing the explosives given in the list   below, they are here reproduced, as follows:    “(1) The manufacturer is to furnish 100 pounds of each explosive which   he desires to have tested; he is to be responsible for the care,   handling, and delivery of this material at the testing station on the   United States arsenal grounds, Fortieth and Butler streets, Pittsburg,   Pa., at the time the explosive is to be tested; and he is to have a   representative present during the tests, who will be responsible for   the handling of the packages containing the explosives until they are   opened"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18448"],["title","Transactions of the American Society of Civil Engineers, vol.

No test will be made of any new explosive which is not now   being manufactured and marketed, until all explosives now on the   market that may be offered for testing have been tested.    “(5) A list of the explosives which pass certain requirements   satisfactorily will be furnished to the state mine inspectors, and   will be made public in such further manner as may be considered   desirable.    “TEST REQUIREMENTS FOR EXPLOSIVES.    “The tests will be made by the engineers of the United States   Explosives Testing Station at Pittsburg, Pa., in gas and dust gallery   No. 1. The charge of explosive to be fired in tests 1, 2, and 3 shall   be equal in disruptive power to one-half pound (227 grams) of 40 per   cent. nitroglycerin dynamite in its original wrapper, of the following   formula:      Nitroglycerin      40     Nitrate of sodium  44     Wood pulp          15     Calcium carbonate   1                       ---                       100    “Each charge shall be fired with an electric fuse of sufficient power   to completely detonate or explode the charge, as recommended by the   manufacturer. The explosive must be in such condition that the   chemical and physical tests do not show any unfavorable results. The   explosives in which the charge used is less than 100 grams (0.22   pound) will be weighed in tinfoil without the original wrapper.    “The dust used in tests 2, 3, and 4 will be of the same degree of   fineness and taken from one mine.[6]      [Footnote 6: With a view to obtaining a dust of uniform purity and     inflammability.]    “TEST 1.--Ten shots with the charge as described above, in its   original wrapper, shall be fired, each with 1 pound of clay tamping,   at a gallery temperature of 77° F., into a mixture of gas and air   containing 8 per cent. of methane and ethane. An explosive will pass   this test if all ten shots fail to ignite the mixture.    “TEST 2.--Ten shots with charge as previously noted, in its original   wrapper, shall be fired, each with 1 pound of clay tamping at a   gallery temperature of 77° F., into a mixture of gas and air   containing 4 per cent. of methane and ethane and 20 pounds of   bituminous coal dust, 18 pounds of which is to be placed on shelves   laterally arranged along the first 20 feet of the gallery, and 2   pounds to be placed near the inlet of the mixing system in such a   manner that all or part of it will be suspended in the first division   of the gallery. An explosive will pass this test if all ten shots fail   to ignite the mixture.    “TEST 3.--Ten shots with charge as previously noted, in its original   wrapper, shall be fired, each with 1 pound of clay tamping at a   gallery temperature of 77° F., into 40 pounds of bituminous coal dust,   20 pounds of which is to be distributed uniformly on a horse placed in   front of the cannon and 20 pounds placed on side shelves in sections   4, 5, and 6. An explosive will pass this test if all ten shots fail to   ignite the mixture.    “TEST 4.--A limit charge will be determined within 25 grams by firing   charges in their original wrappers, untamped, at a gallery temperature   of 77° F., into a mixture of gas and air containing 4 per cent. of   methane and ethane and 20 pounds of bituminous coal dust, to be   arranged in the same manner as in test 2. This limit charge is to be   repeated five times under the same conditions before being   established.    “NOTE.--At least 2 pounds of clay tamping will be used with   slow-burning explosives.    “Washington, D.C., _January 9, 1909_.    “In response to the above communication applications were received   from 12 manufacturers for the testing of 29 explosives. Of these   explosives, the 17 given in the following list have passed all the   test requirements set forth, and will be termed permissible   explosives.    “_Permissible explosives tested prior to May 15, 1909._    ----------------------------+----------------------------------------   Brand.                      |           Manufacturer.   ----------------------------+----------------------------------------   Ætna coal powder A          | Ætna Powder Co., Chicago, Ill.

That the explosive is in all respects similar to the sample   submitted by the manufacturer for test.    “2. That double-strength detonators are used of not less strength than   1 gram charge consisting by weight of 90 parts of mercury fulminate   and 10 parts of potassium chlorate (or its equivalent), except for the   explosive ‘Masurite M. L. F.’ for which the detonator shall be of not   less strength than 1½ grams charge.    “3. That the explosive, if in a frozen condition, shall be thoroughly   thawed in a safe and suitable manner before use.    “4. That the amount used in practice does not exceed 1½ pounds (680   grams) properly tamped.    “The above partial list includes the permissible explosives that have   passed these tests prior to May 15, 1909. The announcement of the   passing of like tests by other explosives will be made public   immediately after the completion of the tests for such explosives.    “A description of the method followed in making these and the many   additional tests to which each explosive is subjected, together with   the full data obtained in each case, will be published by the Survey   at an early date.    “NOTES AND SUGGESTIONS.    “It may be wise to point out in this connection certain differences   between the permissible explosives as a class and the black powders   now so generally used in coal mining, as follows:    “(_a_) With equal quantities of each, the flame of the black powder is   more than three times as long and has a duration three thousand to   more than four thousand times that of one of the permissible   explosives, also the rate of explosion is slower.    “(_b_) The permissible explosives are one and one-fourth to one and   three-fourths times as strong and are said, if properly used, to do   twice the work of black powder in bringing down coal; hence only half   the quantity need be used.    “(_c_) With 1 pound of a permissible explosive or 2 pounds of black   powder, the quantity of noxious gases given off from a shot averages   approximately the same, the quantity from the black powder being less   than from some of the permissible explosives and slightly greater than   from others. The time elapsing after firing before the miner returns   to the working face or fires another shot should not be less for   permissible explosives than for black powder.    “The use of permissible explosives should be considered as   supplemental to and not as a substitute for other safety precautions   in mines where gas or inflammable coal dust is present under   conditions indicative of danger. As stated above, they should be used   with strong detonators; and the charge used in practice should not   exceed 1½ pounds, and in many cases need not exceed 1 pound.    “Inasmuch as no explosive manufactured for use in mining is flameless,   and as no such explosive is entirely safe under all the variable   mining conditions, the use of the terms ‘flameless’ and ‘safety’ as   applied to explosives is likely to be misunderstood, may endanger   human life, and should be discouraged.    “JOSEPH A. HOLMES,   “_Expert in Charge Technologic Branch_.    “Approved, May 18, 1909:   “GEO. OTIS SMITH,   “_Director_.”  In the meantime, many of the explosives submitted, which heretofore had been on the market as safety explosives, were found to be unsafe for use in gaseous or dusty mines, and the manufacturers were permitted to withdraw them. Their weaknesses being known, as a result of these tests, the manufacturers were enabled to produce similar, but safer, explosives. Consequently, applications for further tests continued to pour in, as they still do, and on October 1st, 1909, a second list of permissible explosives was issued, as follows:    “EXPLOSIVES CIRCULAR NO. 2.   “DEP"]]]
