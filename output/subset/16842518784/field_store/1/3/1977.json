I'll have to tell you some time, you and the rest of my scholars, for of course you are coming to my school.\"  \"Oh, am I?\" Marian's face was radiant.  \"Why, yes, I imagine so. Don't you go to school?\"  \"I haven't been yet. Grandpa has always taught me at home, you know.\"  \"Oh, that's it.\" Miss Dorothy was taking off her hat, standing before the mirror to puff out her soft ripples of hair. \"What a lovely big room this is,\" she remarked. \"I never had such a big room all to myself. We are such a large family that we always have to double up, I don't mean like a jack-knife,\" she added with a little laugh. \"I wonder if I shall have to hunt for myself in that big bed; if I do you will have to come and find me, for I might get hopelessly lost if you didn't.\"  Marian laughed. This merry talk was very delightful; even Mrs. Hunt was never quite so fascinatingly entertaining. She stood gazing at Miss Dorothy with admiring eyes as she put a few touches to her dress. Surely it would mean great things to have a young lady in the house.  Miss Dorothy gave a final survey of the room as she turned from the mirror. \"I like it,\" she said nodding to Marian, \"and when I get down those solemn-looking pictures, hang up my own favorites, put a cheerful cover on that table and a couple of bright sofa pillows on that lounge, and have some plants in that south window, it will be very cozy.\"  \"Oh, will you dare?\" began Marian and then stopped short. There were probably no lengths to which a teacher might not be allowed to go, even by so particular a person as Grandma Otway.  \"Why, what is there so very daring about that?\" asked Miss Dorothy. \"It isn't like walking a tight-rope, or shooting Niagara Falls in a canoe.\" There was a saucy look in her eyes as she spoke, and a dimple came and went as she strove to keep her face grave.  \"It isn't like that, of course,\" said Marian feebly. \"It will be your own room, and you are a grown-up lady who can do as you please. I suppose it is only children who don't dare to do things like moving pictures and putting flower-pots on the window-sills when they are freshly painted.\"  Miss Dorothy's merry laugh rang out. \"Oh, you dear, transparent baby. You've spoken volumes in that speech. Now I'm ready to go down. What shall we do? My trunk will not be here till after the next train is in, they informed me at the station. I'd like to see the schoolhouse, but perhaps we'd best wait till morning, then it can be shown me officially. Could we dare to walk in the garden if I promise not to race over the borders and recklessly pull the flowers? Does one dare to leave the house to do that?\" There was a little mocking look in her eyes as she spoke.  \"Oh, yes, of course we can go anywhere we like in the garden,\" returned Marian. \"Do come, and I will show you my apple tree. If you are not afraid to climb you can see the ocean from my seat in the crotch,--and the mountain, too,\" she added more soberly.  \"Don't suggest mountains yet,\" said Miss Dorothy, becoming sober too. \"But there, I won't think about mountains; I've always managed them and I always intend to.\"  Marian gazed at her with new intentness and drew nearer. \"Can you manage mountains?\" she asked wonderingly.  \"Why, yes; if you don't make them out of mole-hills it is easy enough.\"  Marian pondered over this answer all the way down-stairs, but could not make head or tail of it. She would ask further when she knew Miss Dorothy better. She felt quite assured that she would not be long in feeling as much at home with her as with Mrs. Hunt.  As they passed the kitchen door near which the grim Hepzibah stood, Miss Dorothy drew her skirts aside and fled down the garden walk, giving a pretended scared look over her shoulder as she caught Marian's hand. \"Don't let her get me, will you?\" she said. Marian fell in with her mood and promised that she should not be delivered to the ogress, though in her heart of hearts she felt that a person who would dare to take liberties with Grandma Otway's best room surely could not be a very scary individual, and by the time they had reached the apple tree, she had decided that Miss Dorothy would probably have no fear of climbing to the very top, if she cared to.  \"The Garden of Hesperides and the Golden Apples!\" exclaimed Miss Dorothy, settling down into the crotch and giving Marian a hand to help her to a seat by her side. \"Isn't this too lovely for anything? It will be the finest place in the world to come and read fairy-tales. Do you know many? I have brought a lot with me, and we'll have a lovely time here before it gets too cold to stay out.\"  \"I don't know many fairy-tales,\" Marian answered doubtfully. \"Grandma doesn't exactly approve of them; at least she never tells me any. She says that Bible stories are entertaining enough for any one, and she lets me read those 'simplified for the understanding of a child.'\" She spoke with perfect gravity, though Miss Dorothy turned her head to hide the smile she could not prevent.  \"I suppose, then,\" said Miss Dorothy, \"that you have a book of those.\"  \"Yes; it belonged to grandpa when he was small, and it is called 'Tales from the Bible, simplified for the understanding of a child'; I read it generally on Sundays. Mrs. Hunt knows about Cinderella and the Glass Slipper and about the Pig that huffed and puffed till he blew the house down.\"  \"Oh, I don't know that last one,\" said Miss Dorothy; \"you will have to tell me, and I'll tell you about the Golden Apples. Don't the apples smell good? Do we dare have any of them when they are ripe?\"  \"Oh, yes, we can have two a day; one in the morning and one at noon; grandma says they are lead at night.\"  \"Goodness me! I believe I have heard that saying before,\" said Miss Dorothy, mentally determining to carry apples to her room to eat when she felt inclined. Mrs. Otway should not decide such matters for her. She sat with her chin in her hand looking off at the ocean, blue in the distance. Marian, watching her, decided that although the new teacher did not exactly fill her expectations in some respects, in others she far exceeded them. She had very blue eyes that could be merry or soft as her mood was, her hair was wavy and of a light brown color; she was fair of skin, had rather a large mouth and not a specially beautiful nose, but she was good to look upon and the more one looked the more charming one thought her. She was dressed very simply in a gray traveling gown with no jewelry but a silver pin fastening her collar. Her face in repose was serious and Marian could see that she was not one to be trifled with, in spite of her fun-loving spirit.  \"There are many things I want to know,\" said Miss Dorothy after a while, \"but I will wait till I absolutely have to ask questions.\"  \"If you want to know one thing,\" returned Marian, \"I can tell you. If you would like me to tell you when grandpa and grandma will be here I can say in about five minutes.\" She was looking off down the street and Miss Dorothy saw two figures approaching.  \"Then we'd better go in,\" she said. \"I should not like them to meet me in an apple tree; they might think me very undignified.\"  Marian was rather inclined to think they might, but she glossed over the fact by saying, \"Well, you see it has been such a long, long time since they were young they must forget how it feels.\"  Miss Dorothy smiled and began to climb down the ladder, Marian following. In a few minutes they were walking soberly up the path and reached the front door just as Mr. and Mrs. Otway were there.  \"Miss Robbins has come,\" announced Marian with a little nod of her head in the direction of the young lady in the background.  \"Ah-h,\" responded her grandfather, \"then I was right, my dear,\" he turned to his wife, \"I said it was probable that she would get the first train. We should have told Hepzibah or else you should have remained at home.\"  \"I never remain at home from the quarterly meeting upon any pretext,\" returned Mrs. Otway firmly; \"it was a most important one.\"  But Mr. Otway had hastened forward and was holding out his hand in welcome to Miss Dorothy. \"I am glad to receive my old friend's daughter,\" he said with a stately bow. \"This is Miss--ah, yes, Miss Dorothy. I may have met you when you were less of a young lady, but I cannot separate you, as a memory, from your sisters.\"  \"I think I remember Professor Otway,\" returned Dorothy smiling up into the near-sighted eyes which were peering down at her. Mr. Otway was tall, spare, a little stoop-shouldered. His hair was quite gray and grew sparsely around his temples; his face was clean shaven. Mrs. Otway was below medium height, plump and keen-eyed. She wore an old-fashioned gown and a plain bonnet. Winter or summer she never went out without a small cape over her shoulders. Upon this occasion it was of black silk trimmed with a fold of the same. She looked approvingly at Dorothy's neat frock, but a little disapprovingly at the arrangement of her hair.  \"I am sorry not to have been here to welcome you,\" she said, \"but there are certain matters of business which cannot be set aside for uncertainties. I hope Hepzibah or Marian showed you to your room.\"  \"Marian did, and has been a very kind hostess,\" returned Miss Dorothy. \"I am very glad you did not give up an important matter for anything so indefinite as my arrival. You must never let my presence allow of any change in your arrangements, Mrs. Otway. I am exceedingly grateful to you for taking me in, and I should be very uncomfortable if I were to interfere with your usual routine.\"  Mrs. Otway nodded approval. \"We shall consider you one of the family, my dear Miss Robbins,\" she told her. \"Marian, take my things up-stairs.\" She gave her bonnet and cape to her granddaughter and led the way to the semi-darkened parlor where she established"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19998"],["title","Rural Architecture (#1)"],["body","                                   303   Floor Plan,                                                 304 BARN ATTACHMENTS,                                             308 RABBITS,                                                      311     Mr. Rotch's Description of his Rabbits,                   313     Rabbits and Hutch,                                        315     Dutch, and English Rabbits,                               318     Mode of Feeding,                                          319   Mr. Rodman's Rabbitry, Elevation, and Floor Plan,           322   Explanations,                                               323   Loft or Garret, Explanation,                                324   Cellar plan, Explanation,                                   325   Front and Back of Hutches, and Explanation,                 326 DAIRY BUILDINGS,                                              330   Cheese Dairy House,                                         330   Elevation of Dairy House and Ground Plan,                   331   Interior Arrangement,                                       333   The Butter Dairy,                                           335 THE WATER RAM,                                                237   Figure and Description,                                     338 GRANARY--Rat-proof,                                           343 IMPROVED DOMESTIC ANIMALS,                                    345   Short Horn Bull,                                            349   Short Horn Cow,                                             352   Devon Cow and Bull,                                         355   Southdown Ram and Ewe,                                      359   Long-wooled Ram and Ewe,                                    362   Common Sheep,                                               364     Remarks,                                                  365 WATERFOWLS,                                                   370     The African Goose,                                        370   China Goose,                                                371     Bremen Goose,                                             372 A WORD ABOUT DOGS,                                            374   Smooth Terrier,                                             377   Shepherd Dog,                                               381     PREFATORY.   This work owes its appearance to the absence of any cheap and popular book on the subject of Rural Architecture, exclusively intended for the farming or agricultural interest of the United States. Why it is, that nothing of the kind has been heretofore attempted for the chief benefit of so large and important a class of our community as our farmers comprise, is not easy to say, unless it be that they themselves have indicated but little wish for instruction in a branch of domestic economy which is, in reality, one of great importance, not only to their domestic enjoyment, but their pecuniary welfare. It is, too, perhaps, among the category of neglects, and in the lack of fidelity to their own interests which pervades the agricultural community of this country, beyond those of any other profession--for we insist that agriculture, in its true and extended sense, is as much a profession as any other pursuit whatever. To the reality of such neglects they have but of late awaked, and indeed are now far too slowly wheeling into line for more active progress in the knowledge pertaining to their own advancement. As an accessory to their labors in such advancement, the present work is intended.  It is an opinion far too prevalent among those engaged in the more active occupations of our people,--fortified indeed in such opinion, by the too frequent example of the farmer himself--that everything connected with agriculture and agricultural life is of a rustic and uncouth character; that it is a profession in which ignorance, as they understand the term, is entirely consistent, and one with which no aspirations of a high or an elevated character should, or at least need be connected. It is a reflection upon the integrity of the great agricultural interest of the country, that any such opinion should prevail; and discreditable to that interest, that its condition or example should for a moment justify, or even tolerate it.  Without going into any extended course of remark, we shall find ample reason for the indifference which has prevailed among our rural population, on the subject of their own domestic architecture, in the absence of familiar and practical works on the subject, by such as have given any considerable degree of thought to it; and, what little thought has been devoted to this branch of building, has been incidentally rather than directly thrown off by those professionally engaged in the finer architectural studies appertaining to luxury and taste, instead of the every-day wants of a strictly agricultural population, and, of consequence, understanding but imperfectly the wants and conveniences of the farm house in its connection with the every-day labors and necessities of farm life.  It is not intended, in these remarks, to depreciate the efforts of those who have attempted to instruct our farmers in this interesting branch of agricultural economy. We owe them a debt of gratitude for what they have accomplished in the introduction of their designs to our notice; and when it is remarked that they are insufficient for the purposes intended, it may be also taken as an admission of our own neglect, that we have so far disregarded the subject ourselves, as to force upon others the duty of essaying to instruct us in a work of which we ourselves should long ago have been the masters.  Why should a farmer, because he _is_ a farmer, only occupy an uncouth, outlandish house, any more than a professional man, a merchant, or a mechanic? Is it because he himself is so uncouth and outlandish in his thoughts and manners, that he deserves no better? Is it because his occupation is degrading, his intellect ignorant, his position in life low, and his associations debasing? Surely not. Yet, in many of the plans and designs got up for his accommodation, in the books and publications of the day, all due convenience, to say nothing of the respectability or the elegance of domestic life, is as entirely disregarded as if such qualities had no connection with the farmer or his occupation. We hold, that although many of the practical operations of the farm may be rough, laborious, and untidy, yet they are not, and need not be inconsistent with the knowledge and practice of neatness, order, and even elegance and refinement within doors; and, that the due accommodation of the various things appertaining to farm stock, farm labor, and farm life, should have a tendency to elevate the social position, the associations, thoughts, and entire condition of the farmer. As the man himself--no matter what his occupation--be lodged and fed, so influenced, in a degree, will be his practice in the daily duties of his life. A squalid, miserable tenement, with which they who inhabit it are content, can lead to no elevation of character, no improvement in condition, either social or moral, of its occupants. But, the family comfortably and tidily, although humbly provided in their habitation and domestic arrangements, have usually a corresponding character in their personal relations. A log cabin, even,--and I speak of this primitive American structure with profound affection and regard, as the shelter from which we have achieved the most of our prodigious and rapid agricultural conquests,--may be so constructed as to speak an air of neatness, intelligence, and even refinement in those who inhabit it.  Admitting, then, without further argument, that well conditioned household accommodations are as important to the farmer, even to the indulgence of luxury itself, when it can be afforded, as for those who occupy other and more active pursuits, it is quite important that he be equally well instructed in the art of planning and arranging these accommodations, and in designing, also, the various other structures which are necessary to his wants in their fullest extent. As a question of economy, both in saving and accumulating, good and sufficient buildings are of the first consequence, in a pecuniary light, and when to this are added other considerations touching our social enjoyment, our advancement in temporal condition, our associations, our position and influence in life, and, not least, the decided item of national good taste which the introduction of good buildings throughout our extended agricultural country will give, we find abundant cause for effort in improvement.  It is not intended in our remarks to convey the impression that we Americans, as a people, are destitute of comfortable, and, in many cases, quite convenient household and farm arrangements. Numerous farmeries in every section of the United States, particularly in the older ones, demonstrate most fully, that where our farmers have taken the trouble to _think_ on the subject, their ingenuity has been equal, in the items of convenient and economical arrangement of their dwellings and out-buildings, to their demands. But, we are forced to say, that such buildings have been executed, in most cases, with great neglect of _architectural_ system, taste, or effect; and, in many instances, to the utter violation of all _propriety_ in appearance, or character, as appertaining to the uses for which they are applied.  The character of the farm should be carried out so as to _express_ itself in everything which it contains. All should bear a consistent relation with each other. The former himself is a plain man. His family are plain people, although none the less worthy, useful, or exalted, on that account. His structures, of every kind, should be plain, also, yet substantial, where substance is required. All these detract nothing from his respectability or his influence in"]]]
