From the calends of October to the beginning of Lent let them     apply themselves to reading until the second hour.... During     Lent, let them apply themselves to reading from morning until     the end of the third hour ... and, in these days of Lent, let     them receive a book apiece from the library, and read it     straight through. These books are to be given out at the     beginning of Lent. It is important that one or two seniors     should be appointed to go round the monastery at the hours     when brethren are engaged in reading, in case some     ill-conditioned brother should be giving himself up to sloth     or idle talk, instead of reading steadily; so that not only is     he useless to himself, but incites others to do wrong.  \"Behold! how great a matter a little fire kindleth!\" These simple words, uttered by one who in power of far-reaching influence has had no equal, gave an impulse to study in the ages it once was the fashion to call dark which grew with the growth of the Order--till wherever a Benedictine house arose--or a monastery of any one of the Orders which were but off-shoots from the Benedictine tree--books were multiplied, and a library came into being, small indeed at first, but increasing year by year, till the wealthier houses had gathered together a collection of books that would do credit to a modern University.  It is very interesting to notice, as Order after Order was founded, a steady development of feeling with regard to books, and an ever increasing care for their safe-keeping. S. Benedict had contented himself with general directions for study; the Cluniacs prescribe the selection of a special officer to take charge of the books, with an annual audit of them, and the assignment of a single volume to each brother; the Carthusians and the Cistercians provide for the loan of books to extraneous persons under certain conditions--a provision which the Benedictines in their turn adopted. Further, by the time that the Cluniac Customs were drawn up in the form in which they have come down to us, it is evident that the number of books exceeded the number of brethren; for both in them, and in the statutes which Lanfranc promulgated for the use of the English Benedictines in 1070, the keeper of the books is directed to bring all the books of the House into Chapter, after which the brethren, one by one, are to bring in the books they had borrowed on the same day in the previous year. Some of the former class of books were probably service-books, but, after this deduction has been made, we may fairly conclude that by the end of the eleventh century Benedictine Houses possessed two sets of books: (1) those which were distributed among the brethren; (2) those which were kept in some safe place, probably the church, as part of the valuables of the House: or, to adopt modern phrases, they had a lending library and a library of reference. The Augustinians go a step farther than the Benedictines and the Orders derived from them, for they prescribe the kind of press in which the books are to be kept. Both they and the Premonstratensians permit their books to be lent on the receipt of a pledge of sufficient value. Lastly, the Friars, though they were established on the principle of holding no possessions of any kind, soon found that books were indispensable; that, in the words of a Norman Bishop, _Claustrum sine armario, castrum sine armamentario_. So, by a strange irony, it came to pass that their libraries excelled those of most other Orders, as Richard de Bury testifies in the _Philobiblon_.      Whenever we turned aside to the cities and places where the     Mendicants had their convents ... we found heaped up amidst     the utmost poverty the utmost riches of wisdom....      These men are as ants ever preparing their meat in the summer,     and ingenious bees continually fabricating cells of honey....     And to pay due regard to truth, although they lately at the     eleventh hour have entered the Lord's vineyard ..., they have     added more in this brief hour to the stock of the sacred books     than all the other vine-dressers; following in the footsteps     of Paul, the last to be called but the first in preaching, who     spread the gospel of Christ more widely than all others.  It might have been expected, from the use of the word _library_ in the Rule of S. Benedict, that a special room assigned to books would have been one of the primitive component parts of every Benedictine House. This, however, is not the case. Such a room does usually occur in these Houses, but it will be found, on examination, that it was added to some previously existing structure in the fourteenth or fifteenth century. Its absence from the primitive plan brings out two points very clearly: (1) how few books even a wealthy community could afford to possess for several centuries after the foundation of the Order; (2) how strictly the Order adhered to prescribed arrangements in laying out its Houses, for even those built, or rebuilt, after books had become plentiful, do not admit a Library as an indispensable item in their ground-plan.  How then did they bestow their books after they had become too numerous to be kept in the church? The answer to this question is a very curious one, when we consider what our climate is, and indeed what the climate of the whole of Europe is, during the winter months. The centre of the monastic life was the cloister. Brethren were not allowed to congregate in any other part of the conventual buildings, except when they went into the frater, or dining-hall, for their meals, or at certain hours in certain seasons into the warming-house (_calefactorium_). In the cloister accordingly they kept their books; and there they sat and studied, or conducted the schooling of the novices and choir-boys in winter and in summer alike.  Such a locality as this could not have been very favourable to the preservation of the books themselves. They, however, had a certain amount of protection which was denied to their readers, for they were shut up in presses. The word used for these, _armarium_, is the same as that which was applied by the Romans to their bookcases; and probably the idea of such a piece of furniture was due to a far-off echo of ancient usage. The official who had charge of the books did not derive his name from them, as in modern times, but from the presses which contained them--for he was uniformly styled _armarius_.  As time went on, greater comfort was introduced. The windows of the walk of the cloister where the presses stood, usually the walk next the Church, were glazed--and sometimes not merely with white glass, but with mottoes alluding to the authors whose works were near at hand; while in some monasteries the elder monks were provided with small wooden studies, called \"carrells.\" A description of the whole system has been preserved for us in that curious book _The Rites of Durham_; but it must be remembered that this represents the customs of the convent just before the suppression, and therefore gives no idea of the rigour of an earlier time.   _Part of the north walk of the cloister, Durham._       In the north syde of the Cloister, from the corner over     against the Church dour to the corner over againste the Dorter     dour, was all fynely glased from the hight to the sole within     a litle of the grownd into the Cloister garth. And in every     wyndowe iij Pewes or Carrells, where every one of the old     Monks had his carrell, severall by himselfe, that, when they     had dyned, they dyd resort to that place of Cloister, and     there studyed upon there books, every one in his carrell, all     the after nonne, unto evensong tyme. This was there exercise     every daie.      All there pewes or carrells was all fynely wainscotted and     verie close, all but the forepart, which had carved wourke     that gave light in at ther carrell doures of wainscott. And in     every carrell was a deske to lye there bookes on. And the     carrells was no greater then from one stanchell of the wyndowe     to another.      And over against the carrells against the church wall did     stande certaine great almeries [or cupbords] of waynscott all     full of bookes [with great store of ancient manuscripts to     help them in their study], wherein did lye as well the old     auncyent written Doctors of the Church as other prophane     authors with dyverse other holie mens wourks, so that every     one dyd studye what Doctor pleased them best, havinge the     Librarie at all tymes to goe studie in besydes there carrells.  No example of an English monastic book-press has survived, so far as I have been able to discover; but it would be rash to say that none exists. Meanwhile I will shew you a French example of a press, from the sacristy of the Cathedral at Bayeux, but I cannot be sure that it was originally intended to hold books. M. Viollet-Le-Duc, from whom I borrow it, decides that it was probably made early in the thirteenth century.   _Cupboard from sacristy of Bayeux Cathedral._   The Durham _Rites_ speak only of book-presses standing in the cloister against the walls; but it was not unusual to have recesses in the wall itself, fitted with shelves, and probably closed by a door. Two such are to be seen at Worcester, immediately to the north of the chapter-house door. Each is about ten feet wide by two feet deep.   _Book-recess, east walk of the cloister, Worcester._   A similar receptacle for books seems to have been contemplated in Augustinian Houses, for in the Customs of the Augustinian Priory of Barnwell, written towards the end of the thirteenth century, the following passage occurs:      The press in which the books are kept ought to be lined inside     with wood, that the damp of"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19415"],["title","Libraries in the Medieval and Renaissance Periods (#2)"],["body","walls may not moisten or stain     the books. This press should be divided vertically as well as     horizontally by sundry partitions, on which the books may be     ranged so as to be separated from one another; for fear they     be packed so close as to injure each other, or delay those who     want them.  Recesses such as these were developed in Cistercian houses into a small square room without a window, and but little larger than an ordinary cupboard. In the plans of Clairvaux and Kirkstall this room is placed between the chapter-house and the transept of the church; and similar rooms, in similar situations, have been found at Fountains, Beaulieu, Tintern, Netley, etc. The catalogue, made 1396, of the Cistercian Abbey at Meaux in Holderness, now totally destroyed, gives us a glimpse of the internal arrangement of one of these rooms. The books were placed on shelves against the walls, and even over the door. Again, the catalogue of the House of White Canons at Titchfield in Hampshire, dated 1400, shews that the books were kept in a small room, on shelves there called _columpnæ_, set against the walls. It is obvious that no study could have gone forward in such places as these; they must have been intended for security only, and to replace the wooden presses used elsewhere.  As time went on, the number of the books would naturally increase, and by the beginning of the fifteenth century the larger monasteries at least had accumulated many hundred volumes. For instance, at Christ Church, Canterbury, at the beginning of the 14th century, there were 698. These had to be bestowed in various parts of the House without order or selection,--in presses set up wherever a vacant corner could be found--to the great inconvenience, we may be sure, of the more studious monks, or of scholars who came to consult them. To remedy such a state of things a definite room was constructed for books--in addition to the presses in the cloister, which were still retained for the books in daily use. A few instances of this will suffice. At Christ Church, Canterbury, a library was built between 1414 and 1443 by Archbishop Chichele, over the Prior's Chapel; at Durham between 1416 and 1446 by Prior Wessyngton, over the old sacristy; at Citeaux in 1480, over the writing-room (_scriptorium_); at Clairvaux between 1495 and 1503, in the same position; at S. Victor in Paris--an Augustinian House--between 1501 and 1508; and at S. Germain des Prés in the same city about 1513, over the south cloister.  Most of us, I take it, have more or less imperfect ideas of the appearance of a great monastery in the days of its completeness; and information on this point is unfortunately much more defective for our own country than it is for France. In illustration, therefore, of what I have been saying about the position of monastic libraries, I will next shew you two bird's-eye views of the Benedictine House of S. Germain des Prés, Paris. The first, dated 1687, shews the library over the south walk of the cloister, where it was placed in 1513. It must not, however, be supposed that no library existed before this. On the contrary, the House seems to have had one from the first foundation, and so early as the thirteenth century it could be consulted by strangers, and books borrowed from it. The second view, dated 1723, shews a still further extension of the library. It has now invaded the west side of the cloister, which has received an upper storey, and even the external appearance of the venerable refectory, which was respected when nearly all the rest of the buildings were rebuilt in a classical style, has been sacrificed to a similar gallery. The united lengths of these three rooms must have been little short of 324 feet. This library was at the disposal of all scholars who desired to use it. When the Revolution came it contained more than 49,000 printed books, and 7000 manuscripts. The fittings belonged to the period of its latest extension: they appear to have been sumptuous, but for my present object, uninteresting.   _Views of S. Germain des Prés:_ (1) _from Franklin, \"Anciennes Bibliothèques de Paris,\"_ i. 126; (2) _from Bouillart, \"Histoire de l'Abbaye de S. Germain des Préz.\"_   At Canterbury the library, built as I have said, over the Prior's Chapel, was 60 feet long, by 22 feet broad; and we know, from some memoranda written in 1508, when a number of books were sent to be bound or repaired, that it contained sixteen bookcases, each of which had four shelves. I have calculated that this library could have contained about 2000 volumes.  I have shewn you a Benedictine House, and will next shew you a bird's-eye view of Citeaux, the parent house of the Cistercian Order, founded at the close of the eleventh century. The original was taken, so far as I can make out, about 1500, at any rate before the primitive buildings had been seriously altered. The library here occupied two positions--under the roof between the dormitory and the refectory (which must have been extremely inconvenient); and subsequently it was rebuilt in an isolated situation on the north side of the second cloister, over the writing-room (_scriptorium_). This was also the position of the new library at Clairvaux--the other great Cistercian House in France--the fame of which was equal to, if not greater than, that of Citeaux. Of this latter library we have two descriptions; the first written in 1517, the second in 1723.   _View of Citeaux: from Viollet-Le-Duc, \"Dictionnaire de l'Architecture,\"_ i. 271.   The former account, by the secretary of the Queen of Sicily, who visited Clairvaux 13 July 1517, is as follows:      On the same side of the cloister are fourteen studies, where     the monks write and study, and over the said studies is the     new library, to which one mounts by a broad and lofty spiral     staircase from the aforesaid cloister. This library is 189     feet long, by 17 feet wide. In it are 48 seats (_bancs_), and     in each seat 4 shelves (_poulpitres_) furnished with books on     all subjects, but chiefly theology; the greater number of the     said books are of vellum, and written by hand, richly storied     and illuminated. The building that contains the said library     is magnificent, built of stone, and excellently lighted on     both sides with fine large windows, well glazed, looking out     on the said cloister and the burial-ground of the brethren....     The said library is paved throughout with small tiles adorned     with various designs.  The description written in 1723, by the learned Benedictines to whom we owe the _Voyage Littéraire_, is equally interesting:      From the great cloister you proceed into the cloister of     conversation, so called because the brethren are allowed to     converse there. In this cloister there are 12 or 15 little     cells, all of a row, where the brethren formerly used to write     books; for this reason they are still called at the present     day the writing-rooms. Over these cells is the Library, the     building for which is large, vaulted, well lighted, and     stocked with a large number of manuscripts, fastened by chains     to desks; but there are not many printed books.  In the great cloister, on the side next the Chapter House, the same observer noted \"books chained on wooden desks, which brethren can come and read when they please.\" The library was for serious study, the cloister for daily reading, probably in the main devotional.  If my time were unlimited I could describe to you several other fifteenth century monastic libraries, but I feel that I must content myself with only one more--that of the Franciscan House in London, commonly called Christ's Hospital. The first stone of this library was laid by Sir Richard Whittington, 21 October, 1421, and by Christmas Day in the following year the roof was finished. Stow tells us that it was 129 feet long by 31 feet broad; and the Letters Patent of Henry the Eighth add that it had 28 desks, and 28 double settles of wainscot. The whole building--so well worth preservation--has been totally destroyed, but I am able to shew you a view of it.   _Library of Christ's Hospital: from Trollope's \"History of Christ's Hospital,\"_ p. 105.  This view is an excellent illustration of the point on which I have insisted, namely, that in the course of the fifteenth century the great religious Houses--no matter to what Order they belonged--found that their books had become too numerous for the localities primitively intended for them, and began to build special libraries--usually over some existing structure; or--in other words--established a library of reference, which was not unfrequently thrown open to scholars in general, who were allowed to borrow books from it, on execution of an indenture, or deposit of a sufficient pledge. \"It is safer to fall back on a pledge, than to proceed against an individual,\" said the Customs of the Priory at Abingdon.  In what way were these monastic libraries fitted up? No trace of any monastic fittings has survived, so far as I am aware, either in England, or in France, or in Italy; and even M. Viollet-Le-Duc dismisses \"The Library\" in a few brief sentences, of which the keynote is despair. My own view is that a close analogy may be traced between the fittings of monastic libraries and those of collegiate libraries; and that when we understand the one we shall understand the other.  The collegiate system was in no sense of the word monastic, indeed it was to a certain extent established to counteract monastic influence; but it is absurd to suppose that the younger communities would borrow nothing from the elder--especially when we reflect that the monastic system had completed at least seven centuries of successful existence before Walter de Merton was moved to found a college; that many of the subsequent founders of colleges were churchmen, if not actually monks; and that there were monastic colleges at both Universities.
