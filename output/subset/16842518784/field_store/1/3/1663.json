There she assumed an identity as the daughter of a planter, and took the name of Dallona of Hadron. Parenthetically, all Akor-Neb family-names are prepositional; family-names were originally place names. I believe that ancient Akor-Neb marital relations were too complicated to permit exact establishment of paternity. And all Akor-Neb men’s personal names have -_irz_- or -_arn_- inserted in the middle, and women’s names end in -_itra_- or -_ona_. You could call yourself Virzal of Verkan, for instance.  “Anyhow, she made the Second Level Venus-Terra trip on a regular passenger liner, and landed at the Akor-Neb city of Ghamma, on the upper Nile. There she established contact with the Outtime Trading Corporation representative, Zortan Brend, locally known as Brarnend of Zorda. He couldn’t call himself Brarnend of Zortan—in the Akor-Neb language, _zortan_ is a particularly nasty dirty-word. Hadron Dalla spent a few weeks at his residence, briefing herself on local conditions. Then she went to the capital city, Darsh, in eastern Europe, and enrolled as a student at something called the Independent Institute for Reincarnation Research, having secured a letter of introduction to its director, a Dr. Harnosh of Hosh.  “Almost at once, she began sending in reports to her home organization, the Rhogom Memorial Foundation of Psychic Science, here at Dhergabar, through Zortan Brend. The people there were wildly enthusiastic. I don’t have more than the average intelligent—I hope—layman’s knowledge of psychics, but Dr. Volzar Darv, the director of Rhogom Foundation, tells me that even in the present incomplete form, her reports have opened whole new horizons in the science. It seems that these Akor-Neb people have actually demonstrated, as a scientific fact, that the human individuality reincarnates after physical death—that your personality, and mine, have existed, as such, for ages, and will exist for ages to come. More, they have means of recovering, from almost anybody, memories of past reincarnations.  [Illustration: ]  “Well, after about a month, the people at this Reincarnation Institute realized that this Dallona of Hadron wasn’t any ordinary student. She probably had trouble keeping down to the local level of psychic knowledge. So, as soon as she’d learned their techniques, she was allowed to undertake experimental work of her own. I imagine she let herself out on that; as soon as she’d mastered the standard Akor-Neb methods of recovering memories of past reincarnations, she began refining and developing them more than the local yokels had been able to do in the past thousand years. I can’t tell you just what she did, because I don’t know the subject, but she must have lit things up properly. She got quite a lot of local publicity; not only scientific journals, but general newscasts.  “Then, four days ago, she disappeared, and her disappearance seems to have been coincident with an unsuccessful attempt on her life. We don’t know as much about this as we should; all we have is Zortan Brend’s account.  “It seems that on the evening of her disappearance, she had been attending the voluntary discarnation feast—suicide party—of a prominent nobleman named Garnon of Roxor. Evidently when the Akor-Neb people get tired of their current reincarnation they invite in their friends, throw a big party, and then do themselves in in an atmosphere of general conviviality. Frequently they take poison or inhale lethal gas; this fellow had his personal trigger man shoot him through the head. Dalla was one of the guests of honor, along with this Harnosh of Hosh. They’d made rather elaborate preparations, and after the shooting they got a detailed and apparently authentic spirit-communication from the late Garnon. The voluntary discarnation was just a routine social event, it seems, but the communication caused quite an uproar, and rated top place on the System-wide newscasts, and started a storm of controversy.  “After the shooting and the communication, Dalla took the officiating gun artist, one Dirzed, into her own service. This Dirzed was spoken of as a generally respected member of something called the Society of Assassins, and that’ll give you an idea of what things are like on that sector, and why I don’t want to send anybody who might develop trigger-finger cramp at the wrong moment. She and Dirzed left the home of the gentleman who had just had himself discarnated, presumably for Dalla’s apartment, about a hundred miles away. That’s the last that’s been heard of either of them.  “This attempt on Dalla’s life occurred while the pre-mortem revels were still going on. She lived in a six-room apartment, with three servants, on one of the upper floors of a three-thousand-foot tower—Akor-Neb cities are built vertically, with considerable interval between units—and while she was at this feast, a package was delivered at the apartment, ostensibly from the Reincarnation Institute and made up to look as though it contained record tapes. One of the servants accepted it from a service employee of the apartments. The next morning, a little before noon, Dr. Harnosh of Hosh called her on the visiphone and got no answer; he then called the apartment manager, who entered the apartment. He found all three of the servants dead, from a lethal-gas bomb which had exploded when one of them had opened this package. However, Hadron Dalla had never returned to the apartment, the night before.”         *       *       *       *       *  Verkan Vall was sitting motionless, his face expressionless as he ran Tortha Karf’s narrative through the intricate semantic and psychological processes of the First Level mentality. The fact that Hadron Dalla had been a former wife of his had been relegated to one corner of his consciousness and contained there; it was not a fact that would, at the moment, contribute to the problem or to his treatment of it.  “The package was delivered while she was at this suicide party,” he considered. “It must, therefore, have been sent by somebody who either did not know she would be out of the apartment, or who did not expect it to function until after her return. On the other hand, if her disappearance was due to hostile action, it was the work of somebody who knew she was at the feast and did not want her to reach her apartment again. This would seem to exclude the sender of the package bomb.”  Tortha Karf nodded. He had reached that conclusion, himself.  “Thus,” Verkan Vall continued, “if her disappearance was the work of an enemy, she must have two enemies, each working in ignorance of the other’s plans.”  “What do you think she did to provoke such enmity?”  “Well, of course, it just might be that Dalla’s normally complicated love-life had got a little more complicated than usual and short-circuited on her,” Verkan Vall said, out of the fullness of personal knowledge, “but I doubt that, at the moment. I would think that this affair has political implications.”  “So?” Tortha Karf had not thought of politics as an explanation. He waited for Verkan Vall to elaborate.  “Don’t you see, chief?” the special assistant asked. “We find a belief in reincarnation on many time-lines, as a religious doctrine, but these people accept it as a scientific fact. Such acceptance would carry much more conviction; it would influence a people’s entire thinking. We see it reflected in their disregard for death—suicide as a social function, this Society of Assassins, and the like. It would naturally color their political thinking, because politics is nothing but common action to secure more favorable living conditions, and to these people, the term ‘living conditions’ includes not only the present life, but also an indefinite number of future lives as well. I find this title, ‘Independent’ Institute, suggestive. Independent of what? Possibly of partisan affiliation.”  “But wouldn’t these people be grateful to her for her new discoveries, which would enable them to plan their future reincarnations more intelligently?” Tortha Karf asked.  “Oh, chief!” Verkan Vall reproached. “You know better than that! How many times have our people got in trouble on other time-lines because they divulged some useful scientific fact that conflicted with the locally revered nonsense? You show me ten men who cherish some religious doctrine or political ideology, and I’ll show you nine men whose minds are utterly impervious to any factual evidence which contradicts their beliefs, and who regard the producer of such evidence as a criminal who ought to be suppressed. For instance, on the Fourth Level Europo-American Sector, where I was just working, there is a political sect, the Communists, who, in the territory under their control, forbid the teaching of certain well-established facts of genetics and heredity, because those facts do not fit the world-picture demanded by their political doctrines. And on the same sector, a religious sect recently tried, in some sections successfully, to outlaw the teaching of evolution by natural selection.”  Tortha Karf nodded. “I remember some stories my grandfather told me, about his narrow escapes from an organization called the Holy Inquisition, when he was a paratime trader on the Fourth Level, about four hundred years ago. I believe that thing’s still operating, on the Europo-American Sector, under the name of the NKVD. So you think Dalla may have proven something that conflicted with local reincarnation theories, and somebody who had a vested interest in maintaining those theories is trying to stop her?”  “You spoke of a controversy over the communication alleged to have originated with this voluntarily discarnated nobleman. That would suggest a difference of opinion on the manner of nature of reincarnation or the discarnate state. This difference may mark the dividing line between the different political parties. Now, to get to this Darsh place, do I have to go to Venus, as Dalla did?”  “No. The"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18803"],["title","Fighting for the Right (#1)"],["body","Bronx.\"  \"But I shall escape the responsibility of the command, and avoid being pointed at as one who commands by official influence,\" said Christy, rather warmly; for he felt that he had done his duty with the utmost fidelity, and it was not pleasant to have his hard-earned honors discounted by flings at his father's influence with the government.  \"It is impossible to escape the sneers of the discontented, and there are always plenty of such in the navy and the army. But, Christy, you wrong yourself in taking any notice of such flings, for they have never been thrown directly at you, if at all. You are over-sensitive, and you have not correctly interpreted what your superiors have said to you,\" said Captain Passford seriously.  His father recalled some of the conversations between the young officer and Captain Blowitt and others, reported to him before. He insisted that the remarks of his superiors were highly complimentary to him, and that he had no right to take offence at them.  \"I dare say I am entirely wrong, father; but it will do me no harm to serve in a subordinate capacity,\" added Christy.  \"I agree with you here; but I must tell you again, as I have half a dozen times before, that I never asked a position or promotion for you at the Navy Department. You have won your honors and your advancement yourself,\" continued the father.  \"Well, it was all the same, father; you have used your time and your money very freely in the service of the government, as you could not help doing. I know that I did my duty, and the department promoted me because I was your son,\" said Christy, laughing.  \"Not at all, my son; you deserved your promotion every time, and if you had been the son of a wood-chopper in the State of Maine, you would have been promoted just the same,\" argued Captain Passford.  \"Perhaps I should,\" answered the young officer rather doubtfully.  \"After what you did in your last cruise with the Bronx, a larger and finer vessel would have been given to you in recognition of the brilliant service you had rendered,\" added the father. \"I prevented this from being done simply because you wished to take the position of second lieutenant on board of the Bellevite.\"  \"Then I thank you for it, father,\" replied Christy heartily.  \"But the department thinks it has lost an able commander,\" continued the captain with a smile.  \"I am willing to let the department think so, father. All I really ask of the officials now is to send me back to the Gulf, and to the Bellevite. I believe you said that I was to go as a passenger in the Chateaugay.\"  \"I did; and she has been ready for over a week.\"  \"Why don't she go, then?\" asked Christy impatiently.  \"On her way to the Gulf she is to engage in some special service,\" replied Captain Passford, as he took some letters from his pocket.  \"Letters!\" exclaimed the young lieutenant, laughing as he recalled some such missives on two former occasions. \"Do you still keep your three agents in the island of Great Britain?\"  \"I don't keep them, for they are now in the employ of the government, though they still report to me, and we use the system adopted some two years ago.\"  \"What is it this time, father?\" asked Christy, his curiosity as well as his patriotism excited by this time at the prospect of capturing a Confederate man-of-war, or even a blockade-runner.  \"There are traitors in and about the city of New York,\" answered Captain Passford, as he returned the letters to his pocket. \"We had a rebel in the house here at one time, you remember, and it is not quite prudent just now to explain the contents of the letters.\"  \"All right, father; but I suppose you will read them to me before I sail for the South.\"  \"I will talk to you about it another time,\" added the captain, as a knock was heard at the door. \"Come in!\"  It was the man-servant of the house, and he brought in a tray on which there was a card, which Captain Passford took.  \"Captain Wilford Chantor,\" the captain read from the card. \"Show him in, Gates. Lieutenant Chantor is appointed to the command of the Chateaugay, Christy, in which you take passage to the Gulf; but she will not go there directly.\"  \"Captain Chantor,\" said Gates, as he opened the door for the visitor.  \"I am happy to see you, Captain Chantor, though I have not had the pleasure of meeting you before,\" said the captain, as he rose from his chair, and bowed to the gentleman, who was in the uniform of a lieutenant.  \"I presume I have the honor to address Captain Horatio Passford,\" said the visitor, as he took a letter from his pocket, bowing very respectfully at the same time, and delivering the letter.  \"I am very glad to meet you, Captain Chantor,\" continued Captain Passford, taking the hand of the visitor. \"Allow me to introduce to you my son, Lieutenant Passford, who will be a passenger on your ship to the Gulf.\"  \"I am very happy to make your acquaintance, Mr. Passford, for I need hardly say that I have heard a great deal about you before, and this is a very unexpected pleasure,\" replied Captain Chantor.  \"Thank you, Captain, and I am equally happy to meet you, as I am to be a passenger on your ship,\" added Christy, as they shook hands very cordially.  \"I had three other passengers on board, but they have been transferred to the store-ship, which sails to-day, and you will be my only passenger.\"  \"At my suggestion,\" said Captain Passford smiling, doubtless at the puzzled expression of the captain of the Chateaugay at his statement.  \"I am to attend to some special service on my voyage to the Gulf, and I am ordered to take my instructions from you,\" added Captain Chantor.  \"Precisely so; but I hold no official position, and your orders will be put in proper form before you sail,\" replied Christy's father. \"Now, if you will be patient for a little while, I will explain the nature of the special service.\"  \"I shall be very glad to understand the subject, and I am confident my patience will hold out to any extent you may require.\"  The conversation so far had taken place in the library. The owner of Bonnydale rose from his arm-chair, opened the door into the hall, and looked about him very cautiously. Then he closed a window which the unusual warmth of an April day had rendered it necessary to open. He conducted his companions to the part of the room farthest from the door, and seated them on a sofa, while he placed his arm-chair in front of them. Even Christy thought his father was taking extraordinary precautions, and the visitor could make nothing of it.  \"As I have had occasion to remark before to-day, there are traitors in and about New York,\" the captain began.  \"If you have any private business with Captain Chantor, father, I am perfectly willing to retire,\" suggested Christy.  \"No; I wish you to understand this special service, for you may be called upon to take a hand in it,\" replied Captain Passford; and the son seated himself again. \"There are traitors in and about New York, I repeat. I think we need not greatly wonder that some of the English people persist in attempting to run the blockade at the South, when some of our own citizens are indirectly concerned in the same occupation.\"  This seemed to the captain of the Chateaugay an astounding statement, and not less so to Christy, and neither of them could make anything of it; but they were silent, concluding that the special service related to this matter.  \"In what I am about to say to you, Captain Chantor, I understand that I am talking to an officer of the utmost discretion,\" continued Captain Passford, \"and not a word of it must be repeated to any person on board of the Chateaugay, and certainly not to any other person whatever.\"  \"I understand you perfectly, sir,\" replied the officer. \"My lips shall be sealed to all.\"  \"I wish to say that the command of the Chateaugay would have been offered to my son, but I objected for the reason that he prefers not to have a command at present,\" said the captain.  \"That makes it very fortunate for me.\"  \"Very true, though the change was not made for your sake. You were selected for this command as much on account of your discretion as for your skill and bravery as an officer.\"  \"I consider myself very highly complimented by the selection.\"  \"Now to the point: I have information that a fast steamer, intended to carry eight guns, called the Ovidio, sailed from the other side of the ocean some time since, and she is to be a vessel in the Confederate navy. Her first port will be Nassau, New Providence.\"  \"Does that prove that any Americans are traitors in and about New York, father?\" asked Christy.  \"She is to run the blockade with a cargo consisting in part of American goods.\"  Captain Passford took a file of papers from his pocket.     CHAPTER II  A COMPLICATED CASE   Captain Passford looked over his papers for a moment; but it was soon evident from his manner that he had secrets which he would not intrust even to his son, unless it was necessary to do so. He seemed to be armed with documentary evidence upon which to act, but he did not read any of his papers, and soon returned them to his pocket.  \"The American goods of which I speak are certain pieces of machinery to be used in the manufacture of arms,\" continued the captain. \"They cannot be obtained in England, and the traitors have decided to send them direct, rather than across the ocean in the first instance. These will form the principal and most important part of the cargo of a steamer now loaded, though she will carry other goods, such as the enemy need most at the present time.\"  \"I did not suppose any Americans were wicked enough to engage in such an enterprise for the sake of making money,\" said Christy indignantly.  \"The steamer of which you speak is already loaded, is she?\" asked Captain Chantor.  \"She is; and now I wish both of you to go with me, and I will point out the vessel to you, and you must mark her so well that you can identify her when occasion requires.\"  The trio left the house "]]]
