Now, love, you may put the book away.\"  Jem stuck out his lips and looked down, and hesitated. He seemed almost disposed to go on with his lessons. But he changed his mind, and shutting the book with a bang, he scampered off. As he passed the ottoman near the door, he saw Kitty, our old tortoise-shell puss, lying on it, and (moved perhaps by the occurrence of the word _cat_ in the last sentence of the lesson) he gave her such a whack with the flat side of _Chick-seed_ that she bounced up into the air like a sky-rocket, Jem crying out as he did so, \"I had my bat, and I hit him as he lay on the mat.\"  It was seldom enough that Jem got anything by heart, but he had certainly learned this; for when an hour later I went to look for him in the garden, I found him panting with the exertion of having laid my nice, thick, fresh green crop of mustard and cress flat with the back of the coal-shovel, which he could barely lift, but with which he was still battering my salad-bed, chanting triumphantly at every stroke, \"I had my bat, and I hit him as he lay on the mat.\" He was quite out of breath, and I had not much difficulty in pummelling him as he deserved.  Which shows how true it is, as my dear mother said, that \"you never know what to do for the best in bringing up boys.\"  Just about the time that we outgrew _Chick-seed_, and that it was allowed on all hands that even for quiet country-folk with no learned notions it was high time we were sent to school, our parents were spared the trouble of looking out for a school for us by the fact that a school came to us instead, and nothing less than an \"Academy\" was opened within three-quarters of a mile of my father's gate.  Walnut-tree Farm was an old house that stood some little way from the road in our favourite lane--a lane full of wild roses and speedwell, with a tiny footpath of disjointed flags like an old pack-horse track. Grass and milfoil grew thickly between the stones, and the turf stretched half-way over the road from each side, for there was little traffic in the lane, beyond the yearly rumble of the harvesting waggons; and few foot-passengers, except a labourer now and then, a pair or two of rustic lovers at sundown, a few knots of children in the blackberry season, and the cows coming home to milking.  Jem and I played there a good deal, but then we lived close by.  We were very fond of the old place and there were two good reasons for the charm it had in our eyes. In the first place, the old man who lived alone in it (for it had ceased to be the dwelling-house of a real farm) was an eccentric old miser, the chief object of whose existence seemed to be to thwart any attempt to pry into the daily details of it. What manner of stimulus this was to boyish curiosity needs no explanation, much as it needs excuse.  In the second place, Walnut-tree Farm was so utterly different from the house which was our home, that everything about it was attractive from mere unaccustomedness.  Our house had been rebuilt from the foundations by my father. It was square-built and very ugly, but it was in such excellent repair that one could never indulge a more lawless fancy towards any chink or cranny about it than a desire to \"point\" the same with a bit of mortar.  Why it was that my ancestor, who built the old house, and who was not a bit better educated or farther-travelled than my father, had built a pretty one, whilst my father built an ugly one, is one of the many things I do not know, and wish I did.  From the old sketches of it which my grandfather painted on the parlour handscreens, I think it must have been like a larger edition of the farm; that is, with long mullioned windows, a broad and gracefully proportioned doorway with several shallow steps and quaintly-ornamented lintel; bits of fine work and ornamentation about the woodwork here and there, put in as if they had been done, not for the look of the thing, but for the love of it, and whitewash over the house-front, and over the apple-trees in the orchard.  That was what our ancestor's home was like; and it was the sort of house that became Walnut-tree Academy, where Jem and I went to school.     CHAPTER II.       _Sable_:--\"Ha, you! A little more upon the dismal (_forming their      countenances_); this fellow has a good mortal look, place him near      the corpse; that wainscoat face must be o' top of the stairs; that      fellow's almost in a fright (that looks as if he were full of some      strange misery) at the end of the hall. So--but I'll fix you all      myself. Let's have no laughing now on any provocation.\"--_The      Funeral_, STEELE.   At one time I really hoped to make the acquaintance of the old miser of Walnut-tree Farm. It was when we saved the life of his cat.  He was very fond of that cat, I think, and it was, to say the least of it, as eccentric-looking as its master. One eye was yellow and the other was blue, which gave it a strange, uncanny expression, and its rust-coloured fur was not common either as to tint or markings.  How dear old Jem did belabour the boy we found torturing it! He was much older and bigger than we were, but we were two to one, which we reckoned fair enough, considering his size, and that the cat had to be saved somehow. The poor thing's forepaws were so much hurt that it could not walk, so we carried it to the farm, and I stood on the shallow doorsteps, and under the dial, on which was written--                       \"Tempora mutantur!\"--  and the old miser came out, and we told him about the cat, and he took it and said we were good boys, and I hoped he would have asked us to go in, but he did not, though we lingered a little; he only put his hand into his pocket, and very slowly brought out sixpence.  \"No, thank you,\" said I, rather indignantly. \"We don't want anything for saving the poor cat.\"  \"I am very fond of it,\" he said apologetically, and putting the sixpence carefully back; but I believe he alluded to the cat.  I felt more and more strongly that he ought to invite us into the parlour--if there was a parlour--and I took advantage of a backward movement on his part to move one shallow step nearer, and said, in an easy conversational tone, \"Your cat has very curious eyes.\"  He came out again, and his own eyes glared in the evening light as he touched me with one of his fingers in a way that made me shiver, and said, \"If I had been an old woman, and that cat had lived with me in the days when this house was built, I should have been hanged, or burned as a witch. Twelve men would have done it--twelve reasonable and respectable men!\" He paused, looking over my head at the sky, and then added, \"But in all good conscience--mind, in all good conscience!\"  And after another pause he touched me again (this time my teeth chattered), and whispered loudly in my ear, \"Never serve on a jury.\" After which he banged the door in our faces, and Jem caught hold of my jacket and cried, \"Oh! he's quite mad, he'll murder us!\" and we took each other by the hand and ran home as fast as our feet would carry us.  We never saw the old miser again, for he died some months afterwards, and, strange to relate, Jem and I were invited to the funeral.  It was a funeral not to be forgotten. The old man had left the money for it, and a memorandum, with the minutest directions, in the hands of his lawyer. If he had wished to be more popular after his death than he had been in his lifetime, he could not have hit upon any better plan to conciliate in a lump the approbation of his neighbours than that of providing for what undertakers call \"a first-class funeral.\" The good custom of honouring the departed, and committing their bodies to the earth with care and respect, was carried, in our old-fashioned neighbourhood, to a point at which what began in reverence ended in what was barely decent, and what was meant to be most melancholy became absolutely comical. But a sense of the congruous and the incongruous was not cultivated amongst us, whereas solid value (in size, quantity and expense) was perhaps over-estimated. So our furniture, our festivities, and our funerals bore witness.  No one had ever seen the old miser's furniture, and he gave no festivities; but he made up for it in his funeral.  Children, like other uneducated classes, enjoy domestic details, and going over the ins and outs of other people's affairs behind their backs; especially when the interest is heightened by a touch of gloom, or perfected by the addition of some personal importance in the matter. Jem and I were always fond of funerals, but this funeral, and the fuss that it made in the parish, we were never likely to forget.  Even our own household was so demoralized by the grim gossip of the occasion that Jem and I were accused of being unable to amuse ourselves, and of listening to our elders. It was perhaps fortunate for us that a favourite puppy died the day before the funeral, and gave us the opportunity of burying him.                \"As if our whole vocation                Were endless imitation----\"  Jem and I had already laid our gardens waste, and built a rude wall of broken bricks round them to make a churchyard; and I can clearly remember that we had so far profited by what we had overheard among our elders, that I had caught up some phrases which I was rather proud of displaying, and that I quite overawed Jem by the air with which I spoke of \"the melancholy occasion\"--the \"wishes of deceased\"--and the \"feelings of survivors\" when we buried the puppy.  It was understood that I could not attend the puppy's funeral in my proper person, because I wished to"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18078"],["title","Soldier Silhouettes on Our Front (#1)"],["body","led the singing.  A curt \"Sam, set up a tune,\" from the Tuskegee colored secretary started it.  This boy sat with his back to the audience.  He didn't even turn around to face them.  Low and sweetly he started singing.  You could hardly hear him at first.  Then a few boys near him took up the music.  Then a few more.  Then it gradually swept back over that crowd of men until every single negro was swaying to that simple music, and then it was that I caught the almost startlingly appropriate words:    \"It is good for a world in trouble;   It is good for a world in trouble;   It is good for a world in trouble;     And it's good enough for me.    It's the old-time religion;   It's the old-time religion;   It's the old-time religion;     And it's good enough for me.    It was good for my old mother;   It was good for my old mother;   It was good for my old mother;     And it's good enough for me.\"   Then much to my astonishment they did something that I have since learned is the very way that these songs grew from the beginning.  They extemporized a verse for the day, and they did it on the spot.  I made absolutely certain of that by careful investigation.  They sang this extra verse:    \"It was good for ole Abe Lincoln;   It was good for ole Abe Lincoln;   It was good for ole Abe Lincoln;     And it's good enough for me.\"   \"That first verse, 'It is good for a world in trouble,' is certainly a most appropriate one for these times in France,\" I said aside to the secretary.  \"Yes,\" he replied; \"if ever this pore ole worl' needed the sustainin' power of the religion of the Christ, it does now; an' if ever this pore ole worl' was in trouble, that time suttinly is right now,\" he added with fervor.  And now I can never think of the world, nor of the folks back here at home, nor of the millions of our boys over there that I do not hear the sweet voices of that crowd of negroes singing reverently and fervently:    \"It is good for a world in trouble;   It is good for a world in trouble;   It is good for a world in trouble;     And it's good enough for me.\"   Another Silhouette of Song that stands out against the background of memory is that of a hymn that I heard in Doctor Charles Jefferson's church just before I sailed for France.  I was lonely.  I walked into that great city church a stranger, as thousands of boys who have sailed from New York have done.  I never remember to have been so unutterably lonely and homesick.  It was cold in the city, and I was alone.  I turned to a church.  Thousands of boys have done the same, may the mothers and fathers of America know, and they have found comfort.  If the parents of this great nation could know how well their boys are guarded and cared for in New York City before they sail, they would have a feeling of comfort.  I sat down in this great church.  I was thinking more of other Sabbath mornings at home, with my wife and baby, than anything else.  A hymn was announced.  I stood up mechanically, but there was no song in my throat.  There was a great lump of loneliness only.  But suddenly I listened to the words they were singing.  Had they selected that hymn just for me?  It seemed so.  It so answered the loneliness in my heart with comfort and quiet.  That great congregation was singing:    \"Peace, perfect peace;   With loved ones far away;   In Jesus' keeping, we are safe; and they.\"   A great sense of peace settled over my heart, and I have quoted that old hymn all over France to the boys, and they have been comforted. Many a boy has asked me to write him a copy of that verse to stick in his note-book.  It seemed to give a sense of comfort to the lads, for their loved ones, too, were \"far away,\" and since I have come home I find that this, too, comes as a great comfort hymn to those who are here lonely for their boys \"over there.\"  And who shall forget the silhouette of approaching the shores of France by night as they have sailed down along the coast, cautiously and carefully, to find the opening of the submarine nets?  Who shall forget the sense of exhilaration that the news that land was near brought? Who shall forget the crowding to the railings by all on board to scan anxiously through the night for the first sight of land?  Then who shall forget seeing that first light from shore flash out through the darkness of night?  Who shall forget the red and green and white lights that began to twinkle, and gleam, and flash, and signal, and call?  How beautiful those lights looked after the long, dangerous, eventful, and dark voyage, without a single light showing on the ship!  And who shall forget the man along the railing who said, \"I never knew before the meaning of that old song, 'The Lights Along the Shore'\"?  And then, who can forget the fact that suddenly somebody started to sing that old hymn, \"The Lights Along the Shore,\" and of how it swept along the lower decks, and then to the upper decks, until a whole ship-load of people was singing it?  And then who shall forget how somebody else started \"Let the Lower Lights Be Burning\"?  Can such scenes ever be obliterated from one's memory?  No, not forever.  That silhouette remains eternally!  Five great transports were in.  They were lined up along the docks in the locks.  A Y. M. C. A. secretary was standing on the docks yelling up a word of welcome to the crowded railings of the great transports. The boats were not \"cleared\" as yet.  It would take an hour, and the secretary knew that something must be done, so he started to lead first one ship and then another in singing.  \"What shall we sing, boys?\" he would shout up to them from the docks below.  Some fellow from the railing yelled, \"Keep the Home Fires Burning,\" and that fine song rang out from five thousand throats.  I have heard it sung in the camps at home, I have heard it sung in great huts in France, but I never heard it when it sounded so significant and so sweet in its mighty volume as it sounded coming from that great khaki-lined transport, which had just landed an hour before in France. I stood beside the song-leader there on the docks looking up at that great mass of American humanity, a hundred feet above us, so far away that we could not recognize individual faces, on the high decks of one of the largest ships that sails the seas, and as that sweet song of war swept out over the docks and across the white town, and back across the Atlantic, I said to myself: \"That volume sounds as if it could make itself heard back home.\"  The man beside me said: \"The folks back home hear it all right, for they are eagerly listening for every sound that comes from that crowd of boys.  Yes, the folks back home hear it, and they'll 'keep the home fires burning' all right.  God bless them!\"  The last Silhouette of Song stands out against a background of green trees and spring, and the odor of a hospital, and Red Cross nurses going and coming, and boys lying in white robes everywhere.  My friend the song-leader had gone with me to hold the vesper service in the hospital.  Then we visited in the wards in order to see those who were so severely wounded that they could not get to the service.  There was a little group of men in one room.  The first thing I knew my friend had them singing.  At first they took to it awkwardly.  Then more courageously.  Then sweetly there rang through the hospital the strains of \"My Daddy Over There.\"  It melted my heart, for I have a baby girl at home who says to the neighbors, \"My daddy is the prettiest man in the world,\" and believes it.  I said to Cray: \"Why did you sing that particular song?\"  \"Oh,\" he replied, \"my baby's name is 'Betty,' and I found a guy whose baby's name is 'Betty' too, and we had a sort of club formed; and another guy had a baby boy, and then I just thought they'd like to sing 'My Daddy Over There.'  But we ended up with 'Jesus, Lover of My Soul,' so that ought to suit you.\"  \"Suit me, man?  Why I got a 'Betty' baby of my own, and that 'Daddy Over There' song you sang is the sweetest thing I've heard in France, and it will help those daddies more than a hymn would.  I'm glad you got them to singing.\"  And now I'm back home, and I thought the Silhouettes of Song were all over, but I stepped into a church the other Sunday.  Up high above the sacred altars of that church fluttered a beautiful silk service flag. It was starred in the shape of a letter \"S.\"  In the circle of each \"S\" was a red cross.  The church had two members in the Red Cross.  Above the \"S\" and below it were two red triangles.  The church had men in the service of the Y. M. C. A.  Then grouped about the \"S\" were the stars of boys in the service.  As I looked up at this cross a flood of memories swept over me.  I could not keep back the tears.  All the love, all the loneliness, all the heartache, all the pride, all the hope of the folks at home, their reverence, their loyalty, was summed up in that flag.  I stood to sing, my eyes brimming with tears.  The great congregation started that beautifully sweet hymn that is being sung all over America in the churches in loving memory of the boys over there:    \"God save our splendid men,   Send them safe home again,     God save our men.   Make them victorious,   Patient and chivalrous,   They are so dear to us,     God save our men.    God keep our own dear men,   From every stain of sin,     God keep our men.   When Satan would allure,   When tempted, keep them pure,   Be their protection sure--     God keep our men.    God hold our precious men,   And love them to the end.     God hold our men.   Held in Thine arms so strong   To Thee they all belong.   This ever be our song:     God hold our men.\"  I stood the pressure until that great congregation came to that line \"They are so dear to us,\" and the voice of the mother beside me broke, and she had to stop.  Then I had to stop, too, and we looked at each other through our tears and smiled and understood, so that when she sweetly said, \"I have a boy over there,"]]]
