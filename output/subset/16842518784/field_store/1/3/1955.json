The bottom of the tent was secured to the ground by pins (ʇihu¢ugadaⁿ--6) driven through holes (ʇihugaq¢uge) in the bottom of the skins, made when the latter were tanned and before they had become hard. The entrance (ʇijebe) was generally opposite the quarter from which the wind was blowing. A door flap (ʇijebeg¢aⁿ--7) hung over the entrance; it was made of skin with the hair outside, so as to turn water, and was held taut by a stick fastened to it transversely. The bottom of the door flap was loose, but the top was fastened to the tent.  [Illustration: Fig. 309--Exterior parts of an Omaha tent.]  The smokehole was formed by the two ʇihugab¢iⁿ¢a(9), or triangular ends of tent skins, immediately above the entrance and ʇi¢umaⁿhaⁿ. When there was no wind both of the ʇihugab¢iⁿ¢a were kept open by means of the ʇihu¢ubajiⁿ(8) or exterior tent poles, which were thrust through the ujiha, or small sacks, in the corners of the ʇihugab¢iⁿ¢a. When the wind blew one of the ʇihu¢ubajiⁿ was raised to the windward and the other was lowered, pulling its skin close to the tent and leaving an opening for the escape of the smoke; but if the wind came directly against the entrance both the flaps were raised, closing the smokehole to prevent the wind from blowing down it. When the wind blew the people used nandi¢agaspe to keep the bottom of each tent skin in place. These consisted of twisted grass, sticks, stones, or other heavy objects.  Figure 310 represents the tent of [P]ejequde, an Omaha. The banners or standards, which were carried by the leaders of a war party or a party going on a dancing tour, are depicted with their decorations of strips of red and blue Indian cloth. Sometimes these standards were ornamented with feathers instead of with cloth. Each standard could be used in four war expeditions.  No totem posts were in use among the Omaha. The tent of the principal man of each gens was decorated on the outside with his gentile badge, which was painted on each side of the entrance as well as on the back of the tent.[1] The furniture of the sacred tents resembled that of the ordinary ones.  Before the introduction of canvas tents by the whites no needles or thread were used by the Siouan tribes. The women used sinew of the deer or buffalo instead of thread, and for needles they had awls made of elk horn.  [Illustration: Fig. 310.--[P]ejequde's tent.]  Since there were no outbuildings, public granaries, or other structures of this description, each household stored away its own grain and other provisions. There were no special tribal or communal dwellings; but sometimes two or more households occupied a single earth lodge. When a council was held, it took place in the earth lodge of one of the head chiefs, or else two or three common tents were united, making one large one.[2] There were no public baths, as the Missouri river was near, and they could resort to it whenever they desired. Dance houses were improvised either of earth lodges or skin tents.  Sweat-lodges were in the form of low tents (ʇiu¢ipu).[3] Stones were not boiled for the sweat-lodge, but were put into the fire to be heated. They were removed from the fire by means of sticks called iⁿߵĕbasi¢aⁿ, and then water from the kettle was poured on them, creating steam. Cedar fronds were dropped on the stones, causing a perfume to arise.  [Footnote 1: Third Ann. Rep. Bur. Ethnology for 1882-'83, p. 230; also \"A Study of Siouan Cults,\" in Eleventh Ann. Rep. Bur. Ethnology, 1889-'90, p. 351.]  [Footnote 2: Third Ann. Rep., op. cit., p. 294.]  [Footnote 3: Contributions to North American Ethnology, vol. vi, 1890, pp. 152, 169, and 234.]     FURNITURE AND IMPLEMENTS.   Fireplaces.  Within the tent, in the center, was the fireplace (une¢ĕ), formed by excavating a small hollow. Beside this was erected a forked post (isag¢ĕ), on which was hung the apparatus for suspending a kettle over the fire. This apparatus was called ¢exe u¢ugacke by the Ponka, literally, \"that by means of which the kettle is hung.\" The Omaha have two names for it, uhaⁿ u¢ugacke, and u¢ugackeg¢e, the last syllable of the latter name referring to the attitude of the post. Around the fireplace was a circular space for the feet of the people as they sat about the fire. The couches of the occupants of the tent were arranged outside of and all around this circular space.   Beds and Bedding.  A couch was formed by laying down two or three winter hides dried with the hair on. These hides were placed around the fireplace at a safe distance. In the earth lodges, according to Joseph La Flèche, the Omaha used sahi, or grass mats, for seats, as is the present custom of the Winnebago; but at night they reclined on dressed hides with thick hair on them, and covered themselves with similar hides.  For pillows they used ibehiⁿ or iⁿbehiⁿ. When the vegetation was about 3 inches high in the spring, the Indians killed deer and pulled off the hair in order to remove the thin skin or tissue next to it. This latter, when thoroughly dried, is smooth and white, resembling parchment. It was used for pillows and moccasin-strings. When used for pillows the case was filled with goose feathers or the hair of the deer until it was about 2 feet long and 9 inches high. During the day, and whenever there was occasion, they were used as seats; but if none could be had, the people sat on winter robes or hides forming the couches.[1] Back of the couches and next to the interior tent-poles were placed the baggage, sacks of corn, and other household properties.  The upright tent is one form of the Dakota \"wake′ya,\" the plural of which, \"wake′yapi,\" undoubtedly gave rise to the familiar \"wick′iup\" of the plains, and also to \"wä-ka′-yo\" of Morgan.[2]   Cradles.  A board of convenient size, usually about a yard long and a foot wide, was selected to form a cradle or u¢uhe. No pillow was needed. A soft skin ([p]aq¢uqaha ¢aⁿ) covered with plenty of thick hair was laid on the board, and on it was placed the infant.  [Footnote 1: Hammocks and bedsteads were unknown prior to their introduction by the traders and other white people.]  [Footnote 2: Contributions to North American Ethnology, vol. iv., 1881, p. 114.]  [Illustration: Fig. 311.--Omaha cradle--plan.]  In the annexed figures, <i>a</i> is the ĭndua¢isiⁿkaⁿhe, the object painted on the board at the end where the infant's head is laid; <i>b</i> is the ĭndei¢idĭndiⁿ (\"that which is drawn taut over the face\"), the two strings of beads and sinew or thread (sometimes made of red calico alone), which keep in place the fan, etc.; the fan (ĭndeagani), which is suspended from a bow of wood, (<i>c</i>) is about 6 inches square, and is now made of interwoven sinew on which beads have been strung. Occasionally thimbles and other bright objects dangle from the bottom of the fan. The i¢a¢istage (<i>d</i>) is the band by which the infant is fastened to the cradle.  [Illustration: Fig. 312.--Omaha cradle--side view.]   Children's Swings.  For swings the ends of two withes of buffalo hide were secured to four trees or posts which formed the corners of a parallelogram. A blanket was thrown across the withes and folded over on them. The infant was laid on top of the fold and swung from side to side without falling.   Brooms.  Brooms were of two kinds. One form was made of sticks tied together, and was used for sweeping the ground outside of the tent or earth lodge, and the interior of the earth lodge, except the fireplace. The other kind was made of goose or turkey feathers, and was used for sweeping the fireplace of an earth lodge.   Pottery.  Pottery has not been made by the Omaha for more than fifty years. The art of making it has been forgotten by the tribe.   Mortar and Pestles.  A mortar was made by burning a large hole in a round knot or piece of wood about 7 inches in diameter. The lower end was sharpened to a point, which was thrust into the ground when needed for use. After putting corn in a mortar of this description, the woman grasped the wooden pestle in the middle, with the larger end upward; the smaller end, which was about an inch in diameter, was put into the mortar. The operation of pounding corn among the Omaha was called \"he.\" The mortar (uhe) and pestle (wehe) were both made commonly of elm, although sometimes they were fashioned of white oak. Mortars were of various sizes, some of them measuring 2 feet in diameter. Pestles were always of hard and heavy wood, and fully 3 feet long, taperring from 4 inches to an inch in diameter.  [Illustration: Fig. 314.--Omaha pestle.]  [Illustration: Fig. 313.--Omaha mortar.]   Spoons, Ladles and Drinking Vessels.  Spoons were made of horn, wood, or pottery. The black spoons made of buffalo horn (ʇehe sabĕ), are not used by such Omaha as belong to the Buffalo gentes (Iñkesabĕ, Ȼatada, [T]esinde, etc.) which may not touch a buffalo head. Other horn spoons of light color are made of cow horn. These are of modern origin. Wooden spoons (jaⁿʇehe) were made of knobs or knots of trees. Spoons made of buffalo horn are found among the Omaha and Ponka, but the Osage, Kansa, and Kwapa use clam shells (ʇihaba, in Ȼegiha; tcühaba, tcühuba, in Kansa), so the Kansa call a small spoon, tcühaba jiñga. Spoons of buffalo horn had their handles variously ornamented by notches and other rude carving, often terminating in the head of a bird, the neck or handle of each being elevated at an angle of 50° or 60° with the bowl, which, was about 3 inches in width by about 5 in length. As the handle of such a spoon usually terminates in a head or hook, it was impossible for it to slip into the bowl when the hook rested on the outside of the rim of the bowl.  Food was served in bowls of a very wide and simple form and of various sizes, generally carved out of large knots of wood. These served as drinking cups (ni′i¢átaⁿ), but now cups of tin or earthenware are "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19913"],["title","Omaha Dwellings, Furniture and Implements (#2)"],["body","for that purpose.   Water Vessels  When pottery was made, they used bowls and kettles. Some used wooden bowls of different sizes, the largest being about 2 feet in diameter. When they went on the hunt, they used the ínijeha (or sack made of the muscular coating of the buffalo paunch, by filling with, grass to make it stand out and keep its shape until dried). When the ínijeha was filled with water the mouth was tied, and it was kept covered and in the shade that it might remain cool. After being used for a few days it became strong smelling, and was thrown away, another taking its place. Some preferred the \"ʇenăn′de uq¢a′ha ¢aⁿ\" or pericardium(?) of the buffalo, which is like sinew. This does not smell unpleasant, even when used for seven or ten days. But at the expiration of that time it is unfit for further service.  Jugs have been introduced by the traders.   Other Vessels.  Provision sacks or parflèche cases were made of dried buffalo hide. When used for carrying the dried meat, they were called weábastá. After two or three years' use they became soft and were fit only for making moccasin soles. These sacks had the hair taken off, and were sometimes made in trunk fashion.  Fruit baskets were of three kinds. The Ponka made them of the bark of a tree, called tawáߵaⁿhe, which is found on the old Ponka reservation in Dakota. Northern Indians make boats of this bark. The Omaha do not find the tree on their land, so they make the fruit baskets of other kinds of bark. The three kinds of baskets are as follows: Naⁿ′pa ú¢isĕ, used for chokecherries; ag¢añ′kamañge ú¢isĕ, used for raspberries; and bact ú¢isĕ, used for strawberries. When the Ponka wished to make the baskets, they stripped off the bark in horizontal sections, not pulling upward or downward.  In modern times the Omaha have learned to make sacks of thread of different colors drawn from black, red, blue, and white blankets. Different figures are woven. Each sack is about a foot deep, 16 inches from the mouth to the opposite side, and from 2 to 2-1/2 feet long. The opening is on one of the long sides, and when the articles are put in a gathering string is drawn and tied.   Hoes and Axes.  For hoes, the Omaha used the shoulder blades of the buffalo. Axes and hatchets are now made of iron, hence, the Omaha name, maⁿ′ze-pe, sharp iron. But the Kansa have the ancient name, maⁿ′hi-spe, answering to the Dakota, waⁿhiⁿ′-kpe, sharp flint. The hatchet is distinguished from the ax by adding \"jiñga,\" small. Some of the stone axes and hatchets have been found on the Omaha reservation, but they could hardly have been used for cutting. It is not known what tools were used for felling trees.   Knives.  Knives were made of stone. A prominent butte, near the old Ponka agency, Nebraska, is known as \"Máhiⁿ-ʇu,\" signifying blue knife, from the character of the stone with which its surface is covered. It is several miles from the mouth of Ponka creek and nearly opposite the month of Choteau creek, South Dakota.   Implements Connected with Fire.  In former ages, the Ȼegiha made fire by rubbing or turning a stick round and round between the hands. On the present Omaha reservation, and in that region, the Omaha use elm roots for that purpose. In the country called [P]izábahéhe, near the source of Elkhorn river, there is a grass known as \"duáduáhi,\" which has about a hundred fine shoots from each root, which is half the size of the head. The stalk was used for hand drills and fire sticks. One stalk was cut almost flat, and the man puts his feet on the ends to steady them. Then, holding the other stick in his hands, with one end touching the stalk on the ground, he turned it round and round till the friction produced fire. Sometimes a small quantity of dry sand was placed on the flat stick. The same flat stick answered for several occasions. When the cavity made by turning the hand drill became too large, the point of contact was shifted to another part of the flat stick, and so on until the whole of that stick was used, when it was thrown away and another was obtained. Duáduáhi, according to Mr. Francis La Flesche, may be found in Judiciary square, Washington, District of Columbia. After the coming of the white man, but before the introduction of friction matches, which are now used by the whole tribe, the Omaha used flints and tinder for making fire.  Spits for roasting, etc., náqpe, or wébasnaⁿ, were made of any kind of wood.  For tongs they used the [p]edi¢a¢isande (\"fire-holder\"), made by slitting one end of a stick. This implement was also called, jaⁿ jiñga nini ibista (\"the stick that presses the fire against the tobacco\"), because it was used for lighting pipes.   Smoking Paraphernalia.  [Illustration: Fig. 315.--Omaha calumet]  The pipes in use among the Omaha are of three kinds: the sacred pipe (niniba waqube, mysterious pipe), including the war pipes and those used by the chiefs in making peace; the niniba weawaⁿ or calumet (illustrated in figure 315), used in the calumet dance or dance of adoption,[1] and the hatchet pipe or maⁿzepe niniba, introduced since the coming of the white man. One form of the pipe used on ordinary Tobacco pouches (niniújiha) were made of deer or antelope skin, and were ornamented with porcupine quills or a fringe of deerskin. Sometimes buffalo bladders were used for this purpose. The women used them as receptacles for their porcupine quills.  [Footnote 1: See \"Omaha Sociology,\" Third Ann. Rept. Bur. Ethnology, chap. vi.]  occasions is shown in figure 316. This pipe has a bowl of catlinite, and the stem is decorated with horsehair.  [Illustration: Fig. 316.--Omaha pipe used on ordinary occasions.]   Equipage for Horses.  Saddles (cánakág¢e) were in use before the coming of the whites. They were made of wood, around which was wrapped hide, while still \"ʇaha-nuʞa\" (green or soft). According to Joseph La Flèche these saddles did not rub sores on the backs of the native horses (Indian ponies), but Dougherty[1] said, in 1819, \"The Indians are generally cruel horse-masters, perhaps in a great measure through necessity; the backs of their horses are very often sore and ulcerated, from the friction of the rude saddle, which is fashioned after the Spanish manner, being elevated at the pummel and croup, and resting on skin saddle cloths without padding.\" They ride very well, and make frequent use of the whip and their heels, the latter being employed instead of spurs.  For bridles and halters they used strips of hide, out of which material they made also lariats. The bridle used consisted of a withe, one end of which was wrapped two or three times around the animal's lower jaw, while the other was held in the hand, forming but a single rein. This did not hinder the rider from guiding his horse, as he was able to turn him to the left by pressing the single rein against the animal's neck, as well as by the use of the right heel against its side. When he wished to turn to the right, he pulled the rein and pressed his left heel against the horse's side.  Whips were of three kinds. The wahí wégasapi was attached to a bone handle. The handle of a ja^{u}′uke¢iⁿ wégasapi was made of common wood. That of a zaⁿzí wégasapi was made of Osage orange wood, which is very hard. The whip was attached to the wrist by a broad band, which passed through a hole near the end of the handle. The handle was about 15 inches long and was very stout. A specimen that has been deposited in the National Museum (a gift to the author from an Omaha) has a lash 2 feet long, composed of 8 thongs one-fifth of an inch wide. These are plaited together in one rounded plait for 18 inches, the rest of the lash being in 2 plaits of 4 thongs each, knotted near the ends.  The lasso was called maⁿ′tanah-í¢ize, i.e., \"that by which (a) wild (horse) is taken.\" It was made by taking the hair from the head of a buffalo and plaiting it into a very strong rope as thick as one's thumb. This rope was called \"ʇaha-¢isaⁿ,\" and was utilized by the Omaha and Ponka instead of the common lasso for catching wild horses in northwestern Nebraska. One end of the rope was formed into a noose large enough to slip over a horse's head, and the ends of this noose were secured to a long pole by small cords. The other end of the rope, arranged in a coil, was fastened to the belt or waist of the man. He rode with the pole held in one hand and tried to thrust the noose in front of a horse. When he succeeded in passing the noose over the head of an animal, he threw away the stick, which had become separated from the noose, and held the rope alone, which he pulled toward him. When the horse was caught, the man made an ĭndú¢iciⁿ. (bridle or face cover), being careful to place some buffalo hair over the nose and under the chin, to guard against paining the horse, whose eyes remained uncovered.  [Footnote 1: Long, S. H.; Exp. Rocky Mts., vol. 1, p. 291, Phila., 1822]  Trappings for the saddle (sĭn′de-ehé¢ĕ) were used. Some years ago a specimen of Omaha trapping was presented by the writer to the Anthropological Society of Washington, and subsequently was deposited in the National Museum.   Traveling Gear.  Snow-shoes (sé-hiⁿbe) were worn by the Omaha and Ponka when they traversed a region, north of their modern, habitat.  For traveling on foot a staff (hí-mañg¢e) was used when it was necessary to pass over mountains; also when, heavy loads had to be carried. This staff differed from the crutch (í-mañg¢e).  The women had mácaʞa^n, or straps, for aiding them in carrying loads of wood, etc.   Boats.  When they wished to cross streams they made hide boats, or mandéha. These were manufactured from dried buffalo hides, which were sewed together with sinew, and so tightly that no water could penetrate the seams. Ten branches of red willow were placed within, the ends being bent upward and fastened by withes to two other saplings, which extended the whole length of the boat at the inside of the gunwale. The ten pieces were the ʇíci-í"]]]
