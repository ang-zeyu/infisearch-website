Obviously hostilities had begun without the knowledge and against the wishes of the Tsar; if they were also to be carried on against his wish, then Austria-Hungary would be too late.  I have never discussed this phase with Berchtold, but the material placed at my disposal leaves no doubt that he felt bound to inquire into this side of the question and then leave the decision to the Emperor Francis Joseph.  On the following day, July 31, therefore, Tschirsky, at the Ballplatz, communicated the contents of a telegram from King George to Prince Henry of Prussia. It ran as follows:--    \"Thanks for telegram. So pleased to hear of William's efforts to   concert with Nicky to maintain peace. Indeed, I am earnestly   desirous that such an irreparable disaster as a European war   should be averted. My Government is doing its utmost, suggesting   to Russia and France to suspend further military preparations if   Austria will consent to be satisfied with occupation of Belgrade   and the neighbouring Serbian territory as a hostage for   satisfactory settlement of her demands, other countries meanwhile   suspending their war preparations. Trust William will use his   great influence to induce Austria to accept this proposal, thus   proving that Germany and England are working together to prevent   what would be an international catastrophe. Pray assure William I   am doing and shall continue to do all that lies in my power to   preserve peace of Europe.    GEORGE.\"  Both the telegrams cited were received in Vienna on July 31, subject to certain military precautions, a proceeding that did not satisfy London.  In London, as in Berlin, an effort was made to confine the conflict to Serbia. Berchtold did the same. In Russia there was a strong party working hard to enforce war at any price. The Russian invasion was an accomplished fact, and in Vienna it was thought unwise to stop mobilisation at the last moment for fear of being too late with defence. Some ambassadors did not keep to the instructions from their Governments; they communicated messages correctly enough, but if their personal opinion differed they made no secret of it, and it certainly weighed in the balance.  This added to the insecurity and confusion. Berchtold vacillated, torn hither and thither by different influences. It was a question of hours merely; but they passed by and were not made use of, and disaster was the result.  Russia had created strained conditions which brought on the world war.  Some months after the outbreak of war I had a long conversation on all these questions with the Hungarian Prime Minister, Count Stephen Tisza. He was decidedly opposed to the severe ultimatum, as he foresaw a war and did not wish for it. It is one of the most widely spread errors to stigmatise Tisza to-day as one of the instigators of the war. He was opposed to it, not from a general pacifist tendency, but because, in his opinion, an efficiently pursued policy of alliance would in a few years considerably strengthen the powers of the Monarchy. He particularly returned to the subject of Bulgaria, which then was still neutral and whose support he had hoped to gain before we went to war. I also obtained from Tisza several details concerning the activities of the German Government as displayed by the German Ambassador immediately preceding the war. I purposely made a distinction between the German Government and the German diplomat, as I was under the impression that Herr von Tschirsky had taken various steps without being instructed so to do, and when I previously have alluded to the fact that not all the ambassadors made use of the language enjoined by their Governments, I had Herr von Tschirsky specially in my mind; his whole temperament and feelings led him to interfere in our affairs with a certain vehemence and not always in the most tactful way, thus rousing the Monarchy out of its lethargy.  There is no doubt whatever that all Herr von Tschirsky's private speeches at this time were attuned to the tone of \"Now or Never,\" and it is certain that the German Ambassador declared his opinion to be \"that at the present moment Germany was prepared to support our point of view with all her moral and military power, but whether this would prove to be the case in future if we accepted the Serbian rebuff appears to me doubtful.\" I believe that Tschirsky in particular was firmly persuaded that in the very near future Germany would have to go through a war against France and Russia, and he considered that the year 1914 would be more favourable than a later date. For this reason, because first of all he did not believe in the fighting capacity of either Russia or France, and secondly because--and this is a very important point--he was convinced that he could bring the Monarchy into this war, while it appeared doubtful to him that the aged and peace-loving Emperor Francis Joseph would draw the sword for Germany on any other occasion where the action would centre less round him, he wished to make use of the Serbian episode so as to be sure of Austria-Hungary in the deciding struggle. That, however, was his policy, and not Bethmann's.  This, I repeat, is the impression produced on me by lengthy conversations with Count Tisza--an impression which has been confirmed from other sources. I am persuaded, however, that Tschirsky, in behaving as he did, widely overstretched his prescribed sphere of activity. Iswolsky was not the only one of his kind. I conclude this to be so, since Tschirsky, as intimated in a former dispatch, was never in a position to make an official declaration urging for war, but appears only to have spoken after the manner of diplomatic representatives when anxious to adapt the policy of their Government to their own point of view. Undoubtedly Tschirsky transmitted his instructions correctly and loyally, nor did he keep back or secrete anything. An ambassador attains more or less according to the energy expended by him in carrying out the instructions of his Government; and the private opinion of the ambassador is, under certain circumstances, not easy to distinguish from his official one. At all events, the latter will be influenced by the former, and Tschirsky's private opinion aimed at a more vigorous policy.  In complete ignorance of impending events, I had arrived at Steiermark a few days before the ultimatum in order to establish my family there for the summer. While there I received a message from Berchtold to return to my post as quickly as possible. I obeyed at once, but before leaving had one more audience with the Emperor Francis Joseph at Ischl. I found the Emperor extremely depressed. He alluded quite briefly to the coming events, and merely asked me if, in case of a war, I could guarantee Roumania's neutrality. I answered in the affirmative, so long as King Carol was alive; beyond that any guarantee was impossible.   3  Certain extremely important details relating to the period immediately preceding the outbreak of war can only be attributed to the influence of the group represented by Tschirsky. It is incomprehensible why we granted to our then allies, Italy and Roumania, facilities for playing the part of seceders by presenting them with an ultimatum before action was completed, instead of winning them over and involving them also.  I am no accurate judge of the events in Rome, but King Carol in Roumania had certainly tried everything to induce Serbia to yield. In all probability he would not have succeeded, as Serbia had no idea of renouncing her plans for a Greater Serbia; but presumably an anxious feeling would have arisen between Bucharest and Belgrade, which would strongly have influenced further Roumanian policy in our favour.  Bucharest has made enormous capital out of the diplomatic proceedings.  Before the first decisive Cabinet Council Baron Fasciotti, the Italian Ambassador, harangued all the members in this spirit, and declared that the situation in Roumania and Italy was similar, and in each case there was no reason for co-operation, as neither Rome nor Bucharest had previously come to an understanding regarding the ultimatum. His efforts were crowned with success.  On August 1, 1914, I sent the following telegram to Berchtold:    \"The Prime Minister has just notified me the result of the Cabinet   Council. After a warm appeal from the King to bring the treaty   into force, the Cabinet Council, with one exception, declared that   no party could undertake the responsibility of such action.    \"The Cabinet Council has resolved that _as Roumania was neither   notified nor consulted concerning the Austro-Hungarian action in   Belgrade no casus foederis exists_. The Cabinet Council further   resolved that military preparations for the safety of the frontier   be undertaken, which would be an advantage for the   Austro-Hungarian Monarchy, as several hundred miles of its   frontiers would thereby be covered.    \"The Prime Minister added that he had already given orders to   strengthen all military posts, after which by degrees general   mobilisation would follow.    \"The Government intends only to publish a short communiqu√©   relating to the military measures taken for the safety of the   country.\"  Secondly, it appears incomprehensible why the ultimatum was drawn up as it was. It was not so much a manifestation of Berchtold's wish for war, as of other influences, above all that of Tschirsky. In 1870 Bismarck also desired war, but the Ems telegram was of quite a different character.  In the present case it appears incomprehensible why a Note should have been selected which by its wording gave umbrage to many who hitherto were favourably disposed towards us.  Had we, before the ultimatum and after the assassination, secretly and confidentially furnished proofs to the Great Powers who were not inimical to us, and especially to England, that trouble was impending over a political murder staged at Belgrade, we should have evoked"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18172"],["title","This World Is Taboo (#1)"],["body","--ah--verified your statements,\" said the third voice from Weald. \"Just one more item. Are you alone in your ship?\"  \"Of course,\" said Calhoun, frowning.  \"Quite alone?\" insisted the voice.  \"Obviously!\" said Calhoun.  \"No other living creature?\" insisted the voice again. \"Of--oh!\" said Calhoun, annoyed. He called over his shoulder. \"Murgatroyd! Come here!\"  Murgatroyd hopped to his lap and gazed interestedly at the screen. The bland face changed remarkably. The voice changed even more.  \"Very good!\" it said. \"Very, very good! Blueskins do not have _tormals_! You are Med Service! By all means come in! Your coordinates will be....\"  Calhoun wrote them down. He clicked off the communicator again and growled to Murgatroyd, \"So I might have been a blueskin, eh? And you're my passport, because only Med Ships have members of your tribe aboard! What the hell's the matter, Murgatroyd? They act like they think somebody's trying to get down on their planet with a load of plague germs!\"  He grumbled to himself for minutes. The life of a Med Ship man is not exactly a sinecure, at best. It means long periods in empty space in overdrive, which is absolute and deadly tedium. Then two or three days aground, checking official documents and statistics, and asking questions to see how many of the newest medical techniques have reached this planet or that, and the supplying of information about such as have not arrived.  Then the lifting out to space for long periods of tedium, to repeat the process somewhere else. Med Ships carry only one man because two could not stand the close contact without quarreling with each other. But Med Ships do carry _tormals_, like Murgatroyd, and a _tormal_ and a man can get along indefinitely, like a man and a dog. It is a highly unequal friendship, but it seems to be satisfactory to both.  Calhoun was very much annoyed with the way the Med Service had been operated in Sector Twelve. He was one of many men at work to correct the results of incompetence in directing Med Service in this sector. But it is always disheartening to have to labor at making up for somebody else's blundering, when there is so much new work that needs to be done.  The condition shown by the landing-grid suspicions was a case in point. Blueskins were people who inherited a splotchy skin pigmentation from other people who'd survived a plague. Weald plainly maintained a one-planet quarantine against them. But a quarantine is normally an emergency measure. The Med Service should have taken over, wiped out the need for a quarantine, and then lifted it. It hadn't been done.  Calhoun fumed to himself.  The world of Weald Three grew brighter and brighter and became a disk. The disk had icecaps and a reasonable proportion of land and water surface. The ship decelerated, voices notifying observation from the surface, and the little ship came to a stop some five planetary diameters out from solidity. The landing field's force-field locked on to it, and its descent began.  The business of landing was all very familiar, from the blue rim which appeared at the limb of the planet from one diameter out, to the singular flowing-apart of the surface features as the ship sank still lower. There was the circular landing-grid, rearing skyward for nearly a mile. It could let down interstellar liners from emptiness and lift them out to emptiness again, with great convenience and economy for everyone.  It landed the Med Ship in its center, and there were officials to greet Calhoun, and he knew in advance the routine part of his visit. There would be an interview with the planet's chief executive, by whatever title he was called. There would be a banquet. Murgatroyd would be petted by everybody. There would be painful efforts to impress Calhoun with the splendid conduct of public health matters on Weald. He would be told much scandal.  He might find one man, somewhere, who passionately labored to advance the welfare of his fellow humans by finding out how to keep them well or, failing that, how to make them well when they got sick. And in two days, or three, Calhoun would be escorted back to the landing-grid, and lifted out to space, and he'd spend long empty days in overdrive and land somewhere else to do the whole thing all over again.  It all happened exactly as he expected, with one exception. Every human being he met on Weald wanted to talk about blueskins. Blueskins and the idea of blueskins obsessed everyone. Calhoun listened without asking questions until he had the picture of what blueskins meant to the people who talked of them. Then he knew there would be no use asking questions at random.  Nobody mentioned ever having seen a blueskin. Nobody mentioned a specific event in which a blueskin had at any named time taken part. But everybody was afraid of blueskins. It was a patterned, an inculcated, a stage-directed fixed idea. And it found expression in shocked references to the vileness, the depravity, the monstrousness of the blueskin inhabitants of Dara, from whom Weald must at all costs be protected.  It did not make sense. So Calhoun listened politely until he found an undistinguished medical man who wanted some special information about gene selection as practised halfway across the galaxy. He invited that man to the Med Ship, where he supplied the information not hitherto available. He saw his guest's eyes shine a little with that joyous awe a man feels when he finds out something he has wanted long and badly to know.  \"Now,\" said Calhoun, \"tell me something? Why does everybody on this planet hate the inhabitants of Dara? It's light-years away. Nobody claims to have suffered in person from them. Why make a point of hating them?\"  The Wealdian doctor grimaced.  \"They've blue patches on their skins. They're different from us. So they can be pictured as a danger and our political parties can make an election issue out of competing for the privilege of defending us from them. They had a plague on Dara, once. They're accused of still having it ready for export.\"  \"Hm,\" said Calhoun. \"The story is that they want to spread contagion here, eh? Doesn't anybody\"--his tone was sardonic--\"doesn't anybody urge that they be massacred as an act of piety?\"  \"Yes-s-s-s,\" admitted the doctor reluctantly. \"It's mentioned in political speeches.\"  \"But how's it rationalized?\" demanded Calhoun. \"What's the argument to make pigment-patches involve moral and physical degradation, as I'm assured is the case?\"  \"In the public schools,\" said the doctor, \"the children are taught that blueskins are now carriers of the disease they survived--three generations ago! That they hate everybody who isn't a blueskin. That they are constantly scheming to introduce their plague here so most of us will die and the rest will become blueskins. That's beyond rationalizing. It can't be true, but it's not safe to doubt it.\"  \"Bad business,\" said Calhoun coldly. \"That sort of thing usually costs lives in the end. It could lead to massacre!\"  \"Perhaps it has, in a way,\" said the doctor unhappily. \"One doesn't like to think about it.\" He paused. \"Twenty years ago there was a famine on Dara. There were crop failures. The situation must have been very bad: They built a spaceship.  \"They've no use for such things normally, because no nearby planet will deal with them or let them land. But they built a spaceship and came here. They went in orbit around Weald. They asked to trade for shiploads of food. They offered any price in heavy metals--gold, platinum, irridium, and so on. They talked from orbit by vision communicators. They could be seen to be blueskins. You can guess what happened!\"  \"Tell me,\" said Calhoun.  \"We armed ships in a hurry,\" admitted the doctor. \"We chased their spaceship back to Dara. We hung in space off the planet. We told them we'd blast their world from pole to pole if they ever dared take to space again. We made them destroy their one ship, and we watched on visionscreens as it was done.\"  \"But you gave them food?\"  \"No,\" said the doctor ashamedly. \"They were blueskins.\"  \"How bad was the famine?\"  \"Who knows? Any number may have starved! And we kept a squadron of armed ships in their skies for years--to keep them from spreading the plague, we said. And some of us believed it!\"  The doctor's tone was purest irony.  \"Lately,\" he said, \"there's been a move for economy in our government. Simultaneously, we began to have a series of overabundant crops. The government had to buy the excess grain to keep the price up. Retired patrol ships, built to watch over Dara, were available for storage space. We filled them up with grain and sent them out into orbit. They're there now, hundreds of thousands or millions of tons of grain!\"  \"And Dara?\"  The doctor shrugged. He stood up.  \"Our hatred of Dara,\" he said, again ironically, \"has produced one thing. Roughly halfway between here and Dara there's a two-planet solar system, Orede. There's a usable planet there. It was proposed to build an outpost of Weald there, against blueskins. Cattle were landed to run wild and multiply and make a reason for colonists to settle there.  \"They did, but nobody wants to move near to blueskins! So Orede stayed uninhabited until a hunting party, shooting wild cattle, found an outcropping of heavy-metal ore. So now there's a mine there. And that's all. A few hundred men work the mine at fabulous wages. You may be asked to check on their health. But not Dara's!\"  \"I see,\" said Calhoun, frowning.  The doctor moved toward the Med Ship's exit port.  \"I answered your questions,\" he said grimly. \"But if I talked to anyone else as I've done to you, I'd be lucky only to be driven into exile!\"  \"I shan't give you away,\" said Calhoun. He did not smile.         *       *       *       *       *  When the doctor had gone, Calhoun said deliberately, \"Murgatroyd, you should be grateful that you're a _tormal_ and not a man. There's nothing about being a _tormal_ to make you ashamed!\"  Then he grimly"]]]
