The ordeal was not a formidable one. He was shown into a room where eight or ten elderly gentlemen were sitting round a large table. Among these was his friend of the day before. He was asked a question or two about his age, his father's profession, and his place of education. Then the gentleman at the head of the table nodded to him, and said he could go, and instructions would be sent to him, and that he was to prepare to sail in the Lizzie Anderson, which would leave the docks in ten days' time, and that he would be, for the present, stationed at Madras.  Much delighted at having got through the ordeal so easily, Charlie returned to his uncle's. He did not venture to penetrate into the latter's counting house, but awaited his coming upstairs to dinner, to tell him the news.  \"Humph!\" said his uncle; \"it is lucky they did not find out what a fool you were, at once. I was rather afraid that even the two minutes would do it. After dinner, I will send my clerk round with you, to get the few things which are necessary for your voyage.  \"I suppose you will want to, what you call amuse yourself, to see the beasts at Exeter Change, and the playhouses. Here are two sovereigns. Don't get into loose company, and don't get drinking, sir, or out of the house you go.\"  Charlie attempted to express his thanks, but his uncle stopped him abruptly.  \"Hold your tongue, sir. I am doing what is right; a thing, sir, Joshua Tufton always has done, and doesn't expect to be thanked for it. All I ask you is, that if you rob the Company's till and are hung, don't mention that you are related to me.\"  After dinner was over, Charlie went out under the charge of an old clerk, and visited tailors' and outfitters' shops, and found that his uncle's idea of the few necessaries for a voyage differed very widely from his own. The clerk, in each case, inquired from the tradesmen what was the outfit which gentlemen going to India generally took with them, and Charlie was absolutely appalled at the magnitude of the orders. Four dozen shirts, ten dozen pairs of stockings, two dozen suits of white cotton cloth, and everything else in proportion. Charlie in vain remonstrated, and even implored the clerk to abstain from ordering what appeared to him such a fabulous amount of things; and begged him, at any rate, to wait until he had spoken to his uncle. The clerk, however, replied that he had received instructions that the full usual outfit was to be obtained, and that Mr. Tufton never permitted his orders to be questioned. Charlie was forced to submit, but he was absolutely oppressed with the magnitude of his outfit, to carry which six huge trunks were required.  \"It is awful,\" Charlie said to himself, \"positively awful. How much it will all come to, goodness only knows; three or four hundred pounds, at least.\"  In those days, before steam was thought of, and the journey to India was often of six months' duration, men never came home more than once in seven years, and often remained in India from the day of their arrival until they finally retired, without once revisiting England. The outfits taken out were, therefore, necessarily much larger than at the present time, when a run home to England can be accomplished in three weeks, and there are plenty of shops, in every town in India, where all European articles of necessity or luxury can be purchased.  After separating from the clerk, Charlie felt altogether unable to start out in search of amusement. He wandered about vaguely till supper time, and then attempted to address his uncle on the subject.  \"My dear Uncle,\" he began, \"you've been so awfully kind to me, that I really do not like to trespass upon you. I am positively frightened at the outfit your clerk has ordered. It is enormous. I'm sure I can't want so many things, possibly, and I would really rather take a much smaller outfit; and then, as I want them, I can have more things out from England, and pay for them myself.\"  \"You don't suppose,\" Mr. Tufton said sternly, \"that I'm going to have my nephew go out to India with the outfit of a cabin boy. I ordered that you were to have the proper outfit of a gentleman, and I requested my clerk to order a considerable portion of the things to be made of a size which will allow for your growing, for you look to me as if you were likely enough to run up into a lanky giant, of six feet high. I suppose he has done as I ordered him. Don't let me hear another word on the subject.\"    Chapter 2: The Young Writer.   For the next four days, Charlie followed his uncle's instructions and amused himself. He visited Exeter Change, took a boat and rowed down the river to Greenwich, and a coach and visited the palace of Hampton Court. He went to see the coaches make their start, in the morning, for all places in England, and marvelled at the perfection of the turnouts. He went to the playhouses twice, in the evening, and saw Mr. Garrick in his performance as Richard the Third.  On the fifth day, a great surprise awaited him. His uncle, at breakfast, had told him briefly that he did not wish him to go out before dinner, as someone might want to see him; and Charlie, supposing that a messenger might be coming down from the India House, waited indoors; and an hour later he was astonished, when the door of the room opened and his mother and sisters entered.  With a shout of gladness and surprise, Charlie rushed into their arms.  \"My dear mother, my dear girls, this is an unexpected pleasure, indeed! Why, what has brought you here?\"  \"Didn't you know we were coming, Charlie? Didn't Uncle tell you?\" they exclaimed.  \"Not a word,\" Charlie said. \"I never dreamt of such a thing. What, has he called you up here to stay till I go?\"  \"Oh, my dear, he has been so kind,\" his mother said; \"and so funny! He wrote me such a scolding letter, just as if I had been a very naughty little girl. He said he wasn't going to allow me to bring disgrace upon him, by living in wretched lodgings at Yarmouth, nor by his grandnieces being sent out as governesses. So he ordered me at once--ordered me Charlie, as if I had no will of my own--to give up the lodgings, and to take our places in the coach, yesterday morning. He said we were not to shame him by appearing here in rags, and he sent me a hundred pounds, every penny of which, he said, was to be laid out in clothes. As to the future, he said it would be his duty to see that I brought no further disgrace upon the family.\"  \"Yes, and he's been just as kind to me, Mother. As I told you when I wrote, he had ordered an enormous outfit, which will, I am sure, cost hundreds of pounds. He makes me go to the playhouses, and all sorts of amusements; and all the time he has been so kind he scolds, and grumbles, and predicts that I shall be hanged.\"  \"I'm sure you won't,\" Kate, his youngest sister, said indignantly. \"How can he say such a thing?\"  \"He doesn't mean it,\" Charlie laughed. \"It's only his way. He will go on just the same way with you, I have no doubt; but you mustn't mind, you know, and mustn't laugh, but must look quite grave and serious.  \"Ah! Here he is.  \"Oh, Uncle, this is kind of you!\"  \"Hold your tongue, sir,\" said his uncle, \"and try and learn not to speak to your elders, unless you are addressed.  \"Niece Mary,\" he said, kissing her upon the forehead, \"I am glad to see you again. You are not so much changed as I expected.  \"And these are my grandnieces, Elizabeth and Kate, though why Kate I don't know. It is a fanciful name, and new to the family, and I am surprised that you didn't call her Susanna, after your grandmother.\"  Kate made a little face at the thought of being called Susanna. However, a warning glance from Charlie closed her lips, just as she was about to express her decided preference for her own name. Mr. Tufton kissed them both, muttering to himself:  \"I suppose I ought to kiss them. Girls always expect to be kissed at every opportunity.  \"What are you laughing at, grandniece?\"  \"I don't think girls expect to be kissed, except by people they like,\" Kate said; \"but we do like kissing you, Uncle,\" throwing her arms round his neck, and kissing him heartily; \"because you have been so kind to Charlie, and have brought us up to see him again.\"  \"You have disarranged my white tie, Niece,\" Mr. Tufton said, extricating himself from Kate's embrace.  \"Niece Mary, I fear that you have not taught your daughters to restrain their emotions, and there is nothing so dreadful as emotional women.\"  \"Perhaps I have not taken so much pains with their education, in that way, as in some others,\" Mrs. Marryat said, smiling. \"But of course, Uncle, if you object to be kissed, the girls will abstain from doing so.\"  \"No,\" Mr. Tufton said, thoughtfully. \"It is the duty of nieces to kiss their uncles, in moderation--in moderation, mind--and it is the duty of the uncles to receive those salutations, and I do not know that the duty is altogether an unpleasant one. I am, myself, unaccustomed to be kissed, but it is an operation to which I may accustom myself, in time.\"  \"I never heard it called an operation, Uncle,\" Lizzie said demurely; \"but I now understand the meaning of the phrase of a man's undergoing a painful operation. I used to think it meant cutting off a leg, or something of that sort, but I see it's much worse.\"  Her uncle looked at her steadily.  \"I am afraid, Grandniece, that you intend to be sarcastic. This is a hateful habit in a man, worse in a woman. Cure yourself of it as speedily as possible, or Heaven help the unhappy man who may some day be your husband.  \"And now,\" he said, \"ring the bell. The housekeeper will show you to your rooms. My nephew will tell you what are the hours for meals. Of course, you will want to be gadding about with him.

But he had too good a start, and in a few moments he had distanced them by climbing a rail fence and disappearing into a thicket that came down to the edge of a field.  \"No use!\" said Paul, disgustedly.  \"He got away from us.  But I don't suppose it would have done us any good to catch him.  We couldn't have done anything--hello!\"  He ended with an exclamation of surprise, and stooped over.  They were at the foot of the fence the flying figure had climbed a moment before.  \"What is it, Paul?\" asked Arthur, eagerly.  \"This!\" said Paul.  He held up a small black pocket-book, and from it he took a package of papers, wrapped in oil silk.  \"I struck against it with my foot!  I wonder if that man who was running could have dropped it?\"  It was almost dark by this time; too dark, at any rate, for them to be able to see the papers.  But then Arthur remembered the pocket flashlight he carried and produced it, switching on the light.  \"Let's have a look,\" he said.  They unwrapped the oil silk covering.  And, at the first sight of what was within it, they gasped.  They were holding in their hands a complete sketch of the fort of Boncelles, the most important of the works defending Liege to the southwest.  Before they could examine it more fully there was a shout from the fence.  The spy had missed his papers.  They saw him for a moment.  But now it was their turn to run.     CHAPTER II  THE MARKED PLANS  The fierce shouting of the man as he called on them to stop did not terrify either of the scouts, but it did confirm Paul's guess.  There could no longer be any doubt that his presence meant mischief; that he was indeed a spy.  Or else why should he have such papers?  Why, again, should their loss so greatly disturb him?  There was not a chance for him to catch them.  Well as he might know the country, they knew it better.  They had played in these fields and woods since they had been able to walk at all.  Every hollow, every ridge, every tree, almost, was familiar to them.  Circling about, they soon reached the garden of their summer home, a fine, spacious house, with ample grounds surrounding it, that belonged to their Uncle Henri de Frenard, whose wealth was derived from his considerable holdings of coal land around Liege.  \"Did you get a good look at him, Paul?\" gasped Arthur, when at last they felt that it was safe for them to stop running.  \"I couldn't really make sure of him--\"  \"I think I'll know him again, Arthur.  What I'm wondering is if he'll know us.\"  \"I don't see what difference that makes, except that if he saw us before we saw him, it would give him a chance to escape--\"  \"We're more likely to be trying to escape from him than he from us, I'm afraid, Arthur, for a little while.  If the Germans are spying as openly as all that, it must mean that they're getting ready to come into Belgium.  They wouldn't take such chances unless they felt that it didn't make any difference now.\"  \"Don't you think we could find him, Paul?  If we could, we could have him arrested, I think.\"  \"Don't say a word--yet,\" cautioned Paul.  \"Uncle Henri would only laugh at us.  Let's wait until we can look at his papers, and see what there really is there besides the sketch of Fort Boncelles.  If that's all there was in the papers, I don't see why he was so awfully anxious to get them back.  Perhaps we've done even better than we know, Arthur.\"  \"All right, I won't say anything,\" said Arthur.  \"But you are going to do something about it, aren't you, Paul?\"  Paul laughed.  He knew that Arthur was a little disappointed at the idea of having to keep what they had done secret, especially as he had probably rehearsed already the astonishment with which all those at the dinner table would greet the startling announcement of the discovery of the spy.  \"I certainly hope we're going to do something about it, Arthur,\" he said.  \"We'll slip away from the table as soon as we can, and then when we're alone, we'll see exactly what it is we've got.\"  But at the table there was a great surprise for them.  Their uncle (though they both called him uncle the relationship was not really so close) was not in his accustomed seat, and Madame de Frenard's eyes were suspiciously red.  She had been crying.  \"Uncle Henri may not be back for two or three days,\" she said, gravely. \"He is a member of parliament, as you know, and he has been called to Brussels on account--on account of what we all hope may not come.\"  \"War?\" asked Arthur, in a hushed voice.  \"It looks terribly as if war must come,\" she said.  \"And if it does, I am afraid our poor Belgium must suffer as well as the lands that are really concerned.  We have done nothing; we want nothing except to be left alone.  If they will only do that!  But I am afraid we must not hope for that.  Your uncle expects to join the army at once if there is an invasion.\"  \"Then we'll stay here and look after you,\" proposed Arthur, promptly. \"Won't we, Paul?\"  \"For as long as we are needed,\" Paul said, gravely.  It was easy enough for them to cut their dinner short that night.  The house was uneasy, stirring with a strange foreboding of what was to come.  Servants, everyone, indeed, seemed to look always toward the east.  There were the Germans.  Often during the summer they drove to Aix-la-Chapelle, the first city over the German border--Aachen, as the Germans called it.  Paul remembered, with a smile, as he thought of the German city, how indignant he had been when he had first discovered that the Germans invariably spoke of Liege as Luttich, and how he had been appeased when he was told that he and most people outside of Germany refused to adopt the German name for Aix-la-Chapelle.  No one in the house, least of all their aunt, had time that night to think of the two boys.  As a matter of fact, it was that now famous Saturday upon which Germany finally cast the die by declaring war upon Russia in the interest of her Austrian ally, whose quarrel with Servia she thus made her own.  France, as the ally of Russia, was bound to fight Germany.  Belgium lay between the two huge powers on either side of her, well-nigh certain to be caught in the disaster that war meant. But the news that war had actually been declared had not yet come. Madame de Frenard was waiting with the utmost anxiety for a telephone message from her husband in Brussels, who had promised to send her word as soon as there were any important developments.  And so Paul and Arthur slipped out to the garage, which was a favorite hiding place.  Now it was especially safe, since Marcel, the chauffeur, had gone to Brussels with their uncle, and there was no likelihood of any unwelcome interruptions.  They repaired, therefore, to the room above the one in which their uncle's automobile was kept, and spread out the papers they had captured from the German spy.  First there was the sketch they had already seen of the Boncelles fort; then, equally detailed, they found sketches and maps of the other forts--Flemalle, Embourg, Chaudfontaine, Fleron, Evegnee, Pontisse, Liers, Lanlin, Longin and Hollogne--the great chain of detached forts that made Liege, in the opinion of military engineers, one of the strongest fortified towns in Europe.  These forts were not immediately in the town; they were about five miles, on an average, from the old citadel, long since disused as a place for actual fighting.  The connections between the various forts, intended, as both boys knew, for the greater facility of their defence by means of troops fighting more or less independently, were carefully traced on another map, in which the contour of the land and the natural shelter were shown.  And on this map, at certain spots, there were strange marks--well beyond the perimeter of the forts themselves, that is, outside the line that might be drawn around Liege and passing through each of the forts.  \"Look at those crosses,\" said Paul.  \"What do you suppose they mean, Arthur?\"  \"I don't know,\" said Arthur, frowning.  \"But we can find out, you know.\"  \"You mean by going to one or two of these places?  They're some distance off.\"  \"But we ought to find out--don't you think so?\"  \"Yes, you're right, of course.  We can find them easily enough.\"  \"Yes.  All we've got to do is to take the map along with us.  Then when we get near we can make sure by looking at it.\"  \"We could do that, but I think we won't, Arthur.  Suppose we ran into the man it belongs to again?  We might not get away from him another time, and I think it would be just as well to leave these maps here. We can hide them, and then write a note and leave it where it will be found in the morning, telling them where we hid the maps.\"  \"What's the use of hiding them if we tell some one where they are, Paul?\"  \"Can't you see?  Suppose something happens to us, so that we can't get back?  We'd want the maps to be found and taken to the commander of the forts, wouldn't we?\"  \"Of course.  I didn't think of that, that's all.  But if we come back we can get the note back before anyone sees it.  Is that what you mean, Paul?\"  \"Yes.  Now study that map very carefully.  I think we can remember where the cross marks are, all right.\"  \"I can remember this one,\" said Arthur.  \"It's exactly on the spot where that new house was built last summer, near the Ourthe.  Don't you remember?  We stopped and got some milk there, and we wondered how a farmer could build such a solid looking house when he didn't seem to have much money or much of anything else.  A stupid fellow, he was.  He scarcely knew enough to give us the milk we wanted.\"  \"Yes, I remember now,\" said Paul, looking at the map again.  He was thinking hard, trying to fathom the connection between what they both remembered of that house and the strange, significant cross on the map. There was a connection; the cross did have some significance.  Of so much he was sure.  But for the life of him that was all he could guess. It was a perplexing problem. "]]]
