Lulu woke early the next morning and was dressed and on deck before any other of the _Dolphin's_ passengers. Day had dawned and the eastern sky was bright with purple, orange, and gold, heralding the near approach of the sun which, just as she set her foot on the deck, suddenly showed his face above the restless waves, making a golden pathway across them.  \"Oh, how beautiful!\" was her involuntary exclamation. Then catching sight of her father standing with his back toward her, and apparently absorbed in gazing upon the sunrise, she hastened to his side, caught his hand in hers, and carried it to her lips with a glad, \"Good-morning, you dear papa.\"  \"Ah! good-morning, my darling,\" he returned, bending down to press a kiss on the bright, upturned face.  \"Such a lovely morning, papa, isn't it?\" she said, standing with her hand fast clasped in his, but turning her eyes again upon sea and sky. \"But where are we now? Almost at Fortress Monroe?\"  \"Look and tell me what you see,\" was his smiling rejoinder, as, with a hand on each of her shoulders, he turned her about so that she caught the view from the other side of the vessel.  \"O papa, is that it?\" she exclaimed. \"Why, we're almost there, aren't we?\"  \"Yes; we will reach our anchorage within a few minutes.\"  \"Oh, are we going to stop to see the old fort, papa?\" she asked eagerly.  \"I think we are,\" was his smiling rejoinder. \"But you don't expect to find in it a relic of the Revolution, do you?\" he asked laughingly, pinching her cheek, then bending down to kiss again the rosy face upturned to his.  \"Why yes, papa; I have been thinking there must have been a fight there. Wasn't that the case?\"  \"No, daughter; the fortress was not there at that time.\"  \"Was it in the war of 1812-14, then, papa?\"  \"No,\" he returned, smiling down on her. \"The building of Fortress Monroe was not begun until 1817. However, there was a small fort built on Point Comfort in 1630; also, shortly before the siege of Yorktown, Count De Grasse had some fortifications thrown up to protect his troops in landing to take part in that affair.\"  But just then the talk was interrupted by the coming on deck of one after another of their party and the exchange of morning greetings; then followed the interest and excitement of the approach to the fortress and anchoring in its vicinity.  Next came the call to breakfast. But naturally, and quite to Lulu's satisfaction, the talk at the table turned upon the building of the fort, its history and that of the adjacent country, particularly Hampton, two and a half miles distant.  The captain pointed it out to them all as they stood upon the deck shortly afterward.  \"Which is Old Point Comfort, papa?\" asked Grace.  \"That sandy promontory on the extremity of which stands Fortress Monroe,\" he answered. \"Yonder, on the opposite side, is Point Willoughhy, the two forming the mouth of the James River; and these are the Rip Raps between the two. You see that there the ocean tides and the currents of the river meet and cause a constant ripple. There is a narrow channel of deep water through the bar, but elsewhere between the capes it is shallow.  \"Beyond the Rip Raps we see the spacious harbor which is called Hampton Roads. It is so large that great navies might ride there together.\"  \"And I think some have ridden there in our wars with England?\" remarked Rosie, half inquiringly.  \"You are quite right,\" replied the captain; \"that happened in both the Revolution and the last war with England.  \"In October, 1775, Lord Dunmore, the British governor of Virginia,--who had, however, abdicated some months earlier by fleeing on board a man-of-war, the _Fowey_,--driven by his fears, and his desire for revenge, to destroy the property of the patriots, sent Captain Squires, of the British navy, with six tenders, into Hampton Creek.  \"He reached there before the arrival of Colonel Woodford--who, with a hundred Culpepper men, had been sent to protect the people of Hampton--and sent armed men in boats to burn the town; protecting them by a furious cannonade from the guns of the tenders.  \"But they were baffled in the carrying out of their design; being driven off by Virginia riflemen, concealed in the houses. Excellent marksmen those Virginians were, and picked off so many of the advancing foe that they compelled them to take ignominious flight to their boats and return to the vessels, which then had to withdraw beyond the reach of the rifles to await reinforcements.\"  \"What is a tender, papa?\" asked Grace, as her father paused in his narrative.  \"A small vessel that attends on a larger one to convey intelligence and supply stores,\" he replied; then went on with his account of Dunmore's repulse.  \"Woodford and his men reached Hampton about daybreak of the succeeding morning. At sunrise they saw the hostile fleet approaching; it came so near as to be within rifle shot, and Woodford bade his men fire with caution, taking sure aim. They obeyed and picked off so many from every part of the vessels that the seamen were soon seized with a great terror. The cannons were silenced,--the men who worked them being shot down,--and their commander presently ordered a retreat; but that was difficult to accomplish, for any one seen at the helm, or aloft, adjusting the sails, was sure to become a target for the sharpshooters; in consequence many of the sailors retreated to the holds of the vessels, and when their commander ordered them out on the dangerous duty, refused to obey.  \"The victory for the Americans was complete; before the fleet could escape, the Hampton people, with Woodford and his soldiers, had sunk five vessels.\"  \"And such a victory!\" exclaimed Rosie, in an exultant tone.  \"Yes,\" the captain said, smiling at her enthusiasm.  \"Were the houses they fired on the very ones that are there now, papa?\" asked Lulu.  \"Some few of them,\" he replied. \"Nearly all were burned by Magruder in the Civil War; among them St. John's Episcopal Church, which was built probably about 1700. Before the Revolution it bore the royal arms carved upon its steeple; but soon after the Declaration of Independence--so it is said--that steeple was struck by lightning and those badges of royalty were hurled to the ground.\"  \"Just as the country was shaking off the yoke they represented,\" laughed Rosie. \"A good omen, wasn't it, Brother Levis?\"  \"So it would seem, viewed in the light of after events,\" he answered with a smile.  \"Papa, can't we visit Hampton?\" asked Lulu eagerly.  \"Yes, if you would all like to do so,\" was the reply, in an indulgent tone and with an inquiring glance at the older members of the party.  Everyone seemed to think it would be a pleasant little excursion, especially as the _Dolphin_ would carry them all the way to the town; but first they must visit the fortress. They did not, however, set out thither immediately, but remained on deck a little longer gazing about and questioning the captain in regard to the points of interest.  \"Papa,\" asked Grace, pointing in a southerly direction, \"is that another fort yonder?\"  \"Yes,\" he replied, \"that is Fort Wool. It is a mile distant, and with Fortress Monroe defends Hampton Roads, the Gosport navy yard, and Norfolk.\"  \"They both have soldiers in them?\" she said inquiringly.  \"Yes, daughter; both contain barracks for soldiers, and Fortress Monroe has also an arsenal, a United States school of artillery, chapel, and, besides the barracks for the soldiers, storehouses and other buildings, and covers eighty acres of ground.\"  \"And when was it finished, papa? How long did it take to build it?\"  \"It is not finished yet,\" he answered, \"and has already cost nearly three million dollars. It is an irregular hexagon--that is has six sides and six angles--surrounded by a tide-water ditch eight feet deep at high water.\"  \"I see trees and flower gardens, papa,\" she remarked.  \"Yes,\" he said, \"there are a good many trees, standing singly and in groves. The flower gardens belong to the officers' quarters. Now, if you will make yourselves ready for the trip, ladies, Mr. Dinsmore, and any of you younger ones who care to go,\" he added, smoothing Grace's golden curls with caressing hand and smiling down into her face, \"we will take a nearer view.\"  No one felt disposed to decline the invitation and they were soon on their way to the fortress.  It did not take very long to look at all they cared to see; then they returned to their vessel, weighed anchor, and passed through the narrow channel of the Rip Raps into the spacious harbor of Hampton Roads.  It was a lovely day and all were on deck, enjoying the breeze and the prospect on both land and water.  \"Papa,\" said Lulu, \"you haven't told us yet what happened here in the last war with England.\"  \"No,\" he said. \"They attacked Hampton by both land and water, a force of two thousand five hundred men under General Beckwith landing at Old Point Comfort, and marching from there against the town, while at the same time Admiral Cockburn assailed it from the water.  \"The fortification at Hampton was but slight and guarded by only four hundred and fifty militiamen. Feeling themselves too weak to repel an attack by such overwhelming odds, they retired, and the town was given up to pillage.\"  \"Didn't they do any fighting at all, papa?\" asked Lulu in a tone of regret and mortification. \"I know Americans often did fight when their numbers were very much smaller than those of the enemy.\"  \"That is quite true,\" he said, with a gleam of patriotic pride in his eye, \"and sometimes won the victory in spite of the odds against them. That thing had happened only a few days previously at Craney Island, and the British were doubtless smarting under a sense of humiliating defeat when they proceeded to the attack of Hampton.\"  \"How many of the British were there, Captain?\" asked Evelyn Leland. \"I have forgotten, though I know they far outnumbered the Americans.\"  \"Yes,\" he replied, \"as I have said there were"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18065"],["title","Transactions of the American Society of Civil Engineers, Vol. LXVIII, Sept. 1910 (#1)"],["body","over the tunnel excavation, passing thence eastward a short distance south of 32d Street, which it recrossed near Third Avenue, and finally discharging into the East River near 34th Street, and a little west of the present First Avenue. The ancient creek apparently followed the course of a valley in the rock, the valley having become filled to a considerable depth with very fine quicksand. This concurrence of depressions in the rock surface with the watercourse shown on Viele's map was noted in so many places and the difficulties of construction were so serious at these places, that a section of the map showing the old topography along and adjacent to the station and tunnel lines is reproduced in Plate IX.  [Illustration: PLATE XI.--Long Island Shaft. Lines _A_ and _B_]  The unfavorable conditions developed at Fifth Avenue affected both the construction of the tunnels and the maintenance of adjacent buildings. It would be necessary to construct the tunnels in open cut for a large part of the way westward, causing serious inconvenience to the public; the buildings were mostly of the older class, founded in earth, but there were several modern high buildings with foundations in the same material; some of these had been built since the tunnels were planned. In view of these added risks and the increased cost of construction, the value of the three-track construction was reconsidered, and two important changes were made in the plans. The first of these was to continue the twin tunnel westward to Sixth Avenue in 32d Street, and to a point 180 ft. west of Sixth Avenue in 33d Street; the twin tunnel being 9-1/2 ft. less in height than the three-track tunnel and 9 ft. narrower, the change reduced the difficulties considerably. Where the three-track tunnel was thus eliminated, there was no longer objection to a steeper grade, so that, going eastward from the station, a grade of 0.8% in 33d Street and 0.9% in 32d Street was substituted for the original 0.4% grade. From the west line of Fifth Avenue eastward short sections with descending grades of 0.3% connect with the original 1.5% grade near Madison Avenue. The effect of these two changes--type of tunnel and grade--was to lower the roof of the tunnels at Fifth Avenue about 15 ft., which made it practicable to avoid open cutting east of Sixth Avenue.  A full account of the construction of the cross-town tunnels will be given by the Resident Engineers.  Permanent shafts were made on both sides of the East River, those in Manhattan being located a few feet east of First Avenue, and those in Long Island City being located, one in the so-called Annex Slip, the other in the pier just south of it. The two railroad lines coming from 32d Street in Manhattan, and curving to the left at Second Avenue, are about 34 ft. apart between centers at First Avenue, and it was convenient to make the shaft large enough to cover both lines. Borings had shown that the excavation for the tunnels would break out of the rock about 200 ft. east of First Avenue. It was desirable to carry the tunnel excavation eastward from the shaft in normal air far enough to permit of building at least 50 ft. of tunnel and installing air-locks, so that compressed air might be available when the rock surface was broken through. The location adopted, and shown on Plate XIII, had the further advantages that the rock surface was several feet above the level of the top of the tunnels, and access to the river for receiving and discharging materials could be had without crossing any street. Similar reasons governed the location of the north shaft for the lines from 33d Street. On the Long Island side of the river there were only two feasible locations meeting these conditions, particularly in respect to a safe thickness of rock above the tunnels, one near the pierhead line, the other just outside the bulkhead line, and for many minor reasons the latter was preferable. The center lines of each pair of tunnels were 37 ft. apart, and each shaft, therefore, was made to cross both lines of a pair, the same as on Manhattan side of the river. It was not expected, however, that the Long Island shafts could be built conveniently or the tunnels begun from them in normal air.  The decision to make the shafts of permanent construction was based not only on the desirability of having access to and egress from the tunnels near the banks of the river for convenience of the workmen or exit for passengers in case of accident, but to facilitate ventilation; these locations divide the entire lengths of tunnels east of the station into three parts, two of which were approximately 4,000 ft. each, and the other about 5,500 ft. The accident risk was believed to be very small, while much weight was given to the feature of facilitating ventilation. Further studies have enhanced the importance attached to ventilation, and it is now intended to provide appliances for mechanical ventilation at all shafts. The plans of the shafts are shown on Plates X and XI. The caissons for the shafts are of structural steel, with double walls, filled between with concrete, including a cross-wall between and parallel to the tunnels. All these structures were fitted for sinking with compressed air, if that should prove necessary.  Although borings had shown that rock would be found at all the shaft sites several feet above the tunnel level, it could not be determined in advance of excavation whether the caissons would have to be sunk to full depth; if sound, unfissured rock were found, the sinking could be stopped above the tunnel level; but, if not, the caissons, in any case, would have to be sunk far enough to permit placing a water-tight floor below the tunnels, and the tunnels themselves begun through openings in the side-walls of the caisson; such openings, therefore, closed by removable bulkheads, were provided in all caissons.  [Illustration: PLATE XII.--Typical Tunnel Sections]  As already stated, the grade of 1.5% from Fifth Avenue eastward was fixed with reference to the lowest point of the river bed in order to give the requisite cover over the tunnels at the deepest point of the channel on the west side of the reef, where the river bottom was about 60 ft. below mean high tide for a short distance. On the other hand, as the use of compressed air in building the tunnels was anticipated, an excessive depth below the water surface was to be avoided as far as possible; it was necessary, however, to continue the descending grade some further distance until the tunnels were mostly in rock, so that drainage sumps under the tunnels could be made readily. Eastward from the sumps the tunnels had a rising grade of 0.7% to the established bulkhead line on the Long Island side, giving a cover at the points where the tunnels enter rock, a short distance westward, of about 10 ft. (if the dredging plane should be fixed at some future time at 40 ft. below mean low tide, as may be reasonably anticipated). Eastward from the bulkhead line, Tunnels _A_, _B_, and _D_ have ascending grades of about 1.25%, while Tunnel _C_ rises at the rate of 1.9% in order to effect a crossing over Tunnel _B_ west of the portals. This feature was introduced in order to place the two west-bound tracks together through the Sunnyside Yard, and the heavier grade, being downward with the traffic, was not objectionable.  The arrangement of grades and tracks in the approaches and in Sunnyside Yard would require the introduction of too much detail to be taken up here, but will be dealt with in the paper on the Sunnyside Yard.  It was recognized from the inception of the project that the tunnels under the East River would be the most difficult and expensive section of the East River Division. The borings had shown a great variety of materials to be passed through, embracing quicksand, coarse sand, gravel, boulders, and bed-rock, as well as some clayey materials. (See Plate XIII.) The rock was usually covered by a few feet of sand, gravel, and boulders intermixed, but, in some places, where the rock surface was at some distance below the tunnel grade, the material met in tunneling was all quicksand; the nearest parallels in work previously done were some of the tunnels under the Thames, particularly the Blackwall tunnel, where open gravel was passed through. Before the plans for the East River tunnels were completed, work had been resumed, after many years' interruption, in the old Hudson River tunnels between 15th Street, Jersey City, and Morton Street, Manhattan, and sand materials were passed through for a short distance. These experiences satisfied nearly all the engineers in any way connected with the work that the shield method was the most suitable for the East River tunnels, and the plans for the work were based on its adoption. (See Plate XII for cross-sections, etc.) Other methods, as stated by General Raymond in the introductory paper, were advocated, particularly caisson constructions and the freezing process, the latter being urged very strongly, and, when proposals were invited, in October, 1903, bidders were informed that alternative methods would be taken into consideration.  Bids were received and opened on December 15th, 1903. Only one bidder proposed to carry out the work on the basis of unit prices, but the prices were so low that the acceptance of the proposal was deemed inadmissible; no bid based on caisson methods was received; several offers were made to perform the work by the shield method, in accordance with the plans, for a percentage of its cost, and one was submitted, on a similar basis, covering the use of the freezing method. The firm of S. Pearson and Son, Limited, of London, England, submitted a proposal for building the tunnels by the shield method, on a modification of the percentage basis, and as this firm had built the Blackwall tunnel within the estimates of cost and was the only bidder having such an experience and record in work in any way similar to"]]]
