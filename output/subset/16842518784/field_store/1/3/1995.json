But, about three centuries afterwards, the Law decided that in all towns containing a population above ten thousand, the angle of a Pentagon was the smallest house-angle that could be allowed consistently with the public safety.  The good sense of the community has seconded the efforts of the Legislature; and now, even in the country, the pentagonal construction has superseded every other.  It is only now and then in some very remote and backward agricultural district that an antiquarian may still discover a square house.     Section 3.  Concerning the Inhabitants of Flatland    The greatest length or breadth of a full grown inhabitant of Flatland may be estimated at about eleven of your inches.  Twelve inches may be regarded as a maximum.  Our Women are Straight Lines.  Our Soldiers and Lowest Classes of Workmen are Triangles with two equal sides, each about eleven inches long, and a base or third side so short (often not exceeding half an inch) that they form at their vertices a very sharp and formidable angle.  Indeed when their bases are of the most degraded type (not more than the eighth part of an inch in size), they can hardly be distinguished from Straight Lines or Women; so extremely pointed are their vertices.  With us, as with you, these Triangles are distinguished from others by being called Isosceles; and by this name I shall refer to them in the following pages.  Our Middle Class consists of Equilateral or Equal-Sided Triangles.  Our Professional Men and Gentlemen are Squares (to which class I myself belong) and Five-Sided Figures or Pentagons.  Next above these come the Nobility, of whom there are several degrees, beginning at Six-Sided Figures, or Hexagons, and from thence rising in the number of their sides till they receive the honourable title of Polygonal, or many-sided.  Finally when the number of the sides becomes so numerous, and the sides themselves so small, that the figure cannot be distinguished from a circle, he is included in the Circular or Priestly order; and this is the highest class of all.  It is a Law of Nature with us that a male child shall have one more side than his father, so that each generation shall rise (as a rule) one step in the scale of development and nobility.  Thus the son of a Square is a Pentagon; the son of a Pentagon, a Hexagon; and so on.  But this rule applies not always to the Tradesmen, and still less often to the Soldiers, and to the Workmen; who indeed can hardly be said to deserve the name of human Figures, since they have not all their sides equal.  With them therefore the Law of Nature does not hold; and the son of an Isosceles (i.e. a Triangle with two sides equal) remains Isosceles still.  Nevertheless, all hope is not shut out, even from the Isosceles, that his posterity may ultimately rise above his degraded condition.  For, after a long series of military successes, or diligent and skilful labours, it is generally found that the more intelligent among the Artisan and Soldier classes manifest a slight increase of their third side or base, and a shrinkage of the two other sides. Intermarriages (arranged by the Priests) between the sons and daughters of these more intellectual members of the lower classes generally result in an offspring approximating still more to the type of the Equal-Sided Triangle.  Rarely--in proportion to the vast numbers of Isosceles births--is a genuine and certifiable Equal-Sided Triangle produced from Isosceles parents.  [Note:  \"What need of a certificate?\" a Spaceland critic may ask:  \"Is not the procreation of a Square Son a certificate from Nature herself, proving the Equal-sidedness of the Father?\"  I reply that no Lady of any position will marry an uncertified Triangle.  Square offspring has sometimes resulted from a slightly Irregular Triangle; but in almost every such case the Irregularity of the first generation is visited on the third; which either fails to attain the Pentagonal rank, or relapses to the Triangular.]  Such a birth requires, as its antecedents, not only a series of carefully arranged intermarriages, but also a long, continued exercise of frugality and self-control on the part of the would-be ancestors of the coming Equilateral, and a patient, systematic, and continuous development of the Isosceles intellect through many generations.  The birth of a True Equilateral Triangle from Isosceles parents is the subject of rejoicing in our country for many furlongs around.  After a strict examination conducted by the Sanitary and Social Board, the infant, if certified as Regular, is with solemn ceremonial admitted into the class of Equilaterals.  He is then immediately taken from his proud yet sorrowing parents and adopted by some childless Equilateral, who is bound by oath never to permit the child henceforth to enter his former home or so much as to look upon his relations again, for fear lest the freshly developed organism may, by force of unconscious imitation, fall back again into his hereditary level.  The occasional emergence of an Equilateral from the ranks of his serf-born ancestors is welcomed, not only by the poor serfs themselves, as a gleam of light and hope shed upon the monotonous squalor of their existence, but also by the Aristocracy at large; for all the higher classes are well aware that these rare phenomena, while they do little or nothing to vulgarize their own privileges, serve as a most useful barrier against revolution from below.  Had the acute-angled rabble been all, without exception, absolutely destitute of hope and of ambition, they might have found leaders in some of their many seditious outbreaks, so able as to render their superior numbers and strength too much even for the wisdom of the Circles.  But a wise ordinance of Nature has decreed that, in proportion as the working-classes increase in intelligence, knowledge, and all virtue, in that same proportion their acute angle (which makes them physically terrible) shall increase also and approximate to the comparatively harmless angle of the Equilateral Triangle.  Thus, in the most brutal and formidable of the soldier class--creatures almost on a level with women in their lack of intelligence--it is found that, as they wax in the mental ability necessary to employ their tremendous penetrating power to advantage, so do they wane in the power of penetration itself.  How admirable is this Law of Compensation!  And how perfect a proof of the natural fitness and, I may almost say, the divine origin of the aristocratic constitution of the States in Flatland!  By a judicious use of this Law of Nature, the Polygons and Circles are almost always able to stifle sedition in its very cradle, taking advantage of the irrepressible and boundless hopefulness of the human mind.  Art also comes to the aid of Law and Order.  It is generally found possible--by a little artificial compression or expansion on the part of the State physicians--to make some of the more intelligent leaders of a rebellion perfectly Regular, and to admit them at once into the privileged classes; a much larger number, who are still below the standard, allured by the prospect of being ultimately ennobled, are induced to enter the State Hospitals, where they are kept in honourable confinement for life; one or two alone of the more obstinate, foolish, and hopelessly irregular are led to execution.  Then the wretched rabble of the Isosceles, planless and leaderless, are either transfixed without resistance by the small body of their brethren whom the Chief Circle keeps in pay for emergencies of this kind; or else more often, by means of jealousies and suspicions skilfully fomented among them by the Circular party, they are stirred to mutual warfare, and perish by one another's angles.  No less than one hundred and twenty rebellions are recorded in our annals, besides minor outbreaks numbered at two hundred and thirty-five; and they have all ended thus.     Section 4.  Concerning the Women    If our highly pointed Triangles of the Soldier class are formidable, it may be readily inferred that far more formidable are our Women.  For if a Soldier is a wedge, a Woman is a needle; being, so to speak, ALL point, at least at the two extremities.  Add to this the power of making herself practically invisible at will, and you will perceive that a Female, in Flatland, is a creature by no means to be trifled with.  But here, perhaps, some of my younger Readers may ask HOW a woman in Flatland can make herself invisible.  This ought, I think, to be apparent without any explanation.  However, a few words will make it clear to the most unreflecting.  Place a needle on a table.  Then, with your eye on the level of the table, look at it side-ways, and you see the whole length of it; but look at it end-ways, and you see nothing but a point, it has become practically invisible.  Just so is it with one of our Women.  When her side is turned towards us, we see her as a straight line; when the end containing her eye or mouth--for with us these two organs are identical--is the part that meets our eye, then we see nothing but a highly lustrous point; but when the back is presented to our view, then--being only sub-lustrous, and, indeed, almost as dim as an inanimate object--her hinder extremity serves her as a kind of Invisible Cap.

I made one mistake--that of fear--and in committing one error, I shouldered every blame.  It makes little difference now. I am dead--and free.  My love to you, my son.  I hope that wealth and happiness await you. Blood of my blood flows in your veins--and strange though it may sound to you--it is the blood of an adventurer.  I can almost see you smile at that!  An old man who sat by the window, staring out; afraid of every knock at the door--and yet an adventurer!  But they say, once in the blood, it never dies.  My wish is that you succeed where I failed--and God be with you!  Your father.   For a long moment Robert Fairchild stood staring at the letter, his heart pounding with excitement, his hands grasping the foolscap paper as though with a desire to tear through the shield which the written words had formed about a mysterious past and disclose that which was so effectively hidden.  So much had the letter told--and yet so little! Dark had been the hints of some mysterious, intangible thing, great enough in its horror and its far-reaching consequences to cause death for one who had known of it and a living panic for him who had perpetrated it.  As for the man who stood now with the letter clenched before him, there was promise of wealth, and the threat of sorrow, the hope of happiness, yet the foreboding omen of discoveries which might ruin the life of the reader as the existence of the writer had been blasted,--until death had brought relief.  Of all this had the letter told, but when Robert Fairchild read it again in the hope of something tangible, something that might give even a clue to the reason for it all, there was nothing.  In that super-calmness which accompanies great agitation, Fairchild folded the paper, placed it in its envelope, then slipped it into an inside pocket.  A few steps and he was before the safe once more and reaching for the second envelope.  Heavy and bulky was this, filled with tax receipts, with plats and blueprints and the reports of surveyors.  Here was an assay slip, bearing figures and notations which Robert Fairchild could not understand.  Here a receipt for money received, here a vari-colored map with lines and figures and conglomerate designs which Fairchild believed must relate in some manner to the location of a mining camp; all were aged and worn at the edges, giving evidence of having been carried, at some far time of the past, in a wallet.  More receipts, more blueprints, then a legal document, sealed and stamped, and bearing the words:     County of Clear Creek,  )  ss.   State of Colorado.      )  DEED PATENT.  KNOW ALL MEN BY THESE PRESENTS: That on this day of our Lord, February 22, 1892, Thornton W. Fairchild, having presented the necessary affidavits and statements of assessments accomplished in accordance with--   On it trailed in endless legal phraseology, telling in muddled, attorney-like language, the fact that the law had been fulfilled in its requirements, and that the claim for which Thornton Fairchild had worked was rightfully his, forever.  A longer statement full of figures, of diagrams and surveyor's calculations which Fairchild could neither decipher nor understand, gave the location, the town site and the property included within the granted rights.  It was something for an attorney, such as Beamish, to interpret, and Fairchild reached for the age-yellowed envelope to return the papers to their resting place. But he checked his motion involuntarily and for a moment held the envelope before him, staring at it with wide eyes.  Then, as though to free by the stronger light of the window the haunting thing which faced him, he rose and hurried across the room, to better light, only to find it had not been imagination; the words still were before him, a sentence written in faint, faded ink proclaiming the contents to be \"Papers relating to the Blue Poppy Mine\", and written across this a word in the bolder, harsher strokes of a man under stress of emotion, a word which held the eyes of Robert Fairchild fixed and staring, a word which spelled books of the past and evil threats of the future, the single, ominous word:  \"Accursed!\"     CHAPTER II  One works quickly when prodded by the pique of curiosity.  And in spite of all that omens could foretell, in spite of the dull, gloomy life which had done its best to fashion a matter-of-fact brain for Robert Fairchild, one sentence in that letter had found an echo, had started a pulsating something within him that he never before had known:  \"--It is the blood of an adventurer.\"  And it seemed that Robert Fairchild needed no more than the knowledge to feel the tingle of it; the old house suddenly became stuffy and prison-like as he wandered through it.  Within his pocket were two envelopes filled with threats of the future, defying him to advance and fight it out,--whatever _it_ might be.  Again and again pounded through his head the fact that only a night of travel intervened between Indianapolis and St. Louis; within twelve hours he could be in the office of Henry Beamish.  And then--  A hurried resolution.  A hasty packing of a traveling bag and the cashing of a check at the cigar store down on the corner.  A wakeful night while the train clattered along upon its journey.  Then morning and walking of streets until office hours.  At last:  \"I 'm Robert Fairchild,\" he said, as he faced a white-haired, Cupid-faced man in the rather dingy offices of the Princess Building. A slow smile spread over the pudgy features of the genial appearing attorney, and he waved a fat hand toward the office's extra chair.  \"Sit down, Son,\" came casually.  \"Need n't have announced yourself.  I 'd have known you--just like your father, Boy.  How is he?\"  Then his face suddenly sobered.  \"I 'm afraid your presence is the answer.  Am I right?\"  Fairchild nodded gravely.  The old attorney slowly placed his fat hands together, peaking the fingers, and stared out of the window to the grimy roof and signboards of the next building.  \"Perhaps it's better so,\" he said at last.  \"We had n't seen each other in ten years--not since I went up to Indianapolis to have my last talk with him.  Did he get any cheerier before--he went?\"  \"No.\"  \"Just the same, huh?  Always waiting?\"  \"Afraid of every step on the veranda, of every knock at the door.\"  Again the attorney stared out of the window.  \"And you?\"  \"I?\"  Fairchild leaned forward in his chair.  \"I don't understand.\"  \"Are you afraid?\"  \"Of what?\"  The lawyer smiled.  \"I don't know.  Only--\" and he leaned forward--\"it's just as though I were living my younger days over this morning.  It doesn't seem any time at all since your father was sitting just about where you are now, and gad, Boy, how much you look like he looked that morning!  The same gray-blue, earnest eyes, the same dark hair, the same strong shoulders, and good, manly chin, the same build--and look of determination about him.  The call of adventure was in his blood, and he sat there all enthusiastic, telling me what he intended doing and asking my advice--although he would n't have followed it if I had given it.  Back home was a baby and the woman he loved, and out West was sudden wealth, waiting for the right man to come along and find it.  Gad!\" White-haired old Beamish chuckled with the memory of it.  \"He almost made me throw over the law business that morning and go out adventuring with him!  Then four years later,\" the tone changed suddenly, \"he came back.\"  \"What then?\"  Fairchild was on the edge of his chair.  But Beamish only spread his hands.  \"Truthfully, Boy, I don't know.  I have guessed--but I won't tell you what.  All I know is that your father found what he was looking for and was on the point of achieving his every dream, when something happened. Then three men simply disappeared from the mining camp, announcing that they had failed and were going to hunt new diggings.  That was all. One of them was your father--\"  \"But you said that he 'd found--\"  \"Silver, running twenty ounces to the ton on an eight-inch vein which gave evidences of being only the beginning of a bonanza!  I know, because he had written me that, a month before.\"  \"And he abandoned it?\"  \"He 'd forgotten what he had written when I saw him again.  I did n't question him.  I did n't want to--his face told me enough to guess that I would n't learn.  He went home then, after giving me enough money to pay the taxes on the mine for the next twenty years, simply as his attorney and without divulging his whereabouts.  I did it.  Eight years or so later, I saw him in Indianapolis.  He gave me more money--enough for eleven or twelve years--\"  \"And that was ten years ago?\" Robert Fairchild's eyes were reminiscent. \"I remember--I was only a kid.  He sold off everything he had, except the house.\"  Henry Beamish walked to his safe and fumbled there a moment, to return at last with a few slips of paper.  \"Here 's the answer,\" he said quietly, \"the taxes are paid until 1922.\"  Robert Fairchild studied the receipts carefully--futilely.  They told him nothing.  The lawyer stood looking down upon him; at last he laid a hand on his shoulder.  \"Boy,\" came quietly, \"I know just about what you 're thinking.  I 've spent a few hours at the same kind of a job myself, and I 've called old Henry Beamish more kinds of a fool than you can think of for not coming right out flat-footed and making Thornton tell me the whole story.  But some way, when I 'd look into those eyes with the fire all dead and ashen within them, and see the lines of an old man in his young face, I--well, I guess I 'm too soft-hearted to make folks suffer.  I just couldn't do it!\"  \"So you can tell me nothing?\"  \"I 'm afraid that's true--in one way.  In another I 'm a fund of information.  To-night you and I will go to Indianapolis and probate the will--it's simple enough; I 've had it in my safe for ten years. After that, you become the owner of the Blue Poppy mine, to"]]]
