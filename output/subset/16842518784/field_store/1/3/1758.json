Then, with a bound, he set off!  \"Come on, Petrie!\" he cried. \"There they are!\"  Vaulting a railing he went away over a field like a madman. Recovering from the shock of surprise, I followed him, but he was well ahead of me, and making for some vaguely seen objects moving against the lights of the roadway.  Another railing was vaulted, and the corner of a second, triangular grass patch crossed at a hot sprint. We were twenty yards from the road when the sound of a starting motor broke the silence. We gained the gravelled footpath only to see the tail-light of the car dwindling to the north!  Smith leant dizzily against a tree.  \"Eltham is in that car!\" he gasped. \"Just God! are we to stand here and see him taken away to--?\"  He beat his fist upon the tree, in a sort of tragic despair. The nearest cab-rank was no great distance away, but, excluding the possibility of no cab being there, it might, for all practicable purposes, as well have been a mile off.  The beat of the retreating motor was scarcely audible; the lights might but just be distinguished. Then, coming in an opposite direction, appeared the headlamp of another car, of a car that raced nearer and nearer to us, so that, within a few seconds of its first appearance, we found ourselves bathed in the beam of its headlights.  Smith bounded out into the road, and stood, a weird silhouette, with upraised arms, fully in its course!  The brakes were applied hurriedly. It was a big limousine, and its driver swerved perilously in avoiding Smith and nearly ran into me. But, the breathless moment past, the car was pulled up, head on to the railings; and a man in evening clothes was demanding excitedly what had happened. Smith, a hatless, dishevelled figure, stepped up to the door.  \"My name is Nayland Smith,\" he said rapidly--\"Burmese Commissioner.\" He snatched a letter from his pocket and thrust it into the hands of the bewildered man. \"Read that. It is signed by another Commissioner--the Commissioner of Police.\"  With amazement written all over him, the other obeyed.  \"You see,\" continued my friend tersely, \"it is _carte blanche_. I wish to commandeer your car, sir, on a matter of life and death!\"  The other returned the letter.  \"Allow me to offer it!\" he said, descending. \"My man will take your orders. I can finish my journey by cab. I am--\"  But Smith did not wait to learn whom he might be.  \"Quick!\" he cried to the stupefied chauffeur. \"You passed a car a minute ago--yonder. Can you overtake it?\"  \"I can try, sir, if I don't lose her track.\"  Smith leapt in, pulling me after him.  \"Do it!\" he snapped. \"There are no speed limits for me. Thanks! Good night, sir!\"  We were off! The car swung around and the chase commenced.  One last glimpse I had of the man we had dispossessed, standing alone by the roadside, and at ever-increasing speed, we leapt away in the track of Eltham's captors.  Smith was too highly excited for ordinary conversation, but he threw out short, staccato remarks.  \"I have followed Fu-Manchu from Hong-Kong,\" he jerked. \"Lost him at Suez. He got here a boat ahead of me. Eltham has been corresponding with some mandarin up-country. Knew that. Came straight to you. Only got in this evening. He--Fu-Manchu--has been sent here to get Eltham. My God! and he has him! He will question him! The interior of China--a seething pot, Petrie! They had to stop the leakage of information. _He_ is here for that.\"  The car pulled up with a jerk that pitched me out of my seat, and the chauffeur leapt to the road and ran ahead. Smith was out in a trice, as the man, who had run up to a constable, came racing back.  \"Jump in, sir--jump in!\" he cried, his eyes bright with the lust of the chase; \"they are making for Battersea!\"  And we were off again.  Through the empty streets we roared on. A place of gasometers and desolate waste lots slipped behind and we were in a narrow way where gates of yards and a few lowly houses faced upon a prospect of high blank wall.  \"Thames on our right,\" said Smith, peering ahead. \"His rathole is by the river as usual. _Hi_!\"--he grabbed up the speaking-tube--\"Stop! Stop!\"  The limousine swung into the narrow sidewalk, and pulled up close by a yard gate. I, too, had seen our quarry--a long, low-bodied car, showing no inside lights. It had turned the next corner, where a street lamp shone greenly not a hundred yards ahead.  Smith leapt out, and I followed him.  \"That must be a cul-de-sac,\" he said, and turned to the eager-eyed chauffeur. \"Run back to that last turning,\" he ordered, \"and wait there, out of sight. Bring the car up when you hear a police-whistle.\"  The man looked disappointed, but did not question the order. As he began to back away, Smith grasped me by the arm and drew me forward.  \"We must get to that corner,\" he said, \"and see where the car stands, without showing ourselves.\"     CHAPTER III  THE WIRE JACKET   I suppose we were not more than a dozen paces from the lamp when we heard the thudding of the motor. The car was backing out!  It was a desperate moment, for it seemed that we could not fail to be discovered. Nayland Smith began to look about him, feverishly, for a hiding place, a quest which I seconded with equal anxiety. And Fate was kind to us--doubly kind as after events revealed. A wooden gate broke the expanse of wall hard by upon the right, and, as the result of some recent accident, a ragged gap had been torn in the panels close to the top.  The chain of the padlock hung loosely; and in a second Smith was up, with his foot in this as in a stirrup. He threw his arm over the top and drew himself upright. A second later he was astride the broken gate.  \"Up you come, Petrie!\" he said, and reached down his hand to aid me.  I got my foot into the loop of chain, grasped at a projection in the gate-post, and found myself up.  \"There is a crossbar, on this side to stand on,\" said Smith.  He climbed over and vanished in the darkness. I was still astride the broken gate when the car turned the corner, slowly, for there was scanty room; but I was standing upon the bar on the inside and had my head below the gap ere the driver could possibly have seen me.  \"Stay where you are until he passes,\" hissed my companion, below. \"There is a row of kegs under you.\"  The sound of the motor passing outside grew loud--louder--then began to die away. I felt about with my left foot, discerned the top of a keg, and dropped, panting, beside Smith.  \"Phew!\" I said--\"that was a close thing! Smith--how do we know--?\"  \"That we have followed the right car?\" he interrupted. \"Ask yourself the question: what would any ordinary man be doing motoring in a place like this at two o'clock in the morning?\"  \"You are right, Smith,\" I agreed. \"Shall we get out again?\"  \"Not yet. I have an idea. Look yonder.\"  He grasped my arm, turning me in the desired direction.  Beyond a great expanse of unbroken darkness a ray of moonlight slanted into the place wherein we stood, spilling its cold radiance upon rows of kegs.  \"That's another door,\" continued my friend. I now began dimly to perceive him beside me. \"If my calculations are not entirely wrong, it opens on a wharf gate--\"  A steam siren hooted dismally, apparently from quite close at hand.  \"I'm right!\" snapped Smith. \"That turning leads down to the gate. Come on, Petrie!\"  He directed the light of the electric torch upon a narrow path through the ranks of casks, and led the way to the farther door. A good two feet of moonlight showed along the top. I heard Smith straining; then--  \"These kegs are all loaded with grease,\" he said, \"and I want to reconnoitre over that door.\"  \"I am leaning on a crate which seems easy to move,\" I reported. \"Yes, it's empty. Lend a hand.\"  We grasped the empty crate, and, between us, set it up on a solid pedestal of casks. Then Smith mounted to this observation platform and I scrambled up beside him, and looked down upon the lane outside.  It terminated as Smith had foreseen at a wharf gate some six feet to the right of our post. Piled up in the lane beneath us, against the warehouse door, was a stack of empty casks. Beyond, over the way, was a kind of ramshackle building that had possibly been a dwelling-house at some time. Bills were stuck in the ground-floor windows indicating that the three floors were to let as offices; so much was discernible in that reflected moonlight.  I could hear the tide lapping upon the wharf, could feel the chill from the near river and hear the vague noises which, night nor day, never cease upon the great commercial waterway.  \"Down!\" whispered Smith. \"Make no noise! I suspected it. They heard the car following!\"  I obeyed, clutching at him for support; for I was suddenly dizzy, and my heart was leaping wildly--furiously.  \"You saw her?\" he whispered.  Saw her! Yes, I had seen her! And my poor dream-world was toppling about me, its cities ashes and its fairness dust.  Peering from the window, her great eyes wondrous in the moonlight and her red lips parted, hair gleaming like burnished foam and her anxious gaze set upon the corner of the lane--was Kâramanèh ... Kâramanèh whom once we had rescued from the house of this fiendish Chinese doctor; Kâramanèh who had been our ally, in fruitless quest of whom,--when, too late, I realized how empty my life was become--I had wasted what little of the world's goods I possessed:--Kâramanèh!  \"Poor old Petrie,\" murmured Smith. \"I knew, but I hadn't the heart--_He_ has her again--God knows by what chains he holds her. But she's only a woman, old boy, and women are very much alike--very much alike from Charing Cross to Pagoda Road.\"  He rested his hand on my shoulder for a moment; I am ashamed to confess that I was trembling; then, clenching my teeth with that mechanical physical effort which often accompanies a mental one, I swallowed the bitter draught of Nayland Smith's philosophy. He was raising "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19143"],["title","Correggio (#1)"],["body","art giving sketches of Correggio's life and work are Kugler's \"Handbook of the Italian Schools,\" revised by A. H. Layard, and Mrs. Jameson's \"Early Italian Painters,\" revised by Estelle M. Hurll.  For a critical estimate of the art of Correggio a chapter in Burckhardt's \"Cicerone\" is interesting reading, but the book is out of print and available only in large libraries. In \"Italian Cities,\" by E. H. and E. W. Blashfield, a delightful chapter on Parma describes Correggio's works and analyzes his art methods. Morelli's \"Italian Painters\" contains in various places some exceedingly important contributions to the criticism of Correggio's works. The author's repudiation of the authenticity of the Reading Magdalen of the Dresden Gallery has been accepted by all subsequent writers.  Comments on Correggio are found in Symonds's volume on \"The Fine Arts\" in the series \"The Renaissance in Italy,\" and are also scattered through the pages of Ruskin's \"Modern Painters\" and Hazlitt's \"Essays on the Fine Arts.\" The volume on Correggio in the series \"Great Masters in Painting and Sculpture\" is valuable chiefly for a complete list of Correggio's works. The text is based on Ricci.[3]  [Footnote 3: As this book goes to press Bernard Berenson's \"The Study and Criticism of Italian Art\" makes its appearance.

I  THE HOLY NIGHT (LA NOTTE) (Detail)   In the northern part of Italy is the little town of Correggio, which gave its name to the painter whose works we are to study. His real name was Antonio Allegri, but in the sixteenth century a man would often be called by a nickname referring to some peculiarity, or to his birthplace. When Allegri went to Parma he was known as Antonio da Correggio, that is, Antonio from Correggio, and the name was then shortened to Correggio.  A large part of Correggio's work was mural decoration, painted on the surface of the plastered wall. Besides such frescoes he painted many separate pictures, mostly of sacred subjects to be hung over the altars of churches. The choice of subjects was much more limited in his day than now, and, with the exception of a few mythological paintings, all Correggio's themes were religious. The subject most often called for was that of the Madonna and Child. Madonna is the word, meaning literally My Lady, used by the Italians when speaking of Mary, the mother of Jesus. The Madonna and Child is then a picture of the mother Mary holding the Christ-child.  Our illustration is from such a picture called \"La Notte,\" the Italian for The Night. The night meant by the title is that on which Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judæa. It was at a time known in history as the Augustan Age, when Rome was the great world-power. Judæa was only an obscure province of the vast Roman Empire, but here was the origin of the influence which was to shape later history. The coming of Jesus brought a new force into the world.  The story of his infancy has been made familiar by the four Evangelists. He was born in surroundings which, in Roman eyes, were fit only for slaves. Mary and Joseph had come up from their own home to Bethlehem to pay the taxes exacted at Rome. The town was full of people on the same errand, and \"there was no room for them in the inn.\" So it came about that the new-born babe was wrapped in swaddling clothes and laid in a manger used for feeding cattle.  While he lay in this strange cradle his birth was made known by a vision of angels to some shepherds on the neighboring hillsides. At once they betook themselves joyfully to Bethlehem, the first to do honor to the new-born king. These homely visitors are gathered about the manger in Correggio's picture. The dark night is without, but a dazzling white light shines from the Holy Child.  [Illustration: THE HOLY NIGHT (DETAIL) _Dresden Gallery_]  Our illustration shows only the centre of the picture, where the mother leans over her babe. The little form lies on a bundle of hay, completely encircled by her arms. The bend of her elbow makes a soft pillow for his head; her hands hold him fast in the snug nest.
