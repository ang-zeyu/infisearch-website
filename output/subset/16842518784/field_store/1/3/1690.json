At hair-splitting she could give the Idiot points.  \"I am surprised that Mary should have thought I wanted more coffee,\" continued the Idiot, in an aggrieved tone. \"It shows that she too thinks me out of my mind.\"  \"You are not out of your mind,\" said the Bibliomaniac. \"It would be a good thing if you were. In replenishing your mental supply you might have the luck to get better quality.\"  \"I probably should have the luck,\" said the Idiot. \"I have had a great store of it in my life. From the very start I have had luck. When I think that I was born myself, and not you, I feel as if I had had more than my share of good-fortune--more luck than the law allows. How much luck does the law allow, Mr. Brief?\"  \"Bosh!\" said Mr. Brief, with a scornful wave of his hand, as if he were ridding himself of a troublesome gnat. \"Don't bother me with such mind-withering questions.\"  \"All right,\" said the Idiot. \"I'll ask you an easier one. Why does not the world recognize matrimony?\"  Mr. Whitechoker started. Here, indeed, was a novel proposition.  \"I--I--must confess,\" said he, \"that of all the idiotic questions I--er--I have ever had the honor of hearing asked that takes the--\"  \"Cake?\" suggested the Idiot.  \"--palm!\" said Mr. Whitechoker, severely.  \"Well, perhaps so,\" said the Idiot. \"But matrimony is the science, or the art, or whatever you call it, of making two people one, is it not?\"  \"It certainly is,\" said Mr. Whitechoker. \"But what of it?\"  \"The world does not recognize the unity,\" said the Idiot. \"Take our good proprietors, for instance. They were made one by yourself, Mr. Whitechoker. I had the pleasure of being an usher at the ceremony, yielding the position of best man gracefully, as is my wont, to the Bibliomaniac. He was best man, but not the better man, by a simple process of reasoning. Now no one at this board disputes that Mr. and Mrs. Pedagog are one, but how about the world? Mr. Pedagog takes Mrs. Pedagog to a concert. Are they one there?\"  \"Why not?\" asked Mr. Brief.  \"That's what I want to know--why not? The world, as represented by the ticket-taker at the door, says they are not--or implies that they are not, by demanding tickets for two. They attempt to travel out to Niagara Falls. The railroad people charge them two fares; the hackman charges them two fares; the hotel bills are made out for two people. It is the same wherever they go in the world, and I regret to say that even in our own home there is a disposition to regard them as two. When I spoke of there being nine persons here instead of ten, Mr. Whitechoker himself disputed my point--and yet it was not so much his fault as the fault of Mr. and Mrs. Pedagog themselves. Mrs. Pedagog seems to cast doubt upon the unity by providing two separate chairs for the two halves that make up the charming entirety. Two cups are provided for their coffee. Two forks, two knives, two spoons, two portions of all the delicacies of the season which are lavished upon us out of season--generally after it--fall to their lot. They do not object to being called a happy _couple_, when they should be known as a happy single. Now what I want to know is why the world does not accept the shrinkage which has been pronounced valid by the church and is recognized by the individual? Can any one here tell me that?\"  [Illustration: \"DEMANDS TICKETS FOR TWO\"]  No one could, apparently. At least no one endeavored to. The Idiot looked inquiringly at all, and then, receiving no reply to his question, he rose from the table.  \"I think,\" he said, as he started to leave the room--\"I think we ought to write that book. If we made it up of the things you people don't know, it would be one of the greatest books of the century. At any rate, it would be great enough in bulk to fill the biggest library in America.\"     III   \"I wish I were beginning life all over again,\" said the Idiot one spring morning, as he took his accustomed place at Mrs. Pedagog's table.  \"I wish you were,\" said Mr. Pedagog from behind his newspaper. \"Then your parents would have you shut up in a nursery, and it is even conceivable that you would be receiving those disciplinary attentions with a slipper that you seem to me so frequently to deserve, were you at this present moment in the nursery stage of your development.\"  \"My!\" ejaculated the Idiot. \"What a wonder you are, Mr. Pedagog! It is a good thing you are not a justice in a criminal court.\"  \"And what, may I venture to ask,\" said Mr. Pedagog, glancing at the Idiot over his spectacles--\"what has given rise to that extraordinary remark, the connection of which with anything that has been said or done this morning is distinctly not apparent?\"  \"I only meant that a man who was so given over to long sentences as you are would probably make too severe a judge in a criminal court,\" replied the Idiot, meekly. \"Do you make use of the same phraseology in the class-room that you dazzle us with, I should like to know?\"  \"And why not, pray?\" said Mr. Pedagog.  \"No special reason,\" said the Idiot; \"only it does seem to me that an instructor of youth ought to be more careful in his choice of adverbs than you appear to be. Of course Doctor Bolus here is under no obligation to speak more grammatically or correctly than he does. People call him in to prescribe, not to indulge in rhetorical periods, and he can write his prescriptions in a sort of intuitive Latin and nobody be the wiser, but you, who are said to be sowing the seeds of knowledge in the brain of youth, should be more careful.\"  \"Hear the grammarian talk!\" returned Mr. Pedagog. \"Listen to this embryonic Samuel Johnson the Second. What have I said that so offends the linguistic taste of Lindley Murray, Jun.?\"  \"Nothing,\" returned the Idiot. \"I cannot say that you have said anything. I never heard you say anything in my life; but while you can no doubt find good authority for making use of the words 'distinctly not apparent,' you ought not to throw such phrases around carelessly. The thing which is distinct is apparent, therefore to say 'distinctly not apparent' to a mind that is not given to analysis sounds strange. You might as well say of a beautiful girl that she is plainly pretty, meaning of course that she is evidently pretty; but those who are unacquainted with the idiomatic peculiarities of your speech might ask you if you meant that she was pretty in a plain sort of way. Suppose, too, you were writing a novel, and, in a desire to give your reader a fair idea of the personal appearance of a homely but good creature, you should say, 'It cannot be denied that Rosamond Follansbee was pretty plain?' It wouldn't take a very grave error of the types to change your entire meaning. To save a line on a page, for instance, it might become necessary to eliminate a single word; and if that word should chance to be the word 'plain' in the sentence I have given, your homely but good person would be set down as being undeniably pretty. Which shows, it seems to me, that too great care cannot be exercised in the making of selections from our vocabu--\"  \"You are the worst I _ever_ knew!\" snapped Mr. Pedagog.  \"Which only proves,\" observed the Idiot, \"that you have not heeded the Scriptural injunction that you should know thyself. Are those buckwheat cakes or doilies?\"  Whether the question was heard or not is not known. It certainly was not answered, and silence reigned for a few minutes. Finally Mrs. Pedagog spoke, and in the manner of one who was somewhat embarrassed. \"I am in an embarrassing position,\" said she.  \"Good!\" said the Idiot, _sotto-voce_, to the genial gentleman who occasionally imbibed. \"There is hope for the landlady yet. If she can be embarrassed she is still human--a condition I was beginning to think she wotted not of.\"  \"She whatted what?\" queried the genial gentleman, not quite catching the Idiot's words.  \"Never mind,\" returned the Idiot. \"Let's hear how she ever came to be embarrassed.\"  \"I have had an application for my first-floor suite, and I don't know whether I ought to accept it or not,\" said the landlady.  \"She has a conscience, too,\" whispered the Idiot; and then he added, aloud, \"And wherein lies the difficulty, Mrs. Pedagog?\"  \"The applicant is an actor; Junius Brutus Davenport is his name.\"  \"A tragedian or a comedian?\" asked the Bibliomaniac.  \"Or first walking gentleman, who knows every railroad tie in the country?\" put in the Idiot.  \"That I do not know,\" returned the landlady. \"His name sounds familiar enough, though. I thought perhaps some of you gentlemen might know of him.\"  \"I have heard of Junius Brutus,\" observed the Doctor, chuckling slightly at his own humor, \"and I've heard of Davenport, but Junius Brutus Davenport is a combination with which I am not familiar.\"  \"Well, I can't see why it should make any difference whether the man is a tragedian, or a comedian, or a familiar figure to railroad men,\" said Mr. Whitechoker, firmly. \"In any event, he would be an extremely objec--\"  \"It makes a great deal of difference,\" said the Idiot. \"I've met tragedians, and I've met comedians, and I've met New York Central stars, and I can assure you they each represent a distinct type. The tragedians, as a rule, are quiet meek individuals, with soft low voices, in private life. They are more timid than otherwise, though essentially amiable. I knew a tragedian once who, after killing seventeen Indians, a road-agent, and a gross of cowboys between eight and ten P.M. every night for sixteen weeks, working six nights a week, was afraid of a mild little soft-shell crab that lay defenceless on a plate before him on the evening of the seventh night of the last week. Tragedians make agreeable companions, I can tell you; and if J. Brutus Davenport is a tragedian, I think Mrs. Pedagog would do well to let him have the suite, provided, of course, that he pays for it in advance.\"  \"I was about to observe, when our friend interrupted me,\" said Mr."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18884"],["title","Ducks at a Distance: A Waterfowl Identification Guide (#1)"],["body","weight of their bodies, they have a more rapid wingbeat than puddle ducks.     Canvasback   Length--22 in. Weight--3 lbs.  Normally late to start south, canvasbacks migrate in lines and irregular V's.  In feeding areas, compact flocks fly in indefinite formations. Their wingbeat is rapid and noisy; their speed is the swiftest of all our ducks.  Feeding behavior is highly variable. In some areas they feed at night and spend the day rafted up in open waters; in other areas they feed inshore mornings and evenings.  On the water, body size and head shape distinguish them from scaups and redheads.  Drakes _croak_, _peep_, and _growl_; hens have a mallard-like _quack_.     Redheads   Length--20 in. Weight--2½ lbs.  Range coast to coast, with the largest numbers in the Central Flyway. Migratory flocks travel in V's; move in irregular formations over feeding areas. Often found associating with canvasback.  In the air, they give the impression of always being in a hurry.  Usually spend the day in large rafts in deep water; feed morning and evening in shallower sections.  Drakes _purr_ and _meow_; hens have a loud _squak_, higher than a hen mallard's.     Ringneck   Length--17 in. Weight--2½ lbs.  Similar in appearance to scaups, but more often found in fresh marshes and wooded ponds. In flight, the dark wings are different from the white-edged wings of scaup.  Faint brown ring on drake's neck never shows in the field; light bands at tip and base of bill are conspicuous.  Fly as small flocks in open formation; often land without circling. Drakes _purr_; hens are usually silent.     Scaup   Greater--Length--18½ in.          Weight--2 lbs.  Lesser--Length--17 in.         Weight--1-7/8 lbs.  Except for the wing marks, greater and lesser scaup appear nearly identical in the field.  The light band near the trailing edges of the wings runs almost to the tip in the greater scaup, but only about half way in the lesser.  Greater scaup prefer large open water areas; lesser scaup often use marshes and ponds.  Both species migrate late, sometimes just before freezeup.  Flock movements are rapid, often erratic, usually in compact groups.  Hens are silent; drake lesser scaup _purr_; drake greater scaup have a discordant _scaup, scaup_.     Goldeneye   Common--Length--19 in.         Weight--2¼ lbs.  Barrow's--Length--19 in.           Weight--2¾ lbs.  These are active, strong-winged fliers moving singly or in small flocks, often high in the air. Distinctive wing-whistling sound in flight has earned the name of whistlers.  Goldeneyes generally move south late in the season; most of them winter on coastal waters and the Great Lakes. Inland, they like rapids and fast water.  Barrow's goldeneye, predominantly a Westerner, is less wary than the common goldeneye.  Hens of both species are look-alikes.  Drakes have a piercing _speer-speer_--hens a low _quack_. Both are usually quiet.     Bufflehead   Length--14½ in. Weight--1 lb.  Stragglers migrate south in mid-fall, but the largest numbers move just ahead of freezeup. Most flocks in feeding areas are small--5 or 6 birds, with more hens and immatures than adult drakes.  Very small size, bold black and white color pattern, and low, swift flight are field marks. Unlike most divers, they can fly straight up from a watery takeoff.  Largest concentrations are on both seacoasts and along the Gulf of Mexico. Inland, they will remain as far north as open water permits.  Usually silent. Drakes _squeak_ and have a guttural note; hens _quack_ weakly.     Ruddy   Length--15½ in. Weight--1-1/3 lbs.  The ruddy duck often dives or swims away from danger rather than flying. When flying, their small wings stroke so fast they resemble bumblebees.  They are early to mid-fall migrants.  Drakes often cock their tails upright at an angle, the only species to habitually do so.  Both hens and drakes are silent in the fall.     Red-Breasted Merganser   Length--23 in. Weight--2½ lbs.  These birds winter most abundantly in coastal waters, including the Gulf of Mexico, and to a lesser extent, the Great Lakes.  Their flight, strong and direct, is usually low over the water. They are difficult to distinguish in flight from the common merganser.  Voice: Seldom heard.     Common Merganser   Length--25½ in. Weight--2½ lbs.  This species is larger than the red-breasted merganser, and is one of the largest of our ducks. It is one of the last to migrate south, and is more common than the red-breasted merganser on inland waters.  Flocks move in \"follow the leader\" style, low over the water.  The only call seems to be a startled _croak_.     Hooded Merganser   Length--18 in. Weight--1½ lbs.  Often seen in pairs, or very small flocks. Short rapid wingstrokes create an impression of great speed.  Winters in the inland waters of all coastal States; seldom goes to salt water.  Voice: Seldom heard in fall.     Whistling Ducks   Length--18-19 in. Weight--1¾ lbs.  The trailing legs and rounded wings of these slow flying ducks makes them look bigger than they are.  Both species are primarily Mexican. In the U.S., the black-bellied is found only in south Texas and Louisiana. The fulvous also occurs there and in Florida with occasional stragglers further north along both coasts and the Mississippi Valley. The fulvous is the more common of the two species in the United States.  Sexes are alike. Both species have shrill whistling calls.     White-Winged Scoter   Length--21½ in. Weight--3½ lbs.  The three scoters on these two pages are sea ducks, wintering on open coastal waters. White-wings are among the heaviest and largest of all ducks.     Surf Scoter   Length--19½ in. Weight--2 lbs.  Like all scoters, these birds move along our coasts in loose flocks, stringing into irregular, wavy lines. Drakes can be distinguished from other scoters by two white patches on their head and the bright color of the bill.  Flight is strong, direct, usually close to the waves.     Black Scoter   Length--19½ in. Weight--2½ lbs.  In flight, drakes appear all black except for the flash of the slight gray underwing and the bright yellow swelling at the base of the upper bill.  Scoters feed on mollusks, crabs, and some fish and very little vegetation. They are locally known as \"coots.\"     Common Eider   Length--23½ in. Weight--5 lbs.  Thick-necked stocky birds, alternately flapping and sailing in flight; flocks string out in a line, close to the water. Occurs in the United States chiefly along New England coasts and occasionally south to New Jersey.  Other eiders--king, spectacled and Stellar's--occur in Alaska and are not pictured in this guide. King eiders occasionally are found in north Atlantic coastal waters.     Oldsquaw   Length--20½ in. Weight--2 lbs.  A slim, brightly plumaged sea duck. Smaller than the scoters or eiders.  Flight is swift and low with constantly changing flock formations. Ranges along both coasts and the Great Lakes.  One of the most vocal of ducks; drakes have a loud pleasant _caloo, caloo_, constantly heard.     Harlequin   Length--17 in. Weight--1½ lbs.  Glossy slate-blue plumage enlivened by white stripes and spots give the adult male harlequin a striking appearance. The female resembles a small female scoter. At a distance, both sexes look black. Flight is swift, with abrupt turns. Flocks are small and compact. Ranges both coasts, north from New Jersey and San Francisco. Uncommon.     Swans   Trumpeter--Length--59 in.            Weight--28 lbs.  Whistling--Length--52 in.            Weight--16 lbs.  Once thought to be rare, trumpeter swans are slowly increasing in Alaska and on western refuges and parks.  Whistling swans are common and increasing. They winter near Chesapeake Bay, San Francisco Bay, Puget Sound and Salton Sea. Occasionally found in fields.  Both species are large with pure white plumage.     Canada Geese   Numerous and popular, Canada geese are often called \"honkers.\" Includes several races varying in weight from 3 to over 12 pounds. All have black heads and necks, white cheeks, similar habitats and voices. Sexes are identical.     Brant   Length--24-25 in. Weight--3¼ - 3¾ lbs.  These are sea geese, the blacks wintering south to Baja, California, in the Pacific. The Atlantic race winters from Virginia northward. Flight is swift, in irregular and changing flock patterns.     Snow Geese   Length--29-31 in. Weight--6½-7½ lbs.  Two races of snow geese are recognized: greater snows along the Atlantic Coast, and lesser snows elsewhere on the continent. Blue geese are a color phase of the lesser snow.     White-Fronted Geese   Length--29 in. Weight--6¼ lbs.  Migrates chiefly in the Central and Pacific flyways but also present in the Mississippi. Rare in the Atlantic Flyway. Appears brownish gray at a distance. Often called \"specklebelly\".  Most distinctive characteristic of the V-shaped flocks is the high pitched call _kow-kow-kow-kow_.     COMPARATIVE SIZES OF WATERFOWL   All birds on these pages are drawn to the same scale.     Wetlands Attract Wildlife   There's more than just ducks in our marshes. Knowing and identifying other birds and animals add to the enjoyment of being in a blind.  The same sources of food and shelter that draw waterfowl to ponds and marshes also attract other forms of wildlife.  Protected species are sometimes more numerous than ducks or geese.  Money from Duck Stamp sales is used exclusively to purchase wetlands, preserving areas for ducks, geese, and all wildlife for the enjoyment and pleasure of hunters and non-hunters alike.     Administrative Waterfowl Flyways   Waterfowl Flyways  The term \"flyway\" has long been used to designate the migration routes of birds. For management purposes, four waterfowl flyways--Pacific, Central, Mississippi, and Atlantic--were established in the United States in 1948. To varying degrees the waterfowl populations using each of these flyways differ in abundance, species composition, migration pathways, and breeding ground origin. There are differences, also, "]]]
