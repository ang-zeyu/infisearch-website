And it was an hour, that time, before Twinkleheels would let Johnnie come near him.  But that was a mistake.  One day Johnnie Green was in a great hurry. He was going to ride over the hill, to play with some friends. Running to the barn, he caught up Twinkleheels' halter and snatched the four-quart measure off the top of a barrel.  \"I won't stop to take any oats to-day,\" Johnnie said to himself. \"I'll fool Twinkleheels. It will be a good joke on him when he puts his nose into the measure and finds it empty.\"  Johnnie Green hurried to the pasture. At his first whistle Twinkleheels pricked up his ears. He had come to think only of one thing when that whistle sounded in the pasture. That one thing was _oats_. And now Twinkleheels squealed and kicked and tore down the hillside to the bars, where Johnnie Green stood and waved the grain measure in the air.  Twinkleheels had long since given up stopping to listen for the swish of the oats inside the measure. He came trotting up to Johnnie and reached his head out for the treat that he had always found waiting for him.  He thrust his nose into the measure. There was something wrong. He blew into the measure. Then he snorted and drew back. And if Johnnie Green hadn't been spry Twinkleheels would have given him the slip.  But Johnnie grabbed him and had the halter on him in a twinkling.  \"I fooled you this time,\" said Johnnie as he turned to let down the pasture bars.  Twinkleheels hung his head.     IV  THE CHEATER CHEATED   Johnnie Green thought he had done something quite clever. He had coaxed Twinkleheels up to him in the pasture with an empty grain measure.  Twinkleheels, however, had his own ideas about the matter.  \"This boy,\" he said to old dog Spot, \"has cheated me.\"  Spot lay on the barn floor, looking on while Johnnie Green harnessed Twinkleheels.  \"This boy,\" Twinkleheels explained, \"made me think he had some oats for me. He caught me unfairly.\"  Old dog Spot grinned. \"Can't you take a joke?\" he asked.  \"This is no joke,\" Twinkleheels grumbled. \"Johnnie is going to drive me over the hill. They're going to have a ball game over there. And you know folks are always in a hurry when they're going to a ball game--especially boys. And they're in the most terrible hurry of all when somebody else has to get them there. If Johnny Green had to walk, maybe he'd think there was time to stop and rest now and then.\"  Old Spot recalled the day when he followed Twinkleheels to the village and back.  \"I don't see what you're grumbling about,\" he remarked. \"I've run behind your little buggy and you kept snapping the miles off as if it was the easiest thing you did.\"  \"_You'd_ grumble yourself if you were cheated of a taste of oats that you were expecting,\" said Twinkleheels.  \"I never eat oats,\" Spot retorted.  \"Then you don't know what's good,\" Twinkleheels declared. \"After getting your mouth all made up for oats, it's pretty disappointing to chew on nothing more appetizing than an iron bit.\"  Old dog Spot snickered.  Twinkleheels stamped one of his tiny feet upon the barn floor.  \"It will never happen again!\" he cried.  Old Spot gave him a sharp look.  \"I hope,\" he said, \"you don't intend to hurt Johnnie Green. I hope you aren't planning to run away with him.\"  \"No!\" Twinkleheels assured him. \"I'm too well trained to run away, though I must say Johnnie Green deserves a spill. But of course I wouldn't do such a thing as to tip the buggy over. What I have in mind is something quite different. It's harmless.\" And that was all he would say.  He took Johnnie Green to the ball game. And he brought him home again. He was so well-behaved that when Johnnie turned him into the pasture, afterward, Johnnie never dreamed that Twinkleheels could be planning any mischief.  The next morning Johnnie took Twinkleheels' halter and the four-quart measure with three big handfuls of oats in it. Then he walked up the lane to the pasture, leaned over the bars and whistled.  Though there was no pony in sight, Twinkleheels soon came strolling out from behind a clump of bushes. He took his own time in picking his way down the hillside, as though he might be glad to keep Johnnie Green waiting.  \"Come on! Come on!\" Johnnie called. \"Come and get your oats!\" And he shook the measure before him.  To his great surprise, Twinkleheels didn't come running up and reach out to get the oats. Instead, he stopped short, with his feet planted squarely under him, as if he didn't intend to budge. Johnnie Green took one step towards him. And then Twinkleheels whisked around and ran. He shook his head and kicked up his heels. And something very like a laugh came floating back to Johnnie Green's ears.  Johnnie followed him all over the pasture. And when the dinner horn sounded at the farmhouse Johnnie had to go home without Twinkleheels.  The afternoon was half gone before Twinkleheels let his young master put the halter on him. By that time Johnnie Green had learned something that he never forgot.  Never again did he cheat Twinkleheels with an empty measure. He knew that Twinkleheels expected fair play, just as much as the boys with whom Johnnie played ball, over the hill.     V  FLYING FEET   When July brought hot, dry weather and the grass became short in the pasture Johnnie Green no longer turned Twinkleheels out to graze. He kept him in a stall in the barn and fed him oats and hay three times a day.  It was at that time that Johnnie Green made an interesting discovery. A row of currant bushes grew behind the barn. And one day when Johnnie stripped off a few stems of the red fruit and stood in the back door of the barn, eating it, he happened to snap a currant at Twinkleheels.  The result both pleased and surprised him. When the currant struck Twinkleheels he laid back his ears, dropped his head, and let fly with both hind feet.  Johnnie Green promptly forgot that he had intended to eat those currants. One by one he threw them at Twinkleheels. It made no difference where they hit the pony. Whenever he felt one, he kicked. Sometimes he kicked only the air; sometimes his feet crashed against the side of his stall.  Throwing currants at Twinkleheels became one of Johnnie Green's favorite sports. Whenever boys from neighboring farms came to play with him, Johnnie was sure to entertain them by taking them out behind the barn to show them how high he could make Twinkleheels kick.  As a mark of special favor, Johnnie would sometimes let his friends flick a few currants at his pet. And sometimes they would even pelt the old horse Ebenezer, who stood in the stall next to Twinkleheels. There was little fun in that, however. Ebenezer refused to kick. The first currant generally brought him out of a doze, with a start. But after that he wouldn't budge, except perhaps to turn his head and look with a bored expression at the boys in the doorway.  Johnnie Green and his friends were not alone in enjoying this sport. Old dog Spot joined them when he could. Unfortunately, when Twinkleheels kicked, old Spot always wanted to bark. And Johnnie didn't like noise at such times. He and his friends were always amazingly quiet when they were engaged in currant throwing behind the barn. And they were always peering about as if they didn't want to be caught there.  \"Run out to the barn and tell your father that dinner's almost ready,\" Mrs. Green said to Johnnie one day.  \"He's not in the barn,\" Johnnie answered.  \"Are you sure?\" Mrs. Green asked. \"I thought I heard him hammering out there a few minutes ago.\"  \"No!\" Johnnie murmured. \"Father's in the hayfield.\"  \"That's queer,\" said his mother. \"I was sure I heard hammering.... Well, blow the horn, then! I don't want dinner to spoil.\"  So Johnnie Green blew several loud blasts on the horn. And he was glad to do it, for it gave him an excuse for having a red face.  He threw no more currants at Twinkleheels that day. Somehow it didn't seem just the wisest thing to do. But the next morning he made Twinkleheels kick a few times. \"It's really good for him,\" Johnnie tried to make himself believe. \"He needs the exercise.\"     VI  PICKING CURRANTS   If there was one sort of work that Johnnie Green had always disliked more than another, it was picking currants. Of course he didn't object to strolling up to a currant bush and taking a few currants for his own use, on the spot. What he hated was having to fill pail after pail full of currants for his mother to make jelly and jam.  It was queer. He certainly liked jelly. And he liked jam. But he had never found currant picking anything but dull. He always groaned aloud when his mother told him that the currants were ripe enough to be picked. And he always had a dozen reasons why he couldn't pick them just then.  Now, however, currant picking didn't seem such a bore to Johnnie. When his mother announced at the supper table one evening that Johnnie would have to begin picking currants right after breakfast the next morning he didn't make a single objection. And he had intended to go swimming the next day!  \"I think--\" Johnnie remarked--\"I think some of the boys would like to help. After supper I'll ride Twinkleheels over the hill and ask the boys to pick currants with me in the morning.\"  Farmer Green and his wife listened to this speech with amazement.  \"I never heard of a boy that liked to pick currants,\" said Johnnie's father. \"Still, you can try if you want to.\"  \"Come home before it gets dark!\" said his mother.  \"Look out for that pony!\" Farmer Green exclaimed. \"I don't know what's come over him. I stepped into his stall to-day and he kicked at me. I've never known him to do that before.\"  Johnnie Green promised to be careful, and to come home early. Having important business on his hands, he hurried away without a second piece of cake. And that was a most unusual oversight on his part.  In the morning three boys appeared before Johnnie had finished his breakfast. Though they had already eaten theirs, they accepted Mrs."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18656"],["title","The Tale of Pony Twinkleheels (#2)"],["body","n's invitation to sit at the table and have some griddlecakes and maple syrup. \"If you boys are going to pick currants you'll want a good, big breakfast,\" she told them.  There was no doubt that they agreed with her.  \"If they're as lively at picking as they are at eating you'll have all the currants in the kitchen by noon,\" Farmer Green remarked to his wife with a laugh as the boys trooped off toward the barn with their tin pails.  A few minutes later a noise as of terrific pounding reached the ears of Farmer Green as he stood talking with his wife.  \"What's that?\" he muttered. \"It sounds as if the barn was falling down.\"  He ran out of doors. The racket came from the barn. There was no doubt of that. And he could hear Spot barking.  Farmer Green hurried across the yard. Somehow he guessed that Johnnie and his helpers had a hand in whatever was going on. Farmer Green did not run toward the broad front door of the barn. Instead he circled to the back of the barn and peeped around the corner. What he saw caused him no great surprise.     VII  CAUGHT!   There was a good deal of giggling and loud whispering at the back door of the barn. It ceased instantly when Farmer Green cried \"Stop that!\" in a loud voice.  Johnnie Green and his friends looked startled--and sheepish, too. They had been throwing currants through the doorway, to make Twinkleheels kick.  The boys fell back a few steps as Farmer Green joined them.  \"Was Twinkleheels doing all that kicking?\" Farmer Green asked Johnnie. \"It was so loud that I thought the barn would fall down any minute.\"  \"We threw a few currants at old Ebenezer,\" Johnnie Green explained somewhat faintly.  His father gave him a sharp look.  \"Huh!\" Farmer Green grunted. \"_He_ didn't kick--did he?\"  \"N-no! N-no, sir!\"  \"Did you throw at the bays?\" Johnnie's father demanded.  \"Only once or twice!\" Johnnie confessed.  \"Once or twice is too much,\" his father said sternly. \"Don't meddle with the bays. And don't tease the pony, either. You've chosen the surest way to make a kicker of him.  \"How long,\" Farmer Green demanded, \"has this business been going on?\"  \"Only a short time!\" Johnnie assured him. \"I never threw any currants until they began to ripen.\"  [Illustration: Twinkleheels Tells Spot About Kicking. (Page 34)]  \"I suppose,\" said his father, \"you never threw any until there were some to throw.\"  Johnnie Green appeared much more cheerful when he heard that remark of his father's. Although Farmer Green's face wore a frown, and his voice sounded most severe, Johnnie could tell that he was laughing, _inside_.  \"Come on!\" Johnnie cried to his friends. \"Let's get to work. If we hustle we can get the currants all picked by noon.\"  So long as Farmer Green stood there they all picked as busily as squirrels. But after he left them the boys found so much to talk about that they made little progress. It was a temptation, too, to flick a currant into the face of another picker and see him jump.  Finally the neighbors' boys announced that they were going swimming. \"Come along over to the swimming hole!\" they urged Johnnie. \"You can finish picking these currants later.\"  But Johnnie Green said that he couldn't leave his work. Though his helpers left him, he stayed behind the barn and picked currants. Somehow he felt that he ought to be on his best behavior--at least for a day or two.  \"It was a pity that Johnnie Green's father caught him,\" old dog Spot remarked to Twinkleheels after Farmer Green put an end to the boys' fun. \"I enjoyed the sport,\" said Spot.  \"If you're so fond of kicking, just step up behind me!\" Twinkleheels urged him.  \"No, thank you!\" said Spot. \"I don't want one of my ribs cracked.\"  \"Ho!\" cried Twinkleheels. \"Who said anything about _one_ rib? I'll crack all of them for you if you'll come where I can reach you.\"  Spot moved further away.  \"Do you mean that?\" he asked in a somewhat frightened voice.  \"Certainly not!\" said Twinkleheels.  \"You kicked at Farmer Green yesterday,\" Spot reminded him.  \"Yes! But I never touched him,\" Twinkleheels answered. \"I only wanted to see him jump.\"     VIII  A GOOD SLEEPER   Twinkleheels' stall was an end one. Next to him stood the old horse Ebenezer; and beyond Ebenezer were the two bays. Twinkleheels often wished that he might have someone for his nearest neighbor that was a bit livelier than Ebenezer. When the old horse stayed in the barn he spent a great deal of his time with his eyes half shut, dozing. If Twinkleheels spoke to him, Ebenezer seldom heard him the first time. And often Ebenezer even fell asleep while Twinkleheels was talking to him.  Twinkleheels always moved smartly. Ebenezer took his time about everything. When anybody backed him between the thills of a wagon he was as slow as Timothy Turtle and no more graceful. And while people harnessed him he usually sighed heavily now and then, because he dreaded being hurried along the road.  Before Twinkleheels came to the farm to live, Johnnie Green had thought it quite a lark to drive or ride Ebenezer. Now, however, Johnnie paid little heed to the old horse. And, to tell the truth, Ebenezer was content to be let alone.  \"This boy must have found it a bit poky, riding you,\" Twinkleheels remarked to Ebenezer one day when he noticed that the old horse was actually wide-awake.  \"He found me safe,\" Ebenezer replied. \"That's why Farmer Green let Johnnie ride me.\"  \"It's a wonder you didn't fall asleep and tumble down and throw Johnnie,\" Twinkleheels said.  \"I'm very sure-footed,\" Ebenezer told him proudly. \"Of course, a person will step on a loose stone now and then. But I've never really stumbled in my whole life.\"  \"How old are you?\" Twinkleheels inquired.  \"I'm twenty,\" Ebenezer told him.  \"And you've never stumbled in all that time!\" Twinkleheels cried. \"How did you manage to stay on your feet like that?\"  \"By minding my business,\" Ebenezer explained with a shrewd glance at his young companion. The answer--and the look--were both lost on Twinkleheels.  \"I heard Farmer Green tell Johnnie to turn me and you into the pasture to-morrow,\" he told Ebenezer.  \"Don't you mean 'you and me'?\" Ebenezer suggested mildly.  \"Well, it's the same thing, isn't it?\" Twinkleheels retorted.  \"There's a slight difference,\" said Ebenezer. \"I see there are some things you've never been taught. Colts were different when I was a yearling.\"  Twinkleheels looked almost angry.  \"I hope,\" he snapped, \"you don't take me for a yearling. Just because I'm a pony--and small--you needn't think I'm an infant. Why, I'm five years old!\"  Old Ebenezer yawned. It seemed as if he was always sleepy.  \"You've a good deal to learn,\" he said. \"When I was five I thought I knew everything.... I still find that I can learn something almost every day.\"  Twinkleheels sniffed. \"I don't believe you've picked up much that was new to-day,\" he said. \"You've been dozing every moment, except when you ate your meals.\"  To his great disgust, Ebenezer gave a sort of snort. He no longer heard anything that his youthful neighbor said.  \"I'll see that he learns something in the pasture to-morrow,\" Twinkleheels promised himself. \"I'll get him to race with me--if he can stay awake long enough. And I'll show him such a burst of speed as he's never seen in all his twenty years.\"     IX  THE RACE   When Johnnie Green turned Twinkleheels and the old horse Ebenezer into the pasture, the first thing they did was to drop down on the grass and enjoy a good roll.  There was a vast difference in their actions. Twinkleheels was as spry as a squirrel. He rolled from one side to the other and back again, jumped up and shook himself like old dog Spot, almost before Ebenezer had picked out a nice, smooth place to roll on.  Ebenezer bent his legs beneath him in a gingerly fashion and sank with something like a sigh upon the green, grassy carpet. It was only with a great effort that he managed at last to roll all the way over; and then he couldn't roll back again. Clumsily he flung his fore feet in front of himself and by a mighty heave pulled himself off the ground.  \"Slow, isn't he?\" Twinkleheels remarked to the Muley Cow, who was chewing her cud and looking on.  \"He doesn't get up the right way,\" said the Muley Cow. \"When rising from the ground one should stand on his hind feet first.\"  \"I don't agree with you,\" Twinkleheels told her. \"Ebenezer uses the right method. But he's terribly poky about it. You can almost hear his joints creak.\"  The Muley Cow was somewhat offended.  \"I've known Ebenezer a great many years,\" she snapped. \"I don't care to hear a young upstart--a mere pony--make fun of him.\"  Twinkleheels moved away. He felt the least bit uncomfortable.  \"I don't like your young friend,\" said the Muley Cow to the old horse Ebenezer. \"He hasn't a proper respect for old people like you and me.\"  \"Oh, he's not a bad sort,\" Ebenezer replied. \"He has a good many things to learn. Perhaps he'll be wiser by night. I shouldn't worry about him, if I were you.\"  The Muley Cow told Ebenezer that he was entirely too good-natured. And they went their own ways, grazing and rambling aimlessly about the pasture.  Now and then, during the day, they chanced to meet. And always the Muley Cow asked Ebenezer if Twinkleheels had learned anything more.  \"Not yet!\" Ebenezer said, each time. \"The day's not done till sunset.\"  Well, late in the afternoon Johnnie Green came slowly up the lane and stood by the pasture bars and whistled. Twinkleheels and Ebenezer happened to be together when they heard that cheerful chirp.  \"I'll race you to the bars!\" Twinkleheels exclaimed.  \"Agreed!\" cried Ebenezer. The word was no sooner out of his mouth than he started with a rush. He was three jumps ahead of Twinkleheels before that surprised pony began to run.  \"I'll soon catch the old horse,\" Twinkleheels thought. \"He can't last long. I'll pass him before we reach the brook.\"  Before Twinkleheels came to the brook Ebenezer had crossed it in one mighty leap. He was pounding along with a"]]]
