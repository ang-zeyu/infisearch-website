As he ploughs through the ring, a Whisperer (one of those broken-down followers of the turf who get their living in various mysterious ways, but partly by giving “tips” to backers) pulls his sleeve.  “What are you backing?” he says.  “Favourite and Royal Scot,” says the Oracle.  “Put a pound on Bendemeer,” says the tipster. “It's a certainty. Meet me here if it comes off, and I'll tell you something for the next race. Don't miss it now. Get on quick!”  The Oracle is humble enough before the hanger-on of the turf. A bookmaker roars “10 to 1 Bendemeer;” he suddenly fishes out a sovereign of his own--and he hasn't money to spare, for all his knowingness--and puts it on Bendemeer. His friends' money he puts on the favourite and Royal Scot as arranged. Then they all go round to watch the race.  The horses are at the post; a distant cluster of crowded animals with little dots of colour on their backs. Green, blue, yellow, purple, French grey, and old gold, they change about in a bewildering manner, and though the Oracle has a cheap pair of glasses, he can't make out where Bendemeer has got to. Royal Scot and the favourite he has lost interest in, and secretly hopes that they will be left at the post or break their necks; but he does not confide his sentiment to his companions.  They're off! The long line of colours across the track becomes a shapeless clump and then draws out into a long string. “What's that in front?” yells someone at the rails. “Oh, that thing of Hart's,” says someone else. But the Oracle hears them not; he is looking in the mass of colour for a purple cap and grey jacket, with black arm bands. He cannot see it anywhere, and the confused and confusing mass swings round the turn into the straight.  Then there is a babel of voices, and suddenly a shout of “Bendemeer! Bendemeer!” and the Oracle, without knowing which is Bendemeer, takes up the cry feverishly. “Bendemeer! Bendemeer!” he yells, waggling his glasses about, trying to see where the animal is.  “Where's Royal Scot, Charley? Where's Royal Scot?” screams one of his friends, in agony. “'Ow's he doin'?”  “No 'ope!” says the Oracle, with fiendish glee. “Bendemeer! Bendemeer!”  The horses are at the Leger stand now, whips are out, and three horses seem to be nearly abreast; in fact, to the Oracle there seem to be a dozen nearly abreast. Then a big chestnut sticks his head in front of the others, and a small man at the Oracle's side emits a deafening series of yells right by the Oracle's ear:  “Go on, Jimmy! Rub it into him! Belt him! It's a cake-walk! A cake-walk!”  The big chestnut, in a dogged sort of way, seems to stick his body clear of his opponents, and passes the post a winner by a length. The Oracle doesn't know what has won, but fumbles with his book. The number on the saddle-cloth catches his eye--No. 7; he looks hurriedly down the page. No. 7--Royal Scot. Second is No. 24--Bendemeer. Favourite nowhere.  Hardly has he realised it, before his friends are cheering and clapping him on the back. “By George, Charley, it takes you to pick 'em.” “Come and 'ave a wet!” “You 'ad a quid in, didn't you, Charley?” The Oracle feels very sick at having missed the winner, but he dies game. “Yes, rather; I had a quid on,” he says. “And” (here he nerves himself to smile) “I had a saver on the second, too.”  His comrades gasp with astonishment. “D'you hear that, eh? Charley backed first and second. That's pickin' 'em if you like.” They have a wet, and pour fulsome adulation on the Oracle when he collects their money.  After the Oracle has collected the winnings for his friends he meets the Whisperer again.  “It didn't win?” he says to the Whisperer in inquiring tones.  “Didn't win,” says the Whisperer, who has determined to brazen the matter out. “How could he win? Did you see the way he was ridden? That horse was stiffened just after I seen you, and he never tried a yard. Did you see the way he was pulled and hauled about at the turn? It'd make a man sick. What was the stipendiary stewards doing, I wonder?”  This fills the Oracle with a new idea. All that he remembers of the race at the turn was a jumble of colours, a kaleidoscope of horses and of riders hanging on to the horses' necks. But it wouldn't do to admit that he didn't see everything, and didn't know everything; so he plunges in boldly.  “O' course I saw it,” he says. “And a blind man could see it. They ought to rub him out.”  “Course they ought,” says the Whisperer. “But, look here, put two quid on Tell-tale; you'll get it all back!”  The Oracle does put on “two quid”, and doesn't get it all back. Neither does he see any more of this race than he did of the last one--in fact, he cheers wildly when the wrong horse is coming in. But when the public begin to hoot he hoots as loudly as anybody--louder if anything; and all the way home in the tram he lays down the law about stiff running, and wants to know what the stipendiaries are doing.  If you go into any barber's shop, you can hear him at it, and he flourishes in suburban railway carriages; but he has a tremendous local reputation, having picked first and second in the handicap, and it would be a bold man who would venture to question the Oracle's knowledge of racing and of all matters relating to it.     THE CAST-IRON CANVASSER   The firm of Sloper and Dodge, publishers and printers, was in great distress. These two enterprising individuals had worked up an enormous business in time-payment books, which they sold all over Australia by means of canvassers. They had put all the money they had into the business; and now, just when everything was in thorough working order, the public had revolted against them.  Their canvassers were molested by the country folk in divers strange bush ways. One was made drunk, and then a two-horse harrow was run over him; another was decoyed into the ranges on pretence of being shown a gold-mine, and his guide galloped away and left him to freeze all night in the bush. In mining localities the inhabitants were called together by beating a camp-oven lid with a pick, and the canvasser was given ten minutes in which to get out of the town alive. If he disregarded the hint he would, as likely as not, fall accidentally down a disused shaft.  The people of one district applied to their M.P. to have canvassers brought under the “Noxious Animals Act”, and demanded that a reward should be offered for their scalps. Reports appeared in the country press about strange, gigantic birds that appeared at remote selections and frightened the inhabitants to death--these were Sloper and Dodge's sober and reliable agents, wearing neat, close-fitting suits of tar and feathers.  In fact, it was altogether too hot for the canvassers, and they came in from North and West and South, crippled and disheartened, to tender their resignations. To make matters worse, Sloper and Dodge had just got out a large Atlas of Australasia, and if they couldn't sell it, ruin stared them in the face; and how could they sell it without canvassers?  The members of the firm sat in their private office. Sloper was a long, sanctimonious individual, very religious and very bald. Dodge was a little, fat American, with bristly, black hair and beard, and quick, beady eyes. He was eternally smoking a reeking black pipe, and puffing the smoke through his nose in great whiffs, like a locomotive on a steep grade. Anybody walking into one of those whiffs was liable to get paralysis.  Just as things were at their very blackest, something had turned up that promised to relieve all their difficulties. An inventor had offered to supply them with a patent cast-iron canvasser--a figure which (he said) when wound up would walk, talk, collect orders, and stand any amount of ill-usage and wear and tear. If this could indeed be done, they were saved. They had made an appointment with the genius; but he was half-an-hour late, and the partners were steeped in gloom.  They had begun to despair of his appearing at all, when a cab rattled up to the door. Sloper and Dodge rushed unanimously to the window. A young man, very badly dressed, stepped out of the cab, holding over his shoulder what looked like the upper half of a man's body. In his disengaged hand he held a pair of human legs with boots and trousers on. Thus burdened he turned to ask his fare, but the cabman gave a yell of terror, whipped up his horse, and disappeared at a hand-gallop; and a woman who happened to be going by, ran down the street, howling that Jack the Ripper had come to town. The man bolted in at the door, and toiled up the dark stairs tramping heavily, the legs and feet, which he dragged after him, making an unearthly clatter. He came in and put his burden down on the sofa.  “There you are, gents,” he said; “there's your canvasser.”  Sloper and Dodge recoiled in horror. The upper part of the man had a waxy face, dull, fishy eyes, and dark hair; he lounged on the sofa like a corpse at ease, while his legs and feet stood by, leaning stiffly against the wall. The partners gazed at him for a while in silence.  “Fix him together, for God's sake,” said Dodge. “He looks awful.”  The Genius grinned, and fixed the legs on.  “Now he looks better,” said Dodge, poking about the figure--“looks as much like life as most--ah, would you, you brute!” he exclaimed, springing back in alarm, for the figure had made a violent La Blanche swing at him.  “That's all right,” said the Inventor. “It's no good having his face knocked about, you know--lot of trouble to make that face. His head and body are full of springs, and if anybody hits him in the face, or in the pit of the stomach--favourite places to hit canvassers, the pit of the stomach--it sets a strong spring in motion, and he fetches his right hand round with a swipe that'll knock them into the middle of next week. It's an awful hit. Griffo couldn't dodge it, and Slavin"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30715"],["title","Where There's Hope (#1)"],["body","pair before him. They looked back contentedly, holding hands, their eyes dull.  Farrel said, \"How do you feel?\"  Ralph Pornsen said, \"I feel fine.\"  Mary Pornsen said, \"Oh, I feel _wonderful_!\"  Deliberately Farrel pressed another button below his desk-top.  The dull eyes cleared instantly.  \"Oh, you've given it some thought, Doc?\" Mary said sweetly. \"And what have you decided?\"  \"You'll see,\" Farrel said. \"Eventually.\"  He rose. \"That's all for now, kids. I'd like to see you again in one month--for a routine check-up.\"  Mary nodded and got up. \"You'll still have to wait, Doc. Why not admit you're licked?\"  Ralph got up too, and looked puzzled.  \"Wow,\" he said. \"I'm tired.\"  \"Perhaps just coming here,\" Farrel said, \"discharged some of the tension you've been carrying around.\"  The Pornsens left.  Farrel brought out some papers from his desk and studied them. Then, from the file drawer, he selected the record of Hugh and Alice Farrel. Alice would be at the perfect time of her menstrual cycle tomorrow....  Farrel flipped his communicator.  \"MacGuire,\" he said. \"Tomorrow it's me.\"  MacGuire chuckled. Farrel could have kicked him. He put his chin in his hands and stared out the port. Danny Stern had the log in place in the barricade. The bulldozer was moving on to a new task. His momentary doubt stilled, Farrel went back to work.         *       *       *       *       *  Twenty-one years later, when the ships from Earth began arriving, the log had been replaced by a stone monument erected to the memory of the Exodus VII, which had been cut apart for its valuable steel. Around the monument was a park, and on three sides of the park was a shining town--not really large enough to be called a city--of plastic and stone, for New Earth had no iron ore, only zinc and a little copper. This was often cause for regret.  Still it was a pretty good world. The monster problem had been licked by high-voltage cannon. Now in their third generation since the landing, the monsters kept their distance. And things grew--things good to eat.  And even without steel, the graceful, smoothly-functioning town looked impressive--quite a thing to have been built by a handful of beings with two arms and two legs each.  It hadn't been, entirely. But nobody thought much about that any more. Even the newcomers got used to it. Things change.
