The operation manual was buried in my desk and I never looked at it. If I had, I might have had some idea of the big changes that were in store. None of us knew the littlest bit about what a robot can or cannot do. Ned was working nicely as a combination janitor-file clerk and should have stayed that way. He would have too if the Chief hadn't been so lazy. That's what started it all.  It was around nine at night and the Chief was just going home when the call came in. He took it, listened for a moment, then hung up.  \"Greenback's liquor store. He got held up again. Says to come at once.\"  \"That's a change. Usually we don't hear about it until a month later. What's he paying protection money for if China Joe ain't protecting? What's the rush now?\"  The Chief chewed his loose lip for a while, finally and painfully reached a decision.  \"You better go around and see what the trouble is.\"  \"Sure,\" I said reaching for my cap. \"But no one else is around, you'll have to watch the desk until I get back.\"  \"That's no good,\" he moaned. \"I'm dying from hunger and sitting here isn't going to help me any.\"  \"I will go take the report,\" Ned said, stepping forward and snapping his usual well-greased salute.  At first the Chief wasn't buying. You would think the water cooler came to life and offered to take over his job.  \"How could _you_ take a report?\" he growled, putting the wise-guy water cooler in its place. But he had phrased his little insult as a question so he had only himself to blame. In exactly three minutes Ned gave the Chief a summary of the routine necessary for a police officer to make a report on an armed robbery or other reported theft. From the glazed look in Chief's protruding eyes I could tell Ned had quickly passed the boundaries of the Chief's meager knowledge.  \"Enough!\" the harried man finally gasped. \"If you know so much why don't you make a report?\"  Which to me sounded like another version of \"_if you're so damned smart why ain't you rich?_\" which we used to snarl at the brainy kids in grammar school. Ned took such things literally though, and turned towards the door.  \"Do you mean you wish me to make a report on this robbery?\"  \"Yes,\" the Chief said just to get rid of him, and we watched his blue shape vanish through the door.  \"He must be brighter than he looks,\" I said. \"He never stopped to ask where Greenback's store is.\"  The Chief nodded and the phone rang again. His hand was still resting on it so he picked it up by reflex. He listened for a second and you would have thought someone was pumping blood out of his heel from the way his face turned white.  \"The holdup's still on,\" he finally gasped. \"Greenback's delivery boy is on the line--calling back to see where we are. Says he's under a table in the back room ...\"  I never heard the rest of it because I was out the door and into the car. There were a hundred things that could happen if Ned got there before me. Guns could go off, people hurt, lots of things. And the police would be to blame for it all--sending a tin robot to do a cop's job. Maybe the Chief had ordered Ned there, but clearly as if the words were painted on the windshield of the car, I knew I would be dragged into it. It never gets very warm on Mars, but I was sweating.  Nineport has fourteen traffic regulations and I broke all of them before I had gone a block. Fast as I was, Ned was faster. As I turned the corner I saw him open the door of Greenback's store and walk in. I screamed brakes in behind him and arrived just in time to have a gallery seat. A shooting gallery at that.  There were two holdup punks, one behind the counter making like a clerk and the other lounging off to the side. Their guns were out of sight, but blue-coated Ned busting through the door like that was too much for their keyed up nerves. Up came both guns like they were on strings and Ned stopped dead. I grabbed for my own gun and waited for pieces of busted robot to come flying through the window.  Ned's reflexes were great. Which I suppose is what you should expect of a robot.  \"DROP YOUR GUNS, YOU ARE UNDER ARREST.\"  He must have had on full power or something, his voice blasted so loud my ears hurt. The result was just what you might expect. Both torpedoes let go at once and the air was filled with flying slugs. The show windows went out with a crash and I went down on my stomach. From the amount of noise I knew they both had recoilless .50's. You can't stop one of those slugs. They go right through you and anything else that happens to be in the way.  Except they didn't seem to be bothering Ned. The only notice he seemed to take was to cover his eyes. A little shield with a thin slit popped down over his eye lenses. Then he moved in on the first thug.  I knew he was fast, but not that fast. A couple of slugs jarred him as he came across the room, but before the punk could change his aim Ned had the gun in his hand. That was the end of that. He put on one of the sweetest hammer locks I have ever seen and neatly grabbed the gun when it dropped from the limp fingers. With the same motion that slipped the gun into a pouch he whipped out a pair of handcuffs and snapped them on the punk's wrists.  Holdupnik number two was heading for the door by then, and I was waiting to give him a warm reception. There was never any need. He hadn't gone halfway before Ned slid in front of him. There was a thud when they hit that didn't even shake Ned, but gave the other a glazed look. He never even knew it when Ned slipped the cuffs on him and dropped him down next to his partner.  I went in, took their guns from Ned, and made the arrest official. That was all Greenback saw when he crawled out from behind the counter and it was all I wanted him to see. The place was a foot deep in broken glass and smelled like the inside of a Jack Daniels bottle. Greenback began to howl like a wolf over his lost stock. He didn't seem to know any more about the phone call than I did, so I grabbed ahold of a pimply looking kid who staggered out of the storeroom. He was the one who had made the calls.  It turned out to be a matter of sheer stupidity. He had worked for Greenback only a few days and didn't have enough brains to realize that all holdups should be reported to the protection boys instead of the police. I told Greenback to wise up his boy, as look at the trouble that got caused. Then pushed the two ex-holdup men out to the car. Ned climbed in back with them and they clung together like two waifs in a storm. The robot's only response was to pull a first aid kit from his hip and fix up a ricochet hole in one of the thugs that no one had noticed in the excitement.         *       *       *       *       *  The Chief was still sitting there with that bloodless look when we marched in. I didn't believe it could be done, but he went two shades whiter.  \"You made the pinch,\" he whispered. Before I could straighten him out a second and more awful idea hit him. He grabbed a handful of shirt on the first torpedo and poked his face down. \"You with China Joe,\" he snarled.  The punk made the error of trying to be cute so the Chief let him have one on the head with the open hand that set his eyes rolling like marbles. When the question got asked again he found the right answer.  \"I never heard from no China Joe. We just hit town today and--\"  \"Freelance, by God,\" the Chief sighed and collapsed into his chair. \"Lock 'em up and quickly tell me what in hell happened.\"  I slammed the gate on them and pointed a none too steady finger at Ned.  \"There's the hero,\" I said. \"Took them on single-handed, rassled them for a fall and made the capture. He is a one-robot tornado, a power for good in this otherwise evil community. And he's bulletproof too.\" I ran a finger over Ned's broad chest. The paint was chipped by the slugs, but the metal was hardly scratched.  \"This is going to cause me trouble, big trouble,\" the Chief wailed.  I knew he meant with the protection boys. They did not like punks getting arrested and guns going off without their okay. But Ned thought the Chief had other worries and rushed in to put them right. \"There will be no trouble. At no time did I violate any of the Robotic Restriction Laws, they are part of my control circuits and therefore fully automatic. The men who drew their guns violated both robotic and human law when they threatened violence. I did not injure the men--merely restrained them.\"  It was all over the Chief's head, but I liked to think _I_ could follow it. And I _had_ been wondering how a robot--a machine--could be involved in something like law application and violence. Ned had the answer to that one too.  \"Robots have been assuming these functions for years. Don't recording radar meters pass judgment on human violation of automobile regulations? A robot alcohol detector is better qualified to assess the sobriety of a prisoner than the arresting officer. At one time robots were even allowed to make their own decisions about killing. Before the Robotic Restriction Laws automatic gun-pointers were in general use. Their final development was a self-contained battery of large anti-aircraft guns. Automatic scan radar detected all aircraft in the vicinity. Those that could not return the correct identifying signal had their courses tracked and computed, automatic fuse-cutters and loaders readied the computer-aimed guns--which were fired by the robot mechanism.\"  There was little I could argue about with Ned. Except maybe his college-professor vocabulary. So I switched the attack.  \"But a robot can't take the place of a cop, it's a complex human job.\"  \"Of course it is, but taking a human policeman's place is not the function of a police robot. Primarily I combine the functions of numerous pieces of police equipment, integrating their operations and making them instantly available. In addition I can aid in the _mechanical_ processes of law"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/29204"],["title","Arm of the Law (#2)"],["body",". If you arrest a man you handcuff him. But if you order me to do it, I have made no moral decision. I am just a machine for attaching handcuffs at that point ...\"  My raised hand cut off the flow of robotic argument. Ned was hipped to his ears with facts and figures and I had a good idea who would come off second best in any continued discussion. No laws had been broken when Ned made the pinch, that was for sure. But there are other laws than those that appear on the books.  \"China Joe is not going to like this, not at all,\" the Chief said, speaking my own thoughts.  The law of Tooth and Claw. That's one that wasn't in the law books. And that was what ran Nineport. The place was just big enough to have a good population of gambling joints, bawdy houses and drunk-rollers. They were all run by China Joe. As was the police department. We were all in his pocket and you might say he was the one who paid our wages. This is not the kind of thing, though, that you explain to a robot.  \"Yeah, China Joe.\"  I thought it was an echo at first, then realized that someone had eased in the door behind me. Something called Alex. Six feet of bone, muscle and trouble. China Joe's right hand man. He imitated a smile at the Chief who sank a bit lower in his chair.  \"China Joe wants you should tell him why you got smart cops going around and putting the arm on people and letting them shoot up good liquor. He's mostly angry about the hooch. He says that he had enough guff and after this you should--\"  \"I am putting you under Robot Arrest, pursuant to article 46, paragraph 19 of the revised statutes ...\"  Ned had done it before we realized he had even moved. Right in front of our eyes he was arresting Alex and signing our death warrants.  Alex was not slow. As he turned to see who had grabbed him, he had already dragged out this cannon. He got one shot in, square against Ned's chest, before the robot plucked the gun away and slipped on the cuffs. While we all gaped like dead fish, Ned recited the charge in what I swear was a satisfied tone.  \"The prisoner is Peter Rakjomskj, alias Alex the Axe, wanted in Canal City for armed robbery and attempted murder. Also wanted by local police of Detroit, New York and Manchester on charges of ...\"  \"_Get it off me!_\" Alex howled. We might have too, and everything might have still been straightened out if Benny Bug hadn't heard the shot. He popped his head in the front door just long enough to roll his eyes over our little scene.  \"Alex ... they're puttin' the arm on Alex!\"  Then he was gone and when I hit the door he was nowhere in sight. China Joe's boys always went around in pairs. And in ten minutes he would know all about it.  \"Book him,\" I told Ned. \"It wouldn't make any difference if we let him go now. The world has already come to an end.\"  Fats came in then, mumbling to himself. He jerked a thumb over his shoulder when he saw me.  \"What's up? I see little Benny Bug come out of here like the place was on fire and almost get killed driving away?\"  Then Fats saw Alex with the bracelets on and turned sober in one second. He just took a moment to gape, then his mind was made up. Without a trace of a stagger he walked over to the Chief and threw his badge on the desk in front of him.  \"I am an old man and I drink too much to be a cop. Therefore I am resigning from the force. Because if that is whom I think it is over there with the cuffs on, I will not live to be a day older as long as I am around here.\"  \"Rat.\" The Chief growled in pain through his clenched teeth. \"Deserting the sinking ship. Rat.\"  \"Squeak,\" Fats said and left.  The Chief was beyond caring at this point. He didn't blink an eye when I took Fats' badge off the desk. I don't know why I did it, perhaps I thought it was only fair. Ned had started all the trouble and I was just angry enough to want him on the spot when it was finished. There were two rings on his chest plate, and I was not surprised when the badge pin fitted them neatly.  \"There, now you are a real cop.\" Sarcasm dripped from the words. I should have realized that robots are immune to sarcasm. Ned took my statement at face value.  \"This is a very great honor, not only for me but for all robots. I will do my best to fulfill all the obligations of the office.\" Jack Armstrong in tin underwear. I could hear the little motors in his guts humming with joy as he booked Alex.  If everything else hadn't been so bad I would have enjoyed that. Ned had more police equipment built into him than Nineport had ever owned. There was an ink pad that snapped out of one hip, and he efficiently rolled Alex's fingertips across it and stamped them on a card. Then he held the prisoner at arm's length while something clicked in his abdomen. Once more sideways and two instant photographs dropped out of a slot. The mug shots were stuck on the card, arrest details and such inserted. There was more like this, but I forced myself away. There were more important things to think about.  Like staying alive.  \"Any ideas, Chief?\"  A groan was my only answer so I let it go at that. Billy, the balance of the police force, came in then. I gave him a quick rundown. Either through stupidity or guts he elected to stay, and I was proud of the boy. Ned locked away the latest prisoner and began sweeping up.  That was the way we were when China Joe walked in.  Even though we were expecting it, it was still a shock. He had a bunch of his toughest hoods with him and they crowded through the door like an overweight baseball team. China Joe was in front, hands buried in the sleeves of his long mandarin gown. No expression at all on his ascetic features. He didn't waste time talking to us, just gave the word to his own boys.  \"Clean this place up. The new police Chief will be here in a while and I don't want him to see any bums hanging around.\"  It made me angry. Even with the graft I like to feel I'm still a cop. Not on a cheap punk's payroll. I was also curious about China Joe. Had been ever since I tried to get a line on him and never found a thing. I still wanted to know.  \"Ned, take a good look at that Chinese guy in the rayon bathrobe and let me know who he is.\"  My, but those electronic circuits work fast. Ned shot the answer back like a straight man who had been rehearsing his lines for weeks.  \"He is a pseudo-oriental, utilizing a natural sallowness of the skin heightened with dye. He is not Chinese. There has also been an operation on his eyes, scars of which are still visible. This has been undoubtedly done in an attempt to conceal his real identity, but Bertillon measurements of his ears and other features make identity positive. He is on the Very Wanted list of Interpol and his real name is ...\"  China Joe was angry, and with a reason.  \"That's the _thing_ ... that big-mouthed tin radio set over there. We heard about it and we're taking care of it!\"  The mob jumped aside then or hit the deck and I saw there was a guy kneeling in the door with a rocket launcher. Shaped anti-tank charges, no doubt. That was my last thought as the thing let go with a \"whoosh.\"  Maybe you can hit a tank with one of those. But not a robot. At least not a police robot. Ned was sliding across the floor on his face when the back wall blew up. There was no second shot. Ned closed his hand on the tube of the bazooka and it was so much old drainpipe.  Billy decided then that anyone who fired a rocket in a police station was breaking the law, so he moved in with his club. I was right behind him since I did not want to miss any of the fun. Ned was at the bottom somewhere, but I didn't doubt he could take care of himself.  There were a couple of muffled shots and someone screamed. No one fired after that because we were too tangled up. A punk named Brooklyn Eddie hit me on the side of the head with his gunbutt and I broke his nose all over his face with my fist.         *       *       *       *       *  There is a kind of a fog over everything after that. But I do remember it was very busy for a while.  When the fog lifted a bit I realized I was the only one still standing. Or leaning rather. It was a good thing the wall was there.  Ned came in through the street door carrying a very bashed-looking Brooklyn Eddie. I hoped I had done all that. Eddie's wrists were fastened together with cuffs. Ned laid him gently next to the heap of thugs--who I suddenly realized all wore the same kind of handcuffs. I wondered vaguely if Ned made them as he needed them or had a supply tucked away in a hollow leg or something.  There was a chair a few feet away and sitting down helped.  Blood was all over everything and if a couple of the hoods hadn't groaned I would have thought they were corpses. One was, I noticed suddenly. A bullet had caught him in the chest, most of the blood was probably his.  Ned burrowed in the bodies for a moment and dragged Billy out. He was unconscious. A big smile on his face and the splintered remains of his nightstick still stuck in his fist. It takes very little to make some people happy. A bullet had gone through his leg and he never moved while Ned ripped the pants leg off and put on a bandage.  \"The spurious China Joe and one other man escaped in a car,\" Ned reported.  \"Don't let it worry you,\" I managed to croak. \"Your batting average still leads the league.\"  It was then I realized the Chief was still sitting in his chair, where he had been when the brouhaha started. Still slumped down with that glazed look. Only after I started to talk to him did I realize that Alonzo Craig, Chief of Police of Nineport, was now dead.  A single shot. Small caliber gun, maybe a .22. Right through the heart and what blood there had been was soaked up by his clothes. I had a good idea where the gun would be that fired that shot. A small gun, the kind that would fit in a wide Chinese sleeve.  I wasn't tired or groggy any more. Just angry. Maybe he hadn't been the brightest or most honest guy in the world. But he deserved a better"]]]
