It was all right to badger Jackson up to a certain point, but it would be foolish to go beyond that.  \"However,\" he went on with hardly a break, \"since, as you say, it is not a matter of public record, I'm perfectly willing to answer any questions you care to ask.\"  \"Just give us a general rundown of the conversation,\" Jackson said. \"If I have any questions, I'll ... uh ... ask them at the proper time.\"         *       *       *       *       *  McLeod did the best he could to give a clear picture of what the Galactic had wanted. There was really very little to it. The Galactic was a member of a race that McLeod had never seen before: a humanoid with red skin--fire-engine, not Amerindian--and a rather pleasant-looking face, in contrast to the rather crocodilian features of the Galactic resident. He had introduced himself by an un-pronounceable name and then had explained that since the name meant \"mild\" or \"merciful\" in one of the ancient tongues of his planet, it would be perfectly all right if McLeod called him \"Clement.\" Within minutes, it had been \"Clem\" and \"Mac.\"  McLeod could see that Jackson didn't quite believe that. Galactics, of whatever race, were aloof, polite, reserved, and sometimes irritatingly patronizing--never buddy-buddy. McLeod couldn't help what Jackson might think; what was important was that it was true.  What Clem wanted was very simple. Clem was--after a manner of speaking--a literary agent. Apparently the Galactic system of book publishing didn't work quite the way the Terrestrial system did; Clem took his commission from the publisher instead of the author, but was considered a representative of the author, not the publisher. McLeod hadn't quite understood how that sort of thing would work out, but he let it pass. There were a lot of things he didn't understand about Galactics.  All Clem wanted was to act as McLeod's agent for the publication of \"Interstellar Ark.\"  \"And what did you tell him?\" Jackson asked.  \"I told him I'd think it over.\"  Jackson leaned forward. \"How much money did he offer?\" he asked eagerly.  \"Not much,\" McLeod said. \"That's why I told him I'd think it over. He said that, considering the high cost of transportation, relaying, translation, and so on, he couldn't offer me more than one thousandth of one per cent royalties.\"  Jackson blinked. \"One _what_?\"  \"One thousandth of one per cent. If the book sells a hundred thousand copies at a credit a copy, they will send me a nice, juicy check for one lousy credit.\"  Jackson scowled. \"They're cheating you.\"  \"Clem said it was the standard rate for a first book.\"  Jackson shook his head. \"Just because we don't have interstellar ships and are confined to our own solar system, they treat us as though we were ignorant savages. They're cheating you high, wide, and handsome.\"  \"Maybe,\" said McLeod. \"But if they really wanted to cheat me, they could just pirate the book. There wouldn't be a thing I could do about it.\"  \"Yeah. But to keep up their facade of high ethics, they toss us a sop. And we have to take whatever they hand out. You _will_ take it, of course.\" It was more of an order than a question.  \"I told him I'd think it over,\" McLeod said.  Jackson stood up. \"Professor McLeod, the human race needs every Galactic credit it can lay its hands on. It's your duty to accept the offer, no matter how lousy it is. We have no choice in the matter. And a Galactic credit is worth ten dollars American, four pounds U.K., or forty rubles Soviet. If you sell a hundred thousand copies of your book, you can get yourself a meal in a fairly good restaurant and Earth will have one more Galactic credit stashed away. If you don't sell that many, you aren't out anything.\"  \"I suppose not,\" McLeod said slowly. He knew that the Government could force him to take the offer. Under the Planetary Security Act, the Government had broad powers--very broad.  \"Well, that isn't my business right now,\" Jackson said. \"I just wanted to find out what this was all about. You'll hear from us, Professor McLeod.\"  \"I don't doubt it,\" said McLeod.  The six men filed out the door.         *       *       *       *       *  Alone, McLeod stared at the wall and thought.  Earth needed every Galactic credit it could get; that was certain. The trouble came in getting them.  Earth had absolutely nothing that the Galactics wanted. Well, not absolutely, maybe, but so near as made no difference. Certainly there was no basis for trade. As far as the Galactics were concerned, Earth was a little backwater planet that was of no importance. Nothing manufactured on the planet was of any use to Galactics. Nothing grown on Earth was of any commercial importance. They had sampled the animals and plants for scientific purposes, but there was no real commercial value in them. The Government had added a few credits to its meager collection when the animals had been taken, but the amount was small.  McLeod thought about the natives of New Guinea and decided that on the Galactic scale Earth was about in the same position. Except that there had at least been gold in New Guinea. The Galactics didn't have any interest in Earth's minerals; the elements were much more easily available in the asteroid belts that nearly every planetary system seemed to have.  The Galactics were by no means interested in bringing civilization to the barbarians of Earth, either. They had no missionaries to bring new religion, no do-gooders to \"elevate the cultural level of the natives.\" They had no free handouts for anyone. If Earthmen wanted anything from them, the terms were cash on the barrelhead. Earth's credit rating in the Galactic equivalent of Dun & Bradstreet was triple-Z-zero.  [Illustration]  A Galactic ship had, so to speak, stumbled over Earth fifteen years before. Like the English explorers of the Eighteenth and Nineteenth Centuries, the Galactics seemed to feel that it was necessary to install one of their own people on a new-found planet, but they were not in the least interested in colonization nor in taking over Earth's government. The Galactic Resident was not in any sense a Royal Governor, and could hardly even be called an ambassador. He and his staff--a small one, kept more for company than for any necessary work--lived quietly by themselves in a house they'd built in Hawaii. Nobody knew what they did, and it didn't seem wise to ask.  The first Galactic Resident had been shot and killed by some religious nut. Less than twenty-four hours later, the Galactic Space Navy--if that was the proper term--had come to claim the body. There were no recriminations, no reprisals. They came, \"more in sorrow than in anger,\" to get the body. They came in a spaceship that was easily visible to the naked eye long before it hit the atmosphere--a sphere three kilometers in diameter. The missiles with thermonuclear warheads that were sent up to intercept the ship were detonated long before they touched the ship, and neither Galactics nor Earthmen ever mentioned them again. It had been the most frightening display of power ever seen on Earth, and the Galactics hadn't even threatened anyone. They just came to get a body.  Needless to say, there was little danger that they would ever have to repeat the performance.  The national governments of Earth had organized themselves hurriedly into the Terrestrial Union. Shaky at first, it had gained stability and power with the years. The first thing the Union Government had wanted to do was send an ambassador to the Galactic Government. The Galactic Resident had politely explained that their concept of government was different from ours, that ambassadors had no place in that concept, and, anyway, there was no capital to send one to. However, if Earth wanted to send an observer of some kind....  Earth did.  Fine. A statement of passenger fares was forthcoming; naturally, there were no regular passenger ships stopping at Earth and there would not be in the foreseeable future, but doubtless arrangements could be made to charter a vessel. It would be expensive, but....  If a New Guinea savage wants to take passage aboard a Qantas airliner, what is the fare in cowrie shells?  As far as McLeod knew, his book was the first thing ever produced on Earth that the Galactics were even remotely interested in. He had a higher opinion of the ethics of the Galactics than Jackson did, but a thousandth of a per cent seemed like pretty small royalties. And he couldn't for the life of him see why his book would interest a Galactic. Clem had explained that it gave Galactics a chance to see what they looked like through the eyes of an Earthman, but that seemed rather weak to McLeod.  Nevertheless, he knew he would take Clem's offer.         *       *       *       *       *  Eight months later, a shipload of Galactic tourists arrived. For a while, it looked as though Earth's credit problem might be solved. Tourism has always been a fine method for getting money from other countries--especially if one's own country is properly picturesque. Tourists always had money, didn't they? And they spend it freely, didn't they?  No.  Not in this case.  Earth had nothing to sell to the tourists.  Ever hear of _baluts_? The Melanesians of the South Pacific consider it a very fine delicacy. You take a fertilized duck egg and you bury it in the warm earth. Six months later, when it is nice and overripe, you dig it up again, knock the top off the shell the way you would a soft-boiled egg, and eat it. Then you pick the pinfeathers out of your teeth. _Baluts._  Now you know how the greatest delicacies of Earth's restaurants affected the Galactics.  Earth was just a little _too_ picturesque. The tourists enjoyed the sights, but they ate aboard their ship, which was evidently somewhat like a Caribbean cruise ship. And they bought nothing. They just looked.  And laughed.  And of course they all wanted to meet Professor John Hamish McLeod.

Editorial in _Pravda_:       The stupid book written by the American J. H. McLeod has      made Earth a laughingstock throughout the galaxy. His      inability to comprehend the finer nuances of Galactic      Socialism has made all Earthmen look foolish. It is too bad      that a competent Russian zoologist was not chosen for the      trip that McLeod made; a man properly trained in the      understanding of the historical forces of dialectic      materialism would have realized that any Galactic society      must of necessity be a Communist State, and would have      interpreted it as such. The petty bourgeois mind of McLeod      has made it impossible for any Earthman to hold up his head      in the free Socialist society of the galaxy. Until this      matter is corrected....  News item Manchester _Guardian_:       Professor James H. McLeod, the American zoologist whose book      has apparently aroused a great deal of hilarity in Galactic      circles, admitted today that both Columbia University and      the American Museum of Natural History have accepted his      resignation. The recent statement by a University spokesman      that Professor McLeod had \"besmirched the honor of Earthmen      everywhere\" was considered at least partially responsible      for the resignations. (See editorial.)  Editorial, Manchester _Guardian_:       ... It is a truism that an accepted wit has only to say,      'Pass the butter,' and everyone will laugh. Professor      McLeod, however, far from being an accepted wit, seems      rather to be in the position of a medieval Court Fool, who      was laughed _at_ rather than _with_. As a consequence, all      Earthmen have been branded as Fools....  Statement made by the American Senator from Alabama:       \"He has made us all look like jackasses in the eyes of the      Galactics, and at this precarious time in human history it      is my considered opinion that such actions are treasonous to      the human race and to Earth and should be treated and      considered as such!\"  Book review, _Literary Checklist_, Helvar III, Bornis Cluster:       \"Interstellar Ark, an Earthman's View of the Galaxy,\"      translated from the original tongue by Vonis Delf, Cr. 5.00.      This inexpensive little book is one of the most      entertainingly funny publications in current print. The      author, one John McLeod, is a member of a type 3-7B race      inhabiting a planet in the Outer Fringes.... As an example      of the unwitting humor of the book, we have only to quote      the following:       \"I was shown to my quarters shortly before takeoff. Captain      Benarly had assigned me a spacious cabin which was almost      luxurious in its furnishings. The bed was one of the most      comfortable I have ever slept in.\"       Or the following:       \"I found the members of the crew to be friendly and      co-operative, especially Nern Cronzel, the ship's      physician.\"       It is our prediction that this little gem will be enjoyed      for a long time to come and will be a real money-maker for      its publishers.         *       *       *       *       *  _They haven't hanged me yet_, McLeod thought. He sat in his apartment alone and realized that it would take very little to get him hanged.  How could one book have aroused such wrath? Even as he thought it, McLeod knew the answer to that question. It wasn't the book. No one who had read it two and a half years before had said anything against it.  No, it wasn't the book. It was the Galactic reaction to the book. Already feeling inferior because of the stand-offish attitude of the beings from the stars, the Homeric laughter of those same beings had been too much. It would have been bad enough if that laughter had been generated by one of the Galactics. To have had it generated by an Earthman made it that much worse. Against an Earthman, their rage was far from impotent.  Nobody understood _why_ the book was funny, of course. The joke was over their heads, and that made human beings even angrier.  He remembered a quotation from a book he had read once. A member of some tribal-taboo culture--African or South Pacific, he forgot which--had been treated at a missionary hospital for something or other and had described his experience.  \"The white witch doctor protects himself by wearing a little round mirror on his head which reflects back the evil spirits.\"  Could that savage have possibly understood what was humorous about that remark? No. Not even if you explained to him why the doctor used the mirror that way.  _Now what?_ McLeod thought. He was out of a job and his bank account was running low. His credit rating had dropped to zero.  McLeod heard a key turn in the lock. The door swung open and Jackson entered with his squad of U.B.I. men.  \"Hey!\" said McLeod, jumping to his feet. \"What do you think this is?\"  \"Shut up, McLeod,\" Jackson growled. \"Get your coat. You're wanted at headquarters.\"  McLeod started to say something, then thought better of it. There was nothing he could say. Nobody would care if the U.B.I. manhandled him. Nobody would protest that his rights were being ignored. If McLeod got his teeth knocked in, Jackson would probably be voted a medal.  McLeod didn't say another word. He followed orders. He got his coat and was taken down to the big building on the East River which had begun its career as the United Nations Building.  He was bundled up to an office and shoved into a chair.  Somebody shoved a paper at him. \"Sign this!\"  \"What is it?\" McLeod asked, finding his voice.  \"A receipt. For two thousand dollars. Sign it.\"  McLeod looked the paper over, then looked up at the burly man who had shoved it at him. \"_Fifty thousand Galactic credits!_ What is this for?\"  \"The royalty check for your unprintably qualified book has come in, Funny Man. The Government is taking ninety-eight per cent for income taxes. Sign!\"  McLeod pushed the paper back across the desk. \"No. I won't. You can confiscate my money. I can't stop that, I guess. But I won't give it legal sanction by signing anything. I don't even see the two thousand dollars this is supposed to be a receipt for.\"  Jackson, who was standing behind McLeod, grabbed his arm and twisted. \"Sign!\" His voice was a snarl in McLeod's ear.  Eventually, of course, he signed.         *       *       *       *       *  \"'Nother beer, Mac?\" asked the bartender with a friendly smile.  \"Yeah, Leo; thanks.\" McLeod pushed his quarter across the bar with one hand and scratched negligently at his beard with the fingers of the other. Nobody questioned him in this neighborhood. The beard, which had taken two months to grow, disguised his face, and he had given his name as McCaffery, allowing his landlord and others who heard it to make the natural assumption that he was of Irish descent.  He was waiting. He had been forced to move from his apartment; nobody wanted that dirty so-and-so, Professor McLeod, around. Besides, his money was running short. He had never seen the two thousand. \"You'll get that when the Galactic bank cashes your royalty check,\" he had been told. He was waiting.  Not hiding. No. That wasn't possible. The U.B.I. could find him easily when they wanted him. There was no place he could have hidden from them for very long. A man needs friends to stay hidden from an efficient police organization for very long, and John Hamish McLeod had no friends. \"Jack McCaffery\" had, since he was a pleasant kind of fellow who made friends easily when he wanted them. But he had no illusions about his new friends. Let them once suspect, however faintly, that Good Old Jack McCaffery was really that Professor McLeod, and the game would be up.  The U.B.I. would find him again all right, whenever it wanted him. And McLeod hoped it would be soon because he was down to his last hundred bucks.  So he waited and thought about fifty thousand Galactic credits.  The mathematics was simple, but it conveyed an awful lot of information. To make fifty thousand credits from one thousandth of one percent royalties on a book selling at five credits the copy, one must needs sell a billion copies. Nothing to it.                   5X·10to the power of -5 = 5·10to the power of 4                Ergo:       X = 10to the power of 9  McLeod drew the equations on the bar with the tip of a wet forefinger, then rubbed them out quickly.  A billion copies in the first year. He should have seen it. He should have understood.  How many planets were there in the galaxy?  How many people on each planet?  Communication, even at ultralight velocities, would be necessarily slow. The galaxy was just too big to be compassed by the human mind--or even by the mind of a Galactic, McLeod suspected.  How do you publish a book for Galactic, for galaxy-wide, consumption? How long does it take to saturate the market on each planet? How long does it take to spread the book from planet to planet? How many people were there on each planet who would buy a good book? Or, at least, an entertaining one.  McLeod didn't know, but he suspected that the number was huge. McLeod was a zoologist, not an astronomer, but he read enough on astronomy to know that the estimated number of Earth-type planets alone--according to the latest theory--ran into the tens of millions or hundreds of millions. The--  A man sat down on the stool next to McLeod and said something loud enough and foul enough to break the zoologist's train of thought.  \"Gimme a shot, Leo,\" he added in an angry voice.  \"Sure, Pete,\" the bartender said. \"What's the trouble?\"  \"_Tourists_,\" Pete said with a snarl. \"Laffin' attus alla time like we was monkeys inna zoo! Bunch 'em come inta day.\" He downed his whiskey with a practiced flip of the wrist and slammed it on the bar. Leo refilled it immediately. \"I shunt gripe, I guess. Gotta haffa credit offen 'em.\" He slapped down a five dollar bill as though it "]]]
