The milk collected after this time is mixed with cranberries and put into the paunch of the reindeer, well cleaned from filth; thus the milk soon congeals, and it is cut out in slices, together with the paunch, to effect which a hatchet is used, for no smaller instrument would perform the office of dividing that lump of ice. It is then separated into small pieces and eaten throughout the winter every day at noon, which is the Laplander's dinner-hour. It must be presumed, as it is served up without being brought to the fire, that this is ice-cream in the greatest perfection: here are flesh and fruit blended with the richest butyraceous milk that can be drawn from any animal; but, notwithstanding the extraordinary fatness, which may be supposed to resist in a great degree the effect of cold, this preparation, as our good missionary remarks with a degree of feeling, as if his teeth still chattered whilst he delivered the account, chills and freezes the mouth in a violent manner whenever it is taken. The milk which is drawn late in the winter freezes immediately after being drawn. This is put into small vessels made of birchwood, and is considered by the Laplander as such an extraordinary delicacy, that he reserves it as the most acceptable present he can offer even a missionary. It is placed before the fire and eaten with a spoon as it is thawed. When put by, it is carefully covered up, because if the cold air gets to it afterwards, it turns of a yellow colour and becomes rancid.\"  Amongst the peasants at the present day, soured milk is known as _yoghourt_, a word which is spelt differently according to the locality in which it is used. The method of preparation is practically the same everywhere, and a short description of the process as now carried out in one place would, with slight modifications, apply to the general method adopted all over the East.  \"The culture,\" says a correspondent at Varna, \"which is used for the preparation of yogourt, is known as 'Maya' or as 'Bulgarian Maya.' The milk which is to be converted into yogourt must first be freed from all bacteria by boiling and allowed to cool to the temperature of 45° C.; it is then inoculated with maya and maintained at an even temperature of 45° C. during several hours. There are two kinds of maya, or ferment, one known as sour, and the other as sweet maya.  \"In Europe small stoves, made expressly for the purpose, are used to maintain the milk at the proper temperature. In this country, however, after the milk has been boiled, it is merely poured into a bowl and allowed to cool to approximately 45° C., then a tablespoonful of this tepid milk is well mixed (in a small bowl apart) with a similar quantity of maya, and the mixture, when it has become quite homogeneous, is added to the bowl of tepid milk and stirred slightly. (One tablespoonful of maya is sufficient to ferment one litre of milk.) A cover is then placed on the bowl and the whole is enveloped in flannel and left in a warm place for three hours in summer, and somewhat longer in winter.  \"The process of preparation is complete when the mixture assumes the appearance of a soft mass somewhat resembling cream cheese, but less solid. The flannel is then removed, the bowl uncovered and placed in a cool spot until needed for consumption. Of the yogourt thus prepared, a tablespoonful is kept to serve as maya for the following day.  \"The best yogourt is prepared from sheep's milk, the second quality from buffaloes' milk, and the third quality from cows' milk. Yogourt forms an almost daily article of diet with the natives in this country.\"[12]  With regard to the time stated for the fermenting process, it must be noted that since the subject has been investigated so thoroughly, the time required for fermentation has been found to be nearer ten than three hours, but this will be dealt with in a subsequent chapter.  Historically it may be gleaned from the fragmentary references which we have given, that soured milk has, from time immemorial, formed the principal article of diet of a great many peoples, and the notable feature in connection with it is, that in some countries where it is in daily use, the age limit for human beings seems to be very much extended, and it would appear that there is a direct connection between the use of soured milk and longevity. In Bulgaria, for example, it is stated that the majority of the natives live to an age considerably in excess of what is recognised as the term of life amongst Western nations, and inquiry has shown that in the eastern part of Southern Europe, amongst a population of about three millions, there were more than three thousand centenarians found performing duties which would not be assigned to a man of sixty-five years of age elsewhere. It is quite common to find amongst the peasants who live to such a large extent upon soured milk, individuals of 110 and 120 years of age.[13]  In the ancient dairy practice, as we have seen, soured milk was the principal product, and the extraordinary ages which are recorded of the patriarchs, if translated into the modern denomination, would not appear to be so imaginary after all, when it is considered that we have thousands of examples at the present day of men and women enjoying quite as long a term of existence. It has been noticed also, that while these very old people are able to perform a certain amount of manual labour, there is not the same tendency to the mental decay which is so prominent and sad a feature amongst Western nations, at a period of about seventy or eighty years of age. It would seem, indeed, as if the habit of living long was well known in ancient times, and that, like many other of the valuable arts and sciences, it fell under a cloud during the Middle Ages, or, perhaps, the significance of the use of soured milk fell into neglect, and, even after the revival of letters in the sixteenth century, still remained obscure.  The discovery of micro-organisms in perishable products, which is attributable to Anthony Van Leeuwenhoek, a Dutchman, whose vocation was the polishing of lenses, and who lived between 1632 and 1723, altered our point of view, not only of disease, but of all the functions carried on by the lower organisms. Since Van Leeuwenhoek's time, the germ theory has grown to vast proportions and has more especially been applied with splendid results to the study of milk. As we shall see later, the researches of modern investigators have led them to the conclusion that micro-organisms play such an important part in the milk supply, that it is impossible to carry it on safely without a knowledge of the bacteriology of the subject. This view began to prevail about 1890, some twenty years after Pasteur had shown what fermentation really meant. Since that time, the progress in dairying has been continuous, and, during recent years, attention has been directed to soured milk to such an extent that it has become necessary for all who are interested in the handling of milk and milk products to have a knowledge of the subject, as it seems clearly demonstrated that, under proper direction, there is every possibility of its forming an important element in the prolongation of life.     CHAPTER II  FERMENTED MILKS   There is considerable variety in the number of soured or fermented milks, and they are known by various names, such as Koumiss or Koomiss, which is prepared from mares' milk; Keffir, which was originally discovered in the mountains of the Caucasus, and which is prepared with Keffir grains; Leben, an Egyptian product prepared from the milk of the buffalo, cow, or goat; Matzoon, a soured milk which is prepared in Armenia from ordinary cows' milk; Dadhi, an Indian preparation from cows' milk. All of these owe their special characteristics to the fact of their having undergone lactic and alcoholic fermentation.  \"Milk left to itself,\" says Blyth,[14] \"at all temperatures above 90° F. begins to evolve carbon dioxide, and this is simply a sign and result of fermentation. If this fermentation is arrested or prevented, the fluid remains perfectly sweet and good for an indefinite time. Besides the production of carbon dioxide during decomposition, a certain portion of milk sugar is converted into lactic acid, some of the casein and albumen are broken up into simpler constituents, and a small proportion of alcohol produced, which by oxidation appears as acetic acid, while the fat is in part separated into free fatty acids, which ultimately unite with the ammonia produced by the breaking up of the albuminoids. The main fermentation of milk is a special kind which of late years has been much studied, and is known as _lactic fermentation_. Accompanying lactic fermentation there is nearly always a weak butyric and a weak alcoholic fermentation.\"  One of the organisms causing _Butyric Acid Fermentation_ is a bacillus 3 to 10µ in length, and about 1µ in breadth. It has power of movement, and when cultivated in gelatine, liquefies the gelatine, forming a scum on the surface. When the bacillus is sown into sterile milk, the following, according to Hueppe, are the changes:  \"If the milk thus infected is incubated, on the second day a clear, slightly yellow fluid is seen under the layer of cream; this fluid increases from day to day, so that gradually a column of fluid is formed which is quite clear above, but below is turbid; the casein, at first thrown down in a firm coagulum, in the course of eight days begins to be attacked, and by the end of two or three weeks most of it is dissolved. The filtered fluid gives the biuret reaction; it contains leucin, tyrosin, and ammonia; hence it is clear that the ferment acts to some extent as a digestive of albumen. In advanced butyric acid fermentation, the fluid is most offensive, and may have an alkaline reaction.\"  Lactic acid was first isolated by Scheele in 1780 from soured milk, but its"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31703"],["title","'Mid Pleasures and Palaces (#1)"],["body","!\"         *       *       *       *       *  Loren's mouth showed a faint surface of his yellow teeth. He shook his head, slowly, back and forth, his fingers tightening about the animal's neck.  \"Harry, listen,\" Kirk said, watching Loren's squeezing fingers, \"it's over now. You don't have to wait any longer. I'll take you back now. I'll take you home!\"  Loren froze, staring. \"Home?\" he said.  \"That's right,\" Kirk said. \"That's right, Harry.\"  \"_Home_,\" Loren breathed, and his eyes were suddenly like a child's, wide and unbelieving.  \"The waiting's all over,\" Kirk said. \"You don't have to wait any longer.\"  \"I don't have to wait any longer,\" Loren repeated softly, and his hand dropped from the neck of the animal.  Kirk watched Loren and the swaying animal. \"The rocket's ready,\" he said.  Loren's eyes were lost in some distant memory. Gradually Kirk could see the eyes turn shiny with tears. \"Is Annette waiting?\" he asked.  Kirk thought quickly. He knew that what he was going to say shouldn't be said, because he had no right. But he was thinking of his own skin. \"Why, yes, Harry,\" he said slowly. \"I imagine Annette _is_ waiting.\"  Loren let a quick breath come through his teeth. \"Annette,\" he whispered. \"And Dickie?\"  \"Dickie?\" Kirk said.  \"Little Dickie?\" Loren said and he held his breath.  \"Oh, yes,\" Kirk lied. \"Of course.\"  \"I can't ask about Eddie, because we never had the chance,\" Loren said, his eyes still lost. \"I always told Annette that no kid should ever grow up without a brother, only we never had the chance for Eddie.\" Loren reached out absently and touched the brown and yellow neck of the creature. \"I called this fellow Eddie, though. Do you suppose that was all right? He's not very pretty.\"  Kirk nodded, looking at the waving, funnel-shaped head of the animal. \"That was all right, Harry.\"  \"Does she still braid her hair?\" Loren asked, his eyes shiny.  \"What?\" Kirk said.  \"Annette. Does she still braid her hair?\"  \"Why,\" Kirk said slowly, feeling his palms going moist. \"Why wouldn't she, Harry?\"  A faint smile flickered across Loren's lips as he remembered.  Kirk watched one of the creature's claws, out of the corners of his eyes. He opened and closed the fingers of one hand, testing. The claw jerked slightly.  The blood of Kirk's new wound was drying, he knew, because it had been only a surface cut. He wondered how it would be if the thing used its claws with serious intent. Like it must have to make the cut that had been raked into Loren's back. Loren was bending forward now, and Kirk could see the tip end of that scar. Somehow Loren had managed to stay alive and befriend the creature. Eddie. The lidless eyes stared.  Kirk knew that he had to make use of the moment. It could break apart any time, the wildness could return, the unreasoning....  \"Listen, Harry,\" he said, \"we ought to get started, you know. There's no use waiting longer.\"  \"Started?\" Loren said.  \"Of course,\" Kirk said, trying to keep his voice matter-of-fact. \"You're going home.\"  Loren looked at Kirk and his eyes turned suddenly hard and his mouth lost the faint smile. \"I am,\" he stated flatly.  \"Yes,\" Kirk said. \"Of course.\"  \"You're a liar.\"  \"Now, Harry,\" Kirk said, his eyes flickering to the waiting animal. \"I surely wouldn't lie to you.\"  \"You haven't come for me until after all this time, and now you say you surely wouldn't lie to me.\"  It was like standing in a gully, Kirk thought, watching a boulder teetering above you. It tipped this way and that, and you didn't know when or if it was going to come hurtling down. You waited. But Kirk couldn't wait, he knew. He had to do something.  \"Harry, listen. It wasn't easy to find you, don't you see?\" He hoped he was making it sound as though all he had done for the last dozen years of exploring was look for Harry Loren. He wished that the damned thing would stop swaying its ugly head back and forth. Loren's hand was inching out toward the yellow and brown neck.  \"Look, Harry, these things aren't done in a day. We--\"  \"A day!\" Loren hissed. \"A _day_! All this time and you say a _day_!\"  \"No, I'm sorry,\" Kirk said quickly. He wished he could shift out of the cramped half-lying position he was in. \"I didn't mean a day, Harry. I meant it wasn't easy. We didn't know where you were--\" He was talking quickly, whining almost, and he'd never whined before.  Loren's fingers were touching the waving neck.  \"We'd better hurry,\" Kirk said desperately. \"Annette's waiting. And Dickie, of course.\"  Loren blinked.  \"You wouldn't want to keep them waiting any longer, not after all this time, Harry.\"  Loren stroked his fingers slowly down the long neck of the animal.  \"I think,\" Kirk said, almost hoarsely, \"now that I really remember it, Annette _was_ still wearing her hair braided. I remember that now, Harry. Positively.\"  Loren froze the motion of his hand and stared at Kirk. His lips trembled, and then suddenly he put his hands in front of his face. He bent forward, and Kirk felt his nerves jumping, watching the man start to cry.  The animal turned its stare away from Kirk for the first time. It looked at Loren and then slowly raised a claw, touching Loren's shoulder carefully. It made a sound then, a peculiar hissing sound, soft, barely audible. There was no danger in it, or menace, only a pitiful sound.  Loren raised his head a little and brought his hands away from his face. Tears had cut through dust and grime and his face was streaked.  \"Shall we go, Harry?\" Kirk said.  Loren wiped at his eyes, stupidly, without knowing what he was doing. Then he brought his hands down and wiped them across his chest.  \"All right,\" he said. \"Let's go.\" He picked up Kirk's pistol from where he had dropped it on the ground and held it out.  Kirk looked at the gun and at the animal. The claw had been drawn away from Loren's shoulder and again it was poised, ready. \"You keep it, Harry,\" he said.  \"Oh, yes. Of course,\" Loren said. There was a moment of silence as Loren stuck the pistol absently into the waist of his ragged cloth covering, beside the knife. The three of them waited then, Kirk, Loren, and the animal.  \"Eddie?\" Loren said finally. \"Are you ready?\"         *       *       *       *       *  Kirk felt himself smiling in the direction of the animal. He remembered when he was a small boy, going by a house where there had been a mongrel with a flat head and large teeth. He had smiled at that animal as he was doing now. The dog had sensed his fear in spite of the smile.  Loren was standing up slowly, and the animal's head swayed in slow circling motions.  \"All right?\" Loren said.  Kirk glanced at the man, saw the wild, nearly vacant look of the face, the polite tilt of the head. Kirk's palms were wet. Goddamn it, he thought, and he stood up suddenly.  The animal extended a claw, slowly, turning it so that it seemed to wind and circle as it came toward Kirk.  \"_Eddie_,\" Loren said.  The claw came away. Kirk caught his breath.  \"Shall we go?\" Loren said, his eyes shining.  \"Yes,\" Kirk said. \"We'll go, Harry.\" He turned slowly, so that his back was to Loren and the animal. He thought about the comb-like claws and the scar on Loren's back. He thought about Loren's knife and about the pistol.  He wanted to look back as he walked. He wanted to talk, to hear Loren's answer and so know just where he was. More than anything he wanted to break into a run and get into that rocket and get out of here.  He could see the gleam of the rocket finally, but he didn't look back yet. He kept moving. As he got closer he could see Leo, standing near the base of the ship, tall, leaning carelessly against the silver surface, smoking. He wanted to shout to Leo, to tell him for God's sake to wake up and protect him.  They reached the edge of the clearing and Leo, whose careless body had stiffened, waited motionless, one hand on his pistol. Kirk stopped. \"There it is, Harry,\" he said, not turning around. \"There's the ship.\" He waited, half-closing his eyes, breathing slowly.  There was no sound.  \"That's Leo, my friend, Harry,\" Kirk said, putting his palms flat against his thighs. \"Your friend, Harry.\"  Leo, Kirk could see, was still frozen, his eyes slitted to narrow brightness. Kirk began to step into the clearing. \"Hello, there, Leo,\" he said, his voice a tense, grating sound. \"I've brought some friends.\"  Leo was lifting his pistol out of its holster, inchingly.  \"_Friends_,\" Kirk rasped.  Leo's thin eyes flickered and the pistol slid back into the holster.  Kirk turned around slowly, and he saw that Loren had stopped just inside the clearing. The animal remained beside him, its head making its slow circles. Loren was staring up at the rocket and the sun reflecting from the bright surface, came down and shown on Loren's face, deepening the lines there.  \"Leo,\" Kirk said slowly, \"this is Harry Loren and his friend, Eddie. Harry's been here quite a while, waiting for us.\"  \"Oh, yes?\" said Leo, still not moving.  \"That's right, Leo,\" Kirk said. \"Quite a while. What year was it, Harry?\" he said across the clearing. \"What year did you crash?\"  Loren blinked and there were tears again in his eyes. He reached out slowly, and the animal shifted so that its head touched Loren's hand. \"Twenty-four-nineteen.\"  Kirk put his teeth together. \"Twenty-four-nineteen,\" he said.  Loren nodded slowly, his eyes still upon the rocket.  \"Eighteen years,\" Leo said softly.  \"A long time, Leo,\" Kirk said. He thought of a girl with her hair braided about her head, looking up, while Loren had shot into the depths of sky and space. He thought of a little boy called Dickie, standing there, too, watching a fast-disappearing blackness in the sky. He thought about eighteen years, and the fading of youth. A boy becoming a man. Braided hair becoming gray. Memories fading and minds adjusting. New love, new dedication. A world shifting, a universe shifting.  Kirk looked at Eddie, the animal, real and alive, waiting patiently at the tips of Loren's fingers. \"Eddie's"]]]
