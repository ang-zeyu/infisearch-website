Acad. Nat. Sci.      Philadelphia, 6:242, 1853. (Type probably from the vicinity      of Mason, Mason County, Texas.)       _Peromyscus leucopus texanus_ Osgood, N. Amer. Fauna,      28:127, April 17, 1909.       _Specimens examined_, 8 as follows: 7 km. S and 2 km. W San      Fernando, 1; 12 km. N and 4 km. W Ciudad Victoria, 2; 70 km.      [by highway] S Ciudad Victoria and 2 km. W El Carrizo, 4.   ~Peromyscus ochraventer~ new species  Brown-bellied Wood Mouse       _Type._--Female, adult, skin and skull; no. 36958, Univ.      Kansas Mus. Nat. Hist.; 70 km. [by highway] S Ciudad      Victoria and 6 km. W of the [Pan-American] highway [at El      Carrizo], Tamaulipas, Mexico; 12 January 1950; obtained by      William J. Schaldach, Jr., original no. 566.       _Range._--Known only from the type locality; probably found      in other localities along the humid, east face of the Sierra      Madre Oriental in Tamaulipas.       _Diagnosis._--Size medium (see measurements); upper parts      near Ochraceous Tawny (capitalized color terms after      Ridgway, Color Standards and Color Nomenclature, Washington,      D. C., 1912), brighter on sides and duller on back; cheeks,      sides of neck, shoulders and upper forelegs lighter, between      Ochraceous Buff and Ochraceous Orange; eye ring dark;      underparts light Cinnamon Buff, breast patch brighter; ears      dusky, sparsely covered with hairs colored like back; feet      white; tail scaly in appearance, indistinctly bicolored with      short dark hairs above and short pale hairs below; skull      without beaded or ridged supraorbital border; rostrum      expanded anteriorly with sides almost parallel; teeth with      strongly developed outer accessory cusps on the first and      second upper molar teeth; anteriormost loph      (parastyle-protoconule of Goldman, N. Amer. Fauna, 43:11,      September 23, 1918) of the first upper molar large, almost      as broad as greatest breadth of tooth.       _Comparisons._--_Peromyscus ochraventer_ has been compared      with _P. difficilis_ (specimens from Veracruz), _P. boylei_      (Veracruz), _P. banderanus_ (Guerrero), _P. mexicanus_      (Veracruz), _P. furvus_ (Veracruz), and _P. latirostris_      (San Luis Potosí). From _P. difficilis_, _P. ochraventer_      differs in having underparts distinctively brownish, rostrum      expanded anteriorly with sides almost parallel, anteriormost      loph of the first upper molar larger, and auditory bulla      smaller. From _P. boylei_, _P. ochraventer_ differs in      having underparts distinctively brownish, tail less      distinctly bicolored, rostrum expanded anteriorly with sides      almost parallel, and anteriormost loph of the first upper      molar larger. From _P. banderanus_, _P. ochraventer_ differs      in having underparts distinctively brownish, tail less      distinctly bicolored, rostrum expanded anteriorly with sides      almost parallel, anteriormost loph of the first upper molar      larger, auditory bulla smaller, and in lacking a beaded or      ridged supraorbital border. From _P. mexicanus_, _P.      ochraventer_ differs in having underparts distinctively      brownish, tail not irregularly blotched with dusky, rostrum      expanded anteriorly with sides almost parallel, anteriormost      loph of the first upper molar larger, and in lacking a      beaded or ridged supraorbital border. From _P. furvus_ and      _P. latirostris_, _P. ochraventer_ differs in being smaller,      having underparts distinctively brownish, tail not      irregularly blotched with dusky, rostrum proportionately      shorter, and interpterygoid space relatively narrower.  _Remarks._--_Peromyscus ochraventer_ is considered to be a distinct species showing little evident relationship with other Mexican _Peromyscus_. In the shape of the skull, especially the anterior expansion of the rostrum, _P. ochraventer_ seems to be related to _P. furvus_ and _P. latirostris_, a series of the latter being made available for examination by Dr. George G. Lowery, Jr., of the Museum of Zoology at Louisiana State University. However, the rostrum of these two larger species is proportionately longer than the rostrum of _P. ochraventer_. In size, coloration and most cranial features, _P. ochraventer_ resembles _P. mexicanus_, although the absence, instead of presence, of a supraorbital bead or ridge, the almost parallel-sided, instead of more pointed, rostrum and the larger, instead of smaller, interiormost loph of the first upper molar in _P. ochraventer_ are well-marked differences. The baculum of _P. ochraventer_ is much shorter with a proportionately heavier base and shaft than the baculum of _P. mexicanus mexicanus_ (from Veracruz) and _P. m. saxatilis_ (from Costa Rica). The geographic range of _Peromyscus ochraventer_ is not known to meet that of _P. mexicanus_; the nearest place to the type locality of _P. ochraventer_ from which _P. mexicanus_ has been taken is at Xilitla approximately 225 kilometers to the southward in San Luis Potosí (Dalquest, Occ. Papers Mus. Zool., Louisiana State Univ., No. 28:8, July 10, 1950).  The brown coloring on the underparts is a distinctive feature of _P. ochraventer_; in adults this color differs in shade. In some specimens patches of whitish hair give the tail a splotched appearance. Eleven of the twenty-eight skulls and lower jaws examined have bone eroded away from around the cheek-teeth exposing part of the roots. Most of the fully adult animals have this condition. One adult female, no. 36959, has the upper third molar on the right side missing, possibly as a result of bone erosion.  These mice were taken in junglelike forest, in rocks and adjacent to logs. Schaldach writes that \"Their burrows go back under the large limestone blocks, and each burrow where I caught a mouse has a pile of excavated earth, like a tiny gopher mound.\" The trapping area was at an elevation of approximately 2800 feet on the steep sides of a small hill on top of which the field camp was situated. Schaldach indicated that this locality was transitional between arid tropical and humid tropical conditions. On January 13, 1950, a female taken was lactating and had five recent placental scars; another taken the same day also had five placental scars.       _Measurements._--Average and extreme measurements of seven      adult males and six adult females of _P. ochraventer_ from      the type locality are, respectively, as follows: Total      length, 238.0 (227-249), 236.5 (226-248); length of tail,      124.4 (117-127), 122.2 (116-128); length of hind foot, 25.6      (24-26), 25.5 (25-26); length of ear from notch, 20.9      (20-21), 20.7 (20-21); greatest length of skull, 31.0      (30.6-31.9), 30.8 (30.5-31.0); basilar length, 23.3      (22.7-23.8), 23.4 (23.0-23.9); zygomatic breadth, 15.1      (14.6-15.7), 15.0 (14.9-15.2); post palatal length, 10.6      (10.5-10.9), 10.9 (10.5-11.2); interorbital breadth, 4.7      (4.5-4.9), 4.7 (4.6-4.8); mastoidal breadth, 12.8      (12.4-13.2), 12.8 (12.6-12.9); length of nasals, 11.6      (10.8-12.0), 11.6 (11.2-11.7); length of shelf of bony      palate, 4.7 (4.5-4.8), 4.6 (4.5-4.7); length of palatine      slits, 6.3 (6.0-6.5), 6.2 (6.0-6.4); length of diastema, 8.2      (8.0-8.5), 8.2 (8.1-8.4); alveolar length of upper      molariform tooth-row, 4.4 (4.3-4.6), 4.4 (4.3-4.5).       _Specimens examined_, 28, from the type locality.   ~Oryzomys couesi aquaticus~ Allen  Coues Rice Rat       _Oryzomys aquaticus_ Allen, Bull. Amer. Mus. Nat. Hist.,      3:289, June 30, 1891. (Type from Brownsville, Cameron      County, Texas.)       _Oryzomys couesi aquaticus_ Goldman, N. Amer. Fauna, 43:39,      September 23, 1918.       _Specimens examined_, 2 as follows: 36 km. N and 10 km. W      Ciudad Victoria, 1 km. E El Barretal, on Río Purificacíon,      1; 70 km. [by highway] S Ciudad Victoria and 6 km. W of the      [Pan-American] highway [at El Carrizo], 1.  _Remarks._--The specimens, all immatures, are slightly darker than topotypes of _O. c. aquaticus_, seemingly tending toward the darker _O. c. peragrus_ Merriam to the southward. These records of occurrence extend the known range of this subspecies approximately 210 miles to the southward and increase the possibility of continuous distribution between _O. c. aquaticus_ and _O. c. peragrus_.  The male obtained south of Ciudad Victoria was taken on January 12, by William J. Shaldach, Jr., 200 yards within the tunnel of a mine at an elevation of approximately 2600 feet. This was in the Sierra Gorda, which is a part of the Sierra Madre Oriental.   ~Oryzomys rostratus rostratus~ Merriam  Rice Rat       _Oryzomys rostratus_ Merriam, Proc. Washington Acad. Sci.,      3:293, July 26, 1901. (Type from Metlaltoyuca, Pueblo,      Mexico.)       _Specimen examined_, 1 from 70 km. [by highway] S Ciudad      Victoria and 2 km. W El Carrizo.  _Remarks._--This immature male is paler than specimens of _O. r. rostratus_ from the state of Veracruz. This locality extends the known range of this species northward a distance of approximately 100 miles. Previously it had been recorded from only as far north as Alta Mira, Tamaulipas (Goldman, N. Amer. Fauna, 43:54, September 23, 1918). This specimen was trapped on February 16 in a rodent runway in dense grass in a fallow cane field.   ~Oryzomys fulvescens engraciae~ Osgood  Fulvous Rice Rat       _Oryzomys fulvescens engraciae_ Osgood, Jour. Mamm., 26:300,      November 14, 1945. (Type from Hacienda Santa Engracia,      northwest of Ciudad Victoria, Tamaulipas, Mexico.)       _Specimens examined_, 5 from 70 km. [by highway] S Ciudad      Victoria and 2 km. E El Carrizo.  _Remarks._--These specimens are referred to _O. f. engraciae_ on the basis of their pale color and narrow interorbital space. They were taken in runways in dense grass in fallow cane fields.   ~Sigmodon"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31448"],["title","Mammals from Tamaulipas, Mexico (#2)"],["body","toltecus~ (Saussure)  Hispid Cotton Rat       [_Hesperomys_] _toltecus_ Saussure, Revue et magasin de      zoologie, _ser._ 2, 12:98, 1860. (Type from mountains of      Veracruz, Mexico.)       _Sigmodon hispidus toltecus_ Bailey, Proc. Biol. Soc.      Washington, 15:110, June 2, 1902.       _Specimens examined_, 23 as follows: 36 km. N and 10 km. W      Ciudad Victoria, 1 km. E El Barretal, on Río Purificacíon,      1; 70 km. [by highway] S Ciudad Victoria and 2 km. W El      Carrizo, 22.  _Remarks._--Among named kinds of _Sigmodon_ this series most closely approaches _S. h. toltecus_ to the southward. The specimens are slightly lighter in color of the upper parts than are examples of this same subspecies from 8 km. NW of Potrero, Veracruz, but in other ways are similar. The single specimen from 36 km. N and 10 km. W Ciudad Victoria is a skull only, but seems closest to _S. h. toltecus_. As is often the case with collections of _Sigmodon_, this series contains mostly immatures.  Cotton rats were found abundantly in cultivated areas. Local farmers stated that these rats were destructive to sugar cane by girdling the stems one and one-half inches above the ground.   ~Neotoma micropus micropus~ Baird  Baird Wood Rat       _Neotoma micropus_ Baird, Proc. Acad. Nat. Sci.      Philadelphia, p. 333, April, 1855. (Type from Charco      Escondido, Tamaulipas, Mexico.)       _Specimens examined_, 2 from 7 km. S and 2 km. W San      Fernando.   ~Neotoma angustapalata~ new species  Tamaulipan Wood Rat       _Type._--Male, subadult, skin and skull; No. 36976, Univ.      Kansas Mus. Nat. Hist.; 70 km. [by highway] S Ciudad      Victoria and 6 km. W of the [Pan-American] highway [at El      Carrizo], Tamaulipas, Mexico; 14 January 1950; obtained by      William J. Schaldach, Jr., original no. 578.       _Range._--Known only from the type locality; probably found      in other localities along the humid, east face of the Sierra      Madre Oriental in Tamaulipas.       _Diagnosis._--Size large (see measurements); upper parts      dusky brown, paler on sides, individual hairs on middle of      back tipped with black or with Light Pinkish Cinnamon      (capitalized color term after Ridgway, Color Standards and      Color Nomenclature, Washington, D. C., 1912); head grayer      especially on cheeks; underparts dusky (dark bases of      white-tipped hairs exposed), hairs on throat and inguinal      region of adult specimen white to base; outside of legs      dusky gray; tail scaly in appearance and sparsely covered      with short, blackish hairs above and short, whitish hairs      below; skull with auditory bulla large; external auditory      meatus large; palatine region narrow; sides of      interpterygoid fossa concave and broadly excavated near      posterior end of molariform tooth-rows.       _Comparison._--_Neotoma angustapalata_ has been compared      with _N. torquata_ (specimens from Veracruz and Puebla), _N.      navus_ (Coahuila), _N. mexicana_ (New Mexico), _N. micropus_      (Tamaulipas), _N. albigula_ (Coahuila), _N. ferruginea_      (Jalisco), and _N. distincta_ (from published description in      Goldman, N. Amer. Fauna, 31:64, October 19, 1910). _Neotoma      angustapalata_ differs from _N. micropus_ and _N. albigula_      in having a deep, instead of a shallow, anterointernal      reentrant angle on the first upper molar and seems to belong      to the _N. mexicana_ group of wood rats. _Neotoma      angustapalata_ differs from _N. navus_, _N. mexicana_, _N.      torquata_, and _N. ferruginea_ in larger size, darker      underparts, tail with sparse, short hairs and scaly      appearance, more broadly concave sides of interpterygoid      fossa at posterior end of molariform tooth-rows, larger      external auditory meatus, and narrower palatine breadth.      _Neotoma angustapalata_ differs from the description of _N.      distincta_ in having a faintly bicolored tail, no ochraceous      pectoral band, broadly concave sides to interpterygoid      fossa, and narrower palatine breadth.  _Remarks._--_Neotoma angustapalata_ is represented by two specimens; the type and another specimen, an adult male, no. 37062, with skin and broken skull. The description takes into account both of these specimens. The most significant characteristics of _N. angustapalata_ are its scaly-appearing tail with short, sparse hairs, dusky underparts, broadly concave sides of the interpterygoid fossa at the posterior end of molariform tooth-rows, and the narrow palatine breadth. Among named kinds of _Neotoma_, the newly named species most closely resembles _N. torquata_ and _N. distincta_; however, it is geographically widely separated from these two species. _Neotoma navus_ of southeastern Coahuila is the only other member of the _N. mexicana_ group in northeastern Mexico.  These wood rats were taken in rocks and crevices at the base of a small hill in thick vegetation growing in deep humus. Schaldach termed the trapping site as \"arid tropical tending toward humid tropical\".       _Measurements._--The subadult, male holotype measures as      follows: Total length, 325; length of tail, 154; length of      hind foot, 36; length of ear from notch, 29; basilar length      (of skull), 33.9; zygomatic breadth, 22.1; interorbital      breadth, 5.7; length of nasals, 15.2; length of incisive      foramina, 8.7; length of palatal bridge, 8.5; least breadth      of palate between first upper molars, 2.7; greatest breadth      of interpterygoid space, 4.1; alveolar length of upper      molariform tooth-row, 9.6. The adult, male, no. 37062,      measures as follows: Total length, 380; tail vertebrae, 195;      hind foot, 42; ear from notch, 31; interorbital breadth (of      skull), 6.4.       _Specimens examined_, 2, from the type locality.   ~Rattus rattus~ subsp.  Black Rat       _Specimens taken_, 2 from 70 km. [by highway] S Ciudad      Victoria and 6 km. W of the [Pan-American] highway [at El      Carrizo].   ~Mus musculus~ subsp.  House Mouse       _Specimen examined_, 1 from 12 km. N and 4 km. W Ciudad      Victoria.   ~Nasua narica tamaulipensis~ Goldman  Coati       _Nasua narica tamaulipensis_ Goldman, Proc. Biol. Soc.      Washington, 55:80, June 25, 1942. (Type from Cerro de la      Silla, near Monterrey, Nuevo Leon, Mexico.)       _Specimen examined_, 1 from 70 km. [by highway] S Ciudad      Victoria and 2 km. W El Carrizo.  _Remarks._--Several bands of coatis were observed in the vicinity of the village of El Carrizo. One skull of a male was obtained.   _Transmitted June 8, 1951_.   23-8338            *       *       *       *       *  Transcriber's Notes  Italicized text is shown within _underscores_.
