The specimens of _L. c. curti_ are all females, which, in the genus _Lepus_, average larger than the males. Comparison of the measurements recorded below with those in the account by Nelson (N. Amer. Fauna, 29:129, 1909) may not reveal the full measure of difference in size between _L. c. curti_ and other subspecies because Nelson (_op. cit._) pooled males and females in obtaining the average measurements that he records. For example, he used three males and two females of _Lepus altamirae_ in obtaining an average (_op. cit._:117). The specimens of _L. c. curti_ here recorded are thought to be of full size inasmuch as the degree of fusion of bones in the skull, and the density of the cranial bones indicate full adulthood for each specimen. Reproductive-wise, there is no question as to adulthood; each of the four females was pregnant. One specimen had two embryos (each 30 millimeters long in crown-rump measurement) and each of the other specimens contained one embryo. These three embryos were 55, 60, and 105 mm. long.  Three of our specimens, including the holotype, were obtained north of the eighth pass and the other specimen, No. 35473, was obtained a few hundred yards south of the pass. Because the part of the barrier beach south of the pass was connected to the mainland, it is likely that the newly named subspecies occurs also on the adjacent mainland; however, we have examined no specimens of _Lepus californicus_ from the opposite mainland except from Matamoros, ninety miles to the north, and from Altamira, approximately one hundred and fifty miles south of our collecting locality. A specimen from Matamoros, Tamaulipas, and several from Brownsville, Texas, in size of auditory bullae, larger overall size and darker color clearly are _L. c. merriami_ and not _L. c. curti_.  The small tympanic bullae of the specimens from Padre Island were commented upon by Nelson (_op. cit._:149) who found smallness of bullae to characterize many of the specimens from the eastern part of the geographic range of _L. c. merriami_. In the northeastern part of the geographic range of _L. c. merriami_, as Nelson pointed out, the small size of the tympanic bullae was one of several evidences of intergradation there with _Lepus californicus melanotis_, the subspecies next adjacent to the north. In the light of present information, it seems that the smallness of the tympanic bullae in the specimens (3) from Padre Island may be an independent development--an adaptation to environmental conditions that reaches its fullest development on the same chain of islands eighty-odd miles southward of Matamoros. The specimens from Padre Island, although possessing small bullae, in other features, for example, larger size of other parts, are _merriami_.  The four specimens of _L. c. curti_ are in worn winter pelage and the new pelage is coming in on the thighs. Most of the specimens (6) of the _L. c. altamirae_ are in the same condition of pelage. In color and color pattern, the two subspecies are, to me, indistinguishable except that the black patch on the nape is less widely and less definitely separated into two parts by a median, longitudinal, band of buffy color.  _Lepus californicus altamirae_ was named by Nelson (Proc. Biol. Soc. Washington, 17:109, May 18, 1904) as a black-tailed jack rabbit, _Lepus merriami altamirae_, but was later transferred by Nelson (N. Amer. Fauna, 29:124, 1909) to the white-sided section of the genus and arranged as a full species, _Lepus altamirae_. In making this transfer, Nelson (_op. cit._:125) wrote that in \"This well marked species ... the lack of a black patch on the posterior half of the ear at the tip and the white flanks (somewhat obscured in some of the original specimens) are strong characters which place it in the _callotis_ group.\" \"Posterior half of ears white without any trace of black at tip\", was the way Nelson (_op. cit._:124) described the ears in _L. altamirae_. My examination of the original series including the type, reveals that the ears do have some black at the tip of the posterior half in three of the specimens, some brown in one other specimen, and only a dusky tinge in two others. In the four specimens of _L. c. curti_ the tip of the ear is faintly brownish in one animal and dusky in three. The extent of the white flanks seems to be identical in the two series. Fortunately they are in the same pelage and same stage of molt on the hind legs. The one difference that I can detect is in the coloration of the nape. In each of the specimens of _L. altamirae_ the coloration is as described by Nelson (_op. cit._:124): \"nape with two lateral black bands extending back from base of ears, and separated by a median band of buffy.\" In _L. c. curti_ the nape is all black in one specimen and the median band of buffy is present in the other three but is narrower and more dusky than in _L. altamirae_. Since the characters (color of tip of ear and extent of white on the flank) relied upon by Nelson for placing _L. altamirae_ in the _callotis_ group are duplicated in the _californicus_ group, in _L. c. curti_, there is reason for questioning whether _altamirae_ is correctly placed, taxonomically, in the _L. callotis_ group.  Cursory examination of skulls of the _callotis_ group and the _californicus_ group indicates that the prepalatal spine (the part of the palate which extends anteriorly toward the vomer) is longer in _L. californicus_ than in _L. callotis_, _L. gaillardi_ and _L. alleni_. In this feature, _L. altamirae_ agrees with _Lepus californicus_ and differs from members of the _Lepus callotis_ group. Furthermore, the newly named _L. c. curti_, in color of ear and color of nape, is intermediate between _L. altamirae_ and _L. c. merriami_. Consequently, _Lepus merriami altamirae_ Nelson, it seems, should stand as _Lepus californicus altamirae_.  Mention should be made here of the view of Shamel (Proc. Biol. Soc. Washington, 55:25-26, May 12, 1942) that the _californicus_ group should be divided into two groups (each group possibly amounting to something more than a species and something less than a subgenus) on the basis of a white rump and complex infolding of the enamel layer of the front of the first upper incisor _versus_ a dark rump and simple infolding of the mentioned layer of enamel. He placed _Lepus californicus merriami_ Mearns, among other subspecies, in a group different from the one in which he placed several other subspecies of _Lepus californicus_.  Specimens (skulls with accompanying skins) of the species _Lepus californicus_ in the Biological Surveys Collection of the United States National Museum, representative of a gradual transition from the dark rump and simple fold in the enamel to the white rump and complex fold in the enamel are as follows: _L. c. deserticola_, No. 29733/41808, Paharanagat Valley, Nevada; Nos. 117463 and 156744, Beals Spring, Arizona. _L. c. texianus_, No. 24635/32031, Springerville, Arizona; No. 97453, Roswell, New Mexico; No. 118751, Toyah, Texas; No. 118749, Valentine, Texas; and No. 108700, Terlingua Creek, Texas. In the continuously distributed species _Lepus californicus_, along the northwest to southeast line provided by the localities of occurrence listed immediately above, there is a gradual transition from one kind of fold to the other kind and from one color of rump to the other color. It is clear that Shamel (_op. cit._) was in error in his conclusions; the kinds of black-tailed jack rabbits to which Shamel (_op. cit._) applied the name _Macrotolagus_ should stand as given below.

We don't know what we would be getting into. They must have patrols. They probably have seen us already, for that matter.\"  \"They probably have seen the ship itself,\" Tance said. \"They probably know right now where they can find it, where they can blow it up. So what difference does it make whether we go closer or not?\"  \"That's true,\" Nasha said. \"If they really want to get us we haven't a chance. We have no armaments at all; you know that.\"  \"I have a hand weapon.\" Dorle nodded. \"Well, let's go on, then. I suppose you're right, Tance.\"  \"But let's stay together,\" Tance said nervously. \"Nasha, you're going too fast.\"  Nasha looked back. She laughed. \"If we expect to get there by nightfall we must go fast.\"         *       *       *       *       *  They reached the outskirts of the city at about the middle of the afternoon. The sun, cold and yellow, hung above them in the colorless sky. Dorle stopped at the top of a ridge overlooking the city.  \"Well, there it is. What's left of it.\"  There was not much left. The huge concrete piers which they had noticed were not piers at all, but the ruined foundations of buildings. They had been baked by the searing heat, baked and charred almost to the ground. Nothing else remained, only this irregular circle of white squares, perhaps four miles in diameter.  Dorle spat in disgust. \"More wasted time. A dead skeleton of a city, that's all.\"  \"But it was from here that the firing came,\" Tance murmured. \"Don't forget that.\"  \"And by someone with a good eye and a great deal of experience,\" Nasha added. \"Let's go.\"  They walked into the city between the ruined buildings. No one spoke. They walked in silence, listening to the echo of their footsteps.  \"It's macabre,\" Dorle muttered. \"I've seen ruined cities before but they died of old age, old age and fatigue. This was killed, seared to death. This city didn't die--it was murdered.\"  \"I wonder what the city was called,\" Nasha said. She turned aside, going up the remains of a stairway from one of the foundations. \"Do you think we might find a signpost? Some kind of plaque?\"  She peered into the ruins.  \"There's nothing there,\" Dorle said impatiently. \"Come on.\"  \"Wait.\" Nasha bent down, touching a concrete stone. \"There's something inscribed on this.\"  \"What is it?\" Tance hurried up. He squatted in the dust, running his gloved fingers over the surface of the stone. \"Letters, all right.\" He took a writing stick from the pocket of his pressure suit and copied the inscription on a bit of paper. Dorle glanced over his shoulder. The inscription was:      FRANKLIN APARTMENTS  \"That's this city,\" Nasha said softly. \"That was its name.\"  Tance put the paper in his pocket and they went on. After a time Dorle said, \"Nasha, you know, I think we're being watched. But don't look around.\"  The woman stiffened. \"Oh? Why do you say that? Did you see something?\"  \"No. I can feel it, though. Don't you?\"  Nasha smiled a little. \"I feel nothing, but perhaps I'm more used to being stared at.\" She turned her head slightly. \"Oh!\"  Dorle reached for his hand weapon. \"What is it? What do you see?\" Tance had stopped dead in his tracks, his mouth half open.  \"The gun,\" Nasha said. \"It's the gun.\"  \"Look at the size of it. The size of the thing.\" Dorle unfastened his hand weapon slowly. \"That's it, all right.\"  The gun was huge. Stark and immense it pointed up at the sky, a mass of steel and glass, set in a huge slab of concrete. Even as they watched the gun moved on its swivel base, whirring underneath. A slim vane turned with the wind, a network of rods atop a high pole.  \"It's alive,\" Nasha whispered. \"It's listening to us, watching us.\"  The gun moved again, this time clockwise. It was mounted so that it could make a full circle. The barrel lowered a trifle, then resumed its original position.  \"But who fires it?\" Tance said.  Dorle laughed. \"No one. No one fires it.\"  They stared at him. \"What do you mean?\"  \"It fires itself.\"  They couldn't believe him. Nasha came close to him, frowning, looking up at him. \"I don't understand. What do you mean, it fires itself?\"  \"Watch, I'll show you. Don't move.\" Dorle picked up a rock from the ground. He hesitated a moment and then tossed the rock high in the air. The rock passed in front of the gun. Instantly the great barrel moved, the vanes contracted.         *       *       *       *       *  The rock fell to the ground. The gun paused, then resumed its calm swivel, its slow circling.  \"You see,\" Dorle said, \"it noticed the rock, as soon as I threw it up in the air. It's alert to anything that flies or moves above the ground level. Probably it detected us as soon as we entered the gravitational field of the planet. It probably had a bead on us from the start. We don't have a chance. It knows all about the ship. It's just waiting for us to take off again.\"  \"I understand about the rock,\" Nasha said, nodding. \"The gun noticed it, but not us, since we're on the ground, not above. It's only designed to combat objects in the sky. The ship is safe until it takes off again, then the end will come.\"  \"But what's this gun for?\" Tance put in. \"There's no one alive here. Everyone is dead.\"  \"It's a machine,\" Dorle said. \"A machine that was made to do a job. And it's doing the job. How it survived the blast I don't know. On it goes, waiting for the enemy. Probably they came by air in some sort of projectiles.\"  \"The enemy,\" Nasha said. \"Their own race. It is hard to believe that they really bombed themselves, fired at themselves.\"  \"Well, it's over with. Except right here, where we're standing. This one gun, still alert, ready to kill. It'll go on until it wears out.\"  \"And by that time we'll be dead,\" Nasha said bitterly.  \"There must have been hundreds of guns like this,\" Dorle murmured. \"They must have been used to the sight, guns, weapons, uniforms. Probably they accepted it as a natural thing, part of their lives, like eating and sleeping. An institution, like the church and the state. Men trained to fight, to lead armies, a regular profession. Honored, respected.\"  Tance was walking slowly toward the gun, peering nearsightedly up at it. \"Quite complex, isn't it? All those vanes and tubes. I suppose this is some sort of a telescopic sight.\" His gloved hand touched the end of a long tube.  Instantly the gun shifted, the barrel retracting. It swung--  \"Don't move!\" Dorle cried. The barrel swung past them as they stood, rigid and still. For one terrible moment it hesitated over their heads, clicking and whirring, settling into position. Then the sounds died out and the gun became silent.  Tance smiled foolishly inside his helmet. \"I must have put my finger over the lens. I'll be more careful.\" He made his way up onto the circular slab, stepping gingerly behind the body of the gun. He disappeared from view.  \"Where did he go?\" Nasha said irritably. \"He'll get us all killed.\"  \"Tance, come back!\" Dorle shouted. \"What's the matter with you?\"  \"In a minute.\" There was a long silence. At last the archeologist appeared. \"I think I've found something. Come up and I'll show you.\"  \"What is it?\"  \"Dorle, you said the gun was here to keep the enemy off. I think I know why they wanted to keep the enemy off.\"  They were puzzled.  \"I think I've found what the gun is supposed to guard. Come and give me a hand.\"  \"All right,\" Dorle said abruptly. \"Let's go.\" He seized Nasha's hand. \"Come on. Let's see what he's found. I thought something like this might happen when I saw that the gun was--\"  \"Like what?\" Nasha pulled her hand away. \"What are you talking about? You act as if you knew what he's found.\"  \"I do.\" Dorle smiled down at her. \"Do you remember the legend that all races have, the myth of the buried treasure, and the dragon, the serpent that watches it, guards it, keeping everyone away?\"  She nodded. \"Well?\"  Dorle pointed up at the gun.  \"That,\" he said, \"is the dragon. Come on.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Between the three of them they managed to pull up the steel cover and lay it to one side. Dorle was wet with perspiration when they finished.  \"It isn't worth it,\" he grunted. He stared into the dark yawning hole. \"Or is it?\"  Nasha clicked on her hand lamp, shining the beam down the stairs. The steps were thick with dust and rubble. At the bottom was a steel door.  \"Come on,\" Tance said excitedly. He started down the stairs. They watched him reach the door and pull hopefully on it without success. \"Give a hand!\"  \"All right.\" They came gingerly after him. Dorle examined the door. It was bolted shut, locked. There was an inscription on the door but he could not read it.  \"Now what?\" Nasha said.  Dorle took out his hand weapon. \"Stand back. I can't think of any other way.\" He pressed the switch. The bottom of the door glowed red. Presently it began to crumble. Dorle clicked the weapon off. \"I think we can get through. Let's try.\"  The door came apart easily. In a few minutes they had carried it away in pieces and stacked the pieces on the first step. Then they went on, flashing the light ahead of them.  They were in a vault. Dust lay everywhere, on everything, inches thick. Wood crates lined the walls, huge boxes and crates, packages and containers. Tance looked around curiously, his eyes bright.  \"What exactly are all these?\" he murmured. \"Something valuable, I would think.\" He picked up a round drum and opened it. A spool fell to the floor, unwinding a black ribbon. He examined it, holding it up to the light.  \"Look at this!\"  They came around him. \"Pictures,\" Nasha said. \"Tiny pictures.\"  \"Records of some kind.\" Tance closed the spool up in the drum again. \"Look, hundreds of drums.\" He flashed the light around. \"And those crates. Let's open one.\"  Dorle was already prying at the wood. The wood had turned brittle and dry. He managed to pull a section away.  It was a picture. A boy in a blue garment, smiling pleasantly, staring ahead,"]]]
