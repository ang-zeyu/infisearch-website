The old man leaned back against the shelf behind the bar, trembling, two trickles of red running down his neck and staining his shirt collar--I could see he wanted to touch the places where he'd been shot, to see how bad they were or just to rub at the pain, but he was afraid to raise a hand. He just stood there, looking sick.  Buck was staring at the little man in town clothes, over by the window. The little man had reared back at the shots, and now he was sitting up in his chair, his eyes straight on Buck. The table in front of him was wet where he'd spilled his drink when he'd jumped.  Buck looked at the little guy's fancy clothes and small mustache and grinned. \"Come on,\" he said to me, and picked up his drink and started across the floor. \"Find out who the dude is.\"  He pulled out a chair and sat down--and I saw he was careful to sit facing the front door, and also where he could see out the window.  I pulled out another chair and sat.  \"Good shooting, huh?\" Buck asked the little guy.  \"Yes,\" said the little guy. \"Very fine shooting. I confess, it quite startled me.\"  Buck laughed harshly. \"Startled the old guy too....\" He raised his voice. \"Ain't that right, Menner? Wasn't you startled?\"  \"Yes, sir,\" came Menner's pain-filled voice from the bar.  Buck looked back at the little man--let his insolent gaze travel up and down the fancy waistcoat, the string tie, the sharp face with its mustache and narrow mouth and black eyes. He looked longest at the eyes, because they didn't seem to be scared.  He looked at the little guy, and the little guy looked at Buck, and finally Buck looked away. He tried to look wary as he did it, as if he was just fixing to make sure that nobody was around to sneak-shoot him--but you could see he'd been stared down.  When he looked back at the little guy, he was scowling. \"Who're you, mister?\" he said. \"I never seen you before.\"  \"My name is Jacob Pratt, sir. I'm just traveling through to San Francisco. I'm waiting for the evening stage.\"  \"Drummer?\"  \"Excuse me?\"  For a second Buck's face got ugly. \"You heard me, mister. You a drummer?\"  \"I heard you, young man, but I don't quite understand. Do you mean, am I a musician? A performer upon the drums?\"  \"No, you goddam fool--I mean, what're you selling? Snake-bite medicine? Likker? Soap?\"  \"Why--I'm not selling anything. I'm a professor, sir.\"  \"Well, I'll be damned.\" Buck looked at him a little more carefully. \"A perfessor, huh? Of what?\"  \"Of psychology, sir.\"  \"What's that?\"  \"It's the study of man's behavior--of the reasons why we act as we do.\"  Buck laughed again, and it was more of a snarl. \"Well, perfessor, you just stick around here then, and I'll show you some _real_ reasons for people acting as they do! From now on, I'm the big reason in this town ... they'll jump when I yell frog, or else!\"  His hand was flat on the table in front of him--and suddenly his Peacemaker was in it, pointing at the professor's fourth vest button. \"See what I mean huh?\"  The little man blinked. \"Indeed I do,\" he said, and stared at the gun as if hypnotized. Funny, though--he still didn't seem scared--just a lot interested.         *       *       *       *       *  Sitting there and just listening, I thought about something else funny--how they were both just about of a size, Buck and the professor, and so strong in different ways: with the professor, you felt he was strong inside--a man who knew a lot, about things and about himself--while with Buck it was all on the outside, on the surface: he was just a milksop kid with a deadly sting.  Buck was still looking at the professor, as carefully as he had before. He seemed to hesitate for a second, his mouth twisting. Then he said, \"You're an eddicated man, ain't you? I mean, you studied a lot. Ain't that right?\"  \"Yes, I suppose it is.\"  \"Well....\" Again Buck seemed to hesitate. The gun in his hand lowered until the end of the barrel rested on the table. \"Look,\" he said slowly, \"maybe you can tell me how in hell....\"  When he didn't go on, the professor said, \"Yes?\"  \"Nothing.\"  \"You were going to say--?\"  Buck looked at him, his bulging eyes narrowed, the gunman's smirk on his lips again. \"Are you telling me what's true and what ain't,\" he said softly, \"with my gun on you?\"  \"Does the gun change anything?\"  Buck tapped the heavy barrel on the table. \"I say it changes a hell of a lot of things.\" _Tap_ went the barrel. \"You wanta argue?\"  \"Not with the gun,\" the professor said calmly. \"It always wins. I'll talk with you, however, if you'll talk with your mouth instead of with the gun.\"         *       *       *       *       *  By this time I was filled with admiration for the professor's guts, and fear that he'd get a bullet in them ... I was all set to duck, in case Buck should lose his temper and start throwing lead.  But suddenly Buck's gun was back in his holster. I saw the professor blink again in astonishment.  \"You know,\" Buck said, grinning loosely, \"you got a lotta nerve, professor. Maybe you _can_ tell me what I wanta know.\"  He didn't look at the little man while he talked--he was glancing around, being \"wary\" again. And grinning that grin at the same time. You could see he was off-balance--he was acting like everything was going on just like he wanted it; but actually the professor had beaten him again, words against the gun, eyes against eyes.  The professor's dark eyes were level on Buck's right now. \"What is it you want to know?\"  \"This--\" Buck said, and his gun was in his hand again, and it was the first time when he did it that his face stayed sober and kind of stupid-looking, his normal expression, instead of getting wild and dangerous. \"How--do you know how do I do it?\"  \"Well,\" the professor said, \"suppose you give me your answer first, if you have one. It might be the right one.\"         *       *       *       *       *  \"I--\" Buck shook his head--\"Well, it's like I _think_ the gun into my hand. It happened the first time this morning. I was standing out in the Pass where I always practise drawing, and I was wishing I could draw faster'n anybody who ever lived--I was wishing I could just get my gun outa leather in no time atall. And--\" the gun was back in his holster in the blink of an eye--\"that's how it happened. My gun was in my hand. Just like that. I didn't even reach for it--I was just getting set to draw, and had my hand out in front of me ... and my gun was in my hand before I knew what'd happened. God, I was so surprised I almost fell over!\"  \"I see,\" said the professor slowly. \"You _think_ it into your hand?\"  \"Yeah, kind of.\"  \"Would you do it now, please?\" And the professor leaned forward so he could see Buck's holster, eyes intent.  Buck's gun appeared in his hand.  The professor let out a long breath. \"Now think it back into its holster.\"  It was there.  \"You did not move your arm either time,\" said the professor.  \"That's right,\" said Buck.  \"The gun was just suddenly in your hand instead of in your holster. And then it was back in the holster.\"  \"Right.\"  \"Telekinesis,\" said the professor, almost reverently.  \"Telewhat?\"  \"Telekinesis--the moving of material objects by mental force.\" The professor leaned back and studied the holstered gun. \"It _must_ be that. I hardly dared think if at first--the first time you did it. But the thought did occur to me. And now I'm virtually certain!\"  \"How do you say it?\"  \"T-e-l-e-k-i-n-e-s-i-s.\"  \"Well, how do I _do_ it?\"  \"I can't answer that. Nobody knows. It's been the subject of many experiments, and there are many reported happenings--but I've never heard of any instance even remotely as impressive as this.\" The professor leaned across the table again. \"Can you do it with other things, young man?\"  \"What other things?\"  \"That bottle on the bar, for example.\"  \"Never tried.\"  \"Try.\"  Buck stared at the bottle.  It wavered. Just a little. Rocked, and settled back.  Buck stared harder, eyes bulging.  The bottle shivered. That was all.  \"Hell,\" Buck said. \"I can't seem to--to get ahold of it with my mind, like I can with my gun.\"  \"Try moving this glass on the table,\" the professor said, \"It's smaller, and closer.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Buck stared at the glass. It moved a fraction of an inch across the tabletop. No more.  Buck snarled like a dog and swatted the glass with his hand, knocking it halfway across the room.  \"Possibly,\" the professor said, after a moment, \"you can do it with your gun because you want to so very badly. The strength of your desire releases--or creates--whatever psychic forces are necessary to perform the act.\" He paused, looking thoughtful. \"Young man, suppose you try to transport your gun to--say, to the top of the bar.\"  \"Why?\" Buck asked suspiciously.  \"I want to see whether distance is a factor where the gun is concerned. Whether you can place the gun that far away from you, or whether the power operates only when you want your gun in your hand.\"  \"No,\" Buck said in an ugly voice. \"Damn if I will. I'd maybe get my gun over, there and not be able to get it back, and then you'd jump me--the two of you. I ain't minded to experiment around too much, thank you.\"  \"All right,\" the professor said, as if he didn't care. \"The suggestion was purely in the scientific spirit--\"  \"Sure,\" said Buck. \"Sure. Just don't get any more scientific, or I'll experiment on how many holes you can get in you before you die.\"  The professor sat back in his chair and looked Buck right in the eye. After a second, Buck looked away, scowling.  Me, I hadn't said a word the whole while, and I wasn't talking now.  \"Wonder where that goddam yellow-bellied sheriff is?\" Buck said."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31783"],["title","Was General Thomas Slow at Nashville? (#1)"],["body","force was included the entire equipment of trains, pontoons, and similar essentials which Thomas, with great care, had perfected for the army of the Cumberland. Thomas's request that he might have his old corps which he had organized, which had fought under him so long, was refused, and, instead, two small corps were sent him.  The nucleus around which General Thomas was to organize an army to take care of Hood--who from May till November had taxed the offensive resources of Sherman's three armies--was, the Fourth Corps, General Stanley, with an effective force of 13,907, and the Twenty-third, General Schofield, with 10,358 effectives.  The means of holding Chattanooga are indicated by the instructions from Sherman to Steedman, whose troops had almost dwindled away by expiration of service: \"You must organize and systematize the hospitals and men sent back to Chattanooga. You could use some of them for your forts,\" and it was suggested to Thomas: \"To make things sure, you might call upon the Governors of Kentucky and Indiana for some militia, cautioning them against a stampede.\" Thomas was so short of men that when Steedman asked for enough for a small but important garrison, he was obliged to reply: \"You might send a force from the organization of convalescents now being made up by General Cruft at Chattanooga.\" To which Steedman replied, \"So far, all such detachments reported from the front [Sherman] are with furloughs, and are waiting transportation home.\"  In place of the 15,000 veterans whose terms had expired, Thomas received 12,000 newly enlisted recruits. General A. J. Smith's veteran corps had been ordered from Missouri, and a great parade has been made of this fact by those whose interest it was to show that Thomas had been left with a competent force. But the fact that it did not arrive at Nashville till after the battle of Franklin, and that Thomas was waiting for it as well as to remount the cavalry, was not so loudly proclaimed.  However, when Sherman was ready to start for the sea, with Hood's veteran army concentrated behind him, and Thomas, with the above mentioned elements of an army scattered over a territory as large as France, had been assigned to take care of Hood, General Sherman telegraphed Halleck: \"I therefore feel no uneasiness as to Tennessee, and have ordered Thomas to assume the offensive in the direction of Selma, Ala.\" And General Grant, after receiving some inflated figures of a great force left with Thomas, telegraphed Sherman: \"With the force you have left with Thomas, he must be able to take care of Hood and destroy him.\" Later, when the anxiety at City Point referred to in the opening of this paper had become intense, the margin of force with which General Thomas was really operating was found to be so small that General Grant suggested that he should \"arm and put in the trenches your quartermaster employees, citizens, etc.,\" and again, a few hours later, he was suggesting what he could do \"with your citizen employees armed.\"   CONCENTRATING IN FRONT OF HOOD.  It was under such circumstances and conditions which, after all, are but faintly shadowed forth by the facts here stated, that General Thomas began to concentrate his conglomerate forces in Hood's front, and begin under fire the work of organizing and refitting an army. With superhuman effort, and such loyal assistance and energy from officers and soldiers as were not elsewhere exhibited during the war, because not previously required, General Thomas set about the task of preparing the means of overthrowing Hood. Deliberate action and the extreme of prudence were essentials of the situation. The objective of Hood's campaign, under suggestions from President Davis, was the Ohio River. There was no reserve force in sight or within summoning distance, or immediately available anywhere in case of reverses. Thomas could not afford to take the slightest risks so long as his own position was not imperilled. It was not alone the immediate interests confided to his keeping and defense which hinged upon his success or failure, but both Grant and Sherman and possibly the Union itself were to stand or fall with such success or failure. Had Hood succeeded, as at the first he might have succeeded without fault of Thomas, or even fair ground for reflection upon him, what would have been said of Sherman for marching off to the sea, leaving the central West without sufficient protection, or of General Grant for having allowed him to go?  And because the deliberate, prudent, imperturbable, and always successful Thomas appreciated the situation, and determined to be ready to annihilate his enemy before he struck, he was hastily declared to be slow by those he was preparing to save.  All of General Thomas's troubles at Nashville arose from his adhering, in the face of threatened removal, to plans of action which made General Wilson's cavalry an essential factor in the attack on Hood for which he was energetically preparing. He was looking not only to attack, but to crushing pursuit. In view of the great preponderance of the enemy's cavalry, which was then double his own, and led by Forrest, one of the ablest cavalry generals on either side, effective pursuit without a strong mounted force would be impossible.  The correspondence with Grant--which grew until an order was issued for General Thomas's relief by General Schofield, and, when this was held in abeyance, until a second order for superseding him with General Logan--began with an order from Grant not to \"let Forrest get off without punishment.\" As Forrest's mounted force was double Wilson's, this was easier to write than to execute. General Thomas therefore explained the situation fully, showing that the cavalry of Hatch and Grierson, which were all the reinforcements he had to depend upon at first, had been turned in at Memphis; that half his own cavalry had been dismounted to equip Kilpatrick's column for Sherman; that his dismounted force, which he had sent to Louisville for horses and arms, was detained there waiting for both, and that as he was greatly outnumbered both in infantry and cavalry he would be compelled to act on the defensive. But he added, in closing: \"The moment I can get my cavalry, I will march against Hood, and if Forrest can be reached he shall be punished.\"  The day after General Schofield's brilliant and effective battle at Franklin, Thomas made known to Halleck his confidence that Hood could not cross the Cumberland, and therefore thought it best to wait until Wilson could equip his cavalry, as he then felt certain he could whip Hood. Next, the President, through Secretary Stanton, stirred General Grant up by a telegram stating that Mr. Lincoln felt \"solicitous about the disposition of Thomas to lay in fortifications for an indefinite period, 'until Wilson gets equipments.'\"   THE PANIC AT WASHINGTON.  In spite of the plainest statements of the situation, of the great disparity of forces, of the dictates of prudence to remain on the defensive until he could strike an effective blow, which he expected to deliver in a few days, Thomas was prodded and nagged from City Point and Washington as no officer in command of an army had been before, and treated day by day as if he needed tutelage. In the last dispatch of the series of clear explanations,--which under other circumstances than the seething of that inside panic which a full appreciation of the complications that Sherman's march to the sea had caused would doubtless have been accepted,--General Thomas was peremptorily ordered to \"attack Hood at once without waiting for a remount of your cavalry. There is great danger in delay resulting in a campaign back to the Ohio.\" This was sent in reply to a telegram of Thomas showing that there was the greatest activity in getting the cavalry ready, and he hoped to have it remounted \"in three days from this time.\" To this Thomas replied that he would make all dispositions and attack according to orders, adding, \"though I believe it will be hazardous with the small force of cavalry now at my service.\" Orders to prepare for attack were immediately sent out, and dispositions for the attack began. Meantime a sleet storm came on which covered the country with a glaze of ice over which neither horses, men, nor artillery could move even on level ground, to say nothing of assaulting an enemy intrenched on the hills. The same day Halleck telegraphed: \"If you wait till General Wilson mounts all his cavalry you will wait till doomsday, for the waste equals the supply.\" And General Grant telegraphed orders relieving Thomas. The latter telegraphed Halleck that he was conscious of having done everything possible to prepare the troops to attack, and if he was removed he would submit without a murmur.  The order of relief was suspended. The sleet storm continued. All of General Thomas's officers agreed that it was impracticable to attack. Some of them even found it impossible to ride to headquarters because of the ice, and in the midst of it came an order from Grant: \"I am in hopes of receiving a dispatch from you to-day announcing you have moved. Delay no longer for weather or reinforcements.\"  Thomas replied:  \"I will obey the order as promptly as possible, however much I regret it, as the attack will have to be made under every disadvantage. The whole country is covered with a perfect sheet of ice and sleet, and it is with difficulty the troops are able to move about on level ground.\"  To Halleck, Thomas replied:  \"I have the troops ready to make the attack on the enemy as soon as the sleet which now covers the ground has melted sufficiently to enable the men to march, as the whole country is now covered with a sheet of ice so hard and slippery that it is utterly impossible for troops to ascend the slopes, or even move upon level ground in anything like order. Under these circumstances I believe an attack at this time would only result in a useless sacrifice of life.\"  The"]]]
