As soon as they had left the racetrack and were well out on the highway, the driver said: \"You want to call in, Mario? This traffic is pretty heavy.\"  The big man beside Lenny leaned forward, over the back of the front seat, unhooked the receiver of the scrambler-equipped radiophone, and sat back down. He thumbed a button on the side of the handset and said: \"This is Seven Oh Two.\" After a short silence, he said: \"You can call off the net. You want him brought in?\" He listened for a moment. \"O.K. Are we cleared through the main gate? O.K. Off.\"  He leaned forward to replace the receiver, speaking to the driver as he did so. \"Straight to the Air Force base. They've got a jet waiting there for him.\"  He settled back comfortably and looked at Lenny. \"You could at least tell people where you're going.\"  \"Very well,\" said Lenny. He folded his arms, closed his eyes, and relaxed. \"Right now, I'm going off to dreamland.\"  He waited a short while to see if the other would say anything. He didn't, so Lenny proceeded to do exactly what he had promised to do.  He went off to dreamland.  He had not been absolutely sure, when he made the promise, that he would actually do just that, but the odds were in favor of it. It was now one o'clock in the morning in Moscow, and Lenny's brother, Raphael, was a man of regular habits.  Lenny reached out. When he made contact, all he got was a jumble of hash. It was as though someone had made a movie by cutting bits and snippets from a hundred different films, no bit more than six or seven frames long, with a sound track that might or might not match, and projected the result through a drifting fog, using an ever-changing lens that rippled like the surface of a wind-ruffled pool. Sometimes one figure would come into sharp focus for a fraction of a second, sometimes in color, sometimes not.  Sometimes Lenny was merely observing the show, sometimes he was in it.  _Rafe! Hey, Rafe! Wake up!_  The jumble of hash began to stabilize, becoming more coherent--         *       *       *       *       *  Lenny sat behind the far desk, watching his brother come up the primrose path in a unicycle. He pulled it to a halt in front of the desk, opened the pilot's canopy, threw out a rope ladder, and climbed down. His gait was a little awkward, in spite of the sponge-rubber floor, because of the huge flowered carpetbag he was carrying. A battered top hat sat precariously on his blond, curly hair.  \"Lenny! Boy, am I glad to see you! I've got it! The whole trouble is in the wonkler, where the spadulator comes across the trellis grid!\" He lifted the carpetbag and sat it down on the lab table. \"Connect up the groffle meter! We'll show those pentagon pickles who has the push-and-go here!\"  \"Rafe,\" Lenny said gently, \"wake up. You're dreaming. You're asleep. I want to talk to you.\"  \"I know.\" He grinned widely. \"And you don't want any back talk from me! Yok-yok-yok! Just wait'll I show you!\"  In his hands, he held an object which Lenny did not at first understand. Then Rafe's mind brought it into focus.  \"This\"--Rafe held it up--\"is a rocket motor!\"  \"Rafe, wake up!\" Lenny said.  The surroundings stabilized a little more.  \"I will in just a minute, Lenny.\" Rafe was apologetic. \"But let me show you this.\" It did bear some resemblance to a rocket motor. It was about as long as a man's forearm and consisted of a bulbous chamber at one end, which narrowed down into a throat and then widened into a hornlike exhaust nozzle. The chamber was black; the rest was shiny chrome.  Rafe grasped it by the throat with one hand. The other, he clasped firmly around the combustion chamber. \"Watch! Now watch!\"  He gave the bulbous, rubbery chamber a hard squeeze--  \"_SQUAWK!_\" went the horn.  \"Rafe!\" Lenny shouted. \"Wake up! WAKE UP!\"  Rafe blinked as the situation clarified. \"What? Just A Second. Lenny. Just....\"         *       *       *       *       *  \"... _A second._\"  Raphael Poe blinked his eyes open. The moon was shining through the dirty windows of the dingy little room that was all he could call home--for a while, at least. Outside the window were the gray streets of Moscow.  His brother's thoughts resounded in his fully awake brain. _Rafe! You awake?_  _Sure. Sure. What is it?_  The conversation that followed was not in words or pictures, but a weird combination of both, plus a strong admixture of linking concepts that were neither.  In essence, Lenny merely reported that he had taken the day off to go to the races and that Colonel Spaulding was evidently upset for some reason. He wondered if Rafe were in any kind of trouble.  _No trouble. Everything's fine at this end. But Dr. Malekrinova won't be back on the job until tomorrow afternoon--or,_ this _afternoon, rather._  _I know_, Lenny replied. _That's why I figured I could take time off for a go at the ponies._  _I wonder why they're in such a fuss, then?_ Rafe thought.  _I'll let you know when I find out_, Lenny said. _Go back to sleep and don't worry._  [Illustration]         *       *       *       *       *  In a small office in the Pentagon, Colonel Julius T. Spaulding cradled the telephone on his desk and looked at the Secretary of Defense. \"That was the airfield. Poe will be here shortly. We'll get to the bottom of this pretty quickly.\"  \"I hope so, Julius,\" the Secretary said heavily. \"The president is beginning to think we're both nuts.\"  The colonel, a lean, nervous man with dark, bushy eyebrows and a mustache to match, rolled his eyes up toward the ceiling. \"I'm beginning to agree with him.\"  The Defense Secretary scowled at him. \"What do you mean?\"  \"Anybody who takes telepathy seriously is considered a nut,\" said the colonel.  \"True,\" said the Secretary, \"but that doesn't mean we _are_ nuts.\"  \"Oh, yeah?\" The colonel took the cigar out of his mouth a gestured with it. \"Anybody who'd do something that convinces all his friends he's nuts must be nuts.\"  The Secretary smiled wanly. \"I wish you wouldn't be so logical. You almost convince me.\"  \"Don't worry,\" said the colonel. \"I'm not ready to have this room measured for sponge-rubber wallpaper just yet. Operation Mapcase has helped a lot in the past few months, and it will help even more.\"  \"All you have to do is get the bugs out of it,\" said the Secretary.  \"If we did that,\" Colonel Spaulding said flatly, \"the whole operation would fold from lack of personnel.\"  \"Just carry on the best you can,\" the Secretary said gloomily as he got up to leave. \"I'll let you handle it.\"  \"Fine. I'll call you later.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Twenty minutes after the Defense Secretary had gone, Lenny Poe was shown into Colonel Spaulding's office. The agent who had brought him in closed the door gently, leaving him alone with the colonel.  \"I told you I'd be back this evening. What were you in such a hurry about?\"  \"You're supposed to stay in touch,\" Colonel Spaulding pointed out. \"I don't mind your penchant for ponies particularly, but I'd like to know where to find you if I need you.\"  \"I wouldn't mind in the least, colonel. I'd phone you every fifteen minutes if that's what you wanted. Except for one thing.\"  \"What's that?\"  Lenny jerked a thumb over his shoulder. \"Your linguistically talented flatfeet. Did you ever try to get into a floating crap game when you were being followed by a couple of bruisers who look more like cops than cops do?\"  \"Look, Poe, I can find you plenty of action right here in Washington, if it won't offend your tender sensibilities to shoot crap with a senator or two. Meanwhile, sit down and listen. This is important.\"  Lenny sat own reluctantly. \"O.K. What is it?\"  \"Dr. Davenport and his crew are unhappy about that last batch of drawings you and I gave 'em.\"  \"What's the matter? Don't they like the color scheme? I never thought scientists had any artistic taste, anyway.\"  \"It's got nothing to do with that. The--\"  The phone rang. Colonel Spaulding scooped it up and identified himself. Then: \"What? Yeah. All right, send him in.\"  He hung up and looked back at Lenny. \"Davenport. We can get his story firsthand. Just sit there and look important.\"  Lenny nodded. He knew that Dr. Amadeus Davenport was aware that the source of those drawings was Soviet Russia, but he did not know how they had been obtained. As far as he knew, it was just plain, ordinary spy work.  He came in briskly. He was a tall, intelligent-looking man with a rather craggy face and thoughtful brown eyes. He put a large brief case on the floor, and, after the preliminaries were over, he came right to the point.  \"Colonel Spaulding, I spoke to the Secretary of Defense, and he agreed that perhaps this situation might be cleared up if I talked directly with you.\"  \"I hope so,\" the colonel said. \"Just what is it that seems to be bothering you?\"  \"These drawings,\" Davenport said, \"don't make any sense. The device they're supposed to represent couldn't do anything. Look; I'll show you.\"  He took from his brief case photostatic copies of some of the drawings Lenny had made. Five of them were straight blueprint-type drawings; the sixth was a copy of Lenny's near-photographic paintings of the device itself.  \"This component, here,\" he said, gesturing at the set of drawings, \"simply baffles us. We're of the opinion that your agents are known to the Soviet government and have been handed a set of phony plans.\"  \"What's it supposed to do?\" Lenny asked.  \"We don't know what it's _supposed_ to do,\" the scientist said, \"but it's doubtful that it would _actually_ do anything.\" He selected one of the photocopies. \"See that thing? The one shaped like the letter Q with an offset tail? According to the specifications, it is supposed to be painted emerald green, but there's no indication of what it is.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Lenny Poe reached out, picked up the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/305"],["title","The Count's Millions (#1)"],["body","eart, as if she had received a fatal wound, and uttered the single word: “Lost!”  The next moment she turned as pale as death, her head drooped, her eyes closed, and she staggered as if about to fall. Two maids sprang forward to support her, but she gently repulsed them, murmuring, “Thanks! thanks! I am strong now.”  She was, in fact, sufficiently strong to conquer her weakness. She summoned all her resolution, and, paler than a statue, with set teeth and dry, glittering eyes, she approached the alcove. She stood there for a moment perfectly motionless, murmuring a few unintelligible words; but at last, crushed by her sorrow, she sank upon her knees beside the bed, buried her face in the counterpane and wept.  Deeply moved by the sight of this despair, the servants held their breath, wondering how it would all end. It ended suddenly. The girl sprang from her knees, as if a gleam of hope had darted through her heart. “A physician!” she said, eagerly.  “I have sent for one, mademoiselle,” replied M. Casimir. And hearing a voice and a sound of footsteps on the staircase, he added: “And fortunately, here he comes.”  The doctor entered. He was a young man, although his head was almost quite bald. He was short, very thin, clean-shaven, and clad in black from head to foot. Without a word, without a bow, he walked straight to the bedside, lifted the unconscious man’s eyelids, felt his pulse, and uncovered his chest, applying his ear to it. “This is a serious case,”  he said at the close of his examination.  Mademoiselle Marguerite, who had followed his movements with the most poignant anxiety, could not repress a sob. “But all hope is not lost, is it, monsieur?” she asked in a beseeching voice, with hands clasped in passionate entreaty. “You will save him, will you not--you will save him?”  “One may always hope for the best.”  This was the doctor’s only answer. He had drawn his case of instruments from his pocket, and was testing the points of his lancets on the tip of his finger. When he had found one to his liking: “I must ask you, mademoiselle,” said he, “to order these women to retire, and to retire yourself. The men will remain to assist me, if I require help.”  She obeyed submissively, but instead of returning to her own room, she remained in the hall, seating herself upon the lower step of the staircase near the door, counting the seconds, and drawing a thousand conjectures from the slightest sound.  Meanwhile, inside the room, the physician was proceeding slowly, not from temperament however, but from principle. Dr. Jodon--for such was his name--was an ambitious man who played a part. Educated by a “prince of science,” more celebrated for the money he gained than for the cures he effected, he copied his master’s method, his gestures, and even the inflections of his voice. By casting in people’s eyes the same powder as his teacher had employed, he hoped to obtain the same results: a large practice and an immense fortune. In his secret heart he was by no means disconcerted by his patient’s condition; on the contrary, he did not consider the count’s state nearly as precarious as it really was.  But bleeding and cupping alike failed to bring the sick man to consciousness. He remained speechless and motionless; the only result obtained, was that his breathing became a trifle easier. Finding his endeavors fruitless, the doctor at last declared that all immediate remedies were exhausted, that “the women” might be allowed to return, and that nothing now remained but to wait for the effect of the remedies he was about to prescribe, and which they must procure from the nearest chemist.  Any other man would have been touched by the agony of entreaty contained in the glance that Mademoiselle Marguerite cast upon the physician as she returned into the room; but it did not affect him in the least. He calmly said, “I cannot give my decision as yet.”  “My God!” murmured the unhappy girl; “oh, my God, have mercy upon me!”  But the doctor, copying his model, had stationed himself near the fireplace, with his elbow leaning on the mantel-shelf, in a graceful, though rather pompous attitude. “Now,” he said, addressing his remarks to M. Casimir, “I desire to make a few inquiries. Is this the first time the Count de Chalusse has had such an attack?”  “Yes, sir--at least since I have been in attendance upon him.”  “Very good. That is a chance in our favor. Tell me--have you ever heard him complain of vertigo, or of a buzzing in his ears?”  “Never.”  Mademoiselle Marguerite seemed inclined to volunteer some remark, but the doctor imposed silence upon her by a gesture, and continued his examination. “Is the count a great eater?” he inquired. “Does he drink heavily?”  “The count is moderation itself, monsieur, and he always takes a great deal of water with his wine.”  The doctor listened with an air of intent thoughtfulness, his head slightly inclined forward, his brow contracted, and his under lip puffed out, while from time to time he stroked his beardless chin. He was copying his master. “The devil!” he said, sotto voce. “There must be some cause for such an attack, however. Nothing in the count’s constitution predisposes him to such an accident----” Then, suddenly turning toward Mademoiselle Marguerite: “Do you know, mademoiselle, whether the count has experienced any very violent emotion during the past few days?”  “Something occurred this very morning, which seemed to annoy him very much.”  “Ah! now we have it,” said the doctor, with the air of an oracle. “Why did you not tell me all this at first? It will be necessary for you to give me the particulars, mademoiselle.”  The young girl hesitated. The servants were dazed by the doctor’s manner; but Mademoiselle Marguerite was far from sharing their awe and admiration. She would have given anything to have had the regular physician of the household there instead of him! As for this coarse examination in the presence of all these servants, and by the bedside of a man who, in spite of his apparent unconsciousness, was, perhaps, able to hear and to comprehend, she looked upon it as a breach of delicacy, even of propriety.  “It is of the most urgent importance that I should be fully informed of these particulars,” repeated the physician peremptorily.  After such an assertion, further hesitation was out of the question. Mademoiselle Marguerite seemed to collect her thoughts, and then she sadly said: “Just as we sat down to breakfast this morning, a letter was handed to the count. No sooner had his eyes fallen upon it, than he turned as white as his napkin. He rose from his seat and began to walk hastily up and down the dining-room, uttering exclamations of anger and sorrow. I spoke to him, but he did not seem to hear me. However, after a few moments, he resumed his seat at the table, and began to eat----”  “As usual?”  “He ate more than usual, monsieur. Only I must tell you that it seemed to me he was scarcely conscious of what he was doing. Four or five times he left the table, and then came back again. At last, after quite a struggle, he seemed to come to some decision. He tore the letter to pieces, and threw the pieces out of the window that opens upon the garden.”  Mademoiselle Marguerite expressed herself with the utmost simplicity, and there was certainly nothing particularly extraordinary in her story. Still, those around her listened with breathless curiosity, as though they were expecting some startling revelation, so much does the human mind abhor that which is natural and incline to that which is mysterious.  Without seeming to notice the effect she had produced, and addressing herself to the physician alone, the girl continued: “After the letter was destroyed, M. de Chalusse seemed himself again. Coffee was served, and he afterward lighted a cigar as usual. However, he soon let it go out. I dared not disturb him by any remarks; but suddenly he said to me: ‘It’s strange, but I feel very uncomfortable.’ A moment passed, without either of us speaking, and then he added: ‘I am certainly not well. Will you do me the favor to go to my room for me? Here is the key of my escritoire; open it, and on the upper shelf you will find a small bottle which please bring to me.’ I noticed with some surprise that M. de Chalusse, who usually speaks very distinctly, stammered and hesitated considerably in making this request, but, unfortunately, I did not think much about it at the time. I did as he requested, and he poured eight or ten drops of the contents of the vial into a glass of water, and swallowed it.”  So intense was Dr. Jodon’s interest that he became himself again. He forgot to attitudinize. “And after that?” he asked, eagerly.  “After that, M. de Chalusse seemed to feel much better, and retired to his study as usual. I fancied that any annoyance the letter had caused him was forgotten; but I was wrong, for in the afternoon he sent a message, through Madame Leon, requesting me to join him in the garden. I hastened there, very much surprised, for the weather was extremely disagreeable. ‘Dear Marguerite,’ he said, on seeing me, ‘help me to find the fragments of that letter which I flung from the window this morning. I would give half my fortune for an address which it must certainly have contained, but which I quite overlooked in my anger.’ I helped him as he asked. He might have reasonably hoped to succeed, for it was raining when the scraps of paper were thrown out, and instead of flying through the air, they fell directly on to the ground. We succeeded in finding a large number of the scraps, but what M. de Chalusse so particularly wanted was not to be read on any one of them. Several times he spoke of his regret, and cursed his precipitation.”  M. Bourigeau, the concierge, and M. Casimir exchanged a significant smile. They had seen the count searching for the remnants of this letter, and had thought him little better than an idiot. But now everything was explained.  “I was much"]]]
