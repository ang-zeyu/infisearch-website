In the 22 hot Summers that he had lived through he had never found himself very far from a well or spring when his thirst cried out to be slacked, and he did not suppose that it was much farther between wells down South.  \"I don't see the use of carrying two or three pints o' water along all day right past springs and over cricks,\" he remarked to his chum, as the two were examining the queer, cloth-covered cans.  \"We've got to take 'em, any way,\" answered his chum, resignedly, \"It's regulations.\"  On his entry into service a boy accepted everything without question when assured that it was \"regulations.\" He would have charged bayonets on a buzz-saw if authoritatively informed that it was required by the mysterious \"regulations.\"  The long march the 200th Ind. made after Bragg over the dusty turnpikes the first week in October, 1862, taught Si the value of a canteen. After that it was rarely allowed to get empty.  \"What are these grooves along each side for?\" he asked, pointing out the little hollows which give the \"prod\" lightness and strength.  \"Why,\" answered the Orderly, who, having been in the three-months' service, assumed to know more about war than the Duke of Wellington, \"the intention of those is to make a wound the lips of which will close up when the bayonet is pulled out, so that the man'll be certain to die.\"  Naturally so diabolical an intention sent cold shivers down Si's back.  The night before Si left for \"the front\" he had taken his musket and couterments home to show them to his mother and sisters--and the other fellow's sister, whose picture and lock of hair he had safely stowed away. They looked upon the bayonet with a dreadful awe. Tears came into Maria's eyes as she thought of Si roaming about through the South like a bandit plunging that cruel steel into people's bowels.  \"This is the way it's done,\" said Si, as he charged about the room in an imaginary duel with a rebel, winding up with a terrifying lunge. \"Die, Tur-r-rraitor, gaul durn ye,\" he exclaimed, for he was really getting excited over the matter, while the girls screamed and jumped upon the chairs, and his good mother almost fainted.  The attention that the 200th Ind. had to give to the bayonet drill confirmed Si's deep respect for the weapon, and he practiced assiduously all the \"lunges,\" \"parries,\" and \"guards\" in the Manual, in the hope that proficiency so gained would save his own dearly-beloved hide from puncture, and enable him to punch any luckless rebel that he might encounter as full of holes as a fishing net.  [Illustration: WHAT THE BAYONET WAS GOOD FOR 033 ]  The 200th Ind.'s first fight was at Perryville, but though it routed the rebel force in front of it, it would have taken a bayonet half-a-mile long to touch the nearest \"Johnny.\" Si thought it odd that the rebels didn't let him get close enough to them to try his new bayonet, and pitch a dozen or two of them over into the next field.  If the truth must be told, the first blood that stained Si's bayonet was not that of a fellow-man.  Si Klegg's company was on picket one day, while Gen. Buell was trying to make up his mind what to do with Bragg. Rations had been a little short for a week or so. In fact, they had been scarcely sufficient to meet the demands of Si's appetite, and his haversack had nothing in it to speak of. Strict orders against foraging had been, issued. It was the day of \"guarding rebel onion patches.\" Si couldn't quite get it straight in his head why the General should be so mighty particular about a few pigs and chickens and sweet potatoes, for he was really getting hungry, and when a man is in this condition he is not in a fit mood to grapple with fine-spun theories of governmental policy.  So when a fat pig came wabbling and grunting toward his post, it was to Si like a vision of manna to the children of Israel in the wilderness. A wild, uncontrollable desire to taste a fresh spare-rib took possession of him. Naturally, his first idea was to send a bullet through the animal, but on second thought he saw that wouldn't do at all. It would \"give him away\" at once, and, besides, he had found that a single shot on the picket-line would keep Buell's entire army in line-of-battle for a whole day.  Si wrote to his mother that his bright new bayonet was stained with Southern blood, and the old lady shuddered at the awful thought. \"But,\" added Si, \"it was only a pig, and not a man, that I killed!\"  \"I'm so glad!\" she exclaimed.  [Illustration: AS MARIA PICTURED SI USING HIS BAYONET 034 ]  By the time Si had been in the service a year there was less zeal in the enforcement of orders of this kind, and Si had become a very skillful and successful forager. He had still been unable to reach with his bayonet the body of a single one of his misguided fellow citizens, but he had stabbed a great many pigs and sheep. In fact, Si found his bayonet a most useful auxiliary in his predatory operations. He could not well have gotten along without it.  Uncle Sam generally furnished Si with plenty of coffee--roasted and unground--but did not supply him with a coffee mill. Si thought at first that the Government had forgotten something. He saw that several of the old veterans of '61 had coffee mills, but he found on inquiry that they had been obtained by confiscation only. He determined to supply himself at the first opportunity, but in the meantime he was obliged to 'use his bayonet as a substitute, just as all the rest of the soldiers did.  We regret to say that Si, having thrown away his \"Baxter's Call to the Unconverted\" in his first march, and having allowed himself to forget the lessons he had learned but a few years before in Sunday-school, soon learned to play poker and other sinful games. These, at night, developed another use for the bayonet. In its capacity as a \"handy\" candlestick it was \"equaled by few and excelled by none.\" The \"shank\" was always ready to receive the candle, while the point could be thrust into the ground in an instant, and nothing more was necessary. This was perhaps the most general sphere of usefulness found by the bayonet during the war. Barrels of candle-grease flowed down the furrowed sides of this weapon for every drop of human blood that dimmed its luster.    CHAPTER IV. THE AWFUL HARDTACK  THE HARD AND SOLID STAFF OF MILITARY LIFE.  \"APPETITE'S a queer thing,\" said Si to Shorty one day, when both were in a philosophical mood. \"It's an awful bother when you haven't it, and it's a great deal worse when you have it, and can't get anything for it.\" \"Same as money,\" returned sage Shorty. During the first few months of Si Klegg's service in the army the one thing that bothered him more than anything else was his appetite. It was a very robust, healthy one that Si had, for he had grown up on his father's farm in Indiana, and had never known what it was to be hungry without abundant means at hand for appeasing his desires in that direction. His mother's cupboard was never known to be in the condition of Old Mother Hubbard's, described in the nursery rhyme. The Kleggs might not have much tapestry and bric-a-brac in their home, but their smoke-house was always full, and Mrs. Klegg's kitchen could have fed a camp-meeting any time without warning. So it was that when Si enlisted his full, rosy face and his roundness of limb showed that he had been well fed, and that nature had made good use of the ample daily supplies that were provided. His digestive organs were kept in perfect condition by constant exercise.  After Si had put down his name on the roll of Co. Q of the 200th Ind. he had but a few days to remain at home before his regiment was to start for Louisville. During this time his mother and sisters kept him filled up with \"goodies\" of every sort. In fact, it was the biggest thing in the way of a protracted picnic that Si had ever struck.  \"You must enjoy these things while you can, Si,\" said his mother, \"for goodness knows what you'll do when you really git into the army. I've heerd 'em tell awful things about how the poor sogers don't have half enough to eat, and what they do git goes agin' any Christian stomach. Here, take another piece of this pie. A little while, and it'll be a long time, I reckon, till ye git any more.\"  \"Don't keer if I do!\" said Si, for there was scarcely any limit to his capacity.  And so during those days and nights the old lady and the girls cooked and cooked, and Si ate and ate, until it seemed as if he wouldn't want any more till the war was over.  Si was full, and as soon as Co. Q was, it was ordered to camp, and Si had to go. They loaded him down with good things enough to last him a week. The pretty Annabel--the neighbor's daughter who had solemnly promised Si that she wouldn't go with any other fellow while he was away--came around to see Si off and brought him a rich fruit cake.  \"I made that for you,\" she said.  \"Bully for you!\" said Si, for he felt that he must begin to talk like a soldier.  The first day or two after reaching Louisville the 200th received rations of \"soft bread.\" But that didn't last long. It was only a way they had of letting the fresh soldier down easy. Orders came to get ready to pull out after Bragg, and then Si'a regiment had its first issue of army rations. As the Orderly pried open a box of hardtack and began to distribute them to the boys, exclaimed:  \"Them's nice-looking soda crackers. I don't believe the grub is going to be so bad, after all.\"  Si had never seen a hardtack before.  \"Better taste one and see how you like it!\" said one of Buell's ragged Indiana veterans, who had come over to see the boys of the 200th and hear the latest news from \"God's country.\"  It happened that this lot was one of extra quality as to hardness. The baker's watch had stopped, or he had gone to sleep, and they had been left in the oven or dry-kiln too long. Si took one of them and carried it to his mouth. He first tried on it the "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31772"],["title","Si Klegg, Book 2 (#1)"],["body","head with the butt of his blacksnake whip, not in the expectation of getting any further effort out of them he knew better than that but as a relief to his overcharged heart.  \"Stop beatin' them mules over the head,\" shouted Si, as they came up. Not that he cared a fig about the mules, but that he wanted to \"jump\" somebody.  [Illustration: STOP BEATIN' THEM MULES' 22]  \"Go to brimstone blazes, you freckle-faced Posey County refugee,\" responded Groundhog, the teamster, in the same fraternal spirit. \"I'm drivin' this here team.\" He gave the nigh-swing mule a \"welt\" that would have knocked down anything else than a swing mule.  \"If you don't stop beatin' them mules, by thunder, I'll make you.\"  \"Make's a good word,\" responded Groundhog, giving the off-swing mule a wicked \"biff.\" \"I never see anything come out of Posey County that could make me do what I didn't want to.\"  Si struck at him awkwardly. He was so hampered by his weight of soggy clothes that there was little force or direction to his blow. The soaked teamster returned the blow with equal clumsiness.  The other boys came up and pulled them apart.  \"We ain't no time for sich blamed nonsense,\" they growled. \"We've got to git this here wagon up to the company, an' we'll have the devil's own time doin' it. Quit skylarkin' an' git to work.\"  They looked around for something with which to make pries. Every rail and stick within a quarter of a mile of the road was gone. They had been used up the previous Summer, when both armies had passed over the road.  There was nothing to do but plod off through mud and rain to the top of a hill in the distance, where there was a fence still standing. A half an hour later each of the six came back with a heavy rail on his shoulder. They pried the wagon out and got it started, only to sink again in another quagmire a few hundred yards further on.  Si and the boys went back to get their rails, but found that they had been carried off by another squad that had a wagon in trouble. There was nothing to do but to make another toilsome journey to the fence for more rails.  After helping the wagon out they concluded it{24} would be wiser to carry their rails with them a little way to see if they would be needed again.  They were many times that afternoon. As dark ness came on Si, who had the crowning virtue of hopefulness when he fully recognized the unutterable badness of things, tried to cheer the other boys up with assertions that they would soon get into camp, where they would find bright, warm fires with which to dry their clothes, and plenty of hot coffee to thaw them out inside.  The quick-coming darkness added enormously to the misery of their work. For hours they struggled along the bottomless road, in the midst of a ruck of played-out mules and unutterably tired, disgusted men, laboring as they were to get wagons ahead.  Finally they came up to their brigade, which had turned off the road and gone into line-of-battle in an old cotton-field, where the mud was deeper, if possible, than in the road.  \"Where's the 200th Ind.?\" called out Si.  \"Here, Si,\" Shorty's voice answered.  \"Where's the fires, Shorty,\" asked Si, with sinking heart.  \"Ain't allowed none,\" answered his partner gloomily. \"There's a rebel battery on that hill there, and they shoot every time a match is lighted. What've you got there, a rail? By George, that's lucky! We'll have something to keep us out of the mud.\"  They laid down the rail and sat upon it.  \"Shorty,\" said Si, as he tried to arrange his aching bones to some comfort on the rail, \"I got mad at you for cussin' the Wabash this morning. I ain't a fluid talker such as you are, an' I can't find words to say{25} what I think. But I jest wisht you would begin right here and cuss everybody from Abe Lincoln down to Corporal Si Klegg, and everything from the Wabash in Injianny down to the Cumberland in Tennessee. I'd like to listen to you.\"    CHAPTER II. SECOND DAY'S MARCH  THE LONG COLUMN CRAWLS THROUGH RAIN AND COLD TO MURFREESBORO.  SI KLEGG was generous with his rail, as he was with all things among his comrades. He selected the softest part, in the center, for him self and Shorty, and then invited the other boys to share its hospitalities. They crowded up close to him and Shorty on either side, and there seemed to come a little warmth and dryness from the close contact of their bodies.  Si was so mortally tired that it seemed a great relief just to sit still and rest, though the rain continued to pour down.  Shorty fished some hardtack and fried pork out of his haversack, and also gave him a handful of ground coffee. Si munched the crackers and meat, with an occasional nip at the coffee. His spirits began to rise just a trifle. He was too healthy in body and mind to be totally downcast for long.  \"'Tis n't much of a supper,\" he said to himself, \"but it beats nothin' at all miles and miles. Besides, I was mighty lucky in gettin' the biggest rail. Some that the other boys has are no good at all. They'll let 'em right down in the mud. And most o' the boys has no rails at all. I'm awfully sorry for 'em.\"  Then he began to wonder if they were not {27}overcautious about the nearness of the enemy. He had been in the army just long enough to have contempt for the stories that were always current with a certain class about the proximity and strength of the enemy. Shorty was not of that kind; but, then, Shorty was as liable to be imposed upon as anybody.  \"How do you know there's a rebel battery on the hill out there?\" he finally asked Shorty.  \"They belted into the Oshkosh Terrors, out there to our right, killed a mule, scared two teamsters to death, and knocked over three or four kittles of coffee. It was awful unlucky about the coffee,\" an swered Shorty.  \"How long ago was that?\"  \"O, several hours ago. Just after we turned into the field, and long before you come up.\"  \"Mebbe they've gone off now. Mebbe, if they're there yet, their ammynition's so soaked that they can't shoot. What do you say to startin' a little fire? It'd be an immense comfort. Unless we can dry out a little we'll be soaked into such mush before morning that we can't keep our shape, and they'll have to ladle us up with dippers.\"  \"It's strictly against orders.\"  \"You mean it was against orders several hours ago. I can't see nothin' on that hill over there. I've been watchin' for half an hour. There's nothin' movin'. Mebbe the orders has been changed, an' you haint heard about it,\" persisted Si. \"Mebbe the Orderly that was bringing 'em 's stuck in the mud. Mebbe the rain's soaked 'em so's they can't be read. If anybody's got any dry matches I'm goin' to chance{28} it.\"  Word was passed along the rail, and at length one of the boys was found to have some matches in a tin box which was proof against the rain.  Si got out his knife and whittled down a corner of the rail until he came to the dry part, and got off some shavings. Splinters were contributed by the others, and after several failures a small flame was started.  \"Here, what in the world are you men doing there?\" came in the stentorian tones of the Colonel, who it startled Si to discover was sitting a short distance behind him. \"Put that light out this instant.\"  Even before the command could be obeyed, four great flashes burned out like lightning in the murky darkness on the hill-top. Four cannon roared, and four shells screeched toward Si and his companions, who instinctively toppled over backward into the mud. One of the shells struck in the mud a few yards in front, burst with a deafening report, and sent over them a deluge of very wet Tennessee real estate.  \"The battery's out there yit, Si,\" said Shorty, as they gathered themselves up and carefully stamped out every spark of fire.  \"It's 'tendin' strictly to business,\" remarked Wes Williams.  \"Its ammynition don't seem to be a mite wet,\" added Jim Hutchinson.  \"There, you see, now,\" said the Colonel sternly. \"I'll tie up by the thumbs the next man that dares scratch a match.\"  \"You jest kin if I do,\" muttered Si, scraping off some of the superabundant mud, and resuming his{29} seat on the rail. \"This dog's cured of suckin' eggs.\" He set the butt of his gun down in front of him, clasped his hands around the barrel, leaned his head on them, and went to sleep.  He was so tired that he could have slept anywhere and in any position. He was dimly conscious during the night that the rain ceased and that it turned bitter cold. He was not going to wake up for trifles like that, though. When Si went to sleep he devoted himself entirely to that and nothing else. It {30} was one thing that he never allowed any interference with.  But with the first gray streaks of dawn in the east some uneasy, meddlesome spirit in the 200th Ind. happened to be awake, and he awakened the Adjutant, who cuffed and shook the headquarters drummer until he awakened and beat the reveille. This aroused the weary Orderly-Sergeants, who started upon the task of getting up the bone-wracked, aching-muscled men. In 10 minutes there was enough discontent and bitter grumbling in the 200th Ind. to have furnished forth a new political party.  The awakening process finally reached those of Co. Q who had roosted on Si's rail all night.  Si vigorously insisted on being let alone; that he hadn't been asleep five minutes, and that, anyhow, it was not his turn to go on guard. But the Orderly-Sergeant of Co. Q was a persistent fellow, and would not be denied.  When Si finally tried to rise he found that, in addition to the protests of his stiff legs, he was pinned firmly down. Feeling around to ascertain the cause, he discovered that the tail of his overcoat and his shoes had become deeply imbedded in the mud, and frozen solidly there. Shorty was in the same fix.  [Illustration: FROZEN IN THE MUD 29]  \"Got to shuck yourself out o' your overcoat, and leave them gunboats anchored where they are,\" remarked Shorty, doing as he said, and falling in for roll-call in his"]]]
