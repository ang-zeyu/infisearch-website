Upon this law the marvellous mathematical conquests of astronomy have been based.  All these wonderful results have been attained by the free exercise of men's mental abilities, and it cannot be imagined that God would have intervened to hamper their growth in intellectual power by revealing to men facts and methods which it was within their own ability to discover for themselves. Men's mental powers have developed by their exercise; they would have been stunted had men been led to look to revelation rather than to diligent effort for the satisfaction of their curiosity. We therefore do not find any reference in the Bible to that which modern astronomy has taught us. Yet it may be noted that some expressions, appropriate at any time, have become much more appropriate, much more forcible, in the light of our present-day knowledge.  The age of astronomy which preceded the Modern, and may be called the Classical age, was almost as sharply defined in its beginning as its successor. It lasted about two thousand years, and began with the investigations into the movements of the planets made by some of the early Greek mathematicians. Classical, like Modern astronomy, had its two sides,--the instrumental and the mathematical. On the instrumental side was the invention of graduated instruments for the determination of the positions of the heavenly bodies; on the mathematical, the development of geometry and trigonometry for the interpretation of those positions when thus determined. Amongst the great names of this period are those of Eudoxus of Knidus (B.C. 408-355), and Hipparchus of Bithynia, who lived rather more than two centuries later. Under its first leaders astronomy in the Classical age began to advance rapidly, but it soon experienced a deadly blight. Men were not content to observe the heavenly bodies for what they were; they endeavoured to make them the sources of divination. The great school of Alexandria (founded about 300 B.C.), the headquarters of astronomy, became invaded by the spirit of astrology, the bastard science which has always tried--parasite-like--to suck its life from astronomy. Thus from the days of Claudius Ptolemy to the end of the Middle Ages the growth of astronomy was arrested, and it bore but little fruit.  It will be noticed that the Classical age did not commence until about the time of the completion of the last books of the Old Testament; so we do not find any reference in Holy Scripture to the astronomical achievements of that period, amongst which the first attempts to explain the apparent motions of sun, moon, stars, and planets were the most considerable.  We have a complete history of astronomy in the Modern and Classical periods, but there was an earlier astronomy, not inconsiderable in amount, of which no history is preserved. For when Eudoxus commenced his labours, the length of the year had already been determined, the equinoxes and solstices had been recognized, the ecliptic, the celestial equator, and the poles of both great circles were known, and the five principal planets were familiar objects. This Early astronomy must have had its history, its stages of development, but we can only with difficulty trace them out. It cannot have sprung into existence full-grown any more than the other sciences; it must have started from zero, and men must have slowly fought their way from one observation to another, with gradually widening conceptions, before they could bring it even to that stage of development in which it was when the observers of the Museum of Alexandria began their work.  The books of the Old Testament were written at different times during the progress of this Early age of astronomy. We should therefore naturally expect to find the astronomical allusions written from the standpoint of such scientific knowledge as had then been acquired. We cannot for a moment expect that any supernatural revelation of purely material facts would be imparted to the writers of sacred books, two or three thousand years before the progress of science had brought those facts to light, and we ought not to be surprised if expressions are occasionally used which we should not ourselves use to-day, if we were writing about the phenomena of nature from a technical point of view. It must further be borne in mind that the astronomical references are not numerous, that they occur mostly in poetic imagery, and that Holy Scripture was not intended to give an account of the scientific achievements, if any, of the Hebrews of old. Its purpose was wholly different: it was religious, not scientific; it was meant to give spiritual, not intellectual enlightenment.  An exceedingly valuable and interesting work has recently been brought out by the most eminent of living Italian astronomers, Prof. G. V. Schiaparelli, on this subject of \"Astronomy in the Old Testament,\" to which work I should like here to acknowledge my indebtedness. Yet I feel that the avowed object of his book,[7:1]--to \"discover what ideas the ancient Jewish sages held regarding the structure of the universe, what observations they made of the stars, and how far they made use of them for the measurement and division of time\"--is open to this criticism,--that sufficient material for carrying it out is not within our reach. If we were to accept implicitly the argument from the silence of Scripture, we should conclude that the Hebrews--though their calendar was essentially a lunar one, based upon the actual observation of the new moon--had never noticed that the moon changed its apparent form as the month wore on, for there is no mention in the Bible of the lunar phases.  The references to the heavenly bodies in Scripture are not numerous, and deal with them either as time-measurers or as subjects for devout allusion, poetic simile, or symbolic use. But there is one characteristic of all these references to the phenomena of Nature, that may not be ignored. None of the ancients ever approached the great Hebrew writers in spiritual elevation; none equalled them in poetic sublimity; and few, if any, surpassed them in keenness of observation, or in quick sympathy with every work of the Creator.  These characteristics imply a natural fitness of the Hebrews for successful scientific work, and we should have a right to believe that under propitious circumstances they would have shown a pre-eminence in the field of physical research as striking as is the superiority of their religious conceptions over those of the surrounding nations. We cannot, of course, conceive of the average Jew as an Isaiah, any more than we can conceive of the average Englishman as a Shakespeare, yet the one man, like the other, is an index of the advancement and capacity of his race; nor could Isaiah's writings have been preserved, more than those of Shakespeare, without a true appreciation of them on the part of many of his countrymen.  But the necessary conditions for any great scientific development were lacking to Israel. A small nation, planted between powerful and aggressive empires, their history was for the most part the record of a struggle for bare existence; and after three or four centuries of the unequal conflict, first the one and then the other of the two sister kingdoms was overwhelmed. There was but little opportunity during these years of storm and stress for men to indulge in any curious searchings into the secrets of nature.  Once only was there a long interval of prosperity and peace; viz. from the time that David had consolidated the kingdom to the time when it suffered disruption under his grandson, Rehoboam; and it is significant that tradition has ascribed to Solomon and to his times just such a scientific activity as the ability and temperament of the Hebrew race would lead us to expect it to display when the conditions should be favourable for it.  Thus, in the fourth chapter of the First Book of Kings, not only are the attainments of Solomon himself described, but other men, contemporaries either of his father David or himself, are referred to, as distinguished in the same direction, though to a less degree.       \"And God gave Solomon wisdom and understanding exceeding much,      and largeness of heart, even as the sand that is on the      seashore. And Solomon's wisdom excelled the wisdom of all the      children of the east country, and all the wisdom of Egypt. For      he was wiser than all men; than Ethan the Ezrahite, and Heman,      and Chalcol, and Darda, the sons of Mahol: and his fame was in      all nations round about. And he spake three thousand proverbs:      and his songs were a thousand and five. And he spake of trees,      from the cedar-tree that is in Lebanon even unto the hyssop      that springeth out of the wall: he spake also of beasts, and      of fowl, and of creeping things, and of fishes. And there came      of all people to hear the wisdom of Solomon, from all kings of      the earth, which had heard of his wisdom.\"  The tradition of his great eminence in scientific research is also preserved in the words put into his mouth in the Book of the Wisdom of Solomon, now included in the Apocrypha.       \"For\" (God) \"Himself gave me an unerring knowledge of the      things that are, to know the constitution of the world, and      the operation of the elements; the beginning and end and      middle of times, the alternations of the solstices and the      changes of seasons, the circuits of years and the positions\"      (_margin_, constellations) \"of stars; the natures of living      creatures and the ragings of wild beasts, the violences of      winds and the thoughts of men, the diversities of plants and      the virtues of roots: all things that are either secret or      manifest I learned, for "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28540"],["title","Bibliomania; or Book-Madness (#1)"],["body","which modern custom does not seem to warrant), it will be obvious that a different arrangement could not have been adopted; and equally so that the perusal, first of the text, and afterwards of the notes, will be the better mode of passing judgment upon both._  T.F.D.  _Kensington, June_ 5, 1809.

[Illustration]  =The Bibliomania.=   MY DEAR SIR,  When the poetical Epistle of Dr. Ferriar, under the popular title of \"THE BIBLIOMANIA,\" was announced for publication, I honestly confess that, in common with many of my book-loving acquaintance, a strong sensation of fear and of hope possessed me: of fear, that I might have been accused, however indirectly, of having contributed towards the increase of this Mania; and of hope, that the true object of book-collecting, and literary pursuits, might have been fully and fairly developed. The perusal of this elegant epistle dissipated alike my fears and my hopes; for, instead of caustic verses, and satirical notes,[3] I found a smooth, melodious, and persuasive panegyric; unmixed, however, with any rules for the choice of books, or the regulation of study.       [Footnote 3: There are, nevertheless, some satirical      allusions which one could have wished had been suppressed.      For instance:            He turns where PYBUS rears his atlas-head           Or MADOC'S mass conceals its veins of lead;       What has Mr. Pybus's gorgeous book in praise of the late      Russian Emperor Paul I. (which some have called the      chef-d'oeuvre of Bensley's press[A]) to do with Mr.      Southey's fine Poem of Madoc?--in which, if there are \"veins      of lead,\" there are not a few \"of silver and gold.\" Of the      extraordinary talents of Mr. Southey, the indefatigable      student in ancient lore, and especially in all that regards      Spanish Literature and Old English Romances, this is not the      place to make mention. His \"_Remains of Henry Kirk White_,\"      the sweetest specimen of modern biography, has sunk into      every heart, and received an eulogy from every tongue. Yet      is his own life            \"The more endearing song.\"       Dr. Ferriar's next satirical verses are levelled at Mr.      THOMAS HOPE.            \"The lettered fop now takes a larger scope,           With classic furniture, design'd by HOPE.           (HOPE, whom upholsterers eye with mute despair,           The doughty pedant of an elbow chair.\")       It has appeared to me that Mr. Hope's magnificent volume on      \"_Household Furniture_\" has been generally misunderstood,      and, in a few instances, criticised upon false      principles.--The first question is, does the _subject_ admit      of illustration? and if so, has Mr. Hope illustrated it      properly? I believe there is no canon of criticism which      forbids the treating of such a subject; and, while we are      amused with archæological discussions on Roman tiles and      tesselated pavements, there seems to be no absurdity in      making the decorations of our sitting rooms, including      something more than the floor we walk upon, a subject at      least of temperate and classical disquisition. Suppose we      had found such a treatise in the volumes of Gronovius and      Montfaucon? (and are there not a few, apparently, as      unimportant and confined in these rich volumes of the      Treasures of Antiquity?) or suppose something similar to Mr.      Hope's work had been found among the ruins of Herculaneum?      Or, lastly, let us suppose the author had printed it only as      a _private_ book, to be circulated as a present! In each of      these instances, should we have heard the harsh censures      which have been thrown out against it? On the contrary, is      it not very probable that a wish might have been expressed      that \"so valuable a work ought to be made public.\"       Upon what principle, _a priori_, are we to ridicule and      condemn it? I know of none. We admit Vitruvius, Inigo Jones,      Gibbs, and Chambers, into our libraries: and why not Mr.      Hope's book? Is decoration to be confined only to the      exterior? and, if so, are works, which treat of these only,      to be read and applauded? Is the delicate bas-relief, and      beautifully carved column, to be thrust from the cabinet and      drawing room, to perish on the outside of a smoke-dried      portico? Or, is not _that_ the most deserving of      commendation which produces the most numerous and pleasing      associations of ideas? I recollect, when in company with the      excellent DR. JENNER,            ----[clarum et venerabile nomen           Gentibus, et multum nostræ quod proderat urbi]       and a half dozen more friends, we visited the splendid      apartments in Duchess Street, Portland Place, we were not      only struck with the appropriate arrangement of every thing,      but, on our leaving them, and coming out into the dull foggy      atmosphere of London, we acknowledged that the effect      produced upon our minds was something like that which might      have arisen had we been regaling ourselves on the silken      couches, and within the illuminated chambers, of some of the  "]]]
