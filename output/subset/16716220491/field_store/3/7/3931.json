Lasiurus intermedius insularis, new subspecies      _Holotype._--Adult female, preserved in alcohol but having skull     removed, formerly in the Poey Museum, University of Havana, now No.     81666, Museum of Natural History, University of Kansas, from     Cienfuegos, Las Villas Province, Cuba; obtained on January 23,     1948, by D. Gonzáles Muñoz.      _Geographic distribution._--Known only from the island of Cuba (see     Fig. 2).      _Diagnosis._--Large throughout (see measurements); sagittal crest     enormously developed, especially posteriorly (height above     braincase averaging 1.7 mm. in 4 specimens); interorbital region     narrow; M3 narrow; mesostyle of M1 and M2 and 2nd commissure and     cingulum of M3 small; pelage yellowish to reddish-brown.      _Comparisons._--From _Lasiurus intermedius intermedius_ of the     adjacent mainland of México, _L. i. insularis_ differs as follows:     Larger, both externally and cranially; sagittal crest relatively     higher, especially posteriorly; interorbital region relatively     narrower; palate longer posterior to tooth-rows; teeth distinctly     larger throughout except M3, which is relatively (frequently     actually) narrower, averaging 66.1 (62.5-71.0) per cent width of M2     in _insularis_ rather than 74.1 (66.6-79.3) per cent in 10     _intermedius_ from Brownsville, Texas; mesostyle of M1 and M2     relatively smaller as are second commissure and cingulum of M3;     coloration of No. 254714 USNM resembling that of _L. i.     intermedius_, but coloration of three specimens, preserved in     alcohol, averaging somewhat darker (more reddish-brown) than in     _intermedius_.  [Illustration: FIG. 2. Geographic distribution of the three subspecies of _Lasiurus intermedius_.      1. _L. i. floridanus_     2. _L. i. intermedius_     3. _L. i. insularis_  Black dots represent localities of capture of specimens examined. Hollow circles represent localities of capture of other specimens recorded in the literature but not examined by us (Hall and Jones).]      From _Lasiurus intermedius floridanus_ of the adjacent Floridan     mainland, _L. i. insularis_ differs in many of the same ways that     it differs from _L. i. intermedius_, except that the differences     are even more trenchant because _floridanus_ is smaller than     _intermedius_. Indeed, the difference in size between _floridanus_     and _insularis_ is approximately the same as between _Lasiurus     borealis_ and _Lasiurus cinereus_.      _Measurements._--External measurements (all taken from specimens     preserved in alcohol) of the holotype, followed by those of two     other females, one from Laguna La Deseada, San Cristóbal, Pinar del     Río Province, and the other from Bayate, Guantánamo, Oriente     Province, are, respectively: Total length, 164, 161, 150; length of     tail-vertebrae, 68, 76, 77; length of hind foot, 12, 12, 13; length     of ear from notch, 20, 17, 19; length of forearm, 61.2, 62.6, 61.8.     The length of forearm of a study skin from San Germán (that     otherwise lacks external measurements) having wings spread is     approximately 55.4. For cranial measurements see Table 1.  _Remarks._--Four of the five specimens on which the name _L. i. insularis_ is based differ to such a degree from mainland populations of the species _L. intermedius_ that specific rather than subspecific recognition for the Cuban bat might seem warranted. It is because of the fifth specimen (USNM 254714) that we accord subspecific rank to _insularis_. It is smaller than the other Cuban specimens and except for longer condylocanine length, longer mandibular tooth-rows, narrower interorbital region, and heavier dentition is indistinguishable in measurements from the largest"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31683"],["title","Noteworthy Mammals from Sinaloa, Mexico (#1)"],["body","); and Cerrito Loco, 2 mi. E La Palma, Michoacán (remains from owl pellets), by Baker and Alcorn (1953:116). The remains were referred to _evotis_ on geographic grounds in one instance and were so referred inferentially in the other. Examination of the specimens upon which these reports were based reveals that all are _crawfordi_ on the basis of characters previously cited. As a result, _N. evotis_ is known only from the type locality at Mazatlán, whereas _N. crawfordi_ is widely distributed on the Mexican Plateau as far south as Jalisco and northern Michoacán, and occurs on the west side of the Sierra Occidental as far south as northern Sinaloa.  The two kinds obviously are closely related and intergradation eventually may be demonstrated between them. But, for the present, we adopt a conservative course and treat _evotis_ as a full species owing to its distinctive features, restricted geographic distribution, and the lack of evidence of intergradation between it and _crawfordi_.  _=Balantiopteryx plicata pallida=_ Burt.--Thirty-five specimens from two adjacent localities along the Río del Fuerte in northern Sinaloa, 3 mi. NE San Miguel, 300 ft. (84944-48) and 10 mi. NNE Los Mochis (60572-75, 60667-78, 60681-94), provide the first records of the subspecies from the state. Individuals from both localities were shot at dusk as they foraged among trees in the valley of the river. Fifteen of 18 females from 10 mi. NNE Los Mochis, collected on June 5, 6 and 7, 1955, were pregnant; each contained a single embryo, the embryos ranging from 7 to 15 mm. in crown-rump length. _B. p. pallida_ previously has been reported from the southern parts of Baja California and Sonora.  _=Balantiopteryx plicata plicata=_ Peters.--Specimens in the Museum of Natural History from the following localities, several of which are marginal, document better than previously has been done the distribution of this subspecies in Sinaloa: 32 mi. SSE Culiacán (60699); 10 mi. SE Escuinapa (68629); 17 mi. SSE Guamúchil (60576); 5 mi. NW Mazatlán (85537-61, 85901-04); 1 mi. SE Mazatlán, 10 ft. (39461-76); 1 mi. S Pericos (60697-98, 60700); ½ mi. E Piaxtla (60701); ½ mi. W Rosario, 100 ft. (39477-79); 5 mi. SSE Rosario (60702-03); 4 mi. N Terrero (60695-96).  Pregnant females, each with a single embryo, were recorded in 1954 from 4 mi. N Terrero, 2 (June 9), 1 mi. S Pericos, 2 (June 13), and 5 mi. SSE Rosario, 2 (June 20). None of 16 December-taken females from 5 mi. NW Mazatlán was pregnant.  The specimen from 17 mi. SSE Guamúchil, preserved in alcohol, is provisionally referred to _B. p. plicata_ on geographic grounds inasmuch as specimens from the nearby localities of 1 mi. S Pericos and 4 mi. N Terrero, although more grayish on the average than specimens from southern Sinaloa, are somewhat darker and distinctly larger than specimens of _B. p. pallida_ from along the Río del Fuerte in northern Sinaloa. Specimens from southern Sinaloa average only slightly paler than typical _plicata_ examined from southern México and Nicaragua.  _=Pteronotus psilotis=_ (Dobson).--A total of six specimens from two localities in southern Sinaloa provide the first records from the state and are the northernmost records in western México. The two localities are: ½ mi. S Concepción, 250 ft. (84987-90); 1 mi. W Matatán (84985-86). The two individuals from the last-mentioned place extend the known range of the species approximately 275 miles north-northwest from a locality 7 mi. W, ½ mi. S Santiago, Colima (Anderson, 1956:349), and place the limit of the known distribution of _P. psilotis_ farther to the north in western México than in the eastern part of the country. We follow Burt and Stirton (1961:24-25) in use of the generic name _Pteronotus_ for this species.  The two specimens from 1 mi. W Matatán were shot at late dusk as they foraged with other bats, presumably of the same species, low over water at the place where the Río San Antonio joins the larger Río Baluarte. The four individuals from ½ mi. S Concepción were captured in mist nets stretched across the Río de las Cañas at the Sinaloa-Nayarit border, and were taken shortly after dark at heights of three feet or less above the water. Our six specimens all are males. Five are in the reddish color phase and one is in the brownish phase.       Average and extreme measurements of the six males, which average      slightly smaller than specimens examined from Colima and Guerrero,      are as follows: total length, 66.8 (65-69); length of tail, 16.3      (15-18); length of hind foot, 11.8 (11-12); length of ear from      notch, 16.9 (16.5-17.0); length of forearm (dry), 41.5 (40.6-42.4);      weight in grams, 8.3 (6.9-9.8); greatest length of skull, 15.4      (15.2-15.5); zygomatic breadth, 8.3 (8.2-8.4); interorbital      constriction, 3.4 (3.3-3.6); mastoid breadth, 8.7 (8.6-8.8); length      of maxillary tooth-row, 5.8 (5.8-5.9); breadth across M3, 5.4      (5.3-5.6).  _=Sturnira lilium parvidens=_ Goldman.--The first specimens to be reported from Sinaloa are as follows: 32 mi. SSE Culiacán (61087); 1 mi. S El Dorado (75207); Pánuco, 22 km. NE Concordia (85648-50). The three bats from the last-mentioned locality were caught after midnight in a mist net stretched across a road adjacent to a nearly dry stream bed. The vegetation in the vicinity of the net consisted mostly of dry weeds and grass along with some low shrubs, but a tree-filled canyon was about one-fourth mile above the net. We lack details about the capture of the other two bats.  _S. l. parvidens_ has been reported only once from farther north in western México than Sinaloa. Anderson (1960:7) recorded five specimens from along the Río Septentrión, 1½ mi. SW Tocuina, Chihuahua.  _=Artibeus lituratus palmarum=_ Allen and Chapman.--This species has been reported once previously from Sinaloa (from 1 mi. S El Dorado by Anderson, 1960:3). Six specimens (85668-72, 85674), all males, collected on December 23 and 24, 1960, at Pánuco, 22 km. NE Concordia, provide the second known occurrence in the state.  _=Artibeus toltecus=_ (Saussure).--A male (85666) from Pánuco, 22 km. NE Concordia, provides the first record of this species from Sinaloa and extends the known range northwestward approximately 182 miles from Ambas Aguas [= 6½ km. SW Amatlán de Jora], Nayarit (Andersen, 1908:300). Our specimen was taken on December 22, 1960, in a mist net placed across a road in an area where vegetation consisted mostly of weeds, grasses and shrubs. Two _Glossophaga soricina leachii_ and two _Choeronycteris mexicana_ were taken in the same net.  Davis' (1958:165-166) key is useful in separating the small Mexican members of the genus _Artibeus_, but we have found some adults of _toltecus_ to be smaller than the key indicates. For example, in the 12 Mexican specimens (Oaxaca, 6, Tamaulipas, 3, Jalisco, 2, Sinaloa, 1) examined by us the total length of skull varies from 19.7 to 21.0 and the forearm from 36.3 to 42.6.  Dalquest (1953) and more recently Koopman (1961) regarded _A. toltecus_ and the larger _A. aztecus_, which occurs in the same areas but at higher elevations than _toltecus_, as subspecies of the more southerly _A. cinereus_. Davis (_op. cit._), on the other hand, recognized _toltecus_, _aztecus_, and _cinereus_ as distinct species. More specimens of small and medium-sized _Artibeus_ are needed from México before this baffling complex can be studied adequately, but on the basis of specimens examined we are inclined to agree with Davis as concerns the specific distinctness of _toltecus_ and _aztecus_. In Tamaulipas (the mammalian fauna of which is currently under study by Alvarez) for example, _toltecus_ is known from Rancho Pano Ayuctle at an elevation of 300 feet in tropical deciduous forest, whereas _aztecus_ has been taken only four miles away at Rancho del Cielo, but at an elevation of 3000 feet in cloud forest. The altitudinal difference between ranges of the two kinds in Tamaulipas corresponds to that found in Sinaloa (see Koopman, _loc. cit._) and is of approximately the same magnitude found by Davis at higher elevations in Guerrero. This relationship suggests that the two kinds are neither subspecies of a single species, nor individual variants of a widespread, monotypic species, but probably are two different species. We agree that one, most likely the smaller _toltecus_, may eventually prove to be a northern subspecies of _cinereus_.  _=Myotis occultus=_ Hollister.--A single specimen of this species (67491) from 1 mi. N, ½ mi. E San Miguel provides the first certain record from Sinaloa, and is indistinguishable from specimens from Alamos, Sonora, that were referred to _occultus_ by Hall and Dalquest (1950:587). Miller and Allen (1928:100) identified a skin alone from Escuinapa as _occultus_, but Hall and Dalquest (_loc. cit._) later assigned this specimen provisionally to _M. fortidens_ on geographic grounds and because it agreed in color with undoubted specimens of the latter from Guerrero. Specimens from south of San Miguel and north of the undoubted range of _fortidens_ are needed in order to ascertain whether the two kinds are distinct species or instead only subspecies of a single species.  The Sinaloan bat was taken in a mist net stretched over a drainage ditch adjacent to the Río del Fuerte on the night of June 19-20, 1955, by R. H. Baker. Several other kinds of bats were obtained (shot or netted) at the same place, among which was one specimen of _Myotis velifer_. The specimens studied of _occultus_ from Sinaloa and Sonora are clearly separable from specimens of _velifer_ from the same region (Sonora and northern Sinaloa) in having paler (more reddish) pelage, shorter forearm, smaller skull, relatively broader rostrum, and four fewer teeth.  _=Myotis velifer velifer=_ (J. A. Allen).--Three specimens from the following localities in northern Sinaloa provide the first records of the species from the state: El Fuerte (75234); Río del Fuerte, 1 mi. N, "]]]
