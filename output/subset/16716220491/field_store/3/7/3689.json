I was drunker than I ought to be by midnight, so I said I was going for a walk. He tagged along and we wound up on a bench at Screwball Square. The soap-boxers were still going strong. Like I said, it was a nice night. After a while, a pot-bellied old auntie who didn't give a damn about the face sat down and tried to talk the kid into going to see some etchings. The kid didn't get it and I led him over to hear the soap-boxers before there was trouble.  One of the orators was a mush-mouthed evangelist. \"And, oh, my friends,\" he said, \"when I looked through the porthole of the spaceship and beheld the wonder of the Firmament--\"  \"You're a stinkin' Yankee liar!\" the kid yelled at him. \"You say one damn more word about can-shootin' and I'll ram your spaceship down your lyin' throat! Wheah's your redlines if you're such a hot spacer?\"  The crowd didn't know what he was talking about, but \"wheah's your redlines\" sounded good to them, so they heckled mush-mouth off his box with it.  I got the kid to a bench. The liquor was working in him all of a sudden. He simmered down after a while and asked: \"Doc, should I've given Miz Rorty some money? I asked her afterward and she said she'd admire to have something to remember me by, so I gave her my lighter. She seem' to be real pleased with it. But I was wondering if maybe I embarrassed her by asking her right out. Like I tol' you, back in Covington, Kentucky, we don't have places like that. Or maybe we did and I just didn't know about them. But what do you think I should've done about Miz Rorty?\"  \"Just what you did,\" I told him. \"If they want money, they ask you for it first. Where you staying?\"  \"Y.M.C.A.,\" he said, almost asleep. \"Back in Covington, Kentucky, I was a member of the Y and I kept up my membership. They have to let me in because I'm a member. Spacers have all kinds of trouble, Doc. Woman trouble. Hotel trouble. Fam'ly trouble. Religious trouble. I was raised a Southern Baptist, but wheah's Heaven, anyway? I ask' Doctor Chitwood las' time home before the redlines got so thick--Doc, you aren't a minister of the Gospel, are you? I hope I di'n' say anything to offend you.\"  \"No offense, son,\" I said. \"No offense.\"  I walked him to the avenue and waited for a fleet cab. It was almost five minutes. The independents that roll drunks dent the fenders of fleet cabs if they show up in Skid Row and then the fleet drivers have to make reports on their own time to the company. It keeps them away. But I got one and dumped the kid in.  \"The Y Hotel,\" I told the driver. \"Here's five. Help him in when you get there.\"         *       *       *       *       *  When I walked through Screwball Square again, some college kids were yelling \"wheah's your redlines\" at old Charlie, the last of the Wobblies.  Old Charlie kept roaring: \"The hell with your breadlines! I'm talking about atomic bombs. _Right--up--there!_\" And he pointed at the Moon.  It was a nice night, but the liquor was dying in me.  There was a joint around the corner, so I went in and had a drink to carry me to the club; I had a bottle there. I got into the first cab that came.  \"Athletic Club,\" I said.  \"Inna dawghouse, harh?\" the driver said, and he gave me a big personality smile.  I didn't say anything and he started the car.  He was right, of course. I was in everybody's doghouse. Some day I'd scare hell out of Tom and Lise by going home and showing them what their daddy looked like.  Down at the Institute, I was in the doghouse.  \"Oh, dear,\" everybody at the Institute said to everybody, \"I'm sure I don't know what ails the man. A lovely wife and two lovely grown children and she had to tell him 'either you go or I go.' And _drinking_! And this is rather subtle, but it's a well-known fact that neurotics seek out low company to compensate for their guilt-feelings. The _places_ he frequents. Doctor Francis Bowman, the man who made space-flight a reality. The man who put the Bomb Base on the Moon! Really, I'm sure I don't know what ails him.\"  The hell with them all.                                                       --C. M.

I always knew Armitage was a pompous toad, but I never realized he was _slimy_.  This afternoon it was game all, and Armitage overcalled my diamond opener with three spades. Bishop took him to four and I doubled, counting on my ace-king of hearts and diamonds.  I led out my diamond ace and Armitage trumped from his hand. Bishop laid down his dummy. He had clubs and spades solid, with doubleton heart and diamonds.  \"None?\" Max asked Armitage dangerously.  Armitage tittered. I wanted to scratch his eyes out. He drew trump immediately and set up clubs on board, dumping the heart losers from his hand, and finally sluffing--_two diamonds_.  \"Made seven,\" he said complacently, \"less two for the diamond renege makes five, one overtrick doubled. We were vulnerable, so it's game and rubber.\"  I gasped. \"You reneged deliberately!\"  \"Certainly. Doubleton in hearts and diamonds in my hand. If you get in, I'm down one. As it was, I made an overtrick. The only penalty for a renege is two tricks. The rule book does not differentiate between deliberate and accidental reneges. Sorry.\"  I stared at his florid throat, at his jugular. I could feel my mouth twitching.  On the next hand I was dummy. I excused myself and went into the lab. I found a scalpel. I came up quietly behind Armitage and Bishop saw what I was going to do and shouted and I was not nearly fast enough. Armitage ducked and Bishop tackled me.  \"Thanks, dear,\" Max said thoughtfully, looking at the cards scattered on the floor. \"We would have been set one trick. Club finesse fails.\"  \"She's crazy!\" Armitage's mouth worked. \"The strain's too much for her!\"  I cried. I apologized hysterically. After a while, I convinced them I was all right. Max gave me a sedative. We did not play any more bridge. Over supper I kept staring at Armitage's throat.  After eating, I went for a long walk. When I got back to the ship, everyone was sleeping.         *       *       *       *       *  _March 1_  Bishop found Armitage this morning, in his cabin. He came out, very pale, staring at me.  \"You bitch,\" he said. \"Ear to ear. Now what'll I do for a partner?\"  \"You can't prove it,\" I said.  \"We'll have to confine her to quarters,\" Max said wearily. \"I'll tell Farragut.\"  \"And let him know the expedition is failing?\"  Max sighed. \"You're right. We'll tell them Armitage had an accident.\"  I said seriously, \"It was obviously suicide. His mind snapped.\"  \"Oh, God,\" Max said.  They buried Armitage this afternoon. From my cabin, I watched them dig the grave.  Cheaters never prosper.         *       *       *       *       *  _March 2_  Max talked with Senator Farragut this morning. He said Armitage had died a hero's death. Farragut sounds worried. The Pan-Asians have withdrawn their embassy from Imperial Africa. Tension is mounting on the home front. Immigration _must_ start this week. Max was very reassuring. \"Just a few final tests, Senator. We want to make sure.\"  We puttered in our laboratories all afternoon. Bishop seemed bored. After dinner he suggested three-handed bridge and Max said he knew a better game, a friendly game his grandmother had taught him--hearts.         *       *       *       *       *  _March 5_  It's a plot!  All day long Bishop and Max have managed to give me the queen of spades. It's deliberate, of course. Three times I've tried for the moon and Bishop has held out one damned little heart at the end. Once Max was slightly ahead on points and Bishop demanded to see the score. I thought for a moment they would come to blows, but Bishop apologized.  \"It's just that I hate to lose,\" he said.  \"Quite,\" Max said.  When we finally turned in, Bishop was ahead on points.  Too far ahead.         *       *       *       *       *  _March 6_  I suppose it's Bishop's laugh. It has a peculiar horselike stridency that makes me want to tear out his throat. Twice today I've broken down and cried when he made a jackpot.  I'm not going to cry any more.  Supper was the usual, beef-yeast and vita-ale. I remember setting Bishop's plate in front of him, and the way his pale eyes gleamed between mouthfuls. \"Three thousand points ahead,\" he gloated. \"You'll never catch me now. Never, never!\"  That was when he gripped his throat and began writhing on the floor.  Max felt his pulse. He stared at me.  \"Very nice,\" he said. \"Quick. Did you use a derivative of that green fungus?\"  I said nothing. Max's nostrils were white and pinched. \"Must I make an autopsy?\"  \"Why bother?\" I said. \"It's obviously heart failure.\"  \"Yes, why bother?\" he said. He looked tired. \"Stay in your cabin, Greta. I'll bring your meals.\"  \"I don't trust you.\"  His laughter had a touch of madness.         *       *       *       *       *  _March 10_  Max unlocked my cabin door this morning. He looked drawn. \"Listen,\" he said. \"I've checked my respiration, pulse, saliva, temperature. All normal.\"  \"So?\"  \"Come here,\" he said. I followed him into the lab. He indicated a microscope. His eyes were bright.  \"Well?\"  \"A drop of my blood,\" he said. \"Look.\"  I squinted into the microscope. I saw purple discs. Oddly, they did not attack the red blood cells. There was no fission, no mitosis. The leucocytes, strangely enough, let them alone.  My hands were shaking as I took a sterile slide and pricked my finger. I put the slide under the microscope. I adjusted the lens and stared.  Purple discs, swimming in my bloodstream. Thriving. Minding their own business.  \"Me, too,\" I said.  \"They're inert,\" Max said hoarsely. \"They don't affect metabolism, cause fever, or interfere with the body chemistry in any way. Do they remind you of anything?\"  I thought about it. Then I went to the slide file that was marked _flora--negative_.  \"Right,\" Max said. \"The purple thistle. Spores! The atmosphere is clogged with them. Greta, my sweet, we're infected.\"  \"I feel fine,\" I said.  All day long we ran tests. Negative tests. We seem to be disgustingly healthy. \"Symbiosis,\" Max said finally. \"Live and let live. Apparently we're hosts.\"  Only one thing disturbs me.  Most symbiotes _do_ something for their host. Something to enhance the host's survival potential.  We played chess this evening. I won. Max is furious. He's such a poor sport.         *       *       *       *       *  _March 11_  Max talked with Senator Farragut this morning. He gave Epsilon a clean bill of health and the Senator thanked God. \"The first starship will leave tonight,\" the Senator said. \"Right on schedule, with ten thousand colonists aboard. You're world heroes!\"  Max and I played chess the rest of the day. Max won consistently. He utilizes a fianchetto that is utterly impregnable. If he wins tomorrow, I shall have to kill him.         *       *       *       *       *  MAX  _March 13_  It was, of course, necessary for me to destroy Armitage and Bishop. They won far too often. But I am sorry about Greta. Yet I had to strangle her.  If she hadn't started that infernal queen's pawn opening it would have been different. She beat me six times running, and on the last game I pulled a superb orang-outang, but it was too late. She saw mate in four and gave me that serpent smirk I know so well.  How could I have ever been in love with her?         *       *       *       *       *  _March 14_  Frightfully boring to be alone. I have a thought. Chess. Right hand against left. White and black. Jolly good.         *       *       *       *       *  _March 16_  I haven't much time.  Left was black this morning and I beat him, four out of five. We're in the lab now. He's watching me scribble this. His thumb and forefinger are twitching in fury. He looks like some great white spider about to spring.  He sees the scalpel, by the microscope. Now his fingers are inching toward it. Treacherous beast. I'm stronger. If he tries to amputate ...                                                          --JAMES CAUSEY     Transcriber's Note:      This etext was produced from _Galaxy Science Fiction_ May 1955.
