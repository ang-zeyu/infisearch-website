Promise 'em double rations till we get to Shelbyville.\"  \"Stop swearin', there, you fellers. You've frozen 'em stiff with your bad language. Pray with 'em.\"  \"Read them the Emancipation Proclamation.\"  \"Call 'em pet names. You can do anything with kindness. Even a mule has, a heart.\"  \"Bring up the band and serenade 'em.\"  Shorty was raging around the team, kicking and striking first at one mule and then at another, and swearing like a pirate, alternately at the team and then at the jeering crowds. Si was following suit to the best of his ability, but his pious education had left him out of sight of Shorty when it came to using language that the occasion seemed to justify. He had, however, yanked Groundhog out of the saddle and driven him up the bank, where he sat down and grinned at the confusion which had overtaken his enemies.  Setting a man at the head of each mule to coax and encourage him, and the rest of the company to pushing and prying on the wagon, Si had mounted the wheel-mule himself and put forth his mule-knowledge in one feverish effort, which was as futile as it was desperate, for the mules did not seem to change their positions for a rest, even, when the wagon was forced forward on them.  A very dapper young Aid, fresh from West Point, and with that high appreciation for himself that can only be acquired at the United States Military Academy, galloped up, sternly ordering everybody to make way for him, and,  \"Present the compliments of the Major-General commanding the division, and what the h--'s the matter?\"  \"Capt. McGillicuddy, to whom the young gentle man had been referred as in charge, said quietly:  \"You see: A mule-team has balked and stopped everything. We're doing our best to start them, but so far without success.\"  \"So we all perceive,\" said the young man superciliously. \"Why are you not down there directing them?\"  \"The men that I have down there thoroughly understand mules, and are doing their very utmost. They are having, as you can see, a superfluity of advice which is not helping them. I can best help by letting them alone to work it out their own way. They will do all that men can.\"  \"I shall report the case to the General,\" said the Aid, with scarcely-concealed insolence. \"Just like these confounded volunteers,\" he said as he turned away, taking no pains to keep the Captain from overhearing. \"Never will be genuine soldiers in the world. Here, my men,\" continued he, riding over to the wagon, \"stir yourselves lively, now, and start these wagons along. I want no more fooling, and won't have it. Start, now.\"  Shorty had the usual volunteer dislike to young West Pointers; like the rest of the men he cordially hated and ridiculed the young and airy staff officers, whether from West Point or not. It irritated him to see the youngster's treatment of his Captain. Saying snappy things at and about the Captain was a privilege jealously reserved to members of the company. To have anybody outside abuse the Captain was an insult to be resented. Above all, his American soul rose in wrath at the patronizing \"my men.\" He would not have been at all offended at one of his own rough-and-ready officers jumping in and distributing curses on all hands, but \"my men\" was too much for him.  Without appearing to notice the presence of the Aid, Shorty walked up to the lead-mule, gave him a tremendous kick in the ribs, and sung out in a tone loud enough to be heard across the roaring branch:  \"You pernickety pile o' poll-evil; you hee-hawin' graduate o' West Point; you pin-feathered, taller-faced, pop-eyed, lantern-jawed, loud-mouthed Second Lieutenant, you, won't you git up?\"  The other boys began to catch on and grin. The Aid's face flushed, but Shorty continued his loud objurgations at the mule:  \"You misbegotten pill o' perdition; you pompous, puddin'-headed staff officer; you miserable errand-boy for the General, puttin' on more airs than the General; you half-hatched officer, runnin' around yit with the shell on your head, and pretendin' to be cock-o'-the-walk, won't you git up?\"  Even the Aid began to understand the drift of Shorty's remarks by this time, and Capt. McGillicuddy called out warningly:  \"Shorty! Shorty!\"'  Si looked in amazement at this new development of his partner's genius. The officers and men on the other side of the branch seemed to have forgotten for the moment the annoyance of the balked team in enjoyment of Shorty's outburst.  \"Why under heaven they put such murrain cattle as you in the army I can't tell,\" he continued with another savage kick in the mule's side. \"You only take up room from your betters. You don't fight, you only strut like a turkey-cock, and eat and he-haw. Now, will you git up?\"  The Aid could not fail to understand now. He burst out in a torrent of rage: \"You infernal scoundrel,\" he shouted, forcing his horse up to Shorty; \"I'll have you shot for insubordination, for insulting and mutinous language to your superior officer.\"  \"I wasn't sayin' nothin' to you,\" said Shorty, looking up with an air of surprise. \"I hain't had nothin' to do with you. I was cussin' this other piebald pilgarlic from West Point; this other pig headed pickaninny o' the Regular Army; this Brevet-Second Lieutenant o' the Quartermaster's Department, and Aid on the staff o' Gen. Groundhog. You ain't my superior officer, nohow.\"  \"Corporal,\" shouted the Aid to Si, \"take this rascal up there on the bank and buck-and-gag him. Do it at once.\"  \"I don't believe you have the right to give me orders, sir,\" said Si respectfully. \"I am under Capt. McGillicuddy's orders.\"  \"You are right, Corporal,\" said Capt. McGillicuddy, stepping forward. \"Lieutenant, you cannot order one of my men to be punished. You have no right to command here. You are merely to convey the General's orders to those who are in command.\"  \"I have the right to give orders. I represent the General, and speak in his name, and I order that man to be bucked-and-gagged,\" reiterated the Aid in a flame of anger. \"I'll see that it is done. I shall not be so insulted before the whole army. It will destroy all discipline.\"  \"Fortunately, the discipline of the army does not depend on the respect shown Second Lieutenants,\" Capt. McGillicuddy could not help saying. \"If you have any complaint to make against one of my men, state it to me, their Captain, or to the Colonel of the regiment. We are the persons, not you, to deal with them.\"  The men around understood; nothing pleased them better than to see a bumptious young Aid sat down upon, and they were outspoken in their delight.  \"I shall report you to the General, and have you court-martialed,\" said the Aid, shaking his fist at Capt. McGillicuddy. \"I shall!\"  \"Mr. Farwell,\" said the Chief of Staff, riding up, \"why haven't you reported to the General as to the trouble here? We've been waiting for you.\"  \"Here,\" came the clear-cut tones of the Colonel across the branch; \"no use of wasting any more time on those mules. They're there to stay. Unhitch them, fasten on a picket-rope, and we'll pull the wagon across from this side.\"  Everybody sprang to execute this order, but Si and Shorty's hands had not reached the traces when an idea seemed to shoot simultaneously through each of the six mules, and with one impulse they plunged ahead, directly into the swollen waters.  Si and Shorty sprang back toward their heads to guide them over the narrow crossing. But the mules seemed to take the right course by instinct, and landed the wagon safely on the other side, without a particle of water entering the bed. Everybody cheered, and Si and Shorty looked as if their minds had been relieved of a terrible load.  \"Si,\" said Shorty, with a tinge of weariness in his tone, \"they say it is about 18 miles from here to Shelbyville.\"  \"Somethin' like that,\" answered Si.  \"I think there are about three o' these cricks to every mile. Do you really suppose we'll be able to git there before our three years is up?\"  \"All depends on the mules,\" answered Si cheerily. \"If this sudden spell o' goodness holds out we may get there before evening.\"    CHAPTER III. THIRD DAY OF THE DELUGE  TOILSOME PLODDING, AND \"SHELBYVILLE ONLY 15 MILES AWAY.\"  IT SEEMS impossible, but the third day's rain was even worse than that of the two preceding. The drops seemed much larger, to follow each other faster, and with less interval between the downpours.  \"Does it always rain this way in June down here?\" Si asked a patriarch, who was sitting on his porch by the roadside in a split-bottomed rocking-chair, resting his bony hands on a cane, the head of which was a ram's horn, smoking a corn-cob pipe and watching the passing column with lack-luster eyes.  \"Sah,\" said the sage, poking down the ashes in his pipe with his little finger, \"I've done lived in the Duck River Valley ever sence Capting Jimmy Madison wuz elected President the fust time, and I never seed sich a wet spell as this afore. I reckon hit's all along o' the wah. We allers have a powerful sight o' rain in wah times. Hit rained powerful when Jinerul Jackson wuz foutin' the Injuns down at Hoss Shoe Bend, and the Summers durin' the Mexican war wuz mouty wet, but they didn't hold a candle to what we're havin' this yeah. Hit's the shootin' and bangin', I reckon, that jostles the clouds so's they can't hold in.\"  \"How far is it to Shelbyville, Gran'pap?\" asked Shorty.  [Illustration: 'DON'T CALL ME YOUR GRAN'PAP.' 35]  \"Don't call me yer gran-pap,\" piped out the old man in angry falsetto, and shaking his cane. \"I won't stand hit. I won't stand everything. I've had enough ter stand from you Yankees already. You've stole my chickens an' robbed my smoke-house, an' run off my stock, an' I've done"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31775"],["title","Si Klegg, Book 5 (#1)"],["body","away the bigger part of the broth to those who so desperately needed it.  \"No, Shorty,\" said the prudent Deacon. \"Our first duty is to ourselves. We kin help them by gittin' you and Si on your feet. We can't feed the whole Army o' the Cumberland, though I'd like to.\"  A generous cupful was set aside for Capt. McGillicuddy, which his servant received with gratitude and glowing reports of the good the former supply had done him.  With the daylight came the usual shells from the rebel guns on Lookout Mountain. Even the Deacon was getting used to this noisy salutation to the morn, and he watched the shells strike harmlessly in the distance with little tremor of his nerves. As the firing ceased, amid the derisive yells of the army, he said quietly:  [Illustration: GIT DOWN FROM THERE! COMMANDED THE DEACON 21]   \"That last shell's saved me a good deal o' work diggin'. It, tore out a hole that'll just do to bury the carcasses of these dogs.\"  Accordingly, he dragged the carcasses over after breakfast, and threw the dirt back in the hole upon them.  The two remaining chickens were stowed in a haversack, and during the day hung outside from the ridge-pole of the crib, where they were constantly under the eye of either the Deacon or Shorty, who took turns watching them. That night the Deacon slept with them under his head, though they were beginning to turn a little, and their increasing gameness brought a still larger herd of dogs about. But the Deacon had securely fastened the door, and he let them rage around as they pleased.  When they were cooked and eaten the next morning the Deacon became oppressed with anxious thought. Where were the next to come from? The boys had improved so remarkably that he was doubly anxious to continue the nourishing diet, which he felt was necessary to secure their speedy recovery. Without it they would probably relapse.  He could think of nothing but to go back again to the valley where he got the chickens, and this seemed a most desperate chance, for the moment that either of the old couple set eyes on him he or she would give the alarm. He went to sleep thinking about the matter, and when he rose up in the morning, and had nothing to offer his boys but the coarse and uninviting hardtack, pork and coffee, he made up his mind to take the chances, whatever they might be. He set out again immediately after breakfast, and by cutting across the mountain came to the entrance to the valley a little after noon. Keeping close under cover of the woods, he approached within sight of the house, and carefully scanned it. What to do he had scarcely planned. He was only determined to have some fresh meat to take back to camp. He was going to get it as honestly and fairly as he could, but fresh meat he must have.  He could see no other house anywhere in the distance, and probably if he went farther he would run into rebel bushwhackers and guerrillas, who were watching from the high ridges. So long as he kept under cover of the woods he would feel all right, for he was as skilled in woodcraft as any of them, and could take care of himself. But if he should come out into the open fields and road to cross the valley they would have him at an advantage. He was confirmed in this fear by seeing several little clouds of smoke rise up above the tops of the trees on the ridge.  \"There's a gang of rebels in camp over there,\" said he to himself, with a woodman's quick reading of every sign. \"That smoke's from their fires. 'Tain't enough of it to be clearin' ground; people ain't clearin' up at this time o' year; that ground over there ain't the kind they'd clear up for anything. 'Twouldn't raise white beans if it was cleared; and you don't hear nobody choppin'.\"  He looked again at the house. Everything was very quiet and peaceful around it. There was no stock in the barnyard or fields, and the only signs of life were the smoke rising from one of the great stone chimneys, the chickens picking and scratching in the garden, a couple of negresses, who occasionlly passed back and forth between the main house and another cabin apparently used as a kitchen.  The Deacon had almost made up his mind to march boldly down to the house, snatch up a few of the chickens, and make his way back to the woods again, before the old couple could summon assistance. Suddenly his quick eyes caught a glimpse of something at a point where the road from the ridge came down out of the woods. Then that something developed into a man on horseback, who rode forward to a little rise, stopped, and surveyed the landscape cautiously, and then rode forward toward the house.  He dismounted and entered the house. In a few minutes there appeared unusual bustle and activity, during which the man rode back again, munching as he went at a piece of cornpone and one of meat, which he had gotten at the house, and held in either hand, while his reins lay on his horse's neck.  The old woman came out into the yard with some meat in her hand, and the shrill note of her orders to the negresses reached the Deacon's ears, though he could not make out the words. But he saw one of them go to the spring and bring water, which she poured in a wash-kettle set up in the yard, while the old woman prepared the beef and put it in, the other negress started a fire, and the old man chopped and split wood to put around the kettle and fill the stone oven near by.  \"They're cookin' vittels for them rebels on the ridge.\" The Deacon correctly diagnosed the situation. \"By-and-by they'll come for 'em, or take 'em to 'em. Mebbe I kin find some way to collar some of 'em. It's a slim chance, but no other seems to show up just now. If no more'n one man comes for that grub I'm goin' to jump him.\"  The Deacon looked at the caps on his revolver and began laying plans for a strategic advance under the cover of the sumachs to a point where he could command the road to the house.  His cheek paled for an instant as the thought obtruded that the man might resist and he have to really shoot him.  \"I don't want to shoot nobody,\" he communed with himself, \"and it won't 'be necessary if the other fellow is only sensible and sees, that I've got the drop on him, which I will have before I say a word. Anyway, I want that grub for a work of necessity and mercy, which justifies many things, and as a loyal man I ought to keep it from goin' to rebels. If I've got to put a bullet into another feller, why, the Lord'll hold me guiltless and blame the other feller. I ain't no Free Will Baptist. I believe things 've bin foreordained. Wisht I knowed that it was foreordained that I was to git that grub back to Si and Shorty.\"  Presently he saw the old man come out and take a path into the woods. He cautiously circled around to where he could follow and watch him. He saw him make his way to a secluded little cove, where there was a corn-crib partially filled and a rude shelter, under which were a buckboard and fairly-good young horse. The old man began putting the clumsy harness of ropes, chains and patched leather on the horse and hitching him to the buckboard.  \"Good, the old man's goin' to take the grub out to 'em himself,\" thought the Deacon with relief. \"He'll be easy to manage. No need o' shootin' him.\"  He hurried back to his covert, and then shpped unseen down to where he had selected for his ambush. The old man drove the buckboard around to the front of the house, and the negresses, obeying the shrill orders of the old woman, brought out pones of smoking cornbread, and buckets, tin pans and crocks containing the meat, potatoes, turnips and other food, and loaded them on to the buckboard. The fragrance of the food reached the Deacon's nostrils, and made his mouth water and fond anticipations rise as to the good it would do the boys.  \"I'll have that grub, and the boys shall have it,\" he determined, \"or there'll be an Injianny Deacon pretty badly used up.\"  The old man mounted into the seat, gathered up the rope lines, and chirruped to the horse to start.  When he came opposite, the Deacon jumped out, seized the reins, and pointing his revolver at him, commanded sternly:  \"Git down from there, and git down quick.\"  The old man dropped the lines, and for an instant gazed at him with scared eyes.  \"Why, yo' robber, what d'yo' mean?\" he gasped.  \"Git down from there, and git down quick!\" repeated the Deacon.  \"Why, this is highway robbery, threats, puttin' in bodily fear, attempted murder, hoss-stealin'.\"  \"Hain't no time to argy law with you,\" said the Deacon impatiently. \"This ain't no court-room. You ain't in session now. Git down, and git down quick!\"  \"Help! help! murder! robbery! thieves!\" shouted the old man, at the top of his voice.  The negresses, who had been watching their master depart, set to screaming, and the old woman rushed back into the house and blew the horn. The Deacon thrust his revolver back into the holster, caught the old man with his sinewy hand, tore him from the seat, and flung him into the fence-corner. He sprang into the seat, turned the horse's head toward Chattanooga, and hit him a sharp cut with a switch that lay in the wagon.  \"I've got about three miles the start,\" he said as he rattled off. \"This horse's young and fresh, while their's probably run down. The road from here to the main road's tollably good, and I think I kin git there before they kin overtake me.\"  At the top of the hill he looked back, and saw the rebels coming out. Apparently they had not understood what had happened. They had seen no Yankees and could not have seen the Deacon's tussle with the old man. They supposed that the holler simply meant for them to come in and get their dinner, instead of having it taken out to them. All this passed through the Deacon's mind, and he chuckled over the additional start it would give him.  \"They won't find out nothin' till they git clean to the house,\" he said. \"By that time I'll be mighty nigh the main road. My, but wouldn't I like to have as many dollars as "]]]
