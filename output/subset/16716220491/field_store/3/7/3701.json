She and her husband slept on the second floor, and the two girls on the third. Everything was upside down, and as Madame M---- F---- had something to say to the landlady she asked me to go up with her daughters. It was cold, and the room we entered had no fire in it. The sister went into the room adjoining and I stayed with Sara, and all of a sudden I clasped her to my breast, and feeling that her desires were as ardent as mine I fell with her on to a sofa where we mingled our beings in all the delights of voluptuous ardours. But this happiness was short lived; scarcely was the work achieved when we heard a footstep on the stair. It was the father.  If M---- F---- had had any eyes he must have found us out, for my face bore the marks of agitation, the nature of which it was easy to divine. We exchanged a few brief compliments; I shook his hand and disappeared. I was in such a state of excitement when I got home that I made up my mind to leave England and to follow Sara to Switzerland. In the night I formed my plans, and resolved to offer the family my house during the time they stayed in England, and if necessary to force them to accept my offer.  In the morning I hastened to call on M---- F----, and found him on his doorstep.  \"I am going to try and get a couple of rooms,\" said he.  \"They are already found,\" I replied. \"My house is at your service, and you must give me the preference. Let us come upstairs.\"  \"Everybody is in bed.\"  \"Never mind,\" said I, and we proceeded to go upstairs.  Madame M---- F---- apologized for being in bed. Her husband told her that I wanted to let them some rooms, but I laughed and said I desired they would accept my hospitality as that of a friend. After some polite denials my offer was accepted, and it was agreed that the whole family should take up their quarters with me in the evening.  I went home, and was giving the necessary orders when I was told that two young ladies wished to see me. I went down in person, and I was agreeably surprised to see Sara and her sister. I asked them to come in, and Sara told me that the landlady would not let their belongings out of the house before her father paid a debt of forty guineas, although a city merchant had assured her it should be settled in a week. The long and snort of it was that Sara's father had sent me a bill and begged me to discount it.  I took the bill and gave her a bank note for fifty pounds in exchange, telling her that she could give me the change another time. She thanked me with great simplicity and went her way, leaving me delighted with the confidence she had placed in me.  The fact of M. M---- F----'s wanting forty guineas did not make me divine that he was in some straits, for I looked at everything through rose-coloured glasses, and was only too happy to be of service to him.  I made a slight dinner in order to have a better appetite for supper, and spent the afternoon in writing letters. In the evening M. M---- F----'s man came with three great trunks and innumerable card-board boxes, telling me that the family would soon follow; but I awaited them in vain till nine o'clock. I began to get alarmed and went to the house, where I found them all in a state of consternation. Two ill-looking fellows who were in the room enlightened me; and assuming a jovial and unconcerned air, I said,--  \"I'll wager, now, that this is the work of some fierce creditor.\"  \"You are right,\" answered the father, \"but I am sure of discharging the debt in five or six days, and that's why I put off my departure.\"  \"Then you were arrested after you had sent on your trunks.\"  \"Just after.\"  \"And what have you done?\"  \"I have sent for bail.\"  \"Why did you not send to me?\"  \"Thank you, I am grateful for your kindness, but you are a foreigner, and sureties have to be householders.\"  \"But you ought to have told me what had happened, for I have got you an excellent supper, and I am dying of hunger.\"  It was possible that this debt might exceed my means, so I did not dare to offer to pay it. I took Sara aside, and on hearing that all his trouble was on account of a debt of a hundred and fifty pounds, I asked the bailiff whether we could go away if the debt was paid.  \"Certainly,\" said he, shewing me the bill of exchange.  I took out three bank notes of fifty pounds each, and gave them to the man, and taking the bill I said to the poor Swiss,--  \"You shall pay me the money before you leave England.\"  The whole family wept with joy, and after embracing them all I summoned them to come and sup with me and forget the troubles of life.  We drove off to my house and had a merry supper, though the worthy mother could not quite forget her sadness. After supper I took them to the rooms which had been prepared for them, and with which they were delighted, and so I wished them good night, telling them that they should be well entertained till their departure, and that I hoped to follow them into Switzerland.  When I awoke the next day I was in a happy frame of mind. On examining my desires I found that they had grown too strong to be overcome, but I did not wish to overcome them. I loved Sara, and I felt so certain of possessing her that I put all desires out of my mind; desires are born only of doubt, and doubt torments the soul. Sara was mine; she had given herself to me out of pure passion, without any shadow of self-interest.  I went to the father's room, and found him engaged in opening his trunks. His wife looked sad, so I asked her if she were not well. She replied that her health was perfect, but that the thought of the sea voyage troubled her sorely. The father begged me to excuse him at breakfast as he had business to attend to. The two young ladies came down, and after we had breakfast I asked the mother why they were unpacking their trunks so short a time before starting. She smiled and said that one trunk would be ample for all their possessions, as they had resolved to sell all superfluities. As I had seen some beautiful dresses, fine linen, and exquisite lace, I could not refrain from saying that it would be a great pity to sell cheaply what would have to be replaced dearly.  \"You are right,\" she said, \"but, nevertheless, there is no pleasure so great as the consciousness of having paid one's debts.\"  \"You must not sell anything,\" I replied, in a lively manner, \"for as I am going to Switzerland with you I can pay your debts, and you shall repay me when you can.\"  At these words astonishment was depicted on her face.  \"I did not think you were speaking seriously,\" said she.  \"Perfectly seriously, and here is the object of my vows.\"  With these words I seized Sara's hand and covered it with kisses.  Sara blushed, said nothing, and the mother looked kindly at us; but after a moment's silence she spoke at some length, and with the utmost candour and wisdom. She gave me circumstantial information as to the position of the family and her husband's restricted means, saying that under the circumstances he could not have avoided running into debt, but that he had done wrong to bring them all with him to London.  \"If he had been by himself,\" she said, \"he could have lived here comfortably enough with only one servant, but with a family to provide for the two thousand crowns per annum provided by the Government are quite insufficient. My old father has succeeded in persuading the State to discharge my husband's debts, but to make up the extra expense they will not employ a Charge d'affaires; a banker with the title of agent will collect the interest on their English securities.\"  She ended by saying that she thought Sara was fortunate to have pleased me, but that she was not sure whether her husband would consent to the marriage.  The word \"marriage\" made Sara blush, and I was pleased, though it was evident there would be difficulties in the way.  M---- F---- came back and told his wife that two clothes dealers would come to purchase their superfluous clothes in the afternoon; but after explaining my ideas I had not much trouble in convincing him that it would be better not to sell them, and that he could become my debtor to the amount of two hundred pounds, on which he could pay interest till he was able to return me my capital. The agreement was written out the same day, but I did not mention the marriage question, as his wife had told me she would discuss it with him in private.  On the third day he came down by himself to talk with me.  \"My wife,\" he began, \"has told me of your intentions, and I take it as a great honour, I assure you; but I cannot give you my Sara, as she is promised to M. de W----, and family reasons prevent me from going back from my word. Besides my old father, a strict Calvinist, would object to the difference in religion. He would never believe that his dear little grandchild would be happy with a Roman Catholic.\"  As a matter of fact I was not at all displeased at what he said. I was certainly very fond of Sara, but the word \"marriage\" had a disagreeable sound to me. I answered that circumstances might change in time, and that in the meanwhile I should be quite content if he would allow me to be the friend of the family and to take upon myself all the responsibility of the journey. He promised everything, and assured me that he was delighted at his daughter having won my affection.  After this explanation I gave Sara as warm marks of my love as decency would allow in the presence of her father and mother, and I could see that all the girl thought of was love.  The fifth day I went up to her room, and finding her in bed all the fires of passion flamed up in my breast, for since my first visit to their house I had not been alone with her. I threw myself upon her, covering her with kisses, and she shewed herself affectionate but reserved. In vain I endeavoured to succeed; she opposed a gentle resistance to my efforts, and though she caressed me, she would not let me attain my end.  \"Why, divine Sara,\""]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/29742"],["title","The Long Voyage (#1)"],["body"," it unnecessary to wear space suits. We marched down the corridors of _hensorr_ trees, until we came to an open spot, a kind of glade. And that was the first time Mason tuned his organic surveyor and received absolutely nothing.  There was no animal life on Coulora!         *       *       *       *       *  Within an hour we had blasted off again. The forward-impact delivered by the Ganeth-Klae booster was terrific, and nausea and vertigo struck us all simultaneously. But again, with all ports and observation shields sealed shut, Norris held the secret of our destination.  On July twenty-second, the ship gave that sickening lurch and came once again to a standstill.  \"Same procedure as before,\" Norris said, stepping out of the airlock. \"Those of you who desire to have their wives accompany you may do so. Mason, you'll make a final correlation on the organic surveyors. If there is no trace of animal life return here before dark.\"  Once our group was out of sight of the ship, Mason threw down his packsack, sat down on a boulder and lighted a cigarette.  \"Bagley,\" he said to me, \"has the Old Man gone loco?\"  \"I think not,\" I said, frowning. \"He's one of the most evenly balanced persons I know.\"  \"Then he's hiding something,\" Mason said. \"Why else should he be so concerned with finding animal life?\"  \"You know the answer to that,\" I said. \"We're here to colonize, to start a new life. We can't very well do that on a desert.\"  \"That's poppycock,\" Mason replied, flinging away his cigarette. \"When the Albertson expedition first landed on Mars, there was no animal life on the red planet. Now look at it. Same thing was true when Breslauer first settled Pluto. The colonies there got along. I tell you Norris has got something up his sleeve, and I don't like it.\"  Later, after Mason had taken his negative surveyor reading, the flame of trouble reached the end of its fuse!  Norris had given orders to return to the _Marie Galante_, and the rest of us were sullenly making ready to start the back trail. Mason, however, deliberately seized his pick and began chopping a hole in the rock surface, preparatory apparently to erecting his plastic tent.  \"We'll make temporary camp here,\" he said calmly. \"Brandt, you can go back to the ship and bring back the rest of the women.\" He turned and smiled sardonically at Navigator Norris.  Norris quietly knocked the ashes from his pipe and placed it in his pocket. He strode forward, took the pick from Mason's hands and flung it away. Then he seized Mason by the coat, whipped him around and drove his fist hard against the younger man's jaw.  \"When you signed on for this voyage, you agreed to obey my orders,\" he said, not raising his voice. \"You'll do just that.\"  Mason picked himself up, and there was an ugly glint in his eyes. He could have smashed Norris to a pulp, and none knew it better than the Navigator. For a brief instant the younger man swayed there on the balls of his feet, fists clenched. Then he let his hands drop, walked over and began to put on his packsack.  But I had seen Mason's face, and I knew he had not given in as easily as it appeared. Meanwhile he began to circulate among the passengers, making no offers, yet subtly enlisting backers for a policy, the significance of which grew on me slowly. It was mutiny he was plotting! And with his personal charm and magnetism he had little trouble in winning over converts. I came upon him arguing before a group of the women one day, among them his own wife, Estelle. He was standing close to her.  \"We have clothing and equipment and food concentrate,\" Mason said. \"Enough to last two generations. We have brains and intelligence, and we certainly should be able to establish ourselves without the aid of other vertebrate forms of life.  \"Coulora, Jama, Tenethon, Mokrell, R-9, and Stragella. We could have settled on any one of those planets, and apparently we should have, for conditions have grown steadily worse at each landing. But always the answer is no. Why? Because Norris says we must go on until we find animal life.\"  He cleared his throat and gazed at the feminine faces before him. \"Go where? What makes Norris so sure he'll find life on any planet in this system? And incidentally where in the cosmos is this system?\"  One of the women, a tall blonde, stirred uneasily. \"What do you mean?\" she said.  \"I mean we don't know if our last landing was on Stragella or Coulora. I mean we don't know where we are or where we're going, and I don't think Norris does either. _We're lost!_\"  That was in August. By the last of September we had landed on two more planets, to which Norris gave the simple names of R-12 and R-14. Each had crude forms of vegetable life, represented principally by the blue _hensorr_ trees, but in neither case did the organic surveyor reveal the slightest traces of animal life.  There was, however, a considerable difference in physical appearance between R-12 and R-14, and for a time that fact excited Norris tremendously. Up to then, each successive planet, although similar in size, had exhibited signs of greater age than its predecessor. But on R-12 there were definite manifestations of younger geologic development.  Several pieces of shale lay exposed under a fold of igneous rock. Two of those pieces contained fossils of highly developed _ganoids_, similar to those found on Venus. They were perfectly preserved.  It meant that animal life had existed on R-12, even if it didn't now. It meant that R-12, though a much older planet than Earth, was still younger than Stragella or the rest.  For a while Norris was almost beside himself. He cut out rock samples and carried them back to the ship. He personally supervised the tuning of the surveyors. And when he finally gave orders to take off, he was almost friendly to Mason, whereas before his attitude toward him had been one of cold aloofness.  But when we reached R-14, our eighth landing, all that passed. For R-14 was old again, older than any of the others.  And then, on October sixteenth, Mason opened the door of the locked cabin. It happened quite by accident. One of the _arelium-thaxide_ conduits broke in the _Marie Galante's_ central passageway, and the resulting explosion grounded the central feed line of the instrument equipment. In a trice the passageway was a sheet of flame, rapidly filling with smoke from burning insulation.  Norris, of course, was in the bridge cuddy with locked doors between us and him, and now with the wiring burned through there was no way of signalling him he was wanted for an emergency. In his absence Mason took command.  That passageway ran the full length of the ship. Midway down it was the door leading to the women's lounge. The explosion had jammed that door shut, and smoke was pouring forth from under the sill. All at once one of the women rushed forward to announce hysterically that Mason's wife, Estelle, was in the lounge.  Adjoining the lounge was a small cabin which since the beginning of our voyage had remained locked. Norris had given strict orders that that cabin was not to be disturbed. We all had taken it as a matter of course that it contained various kinds of precision instruments.  Now, however, Mason realized that the only way into the lounge was by way of that locked cabin. If he used a heat blaster on the lounge door there was no telling what would happen to the woman inside.  He ripped the emergency blaster from its wall mounting, pressed it to the magnetic latch of the sealed cabin door and pressed the stud. An instant later he was leading his frightened wife, Estelle, out through the smoke.  The fire was quickly extinguished after that and the wiring spliced. Then when the others had drifted off, Mason called Brandt and me aside.  \"We've been wondering for a long time what happened to Ganeth-Klae, the Martian inventor who worked with Norris to invent _Indurate_,\" he said very quietly. \"Well, we don't need to wonder any more. He's in there.\"  Brandt and I stepped forward over the sill--and drew up short. Ganeth-Klae was there all right, but he would never trouble himself about making a voyage in a locked cabin. His rigid body was encased in a transparent block of amber-colored solidifex, the after-death preservative used by all Martians.  Both of us recognized his still features at once, and in addition his name-tattoo, required by Martian law, was clearly visible on his left forearm.         *       *       *       *       *  For a brief instant the discovery stunned us. Klae dead? Klae whose IQ had become a measuring guide for the entire system, whose Martian head held more ordinary horse sense, in addition to radical postulations on theoretical physics, than anyone on the planets. It wasn't possible.  And what was the significance of his body on Norris' ship? Why had Norris kept its presence a secret and why had he given out the story of Klae's disappearance?  Mason's face was cold as ice. \"Come with me, you two,\" he said. \"We're going to get the answer to this right now.\"  We went along the passage to the circular staircase. We climbed the steps, passed through the scuttle and came to the door of the bridge cuddy. Mason drew the bar and we passed in. Norris was bent over the chart table. He looked up sharply at the sound of our steps.  \"What is the meaning of this intrusion?\" he said.  It didn't take Mason long to explain. When he had finished, he stood there, jaw set, eyes smouldering.  Norris paled. Then quickly he got control of himself, and his old bland smile returned.  \"I expected you to blunder into Klae's body one of these days,\" he said. \"The explanation is quite simple. Klae had been ill for many months, and he knew his time was up. His one desire in life was to go on this expedition with me, and he made me promise to bury him at the site of our new colony. The pact was between him and me, and I've followed it to the letter, telling no one.\"  Mason's lips curled in a sneer. \"And just what makes you think"]]]
