Pick any known animal--_any_ one--and tell me how many genetic changes would have to take place before you'd come up with an animal anything like this one.\" Again he tapped the bathygraph. \"Take that eye, for instance. The lid goes down instead of up, but you notice that there's a smaller lid at the bottom that _does_ go up, a little ways. The closest thing to an eye like that is on the hugl, which has eyelids on top that lower a little. But the hugl has eighteen segments; sixteen pairs of legs and two pairs of feeding claws. Besides, it's only the size of your thumb-joint. What kind of gene mutation would it take to change that into an animal like the one in this picture?  \"And look at the size of the thing. If it weren't in that awkward vertical position, if it were stretched out on the ground, it'd be a long as a human. Look at the size of those legs!  \"Or, take another thing. In order to walk on those two legs, the changes in skeletal and visceral structure would have to be tremendous.\"  \"Couldn't we have missed the intermediate stages, then?\" Dodeth asked stubbornly. \"We've missed the intermediates before, I dare say.\"  \"Perhaps we have,\" Yerdeth admitted, \"but if you boys in the Ecological Corps have been on your toes for the past thousand years, we haven't missed many. And it would take at least that long for something like this to evolve from anything we know.\"  \"Even under direct polar bombardment?\"  \"Even under direct polar bombardment. The radiation up here is strong enough to sterilize a race within a very few generations. And what would they eat? Not many plants survive there, you know.  \"Oh, I don't say it's flatly im_possi_ble, you understand. If a female of some animal or other, carrying a freshly-fertilized zygote, and her species happened to have all the necessary potential characteristics, and a flood of ionizing radiation went through the zygote at exactly the right time, and it managed to hit just the right genes in just the right way ... well I'm sure you can see the odds against it are tremendous. I wouldn't even want to guess at the order of magnitude of the exponent. I'd have to put on a ten in order to give you the odds against it.\"  Dodeth didn't quite get that last statement, but he let it pass. \"I am going to pull somebody's legs off, one by one, come next work period,\" he said coldly. \"One ... by ... one.\"         *       *       *       *       *  He didn't, though. Rather than accuse Wygor, it would be better if Wygor were allowed to accuse himself. Dodeth merely wanted to wait for the opportunity to present itself. And then--ah, _then_ there would be a roasting!  The opportunity came in the latter part of the next work period. Wygor, who had purportedly been up on the surface for another field trip, scuttled excitedly into Dodeth's office, wildly waving some bathygraph sheets.  \"Dodeth, sir! Look! I came down as soon as I saw it! I've got the 'graphs right here! Horrible!\"  Before Dodeth could say anything, Wygor had spread the sheets out fan-wise on his business bench. Dodeth looked at them and experienced a moment of horror himself before he realized that these were--these _must_ be--doctored bathygraphs. Even so, he gave an involuntary gasp.  The first 'graphs had been taken from an aerial reconnaissance robot winging in low over the treetops. The others were taken from a higher altitude. They all showed the same carnage.  An area of several thousand square feet--_tens_ of thousands!--had been cleared of trees! They had been ruthlessly cut down and stacked. Bushes and vines had gone with them, and the grass had been crushed and plowed up by the dragging of the great fallen trees. And there were obvious signs that the work was still going on. In the close-ups, he could see the bipedal beasts wielding cutting instruments.  Dodeth forced himself to calmness and glared at the bathygraphs. Fry it, they _had_ to be fakes. A new species might appear only once in a hundred years, but according to Yerdeth, this couldn't possibly be a new species. What was Wygor's purpose in lying, though? Why should he falsify data? And it must be he; he had said that he had seen the beasts himself. Well, Dodeth would have to find out.  \"Tool users, eh?\" he said, amazed at the calmness of his voice. Such animals weren't unusual. The sniths used tools for digging and even for fighting each other. And the hurkles dammed up small streams with logs to increase their marshland. It wasn't immediately apparent what these beasts were up to, but it was far too destructive to allow it to go on.  But, fry it all, it _couldn't_ be going on!  There were only two alternatives. Either Wygor was a liar or Yerdeth didn't know what he was talking about. And there was only one way of finding out which was which.  \"Ardan! Get my equipment ready! We're going on a field trip! Wygor, you get the rest of the expedition ready; you and I are going up to see what all this is about.\" He jabbed at the communicator button. \"Fry it! Why should this have to happen in my sector? Hello! Give me an inter-city connection. I want to talk to Baythim Venns, co-ordinator of Ecological Control, in Faisalla.\"  He looked up at Wygor. \"Scatter off, fry it! I want to--Oh, hello, Baythim, sir. Dodeth. Have you had any reports on a new species--a bipedal one? What? No, sir; I'm not kidding. One of my men has brought in 'graphs of the thing. Frankly, I'm inclined to think it's a hoax of some kind, but I'd like to ask you to check to see if it's been reported in any of the other areas. We're located a little out of the way here, and I thought perhaps some of the stations farther north or south had seen it. Yes. That's right: two locomotive limbs, two handling limbs. Big as a human, and they hold their bodies perpendicular to the ground. Yes, sir, I know it sounds silly, and I'm going out to check the story now, but you ought to see these bathygraphs. If it's a hoax, there's an expert behind it. Very well, sir; I'll wait.\"  Dodeth scowled. Baythim had sounded as if he, Dodeth, had lost his senses.  _Maybe I have_, he thought. _Maybe I'll start running around mindlessly and get shot down by some patrol robot who thinks I'm a snith._  Maybe he should have investigated first and then called, when he was sure, one way or another. Maybe he should have told Baythim he was certain it was a hoax, instead of hedging his bets. Maybe a lot of things, but it was too--  \"Hello? Yes, sir. None, eh? Yes, sir. Yes, sir; I'll give you a call as soon as I've checked. Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.\"  Dodeth felt like an absolute fool. Individually and collectively, he consigned to the frying pan Baythim, Wygor, Yerdeth, the new beast--if it existed--and finally, himself.  By the time he had finished his all-encompassing curse, his two dozen pistoning legs had nearly brought him to the equipment room, where Ardan and Wygor were waiting.         *       *       *       *       *  Four hours and more of steady traveling did very little to sweeten Dodeth Pell's temper. The armored car was uncomfortable, and the silence within it was even more uncomfortable. He did not at all feel like making small talk with Wygor, and he had nothing as yet to say to Ardan or the patrol robots who were rolling along with the armored car.  One thing he had to admit: Wygor certainly didn't act like a man who was being carried to his own doom--which he certainly was if this was hoax. Wygor would lose all position and be reduced to living off his civil insurance. He would be pitied by all and respected by none.  But he didn't look as though that worried him at all.  Dodeth contented himself with looking at the scenery. The car was not yet into the forest country; this was all rolling grassland. Off to one side, a small herd of grazing grancos lifted their graceful heads to watch the passage of the expedition, then lowered them again to feed. A fanged zitibanth, disturbed in the act of stalking the grancos, stiffened all his legs and froze for a moment, looking balefully at the car and the robots, then went on about his business.  When they came to the forest, the going became somewhat harder. Centuries ago, those who had tried to build cities on the surface had also built paved strips to make travel by car easier and smoother, and Dodeth almost wished there were one leading to the target area.  Fry it, he _hated_ traveling! Especially in a lurching armored car. He wished he were bored enough or tired enough to go to sleep.  At last--at _long_ last--Wygor ordered the car to stop. \"We're within two miles of the clearing, sir,\" he told Dodeth.  \"All right,\" Dodeth said morosely. \"We'll go the rest of the way on foot. I don't want to startle them at this stage of the game, so keep it quiet and stay hidden. Tell the patrol robots to spread out, and tell them I want all the movie shots we can get. I want all the Keepers to see these things in action. Got that? Then let's get moving.\"  They crept forward through the forest, Dodeth and Ardan taking the right, while Wygor and his own robot, Arsam, stayed a few yards away to the left. They were all expert woodsmen--Dodeth and Wygor by training and experience, and the robots by indoctrination.  Even so, Dodeth never felt completely comfortable above ground, with nothing over his head but the clouded sky.  The team had purposely chosen to approach from a small rise, where they could look down on the clearing without being seen. And when they reached the incline that led up to the ridge, one of the armed patrol robots who had been in the lead took a look over the ridge and then scuttled back to Dodeth. \"They're there, sir.\"  \"What are they doing?\" Dodeth asked, scarcely daring to believe.  \"Feeding, I believe, sir. They aren't cutting down any trees now; they're just sitting on one of the logs, feeding themselves with their handling limbs.\"  \"How many are there?\"  \"Twenty, sir.\"  \"I'll take a"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30596"],["title","General Bramble (#1)"],["body"," but it's ten years younger.\"  The doctor's smile darkened, and he began rather insistently to praise the Old Masters.  \"Modern painting,\" he proclaimed, \"is too brutal.\"  \"Good heavens,\" said Aurelle, \"a great artist cannot paint with a powder-puff; you must be able to feel that the fellow with the pencil was not a eunuch.\"  \"Really,\" he went on, when the doctor had left in rather a bad temper, \"he's as ridiculous as the others. I think his portrait is very vigorous, and not in the least a skit, whatever he may say.\"  \"Just sit down there a minute, old man,\" said the painter. \"I shall be jolly glad to work from an intelligent model for once. They all want to look like tailors' fashion-plates. Now, I can't change my style; I don't paint in beauty paste, I render what I see--it's like Diderot's old story about the amateur who asked a floral painter to portray a lion. 'With pleasure,' said the artist, 'but you may expect a lion that will be as like a rose as I can make him.'\"  The conversation lasted a long time; it was friendly and technical. Aurelle praised Beltara's painting; Beltara expressed his joy at having found so penetrating and artistic a critic in the midst of so many Philistines.  \"I prefer your opinion to a painter's; it's certainly sincerer. Would you mind turning your profile a bit more towards me? Some months before the war I had two friends in my studio to whom I wished to show a little picture I intended for the _Salon_. 'Yes,' said the younger of them, 'it's all right, but there ought to be a light spot in that corner; your lights are not well balanced.' 'Shut up, you fool,' the other whispered to him, 'that'll make it _really_ good!' Come on, old man, come and look; I think that sketch can be left as it is.\"  Aurelle walked up to the painter, and, cocking his head on one side, looked at the drawing.  \"It's charming,\" he said at last with some reluctance. \"It's charming. There are some delightful touches--all that still life on the table, it might be a Chardin--and I like the background very much indeed.\"  \"Well, old man, I'm glad you like it. Take it back with you when you go on leave and give it to your wife.\"  \"Er--\" sighed Aurelle, \"thank you, _mon capitaine_; it's really very kind of you. Only--you'll think me no end of a fool--you see, if it is to be for my wife, I'd like you to touch up the profile just a little. Of course you understand.\"  And Beltara, who was a decent fellow, adorned his friend's face with the Grecian nose and the small mouth which the gods had denied him.     CHAPTER II  DIPLOMACY    \"We are not foreigners; we are English; it is _you_ that are    foreigners.\"--An English Lady Abroad.   When Dr. O'Grady and Aurelle had succeeded, with some difficulty, in obtaining a room from old Madame de Vauclère, Colonel Parker went over to see them and was charmed with the château and the park.  France and England, he said, were the only two countries in which fine gardens were to be found, and he told the story of the American who asked the secret of those well-mown lawns and was answered, \"Nothing is simpler: water them for twelve hundred years.\"  Then he inquired timidly whether he also might not be quartered at the château.  \"It wouldn't do very well, sir; Madame is mortally afraid of new-comers, and she has a right, being a widow, to refuse to billet you.\"  \"Aurelle, my boy, do be a good fellow, and go and arrange matters.\"  After much complaining, Madame de Vauclère consented to put the colonel up: all her sons were officers, and she could not withstand sentimental arguments for very long.  The next day Parker's orderly joined the doctor's in the château kitchen, and together they annexed the fireplace. To make room for their own utensils, they took down a lot of comical little French articles, removed what they saw no use for, put the kettle on, and whistled hymns as they filled the cupboards with tins of boot polish in scientifically graded rows.  After adoring them on the first day, putting up with them on the second, and cursing them on the third, the old cook came up to Aurelle with many lamentations, and dwelt at some length on the sad state of her saucepans; but she found the interpreter dealing with far more serious problems.  Colonel Parker, suddenly realizing that it was inconvenient for the general to be quartered away from his Staff, had decided to transfer the whole H.Q. to the château of Vauclère.  \"Explain to the old lady that I want a very good room for the general, and the billiard-room for our clerks.\"  \"Why, it's impossible, sir; she has no good room left.\"  \"What about her own?\" said Colonel Parker.  Madame de Vauclère, heart-broken, but vanquished by the magic word \"General,\" which Aurelle kept on repeating sixty times a minute, tearfully abandoned her canopied bed and her red damask chairs, and took refuge on the second floor.  Meanwhile the drawing-room with its ancient tapestries was filled with an army of phlegmatic clerks occupied in heaping up innumerable cases containing the history in triplicate of the Division, its men, horses, arms and achievements.  \"Maps\" set up his drawing-board on a couple of arm-chairs; \"Intelligence\" concealed their secrets in an Aubusson boudoir; and the telephone men sauntered about in the dignified, slow, bantering fashion of the British workman. They set up their wires in the park, and cut branches off the oaks and lime trees; they bored holes in the old walls, and, as they wished to sleep near their work they put up tents on the lawns.  The Staff asked for their horses; and the animals were picketed in the garden walks, as the stables were too small. In the garden the Engineers made a dug-out in case of a possible bombardment. The orderlies' football developed a distinct liking for the window-panes of the summer-house. The park assumed the aspect first of a building site and then of a training camp, and new-comers said, \"These French gardens _are_ badly kept!\"  This methodical work of destruction had been going on for about a week when \"Intelligence\" got going.  \"Intelligence\" was represented at the Division by Captain Forbes.  Forbes, who had never yet arrested a real spy, saw potential spies everywhere, and as he was fond of the company of the great, he always made his suspicions a pretext for going to see General Bramble or Colonel Parker. One day he remained closeted for an hour with the colonel, who summoned Aurelle as soon as he had left.  \"Do you know,\" he said to him, \"there are most dangerous things going on here. Two old women are constantly being seen in this château. What the deuce are they up to?\"  \"What do you mean?\" gasped Aurelle. \"This is their house, sir; it's Madame de Vauclère and her maid.\"  \"Well, you go and tell them from me to clear out as soon as possible. The presence of civilians among a Staff cannot be tolerated; the Intelligence people have complained about it, and they are perfectly right.\"  \"But where are they to go to, sir?\"  \"That's no concern of mine.\"  Aurelle turned round furiously and left the room. Coming across Dr. O'Grady in the park, he asked his advice about the matter.  \"Why, doctor, she had a perfect right to refuse to billet us, and from a military point of view we should certainly be better off at Nieppe. She was asked to do us a favour, she grants it, and her kindness is taken as a reason for her expulsion! I can't 'evacuate her to the rear,' as Forbes would say; she'd die of it!\"  \"I should have thought,\" said the doctor, \"that after three years you knew the British temperament better than this. Just go and tell the colonel, politely and firmly, that you refuse to carry out his orders. Then depict Madame de Vauclère's situation in your grandest and most tragic manner. Tell him her family has been living in the château for the last two thousand years, that one of her ancestors came over to England with William the Conqueror, and that her grandfather was a friend of Queen Victoria's. Then the colonel will apologize and place a whole wing at the disposal of your _protégée_.\"  Dr. O'Grady's prescription was carried out in detail by Aurelle with most satisfactory results.  \"You are right,\" said the colonel, \"Forbes is a damned idiot. The old lady can stay on, and if anybody annoys her, let her come to me.\"  \"It's all these servants who are such a nuisance to her, sir,\" said Aurelle. \"It's very painful for her to see her own house turned upside-down.\"  \"Upside-down?\" gasped the colonel. \"Why, the house is far better kept than it was in her time. I have had the water in the cisterns analysed; I have had sweet-peas planted and the tennis lawn rolled. What can she complain of?\"  In the well-appointed kitchen garden, where stout-limbed pear trees bordered square beds of sprouting lettuce, Aurelle joined O'Grady.  \"Doctor, you're a great man, and my old lady is saved. But it appears she ought to thank her lucky stars for having placed her under the British Protectorate, which, in exchange for her freedom, provides her with a faultless tennis lawn and microbeless water.\"  \"There is nothing,\" said the doctor gravely, \"that the British Government is not ready to do for the good of the natives.\"     CHAPTER III  THE TOWER OF BABEL    \"Des barques romaines, disais-je.--Non, disais-tu,    portugaises.\"--Jean Giraudoux.   \"Wot you require, sir,\" interrupted Private Brommit, \"is a glass o' boilin' 'ot milk an' whisky, with lots o' cinnamon.\"  Aurelle, who was suffering from an attack of influenza, was at Estrées, under the care of Dr. O'Grady, who tirelessly prescribed ammoniated quinine.  \"I say, doctor,\" said the young Frenchman, \"this is a drug that's utterly unknown in France. It seems strange that medicines should have a nationality.\"  \"Why shouldn't they?\" said the doctor. \"Many diseases are national. If a Frenchman has a bathe after a meal, he is stricken with congestion of the stomach and is drowned. An Englishman never has congestion of the stomach.\"  \"No,\" said Aurelle; \"he"]]]
