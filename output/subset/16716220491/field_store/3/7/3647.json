Don't imagine, because you are my protector and the only one I have to depend on while Jack is at sea, that you have all the courage there is between us. I know you would shield me entirely if you could, but it is impossible; and you must let me bear my part. I shall have to whether you consent or not. But you haven't yet told me where you have been, how you captured that vessel, what the captain said about it, or--or anything,\" she added, with a feeble attempt to bring the boy's usual smile back to his face. \"Remember, I am deeply interested in all that you do.\"  \"Well, you wouldn't be if you had seen the cowardly work I helped Beardsley carry out,\" replied Marcy. \"In the first place, Crooked Inlet is buoyed in such a way that the stranger who tries to go through it will run his vessel so hard and fast aground that she will be likely to stay there until the waves make an end of her, or the shifting sands of the bar bury her out of sight.\"  \"That's murderous,\" exclaimed Mrs. Gray, with a shudder. \"Is Captain Beardsley about to turn wrecker?\"  \"He means to wreck any war vessel that may give chase to his schooner,\" answered Marcy. \"If we are pursued, I can take the _Osprey_ through all right; but if the man-of-war attempts to follow us, and allows herself to be guided by the buoys, she'll stick. Oh, it's lovely business--a brave and honorable business,\" exclaimed the boy, running his hands through his hair and tumbling it up as he used to do at school when he found anything in his books that was too hard for him. \"I have the profoundest contempt for the villain who brought me into it, and despise myself for yielding to him.\"  \"But, Marcy, what else could you have done? Gilford assured me it was the only course open to you, and that by shipping as pilot on board that privateer you have somewhat allayed suspicion.\"  \"Mother,\" said Marcy, placing his arm around her neck and whispering the words in her ear, \"Captain Beardsley doesn't need a pilot any more than he needs some one to command his piratical craft. I suspected as much all the while, and the minute we got up to Crooked Inlet I knew it. He can tell you more about the coast in five minutes than I could in an hour.\"  \"Of course, a trader----\" began Mrs. Gray.  \"Mother,\" repeated Marcy, \"Lon Beardsley is not and never has been a trader. He's a smuggler between this country and Cuba. He says himself that he never made a voyage farther away from home than the West Indies. He knows every inch of the coast like a book.\"  \"Then what does he want of you?\" inquired Mrs. Gray, with a look of surprise. \"Why can he not permit you to stay at home in peace, as he knows I want you to do? Do you still think he wants to test your loyalty to the South?\"  \"That's just what he is up to,\" replied Marcy. \"He came here in the hope that I would refuse his offer, so that he would have an excuse for getting me into trouble.\"  Yes, that was one object Captain Beardsley had in view when he proposed to make Marcy Gray pilot of the privateer, but there was another behind it, and one that was much nearer to the smuggler's heart. As Marcy had told his friend Wat Gifford, on the day the two held that confidential conversation in front of the Nashville post-office, Beardsley wanted to marry Mrs. Gray's plantation; and when he found that he must give up all hope in that direction, like the poor apology for a man that he was, he hit upon a plan for taking vengeance upon Marcy's mother. If she proved, when the test was applied, to be friendly to the South and its cause, he would not dare lift a finger against her or her property, for he knew that if he did his neighbors would quickly interest themselves in the matter; but if she would only refuse to permit Marcy to ship on board the privateer, then he would have a clear field for his operations. He could accuse Marcy's mother of being a Yankee sympathizer, and that would turn the whole settlement against her at once, because she was already suspected of Union sentiments, and some of her nearest neighbors were so certain that she was loyal to the old flag and opposed to secession, that they thought it their duty to cease visiting her. It would be no trouble at all, Beardsley thought, to arouse public feeling against her; but unfortunately for the success of his plans, Mrs. Gray did not refuse her consent; the boy took the position offered him on the _Osprey_ made one voyage at sea, and did his duty as faithfully as any other member of the crew.  \"I know Beardsley wanted to find out where I stood,\" repeated Marcy. \"He expected and hoped that I would refuse to accept his proposition so that he would have an excuse for persecuting us; but being disappointed there, he intends to work in another direction. He means to make trouble on account of the money you have in the cellar.\"  \"But what business--what right has he with it?\" said Mrs. Gray indignantly. \"It's ours.\"  \"I know it, and we're going to keep it; but if Beardsley can make sure that you went to Richmond, Wilmington, and Newbern for _money_--and I think you will find that he looks to Hanson, the overseer, to furnish him with the proof, and bring a gang of longshoremen up here from Plymouth some dark night----\"  \"Oh, Marcy!\" cried Mrs. Gray, starting from her chair and clasping her hands in alarm, \"don't speak of it!\"  \"I wish from the bottom of my heart that I need not have told you of it,\" said the boy, getting upon his feet and pacing the floor with restless, angry strides. \"But Wat Gifford believes that something of the sort is going to happen, and so do I. Wat didn't say so, but I am sure that is what he would have told me if he had found me at home when he came here. You knew there was danger in every one of those gold pieces you brought home with you; else why did you take so much pains to put them where you thought no one would be likely to find them?\"  \"It is true I did know it, and was afraid that if the news got abroad in the settlement, some of our poor neighbors might be tempted to commit crime,\" answered Mrs. Gray. \"We never had so large an amount of money in the house before, and its presence troubles me greatly; but I never dreamed that we had anything to fear from an organized band of freebooters.\"  \"And the fear of what Beardsley will do, if he finds out that the money is really in the house, is what troubles me,\" said the young pilot dolefully. \"That man is capable of any desperate deed when he thinks he has the power on his side. I know you never thought of such a thing at the time, but your trips about the country, which Wat Gifford says could not have been made without an object of some sort, have excited a good deal of talk among the neighbors. Captain Beardsley posted Hanson, and Hanson, so Wat told me, is more to be feared than any one else, for he is right here on the place. These secret enemies will drive us both crazy.\"  \"We'll not give them the satisfaction of knowing that they can trouble us in the least,\" replied his mother, with dignity. \"Now we will dismiss them entirely from our minds, while you tell me all the interesting things that happened during your cruise.\"  \"There isn't a thing to tell,\" was Marcy's answer. \"We sighted the _Hollins_ inside Diamond Shoals, threw a couple of shrapnel at her and she came to; that's all there was of it. Her skipper was a sailorman all over, and plucky, too; and if he had had anything to fight with, he would have made things lively for us. I never before felt so sorry for anybody as I did for him; but of course I didn't have a chance to tell him so. I may some day meet him under different circumstances.\"  When the boy said this he did not really believe that such a thing ever could occur, but nevertheless it did. Strange things happen in this world sometimes, and in process of time it came about that the young pilot again stood face to face with the master of the _Mary Hollins_ no longer a prisoner pleading with Captain Beardsley that his men might not be ironed like felons, but standing free on the quarter-deck of an armed vessel, with a hundred blue-jackets ready to do his bidding, and the Stars and Stripes waving proudly and triumphantly above him. And Beardsley--he was there, too; and perhaps we shall see what sort of heart he kept up when he found himself thrust into the \"brig\" so quickly that he did not have time to tell what his name was.  \"How long does your leave of absence extend?\" inquired Mrs. Gray, after a little pause.  \"Until I am ordered to report,\" replied Marcy, with a laugh. \"Perhaps the captain didn't know I wrote it out that way, but that isn't my fault. It was his business to read the paper before signing it. If he wants me he will have to send for me. You ought to have heard that Newbern mob whoop and yell when the crew of the _Hollins_ were marched off to jail. They called them 'Abolitionists' and 'nigger-lovers'; but the prisoners kept their eyes straight to the front, and marched on as though they didn't hear a word of it. It was a shame to treat brave men that way.\"  Just as the young pilot ceased speaking there was a gentle knock at the door; and so sudden and unexpected was it, that it brought both him and his mother to their feet in a twinkling. How long had the person who gave that knock been within reach of the door, was the first thought that arose in the mind of each. Had some one crept along the hall and listened at the key-hole in the hope of hearing some of their conversation?  \"If that is the case,\" Marcy whispered to his mother, \"she has had "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/29387"],["title","Marcy the Blockade Runner (#2)"],["body","trouble for her pains. We haven't said a dozen words that could have been heard the length of this room. 'Come in!'\"  The door opened to admit one of the numerous female house servants, who announced that there was a gentleman on the gallery who had called to see Mrs. Gray on very important private and particular business.  \"She looks innocent enough,\" thought Marcy, who could not bring himself to believe, as his mother evidently did, that some of the domestics were watching their movements and reporting the result of their observations to the overseer. \"I don't think she heard a word, and she certainly could not have seen anything.\" And then, finding that his mother was looking at him as if she meant him to understand that she knew what the visitor's business was, and desired him to take it off her hands, he said, aloud: \"Who is the gentleman, and do you know what he's got to say that is so very important and particular?\"  \"I don't know, sah, what he want to speak about,\" answered the girl, \"but de man is Mr. Kelsey.\"  Marcy could hardly keep back an exclamation of disgust, and in an instant he was on his guard. The man's name and the message he had sent in warned him to be on the lookout for treachery. Kelsey was one of Beardsley's \"renters\"--that is to say, he hired from the captain a few acres of ground, on which he managed to raise enough corn and potatoes to keep his family from absolute want, and a little log cabin in which he found shelter when he was not absent on his hunting and thieving expeditions. Marcy had not seen him since his return from Barrington, but he had heard of him as a red-hot Confederate who went about declaring that hanging was too good for Yankees and their sympathizers. When Marcy heard of this, he told himself that the man was another Bud Goble, who, when the pinch came, would take to the woods and stay there as long as danger threatened.  \"I'll be with him directly,\" he said, addressing himself to the girl, who went out, closing the door behind her.  \"What in the name of wonder can that worthless man want with me?\" whispered Mrs. Gray, when she thought she had given the domestic time to get out of hearing. \"He has never been in this house before except to beg.\"  \"And he wouldn't be here now if he hadn't been sent,\" replied the boy.  \"Oh, Marcy!\" said his mother.  \"That is just what I mean. It isn't old clothes or grub that he is after this time.\"  \"But Beardsley couldn't have put him up to anything. He is in Newbern.\"  \"No odds. He left plenty of friends behind to do his dirty work, and this fellow, Kelsey, is one of them. It will take a sharper man than he is to pull the wool over my eyes.\"  \"Don't be over-confident, my son. He is not too insignificant--no one is too insignificant these times to do us some terrible injury. Be careful how you treat him and what you say to him. It might be dangerous to make him angry, for he has powerful friends behind him. Don't be gone long, for I shall be uneasy until you return.\"  \"I'll be right back,\" promised Marcy; and, giving his mother a reassuring kiss, he left the room and went out on the porch to see what Beardsley's friend and spy wanted.  The latter looked just as he did the last time Marcy saw him--too lazy to take a long breath. He was tall and lank, his hair fell down upon his shoulders, his whiskers were as tangled and matted as a little brush heap--in short, he was as fine a specimen of a poor white as one could find anywhere in the seceded States. He looked stupid as well as shiftless, but the young pilot knew he wasn't. He was as sly as a fox and as cunning as well, and Marcy confessed to himself that he stood more in fear of him than he did of Captain Beardsley. When the man heard Marcy's step upon the porch, he tried to assume the servile air which was characteristic of poor Southern whites before the war; but he did not succeed very well. His manner seemed to say that he knew he was dealing with one he could crush whenever he felt like it, and of whom he need not stand in fear; and Marcy was quick to notice it.  \"Sarvent, sah,\" said Kelsey, rising to his feet and taking off his tattered hat, which, however, he almost instantly replaced. \"I heared that you had got back again from sea, an' that you had whopped the Yankees first time tryin', same as our fellers done down to Charleston.\"  \"Yes, sir,\" replied Marcy, seating himself, and depositing his feet on the railing, as if to indicate that he was quite at the service of his friend Kelsey as long as the latter wanted to talk to him. \"We whipped them, and we could do the same thing again.\" [\"And that's nothing but the truth,\" he added, to himself. \"When an armed vessel meets one that's not armed, the helpless one is bound to go under every time.\"]  It is hard to tell just what Kelsey expected the boy to say in response to his greeting, but in spite of his usual self-control his face showed that he had not looked for any such answer as this. Marcy spoke and acted as if he were delighted with the success that had attended the _Osprey's_ first cruise at sea, and proud of being able to say that he was one of her crew.  \"You sent in word that you desired to see my mother on very particular business,\" continued Marcy. \"She doesn't feel like seeing anybody to-day--upset by the war news, you know--and I am here to speak for her. It's nothing bad, I hope?\"  Kelsey straightened up on his seat and assumed a business air, as if these words had suggested an idea to him.  \"Yes, it's kinder bad,\" said he. \"We uns know that you are true blue, fur if you wasn't you wouldn't be on that privateer; an' if your maw wasn't true blue, she wouldn't a let you go.\"  [\"That sounds exactly like Beardsley,\" said Marcy, to himself.] \"Well, what of it? Didn't I do my duty faithfully?\"  \"I ain't sayin' nothing agin that,\" replied the man hastily. \"But--you're fur Jeff Davis, ain't you?\"  Instead of answering in words, Marcy pulled down the corner of his right eye and looked at Kelsey as if to ask him if he saw anything green in it.  \"What do ye mean by them movements?\" demanded the visitor.  \"I mean that I am not going to talk politics with you,\" was the reply. \"This settlement is full of traitors, and I'm going to hold my tongue unless I know who I am talking to. If I do that, I shan't get into trouble by speaking too freely in the hearing of a Yankee spy.\"  \"But look a-here, Mister Marcy,\" protested Kelsey.  \"If you came to pry into our private affairs, you might as well jump on your mule and go home, for you'll not get a word from me. I ought to put the dogs on you, for if all I hear is true you're the worst kind of a traitor.\" [\"And so you are,\" thought Marcy, closely watching the effect of his words, although he did not seem to be doing so; \"you're a traitor to the old flag.\"]  The visitor was astonished beyond measure, and it was fully a minute before he could collect his wits sufficiently to frame a reply.                                   CHAPTER II.                             HIDING THE FLAGS.  \"I think I have taken the right course,\" soliloquized the young pilot, who mentally congratulated himself on the ease with which he had \"got to windward\" of this sneaking spy. \"If I fight him with his own weapons I shall probably get more out of him than I could in any other way.\"  \"You heared that I was a traitor?\" exclaimed Kelsey, as soon as he could speak. \"Mister Marcy, the man who told you that told you a plumb lie, kase I ain't. I whooped her up fur ole Car'liny when she went out, I done the same when our gov'ner grabbed the forts along the coast, an' I yelled fit to split when our folks licked 'em at Charleston. Any man in the settlement or in Nashville will tell ye that them words of mine is nothing but the gospel truth.\"  Marcy knew well enough that his visitor's words were true, but he shook his head in a doubting way, as he replied:  \"That may all be; but _I_ didn't hear you whoop and yell, and you must not expect me to take your word for it. You must bring some proof before I will talk to you.\"  \"Why, how in sense could ye hear me whoop an' yell, seein' that you was away to school in the first place, an' off on the ocean with Beardsley in the next?\" exclaimed Kelsey. \"Ask Dillon, an' Colonel Shelby, an' the postmaster, an' see if they don't say it's the truth.\"  \"You have mentioned the names of some of our most respected citizens,\" said Marcy slowly, as if he were still reluctant to be convinced of the man's sincerity. \"And if they, or any of them, sent you up here to talk to my mother--why, then, I shall have to listen to you; but mind you, if you are trying to play a game on me----\"  \"Mister Marcy,\" said Kelsey solemnly, \"I ain't tryin' to come no game. Them men done it sure's you're born.\"  \"Did what?\"  \"Sent me up here this mawnin'.\"  \"That's one point gained, but won't mother be frightened when she hears of it?\" thought Marcy, leaning his elbows on his knees and covering his face with his hands so that his visitor could not see it. \"Some of the best men in the country have so far forgotten their manhood, and the friendship they once had for our family, that they can send this sneaking fellow here to worm something out of us.\"  \"I don't believe a word of it,\" he cried, jumping to his feet and confronting his visitor.  \"Ye--ye don't believe it?\" faltered Kelsey, springing up in his turn. \"Well, I--I--look a-here, Mister Marcy, mebbe this is something else you don't believe. Them men whose names I jest give you, say that you an' your maw an' all the rest of the Gray family is Union. What do ye say to _that?_\"  \"I say that they had better attend to their own business and let me attend to mine,\" answered Marcy. \"Are Colonel Shelby and the rest of them for the Union?\"  \"Not much; an' nuther be I.\"  \"Are you in favor of secession?\"  \"I reckon.\" replied Kelsey earnestly; and Marcy knew all the while that he could not have told what the word secession meant.  \"Then why don't you prove it--you"]]]
