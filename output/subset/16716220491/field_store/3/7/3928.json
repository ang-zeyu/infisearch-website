But the Earthling would have preferred the most primitive Earth native to these serpents. In the distance, the slim nose of the rocket ship pointed the way to freedom, and Sheckly looked longingly at it.  At one end of the village was a small mountain of what appeared to be plastic clothing, milkily translucent--which was strange, since these creatures wore no clothing. The Earthling wondered at this but did not ask about it. Other thoughts more important troubled him.  \"In here,\" the interpreter told him, stopping before the largest hut.  Hesitating briefly, Sheckly entered and the creature followed him in. Seated on the floor were the leader and his mate and several smaller reptiles that evidently were the children. Between them lay several bowls of food. Sheckly grimaced and turned hastily away as he saw small crawling insects in one bowl.  \"Sit down,\" the interpreter directed.  Harding was not in evidence. \"Where is my companion?\" he asked.  The interpreter conferred briefly with the leader, then told Sheckly, \"He could not come. Sit down--eat.\"  Sheckly sat down, but he didn't feel like eating. He wondered _why_ Harding could not come. At a sudden thought, he said, \"I have rations on my ship--\"  \"Eat,\" the interpreter said, gripping his sword.  Sheckly nodded weakly and reached out for the bowl of fruit, taking one that resembled that which Harding had eaten the previous night. It wasn't bad. The leader stuffed a fistful of squirming insects in his mouth and offered the bowl to Sheckly, who shook his head as politely as he could and indicated the fruit in his hand.  Fortunately, the serpentman did not insist on his taking anything other than fruit, so the meal passed without physical discomfort.  When they were through, the leader hissed several syllables to the interpreter, who said, \"The leader wishes to see your games. You will set them up now.\"  Sheckly ran his tongue over dry lips. \"They're in the ship,\" he said, and eagerness crept into his voice. \"I'll have to get them.\" Once inside the ship, he'd never come back. He'd slam the airlock door and bolt it and then blast off as fast as he could get the motors going, Harding or no Harding. He got up.  \"We will help you,\" the interpreter said.  \"No. I can do it myself.\"  \"We will help you,\" the interpreter insisted firmly. His eyes bored into the Earthling, as though daring him to refuse again.  Sheckly's mouth felt dry once more. \"Where's Harding?\" he demanded. \"Where's the other Earth man? What have you done with him?\"  The interpreter looked at the leader, who nodded. The interpreter said gravely, \"It is too bad. It is the season for the shedding of skins. At the shedding feast last night--\"  \"The shedding of skins!\" Sheckly said, remembering the pile he'd seen at one corner of the village; \"those translucent things were your cast-off skins.\" He recalled that some reptiles back on Earth had regular seasons of shedding. That intelligent creatures should do it made him feel slightly sick.  \"Your friend joined us last night,\" the serpentman went on. \"But he could not shed properly, so--\"  Sheckly felt his blood turn to ice.  \"--so we helped him.\"  \"You _what_?\"  \"We helped him out of his skin,\" the serpentman went on calmly. \"We try to help those who are friends with us. Your friend had trouble getting his skin off, but with our help--\"  \"No!\" the Earthling cried, trying to reject the thought.  The full realization of what had happened struck him at once. Despite himself, he could picture Harding struggling, trying to convince these creatures that Earthlings don't shed their skins. His struggles must have convinced them only that he was having trouble shedding, so they \"helped him.\" They had come to skin the natives, but the reverse was happening--only literally.  \"Where--where is he?\" he asked finally, though he knew it didn't really matter.  \"We will take you to him,\" the interpreter said.  \"No,\" Sheckly cried. \"No, I--I'd rather not.\"  The serpentman nodded. \"As you wish. He does not look pretty. I hope that tonight you do not have as much trouble.\"  Sheckly's eyes went wide. \"What do you mean?\"  \"In your shedding,\" the serpentman explained. \"We will try to help you all we can, of course.\"  \"Of course,\" the Earthling agreed weakly, licking cottony lips. He wondered how he could just stand there so apparently calm, instead of letting out a shriek and running as fast as he could for the rocket ship. He decided it was some sort of paralysis, the shock of finding himself in the middle of something so alien his mind told him it couldn't possibly be.         *       *       *       *       *  Knees wobbling, Sheckly went to the door and out into the morning. That he had gotten that far surprised him pleasantly. The tall rocket ship was in a clearing several yards beyond the edge of the village. He headed for it. He thought of running, but his legs felt like rubber, his blood like ice. He walked past the pile of drying skins on the ground without looking at them, and he was followed by the interpreter and several others whom the serpentman had motioned to join them. Except for their swords, they had no weapons, he noticed. Poor Harding, he thought, and wondered if the Earthling's skin were somewhere in the pile; he felt sick, thinking about it.  \"You'd better stay outside the ship,\" he suggested testily. \"I'll lower the equipment to you.\"  \"I will go aboard with you,\" the serpentman said.  \"But--\"  \"I will go aboard with you.\"  Sheckly shrugged, but he hardly felt complacent. He felt as though a giant icy hand held onto his spine with a firm paralyzing grip. He trembled visibly. Got to think, he told himself desperately, got to plan this out. But fear jumbled his thoughts, and he could only think of Harding back in the village minus his skin, and of what was going to happen that night if all went as these creatures planned.  The second thought was the more terrifying, and when they were within a hundred feet of the rocket ship, Sheckly broke into a frantic run.  \"Stop,\" the interpreter cried.  Sheckly had no intentions of stopping. His glands told him to run, and he ran. He ran as fast as he could and didn't look back. He imagined the serpentman was on his heels, knife poised, and he ran even faster. He reached the rocket ship and went up the ladder, scrambling, missing his foothold, pulling himself up with clutching hands. He threw himself through the airlock and slammed the massive door behind him.  He ran through the metal corridors to the control room. They must be on the ladder, he thought, prying at the airlock with their metal swords. He pressed switches, slammed down on the throttle, and the sweet music of the rockets came and pressed him into his seat.  He looked down at the planet dwindling into space below him and he laughed hysterically, thinking of the narrow escape he'd had. No more planets for him, no more trying to skin anyone.         *       *       *       *       *  \"There it goes,\" the Space Patrolman said, watching the rocket rise.  Harding trembled with helpless rage. \"That blasted fool Sheckly'll lead you right to the money, too,\" he complained.  \"That's the way we planned it,\" the Patrolman smiled. \"I must compliment our native friends on their fine acting. Your pal took off like a scared rabbit.\"  \"Yeah,\" Harding grimaced, clenching his fists as though wishing he had someone's neck in them.  \"Don't blame your friend too much,\" the Patrolman advised. \"Whether you realize it or not, the fact that you were consciously avoiding our schedules caused you to follow a pattern in your visits to these outerspace planets; we just figured a bit ahead of you and posted hidden patrols on all the inhabited planets in this sector, knowing that sooner or later you'd land on one of them. We spotted your ship last night and hurried over by 'copter so we wouldn't be seen.\"  \"Forget the synopsis,\" Harding growled. \"You walked in when these blasted lizards were making believe they were going to skin me alive. They didn't have to act so realistic about it.\"  \"You're wrong about one thing,\" the Patrolman said. \"The act didn't start until after we arrived to direct it.\"  Harding looked at him, puzzled. \"What do you mean by that?\"  \"We arrived, as the books say, just in time,\" the Patrolman told him. \"They _weren't_ making believe.\" He offered a bowl of fruit to his prisoner. \"We'll be here for another hour yet. Eat something.\"  Weakly, Harding shook his head no. He sat down, suddenly pale at what the officer had said.  He didn't feel very hungry.                                                             ...

The sex cannot yet be determined. The length of the embryo is from one inch and a half to two inches, and it weighs from three to five drachms. The eyes are discernible, but still uncovered by the rudimentary lids. The nose forms an obtuse eminence, the nostrils are rounded and separated, the mouth is gaping and the epidermis can be distinguished from the true skin.  At _ten weeks_ the embryo is from one and a half to two and a half inches long, and its weight is from one ounce to an ounce and a half, the eyelids are more developed and descend in front of the eyes; the mouth begins to be closed by the development of the lips. The walls of the chest are more completely formed, so that it is no longer possible to see the movements of the heart. The fingers become distinct and the toes appear as small projections webbed together like a frog's foot. At about this period the sexual organs show their development as follows: On each side of the urinary locality an oblong fold becomes distinguishable; in course of progress if these folds remain separate, a little tubercle forms in the anterior commissure which becomes the clitoris; the nymphæ develop, the urethra forms between them, and the female sex is determined. If, on the other hand, these folds unite into a rounded projection the scrotum is formed, the little tubercle above becomes the penis and hence the male sex. The testicles forming within the body, descend later into the scrotum, and organs similar to them, their counterparts, form in the female and are called ovaries. These ovaries are found attached to an organ called the womb, and this again is united with the vagina, which leads downwards and outwards between the labia majora.[B]    [B] For fuller particulars see Guernsey's Obstetrics.  At the end of the _third month_ the weight of the embryo is from three to four ounces and its length from four to five inches, the eyeballs are seen through the lids, the pupils of the eyes are discernible, the forehead, nose and lips can be clearly distinguished. The finger nails resemble thin membranous plates, the skin shows more firmness, but is still rosy-hued, thin and transparent. The sex can now be fully determined.  At the end of the _fourth month_ the product of conception is no longer called an embryo, but a foetus. The body is from six to eight inches in length and weighs six or seven ounces. A few little white hairs are seen scattered over the scalp. The development of the face is still imperfect. The eyes are now closed by their lids, the nostrils are well-formed, the mouth is shut in by the lips and the sex is still more sharply defined. The tongue may be observed far back in the mouth, and the lower part of the face is rounded off by what a little later will be a well-formed chin. The movements of the foetus are by this time plainly felt by the mother, and if born at this time it may live several months.  At the end of the _fifth month_ the body of the foetus is from seven to nine inches long and weighs from eight to eleven ounces. The skin has a fairer appearance and more consistence; the eyes can no longer be distinguished through the lids, owing to the increased thickness of the latter. The head, heart and kidneys are large and well developed. At the end of the _sixth month_ the foetus is from eleven to twelve and a half inches in length, and weighs about sixteen ounces, more or less. The hair upon the scalp is thicker and longer, the eyes remain closed, and very delicate hairs may be seen upon the margins of the eye-lids and upon the eye-brows. The nails are solid, the scrotum small and empty, the surface of the skin appears wrinkled but the dermis may be distinguished from the epidermis. The liver is large and red, and the gall-bladder contains fluid.  At the end of the _seventh month_ the length of the foetus is from twelve and a half to fourteen inches, its weight is about fifty-five ounces, and it is both well defined and well proportioned in all its parts. The bones of the cranium, hitherto quite flat, now appear a little arched, and as the process of ossification goes on, the arching increases till the vault is quite complete. The brain presents greater firmness, and the eye-lids are opened. The skin is much firmer and red. The gall-bladder contains bile.  At the end of the _eighth month_ the foetus seems to thicken up rather than to increase in length, since it is only from sixteen to eighteen inches long while its weight increases from four to five pounds. The skin is red, and characterized at this period by a fine downy covering, over which is spread a quantity of thick viscous matter, called the sebaceous coat, which has been forming since the latter part of the fifth month. The lower jaw has now become as long as the upper one, and in the male the left testicle may be found in the scrotum. Convolutions appear in the brain structure.  At _nine months_ the anxious time of parturition has arrived. The foetus is from nineteen to twenty-three inches in length and weighs on an average from six to eight pounds. Children at birth sometimes weigh as much as fourteen pounds; but such extremes are very rare. At this period the white and grey matter of the brain are distinct, and the convolutions are well marked; the nails assume a horny consistence, hair upon the head is more or less abundant, the testes are in the scrotum, and the entire external genital organs of both male and female are well formed.  The above particulars respecting the development of the human being have been narrated to show that one organ is just as important as another, and that each is really dependent upon the other; no one could exist without the other and all are to subserve a use. First must be the _esse_ (the inmost) the vital force imparted to the ovule. A little later certain changes take place in the ovule, later still other changes, and finally about the fifteenth day a slight development of the new human being can just be outlined by the help of the microscope, which, as before stated, has form at about the third week after conception. First the vestige of a head and body, a little later the heart and lungs appear lying in the open chest; then the hands are protruded from the sides of the trunk, afterwards the forearms, then the arms, all pushed out from the body; the feet and legs gradually protrude from the lower end of the trunk, and the chest closes up so that the heart and lungs can no longer be seen; the face, mouth and eyes take form, the external genital organs make their appearance in conjunction with other developments, and in due course of time the boy or girl is born ready for further developments in childhood, and adolescence. When the latter development has been attained, if due care has been taken by all interested parties, we have pure men and pure women fitted to enter upon the privileges and the _uses_ of a wedded life according to the design of our Creator.  How wonderfully and how instructively are all organs in the animal body disposed and arranged! In the highest place we find the brain to govern and rule over all below. It is the first organ formed and in an orderly life should control all the others. Next in order and importance are the heart and lungs, which put into motion all other parts and enable the animal frame to continue in motion. So each and every organ is developed in its proper order, all to obey the commands of the first and most important--the brain, the seat of the reason and the will. Happy are they of either sex who will govern themselves by a pure enlightened reason and a pure affectionate will.     CHAPTER II.  The Infant.  Embracing the First Year of the Child's Life.   The battle of life really begins as soon as the child is born. Its cleanliness, its clothing, its temperature and its food are matters for daily observance and care, as also are the light, sunshine and air which it is to breathe. Opiates, soothing syrups and cordials, are to be strictly avoided as being deleterious to health; proper sanitary measures usually suffice to render all _dosing_ unnecessary. Spirituous potions and lotions should be avoided as being contrary to the laws of hygiene as well as for fear the child may learn to love and to become addicted to their use later in life. Every organ of the body should be carefully protected even at this early age, so that health may reign supreme. Particular care and the utmost solicitude should be bestowed upon the genital organs. No rubbing or handling of these parts should be permitted under any pretense whatever--beyond what may be absolutely necessary for cleanliness. The genital organs require just as much watchful care, if not more, as the stomach, the eye, the ear, &c. I regret to say that I have known some fathers to tickle the genital organs of their infant boys until a complete erection of the little penis ensued, which effect pleases the father as an evidence of a robust boy. The evil effects of such a procedure are too manifest to require dilating upon. Fathers take warning!  Nurses are known to quiet young children by gently exciting pleasurable sensations about the genital organs both of males and females--practices which are the most vicious and vice-begetting that can possibly be invented. Many a young man and young woman has fallen to very low depths from influences developed by these and similar means. Nurses should be cautioned in this matter _and carefully watched too_, as even the least suspected may (innocently perhaps) be guilty of this fault to save themselves the trouble of quieting their charges in a proper way. Early impressions upon these animal passions, as well as those made upon other senses of the young, are very abiding. Mothers be watchful!  Great care should be exercised in the choice of a diaper for infants and the material of which it is made. The diaper should "]]]
