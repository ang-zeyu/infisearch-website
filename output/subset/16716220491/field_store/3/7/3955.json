Measurably justified, in my opinion, is the plan of the old opera, which concentrated and musically rounded out the passions aroused by a moving dramatic scene in a piece of set form (the aria). _Word_ and stage-play conveyed the dramatic progress of the action, followed more or less meagrely by musical recitative; arrived at the point of rest, music resumed the reins. This is less extrinsic than some would now have us believe. On the other hand, it was the ossified form of the \"aria\" itself which led to inveracity of expression and decadence.                             *       *       *  THE audible presentation, the \"performance,\" of music, its _emotional interpretation_, derives from those free heights whence descended the Art itself. Where the art is threatened by earthliness, it is the part of interpretation to raise it and reëndow it with its primordial essence.  Notation, the writing out of compositions, is primarily an ingenious expedient for catching an inspiration, with the purpose of exploiting it later. But notation is to improvisation as the portrait to the living model. It is for the interpreter to _resolve the rigidity of the signs_ into the primitive emotion.  But the lawgivers require the interpreter to reproduce the rigidity of the signs; they consider his reproduction the nearer to perfection, the more closely it clings to the signs.--  What the composer's inspiration _necessarily_ loses[H] through notation, his interpreter should restore by his own.    [H] How strongly notation influences style in music, and fetters   imagination, how \"form\" grew up out of it and from form arose   \"conventionalism\" in expression, is shown very convincingly and   avenges itself in tragic wise in E. T. A. Hoffmann, who occurs to me   here as a typical example.    This remarkable man's mental conceptions, lost in visionary moods   and revelling in transcendentalism, as his writings set forth in oft   inimitable fashion, must naturally--so one would infer--have found in   the dreamlike and transcendental art of tones a language and mode of   expression peculiarly congenial.    The veil of mysticism, the secret harmonies of Nature, the thrill of   the supernatural, the twilight vagueness of the borderland of dreams,   everything, in fact, which he so effectively limned with the precision   of _words_--all this, one would suppose, he could have interpreted to   fullest effect by the aid of music. And yet, comparing Hoffmann's best   musical work with the weakest of his literary productions, you will   discover to your sorrow how a conventional system of measures, periods   and keys--whereto the hackneyed opera-style of the time adds its   share--could turn a poet into a Philistine. But that his fancy   cherished another ideal of music, we learn from many, and frequently   admirable, observations of Hoffmann the _littérateur_.  To the lawgivers, the signs themselves are the most important matter, and are continually growing in their estimation; the new art of music is derived from the old signs--_and these now stand for musical art itself_.  If the lawgivers had their way, any given composition would always be reproduced in precisely the same tempo, whensoever, by whomsoever, and under whatsoever conditions it might be performed.  But, it _is_ not possible; the buoyant, expansive nature of the divine child rebels--it demands the opposite. Each day begins differently from the preceding, yet always with the flush of dawn.--Great artists play their own works differently at each repetition, remodel them on the spur of the moment, accelerate and retard, in a way which they could not indicate by signs--and always according to the given conditions of that \"eternal harmony.\"  And then the lawgiver chafes, and refers the creator to his own handwriting. As matters stand to-day, the lawgiver has the best of the argument.                             *       *       *  \"Notation\" (\"writing down\") brings up the subject of Transcription, nowadays a term much misunderstood, almost discreditable. The frequent antagonism which I have excited with \"transcriptions,\" and the opposition to which an ofttimes irrational criticism has provoked me, caused me to seek a clear understanding of this point. My final conclusion concerning it is this: Every notation is, in itself, the transcription of an abstract idea. The instant the pen seizes it, the idea loses its original form. The very intention to write down the idea, compels a choice of measure and key. The form, and the musical agency, which the composer must decide upon, still more closely define the way and the limits.  It is much the same as with man himself. Born naked, and as yet without definite aspirations, he decides, or at a given moment is made to decide, upon a career. From the moment of decision, although much that is original and imperishable in the idea or the man may live on, either is depressed to the type of a class. The musical idea becomes a sonata or a concerto; the man, a soldier or a priest. That is an Arrangement of the original. From this first transcription to a second the step is comparatively short and unimportant. And yet it is only the second, in general, of which any notice is taken; overlooking the fact, that a transcription does not destroy the archetype, which is, therefore, not lost through transcription.  Again, the performance of a work is also a transcription, and still, whatever liberties it may take, it can never annihilate the original.  For the musical art-work exists, before its tones resound and after they die away, _complete and intact_. It exists both within and outside of time, and through its nature we can obtain a definite conception of the otherwise intangible notion of the Ideality of Time.  For the rest, most of Beethoven's piano compositions sound like transcriptions of orchestral works; most of Schumann's orchestral compositions, like arrangements from pieces for the piano--and they are so, in a way.                             *       *       *  Strangely enough, the Variation-Form is highly esteemed by the Worshippers of the Letter. That is singular; for the variation-form--when built up on a borrowed theme--produces a _whole series of \"arrangements\"_ which, besides, are least respectful when most ingenious.  So the arrangement is _not_ good, because it _varies_ the original; and the variation _is_ good, although it \"_arranges_\" the original.                             *       *       *  THE term \"musikalisch\" (musical) is used by the Germans in a sense foreign to that in which any other language employs it.[I] It is a conception belonging to the Germans, and not to culture in general; the expression is incorrect and untranslatable. \"Musical\" is derived from _music_, like \"poetical\" from _poetry_, or \"physical\" from _physic(s)_. When I say, \"Schubert was one of the most musical among men,\" it is the same as if I should say, \"Helmholtz was one of the most physical among men.\" That is musical, which _sounds_ in rhythms and intervals. A cupboard can be \"musical,\" if \"music-works\" be enclosed in it.[J] In a comparative sense, \"musical\" may have the further signification of \"euphonious.\"--\"My verses are too musical to bear setting to music,\" a noted poet once remarked to me.    [I] The author probably had in mind the languages of southern Europe;   the word is employed in English, and in the tongues of the   Scandinavian group, with precisely the same meaning as in German.   [Translator's Note.]    [J] The only kind of people one might properly call _musical_, are the   singers; for they themselves can sound. Similarly, a clown who by some   trick produces tones when he is touched, might be called a   _pseudo-musical_ person.      \"Spirits moving musically      To a lute's well-tuned law,\"  writes Edgar Allan Poe. Lastly, one may speak quite correctly of \"musical laughter,\" because it _sounds_ like music.  Taking the signification in which the term is applied and almost exclusively employed in German, a musical person is one who manifests an inclination for music by a nice discrimination and sensitiveness with regard to the _technical aspects_ of the art. By \"technics\" I mean rhythm, harmony, intonation, part-leading, and the treatment of themes. The more subtleties he is capable of hearing or reproducing in these, the more \"musical\" he is held to be.  In view of the great importance attached to these elements of the art, this \"musical\" temperament has naturally become of the highest consequence. And so an artist who plays with perfect technical finish should be deemed the most musical player. But as we mean by \"technics\" only the mechanical mastery of the instrument, the terms \"technical\" and \"musical\" have been turned into opposites.  The matter has been carried so far as to call a composition itself \"musical,\"[K] or even to assert of a great composer like Berlioz that he was not sufficiently musical.[L] \"Unmusical\" conveys the strongest reproach; branded thus, its object becomes an outlaw.[M]    [K] \"But these pieces are so musical,\" a violinist once remarked to me   of a four-hand worklet which I had characterized as trivial.    [L] \"My dog is _very_ musical,\" I have heard said in all seriousness.   Should the dog take precedence of Berlioz?    [M] Such has been my own fate.  In a country like Italy, where all participate in the delights of music, this differentiation becomes superfluous, and the term corresponding is not found in the language. In France, where a living sense of music does not permeate the people, there are musicians and non-musicians; of the rest, some \"are very fond of music,\" and others \"do not care for it.\" Only in Germany is it made a point of honor to be \"musical,\""]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31840"],["title","Ring Once for Death (#1)"],["body"," autopsy myself. I'm going to turn back and do it now. I have to know!\"  He pulled abruptly to the left to swing into a side road and turn. Edith Williams never saw the car that hit them. She heard the frantic blare of a horn and a scream of brakes, and in a frozen instant realized that there had been someone behind them, about to pass. Then the impact came, throwing her forward into the windshield and unconsciousness.         *       *       *       *       *  Edith Williams opened her eyes. Even before she realized that she was lying on the ground and that the figure bending over her was a State Trooper, she remembered the crash. Her head hurt but there was no confusion in her mind. Automatically, even as she tried to sit up, she accepted the fact that there had been a crash, help had come, and she must have been unconscious for several minutes at least.  \"Hey, lady, take it easy!\" the Trooper protested. \"You had a bad bump. You got to lie still until the ambulance gets here. It'll be along in five minutes.\"  \"Mark,\" Edith said, paying no attention. \"My husband! Is he all right?\"  \"Now lady, please. He's being taken care of. You--\"  But she was not listening. Holding to his arm she pulled herself to a sitting position. She saw their car on its side some yards away, other cars pulled up around them, a little knot of staring people. Saw them and dismissed them. Her gaze found her husband, lying on the ground a few feet away, a coat folded beneath his head.  Mark was dead. She had been a doctor's wife for twenty years, and before that a nurse. She knew death when she saw it.  \"Mark.\" The word was spoken to herself, but the Trooper took it for a question.  \"Yes, lady,\" he said. \"He's dead. He was still breathing when I got here, but he died two, three minutes ago.\"  She got to her knees. Her only thought was to reach his side. She scrambled across the few feet of ground to him still on her knees and crouched beside him, fumbling for his pulse. There was none. There was nothing. Just a man who had been alive and now was dead.  Behind her she heard a voice raised. She turned. A large, disheveled man was standing beside the Trooper, talking loudly.  \"Now listen, officer,\" he was saying, \"I'm telling you again, it wasn't my fault. The guy pulled sharp left right in front of me. Not a thing I could do. It's a wonder we weren't all three of us killed. You can see by the marks on their car it wasn't my fault--\"  Edith Williams closed her mind to the voice. She let Mark's hand lie in her lap as she fumbled in her bag, which was somehow still clutched in her fingers. She groped for a handkerchief to stem the tears which would not be held back. Something was in the way--something smooth and hard and cold. She drew it out and heard the thin, sweet tinkle of the crystal bell. She must have dropped it automatically into her bag as they were preparing to leave the house.  The hand in her lap moved. She gasped and bent forward as her husband's eyes opened.  \"Mark!\" she whispered. \"Mark, darling!\"  \"Edith,\" Mark Williams said with an effort. \"Sorry--damned careless of me. Thinking of the hospital....\"  \"You're alive!\" she said. \"You're _alive_! Oh, darling, darling, lie still, the ambulance will be here any second.\"  \"Ambulance?\" he protested. \"I'm all right now. Help me--sit up.\"  \"But Mark----\"  \"Just a bump on the head.\" He struggled to sit up. The State Trooper came over.  \"Easy, buddy, easy,\" he said, his voice awed. \"We thought you were gone. Now let's not lose you a second time.\" His mouth was tight.  \"Hey, I'm sure glad you're all right!\" the red-faced man said in a rush of words. \"Whew, fellow, you had me all upset, even though it wasn't my fault. I mean, how's a guy gonna keep from hitting you when--when----\"  \"Catch him!\" Mark Williams cried, but the Trooper was too late. The other man plunged forward to the ground and lay where he had fallen without quivering.         *       *       *       *       *  The clock in the hall struck two with muted strokes. Cautiously Edith Williams rose on her elbow and looked down at her husband's face. His eyes opened and looked back at her.  \"You're awake,\" she said, unnecessarily.  \"I woke up a few minutes ago,\" he answered. \"I've been lying here--thinking.\"  \"I'll get you another phenobarbital. Dr. Amos said for you to take them and sleep until tomorrow.\"  \"I know. I'll take one presently. You know--hearing that clock just now reminded me of something.\"  \"Yes?\"  \"Just before I came to this afternoon, after the crash, I had a strange impression of hearing a bell ring. It sounded so loud in my ears I opened my eyes to see where it was.\"  \"A--bell?\"  \"Yes. Just auditory hallucination, of course.\"  \"But Mark--\"  \"Yes?\"  \"A--a bell did ring. I mean, I had the crystal bell in my bag and it tinkled a little. Do you suppose--\"  \"Of course not.\" But though he spoke swiftly he did not sound convincing. \"This was a loud bell. Like a great gong.\"  \"But--I mean, Mark darling--a moment earlier you--had no pulse.\"  \"No pulse?\"  \"And you weren't--breathing. Then the crystal bell tinkled and you--you....\"  \"Nonsense! I know what you're thinking and believe me--it's nonsense!\"  \"But Mark.\" She spoke carefully. \"The driver of the other car. You had no sooner regained consciousness than he--\"  \"He had a fractured skull!\" Dr. Williams interrupted sharply. \"The ambulance intern diagnosed it. Skull fractures often fail to show themselves and then--bingo, you keel over. That's what happened. Now let's say no more about it.\"  \"Of course.\" In the hall, the clock struck the quarter hour. \"Shall I fix the phenobarbital now?\"  \"Yes--no. Is David home?\"  She hesitated. \"No, he hasn't got back yet.\"  \"Has he phoned? He knows he's supposed to be in by midnight at the latest.\"  \"No, he--hasn't phoned. But there's a school dance tonight.\"  \"That's no excuse for not phoning. He has the old car, hasn't he?\"  \"Yes. You gave him the keys this morning, remember?\"  \"All the more reason he should phone.\" Dr. Williams lay silent a moment. \"Two o'clock is too late for a 17-year-old boy to be out.\"  \"I'll speak to him. He won't do it again. Now please, Mark, let me get you the phenobarbital. I'll stay up until David--\"         *       *       *       *       *  The ringing phone, a clamor in the darkness, interrupted her. Mark Williams reached for it. The extension was beside his bed.  \"Hello,\" he said. And then, although she could not hear the answering voice, she felt him stiffen. And she knew. As well as if she could hear the words she knew, with a mother's instinct for disaster.  \"Yes,\" Dr. Williams said. \"Yes ... I see ... I understand ... I'll come at once.... Thank you for calling.\"  He slid out of bed before she could stop him.  \"An emergency call.\" He spoke quietly. \"I have to go.\" He began to throw on his clothes.  \"It's David,\" she said. \"Isn't it?\" She sat up. \"Don't try to keep me from knowing. It's about David.\"  \"Yes,\" he said. His voice was very tired. \"David is hurt. I have to go to him. An accident.\"  \"He's dead.\" She said it steadily. \"David's dead, isn't he, Mark?\"  He came over and sat beside her and put his arms around her.  \"Edith,\" he said. \"Edith--Yes, he's dead. Forty minutes ago. The car--went over a curve. They have him--at the County morgue. They want me to--identify him. Identify him. Edith! You see, the car caught fire!\"  \"I'm coming with you,\" she said. \"I'm coming with you!\"         *       *       *       *       *  The taxi waited in a pool of darkness between two street lights. The long, low building which was the County morgue, a blue lamp over its door, stood below the street level. A flight of concrete steps went down to it from the sidewalk. Ten minutes before, Dr. Mark Williams had gone down those steps. Now he climbed back up them, stiffly, wearily, like an old man.  Edith was waiting in the taxi, sitting forward on the edge of the seat, hands clenched. As he reached the last step she opened the door and stepped out.  \"Mark,\" she asked shakily, \"was it--\"  \"Yes, it's David.\" His voice was a monotone. \"Our son. I've completed the formalities. For now the only thing we can do is go home.\"  \"I'm going to him!\" She tried to pass. He caught her wrist. Discretely the taxi driver pretended to doze.  \"No, Edith! There's no need. You mustn't--see him!\"  \"He's my son!\" she cried. \"Let me go!\"  \"No! What have you got under your coat?\"  \"It's the bell, the rose-crystal bell!\" she cried. \"I'm going to ring it where David can hear!\"  Defiantly she brought forth her hand, clutching the little bell. \"It brought you back, Mark! Now it's going to bring back David!\"  \"Edith!\" he said in horror. \"You mustn't believe that's possible. You can't. Those were coincidences. Now let me have it.\"  \"No! I'm going to ring it.\" Violently she tried to break out of his grip. \"I want David back! I'm going to ring the bell!\"  She got her hand free. The crystal bell rang in the quiet of the early morning with an eerie thinness, penetrating the silence like a silver knife.  \"There!\" Edith Williams panted. \"I've rung it. I know you don't believe, but I do. It'll bring David back.\" She raised her voice. \"David!\" she called. \"David, son! Can you hear me?\"  \"Edith,\" Dr. Williams groaned. \"You're just tormenting yourself. Come home. Please come home.\"  \"Not until David has come back.... David, David, can you hear me?\" She rang the bell again, rang it until Dr. Williams seized it, then she let him take it.  \"Edith, Edith,\" he groaned. \"If only you had let me come alone....\"  \"Mark, listen!\"  \"What?\"  \"Listen!\" she whispered with fierce urgency.  He was silent. And then fingers of horror drew themselves down his spine at the clear, youthful voice that came up to them from the darkness below.  \"Mother?... Dad?... Where are you?\"  \"David!\" Edith Williams breathed. \"It's David! Let me go! I must go to him.\"  \"No, Edith!\" her husband whispered frantically, as the voice below called again.  \"Dad?... Mother?... Are you up there? "]]]
