The old man tried another listener.  \"What have they got in those sacks, Captain?\" he inquired, as that great being passed them in his never ending parade to and fro on the deck.  The Captain paused in his march, and towered over the travellers--tall, grave, and serenely self-satisfied.  \"Fishermen,\" he explained, \"are often passengers in My ship. These five are from Mhruxi--the place we last touched at--and that's the way they carry their money. The money of this island is heavy, gentlemen, but it costs little, as you may guess. We buy it from them by weight--about five shillings a pound. I fancy a ten pound-note would buy all those sacks.\"  By this time the old man had closed his eyes--in order, no doubt, to concentrate his thoughts on these interesting facts; but the Captain failed to realise his motive, and with a grunt resumed his monotonous march.  Meanwhile the fishermen were getting so noisy over the weighing-machine that one of the sailors took the precaution of carrying off all the weights, leaving them to amuse themselves with such substitutes in the form of winch-handles, belaying-pins, &c., as they could find. This brought their excitement to a speedy end: they carefully hid their sacks in the folds of the jib that lay on the deck near the tourists, and strolled away.  When next the Captain's heavy footfall passed, the younger man roused himself to speak.  \"_What_ did you call the place those fellows came from, Captain?\" he asked.  \"Mhruxi, sir.\"  \"And the one we are bound for?\"  The Captain took a long breath, plunged into the word, and came out of it nobly. \"They call it Kgovjni, sir.\"  \"K--I give it up!\" the young man faintly said.  He stretched out his hand for a glass of iced water which the compassionate steward had brought him a minute ago, and had set down, unluckily, just outside the shadow of the umbrella. It was scalding hot, and he decided not to drink it. The effort of making this resolution, coming close on the fatiguing conversation he had just gone through, was too much for him: he sank back among the cushions in silence.  His father courteously tried to make amends for his _nonchalance_.  \"Whereabouts are we now, Captain?\" said he, \"Have you any idea?\"  The Captain cast a pitying look on the ignorant landsman. \"I could tell you _that_, sir,\" he said, in a tone of lofty condescension, \"to an inch!\"  \"You don't say so!\" the old man remarked, in a tone of languid surprise.  \"And mean so,\" persisted the Captain. \"Why, what do you suppose would become of My ship, if I were to lose My Longitude and My Latitude? Could _you_ make anything of My Dead Reckoning?\"  \"Nobody could, I'm sure!\" the other heartily rejoined.  But he had overdone it.  \"It's _perfectly_ intelligible,\" the Captain said, in an offended tone, \"to any one that understands such things.\" With these words he moved away, and began giving orders to the men, who were preparing to hoist the jib.  Our tourists watched the operation with such interest that neither of them remembered the five money-bags, which in another moment, as the wind filled out the jib, were whirled overboard and fell heavily into the sea.  But the poor fishermen had not so easily forgotten their property. In a moment they had rushed to the spot, and stood uttering cries of fury, and pointing, now to the sea, and now to the sailors who had caused the disaster.  The old man explained it to the Captain.  \"Let us make it up among us,\" he added in conclusion. \"Ten pounds will do it, I think you said?\"  [Illustration]  But the Captain put aside the suggestion with a wave of the hand.  \"No, sir!\" he said, in his grandest manner. \"You will excuse Me, I am sure; but these are My passengers. The accident has happened on board My ship, and under My orders. It is for Me to make compensation.\" He turned to the angry fishermen. \"Come here, my men!\" he said, in the Mhruxian dialect. \"Tell me the weight of each sack. I saw you weighing them just now.\"  Then ensued a perfect Babel of noise, as the five natives explained, all screaming together, how the sailors had carried off the weights, and they had done what they could with whatever came handy.  Two iron belaying-pins, three blocks, six holystones, four winch-handles, and a large hammer, were now carefully weighed, the Captain superintending and noting the results. But the matter did not seem to be settled, even then: an angry discussion followed, in which the sailors and the five natives all joined: and at last the Captain approached our tourists with a disconcerted look, which he tried to conceal under a laugh.  \"It's an absurd difficulty,\" he said. \"Perhaps one of you gentlemen can suggest something. It seems they weighed the sacks two at a time!\"  \"If they didn't have five separate weighings, of course you can't value them separately,\" the youth hastily decided.  \"Let's hear all about it,\" was the old man's more cautious remark.  \"They _did_ have five separate weighings,\" the Captain said, \"but--Well, it beats _me_ entirely!\" he added, in a sudden burst of candour. \"Here's the result. First and second sack weighed twelve pounds; second and third, thirteen and a half; third and fourth, eleven and a half; fourth and fifth, eight: and then they say they had only the large hammer left, and it took _three_ sacks to weigh it down--that's the first, third and fifth--and _they_ weighed sixteen pounds. There, gentlemen! Did you ever hear anything like _that_?\"  The old man muttered under his breath \"If only my sister were here!\" and looked helplessly at his son. His son looked at the five natives. The five natives looked at the Captain. The Captain looked at nobody: his eyes were cast down, and he seemed to be saying softly to himself \"Contemplate one another, gentlemen, if such be your good pleasure. _I_ contemplate _Myself_!\"     KNOT V.  OUGHTS AND CROSSES.     \"Look here, upon this picture, and on this.\"   \"And what made you choose the first train, Goosey?\" said Mad Mathesis, as they got into the cab. \"Couldn't you count better than _that_?\"  \"I took an extreme case,\" was the tearful reply. \"Our excellent preceptress always says 'When in doubt, my dears, take an extreme case.' And I _was_ in doubt.\"  \"Does it always succeed?\" her aunt enquired.  Clara sighed. \"Not _always_,\" she reluctantly admitted. \"And I can't make out why. One day she was telling the little girls--they make such a noise at tea, you know--'The more noise you make, the less jam you will have, and _vice vers秬.' And I thought they wouldn't know what '_vice vers秬' meant: so I explained it to them. I said 'If you make an infinite noise, you'll get no jam: and if you make no noise, you'll get an infinite lot of jam.' But our excellent preceptress said that wasn't a good instance. _Why_ wasn't it?\" she added plaintively.  Her aunt evaded the question. \"One sees certain objections to it,\" she said. \"But how did you work it with the Metropolitan trains? None of them go infinitely fast, I believe.\"  \"I called them hares and tortoises,\" Clara said--a little timidly, for she dreaded being laughed at. \"And I thought there couldn't be so many hares as tortoises on the Line: so I took an extreme case--one hare and an infinite number of tortoises.\"  \"An extreme case, indeed,\" her aunt remarked with admirable gravity: \"and a most dangerous state of things!\"  \"And I thought, if I went with a tortoise, there would be only _one_ hare to meet: but if I went with the hare--you know there were _crowds_ of tortoises!\"  \"It wasn't a bad idea,\" said the elder lady, as they left the cab, at the entrance of Burlington House. \"You shall have another chance to-day. We'll have a match in marking pictures.\"  Clara brightened up. \"I should like to try again, very much,\" she said. \"I'll take more care this time. How are we to play?\"  To this question Mad Mathesis made no reply: she was busy drawing lines down the margins of the catalogue. \"See,\" she said after a minute, \"I've drawn three columns against the names of the pictures in the long room, and I want you to fill them with oughts and crosses--crosses for good marks and oughts for bad. The first column is for choice of subject, the second for arrangement, the third for colouring. And these are the conditions of the match. You must give three crosses to two or three pictures. You must give two crosses to four or five----\"  \"Do you mean _only_ two crosses?\" said Clara. \"Or may I count the three-cross pictures among the two-cross pictures?\"  \"Of course you may,\" said her aunt. \"Any one, that has _three_ eyes, may be said to have _two_ eyes, I suppose?\"  Clara followed her aunt's dreamy gaze across the crowded gallery, half-dreading to find that there was a three-eyed person in sight.  \"And you must give one cross to nine or ten.\"  \"And which wins the match?\" Clara asked, as she carefully entered these conditions on a blank leaf in her catalogue.  \"Whichever marks fewest pictures.\"  \"But suppose we marked the same number?\"  \"Then whichever uses most marks.\"  Clara considered. \"I don't think it's much of a match,\" she said. \"I shall mark nine pictures, and give three crosses to three of them, two crosses to two more, and one cross each to all the rest.\"  \"Will you, indeed?\" said her aunt. \"Wait till you've heard all the conditions, my impetuous child. You must give three oughts to one or two pictures, two oughts to three or four, and one ought to eight or nine. I don't want you to be _too_ hard on the R.A.'s.\"  Clara quite gasped as she wrote down all these fresh conditions. \"It's a great deal worse than Circulating Decimals!\" she said. \"But I'm determined to win, all the same!\"  Her aunt smiled grimly. \"We can begin _here_,\" she said, as they paused before a gigantic picture, which the catalogue informed them was the \""]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/29046"],["title","The Heads of Apex (#1)"],["body","\"  \"Nor hands either.\"  Miles and Ward glanced at one another. The same thought was in both minds. Neither of them had ever seen Mr. Solino's hands. A rum affair all right!         *       *       *       *       *  Hours passed. Some of the men fell to gambling. At intervals they ate. Twice they turned in and slept. Then, after what seemed an interminable time, Solino summoned Miles and Ward to his presence in the control room. \"It is time,\" he said, \"that you should know more of the enterprise on which you have embarked. What I say, you can communicate to the other men. A year's salary for all of you lies to your credit at the Chase Bank of New York. And this money will not be your sole reward if you survive and serve faithfully.\"  \"Thank you, sir,\" said Ward; \"but now that we are well on our way to our destination, could you not tell us more about it? You have said something of a city, a country. Where is that country?\"  \"Down,\" was the astounding answer.  \"Down?\" echoed both men.  \"Yes,\" said Solino slowly, \"down. The gateway to that land is at the bottom of the ocean.\"  As the two men gaped at him, incredulous, an awful thing happened. With an appalling roar and a rending of steel and iron, the submarine halted abruptly in its headlong flight, reared upward at an acute angle and then fell forward with a tremendous crash. The adventurers were thrown violently against a steel bulkhead, and slumped down unconscious....         *       *       *       *       *  How long they lay there insensible they never knew. Justus Miles was the first to come to, and he found himself in Stygian blackness. \"Rusty!\" he called, feeling terribly sick and giddy. Only silence answered him. \"Good God!\" he thought, \"what has happened?\" His hand went out and recoiled from something soft and sticky. Gingerly he sat up. There was a lump on his head. His body felt bruised and sore but it was evidently sound. He recollected the small but powerful flashlight in his pocket, and drew it forth and pressed the button. A reassuring pencil of light pierced through the gloom. Even as it did so, someone groaned, and Ward's voice uttered his name.  \"Is that you, Kid?\"  \"It's me, all right.\"  \"You ain't hurt?\"  \"Nothing to speak of. How about you?\"  \"O. K., I guess. An awful headache.\"  \"Can you stand up?\"  \"Yes.\"  Ward's face appeared in the ray of light, pale and blood-streaked.  \"I wonder what happened.\"  \"It sounded like a collision.\"  They stared at one another with fearful eyes. A collision while underseas in a submarine is a serious matter.  \"Where's Solino?\"  Justus Miles ran the beam of his torch this way and that, and saw that the room was in a fearful confusion. The gyroscopic mechanism had broken from its fastenings and rolled forward. Somewhere beneath its crushing weight lay the control board and the swarthy operator. Then they saw Solino, still in his overturned wheelchair, the cloak drawn tightly about himself and it; but the top of his head was crushed in like an eggshell. Justus Miles had touched that head when he stretched out his hand in the darkness.  He and Ward had been saved from death as by a miracle. Over their heads the great piston had hurtled, killing Solino and tearing through the steel partition into the chamber beyond, visiting it with death and destruction. One hasty examination of that place was enough. The men in there were dead.         *       *       *       *       *  Sick with horror, the two survivors faced the stark reality of their terrible plight. Trapped in an underwater craft, they saw themselves doomed to perish even more miserably than their companions. As the horrible thought sank home, a cool breath of air, suggesting the smell of stagnant salt water, blew through an opening created by the crushing of the plates in the vessel's hull--an opening larger than the body of a man. Miles and Ward stared at it with puzzled eyes. With such a hole in her hull, the boat should have been admitting water and not air. However, they approached the gap and examined it with their torches.  \"Here goes,\" Ward said after a moment's hesitation, and clambered through the opening, followed by his friend. When they were able to make out their surroundings, they saw that they were in a vast tunnel or cavern, the extent of which was shrouded in darkness. How the submarine had left the ocean and penetrated to this cavern it was impossible to say; but evidently it had come so far over a shining rail, a break in which had caused the disaster. The cavern or tunnel was paved with disjointed blocks of stone which once might have been smooth and even, but which now were disarranged by time and slimy with dampness and seagrowths. In the clammy air Miles involuntarily shuddered. \"Good Lord, Rusty, we're certainly up against it! The only fellow who could tell us our whereabouts is dead!\"  Ward's jaw tightened. \"That rail leads somewhere: it's our only hope. But first let us get our guns and some food.\"         *       *       *       *       *  They were fortunate enough to discover several thermos bottles unbroken. Hot coffee revived their fainting spirits. Treating their bruises and cuts as well as they could, they left the submarine or car--it seemed to have been convertible for use either in water or on rail--and trudged ahead.  Beyond the break that had caused the wreck, the rail stretched away into illimitable blackness. Over rough stones, stumbling into shallow pools of water, the light of their torches serving but faintly to show the depressing surroundings, the two men plunged. Neither of them was without fear, but both possessed the enduring courage of men habituated to facing danger and sudden death without losing control of their faculties.  Time passed, but they had no means of telling how much, since their wrist watches no longer functioned. But after a while they noticed that the grade was upward and the going easier. At the same moment, Ward called attention to the fact that, even without electric torches, it was possible to see. All around the two Americans grew a strange light--a weird, phosphorescent glow, revealing far walls and massive pillars.  Now they could see that they were in a vast chamber, undoubtedly the work of human hands; a room awe-inspiring to behold, and even more than awe-inspiring in the reflections it forced upon their minds. Passages radiated on either hand to mysterious depths, and great bulks loomed in the spectral light. Justus Miles gave a low cry of amazement when a closer investigation revealed those bulks to be the wrecks of mighty and intricate machines, the use of which it was vain to conjecture. He looked at Ward.  \"Solino spoke of a city down in the ocean. Can this be it?\"  Ward shook his head. \"Everything here is old, abandoned. Look--what is that?\"         *       *       *       *       *  The figure of a giant creature, carved either from stone or marble and encrusted with phosphorous, stood lowering in their path. It was that of a winged beast with a human head. Its features were negroid in character; and so malignant was the expression of the staring face, so lifelike the execution of the whole statue, that a chill of fear ran through their veins. It was in Ward's mind that this gigantic carving was akin to the ones he had seen in Egypt, and as old, if not older.  Beyond the statue the rail curved and the grade leveled; and, rounding the bend, they were amazed to come upon a sort of \"yard\" where the rail stopped. In that enclosure, on several sidings, were submarine cars similar to the wrecked one they had abandoned. But that was not the sight which brought them to a breathless halt. Beyond the sidings stood what appeared to be a small building of gleaming crystal.  After a moment of breathless wonder they cautiously approached the bizarre structure. No dampness or phosphorus impaired the clarity of its walls. The material composing them felt vibrantly warm to the touch. It was not glass, yet it was possible to look without difficulty into the interior of the building, which appeared to be one large room containing nothing but a central device not unlike the filaments of an electric bulb. In fact, the whole building, viewed from the outside, reminded the two adventurers of a giant light globe. The filaments radiated a steady and somehow exhilarating light. The door--they knew it was a door because an edging of dark metal outlined its frame--gave admittance to the room.  \"Shall we?\" questioned Miles; and Ward answered doubtfully, \"I don't know. Perhaps....\"  But at last they turned the golden knob, felt the door give to their pressure, and stepped through the entrance into the soft radiance of the interior. Unthinkingly, Ward released his hold on the knob and the door swung shut behind them. Instantly there was a flash of light, and they were oppressed by a feeling of nausea: and then, out of a momentary pit of blackness, they emerged to find that the room of crystal had oddly changed its proportions and opaqueness. \"Quick!\" cried Ward; \"let us get out of this place.\" Both men found the door and staggered forth.  Then, at sight of what they saw, they stood rooted to the spot in sheer amazement. The gloomy tunnel and the sidings of submarine cars had vanished, and they were standing in a vast hall, an utterly strange and magnificent hall, staring up into the face of a creature crudely human and colored green!         *       *       *       *       *  The green man was almost of heroic proportions; he was clad in but a breech-clout, and was so broad as to appear squat in stature. He carried a short club, and appeared almost as dumbfounded as the two Americans. A moment he regarded them, then, with a ferocious snarl of rage, he hurled himself upon the startled Ward and half clubbed, half pushed him to the floor. Recovering from his momentary inaction and realizing the danger in which his friend stood, Miles shouted and leaped upon the green man's back, fastening his sinewy"]]]
