Allen, type from Matamoros, Tamaulipas, has been reported from the Rio Grande Valley of Texas southward to Honduras and in Cuba. _Lasiurus floridanus_ (Miller), type from Lake Kissimmee, Florida, has been recorded from southeastern Texas, eastward along the Gulf of Mexico to Florida, and thence northward along the Atlantic Coast to extreme southeastern Virginia (see records of occurrence beyond and Fig. 2). Specimens of _intermedius_ from the vicinity of the type locality and from other localities in México differ from specimens of _floridanus_ (from Florida and southern Georgia) as follows: Larger, both externally (especially forearm) and cranially (see measurements); teeth larger and heavier; skull heavier and having more prominent sagittal and lambdoidal crests; braincase less rounded, more elongate; auditory bullae relatively smaller; upper parts averaging brighter (yellowish to yellowish-orange in general aspect, rather than yellowish-brown to brownish-gray).  The differences mentioned above are of the magnitude of those that ordinarily separate subspecies of a single species rather than two species. Miller (1902:392-393), in the original description of _floridanus_, noted that the differences between it and _intermedius_ were slight and remarked (p. 393): \"Indeed, it is probable that it intergrades with the Texas animal.\" Lowery (1936:17) also has suggested that intergradation might occur between _intermedius_ and _floridanus_ \"in southwestern Louisiana or eastern Texas\"; later (1943:223-224) he pointed out that specimens from Baton Rouge, Louisiana, averaged larger in cranial dimensions than typical _floridanus_ and again mentioned the possibility of intergradation between the two kinds. Sanborn (1954:25-26) touched obliquely on the problem when he wrote: \"In Florida, _Dasypterus intermedius_ is referred to as a Florida yellow bat (_Dasypterus floridanus_).\" Handley (1960:478) wrote that certain morphological similarities suggested \"gene flow\" between the two kinds.  Specimens examined from Louisiana resemble _floridanus_ from Georgia and Florida to the eastward in external dimensions. Some of those specimens resemble _floridanus_ in size of skull, but two skulls from Louisiana are inseparable from those of topotypes of _intermedius_. The upper parts of specimens from Louisiana are generally like those of animals to the east but average somewhat paler (less brownish). The specimens seen from Louisiana seem to be intergrades between _intermedius_ and _floridanus_ but clearly are assignable to the latter.  [Illustration: FIG. 1. Condylocanine length plotted against length of forearm for specimens of the species _Lasiurus intermedius_.]  The picture is less clear as regards bats from southeastern Texas (one specimen each from Colorado and Travis counties, and four specimens from Harris County). Five of the specimens have skulls (the Travis County specimen is a skin only) and of these, four are clearly assignable, on the basis of size and shape of the skull, to _intermedius_. The fifth skull (specimen from Colorado County) is intermediate in size between _floridanus_ and _intermedius_ and on that basis alone could be assigned with equal propriety to either. All these specimens from Texas more closely resemble _floridanus_ than _intermedius_ in external size (forearms: 49.2, 49.6, 50.7, 49.9 (approximate), 49.6, 49.1). The pale yellowish-gray upper parts of the four adults, seemingly resulting from a dilution of the brownish color found in _floridanus_, differ from the color of typical specimens of both _intermedius_ and _floridanus_, but the average is nearer that of _floridanus_ than that of _intermedius_. Color of pre-adult pelage in the one July-taken young of the year resembles the color of adults. An August-taken young of the year is in process of acquiring the adult pelage but the hairs have not reached their full growth; it is pale yellowish but not so grayish as the other specimens. All characters considered, the specimens from eastern Texas resemble _floridanus_ more than they do _intermedius_, and so are provisionally assigned to _floridanus_ (as was done by Taylor and Davis, 1947:19; Eads, _et al._, 1956:440; and, Davis, 1960:59). Additional material from southeastern Texas is needed. It will be remembered that the type locality of _intermedius_ is in the Rio Grande Valley; all specimens seen, in the study here reported on, from the Texas side of the valley are unquestionably referable to that subspecies.  Intergradation, then, occurs between _L. intermedius_ and _L. floridanus_ in some degree in southern Louisiana and in more marked degree in southeastern Texas. Specimens from the area of intergradation vary more individually in many features than do specimens from other areas. In general the intergrades tend to resemble _floridanus_ in small size externally and _intermedius_ in large size of skull. The specimens from southeastern Texas differ from typical specimens of both subspecies in color, being pale yellowish-gray (instead of yellowish to yellowish-orange as in _intermedius_ or yellowish brown to brownish-gray as in _floridanus_), and this difference is shared to some extent with animals from Louisiana, the latter being somewhat intermediate between bats from Texas and those from Florida and Georgia, although nearer those from Florida and Georgia.  An hypothesis to account for the variation noted is that in Wisconsin Time, and perhaps in earlier Pleistocene times, this yellow bat was (as it is now) a warmth-adapted animal as Blair (1959:461) would term it. Some cool period forced the mainland populations of the two species into two refugia--peninsular Florida and eastern México--and the present area of intergradation is, therefore, of a secondary rather than a primary type. Possibly also the relatively treeless area of part of southern Texas has made for a sparse population there of _Lasiurus intermedius_ and gene flow now may be, and long may have been, slight between the eastern and southern segments of the species.  It could be contended that the peculiar coloration of specimens from southeastern Texas, coupled with the tendency to have a large skull (as has _intermedius_) and small external dimensions (as has _floridanus_), justifies subspecific recognition for the animals that here are termed intergrades. But, judging by the specimens now available, such subspecific recognition would tend to obscure rather than clarify the geographic variation noted.   _Life History_  Probably bats of the species _Lasiurus intermedius_ seek retreats primarily in trees (see Moore, 1949_a_:59-60) but Baker and Dickerman (1956:443) reported \"approximately 45 yellow bats\" concealed on July 22, 1955, \"among dried corn stalks hanging from the sides of a large open tobacco shed\" in the state of Veracruz. Young are born in late spring, three being the only number known except that Davis (1960:59) was told that in the vicinity of Mission, Texas, two was the usual number \"born in May and June.\" Sherman (1945:194) reported a female with young (number not given) taken on June 7, 1918, at Seven Oaks, Florida, and another with three young taken on June 20, 1941, at Ocala, Florida. Lowery (1936:17) recorded a female, having three young, obtained on June 17, 1932, at Baton Rouge, Louisiana. A specimen taken on May 19, 1940, at Baton Rouge contained three embryos. Baker and Dickerman (_loc. cit._) reported four adult females from Veracruz as lactating on July 22, 1955, but they were accompanied by flying young of the year and probably were near the end of the lactation period. Among specimens examined, juveniles are available by date as follows: 5 mi. N Baton Rouge, Louisiana (June 26, 1953); Palm Beach, Florida (July 6, 1950); and Izamal, Yucatán (\"taken with mother\" on July 28, 1910). Breeding probably takes place in autumn and winter; Sherman (_op. cit._:196) reported males from Florida as sexually \"mature\" from the beginning of September to mid-February. Late winter segregation of sexes has been reported.   _Subspecies_  In the following accounts, localities of occurrence in each state are listed from north to south; if two lie in the same latitude, the westernmost is"]]]
