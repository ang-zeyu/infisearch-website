These tubes are expanded at their ends by a special tool into the tube-plates of the fire-box and boiler front. George Stephenson and his predecessors experienced great difficulty in rendering the tube-end joints quite water-tight, but the invention of the \"expander\" has removed this trouble.  The _fire-brick arch_ shown (Fig. 6) in the fire-box is used to deflect the flames towards the back of the fire-box, so that the hot gases may be retarded somewhat, and their combustion rendered more perfect. It also helps to distribute the heat more evenly over the whole of the inside of the box, and prevents cold air from flying directly from the firing door to the tubes. In some American and Continental locomotives the fire-brick arch is replaced by a \"water bridge,\" which serves the same purpose, while giving additional heating surface.  The water circulation in a locomotive boiler is--upwards at the fire-box end, where the heat is most intense; forward along the surface; downwards at the smoke-box end; backwards along the bottom of the barrel.   OTHER TYPES OF BOILERS.  For small stationary land engines the _vertical_ boiler is much used. In Fig. 8 we have three forms of this type--A and B with cross water-tubes; C with vertical fire-tubes. The furnace in every case is surrounded by water, and fed through a door at one side.  [Illustration: FIG. 8.--Diagrammatic representation of three types of vertical boilers.]  The _Lancashire_ boiler is of large size. It has a cylindrical shell, measuring up to 30 feet in length and 7 feet in diameter, traversed from end to end by two large flues, in the rear part of which are situated the furnaces. The boiler is fixed on a seating of fire-bricks, so built up as to form three flues, A and BB, shown in cross section in Fig. 9. The furnace gases, after leaving the two furnace flues, are deflected downwards into the channel A, by which they pass underneath the boiler to a point almost under the furnace, where they divide right and left and travel through cross passages into the side channels BB, to be led along the boiler's flanks to the chimney exit C. By this arrangement the effective heating surface is greatly increased; and the passages being large, natural draught generally suffices to maintain proper combustion. The Lancashire boiler is much used in factories and (in a modified form) on ships, since it is a steady steamer and is easily kept in order.  [Illustration: FIG. 9.--Cross and longitudinal sections of a Lancashire boiler.]  In marine boilers of cylindrical shape cross water-tubes and fire-tubes are often employed to increase the heating surface. Return tubes are also led through the water to the funnels, situated at the same end as the furnace.   AIDS TO COMBUSTION.  We may now turn our attention more particularly to the chemical process called _combustion_, upon which a boiler depends for its heat. Ordinary steam coal contains about 85 per cent. of carbon, 7 per cent. of oxygen, and 4 per cent. of hydrogen, besides traces of nitrogen and sulphur and a small incombustible residue. When the coal burns, the nitrogen is released and passes away without combining with any of the other elements. The sulphur unites with hydrogen and forms sulphuretted hydrogen (also named sulphurous acid), which is injurious to steel plates, and is largely responsible for the decay of tubes and funnels. More of the hydrogen unites with the oxygen as steam.  The most important element in coal is the carbon (known chemically by the symbol C). Its combination with oxygen, called combustion, is the act which heats the boiler. Only when the carbon present has combined with the greatest possible amount of oxygen that it will take into partnership is the combustion complete and the full heat-value (fixed by scientific experiment at 14,500 thermal units per pound of carbon) developed.  Now, carbon may unite with oxygen, atom for atom, and form _carbon monoxide_ (CO); or in the proportion of one atom of carbon to _two_ of oxygen, and form _carbon dioxide_ (CO_2). The former gas is combustible--that is, will admit another atom of carbon to the molecule--but the latter is saturated with oxygen, and will not burn, or, to put it otherwise, is the product of _perfect_ combustion. A properly designed furnace, supplied with a due amount of air, will cause nearly all the carbon in the coal burnt to combine with the full amount of oxygen. On the other hand, if the oxygen supply is inefficient, CO as well as CO_2 will form, and there will be a heat loss, equal in extreme cases to two-thirds of the whole. It is therefore necessary that a furnace which has to eat up fuel at a great pace should be artificially fed with air in the proportion of from 12 to 20 _pounds_ of air for every pound of fuel. There are two methods of creating a violent draught through the furnace. The first is--  The _forced draught_; very simply exemplified by the ordinary bellows used in every house. On a ship (Fig. 10) the principle is developed as follows:--The boilers are situated in a compartment or compartments having no communication with the outer air, except for the passages down which air is forced by powerful fans at a pressure considerably greater than that of the atmosphere. There is only one \"way out\"--namely, through the furnace and tubes (or gas-ways) of the boiler, and the funnel. So through these it rushes, raising the fuel to white heat. As may easily be imagined, the temperature of a stokehold, especially in the tropics, is far from pleasant. In the Red Sea the thermometer sometimes rises to 170Â° Fahrenheit or more, and the poor stokers have a very bad time of it.  [Illustration: FIG. 10.--Sketch showing how the \"forced draught\" is produced in a stokehold and how it affects the furnaces.]  [Illustration: SCENE IN THE STOKEHOLD OF A BATTLE-SHIP.]  The second system is that of the _induced draught_. Here air is _sucked_ through the furnace by creating a vacuum in the funnel and in a chamber opening into it. Turning to Fig. 6, we see a pipe through which the exhaust steam from the locomotive's cylinders is shot upwards into the funnel, in which, and in the smoke-box beneath it, a strong vacuum is formed while the engine is running. Now, \"nature abhors a vacuum,\" so air will get into the smoke-box if there be a way open. There is--through the air-doors at the bottom of the furnace, the furnace itself, and the fire-tubes; and on the way oxygen combines with the carbon of the fuel, to form carbon dioxide. The power of the draught is so great that, as one often notices when a train passes during the night, red-hot cinders, plucked from the fire-box, and dragged through the tubes, are hurled far into the air. It might be mentioned in parenthesis that the so-called \"smoke\" which pours from the funnel of a moving engine is mainly condensing steam. A steamship, on the other hand, belches smoke only from its funnels, as fresh water is far too precious to waste as steam. We shall refer to this later on (p. 72).   BOILER FITTINGS.  The most important fittings on a boiler are:--(1) the safety-valve; (2) the water-gauge; (3) the steam-gauge; (4) the mechanisms for feeding it with water.   THE SAFETY-VALVE.  Professor Thurston, an eminent authority on the steam-engine, has estimated that a plain cylindrical boiler carrying 100 lbs. pressure to the square inch contains sufficient stored energy to project it into the air a vertical distance of 3-1/2 miles. In the case of a Lancashire boiler at equal pressure the distance would be 2-1/2 miles; of a locomotive boiler, at 125 lbs., 1-1/2 miles; of a steam tubular boiler, at 75 lbs., 1 mile. According to the same writer, a cubic foot of heated water under a pressure of from 60 to 70 lbs. per square inch has _about the same energy as one pound of gunpowder_.  Steam is a good servant, but a terrible master. It must be kept under strict control. However strong a boiler may be, it will burst if the steam pressure in it be raised to a certain point; and some device must therefore be fitted on it which will give the steam free egress before that point is reached. A device of this kind is called a _safety-valve_. It usually blows off at less than half the greatest pressure that the boiler has been proved by experiment to be capable of withstanding.  In principle the safety-valve denotes an orifice closed by an accurately-fitting plug, which is pressed against its seat on the boiler top by a weighted lever, or by a spring. As soon as the steam pressure on the face of the plug exceeds the counteracting force of the weight or spring, the plug rises, and steam escapes until equilibrium of the opposing forces is restored.  On stationary engines a lever safety-valve is commonly employed (Fig. 11). The blowing-off point can be varied by shifting the weight along the arm so as to give it a greater or less leverage. On locomotive and marine boilers, where shocks and movements have to be reckoned with, weights are replaced by springs, set to a certain tension, and locked up so that they cannot be tampered with.  [Illustration: FIG. 11.--A LEVER SAFETY-VALVE. V, valve; S, seating; P, pin; L, lever; F, fulcrum; W, weight. The figures indicate the positions at which the weight should be placed for the valve to act when the pressure rises to that number of pounds per square inch.]  Boilers are tested by filling the boilers quite full and (1) by heating the water, which expands slightly, but with great pressure; (2) by forcing in additional water with a powerful pump. In either case a rupture would not be attended by an explosion, as water is very inelastic.  The days when an engineer could \"sit on the valves\"--that is, screw them down--to obtain greater pressure, are now past, and with them a considerable proportion of the dangers of high-pressure steam.

The wub stopped, turning its great head.  Captain Franco came into the room, the men behind him. They hesitated at the door.  \"Are you all right?\" French said.  \"Do you mean me?\" Peterson said, surprised. \"Why me?\"  Franco lowered his gun. \"Come over here,\" he said to Peterson. \"Get up and come here.\"  There was silence.  \"Go ahead,\" the wub said. \"It doesn't matter.\"  Peterson stood up. \"What for?\"  \"It's an order.\"  Peterson walked to the door. French caught his arm.  \"What's going on?\" Peterson wrenched loose. \"What's the matter with you?\"  Captain Franco moved toward the wub. The wub looked up from where it lay in the corner, pressed against the wall.  \"It is interesting,\" the wub said, \"that you are obsessed with the idea of eating me. I wonder why.\"  \"Get up,\" Franco said.  \"If you wish.\" The wub rose, grunting. \"Be patient. It is difficult for me.\" It stood, gasping, its tongue lolling foolishly.  \"Shoot it now,\" French said.  \"For God's sake!\" Peterson exclaimed. Jones turned to him quickly, his eyes gray with fear.  \"You didn't see him--like a statue, standing there, his mouth open. If we hadn't come down, he'd still be there.\"  \"Who? The Captain?\" Peterson stared around. \"But he's all right now.\"  They looked at the wub, standing in the middle of the room, its great chest rising and falling.  \"Come on,\" Franco said. \"Out of the way.\"  The men pulled aside toward the door.  \"You are quite afraid, aren't you?\" the wub said. \"Have I done anything to you? I am against the idea of hurting. All I have done is try to protect myself. Can you expect me to rush eagerly to my death? I am a sensible being like yourselves. I was curious to see your ship, learn about you. I suggested to the native--\"  The gun jerked.  \"See,\" Franco said. \"I thought so.\"  The wub settled down, panting. It put its paw out, pulling its tail around it.  \"It is very warm,\" the wub said. \"I understand that we are close to the jets. Atomic power. You have done many wonderful things with it--technically. Apparently, your scientific hierarchy is not equipped to solve moral, ethical--\"  Franco turned to the men, crowding behind him, wide-eyed, silent.  \"I'll do it. You can watch.\"  French nodded. \"Try to hit the brain. It's no good for eating. Don't hit the chest. If the rib cage shatters, we'll have to pick bones out.\"  \"Listen,\" Peterson said, licking his lips. \"Has it done anything? What harm has it done? I'm asking you. And anyhow, it's still mine. You have no right to shoot it. It doesn't belong to you.\"  Franco raised his gun.  \"I'm going out,\" Jones said, his face white and sick. \"I don't want to see it.\"  \"Me, too,\" French said. The men straggled out, murmuring. Peterson lingered at the door.  \"It was talking to me about myths,\" he said. \"It wouldn't hurt anyone.\"  He went outside.  Franco walked toward the wub. The wub looked up slowly. It swallowed.  \"A very foolish thing,\" it said. \"I am sorry that you want to do it. There was a parable that your Saviour related--\"  It stopped, staring at the gun.  \"Can you look me in the eye and do it?\" the wub said. \"Can you do that?\"  The Captain gazed down. \"I can look you in the eye,\" he said. \"Back on the farm we had hogs, dirty razor-back hogs. I can do it.\"  Staring down at the wub, into the gleaming, moist eyes, he pressed the trigger.         *       *       *       *       *  The taste was excellent.  They sat glumly around the table, some of them hardly eating at all. The only one who seemed to be enjoying himself was Captain Franco.  \"More?\" he said, looking around. \"More? And some wine, perhaps.\"  \"Not me,\" French said. \"I think I'll go back to the chart room.\"  \"Me, too.\" Jones stood up, pushing his chair back. \"I'll see you later.\"  The Captain watched them go. Some of the others excused themselves.  \"What do you suppose the matter is?\" the Captain said. He turned to Peterson. Peterson sat staring down at his plate, at the potatoes, the green peas, and at the thick slab of tender, warm meat.  He opened his mouth. No sound came.  The Captain put his hand on Peterson's shoulder.  \"It is only organic matter, now,\" he said. \"The life essence is gone.\" He ate, spooning up the gravy with some bread. \"I, myself, love to eat. It is one of the greatest things that a living creature can enjoy. Eating, resting, meditation, discussing things.\"  Peterson nodded. Two more men got up and went out. The Captain drank some water and sighed.  \"Well,\" he said. \"I must say that this was a very enjoyable meal. All the reports I had heard were quite true--the taste of wub. Very fine. But I was prevented from enjoying this pleasure in times past.\"  He dabbed at his lips with his napkin and leaned back in his chair. Peterson stared dejectedly at the table.  The Captain watched him intently. He leaned over.  \"Come, come,\" he said. \"Cheer up! Let's discuss things.\"  He smiled.  \"As I was saying before I was interrupted, the role of Odysseus in the myths--\"  Peterson jerked up, staring.  \"To go on,\" the Captain said. \"Odysseus, as I understand him--\"     Transcriber's Note:      This etext was produced from _Planet Stories_ July 1952.
