Not the kind of evidence that is acceptable. But the theory has much to defend it. In your own Journal of the A. M. A., May 7, 1932, Dr. Maud Slye published the first solid evidence that predisposition to so-called malignant tumor is hereditary. Is this not a better characteristic of a true mutation, rather than of a disease?\"  \"Perhaps,\" I said. \"But how does Mother Nature justify the desirability of a change from our present rather successful bisexual system? And isn't she being rather cruel in her methods? Think of the millions she has made suffer in her experiments.\"  \"Mother Nature,\" Sansome pronounced positively, \"is neither kind nor cruel. She is manifestly indifferent to all but the goal of survival of the species. Our civilization has set out to thwart her with increasingly more effective methods of birth-control. In the light of survival, Nature is most justified in trying to bring millions of frustrated, childless humans to parenthood.         *       *       *       *       *  \"Meanwhile,\" he said, riffling the case history of Sara Caffey, \"let us examine the evidence at hand. Our patient arrived in Paris positively cancerous. After confirming the diagnosis, I proposed an unprecedented treatment based on my theory. We know several body conditions which promote the rapid development of carcinoma, such as excess alkalinity and high blood sugar content and so forth. Instead of trying to reduce these and fight the tumor, I reversed the treatment and aided Miss Caffey's body to support and encourage its growth to what I predicted would be a new maturity.  \"And what happened?\" He threw up his hands. \"In two months, the tendrils of the octopus withdrew into the central body of the tumor. The tendency to spread in search for attenuated nourishment was reversed with the treatment. This alone was an accomplishment, for it would have made the growth operable in a short time.  \"Unfortunately, word of my unorthodox prescription reached a jealous colleague, and he set off such a quarrel at the Institute that Miss Caffey packed up and left with the generous misconception that she was saving me from embarrassment. I had no opportunity to assure her that the Cancer Institute would decide ultimately in my favor--which it shall when I return with a photostat of a certain birth certificate.\"  He smiled for the first time, and his charm was so powerful that I sincerely wanted to believe in him. I could see no use in denying him his request, for his prescriptions were of an innocuous nature for a normally pregnant woman such as Sara Caffey. I trusted that a normal birth of a typical baby would finally dissuade him.  I extended my hand again. \"You are most welcome to stay with us, doctor,\" I told him. \"The treatment you desire is within reason, and I admire your tenacity with your theory. I hope you will forgive me, however, if I say that I find your premises rather tenuous. I feel that we will witness a very normal birth, and ultimately Miss Caffey will find it to her peace of mind to confess a secret marriage, or, at most--an alliance of which she may be pathologically ashamed at the moment.\"  Sansome grasped my hand with enthusiasm. \"_Bien! Tres bien!_\" he exclaimed. \"This is more generous even than I expected. Certainly I do not expect a scientist of your station to swallow my theory at a gulp, Dr. Foley. I will admit that my persistence depends more than it should on intuition. But we shall see. I am grateful to you.\" And he kissed me firmly on each cheek.         *       *       *       *       *  A study of Sansome's carefully prepared case history on Sara Caffey did disturb me a little. I ordered a thorough reexamination, and was left with some puzzling conclusions at the apparent absence of tumorous growth, malignant or otherwise.  Sara was enduring most of the classic symptoms of typical pregnancy, and was enjoying Dr. Sansome's treatment hugely. She guzzled the alkaline-producing fruit juices, fortified with carefully rationed dribbles of gin. She nibbled contentedly at the sweets which the Frenchman supplied anonymously. And she raised merry hell because we refused to operate.  After two weeks, she threatened to leave. I was paged over the P. A. and got to her room in time to catch her trying to zip up her skirt.  She looked at me impatiently, and then back to her abdomen. \"Damned thing's getting out of hand.\"  She had on an expensive tweed suit, and the smart, powder-blue cashmere coat I helped her into made her look her role of distinguished world traveler, syndicated columnist and woman of parts.  She hunched her shoulders forward slightly, so the loose folds of the coat concealed her protruding middle.  \"Thanks,\" she said casually. \"I'll write you a check and be on my way.\"  \"Dr. Sansome will be disappointed,\" I said casually.  \"You heard from him?\" she asked with interest.  I nodded.  She put her hands on her hips. \"And you still persist with your fatuous idea that I'm going to have a baby?\"  \"Let us say,\" I evaded, \"that we have adopted Dr. Sansome's treatment on a wait-and-see basis. You said yourself that he refused to operate. We have definitely confirmed that much. Your condition is still inoperable, but you are coming along fine.\"  \"Well, now, why didn't you tell me that before.\" She threw off her coat and relieved the pressure of her waist zipper with a grateful sigh. \"Now you're making sense. Send out for another Spillane. I'll go along with that. But no more of this drivel about transferring me to the maternity ward, see?\"         *       *       *       *       *  Ten nights later, she changed her mind. I passed her room after a late emergency case. The door was open and I heard her crying softly to herself. I stopped in. Her bed lamp was on, and for a change she looked all woman.  I felt her pulse and asked, \"What's the matter, Sara?\"  \"I'm going to have a baby!\" she sobbed. \"I've been feeling something peculiar for some time. But tonight it kicked the hell out of me.\"  \"Want to talk about it?\" I asked, still holding her wrist.  She looked at me with genuine bafflement in her eyes. Her face was puckered up like a hurt child's. \"But it's so impossible, doctor. I'm sorry I talked to you the way I have, but so help me, I'm a good girl.\"  I almost said, _Well, these things happen_, but that would have sounded pretty silly. It was evident that she still wouldn't admit even to herself how and when it had happened.  \"Ever go on a good binge?\" I suggested.  \"Not since I was sixteen,\" she exclaimed. \"But I could use one right now. No, that might hurt the baby.\" She folded her arms protectively around her middle. \"I don't get it. I don't get it at all. But if that's the way it is--\" A crooked, pleased smile wrinkled tears from her cheeks. \"Leave it to Sary to do things the unusual way.\"  She looked up at me. \"Did you know I was the first white woman to interview a Rajah's harem eunuch?\"  \"Looks like you have a real story this time,\" I said, playing along with her.  \"Yeah. But who in hell will write it?\"         *       *       *       *       *  Phillipe Sansome made himself eminently useful. He assisted in surgery every morning, refusing fees and pleading with everyone to maintain his anonymity. The staff was in on the conspiracy, and the nurses smiled indulgently at him behind his back. But Sansome was too great a man to ridicule. The general feeling was the same as mine. He was older than he thought, not in body, but in over-tired nerves and exhausted mind. None contested his skill with the scalpel; but none gave ten cents worth of credence to his twist on the theory of evolution.  As Sara's confinement proceeded with precise conformity to my expectations, I thought Sansome would lose heart--but he didn't. He arranged to be present in the delivery room with as much interest as if we expected a breach birth of a two-headed panda.  I was unfortunately called to Baltimore at the last minute. I flew both ways, but my haste was in vain. Sara gave birth while I was still aloft.  I checked in with more excitement than I'd thought possible. I asked at the desk, \"How's Caffey?\"  \"Fine. Gave birth an hour ago. Beautiful little girl--\"  I didn't wait for more. I dashed upstairs to the maternity ward, where Sara had finally consented to be moved, and slipped into her room.  She was tired, but conscious. She smiled at me peculiarly.  \"So it's a girl!\" I exclaimed. \"Wait until I see Sansome. A beautiful, healthy, normal baby!\"  A hand tapped me softly on the shoulder, and I turned to look into Sansome's triumphant eyes.  \"Without a navel,\" he said.                                                            --WINSTON MARKS         *       *       *       *       *"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32150"],["title","Prison of a Billion Years (#1)"],["body","ffs!\" Marcia cried. She yelled it again at the top of her voice because she realized Slade would not hear her otherwise as the rain cracked and exploded and splattered and crashed. There were no droplets of water. For each one had size and shape and weight, swift-falling, hammering weight as it came down. Each one, Marcia thought wildly, struggling to keep her feet, was the size of your clenched fist there in the gray dawn of Earth.  \"The cliffs!\" she cried again.  But Adam Slade shook his head, grabbed her arm above the wrist and pulled her after him. He pointed ahead, in the direction they had been going. He said nothing. There was no need to talk. They were going forward and if it killed them probably Adam Slade did not care much.  He wanted that prison time machine for his escape and he was either going to get it or die in the attempt.  They went on slowly. First one would fall and then the other and when it was Slade who had fallen, she would wait patiently, hopefully. If he ever released his hold on the M-gun--  But if it were Marcia who fell, Slade would yank her to her feet savagely, yelling words which she had heard at first but which after a while, after an eternity of the storm, seemed to merge with the sound of the rain and the far booming of thunder out over the water and then, as if by magic, she was walking again and stumbling along with Slade, drenched and beaten and half-drowned.  She hardly remembered when night came, but presently she was aware of the darkness and the mist over the sea and over the rock and now engulfing them with its white ectoplasmic tendrils. In the mist she knew she could escape Slade, and yet she did not. Without Slade now, now in the middle of nowhere there by the sea on the shores of the young Earth, she would die in the storm. With Slade--at least for now--was life. And she went on.  The thunder followed them--and came closer.  By the middle of the night it sounded like artillery at a distance of half a mile, like a barrage of big atomic shells just out of sight behind a black ridgeline which wasn't there. And through the deeper rain-wet darkness of early morning, through the mist, tearing the mist to tatters, shredding it, came the spears and forks and lances of lightning. It was, Marcia thought, a nightmare of a storm. And she must remember it, for it would make a story, a real story, if ever she lived to tell it.  By morning, the air smelled of ozone. It reeked of ozone and around them as the gray light seeped out of the wet sky and the rain suddenly slackened as if the weak daylight dispelled it, the black rocks were blasted and broken where lightning had struck.  In the dawn's first light another helicopter came.  \"Get down!\" Slade shouted, and they dropped among the blasted black rocks, hiding there, not moving. The helicopter came on through the slackening rain, buzzing a few hundred feet over them but not circling. It was heading for the abandoned tank, Marcia thought. It wasn't looking for them here--  But suddenly the rain came down in all its savage force again, blinding bounding off the rocks, pounding relentlessly.  Overhead, the helicopter seemed to pause like a bird stricken in flight. The rotors whirled a silver shield against the rain, the great drops splattering off the shield.  And the helicopter came down under the weight of the rain.         *       *       *       *       *  It landed a hundred and fifty yards from them down the beach and Marcia watched breathlessly while three men got out and looked at each other and at the rain. The dawn light was still only a dim gray and Marcia could not see the men clearly, but abruptly a jagged spear of lightning blasted rock midway between where they were hiding and the helicopter and in the after-glare through the wet and almost crackling air, the men were very clear. And clearer still when other lightning came down around them, ringing them in, it seemed, like a tent. There was now so much lightning it looked more like an aurora than an electric storm.  The dawn earth, before life, spending itself in fury....  All at once Marcia was running down toward the edge of the water, where the helicopter was. She ran screaming and shouting but the thunder swallowed her puny voice. At every moment she expected Adam Slade to kill her, to merely stand up with the M-gun and shoot her, but he did not and perhaps her unconscious mind in the instant she had fled had instinctively known he would not. For if Adam Slade killed her, he had no hostage. If he killed her and they found him, he would have absolutely no chance.  She turned and looked behind her. There was Slade, silhouetted against the lightning, running, covering the ground in huge strides, gaining on her. She did not look back again. The whole world was lightning and thunder and her legs striking earth under her, up and down, up and down, pounding, running, fleeing, and the rain, Slade's ally, beating her, buffeting her, exploding against her.  She stumbled and fell but she was up and running again in a moment. Now Slade was very close. But the helicopter was close too. She did not think the men there had seen them yet. She waved her arms and screamed although she knew the screams would not be heard--and then Slade was on her.  They went down together and she knew she was frail and helpless before his great strength. He grabbed her, his hands, angry hands on her throat--  And lightning struck.  It bounded and bounced off rock a dozen feet from them. It shook the earth and blasted the rock and pieces like shrapnel cluttered all around them and struck them too and Marcia felt hot blood on her arm and it was her own blood.  But Slade had been momentarily stunned and she was running again. Away from him.  But away from the helicopter too. At first she did not realize that but when she did realize it, it was too late. If she doubled back now, she would rush into Slade's arms.  She ran--into the sea.  It was suddenly, unexpectedly calm. It merely eddied around her ankles, as if waiting for something. The storm seemed to be waiting too, lightning holding back, the thunder stilled, even the rain hanging there in the black heavy sky, waiting....  Slade came after her, stalking through the surf.  A single bolt of lightning lanced down at them and a great engulfing roar lifted Marcia, carried her, stunned her, and then the rain pelted down again and the sea was an angry sea and the air was supercharged with ozone and another smell. Like seared flesh.  Like seared flesh.  She saw Adam Slade then. Slade was down in a foot of water, face down. He was not moving and the water lapped around him, over him. She went to him, walking slowly.  The men from the helicopter were there too. They had seen in that final flash of lightning.  \"Are you all right, miss?\" one of them shouted.  \"Yes. Slade?\"  They turned him over. They looked at him. \"Dead,\" one of them said.  \"Dead,\" she echoed. She would have collapsed, but they caught her.         *       *       *       *       *  Then the rain really came down, not as it had come before, which was hard enough. It came in huge globes of water and each globe was as big as your head and if it hit it could stun you.  \"Slade?\" someone cried as the globes exploded violently in the surf around them.  \"He's dead. He'll keep.\"  And they went back to the helicopter with Marcia, to await the end of the storm there.  When it was over, when the sky was not black but merely the color of lead, they returned down the beach for Slade's body.  But Slade wasn't there.  \"But he was dead!\" Marcia said incredulously.  One of the men smiled. \"He didn't go anyplace under his own power. He was dead, all right. The storm took his body out to sea, is all.\"  They stood there for a moment, gazing out across the black troubled water of the infant ocean on the infant earth. A billion years ago....  Slade was out there. Slade, dead. Out there with the tides and the waters and the frequent electric storms--  \"Out there with a million bacteriological parasites on his dead body and in his dead body, which he brought with him,\" Marcia said, dreamily.  \"What are you talking about, miss?\"  Out there in the electric dawn of earth, with the bacteria which lived in his body as they lived in all other bodies. Out there with them, dead.  Food for them.  Food and water and air heavy with ozone and the electric storms.  Marcia laughed hysterically. It was a story she wanted to write.  But she wouldn't write it.  Slade was a killer, condemned to die. But Slade, dead out there with his bacteria, Slade evil to man and human society but not necessarily evil in the implacable ways of nature or perhaps grimly, terribly evil--Slade out there, dead on the bosom of the primordial waters, Slade back in time a billion years before life had been born on Earth....  She laughed hysterically as they led her away from the water. They slapped her face, gently at first, then harder. \"I'll be all right,\" she managed to say.  She would be all right. She could live to forget it.  But Slade out there.  Slade.  Slade fathering all life on earth there in the sea with his dead body. Slade who had sinned and was taken back here to die for his sins so that life could be born.  Slade, whose first name was Adam.         *       *       *       *       *"]]]
