To human eyes they were alone in the cabin. But Bat still followed a moving something with his gaze. And it was something which he had at last made up his mind to distrust and dislike. For now he took a step or two forward and spat--his loathing made plain by every raised hair along his spine. And in that same moment Steena saw a flicker--a flicker of vague outline against Cliff's hunched shoulders as if the invisible one had crossed the space between them.  But why had it been revealed against Cliff and not against the back of one of the seats or against the panels, the walls of the corridor or the cover of the bed where it had reclined and played with its loot? What could Bat see?  The storehouse memory that had served Steena so well through the years clicked open a half-forgotten door. With one swift motion she tore loose her spaceall and flung the baggy garment across the back of the nearest seat.  Bat was snarling now, emitting the throaty rising cry that was his hunting song. But he was edging back, back toward Steena's feet, shrinking from something he could not fight but which he faced defiantly. If he could draw it after him, past that dangling spaceall.... He had to--it was their only chance.  \"What the....\" Cliff had come out of his seat and was staring at them.  What he saw must have been weird enough. Steena, bare-armed and shouldered, her usually stiffly-netted hair falling wildly down her back, Steena watching empty space with narrowed eyes and set mouth, calculating a single wild chance. Bat, crouched on his belly, retreating from thin air step by step and wailing like a demon.  \"Toss me your blaster.\" Steena gave the order calmly--as if they still sat at their table in the Rigel Royal.  And as quietly Cliff obeyed. She caught the small weapon out of the air with a steady hand--caught and leveled it.  \"Stay just where you are!\" she warned. \"Back, Bat, bring it back!\"  With a last throat-splitting screech of rage and hate, Bat twisted to safety between her boots. She pressed with thumb and forefinger, firing at the spacealls. The material turned to powdery flakes of ash--except for certain bits which still flapped from the scorched seat--as if something had protected them from the force of the blast. Bat sprang straight up in the air with a scream that tore their ears.  \"What...?\" began Cliff again.  Steena made a warning motion with her left hand. \"_Wait!_\"  She was still tense, still watching Bat. The cat dashed madly around the cabin twice, running crazily with white-ringed eyes and flecks of foam on his muzzle. Then he stopped abruptly in the doorway, stopped and looked back over his shoulder for a long silent moment. He sniffed delicately.  Steena and Cliff could smell it too now, a thick oily stench which was not the usual odor left by an exploding blaster-shell.  Bat came back, treading daintily across the carpet, almost on the tips of his paws. He raised his head as he passed Steena and then he went confidently beyond to sniff, to sniff and spit twice at the unburned strips of the spaceall. Having thus paid his respects to the late enemy he sat down calmly and set to washing his fur with deliberation. Steena sighed once and dropped into the navigator's seat.  \"Maybe now you'll tell me what in the hell's happened?\" Cliff exploded as he took the blaster out of her hand.  \"Gray,\" she said dazedly, \"it must have been gray--or I couldn't have seen it like that. I'm colorblind, you see. I can see only shades of gray--my whole world is gray. Like Bat's--his world is gray too--all gray. But he's been compensated for he can see above and below our range of color vibrations and--apparently--so can I!\"   Her voice quavered and she raised her chin with a new air Cliff had never seen before--a sort of proud acceptance. She pushed back her wandering hair, but she made no move to imprison it under the heavy net again.  \"That is why I saw the thing when it crossed between us. Against your spaceall it was another shade of gray--an outline. So I put out mine and waited for it to show against that--it was our only chance, Cliff.  \"It was curious at first, I think, and it knew we couldn't see it--which is why it waited to attack. But when Bat's actions gave it away it moved. So I waited to see that flicker against the spaceall and then I let him have it. It's really very simple....\"  Cliff laughed a bit shakily. \"But what _was_ this gray thing? I don't get it.\"  \"I think it was what made the _Empress_ a derelict. Something out of space, maybe, or from another world somewhere.\" She waved her hands. \"It's invisible because it's a color beyond our range of sight. It must have stayed in here all these years. And it kills--it must--when its curiosity is satisfied.\" Swiftly she described the scene in the cabin and the strange behavior of the gem pile which had betrayed the creature to her.  Cliff did not return his blaster to its holder. \"Any more of them on board, d'you think?\" He didn't look pleased at the prospect.  Steena turned to Bat. He was paying particular attention to the space between two front toes in the process of a complete bath. \"I don't think so. But Bat will tell us if there are. He can see them clearly, I believe.\"  But there weren't any more and two weeks later Cliff, Steena and Bat brought the _Empress_ into the Lunar quarantine station. And that is the end of Steena's story because, as we have been told, happy marriages need no chronicles. And Steena had found someone who knew of her gray world and did not find it too hard to share with her--someone besides Bat. It turned out to be a real love match.  The last time I saw her she was wrapped in a flame-red cloak from the looms of Rigel and wore a fortune in Jovan rubies blazing on her wrists. Cliff was flipping a three-figure credit bill to a waiter. And Bat had a row of Vernal juice glasses set up before him.

At the age of twenty-one he studied music for a year under the Cappelmeister PABRICH, at Potsdam, and in August, 1731, he became oboist in the band of the Guards, at Hanover. In August, 1732, he married ANNA ILSE MORITZEN. She appears to have been a careful and busy wife and mother, possessed of no special faculties which would lead us to attribute to her care any great part of the abilities of her son. She could not herself write the letters which she sent to her husband during his absences with his regiment. It was her firm belief that the separations and some of the sorrows of the family came from too much learning; and while she could not hinder the education of the sons of the family, she prevented their sisters from learning French and dancing. It is but just to say that the useful accomplishments of cooking, sewing, and the care of a household, were thoroughly taught by her to her two daughters. The father, ISAAC, appears to have been of a different mould, and to him, no doubt, the chief intellectual characteristics of the family are due. His position obliged him to be often absent from Hanover, with his regiment, but his hand appears to have been always present, smoothing over difficulties, and encouraging his sons to such learning and improvement as was to be had.  His health was seriously injured by the exposures of the campaigns, and he was left, after the Seven Years' War, with a broken constitution.  After his final return home, in 1760, his daughter gives this record of him--      \"Copying music employed every vacant moment, even sometimes     throughout half the night. . . . With my brother [DIETRICH]--now a     little engaging creature of between four and five years old--he was     very much pleased, and [on the first evening of his arrival at home]     before he went to rest, the Adempken (a little violin) was taken     from the shelf and newly strung, and the daily lessons immediately     commenced. . . . I do not recollect that he ever desired any other     society than what he had opportunities of enjoying in many of the     parties where he was introduced by his profession, though far from     being of a morose disposition; he would frequently encourage my     mother in keeping up a social intercourse among a few acquaintances,     whilst his afternoon hours generally were taken up in giving lessons     to some scholars at home, who gladly saved him the troublesome     exertion of walking. . . . He also found great pleasure in seeing     DIETRICH'S improvement, who, young as he was, and of the most lively     temper imaginable, was always ready to receive his lessons, leaving     his little companions with the greatest cheerfulness to go to his     father, who was so pleased with his performances that he made him     play a solo on the Adempken in RAKE'S concert, being placed on a     table before a crowded company, for which he was very much applauded     and caressed, particularly by an English lady, who put a gold coin     in his little pocket.      \"It was not long before my father had as many scholars as he could     find time to attend. And when they assembled at my father's to make     little concerts, I was frequently called to join the second violin     in an overture, for my father found pleasure in giving me sometimes     a lesson before the instruments were laid by, after practising with     DIETRICH, for I never was missing at those hours, sitting in a     corner with my knitting and listening all the while.\"  Here, as in all her writing, CAROLINA is simple, true, direct to awkwardness, and unconsciously pathetic even in joy.  The family of ISAAC and ANNA HERSCHEL consisted of ten children. Six of these lived to adult age. They were:      1. SOPHIA ELIZABETH; born 1733, married GRIESBACH, a musician in the        Guard, by whom she had children. Five of her sons were afterwards        musicians at the court, in England, where they obtained places        through the influence of WILLIAM.      2. HENRY ANTON JACOB; born 1734, November 20.      4. FREDERIC WILLIAM (the astronomer) born 1738, November 15.      6. JOHN ALEXANDER; born 1745, November 13.      8. CAROLINA LUCRETIA; born 1750, March 16.      10. DIETRICH; born 1755, September 13.  Of this family group, the important figures to us are WILLIAM, ALEXANDER, and CAROLINA.  JACOB was organist at the Garrison Church of Hanover in 1753, a member of the Guards' band in 1755, and first violin in the Hanover Court Orchestra in 1759. Afterwards he joined his brother WILLIAM in Bath, but again returned to Hanover. In 1771 he published in Amsterdam his Opus I., a set of six quartettes, and later, in London, he published two symphonies and six trios. He appears to have been a clever musician, and his letters to his younger brother WILLIAM are full of discussion on points of musical composition, etc. He died in 1792.  DIETRICH, the youngest brother, shared in the musical abilities of his family, and when only fifteen years old was so far advanced as to be able to supply his brother JACOB'S place in the Court Orchestra, and to give his lessons to private pupils. There is no one of the family, except the eldest daughter, whom we do not know to have possessed marked ability in music, and this taste descended truly for four generations. In the letters of Chevalier BUNSEN,[2] he describes meeting, in 1847, the eldest granddaughter of WILLIAM HERSCHEL, who, he says, \"is a musical genius.\"  Three members of the family, WILLIAM, ALEXANDER, and CAROLINA, formed a group which was inseparable for many years, and while the progress of the lives of ALEXANDER and CAROLINA was determined by the energy and efforts of WILLIAM, these two lent him an aid without which his career would have been strangely different. It is necessary to understand a little better the early life of all three.  The sons of the HERSCHEL family all attended the garrison school in Hanover until they were about fourteen years old. They were taught the ordinary rudiments of knowledge--to read, to write, to cipher--and a knowledge of French and English was added. WILLIAM especially distinguished himself in his studies, learning French very rapidly, and studying Latin and arithmetic with his master out of hours. The household life seems to have been active, harmonious, and intelligent, especially during the presence of the father, who took a great delight in the rapid progress of all his sons in music, and who encouraged them with his companionship in their studies and in their reading on all intellectual subjects.  From the _Memoir_ of CAROLINA, on which we must depend for our knowledge of this early life, we take the following paragraph:      \"My brothers were often introduced as solo performers and assistants     in the orchestra of the court, and I remember that I was frequently     prevented from going to sleep by the lively criticism on music on     coming from a concert, or by conversations on philosophical subjects,     which lasted frequently till morning, in which my father was a     lively partaker and assistant of my brother WILLIAM, by contriving     self-made instruments. . . . Often I would keep myself awake that     I might listen to their animating remarks, for it made _me so happy_     to see _them so happy_. But generally their conversation would     branch out on philosophical subjects, when my brother WILLIAM and my     father often argued with such warmth that my mother's interference     became necessary, when the names LEIBNITZ, NEWTON, and EULER     sounded rather too loud for the repose of her little ones, who     ought to be in school by seven in the morning. But it seems that     on the brothers retiring to their own room, where they shared     the same bed, my brother WILLIAM had still a great deal to say; and     frequently it happened that when he stopped for an assent or reply,     he found his hearer was gone to sleep, and I suppose it was not till     then that he bethought himself to do the same.      \"The recollection of these happy scenes confirms me in the belief,     that had my brother WILLIAM not then been interrupted in his     philosophical pursuits, we should have had much earlier proofs of     his inventive genius. My father was a great admirer of astronomy,     and had some knowledge of that science; for I remember his taking     me, on a clear frosty night, into the street, to make me acquainted     with several of the most beautiful constellations, after we had been     gazing at a comet which was then visible. And I well remember with     what delight he used to assist my brother WILLIAM in his various     contrivances in the pursuit of his philosophical studies, among     which was a neatly turned 4-inch globe, upon which the equator and     ecliptic were engraved by my brother.\"  The mechanical genius was not confined to WILLIAM, for we read that ALEXANDER used often to \"sit by us and amuse us and himself by making all sorts of things out of pasteboard, or contriving how to make a twelve-hour cuckoo clock go a week.\" This ability of ALEXANDER'S was turned later to the best account when he became his brother WILLIAM'S right hand in the manufacture of reflectors, eye-pieces, and stands in England. His abilities were great, and a purpose which might otherwise have been lacking was supplied through the younger brother's ardor in all that he undertook.  His musical talent was remarkable; he played \"divinely\" on the violoncello. He returned to Hanover in 1816, where he lived in comfortable independence, through the never-failing generosity of his brother, until his death in 1821. A notice of him in a Bristol paper says: \"Died, March 15, 1821, at Hanover, ALEXANDER HERSCHEL, Esqr., well known to the public of Bath and Bristol as a performer and elegant musician; and who for forty-seven years was the admiration of the frequenters of concerts and theatres of both those cities as principal violoncello.
