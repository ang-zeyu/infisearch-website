No specimen was taken.  =_Peromyscus maniculatus rufinus_= (Merriam).--The 36 specimens of the Deer Mouse (59921-59956) are from seven localities (3, 4, 6, 10, 12, 14, and 15). The mice vary considerably in color; most of them are like mice of the highlands of Colorado and unlike the paler mice inhabiting the lower areas immediately to the west of the Grand Mesa. Young individuals trapped on June 20, 21, and 22 and judged to range from a month through two months in age, and females containing embryos, attest to a somewhat protracted breeding season on the Grand Mesa.  =_Neotoma cinerea arizonae_= Merriam.--Two immature Bushy-tailed Wood Rats (60000-60001) were obtained at locality 3 on July 3.  =_Clethrionomys gapperi galei_= (Merriam).--The 22 specimens (60005-60025, 70133) of Gapper's Red-backed Vole were taken at localities 6, 7, and 10, and are clearly referable to _C. g. galei_, rather than to _Clethrionomys gapperi gauti_ to the south, on the basis of generally dark dorsal pelage, indistinctly bordered broad dorsal stripe, and cranial features. _C. g. gauti_ was described by Cockrum and Fitch (1952, Univ. Kansas Publ., Mus. Nat. Hist., 5:289) on the basis of 14 specimens from southern Colorado and northern New Mexico. Twenty-one additional specimens from five miles south and one mile west of Cucharas Camps, Huerfano County, were obtained from the seventh to the fourteenth of July by the field party led by Tordoff after the party left the Grand Mesa. These specimens substantiate the subspecific distinctness of _C. g. gauti_ in that they agree in external and in cranial appearance with the description of typical _C. g. gauti_, and are distinct in appearance from specimens of _C. g. galei_ from the Grand Mesa and from other localities in northern Colorado. The six specimens from two localities in Colorado available to Cockrum and Fitch exhibited evidence of intergradation at one locality, and atypical smallness at the other locality. A specimen (70134) taken on June 26, 1956, by Phillip M. Youngman on the Black Mesa, nine miles WNW of Sapinero, 9500 ft., Gunnison County, Colorado, is almost identical in color to the two specimens from Saguache County regarded by Cockrum and Fitch as intergrades between _C. g. galei_ and _C. g. gauti_, but in small size of auditory bullae and narrowness of braincase resembles _C. g. galei_, to which it seems best referred. The specimens from the Grand Mesa extend the known range of _C. g. galei_ approximately 50 miles westward in central Colorado from Gothic. Three females were pregnant; two trapped on June 17 and June 25 contained 6 embryos each, and one trapped on June 25 contained 5 embryos. Four of the females taken in Huerfano County were pregnant; one contained 3 embryos, two contained 5 embryos, and one contained 7 embryos. Immature individuals are present in the sample from Huerfano County also.  =_Phenacomys intermedius intermedius_= Merriam.--Three Heather Voles (60048, 60049, 70135) were trapped at localities 6, 7, and 10. All were adult females; one, taken on June 25 at locality 6, contained seven embryos five millimeters in length, and one, taken on July 2 at locality 7, contained seven embryos nine millimeters in length. These specimens extend the known range of the species approximately 55 miles west from Gothic (Pruitt, Jour. Mamm., 35:450, 1954).  =_Microtus longicaudus mordax_= (Merriam).--Ten Long-tailed Voles (60070-60079) represent localities 3, 6, 12, 13, 14, and 15.  =_Microtus montanus fusus_= Hall.--Ten Montane Voles (60060-60068, 70145) represent localities 3, 6, 7, and 15.  =_Ondatra zibethicus osoyoosensis_= (Lord).--Muskrats were seen daily from June 17 to June 23 in a lake at locality 13. No specimen was obtained.  =_Zapus princeps princeps_= J. A. Allen.--Nineteen Western Jumping Mice (60109-60126, 60137) were trapped at localities 6, 10, 12, 14, and 15.  =_Erethizon dorsatum epixanthum_= Brandt.--A Porcupine skull was seen in the nest of a wood rat by John M. Legler at locality 3 on July 2. On June 20 a porcupine was seen at locality 12. No specimen was obtained.  =_Mustela frenata nevadensis_= Hall.--Seven Long-tailed Weasels (60138-60143, 70152) were taken at localities 1, 4, 7, 8, 13, and 14. Four are males and three are females. Some of these were attracted by \"squeaking\" noises and then shot.  =_Taxidea taxus taxus_= (Schreber).--One adult male Badger (60144) was found dead; the skull and baculum were saved. The subspecific identification is on geographic grounds, and is tentative. In this area _T. t. taxus_ and _T. t. fippsi_ may intergrade.  =_Mephitis mephitis estor_= Merriam.--One Striped Skunk (60145) of unknown sex was found dead in the cellar of a cabin at locality 10.  =_Odocoileus hemionus hemionus_= (Rafinesque).--Mule Deer were observed at locality 15; no specimen was obtained.   DISCUSSION  The species here reported from the Grand Mesa may be placed according to their geographic ranges and their restriction to certain habitats in two groups:  BOREAL.--Each of the 12 species listed below is of northern distribution, is dependent, at the latitude of Colorado, upon the habitat provided by areas of high altitudes, and is near its southern zonal limit on the Grand Mesa. The 12 species are: _Sorex cinereus_, _Sorex palustris_, _Sorex vagrans_, _Ochotona princeps_, _Lepus americanus_, _Marmota flaviventris_, _Spermophilus lateralis_, _Clethrionomys gapperi_, _Phenacomys intermedius_, _Microtus longicaudus_, _Microtus montanus_, and _Zapus princeps_. _Thomomys talpoides_ may be considered in this category also, although it is less restricted in range and habitat than most of the other species listed as boreal. These thirteen species make up almost half of the twenty-seven species known from the Grand Mesa.  WIDE-SPREAD.--Species in this category are those that are widely distributed in the western United States and that occur in Colorado in both the mountains and the lower more arid intermontane areas. Some of these species are differentiated into subspecies, one of which inhabits the mountains and another the lowlands. Wide-spread species that do not have subspecies in the lowlands different than the subspecies in the mountains or that are represented by too little material from the Grand Mesa to be evaluated critically are _Myotis evotis_, _Myotis volans_, _Spermophilus variegatus_, _Eutamias quadrivittatus_, _Castor canadensis_, _Ondatra zibethicus_, _Erethizon dorsatum_, _Mustela frenata_, _Taxidea taxus_, _Mephitis mephitis_, and _Odocoileus hemionus_. Three other wide-spread species are differentiated into lowland and highland subspecies; two of these species, _Eutamias minimus_ and _Peromyscus maniculatus_, are represented on the Grand Mesa by the darker subspecies of the mountains. The third species, _Neotoma cinerea_, is represented by two individuals from below the actual rim of the mesa; they are intergrades between the lowland and highland subspecies.  Species of southern distribution, that are dependent at the latitude of Colorado upon the habitat provided by areas of lower altitudes, and that are here in Colorado near their northern limit comprise a third category that is not represented in the list of mammals from the Grand Mesa although such characteristic species as _Ammospermophilus leucurus_, _Perognathus apache_, and _Dipodomys ordii_ occur as near as Grand Junction.  Approximately 55 per cent of the species of the mammalian fauna are boreal; no species of Sonoran affinities finds haven on the Grand Mesa.

The fat face of the cook was dead white. Bill Sanderson, looking like a slim, blond ballet dancer and muscled like an apache expert, had him in one hand and was stuffing the latest batch of whole wheat biscuits down his throat. Bill's sister, Jenny, was giggling excitedly and holding more biscuits.  The deckhands and Grundy, the mate, were almost at the door, and I had just time enough to slam it shut and lock it in their faces. I meant to enjoy seeing the cook taken down without any interruption.  Sam let out a final yell, and Bullard broke free, making a mess of it without weight. He was sputtering out bits of the biscuit. Hal Lomax reached out a big hand, stained with the chemicals that had been his life's work, and pushed the cook back.  And suddenly fat little Bullard switched from quaking fear to a blind rage. The last of the biscuit sailed from his mouth and he spat at Hal. \"You damned hi-faluting black devil. You--_you_ sneering at my cooking. I'm a white man, I am--I don't have to work for no black ni....\"         *       *       *       *       *  I reached him first, though even Sam started for him then. You can deliver a good blow in free-fall, if you know how. His teeth against my knuckles stopped my leap, and the back of his head bounced off the wall. He was unconscious as he drifted by us, moving upwards. My knuckles stung, but it had been worth it. Anyhow, Jenny's look more than paid for the trouble.  The door shattered then, and the big hulk of Mate Grundy tumbled in, with the two deckhands and the pair from the engine room behind him. Sam let out a yell that sounded like protest, and they headed for us--just as gravity came on.  I pulled myself off the floor and out from under Bullard to see the stout, oldish figure of Captain Muller standing in the doorway, with Engineer Wilcox slouched easily beside him, looking like the typical natty space officer you see on television. Both held gas guns.  \"All right, break it up!\" Muller ordered. \"You men get back to your work. And you, Dr. Pietro--my contract calls for me to deliver you to Saturn's moon, but it doesn't forbid me to haul you the rest of the way in irons. I won't have this aboard my ship!\"  Pietro nodded, his little gray goatee bobbing, his lean body coming upright smoothly. \"Quite right, Captain. Nor does it forbid me to let you and your men spend the sixteen months on the moon--where _I_ command--in irons. Why don't you ask Sam what happened before you make a complete fool of yourself, Captain Muller?\"  Sam gulped and looked at the crew, but apparently Pietro was right; the little guy had been completely disgusted by Bullard. He shrugged apologetically. \"Bullard insulted Dr. Lomax, sir. I yelled for someone to help me get him out of here, and I guess everybody got all mixed up when gravity went off, and Bullard cracked his head on the floor. Just a misunderstanding, sir.\"  Muller stood there, glowering at the cut on my knuckles, and I could feel him aching for a good excuse to make his threat a reality. But finally, he grunted and swung on his heel, ordering the crew with him. Grundy threw us a final grimace and skulked off behind him. Finally there was only Wilcox, who grinned, shrugged, and shut the door quietly behind him. And we were left with the mess free-fall had made of the place.  I spotted Jenny heading across the room, carefully not seeing the fatuous glances Pietro was throwing her way, and I swung in behind. She nodded back at me, but headed straight for Lomax, with an odd look on her face. When she reached him, her voice was low and businesslike.  \"Hal, what did those samples of Hendrix's show up?\"  Hendrix was the Farmer, in charge of the hydroponics that turned the carbon dioxide we breathed out back to oxygen, and also gave us a bit of fresh vegetables now and then. Technically, he was a crewman, just as I was a scientist; but actually, he felt more like one of us.  Lomax looked surprised. \"What samples, Jenny? I haven't seen Hendrix for two weeks.\"  \"You--\" She stopped, bit her lip, and frowned. She swung on me. \"Paul, have you seen him?\"  I shook my head. \"Not since last night. He was asking Eve and Walt to wake him up early, then.\"  \"That's funny. He was worried about the plants yesterday and wanted Hal to test the water and chemical fertilizer. I looked for him this morning, but when he didn't show up, I thought he was with you, Hal. And--the plants are dying!\"  \"All of them?\" The half smile wiped off Hal's face, and I could feel my stomach hit my insteps. When anything happens to the plants in a ship, it isn't funny.  She shook her head again. \"No--about a quarter of them. I was coming for help when the fight started. They're all bleached out. And it looks like--like chromazone!\"  That really hit me. They developed the stuff to fight off fungus on Venus, where one part in a billion did the trick. But it was tricky stuff; one part in ten-million would destroy the chlorophyll in plants in about twenty hours, or the hemoglobin in blood in about fifteen minutes. It was practically a universal poison.  Hal started for the door, then stopped. He glanced around the room, turned back to me, and suddenly let out a healthy bellow of seeming amusement. Jenny's laugh was right in harmony. I caught the drift, and tried to look as if we were up to some monkey business as we slipped out of the room. Nobody seemed suspicious.  Then we made a dash for hydroponics, toward the rear of the ship. We scrambled into the big chamber together, and stopped. Everything looked normal among the rows of plant-filled tanks, pipes and equipment. Jenny led us down one of the rows and around a bend.  The plants in the rear quarter weren't sick--they were dead. They were bleached to a pale yellow, like boiled grass, and limp. Nothing would save them now.  \"I'm a biologist, not a botanist--\" Jenny began.  Hal grunted sickly. \"Yeah. And I'm not a life hormone expert. But there's one test we can try.\"  He picked up a pair of rubber gloves from a rack, and pulled off some wilted stalks. From one of the healthy tanks, he took green leaves. He mashed the two kinds together on the edge of a bench and watched. \"If it's chromazone, they've developed an enzyme by now that should eat the color out of those others.\"         *       *       *       *       *  In about ten seconds, I noticed the change. The green began to bleach before my eyes.  Jenny made a sick sound in her throat and stared at the rows of healthy plants. \"I checked the valves, and this sick section is isolated. But--if chromazone got into the chemicals.... Better get your spectroanalyzer out, Hal, while I get Captain Muller. Paul, be a dear and find Hendrix, will you?\"  I shook my head, and went further down the rows. \"No need, Jenny,\" I called back. I pointed to the shoe I'd seen sticking out from the edge of one of the tanks. There was a leg attached.  I reached for it, but Lomax shoved me back. \"Don't--the enzymes in the corpse are worse than the poison, Paul. Hands off.\" He reached down with the gloves and heaved. It was Hendrix, all right--a corpse with a face and hands as white as human flesh could ever get. Even the lips were bleached out.  Jenny moaned. \"The fool! The stupid fool. He _knew_ it was dangerous without gloves; he suspected chromazone, even though none's supposed to be on board. And I warned him . . .\"  \"Not against this, you didn't,\" I told her. I dropped to my knees and took another pair of gloves. Hendrix's head rolled under my grasp. The skull was smashed over the left eye, as if someone had taken a sideswipe at Hendrix with a hammer. No fall had produced that. \"You should have warned him about his friends. Must have been killed, then dumped in there.\"  \"Murder!\" Hal bit the word out in disgust. \"You're right, Paul. Not too stupid a way to dispose of the body, either--in another couple of hours, he'd have started dissolving in that stuff, and we'd never have guessed it was murder. That means this poisoning of the plants wasn't an accident. Somebody poisoned the water, then got worried when there wasn't a report on the plants; must have been someone who thought it worked faster on plants than it does. So he came to investigate, and Hendrix caught him fooling around. So he got killed.\"  \"But who?\" Jenny asked.  I shrugged sickly. \"Somebody crazy enough--or desperate enough to turn back that he'll risk our air and commit murder. You'd better go after the captain while Hal gets his test equipment. I'll keep watch here.\"  It didn't feel good in hydroponics after they left. I looked at those dead plants, trying to figure whether there were enough left to keep us going. I studied Hendrix's body, trying to tell myself the murderer had no reason to come back and try to get me.  I reached for a cigarette, and then put the pack back. The air felt almost as close as the back of my neck felt tense and unprotected. And telling myself it was all imagination didn't help--not with what was in that chamber to keep me company.   II  Muller's face was like an iceberg when he came down--but only after he saw Hendrix. Before then I'd caught the fat moon-calf expression on his face, and I'd heard Jenny giggling. Damn it, they'd taken enough time. Hal was already back, fussing over things with the hunk of tin and lenses he treated like a newborn baby.  Doc Napier came in behind them, but separately. I saw him glance at them and look sick. Then both Muller and Napier began concentrating on business. Napier bent his nervous, bony figure over the corpse, and stood up almost at once. \"Murder all right.\"  \"So I guessed, Dr. Napier,\" Muller growled heavily at him. \"Wrap him up and put him between hulls to freeze. We'll bury him when we land. Tremaine, give a hand with it, will you?\"  \"I'm not a laborer, Captain Muller!\" Napier protested. I started to tell him where he could get off, too.  But Jenny shook her head at us. \"Please. Can't you see Captain Muller is trying to keep too"]]]
