George felt the flush of his face, and he could not meet her eyes. He heard her walk a few steps away.  \"Good-by, George,\" she said.  He jumped up quickly. \"That wasn't fair.\"  \"No,\" she said slowly, \"but it proved the value of things.\"  \"It wasn't fair,\" George repeated. \"And it didn't prove anything.\"  \"I think it did,\" she said, moving away.  \"No, listen, Gistla,\" he said. \"You can't judge anything by what I did or said. We are different, in a physical sense, but that doesn't really matter. If a golden-haired girl materializes in front of my eyes, you can't blame me for what my emotions did. It's still you I love. Not the color of your skin or the shape of your mouth. But you and what you or I or anybody else looks like isn't important!\"  He followed her and caught her arm. She turned to face him. \"You can say that,\" she said. \"Your words tell me that and your eyes, but I know it isn't true.\"  The embarrassment was still inside him, but the way she denied him made him want her more than ever. He held to her arm and then he said, \"Gistla, could you change me? I mean, so that other people, even I, would see me as they see you--as a Venusian?\"  She stood very still, staring at him.  \"Could you?\" he asked.  \"Yes.\"  \"Then do it, Gistla. I'll prove to you that nothing is important but you and me. I'll be a Venusian, like you are. I'll go back to my family as a Venusian and I'll take you with me. I'll prove that neither they nor anybody else makes any difference in how I love you!\"  Gistla watched him solemnly. Finally she said, \"Would you really do that?\"  \"Yes,\" he said quickly, \"Yes.\"  \"I love you, George,\" she said in her deep round voice.  He lifted his hands to touch her face and he found that his skin had turned to pale green. He touched his own face, and he knew that if he looked into a mirror he would see a round smooth head with large lidless eyes.  \"Is that what you wanted?\" she asked.  \"Yes,\" he said stubbornly. \"That's what I wanted.\" He stood there for a long time, trying to become used to it, fighting the fear that ran through him every time he looked at his hands or touched his head. Finally he said, quietly, \"Let's go meet my family.\"         *       *       *       *       *  As they drew near the house, he knew his family was still in the patio. He could hear the voices of his mother and father and the high, piercing laughter of his sister.  \"And, my God,\" he heard his sister say, \"did you see the way those horrible eyes looked at you? What ever gets into George?\"  \"Dear, dear, dear,\" he heard his mother say.  Gistla was looking at him. \"You do not have to do this.\"  \"Yes,\" he said, feeling his heart jump. \"I do.\"  He took her hand and they walked to the gate of the patio. He stood there, feeling Gistla's hand tighten about his own. And as he said, \"Hello, everybody,\" he felt his breath shorten as though he had suddenly gotten stage fright.  He saw his father turn around. \"What's this?\" Mr. Kenington said, frowning.  \"Hello, Father,\" George said.  \"_Father_,\" Mr. Kenington repeated. \"What are you doing in this patio?\"  \"I brought Gistla back.\"  \"So I see,\" said Mr. Kenington, his eyes narrow as he looked at Gistla. \"Where's George?\"  \"I'm George.\"  \"I'm not in the mood for joking with Venusians,\" his father snapped. \"What made you think you could come in here like this?\"  Gistla's hand tightened again. \"Try to understand,\" George said. \"Gistla--\"  \"What's going on?\" his sister interrupted.  \"Gistla, or whatever her name is,\" Mr. Kenington said, \"has brought a friend of hers, another Venusian.\" He said the word, Venusian, as though it were a curse or a filthy word.  \"My God,\" said his sister, squinting at them.  Mrs. Kenington leaned over in her chair, peering. \"Tell them not to come into the patio, Harry,\" she said to her husband.  \"Listen, Father,\" George said, feeling the panic begin. \"Gistla changed my appearance, so that I seem to look like a Venusian. I came here to tell you that it doesn't make any difference what I look like, whether I look like a Venusian or a leaf on a vine or anything else. I still love her, and it doesn't make any difference.\" He heard his voice rising and becoming louder.  \"My God,\" said his sister, giggling. \"More black magic. Can you make music?\" she asked George.  \"Harry,\" his mother said. \"They frighten me. Can't you make them keep off the patio?\"  \"Mother--\" George began.  \"Now see here,\" Mr. Kenington growled. \"You know we don't allow Venusians around here. I'd advise you to get out of here. Quick!\"  \"Why does he keep calling you father and mother?\" his sister asked. \"Isn't that queer, how he keeps doing that? Make some music,\" she said to George.  George could see the hatred in his father's eyes and in his mother's. And behind his sister's sarcastic smile, he could see the hatred there, too. He felt himself getting more tense, and the panic raced through him.  \"Listen,\" he shouted. \"I'm George, don't you understand? George!\"  \"I don't want to tell you again,\" his father said, his face very red. \"I don't know what your little game is, but it isn't coming off, and so I'll tell you just this one time. You get the hell off this property, or I'll ...\"  \"Listen,\" George yelled. \"I'm _GEORGE_! Don't you understand?\"  His father's lips thinned to a white line, and he began shouting for Joe Finch, the gardener.  George knew what he should have done then, he should have taken Gistla and gone. He should have walked with her, hand in hand, down the road and away from there. But instead, the panic made his heart pound and he saw the hatred all around him. He couldn't help it when he shouted to her, \"Gistla! For God's sake, change me back! Right now! Gistla!\"  He stood there, breathing hard, his muscles knotted like steel, while she stared at him, looking into his eyes.  Suddenly, he heard his father gasp and say, \"_George!_\"  He looked at his hands and they were white and he felt of his face and it was his own. He saw his sister's hand against her mouth, and his father stared at him with unbelieving eyes. His mother had gotten up and was coming over to him, her eyes blinking. \"George,\" she said, \"what did they do to you?\" She patted his shoulder, her hands fluttering like bird wings.  He turned back to Gistla and she was gone. Beyond the gate now, he knew, and walking slowly, alone, down the road. Only this time he would not go after her. He couldn't. And as he stood there, feeling his mother's hand patting his shoulder, hearing his sister say, \"My God,\" seeing his father shake his head slowly, he felt very young and at the same time, very old, and he wanted to cry.

Built-in kinesthetics told the watchbird where it was, and held it in a long search curve. Its eyes and ears operated as one unit, searching, seeking.  And then something happened! The watchbird's electronically fast reflexes picked up the edge of a sensation. A correlation center tested it, matching it with electrical and chemical data in its memory files. A relay tripped.  Down the watchbird spiraled, coming in on the increasingly strong sensation. It _smelled_ the outpouring of certain glands, _tasted_ a deviant brain wave.  Fully alerted and armed, it spun and banked in the bright morning sunlight.  Dinelli was so intent he didn't see the watchbird coming. He had his gun poised, and his eyes pleaded with the big grocer.  \"Don't come no closer.\"  \"You lousy little punk,\" the grocer said, and took another step forward. \"Rob me? I'll break every bone in your puny body.\"  The grocer, too stupid or too courageous to understand the threat of the gun, advanced on the little thief.  \"All right,\" Dinelli said, in a thorough state of panic. \"All right, sucker, take--\"  A bolt of electricity knocked him on his back. The gun went off, smashing a breakfast food display.  \"What in hell?\" the grocer asked, staring at the stunned thief. And then he saw a flash of silver wings. \"Well, I'm really damned. Those watchbirds work!\"  He stared until the wings disappeared in the sky. Then he telephoned the police.  The watchbird returned to his search curve. His thinking center correlated the new facts he had learned about murder. Several of these he hadn't known before.  This new information was simultaneously flashed to all the other watchbirds and their information was flashed back to him.  New information, methods, definitions were constantly passing between them.         *       *       *       *       *  Now that the watchbirds were rolling off the assembly line in a steady stream, Gelsen allowed himself to relax. A loud contented hum filled his plant. Orders were being filled on time, with top priorities given to the biggest cities in his area, and working down to the smallest towns.  \"All smooth, Chief,\" Macintyre said, coming in the door. He had just completed a routine inspection.  \"Fine. Have a seat.\"  The big engineer sat down and lighted a cigarette.  \"We've been working on this for some time,\" Gelsen said, when he couldn't think of anything else.  \"We sure have,\" Macintyre agreed. He leaned back and inhaled deeply. He had been one of the consulting engineers on the original watchbird. That was six years back. He had been working for Gelsen ever since, and the men had become good friends.  \"The thing I wanted to ask you was this--\" Gelsen paused. He couldn't think how to phrase what he wanted. Instead he asked, \"What do you think of the watchbirds, Mac?\"  \"Who, me?\" The engineer grinned nervously. He had been eating, drinking and sleeping watchbird ever since its inception. He had never found it necessary to have an attitude. \"Why, I think it's great.\"  \"I don't mean that,\" Gelsen said. He realized that what he wanted was to have someone understand his point of view. \"I mean do you figure there might be some danger in machine thinking?\"  \"I don't think so, Chief. Why do you ask?\"  \"Look, I'm no scientist or engineer. I've just handled cost and production and let you boys worry about how. But as a layman, watchbird is starting to frighten me.\"  \"No reason for that.\"  \"I don't like the idea of the learning circuits.\"  \"But why not?\" Then Macintyre grinned again. \"I know. You're like a lot of people, Chief--afraid your machines are going to wake up and say, 'What are we doing here? Let's go out and rule the world.' Is that it?\"  \"Maybe something like that,\" Gelsen admitted.  \"No chance of it,\" Macintyre said. \"The watchbirds are complex, I'll admit, but an M.I.T. calculator is a whole lot more complex. And it hasn't got consciousness.\"  \"No. But the watchbirds can _learn_.\"  \"Sure. So can all the new calculators. Do you think they'll team up with the watchbirds?\"         *       *       *       *       *  Gelsen felt annoyed at Macintyre, and even more annoyed at himself for being ridiculous. \"It's a fact that the watchbirds can put their learning into action. No one is monitoring them.\"  \"So that's the trouble,\" Macintyre said.  \"I've been thinking of getting out of watchbird.\" Gelsen hadn't realized it until that moment.  \"Look, Chief,\" Macintyre said. \"Will you take an engineer's word on this?\"  \"Let's hear it.\"  \"The watchbirds are no more dangerous than an automobile, an IBM calculator or a thermometer. They have no more consciousness or volition than those things. The watchbirds are built to respond to certain stimuli, and to carry out certain operations when they receive that stimuli.\"  \"And the learning circuits?\"  \"You have to have those,\" Macintyre said patiently, as though explaining the whole thing to a ten-year-old. \"The purpose of the watchbird is to frustrate all murder-attempts, right? Well, only certain murderers give out these stimuli. In order to stop all of them, the watchbird has to search out new definitions of murder and correlate them with what it already knows.\"  \"I think it's inhuman,\" Gelsen said.  \"That's the best thing about it. The watchbirds are unemotional. Their reasoning is non-anthropomorphic. You can't bribe them or drug them. You shouldn't fear them, either.\"  The intercom on Gelsen's desk buzzed. He ignored it.  \"I know all this,\" Gelsen said. \"But, still, sometimes I feel like the man who invented dynamite. He thought it would only be used for blowing up tree stumps.\"  \"_You_ didn't invent watchbird.\"  \"I still feel morally responsible because I manufacture them.\"  The intercom buzzed again, and Gelsen irritably punched a button.  \"The reports are in on the first week of watchbird operation,\" his secretary told him.  \"How do they look?\"  \"Wonderful, sir.\"  \"Send them in in fifteen minutes.\" Gelsen switched the intercom off and turned back to Macintyre, who was cleaning his fingernails with a wooden match. \"Don't you think that this represents a trend in human thinking? The mechanical god? The electronic father?\"  \"Chief,\" Macintyre said, \"I think you should study watchbird more closely. Do you know what's built into the circuits?\"  \"Only generally.\"  \"First, there is a purpose. Which is to stop living organisms from committing murder. Two, murder may be defined as an act of violence, consisting of breaking, mangling, maltreating or otherwise stopping the functions of a living organism by a living organism. Three, most murderers are detectable by certain chemical and electrical changes.\"  Macintyre paused to light another cigarette. \"Those conditions take care of the routine functions. Then, for the learning circuits, there are two more conditions. Four, there are some living organisms who commit murder without the signs mentioned in three. Five, these can be detected by data applicable to condition two.\"  \"I see,\" Gelsen said.  \"You realize how foolproof it is?\"  \"I suppose so.\" Gelsen hesitated a moment. \"I guess that's all.\"  \"Right,\" the engineer said, and left.  Gelsen thought for a few moments. There _couldn't_ be anything wrong with the watchbirds.  \"Send in the reports,\" he said into the intercom.         *       *       *       *       *  High above the lighted buildings of the city, the watchbird soared. It was dark, but in the distance the watchbird could see another, and another beyond that. For this was a large city.  To prevent murder ...  There was more to watch for now. New information had crossed the invisible network that connected all watchbirds. New data, new ways of detecting the violence of murder.  There! The edge of a sensation! Two watchbirds dipped simultaneously. One had received the scent a fraction of a second before the other. He continued down while the other resumed monitoring.  _Condition four, there are some living organisms who commit murder without the signs mentioned in condition three._  Through his new information, the watchbird knew by extrapolation that this organism was bent on murder, even though the characteristic chemical and electrical smells were absent.  The watchbird, all senses acute, closed in on the organism. He found what he wanted, and dived.  Roger Greco leaned against a building, his hands in his pockets. In his left hand was the cool butt of a .45. Greco waited patiently.  He wasn't thinking of anything in particular, just relaxing against a building, waiting for a man. Greco didn't know why the man was to be killed. He didn't care. Greco's lack of curiosity was part of his value. The other part was his skill.  One bullet, neatly placed in the head of a man he didn't know. It didn't excite him or sicken him. It was a job, just like anything else. You killed a man. So?  As Greco's victim stepped out of a building, Greco lifted the .45 out of his pocket. He released the safety and braced the gun with his right hand. He still wasn't thinking of anything as he took aim ...  And was knocked off his feet.  Greco thought he had been shot. He struggled up again, looked around, and sighted foggily on his victim.  Again he was knocked down.  This time he lay on the ground, trying to draw a bead. He never thought of stopping, for Greco was a craftsman.  With the next blow, everything went black. Permanently, because the watchbird's duty was to protect the object of violence--_at whatever cost to the murderer_.  The victim walked to his car. He hadn't noticed anything unusual. Everything had happened in silence.         *       *       *       *       *  Gelsen was feeling pretty good. The watchbirds had been operating perfectly. Crimes of violence had been cut in half, and cut again. Dark alleys were no longer mouths of horror. Parks and playgrounds were not places to shun after dusk.  Of course, there were still robberies. Petty thievery flourished, and embezzlement, larceny, forgery and a hundred other crimes.  [Illustration] "]]]
