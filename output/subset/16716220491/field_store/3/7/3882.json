The brush mouse commonly associates with the pack rat.    11. Laelapid mites have been found on specimens of _P. b.       attwateri_.    12. Larval ixodid ticks were found on specimens of _P. b.       cansensis_.    13. Acorns seem to be the chief food of the brush mouse; insects       and seeds are also commonly eaten.    14. The brush mouse is adapted for climbing and probably for a       partly subterranean life.    15. _P. b. attwateri_ breeds in winter, as well as in other parts       of the year.    16. _P. b. cansensis_ is known to breed in early April.    17. The highest number of embryos obtained from a brush mouse in       Kansas is five.   Acknowledgments       I am indebted to Prof. E. Raymond Hall and to Mr. J.
