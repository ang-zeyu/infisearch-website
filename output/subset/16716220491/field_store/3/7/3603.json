He seemed to be enjoying their discomfiture, and absolutely confident of his own safety.  \"There's got to be some way of getting him,\" Phil mused; and he mused almost absent-mindedly, for he was gazing at the photograph of the girl. For many minutes he looked at it, and then put it silently into his pocket.  Five o'clock in the evening of that same day came the news of another safe disappearance. Phil got his tip over the phone, and in fifteen minutes was at the scene. It was too much like the others to go into detail about; a six-foot portable safe had suddenly disappeared right in front of the eyes of the office staff of The Epicure, a huge restaurant and cafeteria that fed five thousand people three times a day. In its place stood a ragged, rusty old Ford coupe body. He went away from there, shaking his head.  Then suddenly in the midst of his dinner, he jumped up, and ran. An idea had leaped into his head.  \"Right after one of these things pops is the time to take a peek at Tony,\" he said to himself, and immediately he was on the way.         *       *       *       *       *  But how to get his peep was not so easy a problem. When he alighted from his cab a block away from Tony's building, he was hesitant about approaching it. Tony knew him, and might see him first. Phil circled the brick building, keeping under cover or far enough away; all around it was a belt of thirty feet of lawn between the building and the sidewalk. Ought he have called the police and given them his idea? Or should he wait till darkness and see what he could do alone?  Then suddenly he saw her. Across the street, standing in the shelter of a delivery truck in front of an apartment, she was observing Tony's building intently. The aristocratic chin, the brightness of the eyes, the waves of her hair, and the general sunny expression! It could not be anyone else. Post haste he ran across the street.  \"Pardon me!\" he cried excitedly, lifting his hat and then digging hastily into his inner pocket. \"I'm sure you must be the--\"  \"Well, the nerve!\" the young woman said icily, and pointing her chin at the opposite horizon she walked haughtily away.  By that time Phil had dug out his picture and was running after her.  \"Please,\" he said, \"just a moment!\" And he held the picture out in front of her face.  \"Now, where in the world--?\" She looked at him in puzzled and indignant inquiry, and then burst out laughing.  \"It _is_ you, isn't it?\" Phil asked. \"What are you laughing at?\"  \"Oh, you looked so abject. I'm sure your intentions must be good. Now tell me where you got my picture.\"  \"Let us walk this way,\" suggested Phil, leading away from Tony's building.         *       *       *       *       *  And, as they walked, he told her the story. When he got through she stood and looked at him a long time in silence.  \"You look square to me,\" she said. \"You're working on my side already. Will you help me.\"  \"I'll do anything--anything--\" Phil said, and couldn't think of any other way of expressing his willingness, for the wonderful eyes bore radiantly upon him.  \"First I must tell you my story,\" she began. \"But before I can do so, you must promise me that it is to remain an absolute secret. You're a newspaper man--\"  Phil gave his promise readily.  \"My father is Professor Bloomsbury at the University of Chicago. He has been experimenting in mathematical physics, and I have been assisting him. He has succeeded in proving experimentally the concept of tensors. A tensor is a mathematical expression for the fact that space is smooth and flat, in three dimensions, only at an infinite distance from matter; in the neighborhood of a particle of matter, there is a pucker or a wrinkle in space. My father has found that by suddenly removing a portion of matter from out of space, the pucker flattens out. If the matter is heavy enough and its removal sudden enough, there is a violent disturbance of space. By planning all the steps carefully my father has succeeded in swinging a section of space on a pivot through an angle of 180 degrees, and causing two portions of space to change places through hyperspace, or as you might express it popularly, through the fourth dimension.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Phil held his hands to his head.  \"It is not difficult,\" she went on smiling. \"Loan me your pocket knife and a piece of paper from your notebook. If I cut out a rectangular piece of paper from this sheet and mount it on a pivot or shaft at A B, I can rotate it through 180 degrees, just like a child's teeter-totter, so that X will be where Y originally was. That is in two dimensions. Now, simply add one dimension all the way round and you will have what daddy is doing with space. He does it by shoving fifty or a hundred pounds of lead right out of space; the sudden flattening out of the tensors causes a section of space to flop around, and two portions of space change places. The first time he tried it, his desk disappeared, and we've never seen it again. We've thought it was somewhere out in hyperspace; but this terrible story of yours about disappearing safes, and the fact that you have this picture, means that someone has got the desk.\"  \"Surely you must have suspected that long ago, when the disappearances first began?\" Phil suggested.  \"I've just returned from Europe,\" said Miss Bloomsbury. \"I was tremendously puzzled when I got my first newspapers in New York and read about the safes. Gradually I gathered all the news on the subject, and it seemed most reasonable to suspect this gangster engineer.\"  \"Great minds and same channels,\" Phil smiled. \"But your father. Why didn't he speak up when the safes began to pop?\"  \"Ha! ha!\" she laughed a tinkly little laugh. \"My father doesn't know what safes are for, nor who is President, nor that there has been a war. Mother and I take care of him, and he works on tensors. He has probably never heard about the safes.\"         *       *       *       *       *  \"What were you going to do around here?\" Phil asked, marveling at the courage of the girl who had come to look the situation over personally.  \"I hadn't formed any definite plans. I just wanted to look about first.\"  \"Well,\" said Phil, \"as you will soon see by the papers, another safe has puffed out. It occurred to me that we might find out something by spying about here immediately after one of the disappearances. That's why I'm here. If you'll tell me where you live, or wait for me at some safe place, I'll come and report to you as soon as I find out anything.\"  \"Oho! So that's the kind of a girl you think I am!\" She laughed sunnily again. \"No, Mr. Reporter. Either we reconnoiter together, or each on our own.\"  \"Oh, together, by all means,\" said Phil so earnestly that she laughed again. \"And since we'd better wait for darkness, let's have something to eat somewhere. I didn't finish my dinner.\"  Phil found Ione Bloomsbury in person to be even more wonderful than her photograph suggested. Obviously she had brains; it was apparent, too that she had breeding. Her cheerful view of the world was like a tonic for tired nerves; and withal, she had a gentle sort of courtesy in her manner that may have been old-fashioned, but it was almost too much for Phil. Before the dinner was over, he would have laid his heart at her feet. It gave him a thrill that went to his head, to have her by his side, slipping along through the darkness toward Tony's building.  This building was a one-story brick affair with a vast amount of window space. From the sidewalk they could see faint lights glowing within, but could make out no further details. They therefore selected the darkest side of the building, and made their way hurriedly across the lawn. Here, they found, they could see the crowding apparatus within the one long room fairly well. They looked into one window after another, making a circuit around the building, until Phil suddenly clutched the girl's arm.  \"Look!\" he whispered. \"Straight ahead and a little to the left!\"  At the place he indicated stood a tall safe. Across the top of its door were painted in gold letters, the words: \"The Epicure.\"  \"That's the safe that went to-night,\" whispered Phil. \"That's all we need to know. Now, quick to a telephone!\"  \"Oh,\" said a gentle, ironic voice behind them, \"not so quick!\"         *       *       *       *       *  They whirled around and found themselves looking into two automatic pistols, and behind them in the light of the street lamps, the sardonic smile of Tony Costello.  \"Charmed at your kind interest in my playthings, I'm sure,\" he purred. \"Only it leaves me in an embarrassing position. I'm not exactly sure what to do about it. Kindly step inside while I think.\"  Phil made a move sidewise along the wall.  \"Stop!\" barked Costello sharply. \"Of course,\" his voice was quiet again, \"that might be the simplest way out. I think I am within my legal rights if I shoot people who are trying to break into my property. Yet, that would be messy--not neat. Better step in. The window swings outward.\"  At the point of his pistols they clambered through the window, and he came in after them. He kept on talking, as though to himself, but loud enough for them to hear.  \"Yes, we want some way out that is neater than that. Hm! Violence distresses me. Never liked Ed's rough methods. Yet, this is embarrassing.\"  He turned to them.  \"What did you really want here? I see that you are the _Examiner's_ reporter, and that you are the lady of the photograph. What did you come here for? Ah, yes, the safe. Well, go over and look at it.\"  As they hesitated, he stamped his foot and shrilled crankily:  \"I mean it! Go, look at the safe! Is there anything else you want to know?\"  \"Yes,\" said Phil coolly, his self-control returning, \"where are the other safes?\"  \"Oh. Anything to oblige.

Carnes sprang to his feet.  \"Why, it's Feodrovna Androvitch!\" he cried in astonishment.  In an instant the rage faded from her face and the calm, immobility which had marked it reappeared. Through the silence Dr. Bird's voice cut like a whip.  \"Miss Andrews,\" he said sternly, \"I thought that I had impressed on you the fact that even a momentary lapse from the character which you have assumed may easily be fatal to both of us. Unless you can learn to control your emotions, your usefulness to me is at an end.\"  Although Carnes watched closely he could not detect the slightest change of expression in the girl's face as the doctor spoke.  \"I am very sorry, Doctor,\" she said evenly. \"We were alone and I allowed the mask to slip for an instant. It will not happen again.\"  \"It _must_ not,\" said the doctor curtly. \"Carry out your instructions.\"  \"Yes, Doctor.\"  She turned on her heel and left the office. Carnes looked quickly at Dr. Bird.  \"Surely that is Feodrovna Androvitch, Doctor?\" he asked.  \"It was. It is now Thelma Andrews, my secretary. She changed her name with her appearance and politics. I have been training her since last August. This is her first official appearance, so to speak.\"  \"In view of her past associations, is it safe to trust her?\"  \"If I didn't think so, I wouldn't use her. She has ample reason to hate Ivan Saranoff and she knows how much mercy she has to hope for from him if he ever gets her in his clutches. We can't play a lone hand against Saranoff forever and I know of no better place to recruit an organization than the enemy's camp. Thelma saved our lives in Russia, you may remember.\"  \"But even when she was rescuing us from the clutches of Saranoff's gang, she was an ardent communist, if I remember correctly.\"  \"Theoretically I believe she still favors the world revolution, but she hates Saranoff even more than she does the bourgeoisie and I believe she had come to be willing to accept capitalistic institutions for the present, at least as far as this country is concerned. At any rate, I trust her. If you have any doubts, you can have her watched for a while.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Carnes thought for a moment and then picked up the telephone.  \"I have plenty of confidence in your judgment, Doctor,\" he said apologetically, \"but if you don't mind, I'll have Haggerty trail her for a few days. It won't do any harm.\"  \"Very well; and if any of the Young Labor gang should penetrate her disguise, he'd be a mighty efficient bodyguard. Do as you see fit.\"  Carnes called the number of the secret service and conferred for a few moments with Bolton, the chief of the bureau. He turned to Dr. Bird with a smile of satisfaction.  \"Haggerty will be on the job in a few minutes, Doctor.\"  \"Good enough. The five minutes I allowed are up. Let's see how well she has performed her first task.\"  As they emerged from the Bureau of Standards, Carnes glanced rapidly around. In the front seat of the secret service car which he had left sat a young man whom the detective recognized as one of Dr. Bird's assistants. Behind the car stood a small delivery truck with two of the Bureau mechanics on the seat.  Dr. Bird nodded to the mechanics and followed Carnes into the big sedan. With a motorcycle policeman clearing a way for them, they roared across Washington and north along the Baltimore pike. Two hours and a half of driving brought them to Aberdeen and they turned down the concrete road leading to the proving ground. Two miles from the town a huge chain was stretched across the road with armed guards patrolling behind it. The car stopped and an officer stepped forward and examined the pass which Carnes presented.  \"You are to go direct to headquarters, gentlemen,\" he said. \"Colonel Wesley is waiting for you.\"  The commanding officer rose to his feet as Carnes and Dr. Bird entered his office.  \"I am at your service, Dr. Bird,\" he said formally. \"The Chief of Ordnance has given instructions which, as I understand them, put you virtually in command of this post.\" There was resentment in the colonel's tone.         *       *       *       *       *  Dr. Bird smiled affably and extended his hand. The old colonel struggled with his chagrin for a moment, but few men could resist Dr. Bird when he deliberately tried to charm them. Colonel Wesley grasped the proffered hand.  \"What I want most, Colonel, is your cooperation,\" said the doctor suavely. \"I am not competent to assume command here even if I wished to. I would like to ask a few favors but if they should prove to be contrary to your established policies, I will gladly withdraw my request.\"  Colonel Wesley's face cleared as if by magic.  \"You have only to ask for anything we have, Doctor,\" he said earnestly, \"and it is yours. Frankly, we are at our wit's end.\"  \"Thank you. I have a truck with some apparatus and three men outside. Will you have them guided to your laboratory and given what aid they need in setting their stuff up?\"  \"Gladly.\"  \"My secretary, Miss Andrews, will arrive from Washington later in the day with some information. I would like to have her passed through the guards and brought directly to me wherever I am. You have the place well guarded, have you not?\"  \"As well as I can with my small force. All roads are patrolled by motorcycles; four launches are on the waterfront, and there are seven planes aloft.\"  \"That is splendid. Now can you tell me just what happened last night?\"  \"Captain Murdock, the acting surgeon, can do that better than I can, Doctor. He is at the hospital but I'll have him up here in a few minutes.\"  \"With your permission, we'll go to the hospital and talk to him there. I want to examine the patients in any event.\"  \"Certainly, Doctor. I will remain at my office until I am sure that I can give you no further assistance.\"         *       *       *       *       *  With a word of thanks, Dr. Bird left, and, accompanied by Carnes, made his way to the hospital. Captain Murdock was frankly relieved to greet the famous Bureau of Standards scientist and readily gave him the information he desired.  \"The first intimation we had of trouble was when Lieutenant Burroughs telephoned from the water impact range where they were doing night firing last night at about four A.M. Two ambulances went down and brought him and his four men back, all of them stricken with what I take to be an extremely rapidly developing form of lobar pneumonia. All of the men who went down were stricken with the same disease, two of them as soon as they got back. So far we have had eight deaths among these men and all of the rest, except Lieutenant Burroughs, are apt to go at any moment.  \"The trouble seemed to come from a cloud of some dense heavy gas which rolled in from the marsh. On the advice of Major Martin, every door and window in the post was kept closed until morning. The gas never reached the upper part of the post but it reached the stables. Eleven horses and mules are dead and all of the rest are stricken. The stable detachment either failed to close their barracks tightly or else the gas went in through cracks for seven out of the nine are here in the hospital, although none of them are very seriously ill. As soon as the sun came up, the gas seemed to disappear.\"  \"Let me see the men who are sick.\"  Captain Murdock led the way into the ward. Dr. Bird went from man to man, examining charts and asking questions of the nurses and medical corps men on duty. When he had gone the rounds of the ward he entered the morgue and carefully examined the bodies of the men who lay there.  \"Have you performed any autopsies?\" he asked.  \"Not yet.\"  \"Have you the authority?\"  \"On the approval of the commanding officer.\"  \"Please secure that approval at once. Have all lights taken out of the operating room and the windows shaded. I want to work under red light. We must examine the lungs of these men at once. With all due respect to your medical knowledge, Captain, I am not convinced that these men died of pneumonia.\"  \"Neither am I, Doctor, but that is the best guess I could make. I'll have things fixed up for you right away.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Dr. Bird stepped to the telephone and called the laboratory. When, in half an hour, Captain Murdock announced that he was ready to proceed, Davis had arrived with an ultra-microscope and other apparatus which the doctor had telephoned for.  \"Did you arrange about the horses, Davis?\" asked Dr. Bird.  \"Yes, sir. They will be up here as soon as the trucks can bring them.\"  \"Good enough. We'll start operating.\"  An hour later, Dr. Bird straightened up and faced the puzzled medical officer.  \"Captain,\" he said, \"your diagnosis is faulty. With one possible exception, the lungs of these men are free from pneumonicocci. On the other hand there is a peculiar aspect of the tissues as though a very powerful antiseptic solution had been applied to them.\"  \"Hardly an antiseptic, Doctor; wouldn't you say, rather, a cauterizing agent.\"  Dr. Bird bent again over the ultra-microscope.  \"Are you familiar with the work done by Bancroft and Richter at Cornell University last November and December?\" he asked.  \"No, I can't say that I am.\"  \"They were working under a Heckscher Foundation grant studying just how antiseptic solutions destroy bacteria. It has always been held that some chemical change went on, but this theory they disproved. It is a process of absorption. If enough of the chemical adheres to the living bacterium, the living protoplasm thickens and irreversibly coagulates. It resembles a boiling without heat. I have seen some of their slides and the appearance is exactly what I see in this tissue.\"  Captain Murdock bent over the microscope with a new respect for Dr. Bird in his face.  \"I agree with you, Doctor,\" he said. \"This tissue certainly looks as though it had been boiled. It is certainly coagulated,"]]]
