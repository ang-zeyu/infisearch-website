It might well be possible to set a date a few decades earlier, but in general as one proceeds backwards from this point, the evidence becomes increasingly fragmentary and uncertain. The greatest source of doubt arises from the confusion between sundials, water-clocks, hand-struck time bells, and mechanical clocks, all of which are covered by the term _horologium_ and its vernacular equivalents.  Temporarily postponing the consideration of evidence prior to _ca._ 1350, we may take Giovanni de Dondi as a starting point and trace a virtually unbroken lineage from his time to the present day. One may follow the spread of clocks through Europe, from large towns to small ones, from the richer cathedrals and abbeys to the less wealthy churches.[8] There is the transition from the tower clocks--showpieces of great institutions--to the simple chamber clock designed for domestic use and to the smaller portable clocks and still smaller and more portable pocket watches. In mechanical refinement a similar continuity may be noted, so that one sees the cumulative effect of the introduction of the spring drive (_ca._ 1475), pendulum control (_ca._ 1650), and the anchor escapement (_ca._ 1680). The transition from de Dondi to the modern chronometer is indeed basically continuous, and though much research needs to be done on special topics, it has an historical unity and seems to conform for the most part to the general pattern of steady mechanical improvement found elsewhere in the history of technology.  [Illustration: Figure 3.--GERMAN WALL CLOCK, PROBABLY ABOUT 1450, showing the degeneration in complexity from that of de Dondi's clock.]  Most remarkable however is the earliest period of this seemingly steady evolution. Side by side with the advances made in the earliest period extending for less than two centuries from the time of de Dondi one may see a spectacular process of degeneration or devolution. Not only is de Dondi's the earliest clock of which we have a full and trustworthy account, it is also far more complicated than any other (see figs. 1, 2) until comparatively modern times! Moreover, it was not an exceptional freak. There were others like it, and one cannot therefore reject as accidental this process of degeneration that occurs at the very beginning of the certain history of the mechanical clock in Europe.  On the basis of such evidence I have suggested elsewhere[9] that the clock is \"nought but a fallen angel from the world of astronomy.\" The first great clocks of medieval Europe were designed as astronomical showpieces, full of complicated gearing and dials to show the motions of the Sun, Moon and planets, to exhibit eclipses, and to carry through the involved computations of the ecclesiastical calendar. As such they were comparable to the orreries of the 18th century and to modern planetariums; that they also showed the time and rang it on bells was almost incidental to their main function. One must not neglect, too, that it was in their glorification of the rationality of the cosmos that they had their greatest effect. Through milleniums of civilization, man's understanding of celestial phenomena had been the very pinnacle of his intellect, and then as now popular exhibition of this sort was just as necessary, as striking, and as impressive. One does not have to go far to see how the paraphernalia of these early great astronomical clocks had great influence on philosophers and theologians and on poets such as Dante.  It is the thesis of this part of my argument that the ordinary time-telling clock is no affiliate of the other simple time-telling devices such as sundials, sand glasses and the elementary water clocks. Rather it should be considered as a degenerate branch from the main stem of mechanized astronomical devices (I shall call them protoclocks), a stem which can boast a continuous history filling the gap between the appearance of simple gearing and the complications of de Dondi. We shall return to the discussion of this main stem after analyzing the very recently discovered parallel stem from medieval China, which reproduced the same evolution of mechanized astronomical devices and incidental time telling. Of the greatest significance, this stem reveals the crucial independent invention of a mechanical escapement, a feature not found in the European stem in spite of centuries of intensive historical research and effort.   THE CHINESE TRADITION  For this section I am privileged to draw upon a thrilling research project carried out in 1956 at the University of Cambridge by a team consisting of Dr. Joseph Needham, Dr. Wang Ling, and myself.[10] In the course of this work we translated and commented on a series of texts most of which had not hitherto been made available in a Western tongue and, though well known in China, had not been recognized as important for their horological content. The key text with which we started was the \"Hsin I Hsiang Fa Yao,\" or \"New Design for a (mechanized) Armillary (sphere) and (celestial) Globe,\" written by Su Sung in A.D. 1090. The very full historical and technical description in this text enabled us to establish a glossary and basic understanding of the mechanism that later enabled us to interpret a whole series of similar, though less extensive texts, giving a history of prior development of such devices going back to the introduction of this type of escapement by I-Hsing and Liang Ling-tsan, in A.D. 725, and to what seems to be the original of all these Chinese astronomical machines, that built by Chang Hêng _ca._ A.D. 130. Filling the gaps between these landmarks are several other similar texts, giving ample evidence that the Chinese development is continuous and, at least from Chang Hêng onwards, largely independent of any transmissions from the West.  So far as we can see, the beginning of the chain in China (as indeed in the West) was the making of simple static models of the celestial sphere. An armillary sphere was used to represent the chief imaginary circles (_e.g._, equator, ecliptic, meridians, etc.), or a solid celestial globe on which such circles could be drawn, together with the constellations of the fixed stars. The whole apparatus was then mounted so that it was free to revolve about its polar axis and another ring or a casing was added, external and fixed, to represent the horizon that provided a datum for the rising and setting of the Sun and the stars.  In the next stage, reached very soon after this, the rotation of the model was arranged to proceed automatically instead of by hand. This was done, we believe, by using a slowly revolving wheel powered by dripping water and turning the model through a reduction mechanism, probably involving gears or, more reasonably, a single large gear turned by a trip lever. It did not matter much that the time-keeping properties were poor in the long run; the model moved \"by itself\" and the great wonder was that it agreed with the observed heavens \"like the two halves of a tally.\"  In the next, and essential, stage the turning of the water wheel was regulated by an \"escapement\" mechanism consisting of a weighbridge and trip levers so arranged that the wheel was held in check, scoop by scoop, while each scoop was filled by the dripping water, then released by the weighbridge and allowed to rotate until checked again by the trip-lever arrangement. Its action was similar to that of the anchor escapement, though its period of repose was much longer than its period of motion and, of course, its time-keeping properties were controlled not only by the mechanics of the device but also by the rate of flow of the dripping water.  The Chinese escapement may justifiably be regarded as a missing link, just halfway between the elementary clepsydra with its steady flow of water and the mechanical escapement in which time is counted by chopping its flow into cycles of action, repeated indefinitely and counted by a cumulating device. With its characteristic of saving up energy for a considerable period (about 15 minutes) before letting it go in one powerful action, the Chinese escapement was particularly suited to the driving of jackwork and other demonstration devices requiring much energy but only intermittent activity.  In its final form, as built by Su Sung after many trials and improvements, the Chinese \"astronomical clock-tower\" must have been a most impressive object. It had the form of a tower about 30 feet high, surmounted by an observation platform covered with a light roof (see fig. 4). On the platform was an armillary sphere designed for observing the heavens. It was turned by the clockwork so as to follow the diurnal rotation and thus avoid the distressing computations caused by the change of coordinates necessary when fixed alt-azimuth instruments were used. Below the platform was an enclosed chamber containing the automatically rotated celestial globe which so wonderfully agreed with the heavens. Below this, on the front of the tower was a miniature pagoda with five tiers; on each tier was a doorway through which, at due moment, appeared jacks who rang bells, clanged gongs, beat drums, and held tablets to announce the arrival of each hour, each quarter (they used 100 of them to the day) and each watch of the night. Within the tower was concealed the mechanism; it consisted mainly of a central vertical shaft providing power for the sphere, globe, and jackwheels, and a horizontal shaft geared to the vertical one and carrying the great water wheel which seemed to set itself magically in motion at every quarter. In addition to all this were the levers of the escapement mechanism and a pair of norias by which, once each day, the water used was pumped from a sump at the bottom to a reservoir at the top, whence it descended to work the wheel by means of a constant level tank and several channels.  There were many offshoots and developments "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30001"],["title","On the Origin of Clockwork, Perpetual Motion Devices, and the Compass (#2)"],["body","this main stem of Chinese horology. We are told, for example, that often mercury and occasionally sand were used to replace the water, which frequently froze in winter in spite of the application of lighted braziers to the interior of the machines. Then again, the astronomical models and the jackwork were themselves subject to gradual improvement: at the time of I-Hsing, for example, special attention was paid to the demarcation of ecliptic as well as the normal equatorial coordinates; this was clearly an influx from Hellenistic-Islamic astronomy, in which the relatively sophisticated planetary mathematics had forced this change not otherwise noted in China.  By the time of the Jesuits, this current of Chinese horology, long since utterly destroyed by the perils of wars, storms, and governmental reforms, had quite been forgotten. Matteo Ricci's clocks, those gifts that aroused so much more interest than European theological teachings, were obviously something quite new to the 16th-century Chinese scholars; so much so that they were dubbed with a quite new name, \"self-sounding bells,\" a direct translation of the word \"clock\" (_glokke_). In view of the fact that the medieval Chinese escapement may have been the basis of European horology, it is a curious twist of fate that the high regard of the Chinese for European clocks should have prompted them to open their doors, previously so carefully and for so long kept closed against the foreign barbarians.

(_Courtesy of Cambridge University Press._)]     Mechanized Astronomical Models  Now that we have seen the manner in which mechanized astronomical models developed in China, we can detect a similar line running from Hellenistic time, through India and Islam to the medieval Europe that inherited their learning. There are many differences, notably because of the especial development of that peculiar characteristic of the West, mathematical astronomy, conditioned by the almost accidental conflux of Babylonian arithmetical methods with those of Greek geometry. However, the lines are surprisingly similar, with the exception only of the crucial invention of the escapement, a feature which seems to be replaced by the influx of ideas connected with perpetual motion wheels.   HELLENISTIC PERIOD  Most interesting and frequently cited is the bronze planetarium said to have been made by Archimedes and described in a tantalisingly fragmentary fashion by Cicero and by later authors. Because of its importance as a prototype, we give the most relevant passages in full.[11]  Cicero's descriptions of Archimedes' planetarium are (italics supplied):    Gaius Sulpicius Gallus ... at a time when ... he happened   to be at the house of Marcus Marcellus, his colleague in   the consulship [166 B.C.], ordered the celestial globe to   be brought out which the grandfather of Marcellus had   carried off from Syracuse, when that very rich and   beautiful city was taken [212 B.C.].... Though I had heard   this globe (sphaerae) mentioned quite frequently on   account of the fame of Archimedes, when I saw it I did not   particularly admire it; for that other celestial globe,   also constructed by Archimedes, which the same Marcellus   placed in the temple of Virtue, is more beautiful as well   as more widely known among the people. But when Gallus   began to give a very learned explanation of the device, I   concluded that the famous Sicilian had been endowed with   greater genius than one would imagine possible for human   being to possess. For Gallus told us that the other kind   of celestial globe, which was solid and contained no   hollow space, was a very early invention, the first one of   that kind having been constructed by Thales of Miletus,   and later marked by Eudoxus of Cnidus--a disciple of   Plato, it was claimed--with constellations and stars which   are fixed in the sky. He also said that many years later   Aratus ... had described it in verse.... But this newer   kind of globe, he said, on which were delineated the   motions of the sun and moon and of those five stars which   are called wanderers, or, as we might say, rovers   [_i. e._, the five planets], contained more than could be   shown on the solid globe, and the invention of Archimedes   deserved special admiration because he had thought out a   way to represent accurately by a single device for turning   the globe, those various and divergent movements with   their different rates of speed. And when Gallus moved   [_i.e._, set in motion] the globe, it was actually true   that the moon was always as many revolutions behind the   sun on the _bronze_ contrivance as would agree with the   number of days it was behind in the sky. Thus the same   eclipse of the sun happened on the globe as would actually   happen, and the moon came to the point where the shadow of   the earth was at the very time when the sun (appeared?)   out of the region ... [several pages are missing in the   manuscript; there is only one].      _De republica_, I, xiv (21-22), Keyes' translation.    When Archimedes put together in a globe the movements of   the moon, sun and five wandering [planets], he brought   about the same effect as that which the god of Plato did   in the Timaeus when he made the world, so that one   revolution produced dissimilar movements of delay and   acceleration.      _Tusculanae disputationes_, I, 63.  Later descriptions from Ovid, Lactantius, Claudian, Sextus Empiricus, and Pappus, respectively, are (italics supplied):    There stands a globe suspended by a Syracusan's skill in   an enclosed bronze [frame, or sphere--or perhaps, in   enclosed air], a small image of the immense vault [of   heaven]; and the earth is equally distant from the top and   bottom; that is brought about by its [_i. e._, the outer   bronze globe's] round form. The form of the temple [of   Vesta] is similar....      Ovid, _Fasti_ (1st century, A.D.), VI, 277-280,       Frazer's translation.    The Sicilian Archimedes, was able to make a reproduction   and model of the world in concave _brass_ (concavo aere   similitudinem mundi ac figuram); in it he so arranged the   _sun_ and _moon_ and resembling the celestial revolutions   (caelestibus similes conversionibus); and while it   revolved it exhibited not only the accession and recession   of the sun and the waxing and waning of the moon   (incrementa deminutionesque lunae), but also the unequal   _courses of the stars_, whether fixed or wandering.      Lactantius, _Institutiones divinae_ (4th century, A.D.),       II, 5, 18.    Archimedes' sphere. When Jove looked down and saw the   heavens figured in a sphere of _glass_, he laughed and   said to the other gods: \"Has the power of mortal effort   gone so far? Is my handiwork now mimicked in a fragile   globe?\" An old man of Syracuse had imitated on earth the   laws of the heavens, the order of nature, and the   ordinances of the gods. Some hidden influence within the   sphere directs the various courses of the _stars_ and   actuates the lifelike mass with definite motions. A false   _zodiac_ runs through a year of its own and a toy _moon_   waxes and wanes month by month. Now bold invention   rejoices to make its own heaven revolve and sets the   _stars_ [planets?] in motion by human wit....      Claudian, _Carmina minora_ (_ca._ A.D. 400), LI (LXVIII),       Platnaure's translation.    The things that move by themselves are more wonderful than   those which do not. At any rate, when we behold an   Archimedean sphere in which the sun and the rest of the   stars move, we are immensely impressed by it, not by Zeus   because we are amazed at the _wood_, or at the movements   of these [bodies], but by the devices and causes of the   movements.      Sextus Empiricus, _Adversus mathematicos_ (3rd century,       A.D.), IX, 115, Epps' translation.    Mechanics understand the making of spheres and know how to   produce a model of the heavens (with the courses of the   stars moving in circles?) by mean of equal and circular   motions of _water_, and Archimedes the Syracusan,   according to some, knows the cause and reasons for all of   these.    Pappus (3rd century, A.D.), _Works_ (Hultsch edition),     VIII, 2, Epps' translation.  A similar arrangement seems to be indicated in another mechanized globe, also mentioned by Cicero and said to have been made by Posidonius:    But if anyone brought to Scythia or Britain the globe   (sphaeram) which our friend Posidonius [of Apameia, the   Stoic philosopher] recently made, in which each revolution   produced the same (movements) of the _sun_ and _moon_ and   _five_ wandering stars as is produced in the sky each day   and night, who would doubt that it was by exertion of   reason?... Yet doubters ... think that Archimedes showed   more knowledge in producing movements by revolutions of a   globe than nature (does) in effecting them though the copy   is so infinitely inferior to the original....     _De natura deorum_, II, xxxiv-xxxv (88),     Yonge's translation.  In spite of the lack of sufficient technical details in any case, these mechanized globe models, with or without geared planetary indicators (which would make them highly complex machines), bear a striking resemblance to the earliest Chinese device described by Chang Hêng. One must not reject the possibility that transmission from Greece or Rome could have reached the East by the beginning of the 2nd century, A.D., when he was working. It is an interesting question, but even if such contact actually occurred, very soon afterwards, as we shall see, the western and eastern lines of evolution parted company and evolved so far as can be seen, quite independently until at least the 12th century.  The next Hellenistic source of which we must take note is a fragmentary and almost unintelligible chapter in the works of Hero of"]]]
