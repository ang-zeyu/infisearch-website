And she shall be mine?    DALAND.    Ich gebe Dir mein Wort.   Mich rührt Dein Loos; freigebig, wie Du bist,   Zeigst Edelmuth und hohen Sinn Du mir: --   Den Eidam wünscht’ ich so, und wär’ Dein Gut   Auch nicht so reich, wählt’ ich doch keinen Andern.        DALAND.        My word I pledge to thee,       Thy fate has won my heart; thou’rt lavish;       Thus must be he who weds my daughter,       And if less rich thou wert, no other would I choose.    HOLLAENDER.    Hab’ Dank! Werd’ ich die Tochter heut’ noch sehn?        THE FLYING DUTCHMAN.        Thanks! Will I see thy girl ere sinks the day to rest?    DALAND.    Der nächste günst’ge Wind führt uns nach Haus.   Du sollst sie sehn, und wenn sie Dir gefällt --        DALAND.        With change of wind we set our sails homeward;       Once on shore, and if my daughter suits thee, then--    HOLLAENDER.    So ist sie mein. . . Wird sie mein Engel sein?   Wenn aus der Qualen Schreckgewalten   Die Sehnsucht nach dem Heil mich treibt,   Ist mir’s erlaubt, mich fest zu halten   An _einer_ Hoffnung, die mir bleibt.   Darf ich in jenem Wahn noch schmachten,   Dass sich ein Engel mir erweicht?   Der Qualen, die mein Haupt umnachten,   Ersehntes Ziel hätt’ ich erreicht.   Ach! ohne Hoffnung wie ich bin,   Geb’ ich mich doch der Hoffnung hin!        THE FLYING DUTCHMAN.        Then she will be mine--my angel she shall be.       When out of torment’s iron hold,         I long to see salvation near,       I cling--for so have I been told--         To _one_ hope still remaining dear.       May still I hope--I cannot pray--         That pity feel might angel-wife?       Then will I praise this happy day,         When o’er, at last, this woeful strife.       Though hope has died, and left no trace,       I hope again for joy and grace.    DALAND.    Gepriesen seid, des Sturms Gewalten,   Die ihr an diesen Strand mich triebt.   Fürwahr! Blos brauch ich festzuhalten,   Was sich so schön von selbst mir giebt.   Die ihn an diese Küste brachten   Ihr Winde sollt gesegnet sein!   Ja, wonach alle Väter trachten,   Ein reicher Eidam, er ist mein.   Dem Mann mit Gut und hohem Sinn   Geb’ froh ich Haus und Tochter hin!        DALAND.        When from the South it blew a gale       That drove me to this rocky shore,       I did at first my fate bewail;       But now I wail and grieve no more.       I praise the wind that drove me here,       For here I met a lucky fate,       For here I found a treasure dear:       A rich man with my child to mate!       He who with treasure sails the sea,       Shall welcome to my daughter be!    STEUERMANN.    Südwind! Südwind!   Ach! lieber Südwind, blas’ noch mehr!        MATE.        Southwind! Southwind!       Come, Southwind, blow again!    MATROSEN.    Holloje! Hollajo!        SAILORS.        Heigho! Heigho! Heigho!    DALAND.    Du siehst, das Glück ist günstig Dir:   Der Wind ist gut, die See in Ruh’.   Sogleich die Anker lichten wir   Und segeln schnell der Heimath zu.        DALAND.        We are lucky, indeed; for good is the wind,       And smooth as a sea of glass is the sea;       Let us weigh the anchors without delay,       And set sail for the sheltering port.    MATROSEN.    Hohohe! Hohohe! Halloho! Jo! etc.        SAILORS.        Heigho! ho! Heigho! ho! ho!    HOLLAENDER.    Darf ich Dich bitten, segelst Du voran;   Der Wind ist frisch, doch, meine Mannschaft müd’,   Ich gönn’ ihr kurze Ruh’, und folge dann.        THE FLYING DUTCHMAN.        You sail ahead, if it so pleases you,       The wind is good, but fatigued are my men;       I’ll give them rest, and then I follow.    DALAND.    Doch unser Wind?        DALAND.        But if the wind should change?    HOLLAENDER.    Er bläst noch lang’ aus Süd’,   Mein Schiff ist schnell, es holt Dich sicher ein.        THE FLYING DUTCHMAN.        ’T will blow from the South, be assured.       My ship sails fast, and will reach you soon.    DALAND.    Du glaubst? Wohlan! Es möge denn so sein.   Leb’ wohl! mögst heute Du mein Kind noch sehn!        DALAND.        As you say, so it be.       Farewell! And my child, will you see her this day?    HOLLAENDER.    Gewiss!        THE FLYING DUTCHMAN.        This day I shall see her.    DALAND.    Hei! Wie die Segel schon sich bläh’n!   Hallo! Hallo! Frisch, Jungen! Greifet an!        DALAND.        See how swell in the wind the sails!       Hallo! Hallo! Be up and doing, boys!    MATROSEN.    Mit Gewitter und Sturm aus fernem Meer.   Mein Mädel, bin Dir nah!   Ueber thurmhohe Fluth, vom Süden her --   Mein Mädel, ich bin da!   Mein Mädel, wenn nicht Südwind wär’,   Ich nimmer wohl käm’ zu Dir!   Ach, lieber Südwind, blas’ noch mehr!   Mein Mädel verlangt nach mir!   Hohoje! Halloho! Hoho! Ho! Ho! Ho!        SAILORS.        In tempest’s roar, on the wide sea,       My girl, I think of thee!       The gale, ah, well! it came from the South--       Lucky for thee and me!       My girl, if it hadn’t Southwind been,       I wouldn’t see thee again!       Ah! come and blow, my Southwind fair,       Else waits my love in vain.       Hohohe! Johohe! heigho! heigho!       ZWEITER ACT.        ACT II.     ERSTE SCENE.        SCENE I.    MAEDCHEN.    Summ und brumm, du gutes Rädchen,   Munter, munter dreh’ dich um!   Spinne, spinne tausend Fädchen,   Gutes Rädchen, summ’ und brumm!   Mein Schatz ist auf dem Meere draus,   Er denkt nach Haus   An’s fromme Kind:   Mein gutes Rädchen saus’ und braus’!   Ach, gäbst du Wind,   Er käm’ geschwind!   Spinnt, spinnt!   Fleissig, Mädchen!   Summ, brumm,   Gutes Rädchen!        GIRLS.        Hum and buzz! What cheerful sound!       Turn round the wheel, quick, quick, quick!       Spin the golden thread around!       Hum and buzz like magic trick!       My love sails o’er stormy sea,       And thinks of me,       His own sweetheart.       Pray, O pray, for him and me,       That storm depart,       Fair wind his part!       Spin and spin       The wheel around,       Hum and buzz       With cheery sound!    MARY.    Ei! Fleissig, fleissig, wie sie spinnen!   Will jede sich den Schatz gewinnen.        MARY.        See, how quick they turn the wheel!       Must be for love they for him feel.    MAEDCHEN.    Frau Mary, still! denn wohl Ihr wisst,   Das Lied noch nicht zu Ende ist.        GIRLS.        Thou mustn’t speak! While floats our song       On airy wings, please hold thy tongue!    MARY.    So singt! dem Rädchen lässt’s nicht Ruh’.   Du aber, Senta, schweigst dazu?        MARY.        Then sing your song the life-long night!       But, Senta! child, thou art so quiet.    MAEDCHEN.    Summ und brumm, du gutes Rädchen,   Munter, munter dreh’ dich um!   Spinne, spinne tausend Fädchen,   Gutes Rädchen, summ und brumm!   Mein Schatz da draussen auf dem Meer   Im Süden er   Viel Gold gewinnt.   Ach, gutes Rädchen, braus’ noch mehr!   Er giet’s dem Kind,   Wenn’s fleissig spinnt.   Spinnt, spinnt!   Fleissig, Mädchen!   Summ, brumm,   Gutes Rädchen!        GIRLS.        Hum and buzz! What cheerful sound       Turn round the wheel, quick, quick, quick!       Spin the golden thread around!       Hum and buzz like magic trick!       My love sails o’er stormy sea,       On Southland’s coast       He seeks for gold.       Pray, O pray, that I may boast,       And share his gold.       And now behold         How turns the wheel       With cheery sound,         While sure I feel       For home he’s bound!    MARY.    Du böses Kind, wenn Du nicht spinnst,   Vom Schatz Du kein Geschenk gewinnst!        MARY.        Thou bad child, thou, if thou wilt not spin,       Thou ne’er the gold thy love brings shalt win.    MAEDCHEN.    Sie hat’s nicht noth, dass sie sich eilt,   Ihr Schatz nicht auf dem Meere weilt;   Bringt er nicht Gold, bringt er doch Wild,   Man weiss ja, was ein Jäger gilt!        GIRLS.        Why should she spin and work as we?       _Her_ love not sails o’er stormy sea,       Her love’s a huntsman gay and bold,       He brings her game instead of gold.    MARY.    Da seht Ihr’s! Immer vor dem Bild! --   Wirst Du Dein ganzes junges Leben   Verträumen vor dem Conterfei?        MARY.        Look at her! Always before the picture!       Senta, art thou to dream away thy young life,       Contemplating this portrait?    SENTA.    Was hast Du Kunde mir gegeben,   Was mir erzählet, wer es sei!   Der arme Mann!        SENTA.        Thine the blame!       From thee his history I learned--       Poor man he!    MARY.    Gott sei mit Dir!        MARY.        May God protect thy young life!    MAEDCHEN.    Ei, ei! Ei, ei! Was hören wir?   Sie seufzet um den bleichen Mann.        GIRLS.        What! what’s this! listen well!       She sighs for him, this pale man.    MARY.    Den Kopf verliert sie noch darum.        MARY.        Her head will be turned, God knows!    MAEDCHEN.    Da sieht man, was ein Bild doch kann!        GIRLS.        This a simple picture’s power shows.    MARY.    Nichts hilft es, wenn ich täglich brumm’:   Komm’, Senta! wend’ Dich doch herum!        MARY.        All my scolding is in vain,       Come, Senta, be a good child.    MAEDCHEN.    Sie hört Euch nicht, -- sie ist verliebt.   Ei, ei! Wenn’s nur nicht Händel giebt!   Erik ist gar ein heisses Blut,   Dass er nur keinen Schaden thut!   Sagt nichts, er schiesst sonst wuthentbrannt   Den Nebenbuhler von der Wand.        GIRLS.        Not does she mind thee; she’s in love,       A bad affair this will be,       You know how jealous Erik is,       Why! he’ll be apt to act quite rash,       And, blinded by his jealousy, shoot       His rival hanging on the wall.    SENTA.    O schweigt! Mit Eurem tollen Lachen   Wollt Ihr mich ernstlich böse machen?        SENTA.        Cease this talk, you foolish things,       Or angry I will be.    MAEDCHEN.    Summ und brumm, du gutes Rädchen,   Munter, munter dreh’ dich um!   Spinne, spinne tausend Fädchen,   Gutes Rädchen, brumm und summ!        GIRLS.

There was a disturbance at the corner where he usually caught his bus--someone was screaming something about a new kind of deep-freeze--so he walked an extra block. He saw the bus coming and started to trot. But behind him, someone was calling his name. He looked over his shoulder; a small harried-looking man was hurrying toward him.  Burckhardt hesitated, and then recognized him. It was a casual acquaintance named Swanson. Burckhardt sourly observed that he had already missed the bus.  He said, \"Hello.\"  Swanson's face was desperately eager. \"Burckhardt?\" he asked inquiringly, with an odd intensity. And then he just stood there silently, watching Burckhardt's face, with a burning eagerness that dwindled to a faint hope and died to a regret. He was searching for something, waiting for something, Burckhardt thought. But whatever it was he wanted, Burckhardt didn't know how to supply it.  Burckhardt coughed and said again, \"Hello, Swanson.\"  Swanson didn't even acknowledge the greeting. He merely sighed a very deep sigh.  \"Nothing doing,\" he mumbled, apparently to himself. He nodded abstractedly to Burckhardt and turned away.  Burckhardt watched the slumped shoulders disappear in the crowd. It was an _odd_ sort of day, he thought, and one he didn't much like. Things weren't going right.  Riding home on the next bus, he brooded about it. It wasn't anything terrible or disastrous; it was something out of his experience entirely. You live your life, like any man, and you form a network of impressions and reactions. You _expect_ things. When you open your medicine chest, your razor is expected to be on the second shelf; when you lock your front door, you expect to have to give it a slight extra tug to make it latch.  It isn't the things that are right and perfect in your life that make it familiar. It is the things that are just a little bit wrong--the sticking latch, the light switch at the head of the stairs that needs an extra push because the spring is old and weak, the rug that unfailingly skids underfoot.  It wasn't just that things were wrong with the pattern of Burckhardt's life; it was that the _wrong_ things were wrong. For instance, Barth hadn't come into the office, yet Barth _always_ came in.  Burckhardt brooded about it through dinner. He brooded about it, despite his wife's attempt to interest him in a game of bridge with the neighbors, all through the evening. The neighbors were people he liked--Anne and Farley Dennerman. He had known them all their lives. But they were odd and brooding, too, this night and he barely listened to Dennerman's complaints about not being able to get good phone service or his wife's comments on the disgusting variety of television commercials they had these days.  Burckhardt was well on the way to setting an all-time record for continuous abstraction when, around midnight, with a suddenness that surprised him--he was strangely _aware_ of it happening--he turned over in his bed and, quickly and completely, fell asleep.   II  On the morning of June 15th, Burckhardt woke up screaming.  [Illustration]  It was more real than any dream he had ever had in his life. He could still hear the explosion, feel the blast that crushed him against a wall. It did not seem right that he should be sitting bolt upright in bed in an undisturbed room.  His wife came pattering up the stairs. \"Darling!\" she cried. \"What's the matter?\"  He mumbled, \"Nothing. Bad dream.\"  She relaxed, hand on heart. In an angry tone, she started to say: \"You gave me such a shock--\"  But a noise from outside interrupted her. There was a wail of sirens and a clang of bells; it was loud and shocking.  The Burckhardts stared at each other for a heartbeat, then hurried fearfully to the window.  There were no rumbling fire engines in the street, only a small panel truck, cruising slowly along. Flaring loudspeaker horns crowned its top. From them issued the screaming sound of sirens, growing in intensity, mixed with the rumble of heavy-duty engines and the sound of bells. It was a perfect record of fire engines arriving at a four-alarm blaze.  Burckhardt said in amazement, \"Mary, that's against the law! Do you know what they're doing? They're playing records of a fire. What are they up to?\"  \"Maybe it's a practical joke,\" his wife offered.  \"Joke? Waking up the whole neighborhood at six o'clock in the morning?\" He shook his head. \"The police will be here in ten minutes,\" he predicted. \"Wait and see.\"  But the police weren't--not in ten minutes, or at all. Whoever the pranksters in the car were, they apparently had a police permit for their games.  The car took a position in the middle of the block and stood silent for a few minutes. Then there was a crackle from the speaker, and a giant voice chanted:   \"Feckle Freezers!   Feckle Freezers!   Gotta have a   Feckle Freezer!   Feckle, Feckle, Feckle,   Feckle, Feckle, Feckle--\"  It went on and on. Every house on the block had faces staring out of windows by then. The voice was not merely loud; it was nearly deafening.  Burckhardt shouted to his wife, over the uproar, \"What the hell is a Feckle Freezer?\"  \"Some kind of a freezer, I guess, dear,\" she shrieked back unhelpfully.         *       *       *       *       *  Abruptly the noise stopped and the truck stood silent. It was still misty morning; the Sun's rays came horizontally across the rooftops. It was impossible to believe that, a moment ago, the silent block had been bellowing the name of a freezer.  \"A crazy advertising trick,\" Burckhardt said bitterly. He yawned and turned away from the window. \"Might as well get dressed. I guess that's the end of--\"  The bellow caught him from behind; it was almost like a hard slap on the ears. A harsh, sneering voice, louder than the arch-angel's trumpet, howled:  \"Have you got a freezer? _It stinks!_ If it isn't a Feckle Freezer, _it stinks_! If it's a last year's Feckle Freezer, _it stinks_! Only this year's Feckle Freezer is any good at all! You know who owns an Ajax Freezer? Fairies own Ajax Freezers! You know who owns a Triplecold Freezer? Commies own Triplecold Freezers! Every freezer but a brand-new Feckle Freezer _stinks_!\"  The voice screamed inarticulately with rage. \"I'm warning you! Get out and buy a Feckle Freezer right away! Hurry up! Hurry for Feckle! Hurry for Feckle! Hurry, hurry, hurry, Feckle, Feckle, Feckle, Feckle, Feckle, Feckle....\"  It stopped eventually. Burckhardt licked his lips. He started to say to his wife, \"Maybe we ought to call the police about--\" when the speakers erupted again. It caught him off guard; it was intended to catch him off guard. It screamed:  \"Feckle, Feckle, Feckle, Feckle, Feckle, Feckle, Feckle, Feckle. Cheap freezers ruin your food. You'll get sick and throw up. You'll get sick and die. Buy a Feckle, Feckle, Feckle, Feckle! Ever take a piece of meat out of the freezer you've got and see how rotten and moldy it is? Buy a Feckle, Feckle, Feckle, Feckle, Feckle. Do you want to eat rotten, stinking food? Or do you want to wise up and buy a Feckle, Feckle, Feckle--\"  That did it. With fingers that kept stabbing the wrong holes, Burckhardt finally managed to dial the local police station. He got a busy signal--it was apparent that he was not the only one with the same idea--and while he was shakingly dialing again, the noise outside stopped.  He looked out the window. The truck was gone.         *       *       *       *       *  Burckhardt loosened his tie and ordered another Frosty-Flip from the waiter. If only they wouldn't keep the Crystal Cafe so _hot_! The new paint job--searing reds and blinding yellows--was bad enough, but someone seemed to have the delusion that this was January instead of June; the place was a good ten degrees warmer than outside.  He swallowed the Frosty-Flip in two gulps. It had a kind of peculiar flavor, he thought, but not bad. It certainly cooled you off, just as the waiter had promised. He reminded himself to pick up a carton of them on the way home; Mary might like them. She was always interested in something new.  He stood up awkwardly as the girl came across the restaurant toward him. She was the most beautiful thing he had ever seen in Tylerton. Chin-height, honey-blonde hair and a figure that--well, it was all hers. There was no doubt in the world that the dress that clung to her was the only thing she wore. He felt as if he were blushing as she greeted him.  \"Mr. Burckhardt.\" The voice was like distant tomtoms. \"It's wonderful of you to let me see you, after this morning.\"  He cleared his throat. \"Not at all. Won't you sit down, Miss--\"  \"April Horn,\" she murmured, sitting down--beside him, not where he had pointed on the other side of the table. \"Call me April, won't you?\"  She was wearing some kind of perfume, Burckhardt noted with what little of his mind was functioning at all. It didn't seem fair that she should be using perfume as well as everything else. He came to with a start and realized that the waiter was leaving with an order for _filets mignon_ for two.  \"Hey!\" he objected.  \"Please, Mr. Burckhardt.\" Her shoulder was against his, her face was turned to him, her breath was warm, her expression was tender and solicitous. \"This is all on the Feckle Corporation. Please let them--it's the _least_ they can do.\"  He felt her hand burrowing into his pocket.  \"I put the price of the meal into your pocket,\" she whispered conspiratorially. \"Please do that for me, won't you? I mean I'd appreciate it if you'd pay the waiter--I'm old-fashioned about things like that.\"  She smiled meltingly, then became mock-businesslike. \"But you must take the money,\" she insisted. \"Why, you're letting Feckle off lightly if you do! You could sue them for every nickel they've got, disturbing your sleep like that.\"         *       *       *       *       *  With a dizzy feeling, as though he had just seen someone make a rabbit disappear into a top hat, he said, \"Why, it really wasn't so "]]]
