Balfe had pianos carried up to the sleeping rooms of great singers before they got out of bed, and thus made them listen to his newly composed tunes. He sometimes announced himself by the titles of his famous tunes, as, \"We May Be Happy Yet,\" and was admitted, and received as readily as if he had resorted to pasteboard politeness.  In short, Balfe was never a great musician, yet he had all the eccentricities that one might expect a great musician to have, and he succeeded quite as well as if he had had genius.

First sung at London, England, Her Majesty's Theatre, Drury Lane, Nov. 27, 1843.   ACT I  Many years ago, when noblemen, warriors, gipsies, lovers, enemies and all sorts and conditions of men fraternized without drawing very fine distinctions except when it came to levying taxes, a company of rich nobles met in the gardens of the Count Arnheim to go hunting together. The Count was the Governor of Presburg, and a very popular man, except with his inferiors.  They began their day's sport with a rather highfalutin song sung by the Count's retainers:       \"Up with the banner and down with the slave,        Who shall dare dispute the right,      Wherever its folds in their glory wave,        Of the Austrian eagle's flight?\"  The verses were rather more emotional than intelligent, but the singers were all in good spirits and prepared for a fine day's sport.  After this preliminary all the party--among whom was the young daughter of the Count, whose name was Arline, and a girlie sort of chap, Florestein, who was the Count's nephew--came from the castle, with huntsmen and pages in their train; and what with pages running about, and the huntsmen's bright colours, and the horns echoing, and the horses that one must feel were just without, stamping with impatience to be off, it was a gay scene. The old Count was in such high feather that he, too, broke into song and, while singing that       \"Bugles shake the air,\"  he caught up his little daughter in his arms and told how dear she was to him. It was not a proper thing for so young a girl to go on a hunt, but Arline was a spoiled young countess. When a huntsman handed a rifle to Florestein, that young man shuddered and rejected it--which left one to wonder just what he was going to do at a hunt without a rifle, but the others were less timid, and all separated to go to their various posts, Arline going by a foot-path in charge of a retainer.  These gay people had no sooner disappeared than a handsome young fellow, dishevelled, pursued, rushed into the garden. He looked fearfully behind him, and stopped to get his breath.  \"I can run no farther,\" he gasped, looking back upon the road he had come; and then suddenly at his side, he saw a statue of the Austrian Emperor. He was even leaning against it.  \"Here I am, in the very midst of my foes!--a statue of the Emperor himself adorning these grounds!\" and he became even more alarmed. While he stood thus, hesitating what to do next, a dozen dusky forms leaped the wall of the garden and stood looking at him. Thaddeus was in a soldier's dress and looked like a soldier. Foremost among the newcomers, who huddled together in brilliant rags, was a great brigand-looking fellow, who seemed to lead the band.  \"Hold on! before we undertake to rob this chap, let us make sure of what we are doing,\" he cautioned the others. \"If he is a soldier, we are likely to get the worst of it\"--showing that he had as much wisdom as bravado. After a moment's hesitation they decided that caution was the better part of valour, and since it was no harm to be a gipsy, and there was a penalty attached to being a robber, they nonchalantly turned suspicion from themselves by beginning to sing gaily of their gipsy life. Frequently when they had done this, they had received money for it. If they mayn't rob this soldier chap, at least he might be generous and toss them a coin. During this time, Thaddeus was not napping. The Austrian soldiery were after him, and at best he could not expect to be safe long. The sight of the vagabonds inspired him with hope, although to most folks they would have seemed to be a rather uninspiring and hopeless lot. He went up to the leader, Devilshoof:  \"My friend, I have something to say to you. I am in danger. You seem to be a decent sort--gay and friendly enough. The Austrian soldiers are after me. I am an exile from Poland. If I am caught, my life will be forfeited. I am young and you may count upon my good will. If you will take me along with you as one of you, I may stand a chance of escaping with my life--what do you say?\"  The gipsies stared at him; and Devilshoof did so in no unfriendly manner. The leader was a good-natured wanderer, whose main fault was stealing--but that was a fault he shared in common with all gipsies. He was quite capable of being a good friend.  \"Just who are you?\" he asked, wanting a little more information.  \"A man without country, friends, hope--or money.\"  \"Well, you seem able to qualify as a gipsy pretty well. So come along.\" Just as he spoke, another gipsy, who was reconnoitering, said softly:  \"Soldiers are coming----\"  \"Good--we'll give them something to do. Here, friend, we'll get ready for them,\" he cried, delighted with the new adventure.  At that the gipsies fell to stripping off Thaddeus's soldier clothes, and exchanging them for a gipsy's smock; but as this was taking place, a roll of parchment fell at Devilshoof's feet.  \"What's this?\" he asked, taking it up.  \"It is my commission as a soldier of Poland--the only thing I have of value in the world. I shall never part with it,\" and Thaddeus snatched it and hid it in his dress and then mixed with the gipsies just as the Emperor's soldiers came up.  \"Ho, there! You vagabonds--have you seen anything of a stranger who has passed this way?\"  \"What--a Polish soldier?\"  \"That's our man.\"  \"Young?\"  \"Yes, yes--where did he go?\"  \"A handsome fellow?\"  \"Have done there, and answer--where did he go?\"  \"I guess that may be the one?\" Devilshoof reflected, consulting his comrades with a deliberation which made the officer wish to run his sword through him.  \"Speak up--or----\"  \"Yes, yes--that's right--we have the right man! Up those rocks there,\" pointing. \"That is the way he went. I shouldn't wonder if you might catch him.\"  The officer didn't wait to hear any more of this elaborate instruction, but rushed away with his men.  \"Now, comrade,\" Devilshoof said to Thaddeus: \"It is time for us to be off, while our soldier friends are enjoying the hunt. Only you lie around here while we explore a little; this gipsy life means a deal of wear and tear, if a fellow would live. There is likely to be something worth picking up about the castle, and after we have done the picking, we'll all be off.\"  As the gipsies and Thaddeus went away, the huntsmen rushed on, shouting to each other, and sounding their horns. Florestein came along in their wake. He was about the last man on earth to go on a hunt. He made this known without any help, by singing:       Is no succour near at hand?        For my intellect so reels,      I am doubtful if I stand        On my head or on my heels.      No gentleman, it's very clear,        Such a shock should ever know,      And when once I become a peer,      They shall not treat me so----  That seemed to suggest that something serious had happened, but no one knew what till Thaddeus and a crowd of peasants rushed wildly in.  \"The Count's child, Arline, is attacked by an infuriated animal, and we fear she is killed,\"--that is what Florestein had been bemoaning, instead of hurrying to the rescue! The Count Arnheim ran in then, distraught with horror. But Thaddeus had not remained idle; he had rushed after the huntsmen. Presently he hurried back, bearing the child in his arms. The retainer whose business it was to care for Arline fell at the Count's feet.  \"Oh, great sir, just as we were entering the forest a wild deer rushed at us, and only for the bravery of this young gipsy,\"--indicating Thaddeus--\"the child would have been torn in pieces. As it is, she is wounded in the arm.\"  The Count took his beloved daughter in his arms.  \"Her life is safe and the wound is not serious, thank God. Take her within and give her every care. And you, young man--you will remain with us and share our festivities--and ask of me anything that you will: I can never repay this service.\"  \"Humph! Thaddeus is a fool,\" Devilshoof muttered. \"First he served his enemy and now has to stand his enemy's thanks.\"  Thaddeus refused at first to remain, but when his refusal seemed to draw too much attention to the gipsy band, he consented, as a matter of discretion. So they all seated themselves at the table which had been laid in the garden, and while they were banqueting, the gipsies and peasants danced to add to the sport; and little Arline could be seen in the nurse's arms, at a window of the castle, watching the fun, her arm bound up.  \"Now,\" cried the old Count, when the banquet was over, \"I ask one favour of all--and that is that you drink to the health of our great Emperor.\" He rose and lifted his glass, assuming that all would drink. But that was a bit too much for Thaddeus! The Emperor was the enemy of Poland. Most certainly he would not drink--not even to save his life.  Florestein, who was always doing everything but what he ought, walked up to Thaddeus and pointed out his "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28711"],["title","Operas Every Child Should Know (#2)"],["body","to him.  \"Your fine acquaintance, uncle, is not overburdened with politeness, it seems to me. He does not respond to your wishes.\"  \"What--does he not drink to the Emperor? My friend, I challenge you to drink this health.\" The old Count filled Thaddeus's glass and handed it to him.  \"And thus I accept the challenge,\" Thaddeus cried; and before Devilshoof or any one else could stop him, the reckless chap went up to the statue of the Emperor and dashed the wine in its face.  This was the signal for a great uproar. The man who has dared insult the Emperor must be punished. The nobles made a dash for him, but the old Count was under an obligation too great to abandon Thaddeus yet. He tried to silence the enraged guests for a moment, and then said aside to Thaddeus:  \"Go, I beg of you, your life is not worth a breath if you remain here. I cannot protect you--and indeed I ought not. Go at once,\" and he threw Thaddeus a purse of gold, meaning thus to reward him, and get him away quickly. Thaddeus immediately threw the purse amidst the nobles who were threatening him, and shouted:  \"I am one whom gold cannot reward!\" At that the angry men rushed upon him, but Devilshoof stood shoulder to shoulder with Thaddeus.  \"Now, then, good folks, come on! I guess together we can give you a pretty interesting fight, if it's fighting you are after!\" A scrimmage was just in Devilshoof's line, and once and forever he declared himself the champion of his new comrade.  \"Really, this is too bad,\" Florestein whimpered, standing at the table with the bone of a pheasant in one hand and a glass of wine in the other. \"Just as a man is enjoying his dinner, a boor like this comes along and interrupts him.\" But by that time the fight was on, and Thaddeus and Devilshoof were against the lot. The old Count ordered his retainers to separate the nobles and the gipsies, and then had Devilshoof bound and carried into the castle. Thaddeus was escorted off by another path.  The row was over and the nobles seated themselves again at the table. The nurse, who had Arline at the window, now left her nursling and came down to speak with the Count.  Immediately after she left the castle chamber, Devilshoof could be seen scrambling over the castle roof, having escaped from the room in which he was confined. Reaching the window where Arline was left, he closed it. The nurse had been gone only a moment, when she reëntered the room. Whatever had taken place in her absence caused her to scream frightfully. The whole company started up again, while the nurse threw open the window and leaned out, crying:  \"Arline is gone--stolen--help, help!\" All dashed into the castle. Presently some of the nobles came to the window and motioned to those left outside. It was quite true. Arline was gone. Out they all rushed again. Every one in the place had gone distracted. The poor old Count's grief was pitiable. At that moment Devilshoof could be seen triumphantly mounting the rocks, with Arline in his arms. He had avenged his comrade Thaddeus.  All at once the crowd saw the great gipsy leaping from rock to rock with the little child in his arms, and with a roar they started after him. Then Devilshoof seemed fairly to fly over the rocks, but the crowd gained upon him, till they reached a bridge which spanned a deep chasm; there Devilshoof paused; he was over, and with one tremendous effort he knocked from under the structure the trunk of a tree which supported the far end of the bridge, and down it went! The fall of timbers echoed back with Devilshoof's shout of laughter as he sped up the mountain with Arline.  The old Count ran to the chasm to throw himself headlong into it, but his friends held him back.   ACT II  Twelve years after that day of the hunt in Count Arnheim's forests, the gipsies were encamped in Presburg. In those strange times gipsies roved about in the cities as well as in the fields and forests, and it was not at all strange to find the same old band encamped thus in the public street of a city. There, the gipsy queen had pitched her tent, and through its open curtains Arline could be seen lying upon a tiger's skin, while Thaddeus, who had never left the band, watched over her. There were houses on the opposite side of the street, and the gipsy queen's tent was lighted only dimly with a lamp that swung at the back, just before some curtains that formed a partition in the tent.  It was all quiet when the city patrol went by, and they had no sooner passed than Devilshoof entered the street, followed by others of the gipsy band, all wrapped in their dark cloaks.  \"The moon is the only one awake now,\" they sang. \"There is some fine business on foot, when the moon herself goes to bed,\" and they all drew their daggers. But Devilshoof, who was a pretty decent fellow, and who didn't believe in killing, whispered:  \"Fie! Fie! When you are going to rob a gentleman, you shouldn't draw a knife on him. He will be too polite to refuse anything you may ask, if you ask politely\"--which was Devilshoof's idea of wit. There was a hotel across the street, and one of the gipsies pointed to a light in its windows.  \"It will be easy when our fine gentlemen have been drinking long enough. They won't know their heads from their heels.\" They stole off chuckling, to wait till they imagined every one to be asleep, but they were no sooner gone than Florestein, that funny little fop who never had thought of anything more serious than his appearance, reeled out of the hotel. He was dressed all in his good clothes, and wore golden chains about his neck--to one of which was attached a fine medallion. Rings glittered on his fingers, and altogether, with his plumes and furbelows, he was precisely the sort of thing Devilshoof and his companions were looking for. He was so very drunk that he could not imagine what a fool he was making of himself, and so he began to sing:       Wine, wine, if I am heir,        To the count, my uncle's line;        Wine, wine, wine,      Where's the fellow will dare        To refuse his nephew wine?  This excellent song was punctuated by hiccoughs. There was another stanza which rebuked the boldness of the moon--in short, mentioned the shortcomings of most people compared to this elegant fellow's. Altogether, he was a very funny joke to the gipsies who were waiting for him and peering and laughing from round a corner as he sang. Then Devilshoof went up to him with mock politeness. He bowed very seriously.       My ear caught not the clock's last chime,      And might I beg to ask the time?  Florestein, even though he was drunk, was half alive to his danger. He hadn't enough courage to survive a sudden sneeze. So he braced up a little and eyed Devilshoof:       If the bottle has prevailed,      Yet whenever I'm assailed,      Though there may be nothing in it,      I am sobered in a minute.  One could see that this was quite true. Florestein was a good deal worried. He took out his watch, and assured Devilshoof that it was quite late.       I am really grieved to see        Any one in such a state,      And gladly will take the greatest care        Of the rings and chains you chance to wear,  Devilshoof said still more politely; and bowing all of the time he removed the ornaments from Florestein's person.       What I thought was politeness, is downright theft,      And at this rate I soon shall have nothing left,  the unfortunate dandy moaned, clutching his gewgaws hopelessly, while all the gipsies beset him, each taking all he could for himself. But Devilshoof having secured the medallion, made off with it. He was no sooner gone than a dark woman wrapped in a cloak came into the street and, when she was right in the midst of the squabble, she dropped her cloak and revealed herself as Queen of the band. All the gipsies were amazed and not very comfortable either!--because, strange to say, this gipsy queen did not approve of the maraudings of her band; and when she caught them at thievery she punished them.  \"Return those things you have stolen,\" she commanded, and they made haste to do so, while the trembling Florestein took a hurried inventory of his property. But among the things returned, he didn't find the medallion.  \"I'm much obliged to you, Madame, whoever you are, but I'd like a medallion that they have taken, returned.\"  \"That belongs to the chief--Devilshoof,\" they cried.  \"I'll answer for your safety,\" the Queen said to Florestein, who was not overmuch reassured by this, but still tried to make the best of things. \"Now follow me,\" she called the band, and went, holding Florestein and dragging him with her.  They had no sooner gone than Arline, who had been awakened by the noise outside the tent, came out into the street. Thaddeus followed her. She was greatly disturbed.  \"Thaddeus,\" she said, \"I have had a strange dream\":  [Music:       I dreamt that I dwelt in marble halls,        With vassals and serfs at my side,      And of all who assembled within those walls,        That I was the joy and the pride.]       I had riches too great to count;--could boast        Of a high ancestral name;      But I also dreamt (which pleased me most)        That you loved me still the same.       I dreamt that suitors sought my hand,        That knights upon bended knee      And with vows no maiden heart could withstand        They pledged their faith to me.       And I dreamt that one of that noble host        Came forth my hand to claim,      But I also dreamt (which pleased me most)        That you loved me still the same.  When she had ceased to sing, Thaddeus embraced her tenderly and assured her that he should love her always, \"still the same.\"  Arline had often been troubled because of some difference between herself and the gipsies, and she had also been curious about a scar which was upon her arm. So upon that night she questioned Thaddeus about this, and he told her of the accident in the forest twelve years before, when she got the wound upon her arm."]]]
