From his monastic life onwards Gregory seems to have suffered from bad health, due in part, probably, to his extreme asceticism while living in his monastery. During the last few years of his life he was in continual pain from gout, which makes his activity and his achievements still more astonishing. For long he was confined to his bed altogether. He died on March 12th, 604. In contrast to the enthusiasm with which his accession to the Papacy was greeted, he was now accused by the fickle population of having caused the famine, which was then raging, by his lavish expenditure, though the latter was largely due to the charitable relief which he habitually gave to alleviate the distress which prevailed all the time that he filled the Papal chair. But he was canonized after his death by universal consent in the West, and the Council of Cloveshoo, in 747, fixed the 12th of March for his veneration: \"That the birthday of the blessed Pope Gregory, and also the day of the burial of St. Augustine the Archbishop and Confessor (who being sent to the English by the said Pope, our father Gregory, first brought the knowledge of the Faith, the sacrament of Baptism, and the notice of the Heavenly Country), which is the 26th of May, be honourably observed by all: so that each day be kept with a cessation from labour, by ecclesiastics and monastics; and that the name of our blessed father and doctor Augustine be always mentioned in singing the Litany after the invocation of St. Gregory.\"     [Illustration: St. Gregory, from Antiphoner of Hartker of St. Gall]                                        THE                           GREGORIAN TRADITION.   The tradition that St. Gregory reformed the Plainsong of his day, especially that of the Antiphonale Missarum, seems to have been held universally till 1675, when Pierre Gussanville brought out an edition of Gregory's works, in which he threw doubts on the tradition. He was followed in 1729 by George, Baron d' Eckhart, a friend of Leibnitz, who put forward the theory that it was Gregory II., and not Gregory I., who had done this work. In 1772, at Venice, a new edition of Gregory's works was published by Gallicciolli; and in this were reproduced the arguments of Eckhart, leaving the question open for future investigation. Nothing more was heard of the theory till 1882, when, at the Congress of Arezzo, some speakers reproduced the doubts of Eckhart and Gallicciolli.  This did not attract much attention at the time, and the question was again reopened in 1890 by M. Gevaert in a lecture given in the presence of the Académie and of the King of the Belgians. The earlier \"doubters\" had argued the question from a purely historical standpoint: M. Gevaert lays stress especially on the musical side of the question. Theirs was chiefly negative; he proposes a theory of his own. He wishes to substitute Gregory II. or III. for Gregory I. The traditional view has been upheld against him by Dom Morin, Dr. Peter Wagner, and Rev. W. H. Frere.  _The Historical Evidence_ may be summarized as follows, working backwards from a time when the Gregorian tradition was in existence beyond all question:--    I.--John the Deacon (_c._ 872), _Vita St. Gregorii, lib._ II., _cap._   vi., _Antiphonarium Centonizans, Cantorum Constituit Scholam_. \"In the   house of the Lord, like a most wise Solomon, knowing the compunction   which the sweetness of music inspires, he compiled for the sake of the   singers the collection called 'Antiphoner,' which is of so great   usefulness. He founded also the School of Singers who to this day   perform the sacred chant in the Holy Roman Church according to   instructions received from him. He assigned to it several estates, and   had two houses built for it, one situated at the foot of the steps of   the Church of the Apostle St. Peter, the other in the neighbourhood of   the buildings of the patriarchal palace of the Lateran. There to-day   are still shown the couch on which he reposed while giving his singing   lessons; and the whip with which he threatened the boys is still   preserved and venerated as a relic, as well as his authentic   Antiphoner. By a clause inserted in his deed of gift, he laid down   under pain of anathema that these estates should be divided between the   two portions of the School in payment for the daily service.\"--(_Patr.   Lat._, lxxv., 90.)  This extract may be taken to prove that--    1. In 872 at Rome Gregory I. was believed to be the author of the   Antiphoner which bears his name.    2. The Schola Cantorum looked upon Gregory I. as its founder and   endower.    3. The Schola was still believed to possess his \"authenticum   Antiphonarium\" and certain other objects connected in the popular mind   with the memory of what Gregory had done for the cause of the   ecclesiastical chant.  It is certainly an important point that the Schola itself attributed its foundation to Gregory I. Such a tradition would be carefully preserved in an important corporation like this.  A further witness to the existence of St. Gregory's couch is to be found in _Notitia Ecclesiarum Urbis Romæ_, an itinerary assigned by de Rossi to the seventh century, (de Rossi, _Rom. Sot._, _vol._ i., _pp._ 138-143.)    II.--Pope Leo IV. (847-855) to the Abbot Honoratus, _Ex registro Leonis   IIII_. \"There is something quite incredible, the sound of which has   reached our ears: a thing which, if true, tends rather to diminish our   consideration than to give it honour, to obscure it rather than to give   it lustre. It appears in short that you feel nothing but aversion for   the beautiful chant of St. Gregory, and for the manner of singing and   reading laid down and taught by him in the Church, so that you are in   disagreement on this point not only with the Holy See, which is near to   you, but also with almost the whole Western Church, with all who use   Latin to offer their praises to the Eternal King and pay Him the   tribute of harmonious sounds.    \"All these Churches have received with so much eagerness and ardent   affection this tradition of Gregory, and after having received it   unreservedly they find so much pleasure in it, that even now they apply   to us for more of it, thinking that perhaps something more which they   do not know of, may have been preserved among us. This Holy Pope   Gregory, a servant of God and a famous preacher and a wise pastor, who   did so much for the welfare of mankind, he it was who also composed   this chant, which we sing in the Church and everywhere, with great   pains and with a complete knowledge of the musical art. He wished by   this means to act more powerfully upon men's hearts in order to arouse   and touch them; and in fact the sound of his sweet melodies has   gathered in the Churches not merely spiritual men, but also those who   are less cultivated and sensitive.    \"I pray you not to allow yourself to remain in disagreement either with   this Church, which is the chief head of religion, and from which no one   wishes to stray, or with all those Churches of which we have spoken, if   you love to live in complete peace and concord with the Universal   Church. For if--which we do not believe--your aversion for our   instruction and for the tradition of our holy Pontiff is such that you   are not willing to conform in every point to our rite, both in chants   and lessons, know that we will repel you from our communion; for it is   fitting and healthful for you to follow the usages for which the Roman   Church, mother of all and mistress of you, shows such great love and   invincible attachment. For this reason we order you, under pain of   excommunication, to conform in the Churches both in singing and reading   exclusively to the order instituted by the Holy Pope Gregory and   followed by us, and without fail to practise and sing it in future with   the utmost zeal. For if--which we cannot believe--anyone shall attempt   by any means whatever to turn you from the right path by leading you to   a tradition other than that which we have just prescribed to you for   the present and the future, we not only order that he be deprived of   partaking of the Holy Body and Blood of our Lord Jesus Christ, but in   virtue of our proper authority and that of all our predecessors, we   decree that in punishment of his audacity and presumption he remain   under a perpetual anathema.\"--(_Cod. Brit. Mus._, _add._ 8873, _fol._   168.)  Pope Leo, the author of this letter, had himself been a pupil at this same monastery of St. Martin. From thence also the priest John, the Precentor of St. Peter's, had set out 200 years before to teach the English the system of chanting and reading followed at St. Peter's.  The above extract throws an important light on the progress of the Gregorian reform of the ecclesiastical chant. In the latter half of the ninth century a powerful monastery close to Rome had not yet adopted it. Compare with this fact the presence of the Ambrosian chant in the province of Capua in the middle of the eleventh century (Kienle, in _Studien und Mittheilungen des Benedictiner und Cistercienser-Orden_, 1884, _p._ 346), and the Ambrosian rubrics of various books copied a little later for churches at Rome itself (_Tomasi, Opp. vol._ vii., _pp._ 9 _&_ 10), and it will be seen how gradually the Gregorian books attained their universal supremacy.    III.--Hildemar (between 833 and 850), author of a commentary on the   Rule of St. Bennet, speaks of St. Gregory as the composer of the \"Roman   Office\": \"Beatus Gregorius qui dicitur Romanum Officium fecisse.\"   (_Expositio Regula ab Hildemaro tradita_, _p._ 311, _Ratisbon_, 1880.)    IV.--Walafrid Strabo (807-849). _De Ecclesiasticarum rerum exordiis et   incrementis_ (composed about 840). \"The tradition is that St. Gregory,   just as he regulated the order of the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31582"],["title","St. Gregory and the Gregorian Music (#2)"],["body","and of consecrations   [_i.e._, the Sacramentary and the Pontifical Rituale] so also had the   greatest part in the arrangement of the liturgical chants, following   the order which is observed to this day as the most fitting: as is   commemorated at the head of the Antiphoner.\" (_Op. cit. c._ xxi.,   _Patr. Lat._, cxiv., 948.)        [Illustration: St. Gregory, from MS. of Coronation Services]  This refers, strictly speaking, to the Antiphonale Missarum. But the following extract treats directly of the chants of the office contained in the _Liber Responsorialis_, or corresponding volume for the hour services.    \"As for the chants for use at the different hours, whether of the day   or of the night, it is believed that it was St. Gregory who assigned to   them their complete arrangement, just as he had already done, as we   have said, for the Sacramentary.\" (_c._ xxv., 958.)  These two passages establish the fact that there was a tradition in the middle of the ninth century that St. Gregory set in order the ecclesiastical music. It seems also that there was an inscription at the beginning of the Antiphoner stating as a fact that he had done this. The following extract helps us to identify what this inscription was.    V.--Agobard of Lyons (779-840). _Liber de Correctione Antiphonarii_,   _c._ xv., _Patr. Lat._ civ., 336. \"But because the inscription serving   for title to the book in question [_i.e._, the Antiphoner] puts in the   forefront the name of 'Gregorius Præsul,' thereupon some people imagine   that the work was composed by the Blessed Gregory, Pope of Rome and   illustrious doctor.\"  He is here defending the chant of Lyons against the ultramontane efforts of Amalarius to introduce the Roman ways. He goes on to try to prove that the Antiphoner defended by Amalarius cannot be St. Gregory's, because he had forbidden the use of words not taken directly from Scripture.  VI.--Amalarius of Metz (815-835) is undoubtedly the person who played the foremost part in the fusion of the Gallican element with the rest of the Gregorian or Gelasian Liturgy, from which combination has come in substance the Roman Liturgy in use to-day. He had travelled much, and had been at Rome. He is a weighty authority in the present question. The following extracts are taken from a supplementary chapter of his _De Divinis Officiis_, published by Mabillon, in his _Vetera Analecta_ (_Paris_, 1723). He is speaking of the Pope Gregory who is the author of the Dialogues, and who sent St. Augustine into England.    \"Amongst the monks who have been raised to the Supreme Pontificate can   be cited Denys, and Gregory of incomparable memory. Now Gregory,   amongst many other things by which he furthered the advantage of the   Church, had the glory of being the chief organizer of the Office for   clerical use.\" (_p._ 93.)    \"In the time of St. Bennet the whole order of psalmody had not yet been   fixed with precision in the Psalter and the Antiphoner: it was the   incomparable Pope Gregory of holy memory, himself a zealous observer of   the rule of St. Bennet and an imitator of his monastic perfection, who   afterwards regulated the arrangement of it under the direction of the   Holy Spirit.\" (_pp._ 93-4.)    \"Far from blaming those who preserve the Gregorian usage, they should   rather praise them.\" (_p._ 94.)    \"In the authentic model of St. Gregory, the _Alleluia_ and the _Gloria_   are suppressed at the Mass for Innocents' Day, in order to express the   grief of the mothers or of the Church.\" (_p._ 96.)  Amalarius was commissioned by Louis the Debonair to procure at Rome a copy of the Antiphoner to serve as a model for an uniform use in place of the varying uses then to be found. The Pope in answer to his request replied, \"I have no Antiphoner that I can send to my son and lord the Emperor. Those which we had, were taken to France by Wala, Abbot of Corbie, when he came here on a mission.\" On his return to France, Amalarius went to Corbie, where he found the four volumes brought by Wala. They contained an inscription saying that this collection was put in order by Pope Adrian I. But he found that they differed from the books at Metz, which were older still; so in despair he made a compilation of his own, taking from each what seemed to him the best.  Now it has been argued that if these Antiphoners had either of them borne the name of Gregory the Great, Amalarius would not have had the audacity to alter them in this manner, nor would he if there had existed anywhere in Gaul any bearing his name. But this idea has arisen from the confusion attending the name \"antiphoner.\" The book that Amalarius was dealing with was not the Antiphoner for Mass, but the Antiphoner for Divine Service. There were great variations in the latter in different localities down to the reform by Pius V., far more than in the former. When the \"famous authentic model of Gregory\" is spoken of, it is the Antiphonale Missarum which is meant.    VII.--Amalarius, Bishop of Trèves (809-814). _Liber Officiorum_, from a   MS. at Trèves, quoted by Morin, _fol._ 6, _De Missa Innocentium_. \"The   Mass of the Innocents begins in the Diurnal with this Rubric: '_Gloria   in Excelsis Deo_ is not sung, nor _Alleluia_, unless it be Sunday; this   day is passed in a sort of sadness.' The Holy Pope Gregory, in whom   dwelt in very truth the Holy Ghost, and to whom is due the composition   of this office, means us to share the feelings of the pious women who   bewailed and lamented the death of the Innocents. And if it is   permitted to transgress the order of so great a Father, it would   equally be lawful to chant Alleluia with the complete office of the day   on Good Friday.\"      It is a question here of the Antiphoner of the Mass.    (_fol._ 7.) On the day of the Epiphany \"we lose one of the chants which   we have at Christmas, viz., the Invitatory. St. Gregory, the organizer   of the offices, meant by this peculiarity to recall to our memory as   strongly as he could what passed formerly at the time of the   accomplishment of the mysteries which we honour. That is why we chant   in the sixth place the psalm which we had avoided in the beginning. It   is true that certain blunderers treat this with indifference and   contempt, thinking it much better to follow the ordinary usage of each   day. But, as we have already said, he wished by this to distinguish\"   &c., &c.      This passage refers to the Antiphoner of the Office.    (_fol._ 9-10.) \"That is why Gregory, the author of our office, has   placed Septuagesima.... However, Gregory the institutor of our   office....\"      It is a question of the Antiphoner and of the Sacramentary.    (_fol._ 39.) \"The author of our office, who is none other than   Gregory....\"      He is referring to a portion of the Antiphoner of the Mass.  In the following passage Amalarius distinguishes the work of the two first Gregories as to the Thursdays in Lent.    (_fol._ 102.) \"The Holy Pope Gregory in arranging the offices of the   year had left vacant the Thursdays of Lent.... A long time after him   another Pope, Gregory the younger, ordained that these days should also   be celebrated by Masses and Prayers, but with less solemnity, and he   borrowed wherever he could material to form the offices of these   Thursdays.\"    VIII.--Pope Adrian I. (772-795). A MS. from Saint Martial de Limoges   contains this passage (_Paris, Bibl. Nat., No._ 2400.) \"Adrian II.,   after the example of his predecessor of the same name, completed the   Gregorian Antiphoner in several places. He also arranged a second   prologue in hexameter verse to be chanted at High Mass on the first day   of Advent. This prologue begins in the same way as another very short   one composed by the first Adrian to be sung at all the Masses of this   first Sunday in Advent, but that of Adrian II. is composed of a greater   number of verses.\"  We have seen the passage in which Walafrid Strabo speaks of the inscription at the beginning of the Antiphoner, ascribing its origin to Gregory I., and again that in which Agobard of Lyons tells us that the inscription contained the words \"Gregorius Præsul.\" There are five forms extant of the prologue in hexameter verse. The shortest, and therefore the one probably composed by Adrian I., is as follows:--        \"Gregorius Præsul meritis et nomine dignus       Unde genus ducit, summum ascendit honorem.       Renovavit monumenta patrum priorum: tunc       Composuit hunc libellum musicæ artis       Scholæ cantorum anni circuli: Ad te levavi.\"  All the five forms begin with the same two first lines. Eckhart got over the difficulty caused to his theory by these lines by supposing that \"Gregorius Præsul\" meant not Gregory the Great, but Gregory II. But he does not explain how \"Unde genus ducit,\" &c., can refer to the latter. But it fits Gregory I. in this way: Pope Felix was his great-great-grandfather; so that, on succeeding to the papacy, he as it were entered on a family inheritance.  This prologue proves that the Antiphoner was ascribed by tradition to St. Gregory in the latter half of the eighth century.  IX.--Egbert, Archbishop of York (732-766), is a still more important witness. Born about 678, he was ordained deacon at Rome, and received the archiepiscopal pallium from Gregory III. in 735. He was the disciple and friend of Bede, the confidant and benefactor of St. Boniface, and the teacher of Alcuin. Shortly after he became archbishop he composed a work addressed to his brother bishops, and called _De Institutione Catholica_. The following extracts from it refer to the Ember-day Fasts.    \"As for us in the Church of England, we always observe the Fast of the   First Month in the first week of Lent, relying on the authority of our   teacher, St. Gregory, who has thus regulated it in the model which he   has handed down to us in his Antiphoner and his Missal through the   medium of our pedagogue the Blessed Augustine.\" (_Patr. Lat._ lxxxix.,"]]]
