Larry walked up in front of it. \"Isn't that right?\" he demanded. \"Don't you have anything to say?\"  He looked at the face of the clock. It was almost eleven, just a few seconds before the hour. \"All right. I'll wait until eleven. Then I want to hear what you have to say. You've been pretty quiet the last few weeks since she left.\"  He grinned wryly. \"Maybe you don't like it here since she's gone.\" He scowled. \"Well, I paid for you, and you're coming out whether you like it or not. You hear me?\"  Eleven o'clock came. Far off, at the end of town, the great tower clock boomed sleepily to itself. But the little door remained shut. Nothing moved. The minute hand passed on and the cuckoo did not stir. He was someplace inside the clock, beyond the door, silent and remote.  \"All right, if that's the way you feel,\" Larry murmured, his lips twisting. \"But it isn't fair. It's your job to come out. We all have to do things we don't like.\"  He went unhappily into the kitchen and opened the great gleaming refrigerator. As he poured himself a drink he thought about the clock.  There was no doubt about it--the cuckoo should come out, Doris or no Doris. He had always liked her, from the very start. They had got along well, the two of them. Probably he liked Bob too--probably he had seen enough of Bob to get to know him. They would be quite happy together, Bob and Doris and the cuckoo.  Larry finished his drink. He opened the drawer at the sink and took out the hammer. He carried it carefully into the dining-room. The clock was ticking gently to itself on the wall.  \"Look,\" he said, waving the hammer. \"You know what I have here? You know what I'm going to do with it? I'm going to start on you--first.\" He smiled. \"Birds of a feather, that's what you are--the three of you.\"  The room was silent.  \"Are you coming out? Or do I have to come in and get you?\"  The clock whirred a little.  \"I hear you in there. You've got a lot of talking to do, enough for the last three weeks. As I figure it, you owe me--\"  The door opened. The cuckoo came out fast, straight at him. Larry was looking down, his brow wrinkled in thought. He glanced up, and the cuckoo caught him squarely in the eye.  Down he went, hammer and chair and everything, hitting the floor with a tremendous crash. For a moment the cuckoo paused, its small body poised rigidly. Then it went back inside its house. The door snapped tight-shut after it.  The man lay on the floor, stretched out grotesquely, his head bent over to one side. Nothing moved or stirred. The room was completely silent, except, of course, for the ticking of the clock.         *       *       *       *       *  \"I see,\" Doris said, her face tight. Bob put his arm around her, steadying her.  \"Doctor,\" Bob said, \"can I ask you something?\"  \"Of course,\" the doctor said.  \"Is it very easy to break your neck, falling from so low a chair? It wasn't very far to fall. I wonder if it might not have been an accident. Is there any chance it might have been--\"  \"Suicide?\" the doctor rubbed his jaw. \"I never heard of anyone committing suicide that way. It was an accident; I'm positive.\"  \"I don't mean suicide,\" Bob murmured under his breath, looking up at the clock on the wall. \"I meant _something else_.\"  But no one heard him.

Outside, the rain beat upon the roof or ran trickling from the eaves, and every now and then a chill draught of wind would breathe through the open windows of the great black dining-hall and set the fire roaring.  Along the dull-gray wall of stone hung pieces of armor, and swords and lances, and great branching antlers of the stag. Overhead arched the rude, heavy, oaken beams, blackened with age and smoke, and underfoot was a chill pavement of stone.  Upon Baron Conrad’s shoulder leaned the pale, slender, yellow-haired Baroness, the only one in all the world with whom the fierce lord of Drachenhausen softened to gentleness, the only one upon whom his savage brows looked kindly, and to whom his harsh voice softened with love.  The Baroness was talking to her husband in a low voice, as he looked down into her pale face, with its gentle blue eyes.  “And wilt thou not, then,” said she, “do that one thing for me?”  “Nay,” he growled, in his deep voice, “I cannot promise thee never more to attack the towns-people in the valley over yonder. How else could I live an’ I did not take from the fat town hogs to fill our own larder?”  “Nay,” said the Baroness, “thou couldst live as some others do, for all do not rob the burgher folk as thou dost. Alas! mishap will come upon thee some day, and if thou shouldst be slain, what then would come of me?”  “Prut,” said the Baron, “thy foolish fears” But he laid his rough, hairy hand softly upon the Baroness’ head and stroked her yellow hair.  “For my sake, Conrad,” whispered the Baroness.  A pause followed. The Baron sat looking thoughtfully down into the Baroness’ face. A moment more, and he might have promised what she besought; a moment more, and he might have been saved all the bitter trouble that was to follow. But it was not to be.  Suddenly a harsh sound broke the quietness of all into a confusion of noises. Dong! Dong!--it was the great alarm-bell from Melchior’s Tower.  The Baron started at the sound. He sat for a moment or two with his hand clinched upon the arm of his seat as though about to rise, then he sunk back into his chair again.  All the others had risen tumultuously from the table, and now stood looking at him, awaiting his orders.  “For my sake, Conrad,” said the Baroness again.  Dong! Dong! rang the alarm-bell. The Baron sat with his eyes bent upon the floor, scowling blackly.  The Baroness took his hand in both of hers. “For my sake,” she pleaded, and the tears filled her blue eyes as she looked up at him, “do not go this time.”  From the courtyard without came the sound of horses’ hoofs clashing against the stone pavement, and those in the hall stood watching and wondering at this strange delay of the Lord Baron. Just then the door opened and one came pushing past the rest; it was the one-eyed Hans. He came straight to where the Baron sat, and, leaning over, whispered something into his master’s ear.  “For my sake,” implored the Baroness again; but the scale was turned. The Baron pushed back his chair heavily and rose to his feet. “Forward!”  he roared, in a voice of thunder, and a great shout went up in answer as he strode clanking down the hall and out of the open door.  The Baroness covered her face with her hands and wept.  “Never mind, little bird,” said old Ursela, the nurse, soothingly; “he will come back to thee again as he has come back to thee before.”  But the poor young Baroness continued weeping with her face buried in her hands, because he had not done that thing she had asked.  A white young face framed in yellow hair looked out into the courtyard from a window above; but if Baron Conrad of Drachenhausen saw it from beneath the bars of his shining helmet, he made no sign.  “Forward,” he cried again.  Down thundered the drawbridge, and away they rode with clashing hoofs and ringing armor through the gray shroud of drilling rain.  The day had passed and the evening had come, and the Baroness and her women sat beside a roaring fire. All were chattering and talking and laughing but two--the fair young Baroness and old Ursela; the one sat listening, listening, listening, the other sat with her chin resting in the palm of her hand, silently watching her young mistress. The night was falling gray and chill, when suddenly the clear notes of a bugle rang from without the castle walls. The young Baroness started, and the rosy light flashed up into her pale cheeks.  “Yes, good,” said old Ursela; “the red fox has come back to his den again, and I warrant he brings a fat town goose in his mouth; now we’ll have fine clothes to wear, and thou another gold chain to hang about thy pretty neck.”  The young Baroness laughed merrily at the old woman’s speech. “This time,” said she, “I will choose a string of pearls like that one my aunt used to wear, and which I had about my neck when Conrad first saw me.”  Minute after minute passed; the Baroness sat nervously playing with a bracelet of golden beads about her wrist. “How long he stays,” said she.  “Yes,” said Ursela; “but it is not cousin wish that holds him by the coat.”  As she spoke, a door banged in the passageway without, and the ring of iron footsteps sounded upon the stone floor. Clank! Clank! Clank!  The Baroness rose to her feet, her face all alight. The door opened; then the flush of joy faded away and the face grew white, white, white. One hand clutched the back of the bench whereon she had been sitting, the other hand pressed tightly against her side.  It was Hans the one-eyed who stood in the doorway, and black trouble sat on his brow; all were looking at him waiting.  “Conrad,” whispered the Baroness, at last. “Where is Conrad? Where is your master?” and even her lips were white as she spoke.  The one-eyed Hans said nothing.  Just then came the noise of men s voices in the corridor and the shuffle and scuffle of feet carrying a heavy load. Nearer and nearer they came, and one-eyed Hans stood aside. Six men came struggling through the doorway, carrying a litter, and on the litter lay the great Baron Conrad. The flaming torch thrust into the iron bracket against the wall flashed up with the draught of air from the open door, and the light fell upon the white face and the closed eyes, and showed upon his body armor a great red stain that was not the stain of rust.  Suddenly Ursela cried out in a sharp, shrill voice, “Catch her, she falls!”  It was the Baroness.  Then the old crone turned fiercely upon the one-eyed Hans. “Thou fool!”  she cried, “why didst thou bring him here? Thou hast killed thy lady!”  “I did not know,” said the one-eyed Hans, stupidly.     III. How the Baron came Home Shorn.  But Baron Conrad was not dead. For days he lay upon his hard bed, now muttering incoherent words beneath his red beard, now raving fiercely with the fever of his wound. But one day he woke again to the things about him.  He turned his head first to the one side and then to the other; there sat Schwartz Carl and the one-eyed Hans. Two or three other retainers stood by a great window that looked out into the courtyard beneath, jesting and laughing together in low tones, and one lay upon the heavy oaken bench that stood along by the wall snoring in his sleep.  “Where is your lady?” said the Baron, presently; “and why is she not with me at this time?”  The man that lay upon the bench started up at the sound of his voice, and those at the window came hurrying to his bedside. But Schwartz Carl and the one-eyed Hans looked at one another, and neither of them spoke. The Baron saw the look and in it read a certain meaning that brought him to his elbow, though only to sink back upon his pillow again with a groan.  “Why do you not answer me?” said he at last, in a hollow voice; then to the one-eyed Hans, “Hast no tongue, fool, that thou standest gaping there like a fish? Answer me, where is thy mistress?”  “I--I do not know,” stammered poor Hans.  For a while the Baron lay silently looking from one face to the other, then he spoke again. “How long have I been lying here?” said he.  “A sennight, my lord,” said Master Rudolph, the steward, who had come into the room and who now stood among the others at the bedside.  “A sennight,” repeated the Baron, in a low voice, and then to Master Rudolph, “And has the Baroness been often beside me in that time?”  Master Rudolph hesitated. “Answer me,” said the Baron, harshly.  “Not--not often,” said Master Rudolph, hesitatingly.  The Baron lay silent for a long time. At last he passed his hands over his face and held them there for a minute, then of a sudden, before anyone knew what he was about to do, he rose upon his elbow and then sat upright upon the bed. The green wound broke out afresh and a dark red spot grew and spread upon the linen wrappings; his face was drawn and haggard with the pain of his moving, and his eyes wild and bloodshot. Great drops of sweat gathered and stood upon his forehead as he sat there swaying slightly from side to side.  “My shoes,” said he, hoarsely.  Master Rudolph stepped forward. “But, my Lord Baron,” he began and then stopped short, for the Baron shot him such a look that his tongue stood still in his head.  Hans saw that look out of his one eye. Down he dropped upon his knees and, fumbling under the bed, brought forth a pair of soft leathern shoes, which he slipped upon the Baron’s feet and then laced the thongs above the instep.  “Your shoulder,” said the Baron. He rose slowly to his feet, gripping Hans in the stress of his agony until the fellow winced again. For a moment he stood as though gathering strength, then doggedly started forth upon that quest which he had set upon himself.  At the door he stopped for a moment as though overcome by his weakness, and there Master Nicholas, his cousin, met him; for the steward had sent one of the retainers to tell the old man what the Baron was about to do.  “Thou must go back again,"]]]
