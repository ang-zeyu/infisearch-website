The American forests abound in birds; and in those of districts that are distant from the settlements of men, wild turkeys, and several species of grouse are very numerous. In some of the forests of Canada, passenger-pigeons breed in myriads; and, during their periodical flight, from one part of the country to another, their numbers darken the air. The coasts, bays, and rivers, abound in fish; and various species of reptiles and serpents are known to inhabit the interior of the southern districts. Among the mountains most of the important metals are found: iron, lead, and copper, are all abundant; and coals are not uncommon.   THE UNITED STATES.  That part of North America which is under the government of the United States, now constitutes one of the most powerful and most enlightened nations in the world. The inhabitants enjoy the advantage of a vast extent of territory, over which the daily increasing population is able, with facility, to expand itself; and much of this territory, though covered with forests, is capable of being cleared, and many parts of it are every day cleared, for the purposes of cultivation.  The origin of the United States may be dated from the time of the formation of an English colony in Virginia, about the year 1606. Other English colonies were subsequently formed; and, during one hundred and fifty years, these gradually increased in strength and prosperity, till, at length, the inhabitants threw off their dependance upon England, and established an independent republican government. This, after a long and expensive war, was acknowledged by Great Britain, in a treaty signed at Paris on the 30th of November, 1782.  The _boundaries_ of the States were determined by this treaty; but, some important acquisitions of territory have since been made. In April, 1803, _Louisiana_ was ceded to them by France; and this district, in its most limited extent, includes a surface of country, which, with the exception of Russia, is equal to the whole of Europe. _Florida_, by its local position, is connected with the United States: it belonged to Spain, but, in the year 1820, it was annexed to the territories of the republic.  Geographical writers have divided the United States into three regions: the _lowlands_ or flat country; the highlands, and the mountains. Of these, the first extend from the Atlantic ocean to the falls of the great rivers. The _highlands_ reach from the falls to the foot of the mountains; and the _mountains_ stretch nearly through the whole country, in a direction from south-west to north-east. Their length is about 900 miles, and their breadth from 60 to 200. They may be considered as separated into two distinct chains; of which the eastern chain has the name of _Blue Mountains_, and the western is known, at its southern extremity, by the name of _Cumberland_ and _Gauley Mountains_, and afterwards by that of the _Alleghany Mountains_. The Alleghanies are about 250 miles distant from the shore of the Atlantic. Towards the north there are other eminences, called the _Green Mountains_ and the _White Mountains_. The loftiest summits of the whole are said to be about 7000 feet in perpendicular height above the level of the sea.  Few countries can boast a greater general fertility of _soil_ than North America. The soil of the higher lands consists, for the most part, of a brown loamy earth, and a yellowish sandy clay. Marine shells, and other substances, in a fossil state, are found at the depth of eighteen or twenty feet below the surface of the ground. Some of these are of very extraordinary description. In the year 1712, several bones and teeth of a vast nondescript quadruped, were dug up at Albany in the state of New York. By the ignorant inhabitants these were considered to be the remains of gigantic human bodies. In 1799 the bones of other individuals of this animal, which has since been denominated the _Mastodon_ or _American Mammoth_, were discovered beneath the surface of the ground, in the vicinity of Newburgh, on the river Hudson. Induced by the hope of being able to obtain a perfect skeleton, a Mr. Peale, of Philadelphia, purchased these bones, with the right of digging for others. He was indefatigable in his exertions, but was unable, for some time, to procure any more. He made an attempt in a morass about twelve miles distant from Newburgh, where an entire set of ribs was found, but unaccompanied by any other remains. In another morass, in Ulster county, he found several bones; among the rest a complete under jaw, and upper part of the head. From the whole of the fragments that he obtained, he was enabled to form two skeletons. One of these, under the name of mammoth, was exhibited in London, about a year afterwards. Its height at the shoulder was eleven feet; its whole length was fifteen feet; and its weight about one thousand pounds. This skeleton was furnished with large and curved ivory tusks, different in shape from those of an elephant, but similar in quality. In 1817 another skeleton was dug up, from the depth of only four feet, in the town of _Goshen_, near Chester. The tusks of this were more than nine feet in length.  In a region so extensive as the United States, there must necessarily be a great variety of _climate_. In general, the heat of summer and the cold of winter are more intense, and the transitions, from the one to the other, are more sudden than in the old continent. The predominant winds are from the west; and the severest cold is felt from the north-west. Between the forty-second and forty-fifth degrees of latitude, the same parallel as the south of France, the winters are very severe. During winter, the ice of the rivers is sufficiently strong to bear the passage of horses and waggons; and snow is so abundant, as to admit the use of sledges. In Georgia the winters are mild. South Carolina is subject to immoderate heat, to tremendous hurricanes, and to terrific storms of thunder and lightning.  The United States are usually classed in three divisions: the northern, the middle, and the southern. The _northern states_ have the general appellation of _New England_: they are Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Vermont, Connecticut, and Rhode Island. The _middle states_ are New York, New Jersey, Delaware, Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Indiana. The _southern states_ are Maryland, Virginia, Kentucky, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tenessee, and Louisiana.  Besides these, the United States claim the government of the _territories_ of the Illinois, Alabama, and Mississippi. By a public ordinance, passed in the year 1787, a territory cannot be admitted into the American Union, until its population amounts to 60,000 free inhabitants. In the mean time, however, it is subject to a regular provisional form of government. The administration of this is entrusted to a governor, who is appointed by the president and congress of the United States; and who is invested with extensive powers, for protection of the interests of the States, and the observance of a strict faith towards the Indians, in the exchange of commodities, and the purchase of lands.  The _government_ of the United States is denominated a \"Federal Republic.\" Each state has a constitution for the management of its own internal affairs; and, by the federal constitution, they are all formed into one united body. The legislative power is vested in a _congress_ of delegates from the several states; this congress is divided into two distinct bodies, the _senate_ and the _house of representatives_. The members of the latter are elected every two years, by the people; and the senators are elected every six years, by the state legislatures. A senator must be thirty years of age, an inhabitant of the state in which he is elected, and must have been nine years a citizen of the United States: the present number of senators is thirty-eight. The executive power is vested in a _president_, who is chosen every four years. In the election both of members of congress, and of the president of the United States, it is asserted, that there is much manoeuvering, and much corrupt influence exerted. In the electioneering addresses of the defeated parties, these are, perhaps, as often made a subject of complaint and reproach, as they are in those of defeated candidates for the representation of counties or boroughs in the British House of Commons.  Washington is the seat of government; and the president, when there, lives in a house destined for his use, and furnished at the expense of the nation. His annual salary is 25,000 dollars, about Â£.5600 sterling. The president, in virtue of his office, is commander-in-chief of the army and navy of the United States, and also of the militia, whenever it is called into actual service. He is empowered to make treaties, to appoint ambassadors, ministers, consuls, judges of the supreme court, and all military and other officers whose appointments are not otherwise provided for by the law.  The _national council_ is composed of the President and Vice President; and the heads of the treasury, war, navy, and post-office establishment.  The _inhabitants_ of the United States (says Mr. Warden[1]) have not that uniform character which belongs to ancient nations, upon whom, time and the stability of institutions, have imprinted a particular and individual character. The general physiognomy is as varied as its origin is different. English, Irish, Germans, Scotch, French, and Swiss, all retain some characteristic of their ancient country.  The account given by Mr. Birkbeck is somewhat different from this. He asserts that, as far as he had an opportunity of judging, the native inhabitants of the towns are much alike; nine out of ten (he says) are tall and long limbed, approaching or even exceeding six feet. They are seen in pantaloons and Wellington boots; either marching up and down, "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28327"],["title","Continuous Vaudeville (#1)"],["body","Trained Seals. One afternoon Nat, hearing a noise, looked around and there was one of the seals coming out under the curtain behind him. It took Nat just two jumps to get off the stage. An attendant came out and captured the seal. Nat came back. \"Well,\" he said, scratching his head; \"I have followed every animal on earth but a skunk and a lizard, and now I have got that. Humph; Professor Woodward's Trained Shad.

She went in to a drug store and asked the clerk for a headache powder. This clerk was not a first-class drugger; he was just a student; but he knew where the headache powders were, so he got one for her; got his ten cents and started away. Mary looked around; there was no soda fountain, no water tank.  \"Well, here,\" she said; the young man stopped and looked back at her. \"Where am I supposed to take this powder?\"  \"In your mouth, Mam.\"         *       *       *       *       *  One cold, blustery day several of us were sitting in the stage door tender's little room at the Orpheum, Denver, when the door was thrown open and in hurried a boy of fifteen or sixteen.  \"Where's Cressy?\" he asked briskly.  \"Right here,\" I answered in the same manner.  \"I want a sketch.\"  \"All right.\"  \"What do you charge?\"  \"Five hundred dollars.\"  \"Gee Zip!\"  And he was out the door and gone.         *       *       *       *       *  At the Minneapolis Orpheum a chap with a jag came weaving his way out from the auditorium and over to the box-office window.  \"Shay,\" he said thickly; \"wha' do you want to hire such bad acters for? They're rotten.\"  The ticket seller asked which ones he objected to.  \"Why, tha' ol' Rube, and that gal in there; they're rotten.\"  \"What are you talking about?\" said the ticket seller; \"that is Cressy and Dayne; they are the Headliners; they are fine.\"  The man looked at him a moment, as if to see if he really meant it; then he asked earnestly,  \"Hones'ly?\"  \"Certainly.\"  For another moment he studied, then as he turned away, he shook his head sadly and said,  \"I shall never go to another vaudeville show as long as I live.\"     IT'S HARD TO MAKE THE OLD FOLKS BELIEVE IT   We may be Actors and Actresses (with capital \"A's\") to the public; we may have our names in big letters on the billboards and in the programs; but to The Old Folks At Home we are just the same no-account boys and girls we always were. We may be Headliners in New York, Boston, Chicago and San Francisco, but back home we are still just Jimmie and Johnnie and Charlie that \"went on the stage.\"  Charlie Smith, of Smith & Campbell, in his younger days used to drive a delivery wagon for his father's fish market. But tiring of the fish business he started out to be \"a Acter.\" At the end of five years he had reached a point where the team commanded (and sometimes got) a salary of eighty dollars a week. As driver of the fish wagon he had received eight. And he determined to go home and \"show them.\" Dressing the part properly for his \"grand entre\" put a fearful dent in his \"roll\"; so much so that he had to change what remained into one and two dollar bills in order to \"make a flash.\"  But when he struck the old home town he was \"a lily of the valley\"; he had a Prince Albert coat, a silk hat, patent-leather shoes, an almost-gold watch and chain, a pretty-near diamond stud and ring and the roll of ones and twos, with a twenty on the outside.  After supper, sitting around the fire, he started in telling them what a success he was; he told them of all the big theaters he had appeared in; how good the newspapers said he was; what a large salary he received, etc., etc.  All seemed highly impressed; all except Father; finally, after a couple of hours of it, he could contain himself no longer, and burst out--  \"Say, when are you going to stop this dumb fool business and come back and go to driving that wagon again?\"         *       *       *       *       *  Ed Grey, \"the Tall Story Teller,\" went from a small country town on to the stage. It was ten years before he ever came back to play the home town. When he did the whole town turned out _en masse_; the Grey family ditto; after the show the family was seated around the dining-room table, talking it over. Mother sat beside her big boy, proud and happy. The others were discussing the show.  \"That Mister Brown was awful good.\"  \"Oh, but I liked that Blink & Blunk the best.\"  \"That Miss Smith was awful sweet.\"  But not a word did any one have to say about \"Eddie.\" Finally he burst out--  \"Well, how was _I_?\"  There was an ominous pause, and then Mother, reaching over and patting his knee lovingly, said,  \"Now, don't you care, Eddie, as long as you get your money.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Cliff Gordon's father doesn't believe it _yet_. Cliff was playing in New York and stopping at home.  \"Vere you go next veek, Morris?\" asked Father.  \"Orpheum, Brooklyn,\" replied Cliff.  \"How mooch vages do you get dere?\"  \"Three fifty.\"  \"Tree huntret unt fifty tollars?\"  \"Uh huh.\"  Father nodded his head, sighed deeply, thought a minute, then--  \"Then vere do you go?\"  \"Alhambra, New York.\"  \"How mooch?\"  \"Three fifty.\"  \"Then vere?\"  \"Keith's, Philadelphia.\"  \"How mooch you get ofer dere?\"  \"Just the same; three fifty.\"  Father sighed again, thought deeply for a few minutes, then, with another sigh, said, half to himself,  \"Dey can't _all_ be crazy.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Tim McMahon (McMahon & Chapelle) had a mother who did not believe theaters were proper and Tim had a hard time getting her to come to see him at all. But finally she came to see her \"Timmite\" act. It was a big show, ten acts, and Tim was on number nine. After the show was over Tim went around in front of the house to meet her; she came out so indignant she could hardly speak.  \"Why, what's the matter? Wasn't I good?\" asked Tim.  \"Yis, sor, you was; you was as good as iny of them; you was _better_ than any of thim; and they had no right to let thim other eight acts on foreninst ye: _You ought to have come on first, Timmie._\"         *       *       *       *       *  The first time Josephine Sabel's father and mother saw her on the stage she was in the chorus of a comic opera company and was wearing tights. Mother ran out of the theater and Father tried to climb up over the footlights to get at Josephine and got _put_ out.         *       *       *       *       *  Charlie Case had been on the stage for years before he ever got a chance to play his home town; then he came in with a minstrel show; he had a special lithograph, showing him standing beside an Incubator, which was hatching out new jokes every minute.  The house was crowded and Charlie was even more nervous than usual. Everybody else in the show got big receptions; Charlie walked out to absolute silence. He talked five minutes to just as absolute silence; then, discouraged, he stopped to take a breath; the instant he stopped the house was in a pandemonium; they really thought he was great, but hadn't wanted to interrupt him. After that he would tell a joke and then wait; he was a knockout.  Later he was talking it over at home:  \"Why, that awful silence had me rattled,\" he said; \"I couldn't even remember my act; I left out a lot of it.\"  \"Yes,\" said his father; \"we noticed you forgot to bring on your Incubator.\"     UNION LABOR   A Song and Dance Team (recently graduated from a Salt Lake City picture house) got eight weeks booking on the Cort Circuit out through the Northwest. The first show told the story. They were bad: awfully bad. But they had an ironclad, pay-or-play contract and as the management couldn't fire them, it was determined to freeze them out. The manager started in giving them two, three and four hundred mile jumps every week, hoping that they would quit. But no matter how long or crooked he made the jumps they always showed up bright and smiling every Monday morning.  Finally they came to their last stand: and it happened that the manager, who had booked them originally, was there and saw them again. He could hardly believe his eyes, for, owing to the fact that they had been doing from six to sixteen shows a day for the past eight weeks, they now had a pretty good act. As they were getting about as near nothing a week as anybody could get and not owe money to the manager, he wanted to keep them along. He was fearful the memories of those jumps he had been giving them would queer the deal, but he determined to see what a little pleasant talk would do; so he went to them and said,  \"Now, boys, you have got that act into pretty good shape; and if you like I can give you some more time. And,\" he hastened to add, \"you won't get any more of those big jumps either. I was awful sorry about those big fares you have had to pay.\"  \"Oh, that's all right,\" replied one of the boys; \"we belong to the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and always ride on the engine free anyway.\"     MARTIN LEHMAN GOES TO NEW YORK   Martin Lehman is the manager of the Orpheum Theater in Kansas City. Martin Beck is the general manager of the Orpheum Circuit. Mr. Beck had wired Lehman to come to New York at once. What Mr. Beck said went. So Lehman went.  If there is any one thing on earth that Martin Lehman loves better than another it is _not_ traveling. He is probably the only man on earth who can get seasick anywhere and everywhere.
