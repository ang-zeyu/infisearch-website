At the moment he was tapping nervously.  \"My name's Thacher,\" Thacher said to him, holding out his hand. \"Bob Thacher. Since we're going to be together for a while we might as well get to know each other.\"  The man studied him. Slowly his hand came out. \"Why not? My name's Erickson. Ralf Erickson.\"  \"Erickson?\" Thacher smiled. \"You look like a commercial man, to me.\" He nodded toward the sample case on the floor. \"Am I right?\"  The man named Erickson started to answer, but at that moment there was a stir. A thin man of about thirty had come up to the table, his eyes bright, staring down at them warmly. \"Well, we're on our way,\" he said to Erickson.  \"Hello, Mara.\" He pulled out a chair and sat down quickly, folding his hands on the table before him. He noticed Thacher and drew back a little. \"Pardon me,\" he murmured.  \"Bob Thacher is my name,\" Thacher said. \"I hope I'm not intruding here.\" He glanced around at the three of them, Mara, alert, watching him intently, heavy-set Erickson, his face blank, and this person. \"Say, do you three know each other?\" he asked suddenly.  There was silence.  The robot attendant slid over soundlessly, poised to take their orders. Erickson roused himself. \"Let's see,\" he murmured. \"What will we have? Mara?\"  \"Whiskey and water.\"  \"You, Jan?\"  The bright slim man smiled. \"The same.\"  \"Thacher?\"  \"Gin and tonic.\"  \"Whiskey and water for me, also,\" Erickson said. The robot attendant went off. It returned at once with the drinks, setting them on the table. Each took his own. \"Well,\" Erickson said, holding his glass up. \"To our mutual success.\"         *       *       *       *       *  All drank, Thacher and the three of them, heavy-set Erickson, Mara, her eyes nervous and alert, Jan, who had just come. Again a look passed between Mara and Erickson, a look so swift that he would not have caught it had he not been looking directly at her.  \"What line do you represent, Mr. Erickson?\" Thacher asked.  Erickson glanced at him, then down at the sample case on the floor. He grunted. \"Well, as you can see, I'm a salesman.\"  Thacher smiled. \"I knew it! You get so you can always spot a salesman right off by his sample case. A salesman always has to carry something to show. What are you in, sir?\"  Erickson paused. He licked his thick lips, his eyes blank and lidded, like a toad's. At last he rubbed his mouth with his hand and reached down, lifting up the sample case. He set it on the table in front of him.  \"Well?\" he said. \"Perhaps we might even show Mr. Thacher.\"  They all stared down at the sample case. It seemed to be an ordinary leather case, with a metal handle and a snap lock. \"I'm getting curious,\" Thacher said. \"What's in there? You're all so tense. Diamonds? Stolen jewels?\"  Jan laughed harshly, mirthlessly. \"Erick, put it down. We're not far enough away, yet.\"  \"Nonsense,\" Erick rumbled. \"We're away, Jan.\"  \"Please,\" Mara whispered. \"Wait, Erick.\"  \"Wait? Why? What for? You're so accustomed to--\"  \"Erick,\" Mara said. She nodded toward Thacher. \"We don't know him, Erick. Please!\"  \"He's a Terran, isn't he?\" Erickson said. \"All Terrans are together in these times.\" He fumbled suddenly at the catch lock on the case. \"Yes, Mr. Thacher. I'm a salesman. We're all salesmen, the three of us.\"  \"Then you do know each other.\"  \"Yes.\" Erickson nodded. His two companions sat rigidly, staring down. \"Yes, we do. Here, I'll show you our line.\"  He opened the case. From it he took a letter-knife, a pencil sharpener, a glass globe paperweight, a box of thumb tacks, a stapler, some clips, a plastic ashtray, and some things Thacher could not identify. He placed the objects in a row in front of him on the table top. Then he closed the sample case.  \"I gather you're in office supplies,\" Thacher said. He touched the letter-knife with his finger. \"Nice quality steel. Looks like Swedish steel, to me.\"  Erickson nodded, looking into Thacher's face. \"Not really an impressive business, is it? Office supplies. Ashtrays, paper clips.\" He smiled.  \"Oh--\" Thacher shrugged. \"Why not? They're a necessity in modern business. The only thing I wonder--\"  \"What's that?\"  \"Well, I wonder how you'd ever find enough customers on Mars to make it worth your while.\" He paused, examining the glass paperweight. He lifted it up, holding it to the light, staring at the scene within until Erickson took it out of his hand and put it back in the sample case. \"And another thing. If you three know each other, why did you sit apart when you got on?\"  They looked at him quickly.  \"And why didn't you speak to each other until we left Deimos?\" He leaned toward Erickson, smiling at him. \"Two men and a woman. Three of you. Sitting apart in the ship. Not speaking, not until the check-station was past. I find myself thinking over what the Martian said. Three saboteurs. A woman and two men.\"  Erickson put the things back in the sample case. He was smiling, but his face had gone chalk white. Mara stared down, playing with a drop of water on the edge of her glass. Jan clenched his hands together nervously, blinking rapidly.  \"You three are the ones the Leiter was after,\" Thacher said softly. \"You are the destroyers, the saboteurs. But their lie detector-- Why didn't it trap you? How did you get by that? And now you're safe, outside the check-station.\" He grinned, staring around at them. \"I'll be damned! And I really thought you were a salesman, Erickson. You really fooled me.\"  Erickson relaxed a little. \"Well, Mr. Thacher, it's in a good cause. I'm sure you have no love for Mars, either. No Terran does. And I see you're leaving with the rest of us.\"  \"True,\" Thacher said. \"You must certainly have an interesting account to give, the three of you.\" He looked around the table.  \"We still have an hour or so of travel. Sometimes it gets dull, this Mars-Terra run. Nothing to see, nothing to do but sit and drink in the lounge.\" He raised his eyes slowly. \"Any chance you'd like to spin a story to keep us awake?\"  Jan and Mara looked at Erickson. \"Go on,\" Jan said. \"He knows who we are. Tell him the rest of the story.\"  \"You might as well,\" Mara said.  Jan let out a sigh suddenly, a sigh of relief. \"Let's put the cards on the table, get this weight off us. I'm tired of sneaking around, slipping--\"  \"Sure,\" Erickson said expansively. \"Why not?\" He settled back in his chair, unbuttoning his vest. \"Certainly, Mr. Thacher. I'll be glad to spin you a story. And I'm sure it will be interesting enough to keep you awake.\"         *       *       *       *       *  They ran through the groves of dead trees, leaping across the sun-baked Martian soil, running silently together. They went up a little rise, across a narrow ridge. Suddenly Erick stopped, throwing himself down flat on the ground. The others did the same, pressing themselves against the soil, gasping for breath.  \"Be silent,\" Erick muttered. He raised himself a little. \"No noise. There'll be Leiters nearby, from now on. We don't dare take any chances.\"  Between the three people lying in the grove of dead trees and the City was a barren, level waste of desert, over a mile of blasted sand. No trees or bushes marred the smooth, parched surface. Only an occasional wind, a dry wind eddying and twisting, blew the sand up into little rills. A faint odor came to them, a bitter smell of heat and sand, carried by the wind.  Erick pointed. \"Look. The City-- There it is.\"  They stared, still breathing deeply from their race through the trees. The City was close, closer than they had ever seen it before. Never had they gotten so close to it in times past. Terrans were never allowed near the great Martian cities, the centers of Martian life. Even in ordinary times, when there was no threat of approaching war, the Martians shrewdly kept all Terrans away from their citadels, partly from fear, partly from a deep, innate sense of hostility toward the white-skinned visitors whose commercial ventures had earned them the respect, and the dislike, of the whole system.  \"How does it look to you?\" Erick said.  The City was huge, much larger than they had imagined from the drawings and models they had studied so carefully back in New York, in the War Ministry Office. Huge it was, huge and stark, black towers rising up against the sky, incredibly thin columns of ancient metal, columns that had stood wind and sun for centuries. Around the City was a wall of stone, red stone, immense bricks that had been lugged there and fitted into place by slaves of the early Martian dynasties, under the whiplash of the first great Kings of Mars.  An ancient, sun-baked City, a City set in the middle of a wasted plain, beyond groves of dead trees, a City seldom seen by Terrans--but a City studied on maps and charts in every War Office on Terra. A City that contained, for all its ancient stone and archaic towers, the ruling group of all Mars, the Council of Senior Leiters, black-clad men who governed and ruled with an iron hand.  The Senior Leiters, twelve fanatic and devoted men, black priests, but priests with flashing rods of fire, lie detectors, rocket ships, intra-space cannon, many more things the Terran Senate could only conjecture about. The Senior Leiters and their subordinate Province Leiters-- Erick and the two behind him suppressed a shudder.  \"We've got to be careful,\" Erick said again. \"We'll be passing among them, soon. If they guess who we are, or what we're here for--\"  He snapped open the case he carried, glancing inside for a second. Then he closed it again, grasping the handle firmly. \"Let's go,\" he said. He stood up slowly. \"You two come up beside me. I want to make sure you look the way you should.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Mara and Jan stepped quickly ahead. Erick studied them critically as the three of them walked slowly down the slope, onto the plain, toward the towering black spires of the City.  \"Jan,\" Erick said. \"Take hold of her hand! Remember, you're going to marry"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28698"],["title","The Crystal Crypt (#2)"],["body","r; she's your bride. And Martian peasants think a lot of their brides.\"  Jan was dressed in the short trousers and coat of the Martian farmer, a knotted rope tied around his waist, a hat on his head to keep off the sun. His skin was dark, colored by dye until it was almost bronze.  \"You look fine,\" Erick said to him. He glanced at Mara. Her black hair was tied in a knot, looped through a hollowed-out yuke bone. Her face was dark, too, dark and lined with colored ceremonial pigment, green and orange stripes across her cheeks. Earrings were strung through her ears. On her feet were tiny slippers of perruh hide, laced around her ankles, and she wore long translucent Martian trousers with a bright sash tied around her waist. Between her small breasts a chain of stone beads rested, good-luck charms for the coming marriage.  \"All right,\" Erick said. He, himself, wore the flowing grey robe of a Martian priest, dirty robes that were supposed to remain on him all his life, to be buried around him when he died. \"I think we'll get past the guards. There should be heavy morning traffic on the road.\"  They walked on, the hard sand crunching under their feet. Against the horizon they could see specks moving, other persons going toward the City, farmers and peasants and merchants, bringing their crops and goods to market.  \"See the cart!\" Mara exclaimed.  They were nearing a narrow road, two ruts worn into the sand. A Martian hufa was pulling the cart, its great sides wet with perspiration, its tongue hanging out. The cart was piled high with bales of cloth, rough country cloth, hand dipped. A bent farmer urged the hufa on.  \"And there.\" She pointed, smiling.  A group of merchants riding small animals were moving along behind the cart, Martians in long robes, their faces hidden by sand masks. On each animal was a pack, carefully tied on with rope. And beyond the merchants, plodding dully along, were peasants and farmers in an endless procession, some riding carts or animals, but mostly on foot.  Mara and Jan and Erick joined the line of people, melting in behind the merchants. No one noticed them; no one looked up or gave any sign. The march continued as before. Neither Jan nor Mara said anything to each other. They walked a little behind Erick, who paced with a certain dignity, a certain bearing becoming his position.  Once he slowed down, pointing up at the sky. \"Look,\" he murmured, in the Martian hill dialect. \"See that?\"  Two black dots circled lazily. Martian patrol craft, the military on the outlook for any sign of unusual activity. War was almost ready to break out with Terra. Any day, almost any moment.  \"We'll be just in time,\" Erick said. \"Tomorrow will be too late. The last ship will have left Mars.\"  \"I hope nothing stops us,\" Mara said. \"I want to get back home when we're through.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Half an hour passed. They neared the City, the wall growing as they walked, rising higher and higher until it seemed to blot out the sky itself. A vast wall, a wall of eternal stone that had felt the wind and sun for centuries. A group of Martian soldiers were standing at the entrance, the single passage-gate hewn into the rock, leading to the City. As each person went through the soldiers examined him, poking his garments, looking into his load.  Erick tensed. The line had slowed almost to a halt. \"It'll be our turn, soon,\" he murmured. \"Be prepared.\"  \"Let's hope no Leiters come around,\" Jan said. \"The soldiers aren't so bad.\"  Mara was staring up at the wall and the towers beyond. Under their feet the ground trembled, vibrating and shaking. She could see tongues of flame rising from the towers, from the deep underground factories and forges of the City. The air was thick and dense with particles of soot. Mara rubbed her mouth, coughing.  \"Here they come,\" Erick said softly.  The merchants had been examined and allowed to pass through the dark gate, the entrance through the wall into the City. They and their silent animals had already disappeared inside. The leader of the group of soldiers was beckoning impatiently to Erick, waving him on.  \"Come along!\" he said. \"Hurry up there, old man.\"  Erick advanced slowly, his arms wrapped around his body, looking down at the ground.  \"Who are you and what's your business here?\" the soldier demanded, his hands on his hips, his gun hanging idly at his waist. Most of the soldiers were lounging lazily, leaning against the wall, some even squatting in the shade. Flies crawled on the face of one who had fallen asleep, his gun on the ground beside him.  \"My business?\" Erick murmured. \"I am a village priest.\"  \"Why do you want to enter the City?\"  \"I must bring these two people before the magistrate to marry them.\" He indicated Mara and Jan, standing a little behind him. \"That is the Law the Leiters have made.\"  The soldier laughed. He circled around Erick. \"What do you have in that bag you carry?\"  \"Laundry. We stay the night.\"  \"What village are you from?\"  \"Kranos.\"  \"Kranos?\" The soldier looked to a companion. \"Ever heard of Kranos?\"  \"A backward pig sty. I saw it once on a hunting trip.\"  The leader of the soldiers nodded to Jan and Mara. The two of them advanced, their hands clasped, standing close together. One of the soldiers put his hand on Mara's bare shoulder, turning her around.  \"Nice little wife you're getting,\" he said. \"Good and firm-looking.\" He winked, grinning lewdly.  Jan glanced at him in sullen resentment. The soldiers guffawed. \"All right,\" the leader said to Erick. \"You people can pass.\"  Erick took a small purse from his robes and gave the soldier a coin. Then the three of them went into the dark tunnel that was the entrance, passing through the wall of stone, into the City beyond.  They were within the City!  \"Now,\" Erick whispered. \"Hurry.\"  Around them the City roared and cracked, the sound of a thousand vents and machines, shaking the stones under their feet. Erick led Mara and Jan into a corner, by a row of brick warehouses. People were everywhere, hurrying back and forth, shouting above the din, merchants, peddlers, soldiers, street women. Erick bent down and opened the case he carried. From the case he quickly took three small coils of fine metal, intricate meshed wires and vanes worked together into a small cone. Jan took one and Mara took one. Erick put the remaining cone into his robe and snapped the case shut again.  \"Now remember, the coils must be buried in such a way that the line runs through the center of the City. We must trisect the main section, where the largest concentration of buildings is. Remember the maps! Watch the alleys and streets carefully. Talk to no one if you can help it. Each of you has enough Martian money to buy your way out of trouble. Watch especially for cut-purses, and for heaven's sake, don't get lost.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Erick broke off. Two black-clad Leiters were coming along the inside of the wall, strolling together with their hands behind their backs. They noticed the three who stood in the corner by the warehouses and stopped.  \"Go,\" Erick muttered. \"And be back here at sundown.\" He smiled grimly. \"Or never come back.\"  Each went off a different way, walking quickly without looking back. The Leiters watched them go. \"The little bride was quite lovely,\" one Leiter said. \"Those hill people have the stamp of nobility in their blood, from the old times.\"  \"A very lucky young peasant to possess her,\" the other said. They went on. Erick looked after them, still smiling a little. Then he joined the surging mass of people that milled eternally through the streets of the City.  At dusk they met outside the gate. The sun was soon to set, and the air had turned thin and frigid. It cut through their clothing like knives.  Mara huddled against Jan, trembling and rubbing her bare arms.  \"Well?\" Erick said. \"Did you both succeed?\"  Around them peasants and merchants were pouring from the entrance, leaving the City to return to their farms and villages, starting the long trip back across the plain toward the hills beyond. None of them noticed the shivering girl and the young man and the old priest standing by the wall.  \"Mine's in place,\" Jan said. \"On the other side of the City, on the extreme edge. Buried by a well.\"  \"Mine's in the industrial section,\" Mara whispered, her teeth chattering. \"Jan, give me something to put over me! I'm freezing.\"  \"Good,\" Erick said. \"Then the three coils should trisect dead center, if the models were correct.\" He looked up at the darkening sky. Already, stars were beginning to show. Two dots, the evening patrol, moved slowly toward the horizon. \"Let's hurry. It won't be long.\"  They joined the line of Martians moving along the road, away from the City. Behind them the City was losing itself in the sombre tones of night, its black spires disappearing into darkness.  They walked silently with the country people until the flat ridge of dead trees became visible on the horizon. Then they left the road and turned off, walking toward the trees.  \"Almost time!\" Erick said. He increased his pace, looking back at Jan and Mara impatiently.  \"Come on!\"  They hurried, making their way through the twilight, stumbling over rocks and dead branches, up the side of the ridge. At the top Erick halted, standing with his hands on his hips, looking back.  \"See,\" he murmured. \"The City. The last time we'll ever see it this way.\"  \"Can I sit down?\" Mara said. \"My feet hurt me.\"  Jan pulled at Erick's sleeve. \"Hurry, Erick! Not much time left.\" He laughed nervously. \"If everything goes right we'll be able to look at it--forever.\"  \"But not like this,\" Erick murmured. He squatted down, snapping his case open. He took some tubes and wiring out and assembled them together on the ground, at the peak of the ridge. A small pyramid of wire and plastic grew, shaped by his expert hands.  At last he grunted, standing up. \"All right.\"  \"Is it pointed directly at the City?\""]]]
