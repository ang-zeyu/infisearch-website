Take until next week.\"  \"Someone should reason with the bastards,\" Morse said, looking out the port. Cassel immediately looked at the dial.  \"I just thought of something,\" Edwardson said.  \"Yeh?\"  \"I bet it feels horrible to have your mind grabbed,\" Edwardson said. \"I bet it's awful.\"  \"You'll know when it happens,\" Cassel said.  \"Did Everset?\"  \"Probably. He just couldn't do anything about it.\"  \"My mind feels fine,\" Cassel said. \"But the first one of you guys starts acting queer--watch out.\"  They all laughed.  \"Well,\" Edwardson said, \"I'd sure like a chance to reason with them. This is stupid.\"  \"Why not?\" Cassel asked.  \"You mean go out and meet _them_?\"  \"Sure,\" Cassel said. \"We're doing no good sitting here.\"  \"I should think we could do something,\" Edwardson said slowly. \"After all, they're not invincible. They're reasoning beings.\"  Morse punched a course on the ship's tape, then looked up.  \"You think we should contact the command? Tell them what we're doing?\"  \"No!\" Cassel said, and Edwardson nodded in agreement. \"Red tape. We'll just go out and see what we can do. If they won't talk, we'll blast 'em out of space.\"  \"Look!\"  Out of the port they could see the red flare of a reaction engine; the next ship in their sector, speeding forward.  \"They must have got the same idea,\" Edwardson said.  \"Let's get there first,\" Cassel said. Morse shoved the accelerator in and they were thrown back in their seats.  \"That dial hasn't moved yet, has it?\" Edwardson asked, over the clamor of the Detector alarm bell.  \"Not a move out of it,\" Cassel said, looking at the dial with its indicator slammed all the way over to the highest notch.

He called over his shoulder. \"Murgatroyd! Come here!\"  Murgatroyd hopped to his lap and gazed interestedly at the screen. The bland face changed remarkably. The voice changed even more.  \"_Very good!_\" it said. \"_Very, very good! Blueskins do not have_ tormals! _You are Med Service! By all means come in. Your co√∂rdinates will be ..._\"  Calhoun wrote them down. He clicked off the communicator again and growled to Murgatroyd;  \"So I might have been a blueskin, eh? And you're my passport, because only Med Ships have members of your tribe aboard! What the hell's the matter, Murgatroyd? They act like they think somebody's trying to get down on their planet with a load of plague-germs!\"  He grumbled to himself for minutes. The life of a Med Ship man is not exactly a sinecure, at best. It means long periods in empty space in overdrive, which is absolute and deadly tedium. Then two or three days aground, checking official documents and statistics, and asking questions to see how many of the newest medical techniques have reached this planet or that, and the supplying of information about such as have not arrived. Then lifting out to space for long periods of tedium, to repeat the process somewhere else. Med Ships carry only one man because two could not stand the close contact without quarreling with each other. But Med Ships do carry _tormals_, like Murgatroyd, and a _tormal_ and a man can get along indefinitely, like a man and a dog. It is a highly unequal friendship, but it seems to be satisfactory to both.  Calhoun was very much annoyed with the way the Med Service had been operated in Sector Twelve. He was one of many men at work to correct the results of incompetence in directing Med Service in the twelfth sector. But it is always disheartening to have to labor at making up for somebody else's blundering, when there is so much new work that needs to be done.  The condition shown by the landing-grid suspicions was a case in point. Blueskins were people who inherited a splotchy skin-pigmentation from other people who'd survived a plague. Weald plainly maintained a one-planet quarantine against them. But a quarantine is normally an emergency measure. The Med Service should have taken over, wiped out the need for a quarantine, and then lifted it. It hadn't been done.  Calhoun fumed to himself.         *       *       *       *       *  The world of Weald Three grew brighter and brighter and became a disk. The disk had ice-caps and a reasonable proportion of land and water surface. The Med Ship decelerated, and voices notified observation from the surface, and the little craft came to a stop some five planetary diameters out from solidity. The landing-field force-field locked on to it, and its descent began.  The business of landing was all very familiar, from the blue rim which appeared at the limb of the planet from one diameter out, to the singular flowing-apart of the surface features as the ship sank still lower. There was the circular landing-grid, rearing skyward for nearly a mile. It could let down interstellar liners from emptiness and lift them out to emptiness again, with great convenience and economy for everyone.  It landed the Med Ship in its center, and there were officials to greet Calhoun, and he knew in advance the routine part of his visit. There would be an interview with the planet's chief executive, by whatever title he was called. There would be a banquet. Murgatroyd would be petted by everybody. There would be painful efforts to impress Calhoun with the splendid conduct of public health matters on Weald. He would be told much scandal. He might find one man, somewhere, who passionately labored to advance the welfare of his fellow humans by finding out how to keep them well, or failing that how to make them well when they got sick. And in two days, or three, Calhoun would be escorted back to the landing-grid, and lifted out to space, and he'd spend long empty days in overdrive and land somewhere else to do the whole thing all over again.  It all happened exactly as he expected, with one exception. Every human being he met on Weald wanted to talk about blueskins. Blueskins and the idea of blueskins obsessed everyone. Calhoun listened without asking questions until he had the picture of what blueskins meant to the people who talked of them. Then he knew there would be no use asking questions at random. Nobody mentioned ever having seen a blueskin. Nobody mentioned a specific event in which a blueskin had at any named time taken part. But everybody was afraid of blueskins. It was a patterned, an inculcated, a stage-directed fixed idea. And it found expression in shocked references to the vileness, the depravity, the monstrousness of the blueskin inhabitants of Dara, from whom Weald must at all costs be protected.  It did not make sense. So Calhoun listened politely until he found an undistinguished medical man who wanted some special information about gene-selection as practised halfway across the galaxy. He invited that man to the Med Ship, where he supplied the information not hitherto available. He saw his guest's eyes shine a little with that joyous awe a man feels when he finds out something he has wanted long and badly to know.  \"Now,\" said Calhoun, \"tell me something! Why does everybody on this planet hate the inhabitants of Dara? It's light-years away. Nobody claims to have suffered in person from them. Why make a point of hating them?\"  The Wealdian doctor grimaced.  \"They've blue patches on their skins. They're different from us. So they can be pictured as a danger and our political parties can make an election issue out of competing for the privilege of defending us from them. They had a plague on Dara, once. They're accused of still having it ready for export.\"  \"Hm,\" said Calhoun. \"The story is that they want to spread contagion here, eh? Doesn't anybody\"--his tone was sardonic--\"doesn't anybody urge that they be massacred as an act of piety?\"  \"Yes--s--s--s,\" admitted the doctor reluctantly. \"It's mentioned in political speeches.\"  \"But how's it rationalized?\" demanded Calhoun. \"What's the argument to make pigment-patches involve moral and physical degradation, as I'm assured is the case?\"  \"In the public schools,\" said the doctor, \"the children are taught that blueskins are now carriers of the disease they survived three generations ago! That they hate everybody who isn't a blueskin. That they are constantly scheming to introduce their plague here so most of us will die and the rest become blueskins. That's beyond rationalizing. It can't be true, but it's not safe to doubt it.\"  \"Bad business,\" said Calhoun coldly. \"That sort of thing usually costs lives, in the end. It could lead to massacre!\"  \"Perhaps it has, in a way,\" said the doctor unhappily. \"One doesn't like to think about it.\" He paused, and said; \"Twenty years ago there was a famine on Dara. There were crop-failures. The situation must have been very bad. They built a space-ship. They've no use for such things normally, because no nearby planet will deal with them or let them land. But they built a space-ship and came here. They went in orbit around Weald. They asked to trade for shiploads of food. They offered any price in heavy metals, gold, platinum, iridium, and so on. They talked from orbit by vision communicators. They could be seen to be blueskins. You can guess what happened!\"  \"Tell me,\" said Calhoun.  \"We armed ships in a hurry,\" admitted the doctor, \"We chased their space-ship back to Dara. We hung in space off the planet. We told them we'd blast their world from pole to pole if they ever dared take to space again. We made them destroy their one ship, and we watched on visionscreens as it was done.\"  \"But you gave them food?\"  \"No,\" said the doctor ashamedly. \"They were blueskins.\"  \"How bad was the famine?\"  \"Who knows? Any number may have starved! And we kept a squadron of armed ships in their skies for years. To keep them from spreading the plague, we said. And some of us believed it, probably!\"  The doctor's tone was purest irony.  \"Lately,\" he said, \"there's been a move for economy in our government. Simultaneously, we began to have a series of over-abundant crops. The government had to buy the excess grain to keep the price up. Retired patrol-ships--built to watch over Dara--were available for storage-space. We filled them up with grain and sent them out into orbit. They're there now, hundreds of thousands or millions of tons of grain!\"  \"And Dara?\"  The Doctor shrugged. He stood up.  \"Our hatred of Dara,\" he said, again ironically, \"has produced one thing. Roughly halfway between here and Dara there's a two-planet solar system, Orede. There's a usable planet there. It was proposed to build an outpost of Weald there, against blueskins. Cattle were landed to run wild and multiply and make a reason for colonists to settle there. They did, but nobody wants to move nearer to blueskins! So Orede stayed uninhabited until a hunting-party shooting wild cattle found an outcropping of heavy-metal ore. So now there's a mine there. And that's all. A few hundred men work the mine at fabulous wages. You may be asked to check on their health. But not Dara's!\"  \"I see,\" said Calhoun, frowning.  The doctor moved toward the Med Ship's exit-port.  \"I answered your questions,\" he said grimly. \"But if I talked to anyone else as I've done to you, I'd be lucky only to be driven into exile!\"  \"I shan't give you away,\" said Calhoun. He did not smile.  When the doctor had gone, Calhoun said deliberately;  \"Murgatroyd, you should be grateful that you're a _tormal_ and not a man. There's nothing about being a _tormal_ to make you ashamed!\"  Then he grimly changed his garments for the full-dress uniform of the Med Service. There was to be a banquet at which he would sit next to"]]]
