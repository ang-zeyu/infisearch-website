Norris lit a cigar. \"It's entirely immaterial to me whether you believe it or not.\"  But the story was believed, especially by the women, to whom the romantic angle appealed and Mason's embryonic mutiny died without being born, and the _Marie Galante_ sailed on through uncharted space toward her ninth and last landing.  As the days dragged by and no word came from the bridge cuddy, restlessness began to grow amongst us. Rumor succeeded rumor, each story wilder and more incredible than the rest. Then just as the tension had mounted to fever pitch, there came the sickening lurch and grinding vibration of another landing.  Norris dispensed with his usual talk before marching out from the ship. After testing the atmosphere with the ozonometer, he passed out the heat pistols and distributed the various instruments for computing radioactivity and cosmic radiation.  \"This is the planet Nizar,\" he said shortly. \"Largest in the field of the sun Ponthis. You will make your survey as one group this time. I will remain here.\"  He stood watching us as we marched off down the cliff side. Then the blue _hensorr_ trees rose up to swallow him from view. Mason swung along at the head of our column, eyes bright, a figure of aggressive action. We had gone but a hundred yards when it became apparent that, as a planet, Nizar was entirely different from its predecessors. There was considerable top soil, and here grew a tall reed-shaped plant that gave off varying chords of sound when the wind blew.  It was as if we were progressing through the nave of a mighty church with a muted organ in the distance. There was animal life too, a strange lizard-like bird that rose up in flocks ahead of us and flew screaming overhead.  \"I don't exactly like it, Bagley,\" he said. \"There's something unwholesome about this planet. The evolution is obviously in an early state of development, but I get the impression that it has gone backward; that the planet is really old and has reverted to its earlier life.\"  Above us the sky was heavily overcast, and a tenuous white mist rising up from the _hensorr_ trees formed curious shapes and designs. In the distance I could hear the swashing of waves on a beach.  Suddenly Mason stopped. \"Look!\" he said.  Below us stretched the shore of a great sea. But it was the structure rising up from that shore that drew a sharp exclamation from me. Shaped in a rough ellipse, yet mounted high toward a common point, was a large building of multiple hues and colors. The upper portion was eroded to crumbling ruins, the lower part studded with many bas-reliefs and triangular doorways.  \"Let's go,\" Mason said, breaking out into a fast loping run.  The building was farther away than we had thought, but when we finally came up to it, we saw that it was even more of a ruin than it had at first appeared. It was only a shell with but two walls standing, alone and forlorn. Whatever race had lived here, they had come and gone.  We prowled about the ruins for more than an hour. The carvings on the walls were in the form of geometric designs and cabalistic symbols, giving no clue to the city's former occupants' identity.  And then Mason found the stairs leading to the lower crypts. He switched on his ato-flash and led the way down cautiously. Level one ... level two ... three ... we descended lower and lower. Here water from the nearby sea oozed in little rivulets that glittered in the light of the flash.  We emerged at length on a wide underground plaisance, a kind of amphitheater, with tier on tier of seats surrounding it and extending back into the shadows.  \"Judging from what we've seen,\" Mason said, \"I would say that the race that built this place had reached approximately a grade C-5 of civilization, according to the Mokart scale. This apparently was their council chamber.\"  \"What are those rectangular stone blocks depending from the ceiling?\" I said.  Mason turned the light beam upward. \"I don't know,\" he said. \"But my guess is that they are burial vaults. Perhaps the creatures were ornithoid.\"  Away from the flash the floor of the plaisance appeared to be a great mirror that caught our reflections and distorted them fantastically and horribly. We saw then that it was a form of living mold, composed of millions of tiny plants, each with an eye-like iris at its center. Those eyes seemed to be watching us, and as we strode forward, a great sigh rose up, as if in resentment at our intrusion.  There was a small triangular dais in the center of the chamber, and in the middle of it stood an irregular black object. As we drew nearer, I saw that it had been carved roughly in the shape of this central building and that it was in a perfect state of preservation.  Mason walked around this carving several times, examining it curiously.  \"Odd,\" he said. \"It looks to be an object of religious veneration, but I never heard before of a race worshipping a replica of their own living quarters.\"  Suddenly his voice died off. He bent closer to the black stone, studying it in the light of the powerful ato-flash. He got a small magnifying glass out of his pocket and focused it on one of the miniature bas-reliefs midway toward the top of the stone. Unfastening his geologic hammer from his belt, he managed, with a sharp, swinging blow, to break off a small protruding piece.  He drew in his breath sharply, and I saw his face go pale. I stared at him in alarm.  \"What's wrong?\" I asked.  He motioned that I follow and led the way silently past the others toward the stair shaft. Climbing to the top level was a heart-pounding task, but Mason almost ran up those steps. At the surface he leaned against a pillar, his lips quivering spasmodically.  \"Tell me I'm sane, Bagley,\" he said huskily. \"Or rather, don't say anything until we've seen Norris. Come on. We've got to see Norris.\"         *       *       *       *       *  All the way back to the _Marie Galante_, I sought to soothe him, but he was a man possessed. He rushed up the ship's gangway, burst into central quarters and drew up before Navigator Norris like a runner stopping at the tape.  \"You damned lying hypocrite!\" he yelled.  Norris looked at him in his quiet way. \"Take it easy, Mason,\" he said. \"Sit down and explain yourself.\"  But Mason didn't sit down. He thrust his hand in his pocket, pulled out the piece of black stone he had chipped off the image in the cavern and handed it to Norris.  \"Take a look at that!\" he demanded.  Norris took the stone, glanced at it and laid it down on his desk. His face was emotionless. \"I expected this sooner or later,\" he said. \"Yes, it's _Indurate_ all right. Is that what you want me to say?\"  There was a dangerous fanatical glint in Mason's eyes now. With a sudden quick motion he pulled out his heat pistol.  \"So you tricked us!\" he snarled. \"Why? I want to know why.\"  I stepped forward and seized Mason's gun hand. \"Don't be a fool,\" I said. \"It can't be that important.\"  Mason threw back his head and burst into an hysterical peal of laughter. \"Important!\" he cried. \"Tell him how important it is, Norris. _Tell him._\"  Quietly the Navigator filled and lighted his pipe. \"I'm afraid Mason is right,\" he said. \"I did trick you. Not purposely, however. And in the beginning I had no intention of telling anything but the truth. Actually we're here because of a dead man's vengeance.\"  Norris took his pipe from his lips and stared at it absently.  \"You'll remember that Ganeth-Klae, the Martian, and I worked together to invent _Indurate_. But whereas I was interested in the commercial aspects of that product, Klae was absorbed only in the experimental angle of it. He had some crazy idea that it should not be given to the general public at once, but rather should be allocated for the first few years to a select group of scientific organizations. You see, _Indurate_ was such a departure from all known materials that Ganeth-Klae feared it would be utilized for military purposes.  \"I took him for a dreamer and a fool. Actually he was neither. How was I to know that his keen penetrating brain had seen through my motive to get control of all commercial marketing of _Indurate_? I had laid my plans carefully, and I had expected to reap a nice harvest. Klae must have been aware of my innermost thoughts, but Martian-like he said nothing.\"  Norris paused to wet his lips and lean against the desk. \"I didn't kill Ganeth-Klae,\" he continued, \"though I suppose in a court of law I would be judged responsible for his death. The manufacture of _Indurate_ required some ticklish work. As you know, we produced our halves of the formula separately. Physical contact with my half over a long period of time would prove fatal, I knew, and I simply neglected to so inform Ganeth-Klae.  \"But his ultimate death was a boomerang. With Klae gone, I could find no trace of his half of the formula. I was almost beside myself for a time. Then I thought of something. Klae had once said that the secret of his half of the formula lay in himself. A vague statement, to say the least. But I took the words at their face value and gambled that he meant them literally; that is, that his body itself contained the formula.  \"I tried everything: X-ray, chemical analysis of the skin. I even removed the cranial cap and examined the brain microscopically. All without result. Meanwhile the police were beginning to direct their suspicions toward me in the matter of Klae's disappearance.  \"You know the rest. It was necessary that I leave Earth at once and go beyond our system, beyond the jurisdiction of the planetary police. So I arranged this voyage with a sufficient complement of passengers to lessen the danger and hardship of a new life on a new world. I was still positive, however, that Klae's secret lay in his dead body. I took that body along, encased in the Martian preservative, solidifex.  \"It was my idea that I could continue my examination once we were safe on a strange"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/29750"],["title","Zen (#1)"],["body","logy, for the reasons which follow, was one of the most difficult studies; so difficult that nuclear physics actually _preceded_ it!) I told her that the Zen had been, all evidence indicated, the toughest, hardest, longest-lived creatures God had ever cooked up: practically independent of their environment, no special ecological niche; just raw, stubborn, tenacious life, developed to a fantastic extreme--a greater force of life than any other known, one that could exist almost anywhere under practically any conditions--even floating in midspace, which, asteroid or no, this Zen was doing right now.  The Zens breathed, all right, but it was nothing they'd had to do in order to live. It gave them nothing their incredible metabolism couldn't scrounge up out of rock or cosmic rays or interstellar gas or simply do without for a few thousand years. If the human body is a furnace, then the Zen body is a feeder pile. Maybe that, I thought, was what evolution always worked toward.  \"Please, will you kill me?\" the Zen said.         *       *       *       *       *  I'd been expecting that. Two years ago, on the bleak surface of Eros, Yurt had asked Engstrom to do the same thing. But I asked, \"Why?\" although I knew what the answer would be, too.  The Zen looked up at me. She was exhibiting every ounce of emotion a Zen is capable of, which is a lot; and I could recognize it, but not in any familiar terms. A tiny motion here, a quiver there, but very quiet and still for the most part. And _that_ was the violent expression: restraint. Yurt, after two years of living with us, still couldn't understand why we found this confusing.  Difficult, aliens--or being alien.  \"I've tried so often to do it myself,\" the Zen said softly. \"But I can't. I can't even hurt myself. Why do I want you to kill me?\" She was even quieter. Maybe she was crying. \"I'm alone. Five hundred years, Eert-mn--not too long. I'm still young. But what good is it--life--when there are no other Zen?\"  \"How do you know there are no other Zen?\"  \"There are no others,\" she said almost inaudibly. I suppose a human girl might have shrieked it.  _A child_, I thought, _when your world blew up. And you survived. Now you're a young three-thousand-year-old woman ... uneducated, afraid, probably crawling with neuroses. Even so, in your thousand-year terms, young lady, you're not too old to change._  \"Will you kill me?\" she asked again.  And suddenly I was having one of those eye-popping third-row-center views of the whole scene: the enormous, beautiful sky; the dead clod, Vesta; the little creature who stood there staring at me--the brilliant-ignorant, humanlike-alien, old-young creature who was asking me to kill her.  For a moment the human quality of her thinking terrified me ... the feeling you might have waking up some night and finding your pet puppy sitting on your chest, looking at you with wise eyes and white fangs gleaming ...  Then I thought of Yurt--smart, friendly Yurt, who had learned to laugh and wisecrack--and I came out of the jeebies. I realized that here was only a sick girl, no tiny monster. And if she were as resilient as Yurt ... well, it was his problem. He'd probably pull her through.  But I didn't pick her up. I made no attempt to take her back to the ship. Her tiny white teeth and tiny yellow claws were harder than steel; and she was, I knew, unbelievably strong for her size. If she got suspicious or decided to throw a phobic tizzy, she could scatter shreds of me over a square acre of Vesta in less time than it would take me to yelp.  \"Will you--\" she began again.  I tried shakily, \"Hell, no. Wait here.\" Then I had to translate it.         *       *       *       *       *  I went back to the _Lucky Pierre_ and got Yurt. We could do without him, even though he had been a big help. We'd taught him a lot--he'd been a child at the blow-up, too--and he'd taught us a lot. But this was more important, of course.  When I told him what had happened, he was very quiet; crying, perhaps, just like a human being, with happiness.  Cap Feldman asked me what was up, and I told him, and he said, \"Well, I'll be blessed!\"  I said, \"Yurt, are you sure you want us to keep hands off ... just go off and leave you?\"  \"Yes, please.\"  Feldman said, \"Well, I'll be blessed.\"  Yurt, who spoke excellent English, said, \"Bless you all.\"  I took him back to where the female waited. From the ridge, I knew, the entire crew was watching through binocs. I set him down, and he fell to studying her intently.  \"I am not a Zen,\" I told her, giving my torch full brilliance for the crew's sake, \"but Yurt here is. Do you see ... I mean, do you know what you look like?\"  She said, \"I can see enough of my own body to--and--yes ...\"  \"Yurt,\" I said, \"here's the female we thought we might find. Take over.\"  Yurt's eyes were fastened on the girl.  \"What--do I do now?\" she whispered worriedly.  \"I'm afraid that's something only a Zen would know,\" I told her, smiling inside my helmet. \"I'm not a Zen. Yurt is.\"  She turned to him. \"You will tell me?\"  \"If it becomes necessary.\" He moved closer to her, not even looking back to talk to me. \"Give us some time to get acquainted, will you, Dave? And you might leave some supplies and a bubble at the camp when you move on, just to make things pleasanter.\"  By this time he had reached the female. They were as still as space, not a sound, not a motion. I wanted to hang around, but I knew how I'd feel if a Zen, say, wouldn't go away if I were the last man alive and had just met the last woman.  I moved my torch off them and headed back for the _Lucky Pierre_. We all had a drink to the saving of a great race that might have become extinct. Ed Reiss, though, had to do some worrying before he could down his drink.  \"What if they don't like each other?\" he asked anxiously.  \"They don't have much choice,\" Captain Feldman said, always the realist. \"Why do homely women fight for jobs on the most isolated space outposts?\"  Reiss grinned. \"That's right. They look awful good after a year or two in space.\"  \"Make that twenty-five by Zen standards or three thousand by ours,\" said Joe Hargraves, \"and I'll bet they look beautiful to each other.\"  We decided to drop our investigation of Vesta for the time being, and come back to it after the honeymoon.  Six months later, when we returned, there were twelve hundred Zen on Vesta!  Captain Feldman was a realist but he was also a deeply moral man. He went to Yurt and said, \"It's indecent! Couldn't the two of you control yourselves at least a little? _Twelve hundred kids!_\"  \"We were rather surprised ourselves,\" Yurt said complacently. \"But this seems to be how Zen reproduce. Can you have only half a child?\"  Naturally, Feld got the authorities to quarantine Vesta. Good God, the Zen could push us clear out of the Solar System in a couple of generations!  I don't think they would, but you can't take such chances, can you?                                                          --JEROME BIXBY     Transcriber's Note:      This etext was produced from _Galaxy Science Fiction_ October 1952.
