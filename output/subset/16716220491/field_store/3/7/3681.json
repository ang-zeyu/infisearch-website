The pelage of adults varies depending on season. In summer the individual hairs are relatively short (5-6 mm. at the middle of the back) and sparse. The over-all color of the dorsum, sides and flanks is brownish to dark brownish, and the venter is grayish. In winter the pelage is dense, long (8-9 mm. at the middle of the back) and lax. The over-all color dorsally in fresh winter pelage in most specimens is paler (more buffy) than summer pelage, the sides are markedly buffy, and the venter is whitish; even the tail is more pilose and more sharply bicolored than in summer. Adults molt, usually completely but occasionally only partially, at least twice a year--once in spring (in May and June in Nebraskan specimens) from winter to summer pelage, and once in autumn (in October and November in Nebraskan specimens) from summer to winter pelage. Of the two molts, the one in spring is most easily discernible because the contrast in color between worn winter pelage and fresh summer pelage is considerably greater than that between worn summer pelage and fresh winter pelage, and because the progress of spring molt is seemingly more regular than that of autumn molt. In spring, molt proceeds posteriorly in a more or less regular line on both dorsum and venter; in most specimens it is completed first on the venter. In autumn, molt is irregular, or at best is coincident over large parts of the body, and frequently is seen only by searching through the pelage with a fine probe or dissecting needle. In both spring and autumn, molt seemingly is delayed in females that are pregnant or lactating.  In both winter pelage and summer pelage, the upper parts have blackish or grayish guard hairs and shorter, more numerous cover hairs. All the cover hairs are gray basally; some have a buffy band terminally and others have a buffy subterminal band with a terminal black tip. The generally darker over-all color of upper parts in summer pelage results (as seen in Nebraskan specimens) from a narrower band of buff on the cover hairs (only approximately one half the width of the band on hairs in winter pelage), a darker buffy band (ochraceous buff rather than pale ochraceous or straw color), and a relative sparseness of the pelage, which allows the gray basal portion of some hairs to show on the surface. The more grayish venter of summer-taken specimens results from much more of the grayish basal portion of the white-tipped hairs showing through than in the longer, denser pelage of winter.  Wear on the pelage seems in general to produce a paler over-all color of upper parts, evidently due mostly to abrasion of the terminal black tip of the cover hairs, but possibly actual fading of the pelage is involved also. Worn winter pelage is especially notable for its paleness; the buffy tones are accentuated and the upper parts, especially posteriorly, may even appear fulvous. The difference in color of upper parts between specimens in worn winter pelage and fresh summer pelage (or for that matter specimens in fresh _versus_ worn winter pelage) from the same locality is greater in our material than the difference between some specimens in comparable pelages from localities more than 500 miles apart.  We have seen no specimens taken in winter in which we could discern that the autumn molt had been incomplete, but three old adult males in summer pelage indicate that spring molt is not always completed. KU 50154, obtained on August 14, 1952, 5 mi. N and 2 mi. W Parks, Dundy Co., Nebraska, has the entire posterior back and sides still in old winter pelage and does not appear to have been actively molting; the entire venter is in summer pelage. KU 50146, obtained on August 22, 1952, 3 mi. E Chadron, Dawes Co., Nebraska, has small patches or tufts of winter pelage remaining on the rump and likewise does not appear to have been actively molting. KU 72085, obtained on October 13, 1956, 4 mi. E Barada, Richardson Co., Nebraska, is in the process of molting from summer to winter pelage, but has tufts of old winter pelage on the rump.   Geographic Variation  Geographic variation, both in color of pelage and in external and cranial dimensions, is less in _R. megalotis_ in the region studied than in most other cricetine species that occur there. Nevertheless, meaningful variation is present. The assumption that variation in _R. megalotis_ paralleled in degree that of other species, _Peromyscus maniculatus_ for example, led to untenable taxonomic conclusions by some previous workers.   _Color of Pelage_  Color of pelage is remarkably uniform, considering the geographic extent of the area involved, over most of the northern part of the central grasslands. Perhaps this uniformity results partly from the predilection of the western harvest mouse for grassy habitats, for in most areas on the Great Plains the species is restricted to riparian communities, principally along river systems, where soils, cover, and other conditions approximate those of corresponding habitats farther to the east to a much greater degree than do conditions in upland habitats. Differential selective pressure, therefore, theoretically would be less between eastern and western populations of _R. megalotis_ than in an upland-inhabiting species. In any event, specimens from western Nebraska, Wyoming, northern Colorado, and adjacent areas average only slightly paler dorsally than specimens in corresponding pelages from the eastern parts of Nebraska and Kansas, and many individuals from the two areas can be matched almost exactly.  To the southwest, on the other hand, a trend toward paler (pale brownish, less blackish) upper parts is apparent. Specimens from southwestern Kansas and adjacent parts of Colorado and Oklahoma average slightly paler in comparable pelages than specimens from northeastern Kansas and eastern Nebraska, but most specimens from farther southwest, in northern New Mexico and southwestern Colorado, are discernibly, although not markedly, paler than mice from northern and eastern populations.  A \"pectoral spot,\" fairly common in some populations of _R. megalotis_ east of the Missouri River (see Hoffmeister and Warnock, 1955:162-163), is present in only a small percentage of the specimens we have studied, and when present is usually only faintly developed.   _External and Cranial Size_  [Illustration: FIG. 1. Geographic variation in five measurements of _Reithrodontomys megalotis_ on the central Great Plains. The size of each sample is given, along with total length, length of tail expressed as a percentage of the head and body, length of ear, greatest length of skull, and length of rostrum. The approximate distribution of the species in the region shown and the approximate boundary between the subspecies _R. m. aztecus_ and _R. m. dychei_ also are indicated.]  As seen in Figure 1, the tail and especially the ear are longer in mice from New Mexico and adjacent areas than in specimens from northern localities. The ear, only slightly variable in size in the northern part of the region, is markedly longer in the southwest, averaging more than 2 mm. longer in specimens from New Mexico and adjacent southwestern Colorado than in specimens from Nebraska and eastern Kansas; specimens in a zone from central Colorado through southwestern Kansas and adjacent Oklahoma generally have ears of a size between the two extremes. As concerns the tail we note a slight trend toward increasing length (best expressed as percentage of length of body) from north to south throughout the central plains, but in general the trend is more pronounced southwestwardly. Variation in length of tail and length of ear, therefore, appear to be in accord with Allen's Rule. Length of body and length of hind foot seem not to vary significantly in specimens we have studied.  The skulls of specimens examined differed only slightly, except that the rostrum is significantly longer and relatively, if not actually, narrower in specimens from the south and southwest than in mice from the rest of the region under study. The rostrum is longest (average 7.7 mm.) in specimens from the vicinity of the type locality of _R. m. aztecus_, but is relatively long (7.5-7.6 mm.) in populations from as far north as northeastern Colorado and southwestern Nebraska. An average greater occipitonasal length (greatest length of skull) in specimens from the south and southwest results mostly from the longer rostrum.  Recognition of two subspecies of _R. megalotis_ on the central Great Plains seems justified on the basis of the geographic variation discussed above. One subspecies, for which the name _R. m. aztecus_ is applicable, occurs in the southwest and is characterized by the culmination of trends in the region studied to paler upper parts, longer tail, longer ear, and longer, relatively narrower rostrum--characters that appear at least partly independent of each other as concerns gradation toward the smaller, darker-colored populations to the northward. The latter, while exhibiting some differences in color (slightly paler westwardly) and length of tail (shorter northwardly), stand more or less as a unit in contrast to the mice from the southwest, and represent, in our judgment, a single subspecies, _R. m. dychei_. The area of intergradation between the two subspecies is relatively broad, considering all the characters mentioned, and assignment of some intergrades is admittedly difficult.   _Reithrodontomys megalotis aztecus_ J.
