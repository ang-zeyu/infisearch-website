Bob Smiles caught hold of my collar unt started to drag me toward a tree. Just as I was giving up everything for lost, up comes Jim Jones--the same man I'm going to meet here--he come runnin' up. He was dressed in full uniform as a rebel officer--gray coat unt pants, silver stars on his collar, high boots, gray slouched hat with gold cord, unt so on.  \"'Here, what is the matter? What's all this fuss in camp?' he said.  \"'We've ketched one of them Dutch Jews from St. Louis spying our camp, Major,' said Bob Smiles, letting loose of my collar to salute the Major's silver stars. 'And we are going to hang him.'{30}  \"'A spy? How do you know he's a spy?'\" asked Jim Jones.  \"'Well, he's Dutch; he's a Jew, unt he's from St. Louis. What more do you want?'\" asked Bob Smiles.  [Illustration: TRYING TO SAVE HIS NECK. 30]  The crowd yelled, unt de man with the rope went to the tree unt flung one end over a limb.  \"'His being a St. Louis Dutchman is against him,'{31} said Jim Jones, 'but his being a Jew is in his favor. A Jew don't care a blame for politics. He hain't got no principles. He'd rather make a picayune off you in a trade than have a wagon-load of principles. But you fellers have got nothing to do with spies, anyway. That's headquarters' bizniss. I'm an officer at General Price's headquarters. I'll take him up there unt examine him. Bring him along.'  \"'Go along, Jew,' said two of three of them, giving me kicks, as Bob Smiles started with me. The man with the rope stood by the tree looking very disappointed.  \"When we got near General Price's tent, Jim Jones says to the rest:  \"'You stop there. Come along with me, Jew.'  \"He took me by the collar, unt we walked toward General Price's tent. He whispered to me as we went along: 'You're all right, Rosenbaum. I know you, unt I know what you're here for. Just keep a stiff upper lip, tell your story straight, unt I'll see you through.'  [Illustration: \"I KNOW YOU, UNT WHAT YOU'RE HERE FOR.\" 32]  \"That scared me worse than ever, but all that I could do was to keep up my nerve, unt play my cards coolly. We went into the General's tent, but he was busy, unt motioned us with his hand to the Adjutant-General.  \"'What's the matter?' asked the Adjutant-General, motioning me to sit down, while he went on making tally marks on a sheet of paper, as a man called off the regiments that had reported. Then he footed them all up, unt, turning to another officer, read from it so many Arkansaw regiments, so many{32} Louisianny, so many Mizzouri, so many Texas, so many batteries of artillery, unt he said to another officer as he laid the paper face down among the other papers on his table: 'Just as I told you, Colonel. We have fully 22,000 men ready for battle.' Then to us: 'Well, what can I do for you?'  \"'The boys had picked up this Jew for a spy, Colonel,' said Jim Jones, pointing to me, 'unt they{33} were about to hang him, just to pass away the afternoon more than for anything else. I took him away from them, telling them that it was your privilege to hang spies, unt you could do it according to the science of war. I brung him up here to get him away from them. After they're gone away or got interested in something else I'll take him unt put him outside of camp.'  \"'All right,\" said de Adjutant-General, without taking much interest in the matter. 'Do with him as you please. A Jew more or less isn't of any consequence. Probably he deserves hanging, though, but it isn't well to encourage the boys to hang men on sight. They're quite too ready to do that, anyway.'  \"He talked to the other man a little, unt then when he went away he turned to me, unt said, sort of lazy like, as if he didn't care anything about it:  \"'Where are you from?'  \"'From Memphis,' said I.  \"'Great place, Memphis,' said he; 'one of the thriving suburbs of Satan's Kingdom. Had lots of fun there. I know every faro bank in it, which speaks well for my memory, if not for my morals. What bizniss was you in?'  \"'Clothing,' said I.  \"'What a fool question to ask a Jew,' said he, yawning. 'Of course, you was in the clothing trade. You was born in it. All Jews have been since they gambled for the Savior's garments.'  \"'They wasn't Jews what gambled for Christ's clothes,' said I, picking up a little courage. 'They vass Romans--Italians--Dagoes.'{34}  \"'Was they?' said he. 'Well, mebbe they was. I haven't read my Bible for so long that I've clean forgot. Say, what are you doing with all them pins?'  \"The question come so unexpected that it come nearly knocking me off my base. I had calculated on almost every other possible thing, unt was ready for it, except that fool question. I thought for a minit that disappointed man by the tree with the rope was going to get his job, after all. But I gathered myself together with a jerk, unt calmly said with a smile:  \"'O, that's some of my foolishness. I can't get over being a tailor, and sticking all the pins what I find in my lapel. I must pick up every one I see.'  \"'Queer where you found them all,' said he. 'Must've brung them from Memphis with you. I can't find one in the whole camp. Our men use nails unt thorns instead of pins. I've been wanting a lot of pins for my papers. Let me have all you got. I wish you had a paper of them.'  \"I did have two or three papers in my pockets, unt first had a fool idea of offering them to him. Then I remembered that disappointed man with the rope by the tree, unt pulled the pins out of my lapels one by one unt give them to him, trying to keep count in my head as I did so.  \"'What are you doing here, anyway?' he asked as he gathered up the pins unt put them in a pasteboard box.  \"'I come here at General Pillow's orders, to pick up some Mexican silfer dollars, to buy ammunition in Mexico.  \"'Another of old blowhard Pillow's fool schemes,'{35} said he. 'I know old Pillow. I served with him in Mexico, when he dug his ditch on the wrong side of his fortification. He's probably going to do some-thing else with the dollars than buy ammunition. Old Gid Pillow's a mighty slick one, I tell you, when it comes to filling his own pockets. He's no fool there, whatever he may be in other ways. He's working some scheme to skin our men, unt making you his partner, then he'll turn around unt skin you. I'll stop it going any further by turning you out of camp, unt I ought to take away from you all the money you've gathered up, but I won't do it on one condition.'  \"'What is your condition?' said I, trying not to speak too quick.  \"'You say you are in the clothing pizniss. I want awfully a nice uniform, just like the Major's there. What's such a uniform worth?'  \"'About $75,' said I.  \"'I paid $65 for this in St. Louis,' said Jim Jones.  \"'Well, $10 is not much of a skin for a Memphis Jew,' laughed the Adjutant-General. 'I tell you what I'll do, if you'll swear by the book of Deuteronomy, unt Moses, Abraham unt Isaac, to have me inside of two weeks just such a uniform as the Major's there, I'll let you off with all the money you have made already, unt when you come back with it I'll give you written permission to trade for every silver dollar in camp.'  \"'It is a bargain,' said I.  \"'Unt it'll be a perfect fit,\" said he.  \"'Just like the paper on the wall,' said I. 'Let me{36} take your measure.'  \"I had my eye all the time on the paper he had laid carelessly down unt forgotten. I pulled my tapemeasure out. The old idee of the tailor come up. I forgot about the disappointed man with the rope by the tree, unt was my old self taking the measure of a customer. I put all the figures down on his piece of paper, without his noticing what I was using. I asked him about the lining, the trimming, unt the pockets, unt wrote them down. Then I folded up the paper unt stuck it in my breast pocket, unt my heart gave a big thump, though I kept my face straight, unt went on talking about buttons unt silk braid unt gold lace for the sleeves. I promised him he should have the uniform in the army in two weeks' time. Just then some officers come in, unt Jim Jones hurried me out. I could not understand Jim Jones. He hurried me across to a place behind the woods, where we found some horses.  \"'Untie that one unt get on quick,' he said. 'My God, you've got the thing dead to rights; you've got everything on that piece of paper. My God, what luck! Smartest thing I ever saw done. Get that paper in General Lyon's hands before midnight if you kill yourself unt horse in doing it. I'll take you out past part of the guards, unt show you how to avoid the rest. Then ride as if the devil was after you, until you reach General Lyon's tent.'  \"I was dumfounded. I looked at Jim Jones. His eyes was like fire. Then it suddenly occurred to me that Jim Jones was a spy, too.  \"As I mounted I looked back across the camp. I saw the rope still hanging from a limb of the tree,{37} and the disappointed man sitting down beside it patiently waiting.  \"That night the paper was in General Lyon's hands, unt the next night the army moved out to fight the battle of Wilson's Creek.  \"The Adjutant-General is still waiting for that uniform.\"  \"Halt, who comes there?\" called out Shorty, whose quick ears caught the sound of approaching footsteps.  \"The Officer of the Guard,\" responded from the bank of darkness in the rear.  \"Advance, Officer of the Guard, and give the countersign,\" commanded Shorty, lowering his musket to a charge bayonets.  The officer advanced, leaned over the bayonet's point, and whispered the countersign.  \"Countersign's correct,\" announced Shorty, bringing his gun to a present. \"Good evening. Lieutenant. We have got a man here who claims to belong to the Secret Service.\"  \"Yes,\" answered the officer. \"We've been expecting him all afternoon, but thought he was coming in on the other road. I'd have been around here long ago only for that. This is he, is it? Well, let's hurry in. They want you at Headquarters as soon as possible.\"  "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31774"],["title","Si Klegg, Book 4 (#1)"],["body","igade's battery was rushed up to a hill in the rear, and opened a fire on the rebel guns. The other regiments were deployed to the right and left to outflank the rebel position.  Si and Shorty and the rest of Co. Q put in the time trying to get their guns dry and borrowing ammunition from the men of the other companies. Both were jobs of difficulty and doubtful success. There could be no proper drying of guns in that incessant drench, and nobody wanted to open up his stock of cartridges in such a rain.  In the intervals between the heavier showers glimpses could be had of the \"Kankakee Suckers\" and the \"Maumee Muskrats\" working their way as fast as they could around toward the rebel flanks. The rebel artillery, seeing most danger from them, began throwing shells in their direction as they could be caught sight of through the rain and the opening in the trees.  \"Why don't they order us forward with the bayonets?\" fretted Si. \"We can scatter them. Their guns ain't in no better shape than ours. If they hold us here, the Illinoy and Ohio fellers 'll git all the credit.\"  \"The Colonel's orders are explicit,\" said the Adjutant, who happened to be near, \"not to move until the head of one of the other regiments can be seen on the hills to the right or left. Then we're all to go forward together.\"  \"Yes,\" grumbled Shorty, \"and we'll jest git there in time to see them Illinoy Suckers hog everything. You kin see 'em limberin' up and preparing to git. Just our dumbed luck.\"  It turned out just as Shorty had predicted. The rebel commander had kept a wary eye on the other regiments, and as he saw them gain the point of vantage in the open, where they could make a rush upon him, he ordered a quick retreat. The other regiments raised a yell and charged straight home. By the time the 200th Ind. could reach the gap the other regiments were in full possession, and the rebels out of musket-shot in the valley beyond.  \"I told you so,\" snorted the irate Shorty. \"Now we've lost the advance. To-morrow we'll have to take them other fellers' mud, and pry their teams out o' the holes.\"  \"I wonder how many o' them 25 miles toward Shelbyville we've made to-day?\" asked Si.  \"I heard the Adjutant say,\" said one of his comrades, \"that we'd come just six miles.\"  \"Jewhillikins,\" said Shorty sorrowfully.  Thus ended the first day of the Tullahoma campaign.    CHAPTER II. THE BALKY MULES  SUGGESTIONS GALORE \"SHELBYVILLE ONLY 18 MILES AWAY.\"  NEVER was there so wild a storm but there was a wilder one; never such a downpour of rain but there could be a greater deluge.  \"Seemed to me yesterday,\" said Si, on the morning of June 25, as he vainly tried to peer through the dashing drench and locate some of the other regiments of the division, \"that they was givin' us one of Noah's Deluge days that they'd happened to have left over. Seemed that it couldn't be no worse, but this beats it. I don't think that standin' under Niagara Falls could be no worse. Howsomever, this can't last long. There ain't water enough in the United States to keep this up a great while.\"  \"Don't be so sure o' that,\" said Shorty, handing Si the end of a blanket, that he might help wring it out. \"I believe the Lord sometimes thinks that He didn't divide the land and water jest right in the first place, and that He'd better 've made a big lake o' Tennessee instead o' these old clay knobs for rebels and niggers to roost on, and He starts in to carry out that idee. I wish He'd finish the job at once, and turn the whole blasted region over to the navy. It looks as if He had that in mind now.\"  \"Well,\" said the ever-hopeful Si, \"the Bible says that the rain falls on the just and unjust alike. If it's tough on us, it's jest as tough on them. Their guns wouldn't go off any better'n ours yesterday. If that regiment in front of us could've shot like they can on a dry day they'd 've made a sick time for us.\"  About 60,000 Union soldiers and 45,000 rebels struggled through the deluges of rain, the torrential streams and fathomless mud those June days, when it seemed that every water-gate of the heavens was wide open as it had never been before.  The calamity that Si and Shorty had foreseen came about. The 200th Ind. lost the advance of the brigade and brought up the rear, which meant a long day of muscle-straining, temper-wrecking struggles with stalling wagons, discouraged mules and stupid teamsters. And as Co. Q was the left of the regiment, it caught the worst of all.  The 200th Ind. had scarcely pulled out of camp when its troubles became acute. At the foot of the hill which had been carried the day before ran a brook, ordinarily quite a modest stream, but now raging like a mill-race. The two other regiments of the brigade and all of the 200th Ind. but Co. Q had managed to get across by means of trees which had been felled over the stream at various places. Co. Q was left behind to see that the teams got over, while the rest of the 200th Ind. was halted on the farther bank, to watch the operation and give help if needed. Si, with a squad in which was Shorty, was ordered to take the first team, which it happened Groundhog drove, down into the stream and start it across.  \"Now, be very careful with that wagon,\" called the Adjutant across the stream. \"That has the Headquarters' things and papers. Don't let any water get into the bed. Cross at the shallowest place.\"  Si and Shorty found some poles, and prodded around as well as they were able in the crossing to find the shallowest place. If there was a part so shallow that the bed could be kept above water it was very narrow, and would require exceedingly skillful driving to keep on it. The whole regiment stood around, like a barnyard full of turkeys on a wet day, and looked on with an air of soppy melancholy.  \"Groundhog,\" said Si, approaching that function ary, \"was you watchin' carefully while me and Shorty was pickin' out the shallow places?\"  \"Naw,\" answered he, insolently; \"wasn't watchin' nothin' but my mules. Got enough to do takin' keer o' them, without watchin' a couple o' fools projeckin' around with poles in a mud-hole. No sense in it, nohow. We never kin git acrost that 'ere tail-race. Only thing to do is to go back into camp till it quits rainin' and the water runs out.\"  \"Groundhog,\" said Si resolutely, \"you're not goin' back to camp; you're not goin' to wait till it stops rainin'. You're goin' right over now, as sure as my name's Si Klegg, or I'll break every bone in your karkiss.\"  \"I can't go over,\" persisted Groundhog. \"I ain't no fool. I know better what kin be done with an army wagon and six mules than any Injianny galoot that ever wore stripes or shoulder-straps. You simply can't git a wagon acrost that branch, and I ain't goin' to try.\"  \"Groundhog,\" said Shorty, \"you've bin itchin' to be killed for at least a year, that I know of probably as long as you've lived. You ought've had a stone tied to your neck and bin flung into the crick as soon's you was born. I've promised myself a good many times that I'd about murder you when ever I had time, but something's always made me neglect it. I'm in the killin' mood to-day, and I'd like to begin on you. I certainly will unless you drive that team straight acrost, and don't git a drop o' water in the bed o' the wagon.\"  \"Come, hurry up, over there,\" shouted the Adjutant. \"We can't wait all day. What's the matter with you? Get a move on you.\"  \"All right, sir; we'll start at once, sir,\" said Si with ostentatious alacrity.  Shorty slapped his bayonet on, and brought the point very near Groundhog's abdomen. \"I'll jab this thing clean through you in a holy minute, you pusillanimous basswood cullin'; you pestiferous pile o' pizen, rotten punk,\" he said savagely. \"Git on your wheel-mule and gether up the lines.\"  Impelled by this, and the vigorous clutch of Si upon his collar, Groundhog climbed clumsily into the saddle and sullenly brandished his whip.  The mules made a start and went down the bank, but at the edge of the turbid torrent the leaders set their legs as stiffly as if they were the supports of a sawhorse. They did not make a sound, but somehow the other four understood, with electric suddenness, and their legs set like posts.  \"Jest as I expected,\" said Groundhog, with a grunt of satisfaction; \"they've balked for all day, an' you can't git 'em to move another foot if you killed 'em. They're as solid as if they'd growed there.\"  With an air of having encountered the irresistible, he started to get out of his saddle.  \"Stay in there, confound you,\" said Shorty, prodding him with his bayonet. \"Lick them mules. Make 'em start.\"  \"'Bout as much use in lickin' a white-oak stump,\" said Groundhog, plying the whip viciously as a relief to his feelings. \"You kin lick every inch of skin off 'em, and they won't move no more'n a gravestone.\"  \"Start those mules along. Stop fooling,' said the Adjutant impatiently.  \"We can't start 'em. They're balkin', sir,\" said Si desperately.  \"Nonsense, nonsense,\" said the Adjutant. \"Come ahead. Don't you see you're stopping the Second Brigade and all its teams?\"  The men of the Second Brigade were already swarming across on the logs, while looking backward Si and Shorty could see the road filling up with teams. They ran down to the lead mules and caught them by the bridles and tried to pull them ahead. They might as well have pulled at the giant sycamore trees growing along the banks.  Everybody now began to take an interest in the affair. It is one of the delightful peculiarities of human nature that everybody knows better how to manage a balky horse or mule than the unfortunate man who is trying to.  \"Stop whippin' them mules. You only make them wuss,\" shouted one man authoritatively. \"Tie stones to their tails.\"  \"Tie a string around their ears,\" shouted another. \"That'll be sure to start 'em.\"  \"Bite their ears, you fools. Don't you know nothin' about mules? Bite their ears, I tell you,\" shouted a man from Indianapolis.  \"Throw some hot"]]]
