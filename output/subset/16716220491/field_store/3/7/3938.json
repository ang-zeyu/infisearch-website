E and ⅗ mi.      S Cody, 5020 ft., Park Co., Wyoming; obtained on August 11, 1948,      by James W. Bee, original number 18-8-11-48.       _Range._--In northwestern Wyoming eastward from the Absaroka and      Wind River ranges into the western part of the Big Horn Basin.       _Diagnosis._--A relatively large _Microtus montanus_; tail actually      and relatively long; hind foot actually but not relatively large;      skull large; zygomatic expanse actually and relatively large;      alveolobasilar length relatively large; upper molar tooth-row      relatively long; color relatively light, not reddish.  [Illustration: FIG. 1. Geographic range of _Microtus montanus_ in Wyoming, Colorado, and adjacent areas. The solid circles represent localities from which specimens have been examined; the hollow circles represent type localities. The ranges of subspecies in Utah are after Durrant, 1952.

Certain proportions which differ from those of _nanus_ and which      are not in close agreement with the observed differences with age      in specimens of _nanus_ of a size comparable to _codiensis_ are      relatively large alveolobasilar length, relatively long alveolar      length of upper molar tooth-row, relatively wide-spreading      zygomatic arches, and relatively long tail. The color in      _codiensis_ is lighter than in _nanus_. As compared to the new      subspecies named below from the Big Horn Mountains to the east,      _codiensis_ is of similar size in head-body length, but has a      relatively as well as actually longer tail; the hind foot averages      longer; the upper molar tooth-row is relatively longer; the color      is slightly paler and less grizzled; the bullae are larger and less      flattened; the angle formed at the suture between the basioccipital      and basisphenoid bones is less acute; and the region of the suture      is less prominently elevated between the bullae when viewed from      the ventral aspect. The pterygoid plates mesial and posterodorsal      to the posterior end of the last upper molar are less fenestrated,      and the incisive foramina are less constricted posteriorly.  [Illustration: FIG. 2. Map showing the major barriers to _Microtus montanus_ in Wyoming and Colorado; the barriers are the low areas named on the map (the name \"Black Hills\" is on the map for another reason; these hills are not a barrier). The major mountainous areas higher than approximately 8000 feet in elevation in Wyoming, Colorado and Utah are stippled. These mountainous areas include the habitat that is most suitable for the montane meadow mouse. The Black Hills are unoccupied by this species but these hills seem to be ecologically suitable for the species.]       _Measurements._--The average and the extremes for some measurements      of 34 males and females, 27 from the type locality and 7 from other      localities in the range assigned to this subspecies, are as      follows: total length, 165 (146-186); length of tail, 44.2 (35-55);      hind foot, 19.6 (17-21); condylobasilar length of the skull, 25.5      (24.0-27.5); zygomatic breadth, 15.6 (14.7-16.6); alveolar length      of upper molar tooth-row, 6.6 (6.2-7.0); prelambdoidal breadth, 8.8      (8.1-9.5); lambdoidal breadth, 12.0 (11.2-12.8). As an indication      of variability and for comparison with other series the coefficient      of variability and two times the standard error of the mean for      each measurement in this series are included in Table 1. The      averages for some measurements of 27 topotypes are as follows:      total length, 162; length of tail, 45.5; hind foot, 19.9;      condylobasilar length, 25.6; palatilar length, 14.0; molar series,      6.6; alveolobasilar length, 14.9; zygomatic breadth, 15.6;      interorbital breadth, 3.5; lambdoidal breadth, 12.1; prelambdoidal      breadth, 8.9; depth of braincase, 7.8.  _Discussion._--Three species of _Microtus_ were collected by James W. Bee at the type locality. _Microtus montanus codiensis_, _Microtus longicaudus mordax_, and _Microtus pennsylvanicus modestus_ were taken in the same runways in the same meadow, at the same time. _Microtus ochrogaster haydeni_, although not taken at this locality, occurs in the Big Horn Basin. These four species differ in their geographic ranges, being largely allopatric, except _M. montanus_ and _M. longicaudus_ which are sympatric. Although the different species have ecological preferences and habits which differ, several species of _Microtus_ may occur together in local areas such as the above. Certain of the characteristics of _M. m. codiensis_ are intermediate between those of the species _M. montanus_ on one hand and those of the other three species on the other hand. Could interspecific hybridization between \"good species\" of _Microtus_ take place in nature and possibly alter the characteristics of a local population?       _Specimens examined._--Total, 50, distributed as follows      (abbreviations for collections are given in the account of _M. m.      nanus_; localities that are not represented in Fig. 1 because      overlapping or crowding of the symbols would result are      Italicized):       MONTANA: _Carbon Co._: Beartooth Mountains, 2 (USBS); _Beartooth      Lake_, 1 (USBS).

If our bodies were just like machines, then we could learn about them and manage them quite scientifically as we do automobiles, but they are not like that. They are more than machines that have to be supplied with fuel (food) and kept clean and oiled (by bathing, exercise and sleep). They are the homes of our souls and our feelings, and that makes all the difference in the world in the way we act, and it makes what we have to learn, not limited to science only, but it has to include more difficult and complicated things like psychology and morality.  Maybe I can't make this article help you, but I remember so well what I wanted to know and how I felt when I was young that I am now going to try. And I will tell you to start out with that there is a great deal that nobody knows yet, in spite of the fact that the human race has been struggling thousands of years to learn.  Life itself is still a mystery, especially human life. Human life, in many respects, is like plant and animal life, but in many ways it is entirely different, and the ways in which it is different are almost more important for us to think about than the ways in which it is similar. In all life, except in the very lowest forms, new life is created by the coming together, in a very close and special way, of the male and female elements. You have studied at school about the plants and you probably have observed certain of the animals, so you know something about what this means if you do not understand it thoroughly.  But what you want to know most of all is just how it is with human beings. You want to know just what this coming together is, how it is done, how it starts the new life, the baby, and how the baby is born. You want to understand the wonderful sex organs, that are different in men and women, what each part is for and how it works.  If you feel very curious and excited and shy about it, don't let yourself be a bit worried or ashamed. Your feelings are quite natural, and most everybody else has felt just the same way at your age. Remember that strong feelings are immensely valuable to us. All we need to do is to steer them in the right direction and keep them well balanced and proportioned.  Now in order to understand something of why this subject stirs us so, we must notice in what ways we human beings are _different_ from the plants and animals. About the lowest form of life is the amoeba. It looks like a little lump of jelly, and it produces its young by merely separating itself in two. One part drifts off from the other part and each becomes a separate live being. There is no male and no female and they didn't _know_ they were doing it. In the plants a higher stage of development is reached: there is the male and the female and they join together, not by coming to each other, or because they _know_ they belong together, but quite unconsciously, with the aid of the bees and other insects and the wind, the male part is carried to the female part--they mix, and at once the seed of a new plant begins to grow.  Then come to the animals. In all higher forms of animal life, the male creature _comes_ to the female creature and himself places within her body the germ which, when it meets the egg which is waiting for it, immediately makes a new life begin to grow. But the animals come together without _knowing why_. They do it from instinct only, and they do it in what is called the mating season, which is usually in the spring. The mating season happens once a year among most of the higher animals, like birds and wild cattle, but to some animals it comes several times a year like the rabbits, for instance. You doubtless know already that the more highly developed the animal, the longer it takes the young one to grow before it is born, and the longer the period when it is helpless to provide its own food and care.  Now we come to human beings, and see how different they are! They have no regular mating season, and while there is a certain amount of instinct in men and women which tends to bring them together, the sex impulse among highly developed people is far more the result of their feeling of love for each other than mere animal instinct alone. Many of the animals make no choice at all in their mating. Any near-by female will do for the male. But among some of the higher animals the male has a special instinct for a certain female, and the female will not tolerate any but a certain male. Most of the animals have different mates every season, though there are a few kinds where the male and female, once having mated, remain mates for years, sometimes even for life. But it is _only human beings_ whose mating is what we call “falling in love,” and that is an experience far beyond anything that the animals know.  It means that a man and a woman feel that they _belong_ to each other in a way that they belong to no one else; it makes them wonderfully happy to be together; they find they want to live together, work together, play together, and to have children together, that is, to marry each other; and their dream is to be happy together all their lives. Sometimes the dream does not come true, and there is much failure and unhappiness, but just the same people go right on trying to make it a success, because it is what they care most for.  The sex attraction is the strongest feeling that human beings know, and unlike the animals, it is far more than a mere sensation of the body. It takes in the emotions and the mind and the soul, and that is why our happiness is so dependent upon it.  When a man and a woman fall in love so that they really belong to each other, the physical side of the relation is this: both of them feel at intervals a peculiar thrill or glow, particularly in the sexual organs, and it naturally culminates after they have gone to bed at night. The man's special sex organ or penis, becomes enlarged and stiffened, instead of soft and limp as ordinarily, and thus it easily enters the passage in the woman's body called the vagina or birth-canal, which leads to the uterus or womb, which as perhaps you already know is the sac in which the egg or embryo grows into a baby. The penis and the vagina are about the same size, as Nature intended them to fit each other. By a rhythmic movement of the penis in and out, the sex act reaches an exciting climax or orgasm, when there is for the woman a peculiarly satisfying contraction of the muscles of the passage and for the man, the expulsion of the semen, the liquid which contains the germs of life. This is followed by a sensation of peaceful happiness and sleepy relaxation. It is the very greatest physical pleasure to be had in all human experience, and it helps very much to increase all other kinds of pleasure also. It is at this time that married people not only are closest to each other physically, but they feel closer to each other in every other way too. It is then most of all that they feel _sure_ they belong to each other.  The sex act is called by various names, such as coitus, coition, copulation, cohabitation, sex-intercourse, the sex-embrace, etc. But all these terms refer to the same thing. The first coitus is apt to be somewhat painful for the woman, as there is usually a thin membrane, called the hymen, partly closing the vagina which has to be broken through, but all women do not have it and it varies in size and thickness with different people.  Without the sex act, no babies could be created, for it is by this means only that the semen which contains the male part of the germ of life can meet the ovum or the female part of the germ of life. When the two parts come together in the woman's body under just the right conditions, a baby begins to grow--at first so tiny that it could hardly be seen without a microscope, and finally, after nine months' growth in the uterus or womb of the mother till it weighs about seven or eight pounds, it is born, a live human being. The birth process is called _labor_, and it is indeed labor, for it usually means much pain and struggle for the mother, although the baby's journey from the uterus to the world is only a few inches. It takes anywhere from an hour to two days for a baby to be born. Doctors are learning more and more how to lessen the pain, and by the end of another generation it ought to be possible for child-birth to be practically painless for most women. By that time people will more generally understand how to have babies _only_ when they want them and can afford them. At present, unfortunately, it is against the law to give people information as to how to manage their sex relations so that no baby will be created unless the father and mother are ready and glad to have it happen.  Now you must understand something about this intricate sexual machinery. Plate I shows the woman's organs and Plate 2 the man's.
