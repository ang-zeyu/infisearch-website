Gently she patted and stroked on the wound a paste made of ground rose petals, lime water, and egg white, the Sufi remedy he had taught her to make.  Lorenzo had used his knife to open the hole made by the arrow so that he would not tear Daoud's flesh pulling the barbed head out. While Lorenzo worked over him, Daoud drew upon Saadi's final teaching to him to defend himself against the pain. In his mind he began to create the drug called Soma. He envisioned it as a bowl of glowing, silver-colored liquid, and he believed it could form a capsule around any part of his body where there was pain and wall it off from the rest of himself, at the same time filling him with a feeling of well being.  _Once you have experienced the effects of material drugs on your body and learned to master them_, Saadi said to him, _you have the knowledge you need to create a drug of the mind, Soma. This is more powerful and more reliable, and it will not harm your body in any way. Indeed, Soma will make your body stronger. It will calm your mind, fill you with peace, sometimes give you visions. But if you should suddenly need all your faculties, they are yours at once. The drug is gone in an instant._  It was Saadi's teaching that whatever a man could accomplish with drugs, he could accomplish more effectively and reliably with his mind alone. A trained man could envision a drug that would serve any desired purpose. And thus a man could transcend the Hashishiyya reliance on administered drugs.  While he had drunk from the bowl of Soma and it had flooded through his body, Daoud's fingers had gripped the little leather case hung around his neck that contained the Sufi tawidh, the numerological invocation that he believed would speed his healing. A river of blood had poured out of his leg when Lorenzo drew out the arrow, and he had fainted. Sophia had stitched the wound with cotton thread that was now black with congealed blood.  Now Sophia laid a clean, folded linen cloth over the wound, used another strip of linen to tie the poultice to his leg, and then pulled the blanket up over him. Their eyes had not met once during the time she was caring for him. He found to his surprise that he had to know what she was thinking and feeling.  As if sensing his need, she spoke. \"I have wanted to tell you, but you were too sick to understand me. D'Ucello, the podesta, came here the night of the uprising, looking for you and Lorenzo. As we planned, I told him you had both gone to Perugia.\"  Daoud's body went cold. He felt as if he were being stalked, and the hunter was closing in.  \"Did he believe you?\" he asked.  She shrugged. \"He blustered some, but the cardinal ordered him off in the end. I think he must have hoped to find you among the dead or wounded at the Monaldeschi palace.\"  Daoud rolled over in bed, the wooden frame creaking, and the pain tore through his leg like the slash of a scimitar. He groaned through clenched teeth. Despite his ability to shield his mind from pain when it took him unexpectedly like this, it could hurt like the torments of the damned.  \"What are you doing?\"  He gasped. \"Trying to get up. D'Ucello will be back, and he must not see me wounded.\" He tried to sit up, and she laid her hand, firm and cool, on his forehead and pushed him back against the pillows.  \"You are in more danger from fever than you are from d'Ucello,\" she said, letting her hand rest on his forehead.  \"You will be surprised at how quickly the wound heals,\" he said, touching the tawidh at his neck. \"As for fever, it is healthy. It burns out impurities.\" He laughed bitterly. \"I hope it is burning the stupidity out of me.\"  \"You--stupid?\" She laughed.  He did not join her. It pleased him a little, in the midst of his anguish and self-disgust, to see that she thought well of him. But she was wrong about him--and her life depended on him, and that thought made him feel worse.  \"De Gobignon was waiting for me. He knew I was coming for the Tartars. He _knew_.\"  \"How much could he have known?\" she asked. \"No one knew what your plans were.\"  \"Sophia, if de Gobignon had not been there, I would have been able to kill those two barbarian pigs easily. I did my best, with all my skill, all my training, all my experience, and it went for nothing.\"  That was a pain Soma would not shield him from, the pain of failure. It felt like a mace blow to his chest every time he remembered the fight in the blackness of the spice pantry.  To drive away the damnable memory of being routed by the Christians, he had to concentrate on the present and the future.  \"Send someone to fetch Sordello to me.\"  \"You should be resting.\"  He laughed and touched her hand lightly. \"Resting! Our enemies are not resting.\" She sighed, but went.  When Sordello entered Daoud's room, Lorenzo followed him closely, eyes boring into the back of the mercenary's skull. Sophia entered behind Lorenzo.  Trembling, Sordello knelt by Daoud's bed. \"I feared for you, Messer David. I am happy to see you looking so well.\"  Would Sordello give up the pleasures of hashish and the promise of a paradise with beautiful women? What reward could Simon de Gobignon offer him that could be more enticing?  _Yet, I have always known that this man was a two-edged sword that could turn in my hand._  \"The Monaldeschi were prepared for us,\" said Daoud. \"They were armed and on their battlements when we came. Someone warned them.\"  \"You do not suspect me, Messer David?\" Sordello, crouched on the floor by Daoud's bed, looked up slyly sideways at him. \"I would be a fool to injure one who has been so great a benefactor to me.\"  Daoud felt rage boil up inside him at Sordello's false abjectness. He glared at the old bravo and saw a faint tremor in his jaw.  Propping himself up on one elbow, he leaned toward Sordello. \"Your fawning insults me. I think you lie.\"  Hatred briefly twisted Sordello's face. Then a knowing smile made it even uglier.  \"Messer David, if I had told the Count de Gobignon what I know about you, you would surely be dead by now.\"  Daoud forced himself to his feet. The pain shot through him like a lightning bolt, but in his fury he ignored it. He bent down and seized Sordello's throat with his right hand. He fell back sitting on the bed, pulling the popeyed bravo toward him so that his good knee pressed into the Sordello's chest.  Somewhere, nearby, he heard Sophia cry out in protest, but he paid no attention.  \"Confess that it was you, and I will kill you quickly,\" Daoud whispered. \"I have shown you paradise, and I can show you hell. If you do not give yourself up now, and I find out later that it was you, I will inflict torments of mind and body on you beyond your imagining.\"  \"David, stop, you will kill him!\" Sophia screamed. She gripped Daoud's arm, digging her nails into his muscle.  Gradually Daoud released his hold on the corded throat. With his eyes alone, employing the Hashishiyya \"look that imprisons,\" he held Sordello fast. The bravo's eyes were bloodshot and red-rimmed.  He was glad Sophia had stopped him. She must have realized that he would regret it if he killed Sordello in a fit of rage. If Sordello had not betrayed them, his false reports to Simon de Gobignon would still be useful. And in any case his sudden disappearance immediately after the attack on the Monaldeschi palace would draw de Gobignon's attention.  \"If it is not you, then there is another among us who told Simon de Gobignon about my plans. If you want to save your life, you will find out who it is.\"  \"I promise you, Messere.\" Sordello's voice was a hoarse croak. \"Whoever the escremento is, I will deliver his life into your hands.\"  Sordello stood up, then turned to Sophia and bowed.  \"Madonna,\" Sordello gasped. \"My eternal gratitude--\"  \"Just get out,\" Sophia snapped.  Was there a suggestion of a leer in Sordello's lumpy face as he stared at Sophia? But pain spread from the wound in Daoud's leg in great ripples through him, and he lay back and concentrated on the Sufi exercise that detached him from his body.  The heavy oak door closed behind Sordello. They were all three silent for a moment. Then Lorenzo jerked the door open and looked out into the corridor. He nodded, indicating Sordello had truly gone.  \"It might have been wiser to strangle him,\" said Lorenzo. \"He has all our lives in his hands.\"  Daoud held up his hand. \"What he said was true. He could have delivered us to our enemies before the attack. I believe he is still in my power.\"         *       *       *       *       *  When alone with Sophia, Daoud lay back on his cushions. She stood looking down at him, and he wondered if that was pity he saw in her face.  \"You are in such pain,\" she said.  He shook his head. \"It is nothing.\"  \"I do not mean the pain of the body.\"  She understood, then, what he was feeling. He smiled at her and shut his eyes.  She sat in silence on the edge of the bed while he lay there, brooding. Again he escaped into drowsiness. His mind drifted back to the sands of Egypt. He dreamed again of riding as a Mameluke.  When he woke, a short time had passed, and Sophia was still sitting there, gazing down at him.  Hints of a new plan began to come together in his mind. As fever purged him of poison, it had brought him dreams of battle. Not of intrigues with the priests and bishops around the pope. Not of ambushes in narrow streets. Rather, open war.  That was the meaning of those dreams. Perhaps God Himself had sent them. He was called upon to wage jihad against the enemies of Islam as a Mameluke, on horseback, at the head of an army.  He held out his arm to Sophia. \"Help me up. You and Lorenzo and I must meet with Ugolini.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Later that morning, a heavy spring rain hammered on the windows of Ugolini's cabinet. The storm had so darkened the room that the cardinal's servants had lit extra candles.

Don’t move, I       beg you, Watson. He is a professional brother of yours, and your       presence may be of assistance to me. Now is the dramatic moment       of fate, Watson, when you hear a step upon the stair which is       walking into your life, and you know not whether for good or ill.       What does Dr. James Mortimer, the man of science, ask of Sherlock       Holmes, the specialist in crime? Come in!”        The appearance of our visitor was a surprise to me, since I had       expected a typical country practitioner. He was a very tall, thin       man, with a long nose like a beak, which jutted out between two       keen, grey eyes, set closely together and sparkling brightly from       behind a pair of gold-rimmed glasses. He was clad in a       professional but rather slovenly fashion, for his frock-coat was       dingy and his trousers frayed. Though young, his long back was       already bowed, and he walked with a forward thrust of his head       and a general air of peering benevolence. As he entered his eyes       fell upon the stick in Holmes’s hand, and he ran towards it with       an exclamation of joy. “I am so very glad,” said he. “I was not       sure whether I had left it here or in the Shipping Office. I       would not lose that stick for the world.”        “A presentation, I see,” said Holmes.        “Yes, sir.”        “From Charing Cross Hospital?”        “From one or two friends there on the occasion of my marriage.”        “Dear, dear, that’s bad!” said Holmes, shaking his head.        Dr. Mortimer blinked through his glasses in mild astonishment.       “Why was it bad?”        “Only that you have disarranged our little deductions. Your       marriage, you say?”        “Yes, sir. I married, and so left the hospital, and with it all       hopes of a consulting practice. It was necessary to make a home       of my own.”        “Come, come, we are not so far wrong, after all,” said Holmes.       “And now, Dr. James Mortimer—”        “Mister, sir, Mister—a humble M.R.C.S.”        “And a man of precise mind, evidently.”        “A dabbler in science, Mr. Holmes, a picker up of shells on the       shores of the great unknown ocean. I presume that it is Mr.       Sherlock Holmes whom I am addressing and not—”        “No, this is my friend Dr. Watson.”        “Glad to meet you, sir. I have heard your name mentioned in       connection with that of your friend. You interest me very much,       Mr. Holmes. I had hardly expected so dolichocephalic a skull or       such well-marked supra-orbital development. Would you have any       objection to my running my finger along your parietal fissure? A       cast of your skull, sir, until the original is available, would       be an ornament to any anthropological museum. It is not my       intention to be fulsome, but I confess that I covet your skull.”        Sherlock Holmes waved our strange visitor into a chair. “You are       an enthusiast in your line of thought, I perceive, sir, as I am       in mine,” said he. “I observe from your forefinger that you make       your own cigarettes. Have no hesitation in lighting one.”        The man drew out paper and tobacco and twirled the one up in the       other with surprising dexterity. He had long, quivering fingers       as agile and restless as the antennæ of an insect.        Holmes was silent, but his little darting glances showed me the       interest which he took in our curious companion. “I presume,       sir,” said he at last, “that it was not merely for the purpose of       examining my skull that you have done me the honour to call here       last night and again today?”        “No, sir, no; though I am happy to have had the opportunity of       doing that as well. I came to you, Mr. Holmes, because I       recognized that I am myself an unpractical man and because I am       suddenly confronted with a most serious and extraordinary       problem. Recognizing, as I do, that you are the second highest       expert in Europe—”        “Indeed, sir! May I inquire who has the honour to be the first?”       asked Holmes with some asperity.        “To the man of precisely scientific mind the work of Monsieur       Bertillon must always appeal strongly.”        “Then had you not better consult him?”        “I said, sir, to the precisely scientific mind. But as a       practical man of affairs it is acknowledged that you stand alone.       I trust, sir, that I have not inadvertently—”        “Just a little,” said Holmes. “I think, Dr. Mortimer, you would       do wisely if without more ado you would kindly tell me plainly       what the exact nature of the problem is in which you demand my       assistance.”     Chapter 2. The Curse of the Baskervilles         “I have in my pocket a manuscript,” said Dr. James Mortimer.        “I observed it as you entered the room,” said Holmes.        “It is an old manuscript.”        “Early eighteenth century, unless it is a forgery.”        “How can you say that, sir?”        “You have presented an inch or two of it to my examination all       the time that you have been talking. It would be a poor expert       who could not give the date of a document within a decade or so.       You may possibly have read my little monograph upon the subject.       I put that at 1730.”        “The exact date is 1742.” Dr. Mortimer drew it from his       breast-pocket. “This family paper was committed to my care by Sir       Charles Baskerville, whose sudden and tragic death some three       months ago created so much excitement in Devonshire. I may say       that I was his personal friend as well as his medical attendant.       He was a strong-minded man, sir, shrewd, practical, and as       unimaginative as I am myself. Yet he took this document very       seriously, and his mind was prepared for just such an end as did       eventually overtake him.”        Holmes stretched out his hand for the manuscript and flattened it       upon his knee. “You will observe, Watson, the alternative use of       the long _s_ and the short. It is one of several indications       which enabled me to fix the date.”        I looked over his shoulder at the yellow paper and the faded       script. At the head was written: “Baskerville Hall,” and below in       large, scrawling figures: “1742.”        “It appears to be a statement of some sort.”        “Yes, it is a statement of a certain legend which runs in the       Baskerville family.”        “But I understand that it is something more modern and practical       upon which you wish to consult me?”        “Most modern. A most practical, pressing matter, which must be       decided within twenty-four hours. But the manuscript is short and       is intimately connected with the affair. With your permission I       will read it to you.”        Holmes leaned back in his chair, placed his finger-tips together,       and closed his eyes, with an air of resignation. Dr. Mortimer       turned the manuscript to the light and read in a high, cracking       voice the following curious, old-world narrative:          “Of the origin of the Hound of the Baskervilles there have been         many statements, yet as I come in a direct line from Hugo         Baskerville, and as I had the story from my father, who also         had it from his, I have set it down with all belief that it         occurred even as is here set forth. And I would have you         believe, my sons, that the same Justice which punishes sin may         also most graciously forgive it, and that no ban is so heavy         but that by prayer and repentance it may be removed.  Learn         then from this story not to fear the fruits of the past, but         rather to be circumspect in the future, that those foul         passions whereby our family has suffered so grievously may not         again be loosed to our undoing.              “Know then that in the time of the Great Rebellion (the             history of which by the learned Lord Clarendon I most             earnestly commend to your attention) this Manor of             Baskerville was held by Hugo of that name, nor can it be             gainsaid that he was a most wild, profane, and godless man.              This, in truth, his neighbours might have pardoned, seeing             that saints have never flourished in those parts, but there             was in him a certain wanton and cruel humour which made his             name a by-word through the West.  It chanced that this Hugo             came to love (if, indeed, so dark a passion may be known             under so bright a name) the daughter of a yeoman who held             lands near the Baskerville estate. But the young maiden,             being discreet and of good repute, would ever avoid him,             for she feared his evil name.  So it came to pass that one             Michaelmas this Hugo, with five or six of his idle and             wicked companions, stole down upon the farm and carried off             the maiden, her father and brothers being from home, as he             well knew.  When they had brought her to the Hall the             maiden was placed in an upper chamber, while Hugo and his             friends sat down to a long carouse, as was their nightly             custom.  Now, the poor lass upstairs was like to have her             wits turned at the singing and shouting and terrible oaths             which came up to her from below, for they say that the             words used by Hugo Baskerville, when he was in wine, were             such as might blast the man who said them.  At last in the             stress of her fear she did that which might have daunted             the bravest or most active man, for by the aid of the             growth of ivy which covered (an"]]]
