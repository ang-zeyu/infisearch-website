G.H.Q. is sending me on a mission for a fortnight to one of your Brittany ports; I am to organize the training of the Portuguese Division. I have orders to take an interpreter with me. I thought of you for the job.\"  \"But,\" Aurelle put in, \"I don't know a word of Portuguese.\"  \"What does that matter?\" said the colonel. \"You're an interpreter, aren't you? Isn't that enough?\"    *  *  *  *  *  The following day Aurelle told his servant to try and find a Portuguese in the little town of Estrées.  \"Brommit is an admirable fellow,\" said Colonel Parker, \"he found whisky for me in the middle of the bush, and quite drinkable beer in France. If I say to him, 'Don't come back without a Portuguese,' he is sure to bring one with him, dead or alive.\"  As a matter of fact, that very evening he brought back with him a nervous, talkative little man.  \"Ze Poortooguez in fifteen days,\" exclaimed the little man, gesticulating freely with his small plump hands \"A language so rich, so flexible, in fifteen days! Ah, you have ze luck, young man, to 'ave found in zis town Juan Garretos, of Portalègre, Master of Arts of ze University of Coimbra, and positivist philosopher. Ze Poortooguez in fifteen days! Do you know at least ze Low Latin? ze Greek? ze Hebrew? ze Arabic? ze Chinese? If not, it is useless to go furzer.\"  Aurelle confessed his ignorance.  \"Never mind,\" said Juan Garretos indulgently; \"ze shape of your 'ead inspire me wiz confidence: for ten francs ze hour I accept you. Only, mind, no chattering; ze Latins always talk too much. Not a single word of ze English between us now. _Faz favor d'fallar Portuguez_--do me ze favour of speaking ze Poortooguez. Know first zat, in ze Poortooguez, one speak in ze zird person. You must call your speaker Excellency.'\"  \"What's that?\" Aurelle interrupted. \"I thought you had just had a democratic revolution.\"  \"Precisely,\" said the positivist philosopher, wringing his little hands, \"precisely. In France you made ze revoluçaoung in order zat every man should be called 'citizen.' What a waste of energy! In Poortugal we made ze revoluçaoung in order zat every man should be called 'His Highness.' Instead of levelling down we levelled up. It is better. Under ze old order ze children of ze poor were _rapachos_, and zose of ze aristocracy were _meninos_: now zey are all _meninos_. Zat is a revoluçaoung! _Faz favor d'fallar Portuguez._ Ze Latins always talk too much.\"  Having thus earned his ten francs by an hour's unceasing eloquence, he made a fairer proposal to Aurelle next day.  \"I will arrange with you for a fixed sum,\" he said. \"If I teach you two souzand words, you give me fifty francs.\"  \"Very well,\" replied Aurelle, \"two thousand words will be a sufficient vocabulary to begin with.\"  \"All right,\" said Juan Garretos; \"now listen to me. All ze words which in ze English end with 'tion' are ze same in ze Poortooguez wiz ze ending 'çaoung.' Revolution--_revoluçaoung_; constitution--_constituçaoung_; inquisition--_inquisiçaoung_. Now zere are in ze English two souzand words ending in 'tion.' Your Excellency owes me fifty francs. _Faz favor d'fallar Portuguez._\"    *  *  *  *  *  A fortnight later Colonel Parker and Aurelle stepped on to the platform at B----, where they were met by Major Baraquin, the officer commanding the garrison, and Captain Pereira, the Portuguese liaison officer.  Major Baraquin was a very old soldier. He had seen service--in the 1870 campaign. All strangers, Allies included, inspired him with a distrust which even his respect for his superiors failed to remove. When the French War Office ordered him to place his barracks at the disposal of a British colonel, discipline required him to obey, but hostile memories inspired him with savage resistance.  \"After all, sir,\" said Aurelle to Parker, \"his grandfather was at Waterloo.\"  \"Are you quite sure,\" asked the colonel, \"that he was not there himself?\"  Above all things, Major Baraquin would never admit that the armies of other nations might have different habits from his own. That the British soldier should eat jam and drink tea filled him with generous indignation.  \"The colonel,\" Aurelle translated, \"requests me to ask you ...\"  \"No, no, _no_,\" replied Major Baraquin in stentorian tones, without troubling to listen any further.  \"But it will be necessary, sir, for the Portuguese who are going to land....\"  \"No, no, _no_, I tell you,\" Major Baraquin repeated, resolved upon ignoring demands which he considered subversive and childish. This refrain was as far as he ever got in his conversations with Aurelle.    *  *  *  *  *  Next day several large British transports arrived, and disgorged upon the quay thousands of small, black-haired men who gazed mournfully upon the alien soil. It was snowing, and most of them were seeing snow for the first time in their lives. They wandered about in the mud, shivering in their spotted blue cotton uniforms and dreaming, no doubt, of sunny Alemtejo.  \"They'll fight well,\" said Captain Pereira, \"they'll fight well. Wellington called them his fighting cocks, and Napoleon said his Portuguese legion made the best troops in the world. But can you wonder they are sad?\"  Each of them had brought with him a pink handkerchief containing his collection of souvenirs--little reminders of his village, his people, or his best girl--and when they were told that they could not take their pink parcels with them to the front, there was a heart-breaking outcry.  Major Baraquin, with unconscious and sinister humour, had quartered them in the shambles.  \"It would be better----\" began Colonel Parker.  \"Il vaudrait peut-être mieux----\" Aurelle attempted to translate.  \"Vossa Excellencia----\" began Captain Pereira.  \"No, no, _no_,\" said the old warrior passionately.  The Portuguese went to the shambles.     CHAPTER IV  A BUSINESS MAN IN THE ARMY    \"The reasonable man adapts himself to the world; the unreasonable    one persists in trying to adapt the world to himself. Therefore    all progress depends on the unreasonable man.\"--G. B. Shaw (in    _A Revolutionist's Handbook_).   Colonel Musgrave of the R.A.S.C. had been instructed to superintend the supply and transport arrangements of the Portuguese Division, and Lieutenant Barefoot, in charge of a Labour Company, had been detailed to assist him.  \"These men,\" he explained to Colonel Musgrave, \"are all Southampton dockers. In peace time I am their employer, and Sergeant Scott over there is their foreman. They tell me your Labour Companies have often shown rather poor discipline. There's no fear of anything like that with my men; they have been chosen with care, and look up to me as if I were a king. Scott, my sergeant, can do anything; neither he nor my men ever drink a drop. As for me, I am a real business man, and I intend to introduce new methods into the army.\"  Barefoot was fifty years old; he had a bald head shaped like an egg. He had just enlisted to serve his King and country, and was overflowing with goodwill.  The next morning twenty of his men were dead-drunk, two were absent at roll-call, and Sergeant Scott had a scar on his nose which seemed to be the result of a somewhat sudden encounter with mother earth.  \"No matter,\" said the worthy N.C.O., \"Barefoot is an ass, and never notices anything.\"  Next day the first batch of Portuguese troops arrived. British tugs towed the huge transports round the tiny harbour with graceful ease, and the decks seethed with masses of troops. The harbour captain and the _Ponts et Chaussées_ engineer were loud in protest against these wonders, as being \"contrary to the ideas of the Service.\" The wharves were filled with motor lorries, mountains of pressed hay, sacks of oats and boxes of biscuits.  Colonel Musgrave, who was to take charge of this treasure-store, began to make his plan of campaign.  \"To-morrow, Friday,\" he said, \"there will be a parade on the wharf at 7 a.m. I shall hold an inspection myself before work is begun.\"  On Friday morning at seven, Barefoot, his labourers and the lorries were all paraded on the wharf in excellent order. At eight the colonel got up, had his bath and shaved. Then he partook of eggs and bacon, bread and jam, and drank two cups of tea. Towards nine o'clock his car took him to the wharf. When he saw the men standing motionless, the officer saluting and the lorries all in a row, his face went as red as a brick, and he stood up in his car and addressed them angrily:  \"So you are incapable of the slightest initiative! If I am absent for an hour, detained by more important work, everything comes to a standstill! I see I cannot rely on anyone here except myself!\"  The same evening he called the officers together.  \"To-morrow, Saturday,\" he said, \"there will be a parade at 7 a. m.--and this time I shall be there.\"  The next morning Barefoot with his men and lorries paraded once more on the wharf, with a sea-wind sweeping an icy rain into their faces. At half-past seven the lieutenant took action.  \"We will start work,\" he said. \"The colonel was quite right yesterday and spoke like a real business man. In our respect for narrow formalism, we stupidly wasted a whole morning's work.\"  So his men began to pile up the cases, the lorries started to move the sacks of oats, and the day's work was pretty well advanced when Colonel Musgrave appeared. Having had his bath and shaved, and absorbed poached eggs on toast, bread, marmalade and three cups of tea, he had not been able to be ready before ten. Suddenly coming upon all this healthy bustle, he leaped out of his car, and angrily addressed the eager Barefoot, who was"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30597"],["title","The Battle of Atlanta (#1)"],["body","chaos. It was impossible to obtain provisions, accouterments, equipment, or anything else upon a proper requisition. Everything seemed to require an order from one of General Fremont's staff, and my own Regiment suffered a long time before I could get for it the necessary arms, clothing, equipment, etc.  While I was at Rolla the dispatch sent by the Government to General Curtis, to be forwarded to Fremont at Springfield, relieving him of the command, was brought by a staff officer to me with the request that I should see that the staff officer had an escort and went through promptly to Springfield. General Curtis, who was from my own state, wrote me a private note stating the importance of pushing this staff officer through. President Lincoln sent the order to General Curtis with this peculiar note:      WASHINGTON, October 24, 1861.      _Brigadier-General S. R. Curtis_:      MY DEAR SIR:--Herewith is a document, half letter, half order, which,     wishing you to see but not to make public, I send unsealed. Please     read it and then inclose it to the officer who may be in command of     the Department of the West at the time it reaches you. I cannot know     now whether Fremont or Hunter will then be in command. Yours truly,      A. LINCOLN.  In a few days I received a letter from General Hunter, who had relieved General Fremont, instructing me that thereafter everything in the department must be carried on in accordance with the orders of the War Department and the Army Regulations, and I immediately saw a change for the better. I was soldier enough, although I had not had much experience then, to know that the methods being pursued under Fremont could bring nothing but disaster to the service. Every order was signed by somebody acting as a General, a Colonel, or something else, while in fact many of them had no rank whatever, and in looking over my own orders I do not know why I did not sign myself as an Acting General, as those who succeeded me did. Even after General Halleck took command I noticed in the orders of General Hunter that he assigned persons to the command of a Brigade as Acting Brigadier-Generals instead of their rank as Colonel Commanding, etc.  I remained at Rolla until the return of the troops under General Hunter; and finally those commanded by Siegel, Asboth and Osterhaus were encamped at Rolla outside of the post and were reporting directly to the commanding officer of the department, while I as post commander reported directly to the same authority.  General Hunter as soon as he took command wired the War Department that there was no force of the enemy in his neighborhood, although orders had been given by Fremont a day or two before to march out and fight Price's Army. Hunter, therefore, in accordance with his orders from Washington, abandoned the pursuit, although with the force he had he could have driven Price and McCullough south of the Arkansas River, and probably have avoided the later campaign that ended in the Battle of Pea Ridge. Hunter moved his forces back to Rolla and Sedalia and sent 18,000 of his men to join General Grant in the campaigns up the Tennessee River.  This force at Rolla was mostly Germans, and the change of commanders from Fremont to Hunter, and later to Halleck, was unsatisfactory to them, though one of the officers, General Osterhaus, took no part in the feeling and sentiment that seemed to exist that for success it was necessary to have Fremont or Siegel in command, and my understanding was that the force at Rolla during the winter of 1861-62 was the nucleus of the force that was again to march to the Southwest under the orders of General Halleck and to be commanded by General Siegel. General Halleck, when he assumed command of the department, in his letters to the War Department and his orders to the troops showed plainly his disgust at the condition of matters in that department. He wrote to the War Department:      One week's experience here is sufficient to prove that everything is     in complete chaos. The most astounding orders and contracts for     supplies of all kinds have been made, and large amounts purported to     have been received, but there is nothing to show that they have ever     been properly issued and they cannot now be found.  Of the condition of the troops he found in his department, he wrote:      Some of these corps are not only organized in a way entirely contrary     to law, but are by no means reliable, being mostly foreigners, and     officered in many cases by foreign adventurers, or perhaps refugees     from justice; and, having been tampered with by political partizans     for political purposes, they constitute a very dangerous element to     society as well as to the Army itself. Wherever they go they convert     all Union men into bitter enemies. The men, if properly officered,     would make good soldiers, but with their present officers they are     little better than an armed mob.  They were not paid, had not been mustered into our service, and the commissions emanated from General Fremont, not from the State or Government.  General Halleck's plans evidently were to make a campaign against Price as soon as he could organize the forces concentrated at Rolla. Price's headquarters were at Springfield, and his northerly line was along the Osage Valley. His force was estimated anywhere from 10,000 to 30,000. As outposts General Halleck had Rolla, Jefferson City, and Sedalia. There was located at Rolla five or six thousand troops; at Sedalia and along that line about ten or twelve thousand, under General Pope, including Jeff C. Davis's Division; but these troops Halleck intended to send down the Mississippi and up the Tennessee.  General Pope in his letters to General Halleck urged that he be allowed to move on Price and destroy his Army, which he said he could do with his force. Rumors of Price's force and their movements were a constant terror and excitement throughout Missouri. The whole of northern Missouri was aroused by Price's proximity, and all the counties had recruiting officers from his Army enrolling and sending it recruits. The numbers of these recruiting officers and their small squads of recruits were magnified into thousands, and Price, when he sent a thousand men to Lexington for the purpose of holding that place and recruiting, brought orders from Halleck for a movement of all the troops to cut him off. The prompt movement of Halleck kept him from remaining there very long, but he was enabled to take about three thousand recruits from there without molestation from us.  Price's campaign as planned for the winter was to have General McCullough's Arkansas force, which was lying at Cross Timbers, near Elkhorn Tavern, and Van Buren in Arkansas, join him. Price complained bitterly of his inability to obtain any aid from McCullough, stating that if he could obtain it he could march into northern Missouri and hold the State, and recruit there an Army of Missourians; which, from my experience in the State, I have no doubt he would have done if he could have moved there and held his position.  General Halleck's plan evidently was to move a body from Rolla directly on Springfield, with the intention of striking and defeating Price before Price could receive reinforcements, but Halleck had a great disinclination to move until he had organized the forces in the State of Missouri into Brigades and Divisions, had them properly mustered and officered, and had his staff departments so arranged that they could be depended upon to take care of any moving column. This disinclination of Halleck to move carried us on to the first of January.  In December General Siegel was given command of the troops at Rolla, and Captain Phil Sheridan was sent there as Quartermaster for that Army. His ability and foresight in organizing the transportation of an Army, feeding it, and fitting it for a campaign, was shown every day.  On December 26th General Halleck assigned General S. R. Curtis to the command of the District of Southwest Missouri. This included the forces under Siegel at Rolla, and caused very severe comments from them. From the letters of Halleck, written at the time and afterwards, this placing of Siegel under Curtis was caused by the letters and opinions--in fact, the denunciations--of Siegel made by Captains Schofield, Totten, and Sturgis, when with Lyon in the Wilson's Creek campaign. Evidently Halleck lost all faith in Siegel as commander of the Southwestern Army, and therefore assigned Brigadier-General Samuel R. Curtis, who had been stationed at St. Louis, to the command. But General Siegel was still left in command of two Divisions of the troops near Rolla, which was a great mistake.  As soon as General Curtis assumed command General Halleck commenced urging him to move to the south on Springfield, agreeing to send to him Colonel Jeff C. Davis's Division to join him before reaching Springfield, which Division was about 5,000 strong, and was with Pope on the Lamine River line. Curtis hesitated, and did not feel secure with the forces he had, although Halleck did not believe Price would stand for a fight, or that Curtis would need Jeff C. Davis's Division.  The Army of the Southwest, about seven thousand strong, was organized at Rolla, and moved from there January 14th, towards Springfield, halting at Lebanon. From Lebanon it moved on to Marshfield, where Colonel Jeff C. Davis, with his Division, joined it. Great preparations were made there for the attack upon Price, and we moved out of Marshfield prepared for battle, General Siegel commanding the First and Second Divisions, one under General Osterhaus and the other under General Asboth. General Jeff C. Davis, from General Pope's Army, commanded the Third Division, and Colonel Eugene A. Carr the Fourth Division, a Brigade of which I commanded.  When within about three miles of Springfield we received orders to attack that town the next morning, and"]]]
