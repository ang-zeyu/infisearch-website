She carries an obsolete \"barbette\" conning-tower--a six-foot affair with railed platform forward--and our warning beam plays on the top of it as a policeman's lantern flashes on the area sneak. Like a sneak-thief, too, emerges a shock-headed navigator in his shirt-sleeves. Captain Purnall wrenches open the colloid to talk with him man to man. There are times when Science does not satisfy.  \"What under the stars are you doing here, you sky-scraping chimney-sweep?\" he shouts as we two drift side by side. \"Do you know this is a Mail-lane? You call yourself a sailor, sir? You ain't fit to peddle toy balloons to an Esquimaux. Your name and number! Report and get down, and be----!\"  \"I've been blown up once,\" the shock-headed man cries, hoarsely, as a dog barking. \"I don't care two flips of a contact for anything _you_ can do, Postey.\"  \"Don't you, sir? But I'll make you care. I'll have you towed stern first to Disko and broke up. You can't recover insurance if you're broke for obstruction. Do you understand _that_?\"  Then the stranger bellows: \"Look at my propellers! There's been a wulli-wa down under that has knocked us into umbrella-frames! We've been blown up about forty thousand feet! We're all one conjuror's watch inside! My mate's arm's broke; my engineer's head's cut open; my Ray went out when the engines smashed; and ... and ... for pity's sake give me my height, Captain! We doubt we're dropping.\"  \"Six thousand eight hundred. Can you hold it?\" Captain Purnall overlooks all insults, and leans half out of the colloid, staring and snuffing. The stranger leaks pungently.  \"We ought to blow into St. John's with luck. We're trying to plug the fore-tank now, but she's simply whistling it away,\" her captain wails.  \"She's sinking like a log,\" says Captain Purnall in an undertone. \"Call up the Banks Mark Boat, George.\" Our dip-dial shows that we, keeping abreast the tramp, have dropped five hundred feet the last few minutes.  Captain Purnall presses a switch and our signal beam begins to swing through the night, twizzling spokes of light across infinity.  \"That'll fetch something,\" he says, while Captain Hodgson watches the General Communicator. He has called up the North Banks Mark Boat, a few hundred miles west, and is reporting the case.  \"I'll stand by you,\" Captain Purnall roars to the lone figure on the conning-tower.  \"Is it as bad as that?\" comes the answer. \"She isn't insured, she's mine.\"  \"Might have guessed as much,\" mutters Hodgson. \"Owner's risk is the worst risk of all!\"  \"Can't I fetch St. John's--not even with this breeze?\" the voice quavers.  \"Stand by to abandon ship. Haven't you _any_ lift in you, fore or aft?\"  \"Nothing but the midship tanks and they're none too tight. You see, my Ray gave out and--\" he coughs in the reek of the escaping gas.  \"You poor devil!\" This does not reach our friend. \"What does the Mark Boat say, George?\"  \"Wants to know if there's any danger to traffic. Says she's in a bit of weather herself and can't quit station. I've turned in a General Call, so even if they don't see our beam some one's bound to help--or else we must. Shall I clear our slings. Hold on! Here we are! A Planet liner, too! She'll be up in a tick!\"  \"Tell her to have her slings ready,\" cries his brother captain. \"There won't be much time to spare.... Tie up your mate,\" he roars to the tramp.  \"My mate's all right. It's my engineer. He's gone crazy.\"  \"Shunt the lift out of him with a spanner. Hurry!\"  \"But I can make St. John's if you'll stand by.\"  \"You'll make the deep, wet Atlantic in twenty minutes. You're less than fifty-eight hundred now. Get your papers.\"  A Planet liner, east bound, heaves up in a superb spiral and takes the air of us humming. Her underbody colloid is open and her transporter-slings hang down like tentacles. We shut off our beam as she adjusts herself--steering to a hair--over the tramp's conning-tower. The mate comes up, his arm strapped to his side, and stumbles into the cradle. A man with a ghastly scarlet head follows, shouting that he must go back and build up his Ray. The mate assures him that he will find a nice new Ray all ready in the liner's engine-room. The bandaged head goes up wagging excitedly. A youth and a woman follow. The liner cheers hollowly above us, and we see the passengers' faces at the saloon colloid.  \"That's a good girl. What's the fool waiting for now?\" says Captain Purnall.  The skipper comes up, still appealing to us to stand by and see him fetch St. John's. He dives below and returns--at which we little human beings in the void cheer louder than ever--with the ship's kitten. Up fly the liner's hissing slings; her underbody crashes home and she hurtles away again. The dial shows less than 3,000 feet.  The Mark Boat signals we must attend to the derelict, now whistling her death song, as she falls beneath us in long sick zigzags.  \"Keep our beam on her and send out a General Warning,\" says Captain Purnall, following her down.  There is no need. Not a liner in air but knows the meaning of that vertical beam and gives us and our quarry a wide berth.  \"But she'll drown in the water, won't she?\" I ask.  \"Not always,\" is his answer. \"I've known a derelict up-end and sift her engines out of herself and flicker round the Lower Lanes for three weeks on her forward tanks only. We'll run no risks. Pith her, George, and look sharp. There's weather ahead.\"  Captain Hodgson opens the underbody colloid, swings the heavy pithing-iron out of its rack which in liners is generally cased as a settee, and at two hundred feet releases the catch. We hear the whir of the crescent-shaped arms opening as they descend. The derelict's forehead is punched in, starred across, and rent diagonally. She falls stern first, our beam upon her; slides like a lost soul down that pitiless ladder of light, and the Atlantic takes her.  [Illustration: \"SLIDES LIKE A LOST SOUL DOWN THAT PITILESS LADDER OF LIGHT, AND THE ATLANTIC TAKES HER\"]  \"A filthy business,\" says Hodgson. \"I wonder what it must have been like in the old days.\"  The thought had crossed my mind too. What if that wavering carcass had been filled with International-speaking men of all the Internationalities, each one of them taught (_that_ is the horror of it!) that after death he would very possibly go forever to unspeakable torment?  And not half a century since, we (one knows now that we are only our fathers re-enlarged upon the earth), _we_, I say, ripped and rammed and pithed to admiration.  Here Tim, from the control-platform, shouts that we are to get into our inflators and to bring him his at once.  We hurry into the heavy rubber suits--and the engineers are already dressed--and inflate at the air-pump taps. G. P. O. inflators are thrice as thick as a racing man's \"flickers,\" and chafe abominably under the armpits. George takes the wheel until Tim has blown himself up to the extreme of rotundity. If you kicked him off the c. p. to the deck he would bounce back. But it is \"162\" that will do the kicking.  \"The Mark Boat's mad--stark ravin' crazy,\" he snorts, returning to command. \"She says there's a bad blow-out ahead and wants me to pull over to Greenland. I'll see her pithed first! We wasted an hour and a quarter over that dead duck down under, and now I'm expected to go rubbin' my back all round the Pole. What does she think a postal packet's made of? Gummed silk? Tell her we're coming on straight, George.\"  George buckles him into the Frame and switches on the Direct Control. Now under Tim's left toe lies the port-engine Accelerator; under his left heel the Reverse, and so with the other foot. The lift-shunt stops stand out on the rim of the steering-wheel where the fingers of his left hand can play on them. At his right hand is the midships engine lever ready to be thrown into gear at a moment's notice. He leans forward in his belt, eyes glued to the colloid, and one ear cocked toward the General Communicator. Henceforth he is the strength and direction of \"162,\" through whatever may befall.  The Banks Mark Boat is reeling out pages of A. B. C. Directions to the traffic at large. We are to secure all \"loose objects\"; hood up our Fleury Rays; and \"on no account to attempt to clear snow from our conning-towers till the weather abates.\" Under-powered craft, we are told, can ascend to the limit of their lift, mail-packets to look out for them accordingly; the lower lanes westward are pitting very badly, \"with frequent blow-outs, vortices, laterals, etc.\"  Still the clear dark holds up unblemished. The only warning is the electric skin-tension (I feel as though I were a lace-maker's pillow) and an irritability which the gibbering of the General Communicator increases almost to hysteria.  We have made eight thousand feet since we pithed the tramp and our turbines are giving us an honest two hundred and ten knots.  Very far to the west an elongated blur of red, low down, shows us the North Banks Mark Boat. There are specks of fire round her rising and falling--bewildered planets about an unstable sun--helpless shipping hanging on to her light for company's sake. No wonder she could not quit station.  She warns us to look out for the backwash of the bad vortex in which (her beam shows it) she is even now reeling.  The pits of gloom about us begin to fill with very faintly luminous films--wreathing and uneasy shapes. One forms itself into a globe of pale flame that waits shivering with eagerness till we sweep by. It leaps monstrously across the blackness, alights on the precise tip of our nose, pirouettes there an instant, and swings off. Our roaring bow sinks as though that light were lead--sinks and recovers to lurch and stumble again beneath the next blow-out. Tim's fingers on the lift-shunt strike chords of numbers--1:4:7:--2:4:6:--7:5:3, and so on; for he is running by his tanks only, lifting or lowering her against the uneasy air.
