Why?”  “Because, Sir Robert—I will tell you, as you always like to hear the truth—their advertisement-editor is of opinion that Sahara Limited is  a national and imperial swindle. He says that he won’t drag the nation  and the empire into it in an editorial under fifty guineas.”  A faint smile flickered on Sir Robert’s face.  “Does he, indeed?” he asked. “I wonder at his moderation. Had I been in his place I should have asked more, for really the style is a little  flamboyant. Well, we don’t want to quarrel with them just now—feed  the sharks. But surely, Jeffreys, you didn’t come to disturb me about  such a trifle?”  “Not altogether, Sir Robert. There is something more important. _The Daily Judge_ not only declines to put any article whatsoever, but refuses  our advertisement, and states that it means to criticize the prospectus  trenchantly.”  “Ah!” said his master after a moment’s thought, “that _is_ rather serious, since people believe in the _Judge_ even when it is wrong. Offer them the advertisement at treble rates.”  “It has been done, sir, and they still refuse.”  Sir Robert walked to the corner of the room where the yellow object squatted on  its pedestal, and contemplated it a while, as a man often studies one thing  when he is thinking of another. It seemed to give him an idea, for he looked  over his shoulder and said:  “That will do, Jeffreys. When Major Vernon comes in, give him my compliments and say that I should be obliged by a word or two with him.”  The clerk bowed and went as noiselessly as he had entered.  “Let’s see,” added Sir Robert to himself. “Old Jackson, the editor of _The Judge_, was a great friend of Vernon’s father, the late Sir William Vernon, G.C.B. I believe that he was engaged to be married  to his sister years ago, only she died or something. So the Major ought to be  able to get round him if anybody can. Only the worst of it is I don’t  altogether trust that young gentleman. It suited us to give him a share in the  business because he is an engineer who knows the country, and this Sahara  scheme was his notion, a very good one in a way, and for other reasons. Now he  shows signs of kicking over the traces, wants to know too much, is developing a  conscience, and so forth. As though the promoters of speculative companies had  any business with consciences. Ah! here he comes.”    Sir Robert seated himself at his desk and resumed his calculations upon a  half-sheet of note-paper, and that moment a clear, hearty voice was heard  speaking to the clerks in the outer office. Then came the sound of a strong,  firm footstep, the door opened and Major Alan Vernon appeared.    He was still quite a young man, not more than thirty-two or three years of age,  though he lacked the ultra robust and rubicund appearance which is typical of  so many Englishmen of his class at this period of life. A heavy bout of  blackwater fever acquired on service in West Africa, which would have killed  anyone of weaker constitution, had robbed his face of its bloom and left it  much sallower, if more interesting than once it had been. For in a way there  was interest about the face; also a certain charm. It was a good and honest  face with a rather eager, rather puzzled look, that of a man who has  imagination and ideas and who searches for the truth but fails to find it. As  for the charm, it lay for the most part in the pleasant, open smile and in the  frank but rather round brown eyes overhung by a somewhat massive forehead which  projected a little, or perhaps the severe illness already alluded to had caused  the rest of the face to sink. Though thin, the man was bigly built, with broad  shoulders and well-developed limbs, measuring a trifle under six feet in height.      Such was the outward appearance of Alan Vernon. As for his mind, it was able  enough in certain fashions, for instance those of engineering, and the  soldier-like faculties to which it had been trained; frank and kindly also, but  in other respects not quick, perhaps from its unsuspiciousness. Alan Vernon was  a man slow to discover ill and slower still to believe in it even when it  seemed to be discovered, a weakness that may have gone far to account for his  presence in the office of those eminent and brilliant financiers, Messrs.  Aylward & Champers-Haswell. Just now he looked a little worried, like a  fish out of water, or rather a fish which has begun to suspect the quality of  the water, something in its smell or taste.    “Jeffreys tells me that you want to see me, Sir Robert,” he said in his low and pleasant voice, looking at the baronet rather anxiously.  “Yes, my dear Vernon, I wish to ask you to do something, if you kindly will, although it is not quite in your line. Old Jackson, the editor of _The  Judge_, is a friend of yours, isn’t he?”  “He was a friend of my father’s, and I used to know him slightly.”  “Well, that’s near enough. As I daresay you have heard, he is an unreasonable old beggar, and has taken a dislike to our Sahara scheme. Someone  has set him against it and he refuses to receive advertisements, threatens  criticisms, etc. Now the opposition of _The Judge_ or any other paper  won’t kill us, and if necessary we can fight, but at the same time it is  always wise to agree with your enemy while he is in the way, and in  short—would you mind going down and explaining his mistake to him?”    Before answering Major Vernon walked to the window leisurely and looked out.    “I don’t like asking favours from family friends,” he replied at length, “and, as you said, I think it isn’t quite my line. Though of course if it has anything to do with the engineering possibilities, I  shall be most happy to see him,” he added, brightening.    “I don’t know what it has to do with; that is what I shall be obliged if you will find out,” answered Sir Robert with some asperity. “One can’t divide a matter of this sort into watertight compartments. It is true that in so important a concern each of us has charge  of his own division, but the fact remains that we are jointly and severally  responsible for the whole. I am not sure that you bear this sufficiently in  mind, my dear Vernon,” he added with slow emphasis.    His partner moved quickly; it might almost have been said that he shivered,  though whether the movement, or the shiver, was produced by the argument of  joint and several liability or by the familiarity of the “my dear  Vernon,” remains uncertain. Perhaps it was the latter, since although the  elder man was a baronet and the younger only a retired Major of Engineers, the  gulf between them, as any one of discernment could see, was wide. They were  born, lived, and moved in different spheres unbridged by any common element or  impulse.  “I think that I do bear it in mind, especially of late, Sir Robert,” answered Alan Vernon slowly.  His partner threw a searching glance on him, for he felt that there was meaning  in the words, but only said:  “That’s all right. My motor is outside and will take you to Fleet Street in no time. Meanwhile you might tell them to telephone that you are  coming, and perhaps you will just look in when you get back. I haven’t  got to go to the House to-night, so shall be here till dinner time, and so, I  think, will your cousin Haswell. Muzzle that old bulldog, Jackson, somehow. No  doubt he has his price like the rest of them, in meal or malt, and you  needn’t stick at the figure. We don’t want him hanging on our  throat for the next week or two.”  Ten minutes later the splendid, two-thousand guinea motor brougham drew up at  the offices of the _Judge_ and the obsequious motor-footman bowed Major  Vernon through its rather grimy doorway. Within, a small boy in a kind of box  asked his business, and when he heard his name, said that the  “Guvnor” had sent down word that he was go up at once—third floor, first to the right and second to the left. So up he went, and when he  reached the indicated locality was taken possession of by a worried-looking  clerk who had evidently been waiting for him, and almost thrust through a door  to find himself in a big, worn, untidy room. At a huge desk in this room sat an  elderly man, also big, worn, and untidy-looking, who waved a long slip of  galley-proof in his hand, and was engaged in scolding a sub-editor.    “Who is that?” he said, wheeling round. “I’m busy, can’t see anyone.”  “I beg your pardon,” answered the Major with humility, “your people told me to come up. My name is Alan Vernon.”  “Oh! I remember. Sit down for a moment, will you, and—Mr. Thomas, oblige me by taking away this rot and rewriting it entirely in the sense I have  outlined.”  Mr. Thomas snatched his rejected copy and vanished through another door, whereon his chief remarked in an audible voice:  “That man is a perfect fool. Lucky I thought to look at his stuff. Well, he is no worse than the rest, in this weary world,” and he burst into a hearty laugh and swung his chair round, adding, “Now then, Alan, what is it? I have a quarter of an hour at your service. Why, bless me! I was forgetting that it’s more than a dozen years since we met; you were still  a boy then, and now you have left the army with a D.S.O. and gratuity, and  turned financier, which I think wouldn’t have pleased your old father.  Come, sit down here and let us talk.”  “I didn’t leave the army, Mr. Jackson,” answered his visitor; “it left me; I was invalided out. They said I should never get my health back after that last go of fever, but I did.”  “Ah! bad luck, very bad luck, just at the beginning of what should have been a big career, for I know they thought highly of you at the War Office,  that is, if they can think. Well, you have grown into a fine-looking fellow,  like your father, very, and someone else too,” and he sighed, running his  fingers"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2857"],["title","A Yellow God: An Idol of Africa (#2)"],["body","his grizzled hair. “But you don’t remember her; she  was before your time. Now let us get to business; there’s no time for  reminiscences in this office. What is it, Alan, for like other people I suppose  that you want something?”  “It is about that Sahara flotation, Mr. Jackson,” he began rather doubtfully.  The old editor’s face darkened. “The Sahara flotation! That accursed——” and he ceased abruptly. “What have you, of all people in the world, got to do with it? Oh! I remember. Someone told me  that you had gone into partnership with Aylward the company promoter, and that  little beast, Champers-Haswell, who really is the clever one. Well, set it out,  set it out.”  “It seems, Mr. Jackson, that _The Judge_ has refused not only our article, but also the advertisement of the company. I don’t know much about this side of the affair myself, but Sir Robert asked me if I would come  round and see if things couldn’t be arranged.”  “You mean that the man sent you to try and work on me because he knew that I used to be intimate with your family. Well, it is a poor errand and will  have a poor end. You can’t—no one on earth can, while I sit in this  chair, not even my proprietors.”  There was silence broken at last by Alan, who remarked awkwardly:  “If that is so, I must not take up your time any longer.”  “I said that I would give you a quarter of an hour, and you have only been here four minutes. Now, Alan Vernon, tell me as your father’s old friend, why you have gone to herd with these gilded swine?”  There was something so earnest about the man’s question that it did not even occur to his visitor to resent its roughness.  “Of course it is not original,” he answered, “but I had this idea about flooding the Desert; I spent a furlough up there a few years ago and  employed my time in making some rough surveys. Then I was obliged to leave the  Service and went down to Yarleys after my father’s death—it’s  mine now, you know, but worth nothing except a shooting rent, which just pays  for the repairs. There I met Champers-Haswell, who lives near and is a kind of  distant cousin of mine—my mother was a Champers—and happened to  mention the thing to him. He took it up at once and introduced me to Aylward,  and the end of it was, that they offered me a partnership with a small share in  the business, because they said I was just the man they wanted.”    “Just the man they wanted,” repeated the editor after him. “Yes, the last of the Vernons, an engineer with an old name in his county, a clean record and plenty of ability. Yes, you would be just the man  they wanted. And you accepted?”  “Yes. I was on my beam ends with nothing to do; I wanted to make some money. You see Yarleys has been in the family for over five hundred years, and  it seemed hard to have to sell it. Also—also——” and he paused.  “Ever meet Barbara Champers?” asked Mr. Jackson inconsequently. “I did once. Wonderfully nice girl, and very good-looking too. But of course you know her, and she is her uncle’s ward, and their place isn’t far off Yarleys, you say. Must be a connection of yours also.”  Major Vernon started a little at the name and his face seemed to redden.  “Yes,” he said, “I have met her and she is a connection.”  “Will be a big heiress one day, I think,” went on Mr. Jackson, “unless old Haswell makes off with her money. I think Aylward knows that;  at any rate he was hanging about when I saw her.”  Vernon started again, this time very perceptibly.  “Very natural—your going into the business, I mean, under all the circumstances,” went on Mr. Jackson. “But now, if you will take my advice, you’ll go out of it as soon as you can.”  “Why?”  “Because, Alan Vernon, I am sure you don’t want to see your name dragged in the dirt, any more than I do.” He fumbled in a drawer and produced a typewritten document. “Take that,” he said, “and study it at your leisure. It’s a sketch of the financial career of Messrs. Aylward and Champers-Haswell, also of the companies which they have  promoted and been connected with, and what has happened to them and to those  who invested in them. A man got it out for me yesterday and I’m going to  use it. As regards this Sahara business, you think it all right, and so it may  be from an engineering point of view, but you will never live to sail upon that  sea which the British public is going to be asked to find so many millions to  make. Look here. We have only three minutes more, so I will come to the point  at once. It’s Turkish territory, isn’t it, and putting aside  everything else, the security for the whole thing is a Firman from the  Sultan?”  “Yes, Sir Robert Aylward and Haswell procured it in Constantinople. I have seen the document.”  “Indeed, and are you well acquainted with the Sultan’s signature? I know when they were there last autumn that potentate was very ill——”  “You mean——” said Major Vernon, looking up.  “I mean, Alan, that I like not the security. I won’t say any more, as there is a law of libel in this land. But _The Judge_ has certain sources of information. It may be that no protest will be made at once, for  baksheesh can stop it for a while, but sooner or later the protest or  repudiation will come, and perhaps some international bother; also much  scandal. As to the scheme itself, it is shamelessly over-capitalized for the  benefit of the promoters—of whom, remember, Alan, you will appear as one.  Now time’s up. Perhaps you will take my advice, and perhaps you  won’t, but there it is for what it’s worth as that of a man of the  world and an old friend of your family. As for your puff article and your  prospectus, I wouldn’t put them in _The Judge_ if you paid me a  thousand pounds, which I daresay your friend, Aylward, would be quite ready to  do. Good-bye. Come and see me again sometime, and tell me what has  happened—and, I say”—this last was shouted through the  closing door,—“give my kind regards to Miss Barbara, for wherever  she happens to live, she is an honest woman.”     CHAPTER II.  THE YELLOW GOD.   Alan Vernon walked thoughtfully down the lead-covered stairs, hustled by eager  gentlemen hurrying up to see the great editor, whose bell was already ringing  furiously, and was duly ushered by the obsequious assistant-chauffeur back into  the luxurious motor. There was an electric lamp in this motor, and by the light  of it, his mind being perplexed, he began to read the typewritten document  given to him by Mr. Jackson, which he still held in his hand.    As it chanced they were blocked for a quarter of an hour near the Mansion  House, so that he found time, if not to master it, at least to gather enough of  its contents to make him open his brown eyes very wide before the motor pulled  up at the granite doorway of his office. Alan descended from the machine, which  departed silently, and stood for a moment wondering what he should do. His  impulse was to jump into a bus and go straight to his rooms or his club, to  which Sir Robert did not belong, but being no coward, he dismissed it from his  mind.  His fate hung in the balance, of that he was well aware. Either he must disregard Mr. Jackson’s warning, confirmed as it was by many secret fears  and instincts of his own, and say nothing except that he had failed in his  mission, or he must take the bull by the horns and break with the firm. To do  the latter meant not only a good deal of moral courage, but practical ruin,  whereas if he chose the former course, probably within a fortnight he would  find himself a rich man. Whatever Jackson and a few others might say in its  depreciation, he was certain that the Sahara flotation would go through, for it  was underwritten, of course upon terms, by responsible people, moreover the  unissued preferred shares had already been dealt in at a heavy premium. Now to  say nothing of the allotment to which he was entitled upon his holding in the  parent Syndicate, the proportion of cash due to him as a partner, would amount  to quite a hundred thousand pounds. In other words, he, who had so many reasons  for desiring money, would be wealthy. After working so hard and undergoing so  much that he felt to be humiliating and even degrading, why should he not take  his reward and clear out afterwards?      This he remembered he could do, since probably by some oversight of Aylward’s, who left such matters to his lawyers, his deed of partnership did not bind him to a fixed term. It could be broken at any moment. To this  argument there was only one possible answer, that of his conscience. If once he  were convinced that things were not right, it would be dishonest to participate  in their profits. And he was convinced. Mr. Jackson’s arguments and his  damning document had thrown a flood of light upon many matters which he had  suspected but never quite understood. He was the partner of, well, adventurers,  and the money which he received would, in fact, be filched from the pockets of  unsuspecting persons. He would vouch for that of which he was doubtful and  receive the price of sharp practice. In other words he, Alan Vernon, who had  never uttered a wilful untruth or taken a halfpenny that was not his own, would  before the tribunal of his own mind, stand convicted as a liar and a thief. The  thing was not to be borne. At whatever cost it must be ended. If he were fated  to be a beggar, at least he would be an honest beggar.      With a firm step and a high head he walked straight into Sir Robert’s room, without even going through the formality of knocking, to find Mr. Champers-Haswell seated at the ebony desk by his partner’s side examining  some document through a reading-glass, which on his appearance, was folded over  and presently thrust away into a drawer. It seemed, Alan noticed, to be of an  unusual shape and written in some strange character.    Mr. Haswell, a stout, jovial-looking little man with a florid complexion and  white hair, rose at once to greet him.  “How do you do, Alan,” he said "]]]
