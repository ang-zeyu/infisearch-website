No part of it should be so planned as to produce an unscientific and dangerous strain.  The science of taxation consists in raising the largest obtainable amount of needed revenue in the most equitable manner, with the least economic disturbance and, as far as possible, with the effect of promoting thrift.  The House Bill proposes to raise from income, excess or war profit and inheritance taxes $5,686,000,000 out of an estimated total of $8,182,000,000. In other words, almost seventy per cent. of our stupendous total taxation is to come from these few sources. It seems to me that the effect and meaning of this is to penalize capital, to fine business success, as well as thrift and self-denial practised in the past, thereby tending to discourage saving.  The House Bill fails, on the other hand, to impose certain taxes the effect of which is to promote saving. Intentionally or not, yet effectively, it penalizes certain callings and sections of the country and favors others.  Let me say at the outset that my criticism does not refer to the principle of an eighty per cent. war profits tax. Indeed, I have from the very beginning advocated a high tax on war profits. To permit individuals and corporations to enrich themselves out of the dreadful calamity of war is repugnant to one's sense of justice and gravely detrimental to the war morale of the people.  Strictly from the economic point of view, the eighty per cent. war profits tax is not entirely free from objection. Whether England did wisely on the whole in fixing the tax at quite so high a rate is a debatable point, and is being questioned by some economists of high standing in that country, not from the point of view of tenderness for the beneficiaries from war profits, but from that of national advantage.  Moreover, conditions in America and England are not quite identical and I believe it to be a justifiable statement that British industry is better able to stand so high a tax than American industry, for reasons inherent in the respective business situations and methods.  However, everything considered, circumstances being what they are, I believe the enactment of the proposed eighty per cent. war profits tax to be expedient, provided that, like in England, the standard of comparison with pre-war profits is fairly fixed and due and fair allowance made, in determining taxable profits, for such bona fide items of depreciation and other write-offs as a reasonably conservative business man would ordinarily take into account before arriving at net profits.  Amongst the principles of correct and effective taxation, which are axiomatic, are these:       1. No tax should be so burdensome as to extinguish or seriously      jeopardize the source from which it derives its productivity. In      other words, do not be so eager to secure every possible golden      egg, that you kill the goose which lays them.       2. In war time, when the practice of thrift is of more vital      importance than ever to the nation, one of the most valuable      by-products which taxation should aim to secure is to compel      reduction in individual expenditures.       3. Taxation should be as widely diffused as possible, at however      small a rate the minimum contribution may be fixed, if only to give      the greatest possible number of citizens an interest to watch      governmental expenditure, and an incentive to curb governmental      extravagance.   It may safely be asserted that our war taxation runs counter to every one of these tested principles.     II   The characteristic difference between the House Bill and the revenue measures of Great Britain (I am not referring to those of France and Germany, because they are incomparably less drastic than ours or Great Britain's) is, first, that we do not resort to consumption taxes and only to a limited degree to general stamp taxes, and, secondly, that our income tax on small and moderate incomes is far smaller, on large incomes somewhat smaller and on the largest incomes a great deal heavier.  The House rate of taxation on incomes up to, say, $5,000, averages only one-fifth of what it is in England; the House rate of taxation on maximum incomes is approximately fifty per cent. higher than it is in England. Moreover, married men with incomes of less than $2,000 are entirely exempted from taxation in this country. In England all incomes from $650 on are subject to taxation.  I believe, on the whole, our system of gradation is juster than the English system, but I think we are going to an extreme at both ends. And it must be borne in mind that our actual taxation of high incomes is not even measured by the rates fixed in the House Bill, because to them must be added State and municipal taxes. There must further be added what to all intents and purposes is, though a voluntary act, yet in effect for all right-minded citizens tantamount to taxation, namely, a man's habitual expenditures for charity and his contributions to the Red Cross and other war relief works.  The sentimental and thereby the actual effect of extreme income taxation is not confined to the relatively small number of people in possession of very large incomes directly affected by it. The apprehension caused by the contemplation of an excessively high ratio of taxation is contagious and apt to react unfavorably on constructive activity.  It is highly important that taxation should not reach a point at which business would be crippled, cash resources unduly curtailed and the incentive to maximum effort and enterprise destroyed. And it should not be forgotten that both theoretically and actually the spending of money by the Government cannot and does not have the same effect on the prosperity of the country as productive use of his funds by the individual.  If all the European nations have stopped during the war at a certain maximum limit of individual income and inheritance taxation, even after four years of war, the reason is surely not that they love rich men more than we do or that they are all less democratic than we are. The reason is that these nations, including the financially wisest and most experienced, recognize the unwisdom and economic ill effect under existing conditions of going beyond that limit.     III   The same observations hold good in the case of our proposed inheritance taxation (maximum proposed here forty per cent., as against twenty per cent. maximum in England and much less in all other countries). And again there are to be added to Federal taxation the rates of state legacy and inheritance taxation.  Inheritance taxation, moreover, has that inevitable element of unfairness that it leaves entirely untouched the wastrel who never laid by a cent in his life, and penalizes him who practiced industry, self-denial and thrift. And it cannot be too often said that the encouragement of thrift and enterprise is of the utmost desirability under the circumstances in which the world finds itself, because it is only by the intensified creation of wealth through savings and production that the world can be re-established on an even keel after the ravages and the waste of the war.  Furthermore, business men, of necessity, have only a limited amount of their capital in liquid or quickly realizable form, and through the absorption by the inheritance tax of a large proportion of such assets, many a business may find itself with insufficient current capital to continue operations after the death of a partner. This effect is not only unfair in itself, but is made doubly so, as being a discrimination in favor of corporations as against private business men and business houses, inasmuch as corporations are, of course, not amenable to inheritance taxation.  Whilst in the case of the rich we discourage saving by the very hugeness of our taxation, or make it impossible, we fail to use the instrument of taxation to promote saving in the case of those with moderate incomes. And the enormous preponderance of saving which could and should be effected does not lie within the possibilities of the relatively small number of people with large means, but of the huge number of people with moderate incomes.  Moreover, while the rich, in consequence of taxation, limitation of profits, etc., have become less able to spend freely since our entrance into the war, workingmen and farmers, through increased wages, steadier employment and higher prices of crops, respectively, have become able to spend more freely.  Workingmen are in receipt of wages never approached in pre-war times, many of them making incomes a good deal higher than the average professional man, while the profits of business, generally speaking, are rather on a declining scale and certain branches of business have been brought virtually or even completely to a standstill.  Of our total national income, conservatively estimated at, say, $40,000,000,000 for the last year before our entrance into the war, i. e., the year 1916, it is safe to say that not more than $2,000,000,000 went to those with incomes of, say, $15,000 and above, whilst $38,000,000,000 went to those with lower incomes.  A carefully compiled statement issued by the Bankers Trust Company of New York estimates the total individual incomes of the nation for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1919, at about $53,000,000,000, and calculates that families with incomes of $15,000 or less receive $48,250,000 of that total; or, applying the calculation to families with incomes of $5,000 or less, it is found that they receive $46,000,000,000 of that total.     IV   Whilst the House Bill imposes luxury and semi-luxury taxes, it fails--as I have mentioned before--to resort to consumption taxes of a general kind--a deliberate but, in my opinion, unwarrantable omission.  My advocacy of consumption and similar taxes, such as stamp taxes of many kinds, is not actuated by any desire to relieve those with large incomes from the maximum of contribution which may wisely"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/29501"],["title","Negro Migration during the War (#1)"],["body","system of the South. It was hailed as the \"Exodus to the Promised Land\" and characterized by the same frenzy and excitement. Unlike the Kansas movement, it had no conspicuous leaders of the type of the renowned \"Pap\" Singleton and Henry Adams. Apparently they were not needed. The great horde of restless migrants swung loose from their acknowledged leaders. The very pervasiveness of the impulse to move at the first definite call of the North was sufficient to stir up and carry away thousands before the excitement subsided.  Despite the apparent suddenness of this movement, all evidence indicates that it is but the accentuation of a process which has been going on for more than fifty years. So silently indeed has this shifting of the negro population taken place that it has quite escaped popular attention. Following the decennial revelation of the census there is a momentary outburst of dismay and apprehension at the manifest trend in the interstate migration of negroes. Inquiries into the living standards of selected groups of negroes in large cities antedating the migration of 1916-1917 have revealed from year to year an increasing number of persons of southern birth whose length of residence has been surprisingly short. The rapid increase in the negro population of the cities of the North bears eloquent testimony to this tendency. The total increase in the negro population between 1900 and 1910 was 11.2 per cent. In the past fifty years the northern movement has transferred about 4 per cent of the entire negro population; and the movement has taken place in spite of the negro's economic handicap in the North. Within the same period Chicago increased her negro population 46.3 per cent and Columbus, Ohio, 55.3 per cent. This increase was wholly at the expense of the South, for the rural communities of the North are very sparsely populated with negroes and the increment accruing from surplus birth over deaths is almost negligible.[10]  When any attempt is made to estimate the volume of this most recent movement, however, there is introduced a confusing element, for it can not definitely be separated from a process which has been in operation since emancipation. Another difficulty in obtaining reliable estimates is the distribution of the colored population over the rural districts. It is next to impossible to estimate the numbers leaving the South even on the basis of the numbers leaving the cities. The cities are merely concentration points and they are continually recruiting from the surrounding rural districts. It might be stated that 2,000 negroes left a certain city. As a matter of fact, scarcely half that number were residents of the city. The others had moved in because it was easier to leave for the North from a large city, and there was a greater likelihood of securing free transportation or traveling with a party of friends. It is conservatively stated, for example, that Birmingham, Alabama, lost 38,000 negroes. Yet within a period of three months the negro population had assumed its usual proportions again.[11] Prior to the present migration of negroes, there was somewhat greater mobility on the part of the white than on the part of the negro population. As for example, according to  the census of 1910 of 68,070,294 native whites, 10,366,735 or 15.2 per cent were living in some other division than that in which they were born. Of 9,746,043 native negroes reported by the census of 1930, 963,153 or 9.9 per cent were living outside the division of birth.[12] Previous to the present migration, the south Atlantic and the east south central divisions were the only ones which had suffered a direct loss in population through the migration of negroes.[13]  The census of 1910 brought out the fact that there had been considerable migration from the North to the South, as well as from the South to the North, and from the East to the West. The number of persons born in the North and living in the South (1,449,229) was not very different from the number born in the South and living in the North (1,527,107). The North, however, has contributed more than five times as many to the population of the West as the South has. The number of negroes born in the South and living in the North in 1910 was 415,533, or a little over two-thirds of the total number living in the North. Of the 9,109,153 negroes born in the South, 440,534, or 4.8 per cent, were, in 1910, living outside the South.[14] The migration southward it will be noted, has been in recent years largely into the west south central division, while the migration northward has been more evenly distributed by divisions, except that a comparatively small number from the South have gone into the New England States.[15]  The greater mobility of whites than of negroes is shown by the fact that in 1910, 15 per cent of the whites and 10 per cent of the negroes lived outside of the States in which they were born. This greater mobility of the whites as compared with the negroes was due in a large measure to the lack of opportunities for large numbers of negroes to find employment in the sections outside the South. The World War changed these conditions and gave to the negroes of the United States the same opportunities for occupations in practically every section of the country, which had heretofore been enjoyed only by the whites. In 1900, 27,000 negroes born in the North lived in the South. In 1910, 41,000 negroes born in the North lived in the South. This indicated that there was beginning to be a considerable movement of negroes from the North to the South because of the greater opportunities in the South to find employment in teaching, medicine and business. The migration conditions brought about by the war have probably changed this to some extent. Previous to the World War, the States having the greatest gain from negro migration were Arkansas, 105,500, Pennsylvania, 85,000, Oklahoma, 85,000, Florida, 84,000, New York, 58,450 and Illinois, 57,500.  The point brought out here indicates that because of economic opportunities, Arkansas and Oklahoma, being contiguously situated in one section of the South and Florida in another section of the South, had received a greater migration of negroes than any State in the North.  Dr. William Oscar Scroggs of Louisiana calls attention to the tendency of negroes to move within the South, although, as, he points out, this tendency is not as great as it is for the whites. On this he says:      The negro shows a tendency, not only to move northward, but     also to move about very freely within the South. In fact, the     region registering the largest net gain of negroes in 1910     from this interstate movement was the west south central     division (Arkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma and Texas) which     showed a gain from this source of 194,658. The middle Atlantic     division came second with a gain of 186,384, and the east     north central third with a gain of 119,649. On the other hand,     the south Atlantic States showed a loss of 392,827, and the     east south central States a loss of 200,876 from interstate     migration. While the negroes have shown this marked     inclination toward interstate movement, they nevertheless     exhibit this tendency in less degree than do the whites.[16]   The subjoined tables show the intersectional migration of the negro population:  INTERSECTIONAL MIGRATION OF NEGROES  (As Reported by Census of 1910)   Number Born in Specified Divisions and Living In or Out of These Divisions    -------------------+---------------+---------------------+----------------                                        Number Living:        Per Cent Living                                      +---------------------+ Without                       Total Born in                          the Division       Division        the Division    Within     Without     in Which                                       Division   Division    Born   -------------------+---------------+----------+----------+----------------   United States       9,746,043       8,782,890   963,153       9.9   New England            37,799          30,815     6,984      18.5   Middle Atlantic       212,145         189,962    22,183      10.5   East North Central    173,226         145,187    28,039      16.2   West North Central    198,116         162,054    36,062      18.2   South Atlantic      4,487,313       4,039,173   448,140      10.0   East South Central  2,844,598       2,491,607   352,991      12.4   West South Central  1,777,242       1,713,888    63,354       3.6   Mountain                7,342           4,122     3,220      43.9   Pacific                 8,262           6,082     2,180      26.4   -------------------+---------------+----------+----------+----------------     Number Living in Specified Divisions    -------------------+---------------+------------+-------------+--------------                                       Number       Number        Per Cent                       Total Living    Born in and  Living in     Living in      Division         in the          Living in    the Division  Division                       Division        the Division Born in Other Born in Other                                                    Divisions     Divisions   -------------------+---------------+------------+-------------+--------------   United States       9,746,043       8,782,890     963,153        9.9   New England            58,109          30,815      27,294       47.0   Middle Atlantic       398,529         189,962     208,567       52.3   East North Central    292,875         145,187     147,688       50.4   West North Central    238,613         162,054      76,559       32.1   South Atlantic      4,094,486       4,039,173      55,313        1.4   East South Central  2,643,722       2,491,607     152,115        5.8   West South Central  1,971,900       1,713,888     258,012       13.1   Mountain               20,571          "]]]
