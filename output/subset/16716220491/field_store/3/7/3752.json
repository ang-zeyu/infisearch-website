I parted with Tirzah Ann and Whitfield, havin' shook hands with Ury before; and all others being parted from, I had to, yes, I had to, bid my beloved pardner adoo. And with a almost breakin' heart clum into the car, Miss Meechim and Dorothy and Aronette having preceeded me before hand. Yes, I left my own Josiah behind me, with his bandanna pressed to his eyes.  Could I leave him? At the last minute I leaned out of the car winder and sez with a choken voice:  \"Josiah, if we never meet again on Jonesville sile, remember there is a place where partin's and steam engines are no more.\"  His face wuz covered with his bandanna, from whence issued deep groans, and I felt I must be calm to boy him up, and I sez:  \"Be sure, Josiah, to keep your feet dry, take your cough medicine reglar, go to meetin' stiddy, keep the pumps from freezin', and may God bless you,\" sez I.  And then again I busted into tears. The hard-hearted engine snorted and puffed, and we wuz off.     CHAPTER II   As the snortin' and skornful actin' engine tore my body away from Jonesville, I sot nearly bathed in tears for some time till I wuz aware that little Tommy wuz weepin' also, frightened I spoze by his grandma's grief, and then I knew it wuz my duty to compose myself, and I summoned all my fortitude, put my handkerchief in my pocket, and give Tommy a cream cookey, which calmed his worst agony. I then recognized and passed the compliments of the day with Miss Meechim and Dorothy and pretty little Aronette, who wuz puttin' away our wraps and doin' all she could for the comfort of the hull of us. Seein' my agitation, she took Tommy in her arms and told him some stories, good ones, I guess, for they made Tommy stop cryin' and go to laughin', specially as she punctuated the stories with some chocolate drops.  Dorothy looked sweet as a rose and wuz as sweet. Miss Meechim come and sot down by me, but she seemed to me like a furiner; I wuz dwellin' in a fur off realm Miss Meechim had never stepped her foot in, the realm of Wedded Love and Pardner Reminiscences. What did Miss Meechim know of that hallowed clime? What did she know of the grief that wrung my heart? Men wuz to her like shadders; her heart spoke another language.  Thinkin' that it would mebbe git my mind off a little from my idol, I asked her again about Robert Strong's City of Justice; sez I, \"It has run in my mind considerable since you spoke on't; I don't think I ever hearn the name of any place I liked so well, City of Justice! Why the name fairly takes hold of my heart-strings,\" sez I; \"has he made well by his big manufactory?\"  \"Why, yes, fairly well,\" sez she, \"but he has strange ideas. He says he don't want to coin a big fortune out of other men's sweat and brains. He wants to march on with the great army of toilers, and not be carried ahead of it on a down bed. He says he wants to feel that he is wronging no man by amassing wealth out of the half-paid labor of their best years, and that he is satisfied with an equal and reasonable share of the labor and capital invested. He has the best of men in his employ and they are all well paid and industrious; all well-to-do, able to live well, educate their children well, and have time for some culture and recreation for themselves and their families. I told him that his ideas were Utopian, but he says they have succeeded even better than he expected they would. But there will come a crash some time, I am sure. There must be rich and there must be poor in this world, or the Scriptures will not be fulfilled.\"  Sez I, \"There ain't no need to be such a vast army of poverty marching on to the almshouse and grave, if it wuzn't for the dram-shop temptin' poor human nater, and the greed of the world, and the cowardice and indifference of the Church of Christ. Enough money is squandered for stuff that degrades and destroys to feed and clothe all the hungry and naked children of the world.\"  \"Oh,\" sez Miss Meechim, \"I don't believe all this talk and clamor about prohibition. My people all drank genteelly, and though of course it was drink that led to the agony and divorces of three of my sisters, and my father's first downfall, yet I have always considered that moderate drinking was genteel. Our family physician always drank genteel, and our clergyman always kept it in his wine cellar, and if people would only exert self control and drink genteel, there would be no danger.\"  \"How duz Robert Strong feel about it?\" sez I.  \"Oh, he is a fanatic on the subject; he won't employ a man who drinks at all. He says that the city he is founding is a City of Justice, and it is not just for one member of a family to do anything to endanger the safety and happiness of the rest; so on that ground alone he wouldn't brook any drinking in his model city. There are no very rich ones there, and absolutely no poor ones; he is completely obliterating the barriers that always have, and I believe always should exist between the rich and the poor. Sez I, 'Robert, you are sacrilegiously setting aside the Saviour's words, \"the poor ye shall always have with you.\"'  \"And he said there was another verse that our Lord incorporated in his teachings and the whole of his life-work, that he was trying to carry out: 'Do unto others as ye would have them to do unto you.' He said that love and justice was the foundation and cap-stone of our Saviour's life and work and he was trying in his weak way to carry them out in his own life and work. Robert talked well,\" sez she, \"and I must confess that to the outward eye his City of Justice is in a happy and flourishing condition, easy hours of work, happy faces of men, women and children as they work or play or study. It looks well, but as I always tell him, there is a weak spot in it somewhere.\"  \"What duz he say to that?\" sez I, dretful interested in the story.  \"Why, he says the only weak spot in it is his own incompetence and inability to carry out the Christ idea of love and justice as he wants to.\"  \"I wish I could see that City of Justice,\" sez I dreamily, for my mind's eye seemed to look up to Robert Strong in reverence and admiration. \"Well,\" sez she, \"I must say that it is a beautiful place; it is founded on a natural terrace that rises up from a broad, beautiful, green plain, flashing rivers run through the valley, and back of it rises the mountains.\"  \"Like as the mountains are about Jerusalem,\" sez I.  \"Yes, a beautiful clear stream rushes down the mountain side from the melting snow on top, but warmed by the southern sun, as it flows through the fertile land, it is warm and sweet as it reaches Robert's place. And Robert says,\" continued Miss Meechim, \"that that is just how old prejudices and injustices will melt like the cold snow and flow in a healing stream through the world. He talks well, Robert does. And oh, what a help he has been to me with Dorothy!\"  \"What duz she say about it?\" sez I.  \"She does not say so, but I believe she thinks as I do about the infeasibility as well as the intrinsic depravity of disproving the Scriptures.\"  \"Well,\" sez I, \"Robert was right about the mission of our Lord being to extend justice and mercy, and bring the heart of the world into sweetness, light and love. His whole life was love, self-sacrifice and devotion, and I believe that Robert is in the right on't.\"  \"Oh, Robert is undoubtedly following his ideas of right, but they clash with mine,\" sez Miss Meechim, shakin' her head sadly, \"and I think he will see his error in time.\"  Here Miss Meechim stopped abruptly to look apprehensively at a young man that I knew wuz a Jonesville husband and father of twins. He was lookin' admirin'ly at Dorothy, and Miss Meechim went and sot down between 'em, and Tommy come and set with me agin.  Tommy leaned up aginst me and looked out of the car window and sez kinder low to himself:  \"I wonner what makes the smoke roll and roll up so and feather out the sky, and I wonner what my papa and my mama is doin' and what my grandpa will do--they will be so lonesome?\" Oh, how his innocent words pierced my heart anew, and he begun to kinder whimper agin, and Aronette, good little creeter, come up and gin him an orange out of the lunch-basket she had.  Well, we got to New York that evenin' and I wuz glad to think that everybody wuz well there, or so as to git about, for they wuz all there at the deepo, excep' them that wuz in the street, but we got safe through the noise and confusion to a big, high tarven, with prices as high as its ruff and flagpole. Miss Meechim got for her and Dorothy what she called \"sweet rooms,\" three on 'em in a row, one for each on 'em and a little one for Aronette. But I d'no as they wuz any sweeter than mine, though mine cost less and wuz on the back of the house where it wuzn't so noisy. Tommy and I occupied one room; he had a little cot-bed made up for him.  Indeed, I groaned out as I sot me down in a big chair, if he wuz here, the pardner of my youth and middle age, no room Miss Meechim ever looked on wuz so sweet as this would be. But alas! he wuz fur away. Jonesville held on to my idol and we wuz parted away from each other. But I went down to supper, which they called dinner, and see that Tommy had things for his comfort and eat sunthin' myself, for I had to support life, yes, strength had to be got to cling to that black string that I had holt on, and vittles had to supply some of that strength, though religion and principle supplied the biggest heft. Miss Meechim and Aronette wuz in splendid sperits, and after sup--dinner went out to the theatre to see a noted tragedy acted, and they asked me to accompany and go with 'em, for I spoze that my looks wuz melancholy and deprested in extreme, Aronette offerin' to take care of Tommy if I wanted to go.  But I sez, \"No, I have got all the tragedy in my own bosom that I can 'tend to.\" And in spite of my cast-iron resolution tears "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30199"],["title","McIlvaine's Star (#1)"],["body","if from no distance at all.  \"Yes,\" he said hesitantly.  \"Well, then, listen to me, listen to Guru. We have now had enough information from you to suit our ends. Within twenty-four hours, we, the inhabitants of Ahli, will begin a war of extermination against Earth....\"  \"But, why?\" cried McIlvaine, astounded.  The image before his mind's eye cleared. The cold, precise features of Guru betrayed anger.  \"There is interference,\" the thought-image informed him. \"Leave the machine for a few moments, while we use the disintegrators.\"  Before he left the machine, McIlvaine had the impression of a greater machine being attached to the means of communication which the inhabitants of his star were using to communicate with him.         *       *       *       *       *  \"McIlvaine's story was that a few moments later there was a blinding flash just outside his window,\" continued Harrigan. \"There was also a run of instantaneous fire from the window to his machine. When he had collected his wits sufficiently, he ran outside to look. There was nothing there but a kind of grayish dust in a little mound--as if, as he put it, 'somebody had cleaned out a vacuum bag'. He went back in and examined the space from the window to the machine; there were two thin lines of dust there, hardly perceptible, just as if something had been attached to the machine and led outside.  \"Now the obvious supposition is naturally that it was Richardson out there, and that the lines of dust from the window to the machine represented the wires he had attached to his microphone while McIlvaine was at Bixby's entertaining his other two cronies, but this is fact, not fiction, and the point of the episode is that Richardson disappeared from that night on.\"  \"You investigated, of course?\" I asked.  Harrigan nodded. \"Quite a lot of us investigated. The police might have done better. There was a gang war on in Chicago just at that time, and Richardson was nobody with any connections. His nearest relatives weren't anxious about anything but what they might inherit; to tell the truth, his cronies at Bixby's were the only people who worried about him. McIlvaine as much as the rest of them.  \"Oh, they gave the old man a hard time, all right. They went through his house with a fine-toothed comb. They dug up his yard, his cellar, and generally put him through it, figuring he was a natural to hang a murder rap on. But there was just nothing to be found, and they couldn't manufacture evidence when there was nothing to show that McIlvaine ever knew that Richardson planned to have a little fun with him.  \"And no one had seen Richardson there. There was nothing but McIlvaine's word that he had heard what he said he heard. He needn't have volunteered that, but he did. After the police had finished with him, they wrote him off as a harmless nut. But the question of what happened to Richardson wasn't solved from that day to this.\"  \"People have been known to walk out of their lives,\" I said. \"And never come back.\"  \"Oh, sometimes they do. Richardson didn't. Besides, if he walked out of his life here, he did so without more than the clothing he had on. So much was missing from his effects, nothing more.\"  \"And McIlvaine?\"  Harrigan smiled thinly. \"He carried on. You couldn't expect him to do anything less. After all, he had worked most of his life trying to communicate with the worlds outside, and he had no intention of resigning his contact, no matter how much Richardson's disappearance upset him. For a while he believed that Guru had actually disintegrated Richardson; he offered that explanation, but by that time the dust had vanished, and he was laughed out of face. So he went back to the machine and Guru and the little excursions to Bixby's....\"         *       *       *       *       *  \"What's the latest word from that star of yours?\" asked Leopold, when McIlvaine came in.  \"They want to rejuvenate me,\" said McIlvaine, with a certain shy pleasure.  \"What's that?\" asked Alexander sourly.  \"They say they can make me young again. Like them up there. They never die. They just live so long, and then they rejuvenate, they begin all over. It's some kind of a process they have.\"  \"And I suppose they're planning to come down and fetch you up there and give you the works, is that it?\" asked Alexander.  \"Well, no,\" answered McIlvaine. \"Guru says there's no need for that--it can be done through the machine; they can work it like the disintegrators; it puts you back to thirty or twenty or wherever you like.\"  \"Well, I'd like to be twenty-five myself again,\" admitted Leopold.  \"I'll tell you what, Mac,\" said Alexander. \"You go ahead and try it; then come back and let us know how it works. If it does, we'll all sit in.\"  \"Better make your will first, though, just in case.\"  \"Oh, I did. This afternoon.\"  Leopold choked back a snicker. \"Don't take this thing too seriously, Mac. After all, we're short one of us now. We'd hate to lose you, too.\"  McIlvaine was touched. \"Oh, I wouldn't change,\" he hastened to assure his friends. \"I'd just be younger, that's all. They'll just work on me through the machine, and over-night I'll be rejuvenated.\"  \"That's certainly a little trick that's got it all over monkey glands,\" conceded Alexander, grinning.  \"Those little bugs on that star of yours have made scientific progress, I'd say,\" said Leopold.  \"They're not bugs,\" said McIlvaine with faint indignation. \"They're people, maybe not just like you and me, but they're people just the same.\"  He went home that night filled with anticipation. He had done just what he had promised himself he would do, arranging everything for his rejuvenation. Guru had been astonished to learn that people on Earth simply died when there was no necessity of doing so; he had made the offer to rejuvenate McIlvaine himself.  McIlvaine sat down to his machine and turned the complex knobs until he was en rapport with his dark star. He waited for a long time, it seemed, before he knew his contact had been closed. Guru came through.  \"Are you ready, McIlvaine?\" he asked soundlessly.  \"Yes. All ready,\" said McIlvaine, trembling with eagerness.  \"Don't be alarmed now. It will take several hours,\" said Guru.  \"I'm not alarmed,\" answered McIlvaine.  And indeed he was not; he was filled with an exhilaration akin to mysticism, and he sat waiting for what he was certain must be the experience above all others in his prosaic existence.         *       *       *       *       *  \"McIlvaine's disappearance coming so close on Richardson's gave us a beautiful story,\" said Harrigan. \"The only trouble was, it wasn't new when the _Globe_ got around to it. We had lost our informant in Richardson; it never occurred to Alexander or Leopold to telephone us or anyone about McIlvaine's unaccountable absence from Bixby's. Finally, Leopold went over to McIlvaine's house to find out whether the old fellow was sick.  \"A young fellow opened up.  \"'Where's McIlvaine?' Leopold asked.  \"'I'm McIlvaine,' the young fellow answered.  \"'Thaddeus McIlvaine,' Leopold explained.  \"'That's my name,' was the only answer he got.  \"'I mean the Thaddeus McIlvaine who used to play cards with us over at Bixby's,' said Leopold.  \"He shook his head. 'Sorry, you must be looking for someone else.'  \"'What're you doing here?' Leopold asked then.  \"'Why, I inherited what my uncle left,' said the young fellow.  \"And, sure enough, when Leopold talked to me and persuaded me to go around with him to McIlvaine's lawyer, we found that the old fellow had made a will and left everything to his nephew, a namesake. The stipulations were clear enough; among them was the express wish that if anything happened to him, the elder Thaddeus McIlvaine, of no matter what nature, but particularly something allowing a reasonable doubt of his death, the nephew was still to be permitted to take immediate possession of the property and effects.\"  \"Of course, you called on the nephew,\" I said.  Harrigan nodded. \"Sure. That was the indicated course, in any event. It was routine for both the press and the police. There was nothing suspicious about his story; it was straightforward enough, except for one or two little details. He never did give us any precise address; he just mentioned Detroit once. I called up a friend on one of the papers there and put him up to looking up Thaddeus McIlvaine; the only young man of that name he could find appeared to be the same man as the present inhabitant's uncle, though the description fit pretty well.\"  \"There was a resemblance, then?\"  \"Oh, sure. One could have imagined that old Thaddeus McIlvaine had looked somewhat like his nephew when he himself was a young man. But don't let the old man's rigmarole about rejuvenation make too deep an impression on you. The first thing the young fellow did was to get rid of that machine of his uncle's. Can you imagine his uncle having done something like that?\"         *       *       *       *       *  I shook my head, but I could not help thinking what an ironic thing it would have been if there had been something to McIlvaine's story, and in the process to which he had been subjected from out of space he had not been rejuvenated so much as just sent back in time, in which case he would have no memory of the machine nor of the use to which it had been put. It would have been as ironic for the inhabitants of McIlvaine's star, too; they would doubtless have looked forward to keeping this contact with Earth open and failed to realize that McIlvaine's construction differed appreciably from theirs.  \"He virtually junked it. Said he had no idea what it could be used for, and didn't know how to operate it.\"  \"And the telescope?\"  \"Oh, he kept that. He said he had some interest in astronomy and meant to develop that if time permitted.\"  \"So much ran in the family, then.\"  \"Yes. More than that. Old McIlvaine had a trick of seeming shy and self-conscious. So did this nephew of his. Wherever he came from, his origins must have "]]]
