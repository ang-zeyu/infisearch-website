I'll let the Scanner know we're ready to go into the Up-and-Out.\"     THE DEAL   Underhill spun the combination lock on the Lady May's cage. He woke her gently and took her into his arms. She humped her back luxuriously, stretched her claws, started to purr, thought better of it, and licked him on the wrist instead. He did not have the pin-set on, so their minds were closed to each other, but in the angle of her mustache and in the movement of her ears, he caught some sense of gratification she experienced in finding him as her Partner.  He talked to her in human speech, even though speech meant nothing to a cat when the pin-set was not on.  \"It's a damn shame, sending a sweet little thing like you whirling around in the coldness of nothing to hunt for Rats that are bigger and deadlier than all of us put together. You didn't ask for this kind of fight, did you?\"  For answer, she licked his hand, purred, tickled his cheek with her long fluffy tail, turned around and faced him, golden eyes shining.  For a moment, they stared at each other, man squatting, cat standing erect on her hind legs, front claws digging into his knee. Human eyes and cat eyes looked across an immensity which no words could meet, but which affection spanned in a single glance.  \"Time to get in,\" he said.  She walked docilely into her spheroid carrier. She climbed in. He saw to it that her miniature pin-set rested firmly and comfortably against the base of her brain. He made sure that her claws were padded so that she could not tear herself in the excitement of battle.  Softly he said to her, \"Ready?\"  For answer, she preened her back as much as her harness would permit and purred softly within the confines of the frame that held her.  He slapped down the lid and watched the sealant ooze around the seam. For a few hours, she was welded into her projectile until a workman with a short cutting arc would remove her after she had done her duty.         *       *       *       *       *  He picked up the entire projectile and slipped it into the ejection tube. He closed the door of the tube, spun the lock, seated himself in his chair, and put his own pin-set on.  Once again he flung the switch.  He sat in a small room, _small_, _small_, _warm_, _warm_, the bodies of the other three people moving close around him, the tangible lights in the ceiling bright and heavy against his closed eyelids.  As the pin-set warmed, the room fell away. The other people ceased to be people and became small glowing heaps of fire, embers, dark red fire, with the consciousness of life burning like old red coals in a country fireplace.  As the pin-set warmed a little more, he felt Earth just below him, felt the ship slipping away, felt the turning Moon as it swung on the far side of the world, felt the planets and the hot, clear goodness of the Sun which kept the Dragons so far from mankind's native ground.  Finally, he reached complete awareness.  He was telepathically alive to a range of millions of miles. He felt the dust which he had noticed earlier high above the ecliptic. With a thrill of warmth and tenderness, he felt the consciousness of the Lady May pouring over into his own. Her consciousness was as gentle and clear and yet sharp to the taste of his mind as if it were scented oil. It felt relaxing and reassuring. He could sense her welcome of him. It was scarcely a thought, just a raw emotion of greeting.  At last they were one again.  In a tiny remote corner of his mind, as tiny as the smallest toy he had ever seen in his childhood, he was still aware of the room and the ship, and of Father Moontree picking up a telephone and speaking to a Scanner captain in charge of the ship.  His telepathic mind caught the idea long before his ears could frame the words. The actual sound followed the idea the way that thunder on an ocean beach follows the lightning inward from far out over the seas.  \"The Fighting Room is ready. Clear to planoform, sir.\"     THE PLAY   Underhill was always a little exasperated the way that Lady May experienced things before he did.  He was braced for the quick vinegar thrill of planoforming, but he caught her report of it before his own nerves could register what happened.  Earth had fallen so far away that he groped for several milliseconds before he found the Sun in the upper rear right-hand corner of his telepathic mind.  That was a good jump, he thought. This way we'll get there in four or five skips.  A few hundred miles outside the ship, the Lady May thought back at him, \"O warm, O generous, O gigantic man! O brave, O friendly, O tender and huge Partner! O wonderful with you, with you so good, good, good, warm, warm, now to fight, now to go, good with you....\"  He knew that she was not thinking words, that his mind took the clear amiable babble of her cat intellect and translated it into images which his own thinking could record and understand.  Neither one of them was absorbed in the game of mutual greetings. He reached out far beyond her range of perception to see if there was anything near the ship. It was funny how it was possible to do two things at once. He could scan space with his pin-set mind and yet at the same time catch a vagrant thought of hers, a lovely, affectionate thought about a son who had had a golden face and a chest covered with soft, incredibly downy white fur.  While he was still searching, he caught the warning from her.  _We jump again!_  And so they had. The ship had moved to a second planoform. The stars were different. The Sun was immeasurably far behind. Even the nearest stars were barely in contact. This was good Dragon country, this open, nasty, hollow kind of space. He reached farther, faster, sensing and looking for danger, ready to fling the Lady May at danger wherever he found it.  Terror blazed up in his mind, so sharp, so clear, that it came through as a physical wrench.  The little girl named West had found something--something immense, long, black, sharp, greedy, horrific. She flung Captain Wow at it.  Underhill tried to keep his own mind clear. \"Watch out!\" he shouted telepathically at the others, trying to move the Lady May around.  At one corner of the battle, he felt the lustful rage of Captain Wow as the big Persian tomcat detonated lights while he approached the streak of dust which threatened the ship and the people within.  The lights scored near-misses.  The dust flattened itself, changing from the shape of a sting-ray into the shape of a spear.  Not three milliseconds had elapsed.         *       *       *       *       *  Father Moontree was talking human words and was saying in a voice that moved like cold molasses out of a heavy jar, \"C-A-P-T-A-I-N.\" Underhill knew that the sentence was going to be \"Captain, move fast!\"  The battle would be fought and finished before Father Moontree got through talking.  Now, fractions of a millisecond later, the Lady May was directly in line.  Here was where the skill and speed of the Partners came in. She could react faster than he. She could see the threat as an immense Rat coming direct at her.  She could fire the light-bombs with a discrimination which he might miss.  He was connected with her mind, but he could not follow it.  His consciousness absorbed the tearing wound inflicted by the alien enemy. It was like no wound on Earth--raw, crazy pain which started like a burn at his navel. He began to writhe in his chair.  Actually he had not yet had time to move a muscle when the Lady May struck back at their enemy.  Five evenly spaced photonuclear bombs blazed out across a hundred thousand miles.  The pain in his mind and body vanished.  [Illustration]  He felt a moment of fierce, terrible, feral elation running through the mind of the Lady May as she finished her kill. It was always disappointing to the cats to find out that their enemies whom they sensed as gigantic space Rats disappeared at the moment of destruction.  Then he felt her hurt, the pain and the fear that swept over both of them as the battle, quicker than the movement of an eyelid, had come and gone. In the same instant, there came the sharp and acid twinge of planoform.  Once more the ship went skip.  He could hear Woodley thinking at him. \"You don't have to bother much. This old son of a gun and I will take over for a while.\"  Twice again the twinge, the skip.  He had no idea where he was until the lights of the Caledonia space board shone below.  [Illustration]  With a weariness that lay almost beyond the limits of thought, he threw his mind back into rapport with the pin-set, fixing the Lady May's projectile gently and neatly in its launching tube.  She was half dead with fatigue, but he could feel the beat of her heart, could listen to her panting, and he grasped the grateful edge of a thanks reaching from her mind to his.     THE SCORE   They put him in the hospital at Caledonia.  The doctor was friendly but firm. \"You actually got touched by that Dragon. That's as close a shave as I've ever seen. It's all so quick that it'll be a long time before we know what happened scientifically, but I suppose you'd be ready for the insane asylum now if the contact had lasted several tenths of a millisecond longer. What kind of cat did you have out in front of you?\"  Underhill felt the words coming out of him slowly. Words were such a lot of trouble compared with the speed and the joy of thinking, fast and sharp and clear, mind to mind! But words were all that could reach ordinary people like this doctor.  His mouth moved heavily as he articulated words, \"Don't call our Partners cats. The right thing to call them is Partners. They fight for us in a team. You ought to know we call them Partners, not cats. How is mine?\"  \"I don't know,\" said the doctor contritely. \"We'll find out for you. Meanwhile, old man, you take it easy. There's nothing but rest that can help you. Can you make yourself sleep, or would you like us to give you some kind of"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/29618"],["title","The Aggravation of Elmer (#1)"],["body"," the hatbox. \"Just one quick look, Doreen,\" I said. \"No one will ever know.\"  She didn't answer. Just pulled the box away.  I pulled it back.  She pulled.  I pulled.  \"Bill--\" Marge called warningly. Too late. The lid of the hatbox came off in my hands.         *       *       *       *       *  There was a bright flash, the smell of insulation burning, and the unhappen genii fell out and scattered all over the floor.  Doreen looked smug. \"Now Elmer will be angry at you. Maybe he'll disintegrate you. Or paralalize you and statuefy you. Forever.\"  \"He might at that, Bill,\" Marge shuddered. \"I wouldn't put anything past him.\"  I wasn't listening. I was scrambling after the mess of tubes, condensers and power packs scattered over the rug. Some of them were still wired together, but most of them had broken loose. Elmer was certainly one heck of a sloppy workman. Hadn't even soldered the connections. Just twisted the wires together.  I looked at the stuff in my hands. It made as much sense as a radio run over by a truck.  \"We'll take it back to Elmer,\" I told Doreen, speaking very carefully. \"I'll give him lots of money to build another. He can come down here and use our shop. We have lots of nice equipment he'd like.\"  Doreen tossed her head. \"I don't think he'll wanta. He'll be mad at you. Anyway, Elmer is busy working on aggravation now.\"  \"That's for sure!\" Marge said in heartfelt tones.  \"Aggravation, eh?\" I grinned like an idiot. \"Well, well! I'll bet he's good at it. But let's go see him right away.\"  \"Bill!\" Marge signaled me to one side. \"Maybe you'd better not try to see Elmer,\" she whispered. \"I mean, if he can build a thing like this in his garage, maybe he _can_ build a disintegrator or a paralysis ray or something. There's no use taking chances.\"  \"You read too many comics,\" I laughed it off. \"He's only a kid, isn't he? What do you think he is? A superman?\"  \"Yes,\" Marge said flatly.  \"Look, Marge!\" I said in feverish excitement. \"I've got to talk to Elmer! I've got to get the rights to that TV color lens and this electricity interruptor and anything else he may have developed!\"  Marge kept trying to protest, but I simply grabbed her and Doreen and hustled them out to my car. Doreen lived in a wooded, hilly section a little north of White Plains. I made it in ten minutes.         *       *       *       *       *  Marge had said Elmer worked in the garage. I kept going up the driveway, swung sharp around the big house--and slammed on the brakes.  Marge screamed.  We skidded to a stop with our front end hanging over what looked like a bomb crater in the middle of the driveway.  I swallowed my heart down again, while I backed away fast.  We had almost plunged into a hole forty feet across and twenty feet deep in the middle. The hole was perfectly round, like a half section of a grapefruit.  \"What's this?\" I asked. \"Where's the garage?\"  \"That's where the garage should be.\" Marge looked dazed. \"But it's gone!\"  I took another look at that hole scooped out with geometrical precision, and turned to Doreen. \"What did you say Elmer was working on?\"  \"Agg--\" she sobbed, \"agg--agg--aggravation.\" She began to bawl in earnest. \"Now he's gone. He's mad. He won't ever come back, I betcha.\"  \"That's a fact,\" I muttered. \"He may not have been mad, but he certainly was aggravated. Marge, listen! This is a mystery. We've just got to let it stay a mystery. We don't know anything, understand? The cops will finally decide Elmer blew himself up, and we'll leave it at that. One thing I'm pretty sure about--he's not coming back.\"         *       *       *       *       *  So that's how it was. Tom Kennedy keeps trying and trying to put Elmer's unhappen genii back together again. And every time he fails he takes it out on me because I didn't get to Elmer sooner. But you can see perfectly well he's way off base, trying to make out I could have done a thing to prevent what happened.  Is it my fault if the dumb kid didn't know enough to take the proper precautions when he decided to develop anti-gravitation--and got shot off, garage and all, someplace into outer space?  What do they teach kids nowadays, anyway?                                                         --ROBERT ARTHUR     Transcriber's Note:      This etext was produced from _Galaxy Science Fiction_ May 1955.
