A ladder, naively placed on the outside,       was to serve as means of communication between the dressing-room       and the stage, and lend its rude rungs to entrances as well as to       exits. There was no personage, however unexpected, no sudden       change, no theatrical effect, which was not obliged to mount that       ladder. Innocent and venerable infancy of art and contrivances!        Four of the bailiff of the palace’s sergeants, perfunctory       guardians of all the pleasures of the people, on days of festival       as well as on days of execution, stood at the four corners of the       marble table.        The piece was only to begin with the twelfth stroke of the great       palace clock sounding midday. It was very late, no doubt, for a       theatrical representation, but they had been obliged to fix the       hour to suit the convenience of the ambassadors.        Now, this whole multitude had been waiting since morning. A       goodly number of curious, good people had been shivering since       daybreak before the grand staircase of the palace; some even       affirmed that they had passed the night across the threshold of       the great door, in order to make sure that they should be the       first to pass in. The crowd grew more dense every moment, and,       like water, which rises above its normal level, began to mount       along the walls, to swell around the pillars, to spread out on       the entablatures, on the cornices, on the window-sills, on all       the salient points of the architecture, on all the reliefs of the       sculpture. Hence, discomfort, impatience, weariness, the liberty       of a day of cynicism and folly, the quarrels which break forth       for all sorts of causes—a pointed elbow, an iron-shod shoe, the       fatigue of long waiting—had already, long before the hour       appointed for the arrival of the ambassadors, imparted a harsh       and bitter accent to the clamor of these people who were shut in,       fitted into each other, pressed, trampled upon, stifled. Nothing       was to be heard but imprecations on the Flemish, the provost of       the merchants, the Cardinal de Bourbon, the bailiff of the       courts, Madame Marguerite of Austria, the sergeants with their       rods, the cold, the heat, the bad weather, the Bishop of Paris,       the Pope of the Fools, the pillars, the statues, that closed       door, that open window; all to the vast amusement of a band of       scholars and lackeys scattered through the mass, who mingled with       all this discontent their teasing remarks, and their malicious       suggestions, and pricked the general bad temper with a pin, so to       speak.        Among the rest there was a group of those merry imps, who, after       smashing the glass in a window, had seated themselves hardily on       the entablature, and from that point despatched their gaze and       their railleries both within and without, upon the throng in the       hall, and the throng upon the Place. It was easy to see, from       their parodied gestures, their ringing laughter, the bantering       appeals which they exchanged with their comrades, from one end of       the hall to the other, that these young clerks did not share the       weariness and fatigue of the rest of the spectators, and that       they understood very well the art of extracting, for their own       private diversion from that which they had under their eyes, a       spectacle which made them await the other with patience.        “Upon my soul, so it’s you, ‘Joannes Frollo de Molendino!’” cried       one of them, to a sort of little, light-haired imp, with a       well-favored and malign countenance, clinging to the acanthus       leaves of a capital; “you are well named John of the Mill, for       your two arms and your two legs have the air of four wings       fluttering on the breeze. How long have you been here?”        “By the mercy of the devil,” retorted Joannes Frollo, “these four       hours and more; and I hope that they will be reckoned to my       credit in purgatory. I heard the eight singers of the King of       Sicily intone the first verse of seven o’clock mass in the       Sainte-Chapelle.”        “Fine singers!” replied the other, “with voices even more pointed       than their caps! Before founding a mass for Monsieur Saint John,       the king should have inquired whether Monsieur Saint John likes       Latin droned out in a Provençal accent.”        “He did it for the sake of employing those accursed singers of       the King of Sicily!” cried an old woman sharply from among the       crowd beneath the window. “I just put it to you! A thousand       _livres parisi_ for a mass! and out of the tax on sea fish in the       markets of Paris, to boot!”        “Peace, old crone,” said a tall, grave person, stopping up his       nose on the side towards the fishwife; “a mass had to be founded.       Would you wish the king to fall ill again?”        “Bravely spoken, Sire Gilles Lecornu, master furrier of king’s       robes!” cried the little student, clinging to the capital.        A shout of laughter from all the students greeted the unlucky       name of the poor furrier of the king’s robes.        “Lecornu! Gilles Lecornu!” said some.        “_Cornutus et hirsutus_, horned and hairy,” another went on.        “He! of course,” continued the small imp on the capital, “What       are they laughing at? An honorable man is Gilles Lecornu, brother       of Master Jehan Lecornu, provost of the king’s house, son of       Master Mahiet Lecornu, first porter of the Bois de Vincennes,—all       _bourgeois_ of Paris, all married, from father to son.”        The gayety redoubled. The big furrier, without uttering a word in       reply, tried to escape all the eyes riveted upon him from all       sides; but he perspired and panted in vain; like a wedge entering       the wood, his efforts served only to bury still more deeply in       the shoulders of his neighbors, his large, apoplectic face,       purple with spite and rage.        At length one of these, as fat, short, and venerable as himself,       came to his rescue.        “Abomination! scholars addressing a _bourgeois_ in that fashion       in my day would have been flogged with a fagot, which would have       afterwards been used to burn them.”        The whole band burst into laughter.        “Holà hé! who is scolding so? Who is that screech owl of evil       fortune?”        “Hold, I know him” said one of them; “’tis Master Andry Musnier.”        “Because he is one of the four sworn booksellers of the       university!” said the other.        “Everything goes by fours in that shop,” cried a third; “the four       nations, the four faculties, the four feasts, the four       procurators, the four electors, the four booksellers.”        “Well,” began Jean Frollo once more, “we must play the devil with       them.”[2]        “Musnier, we’ll burn your books.”        “Musnier, we’ll beat your lackeys.”        “Musnier, we’ll kiss your wife.”        “That fine, big Mademoiselle Oudarde.”        “Who is as fresh and as gay as though she were a widow.”        “Devil take you!” growled Master Andry Musnier.        “Master Andry,” pursued Jean Jehan, still clinging to his       capital, “hold your tongue, or I’ll drop on your head!”        Master Andry raised his eyes, seemed to measure in an instant the       height of the pillar, the weight of the scamp, mentally       multiplied that weight by the square of the velocity and remained       silent.        Jehan, master of the field of battle, pursued triumphantly:        “That’s what I’ll do, even if I am the brother of an archdeacon!”        “Fine gentry are our people of the university, not to have caused       our privileges to be respected on such a day as this! However,       there is a maypole and a bonfire in the town; a mystery, Pope of       the Fools, and Flemish ambassadors in the city; and, at the       university, nothing!”        “Nevertheless, the Place Maubert is sufficiently large!”       interposed one of the clerks established on the window-sill.        “Down with the rector, the electors, and the procurators!” cried       Joannes.        “We must have a bonfire this evening in the Champ-Gaillard,” went       on the other, “made of Master Andry’s books.”        “And the desks of the scribes!” added his neighbor.        “And the beadles’ wands!”        “And the spittoons of the deans!”        “And the cupboards of the procurators!”        “And the hutches of the electors!”        “And the stools of the rector!”        “Down with them!” put in little Jehan, as counterpoint; “down       with Master Andry, the beadles and the scribes; the theologians,       the doctors and the decretists; the procurators, the electors and       the rector!”        “The end of the world has come!” muttered Master Andry, stopping       up his ears.        “By the way, there’s the rector! see, he is passing through the       Place,” cried one of those in the window.        Each rivalled his neighbor in his haste to turn towards the       Place.        “Is it really our venerable rector, Master Thibaut?” demanded       Jehan Frollo du Moulin, who, as he was clinging to one of the       inner pillars, could not see what was going on outside.        “Yes, yes,” replied all the others, “it is really he, Master       Thibaut, the rector.”        It was, in fact, the rector and all the dignitaries of the       university, who were marching in procession in front of the       embassy, and at that moment traversing the Place. The students       crowded into the window, saluted them as they passed with       sarcasms and ironical applause. The rector, who was walking at       the head of his company, had"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26109"],["title","Hail to the Chief (#1)"],["body","anything. He knew that Spanding didn't want an answer yet.  \"The trouble with Fisher,\" Spanding went on, \"is that he ... well, he's too autocratic. He pulls decisions out of midair. He--\" Spanding paused, apparently searching for a way to express himself. Senator Cannon said nothing; he waited expectantly.  \"Take a look at the Bossard Decision,\" Spanding said. \"Fisher was Attorney General for his state at the time.  \"Bossard was the Mayor of Waynesville--twelve thousand and something population, I forget now. Fisher didn't even know Bossard. But when the big graft scandal came up there in Waynesville, Fisher wouldn't prosecute. He didn't actually refuse, but he hemmed and hawed around for five months before he really started the State's machinery to moving. By that time, Bossard had managed to get enough influence behind him so that he could beat the rap.  \"When the case came to trial in the State Supreme Court, Matt Fisher told the Court that it was apparent that Mayor Bossard was the victim of the local district attorney and the chief of police of Waynesville. In spite of the evidence against him, Bossard was acquitted.\" Spanding took a breath to say something more, but Senator James Cannon interrupted him.  \"Not 'acquitted', Harry. 'Exonerated'. Bossard never even should have come to trial,\" the senator said. \"He was a popular, buddy-buddy sort of guy who managed to get himself involved as an unwitting figurehead. Bossard simply wasn't--and isn't--very bright. But he was a friendly, outgoing, warm sort of man who was able to get elected through the auspices of the local city machine. Remember Jimmy Walker?\"  Spanding nodded. \"Yes, but--\"  \"Same thing,\" Cannon cut in. \"Bossard was innocent, as far as any criminal intent was concerned, but he was too easy on his so-called friends. He--\"  \"Oh, _crud_, Jim!\" the governor interrupted vehemently. \"That's the same whitewash that Matthew Fisher gave him! The evidence would have convicted Bossard if Fisher hadn't given him time to cover up!\"         *       *       *       *       *  Senator James Cannon suddenly became angry. He jammed his own cigarette butt into the ash tray, turned toward Spanding, and snapped: \"Harry, just for the sake of argument, let's suppose that Bossard wasn't actually guilty. Let's suppose that the Constitution of the United States is really true--that a man isn't guilty until he's proven guilty.  \"Just _suppose_\"--his voice and expression became suddenly acid--\"that Bossard was _not_ guilty. Try that, huh? Pretend, somewhere in your own little mind, that a mere accusation--no matter what the evidence--doesn't prove anything! Let's just make a little game between the two of us that the ideal of Equality Under the Law means what it says. Want to play?\"  \"Well, yes, but--\"  \"O.K.,\" Cannon went on angrily. \"O.K. Then let's suppose that Bossard really _was_ stupid. He could have been framed easily, couldn't he? He could have been set up as a patsy, couldn't he? _Couldn't he?_\"  \"Well, sure, but--\"  \"Sure! Then go on and suppose that the prosecuting attorney had sense enough to see that Bossard _had_ been framed. Suppose further that the prosecutor was enough of a human being to know that Bossard either had to be convicted or completely exonerated. What would he do?\"  Governor Spanding carefully put his cigarette into the nearest ash tray. \"If that were the case, I'd _completely_ exonerate him. I wouldn't leave it hanging. Matt Fisher didn't do anything but make sure that Bossard couldn't be legally convicted; he didn't prove that Bossard was innocent.\"  \"And what was the result, as far as Bossard was concerned?\" the senator asked.  Spanding looked around at the senator, staring Cannon straight in the face. \"The result was that Bossard was left hanging, Jim. If I go along with you and assume that Bossard was innocent, then Fisher fouled up just as badly as he would have if he'd fluffed the prosecution of a guilty man. Either a man is guilty, or he's innocent. If, according to your theory, the prosecutor knows he's innocent, then he should exonerate the innocent man! If not, he should do his best to convict!\"  \"He should?\" snapped Cannon. \"He _should_? Harry, you're letting your idealism run away with you! If Bossard were guilty, he should have been convicted--sure! But if he were innocent, should he be exonerated? Should he be allowed to run again for office? Should the people be allowed to think that he was lily-white? Should they be allowed to re-elect a nitwit who'd do the same thing again because he was too stupid to see that he was being used?  \"No!\" He didn't let the governor time to speak; he went on: \"Matthew Fisher set it up perfectly. He exonerated Bossard enough to allow the ex-mayor to continue in private life without any question. _But_--there remained just enough question to keep him out of public office for the rest of his life. Was that wrong, Harry? Was it?\"  Spanding looked blankly at the senator for a moment, then his expression slowly changed to one of grudging admiration. \"Well ... if you put it that way ... yeah. I mean, no; it wasn't wrong. It was the only way to play it.\" He dropped his cigarette into a nearby ash tray. \"O.K., Jim; you win. I'll back Fisher all the way.\"  \"Thanks, Harry,\" Cannon said. \"Now, if we--\"  Congressman Matson came back into the room, saying, \"I got 'em, Jim. Five or ten minutes, they'll be here. Which one of 'em is it going to be?\"  \"Matt Fisher, if we can come to an agreement,\" Cannon said, watching Matson's face closely.  Matson chewed at his cigar for a moment, then nodded. \"He'll do. Not much political personality, but, hell, he's only running for Veep. We can get him through.\" He took the cigar out of his mouth. \"How do you want to run it?\"  \"I'll talk to Fisher in my bedroom. You and Harry hold the others in here with the usual chitchat. Tell 'em I'm thinking over the choice of my running mate, but don't tell 'em I've made up my mind yet. If Matt Fisher doesn't want it, we can tell the others that Matt and I were simply talking over the possibilities. I don't want anyone to think he's second choice. Got it?\"  Matson nodded. \"Whatever you say, Jim.\"         *       *       *       *       *  That year, late August was a real blisterer along the eastern coast of the United States. The great megalopolis that sprawled from Boston to Baltimore in utter scorn of state boundaries sweltered in the kind of atmosphere that is usually only found in the pressing rooms of large tailor shops. Consolidated Edison, New York's Own Power Company, was churning out multimegawatts that served to air condition nearly every enclosed place on the island of Manhattan--which served only to make the open streets even hotter. The power plants in the Bronx, west Brooklyn, and east Queens were busily converting hydrogen into helium and energy, and the energy was being used to convert humid air at ninety-six Fahrenheit into dry air at seventy-one Fahrenheit. The subways were crowded with people who had no intention of going anywhere in particular; they just wanted to retreat from the hot streets to the air-conditioned bowels of the city.  But the heat that can be measured by thermometers was not the kind that was causing two groups of men in two hotels, only a few blocks apart on the East Side of New York's Midtown, to break out in sweat, both figurative and literal.  One group was ensconced in the Presidential Suite of the New Waldorf--the President and Vice President of the United States, both running for re-election, and other high members of the incumbent party.  The other group, consisting of Candidates Cannon and Fisher, and the high members of _their_ party, were occupying the only slightly less pretentious Bridal Suite of a hotel within easy walking distance of the Waldorf.  Senator James Cannon read through the news release that Horvin had handed him, then looked up at the PR man. \"This is right off the wire. How long before it's made public?\"  Horvin glanced at his watch. \"Less than half an hour. There's an NBC news program at five-thirty. Maybe before, if one of the radio stations think it's important enough for a bulletin break.\"  \"That means that it will have been common knowledge for four hours by the time we go on the air for the debate,\" said Cannon.  Horvin nodded, still looking at his watch. \"And even if some people miss the TV broadcast, they'll be able to read all about it. The deadline for the _Daily Register_ is at six; the papers will hit the streets at seven-fifteen, or thereabouts.\"  Cannon stood up from his chair. \"Get your men out on the streets. Get 'em into bars, where they can pick up reactions to this. I want as good a statistical sampling as you can get in so short a time. It'll have to be casual; I don't want your men asking questions as though they were regular pollsters; just find out what the general trend is.\"  [Illustration: ILLUSTRATED BY SCHOENHERR]  \"Right.\" Horvin got out fast.  The other men in the room were looking expectantly at the senator. He paused for a moment, glancing around at them, and then looked down at the paper and said: \"This is a bulletin from Tass News Agency, Moscow.\" Then he began reading.  \"Russian Luna Base One announced that at 1600 Greenwich Standard Time (12:00 N EDST) a presumed spacecraft of unknown design was damaged by Russian rockets and fell to the surface of Luna somewhere in the Mare Serenitas, some three hundred fifty miles from the Soviet base. The craft was hovering approximately four hundred miles above the surface when spotted by Soviet radar installations. Telescopic inspection showed that the craft was not--repeat: not--powered by rockets. Since it failed to respond to the standard United Nations recognition signals, rockets were fired to bring it down. In attempting to avoid the rockets, the craft, according to observers, maneuvered in an entirely unorthodox manner, which cannot be attributed to a rocket drive. A nearby burst,"]]]
