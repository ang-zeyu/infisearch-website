To be suddenly deprived of a large sum of money yearly and a show pupil, and to find herself with a little beggar on her hands, was more than she could bear with any degree of calmness.  \"Now listen to me,\" she went on, \"and remember what I say. If you work hard and prepare to make yourself useful in a few years, I shall let you stay here. You are only a child, but you are a sharp child, and you pick up things almost without being taught. You speak French very well, and in a year or so you can begin to help with the younger pupils. By the time you are fifteen you ought to be able to do that much at least.\"  \"I can speak French better than you, now,\" said Sara; \"I always spoke it with my papa in India.\" Which was not at all polite, but was painfully true; because Miss Minchin could not speak French at all, and, indeed, was not in the least a clever person. But she was a hard, grasping business woman; and, after the first shock of disappointment, had seen that at very little expense to herself she might prepare this clever, determined child to be very useful to her and save her the necessity of paying large salaries to teachers of languages.  \"Don't be impudent, or you will be punished,\" she said. \"You will have to improve your manners if you expect to earn your bread. You are not a parlor boarder now. Remember that if you don't please me, and I send you away, you have no home but the street. You can go now.\"  Sara turned away.  \"Stay,\" commanded Miss Minchin, \"don't you intend to thank me?\"  Sara turned toward her. The nervous twitch was to be seen again in her face, and she seemed to be trying to control it.  \"What for?\" she said.  \"For my kindness to you,\" replied Miss Minchin. \"For my kindness in giving you a home.\"  Sara went two or three steps nearer to her. Her thin little chest was heaving up and down, and she spoke in a strange, unchildish voice.  \"You are not kind,\" she said. \"You are not kind.\" And she turned again and went out of the room, leaving Miss Minchin staring after her strange, small figure in stony anger.  The child walked up the staircase, holding tightly to her doll; she meant to go to her bedroom, but at the door she was met by Miss Amelia.  \"You are not to go in there,\" she said. \"That is not your room now.\"  \"Where is my room?\" asked Sara.  \"You are to sleep in the attic next to the cook.\"  Sara walked on. She mounted two flights more, and reached the door of the attic room, opened it and went in, shutting it behind her. She stood against it and looked about her. The room was slanting-roofed and whitewashed; there was a rusty grate, an iron bedstead, and some odd articles of furniture, sent up from better rooms below, where they had been used until they were considered to be worn out. Under the skylight in the roof, which showed nothing but an oblong piece of dull gray sky, there was a battered old red footstool.  Sara went to it and sat down. She was a queer child, as I have said before, and quite unlike other children. She seldom cried. She did not cry now. She laid her doll, Emily, across her knees, and put her face down upon her, and her arms around her, and sat there, her little black head resting on the black crape, not saying one word, not making one sound.                    *       *       *       *       *  From that day her life changed entirely. Sometimes she used to feel as if it must be another life altogether, the life of some other child. She was a little drudge and outcast; she was given her lessons at odd times and expected to learn without being taught; she was sent on errands by Miss Minchin, Miss Amelia and the cook. Nobody took any notice of her except when they ordered her about. She was often kept busy all day and then sent into the deserted school-room with a pile of books to learn her lessons or practise at night. She had never been intimate with the other pupils, and soon she became so shabby that, taking her queer clothes together with her queer little ways, they began to look upon her as a being of another world than their own. The fact was that, as a rule, Miss Minchin's pupils were rather dull, matter-of-fact young people, accustomed to being rich and comfortable; and Sara, with her elfish cleverness, her desolate life, and her odd habit of fixing her eyes upon them and staring them out of countenance, was too much for them.  \"She always looks as if she was finding you out,\" said one girl, who was sly and given to making mischief. \"I am,\" said Sara promptly, when she heard of it. \"That's what I look at them for. I like to know about people. I think them over afterward.\"  She never made any mischief herself or interfered with any one. She talked very little, did as she was told, and thought a great deal. Nobody knew, and in fact nobody cared, whether she was unhappy or happy, unless, perhaps, it was Emily, who lived in the attic and slept on the iron bedstead at night. Sara thought Emily understood her feelings, though she was only wax and had a habit of staring herself. Sara used to talk to her at night.  \"You are the only friend I have in the world,\" she would say to her. \"Why don't you say something? Why don't you speak? Sometimes I am sure you could, if you would try. It ought to make you try, to know you are the only thing I have. If I were you, I should try. Why don't you try?\"  It really was a very strange feeling she had about Emily. It arose from her being so desolate. She did not like to own to herself that her only friend, her only companion, could feel and hear nothing. She wanted to believe, or to pretend to believe, that Emily understood and sympathized with her, that she heard her even though she did not speak in answer. She used to put her in a chair sometimes and sit opposite to her on the old red footstool, and stare at her and think and pretend about her until her own eyes would grow large with something which was almost like fear, particularly at night, when the garret was so still, when the only sound that was to be heard was the occasional squeak and scurry of rats in the wainscot. There were rat-holes in the garret, and Sara detested rats, and was always glad Emily was with her when she heard their hateful squeak and rush and scratching. One of her \"pretends\" was that Emily was a kind of good witch and could protect her. Poor little Sara! everything was \"pretend\" with her. She had a strong imagination; there was almost more imagination than there was Sara, and her whole forlorn, uncared-for child-life was made up of imaginings. She imagined and pretended things until she almost believed them, and she would scarcely have been surprised at any remarkable thing that could have happened. So she insisted to herself that Emily understood all about her troubles and was really her friend.  \"As to answering,\" she used to say, \"I don't answer very often. I never answer when I can help it. When people are insulting you, there is nothing so good for them as not to say a word--just to look at them and _think_. Miss Minchin turns pale with rage when I do it. Miss Amelia looks frightened, so do the girls. They know you are stronger than they are, because you are strong enough to hold in your rage and they are not, and they say stupid things they wish they hadn't said afterward. There's nothing so strong as rage, except what makes you hold it in--that's stronger. It's a good thing not to answer your enemies. I scarcely ever do. Perhaps Emily is more like me than I am like myself. Perhaps she would rather not answer her friends, even. She keeps it all in her heart.\"  But though she tried to satisfy herself with these arguments, Sara did not find it easy. When, after a long, hard day, in which she had been sent here and there, sometimes on long errands, through wind and cold and rain; and, when she came in wet and hungry, had been sent out again because nobody chose to remember that she was only a child, and that her thin little legs might be tired, and her small body, clad in its forlorn, too small finery, all too short and too tight, might be chilled; when she had been given only harsh words and cold, slighting looks for thanks; when the cook had been vulgar and insolent; when Miss Minchin had been in her worst moods, and when she had seen the girls sneering at her among themselves and making fun of her poor, outgrown clothes--then Sara did not find Emily quite all that her sore, proud, desolate little heart needed as the doll sat in her little old chair and stared.  One of these nights, when she came up to the garret cold, hungry, tired, and with a tempest raging in her small breast, Emily's stare seemed so vacant, her sawdust legs and arms so limp and inexpressive, that Sara lost all control over herself.  \"I shall die presently!\" she said at first.  Emily stared.  \"I can't bear this!\" said the poor child, trembling. \"I know I shall die. I'm cold, I'm wet, I'm starving to death. I've walked a thousand miles to-day, and they have done nothing but scold me from morning until night. And because I could not find that last thing they sent me for, they would not give me any supper. Some men laughed at me because my old shoes made me slip down in the mud. I'm covered with mud now. And they laughed! Do you _hear_!\"  She looked at the staring glass eyes and complacent wax face, and suddenly a sort of heart-broken rage seized her. She lifted her little savage hand and knocked Emily off the chair, bursting into a passion of sobbing.  \"You are nothing but a doll!\" she cried. \"Nothing but a doll--doll--doll! You care for nothing. You are stuffed with sawdust. You never had a heart. Nothing could ever make you feel. You are a _doll_!\"  Emily lay upon the floor, with her legs ignominiously doubled up over her head, and a new flat place on the end of her nose; but she was still calm, even dignified.  Sara hid her face on her arms and"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24772"],["title","Sara Crewe; Or, What Happened at Miss Minchin's (#2)"],["body","ed. Some rats in the wall began to fight and bite each other, and squeak and scramble. But, as I have already intimated, Sara was not in the habit of crying. After a while she stopped, and when she stopped she looked at Emily, who seemed to be gazing at her around the side of one ankle, and actually with a kind of glassy-eyed sympathy. Sara bent and picked her up. Remorse overtook her.  \"You can't help being a doll,\" she said, with a resigned sigh, \"any more than those girls downstairs can help not having any sense. We are not all alike. Perhaps you do your sawdust best.\"  None of Miss Minchin's young ladies were very remarkable for being brilliant; they were select, but some of them were very dull, and some of them were fond of applying themselves to their lessons. Sara, who snatched her lessons at all sorts of untimely hours from tattered and discarded books, and who had a hungry craving for everything readable, was often severe upon them in her small mind. They had books they never read; she had no books at all. If she had always had something to read, she would not have been so lonely. She liked romances and history and poetry; she would read anything. There was a sentimental housemaid in the establishment who bought the weekly penny papers, and subscribed to a circulating library, from which she got greasy volumes containing stories of marquises and dukes who invariably fell in love with orange-girls and gypsies and servant-maids, and made them the proud brides of coronets; and Sara often did parts of this maid's work so that she might earn the privilege of reading these romantic histories. There was also a fat, dull pupil, whose name was Ermengarde St. John, who was one of her resources. Ermengarde had an intellectual father who, in his despairing desire to encourage his daughter, constantly sent her valuable and interesting books, which were a continual source of grief to her. Sara had once actually found her crying over a big package of them.  \"What is the matter with you?\" she asked her, perhaps rather disdainfully.  And it is just possible she would not have spoken to her, if she had not seen the books. The sight of books always gave Sara a hungry feeling, and she could not help drawing near to them if only to read their titles.  \"What is the matter with you?\" she asked.  \"My papa has sent me some more books,\" answered Ermengarde woefully, \"and he expects me to read them.\"  \"Don't you like reading?\" said Sara.  \"I hate it!\" replied Miss Ermengarde St. John. \"And he will ask me questions when he sees me: he will want to know how much I remember; how would _you_ like to have to read all those?\"  \"I'd like it better than anything else in the world,\" said Sara.  Ermengarde wiped her eyes to look at such a prodigy.  \"Oh, gracious!\" she exclaimed.  Sara returned the look with interest. A sudden plan formed itself in her sharp mind.  \"Look here!\" she said. \"If you'll lend me those books, I'll read them and tell you everything that's in them afterward, and I'll tell it to you so that you will remember it. I know I can. The A B C children always remember what I tell them.\"  \"Oh, goodness!\" said Ermengarde. \"Do you think you could?\"  \"I know I could,\" answered Sara. \"I like to read, and I always remember. I'll take care of the books, too; they will look just as new as they do now, when I give them back to you.\"  Ermengarde put her handkerchief in her pocket.  \"If you'll do that,\" she said, \"and if you'll make me remember, I'll give you--I'll give you some money.\"  \"I don't want your money,\" said Sara. \"I want your books--I want them.\" And her eyes grew big and queer, and her chest heaved once.  \"Take them, then,\" said Ermengarde; \"I wish I wanted them, but I am not clever, and my father is, and he thinks I ought to be.\"  Sara picked up the books and marched off with them. But when she was at the door, she stopped and turned around.  \"What are you going to tell your father?\" she asked.  \"Oh,\" said Ermengarde, \"he needn't know; he'll think I've read them.\"  Sara looked down at the books; her heart really began to beat fast.  \"I won't do it,\" she said rather slowly, \"if you are going to tell him lies about it--I don't like lies. Why can't you tell him I read them and then told you about them?\"  \"But he wants me to read them,\" said Ermengarde.  \"He wants you to know what is in them,\" said Sara; \"and if I can tell it to you in an easy way and make you remember, I should think he would like that.\"  \"He would like it better if I read them myself,\" replied Ermengarde.  \"He will like it, I dare say, if you learn anything in any way,\" said Sara. \"I should, if I were your father.\"  And though this was not a flattering way of stating the case, Ermengarde was obliged to admit it was true, and, after a little more argument, gave in. And so she used afterward always to hand over her books to Sara, and Sara would carry them to her garret and devour them; and after she had read each volume, she would return it and tell Ermengarde about it in a way of her own. She had a gift for making things interesting. Her imagination helped her to make everything rather like a story, and she managed this matter so well that Miss St. John gained more information from her books than she would have gained if she had read them three times over by her poor stupid little self. When Sara sat down by her and began to tell some story of travel or history, she made the travellers and historical people seem real; and Ermengarde used to sit and regard her dramatic gesticulations, her thin little flushed cheeks, and her shining, odd eyes with amazement.  \"It sounds nicer than it seems in the book,\" she would say. \"I never cared about Mary, Queen of Scots, before, and I always hated the French Revolution, but you make it seem like a story.\"  \"It is a story,\" Sara would answer. \"They are all stories. Everything is a story--everything in this world. You are a story--I am a story--Miss Minchin is a story. You can make a story out of anything.\"  \"I can't,\" said Ermengarde.  Sara stared at her a minute reflectively.  \"No,\" she said at last. \"I suppose you couldn't. You are a little like Emily.\"  \"Who is Emily?\"  Sara recollected herself. She knew she was sometimes rather impolite in the candor of her remarks, and she did not want to be impolite to a girl who was not unkind--only stupid. Notwithstanding all her sharp little ways she had the sense to wish to be just to everybody. In the hours she spent alone, she used to argue out a great many curious questions with herself. One thing she had decided upon was, that a person who was clever ought to be clever enough not to be unjust or deliberately unkind to any one. Miss Minchin was unjust and cruel, Miss Amelia was unkind and spiteful, the cook was malicious and hasty-tempered--they all were stupid, and made her despise them, and she desired to be as unlike them as possible. So she would be as polite as she could to people who in the least deserved politeness.  \"Emily is--a person--I know,\" she replied.  \"Do you like her?\" asked Ermengarde.  \"Yes, I do,\" said Sara.  Ermengarde examined her queer little face and figure again. She did look odd. She had on, that day, a faded blue plush skirt, which barely covered her knees, a brown cloth sacque, and a pair of olive-green stockings which Miss Minchin had made her piece out with black ones, so that they would be long enough to be kept on. And yet Ermengarde was beginning slowly to admire her. Such a forlorn, thin, neglected little thing as that, who could read and read and remember and tell you things so that they did not tire you all out! A child who could speak French, and who had learned German, no one knew how! One could not help staring at her and feeling interested, particularly one to whom the simplest lesson was a trouble and a woe.  \"Do you like _me_?\" said Ermengarde, finally, at the end of her scrutiny.  Sara hesitated one second, then she answered:  \"I like you because you are not ill-natured--I like you for letting me read your books--I like you because you don't make spiteful fun of me for what I can't help. It's not your fault that----\"  She pulled herself up quickly. She had been going to say, \"that you are stupid.\"  \"That what?\" asked Ermengarde.  \"That you can't learn things quickly. If you can't, you can't. If I can, why, I can--that's all.\" She paused a minute, looking at the plump face before her, and then, rather slowly, one of her wise, old-fashioned thoughts came to her.  \"Perhaps,\" she said, \"to be able to learn things quickly isn't everything. To be kind is worth a good deal to other people. If Miss Minchin knew everything on earth, which she doesn't, and if she was like what she is now, she'd still be a detestable thing, and everybody would hate her. Lots of clever people have done harm and been wicked. Look at Robespierre----\"  She stopped again and examined her companion's countenance.  \"Do you remember about him?\" she demanded. \"I believe you've forgotten.\"  \"Well, I don't remember _all_ of it,\" admitted Ermengarde.  \"Well,\" said Sara, with courage and determination, \"I'll tell it to you over again.\"  And she plunged once more into the gory records of the French Revolution, and told such stories of it, and made such vivid pictures of its horrors, that Miss St. John was afraid to go to bed afterward, and hid her head under the blankets when she did go, and shivered until she fell asleep. But afterward she preserved lively recollections of the character of Robespierre, and did not even forget Marie Antoinette and the Princess de Lamballe.  \"You know they put her head on a pike and danced around it,\" Sara had said; \"and she had beautiful blonde hair; and when I think of her, I never see her head on her body, but always on a pike, with those furious people dancing and howling.\"  Yes, it was true; to this imaginative child everything was a story; and the more books she read, the more imaginative she became.
