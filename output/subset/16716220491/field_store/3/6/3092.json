No longer were the various states pink, green, or purple splotches on the map; they were real living places with people, sunshine, and fresh air.  \"I had no idea America was so big!\" he gasped to his father.  \"It's the finest country in the world, Don! Be proud and thankful that you are an American. No other land does so much for her people. Be humble, too. Never let a chance go by to do your part in helping the country that does so much for you.\"  They were standing in the glassed-in rear of the train, and as Mr. Clark spoke he pointed to vast tracts of forest land that sped past them.  \"I am afraid I can't do anything for a great country like this, father,\" said Donald, a little quiver in his voice.  \"There is one thing we can all do--that is be good citizens. Every law we have was made for the good of our people. In so far as you keep these laws you will be aiding in building up a more perfect America. Bear your share in that work--do not be a hindrance, Don.\"  \"I'll try, father,\" was the boy's grave reply.  To help in the progress of such a land as this! More than once Donald thought of his father's words as the train threaded its way along the banks of mighty rivers, rolled through great woodlands, or skirted cities which throbbed with the life of mighty industries.  And all this vast-reaching land was his country--his!  On every hand there were wonders!  As the express thundered along he poured out question after question.  Why did people go way to Idaho to raise sheep? Why didn't his father raise his sheep in the East? Certainly there was room enough, plenty of room, that was much nearer than Idaho. How did sheep get into the mountains of Idaho anyway?  Mr. Clark ducked his head under the torrent of queries.  \"You will drown me with questions!\" he exclaimed laughing. \"Well, I shall do my best to answer you. New Mexico was the first sheep center in our country. Herds were originally brought from Spain, and these flocks worked their way up from Mexico through New Mexico and California; here the hills supplied the coolness necessary to animals with such thick coats, and furnished them at the same time with plentiful grass for food. During the day the herds grazed, and at night they were driven into corrals of cedar built by the shepherds. These sheep were mostly Merinos, a variety raised in Spain. Afterward, in 1853, a man named William W. Hollister brought three hundred ewes across our continent to the West. Think what a journey it must have been!\"  \"Wasn't the railroad built?\"  \"No. Neither were there any bridges. There were rivers to swim and mountains to climb; furthermore there was many a search for water-holes, because Mr. Hollister was not well enough acquainted with the country to know where to find water for himself and the herd.\"  \"I should not think a sheep would have lived through such a journey!\" cried Donald.  \"Many of them did, however,\" answered his father, \"and that is how our western sheep-raising industry began. Now it is one of the great occupations of our land, and soon you and I are to know more about it.\"  \"And about Sandy McCulloch, too, I hope,\" put in the boy.  \"I hope so; only remember--not a word of that telegram to any one at the ranch. We shall get into Glen City this noon if our train is on time and we must trust to luck in getting to Crescent Ranch. It is fifteen miles from the station, up in the foot-hills of the Rockies.\"  \"The--the--you don't mean the Rocky Mountains!\" gasped Donald, his eyes very wide open.  \"Certainly. Have you forgotten your geography?\"  \"Of course I know that a spur of the Rocky Mountains does run diagonally across Idaho; but somehow I never thought of really being in the Rocky Mountains!\"  Mr. Clark enjoyed the outburst.  \"To be where there are bears and bob-cats and----\"  \"Maybe, after all, you would rather have stayed at home and finished out your school year.\"  \"I rather guess not!\" was the lad's emphatic reply.  So impatient was he to see the marvels of this magic land that the last few hours of the journey seemed unending.  But they did end.  Toward noon the heavy train pulled into Glen City and they bundled out on to the platform. They were the only passengers, but there was a great deal of freight--boxes, barrels, and cases of provisions. As they stood hesitating as to what they had better do a tall, bony young fellow approached the station agent and called with a decided suggestion of the Highlander in his accent:  \"I dinna see those kegs of lime for Crescent Ranch, Mitchell.\"  \"They're here. You will find them at the end of the platform. Come, and I'll help you pile them on your wagon.\"  Mr. Clark turned to the Scotchman.  \"Are you going to Crescent Ranch?\"  \"Aye, I be, sir.\"  \"Can you take my son and me along?\"  The Scotchman studied him carefully.  \"Have you business at the ranch?\" he asked, looking keenly into the eyes of the speaker.  Mr. Clark met his gaze good-naturedly.  \"We might possibly have,\" he answered. \"At any rate we want to go up there. My name is Clark and I come from Boston.\"  \"Clark, did you say, sir?\"  \"Yes.\"  The stolid stare of the Scotchman did not waver.  \"Mayhap you're the owner, sir.\"  \"Yes, I am.\"  A gleam of something very like satisfaction passed over the tanned features of the young man. Then his face settled back into its wonted calmness.  \"It's welcome you are, sir,\" he said heartily. \"I dinna think there'll be trouble about taking you and your son to Crescent.\"  He wheeled and led the way to a wagon, where he piled up some sacks of grain for his guests to sit upon. Then he lifted in their luggage and the freight for which he had come, and gathered the lines over the backs of his horses.  As the wagon toiled up the long, low hills Mr. Clark began asking questions about the ranch--he asked many questions concerning the country and the flocks. To all of these he received terse answers.  Presently the Scotchman turned.  \"It's little you be knowin' of sheepin', sir.\"  The remark was made with so much simplicity that it could not have been mistaken for rudeness.  \"Very little.\"  \"Keep it to yourself, man,\" was the laconic advice the Highlander tossed over his shoulder as he transferred his attention to his horses.  Mr. Clark bit his lip to hide a smile.  \"What is your name, my lad?\" he asked suddenly.  \"Sandy McCulloch, sir,\" was the quiet answer.  Donald waited, listening eagerly to every turn of the conversation that followed, but to his astonishment neither his father nor Sandy McCulloch spoke one word regarding the mysterious telegram.  It was nightfall when the wagon that had brought them turned into a muddy drive and stopped before a bare looking house situated in a meadow, and surrounded by a number of vast barns and sheep-pens. Out of this house came a broad-shouldered, bronzed man who stood on the steps, waiting their approach. He wore trousers of sheepskin, a soiled flannel shirt, and round his neck--knotted in the back--was a red handkerchief. Donald noticed that into his belt of Mexican leather was tucked a revolver. He stared at the strangers inquiringly.  Mr. Clark jumped out as soon as the wagon stopped, and extended his hand.  \"I do not know your name,\" he said pleasantly, \"but mine is Clark. My son Donald and I have come from Boston to see the ranch.\"  The man sprang forward.  \"I'm Tom Thornton, sir. What a pleasure to have a visit from you! Such an unexpected visit, too.\"  He slapped Mr. Clark heartily on the shoulder and took Donald's hand in a tight grip.  But though he talked loudly, and laughed a great deal while carrying in their luggage, for some reason Donald felt certain that really Tom Thornton was not glad to see them at all.  [Illustration]     Chapter II  WHO SANDY WAS   The next morning both Donald and his father were astir early.  There was nothing to keep them within the great chilly house, and everything to lure them into the sunshine. The sky was without a cloud, and into its blueness stretched distant ranges of hazy mountains at whose feet nestled lower hills covered with faint green. Near at hand patches of meadow were toned to grayish white by grazing bands of sheep. On the still air came the flat, metallic note of herd-bells, and the bleating of numberless unseen flocks within the pens and barns.  What a novel scene it was!  The newcomers found their way to a sheltered corner where they could look out before them into the vastness.  It was all so strange, so interesting!  Somewhere in the ravine below they could catch the rushing music of a stream which wove itself in and out a maze of rolling hills and was lost at last in the shadows of the green valleys.  As they stood silent and drank in the beauty about them, an angry voice broke the stillness.  It came from the interior of the barn near which they were standing.  \"I tell you what, Tom Thornton, I'm with Sandy McCulloch. The sheep always were washed after shearing in Old Angus's day, and in Johnson's as well. That is how Crescent Ranch came to have the good name it now holds. There were no scabby sheep here to infect the rest of the herd.\"  \"What's that to you, Jack Owen? You are here to mind the boss, ain't you? What's the use of our working like beavers for ten days to dip the flock if we don't have to? Dipping is a dirty, tiresome job. You are not in for making work for yourself, are you?\"  \"The flocks will be ruined!\"  \"What do you care--they are not your sheep.\"  \"Well, I have been on this ranch a long time, Thornton, and I can't help caring what becomes of 'em. I take the same pride in the place Sandy does. We have won a reputation here for doing things the way they ought to be done--for minding the laws--for having clean, healthy stock. Sandy says he shall dip his herd, anyway.\"  \"Bother Sandy! He's talked to you men until he's got you all upset. You would have been with me if he had kept his mouth shut. But no matter what he says I am running this ranch at "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24858"],["title","The Story of Wool (#2)"],["body","present. I mean to run it in the future, too. If you're wise you will do as I tell you.\"  \"Mr. Clark may have something to say about the dipping.\"  \"Don't you fret,\" sneered Thornton. \"I sounded him last night. He's a tenderfoot. I don't believe he knows a thing about sheeping.\"  Mr. Clark drew Donald into the sun-flooded field before he spoke.  Then, after a thoughtful silence he turned:  \"Well, Don?\"  \"I wouldn't have that Thornton here another day, father!\" broke out the boy hotly.  \"Slowly, son, slowly! We must be sure about Thornton before we condemn him. He has been ten years on the ranch; more than that, we are without a manager, and we have none in view. Remember 'he stumbles who runs fast.' Take time, Don, take time.\"  Donald flushed.  \"I know it is the best way, but I was so angry to hear him talking that way about you.\"  \"Loyalty is a fine trait, Don.\" Mr. Clark laid his hand affectionately on his son's shoulder. \"I like to see you loyal. But in this matter we must move slowly.\"  \"What about this dipping, father? What is it?\"  \"Something about washing the sheep. I do not clearly understand it myself.\"  \"Shall you have it done?\"  \"What do you say?\"  \"Of course I do not know anything about it,\" Donald replied modestly, \"but somehow I feel as if Sandy and the men are right.\"  \"I think so too.\"  \"Couldn't I ask Sandy what it is, father?\"  \"I am thinking of asking him myself, Don, if I get a good chance.\"  The chance came unexpectedly, for at that very moment Sandy McCulloch came out of one of the sheep-pens and crossed the walk to the central barn.  \"What are you up to to-day, Sandy?\" called Mr. Clark.  \"I am going to dip my flock, sir, down in the south meadow.\"  \"I am glad of that, for it will give us a chance to see it done,\" observed Mr. Clark. Then lowering his voice he asked: \"Why do you dip the sheep, Sandy?\"  \"Are you asking because you want to know?\" inquired Sandy with the directness which characterized everything he said.  \"Yes, Both Donald and I wish to learn.\"  \"Well, sir, it is this way. After the shearing is over and the fleece removed, the coat of the sheep is light and therefore easily dried. We then take the flocks and run them through a bath of lime and sulphur. Some shepherds prefer a coal-tar dip. Whatever the dip is made of, the purpose is the same. It is to kill the parasites on the sheep and cure any diseases of the eyes. If sheep are not dipped they get the 'scab.' Some bit of a creature gets under their skin and burrows until it makes the sheep sick. Often, too, the wool will peel off in great patches. One sheep will take it from another, until by and by the whole herd is infected.\"  Mr. Clark nodded.  \"I never mean to let a sickly sheep go on the range,\" continued Sandy. \"I try to flax round and find out what is the matter with him so I can cure him. We don't want our herd spoiling the feeding grounds and the water-holes and giving their diseases to all the flocks that graze after them. If we are let graze on the range the least we can do is to be decent about it--that's the way I look at it.\"  \"Have our sheep always been dipped?\"  \"Aye, sir, that they have--dipped every spring after shearing; then we clipped their feet before they started for the range. Sheep, you know, walk on two toes, and if their feet are not trimmed they get sore from traveling so much. I suppose nature intended sheep to climb over the rocks and wear their hoofs down that way. They have a queer foot. Did you know that there is a little oily gland between the toes to make the hoof moist, and keep it from cracking?\"  \"No, I guess neither Donald nor I knew that, did we, Donald? Now about this dipping--do you thoroughly understand how it is done, Sandy?\"  \"I do that, sir.\"  Donald wondered why his father was so thoughtful.  \"How long have you been at Crescent Ranch, Sandy?\" asked Mr. Clark at last.  \"Ever since I was a lad of fifteen, sir.\"  \"That must be about ten years!\"  \"Fourteen.\"  A new thought came to Mr. Clark.  \"Why, then you must have known Old Angus,\" he exclaimed.  \"I did, sir.\"  \"He was a fine old man, they tell me.\"  \"He was.\"  \"I never saw him--I wish I had. It was a great loss to the ranch and to all of us when he went.\"  \"It was indeed.\"  \"You must remember him well, Sandy.\"  Throwing back his head with a gesture of pride, Sandy confronted Mr. Clark.  \"I do, sir,\" he replied simply. \"He was my father.\"  Mr. Clark and Donald stared.  \"Why didn't you tell me that in the first place?\" cried Donald's father, stepping forward eagerly and seizing the hand of the young ranchman.  \"I thought mayhap you knew it. If not--why prate about it? It's on my own feet I must stand and not on my father's. If I am of any use you will find it out fast enough, father or no father; if I'm not 'twere best you found that out as well.\"  \"Independent as your forebears, Sandy!\" laughed Mr. Clark.  \"I be a McCulloch, sir!\" was all Sandy said.  [Illustration]     CHAPTER III  THE DIPPING   It was a great surprise to Tom Thornton when Mr. Clark informed him that he wanted the men to start in dipping the sheep as soon as they could get ready.  \"I suppose, Thornton, you have everything in readiness for the work,\" continued the owner casually.  Thornton did not hesitate.  \"Yes, indeed, sir. We can start right in to-day if you wish. It is for you to say. But really, Mr. Clark, the flock hardly needs it. Our sheep are in prime condition.\"  \"That's all the more reason for keeping them so, Thornton,\" was the smiling reply.  \"Of course that is true, sir. Very well. We will go ahead. I think I shall have time to give the orders, although I have got to be in Glen City about ten days shipping the clip.\"  \"What?\"  \"Shipping the wool, sir.\"  \"Oh, yes.\"  \"I can start the work before I go.\"  \"I don't think you need bother, Thornton,\" remarked Mr. Clark slowly. \"You go on down to Glen City and finish up your business there.\"  \"But somebody must see to the dipping if you really want it done.\"  \"I'll attend to it.\"  \"You!\"  \"Why not?\"  \"Why--why--nothing, sir. I beg your pardon. Only I thought you might be too tired after your trip.\"  \"Oh, no. I am not tired at all.\"  Thornton eyed him.  Even Donald was astonished.  Mr. Clark did not seem to be at all disturbed by the embarrassing stillness, but went on shaving down a stick he was whittling.  \"I do not mean to manage the dipping myself,\" he explained at last. \"I shall let Sandy McCulloch take charge of it.\"  \"Sandy McCulloch! Why, sir, that boy could never do it in the world! He is a good lad--well enough in his way--but not very smart. Not at all like his father.\"  \"Well, if he has no ability I shall soon find it out. I mean to try him, anyway.\"  \"Oh, you can try him if you like, but I know the fellow better than you do. You are foolish to turn any big work over to him. He can't handle it.\"  \"I intend to give him the chance.\"  Thornton's annoyance began to get beyond his control.  \"Very well. It is not my business,\" he snapped as he left the room.  The instant he was gone Donald, who could not keep silent another moment, cried:  \"Oh, father! I am so glad you are going to let Sandy manage the dipping!\"  \"It is an experiment, Don. Sandy is young and he may make a mess of things--not because he does not mean well, but because he lacks experience. He has been here a long time, to be sure, but he never has taken any care beyond watching his own flocks.\"  \"I do not think he will fail. The men will all help him. They like him.\"  \"I can see that.\"  \"And I like him too, father.\"  \"So do I, son. I am trusting him with this work not only because I like him but because I feel sure that the son of such a father cannot go far astray. It was a great surprise to me when I found Sandy was the son of Old Angus. You see we all thought so much of the old Scotchman that he was Old Angus to everybody. I had almost forgotten he had another name. I don't think I ever heard any one call him Angus McCulloch in my life. And yet I remember the name now, for I can recall seeing it written out on checks and letters.\"  \"It is a fine name,\" Donald declared.  \"Sandy comes of good stock. I want to help him all I can. If he has the right stuff in him perhaps we can give him a lift. I wish we might, for I feel we owe his father more than we ever can repay.\"  It was great news to Sandy when he learned that not only was he to dip his own flock, but that into his hands was to be put the dipping of the entire herd.  \"I'm no so sure I can manage it, Mr. Clark,\" he said modestly, lapsing, as he often did, into his broad Scotch. \"I'll do the best I can though, sir.\"  \"I am sure you will.\"  And Sandy did do his best!  The hot dip, with the proper proportions of lime and sulphur, was prepared, and Sandy tested its temperature by seeing if he could bear his hand in it. Then the long cement troughs were filled. These troughs were just wide enough so the sheep were not able to turn. Groups of sheep that had been driven from the larger enclosures to the small pens near the dipping troughs were then hurried, one by one, to the men standing at the head of the troughs; it was the duty of these men to push each sheep in turn down the smooth metal incline into the dip. The sheep slipped in easily. As they swam along through the steaming bath other men were posted midway and when a sheep passed they thrust the head twice under water with their crooks so that the eyes and heads--as well as the bodies--might be cleansed. At the far end of the troughs still other herders helped the bedraggled creatures out onto a draining platform where they dripped for a time and were afterward driven back into their pens.  \"I shouldn't think the sheep would ever dry!\" Donald remarked to Sandy as they watched the process.  \"Oh, they do; only it takes a couple of days--and sometimes more before their wool is thoroughly dry,\" answered the Scotchman.  Donald looked on, fascinated.  The work proceeded without a hitch.  The sheep were fed into the troughs, hurried "]]]
