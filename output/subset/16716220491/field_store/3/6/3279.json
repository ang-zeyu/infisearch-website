Can you lend me five pounds?\"  Jack looked at Harry in alarm. He was afraid Harry would grant the favor, knowing his obliging disposition. But he didn't know our hero. Harry was ready to do anything for a near friend, but he was too prudent to waste his money on acquaintances who had no sort of claim on him.  \"I am sorry to refuse, Mr. Fletcher,\" he said, \"but Jack and I are ourselves very poorly provided with money, and just before you came in we were considering how we could manage to pay for the necessary outfit.\"  \"Haven't you got five pounds?\" asked Fletcher quickly.  \"Of course we have, or we should be unable to get to the mines.\"  \"Then I think you might oblige me,\" he continued, looking very much displeased.  \"I am the best judge of my circumstances,\" said Harry shortly.  Fletcher looked hard at him, and saw that the boy he had to deal with had a mind of his own, and was not to be imposed upon easily. Still he made a farther effort.  \"Then I think,\" he said coldly, \"I shall not be able to assist you in your preparations.\"  \"Just as you please,\" answered Harry promptly. \"As you volunteered, I accepted your proposal. Now I will act for myself. I have heard of a party about to start, and I will arrange to join it.\"  Fletcher felt that he was outgeneralled. He did not mean to let Harry and Jack slip through his fingers, for he had an idea, notwithstanding Harry's disclaimer, that he had a large sum of money, and thought he would be a good party to hang on to. He saw that he had made a false move, and hastened to repair it.  \"Excuse me,\" he said, assuming a hearty tone; \"I was hasty, and I apologize. You are right, and I like you too well to cut up rough, just because you can't do me a favor. There, take my hand, and we will make it all up.\"  \"With pleasure,\" answered Harry, as he accepted the proffered hand, and Jack followed his example. Nevertheless Fletcher's demand had produced an unpleasant effect upon him. The coarse-grained selfishness of the man had shown through his outward varnish of good-fellowship, and he felt that henceforth he must be on his guard.  \"I may have to ask for some money, however,\" continued Fletcher, in an off-hand manner, \"for it is necessary to buy supplies for our journey. You know we shan't be able to put up at hotels on our way, but must furnish our own meals.\"  \"So I have heard,\" answered Harry. \"What is it customary to take?\"  \"Well, it will be best to buy a bag of coffee, a sack of flour, some ship biscuits, potatoes, and sugar. That will do to start on, and we shall vary our diet by what we are able to kill on the way.\"  \"What can we kill?\"  \"Well, kangaroo meat isn't bad, and we can bring down a few birds occasionally.\"  \"Then we shall need guns?\"  \"Yes, it will be well to have them.\"  This was another expense upon which Harry had not calculated. He began to think that he had been very improvident. The professor would readily have left him a hundred dollars more, and as it would have been repaid with his own money, he was sorry he had not availed himself of it.  \"How much do you think the supplies will cost?\" asked Harry.  \"Well, you had better let me have ten pounds. I think that will be sufficient.\"  \"For the whole or for our share?\" asked Harry pointedly.  \"For your share,\" answered Fletcher after a pause. \"It seems to me you are very suspicious.\"  Really he had intended to make the two boys pay for the whole stock of provisions and save his own purse, for he had in reality as much money as they.  \"I only wanted to understand clearly,\" said Harry quietly. \"As we are in some sort partners, that is fair, is it not?\"  \"Oh, yes,\" returned Fletcher, but he did not respond with any alacrity. \"I'm always fair and above board, I am. No man can say that Dick Fletcher ever tried to get the best of him. Why, if I was better fixed I wouldn't let you two boys pay a cent. I'd shoulder the whole thing myself.\"  \"Your offer is a very kind one, Mr. Fletcher----\"  \"Don't say Mr. Fletcher; call me Dick,\" interrupted their new acquaintance.  \"I will if you wish it, though as you are so much older, it hardly seems proper. What I was going to say was that Jack and myself are determined to pay our share. We couldn't accept any such favor as you mention.\"  \"That's all right. Now, if you let me have the ten pounds I'll take all the trouble off your hands, and have everything ready for a start to-morrow morning.\"  \"I would prefer to go with you and help select the articles.\"  Fletcher looked disconcerted.  \"Oh, well, if you think I aint capable----\" he began.  \"I think nothing of the kind, but I want to learn as much as I can. I may have to do it alone some time.\"  It was well Harry adhered to his determination. It saved him three pounds, and Fletcher was forced to pay his share, as he had not intended to do. While they were making purchases they were accosted by a tall loose-jointed man, whom it was easy to recognize as a Yankee.  \"Goin' to the mines, boys?\" he asked in a strong nasal tone.  \"Yes,\" answered Harry.  \"So am I. I'd like to hook on to your party if you aint no objections.\"  For some reason Dick Fletcher did not appear to relish the proposal.  \"I don't think we can accommodate you,\" he said abruptly.  \"I think we can,\" said Harry, who was beginning to be distrustful of Fletcher, and felt safer in adding another to the party. \"There are but three of us, and we shall be glad of your company.\"  Dick Fletcher looked angry, but did not venture to oppose the plan further.     CHAPTER IV.  A TIMELY RESCUE.  On the last evening spent in Melbourne the boys decided to take a farewell walk about the city, not knowing when it would again be their fortune to see it. Neither Fletcher nor their new Yankee acquaintance was at hand, and they started by themselves. They did not confine themselves to the more frequented streets, but followed wherever fancy led.  They had no thought of an adventure, but one awaited them.  As they were turning the corner of a narrow street, their attention was suddenly excited by a sharp cry of blended surprise and fright.  \"What is it, Jack?\" asked Harry, grasping his companion by the arm.  He did not need to await a reply, for by the indistinct light he saw two men struggling a few rods further on. One appeared to be an old man, with white hair, the other was a man of middle age. Clearly it was a case of attempted robbery.  \"Run, Jack, run!\" said Harry, in excitement. \"Let us help the old man!\"  \"I'm with you,\" answered the young sailor briefly.  Harry had in his hand a heavy cane--his only weapon--but he did not stop to consider the personal risk he was running. As he drew near, the old man, whose feeble strength was quite unequal to a conflict with a man so much younger, swayed and fell backward. His assailant bent over him, and despite his feeble resistance began to search his pockets, at the same time indulging in savage threats. The old man gave himself up for lost, but help was nearer than he anticipated.  So occupied was the villain with his disgraceful work that he did not hear the approaching footsteps.  His first intimation of them came in a sounding blow over his shoulders, given by Harry's stick, which was laid on with a good will.  He jumped to his feet with an oath, and darted a rapid glance at his two assailants. Then, much to the surprise of Harry, he turned and ran rapidly away. It was a piece of great good luck, Harry thought, for he was not at all sure that he and Jack combined would have been a match for the highwayman.  \"Are you hurt, sir?\" asked Harry, bending over the old man.  \"Not seriously,\" was the reply. \"Will you kindly help me up?\"  With Jack's help Harry got the old man on his feet. He was a tall man, of splendid aspect, over sixty years of age. He looked like a gentleman of wealth and position.  \"You have had a narrow escape, sir,\" said our hero.  \"Yes, indeed,\" answered the old man, \"thanks to your brave interference. It surprises me that my brutal assailant should have run away from two boys.\"  \"I am surprised also, sir. I feared we should have a hard fight. I suppose his object was robbery.\"  \"Yes, he must have heard in some way that I had a large sum of money about me. Thanks to you, it is safe.\"  \"I am very glad, sir.\"  \"Do you mind accompanying me to my house? This attack has made me timid.\"  \"With pleasure, sir.\"  The old gentleman lived perhaps a quarter of a mile distant in a handsome house. He pressed the boys to enter, and they did so. He questioned them as to their plans, and then selecting two bank-notes of large denomination, urged the boys to accept them as a recognition of the help they had given him at a critical moment. The boys, however, declined positively to accept any compensation, but expressed their satisfaction at having been of service.  \"At least,\" said the old gentleman, \"you must promise to call on me when you return from the mines. There is my card.\"  \"That we will do with pleasure, sir,\" answered Harry.  He looked at the card, and read the name of Henry A. Woolson.  \"Harry,\" said Jack, as they resumed their walk, \"do you know that robber had a look like Fletcher?\"  \"So I thought, Jack, but I had only a glimpse, and could not be sure. I wish he were not to be in our party.\"  \"We must be on our guard; I don't fancy him much.\"  When the boys saw Fletcher in the morning he appeared as usual, and they were disposed to think they were mistaken. Yet the lurking suspicion occurred to them from time to time, and made them feel uneasy.  The next day they set out on their journey, accompanied by Dick Fletcher and Obed Stackpole.     CHAPTER V.

The decrees of the Convention were everywhere received with submission. London, true during fifty eventful years to the cause of civil freedom and of the reformed religion, was foremost in professing loyalty to the new Sovereigns. Garter King at arms, after making proclamation under the windows of Whitehall, rode in state along the Strand to Temple Bar. He was followed by the maces of the two Houses, by the two Speakers, Halifax and Powle, and by a long train of coaches filled with noblemen and gentlemen. The magistrates of the City threw open their gates and joined the procession. Four regiments of militia lined the way up Ludgate Hill, round Saint Paul's Cathedral, and along Cheapside. The streets, the balconies, and the very housetops were crowded with gazers. All the steeples from the Abbey to the Tower sent forth a joyous din. The proclamation was repeated, with sound of trumpet, in front of the Royal Exchange, amidst the shouts of the citizens.  In the evening every window from Whitechapel to Piccadilly was lighted up. The state rooms of the palace were thrown open, and were filled by a gorgeous company of courtiers desirous to kiss the hands of the King and Queen. The Whigs assembled there, flushed with victory and prosperity. There were among them some who might be pardoned if a vindictive feeling mingled with their joy. The most deeply injured of all who had survived the evil times was absent. Lady Russell, while her friends were crowding the galleries of Whitehall, remained in her retreat, thinking of one who, if he had been still living, would have held no undistinguished place in the ceremonies of that great day. But her daughter, who had a few months before become the wife of Lord Cavendish, was presented to the royal pair by his mother the Countess of Devonshire. A letter is still extant in which the young lady described with great vivacity the roar of the populace, the blaze in the streets, the throng in the presence chamber, the beauty of Mary, and the expression which ennobled and softened the harsh features of William. But the most interesting passage is that in which the orphan girl avowed the stern delight with which she had witnessed the tardy punishment of her father's murderer. [1]  The example of London was followed by the provincial towns. During three weeks the Gazettes were filled with accounts of the solemnities by which the public joy manifested itself, cavalcades of gentlemen and yeomen, processions of Sheriffs and Bailiffs in scarlet gowns, musters of zealous Protestants with orange flags and ribands, salutes, bonfires, illuminations, music, balls, dinners, gutters running with ale and conduits spouting claret. [2]  Still more cordial was the rejoicing among the Dutch, when they learned that the first minister of their Commonwealth had been raised to a throne. On the very day of his accession he had written to assure the States General that the change in his situation had made no change in the affection which he bore to his native land, and that his new dignity would, he hoped, enable him to discharge his old duties more efficiently than ever. That oligarchical party, which had always been hostile to the doctrines of Calvin and to the House of Orange, muttered faintly that His Majesty ought to resign the Stadtholdership. But all such mutterings were drowned by the acclamations of a people proud of the genius and success of their great countryman. A day of thanksgiving was appointed. In all the cities of the Seven Provinces the public joy manifested itself by festivities of which the expense was chiefly defrayed by voluntary gifts. Every class assisted. The poorest labourer could help to set up an arch of triumph, or to bring sedge to a bonfire. Even the ruined Huguenots of France could contribute the aid of their ingenuity. One art which they had carried with them into banishment was the art of making fireworks; and they now, in honour of the victorious champion of their faith, lighted up the canals of Amsterdam with showers of splendid constellations. [3]  To superficial observers it might well seem that William was, at this time, one of the most enviable of human beings. He was in truth one of the most anxious and unhappy. He well knew that the difficulties of his task were only beginning. Already that dawn which had lately been so bright was overcast; and many signs portended a dark and stormy day.  It was observed that two important classes took little or no part in the festivities by which, all over England, the inauguration of the new government was celebrated. Very seldom could either a priest or a soldier be seen in the assemblages which gathered round the market crosses where the King and Queen were proclaimed. The professional pride both of the clergy and of the army had been deeply wounded. The doctrine of nonresistance had been dear to the Anglican divines. It was their distinguishing badge. It was their favourite theme. If we are to judge by that portion of their oratory which has come down to us, they had preached about the duty of passive obedience at least as often and as zealously as about the Trinity or the Atonement. [4] Their attachment to their political creed had indeed been severely tried, and had, during a short time, wavered. But with the tyranny of James the bitter feeling which that tyranny had excited among them had passed away. The parson of a parish was naturally unwilling to join in what was really a triumph over those principles which, during twenty-eight years, his flock had heard him proclaim on every anniversary of the Martyrdom and on every anniversary of the Restoration.  The soldiers, too, were discontented. They hated Popery indeed; and they had not loved the banished King. But they keenly felt that, in the short campaign which had decided the fate of their country, theirs had been an inglorious part. Forty fine regiments, a regular army such as had never before marched to battle under the royal standard of England, had retreated precipitately before an invader, and had then, without a struggle, submitted to him. That great force had been"]]]
