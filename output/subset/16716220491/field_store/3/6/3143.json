Two hours after that, the robot delegate, its message delivered, its mission fulfilled, requested to be locked inside a bombproof chamber. When the door was opened, the Delegate was an exploded ruin.  The news flashed with lightning speed over the world, and Jerry Bridges' eyewitness accounts of the incredible event was syndicated throughout the nation. But his sudden celebrity left him vaguely unsatisfied.  He tried to explain his feeling to Greta on his first night back in Washington. They were in his apartment, and it was the first time Greta had consented to pay him the visit.  \"Well, what's _bothering_ you?\" Greta pouted. \"You've had the biggest story of the year under your byline. I should think you'd be tickled pink.\"  \"It's not that,\" Jerry said moodily. \"But ever since I heard the Delegate speak, something's been nagging me.\"  \"But don't you think he's done good? Don't you think they'll be impressed by what he said?\"  \"I'm not worried about that. I think that damn robot did more for peace than anything that's ever come along in this cockeyed world. But still ...\"  Greta snuggled up to him on the sofa. \"You worry too much. Don't you ever think of anything else? You should learn to relax. It can be fun.\"  She started to prove it to him, and Jerry responded the way a normal, healthy male usually does. But in the middle of an embrace, he cried out:  \"Wait a minute!\"  \"What's the matter?\"  \"I just thought of something! Now where the hell did I put my old notebooks?\"  He got up from the sofa and went scurrying to a closet. From a debris of cardboard boxes, he found a worn old leather brief case, and cackled with delight when he found the yellowed notebooks inside.  \"What _are_ they?\" Greta said.  \"My old school notebooks. Greta, you'll have to excuse me. But there's something I've got to do, right away!\"  \"That's all right with me,\" Greta said haughtily. \"I know when I'm not wanted.\"  She took her hat and coat from the hall closet, gave him one last chance to change his mind, and then left.  Five minutes later, Jerry Bridges was calling the airlines.         *       *       *       *       *  It had been eleven years since Jerry had walked across the campus of Clifton University, heading for the ivy-choked main building. It was remarkable how little had changed, but the students seemed incredibly young. He was winded by the time he asked the pretty girl at the desk where Professor Martin Coltz could be located.  \"Professor Coltz?\" She stuck a pencil to her mouth. \"Well, I guess he'd be in the Holland Laboratory about now.\"  \"Holland Laboratory? What's that?\"  \"Oh, I guess that was after your time, wasn't it?\"  Jerry felt decrepit, but managed to say: \"It must be something new since I was here. Where is this place?\"  He followed her directions, and located a fresh-painted building three hundred yards from the men's dorm. He met a student at the door, who told him that Professor Coltz would be found in the physics department.  The room was empty when Jerry entered, except for the single stooped figure vigorously erasing a blackboard. He turned when the door opened. If the students looked younger, Professor Coltz was far older than Jerry remembered. He was a tall man, with an unruly confusion of straight gray hair. He blinked when Jerry said:  \"Hello, Professor. Do you remember me? Jerry Bridges?\"  \"Of course! I thought of you only yesterday, when I saw your name in the papers--\"  They sat at facing student desks, and chatted about old times. But Jerry was impatient to get to the point of his visit, and he blurted out:  \"Professor Coltz, something's been bothering me. It bothered me from the moment I heard the Delegate speak. I didn't know what it was until last night, when I dug out my old college notebooks. Thank God I kept them.\"  Coltz's eyes were suddenly hooded.  \"What do you mean, Jerry?\"  \"There was something about the Robot's speech that sounded familiar--I could have sworn I'd heard some of the words before. I couldn't prove anything until I checked my old notes, and here's what I found.\"  He dug into his coat pocket and produced a sheet of paper. He unfolded it and read aloud.  \"'It's my belief that peace is the responsibility of individuals, of nations, and someday, even of worlds ...' Sound familiar, Professor?\"  Coltz shifted uncomfortably. \"I don't recall every silly thing I said, Jerry.\"  \"But it's an interesting coincidence, isn't it, Professor? These very words were spoken by the Delegate from Venus.\"  \"A coincidence--\"  \"Is it? But I also remember your interest in robotics. I'll never forget that mechanical homing pigeon you constructed. And you've probably learned much more these past eleven years.\"  \"What are you driving at, Jerry?\"  \"Just this, Professor. I had a little daydream, recently, and I want you to hear it. I dreamed about a group of teachers, scientists, and engineers, a group who were suddenly struck by an exciting, incredible idea. A group that worked in the quiet and secrecy of a University on a fantastic scheme to force the idea of peace into the minds of the world's big shots. Does my dream interest you, Professor?\"  \"Go on.\"  \"Well, I dreamt that this group would secretly launch an earth satellite of their own, and arrange for the nose cone to come down safely at a certain time and place. They would install a marvelous electronic robot within the cone, ready to be assembled. They would beam a radio message to earth from the cone, seemingly as if it originated from their 'spaceship.' Then, when the Robot was assembled, they would speak through it to demand peace for all mankind ...\"  \"Jerry, if you do this--\"  \"You don't have to say it, Professor, I know what you're thinking. I'm a reporter, and my business is to tell the world everything I know. But if I did it, there might not be a world for me to write about, would there? No, thanks, Professor. As far as I'm concerned, what I told you was nothing more than a daydream.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Jerry braked the convertible to a halt, and put his arm around Greta's shoulder. She looked up at the star-filled night, and sighed romantically.  Jerry pointed. \"That one.\"  Greta shivered closer to him.  \"And to think what that terrible planet can do to us!\"  \"Oh, I dunno. Venus is also the Goddess of Love.\"  He swung his other arm around her, and Venus winked approvingly.

How much did the man really know about him? “I suppose so,” he said indifferently.  Alexander looked pleased. “But even with your childhood experiences there must be an atavistic streak in you--a throwback to your adventurous Earth forebears who settled your world?”  Kennon shrugged. “Perhaps you’re right. I really don’t know. Actually, I’ve never thought about it. It merely seemed to me that an undeveloped world offered more opportunity.”  “It does,” Alexander said. “But it also offers more work. If you’re figuring that you can get along on the minimum physical effort required on the Central Worlds, you have a shock coming.”  “I’m not that innocent,” Kennon said. “But I am not so stupid that I can’t apply modifications of Betan techniques to worlds as new as this.”  Alexander chuckled. “I like you,” he said suddenly. “Here read this and see if you’d care to work for me.” He picked a contract form from one of the piles of paper on his desk and handed it to Kennon. “This is one of our standard work contracts. Take it back to your hotel and check it over. I’ll expect to see you at this time tomorrow.”  “Why waste time?” Kennon said. “The rapid-reading technique originated on Beta. I can tell you in fifteen minutes.”  “Hmm. Certainly. Read it here if you wish. I like to get things settled--the sooner the better. Sit down, young man and read. You can rouse me when you’re finished.” He turned his attention to the papers on his desk and within seconds was completely oblivious of Kennon, his face set in the rapt trancelike expression of a trained rapid reader.  Kennon watched for a moment as sheets of paper passed through Alexander’s hands to be added to the pile at the opposite end of the desk. The man would do better, he thought, if he would have his staff transcribe the papers to microfilm that could be read through an interval-timed scanner. He might suggest that later. As for now, he shrugged and seated himself in the chair beside the desk. The quiet was broken only by the rustle of paper as the two rapt-faced men turned page after page with mechanical regularity.  Finally Kennon turned the last page, paused, blinked, and performed the necessary mental gymnastics to orient his time sense. Alexander, he noticed, was still engrossed, sunk in his autohypnotic trance. Kennon waited until he had finished the legal folder which he was reading and then gently intruded upon Alexander’s concentration.  Alexander looked up blankly and then went through the same mental gyrations Kennon had performed a few minutes before. His eyes focused and became hard and alert.  “Well?” he asked. “What do you think of it?”  “I think it’s the damnedest, trickiest, most unilateral piece of legalistics I’ve ever seen,” Kennon said bluntly. “If that’s the best you can offer, I wouldn’t touch the job with a pair of forceps.”  Alexander smiled. “I see you read the fine print,” he said. There was quiet amusement in his voice. “So you don’t like the contract?”  “No sensible man would. I’m damned if I’ll sign commitment papers just to get a job. No wonder you’re having trouble getting professional help. If your contracts are all like that it’s’ a wonder anyone works for you.”  “We have no complaints from our employees,” Alexander said stiffly.  “How could you? If they signed that contract you’d have a perfect right to muzzle them.”  “There are other applicants for this post,” Alexander said.  “Then get one of them. I wouldn’t be interested.”  “A spaceman’s ticket is a good thing to have,” Alexander said idly. “It’s a useful ace in the hole. Besides, you have had three other job offers--all of which are good even though they don’t pay fifteen Ems a year.”  Kennon did a quick double take. Alexander’s investigative staff was better than good. It was uncanny.  “But seriously, Dr. Kennon, I am pleased that you do not like that contract. Frankly, I wouldn’t consider employing you if you did.”  “Sir?”  “That contract is a screen. It weeds out the careless, the fools, and the unfit in one operation. A man who would sign a thing like that has no place in my organization.” Alexander chuckled at Kennon’s blank expression. “I see you have had no experience with screening contracts.”  “I haven’t,” Kennon admitted. “On Beta the tests are formal. The Medico-Psych Division supervises them.”  “Different worlds, different methods,” Alexander observed. “But they’re all directed toward the same goal. Here we aren’t so civilized. We depend more on personal judgment.” He took another contract from one of the drawers of his desk. “Take a look at this. I think you’ll be more satisfied.”  “If you don’t mind, I’ll read it now,” Kennon said.  Alexander nodded.  * * *  “It’s fair enough,” Kennon said, “except for Article Twelve.”  “The personal privilege section?  “Yes.”  “Well, that’s the contract. You can take it or leave it.”  “I’ll leave it,” Kennon said. “Thank you for your time.” He rose to his feet, smiled at Alexander, and turned to the door. “Don’t bother to call your receptionist,” he said. “I can find my way out.”  “Just a minute, Doctor,” Alexander said. He was standing behind the desk, holding out his hand.  “Another test?” Kennon inquired.  Alexander nodded. “The critical one,” he said. “Do you want the job?”  “Of course.”  “Without knowing more about it?”  “The contract is adequate. It defines my duties.”  “And you think you can handle them?”  “I know I can.”  “I notice,” Alexander observed, “that you didn’t object to other provisions.”  “No, sir. They’re pretty rigid, but for the salary you are paying I figure you should have some rights. Certainly you have the right to protect your interests. But that Article Twelve is a direct violation of everything a human being should hold sacred besides being a violation of the Peeper Laws. I’d never sign a contract that didn’t carry a full Peeper rider.”  “That’s quite a bit.”  “That’s the minimum,” Kennon corrected. “Naturally, I won’t object to mnemonic erasure of matters pertaining to your business once my contract’s completed and I leave your employment. But until then there will be no conditioning, no erasures, no taps, no snoopers, and no checkups other than the regular periodic psychans. I’ll consult with you on vacation time and will arrange it to suit your convenience. I’ll even agree to emergency recall, but that’s the limit.” Kennon’s voice was flat.  “You realize I’m agreeing to give you a great deal of personal liberty,”  Alexander said. “How can I protect myself?”  “I’ll sign a contingency rider,” Kennon said, “if you will specify precisely what security matters I am not to reveal.”  “I accept,” Alexander said. “Consider yourself hired.” He touched a button on his desk. “Prepare a standard 2-A contract for Dr. Jac Kennon’s signature. And attach two riders, a full P-P-yes, no exceptions--and a security-leak contingency, Form 287-C. Yes--that’s right--that one. And strike out all provisions of Article Twelve which conflict with the Peeper Laws. Yes. Now--and finish it as soon as you can.” He touched another button. “Well, that’s that,” he said. “I hope you’ll enjoy being a member of our group.”  “I think I shall,” Kennon said. “You know, sir, I would have waived part of that last demand if you had cared to argue.”  “I know it,” Alexander said. “But what concessions I could have wrung from you would be relatively unimportant beside the fact that you would be unhappy about them later. What little I could have won here, I’d lose elsewhere. And since I want you, I’d prefer to have you satisfied.”  “I see,” Kennon said. Actually he didn’t see at all. He looked curiously at the entrepreneur. Alexander couldn’t be as easy as he seemed. Objectivity and dispassionate weighing and balancing were nice traits and very helpful ones, but in the bear pit of galactic business they wouldn’t keep their owner alive for five minutes. The interworld trade sharks would have skinned him long ago and divided the stripped carcass of his company between them.  But Outworld was a “respected” company. The exchange reports said so--which made Alexander a different breed of cat entirely. Still, his surface was perfect--polished and impenetrable as a duralloy turret on one of the latest Brotherhood battleships. Kennon regretted he wasn’t a sensitive. It would be nice to know what Alexander really was.  “Tell me, sir,” Kennon asked. “What are the real reasons that make you think I’m the man you want?”  “And you’re the young man who’s so insistent on a personal privacy rider,” Alexander chuckled. “However, there’s no harm telling you. There are several reasons.  “You’re from a culture whose name is a byword for moral integrity. That makes you a good risk so far as your ethics are concerned. In addition you’re the product of one of the finest educational systems in the galaxy-and you have proven your intelligence to my satisfaction. You also showed me that you weren’t a spineless ‘yes man.’ And finally, you have a spirit of adventure. Not one in a million of your people would do what you have done. What more could an entrepreneur ask of a prospective employee?”  Kennon sighed and gave up. Alexander wasn’t going to reveal a thing.  “All I hope,” Alexander continued affably, “is that you’ll find Outworld Enterprises as attractive as did your predecessor Dr. Williamson. He was with us until he died last month--better than a hundred years.”  “Died rather young, didn’t he?”  “Not exactly, he was nearly four hundred when he joined us. My grandfather was essentially conservative. He liked older men, and Old Doc was one of his choices--a good one, too. He was"]]]
