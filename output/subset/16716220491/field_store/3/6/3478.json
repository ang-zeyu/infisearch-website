At any rate we will have a try at it. He looks as if he appreciates being patted and spoken to already. Of course if you treat a horse like a savage he will become savage. Now, stand out of the way.\"  Gathering the reins together, and placing one hand upon the pommel, Vincent sprang into the saddle without touching the stirrups; then he sat for a minute or two patting the horse's neck. Wildfire, apparently disgusted at having allowed himself to be mounted so suddenly, lashed out viciously two or three times, and then refused to move. For half an hour Vincent tried the effect of patient coaxing, but in vain.  \"Well, if you won't do it by fair means you must by foul,\" Vincent said at last, and sharply pricked him with his spurs.  Wildfire sprang into the air, and then began a desperate series of efforts to rid himself of his rider, rearing and kicking in such quick succession that he seemed half the time in the air. Finding after awhile that his efforts were unavailing, he subsided at last into sulky immovability. Again Vincent tried coaxing and patting, but as no success attended these efforts, he again applied the spur sharply. This time the horse responded by springing forward like an arrow from a bow, dashed at the top of his speed across the inclosure, cleared the high fence without an effort, and then set off across the country.  He had attempted to take the bit in his teeth, but with a sharp jerk as he drove the spurs in, Vincent had defeated his intention. He now did not attempt to check or guide him, but keeping a light hand on the reins let him go his own course. Vincent knew that so long as the horse was going full speed it could attempt no trick to unseat him, and he therefore sat easily in his saddle.  For six miles Wildfire continued his course, clearing every obstacle without abatement to his speed, and delighting his rider with his power and jumping qualities. Occasionally, only when the course he was taking would have led him to obstacles impossible for the best jumper to surmount, Vincent attempted to put the slightest pressure upon one rein or the other, so as to direct it to an easier point.  At the end of six miles the horse's speed began slightly to abate, and Vincent, abstaining from the use of his spurs, pressed it with his knees and spoke to it cheerfully urging it forward. He now from time to time bent forward and patted it, and for another six miles kept it going at a speed almost as great as that at which it had started. Then he allowed it gradually to slacken its pace, until at last first the gallop and then the trot ceased, and it broke into a walk.  \"You have had a fine gallop, old fellow,\" Vincent said, patting it; \"and so have I. There's been nothing for you to lose your temper about, and the next road we come upon we will turn our face homeward. Half a dozen lessons like this, and then no doubt we shall be good friends.\"  The journey home was performed at a walk, Vincent talking the greater part of the time to the horse. It took a good deal more than six lessons before Wildfire would start without a preliminary struggle with his master, but in the end kindness and patience conquered. Vincent often visited the horse in the stables, and, taking with him an apple or some pieces of sugar, spent some time there talking to and petting it. He never carried a whip, and never used the spurs except in forcing it to make its first start.  Had the horse been naturally ill-tempered Vincent would probably have failed, but, as he happened afterward to learn, its first owner had been a hot-tempered and passionate young planter, who, instead of being patient with it, had beat it about the head, and so rendered it restive and bad-tempered. Had Vincent not laid aside his whip before mounting it for the first time, he probably would never have effected a cure. It was the fact that the animal had no longer a fear of his old enemy the whip as much as the general course of kindness and good treatment that had effected the change in his behavior.  It was just when Vincent had established a good under-standing between himself and Wildfire that he had the altercation with the overseer, whom he found about to flog the young negro Dan. Pearson had sent the lad half an hour before on a message to some slaves at work at the other end of the estate, and had found him sitting on the ground watching a tree in which he had discovered a possum. That Dan deserved punishment was undoubted. He had at present no regular employment upon the estate. Jake, his father, was head of the stables, and Dan had made himself useful in odd jobs about the horses, and expected to become one of the regular stable hands. The overseer was of opinion that there were already more negroes in the stable than could find employment, and had urged upon Mrs. Wingfield that one of the hands there and the boy Dan should be sent out to the fields. She, however, refused.  \"I know you are quite right, Jonas, in what you say. But there were always four hands in the stable in my father's time, and there always have been up to now; and though I know they have an easy time of it, I certainly should not like to send any of them out to the fields. As to Dan, we will think about it. When his father was about his age he used to lead my pony when I first took to riding, and when there is a vacancy Dan must come into the stable. I could not think of sending him out as a field hand, in the first place for his father's sake, but still more for that of Vincent. Dan used to be told off to see that he did not get into mischief when he was a little boy, and he has run messages and been his special boy since he came back. Vincent wanted to have him as his regular house servant; but it would have broken old Sam's heart if, after being my father's boy and my husband's, another had taken his place as Vincent's.\"  And so Dan had remained in the stable, but regarding Vincent as his special master, carrying notes for him to his friends, or doing any odd jobs he might require, and spending no small portion of his time in sleep. Thus he was an object of special dislike to the overseer; in the first place because he had not succeeded in having his way with regard to him, and in the second because he was a useless hand, and the overseer loved to get as much work as possible out of every one on the estate. The message had been a somewhat important one, as he wanted the slaves for some work that was urgently required; and he lost his temper, or he would not have done an act which would certainly bring him into collision with Vincent.  He was well aware that the lad did not really like him, and that his efforts to gain his good-will had failed, and he had foreseen that sooner or later there would be a struggle for power between them. However, he relied upon his influence with Mrs. Wingfield, and upon the fact that she was the life-owner of the Orangery, and believed that he would be able to maintain his position even when Vincent came of age. Vincent on his side objected altogether to the overseer's treatment of the hands, of which he heard a good deal from Dan, and had already remonstrated with his mother on the subject. He, however, gained nothing by this. Mrs. Wingfield had replied that he was too young to interfere in such matters, that his English ideas would not do in Virginia, and that naturally the slaves were set against the overseer; and that now Pearson had no longer a master to support him, he was obliged to be more severe than before to enforce obedience. At the same time it vexed her at heart that there should be any severity on the Orangery estate, where the best relations had always prevailed between the masters and slaves, and she had herself spoken to Jonas on the subject.  He had given her the same answer that she had given her son: \"The slaves will work for a master, Mrs. Wingfield, in a way they will not for a stranger. They set themselves against me, and if I were not severe with them I should get no work at all out of them. Of course, if you wish it, they can do as they like; but in that case they must have another overseer. I cannot see a fine estate going to ruin. I believe myself some of these Abolition fellows have been getting among them and doing them mischief, and that there is a bad spirit growing up among them. I can assure you that I am as lenient with them as is possible to be. But if they won't work I must make them, so long as I stay here.\"  And so the overseer had had his way. She knew that the man was a good servant, and that the estate was kept in excellent order. After all, the severities of which she had heard complaints were by no means excessive; and it was not to be expected that a Northern overseer could rule entirely by kindness, as the owner of an estate could do. A change would be most inconvenient to her, and she would have difficulty in suiting herself so well another time. Besides, the man had been with her sixteen years, and was, as she believed, devoted to her interests. Therefore she turned a deaf ear to Vincent's remonstrances.  She had always been somewhat opposed to his being left in England at school, urging that he would learn ideas there that would clash with those of the people among whom his life was to be spent; and she still considered that her views had been justified by the result.  The overseer was the first to give his version of the story about Dan's conduct; for on going to the house Vincent found his sisters, Rosa and Annie, in the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28056"],["title","Music and Some Highly Musical People (#1)"],["body","    329-330  LOUISVILLE                                                         330  ST.

A DESCRIPTION OF MUSIC.       \"In the storm, in the smoke, in the fight, I come      To help thee, dear, with my fife and my drum.      My name is Music: and, when the bell      Rings for the dead men, I rule the knell;      And, whenever the mariner wrecked through the blast      Hears the fog-bell sound, it was I who passed.      The poet hath told you how I, a young maid,      Came fresh from the gods to the myrtle shade;      And thence, by a power divine, I stole      To where the waters of the Mincius roll;      Then down by Clitumnus and Arno's vale      I wandered, passionate and pale,      Until I found me at sacred Rome,      Where one of the Medici gave me a home.      Leo--great Leo!--he worshipped me,      And the Vatican stairs for my feet were free.      And, now I am come to your glorious land,      Give me good greeting with open hand.      Remember Beethoven,--I gave him his art,--      And Sebastian Bach, and superb Mozart:      Join _those_ in my worship; and, when you go      Wherever their mighty organs blow,      Hear in them heaven's trumpets to men below.\"       T.W. PARSONS.   What is music? Quite easy is it to answer after the manner of the dictionaries, and say, \"Music is (1) a number of sounds following each other in a natural, pleasing manner; (2) the science of harmonious sounds; and (3) the art of so combining them as to please the ear.\" These are, however, only brief, cold, and arbitrary definitions: music is far more than as thus defined. Indeed, to go no farther in the description of this really sublime manifestation of the beautiful would be to very inadequately express its manifold meanings, its helpful, delightful uses. And yet the impressions made upon the mind and the depth of feeling awakened in the heart by music are such as to render only a partial (a far from satisfying one) description of the same possible, even to those most skilful and eloquent in the use of language; for, in fact, ordinary language, after exhausting all of its many resources in portraying the mind's conceptions, in depicting the heart's finer, deeper feelings, reveals, after all, its poverty, when sought to describe effects so entrancing, and emotions so deep-reaching, as those produced by music. No: the latter must be heard, it must be felt, its sweetly thrilling symphonies must touch the heart and fill the senses, in order that it may be, in its fulness, appreciated; for then it is that music is expressed in a language of most subtle power,--a language all its own, and universal, bearing with it ever an exquisitely touching pathos and sweetness that all mankind may feel.  And so I may not hope to bring here to the reader's mind more than a slight conception of what music is. Nor does he stand in need of any labored effort to teach him the nature and power, the beneficent attributes, of this beautiful art. With his own soul attuned to all the delightful sounds of melody and harmony that everywhere about him, in nature and in art, he constantly hears, the reader requires no great length of words in explanation of that which he so deeply feels, and therefore already understands. Nevertheless, a due regard for the laws of unity, as well as a sincere wish to make this volume, in all its departments, speak the befitting words of tribute to the love-inspiring art of which it aims to treat,--words which, although they may not have the merit of affording great instruction, may at least have that of furnishing to the reader some degree of pleasure,--these are the motives that must serve as an excuse for the little that follows.  I have sometimes thought that only the elevated and elegant language of poetry should be employed in describing music: for music is poetry, and poetry is music; that is, in many of their characteristics they are one and the same. But, to put this idea in another form, let us say that Music is the beautiful sister of Poetry, that other soul-expressing medium; and who would create the latter must commune with the former, and be able to bring to his uses the sweet and finishing graces of her rhythmic forms. In early times, the qualities of the poet and musician were generally actually united in the same person. The poet usually set to music, and in most instances sang, his effusions. Nor to this day have the       \"Poets, who on earth have made us heirs      Of truth and pure delight by heavenly lays,\"  ceased to sing, in bewitching verse, the noble qualities of music.  I have said that music speaks a language all its own, and one that is universal. Bring together a representation of all the nations of the earth, in which body there shall be a very Babel of tongues. All will be confusion until the all-penetrating, the all-thrilling voice of music is heard. At once, silence reigns; each ear quickly catches and recognizes the delicious sounds. The language of each one in the concourse may be different: but with \"music's golden tongue\" all are alike innately acquainted; each heart beats in sympathy with the delightful, absorbing tones of melody; and all seem members of one nation.  Again: music may be called that strangely peculiar form of the beautiful, whose presence seems, indeed is, appropriate on occasions the most diverse in character. Its aid is sought alike to add to the joys of festive scenes, to soothe and elevate the heart on occasions of mourning, and to enhance the solemnity, the excellence, of divine worship.  The poet Collins, aptly associating music with the good and beautiful, calls it the \"heavenly maid.\"  Martin Luther, himself a musical composer and performer of merit, paused in his great work of religious reform to declare, \"I verily think, and am not ashamed to say, that, next to divinity, no art is comparable to music.\" And Disraeli utters this noble thought: \"Were it not for music, we might in these days say the beautiful is dead.\"       \"Touching musical harmony, whether by instrument or by      voice, it being but of high and low in sounds a      proportionable disposition, such, notwithstanding, is the      force thereof, and so pleasing effects it hath in that part      of man which is most divine, that some have thereby been      induced to think that the soul itself is or hath in it      harmony: a thing which delighteth all ages, and beseemeth      all states; a thing as seasonable in grief as in joy; as      decent being added unto actions of greatest weight and      solemnity as being used when men most sequester themselves      from action. The reason hereof is an admirable facility      which music hath to express and represent to the mind, more      inwardly than any other sensible means, the very steps and      inflections of every way, the turns and varieties of all      passion whereunto the mind is subject.\"[1]       \"I would fain know what music is. I seek it as a man seeks      eternal wisdom. Yesterday evening I walked, late in the      moonlight, in the beautiful avenue of lime-trees on the bank      of the Rhine; and I heard a tapping noise and soft singing.      At the door of a cottage, under the blooming lime-tree, sat      a mother and her twin-babies: the one lay at her breast, the      other in a cradle, which she rocked with her foot, keeping      time to her singing. In the very germ, then, when the first      trace of life begins to stir, music is the nurse of the      soul: it murmurs in the ear, and the child sleeps; the tones      are the companions of his dreams; they are the world in      which he lives. He has nothing; the babe, although cradled      in his mother's arms, is alone in the spirit: but tones find      entrance into the half-conscious soul, and nourish it as      earth nourishes the life of plants.\"[2]  [Footnote 1: Hooker.]  [Footnote 2: Bertini.]     II.  THE MUSIC OF NATURE.       \"The lark sings loud, and the throstle's song        Is heard from the depths of the hawthorn dale;      And the rush of the streamlet the vales among        Doth blend with the sighs of the whispering gale.\"       MATIN AND EVENING SONGS.   To the inventive genius of man must, of course, be attributed the present developments, and the beautiful, diversified forms, existing in musical art. But, before man was, the great Author of harmony had created what may be called the music of Nature.  Afterwards, the human ear, penetrated by sounds of melody issuing from wind, wave, or bird, the rapt mind in strange and pleasing wonder contemplating the new and charming harmonies,--then it was that man received his first impressions, and took his first lessons in delightful symphony.  Take from man all creative and performing power in music, leaving him only the ear to catch and the mind to comprehend the sounds, and there would still be left to him God's own music,--the music of Nature, which, springing as it did from eternity, shall last throughout eternity.  Passing what must appear to human comprehension as vague (an attempt at the contemplation of which would be without profit in this connection), and what has been called the \"music of the spheres,\"[3] we may proceed to briefly touch upon those forms of natural music which are ever within our hearing, "]]]
