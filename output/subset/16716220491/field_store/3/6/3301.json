It is my affair.”  “But I would like to help you.”  “No, dear.”  Charlotte’s energy! And her unselfishness! She had been thus all her life, but really, on this Italian tour, she was surpassing herself. So Lucy felt, or strove to feel. And yet—there was a rebellious spirit in her which wondered whether the acceptance might not have been less delicate and more beautiful. At all events, she entered her own room without any feeling of joy.  “I want to explain,” said Miss Bartlett, “why it is that I have taken the largest room. Naturally, of course, I should have given it to you; but I happen to know that it belongs to the young man, and I was sure your mother would not like it.”  Lucy was bewildered.  “If you are to accept a favour it is more suitable you should be under an obligation to his father than to him. I am a woman of the world, in my small way, and I know where things lead to. However, Mr. Beebe is a guarantee of a sort that they will not presume on this.”  “Mother wouldn’t mind I’m sure,” said Lucy, but again had the sense of larger and unsuspected issues.  Miss Bartlett only sighed, and enveloped her in a protecting embrace as she wished her good-night. It gave Lucy the sensation of a fog, and when she reached her own room she opened the window and breathed the clean night air, thinking of the kind old man who had enabled her to see the lights dancing in the Arno and the cypresses of San Miniato, and the foot-hills of the Apennines, black against the rising moon.  Miss Bartlett, in her room, fastened the window-shutters and locked the door, and then made a tour of the apartment to see where the cupboards led, and whether there were any oubliettes or secret entrances. It was then that she saw, pinned up over the washstand, a sheet of paper on which was scrawled an enormous note of interrogation. Nothing more.  “What does it mean?” she thought, and she examined it carefully by the light of a candle. Meaningless at first, it gradually became menacing, obnoxious, portentous with evil. She was seized with an impulse to destroy it, but fortunately remembered that she had no right to do so, since it must be the property of young Mr. Emerson. So she unpinned it carefully, and put it between two pieces of blotting-paper to keep it clean for him. Then she completed her inspection of the room, sighed heavily according to her habit, and went to bed.     Chapter II In Santa Croce with No Baedeker   It was pleasant to wake up in Florence, to open the eyes upon a bright bare room, with a floor of red tiles which look clean though they are not; with a painted ceiling whereon pink griffins and blue amorini sport in a forest of yellow violins and bassoons. It was pleasant, too, to fling wide the windows, pinching the fingers in unfamiliar fastenings, to lean out into sunshine with beautiful hills and trees and marble churches opposite, and close below, the Arno, gurgling against the embankment of the road.  Over the river men were at work with spades and sieves on the sandy foreshore, and on the river was a boat, also diligently employed for some mysterious end. An electric tram came rushing underneath the window. No one was inside it, except one tourist; but its platforms were overflowing with Italians, who preferred to stand. Children tried to hang on behind, and the conductor, with no malice, spat in their faces to make them let go. Then soldiers appeared—good-looking, undersized men—wearing each a knapsack covered with mangy fur, and a great-coat which had been cut for some larger soldier. Beside them walked officers, looking foolish and fierce, and before them went little boys, turning somersaults in time with the band. The tramcar became entangled in their ranks, and moved on painfully, like a caterpillar in a swarm of ants. One of the little boys fell down, and some white bullocks came out of an archway. Indeed, if it had not been for the good advice of an old man who was selling button-hooks, the road might never have got clear.  Over such trivialities as these many a valuable hour may slip away, and the traveller who has gone to Italy to study the tactile values of Giotto, or the corruption of the Papacy, may return remembering nothing but the blue sky and the men and women who live under it. So it was as well that Miss Bartlett should tap and come in, and having commented on Lucy’s leaving the door unlocked, and on her leaning out of the window before she was fully dressed, should urge her to hasten herself, or the best of the day would be gone. By the time Lucy was ready her cousin had done her breakfast, and was listening to the clever lady among the crumbs.  A conversation then ensued, on not unfamiliar lines. Miss Bartlett was, after all, a wee bit tired, and thought they had better spend the morning settling in; unless Lucy would at all like to go out? Lucy would rather like to go out, as it was her first day in Florence, but, of course, she could go alone. Miss Bartlett could not allow this. Of course she would accompany Lucy everywhere. Oh, certainly not; Lucy would stop with her cousin. Oh, no! that would never do. Oh, yes!  At this point the clever lady broke in.  “If it is Mrs. Grundy who is troubling you, I do assure you that you can neglect the good person. Being English, Miss Honeychurch will be perfectly safe. Italians understand. A dear friend of mine, Contessa Baroncelli, has two daughters, and when she cannot send a maid to school with them, she lets them go in sailor-hats instead. Every one takes them for English, you see, especially if their hair is strained tightly behind.”  Miss Bartlett was unconvinced by the safety of Contessa Baroncelli’s daughters. She was determined to take Lucy herself, her head not being so very bad. The clever lady then said that she was going to spend a long morning in Santa Croce, and if Lucy would come too, she would be delighted.  “I will take you by a dear dirty back way, Miss Honeychurch, and if you bring me luck, we shall have an adventure.”  Lucy said that this was most kind, and at once opened the Baedeker, to see where Santa Croce was.  “Tut, tut! Miss Lucy! I hope we shall soon emancipate you from Baedeker. He does but touch the surface of things. As to the true Italy—he does not even dream of it. The true Italy is only to be found by patient observation.”  This sounded very interesting, and Lucy hurried over her breakfast, and started with her new friend in high spirits. Italy was coming at last. The Cockney Signora and her works had vanished like a bad dream.  Miss Lavish—for that was the clever lady’s name—turned to the right along the sunny Lung’ Arno. How delightfully warm! But a wind down the side streets cut like a knife, didn’t it? Ponte alle Grazie—particularly interesting, mentioned by Dante. San Miniato—beautiful as well as interesting; the crucifix that kissed a murderer—Miss Honeychurch would remember the story. The men on the river were fishing. (Untrue; but then, so is most information.) Then Miss Lavish darted under the archway of the white bullocks, and she stopped, and she cried:  “A smell! a true Florentine smell! Every city, let me teach you, has its own smell.”  “Is it a very nice smell?” said Lucy, who had inherited from her mother a distaste to dirt.  “One doesn’t come to Italy for niceness,” was the retort; “one comes for life. Buon giorno! Buon giorno!” bowing right and left. “Look at that adorable wine-cart! How the driver stares at us, dear, simple soul!”  So Miss Lavish proceeded through the streets of the city of Florence, short, fidgety, and playful as a kitten, though without a kitten’s grace. It was a treat for the girl to be with any one so clever and so cheerful; and a blue military cloak, such as an Italian officer wears, only increased the sense of festivity.  “Buon giorno! Take the word of an old woman, Miss Lucy: you will never repent of a little civility to your inferiors. _That_ is the true democracy. Though I am a real Radical as well. There, now you’re shocked.”  “Indeed, I’m not!” exclaimed Lucy. “We are Radicals, too, out and out. My father always voted for Mr. Gladstone, until he was so dreadful about Ireland.”  “I see, I see. And now you have gone over to the enemy.”  “Oh, please—! If my father was alive, I am sure he would vote Radical again now that Ireland is all right. And as it is, the glass over our front door was broken last election, and Freddy is sure it was the Tories; but mother says nonsense, a tramp.”  “Shameful! A manufacturing district, I suppose?”  “No—in the Surrey hills. About five miles from Dorking, looking over the Weald.”  Miss Lavish seemed interested, and slackened her trot.  “What a delightful part; I know it so well. It is full of the very nicest people. Do you know Sir Harry Otway—a Radical if ever there was?”  “Very well indeed.”  “And old Mrs. Butterworth the philanthropist?”  “Why, she rents a field of us! How funny!”  Miss Lavish looked at the narrow ribbon of sky, and murmured: “Oh, you have property in Surrey?”  “Hardly any,” said Lucy, fearful of being thought a snob. “Only thirty acres—just the garden, all downhill, and some fields.”  Miss Lavish was not disgusted, and said it was just the size of her aunt’s Suffolk estate. Italy receded. They tried to remember the last name of Lady Louisa someone, who had taken a house near Summer Street the other year, but she had not liked it, which was odd of her. And just as Miss Lavish had got the name, she broke off and exclaimed:  “Bless us! Bless us and save us! We’ve lost the way.”  Certainly they had seemed a long time in reaching Santa Croce, the tower of which had been plainly visible from the landing window. But Miss Lavish had said so much about knowing her Florence by heart, that Lucy had followed her with no misgivings.  “Lost! lost! My dear Miss Lucy, during our political diatribes we have taken a wrong turning.

Producing his violin from an old green baize bag,[19] bending forward, and holding his violin against his chest, instead of under the chin in the modern fashion, most particular about his instrument being in perfect tune, in execution awkward yet vigorous, painstaking rather than brilliant, he would often attend at the Oratory School Sunday practices between two and four of an afternoon, Father Ryder and Father Norris sometimes coming to play also. For many years Dr. Newman had given up the violin,[20] but finding some of the school taking to the strings, he took it up again by way of encouraging them to persevere in what he deemed to be so good a thing for his boys. And he quietly inculcated a lesson in self-effacement too, for albeit he had begun the violin very long before our time, he invariably took second fiddle. He had no high opinion of his own performances. Answering the Liverpool anti-Popery spouter's summons to battle, he relied rather on his friends' estimate of his powers than upon his own. \"Canon M'Neill's well-known talents as a finished orator would make such a public controversy an unfair trial of strength between them, because he himself was no orator. He had in fact no practice in public speaking. _His friends, however, told him_ that he was no mean performer on the violin, and if he agreed to meet Canon M'Neill, he would only make one condition, that the Canon should open the meeting, and say all he had to say, after which he (Mr. Newman) would conclude with a tune on the violin. The public would then be able to judge which was the better man.\"[21] With mere fiddling, a fluency void of expression he had little patience, and when, at a term \"break-up,\" a youth's bow cleverly capered about on a violoncello, he uttered no compliment when the boy had concluded his flourishes. It was a mere display for executive skill, without feeling.  [Footnote 10: Mozley, _Correspondence_, i. p. 52.]  [Footnote 11: _Ibid._]  [Footnote 12: Mozley, _Corr._ i. p. 71. On one occasion (between 1860-70) two Oratory boys went up to his room to make a complaint, and hearing only \"fiddling\" the other side of the door, made bold to enter, but their visit was ill-timed. \"Every Englishman's house is his castle,\" said the Father, and he \"went on fiddling.\" This term, \"Father,\" is what every one in the house called Dr. Newman, and correctly, as being Father Superior of the Oratory. It is the name (it need scarcely be added) that he liked to be called by.]  [Footnote 13: _Ibid._ i. p. 104: Provost Hawkins, at this time a Fellow, and ultimately succeeding Copleston, had no love for music, and rather despised such a thing as being \"a sign of an effeminate (or frivolous) mind.\" He used one or other of these terms, or _both_.]  [Footnote 14: Mozley, _Corr._ ii. p. 22.]  [Footnote 15: _Ibid._ i. p. 146.]  [Footnote 16: She writes in July, 1843: \"Now I do so wish, John, you would pay us a visit. I will practise hard to get up some Beethoven.\" (Mozley, _Corr._ ii. 415.)]  [Footnote 17: With this difference, however, Philomel had not to learn her regrets: she knew them already.]  [Footnote 18: _Reminiscences_, i. pp. 247, 248, Second Edition, 1882. Of statements in this work the Cardinal humorously observed: \"When a thing won't stand on three legs, Tom supplies a fourth.\" The Father played the viola a good deal, which is larger than the violin; hence Mr. Mozley's \"different instruments,\" &c.]  [Footnote 19: One of the boys was once lent this aged green baize bag, and losing it, never heard the end of it. Whenever there was question of lending him anything else, the Father would say very quietly: \"I think I lent you a green baize bag.\" Nor would he allow that it was lost: \"You mean mislaid.\"]  [Footnote 20: A friend remembers Father Whitty, S.J., bringing to Maryvale Mr. McCarthy and Mr. M'Quoin, young converts and subsequently priests (the former is still living in Jersey). Both played the violin, so an instrumental quartet was essayed (a rare event in the community), the executants being the two named, and Fathers Newman and Bowles (violoncello).]  [Footnote 21: Father Lockhart, in the _Paternoster Review_ for September, 1890.]  Readers will remember here the passage in _Loss and Gain_: \"Bateman: 'If you attempt more, it's like taxing a musical instrument beyond its powers.' Reding: 'You but try, Bateman, to make a bass play quadrilles, and you will see what is meant by taxing an instrument.' Bateman: 'Well, I have heard Lindley play all sorts of quick tunes on his bass, and most wonderful it is.' Reding: 'Wonderful is the right word, it is very wonderful. You say, \"How _can_ he manage it? It's very wonderful for a bass;\" but it is not pleasant in itself. In like manner, I have always felt a disgust when Mr. So-and-so comes forward to make his sweet flute bleat and bray like a haut-bois; it's forcing the poor thing to do what it was never made for.'\"[22]  [Footnote 22: _Loss and Gain_, p. 284, Sixth Edition, 1874.]  In the same mood, when a quartet of Schubert was played to him in March, 1878, the sole remark he let fall was, \"Very harmonious and clever, but it does not touch the heart.\"  In March, 1883, he observed that he missed the minor key in Palestrina, and on our adding that, perhaps, Mendelssohn had too much of it, he went on, \"It cuts me to the heart that minor,\" and so he liked the mixed mode to the Psalm _In exitu Israel_, and was much affected by the slow movements in Beethoven's Ninth Quartet and C minor Symphony, and the Allegretto of the Symphony in A.       I cannot of that music rightly say,      Whether I hear or touch or taste the tones,      Oh, what a heart-subduing melody![23]  [Footnote 23: _The Dream of Gerontius._]  There was just that human element about it, so \"deeply pathetic,\" which in the same way made him prefer Euripides to Sophocles, for all the latter's \"sweet composure, melodious fulness, majesty and grace.\"[24] And here we may add, that as late as January, 1890, _apropos_ of a Greek play for his school, he was as keen and eager as ever about the merits of Euripides, expressed himself as being at a loss to understand the critics invariably preferring Sophocles to the other two, and evidently placed Euripides and Æschylus first and second respectively. A frequently true and natural feeling, whether displayed by the author of the _Bacchæ_, or by the composer of _Fidelio_, evidently almost atoned, in his estimation, for every deficiency.  [Footnote 24: _Essays_, i. 7, Fifth Edit.]  He writes to his sister, October, 1834: \"There is a lady here\" (at Tunbridge Wells), \"who plays most beautifully. I think I never heard such a touch--why, I cannot make out, for she has not long fingers to be brilliant. So you must set yourself to rival her. It would be interesting to _examine_ the causes of expression, which you might easily do. _Strength_ of finger is one thing certainly. This lady is not brilliant in the common sense--that is, smart and rattling--but every note is so full-toned, so perfect, that one requires nothing beyond itself. This in Beethoven's effective passages produces a surprising effect. I accompanied her last night and am to do so again to-night.\"[25] He wrote in September, 1865, of a certain boy's progress with the violin: \"He plays fluently, so to say; by fluency I mean in time, in tune, and with execution. This is stage one; stage two is eloquence, by which I mean grace, delicacy, and expression. To gain this nothing is better than to accompany his sisters. A boy who always is first fiddle is in danger of artistic faults parallel to those which are implied in the metaphorical sense of the words. When he comes back I think he has had enough of the music-master, and I shall try to make him turn his thoughts to a higher school of music than is suitable to a beginner, but I cannot tell whether he is old enough to take to it. I recollect how slow I was as a boy to like the school of music which afterwards so possessed me that I have to come to think Haydn, in spite of his genius, almost vulgar.\" And just as Blanco White would seem to have thoroughly initiated Mr. Newman into the mysteries of Beethoven, so did Dr. Newman lead on his boys (as they would say) \"to swear by\" that master. They might start with Corelli, and go on to Romberg, Haydn, and Mozart: their ultimate goal was Beethoven, and round would come the \"Father Superior\" with ancient copies of the quintet version of the celebrated septet, and arrangements from the symphonies; nor were the first ten quartets, the instrumental trios, the violin sonatas, and the overtures forgotten. The \"Dutchman,\" with his force and depth, his tenderness and sweetness, was the Cardinal's prime favourite. \"We were at the concert,\" Mrs. Newman writes to him at school, \"and fascinated with the Dutchman\" (the name he had given to Beethoven to tease his music-master because of the _van_ to his name), \"and thought of you and your musical party frequently.\"[26] \"They tell me,\" he said in May, 1876, on occasion of hearing at the Latin Play, the _scherzo_ and _finale_ of the Second Symphony, \"that these first two symphonies of Beethoven are not in his style; to me they are Beethoven all over. There is no mistaking that _scherzo_.\" And again in October, 1877, after a rendering of the _allegretto_ of the Eighth Symphony, on our observing that it was like the giant at play, he said: \"It is curious you should say that. I used to call him the gigantic nightingale. He is like a great bird singing. My sister remembers my using the expression long ago.\" And although he betrayed a little doubt as to Beethoven's tone being essentially religious, he was unwilling to hear anything said against him."]]]
