And within these long sheds, each seated behind a screen, were women who handled and cut deadly cordite into needful lengths as if it had been so much ribbon, and always and everywhere the same dexterous speed.  He led me, this soft-voiced, keen-eyed works-manager, through well-fitted wards and dispensaries, redolent of clean, druggy smells and the pervading odour of iodoform; he ushered me through dining halls long and wide and lofty and lighted by many windows, where countless dinners were served at a trifling cost per head; and so at last out upon a pleasant green, beyond which rose the great gates where stood the cars that were to bear my companions and myself upon our way.  \"They seem to work very hard!\" said I, turning to glance back whence we had come, \"they seem very much in earnest.\"  \"Yes,\" said my companion, \"every week we are turning out--\" here he named very many millions--\"of cartridges.\"  \"To be sure they are earning good money!\" said I thoughtfully.  \"More than many of them ever dreamed of earning,\" answered the works-manager. \"And yet--I don't know, but I don't think it is altogether the money, somehow.\"  \"I'm glad to hear you say that--very glad!\" said I, \"because it is a great thing to feel that they are working for the Britain that is, and is to be.\"     III  RIFLES AND LEWIS GUNS   A drive through a stately street where were shops which might rival Bond Street, the Rue de la Paix, or Fifth Avenue for the richness and variety of their contents; a street whose pavements were thronged with well-dressed pedestrians and whose roadway was filled with motor cars--vehicles, these, scornful of the petrol tax and such-like mundane and vulgar restrictions--in fine, the street of a rich and thriving city.  But suddenly the stately thoroughfare had given place to a meaner street, its princely shops had degenerated into blank walls or grimy yards, on either hand rose tall chimney stacks belching smoke; instead of dashing motor cars, heavy wains and cumbrous wagons jogged by; in place of the well-dressed throng were figures rough-clad and grimy that hurried along the narrow sidewalks--but these rough-clad people walked fast and purposefully. So we hummed along streets wide or narrow but always grimy, until we were halted at a tall barrier by divers policemen, who, having inspected our credentials, permitted us to pass on to the factory, or series of factories, that stretched themselves before us, building on building--block on block--a very town.  Here we were introduced to various managers and heads of departments, among whom was one in the uniform of a Captain of Engineers, under whose capable wing I had the good fortune to come, for he, it seemed, had lived among engines and machinery, had thought out and contrived lethal weapons from his youth up, and therewith retained so kindly and genial a personality as drew me irresistibly. Wherefore I gave myself to his guidance, and he, chatting of books and literature and the like trivialities, led me along corridors and passage-ways to see the wonder of the guns. And as we went, in the air about us was a stir, a hum that grew and ever grew, until, passing a massive swing door, there burst upon us a rumble, a roar, a clashing din.  We stood in a place of gloom lit by many fires, a vast place whose roof was hid by blue vapour; all about us rose the dim forms of huge stamps, whose thunderous stroke beat out a deep diapason to the ring of countless hand-hammers. And, lighted by the sudden glare of furnace fires were figures, bare-armed, smoke-grimed, wild of aspect, figures that whirled heavy sledges or worked the levers of the giant steam-hammers, while here and there bars of iron new-glowing from the furnace winked and twinkled in the gloom where those wild, half-naked men-shapes flitted to and fro unheard amid the thunderous din. Awed and half stunned, I stood viewing that never-to-be-forgotten scene until I grew aware that the Captain was roaring in my ear.  \"Forge ... rifle barrels ... come and see and mind where you tread!\"  Treading as seemingly silent as those wild human shapes, that straightened brawny backs to view me as I passed, that grinned in the fire-glow and spoke one to another, words lost to my stunned hearing, ere they bent to their labour again, obediently I followed the Captain's dim form until I was come where, bare-armed, leathern-aproned and be-spectacled, stood one who seemed of some account among these salamanders, who, nodding to certain words addressed to him by the Captain, seized a pair of tongs, swung open a furnace door, and plucking thence a glowing brand, whirled it with practised ease, and setting it upon the dies beneath a huge steam-hammer, nodded his head. Instantly that mighty engine fell to work, thumping and banging with mighty strokes, and with each stroke that glowing steel bar changed and changed, grew round, grew thin, hunched a shoulder here, showed a flat there, until, lo! before my eyes was the shape of a rifle minus the stock! Hereupon the be-spectacled salamander nodded again, the giant hammer became immediately immobile, the glowing forging was set among hundreds of others and a voice roared in my ear:  \"Two minutes ... this way.\"  A door opens, closes, and we are in sunshine again, and the Captain is smilingly reminiscent of books.  \"This is greater than books,\" said I.  \"Why, that depends,\" says he, \"there are books and books ... this way!\"  Up a flight of stairs, through a doorway, and I am in a shop where huge machines grow small in perspective. And here I see the rough forging pass through the many stages of trimming, milling, turning, boring, rifling until comes the assembling, and I take up the finished rifle ready for its final process--testing. So downstairs we go to the testing sheds, wherefrom as we approach comes the sound of dire battle, continuous reports, now in volleys, now in single sniping shots, or in rapid succession.  Inside, I breathe an air charged with burnt powder and behold in a long row, many rifles mounted upon crutches, their muzzles levelled at so many targets. Beside each rifle stand two men, one to sight and correct, and one to fire and watch the effect of the shot by means of a telescope fixed to hand.  With the nearest of these men I incontinent fell into talk--a chatty fellow this, who, busied with pliers adjusting the back-sight of a rifle, talked to me of lines of sight and angles of deflection, his remarks sharply punctuated by rifle-shots, that came now slowly, now in twos and threes and now in rapid volleys.  \"Yes, sir,\" said he, busy pliers never still, \"guns and rifles is very like us--you and me, say. Some is just naturally good and some is worse than bad--load up, George! A new rifle's like a kid--pretty sure to fire a bit wide at first--not being used to it--we was all kids once, sir, remember! But a bit of correction here an' there'll put that right as a rule. On the other hand there's rifles as Old Nick himself nor nobody else could make shoot straight--ready, George? And it's just the same with kids! Now, if you'll stick your eyes to that glass, and watch the target, you'll see how near she'll come this time--all right, George!\" As he speaks the rifle speaks also, and observing the hit on the target, I sing out:  \"Three o'clock!\"  Ensues more work with the pliers; George loads and fires and with one eye still at the telescope I give him:  \"Five o'clock!\"  Another moment of adjusting, again the rifle cracks and this time I announce:  \"A bull!\"  Hereupon my companion squints through the glass and nods: \"Right-oh, George!\" says he, then, while George the silent stacks the tested rifle with many others, he turns to me and nods, \"Got 'im that time, sir--pity it weren't a bloomin' Hun!\"  Here the patient Captain suggests we had better go, and unwillingly I follow him out into the open and the sounds of battle die away behind us.  And now, as we walked, I learned some particulars of that terrible device the Lewis gun; how that it could spout bullets at the rate of six hundred per minute; how, by varying pressures of the trigger, it could be fired by single rounds or pour forth its entire magazine in a continuous, shattering volley and how it weighed no more than twenty-six pounds.  \"And here,\" said the Captain, opening a door and speaking in his pleasant voice, much as though he were showing me some rare flowers, \"here is where they grow by the hundred, every week.\"  And truly in hundreds they were, long rows of them standing very neatly in racks, their walnut stocks heel by heel, their grim, blue muzzles in long, serried ranks, very orderly and precise; and something in their very orderliness endowed them with a certain individuality as it were. It almost seemed to me that they were waiting, mustered and ready, for that hour of ferocious roar and tumult when their voice should be the voice of swift and terrible death. Now as I gazed upon them, filled with these scarcely definable thoughts, I was startled by a sudden shattering crash near by, a sound made up of many individual reports, and swinging about, I espied a man seated upon a stool; a plump, middle-aged, family sort of man, who sat upon his low stool, his aproned knees set wide, as plump, middle-aged family men often do. As I watched, Paterfamilias squinted along the sights of one of these guns and once again came that shivering crash that is like nothing else I ever heard. Him I approached and humbly ventured an awed question or so, whereon he graciously beckoned me nearer, vacated his stool, and motioning me to sit there, suggested I might try a shot at the target, a far disc lighted by shaded electric bulbs.  \"She's fixed dead on!\" he said, "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27866"],["title","Great Britain at War (#2)"],["body","\"and she's true--you can't miss. A quick pull for single shots and a steady pressure for a volley.\"  Hereupon I pressed the trigger, the gun stirred gently in its clamps, the air throbbed, and a stream of ten bullets (the testing number) plunged into the bull's-eye and all in the space of a moment.  \"There ain't a un'oly 'un of 'em all could say 'Hoch the Kaiser' with them in his stomach,\" said Paterfamilias thoughtfully, laying a hand upon the respectable stomach beneath his apron, \"it's a gun, that is!\" And a gun it most assuredly is.  I would have tarried longer with Paterfamilias, for in his own way, he was as arresting as this terrible weapon--or nearly so--but the Captain, gentle-voiced and serene as ever, suggested that my companions had a train to catch, wherefore I reluctantly turned away. But as I went, needs must I glance back at Paterfamilias, as comfortable as ever where he sat, but with pudgy fingers on trigger grimly at work again, and from him to the long, orderly rows of guns mustered in their orderly ranks, awaiting their hour.  We walked through shops where belts and pulleys and wheels and cogs flapped and whirled and ground in ceaseless concert, shops where files rasped and hammers rang, shops again where all seemed riot and confusion at the first glance, but at a second showed itself ordered confusion, as it were. And as we went, my Captain spoke of the hospital bay, of wards and dispensary (lately enlarged), of sister and nurses and the grand work they were doing among the employees other than attending to their bodily ills; and talking thus, he brought me to the place, a place of exquisite order and tidiness, yet where nurses, blue-uniformed, in their white caps, cuffs and aprons, seemed to me the neatest of all. And here I was introduced to Sister, capable, strong, gentle-eyed, who told me something of her work--how many came to her with wounds of soul as well as body; of griefs endured and wrongs suffered by reason of pitiful lack of knowledge; of how she was teaching them care and cleanliness of minds as well as bodies, which is surely the most blessed heritage the unborn generations may inherit. She told me of the patient bravery of the women, the chivalry of grimy men, whose hurts may wait that others may be treated first. So she talked and I listened until, perceiving the Captain somewhat ostentatiously consulting his watch, I presently left that quiet haven with its soft-treading ministering attendants.  So we had tea and cigarettes, and when I eventually shook hands with my Captain, I felt that I was parting with a friend.  \"And what struck you most particularly this afternoon?\" enquired one of my companions.  \"Well,\" said I, \"it was either the Lewis gun or Paterfamilias the grim.\"     IV  CLYDEBANK   Henceforth the word \"Clydebank\" will be associated in my mind with the ceaseless ring and din of riveting-hammers, where, day by day, hour by hour, a new fleet is growing, destroyers and torpedo boats alongside monstrous submarines--yonder looms the grim bulk of Super-dreadnought or battle cruiser or the slender shape of some huge liner.  And with these vast shapes about me, what wonder that I stood awed and silent at the stupendous sight. But, to my companion, a shortish, thick-set man, with a masterful air and a bowler hat very much over one eye, these marvels were an everyday affair; and now, ducking under a steel hawser, he led me on, dodging moving trucks, stepping unconcernedly across the buffers of puffing engines, past titanic cranes that swung giant arms high in the air; on we went, stepping over chain cables, wire ropes, pulley-blocks and a thousand and one other obstructions, on which I stumbled occasionally since my awed gaze was turned upwards. And as we walked amid these awesome shapes, he talked, I remember, of such futile things as--books.  I beheld great ships well-nigh ready for launching; I stared up at huge structures towering aloft, a wild complexity of steel joists and girders, yet, in whose seeming confusion, the eye could detect something of the mighty shape of the leviathan that was to be; even as I looked, six feet or so of steel plating swung through the air, sank into place, and immediately I was deafened by the hellish racket of the riveting-hammers.  \"... nothing like a good book and a pipe to go with it!\" said my companion between two bursts of hammering.  \"This is a huge ship!\" said I, staring upward still.  \"H'm--fairish!\" nodded my companion, scratching his square jaw and letting his knowledgeful eyes rove to and fro over the vast bulk that loomed above us.  \"Have you built them much bigger, then?\" I enquired.  My companion nodded and proceeded to tell me certain amazing facts which the riotous riveting-hammers promptly censored in the following remarkable fashion.  \"You should have seen the rat-tat-tat. We built her in exactly nineteen months instead of two years and a half! Biggest battleship afloat--two hundred feet longer than the rat-tat-tat--launched her last rat-tat-tat--gone to rat-tat-tat-tat for her guns.\"  \"What size guns?\" I shouted above the hammers.  \"Rat-tat-tat-tat-tat-inch!\" he said, smiling grimly.  \"How much?\" I yelled.  \"She has four rat-tat-tat-tat inch and twelve rattle-tattle inch besides rat-tat-tat-tat!\" he answered, nodding.  \"Really!\" I roared, \"if those guns are half as big as I think, the Germans--\"  \"The Germans--!\" said he, and blew his nose.  \"How long did you say she was?\" I hastened to ask as the hammers died down a little.  \"Well, over all she measured exactly rat-tat feet. She was so big that we had to pull down a corner of the building there, as you can see.\"  \"And what's her name?\"  \"The rat-tat-tat, and she's the rattle-tattle of her class.\"  \"Are these hammers always quite so noisy, do you suppose?\" I enquired, a little hopelessly.  \"Oh, off and on!\" he nodded. \"Kick up a bit of a racket, don't they, but you get used to it in time; I could hear a pin drop. Look! since we've stood here they've got four more plates fixed--there goes the fifth. This way!\"  Past the towering bows of future battleships he led me, over and under more steel cables, until he paused to point towards an empty slip near by.  \"That's where we built the _Lusitania_!\" said he. \"We thought she was pretty big then--but now--!\" he settled his hat a little further over one eye with a knock on the crown.  \"Poor old _Lusitania_!\" said I, \"she'll never be forgotten.\"  \"Not while ships sail!\" he answered, squaring his square jaw, \"no, she'll never be forgotten, nor the murderers who ended her!\"  \"And they've struck a medal in commemoration,\" said I.  \"Medal!\" said he, and blew his nose louder than before. \"I fancy they'll wish they could swallow that damn medal, one day. Poor old _Lusitania_! You lose any one aboard?\"  \"I had some American friends aboard, but they escaped, thank God--others weren't so fortunate.\"  \"No,\" he answered, turning away, \"but America got quite angry--wrote a note, remember? Over there's one of the latest submarines. Germany can't touch her for speed and size, and better than that, she's got rat-tat--\"  \"I beg pardon?\" I wailed, for the hammers were riotous again, \"what has she?\"  \"She's got rat-tat forward and rat-tat aft, surface speed rat-tat-tat knots, submerged rat-tat-tat, and then best of all she's rattle-tattle-tattle. Yes, hammers are a bit noisy! This way. A destroyer yonder--new class--rat-tat feet longer than ordinary. We expect her to do rat-tat-tat knots and she'll mount rat-tat guns. There are two of them in the basin yonder having their engines fitted, turbines to give rat-tat-tat horse power. But come on, we'd better be going or we shall lose the others of your party.\"  \"I should like to stay here a week,\" said I, tripping over a steel hawser.  \"Say a month,\" he added, steadying me deftly. \"You might begin to see all we've been doing in a month. We've built twenty-nine ships of different classes since the war began in this one yard, and we're going on building till the war's over--and after that too. And this place is only one of many. Which reminds me you're to go to another yard this afternoon--we'd better hurry after the rest of your party or they'll be waiting for you.\"  \"I'm afraid they generally are!\" I sighed, as I turned and followed my conductor through yawning doorways (built to admit a giant, it seemed) into vast workshops whose lofty roofs were lost in haze. Here I saw huge turbines and engines of monstrous shape in course of construction; I beheld mighty propellers, with boilers and furnaces big as houses, whose proportions were eloquent of the colossal ships that were to be. But here indeed, all things were on a gigantic scale; ponderous lathes were turning, mighty planing machines swung unceasing back and forth, while other monsters bored and cut through steel plate as it had been so much cardboard.  \"Good machines, these!\" said my companion, patting one of these monsters with familiar hand, \"all made in Britain!\"  \"Like the men!\" I suggested.  \"The men,\" said he. \"Humph! They haven't been giving much trouble lately--touch wood!\"  \"Perhaps they know Britain just now needs every man that is a man,\" I suggested, \"and some one has said that a man can fight as hard at home here with a hammer as in France with a rifle.\"  \"Well, there's a lot of fighting going on here,\" nodded my companion, \"we're fighting night and day and we're fighting damned hard. And now we'd better hurry; your party will be cursing you in chorus.\"  \"I'm afraid it has before now!\" said I.  So we hurried on, past shops whence came the roar of machinery, past great basins wherein floated destroyers and torpedo boats, past craft of many kinds and fashions, ships built and building; on I hastened, tripping over more cables, dodging from the buffers of snorting engines and deafened again by the fearsome din of the riveting-hammers, until I found my travelling companions assembled and ready to depart.
