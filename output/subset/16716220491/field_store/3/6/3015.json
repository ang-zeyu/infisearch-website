It will also be convenient to include Kashmír and the tribal territory beyond the frontier of British India which is politically controlled from Pesháwar. The whole tract covers ten degrees of latitude and eleven of longitude. The furthest point of the Kashmír frontier is in 37° 2' N., which is much the same as the latitude of Syracuse. In the south-east the Panjáb ends at 27° 4' N., corresponding roughly to the position of the southernmost of the Canary Islands. Lines drawn west from Pesháwar and Lahore would pass to the north of Beirut and Jerusalem respectively. Multán and Cairo are in the same latitude, and so are Delhi and Teneriffe. Kashmír stretches eastwards to longitude 80° 3' and the westernmost part of Wazíristán is in 69° 2' E.  ~Distribution of Area.~--The area dealt with is roughly 253,000 square miles. This is but two-thirteenths of the area of the Indian Empire, and yet it is less by only 10,000 square miles than that of Austria-Hungary including Bosnia and Herzegovina. The area consists of:                                                                sq. miles    (1) The Panjáb                                                 97,000   (2) Native States dependent on Panjáb Government               36,500   (3) Kashmír                                                    81,000   (4) North West Frontier Province                               13,000   (5) Tribal territory under the political control of the Chief   Commissioner of North West Frontier Province, roughly          25,500  Approximately 136,000 square miles may be classed as highlands and 117,000 as plains, and these may be distributed as follows over the above divisions:                                                    Highlands   Plains                                                   sq. miles   sq. miles    (1) Panjáb, British                                11,000   86,000   (2) Panjáb, Native States                          12,000   24,500   (3) Kashmír                                        81,000     --   (4) North West Frontier Province                    6,500    6,500   (5) Tribal Territory                               25,500     --  On the north the highlands include the Himalayan and sub-Himalayan (Siwálik) tracts to the south and east of the Indus, and north of that river the Muztagh-Karakoram range and the bleak salt plateau beyond that range reaching almost up to the Kuenlun mountains. To the west of the Indus they include those spurs of the Hindu Kush which run into Chitrál and Dir, the Buner and Swát hills, the Safed Koh, the Wazíristán hills, the Sulimán range, and the low hills in the trans-Indus districts of the North West Frontier Province.  ~Boundary with China.~--There is a point to the north of Hunza in Kashmír where three great mountain chains, the Muztagh from the south-east, the Hindu Kush from the south-west, and the Sarikol (an offshoot of the Kuenlun) from the north-east, meet. It is also the meeting-place of the Indian, Chinese, and Russian empires and of Afghánistán. Westwards from this the boundary of Kashmír and Chinese Turkestán runs for 350 miles (omitting curves) through a desolate upland lying well to the north of the Muztagh-Karakoram range. Finally in the north-east corner of Kashmír the frontier impinges on the great Central Asian axis of the Kuenlun. From this point it turns southwards and separates Chinese Tibet from the salt Lingzi Thang plains and the Indus valley in Kashmír, and the eastern part of the native state of Bashahr, which physically form a portion of Tibet.  ~Boundary with United Provinces.~--The south-east corner of Bashahr is a little to the north of the great Kedárnáth peak in the Central Himálaya and of the source of the Jamna. Here the frontier strikes to the west dividing Bashahr from Teri Garhwál, a native state under the control of the government of the United Provinces. Turning again to the south it runs to the junction of the Tons and Jamna, separating Teri Garhwál from Sirmúr and some of the smaller Simla Hill States. Henceforth the Jamna is with small exceptions the boundary between the Panjáb and the United Provinces.  ~Boundary with Afghánistán.~--We must now return to our starting-point at the eastern extremity of the Hindu Kush, and trace the boundary with Afghánistán. The frontier runs west and south-west along the Hindu Kush to the Dorah pass dividing Chitrál from the Afghán province of Wakhan, and streams which drain into the Indus from the head waters of the Oxus. At the Dorah pass it turns sharply to the south, following a great spur which parts the valley of the Chitrál river (British) from that of its Afghán affluent, the Bashgol. Below the junction of the two streams at Arnawai the Chitrál changes its name and becomes the Kunar. Near this point the \"Durand\" line begins. In 1893 an agreement was made between the Amir Abdurrahman and Sir Mortimer Durand as representative of the British Government determining the frontier line from Chandak in the valley of the Kunar, twelve miles north of Asmar, to the Persian border. Asmar is an Afghán village on the left bank of the Kunar to the south of Arnawai. In 1894 the line was demarcated along the eastern watershed of the Kunar valley to Nawakotal on the confines of Bajaur and the country of the Mohmands.  Thence the frontier, which has not been demarcated, passes through the heart of the Mohmand country to the Kábul river and beyond it to our frontier post in the Khaibar at Landikhána.  From this point the line, still undemarcated, runs on in a south-westerly direction to the Safed Koh, and then strikes west along it to the Sikarám mountain near the Paiwar Kotal at the head of the Kurram valley. From Sikarám the frontier runs south and south-east crossing the upper waters of the Kurram, and dividing our possessions from the Afghán province of Khost. This line was demarcated in 1894.  At the south of the Kurram valley the frontier sweeps round to the west leaving in the British sphere the valley of the Tochí. Turning again to the south it crosses the upper waters of the Tochí and passes round the back of Wazíristán by the Shawal valley and the plains about Wána to Domandí on the Gomal river, where Afghánistán, Biluchistán, and the North West Frontier Province meet. The Wazíristán boundary was demarcated in 1895.  ~Political and Administrative Boundaries.~--The boundary described above defines spheres of influence, and only in the Kurram valley does it coincide with that of the districts for whose orderly administration we hold ourselves responsible. All we ask of Wazírs, Afrídís, or Mohmands is to leave our people at peace; we have no concern with their quarrels or blood feuds, so long as they abide in their mountains or only leave them for the sake of lawful gain. Our administrative boundary, which speaking broadly we took over from the Sikhs, usually runs at the foot of the hills. A glance at the map will show that between Pesháwar and Kohát the territory of the independent tribes comes down almost to the Indus. At this point the hills occupied by the Jowákí section of the Afrídí tribe push out a great tongue eastwards. Our military frontier road runs through these hills, and we actually pay the tribesmen of the Kohát pass for our right of way. Another tongue of tribal territory reaches right down to the Indus, and almost severs the Pesháwar and Hazára districts. Further north the frontier of Hazára lies well to the east of the Indus.  ~Frontier with Biluchistán.~--At Domandí the frontier turns to the east, and following the Gomal river to its junction with the Zhob at Kajúrí Kach forms the boundary of the two British administrations. Henceforth the general direction of the line is determined by the trend of the Sulimán range. It runs south to the Vehoa pass, where the country of the Patháns of the North West Frontier Province ends and that of the Hill and Plain Biluches subject to the Panjáb Government begins. From the Vehoa pass to the Kahá torrent the line is drawn so as to leave Biluch tribes with the Panjáb and Pathán tribes with the Biluchistán Agency. South of the Kahá the division is between Biluch tribes, the Marrís and Bugtís to the west being managed from Quetta, and the Gurchánís and Mazárís, who are largely settled in the plains, being included in Dera Gházi Khán, the trans-Indus district of the Panjáb. At the south-west corner of the Dera Ghází Khán district the Panjáb, Sind, and Biluchistán meet. From this point the short common boundary of the Panjáb and Sind runs east to the Indus.  ~The Southern Boundary.~--East of the Indus the frontier runs south-east for about fifty miles parting Sind from the Baháwalpur State, till a point is reached where Sind, Rájputána, and Baháwalpur join. A little further to the east is the southern extremity of Baháwalpur at 70° 8' E. and 27° 5' N. From this point a line drawn due east would at a distance of 370 miles pass a few miles to the north of the south end of Gurgaon and a few miles to the south of the border of the Narnaul tract of Patiála. Between Narnaul and the south-east corner of the Baháwalpur State the great Rájputána desert, mainly occupied in this quarter by Bikaner, thrusts northwards a huge wedge reaching almost up to the Sutlej. To the west of the wedge is Baháwalpur and to the east the British district of Hissár. The apex is less than 100 miles from Lahore, while a line drawn due south from that city to latitude 27'5° north would exceed 270 miles in length. The Jaipur State lies to the south and west of Narnaul, while Gurgaon has across its southern frontiers Alwar and"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24567"],["title","Blind Man's Lantern (#1)"],["body","said. \"_By the word of the Lord were the heavens made; and the host of them by the breath of His mouth._\" He kissed her. \"I welcome you to our new homeland, wife,\" he said.  Behind them Wutzchen--\"piglet\"--grunted. Martha smiled back at the giant porker, perched amongst the cases and bags and household goods like the victim of some bawdy chiavari. \"I've never heard a pig mutter so,\" she said.  \"If he knew that his business here was to flatter the local lady-pigs with farrow, Wutzchen would hop out and run,\" Aaron said.  \"_Dummel dich_, Stoltz,\" Martha said. \"I've got to make your supper yet, and we don't have so much as a stove lit in our tent.\"  Stoltzfoos slapped the team back into motion. \"What we need for our journey home are a few of the _altie lieder_,\" he said, reaching back in the wagon for his scarred guitar. He strummed and hummed, then began singing in his clear baritone: \"_In da guut alt Suumer-zeit_ ...  \"... _In da guut alt Suumer-zeit_,\" Martha's voice joined him. As they jolted along the path through the pine trees, heading toward Datura-village, near which their homestead stood, they sang the other homey songs to the music of the old guitar. \"_Drawk Mich Zrick zu Alt Virginye_,\" nostalgic for the black-garbed Plain-Folk left at home. Then Aaron's fingers danced a livelier tune on the strings: \"_Ich fang 'n neie Fashun aw_,\" he crowed, and Martha joined in:  \"A new fashion I'll begin,\" they sang,  \"The hay I'll cut in the winter;  \"When the sun-heat beats, I'll loaf in the shade.  \"And feast on cherry-pie.  \"I'll get us a white, smearkase cow,  \"And a yard full of guinea-hen geese;  \"A red-beet tree as high as the moon,  \"And a patent-leather fence.  \"The chickens I'll keep in the kitchen,\" they sang; whereupon Martha broke down laughing.  \"It's a new world, and for now a cold world; but it's God's world, with home just up ahead,\" Aaron shouted. He pulled the wagon up next to the arctic tent that was to be their temporary farmhouse, beside the wagon loads of provision he'd brought before. He jumped down and swung Martha to earth. \"Light the stove, woman; make your little kitchen bright, while I make our beasts feel welcome.\"  The Amishwoman pushed aside the entrance flap of the tent. Enclosed was a circle some twelve feet wide. The floor was bare earth. Once warmed by the pump-up \"naptha\" lantern and the gasoline hotplate, it would become a bog. Martha went out to the wagon to get a hatchet and set out for the nearby spinny of pines to trim off some twigs. Old Order manner forbid decorative floor-coverings as improper worldly show; but a springy carpet of pine-twigs could be considered as no more than a wooden floor, keeping two Plain Folk from sinking to their knees in mud.  The pots were soon boiling atop the two-burner stove, steaming the tent's air with onion-tangy _tzvivvele Supp_ and the savory pork-smell of _Schnitz un Knepp_, a cannibal odor that disturbed not a bit Wutzchen, snoring behind the cookstove. Chickens, penned beneath the bed, chuckled in their bedtime caucus. The cow stood cheek-by-jowl with Yonnie, warming him with platonic graciousness as they shared the hay Aaron had spread before them. Martha stirred her soup. \"When the bishop married me to you,\" she told Aaron, \"he said naught of my having to sleep with a pig.\"  \"Ah, but I thought you knew that to be the purpose of Christian marriage, woman,\" Aaron said, standing close.  \"It's Wutz I mean,\" she said. \"Truly, I mind not a bit living as in one of those automobile-wagons, since it's with you, and only for a little while.\"  \"I'll hire a crew of our neighbors to help with the barn tomorrow,\" Aaron said. \"That done, you'll have but one pig to sleep with.\"  After grace, they sat on cases of tobacco to eat their meal from a table of feed sacks covered with oilcloth. \"The man in the ship's little kitchen let me make and freeze pies, Stoltz,\" Martha said. \"He said we'd have a deepfreeze big as all outdoors, without electric, so use it. Eat till it's all, _Maan_; there's more back.\"  Yonnie bumped against Aaron's eating-elbow. \"No man and his wife have eaten in such a zoo since Noah and his wife left the ark,\" Aaron said. He cut a slice of Schnitz-pie and palmed it against the bull's big snout to be snuffled up. \"He likes your cooking,\" he said.  \"So wash his face,\" Martha told him.         *       *       *       *       *  Outside the tent there was a clatter of horse-iron on frozen ground. \"What the die-hinker is that?\" Aaron demanded. He stood and picked up the naphtha lantern.  Outside, Aaron saw a tall black stranger, astride a horse as pale as the little Murnan moons that lighted him. \"_Rankeshi dade!_\" the visitor bellowed.  \"May your life be a long one!\" Aaron Stoltzfoos repeated in Hausa. Observing that his caller was brandishing a clenched fist, the Amishman observed the same ambiguous courtesy. \"If you will enter, O Welcome Stranger, my house will be honored.\"  [Illustration]  \"Mother bless thee, Bearded One,\" the Murnan said. He dismounted, tossing his reins to one of the four retainers who remained on horseback. He entered the tent after Aaron; and stared about him at the animals, letting his dark eyes flick across Martha's unveiled face. At the Amishman's invitation, the visitor sat himself on a tobacco case, revealing as he crossed his legs elaborately embroidered trousers and boot tops worked with designs that would dazzle a Texan. Martha bustled about hiding the remains of their meal.  The Murnan's outer dress was a woolen _riga_, the neckless gown of his West-African forefathers, with a blanket draped about his shoulders, exactly as those ancestors had worn one in the season of the cold wind called harmattan. Aaron introduced himself as Haruna, the Hausa version of his name; and the guest made himself known as Sarki--Chief--of the village of Datura. His given name was Kazunzumi. Wutzchen snuffled in his sleep. The Sarki glanced at the huge pig and smiled. Aaron relaxed a bit. The Islamic interdict on swine had been shed by the Murnans when they'd become apostates, just as Colonial Survey had guessed.  Stoltzfoos' Hausa, learned at the Homestead School at Georgetown University, proved adequate to its first challenge in the field, though he discovered, with every experimenter in a new language, that his most useful phrase was _magana sanoo-sanoo_: \"please speak slowly.\" Aaron let the Chief commence the desultory conversation that would precede talk of consequence. Martha, ignored by the men, sat on the edge of the bed, reading the big German-language Bible. Aaron and Kazunzumi sang on in the heathen tongue about weather, beasts, and field-crops.  The Sarki leaned forward to examine Aaron's beard and shaven upper lip, once; and smiled. The Murnan does not wear such. He looked at Martha more casually now, seeing that the husband was not disgraced by his wife's naked face; and remarked on the whiteness of her skin in the same tones he'd mentioned Wutzchen's remarkable girth.  Aaron asked when the snows would cease, when the earth would thaw. The Sarki told him, and said that the land here was as rich as manure. Gradually the talk worked round to problems involving carpenters, nails, lumber, hinges--and money. Aaron was pleased to discover that the natives thought nothing of digging a cellar and raising a barn in midwinter, and that workers could be easily hired.  Suddenly Sarki Kazunzumi stood and slapped his palms together. The tent flap was shoved open. Bowed servants, who'd shivered outside for over an hour, placed their master's presents on the sack table, on the twig floor, even beside Martha on the bed. There were iron knives, a roast kid, a basket of peanuts, a sack of roasted coffee beans, a string of dried fruit, and a tiny earthware flask of perfume. There was even a woolen riga for Aaron, black, suggesting that the Survey had said a bit to the natives about Amish custom; and there were bolts of bright-patterned cloth too worldly for aught but quilts and infant-dresses, brightening Martha's eyes.  Aaron stood to accept the guest gifts with elaborate thanks. Sarki Kazunzumi as elaborately bemeaned his offerings. \"Musa the carpenter will appear on tomorrow's tomorrow,\" he said. \"You will, the Mother willing, visit me in Datura tomorrow. We will together purchase lumber worthy of my friend-neighbor's barn-making. May the Mother give you strength to farm, Haruna! May the Mother grant you the light of understanding!\"  \"_Sannu, sannu!_\" Stoltzfoos responded. He stood at the door of his tent, holding his lantern high to watch the Sarki and his servants ride off into the darkness.         *       *       *       *       *  \"_Er iss en groesie Fisch, nee?_\" Martha asked.  \"The biggest fish in these parts,\" Aaron agreed. \"Did you understand our talk?\"  \"The heathen speech is hard for me to learn, Stoltz,\" Martha admitted, speaking in the dialect they'd both been reared to. \"While you had only the alien speech to study, I spent my time learning to grow the buglets and tell the various sorts apart. Besides, _unser guutie Deitschie Schproech, asz unser Erlayser schwetzt, iss guut genunk fa mier_.\" (Our honest German tongue, that our Saviour spoke, is good enough for me).  Aaron laughed. \"So _altfashuned_ a _Maedel_ I married,\" he said. \"Woman, you must learn the Hausa, too. We must be friends to these _Schwotzers_, as we were friends with the English-speakers back in the United Schtayts.\" He pushed aside the bolt of Murnan cloth to sit beside his wife, and leafed through the pages of their _Familien-Bibel_, pages lovingly worn by his father's fingers, and his grandfather's. \"Listen,\" he commanded:  \"_For the Lord thy God bringeth thee into a good land, a land of brooks of water, of fountains and depths that spring out of valleys and hills; a land of wheat, and barley, and vines, and fig trees, and pomegranates; a land of oil olive, and honey; a land wherein thou shalt eat bread without scarceness, thou shalt not "]]]
