His face was pale and his voice shaky.  \"Mean? Well, Mother, it just means that I've been stealing Mr. Walters's trout all summer--_stealing_ them. That's what it means.\"  \"Oh, Danny! But you didn't know.\"  \"No, but I ought to have remembered that he was the new owner, and have asked him. I never thought. Mother, what does 'prosecuted according to law' mean?\"  \"I don't know, I'm sure, Danny. But if this is so, there's only one thing to be done. You must go straight to Mr. Walters and tell him all about it.\"  \"Mother, I don't dare to. He is a dreadfully hard man. Sam French's father says--\"  \"I wouldn't believe a word Sam French's father says about Mr. Walters!\" said Mrs. Phillips firmly. \"He's got a spite against him because he was dismissed. Besides, Danny, it's the only right thing to do. You know that. We're poor, but we have never done anything underhand yet.\"  \"Yes, Mother, I know,\" said Dan, gulping his fear bravely down. \"I'll go, of course, right after dinner. I was only scared at first. I'll tell you what I'll do. I'll clean these trout nicely and take them to Mr. Walters, and tell him that, if he'll only give me time, I'll pay him back every cent of money I got for all I sold this summer. Then maybe he'll let me off, seeing as I didn't know about the notice.\"  \"I'll go with you, Danny.\"  \"No, I'll go alone, Mother. You needn't go with me,\" said Dan heroically. To himself he said that his mother had troubles enough. He would never subject her to the added ordeal of an interview with the stern factory owner. He would beard the lion in his den himself, if it had to be done.  \"Don't tell Ella May anything about it. It would worry her. And don't cry, Mother, I guess it'll be all right. Let me have my dinner now and I'll go straight off.\"  Dan ate his dinner rapidly; then he carefully cleaned his trout, put them in a long basket, with rhubarb leaves over them, and started with an assumed cheerfulness very far from his real feelings.  He had barely passed the gate when another boy came shuffling along--a tall, raw-boned lad, with an insinuating smile and shifty, cunning eyes. The newcomer nodded familiarly to Dan.  \"Hello, sonny. Going over to the Lake with your catch, are you? You'll fry up before you get there. There'll be nothing left of you but a crisp.\"  \"No, I'm not going to the Lake. I'm going up to the factory to see Mr. Walters.\"  Sam French gave a long whistle of surprise.  \"Why, Dan, what's taking you there? You surely ain't thinking of trying for that place, are you? Walters wouldn't look at you. Why, he wouldn't take _me_! You haven't the ghost of a chance.\"  \"No, I'm not going for that. Sam, did you know that Mr. Walters had a notice in the Lake _Advertiser_ that nobody could fish in his pond this summer?\"  \"Course I did--the old skinflint! He's too mean to live, that's what. He never goes near the pond himself. Regular dog in the manger, he is. Dad says--\"  \"Sam, why didn't you tell me about that notice?\"  \"Gracious, didn't you know? I s'posed everybody did, and here I've been taking you for the cutest chap this side of sunset--fishing away up in that creek where no one could see you, and cutting home through the woods on the sly. You don't mean to tell me you never saw that notice?\"  \"No, I didn't. Do you think I'd have gone near the pond if I had? I never saw it till today, and I'm going straight to Mr. Walters now to tell him about it.\"  Sam French stopped short in the dusty road and stared at Dan in undisguised amazement.  \"Dan Phillips,\" he ejaculated, \"have you plum gone out of your mind? Boy alive, you needn't be afraid that I'd peach on you. I'm too blamed glad to see anyone get the better of that old Walters, smart as he thinks himself. Gee! To dream of going to him and telling him you've been fishing in his pond! Why, he'll put you in jail. You don't know what sort of a man he is. Dad says--\"  \"Never mind what your dad says, Sam. My mind's made up.\"  \"Dan, you chump, listen to me. That notice says 'prosecuted according to law.' Why, Danny, he'll put you in prison, or fine you, or something dreadful.\"  \"I can't help it if he does,\" said Danny stoutly. \"You get out of here, Sam French, and don't be trying to scare me. I mean to be honest, and how can I be if I don't own up to Mr. Walters that I've been stealing his trout all summer?\"  \"Stealing, fiddlesticks! Dan, I used to think you were a chap with some sense, but I see I was mistaken. You ain't done no harm. Walters will never miss them trout. If you're so dreadful squeamish that you won't fish no more, why, you needn't. But just let the matter drop and hold your tongue about it. That's _my_ advice.\"  \"Well, it isn't my mother's, then. I mean to go by _hers_. You needn't argue no more, Sam. I'm going.\"  \"Go, then!\" said Sam, stopping short in disgust. \"You're a big fool, Dan, and serve you right if Walters lands you off to jail; but I don't wish you no ill. If I can do anything for your family after you're gone, I will, and I'll try and give your remains Christian burial--if there are any remains. So long, Danny! Give my love to old Walters!\"  Dan was not greatly encouraged by this interview. He shrank more than ever from the thought of facing the stern factory owner. His courage had almost evaporated when he entered the office at the factory and asked shakily for Mr. Walters.  \"He's in his office there,\" replied the clerk, \"but he's very busy. Better leave your message with me.\"  \"I must see Mr. Walters himself, please,\" said Dan firmly, but with inward trepidation.  The clerk swung himself impatiently from his stool and ushered Dan into Mr. Walters's private office.  \"Boy to see you, sir,\" he said briefly, as he closed the ground-glass door behind him.  Dan, dizzy and trembling, stood in the dreaded presence. Mr. Walters was writing at a table covered with a businesslike litter of papers. He laid down his pen and looked up with a frown as the clerk vanished. He was a stern-looking man with deep-set grey eyes and a square, clean-shaven chin. There was not an ounce of superfluous flesh on his frame, and his voice and manner were those of the decided, resolute, masterful man of business.  He pointed to a capacious leather chair and said concisely, \"What is your business with me, boy?\"  Dan had carefully thought out a statement of facts beforehand, but every word had vanished from his memory. He had only a confused, desperate consciousness that he had a theft to confess and that it must be done as soon as possible. He did not sit down.  \"Please, Mr. Walters,\" he began desperately, \"I came to tell you--your notice--I never saw it before--and I've been fishing on your pond all summer--but I didn't know--honest--I've brought you all I caught today--and I'll pay back for them all--some time.\"  An amused, puzzled expression crossed Mr. Walters's noncommittal face. He pushed the leather chair forward.  \"Sit down, my boy,\" he said kindly. \"I don't quite understand this somewhat mixed-up statement of yours. You've been fishing on my pond, you say. Didn't you see my notice in the _Advertiser_?\"  Dan sat down more composedly. The revelation was over and he was still alive.  \"No, sir. We hardly ever see an _Advertiser_, and nobody told me. I'd always been used to fishing there, and I never thought but what it was all right to keep on. I know I ought to have remembered and asked you, but truly, sir, I didn't mean to steal your fish. I used to sell them over at the hotels. We saw the notice today, Mother and me, and I came right up. I've brought you the trout I caught this morning, and--if only you won't prosecute me, sir, I'll pay back every cent I got for the others--every cent, sir--if you'll give me time.\"  Mr. Walters passed his hand across his mouth to conceal something like a smile.  \"Your name is Dan Phillips, isn't it?\" he said irrelevantly, \"and you live with your mother, the Widow Phillips, down there at Carleton Corners, I understand.\"  \"Yes, sir,\" said Dan, wondering how Mr. Walters knew so much about him, and if these were the preliminaries of prosecution.  Mr. Walters took up his pen and drew a blank sheet towards him.  \"Well, Dan, I put that notice in because I found that many people who used to fish on my pond, irrespective of leave or licence, were accustomed to lunch or camp on my property, and did not a little damage. I don't care for trouting myself; I've no time for it. However, I hardly think you'll do much damage. You can keep on fishing there. I'll give you a written permission, so that if any of my men see you they won't interfere with you. As for these trout here, I'll buy them from you at Mosquito Lake prices, and will say no more about the matter. How will that do?\"  \"Thank you, sir,\" stammered Dan. He could hardly believe his ears. He took the slip of paper Mr. Walters handed to him and rose to his feet.  \"Wait a minute, Dan. How was it you came to tell me this? You might have stopped your depredations, and I should not have been any the wiser.\"  \"That wouldn't have been honest, sir,\" said Dan, looking squarely at him.  There was a brief silence. Mr. Walters thrummed meditatively on the table. Dan waited wonderingly.  Finally the factory owner said abruptly, \"There's a vacant place for a boy down here. I want it filled as soon as possible. Will you take it?\"  \"Mr. Walters! _Me!_\" Dan thought the world must be turning upside down.  \"Yes, you. You are rather young, but the duties are not hard or difficult to learn. I think you'll do. I was resolved not to fill that place until I could find a perfectly honest and trustworthy boy for it. I believe I have found him. I discharged the last boy because he lied to me about some trifling offence for which I would have forgiven him if he had told the truth. I can bear with incompetency, but falsehood and deceit I cannot and will not tolerate,\" he said, so sternly that Dan's face paled. \"I am convinced that you are incapable of either."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24873"],["title","Lucy Maud Montgomery Short Stories, 1896 to 1901 (#2)"],["body"," Will you take the place, Dan?\"  \"I will if you think I can fill it, sir. I will do my best.\"  \"Yes, I believe you will. Perhaps I know more about you than you think. Businessmen must keep their eyes open. We'll regard this matter as settled then. Come up tomorrow at eight o'clock. And one word more, Dan. You have perhaps heard that I am an unjust and hard master. I am not the former, and you will never have occasion to find me the latter if you are always as truthful and straightforward as you have been today. You might easily have deceived me in this matter. That you did not do so is the best and only recommendation I require. Take those trout up to my house and leave them. That will do. Good afternoon.\"  Dan somehow got his dazed self through the glass door and out of the building. The whole interview had been such a surprise to him that he was hardly sure whether or not he had dreamed it all.  \"I feel as if I were some person else,\" he said to himself, as he started down the hot white road. \"But Mother was right. I'll stick to her motto. I wonder what Sam will say to this.\"     A Christmas Inspiration   \"Well, I really think Santa Claus has been very good to us all,\" said Jean Lawrence, pulling the pins out of her heavy coil of fair hair and letting it ripple over her shoulders.  \"So do I,\" said Nellie Preston as well as she could with a mouthful of chocolates. \"Those blessed home folks of mine seem to have divined by instinct the very things I most wanted.\"  It was the dusk of Christmas Eve and they were all in Jean Lawrence's room at No. 16 Chestnut Terrace. No. 16 was a boarding-house, and boarding-houses are not proverbially cheerful places in which to spend Christmas, but Jean's room, at least, was a pleasant spot, and all the girls had brought their Christmas presents in to show each other. Christmas came on Sunday that year and the Saturday evening mail at Chestnut Terrace had been an exciting one.  Jean had lighted the pink-globed lamp on her table and the mellow light fell over merry faces as the girls chatted about their gifts. On the table was a big white box heaped with roses that betokened a bit of Christmas extravagance on somebody's part. Jean's brother had sent them to her from Montreal, and all the girls were enjoying them in common.  No. 16 Chestnut Terrace was overrun with girls generally. But just now only five were left; all the others had gone home for Christmas, but these five could not go and were bent on making the best of it.  Belle and Olive Reynolds, who were sitting on the bed--Jean could never keep them off it--were High School girls; they were said to be always laughing, and even the fact that they could not go home for Christmas because a young brother had measles did not dampen their spirits.  Beth Hamilton, who was hovering over the roses, and Nellie Preston, who was eating candy, were art students, and their homes were too far away to visit. As for Jean Lawrence, she was an orphan, and had no home of her own. She worked on the staff of one of the big city newspapers and the other girls were a little in awe of her cleverness, but her nature was a \"chummy\" one and her room was a favourite rendezvous. Everybody liked frank, open-handed and hearted Jean.  \"It was so funny to see the postman when he came this evening,\" said Olive. \"He just bulged with parcels. They were sticking out in every direction.\"  \"We all got our share of them,\" said Jean with a sigh of content.  \"Even the cook got six--I counted.\"  \"Miss Allen didn't get a thing--not even a letter,\" said Beth quickly. Beth had a trick of seeing things that other girls didn't.  \"I forgot Miss Allen. No, I don't believe she did,\" answered Jean thoughtfully as she twisted up her pretty hair. \"How dismal it must be to be so forlorn as that on Christmas Eve of all times. Ugh! I'm glad I have friends.\"  \"I saw Miss Allen watching us as we opened our parcels and letters,\" Beth went on. \"I happened to look up once, and such an expression as was on her face, girls! It was pathetic and sad and envious all at once. It really made me feel bad--for five minutes,\" she concluded honestly.  \"Hasn't Miss Allen any friends at all?\" asked Beth.  \"No, I don't think she has,\" answered Jean. \"She has lived here for fourteen years, so Mrs. Pickrell says. Think of that, girls! Fourteen years at Chestnut Terrace! Is it any wonder that she is thin and dried-up and snappy?\"  \"Nobody ever comes to see her and she never goes anywhere,\" said Beth. \"Dear me! She must feel lonely now when everybody else is being remembered by their friends. I can't forget her face tonight; it actually haunts me. Girls, how would you feel if you hadn't anyone belonging to you, and if nobody thought about you at Christmas?\"  \"Ow!\" said Olive, as if the mere idea made her shiver.  A little silence followed. To tell the truth, none of them liked Miss Allen. They knew that she did not like them either, but considered them frivolous and pert, and complained when they made a racket.  \"The skeleton at the feast,\" Jean called her, and certainly the presence of the pale, silent, discontented-looking woman at the No. 16 table did not tend to heighten its festivity.  Presently Jean said with a dramatic flourish, \"Girls, I have an inspiration--a Christmas inspiration!\"  \"What is it?\" cried four voices.  \"Just this. Let us give Miss Allen a Christmas surprise. She has not received a single present and I'm sure she feels lonely. Just think how we would feel if we were in her place.\"  \"That is true,\" said Olive thoughtfully. \"Do you know, girls, this evening I went to her room with a message from Mrs. Pickrell, and I do believe she had been crying. Her room looked dreadfully bare and cheerless, too. I think she is very poor. What are we to do, Jean?\"  \"Let us each give her something nice. We can put the things just outside of her door so that she will see them whenever she opens it. I'll give her some of Fred's roses too, and I'll write a Christmassy letter in my very best style to go with them,\" said Jean, warming up to her ideas as she talked.  The other girls caught her spirit and entered into the plan with enthusiasm.  \"Splendid!\" cried Beth. \"Jean, it is an inspiration, sure enough. Haven't we been horribly selfish--thinking of nothing but our own gifts and fun and pleasure? I really feel ashamed.\"  \"Let us do the thing up the very best way we can,\" said Nellie, forgetting even her beloved chocolates in her eagerness. \"The shops are open yet. Let us go up town and invest.\"  Five minutes later five capped and jacketed figures were scurrying up the street in the frosty, starlit December dusk. Miss Allen in her cold little room heard their gay voices and sighed. She was crying by herself in the dark. It was Christmas for everybody but her, she thought drearily.  In an hour the girls came back with their purchases.  \"Now, let's hold a council of war,\" said Jean jubilantly. \"I hadn't the faintest idea what Miss Allen would like so I just guessed wildly. I got her a lace handkerchief and a big bottle of perfume and a painted photograph frame--and I'll stick my own photo in it for fun. That was really all I could afford. Christmas purchases have left my purse dreadfully lean.\"  \"I got her a glove-box and a pin tray,\" said Belle, \"and Olive got her a calendar and Whittier's poems. And besides we are going to give her half of that big plummy fruit cake Mother sent us from home. I'm sure she hasn't tasted anything so delicious for years, for fruit cakes don't grow on Chestnut Terrace and she never goes anywhere else for a meal.\"  Beth had bought a pretty cup and saucer and said she meant to give one of her pretty water-colours too. Nellie, true to her reputation, had invested in a big box of chocolate creams, a gorgeously striped candy cane, a bag of oranges, and a brilliant lampshade of rose-coloured crepe paper to top off with.  \"It makes such a lot of show for the money,\" she explained. \"I am bankrupt, like Jean.\"  \"Well, we've got a lot of pretty things,\" said Jean in a tone of satisfaction. \"Now we must do them up nicely. Will you wrap them in tissue paper, girls, and tie them with baby ribbon--here's a box of it--while I write that letter?\"  While the others chatted over their parcels Jean wrote her letter, and Jean could write delightful letters. She had a decided talent in that respect, and her correspondents all declared her letters to be things of beauty and joy forever. She put her best into Miss Allen's Christmas letter. Since then she has written many bright and clever things, but I do not believe she ever in her life wrote anything more genuinely original and delightful than that letter. Besides, it breathed the very spirit of Christmas, and all the girls declared that it was splendid.  \"You must all sign it now,\" said Jean, \"and I'll put it in one of those big envelopes; and, Nellie, won't you write her name on it in fancy letters?\"  Which Nellie proceeded to do, and furthermore embellished the envelope by a border of chubby cherubs, dancing hand in hand around it and a sketch of No. 16 Chestnut Terrace in the corner in lieu of a stamp. Not content with this she hunted out a huge sheet of drawing paper and drew upon it an original pen-and-ink design after her own heart. A dudish cat--Miss Allen was fond of the No. 16 cat if she could be said to be fond of anything--was portrayed seated on a rocker arrayed in smoking jacket and cap with a cigar waved airily aloft in one paw while the other held out a placard bearing the legend \"Merry Christmas.\" A second cat in full street costume bowed politely, hat in paw, and waved a banner inscribed with \"Happy New Year,\" while faintly suggested kittens gambolled around the border. The girls laughed until they cried over it and voted it to be the best thing Nellie had yet done in original work.  All this had taken time and it was past eleven o'clock. Miss Allen had cried herself to sleep long ago and everybody else in Chestnut Terrace "]]]
