But really, my Lord,\" he added, addressing Bacon, \"I fancied I detected your fine Italian hand in that.\"  \"No.  I had nothing to do with the _Othello_,\" said Bacon.  \"I never really knew who wrote it.\"  \"Never mind about that,\" whispered Shakespeare.  \"You've said enough.\"  \"That's good too,\" said Nero, with a chuckle.  \"Shakespeare here claims it as his own.\"  Bacon smiled and nodded approvingly at the blushing Avonian.  \"Will always was having his little joke,\" he said.  \"Eh, Will?  How we fooled 'em on _Hamlet_, eh, my boy?  Ha-ha-ha!  It was the greatest joke of the century.\"  \"Well, the laugh is on you,\" said Doctor Johnson.  \"If you wrote _Hamlet_ and didn't have the sense to acknowledge it, you present to my mind a closer resemblance to Simple Simon than to Socrates.  For my part, I don't believe you did write it, and I do believe that Shakespeare did.  I can tell that by the spelling in the original edition.\"  \"Shakespeare was my stenographer, gentlemen,\" said Lord Bacon.  \"If you want to know the whole truth, he did write _Hamlet_, literally.  But it was at my dictation.\"  \"I deny it,\" said Shakespeare.  \"I admit you gave me a suggestion now and then so as to keep it dull and heavy in spots, so that it would seem more like a real tragedy than a comedy punctuated with deaths, but beyond that you had nothing to do with it.\"  \"I side with Shakespeare,\" put in Emerson.  \"I've seen his autographs, and no sane person would employ a man who wrote such a villanously bad hand as an amanuensis.  It's no use, Bacon, we know a thing or two.  I'm a New-Englander, I am.\"  \"Well,\" said Bacon, shrugging his shoulders as though the results of the controversy were immaterial to him, \"have it so if you please.  There isn't any money in Shakespeare these days, so what's the use of quarrelling?  I wrote _Hamlet_, and Shakespeare knows it.  Others know it.  Ah, here comes Sir Walter Raleigh.  We'll leave it to him.  He was cognizant of the whole affair.\"  \"I leave it to nobody,\" said Shakespeare, sulkily.  \"What's the trouble?\" asked Raleigh, sauntering up and taking a chair under the cue-rack.  \"Talking politics?\"  \"Not we,\" said Bacon.  \"It's the old question about the authorship of _Hamlet_.  Will, as usual, claims it for himself.  He'll be saying he wrote Genesis next.\"  \"Well, what if he does?\" laughed Raleigh.  \"We all know Will and his droll ways.\"  \"No doubt,\" put in Nero.  \"But the question of _Hamlet_ always excites him so that we'd like to have it settled once and for all as to who wrote it.  Bacon says you know.\"  \"I do,\" said Raleigh.  \"Then settle it once and for all,\" said Bacon.  \"I'm rather tired of the discussion myself.\"  \"Shall I tell 'em, Shakespeare?\" asked Raleigh.  \"It's immaterial to me,\" said Shakespeare, airily.  \"If you wish--only tell the truth.\"  \"Very well,\" said Raleigh, lighting a cigar.  \"I'm not ashamed of it.  I wrote the thing myself.\"  There was a roar of laughter which, when it subsided, found Shakespeare rapidly disappearing through the door, while all the others in the room ordered various beverages at the expense of Lord Bacon.     CHAPTER III: WASHINGTON GIVES A DINNER   It was Washington's Birthday, and the gentleman who had the pleasure of being Father of his Country decided to celebrate it at the Associated Shades' floating palace on the Styx, as the Elysium _Weekly Gossip_, \"a Journal of Society,\" called it, by giving a dinner to a select number of friends.  Among the invited guests were Baron Munchausen, Doctor Johnson, Confucius, Napoleon Bonaparte, Diogenes, and Ptolemy.  Boswell was also present, but not as a guest.  He had a table off to one side all to himself, and upon it there were no china plates, silver spoons, knives, forks, and dishes of fruit, but pads, pens, and ink in great quantity.  It was evident that Boswell's reportorial duties did not end with his labors in the mundane sphere.  The dinner was set down to begin at seven o'clock, so that the guests, as was proper, sauntered slowly in between that hour and eight.  The menu was particularly choice, the shades of countless canvas-back ducks, terrapin, and sheep having been called into requisition, and cooked by no less a person than Brillat-Savarin, in the hottest oven he could find in the famous cooking establishment superintended by the government. Washington was on hand early, sampling the olives and the celery and the wines, and giving to Charon final instructions as to the manner in which he wished things served.  The first guest to arrive was Confucius, and after him came Diogenes, the latter in great excitement over having discovered a comparatively honest man, whose name, however, he had not been able to ascertain, though he was under the impression that it was something like Burpin, or Turpin, he said.  At eight the brilliant company was arranged comfortably about the board. An orchestra of five, under the leadership of Mozart, discoursed sweet music behind a screen, and the feast of reason and flow of soul began.  \"This is a great day,\" said Doctor Johnson, assisting himself copiously to the olives.  \"Yes,\" said Columbus, who was also a guest--\"yes, it is a great day, but it isn't a marker to a little day in October I wot of.\"  \"Still sore on that point?\" queried Confucius, trying the edge of his knife on the shade of a salted almond.  \"Oh no,\" said Columbus, calmly.  \"I don't feel jealous of Washington.  He is the Father of his Country and I am not.  I only discovered the orphan. I knew the country before it had a father or a mother.  There wasn't anybody who was willing to be even a sister to it when I knew it.  But G. W. here took it in hand, groomed it down, spanked it when it needed it, and started it off on the career which has made it worth while for me to let my name be known in connection with it.  Why should I be jealous of him?\"  \"I am sure I don't know why anybody anywhere should be jealous of anybody else anyhow,\" said Diogenes.  \"I never was and I never expect to be. Jealousy is a quality that is utterly foreign to the nature of an honest man.  Take my own case, for instance.  When I was what they call alive, how did I live?\"  \"I don't know,\" said Doctor Johnson, turning his head as he spoke so that Boswell could not fail to hear.  \"I wasn't there.\"  Boswell nodded approvingly, chuckled slightly, and put the Doctor's remark down for publication in _The Gossip_.  \"You're doubtless right, there,\" retorted Diogenes.  \"What you don't know would fill a circulating library.  Well--I lived in a tub.  Now, if I believed in envy, I suppose you think I'd be envious of people who live in brownstone fronts with back yards and mortgages, eh?\"  \"I'd rather live under a mortgage than in a tub,\" said Bonaparte, contemptuously.  \"I know you would,\" said Diogenes.  \"Mortgages never bothered you--but I wouldn't.  In the first place, my tub was warm.  I never saw a house with a brownstone front that was, except in summer, and then the owner cursed it because it was so.  My tub had no plumbing in it to get out of order. It hadn't any flights of stairs in it that had to be climbed after dinner, or late at night when I came home from the club.  It had no front door with a wandering key-hole calculated to elude the key ninety-nine times out of every hundred efforts to bring the two together and reconcile their differences, in order that their owner may get into his own house late at night.  It wasn't chained down to any particular neighborhood, as are most brownstone fronts.  If the neighborhood ran down, I could move my tub off into a better neighborhood, and it never lost value through the deterioration of its location.  I never had to pay taxes on it, and no burglar was ever so hard up that he thought of breaking into my habitation to rob me.  So why should I be jealous of the brownstone-house dwellers?  I am a philosopher, gentlemen.  I tell you, philosophy is the thief of jealousy, and I had the good-luck to find it out early in life.\"  \"There is much in what you say,\" said Confucius.  \"But there's another side to the matter.  If a man is an aristocrat by nature, as I was, his neighborhood never could run down.  Wherever he lived would be the swell section, so that really your last argument isn't worth a stewed icicle.\"  \"Stewed icicles are pretty good, though,\" said Baron Munchausen, with an ecstatic smack of his lips.  \"I've eaten them many a time in the polar regions.\"  \"I have no doubt of it,\" put in Doctor Johnson.  \"You've eaten fried pyramids in Africa, too, haven't you?\"  \"Only once,\" said the Baron, calmly.  \"And I can't say I enjoyed them. They are rather heavy for the digestion.\"  \"That's so,\" said Ptolemy.  \"I've had experience with pyramids myself.\"  \"You never ate one, did you, Ptolemy?\" queried Bonaparte.  \"Not raw,\" said Ptolemy, with a chuckle.  \"Though I've been tempted many a time to call for a second joint of the Sphinx.\"  There was a laugh at this, in which all but Baron Munchausen joined.  \"I think it is too bad,\" said the Baron, as the laughter subsided--\"I think it is very much too bad that you shades have brought mundane prejudice with you into this sphere.  Just because some people with finite minds profess to disbelieve my stories, you think it well to be sceptical yourselves.  I don't care, however, whether you believe me or not.  The fact remains that I have eaten one fried pyramid and countless stewed icicles, and the stewed icicles were finer than any diamond-back rat Confucius ever had served at a state banquet.\"  \"Where's Shakespeare to-night?\" asked Confucius, seeing that the Baron was beginning to lose his temper, and wishing to avoid trouble by changing the subject.  \"Wasn't he invited, General?\"  \"Yes,\" said Washington, \"he was invited, but he couldn't come.  He had to go over the river to consult with an autograph "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26191"],["title","Citadel (#1)"],["body","\"I presume you're not. Cigarette, Chris?\"  Apparently, the use of the first name finally caught Mead's notice. He looked thoughtful for a moment, then took a cigarette and lit it. \"Thanks--Dave.\"  \"Well, I'm glad that's settled,\" Marlowe chuckled, his eyes almost disappearing in crinkles of flesh. \"How's Mary?\"  Mead grinned crookedly. \"_Miss Folsom_ is in fine fettle today, thank you.\"  Marlowe rumbled a laugh. Mead had once made the mistake of addressing the woman as \"Mary,\" under the natural assumption that if Marlowe could do it, everyone could.  \"Mary, I fear,\" Marlowe observed, \"lives in more stately times than these. She'll tolerate informality from me because I'm in direct authority over her, and direct authority, of course, is Law. But you, Mead, are a young whipper-snapper.\"  \"But that's totally unrealistic!\" Mead protested. \"I don't respect her less by using her first name ... it's just ... just friendliness, that's all.\"  \"Look,\" Marlowe said, \"it makes sense, but it ain't logical--not on her terms. Mary Folsom was raised by a big, tough, tight-lipped authoritarian of a father who believed in bringing kids up by the book. By the time she got tumbled out into the world, all big men were unquestionable authority and all young men were callow whipper-snappers. Sure, she's unhappy about it, inside. But it makes her a perfect secretary, for me, and she does her job well. We play by her rules on the little things, and by the world's rules on the big ones. Kapish?\"  \"Sure, Dave, but--\"  Marlowe picked up the folder on Holliday and gave Mead one weighty but understanding look before he opened it.  \"Your trouble, Chris, is that your viewpoint is fundamentally sane,\" he said. \"Now, about Holliday, Martin, options 062-26-8729, 063-108-1004. I didn't get time to read the GenSurv on the Karlshaven planets, so I'll ask you to brief me.\"  \"Yes, sir.\"  \"What's IV like?\"  \"Good, arable land. A little mountainous in spots, but that's good. Loaded with minerals--industrial stuff, like silver. Some tin, but not enough to depress the monetary standard. Lots of copper. Coal beds, petroleum basins, the works. Self-supporting practically from the start, a real asset to the Union in fifty-six years.\"  Marlowe nodded. \"Good. Nice picking, Chris. Now--got a decoy?\"  \"Yes, sir. Karlshaven II's a False-E. I've got a dummy option on it in the works, and we'll be able to undercut Holliday's prices for his land by about twenty per cent.\"  \"False-E, huh? How long do you figure until the colony can't stick on it any longer?\"  \"A fair-sized one, with lots of financial backing, might even make it permanently. But we won't be able to dig up that many loafers, and, naturally, we can't give them that big a subsidy. Eventually, we'll have to ferry them all out--in about eight years, say. But that'll give us time enough to break Holliday.\"  Marlowe nodded again. \"Sounds good.\"  \"Something else,\" Mead said. \"II's mineral-poor. It's near to being solid metal. That's what makes it impossible to really live on, but I figure we can switch the mineral companies right onto it and off IV.\"  Marlowe grinned approvingly. \"You been saving this one for Holliday?\"  \"Yes, sir,\" Mead said, nodding slowly. He looked hesitantly at Marlowe.  \"What's up, Boy?\"  \"Well, sir--\" Mead began, then stopped. \"Nothing important, really.\"  Marlowe gave him a surprising look full of sadness and brooding understanding.  \"You're thinking he's an old, frightened man, and why don't we leave him alone?\"  \"Why ... yes, sir.\"  \"Dave.\"  \"Yes, Dave.\"  \"You're quite right. Why don't we?\"  \"We can't, sir. I know that. But it doesn't seem fair--\"  \"Exactly, Chris. It ain't right, but it's correct.\"  The light on Marlowe's interphone blinked once. Marlowe looked at it in momentary surprise. Then his features cleared, and he muttered \"Cabbage.\" He reached out toward the switch.  \"We've got a visitor, Chris. Follow my lead.\" He reviewed his information on Dovenilid titular systems while he touched the switch. \"Ask ud Klavan to come in, uh ... Mary.\"   IV.  Dalish ud Klavan was almost a twin for the pictured typical Dovenilid in Marlowe's library. Since the pictures were usually idealized, it followed that Klavan was an above-average specimen of his people. He stood a full eight feet from fetters to crest, and had not yet begun to thicken his shoes in compensation for the stoop that marked advancing middle age for his race.  Marlowe, looking at him, smiled inwardly. No Dovenilid could be so obviously superior and still only a lowly student. Well, considering Harrison's qualifications, it might still not be tit for tat.  Mead began to get to his feet, and Marlowe hastily planted a foot atop his nearest shoe. The assistant winced and twitched his lips, but at least he stayed down.  \"Dalish ud Klavan,\" the Dovenilid pronounced, in good English.  \"David Marlowe, Secretary for External Affairs, Solar Union,\" Marlowe replied.  Ud Klavan looked expectantly at Mead.  \"Christopher Mead, Assistant Undersecretary for External Affairs,\" the assistant said, orientating himself.  \"If you would do us the honor of permitting us to stand--\" Marlowe asked politely.  [Illustration]  \"On the contrary, Marlowe. If you would do me the honor of permitting me to sit, I should consider it a privilege.\"  \"Please do so. Mr. Mead, if you would bring our visitor a chair--\"  They lost themselves in formalities for a few minutes, Marlowe being urbanely correct, Mead following after as best he could through the maze of Dovenilid morés. Finally they were able to get down to the business at hand, ud Klavan sitting with considerable comfort in the carefully designed chair which could be snapped into almost any shape, Marlowe bulking behind his desk, Mead sitting somewhat nervously beside him.  \"Now, as I understand it, ud Klavan,\" Marlowe began, \"you'd like to learn something of our policies and methods.\"  \"That is correct, Marlowe and Mead.\" The Dovenilid extracted a block of opaque material from the flat wallet at his side and steadied it on his knee. \"I have your permission to take notes?\"  \"Please do. Now, as it happens, Mr. Mead and I are currently considering a case which perfectly illustrates our policies.\"  Ud Klavan immediately traced a series of ideographs on the note block, and Marlowe wondered if he was actually going to take their conversation down verbatim. He shrugged mentally. He'd have to ask him, at some later date, whether he'd missed anything. Undoubtedly, there'd be a spare recording of the tape he himself was making.  \"To begin: As you know, our government is founded upon principles of extreme personal freedom. There are no arbitrary laws governing expression, worship, the possession of personal weapons, or the rights of personal property. The state is construed to be a mechanism of public service, operated by the Body Politic, and the actual regulation and regimentation of society is accomplished by natural socio-economic laws which, of course, are both universal and unavoidable.  \"We pride ourselves on the high status of the individual in comparison to the barely-tolerable existence of the state. We do, naturally, have ordinances and injunctions governing crimes, but even these are usually superseded by civil action at the personal level.\"  Marlowe leaned forward a trifle. \"Forgetting exact principles for a moment, ud Klavan, you realize that the actuality will sometimes stray from the ideal. Our citizens, for example, do not habitually carry weapons except under extraordinary conditions. But that is a civil taboo, rather than a fixed amendation of our constitution. I have no doubt that some future generation, morés having shifted, will, for example, revive the _code duello_.\"  Ud Klavan nodded. \"Quite understood, thank you, Marlowe.\"         *       *       *       *       *  \"Good. Now, to proceed:  \"Under conditions such as those, the state and its agencies _cannot_ lay down a fixed policy of any sort, and expect it to be in the least permanent. The people will not tolerate such regulation, and with each new shift in social morés--and the institution of any policy is itself sufficient to produce such a shift within a short time--successive policies are repudiated by the Body Politic, and new ones must be instituted.\"  Marlowe leaned back and spread his hands. \"Therefore,\" he said with a rueful smile, \"it can fairly be said that we _have_ no foreign policy, effectively speaking. We pursue the expedient, ud Klavan, and hope for the best. The case which Mr. Mead and I are currently considering is typical.  \"The Union, as you know, maintains a General Survey Corps whose task it is to map the galaxy, surveying such planets as harbor alien races or seem suitable for human colonization. Such a survey team, for example, first established contact between your people and ours. Exchange observation rights are worked out, and representatives of both races are given the opportunity to acquaint themselves with the society of the other.  \"In the case of unoccupied, habitable planets, however, the state's function ceases with the filing of a complete and definitive survey at the Under-Ministry for Emigration. The state, as a state, sponsors no colonies and makes no establishments except for the few staging bases which are maintained for the use of the Survey Corps. We have not yet found any need for the institution of an offensive service analogous to a planetary army, nor do we expect to. War in space is possible only under extraordinary conditions, and we foresee no such contingency.  \"All our colonization is carried out by private citizens who apply to Mr. Mead, here, for options on suitable unoccupied planets. Mr. Mead's function is to act as a consultant in these cases. He maintains a roster of surveyed human-habitable planets, and either simply assigns the requested planet or recommends one to fit specified conditions. The cost of the option is sufficient to cover the administrative effort involved, "]]]
