Again, there is a reasonable fee of a nature similar to ours, devoted to the same purposes.  \"The state then ceases to have any voice in the projected colonization whatsoever. It is a totally private enterprise--a simple real estate operation, if you will, with the state acting only as an advertising agency, and, occasionally, as the lessor of suitable transportation from Earth to the new planet. The colonists, of course, are under our protection, maintaining full citizenship unless they request independence, which is freely granted.  \"If you would like to see it for purposes of clarification, you're welcome to examine our file on Martin Holliday, a citizen who is fairly typical of these real estate operators, and who has just filed an option on his second planet.\" Smiling, Marlowe extended the folder.  \"Thank you, I should like to,\" ud Klavan said, and took the file from Marlowe. He leafed through it rapidly, pausing, after asking Marlowe's leave, to make notes on some of the information, and then handed it back.  \"Most interesting,\" ud Klavan observed. \"However, if you'll enlighten me--This man, Martin Holliday; wouldn't there seem to be very little incentive for him, considering his age, even if there is the expectation of a high monetary return? Particularly since his first attempt, while not a failure, was not an outstanding financial success?\"  Marlowe shrugged helplessly. \"I tend to agree with you thoroughly, ud Klavan, but--\" he smiled, \"you'll agree, I'm sure, that one Earthman's boredom is another's incentive? We are not a rigorously logical race, ud Klavan.\"  \"Quite,\" the Dovenilid replied.   V.  Marlowe stared at his irrevocable clock. His interphone light flickered, and he touched the switch absently.  \"Yes, Mary?\"  \"Will there be anything else, Mr. Secretary?\"  \"No, thank you, Mary. Good night.\"  \"Good night, sir.\"  There was no appeal. The day was over, and he had to go home.  He stared helplessly at his empty office, his mind automatically counting the pairs of departing footsteps that sounded momentarily as clerks and stenographers crossed the walk below his partly-open window. Finally he rolled his chair back and pushed himself to his feet. Disconsolate, he moved irresolutely to the window and watched the people leave.  Washington--aging, crowded Washington, mazed by narrow streets, carrying the burden of the severe, unimaginative past on its grimy architecture--respired heavily under the sinking sun.  The capital ought to be moved, he thought as he'd thought every night at this time. Nearer the heart of the empire. Out of this steamy bog. Out of this warren.  His heavy lips moved into an ironical comment on his own thoughts. No one was ever going to move the empire's traditional seat. There was too much nostalgia concentrated here, along with the humidity. Some day, when the Union was contiguous with the entire galaxy, men would still call Washington, on old, out-of-the-way Earth, their capital. Man was not a rigorously logical race, as a race.  The thought of going home broke out afresh, insidiously avoiding the barriers of bemusement which he had tried to erect, and he turned abruptly away from the window, moving decisively so as to be able to move at all. He yanked open a desk drawer and stuffed his jacket pockets with candy bars, ripping the film from one and chewing on its end while he put papers in his brief case.  Finally, he could not delay any longer. Everyone else was out of the building, and the robots were taking over. Metal treads spun along the corridors, bearing brooms, and the robot switchboards guarded the communications of the Ministry. Soon the char-robots would be bustling into this very office. He sighed and walked slowly out, down the empty halls where no human eye could see him waddling.         *       *       *       *       *  He stepped into his car, and as he opened the door the automatic recording said \"Home, please,\" in his own voice. The car waited until he was settled and then accelerated gently, pointing for his apartment.  The recording had been an unavoidable but vicious measure of his own. He'd had to resort to it, for the temptation to drive to a terminal, to an airport, or rocket field, or railroad station--_anywhere_--had become excruciating.  The car stopped for a pedestrian light, and a sports model bounced jauntily to a stop beside it. The driver cocked an eyebrow at Marlowe and chuckled. \"Say, Fatso, which one of you's the Buick?\" Then the light changed, the car spurted away, and left Marlowe cringing.  He would not get an official car and protect himself with its license number. He would not be a coward. He _would_ not!  His fingers shaking, he tore the film from another candy bar.         *       *       *       *       *  Marlowe huddled in his chair, the notebook clamped on one broad thigh by his heavy hand, his lips mumbling nervously while his pencil-point checked off meter.  \"Dwell in aching discontent,\" he muttered. \"No. Not that.\" He stared down at the floor, his eyes distant.  \"Bitter discontent,\" he whispered. He grunted softly with breath that had to force its way past the constricting weight of his hunched chest. \"Bitter dwell.\" He crossed out the third line, substituted the new one, and began to read the first two verses to himself.      \"_We are born of Humankind--     This our destiny:     To bitter dwell in discontent     Wherever we may be._      \"_To strangle with the burden     Of that which heels us on.     To stake our fresh beginnings     When frailer breeds have done._\"  He smiled briefly, content. It still wasn't perfect, but it was getting closer. He continued:      \"_To pile upon the ashes     Of races in decease     Such citadels of our kind's own     As fortify no--_\"  \"What are you doing, David?\" his wife asked over his shoulder.  Flinching, he pulled the notebook closer into his lap, bending forward in an instinctive effort to protect it.  The warm, loving, sawing voice went on. \"Are you writing another poem, David? Why, I thought you'd given that up!\"  \"It's ... it's nothing, really, uh ... Leonora. Nothing much. Just a ... a thing I've had running around my head. Wanted to get rid of it.\"  His wife leaned over and kissed his cheek clumsily. \"Why, you old big dear! I'll bet it's for me. Isn't it, David? Isn't it for me?\"  He shook his head in almost desperate regret. \"I'm ... I'm afraid not, uh--\" Snorer. \"It's about something else, Leonora.\"  \"Oh.\" She came around the chair, and he furtively wiped his cheek with a hasty hand. She sat down facing him, smiling with entreaty. \"Would you read it to me anyway, David? Please, dear?\"  \"Well, it's not ... not finished yet--not right.\"  \"You don't have to, David. It's not important. Not really.\" She sighed deeply.  He picked up the notebook, his breath cold in his constricted throat. \"All right,\" he said, the words coming out huskily, \"I'll read it. But it's not finished yet.\"  \"If you don't want to--\"         *       *       *       *       *  He began to read hurriedly, his eyes locked on the notebook, his voice a suppressed hoarse, spasmodic whisper.      \"_Such citadels of our kind's own     As fortify no peace._      \"_No wall can offer shelter,     No roof can shield from pain.     We cannot rest; we are the damned;     We must go forth again._      \"_Unnumbered we must--_\"  \"David, are you sure about those last lines?\" She smiled apologetically. \"I know I'm old-fashioned, but couldn't you change that? It seems so ... so harsh. And I think you may have unconsciously borrowed it from someone else. I can't help thinking I've heard it before, somewhere? Don't you think so?\"  \"I don't know, dear. You may be right about that word, but it doesn't really matter, does it? I mean, I'm not going to try to get it published, or anything.\"  \"_I_ know, dear, but still--\"  He was looking at her desperately.  \"I'm sorry, dear!\" she said contritely. \"Please go on. Don't pay any attention to my stupid comments.\"  \"They're not stupid--\"  \"Please, dear. Go on.\"  His fingers clamped on the edge of the notebook.      \"_Unnumbered we must wander,     Break, and bleed, and die.     Implacable as ocean,     Our tide must drown the sky._      \"_What is our expiation,     For what primeval crime,     That we must go on marching     Until the crash of time?_      \"_What hand has shaped so cruelly?     What whim has cast such fate?     Where is, in our creation,     The botch that makes us great?_\"  \"Oh, that's good, darling! That's very good. I'm proud of you, David.\"  \"I think it stinks,\" he said evenly, \"but, anyway, there are two more verses.\"  \"_David!_\"  Grimly, he spat out the last eight lines.      \"_Why are we ever gimleted     By empire's irony?     Is discontent the cancered price     Of Earthman's galaxy?_\"  Leonora, recoiling from his cold fury, was a shaking pair of shoulders and a mass of lank hair supported by her hands on her face while she sobbed.      \"_Are our souls so much perverted?     Can we not relent?     Or are the stars the madman's cost     For his inborn discontent?_  \"Good night, Leonora.\"   VI.  The light flickered on Marlowe's interphone.  \"Good morning, Mr. Secretary.\"  \"Good morning, Mary. What's up?\"  \"Harrison's being deported from Dovenil, sir. There's a civil crime charged against him. Quite a serious one.\"  Marlowe's eyebrows went up. \"How much have we got on it?\"  \"Not too much, sir. Harrison's report hasn't come in yet. But the story's on the news broadcasts now, sir. We haven't been asked to comment yet, but Emigration has been called by several news outlets, and the Ministry for Education just called here and inquired whether it would be all right to publish a general"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26206"],["title","Pandemic (#1)"],["body","n't quote Ochsner. I don't agree with him. And besides, you smoke cigarettes, which are infinitely worse.\"  \"Only four or five a day. I don't saturate my system with nicotine.\"  \"In another generation,\" Kramer observed, \"you'd have run through the streets of the city brandishing an ax smashing saloons. You're a lineal descendent of Carrie Nation.\" He puffed quietly until his head was surrounded by a nimbus of smoke. \"Stop trying to reform me,\" he added. \"You haven't been here long enough.\"  \"Not even God could do that, according to the reports I've heard,\" she said.  He laughed. \"I suppose my reputation gets around.\"  \"It does. You're an opinionated slave driver, a bully, an intellectual tyrant, and the best pathologist in this center.\"  \"The last part of that sentence makes up for unflattering honesty of the first,\" Kramer said. \"At any rate, once we realized the situation we went to work to correct it. Institutes like this were established everywhere the disease appeared for the sole purpose of examining, treating, and experimenting with the hope of finding a cure. This section exists for the evaluation of treatment. We check the human cases, and the primates in the experimental laboratories. It is our duty to find out if anything the boys upstairs try shows any promise. We were a pretty big section once, but Thurston's virus has whittled us down. Right now there is just you and me. But there's still enough work to keep us busy. The experiments are still going on, and there are still human cases, even though the virus has killed off most of the susceptibles. We've evaluated over a thousand different drugs and treatments in this Institute alone.\"  \"And none of them have worked?\"  \"No--but that doesn't mean the work's been useless. The research has saved others thousands of man hours chasing false leads. In this business negative results are almost as important as positive ones. We may never discover the solution, but our work will keep others from making the same mistakes.\"  \"I never thought of it that way.\"  \"People seldom do. But if you realize that this is international, that every worker on Thurston's Disease has a niche to fill, the picture will be clearer. We're doing our part inside the plan. Others are, too. And there are thousands of labs involved. Somewhere, someone will find the answer. It probably won't be us, but we'll help get the problem solved as quickly as possible. That's the important thing. It's the biggest challenge the race has ever faced--and the most important. It's a question of survival.\" Kramer's voice was sober. \"We have to solve this. If Thurston's Disease isn't checked, the human race will become extinct. As a result, for the first time in history all mankind is working together.\"  \"All? You mean the Communists are, too?\"  \"Of course. What's an ideology if there are no people to follow it?\" Kramer knocked the ashes out of his pipe, looked at the laboratory clock and shrugged. \"Ten minutes more,\" he said, \"and these tubes will be ready. Keep an eye on that clock and let me know. Meantime you can straighten up this lab and find out where things are. I'll be in the office checking the progress reports.\" He turned abruptly away, leaving her standing in the middle of the cluttered laboratory.  \"Now what am I supposed to do here?\" Mary wondered aloud. \"Clean up, he says. Find out where things are, he says. Get acquainted with the place, he says. I could spend a month doing that.\" She looked at the littered bench, the wall cabinets with sliding doors half open, the jars of reagents sitting on the sink, the drainboard, on top of the refrigerator and on the floor. The disorder was appalling. \"How he ever manages to work in here is beyond me. I suppose that I'd better start somewhere--perhaps I can get these bottles in some sort of order first.\" She sighed and moved toward the wall cabinets. \"Oh well,\" she mused, \"I asked for this.\"         *       *       *       *       *  \"Didn't you hear that buzzer?\" Kramer asked.  \"Was that for me?\" Mary said, looking up from a pile of bottles and glassware she was sorting.  \"Partly. It means they've sent us another post-mortem from upstairs.\"  \"What is it?\"  \"I don't know--man or monkey, it makes no difference. Whatever it is, it's Thurston's Disease. Come along. You might as well see what goes on in our ultra modern necropsy suite.\"  \"I'd like to.\" She put down the bottle she was holding and followed him to a green door at the rear of the laboratory.  \"Inside,\" Kramer said, \"you will find a small anteroom, a shower, and a dressing room. Strip, shower, and put on a clean set of lab coveralls and slippers which you will find in the dressing room. You'll find surgical masks in the wall cabinet beside the lockers. Go through the door beyond the dressing room and wait for me there. I'll give you ten minutes.\"         *       *       *       *       *  \"We do this both ways,\" Kramer said as he joined her in the narrow hall beyond the dressing room. \"We'll reverse the process going out.\"  \"You certainly carry security to a maximum,\" she said through the mask that covered the lower part of her face.  \"You haven't seen anything yet,\" he said as he opened a door in the hall. \"Note the positive air pressure,\" he said. \"Theoretically nothing can get in here except what we bring with us. And we try not to bring anything.\" He stood aside to show her the glassed-in cubicle overhanging a bare room dominated by a polished steel post-mortem table that glittered in the harsh fluorescent lighting. Above the table a number of jointed rods and clamps hung from the ceiling. A low metal door and series of racks containing instruments and glassware were set into the opposite wall together with the gaping circular orifice of an open autoclave.  \"We work by remote control, just like they do at the AEC. See those handlers?\" He pointed to the control console set into a small stainless steel table standing beside the sheet of glass at the far end of the cubicle. \"They're connected to those gadgets up there.\" He indicated the jointed arms hanging over the autopsy table in the room beyond. \"I could perform a major operation from here and never touch the patient. Using these I can do anything I could in person with the difference that there's a quarter inch of glass between me and my work. I have controls that let me use magnifiers, and even do microdissection, if necessary.\"  \"Where's the cadaver?\" Mary asked.  \"Across the room, behind that door,\" he said, waving at the low, sliding metal partition behind the table. \"It's been prepped, decontaminated and ready to go.\"  \"What happens when you're through?\"  \"Watch.\" Dr. Kramer pressed a button on the console in front of him. A section of flooring slid aside and the table tipped. \"The cadaver slides off that table and through that hole. Down below is a highly efficient crematorium.\"  Mary shivered. \"Neat and effective,\" she said shakily.  \"After that the whole room is sprayed with germicide and sterilized with live steam. The instruments go into the autoclave, and thirty minutes later we're ready for another post-mortem.\"  \"We use the handlers to put specimens into those jars,\" he said, pointing to a row of capped glass jars of assorted sizes on a wall rack behind the table. \"After they're capped, the jars go onto that carrier beside the table. From here they pass through a decontamination chamber and into the remote-control laboratory across the hall where we can run biochemical and histological techniques. Finished slides and mounted specimens then go through another decontamination process to the outside lab. Theoretically, this place is proof against anything.\"  \"It seems to be,\" Mary said, obviously impressed. \"I've never seen anything so elegant.\"  \"Neither did I until Thurston's Disease became a problem.\" Kramer shrugged and sat down behind the controls. \"Watch, now,\" he said as he pressed a button. \"Let's see what's on deck--man or monkey. Want to make a bet? I'll give you two to one it's a monkey.\"  She shook her head.         *       *       *       *       *  The low door slid aside and a steel carriage emerged into the necropsy room bearing the nude body of a man. The corpse gleamed pallidly under the harsh shadowless glare of the fluorescents in the ceiling as Kramer, using the handlers, rolled it onto the post-mortem table and clamped it in place on its back. He pushed another button and the carriage moved back into the wall and the steel door slid shut. \"That'll be decontaminated,\" he said, \"and sent back upstairs for another body. I'd have lost,\" he remarked idly. \"Lately the posts have been running three to one in favor of monkeys.\"  [Illustration]  He moved a handler and picked up a heavy scalpel from the instrument rack. \"There's a certain advantage to this,\" he said as he moved the handler delicately. \"These gadgets give a tremendous mechanical advantage. I can cut right through small bones and cartilage without using a saw.\"  \"How nice,\" Mary said. \"I expect you enjoy yourself.\"  \"I couldn't ask for better equipment,\" he replied noncommittally. With deft motion of the handler he drew the scalpel down across the chest and along the costal margins in the classic inverted \"Y\" incision. \"We'll take a look at the thorax first,\" he said, as he used the handlers to pry open the rib cage and expose the thoracic viscera. \"Ah! Thought so! See that?\" He pointed with a small handler that carried a probe. \"Look at those lungs.\" He swung a viewer into place so Mary could see better. \"Look at those abscesses and necrosis. It's Thurston's Disease, all right, with secondary bacterial invasion.\"  The grayish solidified masses of tissue looked nothing like the normal pink appearance of healthy lungs. Studded with yellowish spherical abscesses they lay swollen and engorged within the gaping cavity of the chest.  \"You know the pathogenesis of Thurston's Disease?\" Kramer asked.
