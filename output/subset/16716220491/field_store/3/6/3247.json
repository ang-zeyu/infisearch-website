Her face was covered with rocks and earth, but there was no sign that she had fallen any distance or been seriously hurt.  Now in retrospection Tory could see Kara smiling up at her in the old humorous fashion. She could hear her voice with the gentle drawl that had attracted her so strongly at their original meeting.  \"Most extraordinary thing, Tory darling. I slid off that small embankment a short time ago, bringing most of it along with me. I was considerably bumped and I presume bruised, but not hurt. However, I decided to lie still here for a while until I recovered my nerves and disposition. Then I tried to climb back to you for consolation and found that my legs _would_ crumple under me in the most absurd fashion. So I fell to making disagreeable noises so you would come and find me. What are we going to do, Tory? I can't walk and I weigh too much for you to carry.\"  Yet she must have carried her, or else Kara must have been able to walk a little! Somehow they had managed to reach this clearing nearer the summit of the hill. Here a fire signal could be more plainly observed.  Six hours had passed. Not for five minutes had Tory allowed the fire signal to die down. No one had replied either by another signal or by coming to their rescue.  Fortunately Kara slept the greater part of the time. Now that the night was fully advanced she would be more comfortable where she was than carried down the mountainside, where there was no well defined path. One had to seek the easiest way between the trees.  For her own part Tory concluded that she might as well attempt to sleep for as long as her fire could be trusted to continue burning.  The pine wood was filled with brush and the night so bright she could find without difficulty what she was seeking.  Returning, Tory smothered over the fire so that it might burn for some time without replenishing. She then lay down beside Kara.  Toward morning she must have dreamed. She woke with the impression that a number of years had passed, or what seemed a long passage of time, and in the interval she and Kara had been searching the world over for each other and unable to meet.  Glad she was to reach over and touch her companion, who scarcely had stirred.  Already the sky was streaked with light, palest rose and blue.  Strengthened and refreshed, Tory set to work again. The summer morning was exquisite, the odor of the pine trees never so fragrant, nor the air so delicious.  Failing in her signals for help the evening before, she now determined to make a more strenuous effort. Intending to return to camp before dusk, she and Kara had neglected to bring a flashlight or a lantern which might have proved more effective.  With the coming of darkness she had not relied on solid columns of black smoke being seen at any distance. Now on a farther ridge of the hill she arranged two such smoke columns, remembering that two steady smokes side by side mean \"I am lost, come and help me.\"  If she failed a second time, she determined to go down the hill until she was able to secure aid. But this meant leaving Kara alone, which even for a short time she did not wish to do.  The waiting was the difficult task. To her own embarrassment Tory realized that she was thinking more of her own hunger than of Kara's need as the minutes wore on and no one arrived. Fortunately she had saved a small quantity of coffee in their thermos bottle the day before. This must be for Kara when she finally awakened.  There was nothing to occupy one save to rise now and then and stir the hot ashes to a fresh blaze, covering them afterwards with the green wood of the small beeches that straggled up the hill away from the shadow of the pines.  The noise of footsteps up the mountainside actually failed to arouse Tory until they were not far away.  She first heard an exclamation from Kara. She had not been so sound asleep for the past hour as she had preferred to pretend.  Kara sat up, her arms outstretched as if she were a child begging to be lifted up.  Tory started toward her. She then turned and ran forward with a cry of relief. Had Fate allowed her to choose her own and Kara's rescuers she would have selected the two figures now appearing at the brow of the east side of the hill. They wore the uniforms of Boy Scouts and were the brothers of one of the girls in her own Patrol. They were also her own intimate friends.  \"Don, Lance!\" Tory exclaimed, a little breathless and incoherent. \"How in the world did you find this impossible place? Kara and I have been fearing we might have to stay here always!\"  Don held out his hand and caught Tory's, giving it a reassuring pressure. He was a big, blue-eyed fellow with fair hair and a splendid physique.  In contrast Victoria Drew appeared small and fragile and incapable.  Lance McClain was entirely unlike his brother in appearance. He was dark and small. He went directly to the girl who seemed most to require his help.  As she struggled to rise at his approach and was not able, Lance knelt down on the grass beside her, while Kara explained what had occurred.  Never, Tory Drew decided, would she forget the aspect of their own camp in Beechwood Forest, when an hour or more later she, in the lead, caught the first glimpse of it. It was as if one had struggled through one of the circles of Purgatory to reach Paradise at last.  Actually a few lines from Dante that her father had recited many times returned to Tory's memory:            \"My senses down, when the true path I left;           But when a mountain foot I reached, where closed           The valley that had pierced my heart with dread,           I looked aloft and saw his shoulders broad           Already vested with that planet's beam,           Who leads all wanderers safe through every way.\"  The way had been difficult with Kara helpless.  With their arms forming a kind of basket chair and Kara's arms about their necks, Donald and Lance had moved slowly down the hillside.  Once Tory became aware that Lance looked almost as ill and exhausted as Kara herself.  Don's color continued as ruddy, his eyes as blue and serene and his expression as steadfast as the moment when they had set out on the descent of the hill. To call attention to the fact that Lance was less able to endure the fatigue, Tory knew from past experience would anger him.  Curious that no one in their own camp appeared to have been alarmed by their night's absence!  The morning bugle must have sounded more than an hour before. The early drill was over.  By the open fire Tory now beheld Dorothy McClain and Louise Miller preparing breakfast.  Placing her hands to her lips she uttered their Scout signal call.     CHAPTER II  LOOKING BACKWARD   A few minutes later Donald and Lance McClain were standing in the open space before the Girl Scout camp. They were facing a number of the girls and their Scout Captain, Sheila Mason, as well.  Slightly in the background and yet within hearing, Victoria Drew waited.  Kara was lying on the cot inside her own tent. Tory's friends had suggested that she follow Kara's example and allow breakfast to be brought to her. Surely she looked weary enough after a night of such anxiety!  Tory had her own reasons for declining. Now as she overheard the beginning of the conversation she was glad of her own decision.  \"We are sorry to have intruded upon you even for a short time, Miss Mason,\" Donald McClain protested. \"We know that you have asked that no member of our Scout camp come within your boundaries this summer. Of course you appreciate that the present circumstances left Lance and me no choice. Last night Lance insisted that he saw the light from a fire on one of the hills which he believed was a signal for help. The rest of us talked him out of the idea. The fire was plain enough, but we were under the impression that some one was spending the night on the hill-top and had kindled the fire either for cooking or companionship. Lance is an obstinate chap and was not altogether convinced. He arose at dawn and discovered the two smoke columns. He wakened no one but me. We set out and were lucky enough to find Tory and Kara without much trouble. We must say good-by to you at once. The other fellows will not know what has become of us, as we can't reach our own camp for another two hours.\"  Impulsively Tory Drew made a little forward movement. She then observed Lance's eyes fastened upon her with the half-humorous, half-quizzical expression she frequently found annoying. What was there in the present moment to amuse him, save her own intention to come immediately to Donald's defense? He so rarely made a speech to any stranger so long as this one to the Girl Scout Troop Captain. When the four of them were together, she and Dorothy McClain, Lance and Don, Lance often accused her of talking for Don.  At this instant, however, Sheila Mason extended her hand toward Donald with a friendly gesture.  \"We have been anxious for the opportunity to explain to you and Lance that in asking the Boy Scouts not to pay visits to our camp this summer, we did not intend to include you. We have talked of this to your sister, but Dorothy has had no opportunity, she tells me, to speak of it to you. We realize you could not have taken part in the rude behavior of the other boys the night following our making camp here at the border of the forest.\"  Sheila Mason, the Troop Captain of the Girl Scouts of the Eagle's Wing, was only about ten years older than the youngest member of her Troop.  In the early morning sunlight she looked charming in her brown khaki skirt and white blouse. Her long, light hair was braided close about her small head, her fair skin tanned by the outdoor life of the past few weeks, and color brighter than at any time in her life.  It was now midsummer, with days of unusual heat and nights of enchanting coolness.  There was no trace of severity in the Troop Captain's manner or "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25801"],["title","The Girl Scouts in Beechwood Forest (#2)"],["body","appearance, but Donald McClain flushed uncomfortably and closed his lips into the obstinate lines Tory so well recognized.  She wished Dorothy for a moment would be less faithful to her task of preparing breakfast. Mingling with the other outdoor fragrances, the odor of the coffee gave Tory a sensation of momentary faintness from sheer hunger.  Don had squared his shoulders. Not sixteen, he was nearly six feet in height and splendidly built.  \"You are mistaken, Miss Mason. I was with the other Boy Scouts the night we came over to your camp. We meant to frighten you a little and to find out a few of the mistakes you were pretty sure to make on your first camping venture, nothing worse! We had no idea you'd take a little teasing so seriously. Some of us may not have behaved as well as we should, but nothing for the girls to have made a tragedy over.\"  Donald was not intending to offend the Girl Scout Captain more deeply, but tact was not his strong point.  Why did Lance fail to come to his brother's rescue? Tory flashed an indignant glance at him. He possessed, when he wished, the gift of expression his brother lacked. Lance's occasional moods of silence were due either to disappointment or anger.  Arriving a stranger in Westhaven the winter before, among Victoria Drew's first acquaintances were Dorothy McClain and her six brothers. Their father was the leading physician in Westhaven and an old friend of her aunt and uncle. They were neighbors as well.  In the beginning Tory had believed she preferred Lance to any of the other boys. He was Dorothy's favorite among her brothers, a delicate, musical chap, partly admired and partly scorned by the five who were stronger and more matter of fact.  Lance's passion for music, of which he knew but little, his desire to be left alone, his failure in most athletic sports, the rest of his family found annoying and amusing.  Lance McClain alone was like his mother who had died some years before, the others like Dr. McClain.  \"Lance, why in the world don't you help Don out? You know he will only make things worse if left to himself.\" Tory whispered at this moment.  \"Want to save Don at my expense? All right, Tory,\" he answered quizzically in the voice and manner Tory never really understood.  Lance moved forward and now stood close beside Miss Mason.  His golden-brown eyes and his sensitive mouth relieved his face from plainness, although he was considered the least good looking member of his family.  At present he was smiling in a charming fashion.  \"See here, Miss Mason,\" he began speaking slowly, \"I don't suppose you can imagine what a difficult thing it is to have a brother who is always putting you in the wrong? Oh, not intentionally, but by everlastingly doing the right thing and then trying to take the blame for your mistakes!  \"Don did not want us to come to your camp and make a scene. He is our Patrol leader and we should have done what he advised. Only we wouldn't and didn't! He came along at last more to keep the rest of us out of mischief than because he wanted to be in it.\"  Lance drew his brows together so they became a fine line.  \"Wonder if I've got to make a clean breast of the whole business? Don is everlastingly forcing me to play up to him when I would not otherwise. The suggestion that we hike over to the girls' camp and see what was going on originated with me. Don and I had been telling Dorothy you would never get things in shape over here without help from us, or men in the village. Your Girl Scout Troop has been claiming that you could accomplish all the things we do and a few other things beside. We did not believe you and wished to see for ourselves. I was sorry and mad as Don when some of the fellows went too far. We had a call-down from our Captain and have been looking for a chance to apologize. Do try and forget it, won't you? If your Girl Scouts will swoop down on us unexpectedly and be double the nuisance that we were, we are willing to call it square.\"  Sheila Mason laughed. Margaret Hale, the Patrol leader and one of Victoria Drew's intimate friends, who had joined the group during Lance's speech, shook her head. She was a tall, serious looking girl with clear-cut features and a graceful manner.  \"Lance, I don't believe a Boy Scout Troop is supposed to employ a lawyer. You strike me as a special pleader. You had better go in for the law instead of music. We are not so cranky that we would have objected to an ordinary descent upon us, even with the idea of showing us what inferior creatures we are. But when it comes to trying to frighten us, and some of the more timid girls were frightened, you behaved as if you were wild Indians.\"  Lance held up a white handkerchief.  \"This is a token of complete surrender. We ask the courtesy due the defeated, Miss Mason. Please don't allow Margaret to rake up the past. Don and I must be off now to camp. Sorry you won't give us a message of forgiveness to carry back. May we speak to Dorothy? Evidently she is more interested in her breakfast than in her brothers.\"  \"Nonsense, Lance, you and Don must have breakfast with us before you leave,\" Miss Mason answered. \"I cannot bury the hatchet, Indian fashion, because the Girl Scouts must decide themselves whether or not you are forgiven.\"  Approaching in their direction at this moment, her face flushed and holding a long toasting fork in one hand, was Dorothy McClain.  She was only a year and a few months younger than her two brothers and looked very like Don, save that her hair was chestnut and her eyes a darker blue.  \"Don, Lance, how glad I am you had the good luck to come to Tory's and Kara's aid! I have made a double amount of toast and there are six more eggs added to our usual supply for breakfast. I thought you would appreciate this sisterly attention more than rushing to greet you at once. I saw you were not lonely.\"  \"Good to see you, Dot. You are looking in great shape, only we must be off at once,\" Donald answered, still appearing uncomfortable and obstinate.  Between Dorothy and Tory Drew a signal was flashed of which no one of the small group save Lance McClain was aware.  \"Please stay, Don,\" Tory begged, moving forward and standing beside him. She scarcely came up to his shoulder. \"Edith Linder has gone to Miss Frean's cottage to ask her to come to Kara at once. She is to try to telephone for your father. If not, one of us must ride in to town for him. But perhaps he might want you to be here when he arrives in case there is anything to be done, if Kara has to be lifted. Oh, I don't know anything, except that I am dreadfully worried over her.\"  Don softened.  \"Oh, of course if there is any chance Lance or I can be of further use we'll be glad to stay. You ought to go to bed, Tory, and not wait for father.\"  Tory shook her head. Her face was whiter than usual from anxiety and fatigue, yet Donald McClain liked her appearance.  His brothers and other people might insist there were several girls in the Girl Scout Troop of the Eagle's Wing far prettier than Victoria Drew--Teresa Peterson, with her half Italian beauty, his own sister, Dorothy, Joan Peters, with her regular features and patrician air. Don knew that Tory possessed a charm and vividness, a quickness of thought and a grace of movement more attractive to him than ordinary beauty.  Forgetting their companions, they walked off together, leaving the others to follow.  \"If you only knew how I have been longing to show you our camp in Beechwood Forest, Don! Please say you think it is wonderful,\" Tory pleaded.     CHAPTER III  THEIR CAMP   They were seated along the edge of the lake, six girls and their two visitors. The water was a still, dim blue reflection of the sky with one deep shadow from the hill of pines. Away from the hill and the lake stood the forest of beechwood trees.  In an open space on a little rise of ground half within, half without the forest, lay the summer camp of the Girl Scouts of the Eagle's Wing.  A little brown house built of logs was almost entirely covered with vines, a tangle of woodbine and honeysuckle and wistaria. Only from the windows and the door had the vines been cut away. The house looked extremely ancient, older than the slender beeches that formed a semicircle to the rear and left. Beyond the door, thick with deep green shade on this midsummer morning, towered a single giant beech which appeared to have moved out a few yards from its forest shelter to act as a sentinel for the log cabin.  The cabin had been erected so many years before that no one in the vicinity remembered its origin. Finding the location an ideal one for their camp, the little house had been restored, the chimney to the single fireplace made over, the glass added to the window frames, open spaces between the logs replastered.  The log house formed the center of the camp.  On each side at irregular distances were three tents, one row advancing from the forest, the other receding into it.  To-day there was an unusual stillness about the camp itself at an hour of the morning ordinarily a busy and active one.  Now and then some one appeared, hastily accomplished whatever the task and vanished.  Even the little group on the shore of the lake continued unusually quiet. When any one did speak it was with a lowered voice.  Five of the six girls were occupied. Only Tory Drew's hands were idle. They moved frequently with unconscious gestures characteristic of her temperament and the fact that she had lived a number of years in the Latin countries where the hands are used to communicate one's meaning as well as speech.  She made a sweeping movement of her hand at this instant, appearing to include the lake, forest, hillside and the small group of tents about the evergreen cabin.  \"You have not yet said, Don, that you consider our camp superior to yours, when I am perfectly convinced that it is, without having laid eyes on yours. Lance has given me the impression that he agrees with me. He has not"]]]
