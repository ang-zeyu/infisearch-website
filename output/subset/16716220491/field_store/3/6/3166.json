I once met Chloris at a ball,           And in my folly     I went and suffered all this pain     In hopes to see her once again.      Of strawberries a pound at least     I ate, and made myself a beast           With tea and sherry;     And raspberries I ate and trembled,     Until I felt that I resembled           Myself a berry,     But 'twas the berry that at school     We used to call a gooseberry fool.      The I. C. R. V.[F] band droned on,     While guests had come and guests had gone           Since my arrival;     My brow grew gloomier with despair,     And on it sat the guilty air           Of a survival     Of some remorse for ancient crimes     Wrought in the pre-historic times.      My seventh cup of tea was done,     My seventh glass of wine begun,           Then of her coming     I was aware, nor shall forget     How she and that brown sherry set           My brains a-humming;     Well should I be rewarded soon     For all the weary afternoon.      Her eyes looked vaguely into mine     Without as much as half a sign           Of recognition.     My heart, my heart! the blow was sore,     But you have often been before           In this condition;     As said the bard of old, those eyes     Are not my only Paradise.[G]  [F] Inns of Court Rifle Volunteers.  [G] Dante, Par. xviii. 21.     The Spinning-House of the Future      \"Cada puta hile.\"--_Don Quixote_, i. 46.       Without my dinner here I lie,           And all because that proctor     With her stout bull-dogs passed, and I                       Mocked her.      For Clara is at Girton too,           That dragon is her tutor,     I threatened once what I would do,                       Shoot her.      Her life by Clara's tears was saved,           Wherefore she doth detest me,     And hither hungry and unshaved                       Pressed me.      I would that I could have commenced           An action 'gainst that devil,     Like that once brought by Kemp against                       Neville.[H]      To her I owe the statute framed           That one against it sinning     Should dwell within the house that's named                       Spinning.      Ah me! it runs in sections three:           Who speaks to Girton student     Is fined to teach him how to be                       Prudent.      Who loves a Girton girl must do           Twelve months on bread and water,     From a digestive point of view                       Slaughter.      Who kisses her commits a crime           By hanging expiated,     And she in tears must spend her time                       Gated.      Would that at Oxford I had been,           At Balliol or at Merton,     And then I never should have seen                       Girton.      Go down I must, no more shall I           And Clara cross the same bridge;     Still, Granta, art thou her and my                       Cambridge.      Some day on this her eyes may light,           This doggerel stiff and jointless,     And she may own it is not quite                       Pointless.  [H] An action brought in 1861 by a dressmaker at Cambridge against the Vice-Chancellor for false imprisonment in the Spinning-House (the University prison). The Court of Common Pleas held _inter alia_ that no action lies against a judge for a judicial decision on a matter within his jurisdiction (10 Common Bench Reports, New Series, 523).     How we found our Verdict       We sat in the jury-box, twelve were we all,     And the clock was just pointing to ten in the hall,     His Lordship he bowed to the jury, and we     Bowed back to his Lordship as gravely as he.      The case of _De Weller_ v. _Jones_ was the first,     And we all settled down and prepared for the worst     When old Smithers, Q.C., began slowly to preach     Of a promise of marriage and action for breach.      A barmaid the plaintiff was, wondrous the skill     Wherewith she was wont her tall tankards to fill,     The defendant, a publican, sought for his bride     Such a paragon, urged by professional pride.      But the course of true love ran no smoother for her     Than the Pas de Calais or the bark of a fir,     The defendant discovered a widow with gold     In the bank and the plaintiff was left in the cold.      An hour Smithers spoke, and he said that the heart     Of the plaintiff at Jones's fell touch flew apart,     But a cheque for a thousand might help to repair     The destruction effected by love and despair.      Miss de Weller was called, and in ladylike tones     She described all the injury suffered from Jones,     How he called her at first \"Angelina,\" and this     Soon cooled to \"Miss Weller,\" and lastly to \"Miss.\"      But the jury were shaken a little when Gore     Cross-examined about her engagements before,     For Jones was the sixth of the strings to her bow     And with five other verdicts she solaced her woe.      Re-examined by Smithers, she won us again,     For the tears of a maid are a terror to men,     Then his Lordship awoke from his nap and explained     How love that is frequent is love that is feigned.      Miss de Weller looked daggers, and under the paint     Of her cheeks she grew pale and fell down in a faint,     She played her trump-card in the late afternoon,     For damages satisfy girls who can swoon.      Till she fainted most thought that a farthing would do,     Though I was in favour of pounds--one or two;     But after the faint--and she _was_ so well dressed--     At a hundred the void in her heart was assessed.     A Greek Libel       ARCHILOCHUS.      Neobule, yesternight     Saw I thee in beauty dight,     On thy head a myrtle spray     Cast its shadow as the day     By the stars was put to flight.     Twining on thy temples white     Roses gave the myrtle light,     Sign thou wilt not say me nay,                   Neobule.     Loosened from its coilèd height     Streamed thy hair in thy despite     On thy shoulders soft to stray     And to bid the bard essay     Never but of thee to write,                   Neobule.       NEOBULE.      Sorry poet, who dost dare     Cast bold glances on my hair,     Let thy most presumptuous eyes     Seek another enterprise,     Ceasing now to linger there.     Hearken, I can tell thee where     Grow the bushes that will spare     Rods to teach thee humbler guise,                   Sorry poet.     Know I not that I am fair?     Need thy halting verse declare     What my mirror daily cries?     Rid me of thy silly sighs,     Rid me of thy hateful stare,                   Sorry poet.       ARCHILOCHUS.      Neobule, poets see     Dreams of things that are to be.     Vengeance is the poet's trade,     Come, iambus, to my aid     'Gainst the fools who scoff at me.     All the world will laugh with glee     When they mark my verses free     Grasp thee like a pillory,     And thy scorn with scorn repaid,                   Neobule.     E'en in death thou canst not flee     From the doom the Fates decree.     When my satire's keenest blade     Cuts thee to the heart, fond maid,     I shall laugh, but what of thee,                   Neobule?     Le Temps Passé       Those brave old days when King Abuse did reign     We sigh for, but we shall not see again.

O'er pauper settlements men fought amain,     And golden guineas followed in their train,     John Doe then flourished like a lusty tree,     And Richard Roe brought many a noble fee,     We mourn in unremunerated pain                           Those brave old days.  [I] See, for instance, the well-known case of _Mostyn_ v. _Fabrigas_, in which the plaintiff declared that the defendant on the 1st of September, in the year 1771, made an assault upon the said plaintiff at Minorca, to wit, at London, in the parish of St. Mary-le-bow, in the Ward of Cheap.

What excited him in the strangest way was the unaccountable indifference of Jews themselves to what seemed to him the menace of the existing situation. He saw the Jews in every land encircled by enemies, hostility to them growing with the increase of their numbers. In his excitement he thought first of Jewish philanthropists. He sought an interview with Baron Maurice de Hirsch in May, 1895. He planned an address to the Rothschilds. He talked of his ideas to friends in literary circles. His mind was obsessed by a gigantic problem which gave him no rest. He was struggling to pierce the veils of revelation. He saw a world in which the Jewish people lacked a fulcrum for national action and therefore had to seek to create it through beneficence. He had a remarkably resourceful and agile imagination. He weighed ideas, balanced them, discarded them, reflected, reconsidered, tried to reconcile contradictions, and finally came to what seemed to him at the moment the synthesis of the issue which seemed acceptable to reason and sentiment.         *       *       *       *       *  Obviously, \"The Jewish State\" was not a dogmatic finality. Most of the plans for settlement and migration are improvisations. The pamphlet was not a rigid plan or a blueprint. It was not a description of a Utopia, although some parts of it give that impression. It had an indicated destiny but was not bound by a rigid line. It was the illumination of a dynamic thought and followed the light with the hope that it might lead to fulfillment. There was room for detours and variations. It was to be rewritten, as he knew, not by its author but by the Jewish people on their way to freedom.         *       *       *       *       *  In fact, it was revised from the moment the Zionist movement was organized on an international basis. The \"Society of Jews\" became the Zionist Organization, with its statutes, its procedures, its public excitement and controversies. \"The Jewish Company\" became the Bank; then more specifically, the Jewish Colonial Trust and later the Anglo-Palestine Bank. The description of the _Gestor_, which appears in the final chapter of the pamphlet, was never referred to again, but in effect it was incorporated in the idea of a state in-the-process-of-becoming. Its legitimate successor is the Jewish Agency referred to in the Mandate for Palestine. He was first led by the idea that the way to the charter was through the Sultan and that the Sultan would be influenced by Kaiser Wilhelm. But both princes failing him, he turned to England and Joseph Chamberlain, and came to the Uganda proposal. This was Herzl's one political success although the project was, in effect, rejected by the Zionist Congress. But this encounter with England was a precedent which led to much speculation in Zionist circles and gave a turn to Zionist thought away from Germany and Turkey. It served to inspire Dr. Chaim Weizman to make his home in England with the express purpose of seeking English sympathy for the Zionist ideal. The successor of Joseph Chamberlain was Arthur James Balfour. When Herzl opened Chamberlain's door, Zionism had an easier access to the England of Balfour.  When Herzl first appeared on the political scene, he thought of courtiers and statesmen, of princes and kings. He found that they could not be relied upon for truth or stability. They were encircled by favorites and mercenaries. Enormous responsibilities rested upon their shoulders but they seemed to behave with regard to these responsibilities as if they were gamblers or amateurs. Herzl soon realized that these were frail reeds that would break under the slightest pressure. He came to put his trust in the Jewish people, the only real source of strength for the purpose of redemption. Confidence in themselves would give them power to breach their prison walls. His aristocratic republic had to become a movement of democracy. Only in \"The Jewish State\" will you find reference to a movement based upon Jews who endorse a \"fixed program,\" and then become members under the \"discipline\" of leadership. When Herzl faced the First Congress, he saw that this conception of Zionism was foreign to the nature and character of the Jewish people. The shekel was the registry of a name. It led the way to the elevation of the individual in Zionist affairs, first as a member of a democratic army \"willing\" the fulfillment, and then settling in Palestine to become the hands that built the Homeland.  Arrayed in the armor of democracy, the Zionist movement made the self-emancipation ideal of Pinsker live in the soul of Herzl. At a number of Congresses, in his articles in Die Welt, Herzl showed how that idea had become an integral part of his life, although his first thoughts ran in quite another direction.  But his analysis of anti-Semitism and how to approach the problem remains true today after Hitler, as it was true then after Dreyfus. This was the authentic revelation that in his last days was fixed in his mind. The homelessness of the Jewish people must come to an end. That tragedy is a world problem. It is to be solved by world statesmanship in cooperation with the reawakened Jewish people. It is to be solved by the establishment of a free Jewish State in their historic Homeland. Herzl manifested his utter identification with the destiny of his own people at the Uganda Congress when he faced the rebellious Russian Zionists, spoke words of consolation to them and gave them assurances of his fealty to Zion. He died a few months later.  \"The Jewish State\" was not regarded by Herzl as a piece of literature. It was a political document. It was to serve as the introduction to political action. It was to lead to the conversion of leaders in political life. It was to win converts to the idea of a Jewish State. Although a shy man at first, he did not hesitate to make his way through the corridors of the great and suffer the humiliations of the suppliant. Through that remarkable friend and Christian, the Reverend William H. Hechler, he met the Grand Duke of Baden; he made the rounds of German statesmen, Count zu Eulenburg, Foreign Minister, Von Buelow and Reichschancellor Hohenlohe; then he met the favorites who encircled Sultan Abdul Hamid and the Sultan himself. He placed the dramatic personae of his drama on the stage. The plan involved the Turkish debt, the German interest in the Orient. It involved stimulating the Russians and visiting the Pope. At first his political activities were conducted as the author of a startling pamphlet, then as the leader of his people. He became conscious of his leadership, and played his part with superb dignity. He had ease of manner and correct form. He created the impression of a regal personality; his noble appearance hid his hesitations and fears. With the Sultan he played the most remarkable game of diplomacy. He believed that once a mutual interest could be arrived at, he would be able to secure the funds, although at the time of speaking he had no funds at all. Adjusting himself to the wily Turk, he had to change and diminish his demands and finally, when he was dangerously near a disclosure, he was saved by the Sultan's transferring his interest to the French and obtaining his funds from them. With Kaiser Wilhelm, he soon appreciated the fact that he had to deal with a great theatrical personality who spoke of plans and purpose with great fire, but had no courage and whose convictions melted away in the face of obstacles.  The world Herzl dealt with has passed away. The Turkish Empire now occupies a small part of the Near East. Its former provinces have now become \"sovereign\" states struggling to establish harmony between themselves and feeding on their animus towards the Jewish people returning home. The methods of diplomacy have changed. Loudness of speech is no longer out of order. Frankness and brutality may be expected at any international gathering. It is now felt as never before that behind political leaders, rulers, princes, statesmen, the people are advancing and soon will be able to push aside those who make of the relations of peoples a game and a gamble, a struggle for power, which, when achieved, dissolves into the nothingness of vanity.         *       *       *       *       *  \"The Jewish State\" should be regarded as one of a series of books, variations on the same theme, composed by the same author. The first was \"The New Ghetto\" (1894). That was a play which dealt with the social life of the upper class of Jews in Vienna. Then came the \"Address to the Rothschilds.\" That was a memorandum which contained a proposal to Jewish philanthropists. \"The Jewish State\" was the third effort of an agitated mind, wavering between the projection of a Utopia or a thesis, and containing the political solution of the Jewish problem. The final variant of the original theme was the novel \"Altneuland.\" Here he pictured the Promised Land as it might become twenty years after the beginning of the Zionist movement. In the interims, he played on the exciting stage of the Zionist Congresses. He paid court to princes and their satellites. He led in the organization of the Jewish Colonial Trust and the Jewish National Fund. He delivered political addresses and engaged in political controversy. He began the writing of his \"Diaries\" after he had written \"The Jewish State.\" His whole personality is reflected in that remarkable book. There you see his ideas in the process of becoming clear. There you see his sharp reactions; the reflection of his hopes, his disappointments, his shifts from untenable positions to positions possible after defeat. There you read his penetrating analysis of the figures on the Zionist stage upon whom he had to rely. There you are made to feel his doubts, his dread of death. In the midst of life he felt himself encircled by the Shadow of Death. There you found the explanation of his great haste, why he was so anxious to bring a measure of practical"]]]
