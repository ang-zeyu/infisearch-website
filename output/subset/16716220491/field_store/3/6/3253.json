It was very fine music, for that is the sort that Londoners usually offer at their teas, and Patty thoroughly enjoyed the singing and the violin-playing. She was a little afraid that Mrs. Hastings would ask her to sing, but as it was a programme of professionals this did not happen.  When the Hartleys came, Mabel at once made her way to Patty's side and sat down by her.  \"I'm so glad to see you again,\" she said, \"and it's so lovely that you're going home with us.\"  \"I'm glad, too,\" returned Patty, \"it was lovely of you to ask me.\"  Mabel Hartley was an English girl, and was about as different from Patty as could well be imagined, and perhaps for this reason the two were very good friends. Although they had met only a few times, they liked each other from the beginning, and both were ready to continue the friendship.  Mabel was large and stout, with the solidity which characterises the British young girls. She was large-boned and not very graceful, but she carried herself with a patrician air that told of past generations of good-breeding. Her complexion was of that pure pink and white seen only on English faces, but her pale, sandy hair and light blue eyes failed to add the deeper color that was needed. Her frock was an uninteresting shade of tan, and did not hang evenly, while her hat was one of those tubby affairs little short of ridiculous.  Patty fairly ached to re-clothe her, in some pretty clear color, and a becoming hat.  The girls were politely silent while the music was going on, but in the intervals between the numbers they chattered glibly.  \"That's Grace Meredith and her brother Tom just coming in,\" said Mabel. \"I hope they'll come over here; you'll like them, I know.\"  The Merediths did come over, and were promptly introduced to Patty.  \"Do you know,\" said Tom Meredith, as he shook hands in cordial, boyish fashion, \"you're the first American girl I've ever met.\"  \"Am I, really?\" laughed Patty. \"Now don't ask me if we always wear our diamonds to market, for truly the American women who go to market rarely have any diamonds.\"  \"I never believed that diamond story, anyway,\" responded Tom, gravely, \"but I'm glad to have you tell me it isn't true. I'm perfectly unprejudiced about America, though. I'm ready to believe it's the best country in the world, outside of our own little island.\"  \"Good for you!\" cried Patty. \"Then I'm ready to acknowledge that I like England next best to America.\"  \"Have you been here long?\" asked Grace.  \"No, only about two weeks, but I love London better every day, and I know I shall love the English country. Just the glimpse I caught coming in the train from Dover was delightful.\"  \"You should see the Hartleys' country place,\" declared Tom, with enthusiasm. \"It's a ripping old house, two hundred years old, and all that. And such parks and orchards! Well!\"  \"I hope you will come to see it, Patty,\" said Mabel, a little wistfully, and Patty wondered why the girl's tone had in it a note of sadness.  But just then, as the music was over, Mrs. Hastings asked them to go to the tea-room, and the group of young people followed in her wake.  \"You girls sit here,\" said Tom, selecting a jolly-looking alcove, with window-seats and red cushions, \"while I stalk some food.\"  He was back in a few moments, followed by a waiter, who brought a tray of teacups and plates of sweet cakes.  Tom, himself, bore triumphantly a covered silver dish.  \"Muffins!\" he announced, in a jubilant voice. \"Hot, buttered muffins! Crickets, what luck!\"  The hot muffins, buttered and quartered, were indeed delicious, and England and America seemed at one in showing an appreciative appetite for them.  \"We don't have these in America,\" said Patty, surveying her bit of muffin with admiration. \"We have good sandwiches, though.\"  \"We almost never have sandwiches,\" said Grace.  \"You don't need to,\" said Patty, quickly. \"Your wonderful bread and butter is too good to be spoiled with a sandwich filling of any sort.\"  \"'Most all things are good eating at an afternoon tea,\" observed Tom. \"Somehow, at five o'clock I'm always so hungry I could eat a brickbat if it were toasted and buttered.\"  \"Afternoon tea is really an acquired taste with us,\" said Patty. \"You seem to have it naturally, even when you're alone, but we only have it when we have guests.\"  \"Really?\" said Mabel, in astonishment. \"Why, we'd as soon think of omitting breakfast or dinner as tea.\"  \"It's a lovely meal,\" said Patty, giving a little sigh of satisfaction, as her last crumb of muffin disappeared. \"Such good things to eat, and then it's so cosy and informal to sit around in easy chairs, instead of at a big table.\"  \"But the ideal place for tea is on the lawn,\" said Tom. \"The open air and the trees and birds and flowers are even a better setting for it, than an interior like this.\"  \"I hope I shall have that kind this summer,\" said Patty. \"I'm invited to several country houses, and I know I shall enjoy it immensely.\"  \"Indeed you will,\" said Mabel, and again Patty thought she detected a shade of sadness in her friend's eyes.  But if Mabel was not exactly gay, Grace Meredith made up for it. She was full of fun and laughter, and both she and Tom made comical speeches until Patty feared she would disgrace herself laughing.  \"What's the joke?\" asked Mrs. Hartley, coming to collect her young people and take them home.  \"Tom is making verses about the people here,\" explained Grace. \"Tell Mrs. Hartley the one about the violinist, Tom.\"  \"Don't think it's rude, Mrs. Hartley,\" said young Meredith; \"truly, it isn't meant to be. But for that classic-browed genius, with his chrysanthemum of tawny-colored hair, isn't this a pleasant token of regard and esteem?                \"This is our latest social lion,               So, to look modest, he's tryin' and tryin'.\"  \"It's very beautiful,\" said Mrs. Hartley, smiling, \"and I daresay Professor Prendergast would enjoy it himself, were he to hear it.\"  \"He might,\" said Tom, doubtfully, \"but musicians rarely have a sense of humour, at least, about themselves.\"  \"That's true,\" agreed Mrs. Hartley, \"and now, Mabel and Miss Fairfield, we must be going on.\"  Good-byes were soon said, and in the Hartleys' carriage Patty was taken away to her first visit in an English home.     CHAPTER II  RIDDLES AND GAMES   Much to Patty's satisfaction Mabel Hartley was in the habit of dining with her elders and was not condemned to \"schoolroom tea.\"  The family was not large, consisting only of Mrs. Hartley, her mother, Mrs. Cromarty, her two sons, and Mabel. The sons, Sinclair and Robert, were big, stalwart fellows, a few years older than Mabel.  Patty liked them at once, for they were cordial and hearty in their greetings, and quite at ease in their conversation.  \"I say, Mater,\" began Bob, after they were seated at dinner, \"there's a stunning garden-party on at Regent's Park next week. Don't you think we can all go? Tickets only two shillings each.\"  \"What is it, my son? A charity affair?\"  \"Yes. Rest cure for semi-orphans, or something. But they've all sorts of jolly shows, and the Stagefright Club is going to give a little original play. Oh, say we go!\"  \"I'll see about it,\" answered Mrs. Hartley. \"Perhaps, if we make up a party, Miss Fairfield will go with us.\"  \"I'd love to,\" said Patty. \"I've never seen a real English garden party.\"  \"Oh, this isn't a real English garden party in the true sense,\" said Sinclair. \"To see that, you must be in the country. But this is a public London garden party and typical of its sort. You'll like it, I'm sure. Will you go with us, Grandy?\"  At first it seemed incongruous to Patty to hear the dignified Mrs. Cromarty addressed by such a nickname, but as she came to know her better, the name seemed really appropriate. The lady was of the class known as _grande dame_, and her white hair and delicate, sharply-cut features betokened a high type of English aristocracy. Her voice was very sweet and gentle, and she smiled at her big grandson, as she replied:  \"No, my boy; I lost my taste for garden parties some years ago. But it's a fine setting for you young people, and I hope Emmeline will take you all.\"  \"Mother said she'd see about it,\" said Mabel, \"and that's always the same as 'yes.' If it's going to be 'no,' she says, 'I'll think it over.'\"  \"It's a great thing to understand your mother-tongue so well,\" said Patty, laughing; \"now I shouldn't have known those distinctions.\"  \"We have a wonderful talent for languages,\" said Sinclair, gravely. \"Indeed, we have a language of our own. Shall I teach it to you?\"  \"You might try,\" said Patty, \"but I'm not at all clever as a linguist.\"  \"You may not learn it easily, but it can be taught in one sentence. It consists in merely using the initial of the word instead of the word itself.\"  \"But so many words begin with the same initial,\" said Patty, bewildered at the idea.  \"Yes, but it's ever so much easier than you'd think. Now listen. Wouldn't you understand me if I said: 'D y w t g t t g p?'\"  \"Say it again, please, and say it slowly.\"  Sinclair repeated the letters, and Patty clapped her hands, crying: \"Yes, yes, of course I understand. You mean 'Do you want to go to the garden party?' Now, listen to me while I answer: Y I w t g i i d r.\"  \"Good!\" exclaimed Mabel. \"You said: 'Yes, I want to go, if it doesn't rain.' Oh, you are a quick pupil.\"  \"But those are such easy sentences,\" said Patty, as she considered the matter.  \"That's the point,\" said Bob, \"most sentences, at least, the ones we use most, _are_ easy. If I should meet you unexpectedly, and say H d y d? you'd know I meant How do you do? Or if I took leave, and said G b, you'd understand good-bye. Those are the simplest possible examples. Now, on the other hand, if I were to read you a long speech from the morning paper, you'd probably miss many of the long words, but that's the other extreme. We've talked in initials for years, and rarely are we uncertain as to the sense, though we may sometimes skip a "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25847"],["title","Patty's Friends (#2)"],["body","here and there.\"  \"But what good is it?\" asked Patty.  \"No good at all,\" admitted Bob; \"but it's fun. And after you're used to it, you can talk that way so fast that any one listening couldn't guess what you are saying. Sometimes when we're riding on an omnibus, or anything like that, it's fun to talk initials and mystify the people.\"  \"D y o d t?\" said Patty, her eyes twinkling.  \"Yes, we often do that,\" returned Bob, greatly gratified at the rapid progress of the new pupil. \"You must be fond of puzzles, to catch this up so quickly.\"  \"I am,\" said Patty. \"I've guessed puzzles ever since I was a little girl. I always solve all I can find in the papers, and sometimes I take prizes for them.\"  \"We do that too,\" said Mabel; \"and sometimes we make puzzles and send them to the papers and they print them. Let's make some for each other this evening.\"  After dinner the young people gathered round the table in the pleasant library, and were soon busy with paper and pencils. Patty found the Hartleys a match for her in quickness and ingenuity, but she was able to guess as great a proportion of their puzzles as they of hers.  After amusing themselves with square words and double acrostics, they drifted to conundrums, and Bob asked:  \"Which letter of the Dutch alphabet spells an English lady of rank?\"  \"That's not fair,\" objected Patty, \"because I don't know the Dutch alphabet.\"  \"That doesn't matter,\" said Mabel, \"you can guess it just as well without.\"  \"Indeed I can't, and besides I don't know the names of all the English ladies of rank.\"  \"That doesn't matter either,\" said Sinclair, smiling; \"it spells a title, not a name; and one you know very well.\"  \"I can't guess it, anyway,\" said Patty, after a few moment's thought. \"I give it up; tell me.\"  \"Why, Dutch S,\" said Bob, and Patty agreed that it was a good catch.  \"Now, I'll catch you,\" said Patty. \"You all know your London pretty well, I suppose, and are familiar with the places of interest. Well, Mabel, why is your nose like St. Paul's?\"  Mabel thought hard, and so did the boys.  \"Is my nose like St. Paul's, too?\" asked Bob, thoughtfully, stroking his well-shaped feature.  Patty looked at it critically. \"Yes,\" she said, \"and so is Sinclair's. But why?\"  At last they gave it up, and Patty said, triumphantly, \"Because it is made of flesh and blood.\"  They all screamed with laughter, for they quickly saw the point, and realised that it was the historic character referred to, and not the cathedral.  \"Here's one,\" said Sinclair: \"Where did the Prince of Wales go on his eleventh birthday?\" But Patty was quite quick enough for this. \"Into his twelfth year,\" she answered promptly. \"And now listen to this: A man walking out at night, met a beggar asking alms. The man gave him ten cents. He met another beggar and gave him fifteen cents. What time was it?\"  \"Time for him to go home,\" declared Bob, but Patty said that was not the right answer.  \"Springtime,\" guessed Mabel, \"because the man was in such a good humor.\"  \"No,\" said Patty, \"it was quarter to two.\"  Her hearers looked utterly blank at this, and, suddenly realising that they were not very familiar with American coins, Patty explained the joke. They saw it, of course, but seemed to think it not very good, and Sinclair whimsically insisted on calling it, \"a shilling to Bob,\" which he said was equally nonsensical.  \"Give us one of your poetry ones, Grandy,\" said Bob to Mrs. Cromarty, who sat by, quietly enjoying the young people's fun.  \"Miss Fairfield may not care for the old-fashioned enigma, but I will offer this one,\" and in her fine, clear voice the old lady recited her verse with elocutionary effect:                     \"Afloat upon the ocean                    My graceful form you see;                     The protector of the people,                    The protector of a tree.                     I often save a patient,                    Though a doctor I am not;                     My name is very easy,                    Can you tell me, children? What?\"  The others had heard this before, and when Patty promptly guessed \"Bark,\" Mrs. Cromarty was distinctly pleased with her quick-wittedness.  Then lemonade and wafery little cakes were brought in, that the puzzlers might refresh themselves.  The atmosphere of the Hartley household was very pleasant, and Patty felt much more at home than she had ever expected to feel among English people. She made allusion to this, and Bob said: \"Oh, this place isn't homey at all, compared with our real home. You must come to see us down in the country, mustn't she, mother?\"  \"I should be very glad to welcome you there, my dear,\" said Mrs. Hartley, smiling at Patty, \"and I trust it may be arranged. We have this apartment for only a few weeks longer, and then we shall go back to Leicester.\"  \"I'm in no haste to go,\" declared Mabel. \"I love Cromarty Manor, but I want to stay in London a little longer. But when we do go, Patty, you surely must visit us there.\"  \"Indeed I will, if I can manage it. My parents want me to go with them to Switzerland, but I'd much prefer to spend the summer in England. I have ever so many delightful invitations to country houses, and they seem to me a lot more attractive than travelling about. I suppose I ought to care more about seeing places, but I don't.\"  \"You're quite young enough yet,\" said Mrs. Hartley, \"to look forward to travelling in future years. I think some experiences of English life would be quite as advantageous for you.\"  \"I'll tell father you said that,\" said Patty. \"Then perhaps he'll let me have my own way. But he usually does that, anyway.\"  \"You'd love Cromarty Manor,\" said Bob, enthusiastically. \"It's so beautiful in spring and early summer.\"  \"But not half as grand as other houses where Patty's invited,\" said Mabel, and again the shadow crossed her face that seemed always to come when she spoke of her country home.  \"Grandeur doesn't count in the country,\" declared Bob. \"That belongs to London life. Other places may be larger or in better condition than ours, but they _can't_ be more beautiful.\"  \"That is true,\" said Mrs. Cromarty, in her quiet way, which always seemed to decide a disputed point. And then it was time to go home, and Mrs. Hartley sent Patty away in her carriage, with a maid to accompany her. The woman was middle-aged, with a pleasant voice and a capable manner. She chatted affably with Patty, and dilated a little on the glories of the Cromarty family.  Patty realised at once that she was an old family servant, and had earned a right to a little more freedom of speech than is usual to English domestics.  \"Oh, yes, Miss,\" she said; \"it's a wonnerful old place, that it is. And if the dear lady only 'ad the money as is 'ers by right, she'd keep it up lordly, that she would.\"  Patty wondered what had become of the money in question, but Sarah said no more concerning it, and Patty felt she had no right to ask. \"You live with them, then, in the country?\" she said.  \"Yes, Miss, I've allus lived with them. My mother was housekeeper at the Manor when Miss Emmeline married Mr. 'Artley. Oh, he was the fine gentleman. Dead now, this ten year come Whitsuntide. Master Bob, he's the image of his father. Are you warm enough, Miss?\"  Sarah's quick transit from reminiscences to solicitude for her comfort almost startled Patty, but she was getting used to that peculiarity of the British mind.  \"Yes, thank you,\" she said, \"and anyway, we're home now. Here's the Savoy.\"  Mr. Fairfield and Nan had not yet arrived, so the good Sarah attended Patty to her own apartment and gave her over to Louise, who awaited her coming.  Louise helped her off with her pretty frock, and brought her a beribboned négligée, and Patty curled up in a big armchair in front of the fire to think over the evening.  \"These wood-fires are lovely,\" she said to herself, \"and they do have most comfortable stuffed chairs over here, if they only knew enough to put rockers under them.\"  Patty was a comfort-loving creature, and often bewailed the absence of the rocking-chairs so dear to her American heart. Soon her parents came in and found her sound asleep in the big chair.  She woke up, as her father kissed her lightly on the forehead.  \"Hello, Prince Charming,\" she said, smiling gaily at the handsome man in evening clothes who stood looking down at her.  \"I suppose you want a return compliment about the Sleeping Beauty,\" he said, \"but you won't get it. Too much flattery isn't good for a baby like you, and I shall reserve my pretty speeches for my wife.\"  \"Oh, I'll share them with Patty,\" laughed Nan, \"but with no one else.\"  \"Tell us about your evening, girlie,\" said her father. \"Did you have a good time?\"  \"Fine,\" said Patty. \"The Hartleys are lovely people; I like them better than any I've met in London, so far. And they do puzzles, and ask riddles, and they're just as clever and quick as Americans. I've heard that English people were heavy and stupid, and they're not, a bit.\"  \"You mustn't believe all you hear. Are they a large family?\" \"Not very. Two sons, one daughter, and the mother and grandmother. Mabel's father has been dead for years. And they want me to visit them at their home in Leicester this summer. Can't I go?\"  \"Desert your own family for foreigners!\"  \"Yes; I do want to go there and to some other country places while you and Nan go touristing about. Mayn't I?\"  \"We won't decide now. It's too near midnight for important matters to be discussed. Skip to bed, chickabiddy, and dream of the Stars and Stripes, lest you forget them entirely.\"  \"Never!\" cried Patty, striking a dramatic attitude.                    \"Though English people may be grand,                   My heart is in my native land!\"  And humming the Star-spangled Banner, she went away to her own room.     CHAPTER III  THE WHITE LADY   \"I feel in a gay mood,\" said Nan, as she clasped Patty round the waist, and always ready for a dance, Patty fell into step, and the two waltzed round the"]]]
