Eric helped Nada to a place on the crystal, lay down at her side.  \"I think the Express Ray is focused just at the surface of the crystal, from below,\" he said. \"It dissolves our substance, to be transmitted by the beam. It would look as if we were melting into the crystal.\"  \"Ready,\" called the youth. \"Think I've got it for you. Sort of a high island in the jungle. Nothing bad in sight now. But, I say--how're you coming back? I haven't got time to watch you.\"  \"Go ahead. We aren't coming back.\"  \"Gee! What is it? Elopement? I thought you were married already. Or is it business difficulties? The Bears did make an awful raid last night. But you better let me set you down in Hong Kong.\"  A bell jangled. \"So long,\" the youth called.  Nada and Eric felt themselves enveloped in fire. Sheets of white flame seemed to lap up about them from the crystal block. Suddenly there was a sharp tingling sensation where they touched the polished surface. Then blackness, blankness.         *       *       *       *       *  The next thing they knew, the fires were gone from about them. They were lying in something extremely soft and fluid; and warm rain was beating in their faces. Eric sat up, found himself in a mud-puddle. Beside him was Nada, opening her eyes and struggling up, her bright garments stained with black mud.  All about rose a thick jungle, dark and gloomy--and very wet. Palm-like, the gigantic trees were, or fern-like, flinging clouds of feathery green foliage high against a somber sky of unbroken gloom.  They stood up, triumphant.  \"At last!\" Nada cried. \"We're free! Free of that hateful old civilization! We're back to Nature!\"  \"Yes, we're on our feet now, not parasites on the machines.\"  \"It's wonderful to have a fine, strong man like you to trust in, Eric. You're just like one of the heroes in your books!\"  \"You're the perfect companion, Nada.... But now we must be practical. We must build a fire, find weapons, set up a shelter of some kind. I guess it will be night, pretty soon. And Charley said something about savage animals he had seen in the television.  \"We'll find a nice dry cave, and have a fire in front of the door. And skins of animals to sleep on. And pottery vessels to cook in. And you will find seeds and grown grain.\"  \"But first we must find a flint-bed. We need flint for tools, and to strike sparks to make a fire with. We will probably come across a chunk of virgin copper, too--it's found native.\"  Presently they set off through the jungle. The mud seemed to be very abundant, and of a most sticky consistence. They sank into it ankle deep at every step, and vast masses of it clung to their feet. A mile they struggled on, without finding where a provident nature had left them even a single fragment of quartz, to say nothing of a mass of pure copper.  \"A darned shame,\" Eric grumbled, \"to come forty million miles, and meet such a reception as this!\"  Nada stopped. \"Eric,\" she said, \"I'm tired. And I don't believe there's any rock here, anyway. You'll have to use wooden tools, sharpened in the fire.\"  \"Probably you're right. This soil seemed to be of alluvial origin. Shouldn't be surprised if the native rock is some hundreds of feet underground. Your idea is better.\"  \"You can make a fire by rubbing sticks together, can't you?\"  \"It can be done, I'm sure. I've never tried it, myself. We need some dry sticks, first.\"  They resumed the weary march, with a good fraction of the new planet adhering to their feet. Rain was still falling from the dark heavens in a steady, warm downpour. Dry wood seemed scarce as the proverbial hen's teeth.  \"You didn't bring any matches, dear?\"  \"Matches! Of course not! We're going back to Nature.\"  \"I hope we get a fire pretty soon.\"  \"If dry wood were gold dust, we couldn't buy a hot dog.\"  \"Eric, that reminds me that I'm hungry.\"  He confessed to a few pangs of his own. They turned their attention to looking for banana trees, and coconut palms, but they did not seem to abound in the Venerian jungle. Even small animals that might have been slain with a broken branch had contrary ideas about the matter.  At last, from sheer weariness, they stopped, and gathered branches to make a sloping shelter by a vast fallen tree-trunk.  \"This will keep out the rain--maybe--\" Eric said hopefully. \"And tomorrow, when it has quit raining--I'm sure we'll do better.\"  They crept in, as gloomy night fell without. They lay in each other's arms, the body warmth oddly comforting. Nada cried a little.  \"Buck up,\" Eric advised her. \"We're back to nature--where we've always wanted to be.\"         *       *       *       *       *  With the darkness, the temperature fell somewhat, and a high wind rose, whipping cold rain into the little shelter, and threatening to demolish it. Swarms of mosquito-like insects, seemingly not inconvenienced in the least by the inclement elements, swarmed about them in clouds.  Then came a sound from the dismal stormy night, a hoarse, bellowing roar, raucous, terrifying.  Nada clung against Eric. \"What is it, dear?\" she chattered.  \"Must be a reptile. Dinosaur, or something of the sort. This world seems to be in about the same state as the Earth when they flourished there.... But maybe it won't find us.\"  The roar was repeated, nearer. The earth trembled beneath a mighty tread.  \"Eric,\" a thin voice trembled. \"Don't you think--it might have been better-- You know the old life was not so bad, after all.\"  \"I was just thinking of our rooms, nice and warm and bright, with hot foods coming up the shaft whenever we pushed the button, and the gay crowds in the park, and my old typewriter.\"  \"Eric?\" she called softly.  \"Yes, dear.\"  \"Don't you wish--we had known better?\"  \"I do.\" If he winced at the \"we\" the girl did not notice.  The roaring outside was closer. And suddenly it was answered by another raucous bellow, at considerable distance, that echoed strangely through the forest. The fearful sounds were repeated, alternately. And always the more distant seemed nearer, until the two sounds were together.  And then an infernal din broke out in the darkness. Bellows. Screams. Deafening shrieks. Mighty splashes, as if struggling Titans had upset oceans. Thunderous crashes, as if they were demolishing forests.  Eric and Nada clung to each other, in doubt whether to stay or to fly through the storm. Gradually the sound of the conflict came nearer, until the earth shook beneath them, and they were afraid to move.  Suddenly the great fallen tree against which they had erected the flimsy shelter was rolled back, evidently by a chance blow from the invisible monsters. The pitiful roof collapsed on the bedraggled humans. Nada burst into tears.  \"Oh, if only--if only--\"         *       *       *       *       *  Suddenly flame lapped up about them, the same white fire they had seen as they lay on the crystal block. Dizziness, insensibility overcame them. A few moments later, they were lying on the transparent table in the Cosmic Express office, with all those great mirrors and prisms and lenses about them.  A bustling, red-faced official appeared through the door in the grill, fairly bubbling apologies.  \"So sorry--an accident--inconceivable. I can't see how he got it! We got you back as soon as we could find a focus. I sincerely hope you haven't been injured.\"  \"Why--what--what--\"  \"Why I happened in, found our operator drunk. I've no idea where he got the stuff. He muttered something about Venus. I consulted the auto-register, and found two more passengers registered here than had been recorded at our other stations. I looked up the duplicate beam coordinates, and found that it had been set on Venus. I got men on the television at once, and we happened to find you.  \"I can't imagine how it happened. I've had the fellow locked up, and the 'dry-laws' are on the job. I hope you won't hold us for excessive damages.\"  \"No, I ask nothing except that you don't press charges against the boy. I don't want him to suffer for it in any way. My wife and I will be perfectly satisfied to get back to our apartment.\"  \"I don't wonder. You look like you've been through--I don't know what. But I'll have you there in five minutes. My private car--\"         *       *       *       *       *  Mr. Eric Stokes-Harding, noted author of primitive life and love, ate a hearty meal with his pretty spouse, after they had washed off the grime of another planet. He spent the next twelve hours in bed.  At the end of the month he delivered his promised story to his publishers, a thrilling tale of a man marooned on Venus, with a beautiful girl. The hero made stone tools, erected a dwelling for himself and his mate, hunted food for her, defended her from the mammoth saurian monsters of the Venerian jungles.  The book was a huge success."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2607"],["title","Psmith, Journalist (#1)"],["body","other cheap skates. We take this opportunity of once more informing Jim that he is a liar and a skunk,\" and whose editor works with a revolver on his desk and another in his hip-pocket. Graduating from this, he had proceeded to a reporter's post on a daily paper in a Kentucky town, where there were blood feuds and other Southern devices for preventing life from becoming dull. All this time New York, the magnet, had been tugging at him. All reporters dream of reaching New York. At last, after four years on the Kentucky paper, he had come East, minus the lobe of one ear and plus a long scar that ran diagonally across his left shoulder, and had worked without much success as a free-lance. He was tough and ready for anything that might come his way, but these things are a great deal a matter of luck. The cub-reporter cannot make a name for himself unless he is favoured by fortune. Things had not come Billy Windsor's way. His work had been confined to turning in reports of fires and small street accidents, which the various papers to which he supplied them cut down to a couple of inches.  Billy had been in a bad way when he had happened upon the sub-editorship of _Cosy Moments_. He despised the work with all his heart, and the salary was infinitesimal. But it was regular, and for a while Billy felt that a regular salary was the greatest thing on earth. But he still dreamed of winning through to a post on one of the big New York dailies, where there was something doing and a man would have a chance of showing what was in him.  The unfortunate thing, however, was that _Cosy Moments_ took up his time so completely. He had no chance of attracting the notice of big editors by his present work, and he had no leisure for doing any other.  All of which may go to explain why his normal aspect was that of a caged eagle.  To him, brooding over the outpourings of Luella Granville Waterman, there entered Pugsy Maloney, the office-boy, bearing a struggling cat.  \"Say!\" said Pugsy.  He was a nonchalant youth, with a freckled, mask-like face, the expression of which never varied. He appeared unconscious of the cat. Its existence did not seem to occur to him.  \"Well?\" said Billy, looking up. \"Hello, what have you got there?\"  Master Maloney eyed the cat, as if he were seeing it for the first time.  \"It's a kitty what I got in de street,\" he said.  \"Don't hurt the poor brute. Put her down.\"  Master Maloney obediently dropped the cat, which sprang nimbly on to an upper shelf of the book-case.  \"I wasn't hoitin' her,\" he said, without emotion. \"Dere was two fellers in de street sickin' a dawg on to her. An' I comes up an' says, 'G'wan! What do youse t'ink you're doin', fussin' de poor dumb animal?' An' one of de guys, he says, 'G'wan! Who do youse t'ink youse is?' An' I says, 'I'm de guy what's goin' to swat youse one on de coco if youse don't quit fussin' de poor dumb animal.' So wit dat he makes a break at swattin' me one, but I swats him one, an' I swats de odder feller one, an' den I swats dem bote some more, an' I gets de kitty, an' I brings her in here, cos I t'inks maybe youse'll look after her.\"  And having finished this Homeric narrative, Master Maloney fixed an expressionless eye on the ceiling, and was silent.  Billy Windsor, like most men of the plains, combined the toughest of muscle with the softest of hearts. He was always ready at any moment to become the champion of the oppressed on the slightest provocation. His alliance with Pugsy Maloney had begun on the occasion when he had rescued that youth from the clutches of a large negro, who, probably from the soundest of motives, was endeavouring to slay him. Billy had not inquired into the rights and wrongs of the matter: he had merely sailed in and rescued the office-boy. And Pugsy, though he had made no verbal comment on the affair, had shown in many ways that he was not ungrateful.  \"Bully for you, Pugsy!\" he cried. \"You're a little sport. Here\"--he produced a dollar-bill--\"go out and get some milk for the poor brute. She's probably starving. Keep the change.\"  \"Sure thing,\" assented Master Maloney. He strolled slowly out, while Billy Windsor, mounting a chair, proceeded to chirrup and snap his fingers in the effort to establish the foundations of an _entente cordiale_ with the rescued cat.  By the time that Pugsy returned, carrying a five-cent bottle of milk, the animal had vacated the book-shelf, and was sitting on the table, washing her face. The milk having been poured into the lid of a tobacco-tin, in lieu of a saucer, she suspended her operations and adjourned for refreshments. Billy, business being business, turned again to Luella Granville Waterman, but Pugsy, having no immediate duties on hand, concentrated himself on the cat.  \"Say!\" he said.  \"Well?\"  \"Dat kitty.\"  \"What about her?\"  \"Pipe de leather collar she's wearing.\"  Billy had noticed earlier in the proceedings that a narrow leather collar encircled the cat's neck. He had not paid any particular attention to it. \"What about it?\" he said.  \"Guess I know where dat kitty belongs. Dey all have dose collars. I guess she's one of Bat Jarvis's kitties. He's got a lot of dem for fair, and every one wit one of dem collars round deir neck.\"  \"Who's Bat Jarvis? Do you mean the gang-leader?\"  \"Sure. He's a cousin of mine,\" said Master Maloney with pride.  \"Is he?\" said Billy. \"Nice sort of fellow to have in the family. So you think that's his cat?\"  \"Sure. He's got twenty-t'ree of dem, and dey all has dose collars.\"  \"Are you on speaking terms with the gentleman?\"  \"Huh?\"  \"Do you know Bat Jarvis to speak to?\"  \"Sure. He's me cousin.\"  \"Well, tell him I've got the cat, and that if he wants it he'd better come round to my place. You know where I live?\"  \"Sure.\"  \"Fancy you being a cousin of Bat's, Pugsy. Why did you never tell us? Are you going to join the gang some day?\"  \"Nope. Nothin' doin'. I'm goin' to be a cow-boy.\"  \"Good for you. Well, you tell him when you see him. And now, my lad, out you get, because if I'm interrupted any more I shan't get through to-night.\"  \"Sure,\" said Master Maloney, retiring.  \"Oh, and Pugsy . . .\"  \"Huh?\"  \"Go out and get a good big basket. I shall want one to carry this animal home in.\"  \"Sure,\" said Master Maloney.    CHAPTER III  AT \"THE GARDENIA\"  \"It would ill beseem me, Comrade Jackson,\" said Psmith, thoughtfully sipping his coffee, \"to run down the metropolis of a great and friendly nation, but candour compels me to state that New York is in some respects a singularly blighted town.\"  \"What's the matter with it?\" asked Mike.  \"Too decorous, Comrade Jackson. I came over here principally, it is true, to be at your side, should you be in any way persecuted by scoundrels. But at the same time I confess that at the back of my mind there lurked a hope that stirring adventures might come my way. I had heard so much of the place. Report had it that an earnest seeker after amusement might have a tolerably spacious rag in this modern Byzantium. I thought that a few weeks here might restore that keen edge to my nervous system which the languor of the past term had in a measure blunted. I wished my visit to be a tonic rather than a sedative. I anticipated that on my return the cry would go round Cambridge, 'Psmith has been to New York. He is full of oats. For he on honey-dew hath fed, and drunk the milk of Paradise. He is hot stuff. Rah!' But what do we find?\"  He paused, and lit a cigarette.  \"What do we find?\" he asked again.  \"I don't know,\" said Mike. \"What?\"  \"A very judicious query, Comrade Jackson. What, indeed? We find a town very like London. A quiet, self-respecting town, admirable to the apostle of social reform, but disappointing to one who, like myself, arrives with a brush and a little bucket of red paint, all eager for a treat. I have been here a week, and I have not seen a single citizen clubbed by a policeman. No negroes dance cake-walks in the street. No cow-boy has let off his revolver at random in Broadway. The cables flash the message across the ocean, 'Psmith is losing his illusions.'\"  Mike had come to America with a team of the M.C.C. which was touring the cricket-playing section of the United States. Psmith had accompanied him in a private capacity. It was the end of their first year at Cambridge, and Mike, with a century against Oxford to his credit, had been one of the first to be invited to join the tour. Psmith, who had played cricket in a rather desultory way at the University, had not risen to these heights. He had merely taken the opportunity of Mike's visit to the other side to accompany him. Cambridge had proved pleasant to Psmith, but a trifle quiet. He had welcomed the chance of getting a change of scene.  So far the visit had failed to satisfy him. Mike, whose tastes in pleasure were simple, was delighted with everything. The cricket so far had been rather of the picnic order, but it was very pleasant; and there was no limit to the hospitality with which the visitors were treated. It was this more than anything which had caused Psmith's grave disapproval of things American. He was not a member of the team, so that the advantages of the hospitality did not reach him. He had all the disadvantages. He saw far too little of Mike. When he wished to consult his confidential secretary and adviser on some aspect of Life, that invaluable official was generally absent at dinner with the rest of the team. To-night was one of the rare occasions when Mike could get away. Psmith was becoming bored. New York is a better city than London to be alone in, but it is never pleasant to be alone in any big city.  As they sat discussing New York's shortcomings over their coffee, a young man passed them, carrying a basket, and seated himself at the next table. He was a tall, loose-jointed young man, with unkempt hair.  A waiter made an ingratiating gesture towards the basket, but the young man stopped him. \"Not on your life, sonny,\" he said. \"This stays right here.\""]]]
