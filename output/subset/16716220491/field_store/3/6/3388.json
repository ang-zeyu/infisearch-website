Their very existence has been forgotten. The people who built them have long since passed away, and their civilization is but a shadowy tradition. Historians are astounded that a nation of an hundred million beings should vanish from the earth like a mist, and leave so little behind. But to those familiar with their lives and character surprise is impossible. There was nothing to leave. The Mehrikans possessed neither literature, art, nor music of their own. Everything was borrowed. The very clothes they wore were copied with ludicrous precision from the models of other nations. They were a sharp, restless, quick-witted, greedy race, given body and soul to the gathering of riches. Their chiefest passion was to buy and sell. Even women, both of high and low degree, spent much of their time at bargains, crowding and jostling each other in vast marts of trade, for their attire was complicated, and demanded most of their time.\"  \"How degrading!\" I exclaimed.  \"So it must have been,\" said Nōfūhl; \"but they were not without virtues. Their domestic life was happy. A man had but one wife, and treated her as his equal.\"  \"That is curious! But as I remember, they were a people of elastic honor.\"  \"They were so considered,\" said Nōfūhl; \"their commercial honor was a jest. They were sharper than the Turks. Prosperity was their god, with cunning and invention for his prophets. Their restless activity no Persian can comprehend. This vast country was alive with noisy industries, the nervous Mehrikans darting with inconceivable rapidity from one city to another by a system of locomotion we can only guess at. There existed roads with iron rods upon them, over which small houses on wheels were drawn with such velocity that a long day's journey was accomplished in an hour. Enormous ships without sails, driven by a mysterious force, bore hundreds of people at a time to the furthermost points of the earth.\"  \"And are these things lost?\" I asked.  \"We know many of the forces,\" said Nōfūhl, \"but the knowledge of applying them is gone. The very elements seem to have been their slaves. Cities were illuminated at night by artificial moons, whose radiance eclipsed the moon above. Strange devices were in use by which they conversed together when separated by a journey of many days. Some of these appliances exist to-day in Persian museums. The superstitions of our ancestors allowed their secrets to be lost during those dark centuries from which at last we are waking.\"  At this point we heard the voice of Bhoz-jā-khāz in the distance; they had found a spring and he was calling to us.  Such heat we had never felt, and it grew hotter each hour. Near the river where we ate it was more comfortable, but even there the perspiration stood upon us in great drops. Our faces shone like fishes. It was our wish to explore further, but the streets were like ovens, and we returned to the _Zlōtuhb_.   As I sat upon the deck this afternoon recording the events of the morning in this journal Bhoz-jā-khāz and Ad-el-pate approached, asking permission to take the small boat and visit the great statue. Thereupon Nōfūhl informed us that this statue in ancient times held aloft a torch illuminating the whole harbor, and he requested Ad-el-pate to try and discover how the light was accomplished.  They returned toward evening with this information: that the statue is not of solid bronze, but hollow; that they ascended by means of an iron stairway into the head of the image, and from the top looked down upon us; that Ad-el-pate, in the dark, sat to rest himself upon a nest of yellow flies with black stripes; that these flies inserted stings into Ad-el-pate's person, causing him to exclaim loudly and descend the stairs with unexpected agility; that Bhoz-jā-khāz and the others pushed on through the upraised arm, and stood at last upon the bronze torch itself; that the city lay beneath them like a map, covering the country for miles away on both sides of the river. As for illuminating the harbor, Bhoz-jā-khāz says Nōfūhl is mistaken; there are no vestiges of anything that could give a light--no vessel for oil or traces of fire.  Nōfūhl says Jā-khāz is an idiot; that he shall go himself.  [Illustration: \"The great statue in the harbor.\"]     _13th May_    A startling discovery this morning.  By landing higher up the river we explored a part of the city where the buildings are of a different character from those we saw yesterday. Nōfūhl considers them the dwellings of the rich. In shape they are like bricks set on end, all very similar, uninteresting, and monotonous.  We noticed one where the doors and shutters were still in place, but rotting from the fantastic hinges that supported them. A few hard blows brought down the outer doors in a dusty heap, and as we stepped upon the marble floor within our eyes met an unexpected sight. Furniture, statues, dingy pictures in crumbling frames, images in bronze and silver, mirrors, curtains, all were there, but in every condition of decay. We knocked open the iron shutters and let the light into the rooms sealed up for centuries. In the first one lay a rug from Persia! Faded, moth-eaten, gone in places, it seemed to ask us with dying eyes to be taken hence. My heart grew soft over the ancient rug, and I caught a foolish look in Lev-el-Hedyd's eye.  As we climbed the mouldering stair to the floor above I expressed surprise that cloth and woodwork should hold together for so many centuries, also saying:  \"These Mehrikans were not so unworthy as we think them.\"  \"That may be,\" said Lev-el-Hedyd, \"but the Persian rug is far the freshest object we have seen, and that perchance was ancient when they bought it.\"  On this floor we entered a dim chamber, spacious and once richly furnished. When Lev-el-Hedyd pushed open the shutters and drew aside the ragged curtains we started at the sight before us. Upon a wide bed in the centre of the room lay a human form, the long, yellow hair still clinging to the head. It was more a mummy than a skeleton. Around, upon the bed, lay mouldering fragments of the once white sheets that covered it. On the fingers of the left hand glistened two rings which drew our attention. One held a diamond of great price, the other was composed of sapphires and diamonds most curiously arranged. We stood a moment in silence, gazing sadly upon the figure.  \"Poor woman,\" I said, \"left thus to die alone.\"  \"It is more probable,\" said Nōfūhl, \"she was already dead, and her friends, departing perhaps in haste, were unable to burn the body.\"  \"Did they burn their dead?\" I asked. \"In my history 't was writ they buried them in the earth like potatoes, and left them to rot.\"  And Nōfūhl answered: \"At one time it was so, but later on, as they became more civilized, the custom was abandoned.\"  \"Is it possible?\" I asked, \"that this woman has been lying here almost a thousand years and yet so well preserved?\"  \"I, also, am surprised,\" said Nōfūhl. \"I can only account for it by the extreme dryness of the air in absorbing the juices of the body and retarding decay.\"  [Illustration: In the Mouldering Chamber]  Then lifting tenderly in his hand some of the yellow hair, he said:  \"She was probably very young, scarce twenty.\"  \"Were their women fair?\" I asked.  \"They were beautiful,\" he answered; \"with graceful forms and lovely faces; a pleasure to the eye; also were they gay and sprightly with much animation.\"  Thereupon cried Lev-el-Hedyd:  \"Here are the first words thou hast uttered, O Nōfūhl, that cause me to regret the extinction of this people! There is ever a place in my heart for a blushing maiden!\"  \"Then let thy grief be of short life,\" responded Nōfūhl, \"for Mehrikan damsels were not of that description. Blushing was an art they practised little. The shyness thou so lovest in a Persian maiden was to them an unknown thing. Our shrinking daughters bear no resemblance to these Western products. They strode the public streets with roving eyes and unblushing faces, holding free converse with men as with women, bold of speech and free of manner, going and coming as it pleased them best. They knew much of the world, managed their own affairs, and devised their own marriages, often changing their minds and marrying another than the betrothed.\"  \"Bismillah! And men could love these things?\" exclaimed Lev-el-Hedyd with much feeling.  \"So it appears.\"  \"But I should say the Mehrikan bride had much the freshness of a dried fig.\"  \"So she had,\" said Nōfūhl; \"but those who know only the dried fig have no regret for the fresh fruit. But the fault was not with the maidens. Brought up like boys, with the same studies and mental development, the womanly part of their nature gradually vanished as their minds expanded. Vigor of intellect was the object of a woman's education.\"  Then Lev-el-Hedyd exclaimed with great disgust:  \"Praises be to Allah for his aid in exterminating such a people!\" and he walked away from the bed, and began looking about the chamber. In a moment he hastened back to us, saying:  \"Here are more jewels! also money!\"  Nōfūhl eagerly took the pieces.  \"Money!\" he cried. \"Money will tell us more than pages of history!\"  There were silver coins of different sizes and two small pieces of copper. Nōfūhl studied them closely.  \"The latest date is 1957,\" he said; \"a little less than a thousand years ago; but the piece may have been in circulation some years before this woman died; also it may have been coined the very year of her death. It bears the head of Dennis, the last of the Hy-Burnyan dictators. The "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27307"],["title","The Last American (#2)"],["body","is supposed to have become extinct before 1990 of their era.\"  [Illustration: The Face and Back of One of the Silver Coins.]  I then said:  \"Thou hast never told us, O Nōfūhl! the cause of their disappearance.\"  \"There were many causes,\" he answered. \"The Mehrikans themselves were of English origin, but people from all parts of Europe came here in vast numbers. Although the original comers were vigorous and hardy the effect of climate upon succeeding generations was fatal. They became flat-chested and thin, with scanty hair, fragile teeth, and weak digestions. Nervous diseases unknown to us wrought deadly havoc. Children were reared with difficulty. Between 1945 and 1960, the last census of which any record remains, the population decreased from ninety millions to less than twelve millions. Climatic changes, the like of which no other land ever experienced, began at that period, and finished in less than ten years a work made easy by nervous natures and rapid lives. The temperature would skip in a single day from burning heat to winter's cold. No constitution could withstand it, and this vast continent became once more an empty wilderness.\"   Much more of the same nature he told us, but I am too sleepy to write longer. We explored the rest of the mansion, finding many things of interest. I caused several objects to be carried aboard the _Zlōtuhb_. (These objects are now in the museum of the Imperial College, at Teheran.)     _14th May_    Hotter than yesterday.  In the afternoon we were rowed up the river and landed for a short walk. It is unsafe to brave the sun.  The more I learn of these Mehrikans the less interesting they become. Nōfūhl is of much the same mind, judging from our conversation to-day, as we walked along together.  It was in this wise:  _Khan-li_. How alike the houses! How monotonous!  _Nōfūhl_. So, also, were the occupants. They thought alike, worked alike, ate, dressed and conversed alike. They read the same books; they fashioned their garments as directed, with no regard for the size or figure of the individual, and copied to a stitch the fashions of Europeans.  _Khan-li_. But the close-fitting apparel of the European must have been sadly uncomfortable in the heat of a Mehrikan summer.  _Nōfūhl_. So probably it was. Stiff boxes of varying patterns adorned the heads of men. Curious jackets with tight sleeves compressed the body. The feet throbbed and burned in close-fitting casings of unyielding leather, and linen made stiff by artificial means was drawn tightly about the neck.  _Khan-li_. Allah! What idiots!  _Nōfūhl_. Even so are they considered.  _Khan-li_. To what quality of their minds do you attribute such love of needless suffering?  _Nōfūhl_. It was their desire to be like others. A natural feeling in a vulgar people.     _15th May_    A fair wind from the West to-day.  We weighed anchor and sailed up the Eastern side of the city. I did this as Nōfūhl finds the upper portion of the town much richer in relics than the lower, which seems to have been given up to commercial purposes. We sailed close under one of the great monuments in the river, and are at a loss to divine its meaning. Many iron rods still dangle from the tops of each of the structures. As they are in a line, one with the other, we thought at first they might have been once connected and served as a bridge, but we soon saw they were too far apart.  Came to anchor about three miles from the old mooring. Up the river and down, North, South, East, and West, the ruins stretch away indefinitely, seemingly without end.  Am anxious about Lev-el-Hedyd. He went ashore and has not returned. It is now after midnight.  [Illustration: The Two Monuments in the River]     _16th May_    Praise Allah! my dear comrade is alive! This morning we landed early and began our search for him. As we passed before the building which bears the inscription      . . . DORF ASTORIA  upon its front, we heard his voice from within in answer to our calls. We entered, and after climbing the ruined stairway found him seated upon the floor above. He had a swollen leg from an ugly sprain, and various bruises were also his. While our friends were constructing a litter on which to bear him hence we conversed together. The walls about us bore traces of having once enclosed a hall of some beauty. In idling about I pulled open the decaying door of an old closet and saw upon the rotting shelves many pieces of glass and earthenware of fine workmanship. Taking one in my hand, a small wine-cup of glass, I approached my comrade calling his attention to its slender stem and curious form. As his eyes fell upon it they opened wide in amazement. I also observed a trembling of his hand as he reached forth to touch it. He then recounted to me his marvellous adventure of the night before, but saying before he began:  \"Thou knowest, O Prince, I am no believer in visions, and I should never tell the tale but for thy discovery of this cup. I drank from such an one last night, proffered by a ghostly hand.\"  I would have smiled, but he was much in earnest. As I made a movement to sit beside him, he said:  \"Taste first, O my master, of the grapes hanging from yonder wall.\"  I did so, and to my great surprise found them of an exquisite flavor, finer even than the cultivated fruit of Persia, sweeter and more delicate, of a different nature from the wild grapes we have been eating. My astonishment appeared to delight him, and he said with a laugh:  \"The grapes are impossible, but they exist; even more absurd is my story!\" and he then narrated his adventure.  It was this:  WHAT LEV-EL-HEDYD SAW.  Yesterday, after nightfall, as he was hastening toward the _Zlōtuhb_ he fell violently upon some blocks of stone, wrenching his ankle and much bruising himself. Unable to walk upon his foot he limped into this building to await our coming in the morning. The howling of wolves and other wild beasts as they prowled about the city drove him, for safety, to crawl up the ruins of the stairway to the floor above. As he settled himself in a corner of this hall his nostrils were greeted with the delicious odor from the grapes about his head. He found them surprisingly good, and ate heartily. He soon after fell into a sleep which lasted some hours, for when he awoke the moon was higher in the heavens, the voices of the wolves were hushed and the city was silent.  As he lay in a revery, much absorbed in his own thoughts, he gradually became aware of mysterious changes taking place, as if by stealth, about him. A decorated ceiling appeared to be closing over the hall. Mirrors and tinted walls slowly crept in place of ivy and crumbling bricks. A faint glow grew stronger and more intense until it filled the great room with a dazzling light.  Then came softly into view a table of curious form, set out with flowers and innumerable dishes of glass and porcelain, as for a feast.  Standing about the room he saw solemn men with beardless faces, all in black attire, whose garments bore triangular openings upon the chest to show the shirt beneath. These personages he soon discovered were servants.  As he gazed in bewilderment, there entered other figures, two by two, who took their seats about the table. These later comers, sixty or more, were men and women walking arm in arm, the women in rich attire of unfamiliar fashion and sparkling with precious stones. The men were clad like the servants.  They ate and drank and laughed, and formed a brilliant scene. Lev-el-Hedyd rose to his feet, and moved by a curiosity he made no effort to resist,--for he is a reckless fellow and knows no fear--he hobbled out into the room.  They looked upon him in surprise, and seemed much amused at his presence. One of the guests, a tall youth with yellow mustaches, approached him, offering a delicate crystal vessel filled with a sparkling fluid.  Lev-el-Hedyd took it.  The youth raised another from the table and with a slight gesture as if in salutation, he said in words which my comrade understood, though he swears it was a language unknown to him,  \"We may meet again the fourth of next month.\"  He then drank the wine, and so did Lev-el-Hedyd.  Hereupon the others smiled as if at their comrade's wit, all save the women, whose tender faces spoke more of pity than of mirth. The wine flew to his brain as he drank it, and things about him seemed to reel and spin. Strains of fantastic music burst upon his ears: then, all in rhythm, the women joined their partners and whirled about him with a lightsome step. And, moving with it, his throbbing brain seemed dancing from his head. The room itself, all swaying and quivering with the melody, grew dim and stole from view. The music softly died away.  Again was silence, the moon above looking calmly down upon the ivied walls.  He fell like a drunken man upon the floor, and did not wake till our voices called him.   Such his tale.  He has a clear head and is no liar, but so many grapes upon an empty stomach with the fever from his swollen limb might well explain it.      *   *   *   *   *  Bear's meat for dinner.  This morning toward noon Kuzundam, the second officer, wandered on ahead of us, and entered a large building in pursuit of a rabbit. He was about descending to the basement below, when he saw, close before him, a bear leisurely mounting the marble stairs. Kuzundam is no coward, but he turned and ran as he never ran before. The bear, who seemed of a sportive nature, also ran, and in close pursuit. Luckily for my friend we happened to be near, otherwise instead of our eating bear's meat, the bear might have lunched quietly off Kuzundam in the shady corridors of the \"FIFTHAVENUEHOTEL.\"  [Illustration: Kuzundam's Narrow Escape]     _17th May_    To-day a scorching heat that burns the lungs. We started in the morning prepared to spend the night ashore, and explore the northern end of the city. It was a pleasant walk through the soft grass of the shady streets, but in those places"]]]
