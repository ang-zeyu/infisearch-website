The other, she who was writing, looked at her turbulent companion with an eye as limpid, as pure, and as blue as the azure of the day. Her hair, of a shaded fairness, arranged with exquisite taste, fell in silky curls over her lovely mantling cheeks; she passed across the paper a delicate hand, whose thinness announced her extreme youth. At each burst of laughter that proceeded from her friend, she raised, as if annoyed, her white shoulders in a poetical and mild manner, but they were wanting in that richfulness of mold that was likewise to be wished in her arms and hands.  “Montalais! Montalais!” said she at length, in a voice soft and caressing as a melody, “you laugh too loud—you laugh like a man! You will not only draw the attention of messieurs the guards, but you will not hear Madame’s bell when Madame rings.”  This admonition neither made the young girl called Montalais cease to laugh nor gesticulate. She only replied: “Louise, you do not speak as you think, my dear; you know that messieurs the guards, as you call them, have only just commenced their sleep, and that a cannon would not waken them; you know that Madame’s bell can be heard at the bridge of Blois, and that consequently I shall hear it when my services are required by Madame. What annoys you, my child, is that I laugh while you are writing; and what you are afraid of is that Madame de Saint-Remy, your mother, should come up here, as she does sometimes when we laugh too loud, that she should surprise us, and that she should see that enormous sheet of paper upon which, in a quarter of an hour, you have only traced the words Monsieur Raoul. Now, you are right, my dear Louise, because after these words, ‘Monsieur Raoul’, others may be put so significant and incendiary as to cause Madame Saint-Remy to burst out into fire and flames! Hein! is not that true now?—say.”  And Montalais redoubled her laughter and noisy provocations.  The fair girl at length became quite angry; she tore the sheet of paper on which, in fact, the words “Monsieur Raoul” were written in good characters; and crushing the paper in her trembling hands, she threw it out of the window.  “There! there!” said Mademoiselle de Montalais; “there is our little lamb, our gentle dove, angry! Don’t be afraid, Louise—Madame de Saint-Remy will not come; and if she should, you know I have a quick ear. Besides, what can be more permissible than to write to an old friend of twelve years’ standing, particularly when the letter begins with the words ‘Monsieur Raoul’?”  “It is all very well—I will not write to him at all,” said the young girl.  “Ah, ah! in good sooth, Montalais is properly punished,” cried the jeering brunette, still laughing. “Come, come! let us try another sheet of paper, and finish our dispatch off-hand. Good! there is the bell ringing now. By my faith, so much the worse! Madame must wait, or else do without her first maid of honor this morning.”  A bell, in fact, did ring; it announced that Madame had finished her toilette, and waited for Monsieur to give her his hand, and conduct her from the salon to the refectory.  This formality being accomplished with great ceremony, the husband and wife breakfasted, and then separated till the hour of dinner, invariably fixed at two o’clock.  The sound of this bell caused a door to be opened in the offices on the left hand of the court, from which filed two maitres d’hotel followed by eight scullions bearing a kind of hand-barrow loaded with dishes under silver covers.  One of the maitres d’hotel, the first in rank, touched one of the guards, who was snoring on his bench, slightly with his wand; he even carried his kindness so far as to place the halbert which stood against the wall in the hands of the man stupid with sleep, after which the soldier, without explanation, escorted the viande of Monsieur to the refectory, preceded by a page and the two maitres d’hotel.  Wherever the viande passed, the soldiers ported arms.  Mademoiselle de Montalais and her companion had watched from their window the details of this ceremony, to which, by the bye, they must have been pretty well accustomed. But they did not look so much from curiosity as to be assured they should not be disturbed. So, guards, scullions, maitres d’hotel, and pages having passed, they resumed their places at the table; and the sun, which, through the window-frame, had for an instant fallen upon those two charming countenances, now only shed its light upon the gilliflowers, primroses, and rose-tree.  “Bah!” said Mademoiselle de Montalais, taking her place again; “Madame will breakfast very well without me!”  “Oh! Montalais, you will be punished!” replied the other girl, sitting down quietly in hers.  “Punished, indeed!—that is to say, deprived of a ride! That is just the way in which I wish to be punished. To go out in the grand coach, perched upon a doorstep; to turn to the left, twist round to the right, over roads full of ruts, where we cannot exceed a league in two hours; and then to come back straight towards the wing of the castle in which is the window of Mary de Medici, so that Madame never fails to say: ‘Could one believe it possible that Mary de Medici should have escaped from that window—forty-seven feet high? The mother of two princes and three princesses!’ If you call that relaxation, Louise, all I ask is to be punished every day; particularly when my punishment is to remain with you and write such interesting letters as we write!”  “Montalais! Montalais! there are duties to be performed.”  “You talk of them very much at your ease, dear child!—you, who are left quite free amidst this tedious court. You are the only person that reaps the advantages of them without incurring the trouble,—you, who are really more one of Madame’s maids of honor than I am, because Madame makes her affection for your father-in-law glance off upon you; so that you enter this dull house as the birds fly into yonder court, inhaling the air, pecking the flowers, picking up the grain, without having the least service to perform, or the least annoyance to undergo. And you talk to me of duties to be performed! In sooth, my pretty idler, what are your own proper duties, unless to write to the handsome Raoul? And even that you don’t do; so that it looks to me as if you likewise were rather negligent of your duties!”  Louise assumed a serious air, leant her chin upon her hand, and, in a tone full of candid remonstrance, “And do you reproach me with my good fortune?” said she. “Can you have the heart to do it? You have a future; you will belong to the court; the king, if he should marry, will require Monsieur to be near his person; you will see splendid fetes, you will see the king, who they say is so handsome, so agreeable!”  “Ay, and still more, I shall see Raoul, who attends upon M. le Prince,” added Montalais, maliciously.  “Poor Raoul!” sighed Louise.  “Now is the time to write to him, my pretty dear! Come, begin again, with that famous ‘Monsieur Raoul’ which figures at the top of the poor torn sheet.”  She then held the pen toward her, and with a charming smile encouraged her hand, which quickly traced the words she named.  “What next?” asked the younger of the two girls.  “Why, now write what you think, Louise,” replied Montalais.  “Are you quite sure I think of anything?”  “You think of somebody, and that amounts to the same thing, or rather even more.”  “Do you think so, Montalais?”  “Louise, Louise, your blue eyes are as deep as the sea I saw at Boulogne last year! No, no, I mistake—the sea is perfidious: your eyes are as deep as the azure yonder—look!—over our heads!”  “Well, since you can read so well in my eyes, tell me what I am thinking about, Montalais.”  “In the first place, you don’t think, Monsieur Raoul; you think, My dear Raoul.”  “Oh!—”  “Never blush for such a trifle as that! ‘My dear Raoul,’ we will say—‘You implore me to write you at Paris, where you are detained by your attendance on M. le Prince. As you must be very dull there, to seek for amusement in the remembrance of a provinciale—’”  Louise rose up suddenly. “No, Montalais,” said she, with a smile; “I don’t think a word of that. Look, this is what I think;” and she seized the pen boldly, and traced, with a firm hand, the following words:  “I should have been very unhappy if your entreaties to obtain a remembrance of me had been less warm. Everything here reminds me of our early days, which so quickly passed away, which so delightfully flew by, that no others will ever replace the charm of them in my heart.”  Montalais, who watched the flying pen, and read, the wrong way upwards, as fast as her friend wrote, here interrupted by clapping her hands. “Capital!” cried she; “there is frankness—there is heart—there is style! Show these Parisians, my dear, that Blois is the city for fine language!”  “He knows very well that Blois was a Paradise to me,” replied the girl.  “That is exactly what you mean to say; and you speak like an angel.”  “I will finish, Montalais,” and she continued as follows: “You often think of me, you say, Monsieur Raoul: I thank you; but that does not surprise me, when I recollect how often our hearts have beaten close to each other.”  “Oh! oh!” said Montalais. “Beware, my lamb! You are scattering your wool, and there are wolves about.”  Louise was about to reply, when the gallop of a horse resounded under the porch of the castle.  “What is that?” said Montalais, approaching the window. “A handsome cavalier, by my faith!”  “Oh!—Raoul!” exclaimed Louise, who had made the same movement as her friend, and, becoming pale as death, sunk back beside her unfinished letter.  “Now, he is a clever lover, upon my word!” cried Montalais; “he arrives just at the proper moment.”  “Come in, come in, I implore you!” murmured Louise.  “Bah! he does not know me. Let me see what he has come here for.”     Chapter II. The Messenger.

Surely a moment's reflection will show you that this is no more barbaric than our other customs regarding our dead.  \"But even this is beside the point. The girl, Alice, whom you married is like a normal human being in every apparent external respect, yet the organs which gave her life and enabled her to function are like nothing encountered before in human experience. It is imperative that we understand the meaning of this. It is yours to say whether or not we shall have this opportunity.\"  Mel started to speak again, but the words wouldn't come out.  \"Time is critical,\" said Dr. Winters, \"but I don't want to force you to an instantaneous answer. Take thirty minutes to think about it. Within that time, additional means of preservation must be taken. I regret that I must be in such haste, but I urge that your answer be yes.\"  Dr. Winters moved towards the door, but Mel gestured for him to remain.  \"I want to see her again,\" Mel said.  \"There is no need. You have been tortured enough. Remember your wife as you have known her all her life, not as you saw her a moment ago.\"  \"If you want my answer let me see her again.\"         *       *       *  Dr. Winters led the way silently back to the cold room. Mel drew down the cover only far enough to expose the face of Alice. There was no mistake. Somehow he had been hoping that all this would turn out to be some monstrous error. But there was no error.  Would she want me to do what the Doctor has asked? he thought. She wouldn't care. She would probably think it a very huge joke that she had been born with innards that made her different from everybody else. She would be amused by the profound probings and mutterings of the learned doctors trying to find an explanation for something that had no explanation.  Mel drew the sheet tenderly over her face.  \"You can do as you wish,\" he said to Dr. Winters. \"It makes no difference to us--to either of us.\"         *       *       *       *       *  The sedative Dr. Winters had given him, plus his own exhaustion, drove Mel to sleep for a few hours during the afternoon, but by evening he was awake again and knew that a night of sleeplessness lay ahead of him. He couldn't stand to spend it in the house, with all its fresh reminders of Alice.  He walked out into the street as it began to get dark. Walking was easy; almost no one did it any more. The rush of private and commercial cars swarmed overhead and rumbled in the ground beneath. He was an isolated anachronism walking silently at the edge of the great city.  He was sick of it. He would have liked to have turned his back on the city and left it forever. Alice had felt the same. But there was nowhere to go. News reporting was the only thing he knew, and news occurred only in the great, ugly cities of the world. The farmlands, such as he and Alice had known when they were young, produced nothing of interest to the satiated denizens of the towns and cities. Nothing except food, and much of this was now being produced by great factories that synthesized protein and carbohydrates. When fats could be synthesized the day of the farmer would be over.  He wondered if there weren't some way out of it now. With Alice gone there was only himself, and his needs were few. He didn't know, but suddenly he wanted very much to see it all again. And, besides, he had to tell her folks.         *       *       *       *       *  The ancient surface bus reached Central Valley at noon the next day. It all looked very much as it had the last time Mel had seen it and it looked very good indeed. The vast, open lands; the immense ripe fields.  The bus passed the high school where Mel and Alice had attended classes together. He half expected to see her running across the campus lawn to meet him. In the middle of town he got off the bus and there were Alice's mother and father.  They were dry-eyed now but white and numb with shock. George Dalby took his hand and pumped it heavily. \"We can't realize it, Mel. We just can't believe Alice is gone.\"  His wife put her arms around Mel and struggled with her tears again. \"You didn't say anything about the funeral. When will it be?\"  Mel swallowed hard, fighting the one lie he had to tell. He almost wondered now why he had agreed to Dr. Winters' request. \"Alice--always wanted to do all the good she could in the world,\" he said. \"She figured that she could be of some use even after she was gone. So she made an agreement with the research hospital that they could have her body after she died.\"  It took a moment for her mother to grasp the meaning. Then she cried out, \"We can't even bury her?\"  \"We should have a memorial service, right here at home where all her friends are,\" said Mel.  George Dalby nodded in his grief. \"That was just like Alice,\" he said. \"Always wanting to do something for somebody else--\"  And it was true, Mel thought. If Alice had supposed she was not going to live any longer she would probably have thought of the idea, herself. Her parents were easily reconciled.  They took him out to the old familiar house and gave him the room where he and Alice had spent the first days of their marriage.         *       *       *       *       *  When it was night and the lights were out he felt able to sleep naturally for the first time since Alice's accident. She seemed not far away here in this old familiar house.  In memory, she was not, for Mel was convinced he could remember the details of his every association with her. He first became conscious of her existence one day when they were in the third grade. At the beginning of each school year the younger pupils went through a course of weighing, inspection, knee tapping, and cavity counting. Mel had come in late for his examination that year and barged into the wrong room. A shower of little-girl squeals had greeted him as the teacher told him kindly where the boy's examination room was.  But he remembered most vividly Alice Dalby standing in the middle of the room, her blouse off but held protectingly in front of her as she jumped up and down in rage and pointed a finger at him. \"You get out of here, Melvin Hastings! You're not a nice boy at all!\"  Face red, he had hastily retreated as the teacher assured Alice and the rest of the girls that he had made a simple mistake. But how angry Alice had been! It was a week before she would speak to him.  He smiled and sank back deeply into the pillow. He remembered how proud he had been when old Doc Collins, who came out to do the honors every Fall, had told him there wasn't a thing wrong with him and that if he continued to drink his milk regularly he'd grow up to be a football player. He could still hear Doc's words whistling through his teeth and feel the coldness of the stethoscope on his chest.  Suddenly, he sat upright in bed in the darkness.  Stethoscope!  They had tapped and inspected and listened to Alice that day, and all the other examination days.  If Doc Collins had been unable to find a heartbeat in her he'd have fainted--and spread the news all over town!  Mel got up and stood at the window, his heart pounding. Old Doc Collins was gone, but the medical records of those school examinations might still be around somewhere. He didn't know what he expected to prove, but surely those records would not tell the same story Dr. Winters had told.  It took him nearly all the next day. The grade school principal agreed to help him check through the dusty attic of the school, where ancient records and papers were tumbled about and burst from their cardboard boxes.  Then Paul Ames, the school board secretary, took Mel down to the District Office and offered to help look for the records. The old building was stifling hot and dusty with summer disuse. But down in the cool, cobwebbed basement they found it.... Alice's records from the third grade on up through the ninth. On every one: heart, o.k.; lungs, normal. Pulse and blood pressure readings were on each chart.  \"I'd like to take these,\" said Mel. \"Her doctor in town--he wants to write some kind of paper on her case and would like all the past medical history he can get.\"  Paul Ames frowned thoughtfully. \"I'm not allowed to give District property away. But they should have been thrown out a long time ago--take 'em and don't tell anybody I let you have 'em.\"  \"Thanks. Thanks a lot,\" Mel said.  And when she was fourteen or fifteen her appendix had been removed. A Dr. Brown had performed the operation, Mel remembered. He had taken over from Collins.  \"Sure, he's still here,\" Paul Ames said. \"Same office old Doc Collins used. You'll probably find him there right now.\"  Dr. Brown remembered. He didn't remember the details of the appendectomy, but he still had records that showed a completely normal operation.  \"I wonder if I could get a copy of that record and have you sign it,\" Mel said. He explained about the interest of Dr. Winters in her case without revealing the actual circumstances.  \"Glad to,\" said Dr. Brown. \"I just wish things hadn't turned out the way they have. One of the loveliest girls that ever grew up here, Alice.\"         *       *       *  The special memorial service was held in the old community church on Sunday afternoon. It was like the drawing of a curtain across a portion of Mel's life, and he knew that curtain would never open again.  He took a bus leaving town soon after the service.  There was one final bit of evidence, and he wondered all the way back to town why he had not thought of it first. Alice's pregnancy had ended in miscarriage, and there had never been another.  But X-rays had been taken to try to find the cause of Alice's difficulty. If they showed that Alice was normal within the past two years--         *       *       *       *       *  Dr. Winters was mildly surprised to see Mel again. He invited the reporter in to his office and offered him a chair. \"I suppose you have come to inquire about our findings"]]]
