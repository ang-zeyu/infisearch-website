Now that you know how soft your bones are, and how easily they bend, you will surely be careful to sit and stand erect. Do not twist your legs, or arms, or shoulders; for you want to grow into straight and graceful men and women, instead of being round-shouldered, or hump-backed, or lame, all your lives.  When people are old, their bones contain more lime, and, therefore, break more easily.  You should be kindly helpful to old people, so that they may not fall, and possibly break their bones.   CARE OF THE FEET.  Healthy children are always out-growing their shoes, and sometimes faster than they wear them out. Tight shoes cause corns and in-growing nails and other sore places on the feet. All of these are very hard to get rid of. No one should wear a shoe that pinches or hurts the foot.   OUGHT A BOY TO USE TOBACCO?  Perhaps some boy will say: \"Grown people are always telling us, 'this will do for men, but it is not good for boys.'\"  Tobacco is not good for men; but there is a very good reason why it is worse for boys.  If you were going to build a house, would it be wise for you to put into the stone-work of the cellar something that would make it less strong?  Something into the brick-work or the mortar, the wood-work or the nails, the walls or the chimneys, that would make them weak and tottering, instead of strong and steady?  It would he had enough if you should repair your house with poor materials; but surely it must be built in the first place with the best you can get.  You will soon learn that boys and girls are building their bodies, day after day, until at last they reach full size.  Afterward, they must be repaired as fast as they wear out.  It would be foolish to build any part in a way to make it weaker than need be.  Wise doctors have said that the boy who uses tobacco while he is growing, makes every part of his body less strong than it otherwise would be. Even his bones will not grow so well.  Boys who smoke can not become such large, fine-looking men as they would if they did not smoke.  Cigarettes are small, but they are very poisonous. Chewing tobacco is a worse and more filthy habit even than smoking. The frequent spitting it causes is disgusting to others and hurts the health of the chewer. Tobacco in any form is a great enemy to youth. It stunts the growth, hurts the mind, and cripples in every way the boy or girl who uses it.  Not that it does all this to every youth who smokes, but it is always true that no boy of seven to fourteen can begin to smoke or chew and have so fine a body and mind when he is twenty-one years old as he would have had if he had never used tobacco. If you want to be strong and well men and women, do not use tobacco in any form.   REVIEW QUESTIONS.            1. What two kinds of joints have you?            2. Describe each kind.            3.

[Illustration: W]HAT makes the limbs move?  You have to take hold of the door to move it back and forth; but you need not take hold of your arm to move that.  What makes it move?  Sometimes a door or gate is made to shut itself, if you leave it open.  This can be done by means of a wide rubber strap, one end of which is fastened to the frame of the door near the hinge, and the other end to the door, out near its edge.  When we push open the door, the rubber strap is stretched; but as soon as we have passed through, the strap tightens, draws the door back, and shuts it.  If you stretch out your right arm, and clasp the upper part tightly with your left hand, then work the elbow joint strongly back and forth, you can feel something under your hand draw up, and then lengthen out again, each time you bend the joint.  What you feel, is a muscle (mŭs´sl), and it works your joints very much as the rubber strap works the hinge of the door.  One end of the muscle is fastened to the bone just below the elbow joint; and the other end, higher up above the joint.  When it tightens, or contracts, as we say, it bends the joint. When the arm is straightened, the muscle returns to its first shape.  There is another muscle on the outside of the arm which stretches when this one shortens, and so helps the working of the joint.  Every joint has two or more muscles of its own to work it.  Think how many there must be in our fingers!  If we should undertake to count all the muscles that move our whole bodies, it would need more counting than some of you could do.   TENDONS.  You can see muscles on the dinner table; for they are only lean meat.  [Illustration: _Tendons of the hand._]  They are fastened to the bones by strong cords, called tendons (tĕn´dŏnz). These tendons can be seen in the leg of a chicken or turkey. They sometimes hold the meat so firmly that it is hard for you to get it off. When you next try to pick a \"drum-stick,\" remember that you are eating the strong muscles by which the chicken or turkey moved his legs as he walked about the yard. The parts that have the most work to do, need the strongest muscles.  Did you ever see the swallows flying about the eaves of a barn?  Do they have very stout legs? No! They have very small legs and feet, because they do not need to walk. They need to fly.  The muscles that move the wings are fastened to the breast. These breast muscles of the swallow must be large and strong.   EXERCISE OF THE MUSCLES.  People who work hard with any part of the body make the muscles of that part very strong.  The blacksmith has big, strong muscles in his arms because he uses them so much.  You are using your muscles every day, and this helps them to grow.  Once I saw a little girl who had been very sick. She had to lie in bed for many weeks. Before her sickness she had plenty of stout muscles in her arms and legs and was running about the house from morning till night, carrying her big doll in her arms.  After her sickness, she could hardly walk ten steps, and would rather sit and look at her playthings than try to lift them. She had to make new muscles as fast as possible.  Running, coasting, games of ball, and all brisk play and work, help to make strong muscles.  Idle habits make weak muscles. So idleness is an enemy to the muscles.  There is another enemy to the muscles about which I must tell you.   WHAT ALCOHOL WILL DO TO THE MUSCLES.  Muscles are lean meat. Fat meat could not work your joints for you as the muscles do. Alcohol often changes a part of the muscles to fat, and so takes away a part of their strength. In this way, people often grow very fleshy from drinking beer, because it contains alcohol, as you will soon learn. But they can not work any better on account of having this fat. They are not really any stronger for it.   REVIEW QUESTIONS.             1. How are the joints moved?             2.

[Illustration: H]OW do the muscles know when to move?  You have all seen the telegraph wires, by which messages are sent from one town to another, all over the country.  You are too young to understand how this is done, but you each have something inside of you, by which you are sending messages almost every minute while you are awake.  We will try to learn a little about its wonderful way of working.  In your head is your brain. It is the part of you which thinks.  As you would be very badly off if you could not think, the brain is your most precious part, and you have a strong box made of bone to keep it in.  [Illustration: _Diagram of the nervous system._]  We will call the brain the central telegraph office. Little white cords, called nerves, connect the brain with the rest of the body.  A large cord called the spinal cord, lies"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25646"],["title","Child's Health Primer For Primary Classes (#2)"],["body"," in a bony case made by the spine, and many nerves branch off from this.  If you put your finger on a hot stove, in an instant a message goes on the nerve telegraph to the brain. It tells that wise thinking part that your finger will burn, if it stays on the stove.  In another instant, the brain sends back a message to the muscles that move that finger, saying: \"Contract quickly, bend the joint, and take that poor finger away so that it will not be burned.\"  You can hardly believe that there was time for all this sending of messages; for as soon as you felt the hot stove, you pulled your finger away. But you really could not have pulled it away, unless the brain had sent word to the muscles to do it.  Now, you know what we mean when we say, \"As quick as thought.\" Surely nothing could be quicker.  You see that the brain has a great deal of work to do, for it has to send so many orders.  There are some muscles which are moving quietly and steadily all the time, though we take no notice of the motion.  You do not have to think about breathing, and yet the muscles work all the time, moving your chest.  If we had to think about it every time we breathed, we should have no time to think of any thing else.  There is one part of the brain that takes care of such work for us. It sends the messages about breathing, and keeps the breathing muscles and many other muscles faithfully at work. It does all this without our needing to know or think about it at all.  Do you begin to see that your body is a busy work-shop, where many kinds of work are being done all day and all night?  Although we lie still and sleep in the night, the breathing must go on, and so must the work of those other organs that never stop until we die.   OTHER WORK OF THE NERVES.  The little white nerve-threads lie smoothly side by side, making small white cords. Each kind of message goes on its own thread, so that the messages need never get mixed or confused.  These nerves are very delicate little messengers. They do all the feeling for the whole body, and by means of them we have many pains and many pleasures.  If there was no nerve in your tooth it could not ache. But if there were no nerves in your mouth and tongue, you could not taste your food.  If there were no nerves in your hands, you might cut them and feel no pain. But you could not feel your mother's soft, warm hand, as she laid it on yours.  One of your first duties is the care of yourselves.  Children may say: \"My father and mother take care of me.\" But even while you are young, there are some ways in which no one can take care of you but yourselves. The older you grow, the more this care will belong to you, and to no one else.  Think of the work all the parts of the body do for us, and how they help us to be well and happy. Certainly the least we can do is to take care of them and keep them in good order.   CARE OF THE BRAIN AND NERVES.  As one part of the brain has to take care of all the rest of the body, and keep every organ at work, of course it can never go to sleep itself. If it did, the heart would stop pumping, the lungs would leave off breathing, all other work would stop, and the body would be dead.  But there is another part of the brain which does the thinking, and this part needs rest.  When you are asleep, you are not thinking, but you are breathing and other work of the body is going on.  If the thinking part of the brain does not have good quiet sleep, it will soon wear out. A worn-out brain is not easy to repair.  If well cared for, your brain will do the best of work for you for seventy or eighty years without complaining.  The nerves are easily tired out, and they need much rest. They get tired if we do one thing too long at a time; they are rested by a change of work.   IS ALCOHOL GOOD FOR THE NERVES AND THE BRAIN?  Think of the wonderful work the brain is all the time doing for you!  You ought to give it the best of food to keep it in good working order. Any drink that contains alcohol is not a food to make one strong; but is a poison to hurt, and at last to kill.  It injures the brain and nerves so that they can not work well, and send their messages properly. That is why the drunkard does not know what he is about.  Newspapers often tell us about people setting houses on fire; about men who forgot to turn the switch, and so wrecked a railroad train; about men who lay down on the railroad track and were run over by the cars.  Often these stories end with: \"The person had been drinking.\" When the nerves are put to sleep by alcohol, people become careless and do not do their work faithfully; sometimes, they can not even tell the difference between a railroad track and a place of safety. The brain receives no message, or the wrong one, and the person does not know what he is doing.  You may say that all men who drink liquor do not do such terrible things.  That is true. A little alcohol is not so bad as a great deal. But even a little makes the head ache, and hurts the brain and nerves.  A body kept pure and strong is of great service to its owner. There are people who are not drunkards, but who often drink a little liquor. By this means, they slowly poison their bodies.  When sickness comes upon them, they are less able to bear it, and less likely to get well again, than those who have never injured their bodies with alcohol.  When a sick or wounded man is brought into the hospital, one of the first questions asked him by the doctor is: \"Do you drink?\"  If he answers \"Yes!\" the next questions are, \"What do you drink?\" and \"How much?\"  The answers he gives to these questions, show the doctor what chance the man has of getting well.  A man who never drinks liquor will get well, where a drinking man would surely die.   TOBACCO AND THE NERVES.  Why does any one wish to use tobacco?  Because many men say that it helps them, and makes them feel better.  Shall I tell you how it makes them feel better?  If a man is cold, the tobacco deadens his nerves so that he does not feel the cold and does not take pains to make himself warmer.  If a man is tired, or in trouble, tobacco will not really rest him or help him out of his trouble.  It only puts his nerves to sleep and helps him think that he is not tired, and that he does not need to overcome his troubles.  It puts his nerves to sleep very much as alcohol does, and helps him to be contented with what ought not to content him.  A boy who smokes or chews tobacco, is not so good a scholar as if he did not use the poison. He can not remember his lessons so well.  Usually, too, he is not so polite, nor so good a boy as he otherwise would be.   REVIEW QUESTIONS.             1. How do the muscles know when to move?             2.

This juice is mostly water, sweetened with a sugar of its own. It is flavored with something which makes us know, the moment we taste it, that it is grape-juice, and not cherry-juice or plum-juice.  Apples also contain water, sugar, and apple flavor; and cherries contain water, sugar, and cherry flavor. The same is true of other fruits. They all, when ripe, have the water and the sugar; and each has a flavor of its own.  Ripe grapes are sometimes gathered and put into great tubs called vats. In these the juice is squeezed out.  In some countries, this squeezing is done by bare-footed men who jump into the vats and press the grapes with their feet.  The grape-juice is then drawn off from the skins and seeds and left standing in a warm place.  Bubbles soon begin to rise and cover the top of it with froth. The juice is all in motion.  [Illustration: _Picking grapes and making wine._]  If the cook had wished to use this grape-juice to make jelly, she would say: \"Now, I can not make my grape-jelly, for the grape-juice is spoiled.\"   WHAT IS THIS CHANGE IN THE GRAPE-JUICE?  The sugar in the grape-juice is changing into something else. It is turning into alcohol and a gas[A] that moves about in little bubbles in the liquid, and rising to the top,"]]]
