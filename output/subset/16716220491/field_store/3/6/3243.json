Mrs. Alexander, the gorgeously-plumed ranch-woman; Dorothy, always known as \"Dodo,\" the restive girl of Polly's own age; and little Ebeneezer Alexander, too meek and self-effacing to deny his spouse anything, but always providing the funds for her caprices. This present caprice, of rushing to Europe to find a \"title\" for Dodo to marry, was the latest and hardest of all for him to agree to.  Because of Mrs. Alexander's whim, the ludicrous experiences that came upon the innocent heads of Polly and her friends, in the tour of England in two motor cars, decided them to escape from that lady, and run away to Paris. Before they could sigh in relief at their freedom, however, the Alexanders loomed again on their horizon.  Plan as they would, the badgered tourists found that Mrs. Alexander had annexed herself permanently to them. They resigned themselves to the inevitable. But that carried with it more ridiculous affairs, when Mrs. Alexander plotted for the titles found dangling before her, in various places on the Continent.  One good result came from this association with the Alexanders: Dodo found how fascinating the work of collecting really was, and decided to study decorating as an art. Hence she spurned her mother's ambitions for her, and announced her plan of remaining in New York with the girls, upon their return to America, to follow in their line of study.  Mrs. Alexander felt quite satisfied to live in New York for a season, as she fancied it an easy matter to forge a way into good society there. But her spouse detested large cities and longed for his mining life once more, but agreed to it because Dodo was delighted with the opportunity opened before her, in the profession of decorator.  Polly's party on board the steamer consisted of Mr. and Mrs. Ashby and Ruth; Mr. and Mrs. Fabian and Nancy; Mr. and Mrs. Alexander and Dodo; and lastly, Polly Brewster and Eleanor Maynard.  Just a word about the last two girls: Polly knew that Eleanor was fond of Paul Stewart since she met him a few years before. And Eleanor wondered if Polly preferred Tom Latimer to any other young man she knew; but Polly always declared that she was married to her profession and had no time to spare for beaus. Hence Tom Latimer sighed and hoped that she might change her mind some day.  Meantime, Tom lost no good opportunity to show how he appreciated Polly and, whenever possible, he managed to perform the little deeds that mean so much to a woman--especially if that woman is young and impressionable. Thus he actually made better headway in his silent campaign for Polly, by never broaching the subject of love--from which she would have fled instantly and then barred the doors of her heart.  The wireless received by Polly was from Tom who had been anxiously awaiting the time when he could communicate with the vessel. The contents of the message could have been read to all the world without exciting comment--it was so brotherly. But Polly felt that it was a private welcome to her and so it was not to be shared with others.  The wireless said that Tom and Polly's dear friends who were in New York, had been invited on board Mr. Dalken's yacht, to visit the quarantined steamer that evening. That they would arrive about eight o'clock, having secured passes from the Inspector at Quarantine.  Although this explanation about Polly and her associates took time for _us_, it did not interrupt the lively banter between the five girls. Dorothy was now certain that Polly had a real beau, somewhere, and being so very candid and talkative herself, she admired the reticence displayed by Polly in keeping the affairs of her heart to herself.  Dodo whispered back to Eleanor: \"Dear me! I hope he is worthy of her. She ought to have the finest husband in the world.\"  Eleanor laughed. \"Don't worry, Dodo. She will. If he was not meant for Polly, I'd try and get him for myself--that is how much I admire him.\"  \"Oh my! Won't you tell me something about him, Nolla?\" asked Dorothy, eagerly.  \"I really don't dare, Dodo,\" returned Eleanor, assuming a wise expression. \"Polly would drop me forever, if she thought I confided in anyone about her love-affairs. Besides, you can find out everything for yourself, now that you are going to remain with us, this winter. Still, I would love to know just who that wireless came from.\" Eleanor added the latter remark after a moment's deep consideration.  \"I'll tell you what we can do,\" ventured Dorothy, in a whisper. \"We have often visited the wireless room; let's you and I go there again, and start a friendly chat with the operator. Maybe he will speak of the message.\"  Without stopping to think whether this method would be principled or not, Eleanor eagerly agreed to Dorothy's plan. While Polly and Nancy were discussing the beautiful hazy picture made by New York's sky-line as seen from the Harbor at Quarantine, Dorothy and Eleanor hurried to the wireless room.  The young man had often been entertained by the girls during the trip from Europe, so this visit was not suspected of having a secret motive back of it. He chatted pleasantly with his callers and, after a time, spoke of the very topic they wished to hear about.  \"I suppose you girls will all be on the _qui vive_ this evening?\"  \"Yes, it is awfully nice of the captain, isn't it?\" said Eleanor, referring to the dance and thinking that the operator also meant that event.  \"Oh, I do not think the captain had as much to do with the invitation as had the Inspector General of the Quarantine. Of course we have a clean bill for the ship or no one would have been allowed to step on board tonight; but at the same time your friends must have had a good hard time to get the invitation from the authorities. Only a New Yorker who understands the ropes, could have managed the matter so quickly.\"  Dorothy was about to ask what he was talking about, when Eleanor pinched her arm for silence. Then the latter spoke: \"Oh yes! He is a wonder--we think!\"  Dorothy gasped at Eleanor, and the smiling girl winked secretly at her. The operator had not seen the pinch nor the wink, but he continued guilelessly: \"Well, from what I've seen of Miss Polly, only a 'wonder' would cause her to notice him at all!\"  He laughed at his own words and Eleanor joined him, even though she failed to see a joke. Then she said: \"Polly could have so _many_ admirers, but she never looks at a man. Perhaps that is why all you males sigh so broken-heartedly at her heels.\"  The young man laughed softly to himself. \"Maybe! But this 'Tom' seems to feel assured of a 'look' from her.\"  Now it was Dorothy's turn to pinch Eleanor, and she did so with great gusto. Eleanor winced but dared not express herself in any other manner, just then. She was too keen on the trail of learning what she could, to signify any sense of having felt that pinch.  \"Oh--Tom! He is an old family friend, you know. He was Polly's brother's college-chum for four years while both boys studied at the University of Chicago. I am from Chicago, and I knew those boys when they used to come to my home with my brother, who also attended the engineering classes. There was a fourth boy--Paul Stewart, who was from Denver. Anne Stewart was his sister and she married John Brewster, this Spring. So you see, we are all old friends together. I suppose the whole family crowd will come out on the yacht, tonight.\"  Dorothy listened in sheer amazement, as Eleanor spoke with all the assurance possible. But Dorothy was not aware of Eleanor's lifelong training in the home of a social leader of Chicago's exclusive set. That such a home-training made a girl precocious and subtle, was not strange, and Eleanor had had fourteen years of such a life before she went to Pebbly Pit and met Polly. Habits so well-engrounded are not easily broken, or forgotten.  \"Then the sender ought to have sent his message to one of the adults of the party. Even _I_ misjudged the matter, because I thought this 'Tom' must be a faithful admirer of Miss Polly's to get through to visit the steamer tonight,\" explained the operator.  \"But he isn't coming alone--didn't you stop to consider that?\" asked Eleanor, eagerly. \"Seeing that most of the friends are Polly's personal ones, the wire was sent to her, you know.\"  \"I see.\"  \"The only thing that hurt me, was that no one sent me a message. Tom is as dear to me as to Polly, and I wonder he did not wire me.\"  \"Perhaps this Tom thought you would have scores of eager messages the moment your beaus knew you were near enough to get them,\" laughed the young officer.  \"Well, they didn't! But I want you to do something for me--will you?\" asked Eleanor, quite unexpectedly.  \"I will if I can,\" agreed the officer.  \"Write off a fake message for me and sign some make-believe name to it, so I can hold my head up with Polly. She will never let me rest if she thinks she got a line, and I didn't!\"  \"Oh, that is easy to do. As long as we know it will never come out, and that I wrote a line to you, it will be a good joke.\"  \"All right!\" laughed Eleanor, delightedly. \"Now write:----\" She stopped suddenly, then thought for a moment before she said: \"Why not copy the exact words sent to Polly, but sign another name?\"  \"I'll write one, as much like the original as possible without actually duplicating that information,\" chuckled the officer.  Then he took up a slip of paper and wrote: \"Miss Eleanor Maynard. We will join you this evening, on steamer. Yacht will arrive about eight.\" He looked up laughingly and asked: \"Now what name shall we sign to this?\"  \"Oh--let me see! Sign 'Paul.' I know he is in New York, now, so I am not taking chances of making a mistake,\" laughed Eleanor.  The name \"Paul\" was added to the message and the paper placed in an envelope. This was addressed to Eleanor Maynard and her stateroom number written down upon it. Then it was handed to the gratified girl.  The young man was thanked with unwarranted warmth, "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25778"],["title","Polly's Business Venture (#2)"],["body","the two girls hastened away.     CHAPTER II  A DISAPPOINTING EVENING   Eleanor and Dorothy did not join their friends at once, after leaving the wireless room. Eleanor explained wisely: \"We must promenade along the deck and let them see us reading and talking over the message, you know, to make them believe we just got it from the boy.\"  So this little act was carried out, and when the two girls felt sure that Polly and her companions had noticed them reading the wireless message, Eleanor whispered: \"Now we can stroll over and join them. Leave it to me.\"  Just before she joined her friends, Eleanor thrust the paper into her sweater pocket, and seemed not to remember it. But Nancy spoke of it, immediately.  \"I see you received a _billet-doux_, too. Is there any reason why I should not say to you exactly what you said to Polly, when she got hers?\" laughed the young lady.  \"Oh, not at all! I am not so bashful about my affair,\" retorted Eleanor, taking the paper from her pocket and handing it to Nancy. \"You may read it aloud, if you choose.\"  So Nancy read, and the fact that the words conveyed the same information as Polly's had done, but the sender had signed himself \"Paul,\" made Polly feel relieved. Then she said:  \"It is evident that someone secured a yacht to carry our friends out to see us this evening. My message said about the same thing, so now, you see, it was ridiculous in Eleanor to tease about it being a love-note. Had she been sensible I would have read it aloud to all, but because of her silliness, I made up my mind to keep her guessing.\"  Nancy and Ruth laughed, but Eleanor and Dorothy exchanged glances with each other. Then Nancy said anxiously: \"We ought to start and dress most fetchingly for tonight, if everyone you know is coming out.\"  Before anyone could reply to this suggestion, Mr. Fabian was seen hurrying across the deck to join them. \"Girls, our old friend Dalken has a yacht, I hear, and he has invited everyone we know to come out here this evening to welcome us home. We are to be ready to return with him, as he has secured the necessary bill-of-health for us. Now get down to your rooms quickly and pack.\"  \"Oh--aren't we going to remain to the dance?\" asked Eleanor, with disappointment in her tones.  \"You can do as you please about that, but we will go back on the yacht when she returns to the city.\"  In the bustle of packing the stateroom trunks, and then dressing for the evening, the girls forgot about the wireless messages. Then during the dinner that was like a party affair because of the passengers' exuberant spirits at being so near home again, Mr. Fabian smiled approvingly at the five young girls in his charge. They looked so charming in their Paris gowns, and their youthful forms and faces expressed such joy and pleasure in living, that he felt gratified to think the old friends would see them as _he_ did that evening.  Shortly after leaving the dining-salon, the attention of the Fabian party was drawn to a graceful white yacht that sailed swiftly down the Bay and soon came alongside the steamer. The spotless looking sailors instantly lowered the boat and a party of young people got in. The Fabian group leaned over the rail of the steamer and watched breathlessly as the boat was rowed across the intervening space and, finally, was made fast to the steamer.  \"Poll, did you recognize your future Fate?\" giggled Eleanor, nudging her companion, knowingly.  \"I saw _yours_!\" retorted Polly. \"And now I comprehend why you can speak of nothing else than beaus and Fate! You are so obsessed by your own dreams that you think everyone you know must be dreaming the same stuff!\"  Polly turned quickly and hurried to the spot where the visitors were being greeted by Mr. Fabian, and the other girls, laughing at the repartee, followed. In the first group to arrive were Tom Latimer and his younger brother Jim; Kenneth Evans, Jim's chum; Paul Stewart; and John Brewster with Anne, his bride.  Happy welcomes were exchanged between everyone, but Polly purposely avoided any extra favor being shown Tom Latimer, although he looked as if he deserved it more than Jim and his friend Kenneth. Eleanor quite openly showed her preference for Paul, when they separated from the others for the evening.  \"Where is Mr. Dalken and the others?\" asked Polly, gazing around at the small group that had arrived on board.  \"The boat is going back for the second installment,\" explained Anne, keeping an arm about Polly's waist. \"We-all were too impatient to see you to accept the suggestion of waiting for the second trip, so the older ones sent us off first.\"  To Polly's surprise and joy, the second boat-load brought her father and mother, Mrs. Stewart, the Latimers, the Evans, and Mr. Dalken, the owner of the yacht. When the family circle was complete, on board the steamer, they proved to be a happy party, and many of the passengers wished they were included in that merry group.  The steamer rolled gently with the swells from the ocean, while the full moon shone mistily through a fog that veiled its brightness enough to add romance to the meeting of the various young people on deck. Eleanor and Paul had been genuinely delighted to see each other again, and neither cared _who_ knew just how much they liked each other.  Polly watched them for a time, then smiled as they walked away to discover a cozy retreat behind one of the giant smoke-stacks, where they could enjoy a tête-à-tête without interruption. When she turned to hear what her brother John was saying, she found Tom Latimer just at her elbow.  \"Suppose we find a nice sheltered spot where you can tell me all about your trip abroad?\" suggested Tom, his eyes speaking too plainly how anxious he was to get Polly away from the others.  \"Oh, I'd far rather be with the crowd and hear all that is being said,\" said Polly, nervously.  \"Very well, then,\" said Tom, moodily. \"I only thought you'd like to hear all about Grizzly Slide and how it's been cutting up this summer. The gold mine has had several adventurers trying to jump the claim, too; and Rainbow Cliffs has had an injunction served on it so that we are tied up by law, this year.\"  \"So mother wrote to me. But I don't want to hear about troubles and business tonight. I just want to enjoy myself after coming home to all the dear folks,\" said Polly.  Tom was too unsophisticated with girls, although he was so popular with men, to make allowance for the contrary spirit that often sways a girl when she wishes to make a good impression; so he sulked and followed at Polly's heels when she hurried after her friends.  Mr. Dalken turned just now, and saw the girl running as if to get away from Tom, and he understood, fairly well, just how matters were. So he endeavored to calm Polly's perturbed spirit and encourage Tom's \"faint heart\" at the same time.  \"Well, Polly dear,\" said he, placing an arm about her shoulders, \"now that you have seen many of the wonder-spots of Europe, and know more about antiques and art than any of us, I suppose you are quite decided that business is not your forte, eh? The next thing I'll hear from you, you'll have dropped your ambitions and be sailing down a love-stream to a snug harbor.\"  \"Indeed not! You ought to know me better than that, Mr. Dalken,\" declared Polly, vehemently, causing her companions to laugh. \"I am more determined than ever, since seeing such wonderful things in Europe, to devote my life to my chosen profession. Why, the marvellous objects I saw in Europe, used in interior decorating in centuries past, enthuse me anew. I wonder that anyone can keep from studying this fascinating art where there is such a broad field of work and interest.\"  Polly's mother and father listened to their daughter, with adoration plainly expressed on their faces, and Tom had to grit his teeth to keep from swearing, because of what he considered their influence over Polly in this, her foolish infatuation for a business when she ought to be in love with him.  When Mr. Dalken saw that he had launched a dangerous subject for Polly and Tom, he had a bright idea. So he acted upon it instantly. He excused himself from his friends' circle, and sought the Captain. In a short time thereafter, the passengers heard the band playing dance music, and immediately, most of the younger set hurried to the Grand Salon.  It was second nature with Polly to dance, and she did so with as much grace as she rode her father's thoroughbred horses on the ranch; or hiked the Rockies, over boulders and down-timber like a fawn. Kenneth Evans, the youngest man in the party from the city, was by far the handsomest one in the group; and when he guided Polly through the maze of dancers, they both attracted much attention.  Tom stood and sulked while he watched Polly dance, but he refused to dance himself, although he was considered a most desirable partner by any one who had ever danced with him. Eleanor was having such a thoroughly good time while dancing with Paul, that she forgot about the romances and lovers' quarrels of others.  The moment Kenneth escorted Polly to a chair and stood fanning her, Tom pushed a way over to them and said, quite assuredly: \"The next dance is mine, Polly.\"  \"Why, I never told you so, at all!\" exclaimed Polly, annoyed at Tom's tone and manner. \"How do you know there will be another one?\"  Tom flushed and sent Kenneth an angry glance, although poor Ken was innocent of any guile in this case.  \"If you do not care to dance with me, Polly, say so, and I'll go to the smoking-room and enjoy the companionship of men who appreciate me,\" retorted Tom, impatiently.  The imp of resistance took instant possession of Polly, and she said: \"Tom, there's where you belong--with men who want to talk about work and money. You are too old to enjoy youthful follies as I do.\"  Tom had been dreaming of this meeting with Polly again, for so long, that now everything seemed shattered for him. He felt so injured at her mention of his"]]]
