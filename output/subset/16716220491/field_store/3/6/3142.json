It was only of the night-time she was afraid, when strange-voiced creatures were never silent an hour, weird cries from the scrub pierced the air, and there arose from the plantation below wild sounds, sometimes of revelry over a feast, the beating of tom-toms, and wailing of voices as the natives conducted their heathen worship, or indulged in noisy quarrels likely to end in bloodshed between antagonistic tribes.  But though for some reasons the coolies were not pleasant neighbours, the house on the hill had nothing to fear from them. Their worst feature was their utter uselessness in any real danger, coming from quite another quarter. Though they might serve him solely for their own benefit, and were for the most part thieves and rogues, the coolies had no desire to harm the white man personally.  But wandering stealthily through the woods, homeless and lawless, is a race that hates the white man--the aborigines of Australia. Civilization has driven them farther and farther north, for the Australian black-fellows cannot be tamed and trained--their nature is too wild and fierce to be kept within bounds except by fear and crushing. They are treacherous and savage, and most repulsive in appearance. Though spoken of as black, they are really chocolate-brown, but so covered with hair as to be very dusky.  Being very cunning in their movements, it is always difficult to know where they are, and there are often such long lapses between the times they are heard of, that most people forget their existence as a matter of any importance. But Mr. Orban knew that his wife was haunted by a very constant horror of them--a dread lest one night the blacks should make a raid upon their plantation, as they had been known to do upon other white men's dwellings.  What neither Mr. nor Mrs. Orban realized was how much Eustace and Nesta knew of certain terrible events happening from time to time in just such isolated homes as their own. It was from the two young white maidservants the children heard tales they listened to with a kind of awful enjoyment by day, but which were remembered at night with a shudder. The creaking of the wooden house in which they lived as the boards contracted after the tropical heat of day, and the weird sounds rising from the plantation below, held a hundred terrors to be ashamed of in the morning.  Eustace and Nesta never spoke of these night panics to any one, least of all to each other--they seemed so silly when broad daylight proved there had been absolutely nothing to be cowardly about.  By some unspoken rule Peter was never allowed to hear these stories. He was always considered so very much younger than Eustace and Nesta that even the servants had the sense not to frighten him. So Peter's spirits were not damped by the thought of their father's departure, and he knew nothing of the queer little tiff that had taken place between Eustace and Nesta.  It is very odd how people can quarrel over a matter upon which they are perfectly agreed; but they frequently do, especially when it has anything to do with fear.  Nesta went to bed that night still in the sulks, with an air of \"You'll be sorry some day\" about her every attitude. Eustace seemed inseparable from his book, and disinclined to talk. He went heavily to bed, more troubled than ever because, though his mother was unusually merry, making much of all the presents from England, and showing great interest in them, he saw she was very white, and there was still a strange look about her eyes. He suspected her gaiety to be only put on for their amusement, and he felt sorrier and sorrier for her.  But a good night's rest did wonders for both children, and they came in to breakfast in better humours. Nesta forgot to be tragic when she heard her father and mother discussing what material should be brought from Brisbane for the girls' new dresses. New clothes were a rare event for the Orban children, and always caused a good deal of excitement.  Eustace had been up early, and everything looked so calm, peaceful, and ordinary about the place that he was inclined to be more than half ashamed of his outburst the day before. \"After all,\" he argued, \"nothing ever has happened to us--why should it now? The black-fellows have never come this way. Why should they, just because father is away? How could they get to know of his going? Besides, the plantation isn't so awfully far off.\"  He had stood on the veranda and stared down at the sugar mill lying at the foot of the hill, where Robertson and Farley lived; at Mr. Ashton's house, and all the familiar, odd-shaped huts in which the coolies lived. It was all just as he had seen it every day of his life, and nothing had ever happened--why, indeed, should it now?  Mrs. Orban's interest in the new dresses was certainly not feigned.  \"Now, Jack,\" she was saying as Eustace entered the room, \"don't--don't go and ask for dusters. It is that pretty pink and blue check zephyr I want--pink for Becky, and blue for Nesta.\"  \"Well, dear, you must confess it is just like duster stuff--now, isn't it?\" demanded Mr. Orban with a laugh.  \"O daddy, not a bit!\" Nesta exclaimed. \"What a horrid thought!\"  \"Some of mother's dusters are very pretty, young woman,\" said her father. \"I wouldn't mind having shirts made of them myself.\"  \"I should object very much,\" Mrs. Orban said with a laugh; \"you would look like a coolie. But let us talk sense again.\"  Talking sense meant talking business, which on this occasion was the making out of a list of really rather dull things wanted in the house.  Daily life begins early on a sugar plantation. It was now only half-past six, and the house had been astir since half-past four; the children playing, Mrs. Orban working about the house, and Mr. Orban away down on the plantation. The comparative cool of the morning was the best time for any sort of activity. Later, as the fierce December sun rose higher, even the children became listless and disinclined to race about.  After breakfast, when Mr. Orban went back to work, Mrs. Orban gave the children lessons--the only teaching they had ever had. At eleven Mr. Orban returned for early dinner.  To our English ideas the routine seems strange; but the Orban children were used to it, and had no realization of how different was life in their parents' old home. It did not seem at all funny even to the twins to have tea at five, and go to bed at half-past six or seven. They were generally very ready for sleep by then, after their long, exhausting day.  \"I say, father,\" Eustace said suddenly, after a long meditation while business was being discussed, \"I can stay up to dinner with mother when you are away--can't I? It will be awfully dull for her if I don't.\"  \"And me too,\" said Nesta, who never allowed it to be forgotten that, being the same age as Eustace, she claimed the same privileges.  \"Rot,\" said Eustace; \"you're only a girl.\"  \"And me too,\" chimed in Peter.  \"Oh, you silly baby,\" said Eustace impatiently, \"what good would you do?\"  Peter's delicate face became scarlet.  \"I could play games with mother quite as well as you,\" he said with an angry frown.  \"Mother doesn't want amusing like that to keep her from being dull,\" Eustace declared. \"She wants somebody who can talk sensibly like father, and be grown up.\"  Nesta gave a little derisive laugh.  \"Like father!\" she repeated; \"that is funny. I suppose you think you could be just like him. Why don't you ask him to let you smoke one of his pipes at once?\"  \"Don't be silly, Nesta,\" Eustace retorted.  \"It's you who are silly,\" Nesta said, \"thinking only boys can be grown up or of any use.\"  \"When you have quite done snapping each other's heads off,\" interposed their father in his deep, quiet voice, \"perhaps you will allow me to speak. As a matter of fact, the mother thinks of going to bed with the cocks and hens herself.\"  \"To bed with the cocks and hens!\" repeated Peter, with an expression of blank surprise in his blue eyes.  Now the cocks and hens many of them roosted under the house, which was built on pillars, and set some distance above the ground. It was not an attractive spot at any time, for here there also lived many strange creatures, snakes amongst them.  \"Well, not exactly in the henhouse, Peter,\" said his father, with a twinkle in his eyes. \"I dare say she will sleep as usual in her own bedroom. I was referring more to the hour at which she says she means to go to bed--not very long after you.\"  \"Still you will have dinner--won't you, mummie?\" Eustace said.  \"Certainly,\" Mrs. Orban answered with a smile; \"and I don't think it would be a bad plan for you and Nesta to stay up for it, if you will promise not to get up quite so early in the morning. We will have dinner directly after Peter and Becky are in bed; but we won't sit up late ourselves, any of us.\"  Mrs. Orban certainly showed no signs of nervousness to-day; the strained expression had left her eyes; she was laughing and talking quite naturally.  \"I suppose,\" thought Eustace, \"she was partly upset by the parcel from England.\"  \"Father,\" Nesta exclaimed, \"I'm certain I hear a horse coming up the hill. Who can it be at this time of day?\"  \"Don't know, I'm sure,\" said her father; \"it might be one of a dozen people. You had better go and sing out 'friend or foe' over the veranda; but I dare say it isn't a horse at all. More probably it is old Hadji with the mail bag that ought to have come with the parcel yesterday.\"  But the three elder children had disappeared out on to the veranda and were leaning over, straining their eyes down the road that wound up the hill from the plain.  It was a very rough road, with ruts in it sometimes two or three feet deep. During the rains little better than a bog, it was now burnt hard as flint.  There was nothing to be seen though a mile of road was visible, lost now and then among bends; but the children listened breathlessly, and at last Eustace "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25086"],["title","The Delegate from Venus (#1)"],["body"," more practical,\" Howells said. \"You'll be taken into our confidence, and allowed to accompany those officials who will be admitted to the landing site. But you will _not_ be allowed to relay the story to the press until such a time as _all_ correspondents are informed. That won't give you a 'scoop' if that's what you call it, but you'll be an eyewitness. That should be worth something.\"  \"It's worth a lot,\" Jerry said eagerly. \"Thanks, Mr. Howells.\"  \"Don't thank me, I'm not doing you any _personal_ favor. Now about the landing tonight--\"  \"You mean the spaceship's coming down?\"  \"Yes. A special foreign ministers conference was held this morning, and a decision was reached to accept the delegate. Landing instructions are being given at Los Alamos, and the ship will presumably land around midnight tonight. There will be a jet leaving Washington Airport at nine, and you'll be on it. Meanwhile, consider yourself in custody.\"         *       *       *       *       *  The USAF jet transport wasn't the only secrecy-shrouded aircraft that took off that evening from Washington Airport. But Jerry Bridges, sitting in the rear seat flanked by two Sphinx-like Secret Service men, knew that he was the only passenger with non-official status aboard.  It was only a few minutes past ten when they arrived at the air base at Los Alamos. The desert sky was cloudy and starless, and powerful searchlights probed the thick cumulus. There were sleek, purring black autos waiting to rush the air passengers to some unnamed destination. They drove for twenty minutes across a flat ribbon of desert road, until Jerry sighted what appeared to be a circle of newly-erected lights in the middle of nowhere. On the perimeter, official vehicles were parked in orderly rows, and four USAF trailer trucks were in evidence, their radarscopes turning slowly. There was activity everywhere, but it was well-ordered and unhurried. They had done a good job of keeping the excitement contained.  He was allowed to leave the car and stroll unescorted. He tried to talk to some of the scurrying officials, but to no avail. Finally, he contented himself by sitting on the sand, his back against the grill of a staff car, smoking one cigarette after another.  As the minutes ticked off, the activity became more frenetic around him. Then the pace slowed, and he knew the appointed moment was approaching. Stillness returned to the desert, and tension was a tangible substance in the night air.  The radarscopes spun slowly.  The searchlights converged in an intricate pattern.  Then the clouds seemed to part!  \"Here she comes!\" a voice shouted. And in a moment, the calm was shattered. At first, he saw nothing. A faint roar was started in the heavens, and it became a growl that increased in volume until even the shouting voices could no longer be heard. Then the crisscrossing lights struck metal, glancing off the gleaming body of a descending object. Larger and larger the object grew, until it assumed the definable shape of a squat silver funnel, falling in a perfect straight line towards the center of the light-ringed area. When it hit, a dust cloud obscured it from sight.         *       *       *       *       *  A loudspeaker blared out an unintelligible order, but its message was clear. No one moved from their position.  Finally, a three-man team, asbestos-clad, lead-shielded, stepped out from the ring of spectators. They carried geiger counters on long poles before them.  Jerry held his breath as they approached the object; only when they were yards away did he appreciate its size. It wasn't large; not more than fifteen feet in total circumference.  One of the three men waved a gloved hand.  \"It's okay,\" a voice breathed behind him. \"No radiation ...\"  Slowly, the ring of spectators closed tighter. They were twenty yards from the ship when the voice spoke to them.  \"Greetings from Venus,\" it said, and then repeated the phrase in six languages. \"The ship you see is a Venusian Class 7 interplanetary rocket, built for one-passenger. It is clear of all radiation, and is perfectly safe to approach. There is a hatch which may be opened by an automatic lever in the side. Please open this hatch and remove the passenger.\"  An Air Force General whom Jerry couldn't identify stepped forward. He circled the ship warily, and then said something to the others. They came closer, and he touched a small lever on the silvery surface of the funnel.  A door slid open.  \"It's a box!\" someone said.  \"A crate--\"  \"Colligan! Moore! Schaffer! Lend a hand here--\"  A trio came forward and hoisted the crate out of the ship. Then the voice spoke again; Jerry deduced that it must have been activated by the decreased load of the ship.  \"Please open the crate. You will find our delegate within. We trust you will treat him with the courtesy of an official emissary.\"  They set to work on the crate, its gray plastic material giving in readily to the application of their tools. But when it was opened, they stood aside in amazement and consternation.  There were a variety of metal pieces packed within, protected by a filmy packing material.  \"Wait a minute,\" the general said. \"Here's a book--\"  He picked up a gray-bound volume, and opened its cover.  \"'Instructions for assembling Delegate,'\" he read aloud. \"'First, remove all parts and arrange them in the following order. A-1, central nervous system housing. A-2 ...'\" He looked up. \"It's an instruction book,\" he whispered. \"We're supposed to _build_ the damn thing.\"         *       *       *       *       *  The Delegate, a handsomely constructed robot almost eight feet tall, was pieced together some three hours later, by a team of scientists and engineers who seemed to find the Venusian instructions as elementary as a blueprint in an Erector set. But simple as the job was, they were obviously impressed by the mechanism they had assembled. It stood impassive until they obeyed the final instruction. \"Press Button K ...\"  They found button K, and pressed it.  The robot bowed.  \"Thank you, gentlemen,\" it said, in sweet, unmetallic accents. \"Now if you will please escort me to the meeting place ...\"         *       *       *       *       *  It wasn't until three days after the landing that Jerry Bridges saw the Delegate again. Along with a dozen assorted government officials, Army officers, and scientists, he was quartered in a quonset hut in Fort Dix, New Jersey. Then, after seventy-two frustrating hours, he was escorted by Marine guard into New York City. No one told him his destination, and it wasn't until he saw the bright strips of light across the face of the United Nations building that he knew where the meeting was to be held.  But his greatest surprise was yet to come. The vast auditorium which housed the general assembly was filled to its capacity, but there were new faces behind the plaques which designated the member nations. He couldn't believe his eyes at first, but as the meeting got under way, he knew that it was true. The highest echelons of the world's governments were represented, even--Jerry gulped at the realization--Nikita Khrushchev himself. It was a summit meeting such as he had never dreamed possible, a summit meeting without benefit of long foreign minister's debate. And the cause of it all, a placid, highly-polished metal robot, was seated blithely at a desk which bore the designation:                                   VENUS.  The robot delegate stood up.  \"Gentlemen,\" it said into the microphone, and the great men at the council tables strained to hear the translator's version through their headphones, \"Gentlemen, I thank you for your prompt attention. I come as a Delegate from a great neighbor planet, in the interests of peace and progress for all the solar system. I come in the belief that peace is the responsibility of individuals, of nations, and now of worlds, and that each is dependent upon the other. I speak to you now through the electronic instrumentation which has been created for me, and I come to offer your planet not merely a threat, a promise, or an easy solution--but a challenge.\"  The council room stirred.  \"Your earth satellites have been viewed with interest by the astronomers of our world, and we foresee the day when contact between our planets will be commonplace. As for ourselves, we have hitherto had little desire to explore beyond our realm, being far too occupied with internal matters. But our isolation cannot last in the face of your progress, so we believe that we must take part in your affairs.  \"Here, then, is our challenge. Continue your struggle of ideas, compete with each other for the minds of men, fight your bloodless battles, if you know no other means to attain progress. But do all this _without_ unleashing the terrible forces of power now at your command. Once unleashed, these forces may or may not destroy all that you have gained. But we, the scientists of Venus, promise you this--that on the very day your conflict deteriorates into heedless violence, we will not stand by and let the ugly contagion spread. On that day, we of Venus will act swiftly, mercilessly, and relentlessly--to destroy your world completely.\"  Again, the meeting room exploded in a babble of languages.  \"The vessel which brought me here came as a messenger of peace. But envision it, men of Earth, as a messenger of war. Unstoppable, inexorable, it may return, bearing a different Delegate from Venus--a Delegate of Death, who speaks not in words, but in the explosion of atoms. Think of thousands of such Delegates, fired from a vantage point far beyond the reach of your retaliation. This is the promise and the challenge that will hang in your night sky from this moment forward. Look at the planet Venus, men of Earth, and see a Goddess of Vengeance, poised to wreak its wrath upon those who betray the peace.\"  The Delegate sat down.         *       *       *       *       *  Four days later, a mysterious explosion rocked the quiet "]]]
