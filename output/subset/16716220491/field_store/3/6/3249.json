Your bare feet, your ragged clothes, how poor you are--this is nothing! It doesn't count here--it's what you feel, it's what you believe--it's what you see that counts! I've taught you to read and write, and now you can do anything!

I had a dream--the same one I had the night before you were born. You had grown a man--strong and brave--wise and gentle. The people hung on your words, and did you homage. But you remembered this cabin here in the deep woods and you were humble. I walked with you between two white pillars. It was still and solemn, in there. Outside I could hear the people calling your name. You bowed low and whispered in my ear: \"This is all yours, my Mother. I bought it for you with my life. All that I am I owe to you----\"      [_Her voice sinks to a whisper that is half a laugh of religious     ecstasy._]                               ABE      [_Joyfully._]  See how she's smilin'--Pa!

It's Abraham Lincoln they're discussing--not his wife----                               MRS. LINCOLN  You're sure----?                               BETTY  Sure----! It sounded like a regular dog fight--with one big brute howling----      [_Imitates._]  --the President's name above the din----                               MRS. LINCOLN  But, you can't be sure, my dear----                               BETTY  What on earth could they be discussing you for----?                               MRS. LINCOLN  My loyalty, of course--you know that my brothers are in the Southern Army, fighting the Union. Fools have accused me of giving them important secrets of the Government. When I _hate_ them for all they have done to me and mine----!                               BETTY  But my dear Mrs. Lincoln--no one believes such lies about you now--not even in this bitter campaign--it's absurd----                               MRS. LINCOLN      [_Hesitates._]  That is not the real thing I'm afraid of, child--it's something worse--I'm going to take you into my confidence now--may I?                               BETTY  I'll be tickled to death with the honor----!                               MRS. LINCOLN  And I'm going to ask you to help me----                               BETTY  I'll be in the Cabinet next----!                               MRS. LINCOLN  The truth is, I owe A. T. Stewart and Company an enormous bill for dresses--$60,000----                               BETTY  Sixty thousand--oh, my Lord! That's worse than mine----!                               MRS. LINCOLN  I had to get them! The world said the White House would be disgraced by my awkward husband's régime--I've shown them better! But I just couldn't tell Mr. Lincoln. He has no idea of the cost of clothes. If these jackals have found out and attack him on my account, the thought of it will kill me----                               BETTY  But you know he'd defend you against any one who dares attack you.                               MRS. LINCOLN  Yes, dear--but it would hurt him so to hear it from their brutal lips. I want you to find out from your father, if they know----                               BETTY  And if they know----?                               MRS. LINCOLN  Get here before they do, and I'll head them off--I'll tell Mr. Lincoln first----                               BETTY      [_Smiling._]  On one condition--that you help me----                               MRS. LINCOLN  Anything you ask----                               BETTY  I've promised my fiancé that I would get an appointment for him to see the President on something very important----                               MRS. LINCOLN  Mr. Lincoln will be here in a few minutes. I'll have him see your sweetheart first----                               BETTY  But--it's a"]]]
