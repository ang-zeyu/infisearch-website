For a moment or two she was tempted to scamper back to the farmhouse. And then she thought how pleased her mother would be if she brought that fat fellow home in her mouth and laid him at her mother's feet--how pleased and how proud!  To help her courage the kitten began to lash her tail, jerking it from side to side as she had seen her mother move her own. And she crouched her chubby body lower in the grass.  Then the kitten jumped. And the moment she was within his reach Master Meadow Mouse gave her a smart nip on the nose with his sharp little teeth.  The kitten squalled. And she backed hastily away. \"You'd better run!\" she advised Master Meadow Mouse. \"I shall not give you another chance!\"  But he stood fast. And the kitten didn't give him another chance, either to run from her, or to bite her nose again. She fell into a sudden panic and bounded awkwardly away toward the farmhouse.  And then Master Meadow Mouse ran. He ran home as fast as he could go.  [Illustration]     [Illustration]  4  A Pleasant Stranger   THE whole Meadow Mouse family enjoyed swimming. They liked to live near water. That was why they made their home in the low meadow, where Broad Brook ran deeper and more quietly than in the hillside pasture. And Black Creek, too, was near-by. So the Meadow Mouse family never had to travel far when they wanted a cool dip.  Almost as soon as he was able to wander about the meadow alone Master Meadow Mouse began to swim. He didn't have to be taught, any more than he had to be taught how to walk. Swimming came to him as easily as eating. And his mother never worried about his being drowned. But when he went for his first swim in Black Creek Mrs. Meadow Mouse couldn't help feeling a bit anxious.  \"Look out!\" she warned her son. \"Look out for the Pickerel tribe! They're the most dangerous fish in the creek.\"  \"Yes!\" said Master Meadow Mouse. \"I know that. I've been told about them already.\"  \"You have!\" his mother exclaimed. \"Who told you?\"  \"A greenish gentleman with a very wide smile and queer, bulging eyes,\" Master Meadow Mouse replied.  \"That's Ferdinand Frog!\" Mrs. Meadow Mouse cried. \"He's as dangerous as any Pickerel that ever swam. Where did you meet him?\"  \"I stood on the bank of the creek one day and saw him among the lily pads,\" her son explained. \"We had quite a long talk together.... I forgot to mention it to you,\" he added.  The news made Mrs. Meadow Mouse turn slightly pale. She shuddered although the day was warm; for she feared and detested Ferdinand Frog.  \"Don't ever go near that slippery villain!\" she warned her son. \"If you ever see him when you are swimming in the creek, make for the shore at once.\"  Now, Master Meadow Mouse sometimes thought that he knew more than his mother, about certain matters. And he was inclined to take her advice lightly.  \"Ferdinand Frog was very pleasant when I met him,\" he remarked. \"He cracked jokes. And he laughed at them himself.\"  \"Oh, he's pleasant enough,\" Mrs. Meadow Mouse agreed. \"He'd grin and swallow you at the same time with that great mouth of his. That's what makes him so dangerous.\"  \"Well, he's a fine swimmer, anyhow,\" her son declared.  \"Another reason why you should avoid him!\" his mother retorted.  \"You ought to see him dive,\" said Master Meadow Mouse. \"He promised to teach me to dive if I'd join him in the water.\"  \"It's a mercy you didn't,\". Mrs. Meadow Mouse gasped. \"I'm glad you had sense enough to stay on the bank.\"  \"Oh, I knew better than to take a swim in the creek that day,\" Master Meadow Mouse said. \"The Pickerel family were nosing about among the pickerel weeds around the bend of the creek. I saw them myself. And Mr. Frog told me I ought to beware of them. He was very anxious--so he said--about me and the Pickerel. He said he didn't want them to catch me. He was very kind, I thought.\"  \"Kind!\" Mrs. Meadow Mouse spluttered. \"He didn't want them to catch you because he hopes to catch you himself!\"  [Illustration]     [Illustration]  5  Mr. Frog Insists   MASTER MEADOW MOUSE had come to Black Creek to enjoy his first swim in its dark, sluggish water. But when he arrived on the bank he changed his mind about swimming there that day. For whom should he see but Ferdinand Frog, sitting on a rock at the edge of the creek.  For once Master Meadow Mouse was ready to take his mother's advice. She had told him to beware of Ferdinand Frog and never, never, never to enter the water when that pleasant gentleman was in it.  Ferdinand Frog proved to be as agreeable as ever. When he caught sight of Master Meadow Mouse Mr. Frog bade him a hearty good morning in a deep voice which was vastly different from the tiny squeak of the small person on the bank.  \"You've come for a swim--haven't you?\" said Ferdinand Frog.  Master Meadow Mouse admitted that he _had_ intended to swim. But he explained that the water looked wetter than usual and he thought he'd wait till another day. \"Besides,\" he added, \"the sun has gone under a cloud and my suit wouldn't dry quickly enough.\"  \"Come right in and have your swim!\" Mr. Frog urged him. \"You can change your clothes as soon as you get home.\"  \"Oh, no--I can't,\" said Master Meadow Mouse.  \"Why not?\" Mr. Frog asked him.  \"Because I haven't any more!\"  \"Now, that's a pity,\" Ferdinand Frog told him. \"A handsome youngster like you ought to have a best suit to wear on special occasions.\"  Master Meadow Mouse looked interested.  \"I'd like a nice new suit,\" he replied. \"But where am I going to get it?\"  \"You've come to the right place!\" Mr. Frog cried. \"Maybe you didn't know that I'm a tailor. I'll make you a new suit myself!\"  \"That's very kind of you,\" said Master Meadow Mouse a bit doubtfully. \"But I don't know how I could pay you.\"  The tailor laughed merrily.  \"Don't you worry about that!\" he exclaimed. \"I'll get my pay somehow. And now you must come to my shop at once. I want to take your measure.\"  Mr. Meadow Mouse shook his head.  \"No!\" he told Mr. Frog. \"I'm not going to your shop. I'm not going a single step nearer to you than I am now. I've taken _your_ measure already, Mr. Frog. I know your game. And you can't catch me that way.\"  For once Ferdinand Frog forgot to laugh. He was so surprised that his mouth fell wide open as he stared at Master Meadow Mouse.  He had an enormous mouth. Master Meadow Mouse shivered slightly as he looked down Mr. Frog's throat.  The tailor closed his mouth almost immediately. For a huge pickerel came nosing among the lily pads. And spying Mr. Frog, he at once darted towards him.  Mr. Frog swam off in great haste.  \"That Pickerel person,\" said Mr. Meadow Mouse aloud, \"means to take Mr. Frog's measure if he can.\"     [Illustration]  6  Meeting Mr. Crow   DURING his first summer in Pleasant Valley Master Meadow Mouse had often noticed old Mr. Crow flying from the woods to the cornfield. Once in a while Mr. Crow dropped down into the meadow on some business or other. But Master Meadow Mouse did not fear him. The grass was high in the meadow, screening the goings and comings of Master Meadow Mouse from prying eyes.  But after haying time the meadow was a different place. There was no cover over Master Meadow Mouse's paths. He had to be watchful all the time, because Henry Hawk had an unpleasant habit of sailing high up in the sky and dropping down like lightning when he saw anybody like Master Meadow Mouse stirring.  Old Mr. Crow continued to journey daily between the cornfield and the woods. But Master Meadow Mouse paid little heed to him. He believed Mr. Crow to be harmless, so long as he didn't catch small folk in the cornfield. The old gentleman was very touchy about corn. He flew into a rage when anybody but himself ate even one kernel.  Though Master Meadow Mouse would have liked a taste of corn as much as anybody else, he was careful to keep away from the cornfield in the daytime. He didn't wish to bring down Mr. Crow's wrath upon his small head.  \"Never let Mr. Crow catch you taking any corn!\" Mrs. Meadow Mouse had told her son during one of the daily lessons that she gave him. \"If you must have corn, wait until after sunset. Mr. Crow goes to bed early.\"  Now, it happened that just before haying time Mrs. Meadow Mouse had stopped giving her son lessons. She said that she had told him everything she knew. She had told him everything at least a hundred times. And she declared that if he hadn't learned what he needed to know, he never would.  Mrs. Meadow Mouse, however, had forgotten one thing--one very important thing. There was a little trick of old Mr. Crow's that she had never mentioned to her son.  So it wasn't his fault that he was caught unawares one day, soon after Farmer Green cut the grass in the meadow.  Master Meadow Mouse was tripping homewards one day, after a little excursion. He was traveling fast, for he felt, amidst the short stubble, as if all the world were watching him. And he kept a sharp eye cocked upwards at the sky, lest Henry Hawk should surprise him. Besides, he had heard the _boom_ of a bittern that morning. And the day before he had seen a butcher-bird skimming low over the meadow.  Those two, he knew, were every bit as dangerous as Henry Hawk.  You see, Master Meadow Mouse had learned to expect birds to descend upon him from the air. It had never occurred to him that a bird would lurk on the ground, in wait for him. So he had a sudden fright, almost at his doorway, when he ran plump upon a big black person standing behind a knoll.  [Illustration: Master Meadow Mouse ran plump into old Mr. Crow]  It was old Mr. Crow. And Master Meadow Mouse thought he had an odd glitter in his snapping eyes.  \"I--I haven't been taking any corn,\" Master Meadow Mouse stammered.  [Illustration]     [Illustration]  7  Nothing but Air   OLD Mr. Crow didn't say a single word when Master Meadow Mouse met him face to face in the meadow. But a wicked glitter in Mr. Crow's eyes warned Master Meadow Mouse that there was trouble ahead for him.  If"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24872"],["title","The Tale of Master Meadow Mouse (#2)"],["body","hole leading to his home hadn't been close at hand there's no telling what would have happened to him. Anyhow, just as Mr. Crow lunged at him, with a wild flapping of his broad wings, Master Meadow Mouse slipped to one side and whisked through his doorway.  Old Mr. Crow coughed hoarsely.  \"What's your hurry?\" he cried. \"I've been waiting around here for you for a long while. Can't you spend a few moments of your valuable time with me!\"  Now, it was true that the old gentleman had been lingering in the neighborhood. The corn wasn't quite ripe enough to suit him. So he had decided to go a-mousing that morning.  His way of hunting, however, was not like that of other birds. Mr. Crow chose to do his hunting afoot. He was too wise to waste any effort looking for mice when the grass was high. But after haying he had often gone a-mousing in years past. And he had found the sport to be quite worth while. Stalking about the close cropped meadow he had surprised many distant cousins of Master Meadow Mouse who never returned home to tell the story of their meetings with the black scamp. Maybe Mr. Crow was getting slow in his old age. He had never come so near to catching a Meadow Mouse before, only to be disappointed. It was no wonder that he felt peevish.  At first Master Meadow Mouse did not answer Mr. Crow when the old gentleman called down the tunnel that led to the nest beneath the sod. But soon Master Meadow Mouse remembered that Mr. Crow could get no more than his bill inside the hole. And then Master Meadow Mouse found his voice again.  \"I don't want to go above ground,\" he said. \"Can't you talk to me, where I am?\"  \"It's not easy to do that,\" Mr. Crow grumbled. \"I have to speak too loud; and my voice is hoarse to-day.\"  \"Stick your bill into my tunnel as far as it will go,\" Master Meadow Mouse suggested. \"Then you won't have to shout. I could hear a whisper if you'd do as I say.\"  Old Mr. Crow thrust his bill down the hole.  \"I don't like this,\" he croaked. \"I can't see you.\"  \"That's because you're shutting out all the light,\" Master Meadow Mouse explained.  \"I doubt it,\" said Mr. Crow angrily. \"I believe you've drawn a curtain across the other end of this tunnel. And I can't talk to anybody through a curtain. I _refuse_ to injure my voice trying to talk with anybody that won't give me a more friendly welcome when I call on him.\"  \"Talk away!\" Master Meadow Mouse urged his caller. \"There's nothing between us to keep me from hearing you. Nothing but a foot of air!\"  \"Ah!\" Mr. Crow cried. \"I _knew_ you had something in that tunnel. Remove the air at once, sir, or I'll go away and leave you.\"  \"If his bill wasn't so hard--if it was as soft as the Kitten's nose--I'd bite it,\" Master Meadow Mouse thought.  And while he was thinking, all at once a shaft of light trickled inside his house. Old Mr. Crow had gone grumbling on his way.  [Illustration]     [Illustration]  8  Moses Mouse   MASTER MEADOW MOUSE felt ill at ease. Now that the grass had been cut from the meadow he began to think he didn't care to live there any longer. After his adventure with old Mr. Crow, Master Meadow Mouse scarcely dared stray from his dooryard in the daytime. Anybody, almost, could see him as he crept through the stubble.  At night he ventured further from home. And once he went even as far as the farmyard.  To his surprise he found that the grass in Farmer Green's yard was longer than he had ever seen it. Earlier in the summer, when Master Meadow Mouse visited that spot, he had been afraid to cross the lawn because it was clipped so short. But now he could creep through the thick green carpet and nobody could see him, unless a waving grass blade happened to catch somebody's eye. Everybody at the farmhouse had been too busy with haying to spend any time running a lawn mower.  Why not move to the farmyard? The thought came into Master Meadow Mouse's head. It seemed to him that the farmyard would be a fine place to live. There was grain scattered here and there, where somebody had fed the hens. There was the duck pond near-by, when he wanted a swim.  \"I'll come!\" Master Meadow Mouse decided. \"I'll come--if I can find a good place for a nest.\"  Thereupon he began to look about for a site for his new home. And it wasn't long before he had found one that suited him. When he saw the woodpile he squeaked with delight.  \"The very place!\" he cried. \"I'll begin to built my nest to-night.\"  So he set to work. He carried dead leaves and dried grass to the woodpile and started to make a snug home for himself in a space between the logs, well inside the heap of wood. And he had just crept from a chink and stood under the stars when a tiny voice greeted him with a cry, \"What ho, stranger!\"  Master Meadow Mouse looked around. And there on a stick of wood just behind him was a plump gray person. The newcomer looked the least bit like Master Meadow Mouse himself, except that his tail was ever so much longer.  \"I'm Moses Mouse and I live in the farmhouse,\" said the gray gentleman.  \"I'm Master Meadow Mouse and I'm going to live in this woodpile,\" said the reddish-brown chap in reply.  \"That's good news,\" Moses Mouse remarked. \"But you must look out for Miss Snooper,\" he added.  \"Who is she?\" Master Meadow Mouse asked his new friend.  \"Miss Snooper--\" Moses Mouse explained--\"Miss Snooper is our name for Miss Kitty Cat. She lives in the farmhouse. And when she isn't indoors she's usually prowling about the yard.\"  To the great astonishment of Moses Mouse, the short-tailed stranger seemed in no wise startled by his news.  \"Huh!\" Master Meadow Mouse exclaimed. \"If this Miss Snooper--as you call her--bothers me, I'll serve her as I did one of her kittens.\"  \"What did you do to the kitten?\" Moses Mouse inquired with great interest.  \"I bit her nose,\" said Master Meadow Mouse.  Moses Mouse gazed at him with horror.  \"Don't try that on the old lady!\" he cried. \"If you do, you'll be sorry.\"  [Illustration]     [Illustration]  9  Miss Snooper   MOSES MOUSE, who lived in the farmhouse, had warned Master Meadow Mouse. He had warned him to look out for Miss Snooper's nose.  Master Meadow Mouse did not pay any great attention to his new friend's advice. He was building himself a new home in Farmer Green's woodpile. And he went about his work as if there wasn't a cat within a hundred miles.  Then, one day, he caught a glimpse of Miss Snooper. He peeped out from a chink in the woodpile and saw her sitting on a stick of wood. She was so near him that Master Meadow Mouse could have leaped upon her back in one spring.  But he didn't do that. He gazed at her with round eyes, for Miss Snooper looked very fierce, especially when she opened her mouth and showed her sharp teeth as she yawned. Master Meadow Mouse saw that she was a quite different creature from the awkward kitten whom he had bitten on the nose earlier in the summer.  \"Goodness!\" thought Master Meadow Mouse, staring at Miss Snooper with great awe. \"Goodness! Her whiskers are longer than mine!\"  And then he drew back very softly and crept to his nest in the woodpile.  That night Moses Mouse came to make another call. And he brought his wife with him, so that she might see the stranger with the short tail who was going to live in Farmer Green's woodpile.  \"I saw Miss Snooper to-day,\" Master Meadow Mouse told them.  \"Did you bite her nose?\" Mrs. Mouse asked him eagerly; for her husband had told her all about the newcomer.  \"No!\" said Master Meadow Mouse. \"No! I was too busy, building my new home, to stop and bite her.\"  \"Isn't he brave!\" whispered Mrs. Moses Mouse to her husband.  From where they sat, on the top of the woodpile, Master Meadow Mouse and his callers caught sight of a dark shape that moved stealthily towards them through the shadows.  \"It's Miss Snooper herself!\" Mrs. Mouse cried. And quick as a wink she dived down among the sticks of wood, with her husband following close behind her.  \"Probably Master Meadow Mouse will bite Miss Snooper's nose this time,\" she said to Moses, when she had reached a safe retreat.  \"He isn't biting it now,\" Moses Mouse replied, \"because he's crowding right behind me.\"  \"Miss Snooper has come,\" Mrs. Mouse said to Master Meadow Mouse. \"Maybe you didn't understand that it was she.\"  \"Let her come!\" Master Meadow Mouse squeaked.  \"Isn't he brave!\" Mrs. Moses Mouse murmured.  \"I'll bite her nose if she sticks it into this crevice,\" Master Mouse declared.  \"Isn't he brave!\" she breathed into her husband's ear.  \"I'm not so sure of that,\" said Moses Mouse in an undertone. \"He _talks_ a good deal about nose-biting. I should like to see him _do_ it. I knew Miss Snooper was skulking around the yard to-night. That's why I came to call on this chap. I wanted to see whether he'd fight or run.\"  Meanwhile Miss Snooper climbed all over the woodpile. She could hear faint squeaks somewhere. And she was almost frantic because she couldn't squirm under the wood and find whoever was talking.  It was almost morning before Moses Mouse and his wife dared to steal back to the farmhouse. When they left the woodpile Master Meadow Mouse left it too. He had decided, during the night, that he wouldn't live in the farmyard.  \"I've become very tired of this old Cat,\" he told his companions--Mr. and Mrs. Moses Mouse. \"I shouldn't care to stay where I had to see her often.\"  [Illustration]     [Illustration]  10  A Handy Sign   HUNTING played a great part in the life of Master Meadow Mouse. Somebody or other was always hunting him. And he was always hunting for something to eat. He spent a good deal of his time away from home, looking for seeds and grain. On the other hand, he spent a good deal of his time in his house; for Master Meadow Mouse liked to take naps--especially in the daytime.  After he started to live in Farmer Green's woodpile, but moved away from it before he had finished building his nest there, Master Meadow Mouse settled near the fence between the meadow and the pasture.
