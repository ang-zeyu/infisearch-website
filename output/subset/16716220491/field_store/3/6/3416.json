He had brought with him a bright blue book, stoutly covered and brassily locked, on which was inscribed the word \"Schemes.\"  That book was filled with writing of a most private kind and of a frenzied calculation which sprawled diagonally over pages, as for example:    Buy up old houses  . . . . . . . . . say  2,000 pounds.   Pull them down . . . . . . . . . . . say    500 pounds.   Erect erect 50 Grand Flats . . . . . say 10,000 pounds.

By this means means doing good turn to working classes solving houseing problem and making money which can be distribbuted distribbutted to the poor.   Mr. Augustus Tibbetts, late of H.M. Houssa Rifles, was, as his doorplate testified, the Managing Director of \"Schemes, Ltd.\"  He was a severe looking young man, who wore a gold-rimmed monocle on his grey check waistcoat and occasionally in his left eye.  His face was of that brick-red which spoke of a life spent under tropical suns, and when erect he conveyed a momentary impression of a departed militarism.  He uncurled his feet from the table, and, picking up a letter, read it through aloud--that is to say, he read certain words, skipped others, and substituted private idioms for all he could not or would not trouble to pronounce.  \"Dear Sir,\" (he mumbled), \"as old friends of your dear uncle, and so on and so forth, we are taking the first opportunity of making widdly widdly wee....  Our Mr. Fred Pole will call upon you and place himself widdly widdly wee--tum tiddly um tum.--Yours truly.\"  Mr. Tibbetts frowned at the letter and struck a bell with unnecessary violence.  There appeared in the doorway a wonderful man in scarlet breeches and green zouave jacket.  On his head was a dull red tarbosh, on his feet scarlet slippers, and about his waist a sash of Oriental audacity.  His face, large and placid, was black, and, for all his suggestiveness of the brilliant East, he was undoubtedly negroid.  The costume was one of Mr. Tibbetts's schemes.  It was faithfully copied from one worn by a gentleman of colour who serves the Turkish coffee at the Wistaria Restaurant.  It may be said that there was no special reason why an ordinary business man should possess a bodyguard at all, and less reason why he should affect one who had the appearance of a burlesque Othello, but Mr. Augustus Tibbetts, though a business man, was not ordinary.  \"Bones\"--for such a name he bore without protest in the limited circles of his friendship--looked up severely.  \"Ali,\" he demanded, \"have you posted the ledger?\"  \"Sir,\" said Ali, with a profound obeisance, \"the article was too copious for insertion in aperture of collection box, so it was transferred to the female lady behind postal department counter.\"  Bones leapt up, staring.  \"Goodness gracious, Heavens alive, you silly old ass--you--you haven't posted it--in the post?\"  \"Sir,\" said Ali reproachfully, \"you instructed posting volume in exact formula.  Therefore I engulfed it in wrappings and ligatures of string, and safely delivered it to posting authority.\"  Bones sank back in his chair.  \"It's no use--no use, Ali,\" he said sadly, \"my poor uncivilized savage, it's not your fault.  I shall never bring you up to date, my poor silly old josser.  When I say 'post' the ledger, I mean write down all the money you've spent on cabs in the stamp book.  Goodness gracious alive! You can't run a business without system, Ali!  Don't you know that, my dear old image?  How the dooce do you think the auditors are to know how I spend my jolly old uncle's money if you don't write it down, hey? Posting means writing.  Good Heavens\"--a horrid thought dawned on him--\"who did you post it to?\"  \"Lord,\" said Ali calmly, \"destination of posted volume is your lordship's private residency.\"  All's English education had been secured in the laboratory of an English scientist in Sierra Leone, and long association with that learned man had endowed him with a vocabulary at once impressive and recondite.  Bones gave a resigned sigh.  \"I'm expecting----\" he began, when a silvery bell tinkled.  It was silvery because the bell was of silver.  Bones looked up, pulled down his waistcoat, smoothed back his hair, fixed his eye-glass, and took up a long quill pen with a vivid purple feather.  \"Show them in,\" he said gruffly.  \"Them\" was one well-dressed young man in a shiny silk hat, who, when admitted to the inner sanctum, came soberly across the room, balancing his hat.  \"Ah, Mr. Pole--Mr. Fred Pole.\"  Bones read the visitor's card with the scowl which he adopted for business hours.  \"Yes, yes.  Be seated, Mr. Pole.  I shall not keep you a minute.\"  He had been waiting all the morning for Mr. Pole.  He had been weaving dreams from the letter-heading above Mr. Pole's letter.  Ships ... ships ... house-flags ... brass-buttoned owners....  He waved Mr. Fred to a chair and wrote furiously.  This frantic pressure of work was a phenomenon which invariably coincided with the arrival of a visitor.  It was, I think, partly due to nervousness and partly to his dislike of strangers.  Presently he finished, blotted the paper, stuck it in an envelope, addressed it, and placed it in his drawer.  Then he took up the card.  \"Mr. Pole?\" he said.  \"Mr. Pole,\" repeated that gentleman.  \"Mr. _Fred_ Pole?\" asked Bones, with an air of surprise.  \"Mr. Fred Pole,\" admitted the other soberly.  Bones looked from the card to the visitor as though he could not believe his eyes.  \"We have a letter from you somewhere,\" he said, searching the desk. \"Ah, here it is!\"  (It was, in fact, the only document on the table.) \"Yes, yes, to be sure.  I'm very glad to meet you.\"  He rose, solemnly shook hands, sat down again and coughed.  Then he took up the ivory paper-knife to chew, coughed again as he detected the lapse, and put it down with a bang.  \"I thought I'd like to come along and see you, Mr. Tibbetts,\" said Fred in his gentle voice; \"we are so to speak, associated in business.\"  \"Indeed?\" said Bones.  \"In-deed?\"  \"You see, Mr. Tibbetts,\" Fred went on, with a sad smile, \"your lamented uncle, before he went out of business, sold us his ships.  He died a month later.\"  He sighed and Bones sighed.  \"Your uncle was a great man, Mr. Tibbetts,\" he said, \"one of the greatest business men in this little city.  What a man!\"  \"Ah!\" said Bones, shaking his head mournfully.  He had never met his uncle and had seldom heard of him.  Saul Tibbetts was reputedly a miser, and his language was of such violence that the infant Augustus was invariably hurried to the nursery on such rare occasions as old Saul paid a family visit.  His inheritance had come to Bones as in a dream, from the unreality of which he had not yet awakened.  \"I must confess, Mr. Tibbetts,\" said Fred, \"that I have often had qualms of conscience about your uncle, and I have been on the point of coming round to see you several times.  This morning I said to my brother, 'Joe,' I said, 'I'm going round to see Tibbetts.'  Forgive the familiarity, but we talk of firms like the Rothschilds and the Morgans without any formality.\"  \"Naturally, naturally, naturally,\" murmured Bones gruffly.  \"I said: 'I'll go and see Tibbetts and get it off my chest.  If he wants those ships back at the price we paid for them, or even less, he shall have them.'  'Fred,' he said, 'you're too sensitive for business.'  'Joe,' I said, 'my conscience works even in business hours.'\"  A light dawned on Bones and he brightened visibly.  \"Ah, yes, my dear old Pole,\" he said almost cheerily, \"I understand. You diddled my dear old uncle--bless his heart--out of money, and you want to pay it back.  Fred\"--Bones rose and extended his knuckly hand--\"you're a jolly old sportsman, and you can put it there!\"  \"What I was going to say----\" began Fred seriously agitated.  \"Not a word.  We'll have a bottle on this.  What will you have--ginger-beer or cider?\"  Mr. Fred suppressed a shudder with difficulty.  \"Wait, wait, Mr. Tibbetts,\" he begged; \"I think I ought to explain.  We did not, of course, knowingly rob your uncle----\"  \"No, no, naturally,\" said Bones, with a facial contortion which passed for a wink.  \"Certainly not.  We business men never rob anybody.  Ali, bring the drinks!\"  \"We did not consciously rob him,\" continued Mr. Fred desperately, \"but what we did do---- ah, this is my confession!\"  \"You borrowed a bit and didn't pay it back.  Ah, naughty!\" said Bones. \"Out with the corkscrew, Ali.  What shall it be--a cream soda or non-alcoholic ale?\"  Mr. Fred looked long and earnestly at the young man.  \"Mr. Tibbetts,\" he said, and suddenly grasped the hand of Bones, \"I hope we are going to be friends.  I like you.  That's my peculiarity--I like people or I dislike them.  Now that I've told you that we bought two ships from your uncle for one hundred and forty thousand pounds when we knew--yes, positively knew--they were worth at least twenty thousand pounds more--now I've told you this, I feel happier.\"  \"Worth twenty thousand pounds more?\" said Bones thoughtfully. Providence was working overtime for him, he thought.  \"Of anybody's money,\" said Fred stoutly.  \"I don't care where you go, my dear chap.  Ask Cole--he's the biggest shipping lawyer in this city--ask my brother, who, I suppose, is the greatest shipping authority in the world, or--what's the use of asking 'em?--ask yourself.  If you're not Saul Tibbetts all over again, if you haven't the instinct and the eye and the brain of a shipowner--why, I'm a Dutchman!  That's what I am--a Dutchman!\"  He picked up his hat and his lips were pressed tight--a gesture and a grimace which stood for grim conviction.  \"What are they"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27525"],["title","Bones in London (#2)"],["body","to-day?\" asked Bones, after a pause.  \"What are they worth to-day?\"  Mr. Fred frowned heavily at the ceiling. \"Now, what are they worth to-day?  I forget how much I've spent on 'em--they're in dock now.\"  Bones tightened _his_ lips, too.  \"They're in dock now?\" he said.  He scratched his nose.  \"Dear old Fred Pole,\" he said, \"you're a jolly old soul.  By Jove that's not bad! 'Pole' an' 'soul' rhyme--did you notice it?\"  Fred had noticed it.  \"It's rum,\" said Bones, shaking his head, \"it is rum how things get about.  How did you know, old fellow-citizen, that I was going in for shippin'?\"  Mr. Fred Pole did not know that Bones was going in for shipping, but he smiled.  \"There are few things that happen in the City that I _don't_ know,\" he admitted modestly.  \"The Tibbetts Line,\" said Bones firmly, \"will fly a house-flag of purple and green diagonally--that is, from corner to corner.  There will be a yellow anchor in a blue wreath in one corner and a capital T in a red wreath in the other.\"  \"Original, distinctly original,\" said Fred in wondering admiration. \"Wherever did you get that idea?\"  \"I get ideas,\" confessed Bones, blushing, \"some times in the night, sometimes in the day.  The fleet\"--Bones liked the sound of the word and repeated it--\"the fleet will consist of the _Augustus_, the _Sanders_--a dear old friend of mine living at Hindhead--the _Patricia_--another dear old friend of mine living at Hindhead, too--in fact, in the same house.  To tell you the truth, dear old Fred Pole, she's married to the other ship.  And there'll be the _Hamilton_, another precious old soul, a very, very, very, very dear friend of mine who's comin' home shortly----\"  \"Well, what shall we say, Mr. Tibbetts?\" said Fred, who had an early luncheon appointment.  \"Would you care to buy the two boats at the same price we gave your uncle for them?\"  Bones rang his bell.  \"I'm a business man, dear old Fred,\" said he soberly.  \"There's no time like the present, and I'll fix the matter--_now!_\"  He said \"now\" with a ferociousness which was intended to emphasize his hard and inflexible business character.  Fred came into the private office of Pole & Pole after lunch that day, and there was in his face a great light and a peace which was almost beautiful.  But never beamed the face of Fred so radiantly as the countenance of the waiting Joe.  He lay back in his chair, his cigar pointing to the ceiling.  \"Well, Fred?\"--there was an anthem in his voice.  \"Very well, Joe.\"  Fred hung up his unnecessary umbrella.  \"I've sold the _Fairies_!\"  Joe said it and Fred said it.  They said it together.  There was the same lilt of triumph in each voice, and both smiles vanished at the identical instant.  \"_You've_ sold the _Fairies_!\" they said.  They might have been rehearsing this scene for months, so perfect was the chorus.  \"Wait a bit, Joe,\" said Fred; \"let's get the hang of this.  I understand that you left the matter to me.\"  \"I did; but, Fred, I was so keen on the idea I had that I had to nip in before you.  Of course, I didn't go to him as Pole & Pole----\"  \"To him?  What him?\" asked Fred, breathing hard.  \"To What's-his-name--Bones.\"  Fred took his blue silk handkerchief from his pocket and dabbed his face.  \"Go on, Joe,\" he said sadly  \"I got him just before he went out to lunch.  I sent up the United Merchant Shippers' card--it's our company, anyway.  Not a word about Pole & Pole.\"  \"Oh, no, of course not!\" said Fred.  \"And, my boy,\"--this was evidently Joe's greatest achievement, for he described the fact with gusto--\"not a word about the names of the ships.  I just sold him two steamers, so and so tonnage, so and so classification----\"  \"For how much?\"  Fred was mildly curious.  It was the curiosity which led a certain political prisoner to feel the edge of the axe before it beheaded him.  \"A hundred and twenty thousand!\" cried Joe joyously.  \"He's starting a fleet, he says.  He's calling it the Tibbetts Line, and bought a couple of ships only this morning.\"  Fred examined the ceiling carefully before he spoke.  \"Joe,\" he said, \"was it a firm deal?  Did you put pen to paper?\"  \"You-bet-your-dear-sweet-life,\" said Joe, scornful at the suggestion that he had omitted such an indispensable part of the negotiation.  \"So did I, Joe,\" said Fred.  \"Those two ships he bought were the two _Fairies_.\"  There was a dead silence.  \"Well,\" said Joe uneasily, after a while, \"we can get a couple of ships----\"  \"Where, Joe?  You admitted yesterday there weren't two boats in the world on the market.\"  Another long silence.  \"I did it for the best, Fred.\"  Fred nodded  \"Something must be done.  We can't sell a man what we haven't got. Joe, couldn't you go and play golf this afternoon whilst I wangle this matter out?\"  Joe nodded and rose solemnly.  He took down his umbrella from the peg and his shiny silk hat from another peg, and tiptoed from the room.  From three o'clock to four Mr. Fred Pole sat immersed in thought, and at last, with a big, heavy sigh, he unlocked his safe, took out his cheque-book and pocketed it.  Bones was on the point of departure, after a most satisfactory day's work, when Fred Pole was announced.  Bones greeted him like unto a brother--caught him by the hand at the very entrance and, still holding him thus, conducted him to one of his beautiful chairs.  \"By Jove, dear old Fred,\" he babbled, \"it's good of you, old fellow--really good of you!  Business, my jolly old shipowner, waits for no man.  Ali, my cheque-book!\"  \"A moment--just a moment, dear Mr. Bones,\" begged Fred.  \"You don't mind my calling you by the name which is already famous in the City?\"  Bones looked dubious.  \"Personally, I prefer Tibbetts,\" said Fred.  \"Personally, dear old Fred, so do I,\" admitted Bones.  \"I've come on a curious errand,\" said Fred in such hollow tones that Bones started.  \"The fact is, old man, I'm----\"  He hung his head, and Bones laid a sympathetic hand on his shoulder.  \"Anybody is liable to get that way, my jolly old roysterer,\" he said. \"Speakin' for myself, drink has no effect upon me--due to my jolly old nerves of iron an' all that sort of thing.\"  \"I'm ashamed of myself,\" said Fred.  \"Nothing to be ashamed of, my poor old toper,\" said Bones honestly in error.  \"Why, I remember once----\"  \"As a business man, Mr. Tibbetts,\" said Fred bravely, \"can you forgive sentiment?\"  \"Sentiment!  Why, you silly old josser, I'm all sentiment, dear old thing!  Why, I simply cry myself to sleep over dear old Charles What's-his-name's books!\"  \"It's sentiment,\" said Fred brokenly.  \"I just can't--I simply can't part with those two ships I sold you.\"  \"Hey?\" said Bones.  \"They were your uncle's, but they have an association for me and my brother which it would be--er--profane to mention.  Mr. Tibbetts, let us cry off our bargain.\"  Bones sniffed and rubbed his nose.  \"Business, dear old Fred,\" he said gently.  \"Bear up an' play the man, as dear old Francis Drake said when they stopped him playin' cricket. Business, old friend.  I'd like to oblige you, but----\"  He shook his head rapidly  Mr. Fred slowly produced his cheque-book and laid it on the desk with the sigh of one who was about to indite his last wishes.  \"You shall not be the loser,\" he said, with a catch in his voice, for he was genuinely grieved.  \"I must pay for my weakness.  What is five hundred pounds?\"  \"What is a thousand, if it comes to that, Freddy?\" said Bones. \"Gracious goodness, I shall be awfully disappointed if you back out--I shall be so vexed, really.\"  \"Seven hundred and fifty?\" asked Fred, with pleading in his eye.  \"Make it a thousand, dear old Fred,\" said Bones; \"I can't add up fifties.\"  So \"in consideration\" (as Fred wrote rapidly and Bones signed more rapidly) \"of the sum of one thousand pounds (say £1,000), the contract as between &c., &c.,\" was cancelled, and Fred became again the practical man of affairs.  \"Dear old Fred,\" said Bones, folding the cheque and sticking it in his pocket, \"I'm goin' to own up--frankness is a vice with me--that I don't understand much about the shippin' business.  But tell me, my jolly old merchant, why do fellers sell you ships in the mornin' an' buy 'em back in the afternoon?\"  \"Business, Mr. Tibbetts,\" said Fred, smiling, \"just big business.\"  Bones sucked an inky finger.  \"Dinky business for me, dear old thing,\" he said.  \"I've got a thousand from you an' a thousand from the other Johnny who sold me two ships. Bless my life an' soul----\"  \"The other fellow,\" said Fred faintly--\"a fellow from the United Merchant Shippers?\"  \"That was the dear lad,\" said Bones.  \"And has he cried off his bargain, too?\"  \"Positively!\" said Bones.  \"A very, very nice, fellow.  He told me I could call him Joe--jolly old Joe!\"  \"Jolly old Joe!\" repeated Fred mechanically, as he left the office, and all the way home he was saying \"Jolly old Joe!\"     CHAPTER II  HIDDEN TREASURE  Mrs. Staleyborn's first husband was a dreamy Fellow of a Learned University.  Her second husband had begun life at the bottom of the ladder as a three-card trickster, and by strict attention to business and the exercise of his natural genius, had attained to the proprietorship of a bucket-shop.  When Mrs. Staleyborn was Miss Clara Smith, she had been housekeeper to Professor Whitland, a biologist who discovered her indispensability, and was only vaguely aware of the social gulf which yawned between the youngest son of the late Lord Bortledyne and the only daughter of Albert Edward Smith, mechanic.  To the Professor she was Miss _H. Sapiens_--an agreeable, featherless plantigrade biped of the genus _Homo_.  She was also thoroughly domesticated and cooked like an angel, a nice woman who apparently never knew that her husband had a Christian name, for she called him \"Mr. Whitland\" to the day of his death.  The strain and embarrassment of the new relationship with her master were intensified by the arrival of a daughter, and doubled when that daughter came to a knowledgeable age."]]]
