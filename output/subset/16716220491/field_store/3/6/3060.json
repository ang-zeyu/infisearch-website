In a nutshell, since you're going to be a house guest at the Bullones'--we suspect Ipscott Bullone of being the head of a conspiracy to take over the government.\"  \"What do you mean--_take over the government_?\" demanded Orne. \"The Galactic High Commissioner _is_ the government--subject to the Constitution and the Assemblymen who elected him.\"  \"We've a situation that could explode into another Rim War, and we think he's at the heart of it,\" said Stetson. \"We've eighty-one touchy planets, all of them old-line steadies that have been in the League for years. And on every one of them we have reason to believe there's a clan of traitors sworn to overthrow the League. Even on your home planet--Chargon.\"  \"You want me to go home for my convalescence?\" asked Orne. \"Haven't been there since I was seventeen. I'm not sure that--\"  \"No, dammit! We want you as the Bullones' house guest! And speaking of that, would you mind explaining how they were chosen to ride herd on you?\"  \"There's an odd thing,\" said Orne. \"All those gags in the I-A about old Upshook Ipscott Bullone ... and then I find that his wife went to school with my mother.\"  \"Have you met Himself?\"  \"He brought his wife to the hospital a couple of times.\"  Again, Stetson looked to the southwest, then back to Orne. A pensive look came over his face. \"Every schoolkid knows how the Nathians and the Marakian League fought it out in the Rim War--how the old civilization fell apart--and it all seems kind of distant,\" he said.  \"Five hundred standard years,\" said Orne.  \"And maybe no farther away than yesterday,\" murmured Stetson. He cleared his throat.         *       *       *       *       *  And Orne wondered why Stetson was moving so cautiously. _Something deep troubling him._ A sudden thought struck Orne. He said: \"You spoke of trust. Has this conspiracy involved the I-A?\"  \"We think so,\" said Stetson. \"About a year ago, an R&R archeological team was nosing around some ruins on Dabih. The place was all but vitrified in the Rim War, but a whole bank of records from a Nathian outpost escaped.\" He glanced sidelong at Orne. \"The Rah&Rah boys couldn't make sense out of the records. No surprise. They called in an I-A crypt-analyst. He broke a complicated substitution cipher. When the stuff started making sense he pushed the panic button.\"  \"For something the Nathians wrote five hundred years ago?\"  Stetson's drooping eyelids lifted. There was a cold quality to his stare. \"This was a routing station for key Nathian families,\" he said. \"Trained refugees. An old dodge ... been used as long as there've been--\"  \"But five hundred _years_, Stet!\"  \"I don't care if it was five _thousand_ years!\" barked Stetson. \"We've intercepted some scraps since then that were written in the _same_ code. The bland confidence of _that_! Wouldn't that gall you?\" He shook his head. \"And every scrap we've intercepted deals with the coming elections.\"  \"But the election's only a couple of days off!\" protested Orne.  Stetson glanced at his wristchrono. \"Forty-two hours to be exact,\" he said. \"Some deadline!\"  \"Any names in these old records?\" asked Orne.  Stetson nodded. \"Names of planets, yes. People, no. Some code names, but no cover names. Code name on Chargon was _Winner_. That ring any bells with you?\"  Orne shook his head. \"No. What's the code name here?\"  _\"The Head,\"_ said Stetson. \"But what good does that do us? They're sure to've changed those by now.\"  \"They didn't change their communications code,\" said Orne.  \"No ... they didn't.\"  \"We must have something on them, some leads,\" said Orne. He felt that Stetson was holding back something vital.  \"Sure,\" said Stetson. \"We have history books. They say the Nathians were top drawer in political mechanics. We know for a fact they chose landing sites for their _refugees_ with diabolical care. Each family was told to dig in, grow up with the adopted culture, develop the weak spots, build an underground, train their descendants to take over. They set out to bore from within, to make victory out of defeat. The Nathians were long on patience. They came originally from nomad stock on Nathia II. Their mythology calls them Arbs or Ayrbs. Go review your seventh grade history. You'll know almost as much as we do!\"  \"Like looking for the traditional needle in the haystack,\" muttered Orne. \"How come you suspect High Commissioner Upshook?\"  Stetson wet his lips with his tongue. \"One of the Bullones' seven daughters is currently at home,\" he said. \"Name's Diana. A field leader in the I-A women. One of the Nathian code messages we intercepted had her name as addressee.\"  \"Who sent the message?\" asked Orne. \"What was it all about?\"  Stetson coughed. \"You know, Lew, we cross-check everything. This message was signed M.O.S. The only M.O.S. that came out of the comparison was on a routine next-of-kin reply. We followed it down to the original copy, and the handwriting checked. Name of Madrena Orne Standish.\"  \"Maddie?\" Orne froze, turned slowly to face Stetson. \"So that's what's troubling you!\"  \"We know you haven't been home since you were seventeen,\" said Stetson. \"Your record with us is clean. The question is--\"  \"Permit me,\" said Orne. \"The question is: Will I turn in my own sister if it falls that way?\"  Stetson remained silent, staring at him.  \"O.K.,\" said Orne. \"My job is seeing that we don't have another Rim War. Just answer me one question: How's Maddie mixed up in this? My family isn't one of these traitor clans.\"  \"This whole thing is all tangled up with politics,\" said Stetson. \"We think it's because of her husband.\"  \"Ahhhh, the member for Chargon,\" said Orne. \"I've never met him.\" He looked to the southwest where a flitter was growing larger as it approached. \"Who's my cover contact?\"  \"That mini-transceiver we planted in your neck for the Gienah job,\" said Stetson. \"It's still there and functioning. Anything happens around you, we hear it.\"  [Illustration]  Orne touched the subvocal stud at his neck, moved his speaking muscles without opening his mouth. A surf-hissing voice filled the matching transceiver in Stetson's neck:  _\"You pay attention while I'm making a play for this Diana Bullone, you hear? Then you'll know how an expert works.\"_  \"Don't get so interested in your work that you forget why you're out there,\" growled Stetson.         *       *       *       *       *  Mrs. Bullone was a fat little mouse of a woman. She stood almost in the center of the guest room of her home, hands clasped across the paunch of a long, dull silver gown. She had demure gray eyes, grandmotherly gray hair combed straight back in a jeweled net--and that shocking baritone husk of a voice issuing from a small mouth. Her figure sloped out from several chins to a matronly bosom, then dropped straight like a barrel. The top of her head came just above Orne's dress epaulets.  \"We want you to feel at home here, Lewis,\" she husked. \"You're to consider yourself one of the family.\"  Orne looked around at the Bullone guest room: low key furnishings with an old-fashioned selectacol for change of decor. A polawindow looked out onto an oval swimming pool, the glass muted to dark blue. It gave the outside a moonlight appearance. There was a contour bed against one wall, several built-ins, and a door partly open to reveal bathroom tiles. Everything traditional and comfortable.  \"I already _do_ feel at home,\" he said. \"You know, your house is very like our place on Chargon. I was surprised when I saw it from the air. Except for the setting, it looks almost identical.\"  \"I guess your mother and I shared ideas when we were in school,\" said Polly. \"We were _very_ close friends.\"  \"You must've been to do all this for me,\" said Orne. \"I don't know how I'm ever going to--\"  \"Ah! Here we are!\" A deep masculine voice boomed from the open door behind Orne. He turned, saw Ipscott Bullone, High Commissioner of the Marakian League. Bullone was tall, had a face of harsh angles and deep lines, dark eyes under heavy brows, black hair trained in receding waves. There was a look of ungainly clumsiness about him.  _He doesn't strike me as the dictator type_, thought Orne. _But that's obviously what Stet suspects._  \"Glad you made it out all right, son,\" boomed Bullone. He advanced into the room, glanced around. \"Hope everything's to your taste here.\"  \"Lewis was just telling me that our place is very like his mother's home on Chargon,\" said Polly.  \"It's old fashioned, but we like it,\" said Bullone. \"Just a great big tetragon on a central pivot. We can turn any room we want to the sun, the shade or the breeze, but we usually leave the main salon pointing northeast. View of the capital, you know.\"  \"We have a sea breeze on Chargon that we treat the same way,\" said Orne.  \"I'm sure Lewis would like to be left alone for a while now,\" said Polly. \"This is his first day out of the hospital. We mustn't tire him.\" She crossed to the polawindow, adjusted it to neutral gray, turned the selectacol, and the room's color dominance shifted to green. \"There, that's more restful,\" she said. \"Now, if there's anything you need you just ring the bell there by your bed. The autobutle will know where to find us.\"  The Bullones left, and Orne crossed to the window, looked out at the pool. The young woman hadn't come back. When the chauffeur-driven limousine flitter had dropped down to the house's landing pad, Orne had seen a parasol and sunhat nodding to each other on the blue tiles beside the pool. The parasol had shielded Polly Bullone. The sunhat had been worn by a shapely young woman in swimming tights, who had rushed off into the house.  She was no taller than Polly, but slender and with golden red hair caught under the sunhat in a swimmer's chignon. She was not beautiful--face too narrow with suggestions of Bullone's cragginess, and the eyes overlarge. But her mouth was full-lipped, chin strong, and"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24721"],["title","Operation Haystack (#2)"],["body","had been an air of exquisite assurance about her. The total effect had been one of striking elegance--extremely feminine.  Orne looked beyond the pool: wooded hills and, dimly on the horizon, a broken line of mountains. The Bullones lived in expensive isolation. Around them stretched miles of wilderness, rugged with planned neglect.  _Time to report in_, he thought. Orne pressed the neck stud on his transceiver, got Stetson, told him what had happened to this point.  \"All right,\" said Stetson. \"Go find the daughter. She fits the description of the gal you saw by the pool.\"  \"That's what I was hoping,\" said Orne.  He changed into light-blue fatigues, went to the door of his room, let himself out into a hall. A glance at his wristchrono showed that it was shortly before noon--time for a bit of scouting before they called lunch. He knew from his brief tour of the house and its similarity to the home of his childhood that the hall let into the main living salon. The public rooms and men's quarters were in the outside ring. Secluded family apartments and women's quarters occupied the inner section.         *       *       *       *       *  Orne made his way to the salon. It was long, built around two sections of the tetragon, and with low divans beneath the view windows. The floor was thick pile rugs pushed one against another in a crazy patchwork of reds and browns. At the far end of the room, someone in blue fatigues like his own was bent over a stand of some sort. The figure straightened at the same time a tinkle of music filled the room. He recognized the red-gold hair of the young woman he had seen beside the pool. She was wielding two mallets to play a stringed instrument that lay on its side supported by a carved-wood stand.  He moved up behind her, his footsteps muffled by the carpeting. The music had a curious rhythm that suggested figures dancing wildly around firelight. She struck a final chord, muted the strings.  \"That makes me homesick,\" said Orne.  \"Oh!\" She whirled, gasped, then smiled. \"You startled me. I thought I was alone.\"  \"Sorry. I was enjoying the music.\"  \"I'm Diana Bullone,\" she said. \"You're Mr. Orne.\"  \"Lew to all of the Bullone family, I hope,\" he said.  \"Of course ... Lew.\" She gestured at the musical instrument. \"This is very old. Most find its music ... well, rather weird. It's been handed down for generations in mother's family.\"  \"The kaithra,\" said Orne. \"My sisters play it. Been a long time since I've heard one.\"  \"Oh, of course,\" she said. \"Your mother's--\" She stopped, looked confused. \"I've got to get used to the fact that you're.... I mean that we have a strange man around the house who isn't _exactly_ strange.\"  Orne grinned. In spite of the blue I-A fatigues and a rather severe pulled-back hairdo, this was a handsome woman. He found himself liking her, and this caused him a feeling near self-loathing. She was a suspect. He couldn't afford to like her. But the Bullones were being so decent, taking him in like this. And how was their hospitality being repaid? By spying and prying. Yet, his first loyalty belonged to the I-A, to the peace it represented.  He said rather lamely: \"I hope you get over the feeling that I'm strange.\"  \"I'm over it already,\" she said. She linked arms with him, said: \"If you feel up to it, I'll take you on the deluxe guided tour.\"  By nightfall, Orne was in a state of confusion. He had found Diana fascinating, and yet the most comfortable woman to be around that he had ever met. She liked swimming, _paloika_ hunting, _ditar_ apples-- She had a \"poo-poo\" attitude toward the older generation that she said she'd never before revealed to anyone. They had laughed like fools over utter nonsense.  Orne went back to his room to change for dinner, stopped before the polawindow. The quick darkness of these low latitudes had pulled an ebon blanket over the landscape. There was city-glow off to the left, and an orange halo to the peaks where Marak's three moons would rise. _Am I falling in love with this woman?_ he asked himself. He felt like calling Stetson, not to report but just to talk the situation out. And this made him acutely aware that Stetson or an aide had heard everything said between them that afternoon.         *       *       *       *       *  The autobutle called dinner. Orne changed hurriedly into a fresh lounge uniform, found his way to the small salon across the house. The Bullones already were seated around an old-fashioned bubble-slot table set with real candles, golden _shardi_ service. Two of Marak's moons could be seen out the window climbing swiftly over the peaks.  \"You turned the house,\" said Orne.  \"We like the moonrise,\" said Polly. \"It seems more romantic, don't you think?\" She glanced at Diana.  Diana looked down at her plate. She was wearing a low-cut gown of _firemesh_ that set off her red hair. A single strand of _Reinach_ pearls gleamed at her throat.  Orne sat down in the vacant seat opposite her. _What a handsome woman!_ he thought.  Polly, on Orne's right, looked younger and softer in a green stola gown that hazed her barrel contours. Bullone, across from her, wore black lounging shorts and knee-length _kubi_ jacket of golden pearl cloth. Everything about the people and setting reeked of wealth, power. For a moment, Orne saw that Stetson's suspicions could have basis in fact. Bullone might go to any lengths to maintain this luxury.  Orne's entrance had interrupted an argument between Polly and her husband. They welcomed him, went right on without inhibition. Rather than embarrassing him, this made him feel more at home, more accepted.  [Illustration]  \"But I'm not running for office this time,\" said Bullone patiently. \"Why do we have to clutter up the evening with that many people just to--\"  \"Our election night parties are traditional,\" said Polly.  \"Well, I'd just like to relax quietly at home tomorrow,\" he said. \"Take it easy with just the family here and not have to--\"  \"It's not like it was a _big_ party,\" said Polly. \"I've kept the list to fifty.\"  Diana straightened, said: \"This is an important election Daddy! How could you _possibly_ relax? There're seventy-three seats in question ... the whole balance. If things go wrong in just the Alkes sector ... why ... you could be sent back to the floor. You'd lose your job as ... why ... someone else could take over as--\"  \"Welcome to the job,\" said Bullone. \"It's a headache.\" He grinned at Orne. \"Sorry to burden you with this, m'boy, but the women of this family run me ragged. I guess from what I hear that you've had a pretty busy day, too.\" He smiled paternally at Diana. \"And your first day out of the hospital.\"  \"She sets quite a pace, but I've enjoyed it,\" said Orne.  \"We're taking the small flitter for a tour of the wilderness area tomorrow,\" said Diana. \"Lew can relax all the way. I'll do the driving.\"  \"Be sure you're back in plenty of time for the party,\" said Polly. \"Can't have--\" She broke off at a low bell from the alcove behind her. \"That'll be for me. Excuse me, please ... no, don't get up.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Orne bent to his dinner as it came out of the bubble slot beside his plate: meat in an exotic sauce, _Sirik_ champagne, _paloika au semil_ ... more luxury.  Presently, Polly returned, resumed her seat.  \"Anything important?\" asked Bullone.  \"Only a cancellation for tomorrow night. Professor Wingard is ill.\"  \"I'd just as soon it was cancelled down to the four of us,\" said Bullone.  _Unless this is a pose, this doesn't sound like a man who wants to grab more power_, thought Orne.  \"Scottie, you should take more pride in your office!\" snapped Polly. \"You're an important man.\"  \"If it weren't for you, I'd be a nobody and prefer it,\" said Bullone. He grinned at Orne. \"I'm a political idiot compared to my wife. Never saw anyone who could call the turn like she does. Runs in her family. Her mother was the same way.\"  Orne stared at him, fork raised from plate and motionless. A sudden idea had exploded in his mind.  \"You must know something of this life, Lewis,\" said Bullone. \"Your father was member for Chargon once, wasn't he?\"  \"Yes,\" murmured Orne. \"But that was before I was born. He died in office.\" He shook his head, thought: _It couldn't be ... but--_  \"Do you feel all right, Lew?\" asked Diana. \"You're suddenly so pale.\"  \"Just tired,\" said Orne. \"Guess I'm not used to so much activity.\"  \"And I've been a beast keeping you so busy today,\" she said.  \"Don't you stand on ceremony here, son,\" said Polly. She looked concerned. \"You've been very sick, and we understand. If you're tired, you go right on into bed.\"  Orne glanced around the table, met anxious attention in each face. He pushed his chair back, said: \"Well, if you really don't mind--\"  \"Mind!\" barked Polly. \"You scoot along now!\"  \"See you in the morning. Lew,\" said Diana.  He nodded, turned away, thinking: _What a handsome woman!_ As he started down the hall, he heard Bullone say to Diana: \"Di, perhaps you'd better not take that boy out tomorrow. After all, he _is_ supposed to be here for a rest.\" Her answer was lost as Orne entered the hall, closed the door.  In the privacy of his room, Orne pressed the transceiver stud at his neck, said: _\"Stet?\"_  A voice hissed in his ears: _\"This is Mr. Stetson's relief. Orne, isn't it?\"_  _\"Yes. I want a check right away on those Nathian records the archaeologists found. Find out if Heleb was one of the planets they seeded.\"_  _\"Right. Hang on.\"_ There was a long silence, then: _\"Lew, this is Stet. How come the question about Heleb?\"_  _\"Was it on that Nathian list?\"_  _\"Negative. Why'd you ask?\"_  _\"Are you sure, Stet? It'd explain a lot of things.\"_  _\"It's not on the lists, but ... wait a minute.\"_ Silence. Then: _\"Heleb was on line of flight to Auriga, and Auriga was on the list. We've reason to doubt they put anyone down on Auriga. If their ship ran into trouble--\"_  _\"That's it!\"_ snapped Orne.  _\"Keep your voice down or talk"]]]
