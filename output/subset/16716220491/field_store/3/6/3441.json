AND Pompeian House--sign.]     ESSAY I.  REMARKS UPON THE SYMBOLS OF THE REPRODUCTIVE POWERS.   From the investigations and researches of the learned, there appears to be no doubt but that the most ancient of all superstitions was that in which Nature was contemplated chiefly under the attribute or property of fecundity; the symbols of the reproductive power being those under which its prolific potencies were exhibited. It is not because modern fastidiousness affects to consider those symbols as indecent, and even obscene, that we should therefore suppose them to have been so regarded by the ancients: on the contrary, the view of them awakened no impure ideas in the minds of the latter, being regarded by them as the most sacred objects of worship. The ancients, indeed, did not look upon the pleasures of love with the same eye as the moderns do; the tender union of the sexes excited their veneration, because religion appeared to consecrate it, inasmuch as their mythology presented to them all Olympus as more occupied with amatory delights than with the government of the universe.  The reflecting men of those times, more simple, but, it must be confessed, more profound, than those of our own day, could not see any moral turpitude in actions regarded by them as the design of nature, and as the acme of felicity. For this reason it is that we find not only ancient writers expressing themselves freely upon subjects regarded by us as indecent, but even sculptors and painters equally unrestrained in this particular.  The statesman took advantage of these religious impressions: whatever tended to increase population being held in honour. Those images and Priapi so frequently found in the temples of the ancients, and even in their houses, and which we consider as objects of indecent lewdness, were, in their eyes, but so many sacred motives exciting them to propagate their species.  In order to represent by a physical object the reproductive power of the sun in spring-time, as well as the action of that power on all sentient beings, the ancients adopted that symbol of the male gender which the Greeks, who derive it from the Egyptians, called--Phallus.[1] This worship was so general as to have spread itself over a large portion of the habitable globe, for it flourished for many ages in Egypt and Syria, Persia, Asia Minor, Greece and Italy: it was, and still is, in vigour in India and many parts of Africa, and was even found in America on its discovery by the Spaniards. Thus Garcilaso de la Vega informs us[2] that, in the public squares of Panuco (a Mexican town), _bas-reliefs_ were found which, like those of India, represented, in various ways the sexual union; while at Tlascala, another town of that country, the reproductive act was worshipped under the joint symbol of the generative organs, male and female.  A more surprising fact is, that this worship has, as will be shewn hereafter, been perpetuated to a very late date, among the Christians of Europe.  In its origin, the Phallus or emblem of the generative and procreative powers of nature appears to have been of a very simple and inoffensive character--although it was afterwards made subservient to the grossest and most superstitious purposes.  In India this worship is everywhere to be found accompanying the triune God, called by the Hindoos, _Trimourti_ or _Trinity_, and the significant form of the single obelisk or pillar called the _Linga_ or _Lingham_;[3] and it should be observed, in justice to the Hindoos that it is some comparative and negative praise to them, that this emblem, under which they express the éléments and operations of nature is not externally indecorous. Unlike the abominable realities of Egypt, Greece, and Rome, we see this Indian phallic emblem in the Hindoo religious exhibitions, without offence, nor know, until information be extorted, that we are contemplating a symbol whose prototype is obscene.[4]  [Illustration: PLATE II., Fig 1. Lingham, Fig 2. Pan's head.]  Besides the Lingham, the equally significant _Yoni_ or _Cteis_ is to be seen, being the female organ of generation. It is sometimes single, often in conjunction, for the Indians, believing that the emblem of fecundity might be rendered more energetic by combining the organs of both sexes, did so unite them, giving to this double symbol the name of _Pulleiar_, confounded by some writers with the Lingham itself. This pulleiar is highly venerated by the sectarian worshippers of Siva (the third god of the Trimourti), who hang it round their neck, as a charm or amulet, or enclosing it in a small box, fasten it upon their arm. The Indians have also a little jewel called _taly_, worn, in like manner, by females round their necks as a charm. It is presented to them on their wedding day by their husbands, who receive it from the hands of the Brahmins. Upon these jewels is engraved the representation, either of the Lingham or of the Pulleiar. The following anecdote connected with this custom is given by M. Sonnerat.[5]    \"A Capuchin missionary had a serious dispute with the   Jesuits residing at Pondicherry, which was referred for   decision to the judicial courts. The disciples of Loyola,   who can be toleration itself when toleration furthers their   crafty and ambitious views, had declined all interference   with the above custom. M. Tournon, the Pope's legate   apostolic, who regarded the matter as one not to be trifled   with, and with whom, moreover, the Jesuits were no   favourites, strictly prohibited the _taly_, enjoining all   female converts to substitute in its place either a cross or   a medal of the Virgin. The Indian women, strongly attached   to their ancient customs, refused obedience. The   missionaries, apprehensive of losing the fruits of their   zealous labours, and seeing the number of their neophytes   daily diminishing, entered into a compromise by adopting a   _mezzo-termine_ with the females in question, and it was   agreed that a Cross should be engraved upon the _taly_, an   arrangement by which the symbol of Christian salvation was   coupled with that of the male and female _pudenda_.\"  The deep and enthusiastic veneration felt by the Hindoos for this worship is naturally explained by their"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27752"],["title","Aphrodisiacs and Anti-aphrodisiacs: Three Essays on the Powers of Reproduction (#2)"],["body"," anxiety and desire for having children who might perform those ceremonies to their _manes_ which they firmly and piously believe will have the effect of mitigating their punishment in the world to come. They worship the _Lingham_, therefore, for the sake of having progeny, and husbands, whose wives are barren, send them to adore that symbol, and, if report be true, the ladies take especial care not to disappoint the wish of their dear spouses.  It is probable that the introduction of this worship is due to the Indians who founded the sect of Siva, imagining, as they no doubt did, that the most effectual means of propagating it would be by presenting their deity under the form of that organ by which the reproduction of the human race is effected.  Nothing can be a greater proof of the high antiquity of the Indians than this worship, it being certain that the Egyptians did not establish it, as well as the dogma of the Metempsychosis, among themselves, until after they had travelled in India.  Phalli, usually in lead, have been even found in the river Rhône. These were most likely the signs and tokens belonging to some secret society probably of a licentious character. Similar ones are in the _Forgeais_ collection, and were engraved in the _Plombs Historiés_ of that antiquarian.[6]  [Illustration: PLATE III., Figs. 1-4, PHALLUS EMBLEM, found in the Rhône, From the Forgeais Collection.]  According to an ingenious writer,[7] who is of opinion that the Indians sent, at a very remote period, colonists to Ireland, the round towers, so numerous in that island, are no other than ancient Phallic temples erected in honour of the fructifying power of nature emanating, as it was supposed to do, from the sun, under the name of Sol, Phœbus, Apollo, Abad, or Budh.[8]  Alluding to these towers, Mr O'Brien observes, \"the eastern votaries, suiting the action to the idea, and that their vivid imaginations might be still more enlivened by the very _form_ of the _temple_, actually constructed its architecture after the model of the _membrum virile_, which, obscenity apart, is the divinity-formed and indispensable medium selected by God himself for human propagation and sexual prolificacy.\" There is every reason to believe that our _May-pole_ is a relic of the ancient Phallic worship.  [Illustration: PLATE IV., Fig. 1. ROUND TOWER AT KLONDALKIN, IRELAND., Fig. 2. THREE HEADED OSIRIS.]  The manners of the ancient Hebrews seem to have differed little, if at all, in this respect, from those of the nations surrounding them: thus, David, dancing with all his might before the ark, lifted up his ephod and exhibited his nakedness to \"the eyes of the handmaids of his servants.\" No blame is attached to the king for such gross indecency during a public and religious ceremony; while Michal, his wife, was punished with barrenness, for expressing her disapprobation of his conduct.[9]  This example attests the great respect entertained by the Hebrews for the organs of generation;[10] but we have a further proof of this reverence for them in the fact that, when taking a solemn oath, they placed their hand upon them in token of its inviolability: When Abraham, addressing \"his oldest servant of his house, that ruled over all that he had,\" is made to say, \"Put I pray thee, thy hand under my thigh, and I will make thee swear, by the Lord, the God of Heaven, and the God of the earth that thou shalt not take a wife unto my son, of the daughters of the Canaanites:\"[11] and when Jacob, at the point of death, called his son Joseph, and said unto him, \"If now I have found grace in thy sight, put, I pray thee, thy hand under my thigh, and deal kindly and truly with me; bury me not, I pray thee, in Egypt,\"[12] the Hebrew text has been incorrectly translated in both these instances; for, according to learned commentators, it is not the _thigh_, but the _phallus_ that is meant; such tact having, in the opinion of the Rabbins, been introduced for the purpose of doing honour to circumcision.  This custom obtains in Egypt, even in our own day, for many travellers assert that the Arabs, when desirous of saluting or making a promise with great solemnity, place their hand upon the part in question. A case in point is related in a letter of the Adjutant-General Julian to a member of the Institute of Egypt.[13] An Egyptian, who had been arrested as a spy, and brought before the general, finding that all his asservations of innocence could not be understood \"leva sa chemise bleue, et prenant son phallus à la poignée, resta un moment dans l'attitude théatrale d'un dieu jurant par le Styx. Sa physionomie semblait me dire: _Après la serment terrible que je fais pour vous prouver mon innocence, osez-vous en douter?_ Son geste me rappela que du tems d'Abraham on jurait vérité en portant la main aux organes de la génération.\" The vast antiquity of this custom among the ancient Egyptians is proved by figure 2, Plate IV. This figure, which is copied from Caylus, Vol. VI., Plate I., figure 4, represents Osiris grasping his phallus while taking an oath.  A custom greatly resembling this manner of swearing existed also in the north of Europe, as is proved by an ancient law still extant: thus, one of the articles of the Welsh laws enacted by _Hoel the Good_, provides that, in cases of rape, if the woman wishes to prosecute the offender, she must, when swearing to the identity of the criminal, lay her right hand upon the relics of the saints and grasp with her left one, the peccant member of the party accused.[14]  It may be mentioned, _en passant_, that the low Irish in Dublin, and the London costermongers, often make use of an expression which, whether connected or not with the custom above noted, offers for our consideration a curious coincidence at least. If extra force is to accompany an assertion, it is very common for the vulgar to say in conclusion: \"_S'elp my taters!_\" or \"_So help me_ TESTES\"--equal to saying, \"_I swear by my member_.\" That the word \"taters\" is a corruption of, and vulgarism for, \"_testes_\" we see very readily in the expression \"_strain my taters_\"--_i.e._, to pass urine or make water.  The Greeks had consecrated the same symbols of universal fecundity in their mysteries, the phallus and the cteis being publicly exhibited in the sanctuary of Eleusis. The _membrum virile_ or _active_ principle of generation was carried to the temple of Bacchus and there crowned with a garland by one of the most respectable matrons of the town or city. The Egyptian Osiris, and the female _pudenda_, or symbol of the _passive_ principle of generation were, in like manner, carried in procession to the temple of Libera or Proserpine.  The worship of Priapus among the Romans was derived from the Egyptians, who, under the form of Apis, the sacred Bull, worshipped the generative power of nature; and, as the syllable _pri_ or _pre_ signifies, in the Oriental tongue, _principle_, production, or natural or original source, the word _Priapus_ may be translated _principle of production_ or of _fecundation of Apis_. The same symbol also bore among the Romans the names of _Tutunus_, _Mutinus_, and _Fascinum_. Among the many places where this divinity was worshipped, Lampsacus,[15] in Asia Minor, was the most noted on account of the obscene rites there practised. The Priapi were of different forms; some having only a human head and the Phallus; some with the head of Pan or of a faun--that is, with the head and ears of a goat.[16] Others, with their indecent attribute, were placed in the public roads, and were then confounded with the divinities _Mercury_ and _Terminus_, who presided over boundaries. Scaliger says that he saw at Rome, in the palace of a cardinal,[17] a similar statue, whose phallus had served as a sign post.[18] All the human part of these Priapi were invariably painted red.[19]  When furnished with arms, which he was when representing Terminus, Priapus held in one hand a reaping hook, and, like Osiris, grasped with the other the characteristic feature of his divinity, which was always of a monstrous size and in a state of energy.  In the towns, Priapus had public chapels, whither such devotees as were suffering from maladies connected with his attributes repaired for the purpose of offering to him _ex-votos_ representing the parts afflicted; these ex-votos being sometimes paintings and, at others, little figures made of wax or of wood, and occasionally, even of marble.  Females as superstitious, as they were lascivious, might be seen offering in public to Priapus, as many garlands as they had had lovers. These they would hang upon the enormous phallus of the idol, which was often hidden from sight by the number suspended by only one woman.  Others offered to the god as many phalli, made of the wood of the willow tree, as they had vanquished men in a single night.  St. Augustine informs us that it was considered by the Roman ladies as a very proper and pious custom to require young brides to seat themselves upon the monstrous and obscene member of Priapus: and Lactantius says, \"Shall I speak of that _Mutinus_, upon the extremity of which brides are accustomed to seat themselves in order that the god may appear to have been the first to receive the sacrifice of their modesty?\"[20]  These facts prove that the worship of Priapus had greatly degenerated with the Romans, since, losing sight altogether of the object typified, they attach themselves to the symbol alone, in which they could see only what was indecent; and hence religion became a pretext for libertinism.[21]  Respected so long as the Roman manners preserved their pristine simplicity, but degraded[22] and vilified in proportion as the morals of that people became corrupted, the very sanctuary itself of Priapus failed to protect him from obloquy and ridicule. Christian writers added their indignant invectives to the biting sarcasms of the poets, and the worship of Priapus would have been annihilated had not"]]]
