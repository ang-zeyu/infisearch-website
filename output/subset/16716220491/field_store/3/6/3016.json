When thou hast eaten and art full, then thou shalt bless the Lord they God for the good land which He hath given thee._\" Aaron closed the big book reverently. \"Awmen,\" he said.  \"Awmen,\" the woman echoed. \"Aaron, with you beside me, I am not fretful.\"  \"And with the Lord above us, I fear not in a strange land,\" Aaron said. He bent to scrape a handful of earth from beneath Martha's pine-twig carpet. \"_Guuter Gruundt_,\" he said. \"This will grow tall corn. Tobacco, too; the folk here relish our leaf. There will be deep grasses for the beasts when the snow melts. We will prosper here, wife.\"  The next morning was cold, but the snowfall had ceased for a spell. The Stoltzfooses had risen well before the dawn; Martha to feed herself, her husband, and the chickens; Aaron to ready the horse and wagon for a trip into Datura. He counted out the hoard of golden cowries he'd been loaned as grubstake, did some arithmetic, and allowed his wife to pour him a second cup of coffee for the road. \"You may expect the Sarki's wives to visit while I'm gone,\" he remarked.  \"I'd be scared half to death!\" Martha Stoltzfoos said. Her hands went to the back of her head, behind the lace prayer covering. \"My hair's all strooby, this place is untidy as an auction yard; besides, how can I talk with those dark and heathen women? Them all decked out in golden bangles and silken clothes, most likely, like the bad lady of Babylon? Aaron Stoltz, I would admire a pretty to ride into town with you.\"  \"Haggling for hired-help is man's _Bissiniss_.\" he said. \"When Kazunzumi's women come, feed them pie and peaches from the can. You'll find a way to talk, or women are not sisters. I'll be back home in time for evening chores.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Bumping along the trail into Datura, Aaron Stoltzfoos studied the land. A world that could allow so much well-drained black soil to go unfarmed was fortunate indeed, he mused. He thought of his father's farm, which would be his elder brother's, squeezed between railroad tracks and a three-lane highway, pressed from the west by an Armstrong Cork plant, the very cornstalks humming in harmony with the electric lines strung across the fields. This land was what the old folks had sought in America so long ago: a wilderness ripe for the plow.  The wagon rumbled along the hoof-pocked frozen clay. Aaron analyzed the contours of the hills for watershed and signs of erosion. He studied the patterns of the barren winter fields, fall-plowed and showing here and there the stubble of a crop he didn't recognize. When the clouds scudded for a moment off the sun, he grinned up, and looked back blinded to the road. Good tilth and friendship were promised here, gifts to balance loneliness. Five years from spring, other Amish folk would come to homestead--what a barn-raising they'd have! For now, though, he and Martha, come from a society so close-knit that each had always known the yield-per-acre of their remotest cousin-german, were in a land as strange as the New York City Aaron, stopping in for a phone-call to the vet had once glimpsed on the screen of a gay-German neighbor's stereo-set.  Datura looked to Aaron like a city from the Bible, giving it a certain vicarious familiarity. The great wall was a block of sunbaked mud, fifty feet tall at the battlements, forty feet thick at its base; with bright, meaningless flags spotted on either side of the entrance tower. The cowhide-shielded gate was open. Birds popped out of mud nests glued to the mud wall and chattered at Aaron. Small boys wearing too little to be warm appeared at the opening like flies at a hog-slaughtering to add to the din, buzzing and hopping about and waving their arms as they called companions to view the black-bearded stranger.  Aaron whoaed his horse and took a handful of _anenes_, copper tenth-penny bits, to rattle between his hands. \"_Zonang!_\" he shouted: \"Come here! Is there a boy amongst you brave enough to ride with an off-worlder to the Sarki's house, pointing him the way?\"  One of the boys laughed at Aaron's slow, careful Hausa. \"Let Black-Hat's whiskers point him the way!\" the boy yelled.  \"_Uwaka! Ubaka!_\" Damning both parents of the rude one, another youngster trotted up to Aaron's wagon and raised a skinny brown fist in greeting. \"Sir Off-Worlder, I who am named Waziri, Musa-the-Carpenter's son, would be honored to direct you to the house of Sarki Kazunzumi.\"  \"The honor, young man, is mine,\" Stoltzfoos assured the lad, raising his own fist gravely. \"My name is Haruna, son of Levi,\" he said, reaching down to hoist the boy up beside him on the wagon's seat. \"Your friends have ill manners.\" He giddapped the horse.  \"Buzzard-heads!\" Waziri shouted back at his whilom companions.  \"Peace, Waziri!\" Aaron protested. \"You'll frighten my poor horse into conniptions. Do you work for your father, the carpenter?\"  \"_To_, honorable Haruna,\" the boy said. \"Yes.\" The empty wagon thumped over the wheel-cut streets like a wooden drum. \"By the Mother, sir, I have great knowledge of planing and joining; of all the various sorts of wood, and the curing of them; all the tools my father uses are as familiar to me as my own left hand.\"  \"Carpentry is a skillful trade,\" Aaron said. \"Myself, I am but a farmer.\"  \"By Mother's light! So am I!\" Waziri said, dazzled by this coincidence. \"I can cultivate a field free of all its noxious weeds and touch never a food-plant. I can steer a plow straight as a snapped chalk-string, grade seed with a sure eye; I can spread manure--\"  \"I'm sure you can, Waziri,\" Aaron said. \"I need a man of just those rare qualifications to work for me. Know you such a paragon?\"  \"Mother's name! Myself, your Honor!\"  Aaron Stoltzfoos shook the hand of his hired man, an alien convention that much impressed Waziri. The boy was to draw three hundred anenes a day, some thirty-five cents, well above the local minimum-wage conventions; and he would get his bed and meals. Aaron's confidence that the boastful lad would make a farmer was bolstered by Waziri's loud calculations: \"Three hundred coppers a day make, in ten day's work, a bronze cowrie; ten big bronzes make a silver cowrie, the price of an acre of land. Haruna, will you teach me your off-world farming? Will you allow me to buy land that neighbors yours?\"  \"_Sei schtill, Buu_,\" Aaron said, laughing. \"Before you reap your first crop, you must find me the Sarki.\"  \"We are here, Master Haruna.\"         *       *       *       *       *  The Sarki's house was no larger than its neighbors, Moorish-styled and domed-roofed like the others; but it wore on its streetside walls designs cut into the stucco, scrolls and arabesques. Just above the doorway, which opened spang onto the broadway of Datura, a grinning face peered down upon the visitors, its eyes ruby-colored glass.  Waziri pounded the door for Aaron, and stepped aside to let his new employer do the speaking. They were admitted to the house by a thin, old man wearing a pink turban. As they followed this butler down a hallway, Aaron and Waziri heard the shrieks and giggles of feminine consternation that told of women being herded into the zenana. The Amishman glimpsed one of the ladies, perhaps Sarki Kazunzumi's most junior wife, dashing toward the female sanctuary. Her eyes were lozenges of antimony; her hands, dipped in henna, seemed clad in pale kid gloves. Aaron, recalling pointers on Murnan etiquette he'd received at Georgetown, elaborately did not see the lady. He removed his hat as the turbaned butler bowed him to a plush-covered sofa. Waziri was cuffed to a mat beside the door.  \"_Rankeshi dade!_\" the Sarki said. \"May the Mother bring you the light of understanding.\"  \"Light and long life, O Sarki,\" Stoltzfoos said, standing up.  \"Will the guest who honors my roof-cup taste coffee with his fortunate host?\" the Sarki asked.  \"The lucky guest will be ever the Sarki's servant if your Honor allows him to share his pleasure with his fellow-farmer and employee, Waziri the son of Musa,\" Aaron said.  \"You'd better have hired mice to guard your stored grain, O Haruna; and blowflies to curry your cattle, than to have engaged the son of Musa as a farmer,\" Kazunzumi growled. \"Waziri has little light of understanding. He will try to win from the soil what only honest sweat and Mother's grace can cause to grow. This boy will gray your beard, Haruna.\"  \"Perhaps the sun that warms the soil will light his brains to understanding,\" Aaron suggested.  \"Better that your hand should leave the plowhandle from time to time to warm his lazy fundament,\" the Sarki said.  \"Just so, O Sarki,\" the Amishman said. \"If Waziri does not serve me well, I have an enormous boar who will, if kept long enough from wholesomer food, rid me of a lazy farm-hand.\" Waziri grinned at all the attention he was getting from the two most important men in town, and sat expectantly as the turbaned elder brought in coffee.  Stoltzfoos watched the Sarki, and aped his actions. Water was served with the coffee; this was to rinse the mouth that the beverage could be tasted with fresh taste buds. The coffee was brown as floodwater silt, heavy with sugar, and very hot; and the cups had no handles. \"You are the first European I have seen for many years, friend Haruna,\" the Sarki said. \"It is five years gone that the white off-worlders came, and with a black man as their voice purchased with silver the land you now farm.\"  \"They bought well,\" Aaron said; \"the seller sold justly. When the fist of winter loosens, the soil will prove as rich as butter.\"  \"When the first green breaks through, and you may break the soil without offense, you will do well,\" Kazunzumi said. \"You are a man who loves the land.\"  \"My fathers have flourished with the soil for twenty generations,\" the Amishman said. \"I pray another twenty may live to inherit my good fortune.\"  \"Haruna,\" the Sarki said, \"I see"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24569"],["title","A Treasury of Eskimo Tales (#1)"],["body","up on the crest of billows and the next it was plunged into a deep trough of the sea.  Again he saw a dark mass looming up, and rowed toward it hoping to find land, but again he was deceived, for it was another whirlpool which made the sea rise in gigantic waves. At last the wind subsided, and the sea became less rough, though the whitecaps still frothed around him. The fog lifted, and at a great distance he saw land, real land this time.  He went toward it, and after rowing along the coast for some distance he spied a stone house with a light in it. You may be sure he was delighted to come near a human habitation again. He landed and entered the house. There was no one in it but one old woman. She received him kindly and helped him to pull off his boots, and she hung his wet stockings on the frame above the lamp. Then she said:  \"I will make a fire in the next room and cook a good supper.\"  Kiviung thought she was a very good woman, and he was so hungry that he could scarcely wait for the supper. It seemed to him that she was a long time preparing it. When his stockings were dry he tried to take them from the frame in order to put them on. But as soon as he touched the frame it rose up out of his reach. He tried in vain several times, and each time the frame rose up. He called the woman in and asked her to give him his stockings.  \"Take them yourself,\" she said. \"There they are; there they are,\" and went out again.  Kiviung was surprised at the change in her manner. He tried once more to take hold of his stockings, but with no better result. Calling the woman in again, he explained his difficulty and said:  \"Please hand me my boots and stockings; they slip away from me.\"  \"Sit down where I sat when you entered my house; then you can get them,\" she replied, and left the room.  He tried once more, but the frame arose as before and he could not reach it. He knew now that she was a wicked woman, and he suspected that the big fire she had made was prepared so she could roast and eat him.  What should he do? He had seen that she could work magic. He knew that he could not escape unless he could surpass her in her own arts. He summoned his mascot, which was a huge white bear. At once there was a low growl from under the house. The woman did not hear it at first, but Kiviung kept on conjuring the spirit and it rose right up through the floor roaring loudly. Then the old witch rushed in trembling with fear and gave Kiviung what he had asked for.  \"Here are your boots,\" she cried; \"here are your slippers; here are your stockings. I will help you put them on.\"  But Kiviung would not stay any longer with the horrid creature, and dared not wait to put on his stockings and boots. He rushed out of the house and had barely gotten out of the door when it clapped violently together, catching the tail of his jacket, which was torn off. Without stopping to look behind, he ran to his kayak and paddled away.  The old woman quickly recovered from her fear and came out swinging a glittering knife which she attempted to throw at him. He was so frightened that he nearly upset his kayak, but he steadied it and arose to his feet, lifting his spear.  \"I shall kill you with my spear,\" he cried.  At that the old woman fell down in terror and broke her knife which she had made by magic out of a thin slab of ice.  He traveled on for many days, always keeping near the shore. At last he came to another hut, and again a lamp was burning inside. His clothing was wet and he was hungry, so he landed and went into the house. There he found something very strange: a woman living all alone with her daughter! Yet the daughter was married and they kept the son-in-law in the house. But he was a log of driftwood which they had found on the beach. It had four branches like legs and arms. Every day about the time of low water they carried it to the beach and when the tide came in, it swam away. When night came it returned with eight large seals, two being fastened to each bough.  Thus the log provided food for its wife, her mother, and Kiviung, and they lived in abundance. Kiviung became rested and refreshed after his weary travels, and he enjoyed this life so well that he remained for a long time. One day, however, after they had launched the log as they had always done, it floated away and never came back.  Then Kiviung went sealing every day for himself and the women, and he was so successful that they wished him to remain with them always. But he had not forgotten the home he had left long ago, and meant to return to it. He was anxious to lay in a good stock of mittens to keep his hands warm on the long journey, and each night he pretended to have lost the pair he wore, and the women would make him another pair from the skin of the seals he brought home. He hid them all in the hood of his jacket.  Then one day, he, too, floated off with the tide and never came back. He rowed on for many days and nights, always following the shore. During the terrible storm he had been out of sight of land all he ever cared to be.  At last he came again to a hut where a lamp was burning, and went to it. But this time he thought it would be well to see who was inside before entering. He therefore climbed up to the window and looked through the peep-hole. On the bed sat a woman whose head and whose hands looked like big yellow-and-black spiders. She was sewing; and when she saw the dark shadow before the window she at first thought it was a cloud, but when she looked up and beheld a man, she grasped a big knife and arose, looking very angry. Kiviung waited to see no more. He felt a sudden longing for home, and hastily went on his way.  Again he traveled for days and nights. At last he came to a land which seemed familiar, and as he went farther he recognized his own country. He was very glad to see some boats ahead of him, and when he stood up and waved and shouted to them they came to meet him. They had been on a whaling excursion and were towing a large dead whale to their village.  In the bow of one of the boats stood a stout young man who had harpooned the whale. He looked at Kiviung keenly and Kiviung looked at him. Then, of a sudden, they recognized each other. It was Kiviung's own son whom he had left a small boy, but who was now become a grown man and a great hunter.  Kiviung's wife was delighted to see him whom she had supposed dead. At first she seemed glad and then she seemed troubled. She had taken a new husband, but after thinking it over she returned to Kiviung, and they were very happy.     III  THE GIANT   In days of old an enormous man lived with other members of the Inuit tribe in a village beside a large inlet. He was so tall that he could straddle the inlet, and he used to stand that way every morning and wait for the whales to pass beneath him. As soon as one came along he used to scoop it up just as easily as other men scoop up a minnow. And he ate the whole whale just as other men eat a small fish.  One day all the natives manned their boats to catch a whale that was spouting off the shore; but he sat idly by his hut. When the men had harpooned the whale and were having a hard time to hold it and keep their boats from capsizing, he rose and strolled down to the shore and scooped the whale and the boats from the water and placed them on the beach.  Another time when he was tired of walking about, he lay down on a high hill to take a nap.  \"You would better be careful,\" said the people, \"for a couple of huge bears have been seen near the village.\"  \"Oh, I don't care for them. If they come too near me, throw some stones at me to waken me,\" he said with a yawn.  The bears came, and the people threw the stones and grabbed their spears. The giant sat up.  \"Where are they? I see no bears. Where are they?\" he asked.  \"There! There! Don't you see them?\" cried the Inuit.  \"What! those little things! They are not worth all this bustle. They are nothing but small foxes.\" And he crushed one between his fingers, and put the other into the eyelet of his boot to strangle it.     IV  KALOPALING   Ka-lo-pa-ling is a strange being who lives in the northern seas. His body is like that of a man except that his feet are very large and look like sealskin muffs. His clothing is made of the skins of eider ducks and, as their bellies are white and their backs are black, his clothes are spotted all over. He cannot speak, but cries all the time, \"Be, be! Be, be!\"  His jacket has an enormous hood which is an object of fear to the Inuit, for if a kayak upsets and the boatman is drowned, Ka-lo-pa-ling grabs him and puts him into the hood.  The Inuit say that in olden times there were a great many of these creatures, and they often sat in a row along the ice floes, like a flock of penguins. Their numbers have become less and less, till now there are but a few left.  Anyone standing on shore may see them swimming under water very rapidly, and occasionally they rise to the surface as if to get air. They make a great noise by splashing with their feet and arms as they swim. In summer they like to come out and bask on the rocks, but in winter they sit along the edge of the ice or else stay under water.  They often chase the hunters, so the most courageous of the men try to kill them whenever they can get near enough. When the Kalopaling sits sleeping, the hunter comes up very cautiously and throws a walrus harpoon into him. Then he shuts his eyes tight until the Kalopaling is dead, otherwise the hunter's boat would be capsized and he be drowned. They dare not eat the flesh of the creatures, for it is poisonous; but the dogs eat it.  One time an old woman and her grandson were living alone in a small hut. They had no men to hunt for them and they were very poor. Once in a while, but not often, some of the Inuit took pity on them and brought them seal's meat, and blubber for their lamp.  One day the boy was so hungry that he cried aloud. His grandmother told him to be quiet, but"]]]
