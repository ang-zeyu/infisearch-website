I keep the medal in the same bag with the bullet.\"  \"Then you have actually shaken hands with the Emperor of France?\" cried the amazed lieutenant.  \"Yes; and King Victor Emmanuel called to see me in the hospital, where I was confined for five weeks. At Solferino, both their majesties shook hands with me, and thanked me again for my services. Being a modest man, I shouldn't want to say out loud that I saved the day for the French and Sardinians at Solferino. At any rate, their majesties did the handsome thing by me on that day.\"  \"I thought you were in the hospital five weeks after Magenta.\"  \"So I was; and well do I remember the little delicacies sent me by the King of Italy while I lay there on my back. Ah! that Victor Emmanuel is a noble fellow. At Solferino, he----\"  \"But how could you have been at Solferino, if you were in the hospital five weeks?\"  \"I did not die of my wounds, it is scarcely necessary for me to remark. I got well.\"  \"But the battle of Solferino was fought on the 20th of June, and that of Magenta on the 4th of June. There were only twenty days between the battles.\"  \"You are right, Somers. I have made some mistake in the dates. I never was good at remembering them. When I was in college, the professors used to laugh at me for forgetting the date of the Christian Era. By the way, do you smoke, Somers? Let's go into the smoking-car, and have a cigar.\"  \"I thank you; I never smoke.\"  \"Ah! you are worse than a hot potato. But I am dying for a smoke; and, if you will excuse me, I will go forward. I will see you again before we get to New York.\"  Captain de Banyan, apparently entirely satisfied with himself, rose from his seat, and sauntered gracefully forward to the door of the car, through which he disappeared, leaving Lieutenant Somers busy in a vain endeavor to crowd five weeks in between the 4th and the 20th of June. The captain was certainly a pleasant and voluble person, and Somers had enjoyed the interview; though he could not repress a rising curiosity to see the bullet which had passed twice through the body of the valiant soldier, and the medal of the Legion of Honor conferred upon him by his imperial majesty the Emperor of France.  Some painful doubts in regard to the truth of Captain de Banyan's remarkable experience were beginning to intrude themselves into his mind; and it is quite probable that he would have been hurled into an unhappy state of skepticism, if the train in which he was riding had not been suddenly hurled down an embankment some twenty feet in height, where the cars were piled up in shapeless wrecks, and human beings, full of life and hope a moment before, were suddenly ushered into eternity, or maimed and mangled for life.     CHAPTER II  THE SENATOR'S DAUGHTER   A scene terribly beyond the power of description was presented to the gaze of Lieutenant Somers when he recovered his scattered senses. The car had been literally wrenched to pieces, and the passengers were partially buried beneath the fragments. Our traveler was stunned by the shock, and made giddy by the wild vaulting of the car as it leaped down the embankment to destruction. He was bruised and lacerated; but he was not seriously injured. He did not make the mistake which many persons do under such trying circumstances, of believing that they are killed; or, if their senses belie this impression, that they shall die within a brief period.  Lieutenant Somers was endowed with a remarkable degree of self-possession, and never gave up anything as long as there was any chance of holding on. He saw a great many stars not authenticated in any respectable catalogue of celestial luminaries. His thoughts, and even his vitality, seemed to be suspended for an instant; but the thoughts came back, and the stream of life still flowed on, notwithstanding the rude assault which had been made upon his corporal frame.  Finding that he was not killed, he struggled out from beneath the wreck which had overwhelmed him. His first consideration, after he had assured himself that he was comparatively uninjured, was for those who were his fellow-passengers on this race to ruin and death; and perhaps it is not strange that the fair young lady who had occupied the opposite seat in the car came to his mind. Men and women were disengaging themselves from the shapeless rubbish. Some wept, some groaned, and some were motionless and silent.  He did not see the fair stranger among those who were struggling back to consciousness. A portion of the top of the car lay near him, which he raised up. It rested heavily upon the form of a maiden, which he at once recognized by the dress to be that of the gentle stranger. The sight roused all his energies; and he felt that strength which had fired his muscles when he trod the field of battle. With desperate eagerness, he raised the heavy fragment which was crowding out the young life of the tender form, and bore it away, so that she was released from its cruel pressure.  She, poor girl! felt it not; for her eyes were closed, and her marble cheek was stained with blood. The young officer, tenderly interested in her fate, bent over her, and raised the inanimate form. He bore it in his arms to a green spot, away from the scattered fragments of the train, and laid it gently down upon the bosom of mother earth. By all the means within his power, he endeavored to convince himself that death had not yet invaded the lovely temple of her being. But still she was silent and motionless. There was not a sign by which he could determine the momentous question.  He was unwilling to believe that the beautiful stranger was dead. It seemed too hard and cruel that one so young and fair should be thus rudely hurried out of existence, without a mother or even a father near to receive her last gaze on earth, and listen to the soft sigh with which she breathed forth her last throb of existence. He had a telescopic drinking-cup in his pocket, with which he hastened to a brook that flowed through the valley. Filling it with water, he returned to his charge. He sprinkled her face, and rubbed her temples, and exerted himself to the best of his knowledge and ability to awaken some signs of life.  The task seemed hopeless; and he was about to abandon it in despair, to render assistance to those who needed it more than the fair, silent form before him, when an almost imperceptible sigh gladdened his heart, and caused him to renew his exertions. Procuring another cup of water, he persistently sprinkled the fair face and chafed the temples of his charge. With his handkerchief he washed away the blood-stains, and ascertained that she was only slightly cut just above the ear.  Cheered by the success which had rewarded his efforts, he continued to bathe and chafe till the gentle stranger opened her eyes. In a few moments more she recovered her consciousness, and cast a bewildered glance around her.  \"Where is my father?\" said she; and, as she spoke, the fearful nature of the catastrophe dawned upon her mind, and she partially rose from her recumbent posture.  Lieutenant Somers could not tell where her father was, and his first thought was that he must be beneath the wreck of the shattered cars. For the first time, he looked about him to measure with his eye the extent of the calamity. At that moment he discovered the engine, with the forward part of the train, backing down the railroad. Only the two rear cars had been precipitated over the embankment; the accident having been caused by the breaking of an axle on the last car but one. The shackle connecting this with the next one had given way, and the broken car had darted off the bank, carrying the rear one with it, while the rest of the train dashed on to its destination.  Of course the calamity was immediately discovered; but a considerable time elapsed--as time was measured by those who were suffering and dying beneath the _d√©bris_ of the train--before the engine could be stopped, and backed to the scene of the accident. Lieutenant Somers had seen the lady's father go forward, and had heard him say he was going to the smoking-car; he was therefore satisfied that he was safe.  \"He will be here presently,\" he replied to the anxious question of the fair stranger.  \"Perhaps he was--oh, dear! Perhaps he was----\"  \"Oh, no! he wasn't. The smoking-car was not thrown off the track,\" interposed the young officer, promptly removing from her mind the terrible fear which took possession of her first conscious moments. \"Are you much hurt?\"  \"I don't know; I don't think I am; but one of my arms feels very numb.\"  \"Let me examine it,\" continued our traveler, tenderly raising the injured member.  He was not deeply skilled in surgery; but he knew enough of the mysteries of anatomy to discover that the arm was broken between the elbow and the shoulder.  \"I am afraid your arm is broken,\" said he cautiously, as though he feared the announcement would cause her to faint again.  \"I am glad it is no worse,\" said she with a languid smile, and without exhibiting the least indication of feminine weakness.  \"It might have been worse, certainly. Can I do anything more for you?\" added Lieutenant Somers, glancing at the wreck of the cars, with a feeling that his duty then was a less pleasing one than that of attending to the wants of the beautiful stranger; for there were still men and women lying helpless and unserved in the midst of the ruins.  The train stopped upon the road; and the passengers, though appalled by the sight, rushed down the bank to render willing assistance to the sufferers. Among them was the father of the young lady, who leaped frantically down the steep, and passed from one to another of the forms which the survivors had taken from the wreck.  \"There is your father,\" said Lieutenant Somers as he recognized him among the excited passengers. \"I will go and tell him where you are.\"  \"Do, if you please,\""]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25886"],["title","The Young Lieutenant; or, The Adventures of an Army Officer (#2)"],["body","the lady faintly.  He ran to the distracted parent, and seized him by the arm as he dashed from one place to another in search of the gentle maiden whose life was part of his own.  \"Your daughter is out here, sir,\" said Lieutenant Somers, pointing to the spot where he had borne her.  \"My daughter!\" gasped the agonized father. \"Where--where?\"  \"In this direction, sir.\"  \"Is she--O Heaven, spare me!\" groaned he.  \"She is hurt, but I think not very badly. Her left arm is broken, and her head is slightly cut.\"  \"O God, I thank Thee!\" gasped the father, as he walked with the lieutenant to the place where the young lady was sitting on the grass.  \"I think you need not be alarmed about her,\" added our officer, anxious to console the suffering parent.  \"My poor Emmie!\" exclaimed the anxious father when they reached the spot, while he knelt down upon the grass by her side, the tears coursing in torrents down his pale cheeks.  \"Don't be alarmed, father,\" replied she, putting her uninjured arm around his neck and kissing him, while their tears mingled. \"I am not much hurt, father.\"  Lieutenant Somers had a heart as well as a strong and willing arm, and he could not restrain his own tears as he witnessed the touching scene. The meeting seemed to be so sacred to him, that he could not stand an idle gazer upon the expression of that hallowed affection as it flowed from the warm hearts of the father and daughter.  \"As I can be of no further service here, I will go and do what I can for those who need my help. If you want any assistance, I shall be close at hand,\" said he, as he walked away to the busy scene of woe which surrounded the wreck.  The wounded, the maimed, and the dead were rapidly taken from the pile of ruins, and placed in the cars on the road; and there was no longer anything for the young officer to do. He returned to the grassy couch of her whom he could not but regard as peculiarly his patient. The father had recovered his self-possession, and satisfied himself that Emmie was not more seriously injured than her deliverer had declared.  \"My young friend, while I thank God that my daughter is still alive, I am very grateful to you for the care you have bestowed upon her,\" said the father, as he grasped the young officer's hand.  \"You may well thank him, Mr. Guilford,\" said one of the two gentlemen who had followed the young officer to the spot; \"for the first thing I saw, when I came out from under the ruins, was this young man lifting half the top of the car off your daughter.\"  \"I beg your pardon, sir, but I think we should convey the young lady up to the cars; for I see they are about ready to start,\" said Lieutenant Somers, blushing up to the eyes.  \"I thank you, young man,\" added Mr. Guilford with deep feeling. \"I must see you again, and know more about you. Emmie has told me how kind you have been to her; and you may be sure I shall never forget it while I live. How do you feel now, Emmie?\"  \"My arm begins to pain me a little,\" she answered languidly.  \"We must put you into the car, and in a short time we shall be able to do something for you.\"  \"I will carry her up to the train, sir,\" said the young officer.  \"I thank you, sir,\" said Emmie with a smile; \"but I think I can walk.\"  \"Well,\" said the gentleman who had spoken before, \"I saw him carry you from the wreck to this place; and I am bound to say, I never saw a mother handle her baby more tenderly.\"  \"I am very grateful to him for what he has done for me,\" added Emmie with a slight blush; \"and if I needed his services, I certainly should accept his kind offer.\"  She took the arm of her father, and walked very well till she came to the steep bank, whose ascent required more strength than she then possessed. Her father and Lieutenant Somers then made a \"hand-chair,\" and bore her up to the car, in which she was as comfortably disposed as the circumstances would permit. The train started with its melancholy freight of wounded, dead and dying.  \"I see, sir, you are an officer in the army,\" said Mr. Guilford as the train moved off; \"but I have not yet learned your name.\"  \"Thomas Somers, sir,\" replied our young officer.  \"I must trouble you to write it down for me, with your residence when at home, and your regiment in the field.\"  Lieutenant Somers complied with this request, and in return the gentleman gave him his address.  \"I shall never forget you, Lieutenant Somers,\" said Mr. Guilford when he had carefully deposited the paper in his memorandum-book. \"I have it in my power to be of service to you; and if you ever want a friend, I shall consider it a favor if you will come to me, or write to me.\"  \"Thank you, sir; I am very much obliged to you. But I hope you won't consider yourself under any obligations to me for what I have done. I couldn't have helped doing it if I had tried.\"  \"Lieutenant Somers, you are in luck,\" said the gentleman who had accompanied him before. \"That is Senator Guilford, of ----, and he will make a brigadier-general of you before you are a year older.\"     CHAPTER III  A FRIEND AT COURT   Lieutenant Somers sat down in one corner of the car, near the seats occupied by Miss Guilford and her father. He was just beginning to be conscious of the fact that he had done a \"big thing;\" not because he had helped one of God's suffering creatures, but because she happened to be a Senator's daughter. But he still had the happy reflection, that what he had done had been prompted by motives of humanity, not by the love of applause, or for the purpose of winning the favor of a great man who could dispense the \"loaves and fishes\" when he should need them.  He was rather sensitive. He was a young man of eighteen, and he had not yet become familiar with the grossness and selfishness of this calculating world. He was rather offended at the patronage which the Senator had proposed to bestow upon him, and he even regretted that he had so readily given him his address.  Lieutenant Somers regarded himself as emphatically a fighting officer; and the idea of working his way up to distinction by the favor of a member of Congress was repulsive to him. He really wished the Hon. Mr. Guilford had only thanked him for what he had done, and not said a word about having it in his power to be of service to him.  While he was meditating upon the events which had transpired, and the Senator's patronizing offer, he saw Captain de Banyan enter the forward door of the car through which the gentleman who had taken so much pains to compliment the young officer had disappeared a short time before. The distinguished captain walked through the car directly to the seat of the lieutenant, who had not even yet ceased to blush under the praises which had been bestowed upon him.  \"Somers, your hand,\" said he, extending his own. \"I have heard all about it, and am proud that our regiment has furnished so brave and devoted a man. Oh, don't blush, my dear fellow! You are a modest man. I sympathize with you; for I am a modest man myself. I didn't get over blushing for three weeks after his imperial majesty, the Emperor of France, complimented me for some little thing I did at the battle of Palestro.\"  \"I thought that was at Magenta,\" added Somers.  \"So it was. The fact is, I have been in a great many battles, and I get them mixed up a little sometimes. But you are in luck, Somers,\" continued the captain in a lower tone, as he seated himself by the side of his fellow-officer.  \"Why so?\"  \"They say she is the daughter of a Senator.\"  \"What of that?\"  \"What of that! Why, my dear fellow, you are as innocent as a school girl. Don't you see he can get you on some general's staff, and have you promoted every time there is a skirmish?\"  \"I don't want to be promoted unless I earn it.\"  \"Of course you don't; but every officer that earns it won't get it. By the way, Somers, can't you introduce me to the old gentleman?\"  \"I never saw him before in my life.\"  \"No matter for that. I'll warrant you, he'll be glad to make all your friends his friends.\"  \"But I don't feel enough acquainted with him to introduce a gentleman whom I never saw in my life till two hours ago.\"  \"You are right, my dear fellow; excuse me,\" replied Captain de Banyan, looking very much disappointed. \"I dare say, if I should show him the autograph of the Emperor of France, he would be very glad to know me.\"  \"No doubt of it. At any rate, I recommend you to make the trial.\"  \"Yes; but the mischief of it is, I have left all those papers at home.\"  \"That's unfortunate,\" added Lieutenant Somers, who had some serious doubts in regard to the existence of those papers.  \"So it is. If I had been lucky enough to have made the acquaintance of that young lady, as you have, I would not let my aspirations stop short of the stars of a major-general.\"  \"You need not as it is, if you do your duty.\"  \"Ah! my dear fellow, you are as sentimental as a girl of sixteen. I am a modest man; but, in my estimation, there are ten thousand men in the army as good as I am. They can't all be major-generals, can they?\"  \"Certainly not.\"  \"Then, if you live a few months longer, you will find out how good a thing it is to have a friend at court. You are a modest young man; but I suppose you think there isn't another man in the army who is quite your equal, and that your merit and your bravery will make a brigadier of you in less than a year. It's a good thing to think so; but----\"  \"I don't think so. That would be modesty with a vengeance.\"  \"I was a sentimental boy like you once, and I was just as certain that I should be made a field-marshal, and have the command of the French army in the Crimea----\"  \"I thought you were in the English army in the Crimea,\" interposed the young lieutenant, eager to change the subject.  \"Certainly, in the English army; that's what I said,\" continued the gallant captain, entirely unmoved by the interruption. \"I was just as sure of having the command of the British army in the Crimea as you are of becoming a brigadier"]]]
