She had put on to-day, for the first time, her summer costume,--a skirt and jacket of striped white dimity, open a little at the neck, with a kerchief of soft white net inside. This kerchief was fastened with quite the prettiest brooch that ever was,--a pansy, made of five deep, clear amethysts, set in a narrow rim of chased gold. Miss Wealthy always wore this brooch; for in winter it harmonized as well with her gown of lilac cashmere as it did in summer with the white dimity. At her elbow stood Martha; it was her place in life. She seldom had to be called; but was always there when Miss Wealthy wanted anything, standing a step back, but close beside her beloved mistress. Martha carried her aureole in her pocket, or somewhere else out of sight; but she was a saint all the same. Her gray hair was smooth, and she wore spectacles with silver rims, and a gray print gown, with the sleeves invariably rolled up to the elbows, except on Sundays, when she put on her black cashmere, and spent the afternoon in uneasy state.  \"I think the room looks very pretty, Martha,\" said Miss Wealthy, for the tenth time.  \"It does, Mam,\" replied Martha, as heartily as if she had not heard the remark before. \"Proper nice it looks, I'm sure.\"  \"You mended that little place in the curtain, did you, Martha?\"  \"I did, Mam. I don't think as you could find it now, unless you looked very close.\"  \"And you put lavender and orange-flower water in the bottles? Very well; then that's all, I think.\"  [Illustration: \"'AND EVERYTHING IS RIGHT FOR SUPPER, MARTHA?'\"]  Miss Wealthy gave one more contented look round the pretty room, with its gay rose-flowering chintz, its cool straw matting, and comfortable cushioned window-seats, and then drew the blinds exactly half-way down, and left the room, Martha carefully closing the door.  In the cool, shady drawing-room all was in perfect order too. There were flowers in the tall Indian vases on the mantelpiece, a great bowl of roses on the mosaic centre-table, and, as usual, a bunch of pansies on the little round table by the armchair in which Miss Wealthy always sat. She established herself there now, and took up her knitting with a little sigh of contentment.  \"And everything is right for supper, Martha?\" she asked.  \"Yes, Mam,\" said Martha. \"A little chicken-pie, Mam, and French potatoes, and honey. I should be making the biscuit now, Mam, if you didn't need me.\"  \"Oh no, Martha,\" said the old lady, \"I don't need anything. We shall hear the wheels when they come.\"  She looked out of the window, across the pleasant lawn, at the blue river, and seemed for a moment as if she were going to ask Martha whether that were all right. But she said nothing, and the saint in gray print trotted away to her kitchen.  \"Dear Martha!\" said Miss Wealthy, settling herself comfortably among her cushions. \"It is a great privilege to have Martha. I do hope these dear girls will not put her out. She grows a little set in her ways as she grows older, my good Martha. I don't think that blind is _quite_ half-way down. It makes the whole room look askew, doesn't it?\"  She rose, and pulled the blind straight, patted a tidy on the back of a chair, and settled herself among her cushions again, with another critical glance at the river. A pause ensued, during which the old lady's needles clicked steadily; then, at last, the sound of wheels was heard, and putting her work down in exactly the same spot from which she had taken it up, Miss Wealthy went out on the piazza to welcome her young guests.  Hildegarde sprang lightly from the carriage, and gave her hand to her companion to help her out.  \"Dear Cousin Wealthy,\" she cried, \"here we are, safe and sound. I am coming to kiss you in one moment. Carefully, Rose dear! Lean on me, so! _there_ you are! now take my arm. Slowly, slowly! See, Cousin Wealthy! see how well she walks! Isn't it delightful?\"  \"It is, indeed!\" said the old lady, heartily, kissing first the glowing cheek and then the pale one, as the girls came up to her. \"And how do you do, my dears? I am very glad indeed to see you. Rose, you look so much better, I should hardly have known you; and you, Hilda, look like June itself. I must call Martha--\" But Martha was there, at her elbow. \"Oh, Martha! here are the young ladies.\"  Hildegarde shook hands warmly with Martha, and Rose gave one of her shy, sweet smiles.  \"This is Miss Hildegarde,\" said the old lady; \"and this is Miss Rose. Perhaps you will take them up to their rooms now, Martha, and Jeremiah can take the trunks up. We will have supper, my dears, as soon as you are ready; for I am sure you must be hungry.\"  \"Yes, we are as hungry as hunters, Cousin Wealthy!\" cried Hildegarde. \"We shall frighten you with our appetites, I fear. This way, Martha? Yes, in one minute. Rose dear, I will put my arm round you, and you can take hold of the stair-rail. Slowly now!\"  They ascended the stairs slowly, and Hildegarde did not loose her hold of her friend until she had seated her in a comfortable easy-chair in the pretty chintz bedroom.  \"There, dear!\" she said anxiously, stooping to unfasten her cloak. \"Are you very dreadfully tired?\"  \"Oh no!\" replied Rose, cheerfully; \"not at all _dreadfully_ tired, only comfortably. I ache a little, of course, but--Oh, what a pleasant room! And this chair is comfort itself.\"  \"The window-seat for me!\" cried Hildegarde, tossing her hat on the bed, and then leaning out of the window with both arms on the sill. \"Rose, don't move! I forbid you to stir hand or foot. I will tell you while you are resting. There is a river,--a great, wide, beautiful river, just across the lawn.\"  \"Well, dear,\" said quiet Rose, smiling, \"you knew there was a river; your mother told us so.\"  \"Yes, Goose, I did know it,\" cried Hildegarde; \"but I had not seen it, and didn't know what it was like. It is all blue, with sparkles all over it, and little brown flurries where the wind strikes it. There are willows all along the edge--\"  \"To hang our harps on?\" inquired Rose.  \"Precisely!\" replied Hildegarde. \"And I think--Rose, I _do_ see a boat-house! My dear, this is bliss! We will bathe every morning. You have never seen me dive, Rose.\"  \"I have not,\" said Rose; \"and it would be a pity to do it out of the window, dear, because in the first place I should only see your heels as you went out, and in the second--\"  \"Peace, paltry soul!\" cried Hilda. \"Here comes a scow, loaded with wood. The wood has been wet, and is all yellow and gleaming. 'Scow,'--what an absurd word! 'Barge' is prettier.\"  \"It sounds so like Shalott,\" said Rose; \"I must come and look too.          \"'By the margin, willow-veiled,          Slide the heavy barges, trailed          By slow horses.'\"  \"Yes, it is just like it!\" cried Hildegarde. \"It is really a redeeming feature in you, Rose, that you are so apt in your quotations. Say the part about the river; that is exactly like what I am looking at.\"  \"Do you say it!\" said Rose, coming softly forward, and taking her seat beside her friend. \"I like best to hear you.\"  And Hildegarde repeated in a low tone,--          \"Willows whiten, aspens quiver,          Little breezes dusk and shiver          Through the wave that runs forever          By the island in the river          Flowing down to Camelot.\"  The two girls squeezed each other's hand a little, and looked at the shining river, and straightway forgot that there was anything else to be done, till a sharp little tinkle roused them from their dream.  \"Oh!\" cried Hildegarde. \"Rose, how _could_ you let me go a-woolgathering? Just look at my hair!\"  \"And my hands!\" said Rose, in dismay. \"And we said we were as hungry as hunters, and would be down in a minute. What will Miss Bond say?\"  \"Well, it is all the river's fault,\" said Hildegarde, splashing vigorously in the basin. \"It shouldn't be so lovely! Here, dear, here is fresh water for you. Now the brush! Let me just wobble your hair up for you, so. There! now you are my pinkest Rose, and I am all right too; so down we go.\"  Miss Wealthy had been seriously disturbed when the girls did not appear promptly at sound of the tea-bell. She took her seat at the tea-table and looked it over carefully. \"Punctuality is so important,\" she said, half to herself and half to Martha, who had just set down the teapot,--\"That mat is not _quite_ straight, is it, Martha?--especially in young people. I know it makes you nervous, Martha,\"--Martha did not look in the least nervous,--\"but it will probably not happen again. If the butter were a _little_ farther this way! Thank you, Martha. Oh, here you are, my dears! Sit down, pray! You must be very hungry after--But probably you felt the need of resting a little, and to-morrow you will be quite fresh.\"  \"No, it wasn't that, Cousin Wealthy,\" said Hildegarde, frankly. \"I am ashamed to say that we were looking out of the window, and the river was so lovely that we forgot all about supper. Please forgive us this once, for really we are pretty punctual generally. It is part of Papa's military code, you know.\"  \"True, my dear, true!\" said Miss Wealthy, brightening up at once. \"Your father is very wise. Regular habits are a great privilege, really. Will you have tea, Hilda dear, or milk?\"  \"Oh, milk, please!\" said Hilda. \"I am not to take tea till I am twenty-one, Cousin Wealthy, nor coffee either.\"  \"And a very good plan,\" said Miss Wealthy, approvingly. \"Milk is the natural beverage--will you cut that pie, dear, and help Rose, and yourself?--for the young. When one is older, however, a cup of tea is very comforting. None for me, thank you, dear. I have my little dish of milk-toast, but I thought the pie would be just right for you young people. Martha's pastry is so _very_ light that a small"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24826"],["title","Hildegarde's Holiday: A Story for Girls (#2)"],["body","of it is not injurious.\"  \"Rose!\" said Hildegarde, in tones of hushed rapture, \"it is a chicken-pie, and it is all for us. Hold your plate, favored one of the gods! A river, a boat-house, and chicken-pie! Cousin Wealthy, I am so glad you asked us to come!\"  \"Are you, dear?\" said Miss Wealthy, looking up placidly from her milk-toast, \"Well, so am I!\"     CHAPTER III.  THE ORCHARD.   Next morning, when breakfast was over, Miss Wealthy made a little speech, giving the two girls the freedom of the place.  \"You will find your own way about, my dears,\" she said. \"I will only give you some general directions. The orchard is to the right, beyond the garden. There is a pleasant seat there under one of the apple-trees, where you may like to sit. Beyond that are the woods. On the other side of the house is the barnyard, and the road goes by to the village. You will find plenty of flowers all about, and I hope you will amuse yourselves.\"  \"Oh, indeed we shall, Cousin Wealthy!\" cried Hildegarde. \"It is delight enough just to breathe this delicious air and look at the river.\"  They were sitting on the piazza, from which the lawn sloped down to a great hedge of Norway fir, just beyond which flowed the broad blue stream of the Kennebec.  \"How about the river, Cousin Wealthy?\" asked Hildegarde, timidly. \"I thought I saw a boat-house through the trees. Could we go out to row?\"  Miss Wealthy seemed a little flurried by the question. \"My dear,\" she said, and hesitated,--\"my dear, have you--do your parents allow you to go on the water? Can you swim?\"  \"Oh, yes,\" said Hildegarde, \"I can swim very well, Cousin Wealthy,--at least, Papa says I can; and I can row and paddle and sail.\"  \"Oh, not sail!\" cried Miss Wealthy, with an odd little catch in her breath,--\"not sail, my dear! I could not--I could not think of that for a moment. But there is a row-boat,\" she added, after a pause,--\"a boat which Jeremiah uses. If Jeremiah thinks she is perfectly safe, you can go out, if you feel quite sure your parents would wish it.\"  \"Oh, I am very sure,\" said Hildegarde; \"for I asked Papa, almost the last thing before we left. Thank you, Cousin Wealthy, so much! We will be rather quiet this morning, for Rose does not feel very strong; but this afternoon perhaps we will try the boat. Isn't there something I can do for you, Cousin Wealthy? Can't I help Martha? I can do all kinds of work,--can't I, Rose?--and I love it!\"  But Martha had a young girl in the kitchen, Miss Wealthy said, whom she was training to help her; and she herself had letters to write and accounts to settle. So the two girls sauntered off slowly, arm in arm; Rose leaning on her friend, whose strong young frame seemed able to support them both.  The garden was a very pleasant place, with rhubarb and sunflowers, sweet peas and mignonette, planted here and there among the rows of vegetables, just as Jeremiah's fancy suggested. Miss Wealthy's own flower-beds, trim and gay with geraniums, pansies, and heliotrope, were under the dining-room windows; but somehow the girls liked Jeremiah's garden best. Hildegarde pulled some sweet peas, and stuck the winged blossoms in Rose's fair hair, giving a fly-away look to her smooth locks. Then she began to sniff inquiringly. \"Southernwood!\" she said,--\"I smell southernwood somewhere, Rose. Where is it?\"  \"Yonder,\" said Rose, pointing to a feathery bush not far off.  \"Oh! and there is lavender too, Hilda! Do you suppose we may pick some? I do like to have a sprig of lavender in my belt.\"  At this moment Jeremiah appeared, wheeling a load of turf. He was \"long and lank and brown as is the ribbed sea-sand,\" and Hildegarde mentally christened him the Ancient Mariner on the spot; but he smiled sadly and said, \"_Good_-mornin',\" and seemed pleased when the girls praised his garden. \"Ee-yus!\" he said, with placid melancholy. \"I've seen wuss places. Minglin' the blooms with the truck and herbs was my idee, as you may say,--'livens up one, and sobers down the other. _She_ laughs at me, but she don't keer, s'long as she has all she wants. Cut ye some mignonette? That's very favoryte with me,--very favoryte.\"  He cut a great bunch of mignonette; and Rose, proffering her request for lavender, received a nosegay as big as she could hold in both hands.  \"The roses is just comin' on,\" he said. \"Over behind them beans they are. A sight o' roses there'll be in another week. Coreopsis is pooty, too; that's down the other side of the corn. Curus garding, folks thinks; but, there, it's my idee, and she don't keer.\"  Much amused, the girls thanked the melancholy prophet, and wandered away into the orchard, to find the seat that Miss Wealthy had told them of.  \"Oh, what a lovely, lovely orchard!\" cried Hildegarde, in delight; and indeed it was a pretty place. The apple-trees were old, and curiously gnarled and twisted, bending this way and that, as apple-trees will. The short, fine grass was like emerald; there were no flowers at all, only green and brown, with the sunlight flickering through the branches overhead. They found the seat, which was curiously wedged into the double trunk of the very patriarch of apple-trees.  \"Do look at him!\" cried Hildegarde. \"He is like a giant with the rheumatism. Suppose we call him Blunderbore. What does twist them so, Rose? Look! there is one with a trunk almost horizontal.\"  \"I don't know,\" said Rose, slowly. \"Another item for the ignorance list, Hilda. It is growing appallingly long. I really _don't_ know why they twist so. In the forest they grow much taller than in orchards, and go straight up. Farmer Hartley has seen one seventy feet high, he says.\"  \"Let us call it vegetable rheumatism!\" said Hildegarde. \"How _is_ your poor back this morning, ma'am?\" She addressed an ancient tree with respectful sympathy; indeed, it did look like an aged dame bent almost double. \"Have you ever tried Pond's Extract? I think I must really buy a gallon or so for you. And as long as you must bend over, you will not mind if I take a little walk along your suffering spine, and sit on your arm, will you?\"  She walked up the tree, and seated herself on a branch which was crooked like a friendly arm, making a very comfortable seat. \"She's a dear old lady, Rose!\" she cried. \"Doesn't mind a bit, but thinks it rather does her good,--like _massage_, you know. What do you suppose her name is?\"  \"Dame Crump would do, wouldn't it?\" replied Rose, looking critically at the venerable dame.  \"Of course! and that ferocious old person brandishing three arms over yonder must be Croquemitaine,--          \"'Croquemitaine! Croquemitaine!          Ne dinerai pas 'vec toi!'  I think they are rather a savage set,--don't you, Rosy?--all except my dear Dame Crump here.\"  \"I _know_ they are,\" said Rose, in a low voice. \"Hush! the three witches are just behind you, Hilda. Their skinny arms are outstretched to clasp you! Fly, and save yourself from the caldron!\"  \"Avaunt!\" cried Hilda, springing lightly from Dame Crump's sheltering arm. \"Ye secret, black, and midnight hags, what is 't ye do?\"  \"A deed without a name!\" muttered Rose, in sepulchral tones.  \"I think it is, indeed!\" cried Hildegarde, laughing. \"Poor old gouty things! they can only claw the air, like Grandfather Smallweed, and cannot take a single step to clutch me.\"  \"Just like me, as I was a year ago,\" said Rose, smiling.  \"Rose! how can you?\" cried Hildegarde, indignantly; \"as if you had not always been a white rosebush.\"  \"On wheels!\" said Rose. \"I often think of my dear old chair, and wonder if it misses me. Hildegarde dear!\"  \"My lamb!\" replied Hildegarde, sitting down by her friend and giving her a little hug.  \"I wish you could know how wonderful it all is! I wish--no, I don't wish you could be lame even for half an hour; but I wish you could just _dream_ that you were lame, and then wake up and find everything right again. Having always walked, you cannot know the wonder of it. To think that I can stand up--so! and walk--so! actually one foot before the other, just like other people. Oh! and I used to wonder how they did it. I don't now understand how 'four-leggers,' as Bubble calls them, move so many things without getting mixed up.\"  \"Dear Rose! you are happy, aren't you?\" exclaimed Hildegarde, with delight.  \"Happy!\" echoed Rose, her sweet face glowing like her own name-flower. \"But I was always happy, you know, dear. Now it is happiness, with fairyland thrown in. I am some wonderful creature, walking through miracles; a kind of--Who was the fairy-knight you were telling me about?\"  \"Lohengrin?\" said Hildegarde. \"No, you are more like Una, in the 'Faerie Queene.' In fact, I think you _are_ Una.\"  \"And then,\" continued Rose, \"there is another thing! At least, there are a thousand other things, but one that I was thinking of specially just now, when you named the trees. That was only play to you; but, Hilda, it used to be almost quite real for me,--that sort of thing. Sitting there as I used, day after day, year after year, mostly alone,--for mother and Bubble were always at work, you know,--you cannot imagine how real all the garden-people, as I called them, were to me. Why, my Eglantine--I never told you about Eglantine, Hilda!\"  \"No, heartless thing! you never did,\" said Hildegarde; \"and you may tell me this instant. A pretty friend you are, keeping things from me in that way!\"  \"She was a fair maiden,\" said Rose. \"She stood against the wall, just by my window. She was very lovely and graceful, with long, slender arms. Some people called her a sweetbrier-bush. She was my most intimate friend, and was always peeping in at the window and calling me to come out. When I came and sat close beside her in my chair, she would bend over me, and tell me all about her love-affairs, which gave her a great deal of trouble.\"  \"Poor thing!\" said Hildegarde, sympathetically.  \"She had two lovers,\" continued Rose, dreamily, talking half to herself. \"One was Sir Scraggo de Cedar, a tall knight in rusty armor,"]]]
