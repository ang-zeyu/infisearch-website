I suppose I've seen it, and I expect I've been vexed that you've never told me.  I--I wanted you to.\"  \"Wanted me to!\" cried Bob.  \"You have never given me a chance. And--and you always seemed to care for--for those other fellows.\"  \"I wanted you to make your chances.  If--if a man loves a girl, he should dare anything to get her.  Anything.  What do I care about Hector Trevanion?  He hasn't a thought in his head above his latest horse and his newest uniform.  But how could I help being friendly with him, when you--have always on the slightest pretext been ready to leave me with him.\"  \"And you wanted me all the time!\"  There was a note of joy and triumph in his voice.  \"I don't know,\" replied the girl.  \"I'll be absolutely frank with you, Bob.  You are not the sort of man I wanted to love.  Yes, I'll admit it--I wanted to love a soldier, a sailor, a man of action.  I can never admire a man who will be content to spend his days in a library poring over old dusty books.  That's why I have been angry when I've heard you glorifying these useless old fossils.  And yet--oh, Bob!\" and the girl concluded with a sob.  \"Do you mean,\" and Bob's voice was tremulous, \"that you cared for me all the time, although you--you didn't like my plans for my future? That you preferred me to Trevanion?  Oh, Nancy!\"  \"As though a girl must care for six feet of flesh without brains because she isn't a blue-stocking.  Why--why--couldn't you see, Bob?\"  \"And I say--oh, Nancy, does this mean that you care for me--love me?\"  \"I'm afraid I do,\" she half-laughed, half-sobbed.  \"Afraid?\"  \"Yes, don't you see?  You are not in the least like the man I wanted to love.  You could have won your blue as a cricketer, but you wouldn't take the trouble to get it.  A man in Oxford told me that you could be the best three-quarter in the 'Varsity Rugby team, but that you were too lazy to play.  You've been a sort of negative creature, while I love a man of action.  What are old shrivelled manuscripts worth to the world to-day?  Who cares about the sayings of some old dead and forgotten German, or some obscure passages in _Bede's Ecclesiastical History_, when there's a great surging life all around us to-day? History is only a record of what took place in the past; I love the thought of a man who wants to make history, who sets his ideas to action.  And you, Bob, you have told me again and again that you want to spend your life in historical research, or some such useless thing.\"  \"But--but, Nancy, what does all that matter when I love you--love you with all my life?  Besides----\"  \"I come of a race of fighters,\" cried the girl.  \"When Philip of Spain sent over his Great Armada, to rob us of our liberty, one of my ancestors fought the Dons.  He gave ships and men to our country, and helped to save us from oppression.  When Napoleon cast a shadow over Europe, and threatened to destroy our country, men of my name were among the foremost in fighting him.  My grandfather represented St. Ia in Parliament, and he roused the country.  While you--oh, Bob, forgive me, but your ideal seems to be to sit in a library in Oxford, wearing a dirty old dressing-gown and iron-rimmed spectacles, reading or writing books which will be of no use to any one!  Is that a life for a man?\"  \"But if his mind is cast in that mould?\"  \"I haven't finished yet,\" went on the girl.  \"Forgive me, Bob, for talking so much.  I wouldn't only--oh, Bob, can't you see?  Why, at our last dance--when--when I had kept four for you, you never even asked for them.  And I--I wanted to dance them too; but--but I had to sit them out, and when other men begged me to let them put their names down on my card, I said I was tired.  Then, when I heard afterwards that you had gone into the library, and were reading some old book which hadn't been opened for years, I just--cried.\"  \"Oh, Nancy, I never dreamt of such a thing!  I--I never thought you wanted me.  I was just aching for you all the time, but I thought--why, you've always laughed at my dancing.  But there, now I know, I can do anything, be anything.  And there's nothing I won't do for you?\"  \"You are not vexed with me, are you?\"  \"I couldn't be vexed with you, Nancy.  I'd let myself be cut in bits for you.  And you love me, don't you?  Oh, it's too good to be true! but say you do, tell me that in spite of everything you love me?\"  \"Haven't I been telling you so all the time?  And--and yet you haven't asked me to--to----\"  \"What, Nancy?\"  \"Oh, I do hate a coward!\"  \"But what haven't I asked you?\"  \"Bob, isn't there something you want very much?\"  \"Yes, there is,\" replied Bob.  \"Something--that----  Nancy, you won't be vexed with me if I ask you?\"  \"Risk my being vexed,\" laughed the girl.  \"Then I want to take you in my arms, and kiss you--kiss you a hundred times.\"  \"Then, why don't you?\"  Bob looked around him, like one afraid.  They were beneath the shadow of a great rock.  At their feet was headland grass, wind-swept and grey, but peeping through the grass were thousands upon thousands of wild thyme, giving the little plateau a purple hue.  They were hidden from the gaze of any who might be on the great rock.  His heart beat so that his breath came with difficulty; he was trembling with a new-found joy--a joy so great that it almost gave him pain.  \"Oh, my love!--my love!\" he cried, as he took her in his arms, and his kisses were as pure as those with which a young mother lasses her firstborn.   \"What haven't I asked you?\" he said, a few minutes later.  They were sitting beneath the shadow of the rock now, and Nancy was rearranging her hat.  She did not reply, but her eyes were full of gladsome mischief as she looked at him.  \"I mean just now, when--when you said you had been telling me that you loved me, but I hadn't asked for something.  What was it?\"  \"You've made up for it since,\" and there was a laugh in her voice.  \"Do you mean that you wanted me to kiss you?  Oh, you are right, Nancy, I am an awful coward, but I'll make up for lost time now.\"  The sea continued to roll on the great rugged rock, which threw its mighty head far out into its depths.  Overhead the sea-birds hovered, sailing with graceful motion over the silvery waters, and uttering their mournful cry, while far out vessels ploughed their way up and down the Atlantic; but neither noticed.  They were happy in each other's love.  Nancy had forgotten the fact that Robert Nancarrow was not the kind of man she had meant to love, while he was far too happy to care for the lecture she had given him.  Her kisses were warm upon his lips, her words of love rung in his ears.  They were in the dreamland of happy lovers, while the sky of their lives was as free from clouds as the great dome of blue overhead.  He was the only man she had ever loved, or ever could love, while to him the maid, wilful and passionate though she might be, was perfect.  What were books, learning, and the fame of scholarship to him now?  He had won the love of the girl whom for years he had loved, and ever despaired of winning. She, who had seemed so far away from him, so far above him, had come to his arms, willingly, gladly.  She, with her proud old name, and almost lordly wealth, had chosen him, and forgotten everything in her choice.  It seemed too wonderful to be true, and he looked at her again and again in his wonder, proud beyond all words, yet almost afraid to believe in his good fortune.  \"Oh, Nancy, you are beautiful!\"  The light of joy flashed from her eyes.  What girl is there beneath the all-beholding heavens who does not long to know that the man she loves thinks her beautiful?--Who does not long for him to tell her?  \"And what a lovely dress you are wearing.\"  \"I've worn it three times since you came down from Oxford, and you've never once mentioned it.\"  \"I never saw it as I see it now.  I never saw as I see you now.  Nancy, there's no one like.  Bless you, my love, for loving me.\"  But I must not dwell on that happy hour, much as I would love to.  We who are older may laugh at \"Love's young dream,\" and grow cynical about its transitory nature.  We may say that lovers live in a fool's paradise, and that the dream of lovers ends in the tragedies of later years.  Still, there's nothing sweeter or purer on God's green earth than the love of a clean-minded honest lad for the maid he has chosen from all others.  It keeps the world young and hopeful; humanly speaking, it is life's greatest joy, and the man who can throw scorn upon its joys and utter cynical words about its reality has himself lost the pearl of great price.  It is he who is to be pitied, and not the lovers.  They hear the birds of paradise singing in the bowers of Eden, while he hears only the croaking of the raven.  They got back to realities presently.  Bob's new-found joy had led him to the realisation of the future.  \"I'm going to speak to your father to-night, Nancy.  I know he'll be angry, but that I don't mind a bit.\"  \"No, Bob, you must not speak to him--at least not yet.\"  \"Why?\"  \"Because he'll refuse, and you mustn't speak to him until you can make him consent.\"  \"I don't understand, Nancy.\"  \"You see, he has exactly the same feeling that I have about men.  He would never consent to my being the wife of a book-worm.\"  \"Oh, I've thought that all out while I've been here,\" replied Bob confidently.  \"Yes, I know I've been unpractical--a dreamer, in fact. But I'm going to alter all that.  Now you've told me--that--that you love me, I feel I must become a man of action.  You've wakened something in me that I didn't know existed.  I haven't been half alive. I've imagined that only thoughts, ideas mattered; now I know differently.  I've lived only half-life.  Mark you, I don't altogether go back upon my faith--I only add a new element to it.  I've always said that we owe everything to thought.  I've said that thoughts covered the seas with floating cities, and converted the world into"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2516"],["title","Redgauntlet: A Tale of the Eighteenth Century (#1)"],["body","dangerous precincts of the British capital. This appears from Dr. King’s ANECDOTES OF HIS OWN TIMES.  ‘September, 1750.--I received a note from my Lady Primrose, who desired to see me immediately. As soon as I waited on her, she led me into her dressing-room, and presented me to--’ [the Chevalier, doubtless]. ‘If I was surprised to find him there, I was still more astonished when he acquainted me with the motives which had induced him to hazard a journey to England at this juncture. The impatience of his friends who were in exile had formed a scheme which was impracticable; but although it had been as feasible as they had represented it to him, yet no preparation had been made, nor was anything ready to carry it into execution. He was soon convinced that he had been deceived; and, therefore, after a stay in London of five days only, he returned to the place from whence he came.’ Dr. King was in 1750 a keen Jacobite, as may be inferred from the visit made by him to the prince under such circumstances, and from his being one of that unfortunate person’s chosen correspondents. He, as well as other men of sense and observation, began to despair of making their fortune in the party which they had chosen. It was indeed sufficiently dangerous; for, during the short visit just described, one of Dr. King’s servants remarked the stranger’s likeness to Prince Charles, whom he recognized from the common busts.  The occasion taken for breaking up the Stuart interest we shall tell in Dr. King’s own words:--‘When he (Charles Edward) was in Scotland, he had a mistress whose name was Walkinshaw, and whose sister was at that time, and is still, housekeeper at Leicester House. Some years after he was released from his prison, and conducted out of France, he sent for this girl, who soon acquired such a dominion over him, that she was acquainted with all his schemes, and trusted with his most secret correspondence. As soon as this was known in England, all those persons of distinction who were attached to him were greatly alarmed: they imagined that this wench had been placed in his family by the English ministers; and, considering her sister’s situation, they seemed to have some ground for their suspicion; wherefore, they dispatched a gentleman to Paris, where the prince then was, who had instructions to insist that Mrs. Walkinshaw should be removed to a convent for a certain term; but her gallant absolutely refused to comply with this demand; and although Mr. M’Namara, the gentleman who was sent to him, who has a natural eloquence and an excellent understanding, urged the most cogent reasons, and used all the arts of persuasion, to induce him to part with his mistress, and even proceeded so far as to assure him, according to his instructions, that an immediate interruption of all correspondence with his most powerful friends in England, and, in short, that the ruin of his interest, which was now daily increasing, would be the infallible consequence of his refusal; yet he continued inflexible, and all M’Namara’s entreaties and remonstrances were ineffectual. M’Namara stayed in Paris some days beyond the time prescribed him, endeavouring to reason the prince into a better temper; but finding him obstinately persevere in his first answer, he took his leave with concern and indignation, saying, as he passed out, “What has your family done, sir, thus to draw down the vengeance of Heaven on every branch of it, through so many ages?” It is worthy of remark, that in all the conferences which M’Namara had with the prince on this occasion, the latter declared that it was not a violent passion, or indeed any particular regard, which attached him to Mrs. Walkinshaw and that he could see her removed from him without any concern; but he would not receive directions, in respect to his private conduct, from any man alive. When M’Namara returned to London, and reported the prince’s answer to the gentlemen who had employed him, they were astonished and confounded. However, they soon resolved on the measures which they were to pursue for the future, and determined no longer to serve a man who could not be persuaded to serve himself, and chose rather to endanger the lives of his best and most faithful friends, than part with an harlot, whom, as he often declared, he neither loved nor esteemed.’  From this anecdote, the general truth of which is indubitable, the principal fault of Charles Edward’s temper is sufficiently obvious. It was a high sense of his own importance, and an obstinate adherence to what he had once determined on--qualities which, if he had succeeded in his bold attempt, gave the nation little room to hope that he would have been found free from the love of prerogative and desire of arbitrary power, which characterized his unhappy grandfather. He gave a notable instance how far this was the leading feature of his character, when, for no reasonable cause that can be assigned, he placed his own single will in opposition to the necessities of France, which, in order to purchase a peace become necessary to the kingdom, was reduced to gratify Britain by prohibiting the residence of Charles within any part of the French dominions. It was in vain that France endeavoured to lessen the disgrace of this step by making the most flattering offers, in hopes to induce the prince of himself to anticipate this disagreeable alternative, which, if seriously enforced, as it was likely to be, he had no means whatever of resisting, by leaving the kingdom as of his own free will. Inspired, however, by the spirit of hereditary obstinacy, Charles preferred a useless resistance to a dignified submission, and, by a series of idle bravadoes, laid the French court under the necessity of arresting their late ally, and sending him to close confinement in the Bastille, from which he was afterwards sent out of the French dominions, much in the manner in which a convict is transported to the place of his destination.  In addition to these repeated instances of a rash and inflexible temper, Dr. King also adds faults alleged to belong to the prince’s character, of a kind less consonant with his noble birth and high pretensions. He is said by this author to have been avaricious, or parsimonious at least, to such a degree of meanness, as to fail, even when he had ample means, in relieving the sufferers who had lost their fortune, and sacrificed all in his ill-fated attempt. [The approach is thus expressed by Dr. King, who brings the charge:--‘But the most odious part of his character is his love of money, a vice which I do not remember to have been imputed by our historians to any of his ancestors, and is the certain index of a base and little mind. I know it may be urged in his vindication, that a prince in exile ought to be an economist. And so he ought; but, nevertheless, his purse should be always open as long as there is anything in it, to relieve the necessities of his friends and adherents. King Charles II, during his banishment, would have shared the last pistole in his pocket with his little family. But I have known this gentleman, with two thousand louis-d’ors in his strong-box, pretend he was in great distress, and borrow money from a lady in Paris who was not in affluent circumstances. His most faithful servants, who had closely attended him in all his difficulties, were ill rewarded.’--King’s MEMOIRS.] We must receive, however, with some degree of jealousy what is said by Dr. King on this subject, recollecting that he had left at least, if he did not desert, the standard of the unfortunate prince, and was not therefore a person who was likely to form the fairest estimate of his virtues and faults. We must also remember that if the exiled prince gave little, he had but little to give, especially considering how late he nourished the scheme of another expedition to Scotland, for which he was long endeavouring to hoard money.  The case, also, of Charles Edward must be allowed to have been a difficult one. He had to satisfy numerous persons, who, having lost their all in his cause, had, with that all, seen the extinction of hopes which they accounted nearly as good as certainties; some of these were perhaps clamorous in their applications, and certainly ill pleased with their want of success. Other parts of the Chevalier’s conduct may have afforded grounds for charging him with coldness to the sufferings of his devoted followers. One of these was a sentiment which has nothing in it that is generous, but it was certainly a principle in which the young prince was trained, and which may be too probably denominated peculiar to his family, educated in all the high notions of passive obedience and non-resistance. If the unhappy prince gave implicit faith to the professions of statesmen holding such notions, which is implied by his whole conduct.

And why should this be so, Alan?
