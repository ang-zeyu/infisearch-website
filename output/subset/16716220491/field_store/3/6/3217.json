[Illustration]  [Illustration]     YOUNG NIGHT-THOUGHT       All night long and every night,     When my mama puts out the light,     I see the people marching by,     As plain as day, before my eye.      Armies and emperors and kings,     All carrying different kinds of things,     And marching in so grand a way,     You never saw the like by day.      So fine a show was never seen     At the great circus on the green;     For every kind of beast and man     Is marching in that caravan.      At first they move a little slow,     But still the faster on they go,     And still beside them close I keep     Until we reach the town of Sleep.  [Illustration]     WHOLE DUTY OF CHILDREN       A child should always say what's true     And speak when he is spoken to,     And behave mannerly at table;     At least as far as he is able.     RAIN       The rain is raining all around,       It falls on field and tree,     It rains on the umbrellas here,       And on the ships at sea.  [Illustration]  [Illustration]     PIRATE STORY       Three of us afloat in the meadow by the swing,       Three of us aboard in the basket on the lea.     Winds are in the air, they are blowing in the spring,       And waves are on the meadow like the waves there are at sea.      Where shall we adventure, to-day that we're afloat,       Wary of the weather and steering by a star?     Shall it be to Africa, a-steering of the boat,       To Providence, or Babylon, or off to Malabar?      Hi! but here's a squadron a-rowing on the sea--       Cattle on the meadow a-charging with a roar!     Quick, and we'll escape them, they're as mad as they can be,       The wicket is the harbour and the garden is the shore.     FOREIGN LANDS       Up into the cherry tree     Who should climb but little me?     I held the trunk with both my hands     And looked abroad on foreign lands.      I saw the next door garden lie,     Adorned with flowers, before my eye,     And many pleasant places more     That I had never seen before.      I saw the dimpling river pass     And be the sky's blue looking-glass;     The dusty roads go up and down     With people tramping in to town.      If I could find a higher tree     Farther and farther I should see,     To where the grown-up river slips     Into the sea among the ships,      To where the roads on either hand     Lead onward into fairy land,     Where all the children dine at five,     And all the playthings come alive.  [Illustration]  [Illustration]     WINDY NIGHTS       Whenever the moon and stars are set,       Whenever the wind is high,     All night long in the dark and wet,       A man goes riding by.     Late in the night when the fires are out,     Why does he gallop and gallop about?      Whenever the trees are crying aloud,       And ships are tossed at sea,     By, on the highway, low and loud,       By at the gallop goes he.     By at the gallop he goes, and then     By he comes back at the gallop again.  [Illustration]  [Illustration: FOREIGN LANDS]     TRAVEL       I should like to rise and go     Where the golden apples grow;--     Where below another sky     Parrot islands anchored lie,     And, watched by cockatoos and goats,     Lonely Crusoes building boats;--     Where in sunshine reaching out     Eastern cities, miles about,     Are with mosque and minaret     Among sandy gardens set,     And the rich goods from near and far     Hang for sale in the bazaar;--     Where the Great Wall round China goes,     And on one side the desert blows,     And with bell and voice and drum,     Cities on the other hum;--     Where are forests, hot as fire,     Wide as England, tall as a spire,     Full of apes and cocoa-nuts     And the negro hunters' huts;--     Where the knotty crocodile     Lies and blinks in the Nile,     And the red flamingo flies     Hunting fish before his eyes;--     Where in jungles, near and far,     Man-devouring tigers are,     Lying close and giving ear     Lest the hunt be drawing near,  [Illustration]      Or a comer-by be seen     Swinging in a palanquin;--     Where among the desert sands     Some deserted city stands,     All its children, sweep and prince,     Grown to manhood ages since,     Not a foot in street or house,     Not a stir of child or mouse,     And when kindly falls the night,     In all the town no spark of light.     There I'll come when I'm a man     With a camel caravan;     Light a fire in the gloom     Of some dusty dining-room;     See the pictures on the walls,     Heroes, fights, and festivals;     And in a corner find the toys     Of the old Egyptian boys.  [Illustration]     SINGING       Of speckled eggs the birdie sings       And nests among the trees;     The sailor sings of ropes and things       In ships upon the seas.      The children sing in far Japan,       The children sing in Spain;     The organ with the organ man       Is singing in the rain.  [Illustration]     LOOKING FORWARD       When I am grown to man's estate     I shall be very proud and great,     And tell the other girls and boys     Not to meddle with my toys.     A GOOD PLAY       We built a ship upon the stairs     All made of the back-bedroom chairs,     And filled it full of sofa pillows     To go a-sailing on the billows.      We took a saw and several nails,     And water in the nursery pails;     And Tom said, \"Let us also take     An apple and a slice of cake;\"--     Which was enough for Tom and me     To go a-sailing on, till tea.      We sailed along for days and days     And had the very best of plays;     But Tom fell out and hurt his knee,     So there was no one left but me.  [Illustration]  [Illustration]     WHERE GO THE BOATS?       Dark brown is the river,       Golden is the sand.     It flows along for ever,       With trees on either hand.      Green leaves a-floating,       Castles of the foam,     Boats of mine a-boating--       Where will all come home?      On goes the river       And out past the mill,     Away down the valley,       Away down the hill.      Away down the river,       A hundred miles or more,     Other little children       Shall bring my boats ashore.  [Illustration]     AUNTIE'S SKIRTS       Whenever Auntie moves around,     Her dresses make a curious sound,     They trail behind her up the floor,     And trundle after through the door.  [Illustration]     THE LAND OF COUNTERPANE       When I was sick and lay a-bed,     I had two pillows at my head,     And all my toys beside me lay     To keep me happy all the day.      And sometimes for an hour or so     I watched my leaden soldiers go,     With different uniforms and drills,     Among the bed-clothes, through the hills;      And sometimes sent my ships in fleets     All up and down among the sheets;     Or brought my trees and houses out,     And planted cities all about.      I was the giant great and still     That sits upon the pillow-hill,     And sees before him, dale and plain,     The pleasant land of counterpane.  [Illustration: THE LAND OF COUNTERPANE]     THE LAND OF NOD       From breakfast on through all the day     At home among my friends I stay,     But every night I go abroad     Afar into the land of Nod.      All by myself I have to go,     With none to tell me what to do--     All alone beside the streams     And up the mountain-sides of dreams.      The strangest things are there for me,     Both things to eat and things to see,     And many frightening sights abroad     Till morning in the land of Nod.      Try as I like to find the way,     I never can get back by day,     Nor can remember plain and clear     The curious music that I hear.  [Illustration]  [Illustration]     MY SHADOW       I have a little shadow that goes in and out with me,     And what can be the use of him is more than I can see.     He is very, very like me from the heels up to the head;     And I see him jump before me, when I jump into my bed.      The funniest thing about him is the way he likes to grow--     Not at all like proper children, which is always very slow;     For he sometimes shoots up taller like an india-rubber ball,     And he sometimes gets so little that there's none of him at all.      He hasn't got a notion of how children ought to play,     And can only make a fool of me in every sort of way.     He stays so close beside me, he's a coward you can see;     I'd think shame to stick to nursie as that shadow sticks to me!  [Illustration: MY SHADOW]      One morning, very early, before the sun was up,     I rose and found the shining dew on every buttercup;     But my lazy little shadow, like an arrant sleepy-head,     Had stayed at home behind me and was fast asleep in bed.  [Illustration]     SYSTEM       Every night my prayers I say,     And get my dinner every day;     And every day that I've been good,     I get an orange after food.      The child that is not clean and neat,     With lots of toys and things to eat,     He is a naughty child, I'm sure--     Or else his dear papa is poor.  [Illustration]     A GOOD BOY       I woke before the morning, I was happy all the day,     I never said an ugly word, but smiled and stuck to play.      And now at last the sun is going down behind the wood,     And I am very happy, for I know that I've been good.      My bed is waiting cool and fresh, with linen smooth and fair     And I must be off to sleepsin-by, and not forget my prayer.      I know that, till to-morrow I shall see the sun arise,     No ugly dream shall fright my mind, no ugly sight my eyes.      But slumber hold me tightly till I waken in the dawn,     And hear the thrushes singing in the lilacs round the lawn.     ESCAPE AT BEDTIME       The lights from the parlour and kitchen shone out       Through the blinds and the windows and bars;     And high overhead and all moving about,       There were thousands of millions of stars.     There ne'er were such thousands"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25609"],["title","A Child's Garden of Verses (#2)"],["body","leaves on a tree,       Nor of people in church or the Park,     As the crowds of the stars that looked down upon me,       And that glittered and winked in the dark.      The Dog, and the Plough, and the Hunter, and all,       And the star of the sailor, and Mars,     These shone in the sky, and the pail by the wall       Would be half full of water and stars.      They saw me at last, and they chased me with cries,       And they soon had me packed into bed;     But the glory kept shining and bright in my eyes,       And the stars going round in my head.  [Illustration]  [Illustration]     MARCHING SONG       Bring the comb and play upon it!       Marching, here we come!     Willie cocks his highland bonnet,       Johnnie beats the drum.      Mary Jane commands the party,       Peter leads the rear;     Feet in time, alert and hearty,       Each a Grenadier!      All in the most martial manner       Marching double-quick;     While the napkin, like a banner,       Waves upon the stick!      Here's enough of fame and pillage,       Great commander Jane!     Now that we've been round the village,       Let's go home again.  [Illustration]     THE COW       The friendly cow all red and white,       I love with all my heart:     She gives me cream with all her might,       To eat with apple-tart.      She wanders lowing here and there,       And yet she cannot stray,     All in the pleasant open air,       The pleasant light of day;      And blown by all the winds that pass       And wet with all the showers,     She walks among the meadow grass       And eats the meadow flowers.  [Illustration]  [Illustration]     HAPPY THOUGHT       The world is so full of a number of things,     I'm sure we should all be as happy as kings.     THE WIND       I saw you toss the kites on high     And blow the birds about the sky;     And all around I heard you pass,     Like ladies' skirts across the grass--       O wind, a-blowing all day long,       O wind, that sings so loud a song!      I saw the different things you did,     But always you yourself you hid.     I felt you push, I heard you call,     I could not see yourself at all--       O wind, a-blowing all day long,       O wind, that sings so loud a song!      O you that are so strong and cold,     O blower, are you young or old?     Are you a beast of field and tree,     Or just a stronger child than me?       O wind, a-blowing all day long,       O wind, that sings so loud a song!  [Illustration]     KEEPSAKE MILL       Over the borders, a sin without pardon,       Breaking the branches and crawling below,     Out through the breach in the wall of the garden,       Down by the banks of the river, we go.      Here is the mill with the humming of thunder,       Here is the weir with the wonder of foam,     Here is the sluice with the race running under--       Marvellous places, though handy to home!      Sounds of the village grow stiller and stiller,       Stiller the note of the birds on the hill;     Dusty and dim are the eyes of the miller,       Deaf are his ears with the moil of the mill.      Years may go by, and the wheel in the river       Wheel as it wheels for us, children, to-day,     Wheel and keep roaring and foaming for ever       Long after all of the boys are away.      Home from the Indies and home from the ocean,       Heroes and soldiers we all shall come home;     Still we shall find the old mill wheel in motion,       Turning and churning that river to foam.      You with the bean that I gave when we quarrelled,       I with your marble of Saturday last,     Honoured and old and all gaily apparelled,       Here we shall meet and remember the past.  [Illustration]  [Illustration]     GOOD AND BAD CHILDREN       Children, you are very little,     And your bones are very brittle;     If you would grow great and stately,     You must try to walk sedately.      You must still be bright and quiet,     And content with simple diet;     And remain, through all bewild'ring,     Innocent and honest children.      Happy hearts and happy faces,     Happy play in grassy places--     That was how, in ancient ages,     Children grew to kings and sages.      But the unkind and the unruly,     And the sort who eat unduly,     They must never hope for glory--     Theirs is quite a different story!      Cruel children, crying babies,     All grew up as geese and gabies,     Hated, as their age increases,     By their nephews and their nieces.  [Illustration]     FOREIGN CHILDREN       Little Indian, Sioux or Crow,     Little frosty Eskimo,     Little Turk or Japanee,     Oh! don't you wish that you were me?      You have seen the scarlet trees     And the lions over seas;     You have eaten ostrich eggs,     And turned the turtles off their legs.      Such a life is very fine,     But it's not so nice as mine:     You must often, as you trod,     Have wearied _not_ to be abroad.      You have curious things to eat,     I am fed on proper meat;     You must dwell beyond the foam,     But I am safe and live at home.       Little Indian, Sioux or Crow,       Little frosty Eskimo,       Little Turk or Japanee,     Oh! don't you wish that you were me?  [Illustration: FOREIGN CHILDREN]  [Illustration]     THE SUN TRAVELS       The sun is not a-bed, when I     At night upon my pillow lie;     Still round the earth his way he takes,     And morning after morning makes.      While here at home, in shining day,     We round the sunny garden play,     Each little Indian sleepy-head     Is being kissed and put to bed.      And when at eve I rise from tea,     Day dawns beyond the Atlantic Sea;     And all the children in the West     Are getting up and being dressed.     THE LAMPLIGHTER       My tea is nearly ready and the sun has left the sky.     It's time to take the window to see Leerie going by;     For every night at teatime and before you take your seat,     With lantern and with ladder he comes posting up the street.      Now Tom would be a driver and Maria go to sea,     And my papa's a banker and as rich as he can be;     But I, when I am stronger and can choose what I'm to do,     O Leerie, I'll go round at night and light the lamps with you!      For we are very lucky, with a lamp before the door,     And Leerie stops to light it as he lights so many more;     And oh! before you hurry by with ladder and with light;     O Leerie, see a little child and nod to him tonight!  [Illustration]  [Illustration]     MY BED IS A BOAT       My bed is like a little boat;       Nurse helps me in when I embark;     She girds me in my sailor's coat       And starts me in the dark.      At night, I go on board and say       Good-night to all my friends on shore;     I shut my eyes and sail away       And see and hear no more.      And sometimes things to bed I take,       As prudent sailors have to do;     Perhaps a slice of wedding-cake,       Perhaps a toy or two.      All night across the dark we steer;       But when the day returns at last,     Safe in my room, beside the pier,       I find my vessel fast.  [Illustration]     THE MOON       The moon has a face like the clock in the hall;     She shines on thieves on the garden wall,     On streets and field and harbour quays,     And birdies asleep in the forks of the trees.      The squalling cat and the squeaking mouse,     The howling dog by the door of the house,     The bat that lies in bed at noon,     All love to be out by the light of the moon.      But all of the things that belong to the day     Cuddle to sleep to be out of her way;     And flowers and children close their eyes     Till up in the morning the sun shall arise.  [Illustration]  [Illustration]     THE SWING       How do you like to go up in a swing,       Up in the air so blue?     Oh, I do think it the pleasantest thing       Ever a child can do!      Up in the air and over the wall,       Till I can see so wide,     Rivers and trees and cattle and all       Over the countryside--      Till I look down on the garden green,       Down on the roof so brown--     Up in the air I go flying again,       Up in the air and down!  [Illustration]     TIME TO RISE       A birdie with a yellow bill     Hopped upon the window sill,     Cocked his shining eye and said:     \"Ain't you 'shamed, you sleepy-head!\"  [Illustration]     LOOKING-GLASS RIVER       Smooth it glides upon its travel,       Here a wimple, there a gleam--         O the clean gravel!         O the smooth stream!      Sailing blossoms, silver fishes,       Paven pools as clear as air--         How a child wishes         To live down there!      We can see our coloured faces       Floating on the shaken pool         Down in cool places,         Dim and very cool;      Till a wind or water wrinkle,       Dipping marten, plumping trout,         Spreads in a twinkle         And blots all out.      See the rings pursue each other;       All below grows black as night,         Just as if mother         Had blown out the light!      Patience, children, just a minute--       See the spreading circles die;         The stream and all in it         Will clear by-and-by.     FAIRY BREAD       Come up here, O dusty feet!       Here is fairy bread to eat.     Here in my retiring room,       Children, you may dine     On the golden smell of broom       And the shade of pine;     And when you have eaten well,     Fairy stories hear and tell.  [Illustration]  [Illustration]     FROM A RAILWAY CARRIAGE       Faster than fairies, faster than witches,     Bridges and houses, hedges and ditches;     And charging along like troops in a battle     All through the meadows the horses and cattle:     All of the sights of the hill and the plain     Fly as thick as driving rain;     And ever again, in the wink of an eye,     Painted stations whistle by.     Here is a child who clambers and scrambles,     All by himself and gathering brambles;     Here is a tramp who stands and gazes;     And there is the green for"]]]
