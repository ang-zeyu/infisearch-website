He is young yet. He has abundant talents--quite enough to occupy all his time without devoting any to temper.  He is rising in military skill and usefulness. His recent appointment to the command of a corps, by one so competent to judge as General Sherman, proves this. In that line he can serve both the country and himself more profitably than he could as a member of Congress upon the floor.  The foregoing is what I would say if Frank Blair was my brother instead of yours.  Yours truly,   A. LINCOLN.     TO GOVERNOR BRADFORD.  EXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, November 2, 1863.  His EXCELLENCY A. W. BRADFORD, Governor of Maryland.  SIR:--Yours of the 31st ult. was received yesterday about noon, and since then I have been giving most earnest attention to the subject-matter of it. At my call General Schenck has attended, and he assures me it is almost certain that violence will be used at some of the voting places on election day unless prevented by his provost-guards. He says that at some of those places Union voters will not attend at all, or run a ticket, unless they have some assurance of protection. This makes the Missouri case, of my action in regard to which you express your approval.  The remaining point of your letter is a protest against any person offering to vote being put to any test not found in the laws of Maryland. This brings us to a difference between Missouri and Maryland. With the same reason in both States, Missouri has, by law, provided a test for the voter with reference to the present rebellion, while Maryland has not. For example, General Trimble, captured fighting us at Gettysburg, is, without recanting his treason, a legal voter by the laws of Maryland. Even General Schenck's order admits him to vote, if he recants upon oath. I think that is cheap enough. My order in Missouri, which you approve, and General Scherick's order here, reach precisely the same end. Bach assures the right of voting to all loyal men, and whether a man is loyal, each allows that man to fix by his own oath. Your suggestion that nearly all the candidates are loyal, I do not think quite meets the case. In this struggle for the nation's life, I cannot so confidently rely on those whose elections may have depended upon disloyal votes. Such men, when elected, may prove true; but such votes are given them in the expectation that they will prove false.  Nor do I think that to keep the peace at the polls, and to prevent the persistently disloyal from voting, constitutes just cause of offense to Maryland. I think she has her own example for it. If I mistake not, it is precisely what General Dix did when your Excellency was elected Governor.  I revoke the first of the three propositions in General Schenek's General Order No. 53; not that it is wrong in principle, but because the military, being of necessity exclusive judges as to who shall be arrested, the provision is too liable to abuse. For the revoked part I substitute the following:  That, all provost-marshals and other military officers do prevent all disturbance and violence at or about the polls, whether offered by such persons as above described, or by any other person or persons whomsoever.  The other two propositions of the order I allow to stand. General Schenek is fully determined, and has my strict orders besides, that all loyal men may vote, and vote for whom they please.  Your obedient servant,   A. LINCOLN.     TO J. H. HACKETT  [Private.]  EXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, November 2, 1863.  JAMES H. HACKETT.  MY DEAR SIR:--Yours of October 22d is received, as also was, in due course, that of October 3d. I look forward with pleasure to the fulfillment of the promise made in the former to visit Washington the following winter and to \"call.\"  Give yourself no uneasiness on the subject mentioned in that of the 22d. My note to you I certainly did not expect to see in print, yet I have not been much shocked by the newspaper comments upon it.  Those comments constitute a fair specimen of what has occurred to me through life. I have endured a great deal of ridicule, without much malice; and have received a great deal of kindness not quite free from ridicule. I am used to it.      TELEGRAM TO W. H. SEWARD.  WAR DEPARTMENT, WASHINGTON CITY, November 3, 1863.  HON. W. H. SEWARD, Auburn, N. Y.:  Nothing new. Dispatches up to 12 last night from Chattanooga show all quiet and doing well. How is your son?   A. LINCOLN.     TELEGRAM TO GENERAL MEADE EXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, November 3, 1863.  MAJOR-GENERAL MEADE, Army of Potomac:  Samuel Wellers, private in Company B, Forty-ninth Pennsylvania Volunteers, writes that he is to be shot for desertion on the 6th instant. His own story is rather a bad one, and yet he tells it so frankly, that I am somewhat interested in him. Has he been a good soldier except the desertion? About how old is he?   A. LINCOLN.     TELEGRAM TO GENERAL MEADE.  EXECUTIVE, MANSION WASHINGTON, D. C., November 5, 1863.  MAJOR-GENERAL MEADE, Army of Potomac:  Please suspend the execution of Samuel Wellers, Forty-ninth Pennsylvania Volunteers, until further orders.   A. LINCOLN.     TELEGRAM TO GENERAL A. E. BURNSIDE. WAR DEPARTMENT, WASHINGTON, November 9, 1863.4 P.M.  MAJOR-GENERAL BURNSIDE, Knoxville, Tenn.:  Have seen dispatch from General Grant about your loss at Rogersville. Per contra, about the same time, Averell and Duffle got considerable advantage of the enemy at and about Lewisburg, Virginia: and on Saturday, the seventh, Meade drove the enemy from Rappahannock Station and Kelly's Ford, capturing eight battle-flags, four guns, and over 1800 prisoners, with very little loss to himself. Let me hear from you.   A. LINCOLN.     TELEGRAM TO GENERAL G. G. MEADE.  WASHINGTON, November 9, 1863 7.30 P.M.  MAJOR-GENERAL MEADE:  I have seen your dispatches about operations on the Rappahannock on Saturday, and I wish to say, \"Well done!\" Do the 1500 prisoners reported by General Sedgwick include the 400 taken by General French, or do the Whole amount to 1900?   A. LINCOLN.     ORDER CONCERNING THE EXPORT OF TOBACCO PURCHASED BY FOREIGN NATIONS.  EXECUTIVE MANSION,  WASHINGTON, November 10, 1863.  In consideration of the peculiar circumstances and pursuant to the comity deemed to be due to friendly powers, any tobacco in the United States belonging to the government either of France, Austria, or any other state with which this country is at peace, and which tobacco was purchased and paid for by such government prior to the 4th day of March, 1861, may be exported from any port of the United States under the supervision and upon the responsibility of naval officers of such governments and in conformity to such regulations as may be presented by the Secretary of State of the United States, and not otherwise.   A. LINCOLN.     TELEGRAM TO GENERAL SCHOFIELD.  WAR DEPARTMENT, WASHINGTON, D. C., November 10, 1863.  GENERAL SCHOFIELD, Saint Louis, Mo.:   I see a dispatch here from Saint Louis, which is a little difficult for me to understand. It says \"General Schofield has refused leave of absence to members in military service to attend the legislature. All such are radical and administration men. The election of two Senators from this place on Thursday will probably turn upon this thing.\" what does this mean? Of course members of the legislation must be allowed to attend its sessions. But how is there a session before the recent election returns are in? And how is it to be at \"this place\"--and that is Saint Louis? Please inform me.   A. LINCOLN.     TELEGRAM TO GENERAL SCHOFIELD.  WAR DEPARTMENT, WASHINGTON, D. C., November 11, 1863.  GENERAL SCHOFIELD, Saint Louis, Mo.:  I believe the Secretary of War has telegraphed you about members of the legislation. At all events, allow those in the service to attend the session, and we can afterward decide whether they can stay through the entire session.   A. LINCOLN.     TELEGRAM TO HIRAM BARNEY.     [Cipher.]  EXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, D. C., November 11, 1863.  HON. HIRAM BARNEY, New York; I would like an interview with you. Can you not come?   A. LINCOLN.     TELEGRAM TO J. MILDERBORGER.  EXECUTIVE MANSION,  WASHINGTON, D. C., November 11, 1863.  JOHN MILDERBORGER, Peru, Ind.:  I cannot comprehend the object of your dispatch. I do not often decline seeing people who call upon me, and probably will see you if you call.   A. LINCOLN.     TELEGRAM to E. H. AND E. JAMESON.  WAR DEPARTMENT,  WASHINGTON, D. C., November 13, 1863.  E. H. and E. JAMESON, Jefferson City, Mo.:  Yours saying Brown and Henderson are elected Senators is received. I understand this is one and one. If so it is knocking heads together to some.   A. LINCOLN.     TELEGRAM TO GENERAL W. S. ROSECRANS.  WAR DEPARTMENT, WASHINGTON, November 14, 1863. 12.15 P.M.  MAJOR-GENERAL ROSECRANS, Cincinnati, Ohio:  I have received and considered your dispatch of yesterday. Of the reports you mention, I have not the means of seeing any except your own. Besides this, the publication might be improper in view of the court of inquiry which has been ordered. With every disposition, not merely to do justice, but to oblige you, I feel constrained to say I think the publications better not be made now.   A. LINCOLN.     TELEGRAM TO GENERAL BURNSIDE.  WAR DEPARTMENT, WASHINGTON CITY, November 16, 1863.  MAJOR-GENERAL BURNSIDE, Knoxville, Tenn.:  What is the news?   A. LINCOLN.     TO SECRETARY CHASE  EXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, November 17, 1863.  HON. SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY.  MY DEAR SIR:--I expected to see you here at Cabinet meeting, and to say something about going to Gettysburg. There will be a train to take and return us. The time for starting is not yet fixed, but when it shall be I will notify you.  Yours truly,   A. LINCOLN.     ADDRESS AT GETTYSBURG  NOVEMBER 19, 1863.  Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent, a new nation,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2659"],["title","The Papers and Writings of Abraham Lincoln — Volume 7: 1863-1865 (#2)"],["body","in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.  Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation or any nation so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure. We are met on a great battle-field of that war. We have come to dedicate a portion of that field, as a final resting place for those who here gave their lives that that nation might live. It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this.  But, in a larger sense, we can not dedicate--we can not consecrate--we can not hallow--this ground. The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power to add or detract. The world will little note, nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here. It is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced. It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us--that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain--that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom--and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.     TELEGRAM TO GENERAL MEADE.  EXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, D. C., November 20, 1863.  MAJOR-GENERAL MEADE, Army of Potomac:  If there is a man by the name of King under sentence to be shot, please suspend execution till further order, and send record.   A. LINCOLN.     TELEGRAM TO GENERAL MEADE.  EXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON. November 20, 1863.  MAJOR-GENERAL MEADE, Army of Potomac:  An intelligent woman in deep distress, called this morning, saying her husband, a lieutenant in the Army of Potomac, was to be shot next Monday for desertion, and putting a letter in my hand, upon which I relied for particulars, she left without mentioning a name or other particular by which to identify the case. On opening the letter I found it equally vague, having nothing to identify by, except her own signature, which seems to be \"Mrs. Anna S. King.\" I could not again find her. If you have a case which you shall think is probably the one intended, please apply my dispatch of this morning to it.   A. LINCOLN.     TELEGRAM TO E. P. EVANS.  EXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, D. C., November 23, 1863.  E. P. EVANS, West Union, Adams County, Ohio:  Yours to Governor Chase in behalf of John A Welch is before me. Can there be a worse case than to desert and with letters persuading others to desert? I cannot interpose without a better showing than you make. When did he desert? when did he write the letters?   A. LINCOLN.     TO SECRETARY SEWARD.  EXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, D. C., November 23, 1863.  MY DEAR SIR:--Two despatches since I saw you; one not quite so late on firing as we had before, but giving the points that Burnside thinks he can hold the place, that he is not closely invested, and that he forages across the river. The other brings the firing up to 11 A.M. yesterday, being twenty-three hours later than we had before.  Yours truly,   A. LINCOLN.     TELEGRAM TO GENERAL GRANT.  WASHINGTON, November 25, 1863. 8.40 A.M.  MAJOR-GENERAL U.S. GRANT:  Your despatches as to fighting on Monday and Tuesday are here. Well done! Many thanks to all. Remember Burnside.   A. LINCOLN.     TO C. P. KIRKLAND.  EXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, December 7, 1863.  CHARLES P. KIRKLAND, ESQ., New York:  I have just received and have read your published letter to the HON. Benjamin R. Curtis. Under the circumstances I may not be the most competent judge, but it appears to me to be a paper of great ability, and for the country's sake more than for my own I thank you for it.  Yours very truly,   A. LINCOLN.     ANNOUNCEMENT OF UNION SUCCESS IN EAST TENNESSEE.  EXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, D. C., December 7, 1863.  Reliable information being received that the insurgent force is retreating from East Tennessee, under circumstances rendering it probable that the Union forces cannot hereafter be dislodged from that important position; and esteeming this to be of high national consequence, I recommend that all loyal people do, on receipt of this information, assemble at their places of worship, and render special homage and gratitude to Almighty God for this great advancement of the national cause.   A. LINCOLN.     PROCLAMATION OF AMNESTY AND RECONSTRUCTION. DECEMBER 8, 1863.  BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA:  A Proclamation.  Whereas in and by the Constitution of the United States it is provided that the President \"shall have power to grant reprieves and pardons for offenses against the United States, except in cases of impeachment;\" and,  Whereas a rebellion now exists whereby the loyal State governments of several States have for a long time been subverted, and many persons have committed and are now guilty of treason against the United States; and  Whereas, with reference to said rebellion and treason, laws have been enacted by Congress declaring forfeitures and confiscation of property and liberation of slaves, all upon terms and conditions therein stated, and also declaring that the President was thereby authorized at any time thereafter, by proclamation, to extend to persons who may have participated in the existing rebellion in any State or part thereof pardon and amnesty, with such exceptions and at such times and on such conditions as he may deem expedient for the public welfare; and  Whereas the Congressional declaration for limited and conditional pardon accords with well-established judicial exposition of the pardoning power; and  Whereas, with reference to said rebellion, the President of the United States has issued several proclamations with provisions in regard to the liberation of slaves; and  Whereas it is now desired by some persons heretofore engaged in said rebellion to resume their allegiance to the United States and to reinaugurate loyal State governments within and for their respective States:  Therefore, I, Abraham Lincoln, President of the United States, do proclaim, declare, and make known to all persons who have, directly or by implication, participated in the existing rebellion, except as hereinafter excepted, that a full pardon is hereby granted to them and each of them, with restoration of all rights of property, except as to slaves and in property cases where rights of third parties shall have intervened, and upon the condition that every such person shall take and subscribe an oath and thenceforward keep and maintain said oath inviolate, and which oath shall be registered for permanent preservation and shall be of the tenor and effect following, to wit:  \"I, ------, do solemnly swear, in presence of Almighty God, that I will henceforth faithfully support, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States and the Union of the States thereunder; and that I will in like manner abide by and faithfully support all acts of Congress passed during the existing rebellion with reference to slaves, so long and so far as not repealed, modified, or held void by Congress or by decision of the Supreme Court; and that I will in like manner abide by and faithfully support all proclamations of the President made during the existing rebellion having reference to slaves, so long and so far as not modified or declared void by decision of the Supreme Court. So help me God.\"  The persons excepted from the benefits of the foregoing provisions are all who are or shall have been civil or diplomatic officers or agents of the so-called Confederate Government; all who have left judicial stations under the United States to aid the rebellion; all who are or shall have been military or naval officers of said so-called Confederate Government above the rank of colonel in the army or of lieutenant in the navy; all who left seats in the United States Congress to aid the rebellion; all who resigned commissions in the Army or Navy of the United States and afterwards aided the rebellion; and all who have engaged in any way in treating colored persons, or white persons in charge of such, otherwise than lawfully as prisoners of war, and which persons may have been found in the United States service as soldiers, seamen, or in any other capacity.  And I do further proclaim, declare, and make known that whenever, in any of the States of Arkansas, Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Tennessee, Alabama, Georgia, Florida, South Carolina, and North Carolina, a number of persons, not less than one-tenth in number of the votes cast in such State at the Presidential election of the year A.D. 1860, each having taken oath aforesaid, and not having since violated it, and being a qualified voter by the election law of the State existing immediately before the so-called act of secession, and excluding all others, shall reestablish a State government which shall be republican and in nowise contravening said oath, such shall be recognized as the true government of the State, and the State shall receive thereunder the benefits of the constitutional provision which declares that \"the United States shall guarantee to every State in this Union a republican form of government and shall protect each of them against invasion, and, on application of the legislature, or the EXECUTIVE (when the legislature can not be convened), against domestic violence.\"  And I do further proclaim, declare, and make known that any provision which may be adopted by such State government in relation to the freed people of such State which shall recognize and declare their permanent freedom, provide for their education, and which may yet be consistent as a temporary arrangement with their present condition as a laboring, landless, and homeless class, will not be objected to by the National EXECUTIVE.  And it is suggested as not improper that"]]]
