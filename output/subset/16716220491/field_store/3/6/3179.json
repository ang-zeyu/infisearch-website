Love should mate with trusts;      He leaves me!       STRAT.      Lady, 'tis because he must!      He loves thee with a love will never die,      Then, if he leave thee, reason not the why:      Give him thy trust! Oh, thou shalt have reward,      For thee he hides the secret! Let him guard      Thy life beloved--in fullest liberty.      The wife who wholly trusts alone is free!      One heart for thee and him--one purpose sure,      Yet this heart beats to dare--and to endure.      The wife's true heart must o'er the peril sigh      Which meets his heart moved but to purpose high;      Thy pain his pain, but not his terror thine:      He is Armenian, thou of Roman line.      We, of Armenia, mock thy dreams to scorn,      For they are born of night, as truth of morn;      While Romans hold that dreams are heaven-sent,      And spring from Jove for man's admonishment.       PAUL.      Though this thy faith--if thou my dream shouldst hear--      My grief must needs be thine, thy fear my fear,      And, that the horror thou may'st fully prove,      Know that I--his dear wife--did once another love!      Nay, start not, shrink not, 'tis no tale of shame,      For though in other years the heavenly flame      Descended, kindled, scorched--it left me pure      With courage to resign--with strength to endure.      He touched my heart, but never stained the soul      That gained this hardest conquest--self-control.      At Rome--where I was born--a soldier's eye      Marked this poor face, from which must Polyeucte fly;      Severus was his name:--Ah! memory      May spare love linked with death a tear, a sigh!       STRAT.      Say, is it he who, at the risk of life,      Saved Decius from his foes and endless strife?      Who, dying, dealt to Persia stroke of death,      And shouted 'Victory!' with his latest breath?      His whitening bones, amid the nameless brave,      Lie still unfound, unknown, without a grave;      Unburied lies his dust amid the slain,      While Decius rears an empty urn in vain!       PAUL.      Alas! 'tis he; all Rome attests his worth,      Hide not his memory, kindly Mother Earth!      'Tis but his memory that I adore      The past is past--and I can say no more.      All gifts save one had he--yes, Fortune held her hand,      And I, as Fortune's slave, obeyed my sire's command.       STRAT.      Ah! I must wish that love the day had won!       PAUL.      Which duty lost--then had I been undone;      Though duty gave, yet duty healed, my pain;      Yet say not that my love was weak or vain!      Our tears fell fast, yet ne'er bore our distress      The fatal fruit of strife and bitterness.      Then, then, I left my hero, hope and Rome,      And, far from him, I found another home;      While he, in his despair, sought sure relief      In death, the only end to life's long grief!      You know the rest:--you know that Polyeucte's eye      Was caught,--his fancy pleased; his wife am I.      Once more by counsel of my father led,      To Armenia's greatest noble am I wed;      Ambition, prudence, policy his guide      Yet only duty made Pauline his bride;      Love might have bound me to Severus' heart,      Had duty not enforced a sterner part.      Yes, let these fears attest, all trembling for his life,      That I am his for aye--his faithful, loving wife.       STRAT.      Thy new love true and tender as the old:--      But this thy dream? No more thy tale withhold!       PAUL.      Last night I saw Severus: but his eye      With anger blazed; his port was proud and high,      No suppliant he--no feeble, formless shade,      With dim, averted eye; no sword had made      My hero lifeless ghost. Nor wound, nor scar      Marked death his only conqueror in war.      Nor spoil of death, nor memory's child was he,      His mien triumphant, full of majesty!      So might victorious Caesar near his home      To claim the key to every heart in Rome!      He spoke: in nameless awe I heard his voice,--      'Give love, that is my due, to him--thy choice,--      But know, oh faithless one, ere day expires,      All vain these tears for him thy heart desires!'      Anon a Christian band (an impious horde),      With shameful cross in hand, attest his word;      They vouch Severus' truth--and, to complete      My doom, hurl Polyeucte beneath his feet!      I cried, 'O father, timely succour bear!'      He heard, he came, my grief was now despair!      He drew his dagger--plunged it in the breast      Of him, my husband, late his honoured guest!      Relief came but from agony supreme--      I shrieked--I writhed--I woke--it was a dream!      And yet my dream is true!       STRAT.      'Tis true your dream is sad,      But now you are awake, 'tis but a dream you had!      For horror's prey in darkness of the night      Is but our reason's sport in morning light.      How can you dread a shade? How a fond father fear,      Who as a son regards the man you hold so dear?      To phantom of the night no credence yield;      For him and you he chose thy strength and shield.       PAUL.      You say _his_ words: at all my fears he smiles,      But I must dread these Christians and their wiles!      I dread their vengeance, wreaked upon my lord,      For Christian blood my father has outpoured!       STRAT.      Their sect is impious, mad, absurd and vain,      Their rites repulsive, as their cult profane.      Deride their altar, their weak frenzy ban,      Yet do they war with gods and not with man!      Relentless wills our law that they must die:      Their joy--endurance; death--their ecstasy;      Judged--by decree, the foes of human race,      Meekly their heads they bow--to court disgrace!       PAUL.      My father comes--oh, peace!       (Enter Felix and Albin)       FELIX.      Nay, peace is flown!      Thy dream begets dull fears, till now unknown;      In part this dream is true, and for the rest----       PAUL.      By what new fear, say, is thy heart opprest?       FELIX.      Severus lives!       PAUL.      Ah! this no cause for fear!       FELIX.      At Decius' court, he, held in honour dear,      Risked life to save his Emperor from his foes,      'Tis to his saviour Decius honour shows!       PAUL.      Thus fickle Fortune bows her head to fate,      And pays the honour due, though all too late!       FELIX.      He comes! Is near----       PAUL.      The gods----       FELIX.      Do all things well.       PAUL.      My dream fulfilled! But how? O father, tell!       FELIX.      Let Albin speak, who saw him face to face      With tribe of courtiers; all to him give place;      Unscathed in battle, all extol his fame,      Unstained, undimmed, his glory, life and name!       ALBIN.      You know the issue of that glorious fight:      The crowning glory his--who, in despite      Of danger sore to life and liberty,      Became a slave to set his Emperor free:      Rome gave her honours to Severus' shade,      Whilst he, her ransomer, in a dungeon stayed.      His death they mourned above ten thousand slain,      While Persia held him--yes, their tears were vain,      But not in vain his noble sacrifice!      The king released him: Rome grudged not the price;      No Persian bribe could tempt him from his home.      When Decius cried--'Fight once again for Rome!'      Again he fights--he leads--all others hope resign;      But from despair's deep breast he plucks a star benign,      This--hope's fair fruit, contentment, plenty, ease,      Brings joy from grief, to crown a lasting peace.      The Emperor holds him as his dearest friend,      And doth Severus to Armenia send--      To offer up to Mars, and mighty Jove,      'Mid feast and sacrifice, his thanks and love.       FELIX.      Ah, Fortune, turn thy wheel, else I misfortune meet!       ALBIN.      This news I learn'd from one of great Severus' suite:      Thence, swiftly here, the tale to tell I sped.       FELIX.      He who once vainly wooed, hopes now to wed.      The sacrifice, the offering, all are feigned,      All but the suit, which lightly I disdained.       PAUL.      Yes, this may be, for ah! he loved me well!       FELIX.      What room for hope? Such wrath is child of hell.      Before his righteous ire I shrink, I cower;      Revenge I dread--and vengeance linked with power      Unnerves me quite.       PAUL.      Fear not, his soul is great.       FELIX.      Thy comfort, oh my daughter, comes too late.      The thought to crush me down, to turn my heart to stone,      This, that I prized not worth for worth's dear sake alone!      Too well, Pauline, thou hast thy sire obeyed;      Thy heart was fond, but duty love betrayed.      How surely thy revolt had safety won!      'Tis thine obedience leaves us all undone.      In thee, in thee alone, one hope remains,      Love held him fast, relax not thou love's chains.      O Love, my sometime foe, forgive, be mine ally,      And let the dart that slew now bring the remedy!       PAUL.      Forbid it, Heaven! One good yet mine,--_my will_,      The dart that wounded has the power to kill.      One lesson woman learns--her feebleness;      Shame is the only grief without redress.      The traitor heart shall still a prisoner be;      For freedom were disgrace to thee and me!      _I will not_ see him!       FELIX.      But one word! Be kind!       PAUL.      I will not, for I love!--and love is blind.      Before his kingly eye my soul to unveil      Were shame and failure: and I will not fail:      _I will not_ see him!       FELIX.      One word more--'Obey!'      Wouldst thou thy father and his weal betray?       PAUL.      I yield! Come woe!--come shame!--come every ill!      My father thou!--and I thy daughter still!       FELIX.      I know thee pure.       PAUL.      And pure I will remain,      But, crushed and bruised, the flower no guilt shall stain.

Here, dearest friend, my foe!      Yet will I arm me! Father, I would go      To steel my heart--all weapons to embrace!       FELIX.      I too will go, the conqueror's march to grace!      Restore thy strength, ere yet it be too late,      And know that in thy hands thou hold'st our fate!       PAUL.      Go, broken heart, to probe thy wound; cut deep and do not spare!      Herself--the crowning sacrifice--the victim shall prepare!     ACT II--SEVERUS. FABIAN       SEV.      Let Felix bow to Jove and incense pour,      I seek a dearer shrine, for I adore      Nor Jove, nor Mars, nor Fortune--but Pauline.      This fruit now ripening late my hand would glean:      You know, my friend, the god who wings my way,      You know the only goddess I obey:      What reck the gods on high our sacrifice and prayer?      An earthly worship mine, sole refuge from despair!       FABIAN.      Ah! You may see her----       SEV.      Blessed be thy tongue!      O magic word, that turns my grief to song!      Yet, if she now forget each fair, fond vow?      She loved me once,--but does she love me now?      On that sweet face shall I but trouble see      Who hope for love undimmed, for ecstasy?      Great Decius gives her hand, but if her heart      Be mine no more--than let vain hope depart!      This mandate binds her father only; she      Shall give no captive hand--her heart is free:      No promise wrung, no king's command be mine to claim,      Her love the boon I crave; all else an empty name!       FABIAN.      Yes,--you may--see her--_see_ her--this you may--       SEV.      Thy speech is halting--odious thy delay!      She loves no more? I grope! O give me light!       FABIAN.      O see her not, for painful were the sight!      In Rome each matron's kind! In Rome all maids are fair!      Let lips meet other lips--seek for caresses there!      No stately Claudia will refuse--no Julia proud disdain;      A hero captures every heart, from Antioch to Spain!       SEV.      To wed a queen--an empress--were only loss and shame;      One heart for me--Pauline's! One boast--that dearest name!      Her love was virgin gold! O ne'er shall baser metal ring      From mine, who live her name to bless! her peerless praise to sing!      O, words are naught, till that I see her face,      Then doubly naught till I my love embrace.      In every war my hope was placed in death,      Her name upon my lips at every breath:      My rank, my fame, now hers and hers alone,      What is not hers, hers only--I disown!       FABIAN.      Once more, oh see her not, 'twere for thy peace!       SEV.      Thy meaning, knave, or let this babble cease!      Say, was she cold? My love! My only life!       FABIAN.      No--but--my lord----       SEV.      Say on!       FABIAN.      Another's wife!       SEV.      (Reels.)      Help!--No, I will not blench--ah, say you lie!      If this be true!--ye gods--can I be I?       FABIAN.      No, thou art changed. Where is thy courage fled?       SEV.      I know not, Fabian. Lost! Gone! Vanished! Dead!      I thought my strength was oak--'tis but a reed!      Pauline is wed, then am I lost indeed!      Hope hid beyond the cloud, yet still fond hope was there:      But now all hope is dead, lives only black despair!      Pauline another's wife?       FABIAN.      Yes, Polyeucte is her lord.      He came, he saw, he conquered thine adored.       SEV.      Her choice is not unworthy--his a name      Illustrious, from a line of kings he came      Cold comfort for a wound no cure can heal!      My cause is lost,--foredoomed without appeal!      Malignant Jove, to drag me back to-day!      Relentless Fate, to quench hope's dawning ray!      Take back your gifts! One boon alone I crave,      That only boon to none denied--the grave.      Yet would I see her, breathe one last good-bye,      Would hear once more that voice before I die!      My latest breath would still my homage pay,      That memory mine, when lost to realms of day.       FABIAN.      Yet think, my lord--       SEV.      Oh, I have thought of all;      What worser ill can dull despair befall?      She will not see me?       FABIAN.      Yes, my lord, but--       SEV.      Cease!       FABIAN.      'Twill but enhance the grief I would appease.       SEV.      For hopeless ill, good friend, I seek no cure.      Who welcomes death can life's short pain endure!       FABIAN.      O lost indeed, if round her fatal light you hover!--      The lover, losing all, speaks hardly like a lover!      While passion still is lord--the passion-swept is slave--      From this last bitterness would I Severus save!       SEV.      That word, my friend, unsay; tho' grief this bosom tear,      The hand that wounds I kiss--love vanquishes despair;      Fate only, not Pauline, the foe that I accuse,      No plighted faith she breaks who did this hand refuse.      Duty--her father--Fate--these willed, she but obeyed;      Not hers the woe, the strife that envious Ate made!      Untimely, Fortune's shower must drown me, not revive;      Too lavish and too late her fatal gifts arrive.      The golden apple falls, the gold is turned to dross:      When Fate at Fortune mocks, all gain is only loss!       FABIAN.      Yes, I will go to tell her thou hast drained      To the last drop the cup that Fate ordained.      She knows thee hero, but she feared that pain      Might prove thee also man--by passion slain.      She feared Despair, who gains the victory      O'er other men, might e'en thy master be!       SEV.      Peace! Peace! She comes!       FABIAN.      To thine own self be true!       SEV.      Nay! True to her! Shall I her life undo?      She loves the Armenian!       Enter Pauline       PAUL.      Yes, that debt I pay,      Hard--wrung, acquitted,--his my love alway!      Who has my hand, he holds--shall hold--my heart!      Truth is my guide,--let sophistry depart!      Had Fate been kind, then had Pauline been thine,      Heart, faith and duty, linked with bliss divine.      In vain had fickle Fortune barred the way,      Want had been wealth with thee, my guide, my stay,      And poverty had fallen from the wings      Of soaring love, who mocks the wealth of kings!      Not mine to choose, for he--my father's choice--      Must needs be mine; yes, when I heard his voice,      Duty must echo be: if thou couldst cast      Before my feet an emperor's crown,--a past      By worth and glory lit--beloved, adored--      Yet at my father's word, 'Not this thy lord;      Take one despised--nay, loathed--to share thy bed,'--      Him, and not thee, beloved, would I wed.      Duty, obedience, must have been the part      Of me, who own their sway, e'en with a broken heart!       SEV.      O happy thou! O easy remedy!      One poor faint sigh cures love's infirmity!      Thy heart thy tool, o'er every passion queen,      Beyond all change and chance thou sit'st serene!      In easy flow can pass thy love new-born      From cold indifference to colder scorn;      Such resolution is the equal mate      Of god or monster, love, aversion, hate.      This fine-spun adamant Ithuriel's spear      Could never pierce: for other stuff is here!      (Points to himself.)      No faint 'Alas!' no swift-repented sigh      Can heal the cureless wound from which I die.      Sure, reason finds that love his easy prey      With Lethe aye at hand to point the way;      With ordered fires like thine, I too could smother      A heart in leash, find solace in another.      Too fair, too dear--from whom the Fates me sever!      Thou hast no heart to give--thou lov'dst me never!       PAUL.      Too plain, Severus, I my torture show,--      Tho' flame leap up no more, the embers glow;      Far other speech and voice, and mien were mine,      Could I forget that once thou call'dst me thine!      Tho' reason rules, yes, gains the mastery      No queen benignant, but a tyrant she!      Oh, if I conquer--if the strife I gain,      Yet memory for aye is linked with pain!      I feel the charm that binds me still to thee;      If duty great, yet great thy worth to me:      I see thee still the same, who waked the fire      Which waked in me ineffable desire.      Begirt by crown of everlasting fame      Thou art more glorious--yet art still the same.      I know thy valour's worth,--well hast thou justified      That bounding hope of mine, though fruitage was denied,      Yet this same fate which did our union ban      Hath made me, fated--wed another man.      Let Duty still be queen! Yea, let her break      The heart she pierces, yet can never shake.      The virtue, once thy pride in days gone by      Doth that same worth now merit blasphemy?      Bewail her bitter fruit--but praised be      The rights that triumph over thee and me!       SEV.      Forgive, Pauline, forgive; ah! grief hath made me blind      To all but grief's excess, and fortune most unkind.      Forgive that I mistook--nay, treated as a crime      Thy constancy of soul, unequalled and sublime;      In pity for my life forlorn, my peace denied,      Ah! show thyself less fair,--one least perfection hide!      Let some alloy be seen, some saving weakness left,      Take pity on a heart of thee and Heaven bereft!      One faintest flaw reveal, to give my soul relief!      Else, how to bear the love that only mates with grief?       PAUL.      Alas! the rents in armour donned and proved      Too well my fight proclaim; yes, I have loved;      The traitor sigh, the tear unbid, attest      The combat fierce--the warrior sore distrest.      Say, who can stanch these wounds, that armour mend?      Thou who hast pierced, thou, thou alone defend!      Ah, if thou honourest my victory      Depart, that thou may'st still defender be!      So dry the tears that, to my shame, still flow--      So quench the fire would work my overthrow!      "]]]
