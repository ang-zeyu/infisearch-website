It was my first taste of battle, but I do not remember any strange feelings.  I was in that awful shock of forces that stopped the southern progress of the German juggernaut like a chock beneath a wheel, when on September 2 it recoiled back--back to the Marne--back to the Aisne--back almost to the Belgian frontier. Then winter dropped upon it, turning the roads into pools of mud, checking all speed movements necessary to active operations, and the troops dug in like soldier crabs upon a river bank.  [Illustration: \"The Aeroplane had been a ... curiosity.\"--Chapter III.  (The first Aeroplane to fly in Australia.)]  All surprise movements had to be made at night; the dawn finding our aeroplanes out in the frosty air spying out any changes in positions of the day before. A smoke-ball fired as we flew above a new trench gave our artillery the range; then till night fell a rain of shells would batter that new position. In the dark our troops would creep forward, rush that trench, and dawn would find them dozing in their newly won quarters. The war had become a battle of entrenchments.     CHAPTER III.  The Flying Men.   For ages man walked the earth.  To-day he is the only living creature that can travel in the air by other than its own substance.  'Till the Great War the aeroplane was a scientific curiosity. The Battle of the Nations blooded it; and its wonderful utility in speeding the end of the war has proved its right to be recognised as a distinct factor in human movement.  When the war crash came there were two aerial types; the lighter than air type, the dirigible balloon; and the heavier than air machine, the aeroplane. This is how the Powers stood in aerial furnishing when the first shot was fired. Germany and Austria had 25 airships, including 11 Zeppelins, as well as 556 aeroplanes.  England, France, Russia and Belgium had 33 airships and 1019 aeroplanes.  The English dirigibles had not made long flights, and not being very dependable had not received much attention from the military authorities. A non-dependable factor in war is worse than useless. A mistake may be made in tactics, but when ascertained may be retrieved and, perhaps, turned to good account. Non-dependability is fatal, as many a commander would not know how to act, and in war, he who hesitates is lost.  The French had experimented a good deal with the dirigible, but mostly of the non-rigid type, which was a type \"without a backbone\" and was as uncertain, so that its general non-dependability turned French attention to the aeroplane.  The Germans, however, pinned their faith on the balloon, and for long made it a feature for observation purposes, so that when Zeppelin brought out his rigid framework balloon, Germany fancied she saw in it the command of the air.  The Zeppelin, however, had many disabilities over the aeroplane. It had to have its own kennel. It was almost impossible to get it into its shed if the wind was against it. The kennels had, therefore, to be either on wheels or floating. Furthermore, not being able to replenish its gas, a Zeppelin had always to return to its base for supplies. But the gas balloon suited the smug character of the German. Unlike the aviator who threw himself into the air on a bundle of steel rods and rubber, a propeller and a petrol engine, the phlegmatic German took no risks with a balloon. He found, however, that Zeppelins were expensive freaks. They had a habit of catching fire in the air, because the tail created a vacuum and sucked back some escaping gas into the engine where the contact spark ignited it.  One recently alighted in a field and a country bumpkin came over with the crowd to see the fun. He had a pipe in his mouth. He was told to go away. He wouldn't for a while, but he soon left in a hurry. After the explosion they found bits of him and sixty-seven other people!  The Germans pinned their faith to the Zeppelin because it could carry a heavy load of explosives and would be an easy way of damaging an enemy; and it was only a few months before the war that considerable enthusiasm ruled Germany because a Zeppelin had made a record trip from the southern to the northern fringe of Germany, or, as \"Vorwarts\" said, \"as far as from Germany to England and back again.\"  Here, then, was an easy way to fight. Just rise up out of danger and drop bombs.  They tried it at Antwerp.  On 25th August, 1915, a Zeppelin flew over the sleeping city, guided by flash lamps from German spies on roofs. It was a night of terror--a bomb dropped to fall upon the royal palace, missed and injured two women; a bomb aimed for the Antwerp Bank missed and killed a servant; but one fell into a hospital and another into a crowd in the city square. Five people were blown to atoms.  It must have been an awful night, for it is recorded that the city watchman of Antwerp announced: \"12 o'clock and all's hell.\"  On September 2nd (the anniversary of Sedan), the Zeppelin came again to give its stab in the dark, but finding it was recognised, retreated. It did not rise higher to get out of danger of the air guns and put up a fight. The German in the air takes few risks. It is his temperament. Not so with the Frenchman. He is by nature dashing and volatile. The easy-going of the dirigible little appealed to him. The risk, the speed, the adventure of the aeroplane touched his soul, which explained why France had 2032 military aviators, whilst Germany had only 300 qualified military pilots.  The German lacks the dash, nerve, vim and initiative essential to a successful flier. He is moulded as a cog. He is part of a system--out of that he must not move. It has wrecked his initiative, and the sneer of the greatest German in history, Frederick the Great, has to-day grim significance.  \"See those two mules,\" he said satirically to one of his officers, who lacked initiative, \"they have been in fifteen campaigns and--they're still mules.\"  The German training system has taken all the humanity out of the men. They move like machines, either destroying or rolling on to destruction, and they often act with the dumb sense of the machine to pain and suffering.  Lloyd George has very truly put it: \"God made man to his own image, but the German recreated him in the form of a Diesel engine.\"  No one questioned the efficiency of the German machine. The Allies were disputing its right to go on destroying.  [Illustration: \"The New Arm.\"--Chapter IV.]     CHAPTER IV.  The New Arm.   \"It strikes me that these fool commanders don't know what to do with us. We aviators seem to be too new to come into all their stunts. Here we've been flying over eight years, and we're still novel enough to be repeatedly fired on by our own side. Why the beggars in our own battery, when they see an aeroplane overhead in their excitement let fly. They don't bother to notice that the plane of our Bleriot hasn't claw ends like the enemy's Taube. Neither do they note we carry our own distinguishing mark. We're the circus show. We're the 'comic relief' sure.\"  He was about to spit his disgust on an unoffending fly, but quickly changed his mind.  He was a Yank from the U.S.A. Military School at San Diego, and \"hiked over the pond as there was nothing doing.\"  In appearance he was tall and wiry with a thin face and hooked nose that suggested the bird-man. His name on the roll was Walter Edmund Byrne, but his bony appearance won him his nickname--Nap.  We knew nicknames would shock those who stand for the rigid rule of military discipline, but aviators clear the usual wall of demarcation between officers and subordinates. A nod supplants the \"heels together and touch your cap.\"  The Aviation Sections seemed to be communistic concerns, in the air rank being only recognised by achievement. In fact, the new arm was too new to be brought under the iron rule of military etiquette or into most Operation Orders. I told Nap as much.  \"Yes,\" he said, \"I guess we're too new. Even when cannon first came into war it was novel enough to fire as often from the wrong end and teach things 'to the man behind the gun'; but I've a bit of dope here that ought to be pasted into every book of your field service regulations, and every officer ought to repeat it before breakfast three times a week. It's the flyers' creed.\"  Fumbling amongst some newspaper scraps in his note book, he produced this bit of verse.     The snake with poisoned fang defends      (And does it really very well).    The cuttle fish an inkcloud sends;      The tortoise has its fort of shell;    The tiger has its teeth and claws;      The rhino has its horns and hide;    The shark has rows of saw-set jaws;      Man--stands alone, the whole world wide    Unarmed and naked! But 'tis plain      For him to fight--God gave a brain!     Far back in this world's early mists      When man began to use his head;    He stopped from fighting with his fists      And gripped a wooden club instead.    But when the rival tribe was slain,      The first tribe then to stand alone    Had once again to work its brain      And made an axe--an axe of stone!    The stone-axe tribe would hold first place;      And ruled the rest where'er it went.    Because then--as to-day--the race      Was first that had best armament.    But human brain expanding more      (Its limits none can circumscribe);    The stone-axe crowd went down before      The more developed bronze-axe tribe.    Then shields came in to quickly show      Their party victors in the strife:    By warding off the vicious blow      And giving warriors longer life.    The tribe's wise men would urge at length,      No doubt as now, for tax on tax,    To keep the \"Two tribe\" fighting strength      With \"super-dreadnought\" shield and axe!     The bow and arrow came and won      For Death came winged from far away.    Then came the cannon and the gun;      And brought us where we are to-day.    And now we"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27382"],["title","The Sequel (#2)"],["body","the shield of yore      An arsenal of armour plate;    With crew a thousand men or more;      And guns a hundred tons in weight.    Beneath our seas dart submarines,      Around the world and back again.    But every marvel only means      Some greater triumph of the brain.    For while the thund'ring hammers ring;      And super-dreadnoughts swarm the sea;    There flits above, a birdlike thing,      That claims an aerial sovereignty!    A thing of canvas, stick and wheel      \"The two-man fighting aeroplane.\"    It screams above those hulks of steel:      \"Oh! human brain begin again.\"  [Illustration]  Nap was busy with bad language, a size brush and some fabric remnants patching the plane, whilst I read his treasure by my pocket lamp. Then he came over.  \"Mind you,\" he said, \"I don't greatly blame folks here. It can't be worse than in America--America, where the first machine got up and made good--where the man the world had waited for for ages, Wilbur Wright (though he's been dead some years), hasn't even got a tablet up to say: 'Good on you old man, God rest your soul.'\"  We were standing by our machines, waiting for the dawn light to call us aloft for our daily reconnaissance when Nap let his tongue loose.  \"Five years ago, when the Wright Brothers first flew, Europe went dotty and began to offer big prizes for stunts in the air. Wright took his old 'bus across the pond and won everything. Next year our Glen Curtis went over and brought back all the scalps. Then America got tired. We live in a hurry there. We're the spoilt kids of the earth, always wanting a new toy. When we tired of straight flying, we went in for circus stunts; such as spiral turning, volplaning, upside-down flying and looping the loop. We interested the crowd for a while, as there was a chance of some of us smashing up. But when flying got safe and sane and the aeroplane almost foolproof, the public got cold feet, and the only men flying when I left, were young McCormick, the Harvester chap of Chicago, occasionally hiking across Lake Michigan in his 'amphoplane,' and Beechy, dodging death in 'aeroplane versus automobile' races.  \"Curtis has a factory that had been shooing the bailiff till Wanamaker came along and financed that Atlantic aeroplane that was too heavy to carry its weight; and Lieutenant Porte, who was to take it across, was in a fix till this war came along and called him over. Orville Wright is trying to make a do of his factory. It is significant that Captain Mitchell, of the U.S. Signal Corps, the other day asked the U.S. Government 'to help those fellows out or they'll have to quit the business.' So you see Jefson, that's why I get the huff when I see the same sort of thing over here, especially in times like these 'that try men's souls.'\"  Then the dawn light streaked the eastern sky rim. We pulled the plane from under the tree screen. The propeller hummed, dragged us across a dozen yards and up into the cold air of the early New Year morn.  [Illustration: \"When flying got safe and sane.\"--Chapter IV.]     CHAPTER V.  The Tired Feeling.   Our quarters were outside Epernay, about fifteen miles south of Rheims, with the Marne between us and the enemy.  To the north the horizon was fringed with the ridge-backed plateau cut by the Aisne. The enemy had been holding that fringe since October, having pushed back our almost daily attempts to get on to it. We got a particularly bad smack early in 1915, after crossing at Soissons.  To the north east was the ridge covered by the Argonne Forest; a sealed area to the man in the air.  We had been here three months, and our daily flight over the same area robbed the view of any scenic interest.  Perhaps, in the clear air of the winter morning, we would see far off silhouetted against the pale green of the brightening eastern sky, the dove-like aeroplanes of the enemy moving over the distant forest like bees above a bush.  Sometimes an \"affair of aerial patrols\" would result in the exchange of long shots, but seldom with any effect, for the reason that our enemy took few risks in the air and, furthermore, we could not pursue, as our orders were for speedy reconnaissance and early report. This was no easy matter over a country covered with the snowy quilt of winter, when even trees were unrecognisable, except at an angle that would show the trunks beneath: an angle that would call for low flying, bringing us within the 6000 feet range of the enemy's \"air-squirts.\"  By day we \"trimmed our ship,\" examined every screw and bolt and inspected our bombs and fuses. These \"cough drops\" were radish-shaped shells, each weighing thirty-one pounds; and were fired from an apparatus which could be worked by the pilot and which carried a regulator showing height and speed of the machine. Fair accuracy could thus be achieved.  One evening, the commander of the battery to which we were attached came over to our quarters, the skillion of a wrecked farm house.  He brought word that another Zeppelin had been rammed by one of our machines. Both machines and their occupants had been smashed.  He spoke in French, and we understood, which explained why we were stationed so far east on the fighting line.  \"Magnificent it must have been,\" he said, \"we groundlarks always have a fighting chance, but there is no chance for you bird-men. Ah! who can now say the romance has gone out of war with the improvement in range of weapons. Time was not long since when the general headed his men with a waving sword. As your Shakespeare said it--'Once more into the breach, dear friends.' And my comrades are fighting through this campaign, banging at an enemy they may never see. But the aeroplane has brought back the romance again. Ah! it is fine.\"  When he strolled out Nap ventured his opinion.  \"Romance in war! There's not a scrap of it. The fool-flyer who rams a Zepp. deserves what he gets. It's wasteful for a flyer to so risk his speedy plane, when he has a better fighting chance of rising and dropping 'cough-drops' on the slow old 'bus beneath him; as Pegoud told us the other day: 'The Zeppelins! Ah, they are slow as geese, but our aeroplanes, they are swift as swallows.'  \"The trouble is there's not enough opportunity here to do things. This daily 'good-morning fly' and cleaning engines the rest of the day is getting on my nerves, we've been marking time here for months. I want something to happen along 'right soon.'\"  And something did happen along next morning.     CHAPTER VI.  Civilised Warfare.   Nap was in a bad humor.  The breeze from the north-east had kept us up for three days. It came to us over fields of long-unburied dead. It explained our morbid craving for tobacco--and Nap, during the night, had lost a cherished half-cigar!  We felt the cold that morning, as we wheeled the 'plane into the open space. The engine was also out of sorts, coughing like an asthmatic victim.  The first sun ray shot into the sky and called us aloft. So with engine spluttering the 'plane climbed over the Marne-Vesle Ridge and above the cloud of smoke that hid Rheims 5000 feet below us.  Looking far to the north-west, a great fog cloud lay over the wet country of the Yser. About twenty-five miles off, near Laon, we spotted one of the enemy's observation balloons being inflated.  \"Shall we drop a 'cough-drop'?\" Nap shouted to me through the speaking tube.  \"No chance,\" I shouted back, \"there's something coming at us.\"  A swift Taube was racing up to challenge. It was rising to get the \"drop\" on us. We carried an aerial gun, but hesitated to fire, as we wanted all our speed to get above our rival. Our engine lost its bad temper for a change. Round and round we began to circle like game cocks spoiling for a fight; rising, forgetting, in the excitement, the cold of the upper air--higher and higher, till Nap shouted, \"We'll get her beneath us in the next round and then for a 'cough-drop' or the gun.\"  But the Taube had seen our advantage. It banked up on a sharp turn, dropped like a stone fully a thousand feet, making a magnificent volplane, and scurried away like a frightened vulture, dropping and dropping in a series of gigantic swoops.  \"We won't chase,\" said Nap, \"she wants to bring us into range of their 'air-squirts,' and 'Archibalds' are not pleasant on an empty stomach.\"  [Illustration: \"ONE OF THE ENEMY'S 'AIR-SQUIRTS.'\"  A German Aerial Gun.]  We turned home and then the engine sulked again. I could see Nap was in trouble. It was was just as well that the roar of the engine and the hum of the propeller compelled the use of speaking-tube communication, for when a man uses bad language he isn't cool enough to pour his sentiments through a pipe. But we were coming down, gliding down on a long angle, with the engine giving a spasmodic kick. Down, down towards a light fog that the breeze had brought down from the north-west; down, down till we could see below us trench lines that were not our own! Then the engine stopped!  Nap looked out, turned to me and pulled a face. Putting his mouth to the tube he shouted \"Lean over and wave your hand like....\"  Several grey-coated soldiers were now running over to a bare patch to which we seemed to be sliding. I waved frantically--the soldiers hesitated to fire and waved back again! Down, down, with Nap working like a fiend at the engine! Down, down to within a few hundred feet of the ground, when something happened. The engine, after a splutter, set off at its usual rattle, the propeller caught up its momentum and descent was checked.  Nap leaned over and joined in the waving demonstration and, knowing that an attempt to rise abruptly would give away the fact that we were trying to escape, he kept at a low level, flying over waving Germans, past a long line of German troops breakfasting behind the trenches; then back again to try and convince them that we were of their own, then circling around till we reached a safe height above the thickening fog, our aching arms stopped waving.
