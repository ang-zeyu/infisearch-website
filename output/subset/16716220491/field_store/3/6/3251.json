His musical trill, sounding very much like the brook that rippled its way down the side of Blue Mountain, always made Farmer Green feel glad that another day had come.  \"If that busy little chap is up----\" he often said, meaning Rusty Wren, of course--\"if he's up there's no reason why I should lie here and sleep.\"  And since everybody else in the house followed Farmer Green's custom of rising early, it happened that so small a bird as Rusty Wren aroused the whole household out of their beds.  To be sure, Johnnie Green--sitting up and rubbing his eyes sleepily--sometimes wished that Rusty would skip his dawn song once in a while. And he told his father at breakfast one day that since he was not a bird, he saw no reason why he should get up with the sun.  \"You needn't,\" said Farmer Green. \"But you know the old saying about 'early to bed and early to rise,' don't you?\"  Johnnie remembered that such habits were supposed to make one \"healthy, wealthy and wise.\" And since he hated to take medicine, and was trying to save enough money to buy him a gun, and disliked to be kept in after school for not knowing his lessons, he decided that perhaps it was just as well, after all, to follow Rusty Wren's example.  Now, Farmer Green spoke so often and so pleasantly of Rusty Wren, saying that nobody could want a better little alarm clock than he, that Rusty began to take a great deal of pride in his morning task of awakening the household. It could hardly be called a task, however, because Rusty thoroughly enjoyed singing, though when he sang--as when he did anything else--he put every ounce of his strength into the effort. With his head lifted as high as his short neck would permit, and his tail (which usually stuck pertly upwards) drooping downward, as if he had for the moment forgotten it, he poured forth his music with such fervor that his small body actually trembled.  You see, Rusty Wren never did things by halves. When he did anything he was never satisfied with less than his best.  And that was another reason why Farmer Green liked him.     IV  RUSTY IS JEALOUS   Before Rusty Wren came to live in Farmer Green's dooryard the family had been known to oversleep now and then. Working hard all day long as everybody did (except Johnnie Green, who played hard enough--goodness knows!), they slept very soundly at night. And two or three times every summer they were sure to rise late, just by accident.  Though such a mishap always annoyed Farmer Green, it never troubled either the hired man or Johnnie in the least. On the contrary, they seemed to enjoy those occasions. But with Rusty Wren to rouse them at dawn all that was changed. And Farmer Green remarked one day that one thing was certain; they would lose no time that summer by staying in bed too long.  That very afternoon he had to go to the village. And when he came home he brought several surprises with him.  Those surprises pleased Johnnie and his mother so much that when he went to bed that night Farmer Green felt even happier than was usual with him. He went to bed somewhat early because he said he had more work than ever to do the next day, on account of his having gone to the village.  But happy as he was that night, the following morning Farmer Green was quite out of sorts. For the whole family overslept. Not a soul awaked until the sun had been up at least an hour.  \"I don't understand----\" Farmer Green said at the breakfast table--\"I don't understand why I failed to hear that wren this morning. I must have been unusually sleepy.\"  The hired man helped himself to some more griddle-cakes and remarked that it was a pity. But somehow he did not _look_ sorry, in spite of what he said.  \"We'll go to bed early to-night,\" Farmer Green continued, \"so we'll be sure to wake up before sunrise.\"  And, strange to say, the next morning the very same accident happened again.  \"I don't see what's come over me,\" said Farmer Green. \"I don't hear that wren singing right under my window any more. I thought that maybe the cat had caught him. But there he is this very moment, on that limb!\"  Everybody said it certainly was odd, for the wren always sang as soon as it began to grow light.  Well, that night Farmer Green went to bed before dark, declaring that he must be up bright and early in the morning.  \"I wish that new clock I brought home day before yesterday was an alarm clock,\" he said. \"Then I wouldn't have to worry about waking up on time.... Anyhow, I ought to hear the wren again to-morrow morning.\"  But Farmer Green hoped in vain. Though the cat had not caught Rusty, and he had not moved away, either, he no longer sang beneath Farmer Green's window at dawn.  For three mornings he had gone to the orchard to trill his dawn song; and though they did not know the reason, that was why the Green family rose late for three mornings running.  Once Rusty Wren had been proud to be called Farmer Green's alarm clock. But now something had happened that made him resolve to stop waking the household.  It was all on account of one of those surprises that Farmer Green had brought home from the village. For without intending to do any such thing, Farmer Green had surprised Rusty Wren as well as Johnnie and his mother.  Now, a surprise may be one of two kinds--pleasant or unpleasant. And, strangely enough, the very thing that delighted the Green family sent Rusty Wren into a spasm of jealous rage.  Of course, it was very silly of him to lose his temper. But he was too upset to stop to think of that.     V  THE NEW BIRD   Farmer Green had not been home long, after his trip to the village, when Rusty Wren heard a sound that for once made him keep quite still for at least five seconds.  \"Cuckoo! cuckoo!\" The cry came from inside the farmhouse. And since the windows were wide open, Rusty could easily hear it from the tree near-by, where he lived.  \"There's a new bird in there!\" Rusty Wren exclaimed to himself as soon as the sound reached his ears. He listened intently. But the call was not repeated.  \"Farmer Green is not satisfied with my singing!\" Rusty cried. And thereupon he flew into such a rage that when his wife came home, a few minutes later, she was actually frightened.  \"What in the world is the matter?\" she asked her husband anxiously.  \"Matter?\" cried Rusty Wren. \"Here I've sung my best for Farmer Green all summer, and waked him at dawn every morning without fail! And what do you suppose he's done? He has brought home a strange bird from the village, because he doesn't care for my singing.\"  Mrs. Rusty Wren told her husband that he must be mistaken.  \"Maybe a bird flew inside the farmhouse by accident,\" she said. \"What kind of bird is it?\" she inquired.  \"It _said_ 'Cuckoo!'\" Rusty explained. \"But if it's a cuckoo, it's different from any other I've ever heard. You know yourself that Black Bill Cuckoo who lives in the bushes beyond the orchard says '_Cow, cow!_'\"  \"I wouldn't worry, if I were you,\" Mrs. Rusty advised her husband. \"No doubt this strange bird has already made his escape.\"  It was then after sunset. And soon Rusty Wren's family were all fast asleep, without having heard any more bird notes from the farmhouse.  The next morning Rusty awoke just as the first streaks of gray showed in the east. He was about to begin his dawn song when through the kitchen window came that \"Cuckoo! cuckoo!\" again.  Rusty knew then that the strange bird was still there.  \"Did you hear that?\" he asked his wife.  She nodded her head silently.  \"He's telling Farmer Green that it's time to get up!\" Rusty exclaimed indignantly. \"And since Farmer Green has seen fit to get somebody else to wake him, I certainly shall not trouble myself on his account any more.\"  So Rusty Wren flew away to the orchard to sing his dawn song. Jolly Robin, who lived there, in an old apple tree, was surprised to hear Rusty Wren singing in that neighborhood so early. And he was still more astonished at Rusty's melody.  His voice was so much shriller than usual that Jolly Robin knew instantly that something had displeased him.  \"What's happened to upset you?\" Jolly Robin inquired, after Rusty had finished singing.  \"I expect to come here and give my dawn song every morning,\" Rusty remarked. \"And if there's anybody living in the orchard that objects, he had better move away at once.\"  Of course Jolly Robin didn't want to do that. And he said as much, too.  \"But I hope you'll sing a little more happily,\" he told Rusty, \"because I don't like to hear people complaining--and neither does my wife.\"         *       *       *       *       *  It is easy to understand why Farmer Green and his family overslept, when one knows that Rusty Wren no longer sang his dawn song beneath Farmer Green's window. And when Rusty saw that the whole household never stirred until long after sunrise, he was so pleased that he couldn't help making a few remarks about the new bird in the farmhouse, which had annoyed him so by singing \"Cuckoo! cuckoo!\"  \"This stranger is a very poor songster!\" Rusty said to his wife. \"All he can sing is 'Cuckoo! cuckoo!' in that silly way of his. He has no trills and runs and ripples at all! And he can't even repeat his song ten times a minute, as I give mine. He has to wait at least half an hour before he cries 'Cuckoo! cuckoo!' again. And no one but a simpleton would ever attempt to awaken a hard-working farmer by such half-hearted singing.\"  Mrs. Rusty quite agreed with her husband.  \"Farmer Green will be sorry he brought home such a worthless bird,\" she said.     VI  MR. CROW TO THE RESCUE   As time went on, and the Green family overslept each morning, Rusty began to grow very weary of the monotonous \"Cuckoo! cuckoo!\" which came every half hour, all day long, through the kitchen window of the farmhouse.  \"I'd like to know what sort of bird that is!\" he exclaimed at last. \"If he'd only come out here in the yard I'd ask him his name--and tell him what I think of him, too.\"  But"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25824"],["title","The Tale of Rusty Wren (#2)"],["body"," stranger never stirred out of the kitchen. And at length Rusty decided to make inquiries about him. Seeing Jimmy Rabbit passing through the orchard on his way home from the cabbage-patch, Rusty called to him.  \"If you happen to see old Mr. Crow, I wish you would ask him if he won't please come right over to the orchard,\" Rusty Wren said. \"There's something I want to find out. And Mr. Crow knows so much that perhaps he can help me.\"  Jimmy Rabbit declared that he would be delighted to deliver the message. And he must have gone out of his way to find Mr. Crow, for the old gentleman arrived at the orchard in less than sixteen minutes.  Rusty was waiting for him. And, having explained about the strange bird as well as he could, he asked Mr. Crow what he thought.  \"I'd like to hear his song,\" said old Mr. Crow.  \"Come right over to my tree near the house!\" Rusty urged him.  Mr. Crow hesitated.  \"Where's Farmer Green?\" he inquired.  \"Oh! He's working in the hayfield.\"  \"Where's Johnnie Green?\" Mr. Crow asked.  \"Oh! He's in the hayfield, too, riding on the hayrake,\" Rusty Wren explained.  \"I'll come with you, then,\" Mr. Crow croaked.  So they flew to the dooryard. And they hadn't waited there long when the strange bird sang his \"Cuckoo! cuckoo!\"  \"There!\" said Rusty. \"That's his silly song!\"  And to his surprise Mr. Crow haw-hawed right out.  \"What's the joke?\" Rusty Wren wanted to know.  \"That's not a bird----\" said old Mr. Crow--\"or, at least, it's not a _real_ bird. He's made of wood. And he lives inside a cuckoo clock.\"  \"Ah!\" Rusty cried. \"An alarm clock!\"  But old Mr. Crow shook his head.  \"No!\" he replied. \"It's just an everyday clock. And, instead of striking, it lets this little wooden bird come out and sing.\"  Rusty Wren said that he wouldn't care for a clock like that and that he didn't see why Farmer Green had brought it home, anyhow.  \"Cuckoo clocks amuse the women and children,\" Mr. Crow remarked wisely.  \"Then you think Farmer Green was not dissatisfied with my singing? You think he would like me to wake him every morning, just as I used to?\" Rusty waited eagerly for Mr. Crow's opinion.  Old Mr. Crow pondered for a while before answering. He reflected that since it was long past corn-planting time, it really made no difference to him whether Farmer Green overslept or not. If the corn had just been put in the ground, he would have liked to have Farmer Green stay in bed all day long.  \"I understand that the whole family enjoys your songs,\" Mr. Crow told Rusty at last. \"And for the present you may as well sing your dawn song right here in your own tree, beneath Farmer Green's window. But if you're living here next spring, I wish you would consult me again.\"  Rusty Wren agreed to that, thanking Mr. Crow for his kindness, too. And, afterward, instead of being angry, he laughed whenever he heard that silly \"Cuckoo! cuckoo!\" Since he knew it was only a wooden bird, Rusty Wren was jealous no longer.  The next morning he awakened Farmer Green at the break o' day. And the hired man was so sleepy that he fell downstairs and couldn't work for a whole week.     VII  A NEAT HOUSEKEEPER   Rusty Wren's wife was a very neat housekeeper. Every day she carefully cleaned her house, chirping while she worked. Sometimes her voice was sweet and pleasant. But at other times--though it was still sweet--it was not pleasant at all. And whenever Rusty heard that second kind of chirp he was always careful to find some errand that took him away from home.  You see, Rusty Wren was not so orderly as his wife. Often he scattered things about the house in a very careless fashion. For instance, if he happened to notice a bit of moss--or a burr--clinging to his coat, just as likely as not he would brush it off and let it fall upon the floor. And when Mrs. Rusty found anything like that in her cottage, she always knew how it came there.  Rusty sometimes remarked that it was a good thing he didn't smoke.  \"How would you like it if I dropped bits of tobacco, or ashes, and maybe burnt matches for you to pick up?\" he asked his wife.  \"You couldn't come inside my house if you used tobacco,\" she always replied. And she would get quite excited at the mere thought of such an untidy habit.  And then Rusty would smile--but he always took good care not to let his wife see him.  \"Don't worry!\" he would say, if she became too stirred up. \"I've never smoked yet--and I never expect to.\"  One can see that Rusty Wren was somewhat of a tease. And as it usually happens with people who amuse themselves at the expense of others, there came a time when Rusty's teasing landed him in trouble.  One day after he had come home from an excursion to the pasture (he seldom strayed so far from home as that!), Mrs. Rusty began sniffing the air. Her nose would have wrinkled--only it couldn't, because it was so hard. She looked at her husband suspiciously. And it seemed to her that he had a guilty manner.  \"I declare,\" she said, \"I believe you've been smoking.\" And she started to scold so angrily that Rusty Wren knew she must be in a temper.  Seeing signs of trouble, Rusty began to fidget. And he moved about so uneasily that his wife was all the surer of his guilt. She stopped right in the middle of her scolding to say, \"I smell smoke!\"  \"Perhaps you do,\" Rusty admitted. \"But it's certainly not tobacco smoke.\"  \"Ah!\" she exclaimed. \"Then you've been smoking corn-silk, or hayseed--and that's almost as bad.\"  But Rusty said that it must be the smoke of a pine stump that she noticed.  \"Farmer Green is burning some old stumps in the pasture,\" he explained. \"And I flew through a cloud of it.\"  Just then he happened to notice a bit of something or other clinging to one of his tail feathers. And though his wife was looking straight at him, he flicked the tiny scrap upon the floor, without thinking what he was doing.  \"There you go again!\" Mrs. Rusty Wren cried. \"Here I've just finished cleaning the house and you're littering it all up! You don't care how much work you make for me.\" And she pounced upon the brownish bit, intending to pick it up and throw it out of the house.  Rusty had already decided that he had better go away from home for a little while, until things were pleasanter, when his wife suddenly faced about and fixed him with her glittering eyes.  \"Ha!\" she cried, holding up the scrap in her bill for him to see. \"Tobacco!\" she screamed. \"And what, pray, have you to say to me now?\"     VIII  RUSTY IN TROUBLE   Rusty Wren edged toward the door--that little opening in the syrup can, only slightly bigger than a twenty-five-cent piece. He wished he was already safely through it, for he did not like the look in his wife's eyes.  \"I must be going now,\" he said faintly--though he was generally as bold as brass.  \"Wait a moment!\" Mrs. Rusty ordered. \"Where did this tobacco come from?\" She spoke somewhat thickly, for she still held the bit of brown leaf in her bill.  \"I can't imagine,\" he stammered. \"I never knew it was sticking to my tail until I saw it and brushed it off----\"  \"On my clean floor!\" his wife interrupted. \"Goodness knows it's bad enough to have you forever doing things like that without your bringing _tobacco_ into my clean house--and without smelling of smoke, too.\"  For almost the first time in his life Rusty Wren was really worried. Somehow, he had managed to get into something a good deal like a scrape. It seemed to him that the house was terribly hot and stuffy; and always before he had thought it quite comfortable.  \"I'm going out for a breath of fresh air,\" he protested feebly. And before Mrs. Rusty could stop him he dodged past her and slipped through the tiny doorway, leaving her to scold to her heart's content.  All this happened in the middle of the morning. And the cuckoo clock in Farmer Green's kitchen had sung the hour six times before Rusty Wren returned.  Never before had he stayed away from his snug house so long. And, naturally, that made him have a guilty feeling, as if he had really done something to be ashamed of. As for smoking, he had (as he said) never smoked in his life. It was true that Farmer Green was burning stumps in the pasture that morning, and that the odor of the smoke had clung to Rusty's feathers.  But the bit of tobacco that had clung to his tail was a mystery that he couldn't explain. It was a most unfortunate accident. But Rusty hoped that by that time--it was then the middle of the afternoon--he hoped that his wife had recovered from her displeasure. Usually, when they had any little difference of opinion, she felt better if he gave her plenty of time in which to scold. But now Rusty was not quite sure of his welcome. He had never seen Mrs. Rusty so upset.  \"Are you there, my love?\" he asked softly, as he alighted on the roof of his house. He did not care to go inside until he was quite sure that his wife was in better spirits.  \"The smoker has come home again,\" a peevish voice called out. And instead of bursting into the merry song which Rusty had been all ready to carol, he flew off across the yard and began hunting for something to eat.  Since he couldn't very well go home, he thought that he might as well enjoy a good meal, at least.     IX  ALL'S WELL AGAIN   After Rusty Wren had revived his drooping spirits by eating heartily of three dozen insects of different kinds and sizes, he felt so cheerful that he couldn't help trilling a few songs. It was almost evening; and he was glad not to let the sun go down without thanking him in that way for shining so brightly all day.  Though it was so late, Farmer Green still toiled in the fields; but Rusty could hear Johnnie and old dog Spot driving the cows down the lane towards the barn.  Now, above the wide door of the carriage house a window was open--a window through which Rusty had flown early in the morning. Unlike old Mr. Crow, Rusty Wren was not in the least afraid to enter any of the farm buildings. Perhaps if Rusty had been in the habit of taking Farmer Green's"]]]
