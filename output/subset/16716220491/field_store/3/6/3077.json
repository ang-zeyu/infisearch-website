Believed to be by Count d'Orsay. _From a   miniature at Apsley House_                     \"    392     INTRODUCTORY NOTE  TO CHAPTER XIII   The new year (1844) opened with signs of improved trade, and a feeling of confidence, partly due to the friendly _entente_ with France. In Ireland, soon after the collapse of the Clontarf meeting, O'Connell and some of his associates were indicted for seditious conspiracy, and convicted. The conviction was subsequently quashed on technical grounds, but O'Connell's political influence was at an end. In Parliament, owing chiefly to the exertions of Lord Ashley (afterwards Earl of Shaftesbury), an important Bill was passed restricting factory labour, and limiting its hours. The Bank Charter Act, separating the issue and banking departments, as well as regulating the note issue of the Bank of England in proportion to its stock of gold, also became law. Meanwhile the dissensions in the Conservative party were increasing, and the Ministry were defeated on a motion made by their own supporters to extend the preferential treatment of colonial produce. With great difficulty the vote was rescinded and a crisis averted; but the Young England section of the Tory party were becoming more and more an embarrassment to the Premier. Towards the end of the year the new Royal Exchange was opened amid much ceremony by the Queen.  The services rendered by Sir Charles Napier in India were the subject of votes of thanks in both Houses, but shortly afterwards Lord Ellenborough, the Governor-General, was recalled by the Directors of the East India Company: their action was no doubt due to his overbearing methods and love of display, but it was disapproved by the Ministry, and Lord Ellenborough was accorded an Earldom.  During the year there was a recrudescence of the friction between this country and France, due partly to questions as to the right of search of foreign ships, partly to a _brochure_ issued by the Prince de Joinville, a son of Louis Philippe, partly to the assumption of French sovereignty over Tahiti and the seizure of the English consul there by the French authorities. Reparation however was made, and the ill-feeling subsided sufficiently to enable the King of the French to visit Queen Victoria,--the first friendly visit ever paid by a French king to the Sovereign of England. Louis Philippe was cordially received in this country.  Another historic royal visit also took place in 1844, that of the Emperor Nicholas, who no doubt was so much impressed with his friendly reception, both by the Court and by Aberdeen, the Foreign Secretary, that nine years later he thought he could calculate on the support of England under Aberdeen (then Premier) in a scheme for the partition of Turkey. Lord Malmesbury, who a few years later became Foreign Secretary, states in his memoirs that during this visit, the Czar, Sir Robert Peel, the Duke of Wellington, and Lord Aberdeen \"drew up and signed a Memorandum, the spirit and scope of which was to support Russia in her legitimate protectorship of the Greek religion and the Holy Shrines, and to do so without consulting France,\" but the Memorandum was in reality only one made by Nicholas of his recollection of the interview, and communicated subsequently to Lord Aberdeen.  No events of special interest took place in other parts of Europe; the condition of affairs in the Peninsula improved, though the announcement of the unfortunate marriage of the Queen Mother with the Duke of Rianzares was not of hopeful augury for the young Queen Isabella's future; as a matter of fact, the marriage had taken place some time previously.     CHAPTER XIII  1844   _Queen Victoria to the King of the Belgians._  WINDSOR CASTLE, _9th January 1844._  MY DEAREST UNCLE,--I had the pleasure of receiving your kind letter of the 4th, which is written from Ardenne, where I grieve to see you are again gone without my beloved Louise.  Charlotte is the admiration of every one, and I wish much I could have seen the three dear children _en représentation_.  Our fat Vic or Pussette learns a verse of _Lamartine_ by heart, which ends with \"le tableau se déroule à mes pieds\"; to show how well she had understood this difficult line which Mdlle. Charier had explained to her, I must tell you the following _bon mot_. When she was riding on her pony, and looking at the cows and sheep, she turned to Mdlle. Charier and said: \"_Voilà_ le tableau qui se déroule à mes pieds.\" Is not this extraordinary for a little child of three years old? It is more like what a person of twenty would say. You have no notion _what_ a knowing, and I am sorry to say _sly_, little rogue she is, and so _obstinate_. She and _le petit Frère_ accompany us to dear old Claremont to-day; Alice remains here under Lady Lyttelton's care. How sorry I am that you should have hurt your leg, and in such a provoking way; Albert says he remembers well your playing often with a pen-knife when you talked, and I remember it also, but it is really dangerous.  I am happy that the news from Paris are good; the really good understanding between our two Governments provokes the Carlists and Anarchists. Bordeaux[1] is not yet gone; I saw in a letter that it was _debated_ in his presence whether he was on any favourable occasion _de se présenter en France!_Do you think that possible? Then again the papers say that there are fortifications being made on the coast of Normandy for fear of an invasion; is this so? These are many questions, but I hope you will kindly answer them, as they interest me.

Believe me, ever, your devoted Niece,  VICTORIA R.      [Footnote 1: The Duc de Bordeaux, only son of the Duc de     Berri, had by the death of Charles X. and the renunciation     of all claims to the French Throne on the part of the Duc     d'Angoulême, become the representative of the elder branch of     the Bourbons. He had intended his visit to England to have a     private character only.]     [Pageheading: THE SPANISH MARRIAGE]   _Queen Victoria to the Earl of Aberdeen._  CLAREMONT, _10th January 1844_.  The Queen understands that there is a negotiation with Sweden and Denmark pending about the cessation of their tribute to Morocco, likewise that Prince Metternich has sent a despatch condemning as unfair the understanding come to between us and France about the Spanish marriage;[2] that there is a notion of exchanging Hong Kong for a more healthy colony.  The Queen, taking a deep interest in all these matters, and feeling it her duty to do so, begs Lord Aberdeen to keep her always well informed of what is on the _tapis_ in his Department.      [Footnote 2: _See ante_, vol. i. p. 487.]     _Queen Victoria to the Earl of Aberdeen._  CLAREMONT, _13th January 1844._  The Queen has received Lord Aberdeen's letter of the 10th, and returns him the papers which he sent her, with her best thanks. She does not remember to have seen them before.  The Queen takes this opportunity to beg Lord Aberdeen to cause the despatches to be sent a little sooner from the Foreign Office, as drafts in particular have often come to the Queen a week or a fortnight after they had actually been sent across the sea.  With respect to the Hanoverian Orders, Lord Aberdeen has not quite understood what the Queen meant. It was Sir C. Thornton and others to whom the Queen had refused permission to accept the favour, on a former occasion, by which the King of Hanover was much affronted. The Queen would not like to have herself additionally fettered by any new regulation, but Lord Aberdeen will certainly concur with the Queen that it would not be expedient to give to the King of Hanover a power which the Queen herself does not possess, viz. that of granting orders as favours, or for personal services; as the number of the different classes of the Guelphic Order bestowed on Englishmen is innumerable, it would actually invest the King with such a power, which, considering how much such things are sought after, might be extremely inconvenient.  The Queen will not give a final decision upon this case until she returns to Windsor, where she has papers explanatory of the reasons which caused her to decline the King of Hanover's application in 1838.     [Pageheading: A CARRIAGE ACCIDENT]   _Queen Victoria to the King of the Belgians._  CLAREMONT, _16th January 1844._  MY DEAREST UNCLE,--Many thanks for your kind letter of the 11th. Louise can give you the details of the little upset I and Lady Douro had, and which I did not think worth while to mention.[3] It was the strangest thing possible to happen, and the most _unlikely_, for we were going quite quietly, not at all in a narrow lane, with very quiet ponies and my usual postillion; the fact was that the boy looked the _wrong_ way, and therefore did not perceive the ditch which he so cleverly got us into.  We leave dear Claremont, as usual, with the greatest regret; we are so peaceable here; Windsor is beautiful and comfortable, but it is a _palace_, and God knows _how willingly_ I would _always_ live with my beloved Albert and our children in the quiet and retirement of private life, and not be the constant object of observation, and of newspaper articles. The children (Pussette and Bertie) have been most remarkably well, and so have we, in spite of the very bad weather we had most days. I am truly and really grieved that good excellent Nemours is again _not_ to get his _dotation_.[4] Really we constitutional countries are _too shabby_.  Now, dearest Uncle, I must bid you adieu, begging you to believe me, ever your devoted Niece,  VICTORIA R.

I am glad Leo will appear at the next ball; he is nearly nine years old, and it is good to accustom children of his rank early to these things.  Guizot's speech is exceedingly admired, with the exception of his having said more than he was justified to do about the right of search.[5] Our speech has been very difficult to frame; we should like to have mentioned our visits to France and Belgium, but it has been found impossible to do so; _France is_ mentioned, and it is the first time since 1834!  To-morrow we go up to Town \"pour ce bore,\" as the good King always said to me; whenever there were tiresome people to present he always said: \"Je vous demande pardon de ce _bore_.\"  I have had a tiresome though not at all violent cold which _I was_ alarmed might spoil the _sonorousness_ of my voice for the speech on Thursday, but it promises well now.  I own I always look with horror to the beginning of a Parliamentary campaign.  With Albert's love. Ever your devoted Niece,  VICTORIA R.

Our promised visit, our dearest Papa's, and our fondest wish, all is put an end to. The violence of our grief may be over, but the desolate feeling which succeeds it is worse, and tears are a relief. I have never known real _grief_ till now, and it has made a lasting impression on me. A father is _such_ a _near_ relation, you are a _piece_ of him in fact,--and all (as my poor _deeply afflicted_ Angel says) the earliest pleasures of your life were given you by a dear father; that can _never be replaced_ though time may soften the pang. And indeed one loves to _cling_ to one's grief; I can understand Louise's feeling in her overwhelming sorrows.  Let me now join my humble entreaties to Albert's, relative to the request about dearest Louise, which he has made. It is a sacrifice I ask, but if you _knew_ the sacrifice I make in letting and urging Albert _to go_, I am sure, if you _can_ you _will_ grant it. I have _never_ been separated from him even for _one night_, and the _thought of such_ a separation is quite dreadful; still, I feel I _could_ bear it,--I have made up my mind to it, as the very _thought_ of going has been a comfort to my poor Angel, and will be of such use at Coburg. Still, if I were to remain _quite_ alone I do not think I _could_ bear it quietly. Therefore _pray_ do send me my dearly beloved Louise; she would be _such_ a comfort to me; if you could come too--or afterwards (as you promised us a longer visit), that would be still more delightful. I may be indiscreet, but you must think of _what_ the separation from my _all and all_, even only for a _fortnight_, will be to me!  We feel some _years_ older since these days of mourning. Mamma is calm, but poor Aunt Julia[7] is indeed much to be pitied. Ever, dearest Uncle, your devoted and unhappy Niece and Child,  VICTORIA R.      [Footnote 6: The Duke of Saxe-Coburg Gotha died on 29th     January.]      [Footnote 7: The Grand Duchess Constantine of Russia,     sister of the Duchess of Kent and of the deceased Duke of     Saxe-Coburg.]     [Pageheading: BEREAVEMENT]   _Queen Victoria to the King of the Belgians._  WINDSOR CASTLE, _13th February 1844._  MY DEAREST UNCLE,--I received your dear, kind but sad letter of the 8th on Sunday, and thank you much for it. God knows, poor dear Uncle, you have suffered _enough_ in your life, but you should think, dearest Uncle, of _that blessed_ assurance of _eternity_ where we shall _all meet again never_ to part; you should think (as we constantly do now) that those whom we have lost are far happier than we are, and _love us_ still, and in a far more perfect way than _we can_ do in this world! When the first moments and days of overwhelming grief are over these reflections are the greatest balm, the greatest consolation to the bleeding heart.  I hope you will kindly let me have a few lines of _hope_ by the Tuesday's messenger. Ever your truly devoted Niece and Child,  VICTORIA R.  _P.S._--O'Connell's being pronounced guilty is a great triumph.[8]      [Footnote 8: He had been indicted with Charles Gavan Duffy and     others for seditious conspiracy.]     _Viscount Melbourne to Queen Victoria._  SOUTH STREET, _3rd April 1844._  Lord Melbourne presents his humble duty to your Majesty, with many thanks for your Majesty's note of"]]]
