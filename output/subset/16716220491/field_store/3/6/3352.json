Since the preceding Christmas nothing had been heard of him. George, with an aching heart, stayed at home with an uncle, and chafed grievously as he saw company after company of militia pass through his native town on the way to the South. Where was his father? This he asked himself twenty times a day. And must he, the son, stand idly by whilst thousands of the flower of the land were rushing forward to fight on one side or the other in the great conflict? \"I must enlist!\" George had cried, more than once. \"Pshaw!\" replied his uncle; \"you are too young--a mere child.\" But one fine day George Knight had himself enrolled as a drummer boy in a regiment then being recruited in Cincinnati, and, as his uncle had a large family of his own, with no very strong affection to spare for his nephew, there was not as much objection as might have been expected. So the lad went to the war. He had now become a particular _protégé_ of General Mitchell, who had taken him into his own service as an assistant secretary--a position in which George had already shown much natural cleverness.  After reading the letter just brought to him, Andrews tears it into a hundred little pieces which he scatters to the winds.  \"What's the matter?\" ask several of the men, as they crowd around him.  \"Hurry's the matter,\" laughs the leader, as unconcernedly as if he were speaking of nothing more dangerous than a picnic. \"The General tells me we must start at once, if we want to accomplish anything. To-morrow [Tuesday] morning he takes his army straight south to Huntsville. If he captures the town by Friday, as he expects to do, he can move eastwards, to Chattanooga. So we will do our bridge-burning and our train-stealing on Friday, before the railroad is obstructed with trains bringing Confederate reinforcements to the latter city.\"  Even in the darkness one could detect the gleam in the eyes of the men as they saw before them, with pleasure rather than fear, the risky part they were to play in the drama of warfare. The eyes of George sparkled, likewise.  \"If I could only go with them,\" he thought. What was camp life compared to the delight of such an adventure? Waggie gave a bark. Even he seemed to scent something interesting.  \"You soldiers,\" continued Andrews, \"must break into detachments, make your way eastward into the Cumberland Mountains, and then southward, well into the Confederate lines. There you can take the cars, and by next Thursday night you must all meet me down at Marietta, Georgia. The next morning according to a plan which you will learn at Marietta, (which is on the Georgia State Railroad) we will put our little ruse into effect--and may providence smile on it.\"  \"But what will the men pretend to be while on their way down to Marietta?\" asked George, who could scarce contain either his curiosity or his enthusiasm.  \"Look here, my boy,\" said Andrews, in a quick though not in an unkindly way. \"I don't know that you should be hearing all this.\"  Had the scene been less dark one might have seen the flush on the boy's face.  \"I didn't think I was playing eavesdropper,\" he retorted.  Andrews put his right hand on George's shoulder. \"Come,\" he said, in a spirit of friendliness; \"I didn't exactly mean that. I know you're to be trusted, from what General Mitchell has said of you. But you must keep a tight rein on your tongue, and not say a syllable, even in camp, of this expedition. There's no reason why the whole army should be discussing it--until the thing's done. Then you can talk about it as much as you want.\"  George no longer felt offended. \"You can depend on me,\" he said manfully. \"I won't even tell the General.\"  At this there was a peal of laughter from the men, which seemed to be answered, the next instant, by a blinding fork of lightning, and then a fresh outburst of thunder. Andrews lifted up his hand warningly. He was very grave, as befitted a man on the verge of a mighty responsibility.  \"Not so loud,\" he protested. \"You boys must impersonate Kentuckians who are trying to get down south to join the Confederate army. A great many fellows have gone from Kentucky to throw in their lot with the Confederacy, and if you are prudent you will have no trouble in making people believe you. If any of you fall under suspicion on the way, and are arrested, you can enlist in the Confederate army, and then escape from it at the first opportunity. The Southerners are glad to get all the recruits they can, suspicious or otherwise. But I hope you will all reach Marietta in safety. Pray be careful of one thing. If you meet me as we are traveling, don't recognize me unless you are sure no one is watching us. At Marietta we will contrive to meet in the hotel near the railroad station, where I will tell you all that is to be done the next morning.\"  \"We have no money for the journey,\" interposed a young volunteer. \"Uncle Sam doesn't pay us privates very large salaries, you know, Mr. Andrews.\"  Andrews produced a large wallet from the inner pocket of his overcoat. It was fairly bulging with paper money.  \"I've seen to that,\" he explained. \"Here's a whole wad of Confederate currency which will pay your expenses through the Southern lines.\" And with that he began to deal out the bills to the men, who hastily stowed away the money in their own pockets.  \"Now, boys,\" went on the leader, \"I want you to divide yourselves into parties of three or four, so that you may travel in separate groups, and thus avoid the suspicion which might be aroused if you all went in a body. And remember! One party must have nothing to do with another.\"  Thereupon, in the gloomy woods, the future spies formed themselves, as their inclinations directed, into six parties or detachments, four containing three men each, and two containing four. Andrews was to proceed southward alone, without an escort. Poor George Knight and Waggie appeared to be left out in the cold. George was burning to join the expedition. Even the rain which suddenly began to fall could not quench his ardor.  \"Mr. Andrews,\" he said, coming up close to the leader, and speaking in a whisper, \"can't I go to Marietta, too?\"  Andrews peered at the boy in admiring surprise. \"By Jove,\" he answered, \"you're not afraid of danger, even if you are little more than a child. It's bad enough for grown men to risk their lives--and bad enough for me to drag them into such a position,--without getting a plucky boy into the scrape also. No! Don't ask me to do that.\"  \"But I won't be in any more danger in the South than I am here,\" pleaded George. \"If I stay here I may be shot in battle, while if I go to Marietta I----\"  \"If you go to Marietta, and are found out, you may be hanged as a spy,\" interrupted Andrews. \"I'd rather see you shot than strung up with a rope.\"  \"The Confederates would never hang me if I am little more than a child, as you call me,\" urged the lad.  Andrews was evidently impressed by George's persistence, but he hastened to say: \"Anyway, I have no authority to send you off on this chase. You are a member of General Mitchell's military household, and he alone could give you the permission.\"  \"Then promise me that if I get his permission you will let me go.\"  The spy hesitated. He could just discern the earnest, pleading expression in the upturned face of the boy, upon which the rain-drops were pouring almost unnoticed.  \"Well,\" he said, at last, \"I am going back to camp now, and I start out before daylight. If you can induce the General to let you accompany us before that time I'll make no objection.\"  George gave a little exclamation of delight. \"Come,\" he said, snapping his fingers at Waggie, \"let us see what we can do to talk the old General into it.\"  The rain was now coming down in torrents, while the sharp, almost deafening cracks of thunder sounded as if the whole artillery of the Union army were engaged in practice. Soon all the conspirators were hurrying back to camp. Andrews was the very last to leave the woods where he had divulged his plans.  \"Heaven forgive me,\" he mused, half sadly, \"if I am leading these boys into a death trap.\" But as a sudden flash of lightning illuminated the wet landscape, as with the brightness of day, there came into the leader's strong face a look of calm resolution. \"It's worth all the danger,\" he added.                     *       *       *       *       *  An hour later George Knight came running into the tent which Andrews occupied in the camp on Duck River. The leader was enveloped in a woolen overcoat, and on his well-shaped head was a slouch hat of the kind generally worn by Southerners. By the dim, sickly light of the candle which sputtered on a camp stool it could be seen that he had been writing, for pen, ink and a sealed letter were spread out upon the top of a leathern army trunk.  \"Well,\" cried Andrews, picking up the candle from its tin socket and flashing it in the radiant face of the boy. \"Ah! No need to ask you! I see by your dancing eyes that you have wheedled old Mitchell into allowing you to do a foolish thing.\"  The smile on the lad's face vanished. \"Don't you want me to go along with you?\" he asked, in an injured tone.  The leader replaced the candle in the socket and then took one of George's hands between his own strong palms. \"George,\" he said cordially, \"you're a boy after my own heart, and I'd like nothing better than to have you for a companion; but it's because I do like you that I'm sorry you are about to run such a risk--and that's the truth. How did you contrive to persuade the General?\"  George seated himself on Andrews' bed, and laughed. \"It was hard work at first,\" he explained, \"but after he had refused me twice I said to him: 'General, if you were a boy in my place, and had heard of this expedition, what would you do?' 'By all the stars,' he said, 'I would run away to"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26892"],["title","Chasing an Iron Horse (#2)"],["body","rather than miss it--and get shot afterwards as a deserter, I suppose.' 'Then don't put me under the temptation of running away,' said I. At this the General laughed. Then he said: 'Well, tell Andrews you can go--and that I'll never forgive him if he lets anything happen to you. After all, the Confederates would never hang a child like you.'\"  \"So he too calls you a child!\" laughed Andrews.  \"Of course I'm not a child,\" cried George proudly, as he jumped from the bed and stood up very straight, to make himself look as tall as possible; \"but the General may call me a six-weeks' old baby if he only lets me go along with you.\"  \"There is no time to waste,\" announced Andrews. \"In the third tent from mine, to the right, you will find Privates Macgreggor and Watson, of the Second Ohio Volunteers. They have just offered to go with us, and I have accepted them in addition to the rest. Go to them, ask them to get you a suit of plain clothes, put it on instead of your uniform, and stick to them closely from the moment you leave camp until you meet me, as I hope you will, at Marietta. And be particularly careful to have nothing about you which could in any way lead to your identification as a Union soldier in case you should be arrested and searched.\"  \"Hurrah!\" said George, half under his breath.  \"May we all be hurrahing this time next week,\" returned Andrews. \"Here, George, as you go out give this letter to the sentry outside, to be sent off to-morrow in the camp mail.\" As he spoke he took the sealed note from the army trunk, and handed it to the boy. \"It is written to the young woman I am engaged to marry,\" he explained, \"and if we all get out of this bridge-burning business with our heads on our shoulders you can come dance at my wedding, and be my best man.\"  \"I'd dance at twenty weddings for you,\" enthusiastically cried George, who was beginning to have a great admiration for his new friend.  \"You don't want me to be married twenty times, do you, my boy?\" protested Andrews, smiling.  \"I would do a great deal to oblige you,\" retorted George. Then, after warmly grasping his leader by the hand, he bounded out of the tent. The night was black, and the rain was still descending in a veritable torrent, but to the lad everything seemed clear and rosy. He only saw before him a mighty adventure--and that, to his ardent, youthful spirit, made the whole world appear charming.     CHAPTER II  NEARING THE GOAL   It was the Thursday afternoon succeeding the Monday night described in the former chapter. On the north bank of the Tennessee River, not far from the town of Jasper, three drenched figures might be discerned. They were looking somewhat longingly in the direction of a white frame house not fifty yards away from the stream, which, swollen by the recent storms, was in a particularly turbulent mood. There was nothing very attractive about the building save that it suggested shelter from the rain without, and that the smoke curling up from its large chimney held forth vague hopes of a palatable supper. Certainly there was little in the landscape itself to tempt any one to remain outdoors. The three wanderers seemed to be of this opinion, for they suddenly made a move towards the house. They were roughly dressed, their clothes were soaking, and their high boots bore the evidence of a long, muddy tramp across country.  \"Well,\" grumbled one of them, a thick-set, middle-aged man, with a good-humored expression and a four-days' growth of iron-gray beard on his face; \"why did I leave home and home cooking to enlist in the army and then wander over the earth like this?\"  \"Mr. Watson!\" exclaimed the person next to him, in a tone of boyish surprise; \"how can you talk like that? Why, _I_ am having the time of my life.\"  The speaker was George Knight. There was mud on his face, and the natty drummer boy in blue uniform had given place to a young fellow who outwardly resembled an ordinary farm hand. But there could be no doubt, from the light which shone in his bright eyes, that he was enjoying himself to the full.  \"Humph!\" returned Watson. \"When you get as old as I am, my boy, you won't take such keen delight in walking through mire.\"  The boy laughed, and turned to the third member of the party. \"Are you tired, too, Macgreggor?\" he asked.  Macgreggor, a compactly built, athletic young man of twenty-seven or thereabouts, with a light-brown beard and mustache which made him look older than he really was, shook the rain from his hat and said cheerily, \"I've done a good deal of mountain climbing since Tuesday morning, but I'm not too tired to eat a good supper, if we are lucky enough to find one in this place.\"  It need hardly be repeated that Watson and Macgreggor were the two men in whose care Andrews had placed George Knight. They were both brave, resourceful men. During their long trudge across the mountainous country between Shelbyville and the Tennessee, Watson had uttered many a grumble, but his complaints meant nothing more than a desire to hear himself talk. When it came to fording a stream, climbing a precipice, or fairly wading through the slush, he was quite as willing and energetic as the other two members of his party.  George knocked loudly at the door of the house, as he and his companions hastily sheltered themselves under the little piazza which ran along the front of the place.  \"Be on your guard, boys,\" whispered Watson. \"Stick to your story about our being Kentuckians, and say nothing imprudent that may arouse suspicion. Remember! we _must_ be in Marietta by to-morrow night.\"  The meeting at Marietta had, at the very last moment, been postponed by Andrews from Thursday night to Friday night. \"It is well he did postpone it,\" thought Macgreggor; \"we are far enough from Marietta as it is.\"  The door was suddenly thrown open by an old negro \"aunty\" behind whom stood a neat, bustling little white woman. The latter was evidently engaged in the business of preparing supper, if one might judge from the fact that her bare arms were almost encaked in flour.  \"We are three Kentuckians from Fleming County on our way to enlist in Chattanooga,\" spoke out Macgreggor, in a voice which seemed to have the ring of truth in it. \"Can we spend the night here, so that we can cross the river in the morning?\"  The expression of the woman, which had at first been one of surprise and irritation at being stopped in her work, softened immediately. \"Come in,\" she said, quickly; \"my husband's only a farmer, and we can't give you anything very fine, but it was never said of Mandy Hare that she turned away from her house any loyal friend of the South.\"  With that she led her gratified visitors through a scantily-furnished parlor into a kitchen which seemed to them like a Paradise. Over the roaring fire in the great hearth several vessels were simmering and emitting the most delightful odors, while a table near by was already set for the coming meal. On a chair facing the fire a fat, white cat was purring blissfully. The room was delightfully warm; the whole scene had an irresistible attraction and air of domesticity.  \"Make yourselves at home,\" commanded Mrs. Hare, cheerfully. \"My husband will be home from Jasper in a few minutes, and then you'll have something to eat--such as 'tis.\"  At this instant there was a querulous little bark, which appeared to come from the region of George Knight's heart. Mrs. Hare looked around in surprise; the white cat stirred uneasily. The next second the boy had shaken his overcoat, and from out of a large side pocket jumped the diminutive Waggie. The cat, with one bound, took a flying leap to the kitchen stairs, and brushing past the half-opened door at the bottom of the flight, fairly tore up to the second story, where she disappeared. Waggie gave a shrill yelp of emotion, but evidently concluded that it was safer not to chase a strange and muscular cat in a strange house.  \"Gracious me,\" cried Mrs. Hare; \"did you bring that little fellow all the way from Kentucky?\"  \"When I came away he followed me,\" replied George. He spoke the truth, although he did not add that he \"came away\" from a Union camp rather than from Kentucky. Waggie had been consigned to a member of General Mitchell's staff, to remain with him during his owner's absence, but George had not proceeded five miles on his journey before he heard a joyous bark behind him--and there frisked and capered Waggie. \"You'll have to turn spy now,\" George said. It was too late to send him back. Thus the dog joined the party, much to the pleasure of all concerned.  Hardly had Waggie made his theatrical entrance into the kitchen before a lean, prematurely shriveled man of fifty, whose long shaggy beard proclaimed him a veritable countryman, came shambling into the room. At sight of the three strangers a curious look came into his restless eyes. It was almost as if the look was one of triumph. George, observing it, shivered, although he could hardly say why he did so.  \"This is my husband,\" explained Mrs. Hare, with an awkward attempt at courtesy. \"These men,\" she continued, addressing her lord and master, \"have the good of the Southern cause at heart, and are on their way to Chattanooga, to enlist in the Confederate army.\" She cast such an approving glance upon the wanderers as she spoke, and was so good-natured, that George's heart smote him at the deception which was being practised upon her. He was a frank, honest boy, who hated the very idea of appearing anywhere under false pretences. But he realized that he was playing a part for the good of his General, and his General's cause, and he resolved to maintain, as well as he could, his new character of a Southern sympathizer.  Farmer Hare gave to each of the visitors a surly recognition. Waggie walked up to him, sniffed about his boots, and uttered a low growl. It was plain that the dog did not approve of the master of the house.  \"You fellows are taking a pretty long journey to serve the South,\" remarked Mr."]]]
