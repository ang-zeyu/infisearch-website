No sane man will say that the purchase of this property is practicable or possible. Fancy, if you please, the Negroes bought and paid for; the estates of all the people of this country involved in the vain chimera of transferring to our Southern States, in remuneration, all the coin in Europe and America, and all that will be added thereto in a hundred years to come, and you have a picture not very suggestive of practicability or expediency.  But, even if the citizens of our Southern States should magnanimously propose the totally improbable act of voluntary and gratuitous manumission of their slaves, for the purpose of elevating them to political equality, what would be the effect upon our country? Three millions and a half of Negroes let loose upon our community, in competition, in the main departments of industry, with free white labor. Or would you, in accordance with the legislation of many of the States, exclude the negro from the Northern, Middle, and Western States, and the Territories, and thus, by confining him to the South, give him political preponderance over the white man in many of the States of the Union? Imagine the pure crystal pillars of this temple of freedom turned to ebony; the radiant eyes of Freedom's Goddess shocked at the gloomy spectacle of symbolic night, and suffused with tears at such a desecration of her shrine!   GRADUAL OR PROSPECTIVE EMANCIPATION.  There is another popular idea of emancipation, which is unjust, fallacious, and impossible of application. It is known by the specious though plausible appellation of gradual or prospective emancipation; by which it is proposed to destroy, by legislation, the productiveness and the value of this species of property, after a limited period, by declaring the _confiscation of its increase_. This has been tried by mistaken philanthropy, or by organized duplicity, with no other effect but to transfer the slaves from State to State, and from the North to the South; but while this process has been going on, the number of slaves in the United States has increased more than four-fold,--from less than one to more than four millions. This is emancipation with a vengeance. In this ratio, prospective or gradual _emancipation_ would give us, in seventy years more, 16,000,000 slaves. It will be seen that this process is not emancipation, but merely transposition, or change of locality. The very name of emancipation, thus applied, is a misnomer.   OF PARTIAL LEGISLATION.  But of the injustice of that partial legislation which would discriminate against the property of one class of citizens, to destroy its value, by proposing the confiscation of its increase, or excluding it from the State,--this is oppression. It may be submitted to, but it is unjust, partial legislation, and an arbitrary act of tyranny, and if persisted in will, some day, lead to war. Besides, it does not effect the purpose intended. It does not diminish slavery, but only changes its locality. What would be said if it were attempted to invalidate any other species of property, by the confiscation of its increase, or an attempt to legislate it out of the State? To declare by legislation a forfeiture of rents of houses or lands, after a specified period, or the increase of any species of stocks, or other property? What is this but agrarianism? what but the first blow of the _levelers_? And if this is done with impunity, how long before some other species of property, in the shape of fancied _superfluous_ individual wealth, will also be confiscated? There is no safety in establishing such a precedent.   PURPOSES OF BRITISH EMANCIPATION.  Emancipation contemplates the social and political equality of the races. It proposes to mix the pure Anglo-Saxon blood with the dark blood of Ethiopia! It proposes the amalgamation of civilization with barbarism. It proposes the debasement and downfall of this Republic, and the erection upon its ruins of a mighty military despotism. The alienation of that friendly sentiment and brotherly affection which existed among our people in the days of the Revolution, is prophetic of this; and unless reason resume her seat, and the convulsed sea of American mind, now lashed to fury by blind zealots and European emissaries among us, be calmed, and the angry wave of fanaticism be stayed, such will most certainly be the sad and startling consummation.   OF THE RIGHT TO ENSLAVE THE BARBARIAN.  It is pretended by certain sophists and visionary theorists, that the RIGHT does not exist to enslave the barbarian; that to assert such right is fatal to the principle of human equality. To which I answer, that barbarity is not humanity, but its opposite, and the right of the one to control the other is supported by law, founded upon the immutable principles of justice. The experience of mankind has demonstrated, and the judgment of mankind has decided, that certain acts are wrong in themselves; that to kill is an act abhorrent to the soul of man, and as it is also a violation of natural right, the murderer shall die--that in his death an element of chaos and destruction, in him, is annihilated--and the principle or element of murder in the wicked be thereby repressed. Here is an instance wherein the right is asserted, to take, not only the liberty, but the life of an individual. Some deny this right, but they do not deny the right to deprive the murderer of his liberty. All will agree that the murderer shall, at least, be deprived of his liberty. So with other crimes. There is a tolerable agreement in civilized communities, that for certain crimes men shall be deprived of their natural right to freedom. So, the principle is established, that communities have the right to deprive men of their liberties. Laws are established and executed by this principle. Every State, and almost every small community, endorses this principle, and constantly illustrates it by the punishment of offenders against law, who are confined in jails and prisons. And it is folly to deny a right founded upon the universal usage and experience of mankind. So with nations. Did we not repress the wrong exercised against us by Mexico and Algeria? Did we not even deny the right of maritime isolation to Japan, on the score of cruelty or neglected hospitality to our shipwrecked mariners? Suppose she slay our ambassador, or our resident minister; would we not still further force upon her, in a summary manner, those well-known rules of law, and amenities of civilization, and principles of justice, which are proclaimed to be right by the united voice of nations?  We are considering the subject of the enslavement of the African race in this Republic. We are inquiring into the RIGHT of African Slavery. We have asserted the right of slavery, as founded upon the principle that universal right holds a just and hereditary control over wrong; and as the African is a race of barbarians, and barbarism is wrong, it follows that it is the right of civilization to hold the African subject to those rules of justice which pertain to civilization, and to protect him from the injustice, violence, and degradation, which are the concomitants of barbarism. To deny this is to deny the superiority of RIGHT over _wrong_. He who denies this, becomes the advocate of barbarism; for, barbarism being below civilization, he asserts its equality with civilization, and thus becomes its apologist and advocate.   VIOLATION OF NATURAL RIGHT.  Such an one will claim that involuntary labor performed by the African, in behalf of civilization; or the production, by his labor, of material or fabrics to hide his nakedness, or adorn the human race, or protect them from the cold, degrades the barbarian, because it encroaches upon his natural right to go naked and houseless, and perish with the cold. He is quite _primitive_ in his ideas of dress, and ought to emigrate to a warm climate, like South Africa or South America, where the elements of nature do not conspire with civilization to degrade and oppress him. He perceives that our unjust and oppressive laws actually punish, as an offense, the exposure to view of man's natural external beauties! This is about as far as it is safe to go on the subject of natural right, both from considerations of propriety and modesty, and also, as it almost amounts to a digression from the subject immediately under consideration; but we are merely following the advocate of emancipation, on the score of equality and natural right, just where his principles lead him; and as it forcibly suggests the inexpediency of emancipation, and consequent barbarism, on the score of morality and decency, it seems entirely apposite to the subject.  But it is claimed by some, that the African slave here has ceased to be a barbarian, which I deny. His nature is not essentially changed; his habits are forced; and he would at once fall, as he has fallen, and is falling, in San Domingo, Jamaica, and Canada, but for coercion. It is, therefore, an external power which holds him up, and no innate principle within him.   THE DEBT OF THE BARBARIAN.  But even for argument, admitting the African were civilized, still he is not legally entitled to his freedom. Why? Because on account of his barbarism he became the property of another, who has a vested right in him. His transition from barbarism to civilization was at the expense of civilization, and he owes a just equivalent therefor. His debt is the difference between barbarism and civilization, and will be estimated according as the one in held higher than the other.   THE RIGHT OF THE AFRICAN TO REMAIN A SLAVE.  If the African is entitled to his freedom, he is also entitled to the privilege of remaining in servitude; a privilege which nine tenths of the Negroes in this country are well known to crave. But we deny his right of choice in the premises. His barbarism was"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25281"],["title","Briefless Ballads and Legal Lyrics (#1)"],["body","y.  [D] The casual ejector was John Doe, who was, like Richard Roe, an entirely imaginary person, of much importance in the old action of ejectment abolished in 1852.  [E] The allusion is to the \"Advocates' Widows Fund,\" subscribed to by all members of the Scottish bar, married or unmarried. The non-existent widow of the unmarried advocate has been a frequent subject of legal verse. See \"The Bachelor's Dream,\" by John Rankine, (_Journal of Jurisprudence_, vol. xxii. p. 155), \"My Widow,\" by David Crichton (_id._ vol. xxiv. p. 51).     The Squire's Daughter       We crawled about the nursery       In tenderest years in tether,     At six we waded in the sea       And caught our colds together.      At ten we practised playing at       A kind of heathen cricket,     A croquet mallet was the bat,       The Squire's old hat the wicket.      At twelve, the cricket waxing slow,       With home-made bow and arrow     We took to shooting--once I know       I all but hit a sparrow.      She took birds' nests from easy trees,       I climbed the oaks and ashes,     'Twas deadly work for hands and knees,       Deplorable for sashes.      At hide and seek one summer day       We played in merry laughter,     'Twas then she hid her heart away,       I never found it after.      So time slipped by until my call,       For out of the professions     I chose the Bar as best of all,       And joined the Loamshire Sessions.      The reason for it was that there       Her father, short and pursy,     Doled out scant justice in the chair       And even scanter mercy.      As Holofernes lost his head       To Judith of Bethulia,     So I fell victim, but instead       Of Judith it was Julia.      My speech left juries in the dark,       Of Julia I was thinking,     And once I heard a coarse remark       About a fellow drinking.      I practised verse in leisure time       Both in and out of season,     It was indubitably rhyme,       Occasionally reason.      I lacked the cheek to tell my woes,       Had not concealment fed on     My damask cheek, but left my nose       With twice its share of red on?      Too horrible was this suspense,       At last, in desperation     I went to Loamshire on pretence       Of death of a relation.      The Squire was beaming; \"Julia's gone       To London for a visit,     But with a wedding coming on       That's not surprising, is it?      \"Old friends like you will think, no doubt,       That she is young to marry,     But ever since she first came out,       She's been engaged to Harry.\"     Her Letter in Chambers       I sat by the fire and watched it blaze,       And dreamed that she wrote me a letter,     And for that dream to the end of my days       To Fancy I owe myself debtor.      Next day there came the postman's knock,       The morning was bright and sunny,     And showed me a sheaf of circulars, stock       Attempts to get hold of my money.      'Mid correspondence of this dull kind       A dainty notelet lay hidden,     It seemed as though it had half a mind       To consider itself forbidden.      The writing was like herself, complete,       With a touch of her queenly bearing,     So Venus wrote when she ordered in Crete       Her doves to take her an airing.      Inside it was just as promising,       'Twas a pressing invitation     To dine at her house to-morrow, and bring       My book for her approbation.      For I have published, be it confessed,       A little volume of verses,     And in the volume whatever is best       The praise of herself rehearses.      I sit by the fire, and again I dream       A happier dream than ever,     I see her beautiful eyes soft gleam       As she murmurs, \"How lovely--how clever!\"      Her criticism may be commonplace,       But who can be angry after     Now sweet with pity he marks her face,       Now bright with impulsive laughter?     Law and Poetry       In days of old did law and rime       A common pathway follow,     For Themis in the mythic time       Was sister of Apollo.      The Hindu statutes tripped in feet       As daintily as Dryads,     And law in Wales to be complete       Was versified in triads.      The wise Alfonso of Castile       Composed his code in metre     Thereby to make its flavour feel       A little bit the sweeter.      But law and rime were found to be       A trifle inconsistent,     And now in statutes poetry       Is wholly non-existent.      Still here and there some advocate       Before his fellows know it     Has had bestowed on him by fate       The laurel of the poet.      Let him who has been honoured so,       In truth a _rara avis_,     Find precedents in Cicero       And our Chief Justice Davis;      And more than all in Cino; he,       So plaintive a narrator     Of fair Selvaggia's cruelty,       Won fame as a glossator.      Let him remember Thomas More       And Scott and Alciatus,     And Grotius with an ample store       Of most divine afflatus.      But let him, if his bread and cheese       Depend on his profession,     Bethink him that the art of these       Was not their sole possession.      The stream that flows from Helicon       Is scarcely a Pactolus,     A richer prize is theirs who con       Dull treatises on _dolus_.      'Tis well that some bold spirits dare       To cut themselves asunder     From bonds of law like old Molière,       While lawyers gaze in wonder.      The world had been a poorer place       Had Goethe lived by pleading     Or Tasso won a hopeless case       With Ariosto leading.     Somewhere       Somewhere in a distant star,     Cities of Cocaigne there are,     Paradises of the Bar.      Somewhere 'neath another sun     Counsel cease to see the fun     Lurking in a judge's pun.      Somewhere courts are fair to see,     Beauty joins utility,     Ushers answer courteously.      Somewhere there are bailiwicks     Which for dock defences fix     Nothing under three-five-six.      Somewhere rises struggle sore     For revisorships no more,     Every shire has half a score.      Somewhere educated thought     Scientifically taught     Cross-examines as it ought.      Somewhere judgments are obeyed,     Executions are not stayed,     Fees are almost always paid.      Somewhere County Councils press     Banquets on the circuit mess,     Fleshpots in the wilderness.      Somewhere at Assizes grow     Prosecutions row on row,     Every man has six or so.      Somewhere, eager but for right,     Court and counsel cease to cite     Pointless cases recondite.      Somewhere headnotes give the ground     Whereupon the judges found     Judgments generally sound.      Somewhere juries use their sense,     Basing on the evidence     Verdicts of intelligence.      Somewhere rich embroideries     Woven cunningly of lies     Part in twain at truth's clear eyes.      Somewhere justice grows from wrong,     Till the right that suffered long     Sings at last its triumph song.      Somewhere--even in a place     Peopled by a perfect race--     One side holds a losing case.      Somewhere since the world began     Heaven hath made an honest man,     Somewhere in Aldebaran.     Roman Law       I am a \"coach\" in Roman law by fate,       But Nature must have meant me for a poet,     And while I struggle with a rule or date,       Poetic thoughts intrude before I know it.      The changing sunshine on the summer sea       Drives forth the law of _cessio bonorum_,     _Peculium castrense_ speaks to me       Of Horace and his _Dulce et decorum_.      I see the matine bee among the flowers       Instead of _testamentum militare_,     And wander far away from agent's powers       To picture me again some Maud or Mary.      In truth there is no sequence in the thought,       Why should the title _De Societate_     Suggest, not trading partners, as it ought,       But visions of my last night's valse with Katie?      But worse than this, when I have done my task,       Stern law again asserts her domination,     'Tis cruel 'mid the new-mown hay to bask,       And find one's mind is running on novation;      Or in the dusk, when glow-worms light the moss,       To hear the distant voice of Philomela     Expound the three varieties of _dos_       And wax right eloquent about _tutela_.      I had a little respite yesterday,       Dining with one who well knew how to dine us,     But when I slept, the charm soon fled away,       I dreamed I was a _prætor peregrinus_.      Dismasted in the deep of law I lie,       A poor reward it is to stand confessed as     The Virgil of the interdict _de vi_,       The Petrarch of the _patria potestas_.     Bologna       I go from colonnade to colonnade       In streets that Dante trod, and past the towers       Aslant toward heaven, and listen to the hours     Chimed by the bells of choirs where Dante prayed.     They cease; then lo! the foot of time seems stayed       Five hundred years and more, I find me bowers       Where sweet and noble ladies weave them flowers     For one who reads Boccaccio in the shade.     The cowlèd students halt by two and threes       To hear the voice come thrilling through the trees,       Then tear themselves away to themes more trite.     Anon I mark the diligent hands that turn       Unlovely parchment scrolls whereby to learn       The beauty of inexorable right.     A Garden Party in the Temple       On hospitable thoughts intent     To me the Inner Temple sent           An invitation,     A garden party 'twas to be,     And I accepted readily           And with elation;     Good reason too, but oft the seeds     Of reason flower in senseless deeds.      I stood as savage as a bear,     For not a human being there           Knew I from Adam     I heard around in various tones,     \"_So_ glad to see you, Mr. Jones;\"           \"Good morning, Madam.\"     It seemed so painfully absurd     To stand and never speak a word.      I brought my doom upon myself,     And there I was upon the shelf           In melancholy.     "]]]
