This is the duty we owe to God. (_b_) Again, God being our merciful Preserver, we have to seek the protection of Him and Him alone. This is the duty we owe to ourselves. (_c_) Finally, God being our Judge or Ruler, we have to solicit guidance of Him and Him alone. This is the duty we owe to our fellow-creatures (including lower animals) in the world we live in.  You must not fall into the error of believing that God is Creator at one time or place, that He is Maintainer or Preserver at another time or place, and that He is Judge or Ruler at a third time or place. No, no; He, being the One and only God, is all the three together, Creator, Preserver and Ruler, at all times and in all places. It is we who, in order to understand Him properly and adore Him rightly, separate in our minds His three principal attributes, and think of Him as our Creator _when_ we worship Him, think of Him as our Preserver _when_ we seek His protection, and think of Him as our Ruler or Judge _when_ we solicit His guidance. It is only we, finite and conditioned creatures, that are tied down to and limited by time, place and circumstances. To God there are none such. He is the One Infinite and Absolute, the One who hath neither beginning nor end--the One who is absolutely unlimited and unconditioned by time, place, circumstances, or anything else. This is the Islamic conception or idea of God.  _3rdly_.--What does the Sura teach us as to the guidance which we have to ask of God in our dealings with our fellow-creatures? It is guidance into the straight path. What is the straight path? It is the path of righteousness or the path of _Grace_ which is between two extremes, the path of _Sin_ and the path of _Error_. A Muslim's right path, _i.e._, his right course of conduct, lies between two extreme paths or courses of conduct, _viz._, on the one hand, the path of those who sin, who knowingly and deliberately go against the will of God, which is manifest in Nature, and on the other hand, the path of those who unwittingly, through ignorance, go against His will. The right path lies thus:--   _Path of Sin_ }  _Path of Grace_  {  _Path of Error_               }                   { which leads   }  which leads to   {   which leads to to ruin or    }  eternal bliss.   {   confusion worse destruction.  }                   {   confounded.  You thus see that _true_ Islam consists in a threefold duty to God, to oneself, and to others, and this duty is to be discharged by simply adopting, under God's guidance, _the mean between two extremes_. As our Prophet has pithily expressed it [Arabic: khair ul umoor-e ausatiha], \"the best of things is the medium thing.\" This is the fundamental principle which underlies everything which is Islamic or Muslim.[26] Please remember it, as also the three-fold Islamic Duty:--    (_a_) Duty to God, which is Worship or Adoration implying,           as it does, complete submission to His will = [Arabic:           islām]    (_b_) Duty to yourself, which is self-preservation or           self-perfection = [Arabic: Aslām]    (_c_) Duty to others, which is peace and good will towards           them = [Arabic: islām]  \"Islam\"[27] as a religion means nothing more nor less than those three duties.  Islam is not Philosophy, much less is it Science. It is but a Religion, _an attitude of man's mind towards his environment_--the attitude of self towards others and God. Both Philosophy and Science influence one's attitude of mind. To that extent Islam has to reckon with both. It is therefore that Sufis and other philosophic sects have risen in Islam from time to time. The sphere of Islam is Faith manifesting itself in good works; and the spheres of Science and Philosophy are Knowledge and Reason. The latter often come into contact with the former, but can never be identified with it.     +Note 5.+  _What is not Islam._   In my previous Note I tried to sketch briefly what is true Islam. I now offer a few observations on, or illustrations of, what is _not_ Islam. In order to know anything quite well, it is desirable not only to know _what it is_ but also to know _what it is not_.  1. The religion taught by the Qur'an and the Traditions [Arabic: ahādith] of our Prophet is _Islam_ and not \"Muhammadanism,\" as it is often named. Those who profess Islam are _Muslims_ and not \"Muhammadans,\" as they are called. The word \"Musalman\" is but a corruption of the Arabic plural [Arabic: muslimūn/muslimīn] of the singular [Arabic: Muslim]. We and our religion have been called[28] after the name of Muhammad just as the terms Christians and Christianity have been derived from the name Christ. But \"Muhammadanism\" and \"Muhammadans\" are not at all the correct names of \"Islam\" and \"Muslims\" as you will presently see.[29]   2. From the point of view of Islam, all religions may be divided thus:                      Religions are either,                               |               |---------------|---------------|               |                               | _False_: being beliefs}          {_True_: being beliefs in more gods than     } or       {in one and only God; one,                  }          {and True Religions (Paths of Sin)        }          {are either,                                       |                            +----------|----------+                            |                     |                  _Pure_, such as    }    {_Mixed_, such as                   true Islam        }    {religions which                   unmixed with any  }    {mix up inconsistent                   inconsistent      } or {ideas with                   ideas.            }    {the idea of                                     }    {one God.                   (Paths of Grace)  }    {(Paths of Error)  Observe that a pure Religion, such as true Islam, comes in between false Religions and mistaken or mixed Religions, just as the Quranic Path of Grace lies between the Path of Sin and the Path of Error. It is the mean between two extremes.  3. It is not Islam to believe that there has been no true religion besides Islam.[30] Such an erroneous belief leads to intolerance, thereby begetting bigotry and fanaticism [Arabic: taa'ssub]. It is contrary to the teaching of the Qur'an and the Prophet. The first verse of the second Sura [Arabic: Baqrah = ʾ-l-m] commands us to believe in not only what was revealed to Muhammad but also in what was revealed to those who went before him. It clearly indicates that there are, and will ever be, many true religions of which Islam is one. Almost the first saying of our Prophet reported in collections of his traditions [Arabic: ahaadith] is \"whoever says 'there is no god but God,' will attain Salvation\" _i.e._, will obtain eternal bliss. This shews clearly that all religions which inculcate belief in one God are true religions--are right Paths of Grace which lead to eternal bliss. Observe that most Muhammadans (not Muslims) of to-day have forgotten this principle and have therefore become intolerant fanatics,[31] which accounts largely for the loss of political power of most Muhammadan Governments of modern times.  4. Neither is it Islam to believe that all religions are true. Such an erroneous belief leads to indifference, thereby begetting caprice and impiety. It is obviously contrary to the teaching of the Qur'an and the Prophet, for they both denounce many a false religion. If everybody thinks that every religion is true, there will be no two men professing the same religion, and there will be no real agreement between their thoughts and actions. Co-operation[32] [Arabic: ittifāq wa ittihād] among men (which is the root of Family, Society and State) would tend to become impossible. Note that it is the indifference to religion and the consequent impiety of some of the Muhammadans of to-day that accounts mostly for their lack of co-operation, and for their loss of political power in modern times. Degradation is the lot of _faithless_ Muslims, for as the Qur'an says, \"Ye will be exalted only if ye be faithful Muslims.\"  From what has been said you can easily infer that we should adopt the mean between two extremes and must therefore believe that neither are all religions true nor are they all false, but that _some religions_ are true and that Islam is one of them. The characteristic mark of true religions is belief in one God; and this indeed is the reason why Muslims are permitted to eat and live with, and even marry, Jewesses, Christians and others who believe in one God and possess sacred Scriptures.  5. I, for one, would not hesitate to call all Monotheists (Jews, Christians, and other Unitarians [Arabic: muwahiddin]) _Muslims_, because they believe in one God: but I would not call them _Momins_ [Arabic: Momins,], because they do not believe in one God in accordance with the teaching of our Prophet. You know that our Creed [Arabic: kalimah] consists of two parts:--     (i) There is no god but God,   (ii) And Muhammad is His Messenger.  Those who believe in the first part are Muslims ([Arabic: Muslim ] = the peaceful)[33] and those who believe in the first as well as the second part of the Creed are Momins ([Arabic: Mumins ] = the faithful). Both Muslims and Momins are believers in one God; the only difference between them is that Muslims may not (like Momins) accept Muhammad as their guide in the belief. The Qur'an (iii. 83) defines Islam thus:--    Say ye; We believe in God, and that which hath been sent   down (revealed) to us, and that which hath been sent down   to"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25267"],["title","Astronomy for Amateurs (#1)"],["body"," glimmer of twilight, than the contemplation of that grand and silent spectacle of the stars stepping forth in sequence in the vast Heavens? All sounds of life die out upon the earth, the last notes of the sleepy birds have sunk away, the Angelus of the church hard by has rung the close of day. But if life is arrested around us, we may seek it in the Heavens. These incandescing orbs are so many points of interrogation suspended above our heads in the inaccessible depths of space.... Gradually they multiply. There is Venus, the white star of the shepherd. There Mars, the little celestial world so near our own. There the giant Jupiter. The seven stars of the Great Bear seem to point out the pole, while they slowly revolve around it.... What is this nebulous light that blanches the darkness of the heavens, and traverses the constellations like a celestial path? It is the Galaxy, the Milky Way, composed of millions on millions of suns!... The darkness is profound, the abyss immense.... See! Yonder a shooting star glides silently across the sky, and disappears!...  Who can remain insensible to this magic spectacle of the starry Heavens? Where is the mind that is not attracted to these enigmas? The intelligence of the amateur, the feminine, no less than the more material and prosaic masculine mind, is well adapted to the consideration of astronomical problems. Women, indeed, are naturally predisposed to these contemplative studies. And the part they are called to play in the education of our children is so vast, and so important, that the elements of Astronomy might well be taught by the young mother herself to the budding minds that are curious about every issue--whose first impressions are so keen and so enduring.  Throughout the ages women have occupied themselves successfully with Astronomy, not merely in its contemplative and descriptive, but also in its mathematical aspects. Of such, the most illustrious was the beautiful and learned Hypatia of Alexandria, born in the year 375 of our era, public lecturer on geometry, algebra, and astronomy, and author of three works of great importance. Then, in that age of ignorance and fanaticism, she fell a victim to human stupidity and malice, was dragged from her chariot while crossing the Cathedral Square, in March, 415, stripped of her garments, stoned to death, and burned as a dishonored witch!  Among the women inspired with a passion for the Heavens may be cited St. Catherine of Alexandria, admired for her learning, her beauty and her virtue. She was martyred in the reign of Maximinus Daza, about the year 312, and has given her name to one of the lunar rings.  Another celebrated female mathematician was Madame Hortense Lepaute, born in 1723, who collaborated with Clairaut in the immense calculations by which he predicted the return of Halley's Comet. \"Madame Lepaute,\" wrote Lalande, \"gave us such immense assistance that, without her, we should never have ventured to undertake this enormous labor, in which it was necessary to calculate for every degree, and for a hundred and fifty years, the distances and forces of the planets acting by their attraction on the comet. During more than six months, we calculated from morning to night, sometimes even at table, and as the result of this forced labor I contracted an illness that has changed my constitution for life; but it was important to publish the result before the arrival of the comet.\"  This extract will suffice for the appreciation of the scientific ardor of Madame Lepaute. We are indebted to her for some considerable works. Her husband was clock-maker to the King. \"To her intellectual talents,\" says one of her biographers, \"were joined all the qualities of the heart. She was charming to a degree, with an elegant figure, a dainty foot, and such a beautiful hand that Voiriot, the King's painter, who had made a portrait of her, asked permission to copy it, in order to preserve a model of the best in Nature.\" And then we are told that learned women can not be good-looking!...  The Marquise du Châtelet was no less renowned. She was predestined to her career, if the following anecdote be credible. Gabrielle-Émilie de Breteuil, born in 1706 (who, in 1725, was to marry the Marquis du Châtelet, becoming, in 1733, the most celebrated friend of Voltaire), was four or five years old when she was given an old compass, dressed up as a doll, for a plaything. After examining this object for some time, the child began angrily and impatiently to strip off the silly draperies the toy was wrapped in, and after turning it over several times in her little hands, she divined its uses, and traced a circle with it on a sheet of paper. To her, among other things, we owe a precious, and indeed the only French, translation of Newton's great work on universal gravitation, the famous Principia, and she was, with Voltaire, an eloquent propagator of the theory of attraction, rejected at that time by the Académie des Sciences.  Numbers of other women astronomers might be cited, all showing how accessible this highly abstract science is to the feminine intellect. President des Brosses, in his charming Voyage en Italie, tells of the visit he paid in Milan to the young Italian, Marie Agnesi, who delivered harangues in Latin, and was acquainted with seven languages, and for whom mathematics held no secrets. She was devoted to algebra and geometry, which, she said, \"are the only provinces of thought wherein peace reigns.\" Madame de Charrière expressed herself in an aphorism of the same order: \"An hour or two of mathematics sets my mind at liberty, and puts me in good spirits; I feel that I can eat and sleep better when I have seen obvious and indisputable truths. This consoles me for the obscurities of religion and metaphysics, or rather makes me forget them; I am thankful there is something positive in this world.\" And did not Madame de Blocqueville, last surviving daughter of Marshal Davout, who died in 1892, exclaim in her turn: \"Astronomy, science of sciences! by which I am attracted, and terrified, and which I adore! By it my soul is detached from the things of this world, for it draws me to those unknown spheres that evoked from Newton the triumphant cry: '_Coeli enarrant gloriam Dei!_'\"  Nor must we omit Miss Caroline Herschel, sister of the greatest observer of the Heavens, the grandest discoverer of the stars, that has ever lived. Astronomy gave her a long career; she discovered no less than seven comets herself, and her patient labors preserved her to the age of ninety-eight.--And Mrs. Somerville, to whom we owe the English translation of Laplace's Mécanique céleste, of whom Humboldt said, \"In pure mathematics, Mrs. Somerville is absolutely superior.\" Like Caroline Herschel, she was almost a centenarian, appearing always much younger than her years: she died at Naples, in 1872, at the age of ninety-two.--So, too, the Russian Sophie Kovalevsky, descendant of Mathias Corvinus, King of Hungary, who, an accomplished mathematician at sixteen, married at eighteen, in order to follow the curriculum at the University (then forbidden to unmarried women); arranging with her young husband to live as brother and sister until their studies should be completed. In 1888 the Prix Bordin of the Institut was conferred on her.--And Maria Mitchell of the United States, for whom Le Verrier gave a _fête_ at the Observatory of Paris, and who was exceptionally authorized by Pope Pius IX to visit the Observatory of the Roman College, at that time an ecclesiastical establishment, closed to women.--And Madame Scarpellini, the Roman astronomer, renowned for her works on shooting stars, whom the author had the honor of visiting, in company with Father Secchi, Director of the Observatory mentioned above.  At the present time, Astronomy is proud to reckon among its most famous workers Miss Agnes Clerke, the learned Irishwoman, to whom we owe, _inter alia_, an excellent History of Astronomy in the Nineteenth Century;--Mrs. Isaac Roberts, who, under the familiar name of Miss Klumpke, sat on the Council of the Astronomical Society of France, and is D. Sc. of the Faculty of Paris and head of the Bureau for measuring star photographs at the Observatory of Paris (an American who became English by her marriage with the astronomer Roberts, but is not forgotten in France);--Mrs. Fleming, one of the astronomers of the Observatory at Harvard College, U.S.A., to whom we owe the discovery of a great number of variable stars by the examination of photographic records, and by spectral photography;--Lady Huggins, who in England is the learned collaborator of her illustrious husband;--and many others.         *       *       *       *       *  The following chapters, which aim at summing up the essentials of Astronomy in twelve lessons for amateurs, will not make astronomers or mathematicians of my readers--much less prigs or pedants. They are designed to show the constitution of the Universe, in its grandeur and its beauty, so that, inhabiting this world, we may know where we are living, may realize our position in the Cosmos, appreciate Creation as it is, and enjoy it to better advantage. This sun by which we live, this succession of months and years, of days and nights, the apparent motions of the heavens, these starry skies, the divine rays of the moon, the whole totality of things, constitutes in some sort the tissue of our existence, and it is indeed extraordinary that the inhabitants of our planet should almost all have lived till now without knowing where they are, without suspecting the marvels of the Universe.         *       *       *       *       *  For the rest, my little book is dedicated to a woman, muse and goddess--the charming enchantress Urania, fit companion of Venus, ranking even above her in the choir of celestial beauties, as purer and more noble, dominating with her clear glance the immensities of the universe.
