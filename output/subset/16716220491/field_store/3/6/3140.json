Too many other Bunches, now. Too much competition. Like companies starting up on the Moon not hiring ordinary help on Earth and shipping them out, anymore--saying contract guys don't stick. Nuts--it's because enough slobs save them the expense by showing up on their own... Or like most all of us trying to get into the Space Force. The _Real Elite_--sure. Only 25,000 in the Force, when there are over 200,000,000 people in the country to draw from. Just one guy from Jarviston--Harv Diamond--ever made it. Choosy? We can get old waiting for them to review our submitted personal data, only to have a chance to take their lousy tests!\"  Joe Kuzak grinned. \"So down with 'em--down with the worthy old U.S.S.F.! We're on our own--to Serenitatis Base on the Moon, to the Belt, Pallastown, and farther!\"  Ramos still hovered near Eileen Sands. \"What do you say, Sweetie?\" he asked. \"You haven't hardly made a comment.\"  Eileen remained tough and withdrawn. \"I'm just listening while you smart male characters figure out everything,\" she snapped. \"Why don't you become a listener, too, for a change, and go help Gimp out of that Archer?\"  Ramos bowed elegantly, and obeyed the latter half of her suggestion.  \"I have a premonition--a hunch,\" little Lester offered, trying to sound firm. \"Our request for a grant from the Extra-Terrestrial Development Board will succeed. Because we will be as valuable as anybody, Out There. Then we will have money enough to buy the materials to make most of our equipment.\"  Joe Kuzak, the gentler twin, answered him. \"You're right about one thing, Les. We'll wind up building most of our own stuff--with our own mitts...!\"  Some noisy conversation about who should try the Archer next, was interrupted when the antique customer's bell over the street door of the store, jangled. There was a scrape of shoe soles, as the two previously absent members of the Bunch, Jig Hollins and Charlie Reynolds, arriving together by chance, came into the shop.  Jig (Hilton) Hollins was a mechanic out at the airport. He was lean, cocky, twenty-four, with a stiff bristle of blond hair. Like Charlie Reynolds, he added up what had just been happening, here, at a glance. Both were older than the others. They had regular jobs. Their educations were completed, except for evening supplementary courses.  \"Well, the _men_ have arrived,\" Jig announced.  Maybe Charlie Reynolds' faint frown took exception to this remark. He was the only one in a suit, grey and tasteful, with a subdued flash to match the kind of car he drove. Few held this against him, nor the fact that he usually spent himself broke, nor the further fact that J. John Reynolds, tight-fisted president of the Jarviston First National Bank, was his grandfather. Charlie was an engineer at the new nuclear powerhouse, just out of town. Charlie was what is generally known as a Good Guy. He was brash and sure--maybe too sure. He had a slight swagger, balanced by a certain benignancy. He was automatically the leader of the Bunch, held most likely to succeed in their aims.  \"Hi, gang,\" he breezed. \"Otto is bringing beer, Pepsi and sandwiches from his joint across the street. Special day--so it's on me. Time to relax--maybe unsnarl. Any new problems?\"  \"Still plenty of old ones,\" Frank Nelsen commented laconically.  \"Has anybody suddenly decided to back out?\" Charlie chuckled. \"It's tiresome for me always to be asking that.\" He looked around, meeting carefully easy grins and grim expressions. \"Nope--I guess we're all shaggy folk, bent on high and wild living, so far. So you know the only answer we _can_ have.\"  \"Umhmm, Charlie,\" Art Kuzak, the tough, business-like twin, gruffed. \"We can get the Archers, now. I think Frank has our various sizes noted down. Let everybody sign up that wants an Archie. Better hurry, though--there'll be a run on them now that they're being almost given away... List all the other stuff we need--with approximate purchase price, or cost of construction materials, attached. Sure--we'll be way short of funds. But we can start with the items we can make, ourselves, now. The point is not to lose time. New restrictions may turn up, and give us trouble, if we do. We'll have to ride our luck for a break.\"  \"Hell--you know the lists are ready, Art,\" Frank Nelsen pointed out. \"A bubb for everybody--or the stuff to make it. Full-scale ionic drives, air-restorers and moisture-reclaimers, likewise. Some of the navigation instruments we'll almost have to buy. Dehydrated food, flasks of oxygen and water, and blastoff drums to contain our gear, are all relatively simple. Worst, of course, is the blastoff price, from one of the spaceports. Who could be rich enough to have a ground-to-orbit nuclear rocket of his own? Fifteen hundred bucks--a subsidized rate at that--just to lift a man and a thousand pounds of equipment into orbit. Five thousand dollars, minimum per person, is what we're going to need, altogether.\"  Gimp Hines, who always acted as if he expected to get off the Earth, too, had yielded his position inside the Archer to Tiflin, and had hobbled close.  \"The cost scares a guy who has to go to school, too, so he can pass the tests,\" he said. \"Well, don't worry, Frank. A thousand dollars buys a lot of stellene for bubbs. And we can scratch up a few bucks of our own. I can find a hundred, myself, saved from my TV repair work, and my novelties business. Charlie, here, ought to be able to contribute a thousand. Same for you, Hollins. That'll buy parts and materials for some ionic motors, too.\"  \"Oh, certainly, Gimp,\" Hollins growled.  But Charlie Reynolds grinned. \"I can kick in that much, if I hold down a while,\" he said. \"Maybe more, later. What we've got to have, however, is a loan. We can't expect a grant from the Board. Sure they want more people helping to develop resources in space, but they're swamped with requests. Let's not sweat, though. With a little time, I'll swing something... Hey, everybody! Proposition! I move that whoever wants an Archer put his name down for Frank. I further move that we have him order us a supply of stellene, and basic materials for at least three more ionic motors. I also suggest that everybody donate as much cash as he can, no matter how little, and as much time as possible for making equipment. With luck, and if we get our applications for space-fitness tests mailed to Minneapolis within a week, at least some of us should get off Earth by next June. Now, shall we sign for the whole deal?\"  Art Kuzak hunched his shoulders and displayed white teeth happily. \"I'm a pushover,\" he said. \"Here I come. I like to see things roll.\"  \"Likewise,\" said his brother, Joe. Their signatures were both small, in contrast to their size.  Ramos, fully clad in the Archer, clowned his way forward to write his name with great flourishes, his ball point clutched in a space glove.  Tiflin made a fierce, nervous scrawl.  Mitch Storey wrote patiently, in big, square letters.  Gimp chewed his lip, and signed, \"Walter Hines,\" in a beautiful, austere script, with a touch as fine as a master scientist's. \"I'll go along as far as they let me,\" he muttered.  \"I think it will be the same--in my case,\" David Lester stammered. He shook so much that his signature was only a quavering line.  \"For laughs,\" Eileen Sands said, and wrote daintily.  Two-and-Two Baines gulped, sighed, and made a jagged scribble, like the trail of a rocket gone nuts.  Jig Hollins wrote in swooping, arrogant circles, that came, perhaps, from his extra jobs as an advertising sky writer with an airplane.  Frank Nelsen was next, and Charlie Reynolds was last. Theirs were the most indistinctive signatures in the lot. Just ordinary writing.  \"So here we all are, on a piece of paper--pledged to victory or death,\" Reynolds laughed. \"Anyhow, we're out of a rut.\"  Nelsen figured that that was the thing about Charlie Reynolds. Some might not like him, entirely. But he could get the Bunch unsnarled and in motion.  Old Paul Hendricks had come back from waiting on some casual customers in the store.  \"Want to sign, too, Paul?\" Reynolds chuckled.  \"Nope--that would make thirteen,\" Paul answered, his eyes twinkling. \"I'll watch and listen--and maybe tell you if I think you're off beam.\"  \"Here comes Otto with the beer and sandwiches,\" Ramos burst out.  They all crowded around heavy Otto Kramer and his basket--all except Frank Nelsen and Paul Hendricks, and Eileen Sands who made the ancient typewriter click in the little office-enclosure, as she typed up the order list that Nelsen would mail out with a bank draft in the morning.  Nelsen had a powerful urge to talk to the old man who was his long-time friend, and who had said little all during the session, though he knew more about space travel than any of them--as much as anybody can know without ever having been off the Earth.  \"Hey, Paul,\" Frank called in a low tone, leaning his elbows across a workbench.  \"Yeah?\"  \"Nothing,\" Frank Nelsen answered with a lopsided smile.  But he felt that that was the right word, when your thoughts and feelings became too huge and complicated for you to express with any ease.  Grandeur, poetry, music--for instance, the haunting popular song, _Fire Streak_, about the burial of a spaceman--at orbital speed--in the atmosphere of his native planet. And fragments of history, such as covered wagons. All sorts of subjects, ideas and pictures were swirling inside his head. Wanting to sample everything in the solar system... Home versus the distance, and the fierce urge to build a wild history of his own... Gentleness and lust to be fulfilled, sometime. There would be a girl... And there were second thoughts to twist your guts and make you wonder if all your savage drives were foolish. But there was a duty to be equal to your era--helping to give dangerously crowded humanity on Earth more room, dispersal, a chance for race survival,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25076"],["title","Between the Lines (#1)"],["body","both left their dead sprawled in the trampled ooze or stayed to help their wounded crawling painfully back to cover.  Immediately the British set about rebuilding their shattered trench and parapet; but before they had well begun the spades had to be flung down again and the rifles snatched to repel another fierce assault.  This time a storm of bombs, hand grenades, rifle grenades, and every other fiendish device of high-explosives, preceded the attack.  The trench was racked and rent and torn, sections were solidly blown in, and other sections were flung out bodily in yawning crevasses and craters.  From end to end the line was wrapped in billowing clouds of reeking smoke, and starred with bursts of fire.  The defenders flattened themselves close against the forward parapet that shook and trembled beneath them like a live thing under the rending blasts.  The rifles still cracked up and down the line; but, in the main, the soaking, clay-smeared men held still and hung on, grimly waiting and saving their full magazines for the rush they knew would follow.  It came at last, and the men breathed a sigh of relief at the escape it meant from the rain of high-explosives.  It was their turn now, and the roar of their rifle-fire rang out and the bomb-throwers raised themselves to hurl their carefully-saved missiles on the advancing mass.  The mass reeled and split and melted under the fire, but fresh troops were behind and pushing it on, and once more it flooded in on the trench. . . .  Again the British trench had become German, although here and there throughout its length knots of men still fought on, unheeding how the fight had gone elsewhere in the line, and intent solely on their own little circle of slaughter.  But this time the German success was hardly made before it was blotted out.  The British supports had been pushed up to the disputed point, and as the remnants of the last defenders straggled back they met the fierce rush of the new and fresh force.  This time it was quicker work.  The trench by now was shattered and wrecked out of all real semblance to a defensive work.  The edge of the new attack swirled up to it, lipped over and fell bodily into it.  For a bare minute the defence fought, but it was overborne and wiped out in that time.  The British flung in on top of the defenders like terriers into a rat-pit, and the fighters snarled and worried and scuffled and clutched and tore at each other more like savage brutes than men.  The defence was not broken or driven out--it was killed out; and lunging bayonet or smashing butt caught and finished the few that tried to struggle and claw a way out up the slippery trench-sides.  Hard on the heels of the victorious attackers came a swarm of men running and staggering to the trench with filled sandbags over their shoulders.  As the front of the attack passed on over the wrecked trench and pressed the Germans back across the open, the sandbags were flung down and heaped scientifically in the criss-cross of a fresh breastwork.  Other men, laden with coils of wire and stakes and hammers, ran out in front and fell to work erecting a fresh entanglement.  In five minutes or ten--for minutes are hard to count and tally at such a time and in such work--the new defence was complete, and the fighters in the open ran back and leapt over into cover.  Once more a steady crackle of rifle-fire ran quivering up and down the line, and from their own trenches the Germans could see, in the light of the flares, a new breastwork facing them, a new entanglement waiting to trap them, a steady stream of fire spitting and sparkling along the line.  They could see, too, the heaped dead between the lines, and in their own thinned ranks make some reckoning of the cost of their attempt.  The attempt was over.  There were a few score dead lying in ones and twos and little clumped heaps in the black mud; the disputed trench was a reeking shambles of dead and wounded; the turn of the stretcher-bearers and the Red Cross workers had come.  There would be another column to add to the Casualty Lists presently, and another bundle of telegrams to be despatched to the 'Next of Kin.'  And to-morrow the official despatch would mention the matter coldly and tersely; and the papers would repeat it; and a million eyes would read with little understanding . . . 'changed hands several times, finally remaining in our possession.'     SHELLS  '_. . . to the right a violent artillery bombardment has been in progress._'--ACTUAL EXTRACT FROM OFFICIAL DESPATCH.   No. 2 Platoon of the Royal Blanks was cooking its breakfast with considerable difficulty and an astonishing amount of cheerfulness when the first shell fell in front of their firing trench.  It had rained most of the night, as indeed it had rained most of the past week or the past month.  All night long the men had stood on the firing step of the trench, chilled and miserable in their sodden clothing, and sunk in soft sticky mud over the ankles.  All night long they had peeped over the parapet, or fired through the loopholes at the German trench a hundred yards off.  And all night long they had been galled and stung by that 'desultory rifle fire' that the despatches mention so casually and so often, and that requires to be endured throughout a dragging day and night before its ugliness and unpleasantness can be realised.  No. 2 Platoon had two casualties for the night--a corporal who had paused too long in looking over the parapet while a star-shell flared, and 'caught it' neatly through the forehead, and a private who, in the act of firing through a loop-hole, had been hit by a bullet which glanced off his rifle barrel and completed its resulting ricochet in the private's eyes and head.  There were other casualties further along the trench, but outside the immediate ken of No. 2 Platoon, until they were assisted or carried past on their way to the ambulance.  Just after daybreak the desultory fire and the rain together had almost ceased, and No. 2 Platoon set about trying to coax cooking fires out of damp twigs and fragments of biscuit boxes which had been carefully treasured and protected in comparative dryness inside the men's jackets.  The breakfast rations consisted of Army bread--heavy lumps of a doughy elasticity one would think only within the range of badness of a comic paper's 'Mrs. Newlywed'--flint-hard biscuits, cheese, and tea.  'The only complaint against the rations bein' too much plum jam,' said a clay-smeared private, quoting from a much-derided 'Eye-witness' report as he dug out a solid streak of uncooked dough from the centre of his half-loaf and dropped it in the brazier.  Then the first shell landed.  It fell some yards outside the parapet, and a column of sooty black smoke shot up and hung heavily in the damp air.  No. 2 Platoon treated it lightly.  'Good mornin',' said one man cheerfully, nodding towards the black cloud.  'An' we 'ave not used Pears' soap.'  'Bless me if it ain't our old friend the Coal Box,' said another.  'We 'aven't met one of 'is sort for weeks back.'  'An' here's 'is pal Whistling Willie,' said a third, and they sat listening to the rise-and-fall whistling _s-s-sh-s-s-sh_ of a high-angle shell.  As the whistle rose to a shriek, the group of men half made a move to duck, but they were too late, and the shell burst with a thunderous bang just short of the front parapet.  Mud and lumps of earth splashed and rattled down into the trench, and fragments of iron hurtled singing overhead.  The men cursed angrily.  The brazier had been knocked over by a huge clod, half-boiling water was spilt, and, worst of all, the precious dry wood had fallen in the mud and water of the trench bottom.  But the men soon had other things than a lost breakfast to think of.  A shrapnel crashed overhead and a little to the right, and a sharp scream that died down into deep groans told of the first casualty.  Another shell, and then another, roared up and smashed into the soft ground behind the trench, hurting no one, but driving the whole line to crouch low in the narrow pit.  'Get down and lie close everyone,' shouted the young officer of No. 2 Platoon, but the 'crump-crump-crump' of another group of falling shells spoke sterner and more imperative orders than his.  For half an hour the big shells fell with systematic and regular precision along the line of the front trench, behind it on the bare ground, and further back towards the supports' trench.  The shooting was good, but so were the trenches--deep and narrow, and steep-sided, with dug-outs scooped under the bank and strong traverses localising the effect of any shell that fell exactly on the trench.  There were few casualties, and the Royal Blanks were beginning to congratulate themselves on getting off so lightly as the fire slackened and almost died away.  With the rest of the line No. 2 Platoon was painfully moving from its cramped position and trying to stamp and shake the circulation back into its stiffened limbs, when there came a sudden series of swishing rushes and sharp vicious cracks overhead, and ripping thuds of shrapnel across and across the trench.  The burst of fire from the light guns was excellently timed.  Their high velocity and flat trajectory landed the shells on their mark without any of the whistling rush of approach that marked the bigger shells and gave time to duck into any available cover.  The one gust of light shells caught a full dozen men--as many as the half-hour's work of the big guns.  Then the heavies opened again as accurately as before and twice as fast.  The trench began to yawn in wide holes, and its sides to crumble and collapse.  No. 2 Platoon occupied a portion of the trench that ran out in a blunted angle, and it caught the worst of the fire.  One shell falling just short of the front parapet dug a yawning hole and drove in the forward wall of the trench in a tumbled slide of mud and earth.  A dug-out and the two men occupying it"]]]
