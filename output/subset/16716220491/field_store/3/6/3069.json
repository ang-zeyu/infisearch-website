Automation at its ultimate, not even the steward department had tasks adequately to fill the hours.  He had got beyond the point of yawning, his mind was a blank during these hours of duty. He was a stolid, bear of a man, short and massive of build.  A voice behind him said, \"Second watch reporting. Request permission to take over the bridge.\"  Chessman turned and it took a brief moment for the blankness in his eyes to fade into life. \"Hello Kennedy, you on already? Seems like I just got here.\" He muttered in self-contradiction, \"Or that I've been here a month.\"  Technician Jerome Kennedy grinned. \"Of course, if you want to stay ...\"  Chessman said glumly, \"What difference does it make where you are? What are they doing in the lounge?\"  Kennedy looked at the screen, not expecting to see anything and accomplishing just that. \"Still on their marathon argument.\"  Joe Chessman grunted.  Just to be saying something, Kennedy said, \"How do you stand in the big debate?\"  \"I don't know. I suppose I favor Plekhanov. How we're going to take a bunch of savages and teach them modern agriculture and industrial methods in fifty years under democratic institutions, I don't know. I can see them putting it to a vote when we suggest fertilizer might be a good idea.\" He didn't feel like continuing the conversation. \"See you later, Kennedy,\" and then, as an afterthought, formally, \"Relinquishing the watch to Third Officer.\"  As he left the compartment, Jerry Kennedy called after him, \"Hey, what's the course!\"  Chessman growled over his shoulder, \"The same it was last month, and the same it'll be next month.\" It wasn't much of a joke but it was the only one they had between themselves.  In the ship's combination lounge and mess he drew a cup of coffee. Joe Chessman, among whose specialties were propaganda and primitive politics, was third in line in the expedition's hierarchy. As such he participated in the endless controversy dealing with overall strategy but only as a junior member of the firm. Amschel Mayer and Leonid Plekhanov were the center of the fracas and right now were at it hot and heavy.  Joe Chessman listened with only half interest. He settled into a chair on the opposite side of the lounge and sipped at his coffee. They were going over their old battlefields, assaulting ramparts they'd stormed a thousand times over.  Plekhanov was saying doggedly, \"Any planned economy is more efficient than any unplanned one. What could be more elementary than that? How could anyone in his right mind deny that?\"  And Mayer snapped, \"_I_ deny it. That term _planned economy_ covers a multitude of sins. My dear Leonid, don't be an idiot ...\"  \"I beg your pardon, sir!\"  \"Oh, don't get into one of your huffs, Plekhanov.\"  They were at that stage again.         *       *       *       *       *  Technician Natt Roberts entered, a book in hand, and sent the trend of conversation in a new direction. He said, worriedly, \"I've been studying up on this and what we're confronted with is two different ethnic periods, barbarism and feudalism. Handling them both at once doubles our problems.\"  One of the junior specialists who'd been sitting to one side said, \"I've been thinking about that and I believe I've got an answer. Why not all of us concentrate on Texcoco? When we've brought them to the Genoa level, which shouldn't take more than a decade or two, then we can start working on the Genoese, too.\"  Mayer snapped, \"And by that time we'll have hardly more than half our fifty years left to raise the two of them to an industrial technology. Don't be an idiot, Stevens.\"  Stevens flushed his resentment.  Plekhanov said slowly, \"Besides, I'm not sure that, given the correct method, we cannot raise Texcoco to an industrialized society in approximately the same time it will take to bring Genoa there.\"  Mayer bleated a sarcastic laugh at that opinion.  Natt Roberts tossed his book to the table and sank into a chair. \"If only one of them had maintained itself at a reasonable level of development, we'd have had help in working with the other. As it is, there are only sixteen of us.\" He shook his head. \"Why did the knowledge held by the original colonists melt away? How can an intelligent people lose such basics as the smelting of iron, gunpowder, the use of coal as a fuel?\"  Plekhanov was heavy with condescension. \"Roberts, you seem to have entered upon this expedition with a lack of background. Consider. You put down a hundred colonists, products of the most advanced culture. Among these you have one or two who can possibly repair an I.B.M. machine, but is there one who can smelt iron, or even locate the ore? We have others who could design an automated textile factory, but do any know how to weave a blanket on a hand loom?  \"The first generation gets along well with the weapons and equipment brought with them from Earth. They maintain the old ways. The second generation follows along but already ammunition for the weapons runs short, the machinery imported from Earth needs parts. There is no local economy that can provide such things. The third generation begins to think of Earth as a legend and the methods necessary to survive on the new planet conflict with those the first settlers imported. By the fourth generation, Earth is no longer a legend but a fable ...\"  \"But the books, the tapes, the films ...\" Roberts injected.  \"Go with the guns, the vehicles and the other things brought from Earth. On a new planet there is no leisure class among the colonists. Each works hard if the group is to survive. There is no time to write new books, nor to copy the old, and the second and especially the third generation are impatient of the time needed to learn to read, time that should be spent in the fields or at the chase. The youth of an industrial culture can spend twenty years and more achieving a basic education before assuming adult responsibilities but no pioneer society can afford to allow its offspring to so waste its time.\"  Natt Roberts was being stubborn. \"But still, a few would carry the torch of knowledge.\"  Plekhanov nodded ponderously. \"For a while. But then comes the reaction against these nonconformists, these crackpots who, by spending time at books, fail to carry their share of the load. One day they wake up to find themselves expelled from the group--if not knocked over the head.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Joe Chessman had been following Plekhanov's argument. He said dourly, \"But finally the group conquers its environment to the point where a minimum of leisure is available again. Not for everybody, of course.\"  Amschel Mayer bounced back into the discussion. \"Enter the priest, enter the war lord. Enter the smart operator who talks or fights himself into a position where he's free from drudgery.\"  Joe Chessman said reasonably, \"If you don't have the man with leisure, society stagnates. Somebody has to have time off for thinking, if the whole group is to advance.\"  \"Admittedly!\" Mayer agreed. \"I'd be the last to contend that an upper class is necessarily parasitic.\"  Plekhanov grumbled, \"We're getting away from the subject. In spite of Mayer's poorly founded opinions, it is quite obvious that only a collectivized economy is going to enable these Rigel planets to achieve an industrial culture in as short a period as half a century.\"  Amschel Mayer reacted as might have been predicted. \"Look here, Plekhanov, we have our own history to go by. Man made his greatest strides under a freely competitive system.\"  \"Well now ...\" Chessman began.  \"Prove that!\" Plekhanov insisted loudly. \"Your so-called free economy countries such as England, France and the United States began their industrial revolution in the early part of the nineteenth century. It took them a hundred years to accomplish what the Soviets did in fifty, in the next century.\"  \"Just a _moment_, now,\" Mayer simmered. \"That's fine, but the Soviets were able to profit by the pioneering the free countries did. The scientific developments, the industrial techniques, were handed to her on a platter.\"  Specialist Martin Gunther, thus far silent, put in his calm opinion. \"Actually, it seems to me the fastest industrialization comes under a paternal guidance from a more advanced culture. Take Japan. In 1854 she was opened to trade by Commodore Perry. In 1871 she abolished feudalism and encouraged by her own government and utilizing the most advanced techniques of a sympathetic West, she began to industrialize.\" Gunther smiled wryly, \"Soon to the dismay of the very countries that originally sponsored bringing her into the modern world. By 1894 she was able to wage a successful war against China and by 1904 she took on and trounced Czarist Russia. In a period of thirty-five years she had advanced from feudalism to a world power.\"  Joe Chessman took his turn. He said obdurately, \"Your paternalistic guidance, given an uncontrolled competitive system, doesn't always work out. Take India after she gained independence from England. She tried to industrialize and had the support of the free nations. But what happened?\"  Plekhanov leaned forward to take the ball. \"Yes! There's your classic example. Compare India and China. China had a planned industrial development. None of this free competition nonsense. In ten years time they had startled the world with their advances. In twenty years--\"  \"Yes,\" Stevens said softly, \"but at what price?\"  Plekhanov turned on him. \"At any price!\" he roared. \"In one generation they left behind the China of famine, flood, illiteracy, war lords and all the misery that had been China's throughout history.\"  Stevens said mildly, \"Whether in their admitted advances they left behind all the misery that had been China's is debatable, sir.\"  Plekhanov began to bellow an angry retort but Amschel Mayer popped suddenly to his feet and lifted a hand to quiet the others. \"Our solution has just"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24749"],["title","Adaptation (#2)"],["body","to me!\"  Plekhanov glowered at him.  Mayer said excitedly, \"Remember what the Co-ordinator told us? This expedition of ours is the first of its type. Even though we fail, the very mistakes we make will be invaluable. Our task is to learn how to bring backward peoples into an industrialized culture in roughly half a century.\"  The messroom's occupants scowled at him. Thus far he'd said nothing new.  Mayer went on enthusiastically. \"Thus far in our debates we've had two basic suggestions on procedure. I have advocated a system of free competition; my learned colleague has been of the opinion that a strong state and a planned, not to say totalitarian, economy would be the quicker.\" He paused dramatically. \"Very well, I am in favor of trying them both.\"  They regarded him blankly.  He said with impatience, \"There are two planets, at different ethnic periods it is true, but not so far apart as all that. Fine, eight of us will take Genoa and eight Texcoco.\"  Plekhanov rumbled, \"Fine, indeed. But which group will have the use of the _Pedagogue_ with its library, its laboratories, its shops, its weapons?\"  For a moment, Mayer was stopped but Joe Chessman growled, \"That's no problem. Leave her in orbit around Rigel. We've got two small boats with which to ferry back and forth. Each group could have the use of her facilities any time they wished.\"  \"I suppose we could have periodic conferences,\" Plekhanov said. \"Say once every decade to compare notes and make further plans, if necessary.\"  Natt Roberts was worried. \"We had no such instructions from the Co-ordinator. Dividing our forces like that.\"  Mayer cut him short. \"My dear Roberts, we were given _carte blanche_. It is up to us to decide procedure. Actually, this system realizes twice the information such expeditions as ours might ordinarily offer.\"  \"Texcoco for me,\" Plekhanov grumbled, accepting the plan in its whole. \"The more backward of the two, but under my guidance in half a century it will be the more advanced, mark me.\"  \"Look here,\" Martin Gunther said. \"Do we have two of each of the basic specialists, so that we can divide the party in such a way that neither planet will miss out in any one field?\"  Amschel Mayer was beaming at the reception of his scheme. \"The point is well taken, my dear Martin, however you'll recall that our training was deliberately made such that each man spreads over several fields. This in case, during our half century without contact, one or more of us meets with accident. Besides, the _Pedagogue's_ library is such that any literate can soon become effective in any field to the extent needed on the Rigel planets.\"     III.   Joe Chessman was at the controls of the space lighter. At his side sat Leonid Plekhanov and behind them the other six members of their team. They had circled Texcoco twice at great altitude, four times at a lesser one. Now they were low enough to spot man-made works.  \"Nomadic,\" Plekhanov muttered. \"Nomadic and village cultures.\"  \"A few dozen urbanized cultures,\" Chessman said. \"Whoever compared the most advanced nation to the Aztecs was accurate, except for the fact that they base themselves along a river rather than on a mountain plateau.\"  Plekhanov said, \"Similarities to the Egyptians and Sumerians.\" He looked over his beefy shoulder at the technician who was photographing the areas over which they passed. \"How does our geographer progress, Roberts?\"  Natt Roberts brought his eyes up from his camera viewer. \"I've got most of what we'll need for a while, sir.\"  [Illustration]  Plekhanov turned back to Chessman. \"We might as well head for their principal city, the one with the pyramids. We'll make initial contact there. I like the suggestion of surplus labor available.\"  \"Surplus labor?\" Chessman said, setting the controls. \"How do you know?\"  \"Pyramids,\" Plekhanov rumbled. \"I've always been of the opinion that such projects as pyramids, whether they be in Yucatan or Egypt, are make-work affairs. A priesthood, or other ruling clique, keeping its people busy and hence out of mischief.\"  Chessman adjusted a speed lever and settled back. \"I can see their point.\"  \"But I don't agree with it,\" Plekhanov said ponderously. \"A society that builds pyramids is a static one. For that matter any society that resorts to make-work projects to busy its citizenry has something basically wrong.\"  Joe Chessman said sourly, \"I wasn't supporting the idea, just understanding the view of the priesthoods. They'd made a nice thing for themselves and didn't want to see anything happen to it. It's not the only time a group in the saddle has held up progress for the sake of remaining there. Priests, slave-owners, feudalistic barons, or bureaucrats of a twentieth-century police state, a ruling clique will never give up power without pressure.\"  Barry Watson leaned forward and pointed down and to the right. \"There's the river,\" he said. \"And there's their capital city.\"  The small spacecraft settled at decreasing speed.  Chessman said, \"The central square? It seems to be their market, by the number of people.\"  \"I suppose so,\" Plekhanov grunted. \"Right there before the largest pyramid. We'll remain inside the craft for the rest of today and tonight.\"  Natt Roberts, who had put away his camera, said, \"But why? It's crowded in here.\"  \"Because I said so,\" Plekhanov rumbled. \"This first impression is important. Our flying machine is undoubtedly the first they've seen. We've got to give them time to assimilate the idea and then get together a welcoming committee. We'll want the top men, right from the beginning.\"  \"The equivalent of the Emperor Montezuma meeting Cortez, eh?\" Barry Watson said. \"A real red carpet welcome.\"  The _Pedagogue's_ space lighter settled to the plaza gently, some fifty yards from the ornately decorated pyramid which stretched up several hundred feet and was topped by a small templelike building.  Chessman stretched and stood up from the controls. \"Your anthropology ought to be better than that, Barry,\" he said. \"There was no Emperor Montezuma and no Aztec Empire, except in the minds of the Spanish.\" He peered out one of the heavy ports. \"And by the looks of this town we'll find an almost duplicate of Aztec society. I don't believe they've even got the wheel.\"  The eight of them clustered about the craft's portholes, taking in the primitive city that surrounded them. The square had emptied at their approach, and now the several thousand citizens that had filled it were peering fearfully from street entrances and alleyways.  Cogswell, a fiery little technician, said, \"Look at them! It'll take hours before they drum up enough courage to come any closer. You were right, doctor. If we left the boat now, we'd make fools of ourselves trying to coax them near enough to talk.\"  Watson said to Joe Chessman \"What do you mean, no Emperor Montezuma?\"  Chessman said absently, as he watched, \"When the Spanish got to Mexico they didn't understand what they saw, being musclemen rather than scholars. And before competent witnesses came on the scene, Aztec society was destroyed. The conquistadors, who did attempt to describe Tenochtitlán, misinterpreted it. They were from a feudalistic world and tried to portray the Aztecs in such terms. For instance, the large Indian community houses they thought were palaces. Actually, Montezuma was a democratically elected war chief of a confederation of three tribes which militarily dominated most of the Mexican valley. There was no empire because Indian society, being based on the clan, had no method of assimilating newcomers. The Aztec armies could loot and they could capture prisoners for their sacrifices, but they had no system of bringing their conquered enemies into the nation. They hadn't reached that far in the evolution of society. The Incas could have taught them a few lessons.\"  Plekhanov nodded. \"Besides, the Spanish were fabulous liars. In Cortez's attempt to impress Spain's king, he built himself up far beyond reality. To read his reports you'd think the pueblo of Mexico had a population pushing a million. Actually, if it had thirty thousand it was doing well. Without a field agriculture and with their primitive transport, they must have been hard put to feed even that large a town.\"  A tall, militarily erect native strode from one of the streets that debouched into the plaza and approached to within twenty feet of the space boat. He stared at it for at least ten full minutes then spun on his heel and strode off again in the direction of one of the stolidly built stone buildings that lined the square on each side except that which the pyramid dominated.  Cogswell chirped, \"Now that he's broken the ice, in a couple of hours kids will be scratching their names on our hull.\"         *       *       *       *       *  In the morning, two or three hours after dawn, they made their preparations to disembark. Of them all, only Leonid Plekhanov was unarmed. Joe Chessman had a heavy handgun holstered at his waist. The rest of the men carried submachine guns. More destructive weapons were hardly called for, nor available for that matter; once world government had been established on Earth the age-old race for improved arms had fallen away.  Chessman assumed command of the men, growled brief instructions. \"If there's any difficulty, remember we're civilizing a planet of nearly a billion population. The life or death of a few individuals is meaningless. Look at our position scientifically, dispassionately. If it becomes necessary to use force--we have the right and the might to back it up. MacBride, you stay with the ship. Keep the hatch closed and station yourself at the fifty-caliber gun.\"  The natives seemed to know intuitively that the occupants of the craft from the sky would present themselves at this time. Several thousands of them crowded the plaza. Warriors, armed with spears and bronze headed war clubs, kept the more adventurous from crowding too near.  The hatch opened, the steel "]]]
