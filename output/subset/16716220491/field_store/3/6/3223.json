Now there is nothing left but the horrible details, all written down in Madie's nice little books.  Thank you, Madie, for the contribution, and now let's adjourn.  There is no end of things to attend to.  Isn't it just glorious to think of having at least a month in the best part of young summer?\"  They all thought it was, and with the decision their actual preparations were begun.     CHAPTER II  BEAUTIFUL BELLAIRE  The great day had come, and with it the girls arrived in Bellaire, after a delightful motor trip from Pennsylvania.  Stopping in the morning at New York, Mr. Harris, whose guests they were, piloted them to one of the big hotels, where their own touring car took its place in the long line of handsome motors, and where Collins, the Harris chauffeur, looked quite as important as any of the other uniformed drivers.  \"Now, suppose we were all piled up with hat boxes,\" whispered Grace to Madaline, for Grace had a distinct liking for good style.  \"But isn't it warm?\" remarked Cleo, whose tangled tresses had a way of gathering heat.  \"I almost wish I had worn a thin blouse.\"  \"We'll order a light lunch, Kimball,\" remarked Mrs. Harris to her husband, \"as the girls can scarcely wait to get out to Bellaire.  Then I'll return with you, and we will leave them to their fate.  I'm sure it will be a kind fate when directed by your good natured sister.  Hope she won't spoil them.\"  And the waiter returning with the order would surely have smiled, had he been human, and not a waiter, for the group awaiting his approach made small effort to conceal his welcome.  En route once more from New York to Bellaire it seemed but a few minutes' run, when finally they drew up to the big rustic house, set back in a rocky nook against the mountain.  \"Oh, isn't it lovely!\" exclaimed Madaline, \"and everything is so clear after smoky Pennsylvania.\"  \"Yes, Bellaire is beautiful,\" Cleo replied, with a show of pride that her relation should be the benefactor.  \"I know we'll have a wonderful time.  Aunt Audrey is like a girl herself, and she knows what girls enjoy.\"  \"Oh, her husband is the author, isn't he?\" Grace remembered.  \"We'll have a chance to see how he writes all his funny books.\"  \"'Fraid not,\" said Cleo, \"Uncle Guy is away.  We are going to have everything to ourselves but his study.  You can be sure that's all locked up.  But look!  See that queer woman dressed like a gypsy!  See her going along by the hedge!  What--do you suppose she is looking for?\"  \"Early dandelions, perhaps,\" ventured Mrs. Harris, who had overheard the question as she stopped in her luggage directions to Collins.  \"But she isn't like a gypsy either,\" Cleo insisted.  \"Look at the lace head dress!\"  \"And the girl with her,\" interposed Grace.  \"My, but she's dressed queer, too.  Looks like something from the stage or movies.\"  The old woman and child had now come up to the big gateway, where the touring car was parked awaiting the exit of another motor that happened to be standing in the Dunbar driveway.  As the strange little girl gazed at the tourists she dropped something--a book--and the woman with her, evidently a caretaker, shook her violently at the trivial accident.  \"Oh!\" exclaimed Grace.  \"How rough, just for dropping a book!\"  \"But look! how that girl stares!\" whispered Madaline.  \"As if she couldn't get her eyes off us.\"  \"Isn't the girl pretty,\" commented Cleo.  The tourists were now gazing with fascinated interest at the old woman in her remarkable garb, and the brown-haired child, with the strange, glaring eyes, that seemed to affix themselves on the three scout girls.  Altogether she seemed quite unlike other children.  Her heavy brown braids hung over her shoulders like a picture of Marguerite in the opera, while her white gauzy dress was banded around with rows of black velvet, just like the artistic costumes worn in Greek plays.  This style on so young a child gave a very stagy and quaint effect.  She, like the woman, had a piece of lace on her head, but the one was white, the other black.  \"See, they have been gathering flowers,\" decided Cleo, and at that moment the woman picked up the book, and attempted to drag the child away in spite of the latter's very evident desire to stare longer at the faces in the big touring car.  \"I should like to know where they live.  We must find out if Aunt Audrey knows them.\"  \"Can't get at my note book,\" remarked Grace, as Collins started in the drive, \"but I am sure not to forget that girl.\"  \"Nor the old woman,\" added Madaline.  \"I shouldn't want her for a nurse.\"  And the last glimpse of the strangers showed the child still dragging behind the woman.  The excitement of arriving at Cragsnook, with its joys of new-found interest, however, soon erased the picture of the pathetic little child and her caretaker from the minds of the three scouts, and when next morning Mrs. Harris bade them good-by and started back to New York, she had no idea what part that first incident of their arrival would play in the children's vacation at Bellaire.  In the care of Mrs. Guy Dunbar, otherwise Audrey Harris, sister to Cleo's father, the girls were indeed well placed and safely established, but Bellaire, being a mountain town near New York, possessed many possibilities for exploration, and at this delightful task the girls determined to set out promptly, for even vacation is not interminable.  \"You may roam as far as you like,\" Aunt Audrey told them next morning, when the call of summer fairly shouted in each pair of expectant ears. \"The girls next door, Lucille and Lalia, are coming over to meet you, and they will show you all the roads, and ways to get lost and found in.\"  \"But, Aunt Audrey,\" began Cleo, \"we saw the queerest woman yesterday just as we arrived.  She was dressed like--well, like a circus person, and she had a little girl with her who just looked scared to death.  Do you know who she could be?\"  Aunt Audrey burst into a musical laugh.  \"Many Bellairites dress like circus folks,\" she answered.  \"In fact Uncle Guy often charges me with that sort of thing.  But what was the special offense of your circus lady?  What did she look like particularly?\"  \"Oh, she wore a black lace scarf on her head, and had some sort of big flowered skirt, and a waist with sleeves like airships.  Then the little girl looked like a Greek dancer, and seemed scared to death,\" illustrated Cleo.  \"I don't happen to place that piece of scenery,\" replied Mrs. Dunbar facetiously, \"but if you see her again, and I'm within call, give me a whistle, and I'll report for inspection duty.  You know I do quite a bit of painting, and I might like to have a model of that sort.  I am sure old Sophia (or is she Azirah?) would fill in beautifully on an oil I am making of yon mountain,\" with a hand wave in the direction of the gray hills looming in hazy tints and shadowy glows against the early morning sky.  Mrs. Dunbar was a beautiful woman, just young enough, rompish enough, and wise enough to get a very good time out of life, and pass some of the pleasure on.  With her ashen blonde hair and very deep blue eyes, she looked like a \"piece of scenery\" herself, as she fluttered about the breakfast room--which was a porch opening from the dining-room, while she made her young visitors happy with her charming grace and genial hospitality.  Grace and Madaline were fascinated by the artistic arrangements of the Dunbar home, but with one member an author and the other a painter, surely unusual taste and effect were to be expected.  \"What wonderful plants and vines, and how early for them to be so--profuse!\" Grace felt safe in remarking, growing things always seeming exempt from the rule against remarks and criticism.  \"Yes, we have a patent hot-house,\" replied Mrs. Dunbar, \"and it works better than the big one out at the garage.  You see, Jennie, our cook, is an old fashioned Jersey woman, and she is resourceful, I must admit. See that little shed made of boxes against the kitchen window?  Well, Jennie does all her winter gardening in that, heats and irrigates it directly from the kitchen.  She claims the steam of cooking is the very best propagator, and we all have to agree with her.  Just see the sweet potato vine and the peanuts.  Don't they look like the very finest ivies?\"  The girls examined the fine growing tendrils that climbed so gracefully from a tiny brick wall, just edging the breakfast room.  The \"wall\" was composed of white tile bricks, and the soft green vines, tumbling over the edges, and capering up on the window ledges, made an effect at once free and conventional.  \"Peanuts and sweet potatoes!\" exclaimed Madaline.  \"Who would think they grew such beautiful, soft green vines!\"  \"I'll leave Cleo to show you about,\" announced Mrs. Dunbar.  \"I'm going to a town meeting this morning.  We are working for a circulating library, to give reading to the people tied up in the hills.  You see stretched out there, over the golf links as far as you can see, are farmers' homes.  The folks are always so busy, and always so tired, they very seldom get to our pretty library, so we can see no good reason why we can't send our library put to them by motor.  And you youngsters will be interested in knowing this plan includes Girl Scouts and Boy Scouts as distributors.  Help yourselves to investigating,\" she concluded, snatching up her white sailor hat and jabbing it on her head with a most determined if a bit reckless slam.  \"I'm off till lunch, "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25626"],["title","The Girl Scouts at Bellaire; Or, Maid Mary's Awakening (#2)"],["body","thirty, you know.  Have a nice time,\" and Audrey Dunbar was off to tackle the novel project of a traveling library for New Jersey farmers.  Left to themselves the girls literally broke loose, and it was not surprising that Jennie should leave her work more than once, to watch surreptitiously, lest some of her choice baby begonias, set out in their tiny and perishable hand painted pots, come to grief in the rampage of the romping girls.  \"Good to populate this big house,\" commented Jennie, \"but swoopy to start out with.\"  At the same time Jennie smiled approvingly as she stopped to watch the three girls run from vase to picture, and from curios to brasses, in their tour of inspection through the artistic home of Guy and Audrey Dunbar.  Just now all three chums were squatted on a beautiful old blue Chinese rug, noses almost buried in the silky fiber, each declaring the tones were different blues from those discovered by the other.  A tap-tap of the brass knocker on the \"pig-door\" off the side porch announced the callers, Lalia and Lucille Hayden, and brought the scout girls up from their rug inspection.  Having met their neighbors the evening previous, the three visitors were soon ready to join them in the proposed tramp over Second Mountain.  \"Our violets are just violeting,\" began Lucille, a jolly little girl who looked like a Japanese doll, with her glossy hair all drawn back in the ultra fashioned style, quite novel to the girls from Pennsylvania. \"And there's no end of bunnies, if you like them,\" she went on, \"although I must confess a rabbit or a rat is apt to make me jump at any time.  Some of the boys from the academy are in the cross-country run, and they're due over the Ridge this morning.  We may get a chance to cheer them if we hurry along,\" she finished.  No need to urge the girl scouts toward that prospective goal, and a few minutes later the mountain paths registered the first steps in the vacation days of the True Tred Girls.  And the path trodden pointed the way to strange adventures--strange even for such experienced hikers as were the visiting girl scouts.     CHAPTER III  THE BROKEN MARATHON  \"Cheers!  Joy!  Also thrills!\" called Lalia, from her lookout on top of a big green rock.  \"There come the boys!  See their red shirts!\"  \"Oh, yes,\" agreed her sister, almost pushing her off the big bowlder in an attempt to get the desired view.  \"Sure enough.  Come on, girls. Slide down the rocks on that side and we'll just about meet their line! Oh! there's Bob Bennet, I know his red head; and Andy MacMurry, I know his biplane arms.  See them swing!\" and Lucille all but lost her balance on the steep down grade, in her attempt to imitate the dauntless Andy, who was just then making famous strides toward the golf links, in the last lap of the Academic Cross Country run.  Along the line of contestants for honors were five boys in all, representing the survival of the fittest in the Spring Sporting Event. Two red shirts were easily distinguishable, as representing the home team, and as these were none other than Bob Bennet and Andy MacMurry mentioned by Lucille, the girls' interest immediately centered in the flying red specks, moving along the great, green golf links like some animated brightly painted automatons.  Heads back, chests out, feet scarcely seeming to move, the two red figures were keeping well up with those in gray, and the others in yellow.  \"Andy's winning!\" shouted Grace, who had quickly made distant acquaintance with the lightsome runner.  \"No, it's Bob!\" insisted Lucille.  \"See his red head like a torch bearer?\"  \"I think Grace is right,\" corrected Lalia.  \"That's Andy--see the arms swing!\"  \"If we could only get over to the club house to see the finish,\" suggested Lucille.  \"Oh, there are the Morgans in their car!  They will give us a lift.  Come on, girls, we can get to the avenue before they pass down,\" and giving an extra spurt to their already overstrained runners, the girls vied with the real contestants in the honors of marathon.  No need to ask for the lift in the Morgan car, for it seemed all Bellaire was making for the club house to see the finish of the Cross Country Run, and the girls piled on the big car exactly as girls do, when coming and going, to and from the ocean, in the height of bathing season.  \"If our boys only hold out!\" breathed Lalia.  \"We'll have the loveliest time at the club house, all our crowd are invited, and we may take our guests, of course,\" indicating the three visitors who were quite as eagerly interested in the race as were the local members of the party.  \"We are starting pretty well,\" remarked Cleo, holding tightly to her support on the side of the auto.  \"We didn't expect to fall into a race first day!\"  \"Oh, vacation is always one grand frolic out here,\" responded Lucille, \"and we always like to make a good start.  Here we are,\" as the car followed the long line of autos threading their way in to the driveway, leading to the big, crowded club house on the emerald golf links.  By this time the runners were almost on their last lap, and cheering and shouting made the air vibrant with the joy of youth and the glory of healthful sport.  \"Andy!  Andy!  Come on, Andy!\" yelled the crowd.  \"At-a-boy!  At-a-boy!\" came the shouts of youngsters who seemed to be suspended in the air, hanging on to everything they could grasp, with reckless risk to life and limb.  The club house orchestra had stopped its entertaining tunes, for guests cared no more for music, the scholaristic runs being of more than usual importance in deciding the season's championship.  \"Bob!  Go it, Bob!\" went up a newly invigorated yell, as the runners turned from the broad field into a narrow stretch, that was outlined by the \"tape\" or finishing line.  \"Oh!\" screamed Cleo suddenly.  \"Look!  That girl is directly in the way!\" and just as she spoke the figure of a girl was seen to dart from somewhere directly into the first runner's path.  She had raised her slim arms as if to stop him, and in the surprise of her sudden appearance Andy, who was well in the lead, stopped, staggered and then toppled over in a heap!  Instantly everything was in wild confusion.  The crowds closed in around the finishing runners, so that from the cars or club house it was impossible to see more than a solid mass of persons.  \"Is he dead?\" boys were asking.  \"Who was the ghost?\" demanded others.  \"She ought to be shot,\" insisted some of the academy boys.  \"It was bad enough, to be on the last lap, but to have a ghost shoot out like that would finish any fellow's heart,\" declared the boy at Cleo's ear.  \"I hope they teach her a lesson.\"  \"Grace!\" Madaline exclaimed.  \"Did you see that dress?  It was the same we saw on the queer girl who stared at us so!  Maybe--she's crazy or something.  I'm sure I could tell that was the same white dress with the black winders.\"  \"Yes,\" declared Cleo to the other girls, \"we saw her yesterday, and she was with the oddest-looking woman.\"  \"Oh, I'll bet she's the girl they call Mary!  Lives somewhere in the mountain, and has that funny old woman with her!\" declared Lucille. \"If she isn't crazy she's very queer.  And however did she get in that line without being seen?\"  \"Why, she just jumped from behind the hedge,\" said Angela Morgan, who was driving the car slowly out of the heavy traffic, \"and I have seen her with that foreign woman down by the springs, always hunting flowers.  They are a queer pair.\"  \"Do you think the crowd will be rough with her?\" asked Cleo anxiously. \"I never saw such eyes as that child looked out of.  Like eyes that looked and couldn't see, sort of dazed,\" explained Cleo.  \"Well, we can't hear who won or what happened until some of the crowd passes out,\" said Lalia, \"If Bob or Andy didn't win I'll be just sick in bed.\"  \"And if anything happened to that queer little girl I'll have more than a mere collapse,\" added Madaline, who had been almost a silent spectator of the whole proceedings.  Just then there was a break in the line of cars, and directly in front of the Morgan machine dashed the little girl in her white dress, her two big braids flopping up and down on her slight shoulders.  And before anyone could reach the roadway, she had again slipped behind the dense hedge and was lost to view.  \"Well, I never!\" gasped Cleo.  \"We'll have to find that woodland fairy some day,\" declared Lucille, and just then they heard that Bob had won the race.     CHAPTER IV  THE EAGLE'S FEATHER  It took but a few days for the visitors to become so well acquainted in their surroundings that even the generous assistance of Lalia and Lucille was no longer necessary at \"the steering wheel.\"  The diversity of scenery in Bellaire furnished such a contrast to that of Flosston that every day unfolded new wonders, and more interesting exploits.  But it was the mystery of the queer little girl, who frightened Andy MacMurry out of his race, and who had met the girls on their arrival in Bellaire, that furnished the real peak to their mountain interest and adventure.  They were determined to hunt her out and unravel the mystery.  \"The strange part of it is,\" said Cleo, as she and her chums were making a schedule for next day in the faithful little note books provided by Madaline at the beginning of their trip, \"the very queer part of it is,\" she continued, \"how the girl pops out of nowhere at almost any time, and she seems to disappear just when one thinks she is well within reach.\"  \"Yes,\" added Grace, \"I heard the drug store boy say this morning that a girl named Mary from Second Mountain was getting medicines without leaving any name, and under the new law some drugs, not poisons either, have to be signed for.  And Dave, that's the druggist's name, said he supposed now she wouldn't come any more, because when he told her that, she gave him a look like a scared owl.  I guess he means an owl looks without seeing, because that's the way our mystery girl looks.\"  \"But she isn't"]]]
